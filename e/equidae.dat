5|$|Equus is a genus {{of mammals}} {{in the family}} <b>Equidae,</b> which {{includes}} horses, asses, and zebras. Within <b>Equidae,</b> Equus is the only recognized extant genus, comprising seven living species. The term equine refers to any member of this genus, including horses. Like <b>Equidae</b> more broadly, Equus has numerous extinct species known only from fossils. The genus most likely originated in North America and spread quickly to the Old World. Equines are odd-toed ungulates with slender legs, long heads, relatively long necks, manes (erect in most subspecies) and long tails. All species are herbivorous, and mostly grazers with simpler digestive systems than ruminants but able to subsist on lower quality vegetation.|$|E
5|$|Besides the horse, {{there are}} seven other species of genus Equus in the <b>Equidae</b> family. These are the ass or donkey, Equus asinus; the {{mountain}} zebra, Equus zebra; plains zebra, Equus quagga; Grévy's zebra, Equus grevyi; the kiang, Equus kiang; and the onager, Equus hemionus.|$|E
5|$|Ancestral {{rhinoceroses}} {{are held}} to have first diverged from other perissodactyls in the Early Eocene. Mitochondrial DNA comparison suggests the ancestors of modern rhinos split from the ancestors of <b>Equidae</b> around 50 million years ago. The extant family, the Rhinocerotidae, {{first appeared in the}} Late Eocene in Eurasia, and the ancestors of the extant rhino species dispersed from Asia beginning in the Miocene.|$|E

5|$|The genus Equus {{was first}} {{described}} by Carl Linnaeus in 1758. It {{is the only}} recognized extant genus in the family <b>Equidae.</b> The first equids were small, dog-sized mammals (e.g. Eohippus) adapted for browsing on shrubs during the Eocene, around 54 million years ago (mya). These animals had three toes on the hind feet and four on the front feet with small hooves in place of claws but also had soft pads. Equids developed into larger, three-toed animals (e.g. Mesohippus) during the Oligocene and Miocene. From there, the tridactyl toes became progressively smaller through the Pleistocene until {{the emergence of the}} single-toed Equus.|$|E
5|$|Equine hooves {{and legs}} have evolved over {{millions}} of years to the form in which they are found today. The original ancestors of horses had shorter legs, terminating in five-toed feet. Over millennia, a single hard hoof evolved from the middle toe, while the other toes gradually disappeared into the tiny vestigial remnants that are found today on the lower leg bones. Prairie-dwelling equine species developed hooves and longer legs that were both sturdy and light weight to help them evade predators and cover longer distances in search of food. Forest-dwelling species retained shorter legs and three toes, which helped them on softer ground. Approximately 35 million years ago, a global drop in temperature created a major habitat change, leading to the transition of many forests to grasslands. This led to a die-out among forest-dwelling equine species, eventually leaving the long-legged, one-toed Equus of today, which includes the horse, as the sole surviving genus of the <b>Equidae</b> family.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} known {{member of}} the family <b>Equidae</b> was the Hyracotherium, which lived between 45 and 55million years ago, during the Eocene period. It had 4toes on each front foot, and 3toes on each back foot. The extra toe on the front feet soon disappeared with the Mesohippus, which lived 32 to 37million years ago. Over time, the extra side toes shrank in size until they vanished. All that remains of them in modern horses is a set of small vestigial bones on the leg below the knee, known informally as splint bones. Their legs also lengthened as their toes disappeared until they were a hooved animal capable of running at great speed. By about 5million years ago, the modern Equus had evolved. Equid teeth also evolved from browsing on soft, tropical plants to adapt to browsing of drier plant material, then to grazing of tougher plains grasses. Thus proto-horses changed from leaf-eating forest-dwellers to grass-eating inhabitants of semi-arid regions worldwide, including the steppes of Eurasia and the Great Plains of North America.|$|E
25|$|The {{condition}} {{is seen in}} other <b>Equidae</b> like mules and donkeys.|$|E
25|$|Three {{lineages}} within <b>Equidae</b> {{are believed}} to be descended from the numerous varieties of Merychippus: Hipparion, Protohippus and Pliohippus. The most different from Merychippus was Hipparion, mainly in the structure of tooth enamel: in comparison with other <b>Equidae,</b> the inside, or tongue side, had a completely isolated parapet. A complete and well-preserved skeleton of the North American Hipparion shows an animal {{the size of a small}} pony. They were very slim, rather like antelopes, and were adapted to life on dry prairies. On its slim legs, Hipparion had three toes equipped with small hooves, but the side toes did not touch the ground.|$|E
25|$|Dinohippus was {{the most}} common species of <b>Equidae</b> in North America during the late Pliocene. It was {{originally}} thought to be monodactyl, but a 1981 fossil find in Nebraska shows some were tridactyl.|$|E
25|$|For a span {{of about}} 20 million years, Eohippus thrived with few {{significant}} evolutionary changes. The most significant change was in the teeth, which began to adapt to its changing diet, as these early <b>Equidae</b> shifted from a mixed diet of fruits and foliage to one focused increasingly on browsing foods. During the Eocene, an Eohippus species (most likely Eohippus angustidens) branched out into various new types of <b>Equidae.</b> Thousands of complete, fossilized skeletons of these animals {{have been found in}} the Eocene layers of North American strata, mainly in the Wind River basin in Wyoming. Similar fossils have also been discovered in Europe, such as Propalaeotherium (which is not considered ancestral to the modern horse).|$|E
25|$|The {{evolution}} of the horse, a mammal of the family <b>Equidae,</b> occurred over a geologic time scale of 50 million years, transforming the small, dog-sized, forest-dwelling Eohippus into the modern horse. Paleozoologists {{have been able to}} piece together a more complete outline of the evolutionary lineage of the modern horse than of any other animal.|$|E
25|$|Ancestral {{rhinoceroses}} first diverged {{from other}} perissodactyls in the Early Eocene. Mitochondrial DNA comparison suggests {{the ancestors of}} modern rhinos split from the ancestors of <b>Equidae</b> around 50 million years ago. The extant family, the Rhinocerotidae, {{first appeared in the}} Late Eocene in Eurasia, and the ancestors of the extant rhino species dispersed from Asia beginning in the Miocene.|$|E
25|$|Miohippus {{ushered in}} a major new period of {{diversification}} in <b>Equidae.</b> While Mesohippus died out in the mid-Oligocene, Miohippus continued to thrive, {{and in the early}} Miocene (245.3 mya), it began to rapidly diversify and speciate. It branched out into two major groups, one of which adjusted to the life in forests once again, while the other remained suited to life on the prairies.|$|E
25|$|The {{evolution}} of Rhinocerotidae follows {{a very similar}} pattern to the {{evolution of}} the <b>Equidae,</b> both being facets of the evolution of mammalian herbivores during the Cenozoic. The overall pattern is based on the evolutionary development of grass and grassland, and further the changing distribution of C3 and C4 types of plant metabolism, so-called because they generate a molecule containing three or four Carbon atoms by different metabolic pathways (sequences of chemical reactions).|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to the changing environment, the then-living species of <b>Equidae</b> also began to change. In the late Eocene, they began developing tougher teeth and becoming slightly larger and leggier, allowing for faster running speeds in open areas, and thus for evading predators in nonwooded areas. About 40 mya, Mesohippus ("middle horse") suddenly developed in {{response to}} strong new selective pressures to adapt, beginning with the species Mesohippus celer and soon followed by Mesohippus westoni.|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} Miocene, C4 {{metabolism}} was well established on the plains. In {{place of the}} prehistoric C3 grasslands (which are no longer extant) was the savanna, today's subtropical mixture of grasses and sedges. The deciding factors in this turn of evolution were a documented increase in temperature and aridity over the period. Faced with scant nutrition from browsing, the smaller Rhinocerotidae and <b>Equidae</b> declined in diversity, the gate in that direction, so to speak, now being closed.|$|E
25|$|The donkey or ass (Equus africanus asinus) is a domesticated {{member of}} the horse family, <b>Equidae.</b> The wild {{ancestor}} of the donkey is the African wild ass, E. africanus. The donkey {{has been used as}} a working animal for at least 5000 years. There are more than 40 million donkeys in the world, mostly in underdeveloped countries, where they are used principally as draught or pack animals. Working donkeys are often associated with those living at or below subsistence levels. Small numbers of donkeys are kept for breeding or as pets in developed countries.|$|E
25|$|Donkeys can interbreed {{with other}} members of the family <b>Equidae,</b> and are {{commonly}} interbred with horses. The hybrid between a jack and a mare is a mule, valued as a working and riding animal in many countries. Some large donkey breeds such as the Asino di Martina Franca, the Baudet de Poitou and the Mammoth Jack are raised only for mule production. The hybrid between a stallion and a jenny is a hinny, and is less common. Like other inter-species hybrids, mules and hinnies are usually sterile. Donkeys can also breed with zebras in which the offspring is called a zonkey (among other names).|$|E
25|$|However, all <b>Equidae</b> in North America {{ultimately}} became extinct. The {{causes of}} this extinction (simultaneous with the extinctions {{of a variety}} of other American megafauna) have been a matter of debate. Given the suddenness of the event and because these mammals had been flourishing for millions of years previously, something quite unusual must have happened. The first main hypothesis attributes extinction to climate change. For example, in Alaska, beginning approximately 12,500 years ago, the grasses characteristic of a steppe ecosystem gave way to shrub tundra, which was covered with unpalatable plants. The other hypothesis suggests extinction was linked to overexploitation by newly arrived humans of naive prey that were not habituated to their hunting methods. The extinctions were roughly simultaneous {{with the end of the}} most recent glacial advance and the appearance of the big game-hunting Clovis culture. Several studies have indicated humans probably arrived in Alaska at the same time or shortly before the local extinction of horses. Additionally, it has been proposed that the steppe-tundra vegetation transition in Beringia may have been a consequence, rather than a cause, of the extinction of megafaunal grazers.|$|E
2500|$|The {{evolution}} of Rhinocerotidae and <b>Equidae</b> in the Miocene grasslands proceeded along parallel lines from similar causes. Diminutive, cursorial, browsing, brachydont species expanded their ranges from the Oligocene forests into the nutritious C3 Miocene grasslands and there over {{the millions of}} years of the Miocene evolved diverse and flourishing populations on the ample food supply, gradually increasing in size. Some of these species exploited the grazing niche. Hispanotherium, Chilotherium and Teleoceras [...] "show a clear tendency to hypsodonty, and a grazing feeding adaptation has usually been attributed to them".|$|E
2500|$|The horse family <b>Equidae</b> and {{the genus}} Equus evolved in North America. Fossil {{evidence}} {{dating to the}} Eocene [...] Studies using ancient DNA as well as DNA of recent individuals shows there once were two closely related horse species in North America, the wild horse (Equus ferus), and Equus francisci or [...] "New World stilt-legged horse" [...] (taxonomically assigned to various names). Horses existed in Canada as recently as 12,000 years ago, and a 1992 study produced evidence that horses existed in the Americas until 8,000–10,000 years ago.|$|E
2500|$|Mesohippus was {{slightly}} larger than Epihippus, about 610mm (24in) at the shoulder. Its back was less arched, and its face, snout, and neck were somewhat longer. It had significantly larger cerebral hemispheres, and had a small, shallow depression on its skull called a fossa, which in modern horses is quite detailed. The fossa serves as a useful marker for identifying an equine fossil's species. Mesohippus had six grinding [...] "cheek teeth", with a single premolar in fronta trait all descendant <b>Equidae</b> would retain. Mesohippus also had the sharp tooth crests of Epihippus, improving its ability to grind down tough vegetation.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Equidae</b> {{died out}} in the Western Hemisphere {{at the end of}} the last glacial period. A {{question}} raised is why and how horses avoided this fate on the Eurasian continent. It has been theorized that domestication saved the species. While the environmental conditions for equine survival in Europe were somewhat more favorable in Eurasia than in the Americas, the same stressors that led to extinction for the Mammoth had an effect upon horse populations. Thus, some time after 8000 BCE, the approximate date of extinction in the Americas, humans in Eurasia may have begun to keep horses as a livestock food source, and by keeping them in captivity, may have helped to preserve the species. Horses also fit the six core criteria for livestock domestication, and thus, it could be argued, [...] "chose" [...] to live in close proximity to humans.|$|E
2500|$|The {{possibility}} of extraterrestrial life having different reproductive sexuality {{is the basis}} for many references. In the [...] episode [...] "", Trip Tucker becomes pregnant with the offspring of a female of another species. In the video game The Sims 2 male characters can be impregnated via cheat codes or alien abduction. In the American Dad! episode [...] "Deacon Stan, Jesus Man", the boy Steve becomes impregnated after giving the mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to the extraterrestrial Roger, then unwittingly passes it on to his girlfriend via a kiss. In the animated series Futurama, the extraterrestrial Kif can be impregnated by a touch. In the SciFi Channel miniseries, , the extraterrestrial Rygel becomes impregnated with human John and Aeryn's baby. In the series Alien Nation, when Tectonese main character George Francisco and his wife Susan decide to have a third child, it is revealed that, in order to conceive, a Tectonese couple needs a third party, called a binnaum, to complete impregnation, and that the male carries the baby—encased in a pod—during the final months of gestation. In the Ren & Stimpy [...] "Adult Party Cartoon" [...] episode [...] "Stimpy's Pregnant" [...] features Stimpy who is pregnant but Mr. Horse finds out that he is actually constipated. In the animated series The Fairly OddParents in the TV film Fairly OddBaby, the fairy Cosmo was pregnant of Baby Poof. In the [...] episode [...] "Save the Last Dance", it is revealed that Necrofriggians have an ability to asexually reproduce once every 80 years: building a large nest made of digested metal, where their eggs will hatch, then their offspring feed from metal and will first eat from the nest, before they instinctively will feed on solar plasma until they mature and starts their own separate lives. Due to the Necrofriggian reproduction cycle, Big Chill overtook Ben's personality to carry out the process, but Ben doesn't remember anything he does as Big Chill during this cycle, like he eats metal and had 14 babies, and felt very embarrassed when Gwen, Kevin and Julie explained, and Kevin's teasing and calling him [...] "mommy" [...] did not help. In The Three Stooges episode [...] "Even as IOU" [...] Curly accidentally swallows a Vitamin Z pill meant for a horse. However, the error allows Curly to give birth to an <b>Equidae,</b> which the Stooges crown as a winning race horse.|$|E

60|$|I {{think that}} this desideratum is very nearly, if not quite, {{supplied}} by Plagiolophus, remains of which occur abundantly {{in some parts of}} the Upper and Middle Eocene formations. The patterns of the grinding-teeth of Plagiolophus are similar to those of Anchitherium, and their crowns are as thinly covered with cement; but the grinders diminish in size forwards, and the last lower molar has a large hind lobe, convex outwards and concave inwards, as in Palceotherium. The ulna is complete and much larger than in any of the <b>Equidae,</b> while it is more slender than in most of the true Palaeotheria; it is fixedly united, but not ankylosed, with the radius. There are three toes in the fore limb, the outer ones being slender, but less attenuated than in the <b>Equidae.</b> The femur is more like that of the Palaeotheria than that of the horse, and has only a small depression above its outer condyle in the place of the great fossa which is so obvious in the <b>Equidae.</b> The fibula is distinct, but very slender, and its distal end is ankylosed with the tibia. There are three toes on the hind foot having similar proportions to those on the fore foot. The principal metacarpal and metatarsal bones are flatter than they are in any of the Equidae; and the metacarpal bones are longer than the metatarsals, as in the Palaeotheria.|$|E
60|$|We thus {{see that}} the <b>Equidae</b> differ very widely in {{structure}} from most other mammals. Assuming {{the truth of the}} theory of evolution, we should expect to find traces among extinct animals of the steps by which this great modification has been effected; and we do really find traces of these steps, imperfectly among European fossils, but far more completely among those of America.|$|E
6000|$|It {{so happens}} that the case which, at present, most nearly fulfils all these {{conditions}} {{is that of the}} series of extinct animals which culminates in the horses, by which term I mean to denote not merely the domestic animals with which we are all so well acquainted, but their allies, the ass, zebra, quagga, and the like. In short, I use [...] "horses" [...] as the equivalent of the technical name <b>Equidæ,</b> which is applied to the whole group of existing equine animals.|$|E
60|$|Whenever such {{remote and}} {{singular}} cases of geographical affinity as the above are pointed out, the first {308} impression is to imagine some mode {{by which a}} communication between the distant countries implicated might be effected; and this way of viewing the problem is almost universally adopted, even by naturalists. But if the principles laid down in this work and in my Geographical Distribution of Animals are sound, such a course is very unphilosophical. For, on the theory of evolution, nothing can be more certain than that groups now broken up and detached were once continuous, and that fragmentary groups and isolated forms are but the relics of once widespread types, which have been preserved in a few localities where the physical conditions were especially favourable, or where organic competition was less severe. The true explanation of all such remote geographical affinities is, that they date {{back to a time}} when the ancestral group of which they are the common descendants had a wider or a different distribution; and they no more imply any closer connection between the distant countries the allied forms now inhabit, than does the existence of living <b>Equidæ</b> in South Africa and extinct <b>Equidæ</b> in the Pliocene deposits of the Pampas, imply a continent bridging the South Atlantic to allow of their easy communication.|$|E
6000|$|Yet more {{remarkable}} {{is the evidence}} afforded by the ancestral forms of the horse tribe which have been discovered in the American tertiaries. The family <b>Equidae,</b> comprising the living horse, asses, and zebras, differ widely from all other mammals in the peculiar structure of the feet, all of which terminate in a single large toe forming the hoof. They have forty teeth, the molars being formed of hard and soft material in crescentic folds, {{so as to be}} a powerful agent in grinding up hard grasses and other vegetable food. The former peculiarities depend upon modifications of the skeleton, which have been thus described by Professor Huxley:-- ...|$|E
60|$|Let us now {{endeavour}} to {{find some}} cases of true linear types, or forms which are intermediate between others because they stand in a direct genetic relation to them. It is no easy matter to find clear and unmistakable evidence of filiation among fossil animals; for, in order that such evidence should be quite satisfactory, {{it is necessary that}} we should be acquainted with all the most important features of the organization of the animals which are supposed to be thus related, and not merely with the fragments upon which the genera and species of the palaeontologist are so often based. M. Gaudry has arranged the species of Hyaenidae, Proboscidea, Rhinocerotidae, and <b>Equidae</b> in their order of filiation from their earliest appearance in the Miocene epoch to the present time, and Professor Rütimeyer has drawn up similar schemes for the Oxen and other Ungulata--with what, I am disposed to think, is a fair and probable approximation to the order of nature. But, as no one is better aware than these two learned, acute, and philosophical biologists, all such arrangements must be regarded as provisional, except in those cases in which, by a fortunate accident, large series of remains are obtainable from a thick and wide-spread series of deposits. It is easy to accumulate probabilities--hard to make out some particular case {{in such a way that}} it will stand rigorous criticism.|$|E
60|$|The same {{conclusion}} may perhaps {{be extended to}} the tiger, {{one of the most}} beautiful animals in the world, the sexes of which cannot be distinguished by colour, even by the dealers in wild beasts. Mr. Wallace believes[369] that the striped coat of the tiger “so assimilates with the vertical stems of the bamboo, as to assist greatly in concealing him from his approaching prey.” But this view does not appear to me satisfactory. We have some slight evidence that his beauty may be due to sexual selection, for in two species of Felis analogous marks and colours are rather brighter in the male than in the female. The zebra is conspicuously striped, and stripes on the open plains of South Africa cannot afford any protection. Burchell[370] in describing a herd says, “their sleek ribs glistened in the sun, and the brightness and regularity of their striped coats presented a picture of extraordinary beauty, in which probably they are not surpassed by any other quadruped.” Here we have no evidence of sexual selection, as throughout the whole group of the <b>Equidæ</b> the sexes are identical in colour. Nevertheless he who attributes the white and dark vertical stripes on the flanks of various antelopes to sexual selection, will probably extend the same view to the Royal Tiger and beautiful Zebra.|$|E
