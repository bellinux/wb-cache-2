2500|$|Despite its {{relatively}} short length, the Gowanus Canal was a hub for Brooklyn's maritime and commercial shipping activity. At its busiest, {{as many as}} 100 ships a day transported cargo through the canal. In addition, the industrial sector around the canal grew substantially over time to include stone and coal yards; flour mills; cement works, and manufactured gas plants; tanneries, factories for paint, ink, and soap; machine shops; chemical plants; and sulfur producers, all of which emitted substantial water and airborne pollutants. Chemical fertilizers were manufactured along the canal soon after the Civil War. Coal processing was a dominant industry along the Gowanus Canal since 1869. Coal plants along the upper canal used large amounts {{of water in the}} conversion of coal to coke, liquids and gases. Coal gas was soon used for <b>heating,</b> <b>light,</b> and factory power. Coke was used to make steel. Wastewater and coal tar (now known {{to be a source of}} carcinogens) were dumped back into the canal.

It was experimentally shown that ion implantation and radiation defects differently affect on the photothermal images of semiconductors by using weakly absorped laser radiation for heating.

A wide range of photopolymers use photoinitiators that react to radiation in range of ultraviolet (UV) wavelength. In the present study we provided measurement of radiant fluence in the UV wavelength range from 280 nm to 400 nm for two data projectors and compared effect of radiation on quality of 3 D printing. One projector is commonly used DLP projector with high energy lamp. Second one is an industrial projector, in which RGB light emitting diodes (LEDs) are replaced by UV LEDs with wattage {{at the level of}} 3. 6 % of the first one.

40|$|Vitrimers {{represent}} {{a new class}} of smart materials. They are covalently crosslinked like thermosets, yet they can be reprocessed like thermoplastics. The underlying mechanism is the rapid exchange reactions which form new bonds while breaking the old ones. So far, heating is the most widely used stimulus to activate the exchange reaction. Compared to <b>heating,</b> <b>light</b> not only is much more convenient to achieve remote and regional control, but can also offer fast healing. Gold nanospheres are excellent photothermal agents, but they are difficult to disperse into vitrimers as they easily aggregate. In this paper, we use polydopamine to prepare gold nanospheres. The resultant polydopamine-coated gold nanospheres (GNS) can be well dispersed into epoxy vitrimers, endowing epoxy vitrimers with light responsivity. The composites can be reshaped permanently and temporarily with light at different intensity. Efficient surface patterning and healing are also demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Droplet-based {{microfluidics}} is {{an emerging}} field that can perform {{a variety of}} discrete operation of tiny amount of reagent or individual cell. Noncontact manipulation of droplets in a microfluidic platform {{can be achieved by}} using the Marangoni convection due to a local temperature gradient given by the irradiation of <b>heating</b> <b>light.</b> This method provides noncontact, selective and flexible manipulation for droplets flowing in microfluidic network. Although the potential of this selective operation method of droplets was confirmed, the driving force exerted on droplets has not been quantitatively obtained. In this study, we have developed a measurement system of the temperature field around droplets during the manipulation by light irradiation and evaluated the manipulation force. In O/W emulsion system with oleic acid and buffer solution, oleic acid for droplet and buffer solution for continuous phase, the temperature distribution around the droplets was measured by laser-induced fluorescence. From the balance of drag force and photo-induced Marangoni force, the driving force was determined. From the results, we confirmed the applicability of the noncontact droplet manipulation using the photothermal Marangoni effect...|$|E
40|$|Wearable {{electronics}} textiles {{are a new}} emerging phenomenon. These are textiles {{that incorporate}} electrical properties, for example <b>heating,</b> <b>light</b> emitting, sensing, etc., and are now being rapidly developed due {{to the creation of}} new types of fibers and fiber composites. The different ways {{that can be used to}} combine conductive fibers with electronics components have been receiving much attention in wearable electronics research. However, to meet the requirements for both aesthetics and function, textiles technology and the garment design method are important for commercial success. In order to apply electronics to fabrics with the use of conductive fibers, complex and elastic fabric structures both need to be modeled. Therefore, the focus of this study is to examine the resistance properties of single pique, a fabric that is conductive and has a knitted structure that uses tuck stitches, a typical structure in knitting. A planar geometric model is established for a single pique structure based on the loop construction of this knitted fabric. Subsequently, resistive network models are developed for different cases of external voltages to calculate the resistance values of single pique fabrics with different numbers of wales and courses. Corresponding experiments are carried out to verify the proposed resistive network modeling. The newly developed resistance model in this study will provide significant benefits to the industrialization of wearable electronics textiles and the apparel industry as they can offer commercial apparel products that are not only aesthetically pleasing and multi-functional, but also have high added value.

40|$|The eclipsing X-ray binary M 33 X- 7 was in {{the field}} of view during several {{observations}} of our XMM-Newton M 33 survey and in the archival Chanfdra observation 1730 which cover {{a large part of the}} 3. 45 d orbital period. We detect emission of M 33 X- 7 during eclipse and a soft X-ray spectrum of the source out of eclipse that can best be described by bremsstrahlung or disk blackbody models. No significant regular pulsations of the source in the range 0. 25 - 1000 s were found. The average source luminosity out of eclipse is 5 E 37 erg/s (0. 5 - 4. 5 keV). In a special analysis of DIRECT observations we identify as optical counterpart a B 0 I to O 7 I star of 18. 89 mag in V which shows the ellipsoidal <b>heating</b> <b>light</b> curve of a high mass X-ray binary with the M 33 X- 7 binary period. The location of the X-ray eclipse and the optical minima allow us to determine an improved binary period and ephemeris of mid-eclipse as HJD (2451760. 61 +- 0. 09) +- N * (3. 45376 +- 0. 00021). The mass of the compact object derived from orbital parameters and the optical companion mass, the lack of pulsations, and the X-ray spectrum of M 33 X- 7 may indicate that the compact object in the system is a black hole. M 33 X- 7 would be the first detected eclipsing high mass black hole X-ray binary. Comment: 9 pages including 6 figures, A&A accepte...|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} a series of spectroscopic {{observations}} of PSR J 1311 - 3430, an extreme black-widow gamma-ray pulsar with a helium-star companion. In a previous study we estimated the neutron star mass as M_NS= 2. 68 +/- 0. 14 M_Sun (statistical error), based on limited spectroscopy and a basic (direct <b>heating)</b> <b>light</b> curve model; however, much larger model-dependent systematics dominate the mass uncertainty. Our new spectroscopy reveals a range of complex source behavior. The variable He I companion wind emission lines can dominate broad-band photometry, especially in red filters or near minimum brightness, and the wind flux should complete companion evaporation in a spin-down time. The heated companion face also undergoes dramatic flares, reaching 40, 000 K over 20 % of the star; this is likely powered by a magnetic field generated in the companion. The companion center-of-light radial velocity is now well measured with K_CoL = 615. 4 +/- 5. km/s. We detect non-sinusoidal velocity components due to the heated face flux distribution. Using our spectra to excise flares and wind lines, we generate substantially improved light curves for companion continuum fitting. We show that the inferred inclination and neutron star mass, however, remain sensitive to the poorly constrained heating pattern. The neutron star's mass, M_NS, is likely less than the direct heating value and could range as low as 1. 8 M_Sun for extreme equatorial heating concentration. While we cannot yet pin down M_NS, our data imply that an intrabinary shock reprocesses the pulsar emission and heats the companion. Improved spectra and, especially, models that include such shock heating are needed for precise parameter measurement. Comment: 10 pages, 11 figures to appear in the Astrophysical Journa...|$|E
