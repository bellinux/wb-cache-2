5|$|The F-16 was {{designed}} to be relatively inexpensive to build and simpler to maintain than earlier-generation fighters. The airframe is built with about 80% aviation-grade aluminum alloys, 8% steel, 3% composites, and 1.5% titanium. The leading-edge flaps, stabilators, and ventral fins make use of bonded aluminum honeycomb structures and graphite <b>epoxy</b> lamination coatings. The number of lubrication points, fuel line connections, and replaceable modules is significantly lower than predecessors; 80% of access panels can be accessed without stands. The air intake was placed so it was rearward of the nose but forward enough to minimize air flow losses and reduce aerodynamic drag.|$|E
5|$|To make {{brominated}} polymers and plastics, bromine-containing compounds can {{be incorporated}} into the polymer during polymerisation. One method is to include a relatively small amount of brominated monomer during the polymerisation process. For example, vinyl bromide can be used in the production of polyethylene, polyvinylchloride or polypropylene. Specific highly brominated molecules can also be added that participate in the polymerisation process For example, tetrabromobisphenol A can be added to polyesters or <b>epoxy</b> resins, where it becomes part of the polymer. Epoxys used in printed circuit boards are normally made from such flame retardant resins, indicated by the FR in the abbreviation of the products (FR-4 and FR-2). In some cases the bromine containing compound may be added after polymerisation. For example, decabromodiphenyl ether can be added to the final polymers.|$|E
25|$|There {{are quite}} a few {{different}} dielectrics that can be chosen to provide different insulating values depending on the requirements of the circuit. Some of these dielectrics are polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon), FR-4, FR-1, CEM-1 or CEM-3. Well known pre-preg materials used in the PCB industry are FR-2 (phenolic cotton paper), FR-3 (cotton paper and <b>epoxy),</b> FR-4 (woven glass and <b>epoxy),</b> FR-5 (woven glass and <b>epoxy),</b> FR-6 (matte glass and polyester), G-10 (woven glass and <b>epoxy),</b> CEM-1 (cotton paper and <b>epoxy),</b> CEM-2 (cotton paper and <b>epoxy),</b> CEM-3 (non-woven glass and <b>epoxy),</b> CEM-4 (woven glass and <b>epoxy),</b> CEM-5 (woven glass and polyester). Thermal expansion is an important consideration especially with ball grid array (BGA) and naked die technologies, and glass fiber offers the best dimensional stability.|$|E

50|$|The {{applications}} for epoxy-based materials are extensive and include coatings, adhesives and composite {{materials such as}} those using carbon fiber and fiberglass reinforcements (although polyester, vinyl ester, and other thermosetting resins are also used for glass-reinforced plastic). The chemistry of <b>epoxies</b> {{and the range of}} commercially available variations allows cure polymers to be produced with a very broad range of properties. In general, <b>epoxies</b> are known for their excellent adhesion, chemical and heat resistance, good-to-excellent mechanical properties and very good electrical insulating properties. Many properties of <b>epoxies</b> can be modified (for example silver-filled <b>epoxies</b> with good electrical conductivity are available, although <b>epoxies</b> are typically electrically insulating). Variations offering high thermal insulation, or thermal conductivity combined with high electrical resistance for electronics applications, are available.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Fracture {{toughness}} {{and other}} mechanical properties of <b>epoxies</b> modified with nano-slica particles were measured to elaborate effects of nano-additives on fracture behaviour of the modified <b>epoxies.</b> Interlaminar fracture behaviours of the nano-silica modified CF/EP composites were subsequently investigated by conducting Mode-I and Mode-II interlaminar fracture toughness tests {{as well as}} transverse tension tests. It {{was found that the}} fracture toughness of the nano-silica modified <b>epoxies</b> and the interlaminar fracture toughness of nano-silica modified CF/EP composites have been increased significantly (> 50 %), while the strength and modulus of the materials remain unchanged or slightly higher. In particular, the nano-silica modified <b>epoxies</b> showed only very little reduction in the glass transition temperature (Tg) ...|$|R
25|$|<b>Epoxy,</b> metal-filled <b>epoxy,</b> and metal-coated <b>epoxy</b> is {{used for}} tooling that has an EOL {{in the tens of}} {{thousands}} of parts. It is typically used for molding flexible foam cushions and seating, integral skin and microcellular foam padding, and shallow-draft RIM bezels and fascia. The heat transfer characteristic of <b>epoxy</b> tooling is fair; the heat transfer characteristic of metal-filled and metal-coated <b>epoxy</b> is good. Copper tubing can be incorporated into the body of the tool, allowing hot water to circulate and heat the mold surface.|$|E
25|$|The epoxy/core test, detects voids by {{visual and}} {{mechanical}} methods. It consists of drilling a 25 to 50 millimeter {{hole through the}} pavement into the sub-base with a dry-bit roto-hammer. Next, a two-part <b>epoxy</b> is poured into the hole – dyed for visual clarity. Once the <b>epoxy</b> hardens, technicians drill through the hole. If a void is present, the <b>epoxy</b> will stick to the core and provide physical evidence.|$|E
25|$|<b>Epoxy</b> is more {{expensive}} than tape, but provides a greater mechanical bond between the heat sink and component, as well as improved thermal conductivity. The <b>epoxy</b> chosen must be formulated for this purpose. Most epoxies are two-part liquid formulations that must be thoroughly mixed before being applied to the heat sink, and before the heat sink {{is placed on the}} component. The <b>epoxy</b> is then cured for a specified time, which can vary from 2 hours to 48 hours. Faster cure time can be achieved at higher temperatures. The surfaces to which the <b>epoxy</b> is applied must be clean and free of any residue.|$|E
40|$|Composites {{of ceramic}} powders in <b>epoxies</b> {{appropriate}} for both insulating and impregnating NbTi windings are studied. Specific heat, thermal conductivity, thermal contraction, and magnetocaloric measurements on composites are presented. Thermal contractions well matched to copper are found and thermal shock resistance is greatly enhanced. Enthalpies, 4. 2 - 6 K, range up to 80 mJ/cu cm and are 20 - 50 {{times larger than}} that of the pure <b>epoxies.</b> Results are not specific to the <b>epoxies</b> used but apply to composites with any amorphous matrices...|$|R
