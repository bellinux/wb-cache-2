2500|$|Rachel Katz (née Menken) (Maggie Siff); regular Season 1, {{guest star}} Seasons 2 and 7: The Jewish {{head of a}} {{department}} store who comes to Sterling Cooper {{in search of an}} advertising agency to revamp her business's image. She is initially cool towards Don Draper, who bristles at her assertive, <b>independent</b> <b>image,</b> but they warm to each other and eventually begin an affair. In the course of their affair, Don tells her things he has not shared with Midge Daniels (his previous mistress) or his wife. When Don is blackmailed by Pete Campbell, he comes to Rachel with the suggestion that they run away together to Los Angeles. She reminds him of his duty to his children and questions whether he would want to abandon his children after having grown up without a father. When Don persists, Rachel comes to the realization that he didn't want to run away with her, he simply wanted to run away. Ironically, her calling him a coward and urging him to think more clearly inspires him to persuade Pete to stand down. The relationship seems to collapse from that point on, and Cooper complains to Don about how upset he has made her. Don and Rachel end the affair at some point {{between the first and second}} seasons. He encounters her again in Season 2 while out to eat with Bobbie Barrett, finding out that Rachel has moved on and married a man named Tilden Katz. Though it appears that Don is only momentarily shaken by the news of her marriage, several episodes later, after drinking heavily with Roger and Freddie Rumsen, he gives his name as [...] "Tilden Katz" [...] to the bouncer of an underground club Roger is trying to get them into. In Season 7, Don sees Rachel in a vision while auditioning actresses for a fur commercial, but when he attempts to contact her, he learns that Rachel had two children and that she died from leukemia.|$|E
60|$|She made no {{more than}} that of the most fatuous of freedoms, as he felt {{directly}} he had spoken that it might have seemed to her; and before he had even time to welcome the relief of not having then himself, for beastly contrition, to make more of it, she had simply mentioned, with her affectionate ease, that she wanted to get away, that of the bores there she might easily, after a little, have too much, and that if he'd but say the word they'd nip straight out together by an independent door and be sure to find her motor in the court. What word he had found to say, he was afterward to reflect, must have little enough mattered; for he was to have kept, of what then occurred, but a single other impression, that of her great fragrant rustle beside him over the rest of the ample room and toward their nearest and friendliest resource, the door by which he had come in and which gave directly upon a staircase. This <b>independent</b> <b>image</b> was just that of the only other of his fellow-guests with whom he had been closely concerned; he had thought of him rather indeed, up to that moment, as the Princess's fellow-Olympian--but a new momentary vision of him seemed now to qualify it.|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} spatiotemporal independent component analysis, {{a method}} which simultaneously maximises statistical independence over both time and space. Independent component analysis (ICA) {{of an image}} sequence extracts a set of statistically <b>independent</b> <b>images,</b> and denes a corresponding set of unconstrained dual time courses. However, the extra degrees of freedom implicit in these time courses can lead to solutions consisting of statistically <b>independent</b> <b>images</b> which are obtained {{at the expense of}} physically improbable time courses. Accordingly, we introduce a method for regularising ICA: spatiotemporal ICA (stICA). stICA is based on the observation that the underlying source images and time courses associated with viscous media (such as brain tissue) tend toward statistical independence, but neither source images nor time courses are independent in such media. stICA is demonstrated on data obtained from a left-right visual stimulation fMRI experiment. 1 Introduction: Sp [...] ...|$|R

40|$|By {{definition}} a separable {{state has}} the form ∑ A_i ⊗ B_i, where 0 ≤ A_i, B_i for each i. In this paper {{we consider the}} class of states which admit such a decomposition with B_ 1, [...] ., B_p having <b>independent</b> <b>images.</b> We give a simple intrinsic characterization of this class of states, and starting with a density matrix in this class, describe a procedure to find such a decomposition with B_ 1, [...] ., B_p having <b>independent</b> <b>images,</b> and A_ 1, [...] ., A_p being distinct with unit trace. Such a decomposition is unique, and we relate this to the facial structure of the set of separable states. A special subclass of such separable states are those for which the rank of the matrix matches one marginal rank. Such states have arisen in previous studies of separability (e. g., they {{are known to be}} a class for which the PPT condition is equivalent to separability).

Western depictions in the Middle Ages that often seem to depict the ecce homo scene, (and are usually {{interpreted}} as such) {{more often than not}} only show the crowning of thorns and the mocking of Christ, (cf. the Egbert Codex and the Codex Aureus Epternacensis) which precede the actual ecce homo scene in the Bible.

President Fox’s administration achieved early public recognition for its commitment to anti-poverty strategies {{as well as its}} willingness to continue with earlier initiatives that had proved to be successful. Fox ultimately decided to continue with the program because its <b>independent</b> <b>image</b> meant that it had not become identified with the old ruling party (the PRI) or with former President Zedillo {{in the eyes of the}} public. In addition, Fox had received confirmation of the program’s benefits both from the program’s own impact evaluations and outside international financial institutions who held Oportunidades in high esteem and hoped to see it continue.|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates {{projective}} invariants of geometric configurations in 3 dimensional {{projective space}} P 3, and most particularly the computation of invariants from {{two or more}} <b>independent</b> <b>images.</b> A basic tool in this investigation is the essential matrix defined by Longuet-Higgins ([10]), for this matrix describes the epipolar correspondence between image pairs. It is proven that once the epipolar geometry is known, the configurations of many geometric structures (for instance sets of points or lines) are determined up to a collineation of P 3 by their projection in two <b>independent</b> <b>images.</b> This theorem {{is the key to}} a method for the computation of invariants of the geometry. Invariants of 6 points in P 3 and of four lines in P 3 are defined and discussed in detail. An example with real images shows that they are effective in distinguishing different geometrical configurations. Since the essential matrix is a fundamental tool in the computation of these invariants, new methods of computing the essential matrix from 7 point correspondences in two images, 6 point correspondences in 3 images or 13 line correspondences in three images are described. ...|$|R

40|$|C 3 Po is {{a concept}} for a novel array {{detector}} concept that is optimized for highly sensitive and precise differential imaging such as needed for astrophysical polarimetry. Chopping between two or more <b>independent</b> <b>image</b> states (such as four linearly independent polarization states) can be performed at speeds in the kHz domain to provide virtually simultaneous images without the need to read out the array at kHz frame rates. This allows the technology {{to be applied to}} large arrays with precise, slow readouts. All <b>independent</b> <b>image</b> planes are observed with the same physical pixel on the detector, which renders normalized differences between image planes insensitive to the gain of individual pixels. The detector concept has 100 % geometrical fill factor and a quantum efficiency approaching unity. The technology can be applied to silicon to cover the 200 - 1100 nm wavelength range, and to infrared-sensitive materials such as HgCdTe or InSb for the 1 - 20 µm wavelength range. While the detector concept has a wide range of potential applications outside of astronomy, we focus here on its application to polarimetric observations of the Sun...|$|E
