This text describes Laozi's emigration to India and the transmission of the Daode Jing to Yin Xi. However, the text is not really a narrative, but uses the stories as a framework to describe how an adept should live his life. The text describes how an adept can make use of the Dao that <b>is</b> <b>inherent</b> in the world, outlines meditation techniques, and discusses the results of living a sagely life and what happens after death.|$|E

25|$|According to Mahabharata epic, the God {{of death}} {{took the form}} of a woman and resides {{on the banks of the}} river to limit {{population}} growth. Kosi resonates with the folklore of Mithila. The most important depictions of Kosi folklore are Kosi as a virgin absolutely care free and full of energy and as a frustrated wife of old hermit Richeek wandering in the Himalayas. Kosi is also invoked as the mother - 'Kosi Ma'. These images capture the contradiction that <b>is</b> <b>inherent</b> in the Kosi River as a source of life and death, prosperity and destruction; a mother and an enchanting virgin.|$|E

Furthermore, the analog hole cannot be overcome without the additional protection of externally imposed restrictions, such as legal regulations, because the vulnerability <b>is</b> <b>inherent</b> to all analog means of transmission. However, the conversion from digital to analog and back is likely to force a loss of quality, particularly when using lossy digital formats.
