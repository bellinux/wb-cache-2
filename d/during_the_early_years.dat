5|$|<b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>years</b> of the 1960s the Australian Army and Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) {{considered}} {{new types}} of tactical transport aircraft to replace the RAAF's obsolete Douglas Dakotas.

In 1545 it became a part of the Diocese of Chiapa. It was returned to Guatemala in 1561, and back to Chiapa in 1596.|$|E

D'Amory was a royal favourite and Edward II visited the Castle several times, with an extensive renovation of the rooms and quarters occurring during this time.

5|$|The Underground Group's {{ownership}} of the highly profitable London General Omnibus Company (LGOC) since 1912 had enabled the Group, through the pooling of revenues, to use profits from the bus company to subsidise the less profitable railways.
