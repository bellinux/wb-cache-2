40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{collaborative}} approach {{to capture and}} detect <b>human</b> <b>interactions</b> in meetings by employing multiple sensors, such as video cameras, microphones, and motion sensors. Different from physical interactions (e. g. turn-taking and addressing), the <b>human</b> <b>interactions</b> here are incorporated with semantics, i. e. user intention or attitude towards a topic. The contexts used for interaction detection include head gesture, attention from others, speech tone, speaking time, interaction occasion, and information about previous interaction. The support vector machines (SVM) classifier is adopted to recognize <b>human</b> <b>interactions</b> based on these features. The experimental results verified the proposed approach. 1...|$|R

5|$|Recent {{expeditions to}} Davidson {{have focused on}} its ecology, and {{specifically}} on the variety of deep-sea corals, some over 100 years old, that live on its banks. These large colonies are extremely fragile to <b>human</b> <b>interaction.</b> Davidson's proximity to scientific research institutions has helped its exploration, as multiple dives, mappings, and studies have made {{it one of the}} better-studied seamounts in the world.|$|E
5|$|Sangay {{is one of}} two active volcanoes {{located within}} the namesake Sangay National Park, the other being Tungurahua to the north. As such it has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1983. The area's {{isolation}} has allowed it to maintain a pristine ecology relatively untouched by <b>human</b> <b>interaction,</b> and the park hosts a biome ranging from alpine glaciers on the volcanoes' peaks to tropical forest on their flanks. Altitude and rainfall are the most significant local factors affecting fauna, and therefore the most lush ecosystems are found on the wetter parts of the volcano's eastern slope.|$|E

5|$|The Moorland Indicators of Climate Change Initiative {{was set up}} in 2008 {{to collect}} data on climate change in the area. Students {{investigated}} the interaction between people and the moorlands, and their overall effect on climate change, to discover whether the moorlands are a net carbon sink or source, {{based on the fact that}} upland areas of Britain are a significant global carbon store in the form of peat. <b>Human</b> <b>interaction</b> in terms of direct erosion and fire as well as the effects of global warming are the major variables that they considered.|$|E
5|$|The Tevis novel {{had been}} optioned several times, {{including}} by Frank Sinatra, but attempts to adapt {{it for the}} screen were unsuccessful. Director Rossen's daughter Carol Rossen speculates that previous adaptations focused {{too much on the}} pool aspects of the story and not enough on the <b>human</b> <b>interaction.</b> Rossen, who had hustled pool himself as a youth and who had made an abortive attempt to write a pool-themed play called Corner Pocket, optioned the book and teamed with Sidney Carroll to produce the script.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{evidence of}} <b>human</b> <b>interaction</b> with hippos comes from butchery cut marks on hippo bones at Bouri Formation dated around 160,000 years ago. Later rock paintings and engravings showing hippos being hunted {{have been found}} in the mountains of the central Sahara dated 4,000–5,000 years ago near Djanet in the Tassili n'Ajjer Mountains. The ancient Egyptians recognised the hippo as a ferocious denizen of the Nile and representations on the tombs of nobles show that the animals were hunted.|$|E

5|$|The open {{nature of}} the New Forest means that ponies are able to wander onto roads. The ponies {{actually}} have right of way over vehicles and many wear reflective collars {{in an effort to}} reduce traffic fatalities, but despite this, many ponies, along with commoners' cattle, pigs, and donkeys are killed or injured in road traffic accidents every year. <b>Human</b> <b>interaction</b> with ponies is also a problem; well meaning but misguided visitors to the forest frequently feed them, which can create dietary problems and sickness (eg colic) and cause the ponies to adopt an aggressive attitude in order to obtain human food.|$|E
5|$|While Hawks was not {{sympathetic}} to feminism, he popularized the Hawksian woman archetype, a portrayal {{of women in}} more strong, less effeminate roles. Such an emphasis had never {{been done in the}} 1920s and therefore was seen to be a rarity and, according to Naomi Wise, has been cited as a prototype of the post-feminist movement. Another notable theme carried throughout his work included the relationship of morality and <b>human</b> <b>interaction.</b> In this sense he tended to portray more dramatic elements of a concept or a plot in a humorous way.|$|E
5|$|While the African wildcat is {{the ancestral}} {{subspecies}} from which domestic cats are descended, and wildcats and domestic cats can completely interbreed (being subspecies {{of the same}} species), several intermediate stages occur between domestic pet and pedigree cats {{on one hand and}} entirely wild animals on the other. The semiferal cat, a mostly outdoor cat, is not owned by any one individual, but is generally friendly to people and may be fed by several households. Feral cats are associated with human habitation areas and may be fed by people or forage for food, but are typically wary of <b>human</b> <b>interaction.</b>|$|E

5|$|Various {{types of}} pancake {{machines}} exist, {{such as those}} that run pancake batter through a heated conveyor inside of a box unit, and those that automatically drop pancake batter onto a flattop grill. Some pancake machines, such as one developed by Crepe-Coer, cook both sides of a pancake simultaneously. Semi-automatic pancake machines also exist, which require some <b>human</b> <b>interaction</b> to function, such as the pouring of batter. Commercial pancake machines may be used in the foodservice industry, in cafeterias and by restaurants, and can serve to reduce the waste of stale pancake batter. Some hotels have pancake machines that guests are allowed to operate. They are also used in other environments in a self-service manner, such as in upscale airport lounges and hotels.|$|E
