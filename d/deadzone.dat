40|$|Abstract — In this paper, two {{multiple}} description coding schemes are developed, {{based on}} prediction-induced randomly offset quantizers and unequal-deadzone-induced near-uniformly offset quantizers, respectively. In both schemes, each description encodes one source subset {{with a small}} quantization stepsize, and other subsets are predictively coded with a large quantization stepsize. In the first method, due to predictive coding, the quan-tization bins that a coefficient belongs to in different descriptions are randomly overlapped. The optimal reconstruction is obtained by finding the intersection of all received bins. In the second method, joint dequantization is also used, but near-uniform offsets are created among different low-rate quantizers by quan-tizing the predictions and by employing unequal <b>deadzones.</b> By generalizing the recently developed random quantization theory, the closed-form expression of the expected distortion is obtaine...|$|R

40|$|Arrearage {{phenomenon}} commonly {{exists in}} actuators. With arrearages, the actuator cannot achieve the target {{suggested by the}} controller, so the control performance degrades. <b>Deadzones</b> and stuck faults can {{be considered to be}} two special classes of arrearages, which are studied widely; however, more general arrearage phenomenon cannot be described and treated by these forms. In this paper, a general formulation is introduced for this phenomenon, which is referred as actuator arrearage faults. Based on this formulation, an improved generalized predictive control scheme is proposed for a class of single-input single-output linear systems. With arrearage faults, the system becomes a stochastic process. Hence, a sufficient condition, which guarantees the output tracking error to be uniformly ultimately bounded in the mean-square sense, is presented in this paper. Simulations are given to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed scheme. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

Furthermore, the control laws have been designed as to simultaneously guarantee also the avoidance of actuator nonlineari- ties, ensuring that the ’forbidden region’ of dead zones and backlash are never entered, even in the presence of uncertainties.

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} a discrete-time {{indirect}} adaptive control algorithm which contains a constrained gradient parameter estimator and a pole assignment control law synthesis module. This adaptive control algorithm {{does not involve}} modifications like data normalization, use of <b>deadzones,</b> or injection of persistently excited signals. Also it requires no a priori knowledge of system modelling errors. It is shown that global robustness properties still hold when this simple algorithm is applied to systems with bounded disturbances and arbitrarily small fast parasitic dynamics. The problem of indirect decentralized adaptive control of interconnected systems is also considered. We use the above adaptive algorithm to design completely decentralized local adaptive controllers for each isolated subsystem by ignoring interactions between subsystems. We show that the local controllers designed in this way are robust {{in the sense that}} all signals in the closed loop adaptive system are bounded for bounded initial conditions, reference inputs, disturbances and an arbitrarily small amount of interaction between subsystems and unmodelled dynamics of each subsystem. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Massive {{macrophyte}} {{development in}} the Flemish running waters {{in the northern part}} ofBelgium {{is a result of the}} improved water quality regarding organic loads in combination witha continuous high nutrient input. Since the macrophytes, higher aquatic plants with roots andstems, are contributing to the flooding problem in the Flemish regions by raising the waterlevel in rivers where the water level already is high, the macrophyte management is animportant issue in the Flemish areas. There are few existing studies of the influence of macrophytes on the nutrient dynamics inrunning waters. Several studies indicate however that macrophytes act as a biological filter,lowering the nutrient concentrations in the flowing waters. This would mean that themacrophyte communities would contribute to a biological cleaning of the water masses,playing a part in the solution of the eutrophication problem in the estuary. This study is a part of a project stretching over 3 years, which in the end will result in apredictive tool for macrophyte management, taking into account the risk of flooding as well asthe possible filtering effect of the macrophytes. The Mike 11 software from DHI in Denmarkis used to simulate the longitudinal hydrodynamics and transport properties of a small riverreach of the Aa-river. An integrated process modeling tool in the Mike software, the Ecolabmodeling tool, is used to build up the biogeochemical model. This will result in a realisticdescription of the macrophyte growth in the near future, in particular regarding its influenceon the nutrient dynamics. At this stage, it is possible to describe the hydrodynamics well for a typical winter period,whereas the hydrodynamic description is more complex during the summer period due tomacrophyte growth. More data are required to have a precise description of thehydrodynamics in the summer, and for the validation of the hydrodynamics in the winter. Thetransport properties of the river reach should be further validated using conductivity data andresults from tracer studies for high and low flow discharges, and the influence of the <b>deadzones</b> will be further investigated using a stochastic one-dimensional model. The biochemicalmodel set-up is only in the starting phase, and process studies of the nutrient uptake by themacrophytes have to be undertaken in order to further develop the biochemical model. www. ima. kth. s...|$|R

40|$|Exposure assessment, {{which is}} an {{investigation}} of the extent of human exposure to a specific contaminant, must include estimates of the duration and frequency of exposure. For a groundwater system, the duration of exposure is controlled largely by the arrival time of the contaminant of concern at a drinking water well. This arrival time, which is normally estimated by using groundwater flow and transport models, can have a range of possible values due to the uncertainties that are typically present in real problems. Earlier arrival times generally represent low likelihood events, but {{play a crucial role in}} the decision-making process that must be conservative and precautionary, especially when evaluating the potential for adverse health impacts. Therefore, an emphasis must be placed on the accuracy of the leading tail region in the likelihood distribution of possible arrival times. To demonstrate an approach to quantify the uncertainty of arrival times, a real contaminant transport problem which involves TCE contamination due to releases from the Lockformer Company Facility in Lisle, Illinois is used. The approach used in this research consists of two major components: inverse modelling or parameter estimation, and uncertainty analysis. The parameter estimation process for this case study was selected based on insufficiencies in the model and observational data due to errors, biases, and limitations. A consideration of its purpose, which is to aid in characterising uncertainty, was also made in the process by including many possible variations in attempts to minimize assumptions. A preliminary investigation was conducted using a well-accepted parameter estimation method, PEST, and the corresponding findings were used to define characteristics of the parameter estimation process applied to this case study. Numerous objective functions, which include the well-known L 2 -estimator, robust estimators (L 1 -estimators and M-estimators), penalty functions, and <b>deadzones,</b> were incorporated in the parameter estimation process to treat specific insufficiencies. The concept of equifinality was adopted and multiple maximum likelihood parameter sets were accepted if pre-defined physical criteria were met. For each objective function, three procedures were implemented as a part of the parameter estimation approach for the given case study: a multistart procedure, a stochastic search using the Dynamically-Dimensioned Search (DDS), and a test for acceptance based on predefined physical criteria. The best performance in terms of the ability of parameter sets to satisfy the physical criteria was achieved using a Cauchy’s M-estimator that was modified for this study and designated as the LRS 1 M-estimator. Due to uncertainties, multiple parameter sets obtained with the LRS 1 M-estimator, the L 1 -estimator, and the L 2 -estimator are recommended for use in uncertainty analysis. Penalty functions had to be incorporated into the objective function definitions to generate a sufficient number of acceptable parameter sets; in contrast, <b>deadzones</b> proved to produce negligible benefits. The characteristics for parameter sets were examined in terms of frequency histograms and plots of parameter value versus objective function value to infer the nature of the likelihood distributions of parameters. The correlation structure was estimated using Pearson’s product-moment correlation coefficient. The parameters are generally distributed uniformly or appear to follow a random nature with few correlations in the parameter space that results after the implementation of the multistart procedure. The execution of the search procedure results in the introduction of many correlations and in parameter distributions that appear to follow lognormal, normal, or uniform distributions. The application of the physical criteria refines the parameter characteristics in the parameter space resulting from the search procedure by reducing anomalies. The combined effect of optimization and the application of the physical criteria performs the function of behavioural thresholds by removing parameter sets with high objective function values. Uncertainty analysis is performed with parameter sets obtained through two different sampling methodologies: the Monte Carlo sampling methodology, which randomly and independently samples from user-defined distributions, and the physically-based DDS-AU (P-DDS-AU) sampling methodology, which is developed based on the multiple parameter sets acquired during the parameter estimation process. Monte Carlo samples are found to be inadequate for uncertainty analysis of this case study due to its inability to find parameter sets that meet the predefined physical criteria. Successful results are achieved using the P-DDS-AU sampling methodology that inherently accounts for parameter correlations and does not require assumptions regarding parameter distributions. For the P-DDS-AU samples, uncertainty representation is performed using four definitions based on pseudo-likelihoods: two based on the Nash and Sutcliffe efficiency criterion, and two based on inverse error or residual variance. The definitions consist of shaping factors that strongly affect the resulting likelihood distribution. In addition, some definitions are affected by the objective function definition. Therefore, all variations are considered in the development of likelihood distribution envelopes, which are designed to maximize the amount of information available to decision-makers. The considerations that are important to the creation of an uncertainty envelope are outlined in this thesis. In general, greater uncertainty appears to be present at the tails of the distribution. For a refinement of the uncertainty envelopes, the application of additional physical criteria is recommended. The selection of likelihood and objective function definitions and their properties are made based on the needs of the problem; therefore, preliminary investigations should always be conducted to provide a basis for selecting appropriate methods and definitions. It is imperative to remember that the communication of assumptions and definitions used in both parameter estimation and uncertainty analysis is crucial in decision-making scenarios...|$|R
