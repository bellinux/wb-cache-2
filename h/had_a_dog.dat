5|$|Himmler met {{his future}} wife, Margarete Boden, in 1927. Seven years his senior, {{she was a}} nurse who shared his {{interest}} in herbal medicine and homoeopathy, and was part owner of a small private clinic. They were married in July 1928, and their only child, Gudrun, was born on 8 August 1929. The couple were also foster parents to a boy named Gerhard von Ahe, son of an SS officer who had died before the war. Margarete sold her share of the clinic and used the proceeds to buy a plot of land in Waldtrudering, near Munich, where they erected a prefabricated house. Himmler was constantly away on party business, so his wife took charge of their efforts—mostly unsuccessful—to raise livestock for sale. They <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>dog,</b> Töhle.|$|E

25|$|Peanuts had {{its origin}} in Li'l Folks, a weekly panel comic that {{appeared}} in Schulz's hometown paper, the St. Paul Pioneer Press, from 1947 to 1950. He first used the name Charlie Brown for a character there, although he applied the name in four gags to three different boys and one buried in sand. The series also <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>dog</b> that looked much like the early 1950s version of Snoopy. In 1948, Schulz sold a cartoon to The Saturday Evening Post which published 17 single-panel cartoons by Schulz. The first of these was of a boy sitting with his feet on an ottoman.|$|E
25|$|At around 6pm on 5 June 1983, Einem (possibly {{along with}} other unknown persons) {{abducted}} Kelvin in a North Adelaide street, just 60 metres from Kelvins' home in Ward Street. Kelvin had just seen off a friend at a nearby bus stop {{on the corner of}} O'Connell and Marian Streets, North Adelaide, and was returning home for dinner. Several witnesses living near to the Kelvins' home heard cries for help, car doors slamming, and a car with a noisy exhaust speeding away. Significantly, Kelvin <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>dog</b> collar in his possession which was likely to have attracted Einem's attention. Einem then tortured, drugged, raped and held Kelvin captive for five weeks, before murdering him and dumping his body alongside an airstrip near Kersbrook in the Adelaide Hills area (to the north-east of the city and close to where relatives of Einem lived).|$|E

And {{whenever}} there was a line that Bob didn't like—he didn't want to complain too much—so, he'd go over, get down on his hands and knees, and repeat the line to the dog, which invariably yawned; and he'd say, 'See, I told you it's not funny!'" [...] Wallace has also commented on the show's lack of Emmy recognition: [...] "People think we were nominated for many an Emmy, people presume we won Emmys, all of us, and certainly Bob, and certainly the show. Nope, never!" ...|$|E
