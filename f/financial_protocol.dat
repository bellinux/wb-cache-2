The implementation of the service may thereby get many new requirements, such as support for a different access method or stricter authorisation and security policies. This thesis discusses the implementation of an ISO 8583 to XML proxy. ISO 8583 is a widely used <b>financial</b> <b>protocol,</b> and was in this project used to communicate with the backing financial server in order to implement a complete web banking system. Hence the proxy encapsulates the already well-proved financial system into a module, that has taken appropriate security concerns and has a messaging schema that is compatible {{with the rest of the}} system. The ISO 8583 and XML protocols are inherently incompatible, and hence the proxy can not be as simple as a translational proxy; it needs to keep state. How to handle this, and how to do it for many clients concurrently is the main focus of this paper. It does however also include a look at the broader picture of the full system, and how some of the implementation specific quirks was handled...|$|E
40|$|Financing of multifamily {{properties}} {{has evolved}} {{dramatically over the}} past decade with the role of traditional actors overshadowed by the emergence of State finance agencies, publicly traded debt real estate investment trusts (REITs), Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, and the private-sponsored secondary market conduits. For example, since 1993, increased holdings by Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, and private-sponsored pools have represented approximately 90 percent of the net increase in conventional multifamily debt in the United States. Changes accompanying this transformation include lower cost access to capital; the decoupling of underwriting, servicing, and investment decisions; and an injection of new capital from investors. Multifamily mortgage rates have fallen relative to single-family rates and U. S. Treasury yields, and regional disparities in loan pricing have narrowed. While the near-term outlook remains bullish, a latent question is whether there is sufficient market discipline to avoid the extreme real estate cycles of the past. The key players and <b>financial</b> <b>protocol</b> in the multifamily real estate industry are signifi-cantly different in the late 1990 s from any time in the past. Since the early 1980 s, the multifamily rental market has travelled a roller-coaster path of boom, bust, and recovery. The changes accompanying this latest business cycle have brought with them a shift from privately held to publicly traded or institutional ownership and financing. On the ownership side, heavily leveraged, privately syndicated partnerships—popular during the 1980 s—have given way to large, publicly traded equity real estate investment trusts (REITs). On the financing side, traditional portfolio lenders—thrifts, commercial banks, Bradley, Nothaft, and Freund...|$|E

Especially in Mediterranean Europe we have to restart from urban capitals (space, identity, quality, service and production) using them as renewed engines of sustainable growth (RE-IMAGINE). In the global change scenario, the shrinking city produces several urban "fragments", functional "chips" and "scraps" of development that, through a recycling process/project, can be brought back into urban infrastructures for new cycles of life (RE-CYCLE). They would be capable to generate new urban and suburban landscape based on abandonment, disposal, de-rating or change of use of urban settlements in a new urban renewal perspective. The field of my paper will cover both living and manufacturing issues, and logistic and military ones, working not only on material assets but also on intangible assets linked to identity resources in areas that can be recycled to produce a new “urban software” (RE-LOAD). The “ethic of responsibility” and the "aesthetic of innovation" in planning requires not only to ensure ecological sustainability of the settlements, but also concrete actions for a creative re-cycle of resources degraded by human activities, by re-activating their latent or potential values excluded from a “debit driven” development, and re-loading their full involvement in the project {{of the future of}} local communities in a renewed alliance with the cities...|$|R

It utilizes a customizable and configurable extensible mark-up language (XML) security policy to provide flexible, multi-level, and fine-grained encryption and hashing methodologies to fixed content CAS entities. PLEDGE secures data objects based on their content and sensitivity and highly overcomes the performance of bulk and raw encryption protocols such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols. Moreover, PLEDGE transparently stores sensitive objects encrypted (partially or totally) in the CAS storage nodes without affecting the CAS storage system operation or performance and takes into consideration the processing load, computing power, and memory capabilities of the client devices which may be constrained by limited processing power, memory resources, or network connectivity.

Over time, documents expanded to include pictures, videos and even web pages. Increasingly, the Internet {{is being used to}} transfer a new kind of data which it was never designed for. In most ways, this new data type fits in naturally to the Internet, taking advantage of the near limit-less expanse of the protocol. Hardware protocols, unlike previous data types, provide a unique set security problem. Much like <b>financial</b> data, hardware <b>protocols</b> extended across the Internet must be protected with authentication. Currently, systems which do authenticate do so through a central server, utilizing a similar authentication model to the HTTPS protocol. This hierarchical model is often at odds with the needs of hardware protocols, particularly in ad-hoc networks where peer-to-peer communication is prioritized over a hierarchical model. Our project attempts to implement a peer-to-peer cryptographic authentication protocol to be used to protect hardware protocols extending over the Internet. The TrusNet project uses public-key cryptography to authenticate nodes on a distributed network, with each node locally managing a record of the public keys of nodes which it has encountered. These keys are used to secure data transmission between nodes and to authenticate the identities of nodes. TrusNet is designed to be used on multiple different types of network interfaces, but currently only has explicit hooks for Internet Protocol connections. As of June 2016, TrusNet has successfully achieved a basic authentication and communication protocol on Windows 7, OSX, Linux 14 and the Intel Edison. TrusNet uses RC- 4 as its stream cipher and RSA as its public-key algorithm, although both of these are easily configurable. Along with the library, TrusNet also enables the building of a unit testing suite, a simple UI application designed to visualize the basics of the system and a build with hooks into the I/O pins of the Intel Edison allowing for a basic demonstration of the system...|$|R

Para isso, foi criado o Ãndice de EficiÃncia da InserÃÃo da VariÃvel Ambiental (IEIVA), atravÃs da adaptaÃÃo de Alimonda e LeÃo (2005), que foi aplicado com cinco instituiÃÃes financeiras, sendo trÃs pÃblicas e duas privadas, atuantes no Brasil. A anÃlise do IEIVA possibilitou conhecer individualmente os Ãndices que o compÃem, permitindo deste modo agir preferencialmente nos indicadores que obtiveram resultados abaixo do esperado, para deste modo melhorar o desempenho total. Ao final pode-se constatar que hÃ uma pequena diferenÃa que favorece as instituiÃÃes financeiras pÃblicas (Protocolo Verde) em relaÃÃo Ãs privadas (PrincÃpios do Equador). PorÃm ressalta-se que estas duas ferramentas â Protocolo Verde e PrincÃpios do Equador - nÃo sÃo as Ãnicas que permitem a introduÃÃo da questÃo ambiental nas instituiÃÃes financeiras, sendo escolhidas por serem as mais difundidas e utilizadas; dessa forma, somente elas nÃo sÃo garantia para a transformaÃÃo de uma InstituiÃÃo Financeira em uma empresa sustentÃvel; porÃm um caminho. O Desenvolvimento SustentÃvel requer aÃÃes conjuntas entre governos, empresas e sociedade. Ã preciso que todos estejam conscientizados da importÃncia de se introduzir um novo modelo econÃmico que favoreÃa a ambos. O que parece ser impossÃvel atualmente, mas que no futuro poderÃ tornar-se indispensÃvel. Assim, a anÃlise da variÃvel ambiental na concessÃo de crÃdito, que hoje parece ser inovadora para o mercado, tem se mostrado apenas necessÃria, diante de recursos naturais cada vez mais escassos. The {{certainty of}} the climatic changes has put in question {{the current economic}} model. The search for profit through consumption, without conscience, has reached new levels {{with the appearance of}} globalization and with that the society has noticed that the resources are finite and that change is necessary. in this new context, there are the financial institutions, companies responsible for financing most of the economic activities, including the most polluting ones. By financing those types of activities, the banks become co-responsible for the environmental impact generated by their clients. Thus, in order to avoid future penalties, several tools were created to help the process of credit evaluation, together with the inclusion of the environmental variable, among them are the Green Protocol and the Equator Principles. Both can be considered initiatives that paved the way for a new modality of business - that includes the environmental risk in their activities and that evaluates their impact in the environment and in the neighboring communities. This study had the goal of measuring the efficiency of the financial institutions in the inclusion of the environmental variable through the Green Protocol and the Equator Principles. For that, was created the Index of Efficiency of Inclusion of the Environmental Variable (IEIVA), through the adaptation of Alimonda and LeÃo (2005). That index was applied to five financial institutions, with great performance in Brazil, being three public and two private. The analysis of IEIVA led {{to the understanding of the}} indices that compose it individually, allowing this way to act preferentially in the indicators that obtained results below the expected, in order to improve the total performance. At the end it was possible to verify that there is a small difference that favors the public <b>financial</b> institutions (Green <b>Protocol)</b> in relation to the private ones (The Equator Principles). Even so it must be emphasized that these two tools - Green Protocol and The Equator Principles - are not the only ones that allow the introduction of the environmental variable in the Financial Institutions, being chosen because they are the more widespread and used; in that way, they do not guarantee the transformation of a financial institution in a sustainable company; even so they open up a road. Sustainable Development demands actions that include governments, companies and society. It is necessary that everybody become aware of the importance of introducing a new economic model that favors all of them. What seems to be now impossible, but that can become indispensable in the future. Therefore the analysis of the environmental variable in the credit concession, that today seems to be innovative for the market, has been showing necessary, before natural resources become rare...|$|R
