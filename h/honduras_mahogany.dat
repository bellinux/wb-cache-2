25|$|The Old Courthouse {{interior}} {{is composed of}} quadrants which are set apart by broad hallways which meet at the building's center. There they form a large, open three story rotunda. The rotunda is the dominating feature of the interior. It rises over 100 {{feet into the air}} and at the top features an allegorical painting representing peace and prosperity. The halls have mosaic floors and wall treatment composed of white marble dado which is capped with antique verde serpentine stone. Marbleized plaster, scagliola, panels complete the walls. The building's ceilings are decorated with plaster cornices and molded leaf and rosette compliments. The <b>Honduras</b> <b>mahogany</b> doors have a rail and panel design and beveled glass is used for decorative side lights and panels.|$|E
25|$|The wood {{used for}} the {{planking}} varies depending on where in the ship it is laid and what structural purpose it serves: The inner layer is Scots pine while the 6-inch skin is made of pitch pine, <b>Honduras</b> <b>mahogany</b> or oak. The outer hull is made of English Elm and Greenheart. Oak beams run across the hull forming three decks - the lower deck beams are 11inches (27.9cm) square in cross-section and are placed less than three feet (0.9m) apart along the ship's length. Seven transverse bulkheads, also of wood, provide additional strength and ensured that any flooding caused by ice damage would not flood the entire ship. To prevent damage from ice floes or crushing the two-blade propeller could be hoisted {{out of the way}} and the rudder could be easily detached and stored aboard. Iron-shod bows were severely raked so that when ramming the ice they would ride up over the margin and crush the ice with deadweight. The coal bunkers on each side contained a steel tank, each of which could hold 60 tons of fresh water. On the long ocean trip to and from New Zealand these tanks could hold additional coal but for the Antarctic voyage the extra water capacity was more important. The metal tanks also contributed to the strength of the lower hull around the boiler and engine spaces.|$|E

50|$|Much of the first-quality {{furniture}} {{made in the}} American colonies {{from the}} mid 18th century was made of mahogany, when the wood first became available to American craftsmen.

40|$|<b>Honduras</b> or bigleaf <b>mahogany</b> (Swietenia macrophylla King) is {{the most}} commercially {{important}} timber species in the Neotropics, but it often does not regenerate successfully after harvesting. Effective methods are needed to sustain mahogany yields by increasing regeneration. This study evaluates the effects of three treatments (slash, fell and burn; slash, fell and leave; and uprooting and pushing away trees using machines) used to open 0. 5 ha clearings, plus a control under the forest canopy, and two sowing methods (surface-sown seed and buried seed) on the germination, establishment, survival, and early growth of mahogany. After 10 months, significantly more buried seeds yielded established seedlings (20 %) than surface-sown seeds (9 %), {{but there were no}} significant differences among clearing treatments. Establishment on control averaged 18 %. The percentage of seedlings that survived from 10 to 49 months varied significantly among treatments, from 53 to 54 %, respectively, on the slash and burn and machine-cleared treatments to 16 % on the fell and leave treatment and 26 % on controls. Both slash and burn and machine-clearing reduced sprouting as compared to the fell and leave treatment, which had abundant sprouting from stumps of other species and the lowest establishment and survival of mahogany. Low survival on controls was probably due to low light levels. Fory-nine months after sowing, an average of 12 % of the seeds buried in the slash and burn and machine-cleared treatments were represented by live seedlings, a rate substantially higher than on the fell and leave treatment (350 and the control (6 % 0. Yield from buried seeds averaged 9 % as compared to 4 % from survace-sown seeds. Seedling height at 49 months (average= 66 em) did not differ significantly among the clearing treatments or sowing methods, but on control plots average height of the few surviving seedlings was only 27 cm. The traditional slash and burn practice used for agricultural clearing seems to be a good way to prepare sites for seeding with mahogany and could be used as a silvicultural technique to facilitate regeneration. Consideration should be given to integrating these systems into forest management to help assure continued production of mahogany...|$|R

60|$|The {{house was}} a genuine old house of a very quaint description, teeming with old carvings, and beams, and panels, and having an {{excellent}} old staircase, with a gallery or upper staircase, cut off from it by a curious fence-work of old oak, or of the old <b>Honduras</b> <b>Mahogany</b> wood. It was, and is, and will be, for many a long year to come, a remarkably picturesque house; and a certain grave mystery lurking in {{the depth of the}} old mahogany panels, as if they were so many deep pools of dark water--such, indeed, as they had been much among when they were trees--gave it a very mysterious character after nightfall.|$|E
60|$|It is Mr. Goodchild's opinion, that if {{a visitor}} on his arrival at Lancaster could be {{accommodated}} with a pole which would push {{the opposite side of}} the street some yards farther off, it would be better for all parties. Protesting against being required to live in a trench, and obliged to speculate all day upon what the people can possibly be doing within a mysterious opposite window, which is a shop-window to look at, but not a shop-window in respect of its offering nothing for sale and declining to give any account whatever of itself, Mr. Goodchild concedes Lancaster to be a pleasant place. A place dropped in the midst of a charming landscape, a place with a fine ancient fragment of castle, a place of lovely walks, a place possessing staid old houses richly fitted with old <b>Honduras</b> <b>mahogany,</b> which has grown so dark with time that it seems to have got something of a retrospective mirror-quality into itself, and to show the visitor, in the depth of its grain, through all its polish, the hue of the wretched slaves who groaned long ago under old Lancaster merchants. And Mr. Goodchild adds that the stones of Lancaster do sometimes whisper, even yet, of rich men passed away--upon whose great prosperity some of these old doorways frowned sullen in the brightest weather--that their slave- gain turned to curses, as the Arabian Wizard's money turned to leaves, and that no good ever came of it, even unto the third and fourth generations, until it was wasted and gone.|$|E

50|$|Conflict {{continued}} between Britain and Spain {{over the}} right of the British to cut logwood and to settle in the region.

The Spanish never settled in the region, however, and the British always returned to expand their trade and settlement. The 1763 Treaty of Paris conceded to Britain the right to cut logwood but asserted Spanish sovereignty over the territory. When war broke out again in 1779, the British settlement was abandoned until the Treaty of Versailles in 1783 allowed the British to again cut logwood in the area.
