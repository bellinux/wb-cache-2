The Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees not only, it {{is argued}} in this paper, {{established}} the international refugee regime with a strong relation to human rights, but also {{laid the groundwork for}} the establishment <b>of</b> a <b>norm</b> <b>of</b> refugee protection as a standard of appropriate behaviour toward refugees. The paper aims to prove this first assertion by employing the Constructivist-based norm life-cycle theoretical framework advanced by Martha Finnemore and Kathryn Sikkink. This paper will show that a <b>norm</b> <b>of</b> refugee protection was established over time but that its tenets have increasingly been ignored by states thereby eroding the initial <b>norm</b> <b>of</b> refugee protection.
