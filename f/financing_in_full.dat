50|$|As {{a result}} of the letter, one hundred and twenty {{children}} were gathered together by Watson and taken to the coast at Monkseaton on 11 July 1891, a trip which was <b>financed</b> <b>in</b> <b>full</b> by Lunn. The trip was so successful that Watson decided to write a letter for publication in the Newcastle Chronicle, appealing to the general public to send funding for further trips to the seaside to help more needy children. The following year, 600 children were sent on trips to the seaside with money donated by the public. In 1893, the association was established and was named as ‘The Newcastle Poor Children’s Seaside Trips Association.’ The committee elected the founders, Lunn and Watson as Chairman and Hon Secretary respectively. Each summer between May and September, groups of children selected from the districts of Newcastle and Gateshead, continued to visit the coast.|$|R

30|$|Third, in {{parallel}} to housing, {{the provision of}} accessibility may consist of a market-led part and a ‘social’ part. Like {{in many of the}} models of housing provision, the former would be <b>financed</b> <b>in</b> <b>full</b> through user fees, in line with the self-financing theorem proposed in the economic literature on (toll) roads [48, 69]. Like in the housing sector, the ‘social’ part of the mobility sector would provide an alternative service for persons not able to purchase adequate levels of mobility and accessibility in the market. Like in the housing sector, these persons would possibly receive a lower quality (perhaps in terms of comfort or speed), but would be offered it at a reduced price, possibly through a combination of supply-side and demand-side subsidies. This model of provision would thus guarantee an adequate level of accessibility, while limiting direct government expenditure on transport, in analogy to the model dominant in the housing sector.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Beginning with [Johansen (1960) ], computable general {{equilibrium}} (CGE) {{models have}} been widely applied to study {{the impact of a}} variety of economic policy issues. These include changes in macroeconomic or regional economic policies such as tariff reductions, changes in labour force demographics and skill levels, the impact of epidemics and terrorist attacks, the impact of drought and water policy reform, and the economic costs of climate change mitigation (Dixon and Parmenter (1996); Dixon and Rimmer (2002); Adams (2007); Giesecke et al. (2015); Wittwer and Dixon (2015)). Despite the efficacy of CGE models as tools in policy analysis, key linkages between the real and financial economies are often treated implicitly; for example, the current account deficit is assumed to be <b>financed</b> <b>in</b> <b>full</b> by a foreign agent, e. g., via a small country assumption. In an explicit sense we may ask how the foreign investor chooses to finance a deficit, e. g., do they prefer to purchase domestic agent bonds, equity or {{a combination of the two}} instruments? What are the associated implications for relative rates-of-return across the suite of domestic financial instruments, and how do changes in relative returns impact domestic agent investment decisions, nominal exchange rates, and the real economy? This paper seeks to address such questions via the development of a theory of the financial sector for a traditional dynamic CGE model of the U. S. (USAGE 2. 0). We begin with a brief synopsis of the construction of a financial database for the United States (U. S.), which documents the stocks and transactional flows of 5 financial and nonfinancial instruments across 11 distinct agents. The financial database derived herein and the approach documented in Dixon et al. (2015), are then used to develop a new financial CGE model of the U. S. called USAGE 2 F. Explicit recognition of financial stocks and flows broadens the scope of CGE analyses to include the effects of changes in capital adequacy requirements of key financial agents, e. g., the commercial banks, as we illustrate with an example. The results are subsequently compared to findings of a similar policy scenario in Australia, which are outlined in Giesecke et al. (2016). This analysis serves to illustrate how the impacts of regulatory change (in this case, a rise in capital adequacy ratios) can be affected by jurisdiction-specific differences in the structure of the financial sector...|$|R

These issues are discussed and analysed by three students who have participated in a part-time programme of doctoral studies while embedded in their research context. But, one of the drawbacks of conducting a study such as this though is the contemporary lack of statistics on the actual dichotomy of provision between conventional and alternative modes of teaching in the higher education sector.

40|$|Although adverse {{selection}} {{is one of}} the main assumptions of contract theory, empirical papers find mixed evidence of its existence. Yet the existence of {{adverse selection}} is important because it {{is one of the}} main justifications for public intervention in areas such as insurance markets. In this paper we test for the existence of adverse selection in health insurance markets in a framework where a public health administration <b>finances</b> health care <b>in</b> <b>full</b> through income taxes and where individuals with private insurance may resort to an alternative source of care. In other words, privately funded and publicly funded care are, de facto, mutually exclusive; we refer to this setting as the "substitutes framework, " and test propositions from a theoretical model that incorporates the features of this framework. This distinction is important because the competitive equilibrium that arises within this framework has, to our knowledge, never been studied under either symmetric information or adverse selection. Previous literature has focused either on a "supplements framework, " where the private insurance is supplemental to the public one, or on one where the public insurance is absent, whic...|$|R
40|$|The {{mathematical}} model presented here is normative; {{the concern is}} not with predicting what will occur if the contemporary tendencies of mankind continue, but rather with sketching a way of arriving at the final goal of a world liberated from backwardness and misery. Any long-term forecast {{about the development of}} mankind is based on a view of the world rooted in a particular value system. By assuming that the structure of the contemporary world and the set of values which sustains it may be linearly projected toward the future, we are in fact taking a position. In this sense, the difference which is usually made between a projective and normative model is essentially fallacious. The idea of constructing this model springs from a meeting held in 1970 in Rio de Janeiro sponsored jointly by the Club of Rome and the Instituto Universitario de Pesquisas do Rio de Janeiro. The meeting analyzed and discussed the results of the World Model 111 which was constructed by the group headed by Meadows at the Sloan School of Management of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). As a result of the discusion of the basic assumptions of the World Model III, a group of Latin Americans attending the meeting decided to assign the Fundacion Bariloche of Argentina the work of constructing a world model that encorporated the views expressed at the meeting. A Committee was formed composed of Helio Jaguaribe, Carlos A. Mallmann, Enrique Oteiza, Jorge Sabato, Osvaldo Sunkel, Victor Urquidi, and Amilcar Herrera, which in September 1971 issued a paper giving in general terms the fundamental hypotheses and variables {{to be used in the}} Bariloche Model. This preliminary project was submitted to the annual meeting of the Consejo Latinoamericano de Ciencias Sociales (CLACSO), held in Buenos Aires in December 1971. In mid- 1971, a meeting was held at the Fundacion Bariloche, attended by the majority of the members of the Committee as well as by some of those who would later be involved as authors in the project. The meeting defined the essential features of the Model to be developed. The Committee appointed a Project Director, and entrusted him with the task of forming the group of specialists who would construct the model. In the final phase of the project Hugo Scolnik was appointed Co-Director of the project. While an individual author has reported on the main task assigned him, this in no way reflects the real participation that each had in the work. The hypotheses and basic philosophy of the model were the product of a long and difficult collective task, and it is almost impossible to distinguish the individual contributions. The initial group which gave rise to the project constituted itself thereafter into a Consulting Committee, with the mission of periodically carrying out a critical analysis of the progress of the work. Its criticisms and suggestions were a valuable contribution to the task performed. It is appropriate to point out that final responsibility for the ideas contained in the model is with the authors. An initial contribution was received from the Club of Rome to carry out a study on the project's feasibility. Thereafter, the execution of the project was <b>financed</b> <b>in</b> <b>full</b> by the International Development Research Centre (IDRC), Ottawa, Canada. The authors wish to express their gratitude to both institutions for the total academic freedom given them...|$|R

40|$|International {{airports}} {{are among the}} few examples of transport infrastructures which can well achieve self-financing. The growing interest of private companies in airport construction and operation is the visible testimony to this fact. However, the financing structures of {{airports are}} complex, involving not only traffic, passenger and goods handling, but also non-aviation services, such as retail, car parking or intermodal facilities. The integration of social marginal cost pricing schemes into this organizational structure according to the strategic plans of the European Commission, however, is challenging. This paper investigates whether they comply with a second strategic policy objective at European and national level, which is to foster public-private partnerships (PPPs) <b>in</b> transport <b>financing</b> <b>in</b> terms of <b>full</b> cost coverage, risks and incentives. The cases analysed in this paper deal with two sites with very different characteristics: Munich Airport which has been publicly operated since 1991 and the Bulgarian airports Varna and Burgas, which have been managed since 2007 by one concessionaire and whose planning and future development is being accomplished with private capital. The results of both cases showed that self-financing is possible in case congestion costs are considered in the SMCP schemes, and given that air traffic growth rates return to the significant levels prior to the economic crisis. The chapter will discuss the legal implications of congestion pricing at European airports which are violating current EC legislation, {{as well as the}} impact of alternative pricing schemes on the environmental performance and technological innovation in aviation.
