50|$|Continuous foam {{separation}} {{is one of}} two major modes of {{foam separation}} with the other being batch foam separation. The difference between the two modes is that in continuous mode, surfactant solution is continuously fed through a feed into the foam column and a solution, extracted of surfactant, is also continuously exiting the bottom of the apparatus. The figure to the right shows a diagram of a basic continuous <b>foam</b> <b>separator.</b> The process is stationary (or in steady state) as long as the volume of liquid is constant as a function of time. As long as the process is in steady state, the liquid will not overflow into the foaming column. Depending on the design of the <b>foam</b> <b>separator,</b> the location of the feed flowing in can vary from atop of the liquid solution {{to the top of the}} foam column.|$|E
50|$|Additional {{equipment}} {{on the basic}} form of a <b>foam</b> <b>separator</b> apparatus {{can be used to}} achieve other desired effects that suit the type of application, but the underlying process of separation remains the same. The addition of equipment is used to optimize the parameters, enrichment E, or recovery R. Typically, enrichment and recovery are opposing parameters, but there have been some recent studies showing the ability to simultaneously optimize both parameters. The variation of flow rates on the gas input as well as other equipment settings has effects on the optimization of the parameters. The table compares foam separation to other techniques used to separate the protein, Î±-lactalbumin, from a whey protein solution.|$|E
50|$|The {{creation}} of the foam starts with the flow of gas {{into the bottom of}} the liquid column. The amount of gas flow into the apparatus is measured and maintained through a flow meter. As the foam rises and becomes drained of the liquid, it gets diverted into a separate container to collect the foamate. The height of the foam column is dependent on the application. The diverted foam is liquefied by collapsing the foam bubbles. This can usually be achieved by mechanical means or by lowering the pressure in the foamate collecting vessel. <b>Foam</b> <b>separators</b> for different types of applications use the basic set up shown in the diagram, but can vary with placements and addition of equipment.|$|R
40|$|Problems {{associated}} with the use of compact cylindrical cyclone gas/liquid (CCGL) separators can be attributed to two physical phenomena: gas carry-under and liquid carryover (LCO). Inadequate understanding of the complex multiphase hydrodynamic flow pattern inside the cylindrical separator has inhibited complete confidence in its design and use, hence the need for more research. While many works have been done with a fixed inlet slot to predict the operational efficiency of the cyclone separator, very little is known about how separator performance can be influenced due to changes in fluid properties. During the operations of the CCGL separator the complex flow situations arising from severe <b>foaming</b> within the <b>separator</b> has not been addressed. Also the effects of emulsion formation under three phase flow conditions on the properties of cyclone separators are yet to be studied. An understanding of liquid holdup and hydrodynamic nature of flow in a compact separator under zero net liquid flow (ZNLF) and zero net gas flow (ZNGF) conditions is necessary in many field applications, especially for the prediction of LCO and in the design of the CCGL separators. Also, ZNLF holdup is an important parameter in predicting bottom-hole pressures in pumping oil wells. This research investigated the effects of fluid properties such as density, foam and emulsion formation on ZNLF, zero net gas flow ZNGF, and LCO in compact cyclone separators; this was achieved by replacing water, which is the conventional fluid used as the liquid medium in many previous research efforts with a foamy oil while maintaining air as the gas phase. Variable-inlet-slots that regulate the artificial gravity environment created by the separator were used to check for improved separator performance. Also experiments to check separator response to a range of water-cut in three-phase flow were performed. All experiments were carried out under low constant separator pressures. The ZNLF holdup is observed to decrease as the density of the fluid medium decreases. Varying the inlet slot configurations and recombination points does not have any effect on the ZNLF holdup when changes in density of the liquid phase occur. Comparisons with previous work show that there exists a wide variation in the LCO operational envelope when severe foaming occurs in the CCGL separator. At high watercut (greater than 30 %), the separator LCO performance was observed to be normal. However, at water-cut below 30 %, LCO was initiated much earlier; this is attributed to severe foaming in the CCGL separator...|$|R
40|$|Oil-air {{separation}} {{is a key}} function in aero engines with closed-loop oil systems. Aero-engine separators are employed to separate oil from air before being released overboard. Typically, these devices make use of a porous medium such as an open-cell metal foam, {{in order to enhance}} oil separation. Although quite scarce, there has been some research aimed at developing a suitable modelling framework for aero-engine separators. However, numerical modelling of the air/oil flow through the open-cell metal foams employed in aero-engine separators has never been properly addressed. This thesis presents the development of a pore-scale numerical modelling approach to determine the transport properties of fluid flow through open-cell metal foams. Micro-computer tomography scans were used to generate 3 D digital representations of several commercial open-cell metal foams. A code was developed in Matlab to render the CT images into 3 D volumes and perform morphological measurements on the samples. Subsequently, conventional finite volume simulations are carried out in order to obtain the airflow and compute the pressure gradient across the investigated samples. Simulations were performed {{for a wide range of}} Reynolds numbers and the feasibility of using Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) turbulence models is investigated. Validation was done by comparing the pore-scale pressure gradient results against experimental measurements. Further simulations were carried out to isolate and analyse particular effects in more detail, such as wall and entrance effects, fluid compressibility, time-dependent flow features, anisotropy of the foam structure and the impact of porosity and surface area on the pressure gradient. The oil phase within aero-engine separators has the form of disperse droplets. Thus, the oil phase in the pore-scale simulations was modelled using a Lagrangian particle tracking approach. Lagrangian simulations were run in steady state and one-way coupled, due to the low mass fraction of oil normally present within aero-engine separators Converged airflow pore-scale solutions were employed as the base flow for the Lagrangian tracking approach. A simplified oil capture criterion assumed the droplet trajectory to be terminated upon collision against the foam solid ligaments. The focus of the present work was on separation of small droplets with a diameter smaller than 10 microns. Hence, a series of calculations were performed using a representative droplet diameter range, and multiple flow velocities. The outcome of such approach was a qualitative evaluation of the oil separation effectiveness for several commercial open-cell metal foams under a representative range of flow regimes. Furthermore, rotational effects which are experienced by the metal <b>foams</b> within aero-engine <b>separators</b> were modelled using a moving frame of reference (MRF) approach. Finally, a methodology for upscaling the results obtained by the detailed pore-scale simulations into a simple macroscopic porous medium model is described, showing promising results. One of the aims of this work was to develop a numerical modelling framework able to provide an accurate representation of the airflow and a qualitative assessment of the oil capture within aero-engine separators. The feasibility of using the current state-of-the-art modelling framework is assessed. The separator design and geometry are based on the oil separation test rig located at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). Experimental measurements of the overall pressure drop and oil capture performed at KIT are used to validate the simulations. The methodology presented here overcomes some limitations and simplifications present in previous similar studies. The upscaled macroscopic porous medium model was applied to full aero-engine separator CFD simulations. Experiments and simulations were conducted for three different separator configurations, one without a metal foam, and two with metal foams of different pore sizes. For each configuration, a variation of air flow, shaft rotational speed and droplet size was conducted. The focus was on the separation of droplets with a diameter smaller than 10 m. Single-phase air flow simulation results showed that overall pressure drop increases with both increased shaft speed and air flow, largely in agreement with the experiments. Oil capture results proved to be more difficult to be captured by the numerical model and indicate that droplet re-atomization might play a significant role in the oil separation phenomena. Re-atomization, droplet-droplet collisions and droplet breakup were not considered at the present stage, but could be subject of future work. The modelling framework described here should not be seen as a definite answer but as an improvement upon the current state-of-the-art methodology, providing important lessons and recommendations for future work on aero-engine separators...|$|R
