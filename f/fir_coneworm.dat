50|$|Dioryctria abietivorella, the <b>fir</b> <b>coneworm,</b> is {{a species}} of snout moth in the genus Dioryctria. It was {{described}} by Augustus Radcliffe Grote in 1878, and is found in North America from southern Canada south to California {{in the west and}} North Carolina in the east.|$|E
40|$|The impacts {{and timing}} of insect {{infestation}} were determined in developing Engelmann spruce cones throughout the summer of a year of low cone production in northern Utah. The major insects found were the western spruce budworm, Choristoneura occidentalis Freeman (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae); <b>fir</b> <b>coneworm,</b> Dioryctria abietivorella Grote (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae); and the spruce seed moth, Laseyresia youngana Kearfott (Lepidoptera: Olethreutidae). Insects reduced the survival of cones to 11. 48 cones out of 100. The high percentage of seeds and cones lost to insect predation supported previous studies of a similar nature...|$|E
40|$|Whitebark pine, Pinus albicaulis Engelm. is an {{important}} but declining high-elevation tree species in western forests. Regeneration of this species has been difficult {{and the impact of}} cone and seed insects unknown. Seven sites selected from the geographical range of whitebark pine in Idaho, Montana, Washington, Oregon, and California were examined for cone and seed insects and their impact. Ten different insect species were found affecting various reproductive structures of whitebark pine. Insects having the greatest impact across most sites were <b>fir</b> <b>coneworm</b> (Dioryctria abietivorella (Grote)) and western conifer seed bug (Leptoglossus occidentalis Heidemann). Coneworms infested up to 68 % of cones collected, destroying up to 13 % of the seed • extracted. Seed bugs damaged up to 27 % of the seeds. Pheromone traps for the ponderosa pine cone beetle (Conophthorus ponderosae Hopkins) and coneworms were tested. Ponderosa pine cone beetles were trapped at three of seven sites. Coneworms were trapped at two sites where pheromone traps were deployed. Further studies incorporating different cone crop levels of whitebark pine and other associated tree species are needed to fully determine the effect of cone and seed insects on whitebark pine seed and reproduction...|$|E
40|$|Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii Parry ex Engelm.) {{exhibits}} cone crop periodicity, producing seed in a cyclic pattern. Variation in {{seed production}} {{has been noted}} between individuals of a population, but synchronization {{on a large scale}} is common. The theory that ultimately these periodic large cone crops have resulted from the selective pressures of seed and cone predators, referred to as the predator satiation hypothesis, is considered. Assuming predator pressures have operated over evolutionary time to select for periodic synchrony, associations between seed and cone predators and cone crop production levels were anticipated. These potential consequences of predator satiation were examined. Long-term data from 1948 to 1970 of Engelmann spruce cone production levels and small mammal populations, estimated from trappings, were analyzed for positive associations. Three small mammal categories, mice (Peromyscus spp.), chipmunks (Eutamias spp.) and red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) were examined. Only the correlation coefficient between population indices for mice and cone crop production was found to be significant. Engelmann spruce cones were collected throughout the summer of a year of low cone production. The impacts and timing of insect infestation were determined in developing cones. The major insects found were western spruce budworm (Choristoneura occidentalis (Freeman) (Lepidoptera: Torticidae)), <b>fir</b> <b>coneworm</b> (Dioryctria abietvorella (Grote) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae)), and spruce seed moth (Laspeyresia younqana (Kearfott) (Lepidoptera: Olethreutidae)). Insects reduced the survival of cones to 11. 48 cones out of 100. The high percentage of seeds and cones lost to insect predation supported previous studies of a similar nature. Both studies examined the potential consequences of the predator satiation hypothesis which has been suggested as an adaptive mechanism for trees to avoid seed and cone predation...|$|E
40|$|Many insects exploit {{sections}} {{of the electromagnetic spectrum}} as foraging or attraction cues, detecting wavelengths in the ultraviolet (UV; ~ 300 – 400 nm), human visible (400 – 750 nm) and infrared (> 750 nm) range. Two distinct types of receptors are involved. Compound eyes in the head detect UV and human visible light, and IR receptors on the thorax or abdomen detect radiant IR which contrasts against the background and is therefore dectable. I investigated the potential use of electromagnetic foraging cues in three members of the conophagous insect guild: the diurnal Western conifer seed bug, Leptoglossus occidentalis Heidermann (Hemiptera: Coreidae), the nocturnal <b>fir</b> <b>coneworm</b> moth, Dioryctria abietivorella Groté (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), and the diurnal Douglas-fir cone gall midge, Contarinia oregonensis Foote (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae). In electrophysiological recordings, two-choice laboratory bioassays, and field trapping experiments, I tested the hypotheses that during (cone) foraging C. oregonensis, D. abietivorella and L. occidentalis (1) rely on IR receptors that receive and respond to cone-derived radiant IR, (2) receive and respond to cone or plant-derived colour cues, and (3) integrate radiant IR and insect visible light cues. My data support these hypotheses, at least in part. Male and female L. occidentalis were more attracted to radiant IR from heat sources within but not outside the natural cone temperature range. Male and female D. abietivorella have IR receptors on their ventral prothorax which help them detect and discriminate between IR stimuli. Both D. abietivorella and C. oregonensis are attracted to warm objects with IR signatures resembling or corresponding to those of tree branches but not those of cones. No insects oriented towards cone-reflected light as a singular foraging cue, but mated female L. occidentalis preferred the complete light spectrum of conifer needles (their oviposition site) to a narrow bandwidth of visible light. Visible (blue) light combined with radiant IR from a 40 ºC heat source were synergistic in attracting female L. occidentalis, indicating that the central nervous system of L. occidentalis is capable of processing and integrating information from compound eyes and IR receptors. Such integration of visible stimuli and IR was previously known only in viperid snakes...|$|E
