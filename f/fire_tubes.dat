2500|$|In 1358 at the Siege of Shaoxing the {{defenders}} [...] "used ... <b>fire</b> <b>tubes</b> {{to attack the}} enemy's advance guard" [...] against Ming. The siege was won by {{the defenders}}, whose [...] "fire tubes went off all at once, and the [...] great army could not stand against them and had to withdraw." [...] Ming began fielding cannons in greater proportions during the Siege of Suzhou in 1366, but they were relatively small and were used primarily for killing human beings rather than creating a breech in the city's defensive fortifications. Suzhou's fortifications were previously rebuilt in 1352 and contemporary documents of the city wall record a width of eleven meters at the base, five meters at the top, seven meters high, and seventeen kilometers all around. The walls were constructed using tamped earth covered with brick and sloped from bottom to top. Ming commander Xu Da ordered the army {{to set up a}} blockade. Watchtowers 13 meters high were constructed, which the Ming Veritable Records notes [...] "were placed bows and guns." [...] Each of the 48 Ming divisions (衛) were equipped with 50 large and small [...] "general tubes" [...] (大小將軍筒) for a total of 2400 guns, and besieged the city. Large ones weighed only 80 kilograms or less and the majority were small ones which weighed a couple kilograms at most. The largest possibly a meter long with a muzzle diameter of 21 centimeters, but these would have been rare exceptions in the early Ming arsenal. The lack of larger siege weapons in China unlike {{the rest of the world}} where cannons grew larger and more potent has been attributed to the immense thickness of traditional Chinese walls, which Tonio Andrade suggests provided no incentive for creating larger cannons, since even industrial artillery had trouble overcoming them. Chinese walls during the Ming period continued the traditional building practices and nearly every prefectural and provincial capital was fortified with walls between 10 and 20 meters thick at the base and 5 to 10 meters wide at the top.|$|E
40|$|<b>Fire</b> <b>tube</b> boiler is a {{one type}} of boiler.

Sometimes <b>fired</b> <b>tube</b> boiler is called as a smoke tube boiler or shell boiler. A <b>fired</b> <b>tube</b> boiler is use for production of steam.

50|$|By {{the late}} 19th century, when metallurgists {{were able to}} better {{understand}} what properties and processes made good iron, it was being displaced by steel. Also, the old cylindrical boilers with <b>fire</b> <b>tubes</b> were displaced by water tube boilers, which are inherently safer.|$|E
50|$|Fire-tube boilers {{sometimes}} have water-tubes as well, {{to increase the}} heating surface. A Cornish boiler may have several water-tubes across {{the diameter of the}} flue (this is common in steam launches). A locomotive boiler with a wide firebox may have arch tubes or thermic syphons. As firebox technology developed, it was found that placing a baffle of firebricks (heat-resistant bricks) inside the firebox to direct the flow of hot flue gasses up into the top of the firebox before it flowed into the <b>fire</b> <b>tubes</b> increased efficiency by equalizing the heat between upper and lower <b>fire</b> <b>tubes.</b> To hold these in place, a metal bracket was used, but to prevent these brackets from burning and eroding away they were built as water tubes, with cool water {{from the bottom of the}} boiler moving upwards by convection as it heated, and carrying the heat away before the metal reached its failure temperature.|$|E
50|$|Package boilers are {{commonly}} called water or <b>fire</b> <b>tube</b> Boilers. Water tube boilers use convection heating, which draws {{the heat from}} the fire source, and passes against the generating tubes of the boiler, causing water inside those tubes to boil off into steam. The <b>fire</b> <b>tube</b> boiler arrangement utilizes conduction heating which transfers heat from physical contact. <b>Fire</b> <b>tube</b> boilers are not commonly used due to their method of conduction heating because pipes in direct contact with fire and cold water could damage the pipes. The package boiler is usually a two or three-pass fire-tube boiler with an internal furnace tube. This is similar to the much earlier Scotch boiler.|$|R

50|$|It is {{generally}} perceived that it arose out {{of attempts to}} match the power of broad gauge locomotives within {{the limitations of the}} standard gauge of Stephenson railways. However, the patent originally arose from a problem which became apparent as trains travelled longer distances, specifically on the North Midland Railway in England around 1841, where <b>fire</b> <b>tubes</b> and smokeboxes were becoming destroyed by the heat.|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} of the Class 15, it was still early days for water {{treatment}} and enough trouble was experienced to result in their steel fireboxes being replaced with copper fireboxes. The locomotive's one flaw was excessively long <b>fire</b> <b>tubes.</b> On later models like the Class 15A, Hendrie improved the boiler by adding a combustion chamber, which shortened the distance between tube plates from 21 ft to 19 ft.|$|E

5000|$|When a {{pressurized}} container {{such as the}} waterside of a steam boiler ruptures, it is always followed by some degree of steam explosion. A common operating temperature and pressure for a marine boiler is around 950 P.S.I. (6.55 MPa) and 850 °F (454 °C) at the outlet of the superheater. A steam boiler has an interface of steam and water in the steam drum, {{which is where the}} water is finally evaporating due to the heat input, usually oil-fired burners. When a water tube fails due to any of a variety of reasons, it causes the water in the boiler to expand out of the opening into the furnace area that is only a few P.S.I. above atmospheric pressure. This will likely extinguish all fires and expands over the large surface area {{on the sides of the}} boiler. To decrease the likelihood of a devastating explosion, boilers have gone from the [...] "fire-tube" [...] designs, where the heat was added by passing hot gases through tubes in a body of water, to [...] "water-tube" [...] boilers that have the water inside of the tubes and the furnace area is around the tubes. Old [...] "fire-tube" [...] boilers often failed due to poor build quality or lack of maintenance (such as corrosion of the <b>fire</b> <b>tubes,</b> or fatigue of the boiler shell due to constant expansion and contraction). A failure of <b>fire</b> <b>tubes</b> forces large volumes of high pressure, high temperature steam back down the <b>fire</b> <b>tubes</b> in a fraction of a second and often blows the burners off the front of the boiler, whereas a failure of the pressure vessel surrounding the water would lead to a full and entire evacuation of the boiler's contents in a large steam explosion. On a marine boiler, this would certainly destroy the ship's propulsion plant and possibly the corresponding end of the ship.|$|E
50|$|Soon {{after the}} power of the steam blast was {{discovered}} it became apparent that a smokebox was needed beneath the chimney, to provide a space in which the exhaust gases emerging from the boiler tubes can mix with the steam. This had the added advantage of allowing access to collect the ash drawn through the <b>fire</b> <b>tubes</b> by the draught. The blastpipe, from which steam is emitted, was mounted directly beneath the chimney {{at the bottom of the}} smokebox.|$|E
50|$|The {{predecessor}} Class 15 locomotives had one flaw, their excessively long <b>fire</b> <b>tubes.</b> When more locomotives of {{the type}} were ordered, Hendrie improved the boiler by adding a combustion chamber in the firebox, which shortened the distance between tube plates from 21 ft to 19 ft. When the first five of these redesigned locomotives were delivered in 1914, they were designated Class 15A. Altogether 119 were ultimately built in ten batches by three manufacturers. Being wartime, initial production and delivery occurred in dribs and drabs.|$|E

50|$|In the locomotive-type boiler, fuel is {{burnt in}} a firebox to produce hot {{combustion}} gases. The firebox {{is surrounded by}} a cooling jacket of water connected to the long, cylindrical boiler shell. The hot gases are directed along a series of <b>fire</b> <b>tubes,</b> or flues, that penetrate the boiler and heat the water thereby generating saturated ("wet") steam. The steam rises to the highest point of the boiler, the steam dome, where it is collected. The dome is the site of the regulator that controls the exit of steam from the boiler.|$|E

5000|$|This type of boiler {{was used}} on {{virtually}} all steam locomotives in the horizontal [...] "locomotive" [...] form.

This firebox has an open base to provide a large grate area and often extends beyond the cylindrical barrel to form a rectangular or tapered enclosure. The horizontal fire-tube boiler is also typical of marine applications, using the Scotch boiler. Vertical boilers have also been built of the multiple fire-tube type, although these are comparatively rare; most vertical boilers were either flued, or with cross water-tubes.|$|E
50|$|At {{the western}} end of the site is the pump house. It houses the 1861 engine which was built by Easton and Amos of London, to a design {{patented}} in 1858 by Charles Amos.

A similar engine was on display at The Great Exhibition of 1851 and was shown to be able to lift 100 tons of water per minute, to a height of 6 ft.

50|$|In 1830 {{he invented}} an early form of storage room heater.

50|$|Unless the {{autoclave}} uses steam injection, {{the circulation}} fan carries {{the burden of}} assuring temperature uniformity throughout the working chamber.

50|$|In about 1812, Trevithick {{designed}} the ‘Cornish boiler’. These were horizontal, cylindrical boilers {{with a single}} internal <b>fire</b> <b>tube</b> or flue passing horizontally through the middle. Hot exhaust gases from the fire passed through the flue thus increasing the surface area heating the water and improving efficiency. These types were installed in the Boulton and Watt pumping engines at Dolcoath and more than doubled their efficiency.|$|R
