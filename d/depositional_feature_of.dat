The color and amount of the sediment deposited also varies depeding upon the season; summer deposits typically have larger volumes of deposition and are characterized as being light, whereas winter deposits are usually the opposite. Winter deposits are fairly uncommon because the water is froven into ice again.|$|E

The excellent quality of the core obtained by electro-mechanical drill {{makes it possible to}} examine the environmental condition of snow deposition by conducting combined physical and chemical core analyses. Preliminary studies were carried out on visual stratigraphy, bulk density and electric DC conductivity on the core surface. The results obtained show that the average interval of ice layer/crust and DC conductivity cycle are 11 and 10 cm of ice respectively. Bulk density data were treated so as to have the best-fit of the firnification equation (M. M. HERRON and C. C. LANGWAY, JR. : J. Glaciol., 25, 373, 1980) with data points under measured surface density of 0. 38 g/(cm) ^ 3 and mean annual temperature of - 40 ℃, which resulted in the accumulation rate of 10 cm of ice/a. These values are significantly higher than the accumulation rate of 6 to 7 cm of ice/a measured by stakes in the field (F. NISHIO et al. : JARE Data Rep., 137, 49, 1988).

40|$|Turbidity {{currents}} are turbulent particle suspensions {{that are}} the primary mechanism for transporting terrestrial sediments to the deep marine, and generate some <b>of</b> the largest <b>depositional</b> <b>features</b> on Earth. However the fluid-particle interactions that sustain these currents are poorly understood, principally due to the technical challenges posed by obtaining accurate velocity and density measurements, which are critical for describing flow behavior and depositional characteristics. Numerous studies have bypassed these issues by using saline density currents, but this negates the ability to link flow processes with <b>depositional</b> <b>features,</b> and {{it is unclear whether}} their density structures are representative of particle gravity flows. Consequently, numerous questions remain over the flow conditions that build up {{a significant part of the}} deep-marine geologic record. In this thesis I reports on the flow processes and <b>depositional</b> <b>features</b> <b>of</b> sediment-gravity currents across a broad range of particle sizes and concentrations. The technical challenges of obtaining reliable density data are overcome by running the experimental flows through a medical grade computed tomography (CT) scanner, and pair this data with three-dimensional velocity measurements using an ultrasonic Doppler velocity profiler (UDVP- 3 D) to get one of the first glimpses of the internal structure of turbidity currents. Unlike previous studies where flow processes are described in terms of the velocity field, this thesis demonstrates that fluid-particle interactions are controlled by momentum characteristics, and that the velocity field is determined largely by the current’s density structure. Moreover, the density structure also exerts a first order control on the morphology of their deposits...|$|R

An attempt is made to rate the experimental flows according to the classification of flow regimes based on threshold values of dimensionless Bagnold, Savage and Friction numbers. As a conclusion the experimental results highlight a threshold behaviour of debris-flow mixtures in the runout phase. This results from a particular combination of maximum grain diameters in play and a volumetric concentration limit.

The simulations allowed an accurate analysis of the seismic expressions of the two sections.

These lenses meet together on an erosion surface, while they thin and vanish in the other direction. The fluvial complex is fonned by a limestone basement overlain by coarse alluvial plain sediments which in turn are transgressed by finer flood plain sediments, including sandstone lenses stacking towards the top in a meandering belt. These lithofacies associations represent potential multi-pool reservoirs in which the mudstone layers constitute the plugs.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to clear the effect of geomorphological balance on devastated stream beds by the geomorphological {{analysis}} <b>of</b> <b>depositional</b> <b>features.</b> Qualitative zoning and observing the transformation of terraces show that terraces are not composed of the sediment with a single stroke of debris flow but of the gathering of many transformable units with sedimentation and scour on small scale. <b>Depositional</b> <b>features</b> <b>of</b> devastated stream beds can be characterized by the cross sectional area of the sedimentary load per unit stream width, i. e. the average depth of sediment. The average depth is considered to be an indicator of frequency of sedimentation and/or an indicator of sediment instability. A stream channel is divided into sections where the average depth increases (sedimentary sections) and sections where it decreases (scouring sections). The lengths of sedimentary sections (L) and scouring sections (Len) are respectively measured along stream course. The results are as follows : It was found that, after external factor-e. g. debris flow from a branch stream-induced an episodic geomorphic change, the ratio of L,,/L,, tends to approach a constant value in a reach of stream course. It is considered that the ratio value and the reach length reflect the level and the power of the constant shifting of balance. At devastated stream beds, the re-distribution of sediment does not lead to the uniform depth of sediment, but to the balanced sequence of sedimentary and scouring sections. The constant value for the ratio (Ld,/L,,) observed in a reach must be caused by the constant shifting of sediment balance on devastated stream beds...|$|R

The 2700 Ma metasedimentary manganiferous formation is underlain by stromatolitic limestone/dolomite and quartzite/arenite and also occurs within the former. The older quartzite/arenite, which contains redox-sensitive detrital pyrite and uraninite as well as thucolite, indicates sedimentation under anoxic to oxic transitional palaeoenvironmental condition, whereas the younger stromatolitic limestone/dolomite indicates development of oxygen in the depositional environment. The manganese ore types have been classified into three categories, {{one of which is}} a Mn-rich duricrust once capping the Late Archean manganiferous formation. It formed during a Cenozoic lateritic weathering event and was eroded in response to crustal uplift. Perhaps uniquely, clastic deposits of the eroded Mn-duricrust occur in mineable quantities in the form of fluvial palaeochannel fills. These cryptomelane-rich supergene ores are also suitable for radiometric dating. Knowing their age would help to constrain the timing of Mn-duricrust formation and, indirectly, the regional weathering event responsible for the extensive laterite occurrences of southern India.

We studied <b>depositional</b> <b>features</b> <b>of</b> the IOT at Cape Pakarang (SW Thailand) and used them as a reference for potential palaeoevents in the sedimentary record. Amongst others the 2004 tsunami left a sheet of sand commonly several centimeters thick in the coastal plain and dislocated boulders of up to 20 t. For the impact of potential palaeotsunamis we found two indicators: (1) the sediments of the coastal plain were sampled by means of vibra coring. We identified two allochthonous event layers, a homogeneous sandcap embedded in the deposits of a lagoon and a sheet of coral fragments, surrounded by shallow marine sand. For both, radiocarbon dating suggests an age of ca. 1100 cal BP. Due to correlation with contemporaneous palaeotsunami evidence from Northern Sumatra, India and Sri Lanka, the two event layers are interpreted as deposits of an 1100 year old palaeotsunami. (2) Dating 10 coral boulders on the reef platform produced 14 C-age estimates between 4500 and 5300 cal BP, with two clusters at 5200 and 4700 cal BP.

Rockfall debris is subjected to efficient salt weathering and quickly disintegrates into easily transported fine-grained material which, redistributed by surface wash, builds the ramps.

As a result of the very successful first Mars Pathfinder Landing Site Workshop, the project has selected the Ares Vallis outflow channel in Chryse Planitia as the landing site. This location is where a large catastrophic outflow channel debouches into the northern lowlands. A second workshop and series of field trips, entitled Mars Pathfinder Landing Site Workshop 2 : Characteristics of the Ares Vallis Region and Field Trips in the Channeled Scabland, Washington, were held in Spokane and Moses Lake, Washington. The purpose of the workshop was to provide a focus for learning as much as possible about the Ares Vallis region on Mars before landing there. The rationale is that the more that can be learned about the general area prior to landing, the better scientists will be able interpret the observations made by the lander and rover and place them in the proper geologic context. The field trip included overflights and surface investigations of the Channeled Scabland (an Earth analog for the martian catastrophic outflow channels), focusing on areas particularly analogous to Ares Vallis and the landing site.

Therefore, the identification of soupy and mousse-like fabrics {{can be used as}} a proxy for the presence of gas hydrate in addition to other evidence, such as pore water freshening or anomalously cool temperature. We present here grain-size results, mineralogical composition and magnetic susceptibility data of soupy and mousse-like samples from the southern Hydrate Ridge (Cascadia accretionary complex) acquired during Leg 204 of the Ocean Drilling Program. In order to study the relationship between sedimentary texture and the presence of gas hydrates, we have compared these results with the main textural and compositional data available from the same area. Most of the disturbed analyzed samples from the summit and the western flank of southern Hydrate Ridge show a mean grain size coarser than the average mean grain size of the hemipelagic samples from the same area. The <b>depositional</b> <b>features</b> <b>of</b> the sediments are not recognised due to disturbance. However, their granulometric statistical parameters and distribution curves, and magnetic susceptibility logs indicate that they correspond to a turbidite facies. These results suggest that gas hydrates in the southern Hydrate Ridge could form preferentially in coarser grain-size layers that could act as conduits feeding gas from below the BSR. Two samples from the uppermost metres near the seafloor at the summit of the southern Hydrate Ridge show a finer mean grain-size value than the average of hemipelagic samples. They were located where the highest amount of gas hydrates was detected, suggesting that in this area the availability of methane gas was high enough to generate gas hydrates, even within low-permeability layers.

This marks the contact between the Hyblean plateau and the Maghrebian thrust belt, {{as the result of}} the collision between the African foreland and the European southern margin during Tertiary times. The Catania Plain represents the easternmost Sicilian sector of the Quaternary foredeep basin. The present study attempts to reconstruct the Pleistocene to recent stratigraphic history of the Catania Plain foredeep basin. The utilised data set consists of several well log data compared with field observations conducted along the basin margins, where the oldest Quaternary successions crop out. Also, seismic off-shore data were considered in this study. The measurement of six geological cross-sections through the eastern sector of Catania Plain foredeep basin has pointed out the main <b>depositional</b> <b>features</b> <b>of</b> the Pleistocene-Holocene stratigraphic record. The results show that the sedimentary evolution of the Catania Plain foredeep basin is characterised by four main depositional sequences, with similar architecture relative to other foredeep basins in the central Apennines. These sequences are: (a) a marine muddy inner-shelf sequence (“Argille Marnose Grigio-Azzurre”, Auct.), up to 600 m thick, assigned to the Sicilian; (b) a sandy-gravelly shoreface sequence (“Sabbie e Ghiaie di S. Giorgio”, Auct.) of Mindell-Riss age; through an unconformity surface, also recognised by seismic off-shore data, this succession evolves to alluvial-marine gravelly deposits (c) of Tyrrhenian age (“Ghiaie e Conglomerati di Mt. Tiritì”, Auct.) characterised by a centripetal depositional trend. The Holocene record is closed at the top by a fourth depositional sequences (d) constituted by Simeto River and minor tributaries succession, represented by alluvial clay, sand and silt, with recent and present coastal sediments in the eastern part of the study area interbedded. The depocenters of the four depositional sequences migrated southward in time, along the sector of the Catania Plain. This migration was synchronous to propagation of the Gela Nappe thrust front, covered at present by the investigated sedimentary succession. The strong uplift ratio, estimated for the sector in 1. 4 mm/y starting from 330 ky BP, and sea-level variations during the Quaternary give the Catania Plain stratigraphic infill a quite complex foredeep multi-phase developed appearance...|$|R
40|$|The Shoalhaven-Illawarra Group {{boundary}} of the Late Permian southern Sydney Basin is poorly exposed in the Wollongong region. Consequently, geochemical and facies variations across the boundary are poorly understood. The lack of information has produced {{a gap in the}} understanding of the transition between the marine sedimentary rocks of the Broughton Formation and the non-marine Pheasants Nest Formation. An understanding of this transition would give the context for the changes leading to the deposition of the economically important Illawarra Coal Measures. Application of geochemistry (XRF), petrography (XRD, microscopy) and statistical methods (ANOVA, principal component analysis, cluster analysis), have been used to describe the palaeoenvironmental changes of the sequence and produce an evolutionary model. The study demonstrates that the deposition of the Pheasants Nest Formation was a result of the development of an extensive barrier complex {{during the time of the}} Shoalhaven-Illawarra Group boundary. Rapid sedimentation, consistent aggradation and a gradual regression in the underlying Broughton Formation aided barrier formation. This was predominately controlled by the amount of volcaniclastic sediment supplied from a northeast orientated volcanic chain that was located in the current offshore. Petrographic, geochemical and sedimentological analyses indicate that volcanic influence was persistent throughout the entire Broughton and Pheasants Nest Formation, with sporadic pulses of sediment accounting for increased Si, Ca, Fe and K concentrations. These sporadic pulses represent increased periods of volcanic activity distributing sediment into a shallow marine basin. Longshore currents (northeast trending) transported the detritus into the Wollongong area where it was deposited. Following the marine regression, fluvial processes operated on a coastal plain, passing laterally into a floodplain environment. Sediment was probably transported by seasonal meltwater floods. Statistical analyses (principal components, cluster analysis) reduced an extensive elemental data set (n = 162) into two main factors. The analyses reveal that the Broughton and Pheasants Nest Formations are strongly influenced by aluminosilicate and heavy mineral concentration. Heavy mineral concentrations are commonly used as a measure of sediment immaturity. In this case, the volcaniclastic detritus has undergone limited recycling and weathering. The <b>depositional</b> <b>features</b> <b>of</b> the Shoalhaven-Illawarra Group boundary are significant as it provides a coherent explanation for the deposition of the Pheasants Nest Formation; thus clarifying the palaeoenvironmental changes that led to coal formation in the Sydney Basin...|$|R

Previous work in the area of study has delineated several turbidite channel levee systems that are fed and has described in details qualitatively and quantitatively the most well illustrated <b>depositional</b> <b>features</b> in terms <b>of</b> interaction between the evolution of the depositional systems and the surrounding structures. This study is focused on the turbidite systems that have not been mentioned before or if they have been mentioned and they have not been described in details. The analysis of the data is based on the seismic interpretation of 3 D HR seismic data and the extraction of attribute maps that cover an area of 1400 km 2. Based on the attribute maps in combination with the seismic lines, qualitative and quantitative measurements took place for the main depositional elements of interesting, with the small scale lower submarine fan turbidite channel levee complexes to be the dominant sedimentary features in the area. The depositional system of the study consists of five different seismic Facies with Facies 1 : channel fill deposits (HAR's), Facies 2 : channel levee deposits, Facies 3 : mass transport deposits, Facies 4 : frontal splays or crevasse splay deposits (HARP's) and Facies 5 : hemipelagic or sheet like turbidite deposits. The oldest system consists of a channel system while the most recent <b>depositional</b> <b>feature</b> is a turbidite channel system which ends up to frontal splay deposits. Based on the observations from the interaction between the <b>depositional</b> <b>features</b> and the deformed structures in the study area four models were created and an attempt to interpret external factors that control the stratigraphy of the Syn-tectonic sequence such as sea-level flunctuations took place...|$|R
40|$|Carbonate breccias dissociated {{from their}} {{platform}} top counterparts are little studied despite their potential {{to reveal the}} nature of past shallow-water carbonate systems and the sequential alteration of such systems. A petrographic and stable isotopic study allowed evaluation of the sedimentological and diagenetic variability of the Cenozoic Batu Gading limestone breccia of Borneo. Sixteen lithofacies representing six facies groups have been identified mainly from the breccia clast {{on the basis of}} shared textural and compositional <b>features.</b> Clasts <b>of</b> the breccia are representative of shallow carbonate platform top and associated flank to basinal deposits. Dominant inputs are from rocky (karstic) shorelines or localised seagrass environments, coral patch reef and larger foraminiferal-rich deposits. Early, pre-brecciation alteration (including micritisation, rare dissolution of bioclasts, minor syntaxial overgrowth cementation, pervasive neomorphism and calcitisation of bioclasts and matrix) was mainly associated with marine fluids in a near surface to shallow burial environment. The final stages of pre-brecciation diagenesis include mechanical compaction and cementation of open porosity in a shallow to moderate depth burial environment. Post-brecciation diagenesis took place at increasingly moderate to deep burial depths under the influence of dominantly marine burial fluids. Extensive compaction, circum-clast dissolution seams and stylolites have resulted in a tightly fitted breccia fabric, with some development of fractures and calcite cements. A degree of facies-specific controls are evident for the pre-brecciation diagenesis. Pervasive mineralogical stabilisation and cementation have, however, led to a broad similarity <b>of</b> diagenetic <b>features</b> in the breccia clasts thereby effectively preserving <b>depositional</b> <b>features</b> <b>of</b> near-original platform top and margin environments. There is little intra-clast alteration overprint associated with subsequent clast reworking and post-brecciation diagenesis. The diagenetic-, and to an extent depositional- and clast-characteristics of the Batu Gading deposits are diagnostic of breccia origins. The predominance of: early and pervasive stabilisation of calcitic components, pervasive compaction resulting in a fitted texture, and paucity of meteoric dissolution or cementation effects are collectively all indicators of slope deposition and lithification. These features are comparable with other regional and global examples of submarine slope breccias, and consistent with the prior interpretation that the carbonate platform at Batu Gading developed in a rotating wedge-top basin (Wannier, 2009). The results of this study, along with regional analogues, suggest the potential for reworked carbonates debris in slope settings to be a viable way of investigating carbonate platform variability and their subsequent alteration in the absence of preserved platform top or margin deposits...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper was}} {{accepted}} for publication in Atlas of Submarine Glacial Landforms: Modern, Quaternary and Ancient. 2015 [URL] © Geological Society of London 2015 Prominent quasi-linear or lobate wedge-shaped depositional sedimentary landforms, termed grounding-zone wedges (GZWs), are distributed widely on polar continental shelves. They are regarded {{as a product of}} the deposition of mainly subglacially-transported sediment at the grounding-zone of modern and palaeo ice sheets and ice streams (e. g. Shipp et al. 1999; Ottesen et al. 2005; Horgan et al. 2013). GZWs vary in shape, dimensions and regional distribution across the continental shelf, where they can form single or multiple and widely- or closely-spaced <b>depositional</b> <b>features.</b> The presence <b>of</b> these landforms is used to delimit the maximum and retreat positions of former ice-sheet margins on high-latitude continental shelves (e. g. Shipp et al. 1999; Ottesen et al. 2005). During the Late Glacial transition, retreat of the Antarctic Peninsula Ice Sheet that covered the shelf of the NE Antarctic Peninsula during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) produced several distinctive grounding-zone landforms (Evans et al. 2005) ...|$|R
40|$|A seismic {{stratigraphy}} {{analysis was}} conducted at two sites, Hydrographers and Noggin passages, separated by about 540 km on the shelf-edge of the central Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia. We used recently available seismic and bathymetry data and a new synthesis of downhole logs and lithological, petrophysical and radiometric data from cores recovered by the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 325 (Great Barrier Reef Environmental Changes). We compared the stratigraphy of both sites, identifying a full depositional sequence with deposits from at least 28 ka BP to ~ 7 ka BP, bounded by two marine flooding surfaces. Within this sequence, each systems tract is represented by unique <b>depositional</b> <b>features</b> characteristic <b>of</b> the shelf-edge systems. Despite the broad environmental and geomorphic similarities between the two sites, differences in postglacial reef development were remarkable. These contrasts can be explained as a result of: (1) local antecedent substrate variations and (2) the interplay of shelf physiography with Late Quaternary sea level fluctuations, which favoured changes in biological production and sediment flux as the palaeo-shoreline evolved from linear to complex during intermediate sea levels. During these intermediate sea levels, the northern estuarine coast and its steep substrate at shelf-edge locations contrasted strongly with the protected palaeo-lagoons and the extensive, gentle marginal terraces found at the southern central GBR. This setting enhanced the regional differences in sediment transport and reef development through the last transgression. The conceptual model presented here provides a broader depositional framework and improves {{the understanding of the}} main processes controlling the spatial and temporal depositional patterns on the shelf-edge of mixed siliciclastic-carbonate margins...|$|R
40|$|Geologists {{working in}} {{offshore}} Brazil still vigorously debate the genetic origin of Cretaceous pre-salt lacustrine carbonates in the Santos Basin. Some carbonate petrologists have inferred that many <b>of</b> the macro-scale <b>depositional</b> <b>features</b> are <b>of</b> biological origin. Others contend that Brazilian pre-salt carbonate deposits are abiotic chemical precipitates formed in highly alkaline lakes. Each of these end-member paradigms has significant implications for how geologic models are constructed. To evaluate these genetic paradigms, detailed thin-section petrography (TSP), {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) were performed on thin sections and bulk core samples from well BM-S- 22 Guarani- 1 ST (3 -ESSO- 004 -SPS). The cored interval {{is characterized by a}} diverse boundstone assemblage including shrubs, spherulites, laminated sediments with abundant stevensite clay, domal and columnar stromatolites, oncoids, thrombolites, and travertine. In some boundstones, macro-scale structures and morphologies, such as crinkly-laminated stromatolites with centimeter-scale columnar relief, are highly suggestive of microbially-influenced sedimentation. SEM analyses of freshly broken core samples indicate that the columnar stromatolite/oncolite facies contains abundant evidence of fossilized microbes including microtubules, filaments, rods and molds that measure 1 – 2 μm in diameter and tens of μm in length. These features are similar in size and shape to modern and fossilized microbes. SEM observations coupled with geochemical evidence from within the various boundstone assemblages indicate that the influence of microbes on sedimentation within the Santos Basin is unequivocal. Although microscopic evidence does not illuminate the precise role microbes play within the basin (e. g., binding, trapping, baffling, or biostabilizing sediments) fossilized microbial features within the pre-salt suggest that depositional and reservoir models should account for their potential impact...|$|R
