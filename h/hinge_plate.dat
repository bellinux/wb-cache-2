5|$|The first {{axillary}} sclerite (lAx) is {{the anterior}} <b>hinge</b> <b>plate</b> {{of the wing}} base. Its anterior part is supported on the anterior notal wing process of the tergum (ANP); its posterior part articulates with the tergal margin.

The body of the sclerite articulates laterally with the second axillary. The second axillary sclerite (2Ax) is more variable in form than the first axillary, but its mechanical relations are no less definite. It is obliquely hinged to the outer margin of the body of the first axillary, and the radial vein (R) is always flexibly attached to its anterior end (d). The second axillary presents both a dorsal and a ventral sclerotization in the wing base; its ventral surface rests upon the fulcral wing process of the pleuron. The second axillary, therefore, is the pivotal sclerite of the wing base, and it specifically manipulates the radial vein.|$|E

Distally the third axillary is prolonged in a process which is always associated with the bases of the group of veins in the anal region of the wing here termed the vannal veins (V). The third axillary, therefore, is usually the posterior <b>hinge</b> <b>plate</b> of the wing base and is the active sclerite of the flexor mechanism, which directly manipulates the vannal veins. The contraction of the flexor muscle (D) revolves the third axillary on its mesal articulations (b, f) and thereby lifts its distal arm; this movement produces the flexion of the wing. The Fourth Axillary sclerite is not a constant element of the wing base. When present it is usually a small plate intervening between the third axillary and the posterior notal wing process and is probably a detached piece of the latter.|$|E

50|$|Clark then {{examined}} the prosecution history and prior art of {{both sets of}} patents involved in the case. In the Graham case, the '798 patent was originally rejected by the patent examiner as being insufficiently distinguished from the previous '811 patent. The only two claims which differed between the two patents were (1) the stirrup and the bolted connection of the shank to the <b>hinge</b> <b>plate</b> do not appear in '811; and (2) {{the position of the}} shank is reversed, being placed in patent '811 above the <b>hinge</b> <b>plate,</b> sandwiched between it and the upper plate. One argument which Graham raised before the court, but had not raised before the USPTO, was that in the new '798 design, the flexing of the plow shank was limited to the points between the spring clamp and the tip of the plow shank, absorbing the shock of hard objects on the ground more efficiently. The court rejected this argument and invalidated the '798 patent for two reasons: first, Graham had not raised this “flexing” argument before the USPTO, and second, the parts in the '798 patent served the same purposes as those in the prior art.|$|E

5000|$|The {{case was}} {{actually}} a set of consolidated appeals of two cases, originating in the same court and dealing with similar issues. The named petitioner, William T. Graham, had sued the John Deere Co. for patent infringement. The invention in question {{was a combination of}} old mechanical elements: a device designed to absorb shock from the shanks of chisel plows as they plow through rocky soil and thus to prevent damage to the plow. Graham sought to solve this problem by attaching the plow shanks to spring clamps, to allow them to flex freely underneath the frame of the plow. He applied for a patent on this clamp, and in 1950, obtained [...] (referred to by the Court as the '811 patent). Shortly thereafter, he made some improvements to the clamp design by placing the <b>hinge</b> <b>plate</b> beneath the plow shank rather than above it, in order to minimize the outward motion of the shank away from the plate. He applied for a patent on this improvement, which was granted in 1953 as [...] (referred to by the court as the '798 patent). While Graham’s patent had been upheld in a previous case before the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed the opinion of the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri and held that the patent was invalid and that the John Deere Co. had not infringed upon it.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Bracing {{elements}} and their connections {{have played a}} key role in the steel bracing frame energy dissipation through yielding and buckling. Whereas it is normally expected that gusset plates yield and buckle after that of bracing elements. Moreover, bracing elements buckling go with the plastic hinge formation in gusset plates. However, the geometry requirement to provide plastic hinge formation leads to larger and consequently thicker gusset plate. This article presents a research concerning steel bracing connection detail. In this proposed steel bracing connection, <b>Hinge</b> <b>Plate</b> manages the formation of the plastic hinge in the bracing connections. To verify the proposed idea a monotonic compression test was conducted on a bracing element; that was detailed with <b>Hinge</b> <b>Plate.</b> As a primary observational goal of the test, buckling mode of bracing element was depicted to be well managed by <b>Hinge</b> <b>Plate.</b> In addition, it was observed that the hierarchy of yielding in bracing element and then in <b>Hinge</b> <b>Plate</b> coincided with expected energy dissipation requirement in bracing frame...|$|E
