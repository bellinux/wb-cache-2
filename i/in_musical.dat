5|$|For Visitation of 1733, Bach revised his Magnificat, {{creating}} the version better known today. In that version, transposed to D major, the laudes interpolations were abandoned. Limited differences in instrumentation include replacing the recorders by flutes and including {{these in the}} tutti movements. Changes <b>in</b> <b>musical</b> texture were even smaller, mellowing the harmony {{near the end of}} the Omnes generationes movement being the most noticeable.|$|E
5|$|His compositions, {{particularly}} those of his later period, are notable for their complex textures, rich harmonies and orchestration, and the elaborate use of leitmotifs—musical phrases associated with individual characters, places, ideas, or plot elements. His advances <b>in</b> <b>musical</b> language, such as extreme chromaticism and quickly shifting tonal centres, greatly influenced the development of classical music. His Tristan und Isolde is sometimes described as marking the start of modern music.|$|E

5|$|Scholars {{agree that}} there are no {{completely}} reliable methods of determining the exact chronology of musical instruments across cultures. Comparing and organizing instruments based on their complexity is misleading, since advancements <b>in</b> <b>musical</b> instruments have sometimes reduced complexity. For example, construction of early slit drums involved felling and hollowing out large trees; later slit drums were made by opening bamboo stalks, a much simpler task.|$|E

5|$|According to musicologist Francis Maes, Rubinstein {{could not}} be accused of any lack of artistic integrity. He fought for change and {{progress}} <b>in</b> <b>musical</b> life in Russia. Only his musical tastes were conservative—from Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven to the early Romantics up to Chopin. Liszt and Wagner were not included. Neither did he welcome many ideas then new about music, including the role of nationalism in classical music. For Rubinstein, national music existed only in folk song and folk dance. There {{was no place for}} national music in larger works, especially not in opera. Rubinstein's public reaction to the attacks was simply not to react. His classes and concerts were well attended, so he felt no reply was actually necessary. He even forbade his students to take sides.|$|E
5|$|Animals is {{the tenth}} studio album by the English rock band Pink Floyd, {{released}} on 23 January 1977 by Harvest Records in the United Kingdom and by Columbia Records in the United States. It {{is a concept}} album that provides a scathing critique of the social-political conditions of late-1970s Britain, and presents a marked change <b>in</b> <b>musical</b> style from their earlier work. Animals was recorded at the band's studio, Britannia Row, in London, but its production was punctuated by the early signs of discord that three years later would culminate in keyboardist Richard Wright leaving the band. The album's cover image, a pig floating between two chimneys of the Battersea Power Station, was conceived by the band's bassist and lead songwriter Roger Waters, and was designed by long-time collaborator Storm Thorgerson of Hipgnosis.|$|E
5|$|At age 16 Mendelssohn {{wrote his}} String Octet in E-flat major, the first work which showed the full {{power of his}} genius. This Octet and his Overture to Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, which he wrote a year later in 1826, are the best-known of his early works. (Later, in 1842, he also wrote {{incidental}} music for the play, including the famous Wedding March.) The Overture is perhaps the earliest example of a concert overture– that is, a piece not written deliberately to accompany a staged performance, but to evoke a literary theme in performance on a concert platform; this was a genre which became a popular form <b>in</b> <b>musical</b> Romanticism.|$|E

5|$|Even {{among other}} festive music written by Bach, this work's scoring for four {{trumpets}} is unusual. It is characterised {{by a very}} solemn character and the attributes of courtly homage music, such as the opening chorus {{in the form of}} a French overture or fanfare-like trumpet interjections in the bass recitative. Bach created a work that <b>in</b> <b>musical</b> terms corresponds less to sacred music and more to the type of secular music for a princely court, as had been required of him during his time in office in Köthen. Only in its final two movements does Bach again use simple forms to emphasize the work's character of a church cantata, implying that earthly powers do not last, but God – the supreme ruler – is entitled to have the last word.|$|E
5|$|Following the Civil War, {{minstrel}} shows {{became the}} first distinctively American form of music expression. The minstrel show was an indigenous form of American entertainment consisting of comic skits, variety acts, dancing, and music, usually performed by white people in blackface. Minstrel shows used African American elements <b>in</b> <b>musical</b> performances, but only in simplified ways; storylines in the shows depicted blacks as natural-born slaves and fools, before eventually becoming associated with abolitionism. The minstrel show was invented by Daniel Decatur Emmett and the Virginia Minstrels. Minstrel shows produced the first well-remembered popular songwriters in American music history: Thomas D. Rice, Daniel Decatur Emmett, and, most famously, Stephen Foster. After minstrel shows' popularity faded, coon songs, a similar phenomenon, became popular.|$|E

5|$|Gaga grew up {{listening}} to artists such as the Beatles, Stevie Wonder, Queen, Bruce Springsteen, Pink Floyd, Mariah Carey, The Grateful Dead, Led Zeppelin, Whitney Houston, Elton John, Blondie, and Garbage, who have all influenced her music. Gaga's musical inspiration varies from dance-pop singers like Madonna and Michael Jackson to glam rock artists like David Bowie and Freddie Mercury, as well as the theatrics of the pop artist Andy Warhol and her own performance roots <b>in</b> <b>musical</b> theater. The singer has been compared to Madonna, who has said that she sees herself reflected in Gaga. Gaga says that she wants to revolutionize pop music like Madonna. Gaga has also cited heavy metal bands as an influence, including Iron Maiden and Black Sabbath. She credits Beyoncé as a key inspiration to pursue a musical career.|$|E

The band underwent many changes <b>in</b> <b>musical</b> style over its career, from folk music to progressive {{rock in the}} 1970s, before moving towards pop {{at the end of}} the decade.
