25|$|At 09:11 local time, {{the terrorists}} arrived at Beslan in a GAZelle police van and a GAZ-66 {{military}} truck. Many witnesses and independent experts {{claim that there}} were, in fact, two groups of attackers, and that the first group was already at the school when the second group arrived by truck. At first, some at the school mistook the guerrillas for Russian special forces practicing a security drill. However, the attackers soon began shooting {{in the air and}} forcing <b>everybody</b> <b>from</b> the school grounds into the building. During the initial chaos, up to 50 people managed to flee and alert authorities to the situation. A number of people also managed to hide in the boiler room. After an exchange of gunfire against the police and an armed local civilian, in which reportedly one attacker was killed and two were wounded, the militants seized the school building. Reports of the death toll from this shoot-out ranged from two to eight people, while more than a dozen people were injured.|$|E

25|$|On 6 October 1789, {{the royal}} family was forced by a Parisian mob mostly {{composed}} of women to move from Versailles to the Tuileries Palace in Paris, where they spent {{the next three years}} as prisoners under the daily surveillance of the national guards who did not spare any humiliation to {{the royal family}}; at that time Marie Antoinette was always surrounded by guards, even in her bedroom at night and these guards were present when the Queen was allowed to see her children. The family lived a secluded life, and Marie Antoinette dedicated most of her time to her two children under the daily surveillance of the national guards who kept her hands behind her back and searched <b>everybody</b> <b>from</b> the Queen to the children to see if any letters were smuggled to the royal prisoner. On 21 June 1791, the family tried to escape in {{what is known as the}} Flight to Varennes, but the attempt failed. After the family was recognized, they were brought back to Paris. When the Tuileries Palace was stormed by an armed mob on 10 August 1792, the royal family sought refuge at the Legislative Assembly.|$|E

500|$|Ibrahim {{recalled}} in 2014 {{that it took}} only one take. Asked in an interview how the title came about, he said: [...] "Because Basil was from Manenberg and for us Manenberg was just symbolic of the removal out of District Six, which is actually the removal of <b>everybody</b> <b>from</b> everywhere in the world, and Manenberg specifically because... it signifies, it's our music, and it's our culture..." [...] The township of Manenberg was considered symbolic with respect to apartheid in the same was as Soweto. The track was released on the album Mannenberg – Is Where It's Happening in the same year. The album only featured two songs; [...] "Mannenberg", and [...] "The Pilgrim" [...] (which was similarly long, at 12 minutes and 47 seconds). The title [...] "Mrs. Williams from Mannenberg", in reference to Gladys Williams, former housekeeper {{of one of the}} musicians, Morris Goldberg, was also considered for the album, and a photograph of her by Ibrahim was used on the album cover.|$|E

2500|$|Typically, Doctor Whos anniversary {{stories are}} {{named after the}} number of {{returning}} Doctors, as with The Three Doctors and The Five Doctors. Moffat explained his choice of title to SFX magazine, commenting that [...] "... it's very rare in Doctor Who that the story happens to the Doctor. It happens to people around him, and he helps out – he's the hero figure who rides in and saves <b>everybody</b> <b>from</b> {{the story of the}} week. He is not the story of the week. In this, he {{is the story of the}} week. This is the day of the Doctor. This is his most important day. His most important moment.

[...] "All kinds of journalists were trying to cause controversy and have me say something like 'This is nothing like the book' or 'He ruined my book'.

2500|$|Emanuel {{distinguished}} between basic services {{that should be}} guaranteed to <b>everybody</b> <b>from</b> discretionary medical services that are not guaranteed. The result would be a two tiered system, where those with more money could afford more discretionary services. He saw a failure to define basic services as the reason attempts at universal health care coverage have failed. As a result, the belief that universal health care would require unlimited costs makes any attempt at providing universal health care seem likely to end in national bankruptcy. Instead of universal coverage of basic health care, those who are well insured have coverage for many discretionary forms {{of health care and}} no coverage for [...] some basic forms of health care. Emanuel said that while drawing a line separating basic and universal health care from discretionary health care is difficult, the attempt should be made. Emaniel mentioned the philosophies of Amy Gutmann, Norman Daniels and Daniel Callahan when arguing that there is an overlap between liberalism and communitarianism where civic republicanism and deliberative democracy meet. According to The Atlantic, Emanuel is describing the philosophy of John Rawls in arguing that society is choosing one value (equality) over another (a healthy society), and this substitution may be responsible for limited choices in health care. PolitiFact says that Emanuel was describing the fact that doctors often have to make difficult choices, such as who should get a liver transplant. [...] PolitiFact also said, [...] "Academics often write theoretically about ideas that are being kicked around. And they repeat and explore those ideas, without necessarily endorsing them." ...|$|E
