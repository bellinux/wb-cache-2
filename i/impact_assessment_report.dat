2500|$|According to the city's Royal Charter of 10 April 1662, the {{official}} name is [...] "Londonderry". This was reaffirmed in a High Court decision in 2007 when Derry City Council sought guidance on {{the procedure for}} effecting a name change. The council had changed its name from [...] "Londonderry City Council" [...] to [...] "Derry City Council" [...] in 1984; the court case was seeking clarification as to whether this had also changed {{the name of the}} city. The decision of the court was that it had not but it was clarified that the correct procedure to do so was via a petition to the Privy Council. Derry City Council since started this process and were involved in conducting an equality <b>impact</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>report</b> (EQIA). Firstly it held an opinion poll of district residents in 2009, which reported that 75% of Catholics and 77% of Nationalists found the proposed change acceptable, compared to 6% of Protestants and 8% of Unionists. Then the EQIA held two consultative forums, and solicited comments from the general public on whether or not the city should have its name changed to Derry. A total of 12,136 comments were received, of which 3,108 were broadly in favour of the proposal, and 9,028 opposed to it. On 23 July 2015, the council voted in favour of a motion to change {{the official}} name of the city to Derry and to write to Mark H. Durkan, Northern Ireland Minister of the Environment, to ask how the change could be effected.|$|E

40|$|Urbanisation and {{infrastructure}} developments {{impact on the}} surrounding natural environment and threaten biodiversity. The fragmentation of natural habitats in particular is a major obstacle {{for the preservation of}} biodiversity in a long-term perspective. In the planning process, both the environmental <b>impact</b> <b>assessment</b> and strategic environmental assessment processes {{play a central role in}} the identification and prediction of impacts on biodiversity. At the same time, the devel-opment of GIS technologies and GIS-based ecological models offer new perspectives in the elaboration of predictions. In order to analyse current practices and identify the need for im-provements in the environmental impact process, a review of environmental <b>impact</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>reports</b> was carried out. Further, a review of existing GIS methods and GIS-based ecological models is presented. The results of the review of environmental <b>impact</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>reports</b> show a lack of predictions in current biodiversity assessments. These asssessments often concentrate on impacts at the local scale, failing to consider large-scale and widespread impacts at the ecosys-tem and landscape levels. The review of GIS methods and GIS-based ecological models demon-strate the possibility to generate quantitative predictions for a specific area as well as for it’s sur-rounding environment. At the same time, the flexibility and reproducibility of such methods would allow predictions to be made for different alternatives or scenarios, therefore providing decision makers with relevant information of potential impacts on biodiversity. This would, in turn, result in an improved integration of biodiversity issues in physical planning and contribute to a sustainable development. QC 2010112...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIntegrated <b>impact</b> <b>assessment</b> (IA) of {{policies}} in the European Commission takes place {{in an environment of}} competing problem frames, contested policy objectives and a multitude of interested actors. This paper sets out to discuss the potential value of integrating the ecosystem services (ESS) concept for improving the consideration of environmental benefits and values during framing and appraisal of new policies at European level. The discussion was based on a workshop conducted with experts encompassing their disciplinary fields to the science–policy interface. A review of recent literature and <b>impact</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>reports</b> from policy science and ecosystem services research allowed for a two-way contemplation. The potential integration of concepts was analysed for conceptual, technical, ethical and pragmatic aspects. It was found that indicator sets applied in the <b>impact</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>reports</b> follow a much less formalised structure than the reports or the procedure. An integration of the ecosystem services concept would enhance the requisite variety of indicators used, and thus contribute to the overall goal for sustainable development. Potentials for improving IA lie particularly in the up- and downscaling of benefits and values, policy relevant comparative studies and the prospective possibilities for innovation in indicator development. Based on this rationale of improving requisite variety for future decision making, the emphasis lies on a further development of the ESS concept along two pathways of operationalisation: the translation of the concept for a comprehensive approach at a higher level of abstraction (soft application), and the application of the concept for providing aggregated, quantitative and unit-based information at different steps of an IA (hard application) ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractOpen pit {{operation}} type is generally preferred in mining operations {{due to its}} applicability on all operable exposed rock grounds, its minimum production loss and high production rate. Especially materials like marble, travertine, limestone, dolomite, calcite and granite are mainly mined by open pit mining. Mined materials are put through breaking, crushing and sifting processes in pit area or facilities established close by. Number {{of this type of}} open pit mines in our country has increased in recent years. Open stone pits in Hatay area in the scope of Group 1 st, 2 nd and 4 th as defined in law and environmental problems arising in relation to these are covered in this study. At the first step, stone pit operations in the province were identified by using geology and topography maps, satellite images and field studies. Then, operation potentials and environmental problems arising in relation to these were determined by field studies and surveys and suggestions on solutions were introduced. In the abovementioned studies it is determined that there are up to 90 stone pit operations and businesses in the province area. Swift {{increase in the number of}} pits and businesses in last 15 years is noteworthy. Environmental <b>Impact</b> <b>Assessment</b> <b>reports</b> were issued for only 11 of the operations that applied for permits in this time period. Swift increase in the numbers of these pits and lack of concern for environment in their establishment have led to environmental problems caused by these pits; problems like dust, tremors and disruption of natural landscape.

40|$|Background: The Salford Health Investment for Tomorrow and the Local Improvement Finance Trust {{proposals}} for the comprehensive redevelopment of Salford Royal Hospital {{and the provision}} of four integrated primary health and social centres in the City of Salford are a response to the challenge of the NHS Plan to modernise delivery and service provision. The scale of the proposed developments will have a major effect on {{the quality of life in}} Salford. This health <b>impact</b> <b>assessment</b> was undertaken to determine how these proposals could be amended to ensure that the impacts are optimised so that potential benefits to Salford’s communities are realised to maximise their health and wellbeing. Method: This involved a comprehensive prospective health <b>impact</b> <b>assessment</b> and a series of interviews with key stakeholders, community organisations, and local people to identify and prioritise potential positive and negative impacts of the proposals. Results and conclusions: The assessment pointed to a wide range of positive and negative impacts that provided the basis of a set of recommendations, which were linked directly to the themes of the Salford Community Plan. These related to setting employment, education, and training opportunities to maximise health and wellbeing and improve quality of life for all communities in Salford within the framework of the plan.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this mixed-method thesis {{was to assess the}} {{relationships}} between banking organizational characteristics and the quality of social <b>impact</b> <b>assessments</b> <b>reported</b> by conventional and social banks. Employing a multi-theoretical framework of legitimacy theory and stakeholder theory, the following characteristics were investigated in their relation to the quality of social impact assessments: bank type, bank size, net profit, and home country. Following a content analysis approach, the quality of <b>assessments</b> <b>reported</b> by banks, concerning their internal operations, philanthropic activities, and financing activities, were evaluated using an instrument based on the Impact Value Chain. Overall, the study found significant heterogeneity in the quality of disclosure among the three activity areas of the banks, with the assessment of internal operations being the highest quality reported. Also it appears that conventional banks face more pressures and demands to assess their impacts compared to social banks. Furthermore, for conventional banks, the variables of size and net profit showed to be determinants for social <b>impact</b> <b>assessment</b> quality. Conversely, the assessment behaviour of social banks were found to have no associations with the banking characteristics investigated. Overall, the findings of the assessment behaviour of conventional banks are generally in agreement with legitimacy theory and stakeholder theory, however these extant disclosure theories struggle at predicting the disclosure behaviour of social banks, likely because of their relatively small size. Moreover, the challenges inherent to measuring the indirect social impacts of philanthropic and financial activities appear to remain significant, further signalling for future research...|$|R
40|$|Corruption {{in public}} {{administration}} {{is a cause}} for continuing concern, particularly in the developing world. Although optimism regarding the ability of e-government to reduce or eliminate corruption is widespread, neutral <b>impact</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>reports</b> however continue to expose cases where corruption persists even after the introduction of e-government. Clearly, {{there is a need}} for strengthening research on anti-corruption effects of e-government, which at present is largely a-theoretical and descriptive. In keeping with the above goal, this essay connects to a few theoretical frameworks which are relevant to corruption studies, and reviews the mechanisms by which e-government reduces or eliminates corruption. The insights developed from this exercise have helped to formulate a conceptual model of e-government’s anti-corruption impacts. The proposed model is expected to stimulate further research on the anti-corruption effects of e-government, research that will help in: viewing the anti-corruption successes and failures of e-government in a more unified manner; understanding the limitations of e-government as an anti-corruption tool; and devising managerial interventions which may increase the likelihood of success in e-government led anti-corruption initiatives...|$|R
