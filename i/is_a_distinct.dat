5|$|Esthesioneuroblastoma, {{also known}} as {{olfactory}} neuroblastoma, is believed to arise from the olfactory epithelium and its classification remains controversial.

5|$|A {{version of}} the game for the Sega Master System and Game Gear was {{developed}} by Aspect. Though based on the original game of the same name, it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinct</b> game, with different level designs and a different plot, and this version, unlike the 16-bit release, {{does not have the}} spin dash, which led it to being thought to be made before the Sega Genesis version.|$|E

5|$|Ampelosaurus sp. <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinct</b> sauropod as it {{is known}} from just a braincase. Although the number of sauropod braincases from the Late Cretaceous European {{archipelago}} found to date is limited, it shows a significant diversity. The specimen from Lo Hueco resembles the braincase of A. atacis MDE C3–761.|$|E
5|$|As with {{cultural}} studies, media study <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinct</b> discipline that owes to {{the convergence of}} sociology and other social sciences and humanities, in particular, literary criticism and critical theory. Though the production process or the critique of aesthetic forms {{is not in the}} remit of sociologists, analyses of socializing factors, such as ideological effects and audience reception, stem from sociological theory and method. Thus the 'sociology of the media' is not a subdiscipline per se, but the media is a common and often-indispensable topic.|$|E
5|$|M3 is a small, {{triangular}} tooth. There {{is large}} basin in the middle, and a mesoloph is present. At {{the back of}} the tooth, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinct</b> posteroloph.

5|$|A {{different}} call is {{emitted by}} a male frog or unreceptive female when mounted by another male. This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinct</b> chirruping sound and {{is accompanied by a}} vibration of the body. Tree frogs and some non-aquatic species have a rain call that they make on the basis of humidity cues prior to a shower. Many species also have a territorial call that is used to drive away other males. All of these calls are emitted with the mouth of the frog closed. A distress call, emitted by some frogs when they are in danger, is produced with the mouth open resulting in a higher-pitched call. It is typically used when the frog has been grabbed by a predator and may serve to distract or disorientate the attacker so that it releases the frog.|$|E
5|$|A related {{study also}} noted a locking {{mechanism}} {{in the lower}} jaw shared between the two genera. In a separate paper, Currie noted the possibility that Alioramus might represent a juvenile Tarbosaurus, but stated that the much higher tooth count and more prominent nasal crests in Alioramus suggest it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinct</b> genus. Similarly, Currie uses the high tooth count of Nanotyrannus {{to suggest that it}} may be a distinct genus, rather than a juvenile Tyrannosaurus as most other experts believe. However, the discovery and description of Qianzhousaurus reveals that Alioramus is not a close relation to Tarbosaurus, instead belonging to a newly described family of tyrannosaurids; the Alioramini. Qianzhousaurus further reveals that similar long-snouted tyrannosaurids were widely distributed throughout Asia and would have shared the same environment while avoiding competition with larger and more robust tyrannosaurines by hunting different prey.|$|E

5|$|Although very {{distinctive}} in appearance, the {{fly agaric}} has been mistaken for other yellow to red mushroom {{species in the}} Americas, such as Armillaria cf. mellea and the edible Amanita basii—a Mexican species similar to A.caesarea of Europe. Poison control centres in the U.S. and Canada have become aware that amarill (Spanish for 'yellow') is a common name for the A.caesarea-like species in Mexico. Amanita caesarea can be distinguished by its entirely orange to red cap which lacks the numerous white warty spots of the fly agaric. Furthermore, the stem, gills and ring of A. caesarea are bright yellow, not white. The volva <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinct</b> white bag, not broken into scales. In Australia, the introduced fly agaric may {{be confused with the}} native vermilion grisette (Amanita xanthocephala), which grows in association with eucalypts. The latter species generally lacks the white warts of A.muscaria and bears no ring.|$|E
5|$|Hypogeomys australis was {{described}} in 1903 by Guillaume Grandidier from subfossil material collected in the cave of Andrahomana in southeastern Madagascar. The Hypogeomys material {{was similar to the}} living Hypogeomys antimena, but distinct enough for Grandidier to recognize it as a separate species, different in size and some morphological details. Grandidier described another subfossil Hypogeomys species in 1912, H.boulei, but the material that species was based on was later identified as the enigmatic mammal Plesiorycteropus. In 1946, Charles Lamberton illustrated another femur (upper leg bone) of H.australis; the origin and current whereabouts of this specimen are unknown. In 1996, Steven Goodman and Daniel Rakotondravony reviewed the distribution of Hypogeomys and confirmed that H.australis <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinct</b> species. H.australis and H.antimena are classified together within the exclusively Madagascan subfamily Nesomyinae of the family Nesomyidae, which includes various African rodents.|$|E
5|$|Lactifluus piperatus was the {{original}} type species of the genus Lactarius. However, after the finding that Lactarius actually represented more than one genus, the species Lactarius torminosus was conserved as type for that genus. Thus, L. piperatus is now the type species of Lactifluus, which was split from Lactarius and contains mainly tropical milk-caps, but also some species of the north temperate zone. Phylogenetic research showed that L. glaucescens, sometimes considered only a variety of L. piperatus, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinct</b> species in Europe. Furthermore, the existence of at least ten lineages worldwide, with no overlap among continents, was shown for the group around L. piperatus, suggesting that populations in North America might actually be distinct species.|$|E

5|$|Lexus sales {{operations}} vary {{in structure}} by region. In many markets, {{such as the}} U.S., the dealership network <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinct</b> organization from corporate headquarters, with separately owned and operated Lexus showrooms. By contrast, in Japan all 143 dealerships {{in the country are}} owned and operated by Lexus. Several markets have a designated, third party regional distributor; for example, in the United Arab Emirates, sales operations are managed by Al-Futtaim Motors LLC, and in Costa Rica, Lexus vehicles are sold via regional distributor Purdy Motors S.A. Other officially sanctioned regional distributors have sold Lexus models prior to the launch of, or in absence of, a dedicated dealership network.|$|E
5|$|Lord Howe Island <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinct</b> {{terrestrial}} ecoregion {{known as}} the Lord Howe Island subtropical forests. It {{is part of the}} Australasia ecozone and shares many biotic affinities with Australia, New Guinea, and New Caledonia. Almost half of the island's native plants are endemic and many of the island's unique plants grow on or around the mountain summits where the height has allowed the development of a true cloud forest and many different microhabitats from sealevel to the summits. One of the best known is Howea, an endemic genus of palms (Arecaceae) that are commonly known as kentia palms and make handsome houseplants. Annual exports provide a revenue of over A$2million, providing the only major industry on the island apart from tourism.|$|E
5|$|Morchella populiphila <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinct</b> morel {{because of}} its cap {{attachment}} and its habitat, and {{it is unlikely to}} be mistaken for other species. Verpa bohemica is somewhat similar in appearance, but its cap hangs free from attachment to the stipe. The other North American half-free morel, Morchella punctipes, is very similar in appearance to M.populiphila, and they cannot be reliably distinguished on morphology alone. The distribution of M.punctipes extends from the Great Plains eastward. The widespread European species Morchella semilibera is morphologically indistinguishable from M.populiphila, in both macroscopic and microscopic characteristics.|$|E
