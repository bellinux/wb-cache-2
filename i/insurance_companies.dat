5|$|Many Public Storage {{customers}} have filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau regarding insurance policies sold by Public Storage representatives, after experiencing burglaries of their storage units then having their insurance claims denied. Investigative journalists from TV news stations in California, Kansas, and Washington have reported on difficulties consumers had when filing insurance claims for burglaries with Willis and The New Hampshire Insurance Company, which are affiliated with Public Storage. For example, claims {{have been denied}} because the storage unit had an intact lock; affiliated <b>insurance</b> <b>companies</b> cited insufficient evidence of forced entry, though burglars often replace the unit's lock {{in an attempt to}} conceal the burglary. Insurance commissioners in two states have criticized the practices of <b>insurance</b> <b>companies</b> affiliated with Public Storage. An ongoing class action lawsuit alleges Public Storage misleads consumers into thinking that insurance premiums are charged at cost, whereas a substantial amount of those premiums are retained as profits by Public Storage. Sales of these insurance policies do have a high profit, but generate less than five percent of the company's total revenue.|$|E
