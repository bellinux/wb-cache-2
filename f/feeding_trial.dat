50|$|Many {{other factors}} may {{influence}} the quality of wild lupine (Lupinus perennis) as a Karner blue butterfly food resource. At Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore, wild lupine with Karner blue butterfly feeding damage had significantly larger leaves and longer and thicker stems than plants without feeding damage. In addition, larval length was positively associated with wild lupine height in central Wisconsin. Higher nitrogen concentrations in wild lupine leaves resulted in significantly shorter larval durations in a <b>feeding</b> <b>trial.</b> In 1995, in west-central Wisconsin, significantly more Karner blue butterfly larvae were observed in oak-pine barren plots where mildew infection was delayed compared to areas where wild lupine were infected earlier. However, in a <b>feeding</b> <b>trial</b> larval duration of Karner blue butterflies fed mildew-infected wild lupine was {{not significantly different from}} treatments that resulted in the shortest larval durations. Karner blue butterfly fed water-stressed wild lupine had significantly longer larval durations than many treatments including larvae fed flowering wild lupine, shade-grown wild lupine in seed, or mildew-infected wild lupine. Although Karner blue butterflies have been shown to benefit from their association with ants, wild lupine with Karner blue butterfly larvae in the Allegan State Game Area in Michigan were not detectably closer to ant hills than wild lupine without caterpillars.|$|E

50|$|Several {{studies have}} found a {{positive}} relationship between measures of wild lupine and Karner blue butterfly abundance. However, available evidence suggests that senescent wild lupine is a poor larval food source. The effects of other phenological stages are more ambiguous. In west-central Wisconsin, Karner blue butterfly abundance was negatively associated with the abundance of reproductive lupine and positively related with the frequency of immature wild lupine. However, a <b>feeding</b> <b>trial</b> found that Karner blue butterfly fed 1st year wild lupine had one of the lowest survival rates observed and significantly longer larval durations than larvae fed older wild lupine that did not flower, was flowering, had recently flowered, or was grown in shade and was in seed.

A 91-day <b>feeding</b> <b>trial</b> in rats showed no adverse effects, but the Bt tomato has never been commercialised. Tomatoes resistant to a root knot nematode have been created by inserting a cysteine proteinase inhibitor gene from taro. A chemically synthesised ceropin B gene, usually found in the giant silk moth (Hyalophora cecropia), has been introduced into tomato plants and in vivo studies show significant resistance to bacterial wilt and bacterial spot.

5000|$|Critics of the AAFCO {{standards}} {{argue that}} such requirements are too lax. Generational studies conducted by researchers at University of California, Davis have shown some foods that pass AAFCO's feeding trials are still not suitable for long-term use and estimated that of 100 foods that pass the nutritional analysis, 10 to 20 would not pass the feeding trials. Although maximum levels of intake of some nutrients have been established because of concerns with overnutrition, many still lack a maximum allowed level and some contains large disparity between maximum and minimum values. The NRC accepts that despite ongoing research, large gaps still exist in the knowledge of quantitative nutritional information for specific nutrients.

40|$|Larval {{development}} of Penaeus monodon from protozoea (PZ 1) to postlarval stages is described on natural and commercially available artificial larval diets under controlled laboratory <b>feed</b> <b>trials.</b> Five species of live microalgae (Tetraselmis chuii, Chaetoceros calcitrans, Skeletonema costatum, Rhodomonas baltica and Pavlova lutheri) were evaluated in <b>feed</b> <b>trials</b> at seven (5 - 60 cells gl 1) cell concentrations with protozoeal larval stages. Performance of five animal diets (rotifers, Mytilus eggs, Artemia nauplii, barnacle nauplii and crab eggs) {{were examined in}} <b>feed</b> <b>trials</b> from Mysis (Ml) to postlarvae (PL 1). Best results for protozoeal stages were obtained on a combination diet T. chuii + R. baltica at 40 cells µl-', while results from mysis to postlarvae were best achieved on Artemia nauplii. Natural feeds are expensive, difficult to maintain in mass culture and often vary in nutritional value. Larval performance on ten leading brands of artificial larval diet marketed using different process technologies were evaluated in replicated <b>feed</b> <b>trials,</b> together with factors causing variability in larval growth and survival of P. monodon. It was found that nutrient leach loss from unstable artificial feeds in culture conditions increases levels of ammonia and nitrite beyond safe limits. Live microalgal species at 1000 cells µl 1 added to culture water reduces these toxic levels. The role of microalgae in larval culture is also examined. To further improve larval growth and survival on artificial diets, proteins from different sources, lipid, vitamin and mineral levels were incorporated in microencapsulated feeds.

40|$|Abstract. —Three feeding {{trials were}} {{conducted}} to determine the dietary protein requirement of juvenile sunshine bass (Morone chrysops 9 * M. saxatilis < 5). In the first <b>feeding</b> <b>trial,</b> semipurified diets were formulated with menhaden fish meal to contain graded levels of protein ranging from 25 to 55 % of dry diet. Each diet was fed to triplicate groups of sunshine bass initially weighing 2. 68 ± 0. 09 g/fish (mean ± SD) in a closed recirculating system containing fresh water with hardness of 150 mg/L as CaCO^. At the end of 8 weeks, nonlinear least-squares regression analysis indicated that protein levels of 40. 8 and 43. 1 % of dry diet were required for optimal growth and feed efficiency, respectively. In the second <b>feeding</b> <b>trial,</b> similar diets (30 - 50 % protein) were fed to triplicate groups of fish initially weighing 6. 45 ± 0. 25 g/fish in a recirculating system containing artificial seawater at a salinity of 32 %o.

Thus, after 4 weeks, salinity was reduced to l%c for a third <b>feeding</b> <b>trial,</b> which continued for 6 weeks.
