The compound eyes of these species contain light-absorbing and -reflecting pigments contained in granules, located in 5 different cells. The light absorbing pigment granules (light screen) are situated in (1) the distal pigment cells, (2) the retinular cells, (3) the basal <b>pigment</b> cells. The <b>reflecting</b> <b>pigment</b> granules are located in (4) the distal, and (5) the proximal <b>reflecting</b> <b>pigment</b> cells. Another innominate cell type investing the ommatidia contains vacuoles without pigment content. The innominate cell type, and the basal absorbing pigment cell (3) listed above, have not earlier been reported for a crustacean species. Measurements of the spectral absorption on sliced and squashed ommatidia show that all components of the light screen have an increased absorption in the wavelength regions 400 – 450 nm and 530 – 570 nm, probably due to xanthommatin and ommin. The spectral absorbancy of the <b>reflecting</b> <b>pigment</b> cells were not determined. Similar cells in other species are known to contain pteridines...|$|R

40|$|The {{compound}} {{eye of the}} crabHemigrapsus sanguineus undergoes daily {{changes in}} morphology as determined by light and electron microscopy, both in the quantity of chromophore substances studied by HPLC and in visual sensitivity as shown by electrophysiological techniques. 1. At a temperature of 20 °C, the rhabdom occupation ratio (ROR) of an ommatidial retinula was 11. 6 % (maximum) at midnight, 8. 0 {{times larger than the}} minimum value at midday (1. 4 %) (Figs. 2, 6). 2. Observations by freeze-fracture revealed that the densities of intra-membranous particles (9 – 11 nm in diameter) of rhabdomeric membrane were ca. 2000 /μm 2 and ca. 3000 /μm 2 for night and daytime compound eyes, respectively (Fig. 3). 3. Screening pigment granules migrated longitudinally and aggregated at night, but dispersed during the day. <b>Reflecting</b> <b>pigment</b> granules migrate transversally in the proximal half of the retinula layer i. e. cytoplasmic extensions containing <b>reflecting</b> <b>pigment</b> granules squeeze between neighbouring retinula cells causing optical isolation (Fig. 4). Thus the screening pigment granules within the retinula cells show longitudinal migration and radial movement so that the daytime rhabdoms are closely surrounded by the pigment granules (Fig. 2). 4. At 20 °C, the total amount of chromophore of the visual pigment (11 -cis and all-trans-retinal) was 1. 4 times larger at night than during the day i. e. 46. 6 pmol/eye at midnight and 33. 2 pmol/eye at midday (Fig. 9). Calculations of the total surface area of rhabdomeric membrane, total number of intra-membranous particles in rhabdomeric membrane and the total number of chromophore molecules in a compound eye, indicate that a considerable amount of chromophore-protein complex exists outside the rhabdom during the day. 5. The change in rhabdom size and quantity of chromophore were highly dependent on temperature. At 10 °C both rhabdom size and amount of chromophore stayed close to daytime levels throughout the 24 hours (Figs. 6, 9). 6. The intracellularly determined relative sensitivity of the dark adapted night eye to a point source of light was about twice as high as the darkadapted day eye (Fig. 10). Most of the increase in the sensitivity is attributed primarily to the effect of <b>reflecting</b> <b>pigment</b> migration around the basement membrane (Fig. 4) and, secondarily, to the changes in the amount and properties of the photoreceptive membrane.

Experimental reflectance measurements are presented {{of a series of}} perylene based pigments, revealing significant variations in the NIR region as a function of derivatisation and substitution. Theoretical methods are applied to account for the observed trends. Derivatisation of perylene leads to an extension of the π-aromatic system, resulting in a bathochromic shift of UV/Vis absorption maxima towards the NIR region. However, this is insufficient to account for the observed variations in NIR reflectance. In comparison, overtones and combination modes of fundamental IR vibrations appear to be more important in explaining the observed variations in NIR reflectance/absorbance. Aromatic groups lead to a small number of intense NIR bands, while alkyl groups generally lead to a greater number of less intense NIR bands.

40|$|A {{structural}} {{analysis of the}} compound eye of Hemigrapsus nudus expands the basis of functional analysis of decapod Crustacean eyes. Contradictory evidence for disintegration of rhabdomeric microvilli {{in the absence of}} light prompted observation of H. nudus eyes after 146 days in darkness. Eyes were fixed with formalin and glutaraldehyde and post fixed with osmium tetroxide for electron and light microscopy. Light- dark-adapted eyes were also observed with hot water fixation and paraffin embedment. The eye of H. nudus is typical of decapod Crustacean compound eyes. Corneagenous cells underlie the transparent cuticle cone cells secrete the composite crystalline cone which contacts the rhabdom proximally. The single fused rhabdom is composed of layers of microvilli from two groups of retinular cells. The layers are oriented at right angles to each other, and perpendicular to the optic axis of the ommatidium. A presumptive four-lobed eighth retinular cell makes up the distal end of the rhabdom. Distal, proximal and <b>reflecting</b> retinal <b>pigments</b> are located in the distal pigment cells, retinular cells and tapetal cells, respectively. Distal and proximal pigments surround the rhabdom during light-adaptation, and withdraw during dark-adaptation. <b>Reflecting</b> <b>pigment</b> is found above the basement membrane in light-adapted eyes and below it in dark-adapted eyes. The crystalline cone may change length during light- and dark-adaptation. Prolonged darkness does not cause disintegration of the rhabdomeric microvilli. H. nudus lives in conditions of dim illumination. The fused, layered rhabdom is an efficient mechanism of light absorption. Internal reflection within the rhabdom is enhanced by the palisade and further increases light absorption. Functional units exist within the ommatidium. Mutually perpendicular rhabdomeric layers suggest intraretinal polarized light perception.

These genera offer important ecosystem services such as winter forage for reindeer and caribou. The mechanism behind this niche separation is poorly understood. We tested the hypothesis that species-specific sunscreening fungal pigments protect underlying symbiotic algae differently against high light, and thus shape the vertical canopy gradient of epiphytes. Three pale species with the <b>reflecting</b> <b>pigment</b> usnic acid (Alectoria sarmentosa, Usnea dasypoga, U. longissima) and three with dark, absorbing melanins (Bryoria capillaris, B. fremontii, B. fuscescens) were compared. We subjected the lichens to desiccation stress with and without light, and assessed their performance with chlorophyll fluorescence. Desiccation alone only affected U. longissima. By contrast, light in combination with desiccation caused photoinhibitory damage in all species. Usnic lichens were significantly more susceptible to light during desiccation than melanic ones. Thus, melanin is a more efficient light-screening pigment than usnic acid.

40|$|When {{integumentary}} tissue pigments {{are contained}} in chromatophores, tissue color might not depend exclusively {{on the amount of}} pigment. Whether coloration does or does not <b>reflect</b> <b>pigment</b> concentration may be very significant for intraspecific communication, for example when pigment concentration provides fitness-related information. We studied the pigment responsible for the orange/red ventral tail coloring in a lacertid lizard species (Acanthodactylus erythrurus), and whether the color was related to skin pigment concentration. The pigment was identified as a pterin, a higher concentration of which resulted in darker, more red-saturated, redder (less orange) ventral tail skin color. The dorsal tail integument, even though it appears mostly gray to the naked eye, also contained pterins, and furthermore, the dorsal and ventral pterin concentrations were positively correlated. A possible explanation for these results is that pterins accumulate in the skin of the whole tail, even if only needed in the ventral part, but are concealed in the dorsal part. In this way, ventral orange/red coloration would accurately reflect pterin concentration, which provides the basis for a signaling function, while dorsal coloration would become less conspicuous as an anti-predatory mechanism.

Participants {{were required to}} stand as still and stable as possible on a soft foam balance pad while fixating a small target at eye-height on a dimly lit lamp. The room was completely darkened such that no other visual information was available. The lamp was placed at either 0. 4 m, 1. 16 m, 2, 33 m, 3. 5 m, 4. 66 m or 5. 82 m distance from the observer. So far, no other study had investigated such {{a wide range of}} distances. Head position and orientation was measured at 120 Hz using a Vicon tracking system. Participants wore a helmet with <b>infra-red</b> <b>reflecting</b> markers. Each trial lasted 40 seconds, and 30 sec. breaks were taken between the trials. Room lights were switched on during the breaks in order to prevent complete dark adaptation. Postural stability was calculated by quantifying the most frequent sway velocity that occurred at the sampling frequency. This measure was found to be the most robust measure of postural stability, in comparison to other measures, such as sway trajectory length. Furthermore, RMS values for lateral and frontal sway were computed. Results showed that postural stability significantly decreased with increasing fixation distance. At 0. 4 m distance, the average sway velocity across 10 participants was 0. 85 cm/s, and this value increased to 1. 4 cm/s at 5. 82 m fixation distance. This means that the stability of the observers decreases with increasing fixation distance. With eyes closed, average sway velocity increased to 1. 55 cm/s. To investigate the influence of the target distance on the fixation behaviour, we analysed the yaw rotation of the head. A positive correlation between head orientation angle and head position in the mid-lateral plane was found. This means that during lateral postural sway, the head makes systematic compensational movements along the yaw-axis when observers aim to maintain fixation straight ahead. The correlation significantly decreased with increasing fixation distance and reached a plateau at about 2. 5 m. The decrease of postural stability at larger fixation distances also reached a plateau at about 2. 5 m. No correlation between head orientation and head position in the anterior-posterior plane was found. Further experiments which will also include eye-tracking will investigate how afferent visual information and efferent eye-and head movements contribute to human postural stabilisation performance...|$|R

40|$|The book on hand {{provides}} {{a method for}} evaluating different thermal passive improvements on the vehicle cabin. A thermal cabin simulation model in Modelica is developed, based on the RWTH Aachen Modelica Library “AixLib”. The model respects the cabin geometry, material properties and Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning is regulated by a simple PI-controller to the interior temperature. Models for surrounding conditions like weather, driving cycle or solar radiation are implemented. Main output-value is the power-consumption of the HVAC-model and the interior temperature. The whole model is validated against measurements on a real test vehicle in a climate dynamometer chamber. Within {{the development of the}} cabin-model the glass-curvature is one parameter that normally is not respected with thermal cabin simulation. Since there was no possibility to get the influence of the glass curvature for passenger car thermal cabin simulation models this parameter is evaluated in detail. Based on the known radiation properties of flat glass, a new method for calculating transmission through curved glass is developed respecting influences due to changing ray-progress in the glass and the effects of the wider projected area of curved windows. An analysis of this effects leads to a prioritization based on effect-size and all relevant influences are summarized in a set of curves. The major effort for calculating this set of curves leads to a simplification process that brings a formula depending on a normed curvature radius and the incident angle. This formula is further developed to a method for calculating the influence of curvature on radiation transmission in 3 D-simulations. To evaluate the impact of the glass curvature on transmission for passenger cars, curved building facades and roofs three exemplary simulations are done, respecting the position of the sun during a whole day. The simulations indicate, that glass curvature can be neglected for normal passenger cars. For curved building facades and roofs the simulation gives evidence that glass curvature can't be ignored. The developed model is an adequate method for respecting this influence in an early state of thermal building simulation. Corresponding to the objective of this work a sensitivity analysis is performed with the developed thermal cabin simulation model. For this analysis three parameters are identified for variation: Thermal insulation of the cabin, thermal mass and solar transmission. These parameters are evaluated in three different environment conditions (warm, moderate and cold temperature). The analysis determines the solar transmission as the major parameter. Therefore window concepts with glass technologies to affect solar radiation are developed for a passenger car. These concepts are implemented and simulated in the thermal cabin simulation. The results show a significant benefit of <b>infra-red</b> <b>reflecting</b> technologies. Although switchable glass is not yet ready for the use in passenger cars due to performance issues and optical properties the thermal benefit is proven by the results...|$|R

Intensities of the both bands are changed monotonically with RF power, whereas the bandwidth of ∼ 0. 1 eV remains almost invariable.

Through precisely controlling the recording and reading time periods of the two cameras, the SDOCT system realizes an imaging speed at 500, 000 A-lines per second, while maintaining both high axial resolution (~ 8 μm) and acceptable depth ranging (~ 2. 5 mm). With this system, we propose two scanning protocols for human retinal imaging. The first is aimed to achieve isotropic dense sampling and fast scanning speed, enabling a 3 D imaging within 0. 72 sec for a region covering 4 x 4 mm 2. In this case, the B-frame rate is 700 Hz and the isotropic dense sampling is 500 A-lines along both the fast and slow axes. This scanning protocol minimizes the motion artifacts, thus {{making it possible to}} perform two directional averaging so that the signal to noise ratio of the system is enhanced while the degradation of its resolution is minimized. The second protocol is designed to scan the retina in a large field of view, in which 1200 A-lines are captured along both the fast and slow axes, covering 10 mm 2, to provide overall information about the retinal status. Because of relatively long imaging time (4 seconds for a 3 D scan), the motion artifact is inevitable, making it difficult to interpret the 3 D data set, particularly in a way of depth-resolved en-face fundus images. To mitigate this difficulty, we propose to use the relatively high <b>reflecting</b> retinal <b>pigmented</b> epithelium layer as the reference to flatten the original 3 D data set along both the fast and slow axes.

A complete clinical ophthalmologic and neurologic examination was performed, including static 100 -point perimetry, EOG, and electroretinogram (ERG). Results: In 14 of 20 patients, the light/dark ratio (Arden ratio) of the standard EOG was reduced in at least one eye. The a- and b-wave amplitudes and implicit time of the ERG were within the normal range in all patients; however, ERG oscillatory potentials could not be recorded in 10 patients. Twelve patients had visual field constriction; five complained of visual symptoms. The most severe {{visual impairment}} was observed in patients treated with both vigabatrin and valproate. Conclusions: There is some evidence of outer retinal dysfunction in the patients treated with vigabatrin. EOG, a more sensitive diagnostic tool than ERG for screening vigabatrin-treated patients, also appears to be more specific.

40|$|The factors {{affecting}} the amounts {{and types of}} organic matter in lacustrine sediments are summarized in this review, and synthesis, of published studies. Biota living in the lake and in its watershed are {{the sources of the}} organic compounds initially contributed to the lake system. Microbial reworking of these materials during sinking and early sedimentation markedly diminishes the total amount of organic matter while replacing many of the primary compounds with secondary ones. Much of the organic matter content of sediments is the product of this microbial reprocessing. Various organic matter components of lake sediments nonetheless retain source information and thereby contribute to the paleolimnological record. Carbon/nitrogen ratios of total organic matter reflect original proportions of algal and land-derived material. Carbon isotopic compositions indicate the history of lake productivity and carbon recycling. Biomarker compounds provide important information about contributions from different biota. Sterol compositions and chainlength distributions of n-alkanes, n-alkanoic acids, and n-alkanols help distinguish different algal and watershed sources and also record diagenetic alterations. Stabilization of functional-group-containing biomarkers by conversion into saturated or aromatic hydrocarbons or by incorporation into bound forms improves their preservation and hence record of source information. Lignin components provide important evidence of watershed plant cover, and <b>pigments</b> <b>reflect</b> algal assemblages. The interplay of the factors influencing the organic matter content of lake sediments is illustrated by overviews of sedimentary records of four lake systems [...] Lake Biwa (Japan), Lake Greifen (Switzerland), Lake Washington (Pacific Northwest), and the Great Lakes (American Midwest) ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWhen the eye {{is covered}} with a filter that transmits light below 480 nm and a blue field is {{observed}} on a computer screen that is modulated in brightness at about 1 Hz, the fovea is perceived as small irregular dark spot. It was proposed that the “foveal blue scotoma” results from the lack of S-cones in the foveal center. The foveal blue scotoma is highly variable among subjects. Possible factors responsible for the variability include differences in S-cone distribution, in foveal shape, and in macular pigment distribution. Nine young adult subjects were instructed to draw their foveal blue scotomas on a clear foil that was attached in front of the computer screen. The geometry of their foveal pit was measured in OCT images in two dimensions. Macular pigment distribution was measured in fundus camera images. Finally, blue scotomas were compared with Maxwell’s spot which was visualized with a dichroic filter and is commonly assumed to <b>reflect</b> the macular <b>pigment</b> distribution. The diameters of the foveal blue scotomas varied from 15. 8 to 76. 4 arcmin in the right eyes and 15. 5 to 84. 7 arcmin in the left and were highly correlated in both eyes. It was found that the steeper the foveal slopes and the narrower the foveal pit, the larger the foveal blue scotoma. There was no correlation between foveal blue scotoma and macular pigment distribution or Maxwell’s spot. The results are therefore in line with the assumption that the foveal blue scotoma is a consequence of the lack of S-cones in the foveal center. Unlike the foveal blue scotoma, Maxwell’s spot is based on macular pigment as previously proposed...|$|R
40|$|Timely and {{accurate}} identification of tree species by spectral methods {{is crucial for}} forest and urban ecological management. In this study, a total of 394 reflectance spectra (between 350 and 2500 nm) from foliage branches or canopy of 11 important urban forest broadleaf species were measured in the City of Tampa, Florida, USA with a spectrometer. The 11 species include American elm (Ulmus americana), bluejack oak (Quercus incana), crape myrtle (Lagerstroemia indica), laurel oak (Q. laurifolia), live oak (Q. virginiana), southern magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora), persimmon (Diospyros virginiana), red maple (Acer rubrum), sand live oak (Q. geminata), American sycamore (Platanus occidentalis), and turkey oak (Q. laevis). A total of 46 spectral variables, including normalized spectra, derivative spectra, spectral vegetation indices, spectral position variables, and spectral absorption features were extracted and analysed from the in situ hyperspectral measurements. Two classification algorithms were used to identify the 11 broadleaf species: a nonlinear artificial neural network (ANN) and a linear discriminant analysis (LDA). An analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicates that the 30 selected spectral variables are effective to differentiate the 11 species. The 30 selected spectral variables account for water absorption features at 970, 1200, and 1750 nm and <b>reflect</b> characteristics of <b>pigments</b> and other biochemicals in tree leaves, especially variability of chlorophyll content in leaves. The experimental results indicate that both classification algorithms (ANN and LDA) have produced acceptable accuracies (overall accuracy from 86. 3 % to 87. 8 %, kappa from 0. 83 to 0. 87) and have a similar performance for classifying the 11 broadleaf species with input of the 30 selected spectral variables. The preliminary results of identifying the 11 species with the in situ hyperspectral data imply that with current remote sensing techniques, including high spatial and spectral resolution data, it is still difficult but possible to identify similar species to such 11 broadleaf species with an acceptable accuracy...|$|R
40|$|The agnathans (lampreys and hagfishes) are {{representatives of}} the jawless fishes and {{constitute}} the first lineage of extant vertebrates to evolve within chordate phylogenetic history. Previously, we showed that the southern hemisphere pouched lamprey Geotria australis {{has the potential for}} pentachromacy with the expression of five visual pigment (opsin) genes (LWS, SWS 1, SWS 2, RhA, and RhB) in five different cone-like photoreceptors for life in a brightly lit environment exposed to a broad spectrum of light. In contrast, the northern hemisphere sea lamprey Petromyzon marinus dwells {{in a wide range of}} depths that are relatively deeper than the epipelagic waters inhabited by G. australis. Thus, the light levels of the habitat in which the sea lamprey resides are greatly diminished and different regions of the light spectrum are differentially absorbed. Therefore, the visual systems of these two species of lamprey constitute a natural experiment in which to study the selection pressures underlying opsin gene expression and the evolution of color discrimination. By analyzing the opsin genes of P. marinus, we show the expression of two intact retinal opsins, RhA and LWS, which, when regenerated with 11 -cis retinal, give peak spectral sensitivities (lambda(max) values) of 501 and 536 nm, respectively. In contrast to G. australis, the genome of P. marinus possesses remnants of SWS 1 and SWS 2 pseudogenes, which with the loss of RhB, suggests that P. marinus is a dichromat. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we show that a single amino acid substitution (Ser to Pro) at site 164 is responsible for a blue shift of 19 nm of the LWS visual pigment of P. marinus compared with G. australis, which may reflect habitat differences between the two species. Based on these studies, we propose that gene loss (or duplication) and subsequent mutation plays an important role in the evolution of color vision and that the complement and tuning of these visual <b>pigments</b> <b>reflect</b> the ecology and light environment of these phylogenetically basal vertebrates...|$|R
40|$|The Arctic Ocean is {{characterized}} by broad continental shelves, which have high rates of primary productivity. In some areas, much of this production falls to the bottom, supplying rich and active communities of benthic organisms. Benthic-pelagic coupling {{over much of the}} Arctic shelves is thought to be particularly tight. Moreover in areas covered by ice, ice algae can be the main source of carbon for the food web and thus for the benthos. ^ Sedimentary pigments have demonstrated their usefulness in studies of ecosystem changes, and especially changes of organic matter inputs to the benthos. In order to characterize variation in pelagic-benthic coupling in the Arctic, sedimentary pigments were studied in the oligotrophic Beaufort Sea (CASES project) and in the more productive Barents Sea (CABANERA project). During 7 cruises from 2003 to 2005, sediment cores, water column POM and ice algae samples have been collected, representing a significant spatial coverage and seasonal variations. ^ Sedimentary <b>pigments</b> <b>reflected</b> changes in environmental factors, sources of primary productivity, food web structure, and benthic activity. The Beaufort Sea and Barents Sea showed very different pelagic-benthic coupling, reflecting the important contrast between the two ecosystems of primary productivity, secondary production, and hydrography. In the Barents Sea, spatial changes were highly influenced by currents while in the Beaufort Sea, spatial changes were due to depth and river influence. Physical parameters seemed more responsible of spatial changes. From a seasonal point of view, productivity regime, especially ice-algal production and the match/mismatch of grazing, seemed important in shaping organic matter inputs to the benthos. In the spring, ice-algal production largely influenced organic matter inputs to the benthos in both the Barents and Beaufort Seas. In the summer, grazing was responsible for inputs of degraded material in both ecosystems. In addition to biological parameters, environmental factors were also important in summer and/or fall. In the Barents Sea during summer, the different currents lead to phytoplankton taxonomy variations, and in the Beaufort Sea during fall, riverine inputs were found to be responsible for presence of allochtonous material in the sediment. ...|$|R
