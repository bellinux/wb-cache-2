While Cody's show brought appreciation for the Western and American Indian cultures, he saw the American West change dramatically during his life. Bison herds, which had once numbered in the millions, were threatened with <b>extinction.</b> Railroads <b>crossed</b> the plains, barbed wire and other types of fences divided the land for farmers and ranchers, and the once-threatening Indian tribes were confined to reservations.

50|$|The <b>extinction</b> <b>cross</b> is {{an optical}} {{phenomenon}} that is seen {{when trying to}} extinguish a laser beam or non-planar white light using crossed polarizers. Ideally, crossed (90° rotated) polarizers block all light, since light which is polarized along the polarization axis of the first polarizer is perpendicular to the polarization axis of the second. When the beam is not perfectly collimated, however, a characteristic fringing pattern is produced.|$|E

Logol's Iodine is one, used for staining starch because iodine reagents easily bind to starch but less easily to other materials. Features that allow identification of starch grains include: presence of hilum (core of the grain), lamellae (or growth layers), birefringence, and <b>extinction</b> <b>cross</b> (a cross shape, visible on grains under revolving polarized light) which are visible with a microscope and shape and size.|$|E
40|$|Background: Previous {{research}} on patients with left tactile extinction {{has shown that}} crossing of hands, so that each hand is {{on the opposite side}} of the body midline relative to the other, improves detection of stimuli given to the left hand. Objectives: To study the influence of the spatial position of limbs on left tactile extinction, and its relations with left visual neglect. Methods: Normal participants and patients with right cerebral hemisphere damage and left tactile extinction were asked to detect single or double light touch stimuli applied to their cheeks, hands, or knees with their arm and legs either in anatomical or in crossed position, increasing the attentional load of the task. Results: In patients with left <b>extinction,</b> limb <b>crossing</b> caused a deterioration in performance for stimuli applied to right body parts, with only a tendency to an improvement in detection for left body parts (only two of 24 patients showed substantial (. 20 %) improvement in left <b>extinction</b> after limb <b>crossing).</b> After crossing, left limb detections of double stimuli decreased with increasing degrees of visual neglect. Conclusions: In conditions of high attentional load, limb crossing may impair tactile detection in most patients with left extinction, and particularly in those showing signs of left visual neglect. These result...|$|R

40|$|Absolute <b>extinction</b> and {{scattering}} <b>cross</b> sections {{for gold}} nanoparticle dimers were determined experimentally using a chemometric approach involving singular-value decomposition of the extinction and scattering spectra of slowly aggregating gold nanospheres in aqueous suspension. Quantitative spectroscopic data on plasmonic nanoparticle assemblies in liquid suspension are rare, in particular for particles larger than 40 nm, {{and in this}} work we demonstrate how such data can be obtained directly from the aggregating suspension. Our method can analyse, non invasively, the evolution of several sub-populations of nanoparticle assemblies. It may be applied to other self-assembling nanoparticle systems with an evolving optical response. The colloidal systems studied here are based on 20, 50 and 80 nm gold nanospheres in aqueous solutions containing sodium lipoate. In these systems, the reversible dimerisation process can be controlled using pH and ionic strength, and this control is rationalised in terms of DLVO theory. The dimers were identified in suspension by their translational and rotational diffusion through scattering correlation spectroscopy. Moreover, their gigadalton molecular weight was measured using electrospray charge-detection mass spectrometry, demonstrating that mass spectrometry {{can be used to}} study nanoparticles assemblies of very high molecular mass. The <b>extinction</b> and scattering <b>cross</b> sections calculated in the discrete-dipole approximation (DDA) agree very well with those obtained experimentally using our approach...|$|R

The results showed that transitivity could be responsible of multiple endogenous genes knock-down.

40|$|Verification of Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) optical retrievals is. {{problematic}} in that passage over ground sites is both instantaneous and sparse plus space-borne passive sensors such as MODIS are too frequently {{out of sync}} with the GLAS position. In October 2003, the GLAS Validation Experiment was executed from NASA Dryden Research Center, California to greatly increase validation possibilities. The high-altitude NASA ER- 2 aircraft and onboard instrumentation of Cloud Physics Lidar (CPL), MODIS Airborne Simulator (MAS), and/or MODIS/ASTER Airborne Simulator (MASTER) under-flew seven orbit tracks of GLAS for cirrus, smoke, and urban pollution optical properties inter-comparisons.

5000|$|While all western gorillas are Critically Endangered (in {{the case}} of the western lowland gorilla due in part to Ebola virus), the Cross River gorilla is the most {{endangered}} of the African apes. A 2014 survey estimated that less than 250 mature individuals were left in the wild. However, according to a 2012 survey conducted by Conservation International, the Cross River gorilla did not make [...] "The World’s 25 Most Endangered Primates List". In efforts to conserve other species, it has already been determined that scattered populations should be brought together to prevent inbreeding. One problem with the scattered populations of Cross River gorillas is that they are surrounded by human populations that cause threats such as bushmeat hunting and habitat loss. Also, the protected habitats of Cross River gorillas along the Nigeria-Cameroon border are close to hunting regions, which increases the threat of <b>extinction.</b> The <b>Cross</b> River gorilla is especially significant to the ecosystem because they are excellent seed dispersers for certain tropical plant species that would otherwise face extinction.|$|R

We show that the plasmonic resonance visible in the <b>extinction</b> and absorption <b>cross</b> sections shifts to longer wavelengths and eventually disappears as the mid-plane waist of the composite particle becomes narrower. This process corresponds to an increase of the numbers of internal and scattering modes that are mainly confined {{to the surface and}} coupled to the incident field.

40|$|Whether {{inbreeding}} {{affects the}} demography and persistence of natural populations has been questioned. However, new pedigree data from field populations and molecular and analytical tools for tracing patterns of relationship and inbreeding have now enhanced {{our ability to}} detect inbreeding depression within and among wild populations. This work reveals that levels of inbreeding depression vary across taxa, populations and environments, but are usually substantial enough to affect both individual and population performance. Data from bird and mammal populations suggest that inbreeding depression often significantly affects birth weight, survival, reproduction and resistance to disease, predation and environmental stress. Plant studies, based mostly on comparing populations that differ in size or levels of genetic variation, also reveal significant inbreeding effects on seed set, germination, survival and resistance to stress. Data from butterflies, birds and plants demonstrate that populations with reduced genetic diversity often experience reduced growth and increased <b>extinction</b> rates. <b>Crosses</b> between such populations often result in heterosis. Such a genetic rescue effect might reflect the masking of fixed deleterious mutations. Thus, it might be necessary to retain gene flow among increasingly fragmented habitat patches to sustain populations that are sensitive to inbreeding...|$|R
