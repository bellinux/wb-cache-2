In a racing boat the boom outhaul runs from the sail clew through a turning block along the inside of the boom and out through another turning bock at the <b>fore</b> <b>end</b> of the boom. For simplicity many small racing craft have the boom outhaul attached to a powerful hyfield lever mounted on the boom or deck. The lever is let off for down wind sailing, so the main sail becomes full. Alternatively the outhaul tail can be attached to a block and tackle system so that it can be adjusted to many positions.|$|E

50|$|As to the Saar {{question}} the SPS leaders maintained their position, cherishing {{the idea of}} a cooperative Europe, and promoted to vote for the Saar statute in the 1955 Saar referendum. This, of course, was not without criticism from within the party, which led to long-lasting and embittered controversies among the party members. Whereas a first attempt of the pro-German faction within the SPS, led by Ernst Roth, to bring their opinion to the <b>fore</b> <b>ended</b> by the total isolation of Roth, finally forced to resign {{as a member of the}} party's executive, a second attempt in 1951 led by Kurt Conrad gained enough support so that Conrad ran as a candidate for the party chairmanship against Kirn, and another pro-German candidate for the deputy chairmanship. Also this attempt failed, but Kirn was only reelected against a visible minority of nays. Although the pro-German faction was growing Kirn initiated the procedure to exclude Conrad from the party. He anticipated this by quitting it.|$|R

2500|$|HMS Victoria, {{flagship}} of the Mediterranean fleet, was {{in retrospect}} an unlucky ship. In January 1892 {{she was at}} Platea in Greece carrying out exercises firing torpedoes, when she ran aground on Snipe Point. Tryon was not on board, as the fleet ships went individually for torpedo practice. This involved firing torpedoes while travelling at speed, but was made more difficult {{by the need to}} conduct the practices in shallow waters so the torpedoes could be recovered. Captain Bourke had sent men to mark the point where the waters shallowed to ten fathoms, but they had misjudged the buoy's proper position. Victoria ran aground at nine knots, leaving the <b>fore</b> <b>end</b> of the ship seven feet higher out of the water than normal, while the stern still had 66 feet of water beneath it. The ship was secured with anchors and unsuccessful attempts were made by the nearby [...] torpedo-depot ship to tow her free. Tryon arrived from Malta on board the Surprise, having given orders for the dockyard tug Sampson, Phaeton, Edinburgh, Dreadnought, Scout and Humber to come to assist. Victoria was refloated six days after grounding, towed by Dreadnought and Edinburgh, with the tug lashed to her side and her own engines running astern. 1200 tons had been removed from the ship to lighten her. Victoria returned to Malta for repairs to torn plates along her bottom.|$|E
2500|$|Penn 's {{commanding}} officer, Commander J.H. Swain RN, offered Captain Mason a tow {{with a heavy}} 10-inch {{manila hemp}} rope. With the tow line in place, Penn moved ahead, straining its engines to the limit; Ohio continued to list to port. The two ships were not making any progress, even drifting backwards due to the easterly wind. Now both ships were sitting ducks, and as another serious attack developed, the destroyer went to full speed to part the tow. A German bomber dived on the tanker and was shot down by Ohio 's gunners, but just before its demise, the aircraft's crew released its cargo. A bomb hit the tanker just where the initial torpedo had hit her, effectively breaking her back, just as night was setting in. The ship was abandoned for the night. The day after, Penn was joined by the minesweeper [...] The two ships towed the tanker and succeeded in making up to five knots, overcoming the tendency to swing to port. Another attack blasted the group of ships, snapping the tow lines and immobilising Ohios rudder. Another bomb hit the <b>fore</b> <b>end</b> of the front deck, forcing the engineers out of the engine room. Once more, Mason gave the order to abandon ship, as two more air attacks narrowly missed the tanker. A superficial examination showed that the rent that had developed in the amidships section had widened and that the ship had indeed almost certainly broken her back.|$|E

We may note that in types which swim through the water, the neck dose not appear-- in the fish and frog, for instance-- and the head simply widens out as one passes back to the body.

Are they epistemic, i. e. do they reflect our ignorance of the exact state of a system, or objective, {{in the sense that}} they represent relative frequencies of some sort? Are there perhaps other options? These questions are central in Guttmann's book. The core of the book is formed by the discussion of four positions, spread over epistemic and objective interpretations of probability, which all get a "charitable exposition" (to use Guttmann's words) but are in the end dismissed. In the fifth chapter, emerging from the foregoing discussion, three di#erent solution schemes come to the <b>fore.</b> The book <b>ends</b> with three appendices containing varied background information.

25|$|The {{vessel was}} built by a method of {{construction}} known as shell-first or plating, meaning that the frame was built first with the later addition of a skeleton. It was, however, not built entirely shell-first, but involved some elements of skeleton or frame-first construction. The keel, extended by a long <b>fore</b> foot <b>ending</b> with a concave stempost tilted towards the back, was laid first, then edge jointed by mortise (10 to 12cm deep and 8cm wide) and tenon (20 to 22cm long, 8cm wide, and 1.5cm thick), construction to three strakes. This first section of the ship, the keel and the first three planks, was made from elm. Floor timbers were then bolted directly to the keel, giving greater rigidity to the internal skeleton. Next, {{the rest of the}} framing was added, joined with straight nails and treenails. These few early frames acted as guides and supports during construction. Then, the rest of the planking was added, the lower skeleton first, followed by the upper shell (independent of the frames, with treenails inserted from inside the hull). Futtocks were inserted last and a second skin of thinner planks of fir was fitted to the exterior of the ship and covered in lead. A layer of planks, 6cm thick, was also fitted inside in order to cover the internal frames, strengthening the hull through double planking and elaborate, complex keel scarves. A massive cutwater, over a length of 1.45m, placed against the front-butt protected and strengthened the stern of the axial frame.|$|R
