5|$|The {{first record}} of {{football}} being played on Tyneside dates from 3 March 1877 at Elswick Rugby Club. Later that year, Newcastle's first football club, Tyne Association, was formed. The origins of Newcastle United Football Club {{itself can be}} traced back to the formation of a football club by the Stanley Cricket Club of Byker in November 1881. This team was renamed Newcastle <b>East</b> <b>End</b> F.C. in October 1882, to avoid confusion with the cricket club in Stanley, County Durham. Rosewood F.C. of Byker merged with Newcastle <b>East</b> <b>End</b> a short time later. In 1886, Newcastle <b>East</b> <b>End</b> moved from Byker to Heaton. In August 1882, Newcastle West End F.C. formed from West End Cricket Club, and in May 1886, the club moved into St James' Park. The two clubs became rivals in the Northern League. In 1889, Newcastle <b>East</b> <b>End</b> became a professional team, before becoming a limited company the following March. However, on the other hand, Newcastle West End were in serious financial trouble and approached <b>East</b> <b>End</b> with a view to a take over. Newcastle West End were eventually dissolved, and a number of their players and backroom staff joined Newcastle <b>East</b> <b>End,</b> effectively merging the two clubs, with Newcastle <b>East</b> <b>End</b> taking over the lease on St James' Park in May 1892.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>East</b> <b>Ends</b> were on {{the verge}} of winning the 1903 OIC on a common-opponent tiebreaker over the Shelby Blues. However, the Massillon Tigers began making a run for the title. Akron {{initially}} dismissed Massillon, telling them to [...] "go play for a couple of years" [...] before trying to challenge the <b>East</b> <b>Ends.</b> However, Akron was unable to match Massillon's margin of victory over Canton. The <b>East</b> <b>Ends</b> defeated Canton 17-6, while Massillon defeated that same team 16-0. Akron felt compelled to play and beat Massillon and prove itself worthy of the state title. A game was scheduled and <b>East</b> <b>Ends</b> appeared to be in luck when several Massillon starters fell victim to injury. However, the Tigers replaced its injured stars by buying the roster of the Pittsburgh Stars, the champions of the 1902 National Football League. In a game that had the feel of being one step short of a full-out riot, Akron lost to Massillon, 11-0, for the Ohio Independent Championship.|$|R
