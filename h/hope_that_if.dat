5|$|The victory gave Auburn fans <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> Oklahoma won the 2005 BCS National Championship Game, a split {{national}} championship would result. By contract, {{the winner of}} the BCS National Championship Game is voted number one in the USA Today Coaches' Poll. In contrast, the Associated Press poll has no such restriction. Auburn's thin margin of victory over Tech put the prospect of split national title in doubt, though not out of reach. USC's blowout 55â€“19 victory over Oklahoma, however, made it likely that USC would be the overwhelming choice for first place. When the final college football polls of the season were released, USC was voted number one by a large margin, though three voters in the Associated Press poll voted Auburn first. More than three years after the game, ESPN sportswriter Ted Miller rated the game second on his list of victims of the BCS system, just behind USC being left out of the championship game in 2003.|$|E
25|$|The {{evolutionary}} history is finished. The endeavour is complete. If you'd asked me 20 years ago whether we'd be attempting such a mammoth task, I'd have said 'Don't be ridiculous'. These programmes tell a particular story and I'm sure others will {{come along and}} tell it much better than I did, but I do <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> people watch it in 50 years' time, it will still {{have something to say}} about the world we live in.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the fact}} that skirmishes and battles have begun, the Jews at this stage {{are still trying to}} contain the {{fighting}} to as narrow a sphere as possible in the hope that partition will be implemented and a Jewish government formed; they <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the fighting remains limited, the Arabs will acquiesce in the fait accompli. This can be seen from {{the fact that}} the Jews have not so far attacked Arab villages unless the inhabitants of those villages attacked them or provoked them first.|$|E

25|$|A {{search of}} Chikatilo's {{belongings}} revealed {{he had been}} in possession of a folding knife and two lengths of rope. A sample of Chikatilo's blood was taken, and he was placed in a cell inside the KGB headquarters in Rostov with a police informer, who was instructed to engage Chikatilo in conversation and elicit any information he could from him. The next day, 21 November, formal questioning of Chikatilo began. The interrogation was performed by Issa Kostoyev. The strategy chosen by the police to elicit a confession was to lead Chikatilo to believe that he was a very sick man in need of medical help. The intention was to give Chikatilo <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> he confessed, he would not be prosecuted by reason of insanity. Police knew their case against Chikatilo was largely circumstantial, and under Soviet law, they had 10 days in which they could legally hold a suspect before either charging or releasing him.|$|E
500|$|Kurt {{introduces}} {{his father}} to Finn's mother Carole (Romy Rosemont) in the <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the two began dating, it would bring Kurt closer to Finn. Finn is initially unhappy when he finds out his mother is in a serious relationship, but he soon bonds with Burt over sports and other traditionally masculine activities. Kurt, who becomes jealous over their growing relationship, briefly attempts to reclaim his father's attention by acting more masculine: he imitates Burt's style of dress, asks him for advice on performing songs by his favorite artist, John Mellencamp, and arranges to have Burt walk in on him kissing cheerleader and glee club member Brittany Pierce (Heather Morris). In the episode [...] "Theatricality", Burt invites Carole and Finn {{to move in with}} him and Kurt. Aware of Kurt's attraction to him, Finn is uncomfortable with sharing a bedroom with Kurt. In the hopes of pleasing Finn, Kurt redecorates their bedroom, but Finn is appalled by its fancy appearance and lack of privacy. During the ensuing argument, when Kurt refuses to acknowledge his infatuation, Finn loses his temper and calls the new furnishings [...] "faggy". Burt overhears Finn's words, angrily berates Finn, and throws him out. However, {{at the end of the}} episode, when two bullies are about to attack Kurt, Finn redeems himself by defending him.|$|E

2500|$|The {{question}} of nonsingularity of the varieties [...] and [...] appearing above {{is an important}} one. It seems natural to <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> we start with smooth , then we can always find a minimal model or Fano fibre space inside the category of smooth varieties. However, [...] this is not true, and so it becomes necessary to consider singular varieties also. The singularities that appear are called terminal singularities.|$|E

2500|$|In 2002, {{the tenth}} issue of McSweeney's Quarterly was guest edited by Michael Chabon. Published as McSweeney's Mammoth Treasury of Thrilling Tales, it is a {{collection}} of [...] "pulp fiction" [...] stories written by such current well-known authors as Stephen King, Nick Hornby, Aimee Bender and Dave Eggers. Explaining his vision for the project, Chabon wrote in the introduction, [...] "I think that we have forgotten how much fun reading a short story can be, and I <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> nothing else, this treasury goes some small distance toward reminding us of that lost but fundamental truth." ...|$|E

2500|$|On October 28, 2005, Fitzgerald {{brought an}} {{indictment}} for 5 counts of false statements, perjury, {{and obstruction of}} justice against Lewis [...] "Scooter" [...] Libby, U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney's Chief of Staff. Libby resigned to prepare for his legal defense. In his first press conference after announcing Libby's indictment, Fitzgerald was asked about comments by Republicans such as Kay Bailey Hutchison, who said [...] "I certainly <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> {{there is going to be}} an indictment that says something happened, that it is an indictment on a crime and not some perjury technicality..." [...] to which Fitzgerald responded, [...] "That talking point won't fly... The truth is the engine of our judicial system.

2500|$|Verdi had {{received}} a synopsis of the opera from Cammarano, the subject of which was not his. [...] But, as Budden notes, Verdi adopted a somewhat passive attitude, impressed as he was at being {{able to work with}} this librettist. In a letter of 23 February 1845, Verdi had expressed his optimism that [...] "Voltaire's tragedy will become an excellent melodrama," [...] with the added <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the librettist would [...] "put some passion into your libretto" [...] and that he, Verdi, would write music to match. In their early correspondence, it appears that Cammarano had already sent some sample verses because Verdi's 23 February letter also contained his enthusiasm for receiving more: [...] "I beg you to send me promptly some more verses. It's not necessary for me to tell you to keep it short. You know the theatre better than I do." [...] It is quite clear that Verdi's characteristic requirement for brevity appeared this early on in his career.|$|E
2500|$|In 1943, after General Sir Bernard Montgomery took {{command of}} 21st Army Group, he {{requested}} that Strangeways {{take charge of}} R-Force, another deception force organised {{along the lines of}} A Force for the Allied invasion of France. Strangeways chose the name R Force in the <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the Germans discovered it, they might assume that the R stood for reconnaissance. Indeed, it could operate as one, as it was equipped with three companies of light scout cars and a support company. These were equipped with special speakers so they could emulate the sounds of tanks in battle. R Force took over a number of Royal Engineers camouflage units. To their number was added personnel from [...] "Turner's Department", a deception organisation led by Colonel John Turner, that been engaged in the construction of decoy airfields and other military sites. No. 5 Wireless Group was formed in January 1944 to provide R Force with a communications deception capability. Equipped with special radios and recording devices, it could simulate the radio traffic of a corps. R Force's strength eventually rose to over 1,200. Royal Signals personnel serving with the unit wore a sleeve patch with a white R on a black background, while Royal Engineers wore one with a blue background.|$|E

2500|$|Rose claimed [...] "the {{reason we}} didn't list that song on our album is {{we wanted to}} downplay it. We don't give any credit to Charles Manson on the album; it's like a hidden bonus truck [...]" [...] The band {{considered}} removing the song from new pressings of the album, and David Geffen stated in a phone interview, [...] "I would <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> Axl Rose had realized how offensive people would find this, {{he would not have}} ever recorded this song in the first place. The fact that Charles Manson would be earning money based on the fame he derived committing one of the most horrific crimes of the 20th Century is unthinkable to me". Slash mentioned that the song was [...] "done with naive and innocent black humor on our part". Rose stated he would donate all performance royalties from the song to a nonprofit environmental organization. Slash stated that the group intended to remove the song before the band decided to keep it after learning that royalties from the song would be donated to the Bartek Frykowski, the son of Wojciech Frykowski, a victim of Manson during the Tate Murders. Geffen Records released a statement mentioning that the label's share of royalties would be donated to the Doris Tate Crime Victims Bureau. Years later, Rose said the song would be removed from new pressings of the album, claiming that critics and the media had misinterpreted his interest in Manson. Rose can be seen wearing a Manson shirt in the video for [...] "Estranged" [...] and during a concert in Milton Keynes, England, in 1993. Rose explained wearing the shirt as [...] "trying to make a statement" [...] because [...] "a lot of people enjoy playing me as the bad guy and the crazy. Sorry, I'm not that guy. I'm nothing like him." [...] Despite the statement that the track would be removed, [...] "Look at Your Game, Girl" [...] is still featured on pressings of the album.|$|E
