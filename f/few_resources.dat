5|$|Following the Dunkirk {{evacuation}} in 1940, Britain faced {{a shortage}} of weapons. In particular, there was a severe scarcity of anti-tank weapons, many of {{which had to be}} left behind in France. One of the <b>few</b> <b>resources</b> not in short supply was petroleum oil since supplies intended for Europe were filling British storage facilities.|$|E
5|$|One of the <b>few</b> <b>resources</b> not {{in short}} supply was {{petroleum}} oil; supplies intended for Europe were filling British storage facilities. Considerable effort and enthusiasm was put into making use of petroleum products as a weapon of war. The Army had not had flame-throwers since the First World War, but a significant number were improvised from pressure greasing equipment acquired from automotive repair garages. Although limited in range, they were reasonably effective.|$|E
5|$|While Philip V {{was busy}} {{fighting}} Rome's Greek allies, Rome viewed {{this as an}} opportunity to punish this former ally of Hannibal with a war that they hoped would supply a victory and require <b>few</b> <b>resources.</b> The Roman Senate demanded that PhilipV cease hostilities against neighboring Greek powers and defer to an international arbitration committee for settling grievances. When the comitia centuriata finally voted in approval of the Roman Senate's declaration of war in 200BC and handed their ultimatum to PhilipV, demanding that a tribunal assess the damages owed to Rhodes and Pergamon, the Macedonian king rejected it. This marked the beginning of the Second Macedonian War (200–197BC), with Publius Sulpicius Galba Maximus spearheading military operations in Apollonia.|$|E
50|$|The Toilet Paper Entrepreneur {{philosophy}} {{is based on}} the notion thatnot only can one start a business with <b>fewer</b> <b>resources,</b> but thathaving <b>fewer</b> <b>resources</b> can actually work to your benefit. Forexample, having <b>fewer</b> <b>resources</b> can force the business to address an issue in highly innovative ways versus simply spending money blindly to solve it.|$|R
5000|$|Not surprisingly, {{women with}} <b>fewer</b> <b>resources</b> {{indicate}} {{a higher level}} of postpartum depression and stress than those women with more financial resources. Rates of PPD have been shown to decrease as income increases. [...] Women with <b>fewer</b> <b>resources</b> {{may be more likely to}} have an unintended or unwanted pregnancy, increasing risk of PPD. Single mothers of low income may have <b>fewer</b> <b>resources</b> to which they have access while transitioning into motherhood.|$|R

5|$|Women and men {{differ in}} their {{chromosomal}} makeup, protein gene products, genomic imprinting, gene expression, signaling pathways, and hormonal environment. All of these necessitate caution in extrapolating information derived from biomarkers from one sex to the other. Women are particularly vulnerable at the two extremes of life. Young women and adolescents are at risk from STIs, pregnancy and unsafe abortion, while older women often have <b>few</b> <b>resources</b> and are disadvantaged with respect to men, and also {{are at risk of}} dementia and abuse, and generally poor health.|$|E
5|$|Another {{aspect of}} the kakapo's {{breeding}} system is that a female can alter the sex ratio of her offspring depending on her condition. A female who eats protein-rich foods produces more male offspring (males have 30%–40% more body weight than females). Females produce offspring biased towards the dispersive sex when competition for resources (such as food) is high and towards the non-dispersive sex when food is plentiful. A female kakapo will likely {{be able to produce}} eggs even when there are <b>few</b> <b>resources,</b> while a male kakapo will be more capable of perpetuating the species when there are plenty, by mating with several females. This supports the Trivers–Willard hypothesis. The relationship between clutch sex ratio and maternal diet has conservation implications, because a captive population maintained on a high quality diet will produce fewer females and therefore fewer individuals valuable to the recovery of the species.|$|E
5|$|Favaloro became {{interested}} in developments in cardiovascular intervention, and developed an enthusiasm for thoracic surgery. During one visit to La Plata, he met Professor Mainetti, who pointed him {{in the direction of}} the Cleveland Clinic. Although in the beginning he had doubts about leaving his profession as a rural physician, he thought that he could make a greater contribution to the community on returning from the United States. With <b>few</b> <b>resources</b> and rudimentary English, he decided to travel to Cleveland. He first worked as a resident and later as a member of the surgical team, working with Donald B. Effler, head of cardiovascular surgery, F. Mason Sones, Jr., who was in charge of the Angiography Laboratory and William L. Proudfit, head of the Department of Cardiology.|$|E

5|$|In Cuba, {{the storm}} caused {{hundreds}} of deaths, capsized dozens of ships, obliterated buildings, uprooted trees, and ruined crops. Many towns were wholly destroyed or flattened and never recovered, while others disappeared entirely. Damage in the United States was considerably better-chronicled despite being less severe. In Key West, widespread destruction was noted, with 40deaths, many vessels rendered unfit, and widespread structural damage, with several buildings swept off of their foundations {{and hundreds of}} others flattened. Few supplies arrived in the following days and relief efforts were gradual, with <b>few</b> <b>resources</b> within the town's vicinity. Along other sections of the Southeastern U.S. coast, copious rainfall and moderate winds impacted agriculture, shipping, and residences. As the storm tracked along the Middle-Atlantic coast, similar effects were reported: there, the gale inundated many areas, impeded communications, destroyed railroads and canals, and flattened structures. Despite extensive damage, only two deaths were recorded outside Cuba and Florida. Along its entire track, the hurricane caused $338,000 in losses and at least 164deaths.|$|E
5|$|The {{siege of}} Krujë in 1450 {{resulted}} in heavy loss for both Murad II and the League of Lezhë. A {{large portion of}} the Albanian land was wasted from the long campaign where the Turkish forces had been stationed {{for more than half a}} year. The country was left with <b>few</b> <b>resources</b> to produce crops and a large famine was the result. In 1451, the year after Murad's forces had devastated the country, Mehmed II gained control of the Ottoman Empire after his father's death. Mehmed's great energy was already apparent during the previous years when he had accompanied his father to Albania. Skanderbeg realized that if Mehmed struck now, he would be in great difficulty since he lacked the resources and the support to successfully hold off a large invasion. One of Albania's most powerful princedoms, the Dukagjini, were making open negotiations with the Turks, suggesting that they would become Mehmed's vassals.|$|E

25|$|In early January the Haganah adopted Operation Zarzir, {{a scheme}} to assassinate leaders {{affiliated}} to Amin al-Husayni, placing the blame on other Arab leaders, but in practice <b>few</b> <b>resources</b> were devoted to the project and the only attempted killing was of Nimr al Khatib.|$|E

25|$|Resource {{theory was}} {{suggested}} by William Goode (1971). Women {{who are most}} dependent on the spouse for economic well being (e.g. homemakers/housewives, women with handicaps, the unemployed), and are the primary caregiver to their children, fear the increased financial burden if they leave their marriage. Dependency means that they have fewer options and <b>few</b> <b>resources</b> to help them cope with or change their spouse's behavior.|$|E
25|$|Until the {{collapse}} of the federal government in 1991, the organizational and administrative structure of Somalia's healthcare sector was overseen by the Ministry of Health. Regional medical officials enjoyed some authority, but healthcare was largely centralized. The socialist government of former President of Somalia Siad Barre had put an end to private medical practice in 1972. Much of the national budget was devoted to military expenditure, leaving <b>few</b> <b>resources</b> for healthcare, among other services.|$|E
