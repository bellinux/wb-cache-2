500|$|Dorsiflexion and plantar flexion {{refer to}} {{extension}} or flexion {{of the foot}} at the ankle.

These terms are used to resolve confusion, as technically extension of the joint refers to dorsiflexion, which could be considered counter-intuitive as the motion reduces the angle between <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> leg.|$|R

5|$|The coat of {{the breed}} {{come in a}} variety of shades with the colours being {{separated}} into three main groups: black/black and tan, any solid colour other than black (ASCOB), and parti-colour. The black variety is either all black, or with tan points on the dog's head, the <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> tail in a pattern called black and tan. The group known as ASCOB includes all other solid colours from light cream through to dark red, although some lighter colouring is allowed on the feathering according to standards. Parti-coloured dogs are white with patches of another colour such as black or brown, and includes any roan coloured dogs. In addition, American Cockers coats can come in a pattern known as merle, which is not recognised by the American Kennel Club.|$|E
5|$|Pipistrellus raceyi is a {{small to}} {{medium-sized}} pipistrelle. It is long-furred and the body is reddish above, with the head a trifle darker, and yellowish-brown below. The glandular swellings on the muzzle, next to the nose, are hairless. The dark, short, round ears bear three to five ridges. The crescent-shaped tragus (a projection {{on the inner side}} of the outer ear) is about half as long as the ear and contains a slight constriction on the back side of its base. The wings are dark. The third through fifth metacarpals (hand bones) are about equally long, but the first phalange (finger bone) on the third finger is short. P.endoi has a longer first phalange on the third metacarpal. P.raceyi has short tibiae (lower leg bones) and small <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> tail is shorter than the head and body. Forearm length is 28.0 to 31.2mm (1.10 to 1.23in), tail length is 22.9 to 30.3mm (0.90 to 1.19in), hindfoot length is 5.3 to 7.5mm (0.21 to 0.30in), and ear length is 7.5 to 10.6mm (0.30 to 0.42in) in 13 measured specimens. Females average slightly larger than males.|$|E

5|$|The {{face and}} the upper lips are reddish to pink, not dark brown to black as in M.mystacinus. Although most of the face is hairy, {{the area around the}} eyes is bare. The {{nostrils}} are heart-shaped, and their back end is broad, as in M.brandtii, not narrow as in M.mystacinus. Several glands are present on the muzzle, most prominently in reproductively active males. The ears are brown and are lighter on the inside than the outside. There is a notch {{at the edge of the}} ear, and the pointed tragus (a projection inside the ear that is present in some bats) extends up to this notch; the tragus is longer, extending beyond the notch, in both M.brandtii and M.mystacinus. The base of the inner side of the ear is white; it is much darker in M.mystacinus. The <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> thumbs are very small. The small size of the ear, tragus, feet, and thumb distinguishes M.alcathoe from the slightly larger M.mystacinus and M.brandtii, but the feet are relatively larger than in M.mystacinus.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} focused {{on the effects of}} trunk {{extensor}} muscles fatigue on postural control during quiet standing under different somatosensory conditions from <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ankle. With this aim, 20 young healthy adults were asked to stand as immobile as possible in two conditions of No fatigue and Fatigue of trunk extensor muscles. In Experiment 1 (n = 10), somatosensation from <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ankle was degraded by standing on a foam surface. In Experiment 2 (n = 10), somatosensation from <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> ankle was facilitated through the increased cutaneous feedback at <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> ankle provided by strips of athletic tape applied across both ankle joints. The centre of foot pressure displacements (CoP) were recorded using a force platform. The results showed that (1) trunk extensor muscles fatigue increased CoP displacements under normal somatosensatory conditions (Experiment 1 and Experiment 2), (2) this destabilizing effect was exacerbated when somatosensation from <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ankle was degraded (Experiment 1), and (3) this destabilizing effect was mitigated when somatosensation from <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ankle was facilitated (Experiment 2). Altogether, the present findings evidenced re-weighting of sensory cues for controlling posture during quiet standing following trunk extensor muscles fatigue by increasing the reliance on the somatosensory inputs from <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ankle. This could have implications in clinical and rehabilitative areas...|$|R

50|$|Those who overpronate tend to {{push off}} almost {{completely}} from <b>the</b> big toe <b>and</b> second toe.
