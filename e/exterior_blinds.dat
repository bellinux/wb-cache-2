5000|$|The {{northern}} part of the house with overlooks the Narrows probably was considered the [...] "front" [...] {{in the same manner as}} were the facades of houses built facing the Hudson River. The main feature of this side of the house is the long open veranda with flat wooden posts of diamond trelliage and small paired brackets above the ornamental jigsaw work along the edge of the roof. Full length casement windows which have frames with crossetted corners open onto the veranda from the various first-floor* rooms, and centered in each of the three—sided bays is a handsome French door with a demi-lune transom. The outer edges of these two openings are decorated with continuous narrow borders of ruby-red glass. All the windows of the house, as well as the French doors, were originally equipped with wooden louvered <b>exterior</b> <b>blinds,</b> hut these have been removed except for a few which cover spaces that were designed as false windows.|$|E
40|$|The new {{headquarters}} of Y Soft {{is divided into}} three objects, both functional and visual. The main building consists of a five-storey block with an internal atrium, followed by a ribbed three-storey structure. The entire complex ends one-storey production, half-floored in the slope. The playful facade of the first object complements the regular lines of the ribbed object. The facade is faced by the same manufacturer with the same pattern, but with another shade, gray and brown. The third facade is made of concrete. All three buildings unify the same material and color of window frames and the type of <b>exterior</b> <b>blinds...</b>|$|E
50|$|The Catholic Church of Maria Himmelfahrt {{was built}} in 1705-11 by Bartholomaus Schmid. The baroque {{building}} has <b>exterior</b> <b>blind</b> arches, like the same architect's parish church in Andermatt.|$|R
50|$|The chancel and {{half-round}} apse {{date from}} the 12th century with the <b>exterior</b> featuring <b>blind</b> arcades with typical Norman arches. The church was granted by Ness son of William, Lord of Leuchars, to the canons of St Andrews in 1185. Around 1700 a belfry was added, and in 1858 restoration was carried out to the nave.|$|R
40|$|Blind {{systems have}} been {{introduced}} to provide visual and thermal comfort, {{as well as to}} reduce energy use in buildings. A wide variety of such systems exist in terms of thermal and optical properties, location (exterior, interior), and physical configuration (size, distance between the blind slats). The current problem with blinds is that their operation is not based on the dynamics of the room (space), but on the static or manual control operated by occupants, although many studies have recognized that dynamic control can far outperform static control. One reason for the lack of dynamic control {{is that it is not}} easy to combine the room dynamics with any possible optimization algorithm. Hence, in this study, a whole building simulation tool, EnergyPlus, was integrated with MATLAB optimization toolbox to solve for optimal control of blind systems. This paper addresses the difference between static vs. dynamic control of interior and <b>exterior</b> <b>blind</b> systems in office buildings...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Background: Sentani is a {{district}} {{in the southern part}} of Jayapura, Papua, Indonesia. This district rich of zeolite that is mostly consist of mordenite (CaNa 2 K 2) Al 2 Si 10 O 24 with degree of crystallinity of 53. 14 % (analyzed with X-R Diffractogram). Polyethylene composite with natural zeolite fillers will have a high hardness, so it can be used as a rigid and hard plastic packaging. This study aimed to analyze zeolite-polyethylene composite which is could be used as plastic pipes and <b>exterior</b> <b>blinds</b> which has the characteristics of weather resistant and high hardness. Methods: Zeolite-polyethylen composite was prepared by blending polyethylene with natural zeolite as filler. The composition of zeolite used was varied from 1 to 65 % w/w polyethylene. The zeolite grain size – 150 + 200 mesh was blended at 18...|$|E
40|$|Traditional dynamic shading {{systems are}} usually driven by {{electricity}} for continuously controlling {{the angle of}} blind slats to minimize the indoor solar heat gain over times. This paper proposed a novel design of buoyancy driven dynamic shading system, using only minimum amount of electricity. The energy performance and the improved thermal comfort induced by the system were simulated by EnergyPlus for a typical office space under the context of Taiwanese climate. The design processes are composed of three parts: an alterable angle of blind slats that raises the energy performance to be suitable for every orientation, the buoyancy driven transmission mechanism, and a humanized controller that ensures its convenience. The environmental friendly design aspects and control mechanisms to fulfill demands for manufacturing, assembling, maintenance and recycling, etc., were also presented as readily for building application. Besides, the effectiveness of cooling energy saving and thermal comfort enhancing were compared against the cases without <b>exterior</b> <b>blinds</b> and with traditional fixed blinds installed. The {{results show that the}} cooling energy is drastically reduced over times and the blind system is effectively enhancing the indoor thermal comfort...|$|E
40|$|Currently, {{there is}} no manual blind control {{guideline}} used consistently throughout the energy modeling community. This paper identifies and compares five manual blind control algorithms with unique control patterns and reports blind occlusion, rate of change data, and annual building energy consumption. The blind control schemes detailed here represent five reasonable candidates for use in lighting and energy simulation based on difference driving factors. This study was performed on a medium-sized office building using EnergyPlus with the internal daylight harvesting engine. Results show that applying manual blind control algorithms affects the total annual consumption of the building {{by as much as}} 12. 5 % and 11. 5 % for interior and <b>exterior</b> <b>blinds</b> respectively, compared to the Always Retracted blinds algorithm. Peak demand was also compared showing blind algorithms affected zone load sizing by as much as 9. 8 %. The alternate algorithms were tested for their impact on American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Guideline 14 calibration metrics and all models were found to differ from the original calibrated baseline by more than the recommended ± 15 % for coefficient of variance of the mean square error (CVRMSE) and ± 5 % for normalized mean bias error (NMBE). The paper recommends that energy modelers use one or more manual blind control algorithms during design stages when making decisions about energy efficiency and other design alternatives...|$|E
50|$|The Gympie Town Council {{wrote to}} the Department of Public Works in June 1950, {{indicating}} that the town hall was being repainted and suggested that the baby clinic be painted at the same time. Tenders were called in September and the exterior painting proceeded. Some interior painting was also carried out at this time with repairs to the front stairs and front gate, and painting of <b>exterior</b> Venetian <b>blinds.</b> In 1956 the interior walls and furniture was painted. The connection of sewerage in May 1964 led to further alterations and additions to the interior including a complete internal and external repaint, in pastel shades. The bathroom was upgraded with a new bath and hand basins. New cupboards {{were built in the}} kitchen and new linoleum was laid throughout. The furniture was also repainted.|$|R
40|$|As {{a result}} of the {{technological}} advances and increasing focus on energy efficient buildings, simple forms of building automation including automatic motorized blinds systems found their ways into today's office environments. In a five-month field study, qualitative and quantitative methods were used to investigate how office workers in 40 offices experience and use automatically controlled <b>exterior</b> venetian <b>blinds</b> with options for manual override and switching off the automatic mode. In total, 3433 blinds adjustments (average of 0. 86 per office per day) were recorded, of which 73. 6 % was initiated by the user. Significant correlations between weather parameters and blind adjustments were found, including sunshine duration and user-triggered lowering of blinds (R= 0. 354), cloud cover and user-triggered lowering of the blinds (R=- 0. 281), and outside temperature and user-triggered raising of blinds (R=- 0. 266). Four blinds usage profiles were identified and the underlying motivations for the different users were described. In the majority of offices, the automatic mode was switched off...|$|R
50|$|The {{house is}} a {{slightly}} altered example of Gothic Revival architecture interpreted in wood. According to a National Park Service survey, {{the foundation of the}} house is of stuccoed stone and the walls are constructed of wood clapboards. The house has four chimneys. The original cut-out bargeboard trim was removed from the gables around 1907. The front porch was rebuilt with a steeper shingled roof and its Gothic bracing and wooden crockets were removed. The Gothic window over the front porch may have had its sill-level raised. The south side porch was enlarged from a half-octagon shaped protrusion, which had been accessible from only the south parlor window. Its Gothic balustrade, bracing and parapet railing were kept. The original <b>exterior</b> window <b>blinds</b> of the house are stored in the attic. The rear entrance porch was rebuilt in 1963. The original partition separating the front southwest bedroom from a dressing room was removed. The house originally had a wood-shingled roof and was painted light red with darker trim. As of 1979, the house was painted white with black trim.|$|R
40|$|Social Housing {{and energy}} {{performance}} in a study case in Queimados within the Programa Minha Casa Minha Vida: analysis and proposals for improvement. The thesis in based on a personal experience lived in Brazil, working with a firm that deals {{with the construction of}} housing, for the population with incomes between 1. 600 R and 3. 100 R per month, in the Programa Minha Casa Minha Vida. Thanks to the construction site and contact with the local people, it was possible to attend to the construction phases and to understand {{the pros and cons of}} this Program. Working with the company made also possible to know the costs of the construction and to see that they reached the limit budget imposed by the Program (160. 000 R). Between the critical aspects of the program there is the fact that it doesn’t deal with the energy consumptions of buildings. For that reason it was interesting to calculate the energy requirements for cooling- using the software EnergyPlus and Legacy Opens Studio plug-in for Google Sketchup- and, later, to try to propose ideas for improving performances and reduce energy consumption introducing: increase in the wall mass, frame windows and patio doors, <b>exterior</b> <b>blinds,</b> wall shading on the west side. From the analysis of these simulations, considering the decrease of energy requirements for cooling, the decrease of operative and mean radiant temperatures and costs, the most convenient proposal was the exterior curtain. As all these assumptions were too expensive for the program it was analyzed how the behavior of the inhabitants influence energy consumption. Thinking of an intelligent ventilation –opening windows while the outside temperature is lower than the inside one- the reduction of energy requirements is about 27...|$|E
40|$|The Competition {{involved}} {{actions on}} two contiguous blocks of housing, {{one of them}} with serious structural problems that requiered its demolition and replacement with a new bioclimatic building, The other building was renovated by environmental and accessibility alterations. After the initial study {{of the study of}} the climate and environment, the design decisions matched these conditiosn in order to achieve a better environemental sustainability together with other technical, formal and social values. In both blocks, yhe bad orientation of the existing blocks (with fa&# 231;ades to the east and west) han been corrected, folding the skin of the building to capture sunligth to the interior in winter and provide protection in the summer, creating a series of &# 226;&# 128;&# 156;climatisation galleries&# 226;&# 128;&# 157; with capture windows facing south-east in the living rooms of the houses. These galleries are protected by shading elements on the glass which prevent the greenhouse effect in summer and are protected by <b>exterior</b> <b>blinds</b> that also create shade and chambers that prevent cooling by cold air convection outside in the winter. The exterio woodwork consist of profiles that break the thermal brigde and double glazing with low emissions treatment. In the new block, to improve the summer conditions inside the houses and taking into account that active cooling is needed on a few days of the year when temperatures are high, natual cooling chimneys have been provided. Ther are two types of fa&# 231;ade walls, one consisting iof walls with great heat inertia and exterior rendered insulation and the other also within insulation on the exterior layer but with a ventilated chamber finished with prefabricated panels. Together, the buildings achieve a level of insulation an suitability that is about 200 % of the requiered by standards. Total accessibility has been provided for all the new and existing houses and low consumtion lifts installed. El Concurso planteaba la actuaci&# 243;n sobre dos bloques de viviendas contiguos, uno de ellos con graves problemas estructurales, que obligaron a su demolici&# 243;n, ha sido sustituido por un nuevo edificio bioclim&# 225;tico. El otro edificio ha sido objeto de una rehabilitaci&# 243;n para su adecuaci&# 243;n medioambiental y de accesibilidad. Tras el estudio previo del clima y del entorno, las decisiones sobre el dise&# 241;o correspond&# 237;an a estas condiciones de manera que se logra la mejor adecuaci&# 243;n ambiental junto con otros valores t&# 233;cnicos, formales y sociales. En ambos bloques la mala orientaci&# 243;n de los bloques existentes (con fachadas al Este y Oeste), ha sido corregida, plegando la piel del edificio para conseguir la captaci&# 243;n de radiaci&# 243;n solar hacia el interior en invierno y su protecci&# 243;n en verano, creando una serie de &# 226;&# 128;&# 156;galer&# 237;as de climatizaci&# 243;n&# 226;&# 128;&# 157;, con ventanas captoras orientadas a sureste en zonas de estancia de las viviendas. Estas galer&# 237;as est&# 225;n protegidas por elementos de sombra sobre los vidrios que eliminan el efecto invernadero en verano y quedan protegidas por persianas exteriores que tambi&# 233;n dan sombra y crean c&# 225;maras que evitan el enfriamiento por convenci&# 243;n del aire fr&# 237;o exterior en invierno. Las carpinter&# 237;as exteriores est&# 225;n realizadas con perfiles que consiguen la rotura del puente t&# 233;rmico y acristaladas con vidrio doble de baja emisividad. En el edificio de nueva planta, para mejorar las condiciones de verano en el interior de las viviendas y teniendo en cuenta que har&# 237;a falta una refrigeraci&# 243;n activa unos pocos d&# 237;as al a&# 241;o en los que las temperaturas m&# 225;ximas se elevan, se han previsto unas chimeneas de refrigeraci&# 243;n natural. Se han realizado dos tipos de cerramiento de fachada: una, compuesta por muros de gran inercia t&# 233;rmica con aislamiento exterior revocado, y otra, tambi&# 233;n con el aislamiento en la capa exterior, pero con c&# 225;mara ventilada acabada con paneles prefabricados. El conjunto de los edificios consigue un nivel de aislamiento y adecuaci&# 243;n superior en un 200 % al exigible por normativa. Para todas las viviendas nuevas y ya existentes, se ha conseguido accesibilidad total a las mismas, y la dotaci&# 243;n de ascensores de bajo consumo...|$|E
50|$|The {{church has}} three apses, an {{arrangement}} also seen in Sicily at Monreale Cathedral. The two lower side apses {{have the upper}} tiers of the <b>exterior</b> decorated by <b>blind</b> arcading of small crossed arches and sculpted corbels, also seen used extensively at Monreale. The corbels date from 1215-1223 and portray masks, heads of animals and human figures in contorted positions. The corbels of the central apse are more recent. The central apse originally had three large ocular windows, which were later closed to give space for the mosaic, and a larger central window of ogival shape. Two other pairs of circular windows are located at the transept's ends.|$|R
40|$|The {{construction}} industry has made considerable energy-saving efforts in buildings, and studies of energy-savings are ongoing. Shading {{is used to}} control the solar radiation transferred through windows. Many {{studies have examined the}} position and type of shading in different countries, but few have investigated the effects of shading installation in Korea. In this study, the case of the shading installation according to the standard of Korea, and variations of the heating and cooling load in the unit area on the performance of the windows were examined. This study compared the variations of the heating and cooling load in the case of horizontal shading and the changing position of venetian blinds. This study confirmed that horizontal shading longer than the standard length in Korea saved a maximum of 13 % energy consumption. This study confirmed the point of change of energy consumption by the Solar Heat Gain Coefficient (SHGC) variations. The <b>exterior</b> venetian <b>blinds</b> and those between glazing were unaffected by the SHGC. On the other hand, {{in the case of a}} south façade, the interior venetian blinds resulted in 24 % higher energy consumption than the installation of horizontal shading in case of Window to Wall Ratio (WWR) : 80 %, U-value: 2. 1 and SHGC: 0. 4...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – Solar shading {{devices are}} {{commonly}} used in offices to reduce cooling loads and glare from windows, but they also affect daylighting and the view to the outside. In this study, the function and operation of an awning and an <b>exterior</b> venetian <b>blind</b> {{as well as their}} influence on the view out was assessed by fifty office workers. The preferred position of the shading devices, the interior illumination and the weather conditions were recorded. An interior dimmable lighting fixture was introduced in order {{to see if there was}} a difference between the shading devices regarding the need of complementary electric lighting. The awning was found easier to adjust than the venetian blind. Both shading devices somewhat affected the view to the outside. The shading devices were used frequently to avoid glare from the window. However, preliminary results show no or weak correlation between common lighting concepts such as interior illuminance or sky luminance and how much the shading device was pulled down. On the other hand, there was a weak relationship between the existence of sunlight patches in the room and the position of the shading device. Further, the awning showed to be sensitive to wind, creating a disturbing “flickering” sunlight patch on sunny, windy days. There was no difference between the shading systems in the use of complementary electric lighting. 1...|$|R
40|$|Windows {{are used}} for the visual {{connection}} between indoors and outdoors, ventilation and daylight of our interiors and for the reduction of our heating energy through solar energy utilization. This solar energy, however, is often so intense that counter measures should be taken {{in order to maintain}} comfortable indoor conditions. Air conditioning is one counteraction. In order to reduce the cooling loads, it is highly recommended to use shading devices. When shading devices are applied in combination with the glass they can modify the thermal effect of windows to a very great extent. The most effective shading devices are exterior types such as overhang, fins and <b>exterior</b> venetian <b>blind.</b> The effectiveness of an external shading device depends on its geometry, sun path, and the orientation of the building. These factors are interrelated dynamically, it is extremely difficult to predict intuitively how the shadow is cast by the external shading device on the window. Due to the inherent complexity of calculation for shadow casting, building designers to fail often integrate them into energy-efficient building design. Since computer graphics can be a powerful visual communication tool, the above problem might be solved through a computerized graphical interface in the early design stage. The research described in this paper involves the development of a computer program which aims the following objectives: (1) to facilitate the description of a external shading device's geometry through an integrated graphic input model, (ii) to simulate the relationship of external shading devices and shadows based on sun path, the orientation of building, (iii) to visualize the shadow casting by shading devices, and (iv) to provide designers with possible solutions to create energy-efficient external shading device for a specific building...|$|R
6000|$|It is oblong--some {{thirty feet}} in length and twenty-five in breadth--a shape affording the best(ordinary) {{opportunities}} for the adjustment of furniture. It has but one door--by no means a wide one--which is {{at one end of}} the parallelogram, and but two windows, which are at the other. These latter are large, reaching down to the floor--have deep recesses--and open on an Italian veranda. Their panes are of a crimson-tinted glass, set in rose-wood framings, more massive than usual. They are curtained within the recess, by a thick silver tissue adapted to the shape of the window, and hanging loosely in small volumes. Without the recess are curtains of an exceedingly rich crimson silk, fringed with a deep network of gold, and lined with silver tissue, which is the material of the <b>exterior</b> <b>blind.</b> There are no cornices; but the folds of the whole fabric (which are sharp rather than massive, and have an airy appearance), issue from beneath a broad entablature of rich giltwork, which encircles the room at the junction of the ceiling and walls. The drapery is thrown open also, or closed, by means of a thick rope of gold loosely enveloping it, and resolving itself readily into a knot; no pins or other such devices are apparent. The colours of the curtains and their fringe--the tints of crimson and gold--appear everywhere in profusion, and determine the character of the room. The carpet--of Saxony material--is quite half an inch thick, and is of the same crimson ground, relieved simply by the appearance of a gold cord (like that festooning the curtains) slightly relieved above the surface of the ground, and thrown upon it in such a manner as to form a succession of short irregular curves--one occasionally overlaying the other. The walls are prepared with a glossy paper of a silver gray tint, spotted with small Arabesque devices of a fainter hue of the prevalent crimson. Many paintings relieve the expanse of paper. These are chiefly landscapes of an imaginative cast--such as the fairy grottoes of Stanfield, or the lake of the Dismal Swamp of Chapman. There are, nevertheless, three or four female heads, of an ethereal beauty-portraits in the manner of Sully. The tone of each picture is warm, but dark. There are no [...] "brilliant effects." [...] Repose speaks in all. Not one is of small size. Diminutive paintings give that spotty look to a room, which is the blemish of so many a fine work of Art overtouched. The frames are broad but not deep, and richly carved, without being dulled or filagreed. They have the whole lustre of burnished gold. They lie flat on the walls, and do not hang off with cords. The designs themselves are often seen to better advantage in this latter position, but the general appearance of the chamber is injured. But one mirror--and this not a very large one--is visible. In shape it is nearly circular--and it is hung so that a reflection of the person can be obtained from it in none of the ordinary sitting-places of the room. Two large low sofas of rosewood and crimson silk, gold-flowered, form the only seats, with the exception of two light conversation chairs, also of rose-wood. There is a pianoforte (rose-wood, also), without cover, and thrown open. An octagonal table, formed altogether of the richest gold-threaded marble, is placed near one of the sofas. This is also without cover--the drapery of the curtains has been thought sufficient.. Four large and gorgeous Sevres vases, in which bloom a profusion of sweet and vivid flowers, occupy the slightly rounded angles of the room. A tall candelabrum, bearing a small antique lamp with highly perfumed oil, is standing near the head of my sleeping friend. Some light and graceful hanging shelves, with golden edges and crimson silk cords with gold tassels, sustain two or three hundred magnificently bound books. Beyond these things, there is no furniture, if we except an Argand lamp, with a plain crimson-tinted ground glass shade, which depends from He lofty vaulted ceiling by a single slender gold chain, and throws a tranquil but magical radiance over all.|$|R
