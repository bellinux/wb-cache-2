40|$|Abstract. <b>Tool</b> <b>edge</b> {{geometry}} has obvious {{influences on}} cutting tool behaviors. FEM {{modeling and simulation}} of orthogonal cutting process using uniform and variable <b>edge</b> cutting <b>tools</b> were studied with dynamics explicit ALE method. AISI 1045 steel was chosen for workpiece, and cemented carbide was chosen for cutting tool. Three sections of uniform and variable edges were chosen for analysis. Cutting forces and temperature distributions were calculated for uniform and variable <b>edge</b> carbide cutting <b>tool.</b> Simulation results show that variable <b>edge</b> cutting <b>tool</b> obtains small cutting forces. Ploughing force tends to reduce when variable <b>edge</b> cutting <b>tool</b> was used. Variable <b>edge</b> cutting <b>tool</b> reduces the heat generation and presents reasonable temperature distributions, which is beneficial to cutting life. The force and temperature distributions demonstrate the advantages of variable <b>edge</b> cutting <b>tool...</b>|$|R

The residences in the district are predominantly associated with the Bradley <b>Edge</b> <b>Tool</b> Company, whose complex, located {{on the banks of}} the Saugatuck River, burned in 1911, and is one of the district's contributing features. Two houses, the Curtis Wood House and the Miles Bradley House, are individually significant for their architecture.|$|R
