5000|$|Before the {{development}} of power semiconductors and allied technologies, one way to convert the voltage of a DC supply to a higher voltage, for low-power applications, was to convert it to AC by using a vibrator, followed by a step-up transformer and rectifier. For higher power an electric motor was used to drive a generator of the desired voltage (sometimes combined into a single [...] "dynamotor" [...] unit, a motor and generator combined into one unit, with one winding driving the motor and the other generating the output voltage). These were relatively inefficient and expensive procedures used only {{when there was no}} alternative, as to power a car radio (which then used thermionic valves/tubes requiring much higher voltages than available from a 6 or 12 V car battery). The introduction of power semiconductors and integrated circuits made it economically viable to use techniques as described below, for example to convert the DC power supply to high-frequency AC, use a transformer—small, light, and cheap due to the high frequency—to change the voltage, and rectify back to DC. Although by 1976 transistor car radio receivers did not require high voltages, some amateur radio operators continued to use vibrator supplies and <b>dynamotors</b> for mobile transceivers requiring high voltages, although transistorised power supplies were available.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} in early mobile radio technology was that of converting the six or twelve volt power supply of the vehicle to the high voltage needed to operate the vacuum tubes in the radio. Early tube-type radios used <b>dynamotors</b> - essentially a six or twelve volt motor that turned a generator to provide the high voltages required by the vacuum tubes. Some early mobile radios were {{the size of a}} suitcase or had separate boxes for the transmitter and receiver. As time went on, power supply technology evolved to use first electromechanical vibrators, then solid-state power supplies to provide high voltage for the vacuum tubes. These circuits, called [...] "inverters", changed the 6V or 12V direct current (DC) to alternating current (AC) which could be passed through a transformer to make high voltage. The power supply then rectified this high voltage to make the high voltage DC required for the vacuum tubes, (called valves in British English). The power supplies needed to power vacuum tube radios resulted in a common trait of tube-type mobile radios: their heavy weight due to the iron-core transformers in the power supplies. These high voltage power supplies were inefficient, and the filaments of the vacuum tubes added to current demands, taxing vehicle electrical systems. Sometimes, a generator or alternator upgrade was needed to support the current required for a tube-type mobile radio.|$|R

5000|$|The {{development}} of the APCO Ten Signals began in 1937 to reduce use of speech on the radio {{at a time when}} police radio channels were limited. Credit for inventing the codes goes to Charles [...] "Charlie" [...] Hopper, communications director for the Illinois State Police, District 10 in Pesotum, Illinois. Hopper had been involved in radio for years and realized there was a need to abbreviate transmissions on State Police bands. Experienced radio operators knew the first syllable of a transmission was frequently not understood because of quirks in early electronics technology. Radios in the 1930s were based on vacuum tubes powered by a small motor-generator called a <b>dynamotor.</b> The <b>dynamotor</b> took from 1/10 to 1/4 of a second to [...] "spin up" [...] to full power.

50|$|A {{motor-generator}} set, {{mainly of}} historical interest, {{consists of an}} electric motor and generator coupled together. A <b>dynamotor</b> combines both functions into a single unit with coils for both the motor and the generator functions wound around a single rotor; both coils share the same outer field coils or magnets. Typically the motor coils are driven from a commutator {{on one end of}} the shaft, when the generator coils output to another commutator on the other end of the shaft. The entire rotor and shaft assembly is smaller in size than a pair of machines, and may not have any exposed drive shafts.|$|E
50|$|Few {{transmitter}} {{components of}} the AN/ARC-5 are interchangeable with ATA or SCR-274-N equivalent units. Mechanically, the transmitter rear power connector is slightly different, so inserting the wrong transmitter in a rack can damage either the rack or the transmitter power connector. Electrically, AN/ARC-5 transmitters use high-level final amplifier plate modulation, and the output tank circuit is shunt high voltage fed. The two earlier systems use less effective screen modulation, and the output circuit is series high voltage fed. The only electrical {{components of the}} AN/ARC-5 transmitter system that are interchangeable with the earlier systems are the <b>dynamotor</b> and the antenna relay.|$|E
50|$|The {{antecedent}} of the AN/ARC-5 {{system was}} the U.S. Navy's ARA/ATA system, initially deployed in 1940. The designations ARA and ATA are a pre-World War II Navy equipment nomenclature. The major {{units of the}} ARA are five receivers covering 0.19 to 9.1 MHz, each unit with its own <b>dynamotor</b> power supply. The major units of the ATA are five transmitters covering 2.1 to 9.1 MHz, using a common transmitter dynamotor/screen modulator unit. Most units {{were made by the}} Aircraft Radio Corporation (USN manufacturer's code CBY). Many units were also made by Stromberg-Carlson (USN manufacturer's code CCT).|$|E
50|$|While a {{motor-generator}} set may consist of distinct motor and generator machines coupled together, a single unit <b>dynamotor</b> (for dynamo-motor) has the motor coils and the generator coils wound around a single rotor; both the motor and generator therefore {{share the same}} outer field coils or magnets. Typically the motor coils are driven from a commutator {{on one end of}} the shaft, while the generator coils provide output to another commutator on the other end of the shaft. The entire rotor and shaft assembly is smaller, lighter, and cheaper than a pair of machines, and does not require exposed drive shafts.|$|E
50|$|The BC-342 was a World War II U.S. Army Signal Corps high {{frequency}} radio receiver.

First designed at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey by the U.S. Army Signal Corps, it was built by various manufacturers including RCA. Many of the later units that are encountered today were manufactured by the Farnsworth Television and Radio Corporation of Fort Wayne, Indiana. Its low frequency counterpart is the BC-344 radio receiver that is almost identical to the BC-342.|$|E

50|$|Shortly {{after the}} war Stuart {{introduced}} the P3 single-cylinder 2-stroke engine, designed by Alec Plint to drive lighting and pumping plants. This engine was to {{form the basis of}} a range of engines used for small power applications, particularly as marine engines and to drive generators, though also to drive equipment and pumps. Casting were produced in Stuart Turner's own foundry. The P4 superseded the P3 in 1928, and in 1930 the marine variant was introduced, and was sold in considerable number for fitment in small yachts and other pleasure boats. In around 1935/1936 the P4 was joined by the larger-bore P5 (268 cc) and twin-cylinder P55 (535 cc). While the P4 was made until the war, the P5 and P55 continued in production for over 30 years. For the marine engines Stuart produced a reversing gearbox and optional final drive reduction gear, and everything else up to and including the propellor was available. The many variations of the engines (marine and otherwise) were indicated by suffixes to the engine number, so for example a P55ME would be a marine P55 with electric start (Lucas <b>Dynamotor,</b> Siba Dynastart, or separate dynamo and starter).|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} part of a major {{research}} project to analyse vibro-acoustic characteristics from variable speed inverter driven induction motors (VSIDIM). The overall projects’ aimed at providing {{a better understanding of the}} mechanisms of sound generation from electromagnetic origins and developing a numerical model to predict the sound power emitted from a VSIDIM. The scope of this thesis is to assess experimentally the effect of various controller strategies on the radiated sound power and to develop a finite element method for calculating the electromagnetic force distribution over the stator. Various sources of noise in induction motors and their behaviour with speed and load have been reviewed. Models of the electromagnetic field and vibro-acoustic character have been discussed. An outline of various techniques of reducing noise in induction motors through design of inverters and modifications to the motor structure has been given. Experiments were conducted to assess the effect of controller strategies on the radiated sound power. Three different supplies were tested: a <b>dynamotor</b> which produces an almost sinusoidal supply with very low harmonic content, an inverter with a low switching frequency (less than 1 kHz) and an inverter with a high switching frequency (8 kHz) and various levels of random modulation. Results indicate that the sound power level of the MSC drive is a lot higher than that of the VSC 2000 drive and the <b>dynamotor</b> drive. The sound power level of the VSC 2000 drive and the <b>dynamotor</b> drive increases almost linearly with motor speed, that for the MSC drive is almost independent of speed. The sound power level of the MSC drive is almost 28 dB higher than that of the <b>dynamotor</b> drive at 450 rpm and the difference is reduced to 14 dB at 1500 rpm where the aerodynamic noise becomes more dominant. It has been found that at the rated speed (1500 rpm), the sound power level varies by less than 3 dB from no load to full load for all three sources. Although increasing the switching frequency increases the cost of the inverters and switching losses, results from the MSC and VSC 2000 drives clearly show that it reduces the radiated sound power by shifting the harmonics into higher and inaudible frequency range. The tonal nature around the switching frequency has been reduced by increasing the levels of random modulation to spread the energy over a wider range of frequencies, although the sound power level has not varied by more than 0. 2 dB. A finite element model has been developed to calculate the electromagnetic force distribution. The quasi-static solution method has been implemented by stepping the rotor through the time domain using a fine regular mesh in the air gap. The stator currents were experimentally obtained while the rotor currents were obtained using a 4 parameter state space model of the motor. Results of the simulation indicate the influence of stator and rotor slots, saturation and time harmonics in the current. The calculated electromagnetic force distribution has been used in a FEM/BEM acoustic model and SEA acoustic model to predict the radiated sound power which agrees reasonably well with the measured sound, thus validating indirectly the electromagnetic force simulations...|$|E

40|$|Currently only 5 % of {{residential}} HVAC systems are sold with variable speed (VS) circulating blower motors {{in spite of}} the significant energy savings and comfort benefits associated with variable speed motors. This is due to the very high cost of variable speed motors currently on the market. The project goal is to develop a version of the DynaMotor{trademark} variable speed motor for use in residential HVAC systems. The motor will have performance similar to existing VS motors used in HVAC systems but will sell to HVAC OEM's for 40 - 50 % less than existing VS motors thus bringing energy saving VS motor technology to middle tier HVAC systems. The <b>DynaMotor</b> is a unique, patented variable speed motor/drive technology that has significant advantages over other VS motor/drive technologies including low cost. Prior to this project development was focused exclusively on the factory automation market. The project goals included efficiency, speed range, audible noise, reliability and cost. All goals except cost have been obtained. Cost cannot be finally determined until a manufacturing partner is selected although the cost goals appear to be achievable. Negotiations with two potential manufacturing partners are underway. Although the project technical goals have been achieved, further improvements in audible noise, torque ripple and simplicity of controls are being explored. The project is moving from the R&D phase to commercialization. In addition to the previously mentioned negotiations with potential manufacturing partners, approximately ten motors have been supplied to HVAC OEMs for test and evaluation. Reaction has been largely positive. If the cost goals are met it is expected that significant sales of the motor will result thus increasing the utilization of VS motors in residential HVAC and resulting in significant national energy savings...|$|E
