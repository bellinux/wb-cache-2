5|$|In {{the case}} of a front suspension, {{especially}} telescoping fork tubes, the increase in downward <b>force</b> <b>on</b> the front wheel during braking may cause the suspension to compress and the front end to lower. This is known as brake diving. A riding technique that takes advantage of how braking increases the downward <b>force</b> <b>on</b> the front wheel is known as trail braking.|$|E
5|$|An {{electron}} generates {{an electric}} field that exerts an attractive <b>force</b> <b>on</b> a particle {{with a positive}} charge, such as the proton, and a repulsive <b>force</b> <b>on</b> a particle with a negative charge. The strength of this force in nonrelativistic approximation is determined by Coulomb's inverse square law. When an electron is in motion, it generates a magnetic field. The Ampère-Maxwell law relates the magnetic field to the mass motion of electrons (the current) with respect to an observer. This property of induction supplies the magnetic field that drives an electric motor. The electromagnetic field of an arbitrary moving charged particle is expressed by the Liénard–Wiechert potentials, which are valid even when the particle's speed is close to that of light (relativistic).|$|E
5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the First World War, Jeffries was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Citizens Military <b>Force</b> <b>on</b> 22 August 1914.
