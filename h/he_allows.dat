When Evan returns to the ark during construction, God presents him with a robe, and later tells Evan that the flood will likely come at mid-day on September 22. When Joan becomes suspicious of his behavior, Evan tells her the truth: God has been talking to him and is responsible for his new look and recent actions, although Joan does not believe Evan and is convinced that he is beginning to lose his mind. After wearing the robe for some time, Evan finds it comfortable, but he soon realizes that God will not allow him {{to take it off}} and wear anything else after two failed attempts to change his clothes later.
