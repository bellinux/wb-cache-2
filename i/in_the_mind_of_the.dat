Edward Drinker Cope and Alpheus Hyatt reconciled this view with evolutionism in a form of neo-Lamarckism involving recapitulation theory.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{have noted}} that Narayan's {{writings}} {{tend to be more}} descriptive and less analytical; the objective style, rooted in a detached spirit, providing for a more authentic and realistic narration. His attitude, coupled with his perception of life, provided a unique ability to fuse characters and actions, and an ability to use ordinary events to create a connection <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reader. A significant contributor to his writing style was his creation of Malgudi, a stereotypical small town, where the standard norms of superstition and tradition apply.|$|E
5|$|The {{match was}} played over {{three days and}} culminated in a draw on Saturday, 27 July. Lancashire won the toss and decided to bat, but were {{dismissed}} for only 89 after rain shortened the first day's play. Grace took 3–44 and the left arm spinner Robert Miles took 7–38. Gloucestershire responded with 116, Grace making the top score of 32. At close of play on the second day, Lancashire had made 90–0 with Hornby on 68 and Barlow on 15; and {{the legend of the}} run stealers was born <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> watching Francis Thompson. Hornby and Barlow put on 108 for the first wicket and then Barlow was out for 26. Hornby went on to score exactly 100 and Lancashire's total was 262 (Grace 1–65). Gloucestershire scored 125–5 in the last innings with Grace, batting at six, on 58 not out at the close.|$|E
40|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> antiglobalization {{movement}} and the anti-American left, and perhaps <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> Islamic terrorists themselves, {{the growth of the}} American Empire has caused the growth of Islamic terrorism.

5|$|Before his death, Mr. Nobody {{tells the}} {{journalist}} {{that neither of}} them exist. They are figments <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 9-year-old Nemo at the train station, as {{he was forced to}} make an impossible choice. The young boy tries to find the correct decision, following each choice to its conclusion. Eventually, the boy takes a third option: to not make the choice at all. He leaves both parents and runs away towards an unknown future. This ambiguous choice somehow leads to him and Anna reuniting happily. The film returns to old Nemo on his death bed. The calculated time arrives and Mr. Nobody's last words are watched by the world. The expansion of the universe comes to a halt and time appears to reverse. The universe ceases to dissipate, and finally begins contracting. Consequently, Nemo's life simplifies itself. He is able to return to his childhood, watch his parents get back together and be with Anna. The 118-year-old man cackles triumphantly as he springs back into awareness with the realization that his younger self has finally found his one true love and life.|$|E
5|$|Undoubtedly while negro slavery {{alone was}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Congress which {{proposed}} the thirteenth article, it forbids {{any other kind}} of slavery, now or hereafter. If Mexican peonage or the Chinese coolie labor system shall develop slavery of the Mexican or Chinese race within our territory, this amendment may safely be trusted to make it void. And so if other rights are assailed by the States which properly and necessarily fall within the protection of these articles, that protection will apply, though the party interested may not be of African descent. But what we do say, and what we wish to be understood is, that in any fair and just construction of any section or phrase of these amendments, it is necessary to look to the purpose which we have said was the pervading spirit of them all, the evil which they were designed to remedy, and the process of continued addition to the Constitution, until that purpose was supposed to be accomplished, as far as constitutional law can accomplish it.|$|E

40|$|According to Eugene Nida’s {{theory of}} Dynamic Equivalence, the most {{important}} aim for translators should be to achieve equivalence in effect between original and translated text. Equivalent effect is achieved when a translated text creates the same associations and feelings <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> its readers as was produced <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> readers of the original text. Venuti argues that equivalent effect can only be achieved using what {{he refers to as}} ethnocentric domesticating strategies – placing <b>the</b> text <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cultural context of the target audience. He claims that a foreignizing strategy – placing <b>the</b> reader <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cultural context of the original text – is more appropriate. Consequently, equivalent effect is, in his view, a poor guiding principle for translation. In this thesis, I challenge Venuti’s view that only domesticating strategies can achieve equivalent effect in translation. Using a response-oriented method, I measure the associations to African American Vernacular English (AAVE) produced <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> respondents from <b>the</b> source audience. Then, I compare these associations with <b>the</b> associations produced <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> readers of two translations of AAVE – one using a domesticating strategy to translate AAVE, and one using a moderate foreignizing strategy. In contrast to Venuti’s assertions, I find that the moderate foreignizing strategy produces associations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> target readers that are more <b>in</b> accordance with <b>the</b> associations produced <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> source readers than the domesticating strategy...|$|R

25|$|The {{reconstruction}} of the total image was left to the creative intuition of the observer. The spectator now played an active role.

25|$|Älvsborg ransom was an indemnity, stipulated in the Treaty of Knäred 1613, {{that would}} redeem Älvsborg Castle (in Gothenburg, Sweden) from Danish {{military}} {{occupation of the}} Kalmar War. According to the treaty, the ransom was one million rixdollars. The ransom would be financed by a nationwide tax, which would be paid during {{each of the six}} years 1613-1618 by the entire population of Sweden. The Danes did not only hold Älvsborg Castle as a collateral for the ransom, but also the towns of Nya Lödöse, Old Lödöse and Gothenburg, as well as seven hundreds of Västergötland. Yet, since the return of Älvsborg was uppermost <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> government, the ransom and the tax to pay for it has in history been named after this castle.|$|E

25|$|The formal {{cause is}} its form, i.e., the {{arrangement}} of that matter. It tells us what a thing is, that any thing {{is determined by the}} definition, form, pattern, essence, whole, synthesis or archetype. It embraces the account of causes in terms of fundamental principles or general laws, as the whole (i.e., macrostructure) is the cause of its parts, a relationship known as the whole-part causation. Plainly put, the formal cause is the idea existing in the first place as exemplar <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sculptor, and in the second place as intrinsic, determining cause, embodied in the matter. Formal cause could only refer to the essential quality of causation. A simple example of the formal cause is the mental image or idea that allows an artist, architect, or engineer to create a drawing.|$|E
25|$|The 1980s {{also saw}} the {{widespread}} acceptance of positioning theory. Although the theory originated with Jack Trout in 1969, it didn’t gain wide acceptance until Al Ries and Jack Trout wrote their classic book Positioning: The Battle For Your Mind (1979). The basic premise is that a strategy should not be judged by internal company factors but by the way customers see it relative to the competition. Crafting and implementing a strategy involves creating a position <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> collective consumer. Several techniques enabled the practical use of positioning theory. Perceptual mapping for example, creates visual displays {{of the relationships between}} positions. Multidimensional scaling, discriminant analysis, factor analysis and conjoint analysis are mathematical techniques used to determine the most relevant characteristics (called dimensions or factors) upon which positions should be based. Preference regression can be used to determine vectors of ideal positions and cluster analysis can identify clusters of positions.|$|E
25|$|Ibn Rushd (Averroës), the {{contemporary}} of Maimonides, closed {{the first great}} philosophical era of the Muslims. He was a defender of Aristotelian philosophy against Ash'ari theologians led by Al-Ghazali. Averroes' philosophy was considered controversial in Muslim circles. The theories of Ibn Rushd do not differ fundamentally from those of Ibn Bajjah and Ibn Tufail, who only follow the teachings of Ibn Sina (Avicenna) and Al-Farabi. Like all Islamic Peripatetics, Ibn Rushd admits the hypothesis of the intelligence of the spheres and the hypothesis of universal emanation, through which motion is communicated {{from place to place}} to all parts of the universe as far as the supreme worldhypotheses which, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Arabic philosophers, did away with the dualism involved in Aristotle's doctrine of pure energy and eternal matter. His ideas on the separation of philosophy and religion, further developed by the Averroist school of philosophy, were later influential in the development of modern secularism.|$|E
