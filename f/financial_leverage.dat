5|$|The shark tourist {{industry}} has some <b>financial</b> <b>leverage</b> in conserving this animal. A single set of great white jaws can fetch up to £20,000. That is {{a fraction of}} the tourism value of a live shark; tourism is a more sustainable economic activity than shark fishing. For example, the dive industry in Gansbaai, South Africa consists of six boat operators with each boat guiding 30 people each day. With fees between £50 and £150 per person, a single live shark that visits each boat can create anywhere between £9,000 and £27,000 of revenue daily.|$|E

After the killing of Saw Ba U Gyi in 1950, the first {{president}} of the Karen National Union (KNU), the group sought to regain both a political initiative and <b>financial</b> <b>leverage.</b> Three KNDO members - Major Saw Kyaw Aye, Captain Thein Kyaw and Captain A Nyein - planned to hijack a plane, and use it to smuggle illegal weapons. They successfully hijacked the plane, and forced its British pilot Captain A.E. Hare to land on a deserted beach, after other group members had failed to build a suitable temporary runway in Karen. Finding 700,000 Burmese kyat in metal chests in the cargo, cash being transported between bank branches, they confiscated this and then let the plane take off. Censorship banned reporting of the story for over 50 years, but in April 2014 it was the subject of the book The World's First Hijacking, and is being developed into a Hollywood-produced film under the same title.|$|E
25|$|Corporate {{bankruptcy}} {{can arise}} {{as a result}} of two broad categories failure—business failure or financial distress. Business failure stems from a critical flaw in the company's business model that prohibits it from producing the necessary level of profit to justify its capital investment. Conversely, financial distress stems from a critical flaw in the way the company is financed, or its capital structure. Continued financial distress leads to either technical insolvency (assets outweigh liabilities, but the firm is unable to meet current obligations) or “bankruptcy” (liabilities outweigh assets, and the firm has a negative net worth). A company experiencing business failure can stay off bankruptcy as long as it has access to funding; conversely, a company that experiencing financial failure will be pushed into bankruptcy regardless of the soundness of its business model. The actual causes of corporate bankruptcies are difficult to establish, due to the compounding effects of external (macroeconomic, industry) and internal (business or financial) factors. However, some studies have indicated that <b>financial</b> <b>leverage</b> and working capital mismanagement are likely two of the major causes of corporate failure and bankruptcy in the U.S.|$|E

40|$|We {{develop a}} theory of <b>financial</b> {{intermediary}} <b>leverage</b> cycles {{in the context of}} a dynamic model of the macroeconomy. The interaction between a production sector, a financial intermediation sector, and a household sector gives rise to amplification of fundamental shocks that affect real economic activity. The model features two state variables that represent the dynamics of the economy: the net worth and the <b>leverage</b> of <b>financial</b> intermediaries. The <b>leverage</b> of the intermediaries is procyclical, owing to risk-sensitive funding constraints. Relative to an economy with constant <b>leverage,</b> <b>financial</b> intermediaries generate higher output and consumption growth and lower consumption volatility in normal times, but at the cost of systemic solvency and liquidity risks. We show that tightening intermediaries' risk constraints affects the systemic risk-return trade-off by lowering the likelihood of systemic crises at the cost of higher pricing of risk. Our model thus represents a conceptual framework for cyclical macroprudential policies within a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model...|$|R

In this study, the author uses {{the data of}} US listed firms to test the traditional trade-off theory of {{capital structure}}, which posits that firms should balance the benefit of tax shields and costs of financial distress to purse an optimal debt ratio. Therefore, to determine the complex relationship between firm value and debt ratio and avoid the problem of model misspecification, the author adopts the non-parametric fixed effect model and semi-parametric (partially linear) fixed effect model. Our empirical results reveal that a nonlinear and asymmetric relationship exists between firm value and market debt ratio, thus, considerably supporting trade-off theory. Moreover, the use of different definitions of key variables and various kernel functions engenders robust results. Overall, the author suggests that firm managers should employ <b>financial</b> <b>leverages</b> appropriately to maximize firm value...|$|R
