40|$|Telecommunications {{is one of}} {{our most}} {{critical}} national infrastructures, enabling many other infrastructure sectors to function. The federal oversight structure for this sector, put in place by the Department of Homeland Security, relies heavily on voluntary cooperation between the public and private sectors. Given that no large-scale disruption of the nationwide telecommunications backbone has occurred, there is no empirical evidence showing the effectiveness of the structure DHS has put in place. In an effort to gauge the effectiveness of the various existing infrastructure oversight structures, this thesis examines four specific roles assumed by the federal government and their performance in their respective sectors. These roles and sectors are Owner (aviation), Customer (power), Coordinator (local telecommunications), and Regulator (food). Each case is reviewed {{to determine the effects of}} the government role on economic impact of the disruption, the time required to restore initial <b>operating</b> <b>capabilities,</b> and the time required to restore <b>full</b> <b>operating</b> <b>capabilities.</b> The various cases show that the government role has little direct impact on the costs related to infrastructure disruptions. The Regulator role had a negative impact on timelines for both initial and full restoration. The other roles all made positive contributions to both restoration timelines.

40|$|Problem Definition The Army’s Soldier as a System {{requirement}} identifies capability gaps {{with respect}} to dis-mounted battle command and situation awareness. As compared to their mounted peers, dismounted soldiers lack effective radio communications, situation awareness displays, and request or reporting systems that integrate with {{other elements of the}} combined arms team. In particular, networked voice and data communications, a user-defined situation awareness picture, networked lethality, and mission planning and rehearsal are not available to dismounted soldiers via their organic command and control systems. The Army’s Nett Warrior system will address some of the needs for dismounted command and control. This pro-gram is slated to reach initial <b>operating</b> <b>capabilities</b> in 2012 with improvements and <b>full</b> <b>operating</b> <b>capabilities</b> in 2016. Even after successful development and fielding of the Nett Warrior system, complemented by the SINC-GARS (ASIP) radio, there will still be some challenges and capability gaps {{with respect to}} dismounted command and control. First, these systems are scheduled to be fielded to infantry units. However, many other units perform dismounted operations. In addition, concerns about overall system weight and cost remain. Finally, the challenge of integrating allied and host nation forces will be difficult with these systems. Technical Approach This project looks to emerging commercial technologies for mobile cellular networks as a cost effective means to fill these gaps. These technologies are in wide use across the international commercia...|$|R

40|$|Usage {{efficiency}} {{of mechanical engineering}} products is determined by level of their <b>operating</b> <b>capability.</b> Expenses connected with provision of <b>operating</b> <b>capability</b> for the whole operational period exceed initial cost of the products by 6 - 10 -fold. Moreover, while being used the expenses {{have a tendency to}} increase with reduction of output parameters that ensure product application efficiency for its intended purpose. It is necessary to take into account these changes at manufacturing stages of mechanical engineering products. Maximum efficiency can be obtained at the operational stage of the product life cycle only as a result of complex and interrelated measures during designing, manufacturing and usage of the specific product for its intended purpose with due account of its output parameter dynamics. While using the product an analysis of its output parameter dynamics will make it possible to determine maximum value of the <b>operating</b> <b>capability,</b> operational expenses and best practices for obtaining maximum profit per operating time unit. Taking hydroficated excavators of the 5 th grade as an example the paper presents dynamics of main output parameters at the operational stage of their life cycle; reveals the main factor influencing on intensity of hydroficated machine <b>operating</b> <b>capability</b> reduction; substantiates an expediency of taking into account output parameter dynamics while evaluating {{efficiency of}} its usage; proposes a methodology for determination of or a pay-off time period for recoupment of expenses pertaining to machine procurement and optimum time period for operational stage, its life cycle that corresponds to obtaining maximum profit. Nowadays constant values of main output parameters (<b>operating</b> <b>capability,</b> self cost of machine-hour) corresponding to the beginning of operation are {{to be taken into account}} while determining expediency of machine creation. Practically they significantly change in the process of machine operation this fact must be taken account while creating a machine and using it for its intended operational purpose and ensuring its <b>operating</b> <b>capability.</b> The proposed methodology for maintaining and restoration of <b>operating</b> <b>capability</b> of construction and road-building machines was published previously [3].

40|$|In this study, we {{expand our}} {{understanding}} of firm evolution by focusing on how <b>operating</b> and dynamic <b>capabilities</b> interact through endogenously led changes. The focus on endogenous change complements the current emphasis {{in the literature on}} how dynamic capabilities help firms cope with the risk of core rigidities following an exogenous shock. Our comparison of two collaborating firms shows that, at the <b>operating</b> <b>capability</b> level, firms build absorptive capacity in value networks during their product development experiences and this learning needs to be captured at the product portfolio planning level. When this learning is captured and transformed, product portfolio planning acts as a dynamic <b>capability</b> reconfiguring <b>operating</b> <b>capabilities</b> based on beliefs about follow-on entrepreneurial opportunities. Under conditions of endogenous change, dynamic capabilities are guided by a proactive entrepreneurial logic, complementing the need for reactive adaptive responses in circumstances of exogenous change. A key implication is that dynamic capabilities have a more expansive and critical role in the adaptation of firms than previously considered. Our theorizing shows how interactions between dynamic and <b>operating</b> <b>capabilities</b> build the adaptive capacity of the organization...|$|R
