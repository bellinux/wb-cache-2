The archive has begun operations and is ingesting Level 0 (uncalibrated) observations made with the recently upgraded High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES); these observations will be publicly accessible after expiration of a proprietary period. Observatory staff have begun using the archived data to determine the long-term performance of the HIRES instrument. The archive is housed at the Michelson Science Center (MSC) and employs a modular design with the following components: (1) Data Evaluation and Preparation: images from the telescope are evaluated and native FITS headers are converted to metadata that will support archiving; (2) Trans Pacific Data Transfer: metadata are sent daily by e-mail and ingested into the archive in a highly fault tolerant fashion, and FITS images are written to DVDs and sent to MSC each week; (3) Science Information System: inherited from the NASA/IPAC Infrared Science Archive, it provides all the functionality needed to support database <b>inquiries</b> and <b>processing</b> of requests; and a Web-based (4) User Interface, a thin layer above the information system that accepts user requests and returns results. The design offers two major cost-saving benefits: it overcomes the geographical separation between the telescope and the archive and enables development at Keck and at MSC to proceed independently; and it permits direct inheritance of the IRSA architecture...|$|R

40|$|Since the Federal Circuit’s {{adoption}} of Panduit’s causation standard for establishing entitlement to lost profits damages in patent litigation, application of its noninfringing alternatives prong has lacked consistency. The court’s decision in Grain Processing Corp. v. American Maize-Products Co., however, created an additional {{contribution to the}} Panduit standard, thereby raising the evidentiary bar while significantly altering the noninfringing-alternative <b>inquiry.</b> Grain <b>Processing</b> has given the infringer a potentially powerful defensive mechanism in {{an area in which}} patentees are generally favored, even when some infringement may be socially desirable. Grain Processing allows for the potential avoidance of lost profit damages, so long as the alleged infringer shows that it had the necessary equipment, know-how, and experience to produce an acceptable, noninfringing substitute during the alleged infringement period. The Grain Processing decision, however, raises some debate. As a judicially interjected gloss on damages, the added ability to limit damage awards to a reasonable royalty could have been too drastic. A closer look demonstrates a precarious policy balance. On the one hand, increases in patent litigation might justify implementing an additional hurdle to potential damage awards in order to further incentivize innovation. Added rigor provided by Grain Processing may deter frivolous and expensive litigation that might be asserted by patentees to keep new innovators out of the market. But on the other hand, if a market participant does unlawfully infringe, it is certainly reasonable to believe that the infringer should pay appropriate damages for the encroachment on another’s intellectual property. Grain Processing’s lost-profit-limiting defense against a patentee’s claim of entitlement to lost profits damages may serve to deter potentially useful innovation by increasing costs shouldered by patentees in defending their patent rights. This Note analyzes six Federal Circuit cases appealing lost profits determinations, decided both before and after Grain Processing, and attempts to discern the impacts that Grain Processing has had on patentees’ entitlements to lost profits. This Note is organized in four parts. Part I provides the historical and substantive context necessary to understand the Grain Processing decision and examines important statutory changes, especially their subsequent interpretation, both before and after Grain Processing. Part II summarizes three pre-, as well as three post-Grain Processing cases. Parts III and IV dissect and analyze the holdings in these cases and evaluate Grain Processing’s impact on patent damages...|$|R
40|$|Identification of {{the causes}} of ill health {{is the first step in}} crop {{protection}}. Plant protection services must also be able to anticipate pest and disease attacks and quickly identify the problem, so that the most effective treatment can be applied. 'Plant Clinics' is a summary report of an expert consultation organized by the German Foundation for International Development (DES), in collaboration with CTA, the International Society of Plant Protection (ISPP) and the FAO. The meeting discussed the concept of 'establishing and operating plant clinics integrated with extension services in developing countries'. This booklet, however, is not merely a conference report. It is a practical guide on how to set up a plant clinic, its relation with extension and other crop protection services, and how to organize plant clinics into a country-wide network for more effective plant protection. It includes information on the size and scope of plant clinics in different circumstances the facilities required, procedures for <b>processing</b> <b>inquiries,</b> data collection and evaluation as well as specimen collection, processing, storage and despatch. The role of plant clinics within the overall framework of plant protection is discussed in detail. Plant clinics can play a very important role by acting as a link between research and extension services. Interaction between clinic staff and crop advisers, and between clinic staff and research workers, must be strong and effective. There must be a two-way flow of information. Examples of country-wide networks of clinics show that they make it possible to trace the spread of pests and diseases over the whole country and lead to considerable savings in monitoring expenses. In addition, when organized on a country-wide scale, the clinics could form nuclei for more effective plant protection services. They could develop into regional crop protection centres which would serve several purposes, from identification of pests and pathogens, data collection and storage to monitoring disease and pest occurrence and training extension personnel. The appendices to this booklet (which is available from CTA) include detailed instructions on specimen identification and despatch, a questionnaire for submitting specimens and a list of equipment required to run a plant clinic. Identification {{of the causes}} of ill health is the first step in crop protection. Plant protection services must also be able to anticipate pest and disease attacks and quickly identify the problem, so that the most effective treatment can be [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Individuals with Williams {{syndrome}} (WS) {{have been}} characterised as hyper-sociable, showing an extreme compulsion {{to engage in}} communication with other people, whilst the opposite has been cited regarding autism. The most important social cue in our environment is the human face, which must be successfully recognised and interpreted for communicative signals. Although clear differences are apparent in social skills, individuals with WS and autism {{have been described as}} showing similarly atypical face processing styles. The present research addressed issues of face perception in Williams syndrome and autism to gain further insights into social abilities of individuals with these developmental disorders. Importantly, the research was grounded in typical face perception methods. The investigation began with a large-scale exploration of face skills, probing identity, eye gaze, expressions of emotion and lip reading to ask how these two disorders uniquely impact upon performance. Participants with WS and autism could be dissociated from those with general developmental delay and from each other primarily on the basis of eye gaze ability. Participants with WS showed strong eye gaze abilities whilst participants with autism had extreme difficulties. Although interpretation of expressions of emotion also showed a difference between groups, autism and WS did not uniquely impact upon the processing of identity or lip reading. The exploration also allowed the consideration of models of face perception; characterised by a typical modular structure in WS but a lack of modularity in autism. The second line of <b>inquiry</b> considered identity <b>processing</b> and firstly asked whether participants were more accurate at matching faces from internal or external features. Participants with WS showed an atypical use of internal features for matching unfamiliar faces, which may be linked to an atypical interaction style and exaggerated interest in unfamiliar people. Participants with autism used the same strategy to match faces of familiar and unfamiliar people and hence familiarity did not impact upon processing style. Subsequent chapters probed feature salience (eyes. v. mouth) and structural encoding. Across paradigms typically developing participants and those with WS showed greater accuracy using the eye than mouth region, a pattern not evident in autism. Regarding structural encoding, individuals with WS showed use of configural cues under the task demands implemented in this thesis, where individuals with autism were only able to interpret featural cues. Previous evidence of similar face processing styles in WS and autism were not supported. Taken together the findings provide further insights into face perception and social functioning in WS and autism. The research used the same participants across paradigms, considered level of functioning on the autistic spectrum and included investigations of WS and autism in the same research programme. Additional to the main experimental studies, pilot data is provided to open a new line of investigation into physiological arousal associated with holding eye contact in WS. Therefore, {{on the basis of the}} experiments conducted here, a number of suggestions are made to carry the research forward in future investigations. Throughout the thesis as a whole, comparisons are made between individuals with WS and autism that further our understanding of the links between face processing and social expertise.

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} various {{issues related to}} the {{allotment}} of elderly people care allowance. The introduction describes the current state of social policy and services; basic concepts used in this field were defined. The concept of old age and its epiphenomena were briefly and expertly characterized. The main part of the thesis is devoted to ways of obtaining, processing, allotment and functioning of the allowance for the care of elderly people in the region of Milevsko. Given the specifics of the individual Czech regions, it was necessary to describe generally the Milevsko region and to characterize the Department of Social Affairs at the Milevsko Municipal Authority, which pursuant to Czech legislation, carries out all activities associated with the agenda of the allowance for care in the defined region. The objective of the thesis was to map in detail the issues of the allowance care at various stages, i. e. from filing an application till its execution and to describe partly the subsequent use of the allowance. The details of the early stages of processing applications are described, i. e. where there are still many problematic issues. During my work on the problem, I cooperated closely with the staff at the Milevsko Municipal Authority, competent staff at the Department of Social Affairs and a selected sample of senior citizens in the locality. To achieve the set objective, I used the strategy of qualitative research, the method of interviewing and the technique of semi-controlled non-standard interviews of selected clients ? senior citizens ? with the staff of the Department of Social Affairs. The analysis of social and medical records of the client group, along with legislation for the care allowance, was used as an additional method. The outputs of the used techniques were recorded in detail and summarized using tables. The research results yielded many interesting findings; in particular it is still a relatively low general public awareness of the care allowance and it was demonstrated that the most important source of information for senior applicants was a social worker. What needs to be constantly improving is the awareness of senior citizens and their family members of what types of care and compensating aids or activities can be covered by care allowance. It is also necessary to explain to senior citizens and their families how to use the care allowance, such as checks by social workers. According to the findings, I can confirm that the care allowance is a very important factor that helps significantly to offset the dependence of senior citizens, although its amount is questionable. Another finding was seen in an irreplaceable role of the family, family members who provide the care of the elderly and the efforts of all who are involved in ensuring senior citizens can function in their natural environment, which I think is an extremely positive finding. In any case, ?horror? scenarios of abusing the care allowance were not confirmed, which confirms the fact that the control mechanisms in the legislation are relatively well adjusted. Improvements, according to the conclusions of my thesis, must be included in the <b>inquiry</b> stage of <b>processing</b> the care allowance; {{there is a need to}} combine general social methods with an extremely sensitive and personal approach to individual applicants in order to achieve optimal use of the care allowance for individuals who could stay in their natural environment as long as possible. Another area of potential development can be seen particularly in the interaction between the actors involved in the process of allotment of the care allowance, e. g. through automated processing of the agenda using electronic forms...|$|R
