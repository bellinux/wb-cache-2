5|$|Trees {{are either}} evergreen, having foliage that {{persists}} and remains green throughout the year, or deciduous, shedding their leaves {{at the end}} of the growing season and then having a <b>dormant</b> <b>period</b> without foliage. Most conifers are evergreens but larches (Larix and Pseudolarix) are deciduous, dropping their needles each autumn, and some species of cypress (Glyptostrobus, Metasequoia and Taxodium) shed small leafy shoots annually in a process known as cladoptosis. The crown is a name for the spreading top of a tree including the branches and leaves, while the uppermost layer in a forest, formed by the crowns of the trees, is known as the canopy. A sapling is a young tree.|$|E

25|$|Common bonsai species (particularly {{those from}} the Japanese tradition) are {{temperate}} climate trees from hardiness zones 7 to 9, and require moderate temperatures, moderate humidity, and full sun in summer with a dormancy period in winter that may need be near freezing. They do not thrive indoors, where the light is generally too dim, and humidity often too low, for them to grow properly. Only during their <b>dormant</b> <b>period</b> can they safely be brought indoors, and even then the plants require cold temperatures, reduced watering, and lighting that approximates {{the number of hours}} the sun is visible. Raising the temperature or providing more hours of light than available from natural daylight can cause the bonsai to break dormancy, which often weakens or kills it.|$|E

25|$|The {{eruption}} {{occurred over}} a century after the last eruption of Hekla proper, the longest <b>dormant</b> <b>period</b> since 1104. Before the eruption the volcano had been visible from the surrounding area but nothing remarkable was noticed. The eruption occurred at 6:41 am ± 3min with a loud roar; later eruptions could be heard throughout Iceland. An earthquake at 6:50 am measured 6 on the Mercalli intensity scale and increased the eruption intensity until it covered a 4km fissure on the ridge. The cloud from the eruption had ascended to a height of 30km by 7:08 am, the wind then carried it southwards towards Eyjafjallajökull, turning it black. Pumice first landed on Fljótshlíð at around 7:10 am, and tephra and ash continued falling until it formed a 3–10cm layer. A lava bomb that landed 32km from Hekla was 0.5m across and weighed 20kg. Between Vatnafjöll and Hekla, a layer of tephra up to a metre thick was deposited, including bombs with a diameter larger than 0.5m. Bombs with areas of 50m2 were dropped onto the slopes of Hekla, up to 1km away. 51hours after the eruption had started, ash fell on Helsinki, Finland, having covered 2,860km in this time.|$|E

500|$|Flower {{longevity}} {{varies by}} species and conditions, ranging from 5–20 days. After flowering leaf and root senescence sets in, {{and the plant}} appears to be 'dormant' till the next spring, conserving moisture. However the <b>dormant</b> <b>period</b> {{is also one of}} considerable activity within the bulb primordia. It is also a period during which the plant bulb may be susceptible to predators (see Pests and diseases below). Like many bulb plants from temperate regions, a period of exposure to cold is necessary before spring growth can begin. This protects the plant from growth during winter when intense cold may damage it. Warmer spring temperatures then initiate growth from the bulb. Early spring growth confers a number of advantages, including relative lack of competition for pollinators, and lack of deciduous shading. [...] The exception to requiring cold temperatures to initiate flowering is N. tazetta.|$|E
