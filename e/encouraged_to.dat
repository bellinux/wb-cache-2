5|$|According to a 1996 {{study by}} Barbara Metcalf, in TJ women were <b>encouraged</b> <b>to</b> {{participate}} {{since the beginning}} of the movement. Some scholars objected to the participation of women, but Muhammad Ilyas slowly gained their support and the first jamaat of women was formed in Nizamuddin, Delhi. Accompanied by a close male relative, (محرم), that is husband, brother, father or son, women are <b>encouraged</b> <b>to</b> go out in jamaats and work among other women and family members while following the rules of modesty, seclusion and segregation. They observe strict rules of hijab by covering their faces and hands. Jamaats of women sometimes participate in large annual meetings; otherwise, they commonly hold neighbourhood meetings. Since South Asian Islamic culture discourages women from going to the mosque and saintly shrines, these venues offer an opportunity for women to pray together and congregate religiously.|$|E
5|$|Across the German Empire nagelfiguren, war {{memorials}} {{made from}} iron nails embedded in wood, became popular, particularly in Austria. These took various forms, including knights, shields, eagles and crosses, {{as well as}} submarines. This practice had medieval origins, and the memorials were reinforced by the promotion of burgfrieden during the war, a medieval pact in which disparate German communities would put aside their differences during a conflict. In some cases, relatives of the deceased were <b>encouraged</b> <b>to</b> hammer memorial nails in {{as part of the}} ceremonies, while children might be <b>encouraged</b> <b>to</b> read out poems in a medieval style. At some nagelfiguren a charge was made for each nail used, with the revenues donated to charities supporting soldiers, orphans and others affected by the conflict.|$|E
