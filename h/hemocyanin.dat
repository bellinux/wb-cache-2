5|$|The protein <b>hemocyanin</b> is {{the oxygen}} carrier in most mollusks and some {{arthropods}} {{such as the}} horseshoe crab (Limulus polyphemus). Because <b>hemocyanin</b> is blue, these organisms have blue blood rather than the red blood of iron-based hemoglobin. Structurally related to <b>hemocyanin</b> are the laccases and tyrosinases. Instead of reversibly binding oxygen, these proteins hydroxylate substrates, illustrated by {{their role in the}} formation of lacquers.|$|E
5|$|Copper is {{essential}} to all living organisms as a trace dietary mineral {{because it is a}} key constituent of the respiratory enzyme complex cytochrome c oxidase. In molluscs and crustaceans, copper is a constituent of the blood pigment <b>hemocyanin,</b> replaced by the iron-complexed hemoglobin in fish and other vertebrates. In humans, copper is found mainly in the liver, muscle, and bone. The adult body contains between 1.4 and 2.1mg of copper per kilogram of body weight.|$|E
5|$|Molluscs' circulatory {{systems are}} mainly open. Although {{molluscs}} are coelomates, their coeloms {{are reduced to}} fairly small spaces enclosing the heart and gonads. The main body cavity is a hemocoel through which blood and coelomic fluid circulate and which encloses {{most of the other}} internal organs. These hemocoelic spaces act as an efficient hydrostatic skeleton. The blood contains the respiratory pigment <b>hemocyanin</b> as an oxygen-carrier. The heart consists of one or more pairs of atria (auricles), which receive oxygenated blood from the gills and pump it to the ventricle, which pumps it into the aorta (main artery), which is fairly short and opens into the hemocoel.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Hemocyanins</b> {{are found}} only in the Mollusca and Arthropoda: the {{earliest}} discoveries of <b>hemocyanins</b> were in the snail Helix pomatia (a mollusc) and in the horseshoe crab (an arthropod). They were subsequently found to be common among crustaceans and are utilized by some land arthropods such as the tarantula Eurypelma californicum, the emperor scorpion, and the centipede Scutigera coleoptrata.

40|$|The {{investigations}} of Eriksson-Quensel and Svedberg (1) have accurately defined the molecular weights and pH stability {{regions of the}} <b>hemocyanins.</b> They {{have shown that the}} <b>hemocyanins</b> from a large number of different species are dissociated into smaller molecules when the pH of the solution exceeds the critical limit {{on either side of the}} stability region. In all species studied it was found that the dissociated molecules had weights which were simple fractions of the molecular weights of the native <b>hemocyanins,</b> e. g. 1 / 2, 1 / 4, 1 / 8, 1 / 16, etc. They have also demonstrated that the dissociation of <b>hemocyanins</b> is in almost every instance largely a reversible phenomenon and that upon returning the solution to a pH within the stability region molecules of the original weight are reformed. From a consideration of these facts it seemed reasonable to speculate as to what would occur if the <b>hemocyanins</b> from two different species were mixed; dissociated into fractions and subsequently reassociate...|$|R
40|$|Pro-{{phenol oxidase}} [pro-PO; zymogen of phenol oxidase (monophenol, L-dopa:oxygen oxidoreductase, EC 1. 14. 18. 1) ] {{is present in}} the {{hemolymph}} plasma of the silkworm Bombyx mori. Pro-PO is a heterodimeric protein synthesized by hemocytes. A specific serine proteinase activates both subunits through a limited proteolysis. The amino acid sequences of both subunits were deduced from their respective cDNAs; amino acid sequence homology between the subunits was 51 %. The deduced amino acid sequences revealed domains highly homologous to the copper-binding site sequences (copper-binding sites A and B) of arthropod <b>hemocyanins.</b> The overall sequence homology between silkworm pro-PO and arthropod <b>hemocyanins</b> ranged from 29 to 39 %. Phenol oxidases from prokaryotes, fungi, and vertebrates have sequences homologous to only the copper-binding site B of arthropod <b>hemocyanins.</b> Thus, silkworm pro-PO DNA described here appears distinctive and more closely related to arthropod <b>hemocyanins.</b> The pro-PO-activating serine proteinase was shown to hydrolyze peptide bonds at the carboxyl side of arginine in the sequence-Asn- 49 -Arg- 50 -Phe- 51 -Gly- 52 - of both subunits. Amino groups of N termini of both subunits were indicated to be N-acetylated. The cDNAs of both pro-PO subunits lacked signal peptide sequences. This result supports our contention that mature pro-PO accumulates in the cytoplasm of hemocytes and is released by cell rupture, as for arthropod <b>hemocyanins...</b>|$|R
5|$|Like other arthropods, spiders are coelomates {{in which}} the coelom is reduced to small areas round the {{reproductive}} and excretory systems. Its place is largely taken by a hemocoel, a cavity that runs most {{of the length of}} the body and through which blood flows. The heart is a tube in {{the upper part of the}} body, with a few ostia that act as non-return valves allowing blood to enter the heart from the hemocoel but prevent it from leaving before it reaches the front end. However, in spiders, it occupies only the upper part of the abdomen, and blood is discharged into the hemocoel by one artery that opens at the rear end of the abdomen and by branching arteries that pass through the pedicle and open into several parts of the cephalothorax. Hence spiders have open circulatory systems. The blood of many spiders that have book lungs contains the respiratory pigment <b>hemocyanin</b> to make oxygen transport more efficient.|$|E
25|$|Spiders, {{like most}} arthropods, {{have an open}} circulatory system, i.e., {{they do not have}} true blood, or veins to convey it. Rather, their bodies are filled with haemolymph, which is pumped through arteries by a heart into spaces called sinuses {{surrounding}} their internal organs. The haemolymph contains <b>hemocyanin,</b> a respiratory protein similar in function to hemoglobin. <b>Hemocyanin</b> contains two copper atoms, tinting the haemolymph with a faint blue color.|$|E
25|$|Like most molluscs, {{cephalopods}} use <b>hemocyanin,</b> a copper-containing protein, {{rather than}} hemoglobin, to transport oxygen. As a result, their blood is colorless when deoxygenated and turns blue {{when exposed to}} air.|$|E

40|$|The {{structures}} of respiratory proteins such as hemoglobins and <b>hemocyanins</b> show obvious hierarchies. They {{belong to the}} class of allosteric macromolecules with cooperative functional properties, as do key metabolic enzymes. When examining the molecular mechanisms on which allostery and cooperativity are based, it could be shown for arthropod <b>hemocyanins</b> that the structural hierarchy of these macromolecules is reflected in a functional hierarchy. This relationship is described quantitatively in the "nesting" model. This model also offers explanations for the physiological significance of the prominent hierarchy of these molecules...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Hemocyanins</b> (also spelled haemocyanins and {{abbreviated}} Hc) are {{proteins that}} transport oxygen throughout {{the bodies of}} some invertebrate animals. These metalloproteins contain two copper atoms that reversibly bind a single oxygen molecule (O2). They are second only to hemoglobin in frequency of use as an oxygen transport molecule. Unlike the hemoglobin in red blood cells found in vertebrates, <b>hemocyanins</b> are not bound to blood cells but are instead suspended directly in the hemolymph. Oxygenation causes a color change between the colorless Cu(I) deoxygenated form and the blue Cu(II) oxygenated form.|$|R

Hemolymph is composed of water, inorganic salts (mostly sodium, chlorine, potassium, magnesium, and calcium), and organic compounds (mostly carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids).

25|$|Lobsters, like snails and spiders, have blue blood {{due to the}} {{presence}} of <b>hemocyanin</b> which contains copper. In contrast, vertebrates and many other animals have red blood from iron-rich hemoglobin. Lobsters possess a green hepatopancreas, called the tomalley by chefs, which functions as the animal's liver and pancreas.|$|E
25|$|Molluscs {{generally}} possess gills {{that allow}} gas exchange between the aqueous environment and their circulatory systems. These animals also possess a heart that pumps blood containing <b>hemocyanin</b> as its oxygen-capturing molecule. Hence, this respiratory system {{is similar to}} that of vertebrate fish. The respiratory system of gastropods can include either gills or a lung.|$|E
40|$|<b>Hemocyanins</b> are giant {{biological}} macromolecules {{acting as}} oxygen-transporting glycoproteins.

Based on the structural analyses of molluscan Hcs it is suggested that the carbohydrate chains of the glycoproteins seem to interact with surface-exposed amino acid or carbohydrate residues of the viruses through van der Waals interactions...|$|R
40|$|Arthropodan <b>hemocyanins,</b> prophenoloxidases (PPOs), {{and insect}} hexamerins form a {{superfamily}} of hemolymph proteins that we propose {{to call the}} AHPH superfamily. The evolutionary and functional relationships of these proteins are illuminated by a new embryonic hemolymph protein (EHP) that is expressed during early stages of development in the grasshopper embryo. EHP is a 78 -kDa soluble protein present initially in the yolk sac content, {{and later in the}} embryonic hemolymph. Protein purification and peptide sequencing were used to identify an embryonic cDNA clone coding for EHP. In situ hybridization identifies hemocytes as EHP-expressing cells. As deduced from the cDNA clone, EHP is a secreted protein with two potential glycosylation sites. Sequence analysis defines EHP {{as a member of the}} AHPH superfamily. Phylogenetic analyses with all the currently available AHPH proteins, including EHP, were performed to ascertain the evolutionary history of this protein superfamily. We used both the entire protein sequence and each of the three domains present in the AHPH proteins. The phylogenies inferred for each of the domains suggest a mosaic evolution of these protein modules. Phylogenetic and multivariate analyses consistently group EHP with crustacean <b>hemocyanins</b> and, less closely, with insect hexamerins, relative to cheliceratan <b>hemocyanins</b> and PPOs. The grasshopper protein rigorously preserves the residues involved in oxygen binding, oligomerization, and allosteric regulation of the oxygen transport proteins. Although insects were thought not to have <b>hemocyanins,</b> we propose that EHP functions as an oxygen transport or storage protein during embryonic development.

40|$|Background: Tyrosinases, tyrosinase-related proteins, {{catechol}} oxidases and <b>hemocyanins</b> {{comprise the}} type- 3 copper protein family and {{are involved in}} a variety of biological processes, including pigment formation, innate immunity and oxygen transport. Although this family is present in the three domains of life, its origin and early evolution are not well understood. Previous analyses of type- 3 copper proteins largely have focussed on specific animal and plant phyla. Results: Here, we combine genomic, phylogenetic and structural analyses to show that the original type- 3 copper protein possessed a signal peptide and may have been secreted (we designate proteins of this type the α subclass). This ancestral type- 3 copper protein gene underwent two duplication events, the first prior to the divergence of the unikont eukaryotic lineages and the second before the diversification of animals. The former duplication gave rise to a cytosolic form (β) and the latter to a membrane-bound form (γ). Structural comparisons reveal that the active site of α and γ forms are covered by aliphatic amino acids, and the β form has a highly conserved aromatic residue in this position. The subsequent evolution of this gene family in modern lineages of multicellular eukaryotes is typified by the loss of {{one or more of these}} three subclasses and the lineage-specific expansion of one or both of the remaining subclasses. Conclusions: The diversity of type- 3 copper proteins in animals and other eukaryotes is consistent with two ancient gene duplication events leading to α, β and γ subclasses, followed by the differential loss and expansion of one or more of these subclasses in specific kingdoms and phyla. This has led to many lineage-specific type- 3 copper protein repertoires and in some cases the independent evolution of functionally-classified tyrosinases and <b>hemocyanins.</b> For example, the oxygen-carrying <b>hemocyanins</b> in arthropods evolved from a β-subclass tyrosinase, whilst <b>hemocyanins</b> in molluscs and urochordates evolved independently from an α-subclass tyrosinase. Minor conformational changes at the active site of α, β and γ forms can produce type- 3 copper proteins with capacities to either carry oxygen (<b>hemocyanins),</b> oxidize diphenols (catechol oxidase) or o-hydroxylate monophenols (tyrosinases) and appear to underlie some functional convergencesFull Tex...|$|R

40|$|The {{structural}} {{characteristics of}} oxy- and deoxy-hemocyanins {{have been investigated}} using X-ray absorption spectroscopy both in the near-edge (XANES) {{and for the first}} shell contribution in the EXAFS region. Several arthropodan and molluscan <b>hemocyanins</b> have been studied in order to trace the inter- and intra-phyla differences. The XANES spectra of oxy-hemocyanins of the different species are remarkably similar, consistent with a very strongly conserved co-ordination geometry of the copper active site. In contrast, small but significant differences are observed between the deoxy-forms of arthropodan and molluscan proteins. In particular, the XANES spectra of deoxy-arthropodan <b>hemocyanins</b> (with the exception of L. polyphemus Hc) show a more intense edge feature at approximately 8983 eV. This difference is tentatively assigned to a more planar geometry of the copper-ligands system in the arthropodan rather than in the molluscan proteins. The first shell analysis of the EXAFS modulation is consistent with the presence of n = 3 N 2 imidazole nitrogens at an average distance of 1. 92 ± 0. 03 Å from copper in all the deoxy-hemocyanins investigated. Binding of dioxygen results for all <b>hemocyanins</b> in the increase of the number of first shell back-scattering atoms to n = 5 with average distances of 1. 93 Å. Alternatively, by separating the contribution of N 2 imidazole nitrogens and of peroxide O-atoms, n = 3 ligands at 1. 98 ± 0. 03 Å and n = 2 ligands at 1. 87 ± 0. 03 Å are found...|$|R

50|$|The {{blood of}} most mollusks - {{including}} cephalopods and gastropods - {{as well as}} some arthropods, such as horseshoe crabs, is blue, as it contains the copper-containing protein <b>hemocyanin</b> at concentrations of about 50 grams per liter. <b>Hemocyanin</b> is colorless when deoxygenated and dark blue when oxygenated. The blood in the circulation of these creatures, which generally live in cold environments with low oxygen tensions, is grey-white to pale yellow, and it turns dark blue when exposed to the oxygen in the air, as seen when they bleed.
