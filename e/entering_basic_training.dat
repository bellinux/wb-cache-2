Incoming trainees were screened for rubella susceptibility, and female trainees were additionally screened for pregnancy. During the period October 1977 to December 1978, an overall rubella susceptibility rate of 17. 3 per cent was determined for 71, 387 trainees <b>entering</b> <b>basic</b> <b>training.</b> Flights (50 persons each) {{to which these}} trainees are assigned varied widely in susceptibility from 0. 0 - 47. 7 per cent.

This thesis uses binary logit models {{to examine the}} effects of personal background characteristics and local area economic conditions on an individual's likelihood to leave the Delayed Entry Program (DEP). The DEP allows individuals to contract for enlistment up to one year prior to starting <b>basic</b> <b>training.</b> Between fiscal years 1991 and 1996, over 1. 1 million individuals joined the DEP for all four military branches, yet 167, 134 (15 percent) never <b>entered</b> <b>basic</b> <b>training.</b> The Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) provided a data file that included all individuals who joined the DEP between October 1989 and June 1996. The DMDC raw data file was merged with county-level unemployment data provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. DEP attrition was modeled as a function of gender, educational level, dependent status, Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT) score, race, ethnicity, moral waiver status, and county-level unemployment rates. Results show that a person's likelihood of leaving the DEP is affected most strongly by gender and educational level. Women and high school seniors are more likely than men and high school graduates to leave the DEP. County-level unemployment rates have a significant, but small, negative effect on DEP attrition.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to analyze factors that {{influence}} decisions to enlist in the U. S. Army. This thesis uses 1997 New Recruit Survey data from the Army Recruiting Command and examines new recruits who contracted between October 1, 1996 and September 30, 1997, but had not yet <b>entered</b> <b>basic</b> <b>training.</b> This study employs cross-tabulations and a Multi-Nomial Logit model, using PROC CATMOD, to analyze the data. The results show that recruits who differ in gender, ethnicity, past status, educational expectations, years of service: and contact initiation are influenced to enlist by different factors. Educational incentives, especially the Army's College Fund, and self- development, including "to do something I can be proud of," are given {{as the most important}} reasons to enlist. Recruiters and friends are the most influential sources of information about the Army, and TV advertisements are the most influential sources in the mass media. Key barriers to enlistment are the perceptions that service in the military is a serious obstacle to educational progress, followed by military life, and conflicting interests. Immediate family members, especially parents, are key influencers in the enlistment decision. The results suggest that the Army should strive to improve its image and service environment, as well as continue to sustain enlistment incentives and resources at an adequate level.

40|$|Background/Objectives: Infection with {{varicella}} zoster virus (VZV) produces lifelong immunity, but {{duration of}} post-vaccination immunity has not been established. The {{purpose of this study}} is to determine if a difference exists in the long-term seropositivity of anti-VZV antibodies in a cohort of young adults who were vaccinated against varicella as compared to a similar cohort with a history of chickenpox disease, and to determine which variables best predict waning seropositivity following varicella vaccination. Methods: This retrospective cohort study captures immunization and serology data from approximately 10, 000 recruits who <b>entered</b> <b>basic</b> military <b>training</b> between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2015, and who have childhood immunization records in the Air Force Aeromedical Services Information Management System. Varicella vaccine immunogenicity was determined relative to the immunogenicity of chickenpox disease, as measured by multiplex flow immunoassay. Among vaccine recipients, waning seroimmunity was modeled and adjusted for several important covariates Results: Basic military trainees who received varicella vaccine in childhood were 24 % less likely to be seropositive to VZV than trainees who were exempt from vaccine due to a history of chickenpox disease. There was no significant difference in seropositivity between male and female trainees. The odds of a vaccinated trainee being seropositive to VZV decreased by 8 % with each year elapsed since vaccination. Seroprevalence declined below estimated herd immunity thresholds in vaccinated trainees born after 1994, and in the cohort as a whole for trainees born after 1995. Conclusion: Despite prior vaccination, seroimmunity in a large cohort of young adults unexposed to wildtype VZV failed to meet the estimated threshold for herd immunity. If vaccination in accordance with the current US VZV vaccination schedule is inadequate to maintain herd immunity, young adults not previously exposed to wild-type VZV may be at increased risk for varicella outbreaks...|$|R
