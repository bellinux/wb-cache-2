5|$|At a 2006 {{conference on}} Commonwealth honours, Christopher McCreery, {{an expert on}} Canada's honours, raised the concern that the three <b>grades</b> <b>of</b> the Order of Canada were {{insufficient}} to recognize the nation's very best; one suggestion was to add two more levels to the order, equivalent to knighthoods in Australian and British orders. The order of precedence also came under scrutiny, particularly the anomaly that all three <b>grades</b> <b>of</b> the Order of Canada supersede the top levels {{of each of the}} other orders (except the Order of Merit), contrary to international practice.|$|E

5|$|About fifty <b>grades</b> <b>of</b> {{titanium}} and {{titanium alloys}} are designed and currently used, although {{only a couple}} of dozen are readily available commercially. The ASTM International recognizes 31 <b>grades</b> <b>of</b> titanium metal and alloys, of which Grades 1 through 4 are commercially pure (unalloyed). Those four vary in tensile strength as a function of oxygen content, with Grade 1 being the most ductile (lowest tensile strength with an oxygen content of 0.18%), and Grade 4 the least ductile (highest tensile strength with an oxygen content of 0.40%). The remaining grades are alloys, each designed for specific properties of ductility, strength, hardness, electrical resistivity, creep resistance, specific corrosion resistance, and combinations thereof.|$|E
5|$|The Oberkommando der Wehrmacht kept {{separate}} Knight's Cross lists, one {{for each}} of the three military branches, Heer (Army), Kriegsmarine (Navy), Luftwaffe (Air force) and for the Waffen-SS. In each of these lists a unique sequential number was assigned to each recipient. The same numbering paradigm was applied to the higher <b>grades</b> <b>of</b> the Knight's Cross, one list per grade.|$|E
5|$|The {{incidence}} of TBI varies by age, gender, region and other factors.

50|$|The <b>Grade</b> <b>of</b> Service can be {{measured}} using different sections of a network. When a call is routed {{from one end to}} another, it will pass through several exchanges.

5000|$|Due to {{the fact}} that the strong <b>grade</b> <b>of</b> short consonants coincides with the weak <b>grade</b> <b>of</b> long consonants, it may not always be {{straightforward}} to identify the <b>grade</b> <b>of</b> a particular consonant. The weak <b>grade</b> <b>of</b> long consonants still triggers the weak grade on a preceding syllable, however, even though the consonant itself is no longer long. It can usually be recognised that there is a short plosive in a closed syllable, implying that it must be the weak <b>grade</b> <b>of</b> an originally long consonant. Examples include: ...|$|R

5|$|At {{the head}} of the temple {{hierarchy}} was the high priest, who oversaw all the temple's religious and economic functions and in the largest cults was an important political figure. Beneath him might be as many as three <b>grades</b> <b>of</b> subordinate priests who could substitute for him in ceremonies. While these higher ranks were full-time positions from the New Kingdom onward, the lower <b>grades</b> <b>of</b> priesthood still worked in shifts {{over the course of the}} year. Whereas many priests did a variety of menial tasks, the clergy also contained several ritual specialists. Prominent among these specialized roles was that of the lector priest who recited hymns and spells during temple rituals, and who hired out his magical services to laymen. Besides its priests, a large temple employed singers, musicians, and dancers to perform during rituals, plus the farmers, bakers, artisans, builders, and administrators who supplied and managed its practical needs. In the Ptolemaic era, temples could also house people who had sought asylum within the precinct, or recluses who voluntarily dedicated themselves to serving the god and living in its household. A major cult, therefore, could have well over 150 full or part-time priests, with tens of thousands of non-priestly employees working on its lands across the country. These numbers contrast with mid-sized temples, which may have had 10 to 25 priests, and with the smallest provincial temples, which might have only one.|$|E
5|$|Before the Crimean War, {{there was}} no {{official}} standardised system for recognition of gallantry within the British armed forces. Officers were eligible for an award {{of one of the}} junior <b>grades</b> <b>of</b> the Order of the Bath and brevet promotions while a Mention in Despatches existed as an alternative award for acts of lesser gallantry. This structure was very limited; in practice awards of the Order of the Bath were confined to officers of field rank. Brevet promotions or Mentions in Despatches were largely confined to those who were under the immediate notice of the commanders in the field, generally members of the commander's own staff.|$|E

40|$|Nebulized {{epinephrine}} decreases oxygen requirements, respiratory rate, wheezing, and retractions and may lower hospitalization {{rates and}} length <b>of</b> stay (<b>Grade</b> <b>of</b> Recommendation: A, based on consistent randomized controlled trials [RCTs] and systematic reviews). At best, other beta- 2 agonists provide modest short-term improvement in {{mild to moderate}} bronchiolitis (<b>Grade</b> <b>of</b> Recommendation: A, consistent RCTs and systematic reviews), and may be indicated in patients with preexisting asthma. Discontinue bronchodilators if patients do not respond quickly, because the bronchodilators may cause respiratory deterioration (<b>Grade</b> <b>of</b> Recommendation: D, expert opinion). Supplemental oxygen for low oxygen saturation and suctioning may improve respiratory status (<b>Grade</b> <b>of</b> Recommendation: D, expert opinion). Chest physiotherapy (<b>Grade</b> <b>of</b> Recommendation: D, expert opinion), cool mist (<b>Grade</b> <b>of</b> Recommendation: D, expert opinion), and aerosolized saline (<b>Grade</b> <b>of</b> Recommendation: A, based on RCTs) are not recommended.

5|$|Diptera were {{traditionally}} {{broken down}} into two suborders, Nematocera and Brachycera, distinguished by the differences in antennae. The Nematocera are recognized by their elongated bodies and many-segmented, often feathery antennae as represented by mosquitoes and crane flies. The Brachycera have rounder bodies and much shorter antennae. Subsequent studies have identified the Nematocera as being non-monophyletic with modern phylogenies placing the Brachycera within <b>grades</b> <b>of</b> groups formerly placed in the Nematocera. The construction of a phylogenetic tree {{has been the subject}} of ongoing research. The following cladogram is based on the FLYTREE project.|$|E
5|$|Freemasonry or Masonry {{consists}} of fraternal organisations that trace their origins {{to the local}} fraternities of stonemasons, which {{from the end of}} the fourteenth century regulated the qualifications of stonemasons and their interaction with authorities and clients. The degrees of freemasonry retain the three <b>grades</b> <b>of</b> medieval craft guilds, those of Apprentice, Journeyman or fellow (now called Fellowcraft), and Master Mason. These are the degrees offered by Craft (or Blue Lodge) Freemasonry. Members of these organisations are known as Freemasons or Masons. There are additional degrees, which vary with locality and jurisdiction, and are usually administered by different bodies than the craft degrees.|$|E
