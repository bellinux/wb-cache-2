Partial discharge detection is an efficient diagnosis method to prevent the failure of electric equipments arising from degrading insulation.

40|$|Partial {{discharges}} (PD) {{generated in}} high-voltage equipment {{can lead to}} its complete destruction, as damage in external and internal insulation slowly evolves into severe faults. Thus, early detection of this condition is imperative. Recent developments {{in the application of}} radiometry to this area have shown how PD can be detected from the vicinity of energized equipment. Radiometric PD detection is advantageous to electric utilities since the high-voltage equipment need not be taken out of service and the measurement can be made from a safe area, without the need for any physical or electrical connection. This paper describes how the electrical connection arrangements influence the emission of radio frequency radiation generated by PD. The radio frequency response of a <b>high-voltage</b> <b>test</b> rig has been measured in order to compensate the received signal for the effect of the structure.

40|$|Purpose. Investigation of the {{formation}} of space charge in the region of the apex of lighting rod, under the action of the electric field of a thunderstorm cloud, to evaluate the efficiency of elements of lighting protection systems. Methodology. We have applied the mathematical simulation of electromagnetic field distribution on the top of metal rod by different forms. As a mathematical apparatus, we use the finite element method. We considered two forms of the rod section: round and square. The round (cylindrical) rod has a sharp apex. The square rod has a flat top. The experimental study investigates the features of corona discharge formation. A <b>high-voltage</b> <b>test</b> equipment is created an electric field. Experiments carried out using a configuration consisting a potential plate and vertical rod electrode on grounded plate. The electric field strength varied from 1 kVm- 1 to 100 kVm- 1. This range corresponds to the thunderstorm condition. Results. We have obtained a correlation between the corona current and the strength of the electric field for various shapes of the rod top. The results of experimental studies confirmed the correctness of the conclusions of theoretical estimates. We show that the time parameters of streamer current pulses vary by no more than 30 %, but a streamer charge increase to three time with increasing electric field strength. We proposed and applied a method for measuring the velocity of motion of a streamer in the discharge gap. As a result, it is established that the streamer speed is nonlinear in time. For a discharge gap of 1. 2 m, the speed varies from 1. 8 ∙ 104 m/s to 1. 1 ∙ 106 m/s. Originality. For the first time, we have carried out a complex of studies of corona discharge parameters from lightning protector rod to apply for the certification procedure of ESE terminals. Practical value.

40|$|AbstractAn 81 -year-old man was {{scheduled}} for an elective implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) generator exchange because of battery depletion. The Atlas™+ DR ICD (St. Jude Medical, Sylmar, CA) had been implanted in February 2007 for primary prevention. The ICD lead (Riata 1570, St. Jude Medical, Sylmar, CA) had been positioned via the left cephalic vein at the right ventricular apex. Prior to the ICD generator exchange, which took place 70 months after the initial implantation, all routine device interrogations revealed normal electrical lead parameters, and cine-fluoroscopy of the lead showed normal appearance without any apparent fracture. We attempted to conduct <b>high-voltage</b> shock <b>testing,</b> as there was concern {{about the possibility of}} silent lead malfunction. Following delivery of the first high-voltage shock, the device declared “possibility of output circuit damage. ” Subsequent shocks could not be delivered. Nonetheless, other lead parameters remained stable, and high-voltage lead impedance was < 20 Ω. The following day, the failed generator was replaced with a new ICD generator and connected with a new ICD lead. We then tested the new device by inducing ventricular fibrillation, which was defibrillated successfully. Although electric screening in asymptomatic patients with the Riata ICD lead remains controversial, it should be remembered that there are patients with or without detected cable externalization in whom only <b>high-voltage</b> shock <b>testing</b> can disclose lead malfunction.

40|$|This thesis first {{describes}} the reverse method of transformer design. An existing magnetic model for full-core shell-type transformers, based on circuit theory, is summarised. A magneto-static {{finite element model}} is introduced and two sample transformers are analysed. The magnetic model based on finite element analysis is shown to be more accurate than the model based on circuit theory. Partial-core resonant transformers are then introduced and their characteristics are explained using an equivalent circuit model. A method of measuring the winding inductances under resonant operation is developed and used to investigate the characteristics of two different tuning methods. A finite element model of the partial-core resonant transformer is developed by adopting the model for full-core shell-type transformers. The model results accurately match the measured inductance variation characteristics of three sample transformers and predict the onset of core saturation in both axial-offset and centre-gap arrangements. A new design of partial-core resonant transformer is arrived at, having an alternative core and winding layout, as well as multiple winding taps. The finite element model is extended to accommodate the new design and a framework of analysis tools is developed. A general design methodology for partial-core resonant transformers with fixed inductance is developed. A multiple design method is applied to obtain an optimal design for a given set of specifications and restrictions. The design methodology is then extended to devices with variable inductance. Three design examples of partial-core resonant transformers with variable inductance are presented. In the first two design examples, existing devices are replaced.

Unlike conventional methods, noise generators employing a linear feedback shift register (LFSR) or resistor thermal noise amplification techniques, the user has full {{control over the}} characteristics of the Gaussian signal. Indeed, the frequency band, the mean, and the variance of the distribution are fully programmable over the voltage range within the supply rails. The method consists of digitally encoding the specified Gaussian signal in a random access memory (RAM), using pulse-density modulation, followed by filtering the output bit stream using an analog low-pass filter. It is demonstrated that the quality of the generated noise signal is independent {{of the quality of the}} filter used; hence, making the noise source highly robust.

40|$|An {{evaluation}} of the impedance of ground electrodes under dc, ac or impulse conditions requires reliable and accurate measurement of the current and earth potential rise (EPR) {{at the point of}} injection. This is commonly achieved in wired systems by arranging current-injection and measurement circuits in quadrature, but such wide-area test arrangements are not always possible due to prohibitive environmental conditions or site access restrictions. This problem has been encountered in establishing a large-scale test facility in the lower lake of the Dinorwig pumped-storage power station in Llanberis, North Wales. The geography of the site restricts the location of both current source and data acquisition equipment to a common location on the lake shore, with all wired circuits confined to a narrow corridor along a floating pontoon. Simulations have shown that wired systems arranged in this way lead to significant measurement error due to circuit coupling, increasing with both the frequency and magnitude of the injected current.
