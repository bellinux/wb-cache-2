Another term for <b>insert</b> cards is chase cards. <b>Insert</b> cards either have their own numbering system (although some <b>insert</b> cards may have no number). <b>Insert</b> cards are found less frequently than base cards. Autographed cards, memorabilia cards and parallel cards are also classified as <b>insert</b> cards. <b>Insert</b> cards are randomly <b>inserted</b> into packs at a specific ratio.

As part of a removable cable, it <b>inserts</b> into an upstream port on a device, such as a printer.

5|$|Along with {{quadratic}} probing {{and double}} hashing, linear probing {{is a form}} of open addressing. In these schemes, each cell of a hash table stores a single key–value pair. When the hash function causes a collision by mapping a new key to a cell of the hash table that is already occupied by another key, linear probing searches the table for the closest following free location and <b>inserts</b> the new key there. Lookups are performed in the same way, by searching the table sequentially starting at the position given by the hash function, until finding a cell with a matching key or an empty cell.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis {{study focused}} on <b>insert</b> {{injection}} molding process, which is molded the melted polymer around an <b>inserted</b> part placed in the molded cavity of injection molding. The interfacial adhesive property between the <b>inserted</b> part and an injected polymer was investigated. The glass fiber reinforced polypropylene (GF/PP) with various adhesive lengths of 0, 5, 10 and 15 mm was prepared as the <b>inserted</b> part. Polypropylene was injected to the mold. The effects of the <b>inserted</b> parts surface roughness, pre-heated the <b>inserted</b> parts and the barrel temperature on the adhesive property of GF/PP-PP injection molded were studied. It was found that interfacial adhesive property of GF/PP-PP <b>insert</b> injection molded increased according with increasing of surface roughness, pre-heated the <b>insert</b> part and increasing the barrel temperature. In addition, the effect of vent barrel on the adhesive property was evaluated. It {{was found that the}} adhesive property of GFPP-PP <b>insert</b> injection molded was unchanged by using the vent barrel system. The fracture mode of the <b>insert</b> injection molded specimens was depended on the adhesive length of the <b>inserted</b> part. The interfacial strength of the GF/PP-PP <b>insert</b> injection molded would be considering on the length at L= 0 mm, which was attributed to the adhesive normal strength of the specimens...|$|R
