30|$|According to the {{national}} census of the Kenya Republic (2010), about 202, 651 people live in Kajiado County with a population growth rate estimated to be 4.5 %. Most of the residents are traditionally pastoralists (Ogutu et al. 2013). However, due to emerging socio-economic opportunities and climate change, formal employment, cultivation, <b>group</b> <b>ranching,</b> and trade have been adopted in order to diversify income sources (Kioko and Okello 2010).|$|E
40|$|This {{initial report}} {{constitutes}} {{an effort to}} provide background data on the technical and administrative measures involved during the implementation of <b>group</b> <b>ranching</b> in Narok District of Kenya Maasailand. As part of this report, I have outlined many of the social, political, and economic constraints impinging on ranch development and briefly examined {{some of the ways}} in which the costs and benefits of group ranch development are affecting the interests of various segments of Narok Maasai. Maasai stockowners are, of necessity, making certain adjustments in herd management practices, although these adjustments are not always consistent with the aims of ranch development planners; nor are these adjustments necessarily in the best interests of the Narok Maasai in general. Preliminary investigation shows that, rather than facilitating economic development without disenfranchising large numbers of people, <b>group</b> <b>ranching,</b> together with the introduction of wheat cropping, is stimulating feelings of insecurity among many Maasai herders that they will be eventually forced out of the pastoral economy. This report attempts to delve into the reasons underlying this insecurity by offering ethnographic data concerning inter- and intra-group ranch rivalries; inter-generational conflict; land use controversies; and points out problem areas which I intend to investigate more fully during my period of research tenure in Narok District...|$|E
40|$|The {{socio-economic}} conditions which affect development in general, and <b>group</b> <b>ranching</b> in particular, among the Maasai of Narok District, Kenya are analyzed. Systems {{of relationships between}} Maasai social units are examined to demonstrate how different individuals and groups within Maasai society, each with a diversity of vested interests, react to the opportunities and disadvantages offered them by imposed development programs and altered ecological conditions. A single group ranch, Rotian OlMakongo, {{is the focus of}} intensive study. Maasai on this ranch, which is located in a semi-high potential wheat-growing area of Narok District, have largely been resistant to planned change. The reaction of group ranch members to development are analyzed showing how lineage and clan affiliation, age set relations, stock friendships and other systems of relations affect individual and group decision-making. On the one hand the analysis demonstrates how the structure of the group ranch itself is not conducive to the consensual decision-making which ranch planning officials anticipated would occur regarding such important issues as stock limitation. On the other hand traditional Maasai social units are seen at different times both to promote and inhibit new organizational forms to deal with a changing set of economic, ecological and political conditions. A general trend toward impoverishment, disenfranchisement and supplementary economic pursuits is outlined. However, traditional pastoralism is not seen as being totally subsumed by a more dominant, essentially capitalistic mode of production. Rather, traditional pastoralism is seen to define the transformation of internal forms through a structure which incorporates the modern sector. The tension between the traditional and modern sectors is not their disassociation, but rather, their integration into the dynamic process of change within the structure...|$|E
30|$|Dissatisfaction with corrupt <b>group</b> <b>ranch</b> committees, {{dilution}} {{of individual}} shareholding as population size increased {{and a desire}} for security of tenure led <b>group</b> <b>ranch</b> members to push for the subdivision of <b>group</b> <b>ranches</b> (Galaty 1999; Homewood et al. 2004; Mwangi 2007 a; Seno and Shaw 2002; Thompson and Homewood 2002). In the Mara, many <b>group</b> <b>ranches</b> are now subdivided, with individual land parcels allocated to male <b>group</b> <b>ranch</b> members. In many areas, {{this has been a}} long and contentious process, fraught with conflict, inequality and land-grabbing (Homewood et al. 2004; Mwangi 2007 b; Thompson and Homewood 2002; Thompson et al. 2009).|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} how individuals {{gain access to the}} land to enclose, the aged respondents indicated that enclosures existed even before the colonial period. Due to their migratory nature, these enclosures would be abandoned and new ones established in the next settlement area. During the colonial era, grazing regulations which partitioned the Pokot grazing lands into sections were instituted by the administrators. Later, these areas were divided into <b>group</b> <b>ranches</b> under the <b>group</b> <b>ranch</b> management system in a bid to control livestock diseases. Owing to their migratory lifestyle, the Pokots were not in favour of this management system. After Kenya gained her independence in 1963, the instituted <b>group</b> <b>ranch</b> committees were not able to regulate grazing like during the colonial times and the scheme was poorly coordinated hence overstocking and land degradation. Since most individuals were not satisfied with the <b>group</b> <b>ranch</b> operations, the land enclosure movement easily received support of <b>group</b> <b>ranch</b> committee members, especially after witnessing the initial results of the project in demonstration sites set in schools and churches. This was followed by community discussions around 1990 – 1993 which sought to strengthen the resolution of <b>group</b> <b>ranch</b> members to demarcate the <b>group</b> <b>ranches</b> into individual land parcels. However, this did not happen until 1997, when several <b>group</b> <b>ranches</b> passed a resolution to wind up <b>group</b> <b>ranches</b> in favour of individual land holdings. Informal <b>group</b> <b>ranch</b> subdivisions in Chepareria were hastily conducted and completed. Through these subdivisions, individuals were given rights to use their land holding which represented some de facto degree of ownership. As of today, the process of adjudication is still on-going. While there exists legal technicality of survey and registration of individual title deeds among <b>group</b> <b>ranch</b> members; there is proof that this is happening as evidenced by the 51.7  % of respondents who already have titled deeds as indicated in Table  1.|$|R
40|$|This report {{consists}} of analyses and conclusions {{based on the}} material presented in two previous reports concerning the <b>Group</b> <b>Ranch</b> Development Programme in Kaputiei Section of Kenya Maasailand, The interrelated sociological and ecological factors are examined which have led the Kaputiei Maasai to continue their traditional semi-nomadic practices instead of settling on their <b>group</b> <b>ranches.</b> In addition, {{the issue of whether}} the successes of the pilot scheme on Poka <b>group</b> <b>ranch,</b> can be replicated on the other <b>group</b> <b>ranches</b> in Kaputiei Section is analysed in detail...|$|R
30|$|The {{livelihood}} changes {{associated with}} enclosures depend {{on an ongoing}} privatization of land. Officially, land is registered under different statutory and customary tenure through individual title deeds, <b>group</b> <b>ranches,</b> trust land and government land. While the upper areas of Chepareria hold individual title deeds, the <b>group</b> <b>ranches</b> and trust land of the lower areas have and continuously continue to be sub-divided into privately enclosed land based on informal contractual agreements to secure their properties. On <b>group</b> <b>ranches,</b> residents are registered under <b>group</b> <b>ranch</b> title deeds that officially imply legitimate access to the whole <b>group</b> <b>ranch</b> land. However, as people have sub-divided and privatized <b>group</b> <b>ranches</b> with informal ownership agreements, people {{are not allowed to}} trespass on private properties and the enclosures work effectively as a demarcation of this property. The same conditions apply on trust land that is officially registered to allow for traditional communal tenure practices.|$|R
40|$|The <b>group</b> <b>ranch</b> {{system is}} one of the best land {{ownership}} and livestock production strategies in the dry lands of the world where the potential for rain-fed agriculture is limited. This has resulted in numerous studies on the establishment of <b>group</b> <b>ranches,</b> their dissolution and coping strategies but with less focus on the sustainability of the <b>group</b> <b>ranches.</b> It is against this background that this study investigated environmental characteristics influencing choice of sustainability strategies adopted by <b>group</b> <b>ranches</b> in Samburu County, Kenya. The investigation adopted a descriptive survey research design employing use of Questionnaires, Key Informant Interviews, Focus Group Discussions and observation as primary data collection methods. The study used content validity and Cronbach’s alpha methods to measure validity and reliability of the research instruments, respectively. The target population for the study was the 16, 611 registered members in 38 <b>group</b> <b>ranches</b> spread out in the County. The study sampled 12 <b>group</b> <b>ranches</b> with approximately 5, 643 members from which 374 respondents were systematically sampled. Purposive sampling was used to select Key Informants and the participants in the Focus Group Discussions. The study employed Multi-linear Regression to analyse environmental characteristics determining choice of sustainability strategies. The Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used to test the hypothesis and p-value of 0. 00 was obtained, indicating that environmental characteristics (rainfall patterns, droughts, temperatures, diseases and floods) significantly influenced choice of sustainability strategies adopted by <b>group</b> <b>ranches</b> in the County. Overall, rainfall patterns were the predominating environmental characteristic with a regression coefficient of 0. 317 while diseases had the least influence on choice of sustainability strategies adopted by <b>group</b> <b>ranches</b> in Samburu County, with a regression coefficient of 0. 029. The study recommended integration of environmental characteristics in formulating policies for sustainability of <b>group</b> <b>ranches...</b>|$|R

30|$|Both direct {{observation}} and remotely sensed land cover analyses showed extensive large-scale commercial cereal cultivation {{in the outer}} ring of former <b>group</b> <b>ranches</b> around the Maasai Mara National Reserve (MMNR). However, both the proportion of households involved in commercial cultivation and its total acreage dropped significantly between 1998 and 2004 with the completion of land titling across most of the area studied and more recently {{with the rise of}} conservancy agreements across the former <b>group</b> <b>ranches</b> immediately adjacent to MMNR (Bedelian in press). Alongside poor rainfall and declining soil fertility, the transaction costs of dealing with multiple smallholders (as opposed to dealing with the <b>group</b> <b>ranch</b> committee for large areas) made large-scale farming in Kenya Maasailand difficult.|$|R
30|$|Data {{collection}} {{was focused on}} three communities in the county’s central area for intensive household interviews and participant observation, including one private ranch and two adjacent community <b>group</b> <b>ranches.</b> Participants included pastoralists employed as herders for cattle, sheep, goats, or camels at the private ranch and pastoralists who kept mixed herds of cattle, goats, sheep, and camels in the community <b>group</b> <b>ranches.</b> More details are provided in the following section.|$|R
30|$|The {{sampling}} was stratified {{based on}} major land-use types {{as described by}} Campbell et al. 2003) and proximity to Amboseli National park. Multistage sampling method was used to select the respondents. In the first stage, preliminary surveys and interviews {{in the study area}} were used in selecting the study sites, which formed the clusters. The clusters included three land-use sites namely, nomadic (Eselenkei <b>group</b> <b>ranch),</b> semi-nomadic (Olgulului <b>group</b> <b>ranch),</b> and sedentary (Kimana <b>group</b> <b>ranch).</b> Nine villages were randomly selected, three from each land-use site in the second stage. One hundred and twenty respondents from nomadic, 131 from semi-nomadic, and 83 from the sedentary land-use site were randomly selected for individual interviews in the third stage, making a total of 334 respondents.|$|R
30|$|This system contrasted greatly with {{management}} in nearby <b>group</b> <b>ranches,</b> where bomas and grazing practices resembled pastoral spaces elsewhere in Kenya. In the two <b>group</b> <b>ranches</b> considered in this study, for example, bomas were organized into traditional family units with smaller groups of cattle, sheep, goats, and/or camels {{than in the}} private ranches. Grazing spaces were generally communal. In many cases, communities attempted to set up core conservation areas intended to support wildlife, optimize community-based tourism opportunities, and function as reserves for grazing during droughts. Often encouraged by community stakeholders to do so, <b>group</b> <b>ranch</b> members were incentivized to join the collective conservation project by gaining logistical and sometimes financial support for demarcating conservancy land. While some community members supported these projects, others lamented limited returns for conservation spaces.|$|R
30|$|Indeed, gender {{inequality}} is pronounced in Laikipia (Bond 2014 b), and ongoing labour transitions may be exacerbating such tensions. Pastoral women had fewer options for employment in private ranches. Similar {{to the ways}} in which county stakeholders encouraged <b>group</b> <b>ranches</b> to establish conservation areas, female <b>group</b> <b>ranch</b> members were encouraged to establish and participate in women-led ecotourism ventures in the <b>group</b> <b>ranches</b> like lodges or co-operatives for curio sales. While these opportunities seemed promising, at the time of this research, many projects intended to be managed by and for women were not operational. By not offering women opportunities for livestock-based work, the collective conservation project in Laikipia shaped women’s experiences in very particular ways. On the one hand, it compelled women to diversify their livelihoods beyond livestock outside of the home while on the other hand created more livestock-based work for them at home. Both men and women were taking on new labour demands to manage livestock in private or <b>group</b> <b>ranches.</b> While changes in household division of labour due to new forms of livelihood diversification are not unique to pastoralists in Laikipia (McCabe et al. 2014), these transitions warrant further inquiry.|$|R

30|$|This paper {{concentrates}} on the conservancies and households located in the former Koyiaki <b>Group</b> <b>Ranch.</b> Koyiaki lies on the northern border of the MMNR and supports an overspill of numerous wildlife from the MMNR in the wet season (Broten and Said 1995; Ogutu et al. 2008 b; Bhola et al. 2012). Koyiaki is now fully privatised, and land was subdivided and allocated to <b>group</b> <b>ranch</b> members {{in a number of}} stages over a period of 25  years, beginning in 1984 (Thompson et al. 2009) and ending in 2009 when the final land blocks were subdivided. Koyiaki {{was one of the first}} <b>group</b> <b>ranches</b> to experiment with tourism revenue dispersal initiatives in the 1990 s (Thompson and Homewood 2002) and also saw the emergence and rapid replication of conservancies from 20061 (Bedelian 2014).

This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract This study assesses the nutritional status of Maasai pastoralists {{living in a}} period of great social, economic and ecological changes in Kajiado County, southern Kenya. Data on weight, height, skinfolds, and circumferences were collect-ed from 534 individuals in the year 2000. The data were used to describe mean differences in human nutrition between ages, sexes, and within and among three <b>Group</b> <b>Ranches.</b> Nutritional data and diet recall data were compared with past studies of Maasai nutrition from 1930 to 2000. Results indi-cate that nutritional status is poor and has remained so despite numerous changes to the social-ecological system including livelihood diversification, sedentarization, human population growth and decreased access to vegetation heterogeneity.

30|$|Grazing {{strategies}} {{were not the}} only aspects of livestock management shifting in Laikipia due to professional herding jobs. Traditionally, boys and young unmarried men have provided herding labour for most pastoral communities in Kenya. In the private ranch involved in this study, however, the average age of hired herders was much higher at 38  years. Hired herders in most cases had families residing in the <b>group</b> <b>ranches.</b> With little leave time and low pay, many respondents found it difficult to return home often. These familial dynamics were important to both men in private ranches and women in <b>group</b> <b>ranches</b> for several reasons. First, on private ranches, men were responsible not only for herding but also for milking, labour traditionally reserved for women. Women in <b>group</b> <b>ranches,</b> on the other hand, were consequently responsible not only for milking but in many cases for herding labour. In households with young children or households where herding labour could not be otherwise accessed, women experienced a substantial increase in labour demands when their husbands, fathers, or brothers were away working at private ranches. In effect, many households in the <b>group</b> <b>ranches</b> functioned as female-headed households for much or all of the year. This finding resonates with the work of Karmebäck et al. (2015) and others who note that pastoral women elsewhere in Kenya are increasingly taking on more work, including grazing activities, with mixed outcomes.|$|R

30|$|Subdivision of {{communal}} pastoral lands started with <b>group</b> <b>ranch</b> demarcations in 1968, which restricted herd {{movements in the}} pastoral areas. The <b>group</b> <b>ranches</b> were established under the Land (Group representative) Act Cap. 287 {{of the laws of}} Kenya with the aim of reducing overgrazing in range ecosystems, improving livestock production, and increasing community awareness on environmental conservation (Nyariki et al. 2009). The intended objectives were not met as problems of land degradation escalated, thereby further undermining pastoral livestock production. This later led to further government interventions to privatize communal lands intended to better livestock production and meet desired conservation goals.|$|R
40|$|Examines the {{structure}} of the herds & flocks of a sample of 41 households on the three Maasai <b>group</b> <b>ranches</b> in Kenya, relating differences in herd structure to livestock wealth of the household, to the stage of development of the <b>group</b> <b>ranch,</b> & to the variation in climate and production alternatives.

30|$|On a first look, <b>group</b> <b>ranches</b> {{and private}} ranches {{resemble}} one another, with similar landscapes, similar livestock utilizing similar resources, and similar wildlife species {{moving through the}} landscape. For the region’s pastoralists, however, the differences in resource governance are stark. On {{more than one occasion}} during fieldwork, employees were witnessed crossing boundaries from their homes in the <b>group</b> <b>ranches</b> to return to work on the private ranches. Many were returning from checking on their homes, their families, and their own livestock, and many had engaged in herding activities during their visit home. Immediately upon return to private ranches, employees would don lanyards with plastic name tags: last name, first name, and in all capital letters: ‘HERDSMAN’. For others, it was ‘BOMA SUPERVISOR’. The shift was not only symbolic but also a material one, where transitioning from being a herder in a <b>group</b> <b>ranch</b> to a herdsman or supervisor in a private ranch meant a different set of herding practices, a different set of pressures and responsibilities, and an altogether different livelihood.|$|R
30|$|Land tenure. Individuals with title deeds {{are more}} likely to adopt crop-based regimes while those still {{operating}} under the <b>group</b> <b>ranch</b> scheme have a livestock-based management system. Formalization of land tenure is hypothesized to encourage diversification in management regimes.|$|R
30|$|The {{transition}} from herder to herdsman {{was often a}} fluid one. On several occasions, ranching managers instructed employees to graze livestock {{around the perimeter of}} their properties, particularly along borders with <b>group</b> <b>ranches,</b> in order to dis-incentivize <b>group</b> <b>ranch</b> members from illegally grazing livestock on private land. Hired herdsmen were asked to take part in preventing such ‘stealing’ while employed at the private ranches. The importance of healthy rangeland ecosystems and sustainable corridors were prioritized for wildlife purposes in many of the private ranches, and managers often patrolled these areas with employees to prevent unsanctioned grazing. During times of drought, community members lamented lack of forage in the <b>group</b> <b>ranches</b> while private ranches hosted seemingly endless healthy grasslands. While some private ranches opened small areas of their properties to pastoralists (Kibet et al. 2016), others did not, and many of those that did requested a sizable fee. The irony {{is that many of the}} employed herders working to protect the private ranch borders were then prevented from herding their own livestock in the same spaces or coerced to prevent their families from doing so during times of low forage availability.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} puzzle of why the {{pastoral}} Maasai of Kajiado, Kenya, supported the individualization of their collectively held <b>group</b> <b>ranches,</b> an outcome that is inconsistent with theoretical expectation. Findings suggest that individuals and groups will seek to alter property rights in their anticipation of net gains from a new assignment, even as they seek to eliminate disadvantages that {{were present in the}} status quo property rights structure. Heightened perceptions of impending land scarcity, failures of collective decision making, the promise of new income opportunities and the possibility of accessing capital markets motivated individuals to support <b>group</b> <b>ranch</b> subdivision. More importantly individuals were confronted with a declining security of tenure over their lands. Their supporting a transition to individual rights also represents a rational response anticipated to secure land claims against unauthorized appropriations by both Maasai and non-Maasai elite. Given the differentiated structure of <b>group</b> <b>ranch</b> communities, {{the costs and benefits of}} property transformation were unevenly distributed. The political process yielded beneficial outcomes for those with access to decision making, while creating vulnerabilities for those with less access such as women, the youth and poor herders.

30|$|A {{key issue}} {{for the future of}} Tanzanian savannah {{ecosystems}} will be the ability of local pastoralist communities to continue managing rangelands at the communal scale, rather than fragmenting rangelands into individually owned properties. Converting rangeland from communal pastures to individual properties will likely prevent the movements across large areas of land that both livestock and wildlife in semi-arid landscapes depend upon. Tanzania needs look no further for a possible future scenario than Kenyan Maasailand to the north, where the former <b>Group</b> <b>Ranches</b> have been extensively subdivided into individual land holdings which are of insufficient size to support pastoralist production (Kimani and Pickard 1998; Western et al. 2009 b). These processes of subdivision have been driven by weaknesses in the governance and design of the <b>Group</b> <b>Ranches</b> as collective entities, resulting in progressive loss of communal land through decisions made by local elites on the <b>Group</b> <b>Ranch</b> governing bodies (Mwangi 2007). This process of rangeland fragmentation, driven by past policy design choices by the Kenyan state, has dire implications for wildlife in key areas such as the Maasai Mara and Amboseli - also the country's most valuable wildlife tourism sites - and there is evidence of declining wildlife populations due to these land use changes (Homewood et al. 2001).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the internal processes and decisions {{that characterized the}} transition from collectively held <b>group</b> <b>ranches</b> to individualized property systems among the Maasai pastoralists of Kajiado district in Kenya. It addresses {{the question of why}} <b>group</b> <b>ranch</b> members would demand individualized property systems, but then turn against the outcome. In addressing this puzzle the paper {{discusses the}} process of land allocation and distribution during <b>group</b> <b>ranch</b> subdivision. It examines who the main actors were during subdivision, their degree of latitude in crafting and changing rules, and the interactions between Maasai and state institutions. Findings suggest that, because the process by which property rights change is so intertwined with politics, we may need to move beyond economic models of relative price changes and state enforcement in order to better understand such transitions. Models that accommodate competition by actors and the possibility that state actors may not provide the arbitration or enforcement that is often taken for granted are more useful for analyzing the complexities of shifting property rights. When the possibility for conflict and competition is factored into the property rights equation, the relative gains from privatizing/individualizing may not be as large or as obvious as anticipated.

30|$|The {{history of}} ethnic groups and the make-up {{of past and present}} <b>group</b> <b>ranches</b> in Laikipia are complex. For the Maasai who {{constitute}} many of the region’s <b>group</b> <b>ranches,</b> it is generally recognized that the region’s Laikipiak Maasai, Mukogodo hunter-gatherers, and other neighbours developed into present-day pastoralists who now label themselves Maasai (Galaty 1993; Cronk 2004). The region also includes Turkana, Samburu, and other pastoralist groups. Landowners and managers of other properties, including commercial ranches and private conservancies, are of African, non-African, or mixed descent. Many commercial ranches, for example, are managed by Africans of British descent. As of 2007, over half of the Laikipia region was still owned by non-Africans (Wambuguh 2007), demonstrating that the presence of the so-called White Highlands (Morgan 1963; Carey Jones 1965) prevails today.|$|R

30|$|Given these complexities, some {{caution is}} {{warranted}} for Laikipia {{and for other}} regions looking to duplicate integrative efforts, especially as conservation increasingly expands beyond protected area boundaries. More research is needed on how pastoralists individually and collectively interact with and negotiate hybrid forms of conservation efforts, especially in rangelands where wildlife, livestock, and humans frequently overlap and share resources. In addition to community <b>group</b> <b>ranches,</b> household and intra-household relations are key to understanding the complexity of conservation outcomes across multiple levels. While scholars and practitioners have long contended that pastoralism can be compatible with wildlife, landowners and land users of both private and community <b>group</b> <b>ranches</b> need to be meaningfully incorporated into planning and management for the efforts to be sustainable.
