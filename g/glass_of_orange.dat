5|$|Shulgin began {{studying}} organic chemistry as a Harvard University scholarship {{student at the}} age of 16. In 1943 he dropped out of school to join the U.S. Navy. While serving on USS Pope in the Navy during World War II, Shulgin was given a <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>orange</b> juice by a nurse prior to surgery for a thumb infection. Shulgin drank the juice and, assuming that the powder {{at the bottom of the}} glass was a sedative, fell asleep rapidly. Upon waking he learned that the powder was undissolved sugar.

5|$|Juliet {{arrives at}} an airport with her sister, where Richard Alpert and Ethan Rom are there to escort her {{the rest of the}} way. Juliet says good-bye to her sister, Rachel, {{promising}} to be back before her baby is born. In the airport terminal, Alpert pours sedative into a <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>orange</b> juice and gives it to Juliet to drink, explaining that the trip is very intense. Juliet is wary of drinking the juice, even though she is okay with the other circumstances surrounding the trip. Alpert interrupts and tells her the place she is going is very special and that she has a gift with which she is supposed to do something significant. Juliet drinks the orange juice and passes out. She wakes up in a submarine with her arms and waist strapped down for safety.|$|E
25|$|Wolfe {{maintains}} a rigid schedule in the brownstone. He has breakfast {{in his bedroom}} while wearing yellow silk pajamas; he hates to discuss work during breakfast, and if forced to do so insists upon not uttering a word until he has finished his <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>orange</b> juice (Murder by the Book). Afterwards, he is with Horstmann in the plant rooms from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. Lunch is usually at 1:15p.m. He returns to the plant rooms from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. Dinner is generally at 7:15 or 7:30p.m. (although in one book, Wolfe tells a guest that lunch is served at 1 o'clock and dinner at 8). The remaining hours, 11 a.m. to 1 p.m., 2 p.m. to 4 p.m., and after dinner, are available for business, or for reading {{if there is no}} pressing business (even if, by Archie's lights, there is). Sunday's schedule is more relaxed; Theodore, the orchid-keeper, usually goes out.|$|E

The video starts with Oh Land walking down a sidewalk at night. She then enters a small, darkened studio where she is shown dancing and singing. The following scenes display the singer appearing stressed and she eventually places a mask on top of head and grabs a baseball bat. She then proceeds to throw a potted plant and vase of flowers against a brick wall, knock over a <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>orange</b> juice, and smash a desktop computer. The news team behind Nothing but Hope and Passion described the visual as [...] "atmospheric". A live performance of [...] "Head Up High" [...] was also uploaded to the singer's Vevo account on September 25, 2015.|$|E

40|$|Contemporary {{psychological}} {{research that}} studies how people apply mathe-matics has largely viewed mathematics as a computational tool for deriving an answer. The tacit assumption {{has been that}} people first understand a situa-tion, and then choose which computations to apply. We examine an altema-tive assumption that mathematics can also serve OS a tool that helps one to construct an understanding of a situation in the first place. Three studies were conducted with 6 th-grade children {{in the context of}} proportional situations because early proportional reasoning is a premier example of where mathe-matics may provide new understanding of the world. The children predicted whether two differently-sized <b>glasses</b> <b>of</b> <b>orange</b> juice would taste the same when they were filled from a single carton of juice made from concentrate and water. To examine the relative contributions and interactions of situational and mathematical knowledge, we manipulated the formal features of the problem display (e. g., diagram vs. photograph) and the numerical complexity (e. g., divisibility) of the containers and the ingredient ratios.
