5|$|During the 1870s the {{distinction}} grew between 'first-class ironclads' or 'battleships' {{on the one}} hand, and 'cruising ironclads' designed for long-range work on the other.

The advantages found area higher anodes duration as well as the possibility of identifing and substituting in less time the eventually damaged anode.
