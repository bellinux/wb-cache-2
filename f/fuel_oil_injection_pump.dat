The Al 2 O 3 nanoparticles are mixed in various proportions (100 to 300 ppm) with methyl ester of neem oil. The performance and emissions are tested in a single cylinder computerized, 4 -stroke, stationary, water-cooled Diesel engine of 3. 5 kW rated power.

5000|$|Other {{technologies}} such as flameless oxidation (FLOX) and staged combustion significantly reduce thermal [...] in industrial processes. Bowin low [...] technology is a hybrid of staged-premixed-radiant combustion technology with a major surface combustion preceded by a minor radiant combustion. In the Bowin burner, air and fuel gas are premixed at a ratio {{greater than or equal}} to the stoichiometric combustion requirement. Water Injection technology, whereby water is introduced into the combustion chamber, is also becoming an important means of [...] reduction through increased efficiency in the overall combustion process. Alternatively, the water (e.g. 10 to 50%) is emulsified into the <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> before the <b>injection</b> and combustion. This emulsification can either be made in-line (unstabilized) just before the injection or as a drop-in fuel with chemical additives for long term emulsion stability (stabilized). Inline emulsified fuel/water mixtures show [...] reductions between 4 and 83%.|$|R
40|$|Conventional {{compression}} ignition engines can easily be converted to a dual fuel mode of operation using natural gas as main <b>fuel</b> and diesel <b>oil</b> <b>injection</b> as pilot to initiate the combustion. At the same time, {{it is possible to}} increase the output power by increasing the diesel oil percentage. A detailed performance and combustion characteristic analysis of a heavy duty diesel engine has been studied in dual fuel mode of operation where natural gas is used as the main <b>fuel</b> and diesel <b>oil</b> as pilot. The influence of intake pressure and temperature on knock occurrence and the effects of initial swirl ratio on heat release rate, temperature-pressure and emission levels have been investigated in this study. It is shown that an increase in the initial swirl ratio lengthens the delay period for auto-ignition and extends the combustion period while it reduces NOx. There is an optimum value of the initial swirl ratio for a certain mixture intake temperature and pressure conditions that can achieve high thermal efficiency and low NOx emissions while decreases the tendency to knock. Simultaneous increase of intake pressure and initial swirl ratio could be the solution to power loss and knock in dual fuel engine...|$|R

50|$|The {{fuel system}} is a very simple design. A {{mechanical}} or electric fuel lift pump feeds a Stanadyne Rotary Distributor <b>Injection</b> <b>pump</b> at low pressure. The distributor <b>injection</b> <b>pump</b> controls both metering, via an internal centrifugal governor, and high pressure fuel delivery to the fuel injectors via internal precision hydraulic pumps. Near {{the top of the}} compression stroke fuel is atomized at high pressure into a hemispherical Inconel prechamber in the cylinder heads using Bosch pintle and seat mechanical fuel injectors. This is called Indirect injection. GM used fully mechanical DB2 series <b>injection</b> <b>pumps</b> on all military HMMWVs and 1982-1993 6.2's and 6.5's. From 1994 till end of production GM used the electronically controlled Stanadyne DS4 series of <b>injection</b> <b>pumps</b> in their light trucks.

40|$|Groundwater is an {{important}} source of fresh water and, consequently, its quality should be properly monitored. Different contaminants can be identified with different types of equipment and/or measurement procedures. <b>Fuel</b> <b>oil</b> contamination forms a "floating" layer over the water table, which has different electrical properties, therefore electromagnetic techniques can be used to image such contaminants. This paper presents a scale-laboratory test where a 2. 0 GHz ground penetrating radar (GPR) is used to assess a controlled-fuel <b>oil</b> <b>injection</b> in a shallow sand tank setup. The test examined several scenarios involving different levels of water saturation and <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> contamination. The increase of water content produces a reduction of EM wave propagation velocity, moving some fixed/reference targets to higher reflection times. We use simplified relations to obtain approximated dielectric permittivity values, where the inverted results are consistent with those available in the literature for similar scenarios. Rather than suggesting a true quantitative procedure, these observations could be exploited in a qualitative long-term monitoring strategy in common field situations where a contaminant enters a soil matrix and moves through its pore spaces. Finally, the integration of GPR measurements with other monitoring techniques could increase the reliability of the interpretation and the sensitivity to the contaminant concentration...|$|R
