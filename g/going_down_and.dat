The 1.1 million units had left Seattle on January 31, and were not due by dog sled until February 8. Welch asked for half the serum to be delivered by aircraft from Fairbanks. He contacted Thompson and Sutherland, and Darling made a test flight the next morning. With his health advisor, Governor Bone concluded the cases in Nome were actually <b>going</b> <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> withheld permission, but preparations went ahead. The U.S. Navy moved a minesweeper north from Seattle, and the Signal Corps were ordered to light fires to guide the planes.|$|E

He further stated that “It is deeply disastrous to witness that some presidential nominees have to visit these people , take part in their gatherings and swear their allegiance and commitment to their interests in order to win financial or media support. These nations are spending their dignity and resources on the crimes and threats of the Zionist network against their will.”Ahmadinejad stated the “Zionist regime” was on the path to collapse and that the [...] "underhanded actions of the Zionists" [...] as among the causes of the recent unrest in the former Soviet republic of Georgia.

5|$|The trends <b>going</b> <b>down</b> from {{scandium}} <b>and</b> yttrium to lanthanum {{tend to be}} {{more similar}} to those <b>going</b> <b>down</b> groups 1 <b>and</b> 2 in the periodic table, while those <b>going</b> <b>down</b> from scandium <b>and</b> yttrium to lutetium {{tend to be more}} similar to those in the early transition metals. Since Sc3+, Y3+, and La3+ still have a low enough charge for their compounds to be predominantly ionic, unlike Ti4+, Zr4+, and Hf4+, {{it has been argued that}} lanthanum and the rest of group 3 should be considered at best atypical transition metals, as their chemistry is focused on the predominantly ionic +3 state and they have a low ability to form coordination compounds or organometallic compounds. Indeed, lanthanum is a strongly electropositive metal, comparable to calcium in electropositivity. The rare earth metals in general are more similar in reactivity to the alkaline earth metals that immediately precede them than to the transition metals proper which follow them.|$|R
