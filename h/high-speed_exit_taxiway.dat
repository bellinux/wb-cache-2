Runway 09R/27L is 9843 ft long and 148 ft wide, while runway 09L/27R is 12140 ft long and 60 m wide, after being widened in 2015 to better receive the Airbus A380. The field elevation {{at the airport}} is 2459 ft above mean sea level. Runway 09R/27L is used preferentially for landings and runway 09L/27R preferentially for takeoffs, but the Airbus A380 uses the longer and wider latter runway for both landing and taking off. There are <b>high-speed</b> <b>exit</b> <b>taxiways</b> on both runways that allow for traffic to depart the runway at higher speed to allow better efficiency for landing and takeoff traffic.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 33 rd Annual Southern African Transport Conference 7 - 10 July 2014 "Leading Transport into the Future", CSIR International Convention Centre, Pretoria, South Africa. In the past airfields were designed and built by architectural and engineering companies without due regard and consideration to flight operational requirements. This deficiency was recognized by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the International Federation of Air Line Pilots (IFALPA). Both leading aviation controlling bodies advocated the incorporation of flight operational considerations in the overall airfield layout and pavement design. Pertinent issues {{to be addressed in}} the paper include: approach light system design and consideration, aircraft maneuvering area design and construction, taxiway and runway markings, runway skid resistance, runway length and width consideration, runway end safety area (RESA) and safety strip considerations, rapid <b>exit</b> <b>taxiway</b> designs, apron lighting, taxiway design consideration and control over foreign object debris (FOD). Some case studies (e. g. King Shaka International Airport, OR Tambo International Airport, Lanseria International, Arusha and Mwanza Regional Airports, East London, Nairobi and Kilimanjaro International Airports) will be used to illustrate that by proper consideration to the flight operations factor, these airports could have been planned and designed/upgraded/maintained in a much more efficient and safe manner, that could have ensured an increased availability factor. Major high risk pavement failures have been recorded (asphalt surfacing being blown out and loose stones) by not considering aircraft related factors (jet blast, oil spillages).

The idea starts of being the third Hub airport of Skyteam airlines alliance in Europe, with Paris, Charles de Gaulle and Amsterdam, Schiphol. Airports of these characteristics require a reference airline company that used the airport as a base of operations to perform this own function of Hub. This airline is Air Europe, which was supposed that take all base of operations at the airport of Peralada, becoming the main airport and leaving in second plan the airport of Madrid, Barajas. To create a Hub airport with reliable data has based in the flight plan for day type in 2025 elaborated for Iberia and Aena in the Barcelona Airport. The content treated in the location report are social and economic analysis of Peralada, the town and air compatibility location, the affectation to naturals areas with the acoustic pollution, with hydrology and the alteration of the biological habitat, {{a study of the}} geological composition and geomorphological of the ground, an evaluation of the road network and of the services offered in the region, aside of a detailed climatological study.

40|$|Air {{traffic growth}} in the U. S. has led to runway {{capacity}} constraints in the air transportation network. There has been limited new construction of runways due to land availability. One approach to increase capacity of existing runways is to reduce inter-arrival separations during the final approach phase of flight. This study evaluates two major elements influencing runway capacity; runway occupancy and wake vortex separation, and under what conditions each becomes a constraint to runway capacity. A detailed analysis of runway occupancy time measurements and wake vortex separation measurements is performed for Boston, Philadelphia, New York La Guardia, and Newark airports based on Airport Surface Detection Equipment Model-X (ASDE-X) aircraft surveillance data. The {{findings of this study}} indicate that runway occupancy does not necessary scale with aircraft size. Small aircraft often occupy the runway as long as large aircraft, which limits the potential for reduced separations behind small aircraft. The results also indicate that <b>high-speed</b> runway <b>exits</b> can make a significant difference in runway occupancy. Runways equipped with <b>high-speed</b> <b>exits</b> have lower runway occupancy times than runways equipped with standard 90 -degree exits. Comparison of runway occupancy times in Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) and Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) suggest no significant difference between the two weather conditions. Wake vortex separation measurements show that aircraft pairs with small lead aircraft receive longer separation buffers than other aircraft pairs, and airports with more runways implement longer separation buffers. The comparison of landing time intervals and runway occupancy illustrates that wake vortex separation requirements limit runway capacity when heavy or Boeing 757 is the lead aircraft. Lastly, this study evaluates the runway capacity benefits of reduced wake separation requirements for the aircraft re-categorization (RECAT) program. The results estimate an 8. 2 - 8. 3 % increase in runway capacity at Philadelphia and at Newark, a 7. 8 % increase at Boston, and a 5. 1 % increase at La Guardia. The magnitude of benefits strongly depends on how the local traffic mix looks like. by Tamas Kolos-Lakatos. Thesis: S.

40|$|Landing {{excursion}} accidents {{have become}} a major concern over recent decades regarding airline and airport safety. Available runway friction has {{a significant impact on}} aircraft landing performance. This is especially noted when aircraft are landing on wet or otherwise contaminated runways due to the reduced braking action, which has been well documented since the dawn of the jet aircraft age. The objective of this thesis is to develop a tool to help make recommendations for airports that are subjected to diverse weather conditions. In order to model an aircraft’s real landing performance, a mechanistic-empirical aircraft deceleration equation was developed. This equation contains all of the major forces that contribute to aircraft braking, and is calibrated and validated using digital flight data from dry runway aircraft landings. Digital flight data from a Boeing 737 - 700, runway pavement condition monitoring data, and weather data was collected. Finally, a Boeing 737 - 700 case study was conducted. As a result, it is able to back calculate the braking friction coefficient from the developed equation and evaluate the impact of wet and contaminated runways on aircraft braking performance. A study of a Boeing 737 - 700 aircraft landing performance on runways under different conditions was conducted. A mechanistic-empirical landing distance model is established based on the mechanistic-empirical deceleration equation, in order to accurately calculate the required landing distance. When developing the landing distance model, the following characteristics are considered: pilot settings (TLA, spoiler position, and flap position configurations), aircraft operational characteristics (touchdown speed and weight), the runway friction condition, and aircraft braking system characteristics. A Boeing 737 - 700 real data case study was conducted and a comparison was made with the Boeing 737 Quick Reference Handbook reference landing distance. The results indicate the model offers an accurate prediction of aircraft landing distance. Finally, future applications of this thesis are introduced. The potential of the development of a runway assessment, evaluation, and reporting framework was proposed. Opportunities of applying this thesis in on-board landing distance calculation, quick <b>exit</b> <b>taxiway</b> design and airport operation optimization, and fuel consumption reduction were presented.
