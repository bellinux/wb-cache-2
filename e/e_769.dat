40|$|International audienceRecent {{reports on}} {{the decline of the}} {{efficacy}} of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) indicate a serious threat to malaria control. The endoplasmic/sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2 +) -ATPase ortholog of Plasmodium falciparum (PfSERCA) has been suggested to be the target of artemisinin and its derivatives. It is assumed that continuous artemisinin pressure will affect polymorphism of the PfSERCA gene (serca) if the protein is the target. Here, we investigated the polymorphism of serca in parasite populations unexposed to ACTs to obtain baseline information for the study of potential artemisinin-driven selection of resistant parasites. Analysis of 656 full-length sequences from 13 parasite populations in Africa, Asia, Oceania, and South America revealed 64 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), of which 43 were newly identified and 38 resulted in amino acid substitutions. No isolates showed L 263 <b>E</b> and S <b>769</b> N substitutions, which were reportedly associated with artemisinin resistance. Among the four continents, the number of SNPs was highest in Africa. In Africa, Asia, and Oceania, common SNPs, or those with a minor allele frequency of ≥ 0. 05, were less prevalent, with most SNPs noted to be continent specific, whereas in South America, common SNPs were highly prevalent and often shared with those in Africa.

Methods Plasmodium falciparum isolates cultured from 28 returning travellers diagnosed with malaria were assessed for sensitivity to artemisinin, artemether, dihydroartemisinin and artesunate and findings related to mutations in pfatp 6 and pfmdr 1. Results Resistance to artemether in vitro was significantly associated with a pfatp 6 haplotype encoding two amino acid substitutions (pfatp 6 A 623 <b>E</b> and S <b>769</b> N; (mean IC 50 (95 % CI) values of 8. 2 (5. 7 – 10. 7) for A 623 /S 769 versus 623 E/ 769 [*]N 13. 5 (9. 8 – 17. 3) nM with a mean increase of 65 %; p[*]=[*] 0. 012). Increased copy number of pfmdr 1 was not itself associated with increased IC 50 values for artemether, but when interactions between the pfatp 6 haplotype and increased copy number of pfmdr 1 were examined together, a highly significant association was noted with IC 50 values for artemether (mean IC 50 (95 % CI) values of 8. 7 (5. 9 – 11. 6) versus 16. 3 (10. 7 – 21. 8) nM with a mean increase of 87 %; p[*]=[*] 0. 0068). Previously described SNPs in pfmdr 1 are also associated with differences in sensitivity to some artemisinins. Conclusions These findings were further explored in molecular modelling experiments that suggest mutations in pfatp 6 are unlikely to affect differential binding of artemisinins at their proposed site, whereas there may be differences in such binding associated with mutations in pfmdr 1. Implications for a hypothesis that artemisinin resistance may be exacerbated by interactions between PfATP 6 and PfMDR 1 and for epidemiological studies to monitor emerging resistance are discussed. </p...|$|R

Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab 298 : <b>E</b> 761 -E <b>769,</b> 2010. First published January 5, 2010; doi: 10. 1152 /ajpendo. 00421. 2009. -Like insulin, leucine stimulates the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) /p 70 ribosomal S 6 kinase (p 70 (S 6 K)) axis in various organs. Insulin proceeds via the canonical association of phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 K), phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase- 1 (PDK 1), and protein kinase B (PKB/Akt). The signaling involved in leucine effect, although known to implicate a PI 3 K mechanism independent of PKB/Akt, is more poorly understood. In this study, we investigated whether PDK 1 could also {{participate in the}} events leading to mTOR/p 70 (S 6 K) activation in response to leucine in the heart. In wild-type hearts, both leucine and insulin increased p 70 (S 6 K) activity whereas, in contrast to insulin, leucine was unable to activate PKB/Akt. The changes in p 70 (S 6 K) activity induced by insulin and leucine correlated with changes in phosphorylation of Thr(389), the mTOR phosphorylation site on p 70 (S 6 K), and of Ser(2448) on mTOR, both related to mTOR activity. Leucine also triggered phosphorylation of the proline-rich Akt/PKB substrate of 40 kDa (PRAS 40), a new pivotal mTOR regulator. In PDK 1 knockout hearts, leucine, similarly to insulin, failed to induce the phosphorylation of mTOR and p 70 (S 6 K), leading {{to the absence of}} p 70 (S 6 K) activation. The loss of leucine effect in absence of PDK 1 correlated with the lack of PRAS 40 phosphorylation. Moreover, the introduction in PDK 1 of the L 155 E mutation, which is known to preserve the insulin-induced and PKB/Akt-dependent phosphorylation of mTOR/p 70 (S 6 K), suppressed all leucine effects, including phosphorylation of mTOR, PRAS 40, and p 70 (S 6 K). We conclude that the leucine-induced stimulation of the cardiac PRAS 40 /mTOR/p 70 (S 6 K) pathway requires PDK 1 in a way that differs from that of insulin...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background In 2005, Ghana {{replaced}} chloroquine with artemisinin-based {{combination therapy}} as the first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria. The {{aim of this}} work was to determine for the first time, polymorphisms in the putative pfATPase 6 and pftctp, pfmdr 1, pfcrt genes in Ghanaian isolates, particularly {{at a time when}} there is no report on artemisinin resistance in malaria parasites from Ghana. The sensitivity of parasite isolates to anti-malaria drugs were also evaluated for a possible association with polymorphisms in these genes. Methods The prevalence of point mutations in the above Plasmodium falciparum genes were assessed from filter-paper blood blot samples by DNA sequencing. In vitro drug sensitivity test was carried out on some of the blood samples from volunteers visiting hospitals/clinics in southern Ghana using a modified version of the standard WHO Mark III micro-test. Results All successfully tested parasite isolates were sensitive to artesunate; while 19. 4 %, 29. 0 % and 51. 6 % were resistant to quinine, amodiaquine and chloroquine respectively. The geometric mean of IC 50 value for artesunate was 0. 73 nM (95 % CI, 0. 38 - 1. 08), amodiaquine 30. 69 nM (95 % CI, 14. 18 - 47. 20) and chloroquine 58. 73 nM (95 % CI, 38. 08 - 79. 38). Twenty point mutations were observed in pfATPase 6 gene, with no L 263 <b>E</b> and S <b>769</b> N. All mutations found were low in frequency, except D 639 G which was observed in about half of the isolates but was not associated with artesunate response (p = 0. 42). The pftctp gene is highly conserved as no mutation was observed, while CVIET which is chloroquine-resistant genotype at codon 72 - 76 of the pfcrt gene was identified in about half of the isolates; this was consistent with chloroquine IC 50 values (p = 0. 001). Mutations were present in pfmdr 1 gene but were not associated with artemisinin response (p = 1. 00). Conclusion The pfATPase 6 gene is highly polymorphic with D 639 G appearing to be fixed in Ghanaian isolates. These may just be spontaneous mutations as all parasite isolates that were tested displayed satisfactory in vitro response to artesunate. However, there is no improvement in susceptibility of the parasites to chloroquine five years after its proscription. </p...|$|R
