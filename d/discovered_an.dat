5|$|Although Stoenescu was {{a disciple}} of his, Macedonski favored Caion in this dispute, and {{employed}} {{him to write}} more denunciations of Caragiale in the magazine Forța Morală. Forța Morală expanded on the initial accusations, claiming to have <b>discovered</b> <b>an</b> entire history of plagiarism in Caragiale's writings (from Victorien Sardou to Alfred Duru). Following Macedonski's intercession, Caion was also supported by the historian Grigore Tocilescu, who made Caragiale the sole topic of his Romanian Atheneum conference (January 24, 1902).|$|E

5|$|In 1801, the {{astronomer}} Giuseppe Piazzi <b>discovered</b> <b>an</b> object which he initially {{believed to be}} a comet. Shortly thereafter he announced his observations of this object, noting that the slow, uniform motion was uncharacteristic of a comet, suggesting it was a different type of object. This was lost from sight for several months, but was recovered later that year by the Baron von Zach and Heinrich W. M. Olbers after a preliminary orbit was computed by Carl Friedrich Gauss. This object came to be named Ceres, and was the first asteroid to be discovered.|$|E

While writing a draft script, Gerolmo brought it to Frederick Zollo, who had produced Gerolmo's first screenplay Miles from Home (1988). Zollo helped Gerolmo develop the original draft before they sold it to Orion Pictures. The studio then began its search for a director to helm the project. Filmmakers Miloš Forman and John Schlesinger were among those considered to helm the project.|$|E
5|$|In 837, a Muslim army under Abd al-Salam ibn Abd al-Wahhab {{attacked}} Enna, but {{was defeated}} by the Byzantines, and Abd al-Salam himself was taken prisoner. The Muslims responded by reinforcing their position around Enna, which they placed under siege. During the following winter, one of the besiegers <b>discovered</b> <b>an</b> unguarded path leading to the town, allowing the Muslims to take the entire lower town. The Byzantines however managed to maintain control of the citadel, and after negotiations secured a Muslim withdrawal {{in exchange for a}} large ransom.|$|E
5|$|Lawrence offered Segrè {{a job as}} a {{research}} assistant—a relatively lowly position for someone who had <b>discovered</b> <b>an</b> element—for US$300 a month for six months. However, when Lawrence learned that Segrè was legally trapped in California, he reduced Segrè's salary to US$116 a month. When the regents of the University of California wanted to terminate Segré's employment owing to his foreign nationality, Lawrence managed to retain Segré by hiring him as a part-time lecturer paid by the Rockefeller Foundation. Similar arrangements were made to retain his doctoral students Chien-Shiung Wu (a Chinese national) and Kenneth Ross MacKenzie (a Canadian national) when they graduated.|$|E

5|$|Novomessor was synonymized in 1974, {{although}} {{evidence to}} retain it as a valid genus emerged when scientists <b>discovered</b> <b>an</b> exocrine gastral glandular system in two Novomessor species and none in Aphaenogaster. However, N. ensifer {{does not have}} this glandular system. English myrmecologist Barry Bolton argues that basing the genus on such feature cannot justify the separation of Novomessor and Aphaenogaster. In 2015, a phylogenetic study concluded that Novomessor was genetically distinct from Aphaenogaster, and the genus was revived from synonymy to include N. ensifer, N. albisetosus and N. cockerelli as members of it.|$|E
