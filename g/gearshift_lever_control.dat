30|$|The {{position}} of all <b>control</b> <b>levers</b> {{of the driving}} simulator (windshield wipers, blinker, ignition key and light switch) is transmitted to the driving computer. All operational elements, steering wheel, accelerator pedal, brake pedal, <b>gearshift</b> <b>lever</b> and handbrake lever, provide nature-true force reactions. The gearshift functions like in the real car either as automatic or “soft tip” with incrementing and decrementing the six gears and with reverse gear.|$|R
50|$|The Model 20 was {{equipped}} with a side-valve, in-line 2,704cc four-cylinder engine developing 22 bhp. The engine was installed in the front, driving the rear wheels through a transmission shaft. The gearbox had three forward gears, with the <b>gearshift</b> <b>lever</b> positioned {{to the right of}} the driver.|$|R
30|$|The rider rides a {{motorcycle}} mock-up equipped {{with all of}} the commands available on a real bike. In particular, the rider’s actions are monitored by measuring the steering torque, leaning of the body, throttle position, front brake lever and rear brake pedal pressures, clutch position and <b>gearshift</b> <b>lever</b> position.|$|R
50|$|Model year 2016 saw {{the return}} of the SR {{performance}} model. Available with either 4 or 6 cylinder engines it comes equipped with 18 inch alloy wheels, sport decklid spoiler, unique sport interior with blue piping on the seats, SR logo floormats, and leather wrapped steering wheel and <b>gearshift</b> <b>lever.</b>|$|R
50|$|Carried {{over from}} the 207 RC, the {{interior}} received grinium finish decor with front and rear bucket seats as well as RC front and rear mat covers. The steering wheel too, with a granium finish ring and numbered from 1 to 2000. The <b>gearshift</b> <b>lever</b> knob, pedal assembly, foot rest and door sill are in aluminium.|$|R

50|$|The second {{generation}} series H200 of RegiusAce was completely restyled {{and is currently}} in production. Transmission choices are a 5-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic, with the <b>gearshift</b> <b>lever</b> integrated into the instrument panel so as to allow front seat passengers access {{to the rear of}} the vehicle from the inside. A moderate restyle was completed November 2005.|$|R
5000|$|The {{shift pattern}} for most underbone or {{miniature}} motorcycles {{with an automatic}} centrifugal clutch is also modified for two key reasons—to enable the less-experienced riders to shift the gears without problems of [...] "finding" [...] neutral, and also due to the greater force needed to [...] "lift" [...] the <b>gearshift</b> <b>lever</b> (because the <b>gearshift</b> pedal of an underbone motorcycle also operates the clutch). The <b>gearshift</b> <b>lever</b> of an underbone has two ends. The rider clicks down the front end with the left toe {{all the way to}} the top gear and clicks down the rear end with the heel all the way down to neutral, while miniatures still retain a single-end lever, with the rider clicks down to upshift and lift the lever up to downshift (or vice versa). Some underbone models such as the Honda Wave have a [...] "rotary" [...] shift pattern, which means that the rider can shift directly to neutral from the top gear, but for safety reasons this is only possible when the motorcycle is stationary. Some models also have gear position indicators for all gear positions at the instrument panel.|$|R

Its starting price is [...] and it features TRD bodykit and quad-tip exhaust system, along with TRD lowered suspension, TRD steering wheel and shift knob and the highest specification (dual [...] A/C, HID headlamps with LED daytime running lamps, push-button start-stop) plus a numbered commemorative plaque near the <b>gearshift</b> <b>lever.</b>|$|R
50|$|HSD {{technology}} {{produces a}} full hybrid vehicle {{which allows the}} car to run on the electric motor only, as opposed to most other brand hybrids which cannot and are considered mild hybrids. The HSD also combines an electric drive and a planetary gearset which performs similarly to a continuously variable transmission. The Synergy Drive is a drive-by-wire system with no direct mechanical connection between the engine and the engine controls: both the gas pedal/accelerator and the <b>gearshift</b> <b>lever</b> in an HSD car merely send electrical signals to a control computer.|$|R
50|$|The 650 {{remained}} {{popular in}} Japan, and although some were exported to Europe in the 70s, subsequent models were produced {{primarily for the}} domestic market. The penultimate model in the W series was the W1SA with stylistic changes, but most importantly with the <b>gearshift</b> <b>lever</b> {{on the left side}} and the rear brake pedal on the right side, which is the standard configuration for Japanese motorcycles. The final version was the 1973 W3 model (aka RS650) with upgraded suspension as well as twin disc brakes in front. W series production ceased in 1974.|$|R

25|$|The KR175 {{used the}} {{standard}} Kabinenroller steering system, with a steering bar connected {{directly to the}} track rods of the front wheels, providing an extremely direct response best suited to small, measured inputs. The KR175's steering bar was made from tubular steel. The <b>gearshift</b> <b>lever,</b> {{on the right side}} of the cockpit, had a secondary lever on it which operated the clutch. The throttle was operated by a twist-grip on the left handlebar. The foot brake pedal, which was the only pedal in the car, operated brakes on all three wheels mechanically, using cables. The handbrake lever operated similarly.|$|R
5000|$|The driver could down-shift {{for passing}} by fully {{depressing}} the accelerator. The clutch {{was needed to}} change between low and high range. The fluid drive system allowed the driver to stop at a light or in traffic and remain in gear without depressing the clutch. The driver could, if not concerned with fast acceleration, drive the car all day long in high range, stopping and starting, without ever having to touch the clutch pedal or <b>gearshift</b> <b>lever</b> unless faster acceleration or reversing was required. For this reason, DeSotos and Dodges were favored by city cab companies from the mid Forties to early Fifties.|$|R
50|$|Einar meets Jean at {{the diner}} and invites {{her to come back}} and live with him and Griff after a camping trip. The camping trip is cover for {{carrying}} out a request from Mitch to set the bear who handicapped him free. The plan does not go off without a hitch as Griff accidentally knocks the <b>gearshift</b> <b>lever</b> into neutral while Einar is luring the bear into the cage, freeing the bear who attacks Einar. Griff drives Einar to the hospital, where he and Jean attempt to reconcile. Back at the ranch, Mitch survives a peaceful confrontation with the bear from his past. It flees to the mountains where it belongs.|$|R
50|$|After {{crossing}} the finishing line, Park raised a No. 3 Earnhardt hat that hanged on his <b>gearshift</b> <b>lever</b> and thrust {{it out of}} the car to holding it high in tribute to Earnhardt. Park also performed a spin, drove towards Michael Waltrip and made a brief stop with the exchanging a high-five. As Park celebrated, he received a call from Earnhardt's wife Teresa Earnhardt who watched the race at the Dale Earnhardt, Inc. shop in Mooresville, North Carolina. According to Park, Teresa was emotional, but happy. The race took three hours, thirty-four minutes and twenty-one seconds to complete, and the margin of victory was 0.138 seconds.|$|R
5000|$|The Dyna Junior was {{characterized}} by simple lines and few frills. Exterior decoration {{was limited to the}} grille inherited from the Dyna X. The car had exposed hinges on the trailing edge of the two passenger doors that opened [...] "Suicide"-style. There were no external door handles, so opening the door required reaching in through the sliding plastic side windows to reach the interior latch. There was likewise no external trunk lid, with the rear storage compartment accessed by folding down the backrest of the two-place bench-seat. The interior was spartan, with a single centre-mounted dial for the speedometer and a <b>gearshift</b> <b>lever</b> sprouting from the dashboard as in the Dyna X.|$|R
5000|$|The 1939 models joined other American {{cars in the}} use of a column-mounted <b>gearshift</b> <b>lever.</b> This freed front-seat {{passenger}} space and remained the industry standard through the 1960s, when [...] "bucket seats" [...] came into vogue. Hudson became the first car manufacturer to use foam rubber in its seats. The Hudson Terraplane was dropped. For 1940 Hudson introduced coil spring independent front suspension, aircraft style shock absorbers mounted within the front springs and true center-point steering on all its models, a major advance in performance among cars in this price range. Despite all these changes, Hudson sales for 1940 were lower than 1939 and the company lost money again. The advent of military contracts the following year brought relief.|$|R
50|$|Power for the C4 was {{provided}} by the same unit used in the CS, a 1003 cc four-cylinder engine (two valves per cylinder) with a 58.0 mm bore, a 95.0 mm stroke, a magneto ignition AND Solex carburetor; it was rated at 22 KW at 2800 rpm. The vehicle transmission (which was also used in the CC and CS models, the only difference being the longer length of the <b>gearshift</b> <b>levers,</b> necessitated by the longer chassis) provided three speeds, with power being sent to the rear wheels (a differential was not used on the rear-wheel power distribution scheme until the 1925 model, however). The suspension used semi-elliptic leaf springs in both the front and rear as well as fitted friction type dampers.|$|R
5000|$|The second Actros {{generation}} {{comes with}} an electronic sequential gearbox that Mercedes-Benz has dubbed the [...] "Telligent Gearbox". It pushes forward the principle used in some earlier Mercedes-Benz tractors; using the <b>gearshift</b> <b>lever</b> to command a pneumatically actuated system that changes the gears. The Telligent gearbox utilizes a computer, together with a load-sensing system on the fifth-wheel coupling, to estimate the proper gear that the truck must be in. For example, {{if you want to}} upshift, the computer estimates the load on the tractor and the current engine mode, and gives you the proper gear for decreasing engine RPM. On the other hand, if you want to downshift, the computer assumes you wish to overtake, and gives you a proper gear for acceleration.|$|R
25|$|Apart {{from the}} {{dual-mode}} ignition, the KR200 had a steering bar reminiscent of {{that of an}} aircraft. To steer the KR200, the driver would swivel the steering bar about its axis from the horizontal (straight-ahead) position instead of rotating it as with a conventional steering wheel. The mechanism was connected directly to the track rods of the front wheels, providing an extremely direct response best suited to small amounts of movement, unlike other common steering mechanisms which involved reduction gearing. The <b>gearshift</b> <b>lever</b> had a secondary lever on it which, when actuated, would {{put the car in}} neutral regardless of what gear it had been in before, although the transmission would have to be shifted back to first before the car would be able to move from a standstill.|$|R
50|$|Apart {{from the}} {{increase}} in width and the IRS badge on {{the rear of the}} car, other changes included a revised grille and new hood badge. There was also a new line of chrome trim on the side, starting near the rear edge of the door and ending {{at the front of the}} car with integrated signal/marker lights, which were moved from their earlier position in the corners of the grille. New smaller front bumpers and a convertible top patterned after the one from the Herald completed the exterior differences. On the interior the fly-off handbrake lever was moved to the transmission tunnel between two revised seats, the <b>gearshift</b> <b>lever</b> was shortened and the white painted steel dashboard was now always covered by walnut, which had been optional in the TR4.|$|R

50|$|To {{assist the}} {{operator}} in determining their functions, each lever in a frame will generally be uniquely labelled, one common method being to number the levers in order {{from left to}} right. A lever's identification may be painted on its side or engraved on a badge or plate fitted either to the lever or behind it. This may {{be accompanied by a}} description of the lever's function. Usually, a large track diagram is positioned within easy view of the operator, which clearly shows each lever number adjacent to symbols representing the items of equipment that they operate. Levers are commonly coloured according to the type of equipment they control, the code of colours varying between different railway administrations. For example, in British practice, the following code generally applies: a red <b>lever</b> <b>controls</b> a stop signal or shunt signal, a yellow <b>lever</b> <b>controls</b> a distant signal, a black <b>lever</b> <b>controls</b> a set of points, a blue <b>lever</b> <b>controls</b> a facing point lock, and a white lever is spare. Brown levers are used to lock level crossing gates.|$|R
50|$|In most {{vehicles}} with manual transmission, gears are selected by manipulating a lever called a gear stick, shift stick, <b>gearshift,</b> gear <b>lever,</b> gear selector, or shifter {{connected to the}} transmission via linkage or cables and mounted on the floor, dashboard, or steering column. Moving the lever forward, backward, left, and right into specific positions selects particular gears.|$|R

5000|$|The {{fortunes}} of the Davis company waned later in the 1920s. Later Davises were obsolete, and sales began to slip from the peak sales of the early 1920s. In February 1928, the company was acquired by the Automotive Corporation of America, led by Villor P. Williams. [...] Williams was interested in gaining an automobile on which to install his Parkmobile device. The Parkmobile was a device which hydraulically raised the car up via a set of smaller wheels inboard of the standard ones. This allowed the vehicle to be rolled sideways into a parallel parking space. It operated [...] "through the regular <b>gearshift</b> <b>lever</b> in conjunction with an extra lever operated from the transmission." [...] The six-cylinder Davis was now renamed the New York Six, while the 8-cylinder model remained a Davis. Both of these were to get the Parkmobile device, only a few did, however. Any 1929 models were simply ones built using leftover 1928 parts.|$|R

50|$|Fitted with {{coil spring}} {{suspension}} and drum brakes, the AML lacks hydraulic assist on either brakes or steering; only front wheels steer. Consequently, {{the steering wheel}} requires considerable strength to turn while the vehicle is in motion - while stationary it remains effectively locked. Much like the Ferret, rear wheel drive is transmitted directly to epicyclic hub reduction gears, also known as bevel boxes. The motor and gearbox have been harnessed via a centrifugal clutch with electromagnetic control, {{eliminating the need for}} a clutch pedal. This type of clutch is automatically engaged by gripping the knob of the <b>gearshift</b> <b>lever,</b> which is located behind the driver's seat in the hull floor. The gearbox assembly consists of two separate gearboxes, one for high and the other for low gear. The low-range gearbox is designed for off-road use and has a reverse gear and a top gear, while the high-range box is for operation on roads and has three low gears and one overdrive. There is a hydraulic dual-circuit handbrake operating on the gearbox output shaft.|$|R
40|$|International audienceA {{gearshift}} command {{system is}} composed of a cable encapsulated in a casing. The cable transfers {{the motion of the}} <b>gearshift</b> <b>lever</b> to the gearbox selector lever. The work presented focuses on the cable-casing system and its non linear behavior. A first step of the analysis consists in calculating the cable-casing path starting from the boundary conditions given by the positions and slopes at the extremities and the passing points. A non linear co-rotational finite element formulation is used in order to model correctly the large displacements involved. The cable-casing contact problem is solved using the penalty method. Contact points between the cable and the casing are computed. The stiffness matrix computed from the spatially curved cable-casing within the contact points is then the starting point for {{the second part of the}} analysis. It concerns the dynamic behavior simulation of the cable-casing under harmonic excitations. The computation uses the Newmark time integration scheme and the dynamic time responses are calculated around static equilibrium positions previously determined. Comparisons between simulation and experiment are presented...|$|R
