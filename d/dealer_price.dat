40|$|Recent {{research}} {{point to}} the possible existence of private information in foreign exchange markets. Dealers claim that customer orders are their most important source of private information, and that banks with a large customer base have a competitive advantage. Previous studies by Lyons (1995), Yao (1998 a) and Bjønnes and Rime (2000) focus on the <b>dealer’s</b> <b>pricing</b> decision under the assumptions {{that it is only}} the initiator of a trade that may have private information and that the knowledge of the identity of the counterpart is unimportant when setting prices. In this paper we relax both assumptions. We also consider the dealer’s order placement decision. Our results suggest that customer trades influence the placement of orders. The dealers tend to take the same positions as their customers. There is also evidence that <b>dealers</b> <b>price</b> discriminate customers. Spreads to customers are wider than to other <b>dealers.</b> The <b>pricing</b> decision in the interbank market is, however, not affected by customer trades. We find no evidence that <b>dealers</b> <b>price</b> discriminate other <b>dealers</b> they think may be particularly well-informed...|$|R

5000|$|Garbage {{requested}} that their initial singles {{were to be}} packaged with a [...] "high-tech, design-led approach", {{which led to the}} manufacture of the aluminium sleeve for [...] "Vow". To follow it up, Mushroom's product manager originally wanted to create the sleeve for [...] "Subhuman" [...] from neoprene. Instead, he sourced a black plasticised rubber from a company in Germany to create the sleeve. Although it wasn't requested, the company manufactured the rubber wallets with lining and a flap to enclose the discs within. [...] "Subhuman" [...] was a bigger investment than the first single; the metal sleeve for [...] "Vow" [...] had cost 90p per unit to manufacture, [...] "Subhuman" [...] cost £2.00 per unit. Knowing that the <b>dealer</b> <b>price</b> was fixed at £1.36, Mushroom lost 64p on each. The company manufactured 3,000 copies of the sleeve in 7" [...] size, and a further 2,000 copies in CD-size (these were used as promos, and exported to Australia for their limited edition [...] "Vow" [...] CD single).|$|E
50|$|Accordingly, for the dealer, {{the cost}} of laying-off, a loss to the dealer, is the dealer’s primary {{variable}} cost and {{is built into the}} dealer’s spread. The range of the <b>dealer’s</b> <b>price,</b> therefore, according to Treynor’s conclusions, can be anywhere between 30-40% of the security’s value all without any valuation changes from the VBT to compensate for {{the cost of}} laying-off.|$|R
50|$|Another example, from New Zealand, is four stamps overprinted for an {{industrial}} exhibition held in Auckland in 1913. The accompanying image shows genuine overprints, and forged overprints from an internet auction. A New Zealand <b>dealer</b> <b>prices</b> {{a set of}} postally used stamps with genuine overprints at NZD 1600, while the same four stamps, postally used without the overprint, are priced at NZD 8. This indicates the potentially lucrative payoff for forgers.|$|R
50|$|Accordingly, to Treynor, {{the absence}} of a dealer leaves those in the market for {{securities}} in a bind where they need to motivate the VBT to trade at prices exceeding 15-20% of the security’s value. Because the arrivals of sellers and buyers to a transaction are often random, the dealer’s presence serves to bring hurried sellers and buyers together at a lower spread, bringing the <b>dealer’s</b> <b>price</b> closer to the equilibrium price for a security.|$|R

40|$|Interest {{rates on}} {{consumer}} lending are lower when funds {{are tied to}} purchase of a durable good than when they are made available on an unconditional basis. Further, dealers often choose to bear the financial cost of their customers' credit purchases. This paper interprets this phenomenon in terms of monopolistic price discrimination. We characterize consumers' intertemporal consumption decisions and the <b>dealer's</b> <b>pricing</b> incentives when the consumers' unconditional lending and borrowing rate {{as well as the}} internal rate of return of the durable purchase differ. Our empirical analysis offers considerable support for the assumptions and implications of our theoretical perspective. ...|$|R
40|$|Using a {{new data}} set of US sportscard {{conventions}}, this paper extends and tests the pricing theory of two-sided markets. Since most sportscard conventions are local and convention organizers must set fees to attract both consumers and dealers, we have {{detailed information on}} consumer price, <b>dealer</b> <b>price</b> and platform competition. Consistent with the theory, we present two findings: first, consumer pricing decreases with competition at any reasonable distance, but pricing to dealers is insensitive to competition and in longer distance even increases with competition. One consistent explanation is that dealers multi-home within a short distance but single-home across longer distance. Second, when consumer price is zero (and presumably cannot go beyond zero), dealer pricing {{is more likely to}} decrease with competition. These two findings confirm a link of pricing between {{the two sides of the}} market. ∗We thank Mark Armstrong for guidance at an early stage, and to John List, Glen Weyl, Julian Wright, and seminar participants at the conference on the Future of Academic Communication at the University of Michigan for advice and comments.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of Internet car {{referral}} services on dealer pricing of automobiles in California. Combining data from J. D. Power and Associates and Autobytel. com, a major online auto referral service, we compare online transaction prices to regular street' prices. We find that the average customer of this online service pays approximately 2 % less for her car, which corresponds to about $ 450 for the average car. Fifteen percent of the savings comes from making the purchase at a low-price dealership affiliated with the web service. The remaining 85 % of the savings seem {{to be due to}} the bargaining power of the referral service and the lower cost of serving an online consumer. <b>Dealer</b> <b>price</b> dispersion declines with online sales, indicating we are picking up more than a selection effect. Online consumers who indicate they are ready to buy in the next two days pay even lower prices. Dealers pay less for an online customer's trade-in vehicle, although on-line customers are still better off overall than offline customers. Dealer average gross margin on an online vehicle sale is lower by about $ 300 than an equivalent offline sale. However, because online consumers are cheaper to serve and online sales may be new business for the dealerships, web-affiliated dealers are likely to be better off. Consumers who use the web do better than at least 61 % of offline consumers. ...|$|E

40|$|Dealers {{learn about}} asset values as they set prices and absorb {{informed}} order flow. These flows cause inventory imbalances. This study models price setting in markets such as foreign exchange, U. S. treasury bonds, European sovereign bonds, and the London Stock Exchange, where market makers have multiple instruments to smooth inventory imbalances and update priors about asset values. Estimating a <b>dealer</b> <b>pricing</b> model with multiple instruments for inventory control and information-gathering yields support for what at times have been elusive inventory and asymmetric information effects. The model presented yields direct {{measures of the}} structural-liquidity cost parameters faced by market makers, akin to Kyle's Lambda. For example, the estimates presented suggest that a $ 10 million incoming purchase pushes price up by roughly one basis point, and dealers expect to immediately lay off one-third of every incoming order. Compared with estimates of price setting in single <b>dealer</b> markets, <b>price</b> shading is {{found to have a}} smaller role in inventory management and information effects are shown to be stronger. Hence, estimating traditional microstructure models (based on only one market maker per asset) on data from asset markets where market makers have multiple instruments misses information from sources other than incoming order flows, and overemphasizes price shading in managing inventories. ...|$|R

First, quote adjustments are set relative to the inside quote, i. e. the best bid and ask in the market. Second, dealers react to the inside spread. Third, adjustments differ according to which dealer is currently at the inside. Adjustments are different if an ECN is currently at the inside compared to an in-dividual dealer.
