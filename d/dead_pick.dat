Mine is nothing to it. What's this in the iron pot? Is this what you feed them? Queer birds, hens--I wouldn't touch the stuff for a fortune. It looks perfectly poisonous. Flock around, you pullets. Come in your thousands. All bad nuts returned, and a souvenir goes with every corpse. A little more of this putrescent mixture for you, sir.

60|$|I shut my {{eyes for}} a moment. When I opened them again it was to see poor Marût higher in the air than ever he flew before. I thought {{that he would never}} come down, but he did at last with an awesome thud. Jana went to him and very gently, now that he was <b>dead,</b> <b>picked</b> him up in his trunk. I prayed that he might carry him away to some hiding-place and leave me in peace. But not so. With slow and stately strides, rocking the {{deceased}} Marût up and down in his trunk, as a nurse might rock a baby, he marched on to the very stone where I lay, behind which I suppose he had seen or smelt me all the time.|$|R

Although the film did not win, Blatty did win a Golden Globe for the film's screenplay. After initially poor box office returns in its test markets, Warner Bros. returned the film to Blatty and allowed him {{to take it to}} another distributor. United Film Distribution, affiliated with the United Artists theatre chain and best known for releasing George A. Romero's Dawn of the <b>Dead,</b> <b>picked</b> up the film and released it in other markets under the title Twinkle, Twinkle, [...] "Killer" [...] Kane. Blatty initially sold the videocassette rights to New World Pictures, who released it on tape in 1988.

All weapons except the knife require ammunition, which is dropped by <b>dead</b> enemies or <b>picked</b> up in the levels. Enemies and boss characters have multiple death animations depending on what body region the player shot. Because items dropped by fallen enemies rapidly disappear, players must engage foes from close range.|$|R
5000|$|Until 1908, {{the ships}} served in Home waters, the Mediterranean and the Far East. On the {{outbreak}} of the First World War Cressy, Aboukir, Hogue, Bacchante and Euryalus formed the Seventh Cruiser Squadron. Due to the obsolescence of the ships and that they were crewed by inexperienced reservists the squadron was known as the [...] "Live Bait Squadron". This epithet proved prophetic when Cressy, Hogue and Aboukir were sunk in a single action on 22 September 1914 by U-9 near Holland. After the first cruiser had been hit, the following cruisers both came to a <b>dead</b> halt to <b>pick</b> up survivors, making themselves easy targets for torpedoes.|$|R

Scarface opened fire. Batman swooped in and grabbed the woman and the dummy. He separated them and realized the dummy was a bomb. The woman escaped. Batman informed Gordon of what had happened.|$|R
50|$|Great-tailed grackles {{are noted}} for their diverse {{foraging}} habits. They extract larvae and insects from grassy areas; eat lizards, nestlings, and eggs; forage in freshly plowed land; remove parasites from cattle; and eat fruits (e.g., bananas, berries) and grains (e.g., maize, {{corn on the}} cob by opening the husks). They turn over objects to search for food underneath, including crustaceans, insects, and worms, they hunt tadpoles and fish by wading into shallow water, and although they do not swim, they catch fish by flying close to the water's surface, and are even reported to dive a few inches into the water to retrieve a fish. They are also known to <b>pick</b> <b>dead</b> insects off the license plates of parked cars, and kill barn swallows while flying.|$|R
