2500|$|The Victory at Jülich {{shows the}} only {{military}} {{event that the}} Queen participated in during her regency: the return of Jülich (or Juliers in French) to the Protestant princes. Being a crossing of Ruhr, Juliers was of great strategic importance for France and thus the French victory was chosen to be the glorious subject of Rubens' painting. [...] The scene is rich with symbolism highlighting her heroism and victory. [...] The Queen thrusts her arm high with an assembler's baton in hand. In {{the upper part of}} the image Victoria appears crowning her with laurel leaves which is a symbol of victory. Also symbolizing victory is the imperial eagle which can be seen in the distance. The eagle in the sky compels the weaker birds to flee. The Queen is accompanied by a womanly embodiment of what was once thought to be, Fortitude because of the lion beside her. However, the figure is Magnanimity, also referred to as Generosity, because of the riches held <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>palm.</b> One of the pieces in her hand is the Queen's treasured strand of pearls. [...] Other figures include Fame and the personification of Austria with her lion. Fame in the right side of the painting pushes air through the trumpet so powerfully that a burst of smoke comes out. In the painting Marie de’ Medici is highly decorated and triumphant after the collapse of a city, she is depicted across a white stallion to demonstrate that, like the departed King [...] Henry IV, she could triumph over rivals in warfare.|$|E
2500|$|Mr. Cheong, {{considers}} {{his wife}} to be [...] "completely unremarkable in any way". He explains that when he first met her, he was not even attracted to her and that suits him just fine. Mr. Cheong is content meandering through life; {{it seems as if}} his only goal is to live a conventional, unremarkable life. He chooses to marry his wife since he thinks she would prove to be a good, dutiful wife who would fit nicely into the kind of lifestyle he seeks. [...] After several years of relatively normal marriage, Mr. Cheong wakes up to find his wife disposing of all meat products in the house. He demands an explanation, and Yeong-hye replies vaguely that [...] "I had a dream." [...] Mr. Cheong attempts to rationalize his wife's life decision {{over the next few months}} and to deal with vegetarian meals at home, but eventually calls Yeong-hye's family and an intervention is scheduled. While around the dinner table, Yeong-hye's family attempts to convince her to eat meat; her father, who served in Vietnam and is known for his stern temperament, slaps her when she refuses. Her father then asks a reluctant Mr. Cheong and Yeong-hye's brother Yeong-ho to hold her arms while he force-feeds her a piece of pork. Yeong-hye breaks away, spits out the pork, grabs a fruit knife, and slits her wrist. The incredulous family rushes her to a hospital where she recovers and where Mr. Cheong admits to himself that she has become mentally unstable. As the section ends Yeong-hye manages to walk out of the hospital and when she is tracked down, she reveals a bird <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>palm,</b> which has a [...] "predator's bite" [...] in it, and she asks [...] "Have I done something wrong?" ...|$|E

60|$|I {{found the}} ladies {{waiting in the}} cabin, each with a bundle tied up in a kerchief. The waiting-woman lay upon the floor, still in a swoon, with Mistress Pamela {{kneeling}} beside her, chafing and slapping her hands, whilst Mrs. Evans {{sat at the table}} with <b>her</b> face buried <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>palms.</b> So soon as I entered Mistress Pamela arose.|$|R
6000|$|... "And that knapsack!" [...] added Louise Macy, {{pointing}} to the mark <b>in</b> <b>her</b> little <b>palm</b> where the strap had imbedded itself in the soft flesh.|$|R
60|$|She {{stopped at}} a spring which came silently to light beneath an {{overhanging}} sandstone. There was no dipper, and Rose, with a new daring, dropped {{on her knees and}} dipped some of the cool, sweet water <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>palm.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{took the}} coin {{out of her}} apron pocket, and showed it <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>palm.</b> I could have trifled with her, {{but it would not}} do; life and death were at stake. Mastering at once the sixpence and the hand that held it, I demanded, 'Am I to die without you, or am I to live for you?' ...|$|E
60|$|She {{opened her}} hand {{to look at the}} rings. They gave her SUCH pleasure, as they lay, the three circles, with their knotted jewels, {{entangled}} <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>palm.</b> She would have to try them on. She did so secretly, unwilling to let him see, so that he should not know her finger was too large for them. But he saw nevertheless. He always saw, if she wanted him not to. It was another of his hateful, watchful characteristics.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I want {{to whisper}} to you!' Her voice and manner were {{so full of}} feeling that somehow the other was moved. She bent her head, and Pearl taking <b>her</b> neck <b>in</b> <b>her</b> little <b>palms,</b> said: ...|$|R
60|$|Jess {{pressed his}} hand tightly <b>in</b> <b>her</b> two worn <b>palms,</b> {{but she did}} not speak.|$|R
6000|$|... "Decent?" [...] Andre-Louis' {{smouldering}} {{eyes turned}} to discharge upon M. Binet such a fulmination of contempt {{that the old}} scoundrel shifted uncomfortably in his chair. [...] "Did you mention decency, Binet? Almost you make me lose my temper, which is a thing that I detest above all others!" [...] Slowly his glance returned to Climene, who sat with elbows on the table, <b>her</b> chin cupped <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>palms,</b> regarding him with something between scorn and defiance. [...] "Mademoiselle," [...] he said, slowly, [...] "I desire you purely in your own interests to consider whither you are going." ...|$|R
60|$|As he spoke, {{the old man}} laid {{a bright}} gold dollar in her hand, patted the rosy cheek, and {{vanished}} {{in a cloud of}} dust, leaving Marjorie so astonished at the grandeur of the gift, that she stood looking at it {{as if it had been}} a fortune. It was to her; and visions of pink calico gowns, new grammars, and fresh hat-ribbons danced through her head in delightful confusion, as her eyes rested on the shining coin <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>palm.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{told her}} that I was like the average man. I was taking credit to myself for not devouring her like a wolf! She didn't listen to that. 'What can I do to make you like me?' she asked. She leaned toward me, her chin <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>palm,</b> {{thinking}} and suffering as her sweet little soul had never suffered before. 'I'm too simple,' she said, with a flash of startling insight. 'I don't know enough. I feel that. Can't I study and change that?' ...|$|E
60|$|She ended very slowly, {{her chin}} <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>palm,</b> {{her eyes on}} the floor. She made a grand picture of thought, {{something}} more active than meditation. Her dress trailed in long, sweeping lines, and against its rich dark purple folds her strong, white hands lay in vivid contrast. The most wonderful charm of her personality was her complete absorption in thought, or the speech of her visitor. She was interested in this keen-eyed, strong-limbed young fellow as a possible convert and reformer. She wanted to state herself clearly and fully to him. He was a fine listener.|$|E

60|$|As night fell, {{the wife}} {{did not feel}} so safe and well pleased. The loud talking in the office below and the {{occasional}} whooping of a crowd of mill-hands going by made her draw her chair nearer and lay <b>her</b> fingers <b>in</b> <b>her</b> husband's <b>palm.</b>|$|R
6000|$|She did not speak. After a pause {{she picked}} up the rolling-pin from the table and began absently rolling it down her lap to her knee, as if {{pressing}} out the stained silk skirt. [...] "Only," [...] she stammered, slowly rolling the pin handles <b>in</b> <b>her</b> open <b>palms,</b> [...] "I--I can't leave Josh." ...|$|R
60|$|Calderwood adds a silly tale of Dr. Herries. Beatrix Ruthven {{laughed at}} his lame leg; he looked <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>palm,</b> and {{predicted}} a great disaster. The same anecdote, with, of course, another subject, is told of Gowrie’s own prediction {{that a certain}} man would come to be hanged, which was fulfilled. Gowrie had been at Perth, before the convention at Holyrood of June 21. To Perth he returned; thence, some time in July (about the 20th), {131c} {{he went to his}} castle of Strabran, in Atholl, to hunt. Whether his brother the Master remained with him continuously till the Earl’s return to Perth on Saturday, August 2, I know not how to ascertain. If there is anything genuine in the plot-letters produced eight years later, the Master once or twice visited Edinburgh in July, but that may have been before going to Strabran.|$|E
60|$|She {{sat with}} her chin <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>palm,</b> her big eyes, like {{beautiful}} windows, letting in the sunshine and the grace of ships and clouds without effort, fixed in an ecstasy of reverie. Around her streamed floods of the city's newly acquired residents, clerks, bookkeepers, typewriters, shop-girls, butcher's boys, salesmen, all fresh from the small towns and from the farms of the West. As the ships passed, she gave her attention to these people--recognized in them many familiar types. There was the smart young man, son of the tavernkeeper in Cyene. There was the blundering big wag, Ed Smith of Molasses Gap (assistant shipping clerk in Smith & Rydal's hardware store now). There were types like Mary, hearty, loud-voiced, cheery, wholesome, whom the city could never rob of their native twang. There were Tom and Grace and Elsa and Bert {{and all the rest}} of the bright, restless spirits of the country towns and wide-awake school districts come to try their fortunes in the great city like herself.|$|E
6000|$|The beggarmen {{had waited}} in their places {{to give us}} another chance of meriting heaven; and at the church door still {{crouched}} the old beggarwoman. I saw now that the imploring eyes she lifted were sightless, and I could not forbear another alms, and as I put my copper big-dog in her leathern palm I said, [...] "Adios, madre." [...] Then happened something that I had long desired. I had heard and read that in Spain people always said at parting, [...] "Go with God," [...] but up to that moment nobody had said it to me, though I had lingeringly given many the opportunity. Now, at my words and {{at the touch of}} my coin this old beggarwoman smiled beneficently and said, [...] "Go with God," [...] or, as she put it in her Spanish, [...] "Vaya vested con Dios." [...] Immediately I ought to have pressed another coin <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>palm,</b> with a [...] "Gracias, madre; muchas gracias," [...] out of regard to the literary climax; but whether I really did so I cannot now remember; I can only hope I did.|$|E
5000|$|Her sharp finger {{is said to}} be her {{forefinger}} on {{her right}} hand. The sharp finger resembled a spear or obsidian knife, which she used to cut her victims. Her mouth was stained with blood from the livers she ate. Often she clutched her right hand tightly, because her hidden heart and only weak spot was <b>in</b> <b>her</b> right <b>palm.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Picturization for {{the song}} was {{proceeded}} {{a month after the}} recording of the song. The song was shot in Goa and Mauritius. The underwater shot of the song was completed in seven hours. The production team sent French divers to carry oxygen cylinders for Kapoor and Malhotra. Both Kapoor and Malhotra took special training in Scuba diving from Anees Adenwala, who was their chief scuba diving instructor. The song was choreographed by Raju Singh. Talking about the picturisation of the song, Suri stated [...] "The song is about everything a man would do for a woman whom he's hopelessly in love with. He fulfills all her wishes - dancing with butterflies, holding stars <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>palms,</b> going underwater, touching the first snow and more". The song has a sequence of snow fall which was actually shot at a bungalow on the outskirts of Mumbai, on one of the hottest days of the schedule. In the video, Kapoor is seen riding a Royal Enfield.|$|R
60|$|To Dorothea, {{still in}} that time of youth when the eyes with their long full lashes look out after their rain of tears unsoiled and unwearied as a freshly opened passion-flower, that morning's parting with Will Ladislaw {{seemed to be the}} close of their {{personal}} relations. He was going away into the distance of unknown years, and if ever he came back he would be another man. The actual state of his mind--his proud resolve to give the lie beforehand to any suspicion that he would play the needy adventurer seeking a rich woman--lay quite out of her imagination, and she had interpreted all his behavior easily enough by her supposition that Mr. Casaubon's codicil seemed to him, as it did to her, a gross and cruel interdict on any active friendship between them. Their young delight in speaking to each other, and saying what no one else would care to hear, was forever ended, and become a treasure of the past. For this very reason she dwelt on it without inward check. That unique happiness too was dead, and in its shadowed silent chamber she might vent the passionate grief which she herself wondered at. For the first time she took down the miniature from the wall and kept it before her, liking to blend the woman who had been too hardly judged with the grandson whom her own heart and judgment defended. Can any one who has rejoiced in woman's tenderness think it a reproach to her that she took the little oval picture <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>palm</b> and made a bed for it there, and leaned her cheek upon it, as if that would soothe the creatures who had suffered unjust condemnation? She did not know then that it was Love who had come to her briefly, as in a dream before awaking, with the hues of morning on his wings--that it was Love to whom she was sobbing her farewell as his image was banished by the blameless rigor of irresistible day. She only felt that there was something irrevocably amiss and lost in her lot, and her thoughts about the future were the more readily shapen into resolve. Ardent souls, ready to construct their coming lives, are apt to commit themselves to the fulfilment of their own visions.|$|E
6000|$|The {{tourists}} were better fitted {{for the next}} occasion of sentiment, which was at the Hotel Dieu whither they went after returning from the battlefield. It took all the mal-address of which travellers are masters to secure admittance, {{and it was not}} till they had rung various wrong bells, and misunderstood many soft nun-voices speaking French through grated doors, and set divers sympathetic spectators doing ineffectual services, that they at last found the proper entrance, and were answered in English that the porter would ask if they might see the chapel. They hoped to find there the skull of Brebeuf, one of those Jesuit martyrs who perished long ago for the conversion of a race that has perished, and whose relics they had come, fresh from their reading of Parkman, with some vague and patronizing intention to revere. An elderly sister with a pale, kind face led them through a ward of the hospital into the chapel, which they found in the expected taste, and exquisitely neat and cool, but lacking the martyr's skull. They asked if it were not to be seen. [...] "Ah, yes, poor Pere Brebeuf!" [...] sighed the gentle sister, with the tone and manner of having lost him yesterday; [...] "we had it down only last week, showing it to some Jesuit fathers; but it's in the convent now, and isn't to be seen." [...] And there mingled apparently in her regret for Pere Brebeuf a confusing sense of his actual state as a portable piece of furniture. She would not let them praise the chapel. It was very clean, yes, but there was nothing to see in it. She deprecated their compliments with many shrugs, but she was pleased; for when we renounce the pomps and vanities of this world, we are pretty sure to find them in some other,--if we are women. She, good and pure soul, whose whole life was given to self-denying toil, had yet something angelically coquettish in her manner, a spiritual-worldliness which was the clarified likeness of this-worldliness. O, had they seen the Hotel Dieu at Montreal? Then (with a vivacious wave of the hands) they would not care to look at this, which by comparison was nothing. Yet she invited them to go through the wards if they would, and was clearly proud to have them see the wonderful cleanness and comfort of the place. There were not many patients, but here and there a wan or fevered face looked at them from its pillow, or a weak form drooped beside a bed, or a group of convalescents softly talked together. They came presently to the last hall, {{at the end of which}} sat another nun, beside a window that gave a view of the busy port, and beyond it the landscape of village-lit plain and forest-darkened height. On a table at her elbow stood a rose-tree, on which hung two only pale tea-roses, so fair, so perfect, that Isabel cried out in wonder and praise. Ere she could prevent it, the nun, to whom there had been some sort of presentation, gathered one of the roses, and with a shy grace offered it to Isabel, who shrank back a little as from too costly a gift. [...] "Take it," [...] said the first nun, with her pretty French accent; while the other, who spoke no English at all, beamed a placid smile; and Isabel took it. The flower, lying light <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>palm,</b> exhaled a delicate odor, and a thrill of exquisite compassion for it trembled through her heart, as if it had been the white, cloistered life of the silent nun: with its pallid loveliness, it was as a flower that had taken the veil. It could never have uttered the burning passion of a lover for his mistress; the nightingale could have found no thorn on it to press his aching poet's heart against; but sick and weary eyes had dwelt gratefully upon it; at most it might have expressed, like a prayer, the nun's stainless love of some favorite saint in paradise. Cold, and pale, and sweet,--was it indeed only a flower, this cloistered rose of the Hotel Dieu? ...|$|E

60|$|They {{all turned}} their heads. A queer change {{seemed to have}} come into the Professor's face. His teeth were gleaming between his parted lips, his head was a little thrust forward, his eyes were filled with a strange, hard light. He was a {{transformed}} being, unrecognisable, perturbing. Even while they watched, the girl floated close to where he sat and leaned towards him with a queer, mocking smile. His hand suddenly descended upon her foot. She laughed still more. There was a little exclamation from Lenora. The Professor's whole frame quivered, he snatched the anklet from the girl's ankle and bent over it. She leaned towards him, a torrent of words streaming from her lips. The Professor answered <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> own language. She listened to him in amazement. The anger passed. She held out both her hands. The Professor still argued. She shook her head. Finally he placed some gold <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>palms.</b> She {{patted him on the}} cheek, laughed into his eyes, pointed behind and resumed her dancing. The anklet remained in the Professor's hand.|$|R

Before the performance that evening, a used-clothes peddler named Jéricho reads <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>palm</b> that she will marry the man she loves, as he knew her father was worried about her mood affecting her performances. When a fight breaks out that evening between two rival clans of actors, Baptiste and Frédérick manage to calm the crowd down by improvising a mime act, thus saving the day's receipts.
