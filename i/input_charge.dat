5000|$|Accumulated heat is an {{important}} consideration {{in the operation of}} a compressor in an internal combustion engine. Of the three basic supercharger types, the Roots design historically possessed the worst thermal efficiency, especially at high pressure ratios. In accordance with the ideal gas law, a compression operation will raise the temperature of the compressed output. Additionally, the operation of the compressor itself requires energy input, which is converted to heat and can be transferred to the gas through the compressor housing, heating it more. Although intercoolers are more commonly known for their use on turbochargers, superchargers may also benefit from the use of an intercooler. Internal combustion is based upon a thermodynamic cycle, and a cooler temperature of the intake charge results in a greater thermodynamic expansion and vice versa. A hot intake charge provokes detonation in a petrol engine, and can melt the pistons in a diesel, while an intercooling stage adds complexity but can improve the power output by increasing the amount of the <b>input</b> <b>charge,</b> exactly as if the engine were of higher capacity. An intercooler reduces the thermodynamic efficiency by losing the heat (power) introduced by compression, but increases the power available because of the increased working mass for each cycle. Above about [...] the intercooling improvement can become dramatic. With a Roots-type supercharger, one method successfully employed is the addition of a thin heat exchanger placed between the blower and the engine. Water is circulated through it to a second unit placed near the front of the vehicle where a fan and the ambient air-stream can dissipate the collected heat.|$|E

40|$|The {{most common}} battery {{charging}} approaches for nickel-hydrogen batteries suffer from two key limitations. They either consistently under- or overcharge the battery or they require accurate {{knowledge of the}} battery capacity. For the ORBCOMM constellation of 36 small communications satellites, regular overcharging is unacceptable because it decreases battery life. Worse, the lost life occurs when the satellite constellation is facing its greatest usage demand. On the other hand, obtaining an accurate knowledge of the battery capacity requires an upfront effort to develop the necessary engineering tools and characterize battery performance. In addition, the satellite operator must bear the recurring expense of continuously estimating the capacity over the 5 -year design life of each spacecraft. To avoid these limitations, the ORBCOMM system employs a patented battery charging approach that estimates the battery charging efficiency by computing the amount of charge received by the battery {{as a function of}} the <b>input</b> <b>charge.</b> The full point of the battery is easily determined since the charge efficiency drops as the battery charge approaches its capacity. The battery charge is estimated by computing the moles of H 2 gas in the cell; the <b>input</b> <b>charge</b> is simply the integral of the charge current. So, the charge efficiency is proportional to the rate of change of the moles of H 2 gas with respect to the <b>input</b> <b>charge,</b> or dM/dC. This maintenance-free approach enables the charging routine to perfectly fill the batteries-without overcharging-independent of the battery capacity. Any algorithm based upon a derivative estimate poses a noise rejection challenge. The dMldC approach is no different. The battery charge control system must be adept enough to respond to decreases in dM/dC yet stable enough to avoid the inherent signal to noise problem at low charge rates. The effectiveness and pitfalls of the dM/dC battery charge algorithm are highlighted using data from the 26 ORBCOMM constellation spacecraft launched between December 1997 and September 1998...|$|E
