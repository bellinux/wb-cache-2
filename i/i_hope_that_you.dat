25|$|Now, praise be to God that Dr. Zamenhof has {{invented the}} Esperanto language. It {{has all the}} {{potential}} qualities of becoming the international means of communication. All of us must be grateful and thankful to him for this noble effort; for in this way he has served his fellowmen well. With untiring effort and self-sacrifice {{on the part of}} its devotees Esperanto will become universal. Therefore every one of us must study this language and spread it as far as possible so that day by day it may receive a broader recognition, be accepted by all nations and governments of the world, and {{become a part of the}} curriculum in all the public schools. I hope that Esperanto will be adopted as the language of all the future international conferences and congresses, so that all people need acquire only two languages—one their own tongue and the other the international language. Then perfect union will be established between all the people of the world. Consider how difficult it is today to communicate with various nations. If one studies fifty languages one may yet travel through a country and not know the language. Therefore <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> will make the utmost effort, so that this language of Esperanto may be widely spread.|$|E

2500|$|The Han Jin Chunqiu (漢晉春秋) by Xi Zuochi (習鑿齒) further {{described}} this uncanny friendship between Lu Kang and Yang Hu. After returning to Jin, Yang Hu started promoting morality and civility, and many Wu citizens {{were impressed with}} him. Lu Kang told the Wu forces stationed at the Wu-Jin border, [...] "If they govern with virtue and we administer our state like tyrants, we'll lose the war without even having to fight. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can guard the border well and not stir up problems over trivial matters." [...] The Wu-Jin border experienced peace and stability as both sides actively practised détente and got along harmoniously with each other. If cattle from one side accidentally strayed across the border, the other side would allow the owners {{to cross the border}} and retrieve their cattle. During hunting expeditions in the Mian (沔) area at the border, if the citizens of either side were injured, the other would send them home safely. When Lu Kang fell sick, he asked for medicine from Yang Hu. Yang Hu obliged and said, [...] "This medicine is of fine quality. I prepared it myself. I haven't tried it myself when I heard that you're ill so I sent it to you." [...] Lu Kang's subordinates cautioned him against taking Yang Hu's medicine because they were worried that Yang might harm him, but Lu ignored them. When the Wu emperor Sun Hao received news of peaceful relations between Wu and Jin, he sent a messenger to reprimand Lu Kang, but Lu replied, [...] "Ordinary peasants in the countryside have to keep their promises, much less me, a government official. If I do not live the virtues, I will appear as a stark contrast to Yang Hu. This does not result in any harm to Yang Hu." [...] However, there were some who disagreed with the behaviour of Lu Kang and Yang Hu, as they believed that Lu and Yang were not fulfilling their loyalties to their respective states.|$|E
