40|$|The South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) {{manages a}} system of canals and {{structures}} that control the flow through several large storm water treatment areas (STA). The present project was initiated because of the partial failure of a three-barrel, gated box culvert structure that belongs to the system. The structure has a forebay with three sluice gates that control the flow into three 8 ft by 8 ft box culverts. Settling and partial failure of the culverts in the structure was presumably caused by piping of sediment through joints in pre-cast sections of culvert. It was hypothesized that both unsteady pressure fluctuations and pressure differentials between the outside and inside of the culverts led to the piping failure. To better understand flow characteristics in the culvert that may cause these adverse effects, a 1 : 8 -scale model {{of one of the}} three gated culverts was constructed. The bed of the model culvert was instrumented with eight pressure tap transducers. In addition, a Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) system was employed to record velocity distributions immediately downstream of the sluice gate, where piping and settlement was most prominent in the prototype. Eight experiments of varying <b>gate</b> <b>settings</b> and flow conditions were carried out in the flume model. Both pressure and velocity distribution data were gathered. PIV data provided visual depiction of the formation, travel path, and translation to the flume bed of turbulent flow structures originating in the hydraulic jump recirculation zone within the model. The pressure taps captured spikes in pressures associated with these flow structures as they were translated to the bed. Trends between pressure and velocity were observed in the data and indicated that low <b>gate</b> <b>settings</b> produced conditions that were more likely to cause the aforementioned adverse effects in the prototype. The flow jet in low <b>gate</b> <b>settings</b> produced strong negative pressure zones along the bed, downstream of the gate. It also generated a more pronounced recirculation zone above the jet where turbulent structures were observed to form and be translated to the bed causing spikes in pressure. Adviser: David M.

40|$|A {{fuzzy logic}} based {{centralized}} control algorithm for irrigation canals is presented. Purpose of the algorithm is to control downstream discharge and water level of pools in the canal, by adjusting discharge {{release from the}} upstream end and <b>gates</b> <b>settings.</b> The algorithm {{is based on the}} dynamic wave model (Saint-Venant equations) inversion in space, wherein the momentum equation is replaced by a fuzzy rule based model, while retaining the continuity equation in its complete form. The fuzzy rule based model is developed on fuzzification of a new mathematical model for wave velocity, the derivational details of which are given. The advantages of the fuzzy control algorithm, over other conventional control algorithms, are described. It is transparent and intuitive, and no linearizations of the governing equations are involved. Timing of the algorithm and method of computation are explained. It is shown that the tuning is easy and the computations are straightforward. The algorithm provides stable, realistic and robust outputs. The disadvantage of the algorithm is reduced precision in its outputs due to the approximation inherent in the fuzzy logic. Feed back control logic is adopted to eliminate error caused by the system disturbances as well as error caused by the reduced precision in the outputs. The algorithm is tested by applying it to water level control problem in a fictitious canal with a single pool and also in a real canal with a series of pools. It is found that results obtained from the algorithm are comparable to those obtained from conventional control algorithms...|$|R

40|$|Flow cytometry (FCM) is a rapid, cultivation-independent tool {{to assess}} and {{evaluate}} bacteriological quality and biological stability of water. Here we demonstrate that a stringent, reproducible staining protocol combined with fixed FCM operational and <b>gating</b> <b>settings</b> is essential for reliable quantification of bacteria and detection of changes in aquatic bacterial communities. Triplicate measurements of diverse water samples with this protocol typically showed relative standard deviation values and 95 % confidence interval values below 2. 5 % on all the main FCM parameters. We propose a straightforward and instrument-independent method for the characterization of water samples based on the combination of bacterial cell concentration and fluorescence distribution. Analysis of the fluorescence distribution (or so-called fluorescence fingerprint) was accomplished firstly through a direct comparison of the raw FCM data and subsequently simplified by quantifying the percentage of large and brightly fluorescent high nucleic acid (HNA) content bacteria in each sample. Our approach enables fast differentiation of dissimilar bacterial communities (less than 15 min from sampling to final result), and allows accurate detection of even small changes in aquatic environments (detection above 3 % change). Demonstrative studies on (a) indigenous bacterial growth in water, (b) contamination of drinking water with wastewater, (c) household drinking water stagnation and (d) mixing of two drinking water types, univocally showed that this FCM approach enables detection and quantification of relevant bacterial water quality changes with high sensitivity.

Three bottom gates are used to locally deplete the nanowire creating a ballistic quantum point contact {{with only a few}} conducting channels. In a magnetic field, the Zeeman splitting of the corresponding 1 D subbands is revealed by the emergence of conductance plateaus at multiples of $e^ 2 $/h, yet we find a quantized conductance pattern largely dependent on the configuration of voltages applied to the bottom gates. In particular, we can make the first plateau disappear leaving a first conductance step of 2 $e^ 2 /h$, which is indicative of a remarkable two-fold subband degeneracy that can persist up to several Tesla. We conclude that the subband energy spacings and g-factors are strongly affected by the tunable landscape of the local electrostatic potential. Finally, our measurements reveal the presence of discrete resonant states that, for certain <b>gate</b> voltage <b>settings,</b> produce conductance features resembling those expected from the opening of a helical gap in the subband structure.

The approach {{is based on an}} explicit finite-difference solution procedure of the St. Venant equations. The upstream <b>gate</b> <b>settings</b> are corrected according to the water level and the flow rate at the information nodes along the canal. The method is illustrated for the control of a canal pool bounded by an upstream gate and a downstream gate or pump. The effectiveness of the control has been tested using an unsteady-flow simulation model that is based on the complete St. Venant equations and the implicit Preissmann scheme. The simulation results show that the proposed control method can cope with rapid variations of water demand and unknown disturbances in the system. The influence of the number of information nodes and the assessment of the physical parameters of the system on the response of the system has been investigated. Unless the estimated physical parameters of the system are too far from their actual values, an effective control can be achieved by measuring the water level and estimating the flow rate only at the most upstream and downstream ends of the pool. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers has {{developed}} and deployed a comprehensive data acquisition and hydrologic modeling system for short-term real time decision support of water control operations. This system, {{known as the}} “Corps Water Management System ” or CWMS, has been implemented at Corps offices through out the United States. CWMS provides tools for data acquisition, data management, data visualization, and forecast modeling. Hydrometeorologic data, including precipitation, river stage, <b>gate</b> <b>settings</b> and other data from field sensors, are collected, transformed, validated and stored in a standardized water control database. The measurements are used for calibration and adjustment of hydrologic and hydraulic models to reflect current conditions. Forecasting to support operational decision making can include any combination of the following models. Rainfall-runoff modeling with HEC-HMS based on gaged precipitation, Quantitative Precipitation Forecasts (QPF) and other future precipitation scenarios provides forecasts of river flows into and downstream of reservoirs. Simulation of reservoir operations, utilizing either the HEC-ResSim or CADSWES RiverWare program, uses these flow scenarios to provide operational decision information for the engineer. The river hydraulics program, HEC-RAS, computes river stages and water surface profiles for these scenarios. An inundation boundary and depth map {{of water in the}} flood plain can be calculated from the HEC-RAS results using ArcInfo. The economic impacts of the different flows are computed by HEC-FIA. The user-configurable sequence of modeling software allows engineers to evaluate operational decisions for reservoirs and other control structures, and view and compare hydraulic and economic impacts for various “what if? ” scenarios...|$|E

40|$|Laser-induced {{incandescence}} (LII) is {{a well-established}} technique for tracking soot, potentially enabling soot volume fraction determination. To obtain crank angle resolved {{data from a}} single cycle, a multi-kHz system should be applied. Such an approach, however, imposes certain challenges in terms of application and interpretation. The present work intends to apply such a high-speed system to an optically-accessible, compression ignition engine. Possible problems with sublimation, local gas heating or other multishot effects have been studied on an atmospheric co-flow burner prior to the engine experiments. It was found that, in this flame, fluences around 0. 1 J/cm 2 provide the best balance between signal-tobackground ratio, and soot sublimation. This fluence is well below the plateau regime of LII, which poses additional problems with interpretation of the signal. This is especially true when a wide span of temperatures and gradients is present, as encountered in diesel combustion. The {{purpose of this study}} is to provide an initial investigation into the feasibility of high-speed LII in engine applications. Particular attention will be given to the late combustion phase, i. e. after the end-of-injection, where phase-averaged data might not provide sufficient information. The pitfalls related to engine data interpretation are briefly discussed and some qualitative results are shown, which have been verified with high-speed luminosity measurements. To apply high-speed LII in an engine one should take utmost care with the selection of detection equipment (e. g. filters and detection <b>gate)</b> and <b>settings</b> to suppress the strong background radiation. All in all, the technique is found to be feasible, but the balance between fluence, signal strength, and effects on soot morphology was shown to be extremely delicate, and proper detection equipment is a requirement...|$|R
40|$|A {{workshop}} {{was held}} in The Netherlands and Belgium {{with the aim of}} investigating whether or not the use of a standard protocol vs. local protocols for flow cytometric enumeration of CD 34 + hematopoietic progenitor cells would reduce interlaboratory variation. The standard protocol consisted of a three-color, whole-blood staining technique based on fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) -labeled CD 34, and phycoerythrin (PE) -labeled CD 14 and CD 66 e monoclonal antibodies (reactive with monocytic and myeloid cells, respectively), followed by erythrocyte lysis, washing, fixation, and selection of nucleated cells during data acquisition {{on the basis of their}} positivity for LDS- 751 (staining DNA and RNA). Data analysis guidelines included the elimination of nonspecific antibody binding by monocytes and myeloid cells by gating on the CD 14 -, 66 e- cells, followed by setting a window on a CD 34 vs. sideward light scatter (SSC) plot around the CD 34 +, SSClow cells. The FITC-labeled isotype control was analyzed with the same <b>gate</b> and window <b>settings,</b> and the false-positive events were subtracted from CD 34 result. Four samples (i. e., peripheral blood and apheresis product from two patients) were sent out. Results were received on patient 1 (2) from 36 (38) laboratories. Data obtained by 24 (26) laboratories after correct application of the standard protocol revealed that the median percentage of CD 34 + cells of the four samples ranged between 1. 1 % and 3. 7 % and the CVs between 18 % and 30 %. Incorrect performance of the standard protocol by 12 laboratories, mainly resulting from gating errors, yielded a larger variation (CVs ranging between 50 % and 82 %). CD 34 enumeration using local protocols by 29 (34) laboratories yielded median percentage of CD 34 + cells ranging between 1. 2 % and 3. 9 % and CVs ranging between 34 % and 106 %.

No matter how you cut it, this is an automatic volume control [...] . a hand on a control, turning it down and turning it up again. The hand is fast and accurate, {{but it is just}} turning a volume control. When the input signal reaches a level set by the Threshold control, the compressor begins to turn the signal down by an amount determined by the Ratio control. The DC 22 S, like most compressors, operates by making the loud signals quieter, but does not make the quiet parts louder. However, by keeping the loud signals under control, the entire system may be turned up when necessary to make the quiet parts louder. There {{is more than just a}} stereo compressor working here. The adjustable Gate is a downward expander, acting like a com-pressor running in reverse, making the quiet parts quieter. This is valuable in reducing system background noise. The Ratio is fixed at 2 : 1. When the signal drops below the set Threshold, the Gate Threshold indicator lights and the output level is reduced by 2 dB for every 1 dB the input signal level drops.

40|$|During sepsis, a {{relative}} increase of regulatory T (Treg) cells has been reported. Its persistence {{is associated with}} lymphocyte anergy, immunoparalysis and a poor prognosis. Currently, an exact quantification of human Treg cells based on protein expression of marker molecules is ambiguous, as these molecules are expressed also by activated non-regulatory T cells. Furthermore, no firm criteria for flow cytometer <b>gate</b> <b>settings</b> exist so far. Recently, a specific DNA methylation pattern within FOXP 3 -TSDR {{has been reported that}} allows distinguishing Treg and non-regulatory T cells, independent of their activation status. Using this epigenetic marker, we established a single-tube real-time PCR based methylation assay (QAMA) for relative quantification of Treg cells. Validation was performed on defined ratios of methylated and unmethylated target sequence and on mixtures of Treg and non-regulatory T cells. DNA-methylation was measured in CD 4 (+) T cells isolated from blood samples of 30 septic patients and 30 healthy subjects and compared with results of Treg cell quantification by flow cytometry based on CD 4 (+) CD 25 (hi) CD 127 (low) measurement. In septic patients both methods showed an increased ratio of Treg cells to all CD 4 (+) T cells. In healthy individuals, the results obtained by both methods were clearly positively correlated. However, the correlation between both methods in septic patients was only weak. We showed that quantification of Treg cells by QAMA detects CD 4 (+) T cells with unmethylated FOXP 3 -TSDR, hidden in the CD 25 (med/low) fraction of flow cytometry. Given that unmethylated FOXP 3 -TSDR is the most specific feature of Treg cells to date, our assay precisely quantifies Treg cells, as it additionally detects those committed Treg cells, hidden in the CD 25 (med/low) fraction of CD 4 (+) cells. Furthermore, QAMA is a reliable method, which is easier to standardize among laboratories and can thus improve reproducibility of Treg cell quantification...|$|E
40|$|Manure {{application}} {{is a critical}} component of any livestock production system. Proper use of manure nutrients can reduce fertilizer costs and minimize the risk of pollution to ground and surface water. To accomplish this, several things should be done: 1. Complete soil fertility tests on each field that will receive manure prior to application; 2. Determine the fertilizer recommendations for each field receiving manure based on soil fertility tests, crop to be grown, and a realistic yield goal; 3. Collect a representative sample from each manure source to be applied and have it analyzed to determine the nutrient content of each sample; and 4. Calculate the amount of manure to be applied on each field to provide the plant nutrients needed. Applicator calibration can help determine not only manure nutrient application rate, but uniformity as well. Applicators apply manure at varying rates and patterns, depending on speed and/or power take-off (PTO) speed, gearbox <b>settings,</b> <b>gate</b> openings, etc. Determining nutrient application rate can be accomplished {{in a variety of ways}} and can be as simple as the following example: Example: One hundred (100) loads of liquid manure (30 lb plant available nitrogen/ 1, 000 gal) are to be applied to a 60 -acre field. The capacity of the tank wagon is 3, 000 gal, so the application rate will be: gal 100 loads x 3, 000 = 300, 000 gal load Since this volume is to be applied to 60 acres, the rate of application will be: And the nutrient application rate will be: If this is not the desired nutrient rate, adjust operating conditions (e. g., ground speed, spreader setting, etc.) to apply manure at the desired nutrient application rate. Repeat calibration if there are changes in the amounts or types of bedding or the amount of dilution water added to the manure. Conversely, one can determine the manure application rate needed to achieve a desired nutrient application by dividing the field nutrient rate needed (based on the nutrient needs of the crop to be grown and soil test results) by the nutrient content of the manure...|$|R
40|$|The Ohio River Valley {{is one of}} {{the most}} heavily industrialized basins in the United States. As a result, the Ohio River, Monogahela, MusldngUln, Kanawha, and other tributaries often {{experience}} poor water quality. One measure of poor water quality is low dissolved oxygen concentrations during low flow periods. Most of the rivers in the Ohio River Valley have been transformed into navigable waterways through a series of locks and dams. The free flowing river is now a series of pools. Quiescent pools do not promote the transfer of oxygen into the water due to low turbulence levels. Fortunately, the hydraulic structures themselves may actually be a key componen~ in improving the water quality because of the high turbulence levels generated at these structures. The purpose of this study is to investigate the use of dam gates and hydropower installations for the addition of oxygen to the water. The amount of oxygen added to the water varies with the structural characteristics, gate opening, and hydraulic conditions. Analysis of the most recent data taken in 1998, along with data taleen in previous years, shows trends for oxygen transfer at gate sill structures. Gate tests indicate that a high tailwater submergence of the sill allows minimal oxygen transfer to occur until an unsubmerged hydraulic jUlUP forms. The transfer efficiency will increase until a maximUlU transfer is reached. Beyond this critical gate opening, the transfer efficiency will level out or may even decline. If the submergence on the sill is low, a hydraulic jUlnp can form at very low <b>gate</b> <b>settings.</b> In this case, the transfer efficiencies will increase to a maximUlU at the critical gate opening. After this gate setting is reached, the transfer efficiencies will level out or decline. Te:;ts were also perfonned on hydropower installations with the draft tube air vent opened. Analysis of all sites indicates that oxygen transfer is negligible due to insufficient suction head. The minimal retrofit scheme is not suitable for raising oxygen levels. A more detailed study of retrofit options is needed to raise oxygen levels through hydrotuI'bine venting, In conclusion, the gated sill structures show promise as a tool for improving water quality within the river system by raising oxygen levels, if operated under close-tooptimum hydraulic conditions for gate aeration.
