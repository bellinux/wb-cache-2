40|$|Abstract. An {{extended}} enterprise {{is comprised of}} multiple linkages between and amongst a company and its suppliers, distributors, customers and others. Linkages are long term collaborative agreements based on synergies {{and the ability to}} create value. An {{extended enterprise}} eliminates wasteful transaction costs and removes redundancies, delays and inefficiencies from the supply chain. This is accomplished through the coordination of demand forecasting, production planning, deployment and transportation as well as creating organizational and process links with seamless information flows between them. Extended enterprise is enabled by developments in technology, especially information technology. Sharing information about sales forecast, production schedules, inventory, etc. makes an extended enterprise a win/win situation. Extended enterprise networks have used information technology systems such as <b>electronic</b> <b>data</b> <b>interchanges,</b> enterprise resource planning, and the Internet with different degrees of success. The Integrated Manufacturing Technology Initiative has identified several information technology criteria as {{critical to the success of}} future enterprises. Based on these criteria, this paper discusses XML’s contribution to the extended enterprise paradigm. Dell’s direct sale model is used to illustrate the role of XML in enterprise extension...|$|R

MRO {{continues}} to be a primary area of supply chain management that is constantly re-structuring its processes in order to reduce costs and efficiently handle large volumes of parts, materials, and goods necessary to produce products that will eventually be consumed globally. MRO is receiving even greater attention than before from the manufacturing and service industry due to the costs are associated with meeting the goals of business divisions whether they are financial or market driven. Globalism requires a flexible and efficient way in which all process partners and end users meet their individual department objectives, without creating counterintuitive policies and inventory management procedures. An increase in productivity, cost-savings, service levels, and proactive management of MRO is possible without sacrificing quality along with internal and external controls. MRO must delineate from the familiarity of transaction-based activities to strategically based initiatives. Background.

40|$|The {{maritime}} logistics {{associated with}} the international trade of container cargoes {{are concerned with the}} flows of cargo, information, finance, and images among stakeholders. The stakeholders include shippers, consignees, freight forwarders, third-party logistics providers (3 PL), land and sea carriers, ports, and government agents and customs officers. 1 The seamless, smooth flow of container cargoes and related information among the stakeholders contributes to reduced logistics costs and, consequently, to the improved competitiveness and productivity of each stakeholder and increased competitiveness in international trade. In this regard, we propose three innovative concepts of economies in maritime logistics - namely, the economies of flow, economies of connection, and economies of fusion technology. 2 Numerous stakeholders share the cargo information on the origin and destination of internationally sea-transported container cargoes, which relates to economies of flow and economies of connection. Information technologies (ITs) such as radiofrequency identification (RFID), global positioning systems (GPS), cargo tracking systems, and <b>electronic</b> <b>data</b> <b>interchanges</b> (EDIs) (Lee et al., 2000) have been applied to maritime logistics. Moreover, the single window system (SWS) collaboratively operated by the private and public sectors in Singapore and Korea has contributed to accelerating the flow of container cargoes and the sharing of the container information among the stakeholders...|$|R

XML nets are a formal, graphical modeling language that allows to model both the flow of XML documents and the business process. XML nets are based on GXSL, a graphical XML schema definition language, and its related graphical XML document manipulation language (XManiLa). They can be directly executed by a workflow engine. Advantage of the formal foundation of XML nets can be taken e. g. when analyzing a (global) interorganizational workflow model: XML nets support the process of identifying relevant process fragments, assigning them to the appropriate organizational units, and thus help deriving an improved, process-oriented organizational structure. 1...|$|R

5000|$|In 1970, {{concurrent}} {{with the}} announcement of System/370, {{the next generation of}} mainframes after System/360, a new system was announced, called RETAIN/370. This system was designed for use by special Technical Support Centers located in regional centers, rather than by the branch office. This new system was designed to support display terminals, rather than the old typewriter-based ones. A special version of the 2915 display, originally designed for the airline reservations systems, such as SABRE, was used. The 2915 was a small keyboard-display driven by a large <b>electronic</b> controller and <b>data</b> <b>interchange</b> unit, the IBM 2948. Each 2948 supported up to 31 display terminals, which had to be located within a few hundred feet. The cost of this display system, with its large controller, prevented the 2915 terminals from being utilized in branch offices. Thus, the use of regional support centers for this system. The older RETAIN system continued to be used for several years afterwards, running in parallel with RETAIN/370, still providing direct support to branch-office terminals. It was sometimes called the [...] "RETAIN/360" [...] system, although that designation was never formalized. In time, after RETAIN/370 became available via 3270 terminals in the branch offices, the old RETAIN system was phased out, and RETAIN/370 was renamed to simply RETAIN.|$|R
