5|$|In some {{reactions}} between highly {{reactive metals}} (usually from Group 1 or Group 2) and highly electronegative halogen gases, or water, the atoms can be ionized by <b>electron</b> <b>transfer,</b> a process thermodynamically understood using the Born–Haber cycle.|$|E
5|$|Ionic {{compounds}} containing hydrogen ions (H+) {{are classified}} as acids, and those containing basic ions hydroxide (OH−) or oxide (O2−) {{are classified as}} bases. Ionic compounds without these ions are also known as salts and can be formed by acid–base reactions. Ionic compounds can also be produced from their constituent ions by evaporation of their solvent, precipitation, freezing, a solid-state reaction, or the <b>electron</b> <b>transfer</b> reaction of reactive metals with reactive non-metals, such as halogen gases.|$|E
5|$|Research is also {{undertaken}} {{in this field}} of artificial photosynthesis. It {{involves the use of}} nanotechnology to store solar electromagnetic energy in chemical bonds, by splitting water to produce hydrogen fuel or then combining with carbon dioxide to make biopolymers such as methanol. Many large national and regional research projects on artificial photosynthesis are now trying to develop techniques integrating improved light capture, quantum coherence methods of <b>electron</b> <b>transfer</b> and cheap catalytic materials that operate under a variety of atmospheric conditions. Senior researchers in the field have made the public policy case for a Global Project on Artificial Photosynthesis to address critical energy security and environmental sustainability issues.|$|E

50|$|A {{rearrangement}} is {{not well}} represented by simple and discrete <b>electron</b> <b>transfers</b> (represented by curly arrows in organic chemistry texts). The actual mechanism of alkyl groups moving, as in Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement, probably involves transfer of the moving alkyl group fluidly along a bond, not ionic bond-breaking and forming. In pericyclic reactions, explanation by orbital interactions give a better picture than simple discrete <b>electron</b> <b>transfers.</b> It is, nevertheless, possible to draw the curved arrows for a sequence of discrete <b>electron</b> <b>transfers</b> that give the same result as a rearrangement reaction, although these are not necessarily realistic. In allylic rearrangement, the reaction is indeed ionic.|$|R

5|$|The {{electron}} {{transport chain}} carries both protons and electrons, passing electrons from donors to acceptors, and transporting protons across a membrane. These processes use both soluble and protein-bound transfer molecules. In mitochondria, electrons are transferred within the intermembrane space by the water-soluble <b>electron</b> <b>transfer</b> protein cytochrome c. This carries only electrons, {{and these are}} transferred by the reduction and oxidation of an iron atom that the protein holds within a heme group in its structure. Cytochrome c {{is also found in}} some bacteria, where it is located within the periplasmic space.|$|E
5|$|Although the heme {{proteins}} are {{the most}} important class of iron-containing proteins, the iron-sulfur proteins are also very important, being involved in <b>electron</b> <b>transfer,</b> which is possible since iron can exist stably in either the +2 or +3 oxidation states. These have one, two, four, or eight iron atoms that are each approximately tetrahedrally coordinated to four sulfur atoms; because of this tetrahedral coordination, they always have high-spin iron. The simplest of such compounds is rubredoxin, which has only one iron atom coordinated to four sulfur atoms from cysteine residues in the surrounding peptide chains. Another important class of iron-sulfur proteins is the ferredoxins, which have multiple iron atoms. Transferrin does not belong to either of these classes.|$|E
5|$|In metabolism, {{nicotinamide}} adenine dinucleotide {{is involved}} in redox reactions, carrying electrons from one reaction to another. The coenzyme is, therefore, found in two forms in cells: NAD is an oxidizing agent– it accepts electrons from other molecules and becomes reduced. This reaction forms NADH, which can then {{be used as a}} reducing agent to donate electrons. These <b>electron</b> <b>transfer</b> reactions are the main function of NAD. However, it is also used in other cellular processes, the most notable one being a substrate of enzymes that add or remove chemical groups from proteins, in posttranslational modifications. Because of the importance of these functions, the enzymes involved in NAD metabolism are targets for drug discovery.|$|E

5|$|Succinate-Q oxidoreductase, {{also known}} as complex II or succinate dehydrogenase, is a second entry point to the {{electron}} transport chain. It is unusual {{because it is the}} only enzyme that is part of both the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain. Complex II consists of four protein subunits and contains a bound flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor, iron–sulfur clusters, and a heme group that does not participate in <b>electron</b> <b>transfer</b> to coenzyme Q, but is believed to be important in decreasing production of reactive oxygen species. It oxidizes succinate to fumarate and reduces ubiquinone. As this reaction releases less energy than the oxidation of NADH, complex II does not transport protons across the membrane and does not contribute to the proton gradient.|$|E
25|$|Nitro {{compounds}} may {{be reduced}} to either the hydroxylamine or amine oxidation level with samarium iodide, depending on the conditions employed. <b>Electron</b> <b>transfer,</b> followed by proton transfer and elimination generates an intermediate nitroso compound, which undergoes two more rounds of <b>electron</b> <b>transfer</b> and protonation to afford the hydroxylamine. Further reduction of the hydroxylamine leads to the amine.|$|E

25|$|Other {{residues}} of RNR2, such as aspartate (D273), tryptophan (W48), and tyrosine (Y356) further {{stabilize the}} active-site tyrosyl radical thus allowing <b>electron</b> <b>transfer.</b> These residues {{help in the}} transfer of the radical electron from tyrosine (Y122) of RNR2 to cysteine (C439) of RNR1. The <b>electron</b> <b>transfer</b> begins on RNR2 tyrosine (Y122) and continues in RNR2 to tryptophan (W48), which is separated from RNR1 tyrosine (Y731) by 2.5 nanometers. <b>Electron</b> <b>transfer</b> from RNR2 to RNR1 occurs via tyrosine (Y356 to Y731) and continues on through tyrosine (Y730) to cysteine (C439) in the active site. Site-directed mutations of the RNR primary structure indicate that all residues cited above participate in the long distance transfer of the free radical to the active site.|$|E
25|$|Iron is an {{essential}} bioelement for most forms of life, from bacteria to mammals. Its importance lies {{in its ability to}} mediate <b>electron</b> <b>transfer.</b> In the ferrous state, iron acts as an electron donor, while in the ferric state it acts as an acceptor. Thus, iron plays a vital role in the catalysis of enzymatic reactions that involve <b>electron</b> <b>transfer</b> (reduction and oxidation, redox). Proteins can contain iron as part of different cofactors, such as iron-sulfur clusters (Fe-S) and heme groups, both of which are assembled in mitochondria.|$|E

Intensive properties, such as the number of <b>electrons</b> <b>transferred,</b> are difficult to be considered conductivity-dependent. Four different perovskite oxide catalysts of different conductivities were investigated with varying carbon contents. More conductive environments surrounding active sites, achieved by more conductive catalysts (providing internal electric pathways) or higher carbon content (providing external electric pathways), resulted in higher number of <b>electrons</b> <b>transferred</b> toward more complete 4 e reduction of oxygen, and also changed the rate-determining steps from two-step 2 e process to a single-step 1 e process. Experimental evidence of the conductivity dependency was described by a microscopic ohmic polarization model based on effective potential localized nearby the active sites. close...|$|R

25|$|A {{recent study}} by Roessler et al. (2010) used {{electron}} paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra and double electron-electron resonance (DEER) to determine the path of <b>electron</b> <b>transfer</b> through the iron-sulfur complexes, which {{are located in the}} hydrophilic domain. Seven of these clusters form a chain from the flavin to the quinone binding sites; the eighth cluster is located {{on the other side of}} the flavin, and its function is unknown. The EPR and DEER results suggest an alternating or “roller-coaster” potential energy profile for the <b>electron</b> <b>transfer</b> between the active sites and along the iron-sulfur clusters, which can optimize the rate of electron travel and allow efficient energy conversion in complex I.|$|E
