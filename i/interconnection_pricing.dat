40|$|A {{recurring}} {{telecommunications policy}} debate centers on whether incumbent, vertically integrated local exchange carriers {{have an incentive}} to discriminate in price against down-stage service rivals who interconnect to their network (a price squeeze). The concern is typically voiced in one of two claims: (1) there is an incentive for an incumbent to use a price squeeze when access prices are set above long-run incremental cost; or (2) prices set at that cost are preferred for interconnection because they eliminate incentives for a price squeeze. In principle, form (1) is generally true (Proposition 1), but form (2) is generally not (Proposition 2), The proof of these Propositions reveals why pricing access at long-run incremental cost coupled with appropriate price floors in the down-stage market does eliminate the incentive to squeeze.

The estimates confirm that network effects are very important in this indus-try and show that surcharge-induced incompatibility has a significant impact on demand for deposit services. The results also indicate that there is overinvestment in ATMs relative to the social optimum. Counterfactual experiments conditional on network size predict that a move to compatibility through the elimination of surcharges would substantially decrease market concen-tration, raise average deposit interest rates, raise consumer surplus, lower industry profits, and reallocate profits from large-network banks to small-network banks.

40|$|The {{issue of}} inter-provider cost {{distribution}} in international interconnection {{has been a}} subject of intense debate {{in the past few}} years. For various reasons, developing countries have had to bear high costs for international Internet connectivity. The transition of communication networks to IP-based networks enhances the urgency to resolve the apparent lack of fairness in international interconnection. This is due to the development of cheap technologies for voice communications, which reduces the revenues of developing countries received from international telephone calls, and at the same time, places the burden of international Internet connectivity costs on developing countries. There exists a large body of literature toward achieving the equitable and sustainable expansion of infrastructures in developing countries. It is mainly focused on proposing <b>interconnection</b> <b>pricing</b> schemes. However, the existing approaches strike the balance between the two objectives of <b>interconnection</b> <b>pricing,</b> viz., competition development and profitability quite differently. Hence, no single solution has a clear advantage over the others. The alternative approach towards solving the interconnection cost-sharing problem involves compensating each provider for the costs that it incurs in carrying traffic generated by other providers. However, compensation between providers cannot be solely done based on the traffic flows, because it provides a poor basis for allocating any costs. In the Internet, it is not clear who originally initiated a transmission, and therefore, who should pay for the costs. The key contribution of this dissertation is to support the development and profitability of the communications market by reducing the existing imbalance in the interconnection cost allocation. A novel technique called Differentiated Traffic-based Interconnection Agreement (DTIA) was proposed. The key idea behind DTIA is that instead of performing intercarrier compensation based on traffic flows, compensation is performed based on the original initiator of a transmission. Determination of a transmission initiator in packet-switched networks is a complicated task that deals with technical issues and considerable costs. We have tackled this challenge by marking the information about the transmission initiator in the IP packet header, and have proposed a traffic differentiation mechanism that has low computational complexity. In DTIA, providers get compensated differently for traffic originally initiated by their own customers, as opposed to traffic initiated by customers of other networks. Such an approach stimulates the development of market by ensuring that each provider is compensated for utilization of its infrastructure. In order to evaluate the differentiated traffic-based approach, we formulated economic models and analyzed their behaviors from different perspectives. Compared to existing solutions, the DTIA model enhances the economic efficiency of the market by improving social welfare...|$|E

40|$|Since 1997, the U. S. {{government}} {{has attempted to}} use the World Trade Organization (WTO) agreement on telecommunications services {{as a vehicle for}} 'exporting' American principles of telecommunications regulation to other nations. The United States took the position in 1997 that the WTO telecommunications agreement requires its signatory nations to follow the practices of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on telecommunications regulatory policy. Subsequently, the Office of the U. S. Trade Representative (USTR) has sought to influence, under the implicit threat of trade sanctions, Japan's domestic regulatory policy on the pricing of mandatory competitor access to the unbundled elements of the local network belonging to the operating companies of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT). In this Article, we examine the substantive difficulties of engrafting the FCC's interconnection policy onto the telecommunications marketplace of another nation. For more than five years, many American experts on telecommunications policy have disagreed whether American consumers have benefited from the very FCC policies that the USTR would have Japanese regulators emulate. The USTR's initiative appears to ignore that the transition to costoriented rates for interconnection and retail telecommunications services has been a difficult and unfinished process in the United States; that the cost models used by the FCC to set interconnection prices have significant deficiencies; that actual interconnection prices both within and outside the United States diverge considerably from the estimates of the FCC's cost models; that variations across countries in the prices of inputs {{have a significant effect on}} the costs of interconnection; and that, with respect to depreciation in particular, regulators treat this cost differently'and, from an economic perspective, more reasonably'in Japan than in the United States. Such substantive economic considerations suggest why the FCC's policy in this area has generated continuous litigation, including two Supreme Court cases, since 1996 and consequently is too unresolved at this point in the American experience for the United States to force on its trading partners. Next, we ask whether the USTR has the detailed knowledge required to negotiate trade agreements on <b>interconnection</b> <b>pricing.</b> We question the propriety of using the USTR to influence the domestic regulatory policy of another country on a topic as complex as the efficient pricing of mandatory access to unbundled network elements. The USTR's power to formulate trade policy on this subject resides in officials who are unlikely to possess the economic expertise and resources necessary to evaluate the consumer-welfare implications of the policies that they would have Japan and other nations adopt. For these reasons, the USTR cannot credibly make the <b>interconnection</b> <b>pricing</b> policies of another nation a legitimate concern of U. S. trade policy. ...|$|E

40|$|The authors {{provide an}} {{overview}} of recent privatization experiences in Argentina, Brazil, and Chile. They focus on both achievements and outstanding problems in the electricity sector. They pay special attention to the issue of whether regulators can enforce compliance and sustain the spirit of reform - bringing the forces of competition to the sector - despite the unavoidable adjustments and fine-tuning that effective regulation requires. Among the lessons: Competition, rather than privatization, is the key to transforming the sector. For competition to work, several conditions must be met: 1) The primary energy source must be competitive for competition in the wholesale market to work. (In Chile, {{the fact that most of}} the water rights have been allocated to the major generator company seriously limits efficiency in the sector.) 2) Monopolistic stages must be formally separate from other stages, with clear rules for third-party access. (Here, the structure adopted by Argentina seems superior to that adopted by Chile.) 3) New entry into the system is the ultimate test of competition. The main gain from competition in electricity generation comes from the decentralization of decisions about when, how much, and what type of generation has to be brought to the market, rather than from short-term gains from minimizing costs. Overall, vertical and horizontal separation in the sector increases rather than reduces the burden and complexity of regulation. In a disintegrated system, the issues that arose in a traditional monopoly situation (fair rate of return, asset base, tariff to final consumers, and so on) are significantly increased. New issues include third-party access, the promotion of competition, <b>interconnection</b> <b>pricing,</b> and consistency of regulations across stages of competitive development. Restructuring and privatization are still in their early stages so lessons drawn from experience must be considered tentative.

40|$|Interconnection is {{not only}} a major {{competition}} issue per se, it is also a critical element of the basic telecommunications agreement of the WTO. An important issue in interconnection regulation is interconnection charging especially {{in the context of a}} dominant incumbent. Most regulators in developing countries face challenges in setting interconnection prices in the absence of market information on the incumbent's or entrant's costs, competition or demand and models suited for developing countries that also adhere to the WTO guidelines. There are few papers that illustrate the challenges faced by regulators in such a context. This paper attempts to bridge the gap by highlighting the nature of interaction between the regulator, incumbent, judiciary and the political environment, the role of formal models in setting interconnection charges and the implications of rapid technological changes in a developing country context through a case study of India. The case study highlights the point that besides independence, it is important to vest enforcement powers in the regulatory agency for it to be credible. Incorporating the WTO interconnection guidelines within a developing country context has implications for network growth and poses challenges to the regulatory processes. Although Telecommunications Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) started with a distortionary, inefficiently priced network providing low coverage and quality, it has meandered its way to a more reasonable network access pricing regime. The decreasing cost of technology and increasing incomes in India and political interventions in regulation have put pressure on TRAI to provide lower interconnection charges and faster telecom growth. Thus, it is pragmatic for regulators to start with a "quick and dirty" estimate, provided that they can signal the downward trend in <b>interconnection</b> <b>pricing,</b> rather than wait for the "correct" estimates. Adoption of future looking strategies (interconnection exchanges), use of a variety of formal models, and strengthening of regulatory capacity are all necessary steps in fostering a competitive environment. Interconnection regimes set up early in the reform process require a review. For successful competition, effective dispute resolution mechanisms and institutions are also important.

40|$|This {{case study}} has {{provided}} an in-depth comparative review of policy approaches to network interconnection in China and Hong Kong SAR, both vertically and horizontally. These {{have been in}} sharp contrast, {{due to differences in}} the regulatory frameworks. Vertically, the interconnection policy in China has experienced a revolutionary leap forward before and after the establishment of the quasi-independent regulator - the Ministry of Information Industry (MII). The affiliation of China Telecom with the former Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT) had led to above-cost interconnection fees, protracted negotiations and unfair technical arrangements. As a result, political intervention over interconnection has been frequently requested. The different market position of China Unicom before and after the establishment of the MII has shown that an ineffective regulatory framework is perhaps the largest competitive barrier for new entrants. Horizontally, the controversial status of the former MPT in China and the completely independent status of OFTA in Hong Kong SAR have led to differing levels of regulatory perseverance in liberalising the telecommunications sector, and, in consequence, different approaches in dealing with network interconnections. The less-problematic experience in Hong Kong SAR demonstrates how important an independent regulatory agency is for a secure and healthy competitive market. OFTA's cost-oriented and market-driven principles on network <b>interconnection</b> <b>pricing</b> have, to a certain extent, prevented the occurrence of market distortion, while its transparent guidelines on interconnection have guaranteed the fairness and effectiveness in implementing network interconnection. If OFTA had in close affiliation to any of the operators, it would likely not have been possible for it to have taken this regulatory approach in the past few years. Clearly, an effective regulatory framework {{is one of the most}} critical factors in facilitating network interconnection, and in creating a truly competitive market. One of the lessons to be learned from this case study is that the affiliation of the incumbent operator with the regulator can place new entrants on a path to financial loss and frustration. Therefore, it seems timely for international organisations such as the ITU and the WTO to strengthen their stance in encouraging member states to ensure the independent status of their national regulators. Moreover, in countries where an independent regulator is still to be established, certain international standards over technical aspects of network interconnection, such as points of interconnection, traffic routing, signalling and quality of interconnection, might prove to be helpful...|$|E
40|$|Ever {{since the}} {{beginning}} of the nineties, <b>interconnection</b> <b>pricing</b> emerged as a high priority regulatory policy question. As more and more state-owned monopolies were privatized, their essential facility (or simply their network) had to be opened to competition. The most viable practice was call-by-call services in telecommunications markets. Entrants were allowed to buy capacity of the incumbent’s network in order to provide service to customers. Because the incumbent always has an incentive to foreclose the market, these agreements between incumbent and entrant were and still are in the focus of regulatory authorities all over the world. Although this so-called one-way interconnection model is still valid, competition between fully fledged networks has become of growing importance. Today cable providers are also capable of offering telecommunication services. However they dispose of a mature network and can bypass the former incumbent’s essential facility. Early models of network competition, such as Laffont, Rey, and Tirole (1998 a) and Armstrong (1998) highlight the collusive role of interconnection charges in these settings. Hence the regulator is called for. The present thesis looks at instruments that can be used to regulate interconnection markets. It is comprised of three papers on access pricing in one-way as well as in twoway interconnection models. Chapter 2 looks at instruments that can be employed by the regulator, chapters 3 and 4 introduce fully decentralized mechanisms, where the role of the regulator is reduced to a minimum. Chapter 2 introduces a one-way interconnection model with a vertically integrated incumbent and an entrant who uses the incumbent network. Firms produce differentiated services and compete for customers. Traditional literature on <b>interconnection</b> <b>pricing</b> uses primarily per-unit access charges, hence the interconnection payment depends on he overall amount of traffic exchanged. In this paper we present a different approach to pricing interconnection. Because products are differentiated, the demand for end service is directly dependent on both firms’ retail prices. We generalize the access payment function and make it solely dependent on market prices. I show that a per-unit access price is a special case of a contract on both firms’ retail prices. Because such a function uses at east two instruments, we are able to reproduce specific access charge rules. Furthermore, due to the increased number of instruments, the set of possible outcomes is increased compared to a per-unit access charge. By comparing different benchmark cases and computing their respective parameters, we show that they can be used as a preliminary measure of goodness of the access mechanism. Additionally, we show that bill & keep, that is providing access free of charge, yields lower retail prices than regulating a per-unit access charge at cost. Chapter 3 uses the findings of chapter 2 and introduces as particular mechanism based on firms’ retail prices. We use the exact same model of industry structure, i. e. a vertically integrated incumbent and an entrant, that uses network capacity as an essential input. Product market competition is imperfect, i. e. products are differentiated. The access pricing mechanism is fully decentralized, i. e. other than setting up the rules of the game, the regulator does not intervene in the market at all. This is a particular strength of our mechanism, since traditional access pricing rules always require the regulator to dispose of almost full market information 1. The access payment mechanism is modeled as a game between the incumbent and the entrant. Each firm determines a parameter in a linear payment function on firms’ downstream retail prices. We show that this results in lower prices and higher welfare than the regulated per-unit access charge approach. Furthermore we present conditions for which the equilibrium in the model coincides with the optimal Ramsey outcome. Chapter 4 draws on the literature pioneered by Laffont, Rey, and Tirole (1998 a), Laffont, Rey, and Tirole (1998 b) and Armstrong (1998). It uses a two-way interconnection model, with network-based price discrimination, i. e. firms charge different prices for their own and the competitor’s network. The paper of Gans and King (2001) shows, that when firms are able to charge two-part tariffs, a per-unit access charge is used as a collusive device. The optimal equilibrium access charge is below marginal cost, hence customers save on off-net calls. However this is more than offset by an increase in the flat payment and overall welfare is reduced as compared to a regime with access priced at marginal cost Using a consumer’s net-utility function we derive a new retail price mechanism. Instead of competing in flat fees, firms offer net-utility levels. In that case, the monthly payment is derived from the equilibrium net-utility level and the gross utility of making calls to both networks. The paper shows that using such a mechanism eliminates the collusive power of access charge is vanished and overall welfare is increased. Since net-utility is a function of the flat payment, the result is reminiscent of the literature on Bertrand and Cournot Competition with substitutes. We employ a graphical argument used in Cheng (1985) to show that competition in net-utility levels is a dominated strategy. The same is true for price competition when prices are complements...|$|E
40|$|I examine {{interconnection}} {{decisions of}} differentiated firms. I find that previous results that firms never interconnect enough do not hold. In a Hotelling model consumers may suffer from interconnection, and firms may interconnect {{when it is}} not socially optimal. The firms interconnect too much when the network effects are steeper - this makes firms compete much less aggressively after <b>interconnection,</b> raising <b>prices</b> for consumers and profits for firms. Price and profit rise results holds under quality and installed base asymmetries, or only some firms in the industry interconnecting. More dimensions of differentiation make interconnection less attractive. ...|$|R

40|$|In many {{countries}} infrastructure liberalization proceeded {{faster than the}} privatization of former state monopolies. Regulatory agencies, established to oversee the transition and safeguard the preconditions for competition, therefore monitor state-owned firms in addition to privately owned firms. The research on public-private firms has generated heterogeneous findings, with some pointing to the advantages and other to the disadvantages of this arrangement. Government regulation of mixed public-private firms raises additional complicated issues, of which the paper studies two using the example of European telecommunications between 2000 and 2004. It examines, first, whether the dual {{role of the state}} as owner and regulator could be abused to disadvantage private competitors. Second, it probes whether, conversely, the combination of government ownership and regulation might help overcome some of the shortcomings of the regulation of private firms. We find weak evidence that public and mixed regulated firms were subject to more favorable regulation of <b>interconnection</b> <b>prices.</b> However, this effect weakened as more independent regulation was established. In the area of universal service provision, there is no clear evidence that public and mixed telecommunication service providers were more likely than private ones to be utilized in pursuit of social output goals without explicit compensation. Overall, it seems that the presence of independent regulation, appeals processes, and competition review is a safeguard against capture by public and mixed firms. * Research assistance by Carol Ting and Junghyun Kim is gratefully acknowledged.
