50|$|<b>Failure</b> <b>of</b> {{eruption}} of teeth {{happens when a}} single or multiple teeth fail to erupt in the mouth.

40|$|Four {{verification}} test problems are presented for checking the conceptual development and computational implementation of calculations {{to determine the}} probability of loss of assured safety (PLOAS) in temperature-dependent systems with multiple weak links (WLs) and strong links (SLs). The problems are designed to test results obtained with the following definitions of loss of assured safety: (1) <b>Failure</b> <b>of</b> all SLs before <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> any WL, (2) <b>Failure</b> <b>of</b> any SL before <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> any WL, (3) <b>Failure</b> <b>of</b> all SLs before <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> all WLs, and (4) <b>Failure</b> <b>of</b> any SL before <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> all WLs. The test problems are based on assuming the same failure properties for all links, which results in problems that have the desirable properties of fully exercising the numerical integration procedures required {{in the evaluation of}} PLOAS and also possessing simple algebraic representations for PLOAS {{that can be used for}} verification of the analysis...|$|R

40|$|Relationships to {{determine}} {{the probability that a}} weak link (WL) /strong link (SL) safety system will fail to function as intended in a fire environment are investigated. In the systems under study, <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> the WL system before <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> the SL system is intended to render the overall system inoperational and thus prevent the possible occurrence of accidents with potentially serious consequences. Formal developments of the probability that the WL system fails to deactivate the overall system before <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> the SL system (i. e., the probability of loss of assured safety, PLOAS) are presented for several WWSL configurations: (i) one WL, one SL, (ii) multiple WLs, multiple SLs with <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> any SL before any WL constituting <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> the safety system, (iii) multiple WLs, multiple SLs with <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> all SLs before any WL constituting <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> the safety system, and (iv) multiple WLs, multiple SLs and multiple sublinks in each SL with <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> any sublink constituting <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> the associated SL and <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> all SLs before <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> any WL constituting <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> the safety system. The indicated probabilities derive from time-dependent temperatures in the WL/SL system and variability (i. e., aleatory uncertainty) in the temperatures at which the individual components of this system fail and are formally defined as multidimensional integrals. Numerical procedures based on quadrature (i. e., trapezoidal rule, Simpson's rule) and also on Monte Carlo techniques (i. e., simple random sampling, importance sampling) are described and illustrated for the evaluation of these integrals. Example uncertainty and sensitivity analyses for PLOAS involving the representation of uncertainty (i. e., epistemic uncertainty) with probability theory and also with evidence theory are presented...|$|R
5|$|Due to the <b>failures</b> <b>of</b> {{the ratings}} agencies, European {{regulators}} obtained new powers to supervise ratings agencies. With {{the creation of}} the European Supervisory Authority in January 2011 the EU set up a whole range of new financial regulatory institutions, including the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), which became the EU's single credit-ratings firm regulator. Credit-ratings companies have to comply with the new standards or will be denied operation on EU territory, says ESMA Chief Steven Maijoor.|$|E
5|$|FreeSpace 2 {{has many}} helpful {{features}} available. The player can target enemies attacking a protected objective or match speeds with them. Power can be shunted between shields, engines, and weapons, thereby allowing faster recharge of shields, afterburners, and weapons {{at the expense}} of other subsystems. These features can be ignored without any detrimental effects on gameplay. The mission parameters are not rigidly fixed, as there is an allowance for the <b>failures</b> <b>of</b> some primary objectives. When the mission is concluded, a post-mission briefing will be conducted to discuss the mission, and the performance of the player, before the next mission can be taken on.|$|E

5|$|The {{causes of}} Bolckow, Vaughan's failure included: poor {{decision-making}} {{in the period}} from 1900–1910 which delayed the introduction of improved steelmaking technology; optimistic belief in promises of funding made by the British government during the war, leading to excessive reliance on costly bank loans in 1918, instead of issuing share capital (as the firm later did in 1919 and 1923); failure to diversify into profitable steel products such as pipes, sheet steel and shipbuilding plates; and failure to invest in its own coal mines to provide enough for steel production, and for cash. There were thus both long-term and short-term <b>failures</b> <b>of</b> strategy.|$|E

However, video game sales in 1982 had slowed, and distributors who had ordered en masse in expectation of high turnover were left to simply return large quantities of unsold stock to Atari. As a result, the company soon found itself in possession of several million essentially useless video game cartridges, which it would be entirely unable to sell.|$|E

5|$|American {{economist}} and former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Paul Volcker {{has argued that}} the lack of global consensus on key issues threatens efforts to reform the global financial system. He has argued that quite possibly the most important issue is a unified approach to addressing <b>failures</b> <b>of</b> systemically important financial institutions, noting public taxpayers and government officials have grown disillusioned with deploying tax revenues to bail out creditors for the sake of stopping contagion and mitigating economic disaster. Volcker has expressed an array of potential coordinated measures: increased policy surveillance by the IMF and commitment from nations to adopt agreed-upon best practices, mandatory consultation from multilateral bodies leading to more direct policy recommendations, stricter controls on national qualification for emergency financing facilities (such as those offered by the IMF or by central banks), and improved incentive structures with financial penalties.|$|E
5|$|Coppola {{originally}} intended to write the screenplay himself, but due to {{his commitment to the}} filming of Gardens of Stone (1987), engaged Arnold Schulman who scripted Capra's A Hole in the Head (1959). Schulman eventually collaborated with David Seidler on the Tucker project. Subsequently, Coppola rewrote the Schulman and Seidler scripts, but an attempt to get a co-writing credit on the film was overruled by the Writers Guild of America, as an arbitration committee determined Coppola did not contribute enough to the script to warrant an on-screen writing credit. The filmmakers devised a $24 million production budget, but Universal Pictures, Walt Disney Pictures, TriStar Pictures and Paramount Pictures wanted Coppola and Lucas to lower it to $15 million. Distributors were also dubious about working with Lucas after the 1986 commercial and critical <b>failures</b> <b>of</b> both Labyrinth and Howard the Duck. Lucas decided to cover the $24 million budget himself, and pre-production proceeded.|$|E
