60|$|They went on {{towards the}} thresher, walking delicately among the flinty stubble, {{until they reached}} the edge of the {{whirling}} dust. Overhead the straw was rushing down through a haze of smoke. Below, half-naked men toiled savagely about the big machine. Steam was roaring from the engine, for the threshers were firing recklessly, and the thudding clank of the engine and hum of the clattering mill were almost deafening. There was a constant passing upwards of golden sheaves, a constant downward stream of straw, and the <b>dusty</b> <b>air</b> seemed filled with toiling men and kicking teams.|$|E
6000|$|And {{about this}} sordid-looking {{wilderness}} went {{a population that}} seemed at first as sordid. It was in no sense a tragic population. But it saw little of the sun, felt the wind but rarely, and so had a white, dull skin that looked degenerate and ominous to a West-end eye. It was not naked nor barefooted, but it wore cheap clothes that were tawdry when new, and speedily became faded, discoloured, dusty, and draggled. It was slovenly and almost wilfully ugly in its speech and gestures. And the food it ate was rough and coarse if abundant, the eggs it consumed [...] "tasted"--everything [...] "tasted"; its milk, its beer, its bread was degraded by base adulterations, its meat was hacked red stuff that hung in the <b>dusty</b> <b>air</b> until it was sold; east of the city Trafford could find no place where by his standards {{he could get a}} tolerable meal tolerably served. The entertainment of this eastern London was jingle, its religion clap-trap, its reading feeble and sensational rubbish without kindliness or breadth. And if this great industrial multitude was neither tortured nor driven nor cruelly treated--as the slaves and common people of other days have been--yet it was universally anxious, perpetually anxious about urgent small necessities and petty dissatisfying things....|$|E
6000|$|The {{return of}} the robin is {{commonly}} announced by the newspapers, like that of eminent or notorious people to a watering-place, as the first authentic notification of spring. And such his appearance in the orchard and garden undoubtedly is. But, {{in spite of his}} name of migratory thrush, he stays with us all winter, and I have seen him when the thermometer marked 15 degrees below zero of Fahrenheit, armed impregnably within,(1) like Emerson's Titmouse, and as cheerful as he. The robin has a bad reputation among people who do not value themselves less for being fond of cherries. There is, I admit, a spice of vulgarity in him, and his song is rather of the Bloomfield sort, too largely ballasted with prose. His ethics are of the Poor Richard school, and the main chance which calls forth all his energy is altogether of the belly. He never has these fine intervals of lunacy into which his cousins, the catbird and the mavis, are apt to fall. But for a' that and twice as muckle 's a' that, I would not exchange him for all the cherries that ever came out of Asia Minor. With whatever faults, he has not wholly forfeited that superiority which belongs to the children of nature. He has a finer taste in fruit than could be distilled from many successive committees of the Horticultural Society, and he eats with a relishing gulp not inferior to Dr. Johnson's. He feels and freely exercises his right of eminent domain. His is the earliest mess of green peas; his all the mulberries I had fancied mine. But if he get also the lion's share of the raspberries, he is a great planter, and sows those wild ones in the woods that solace the pedestrian, and give a momentary calm even to the jaded victims of the White Hills. He keeps a strict eye over one's fruit, and knows to a shade of purple when your grapes have cooked long enough in the sun. During the severe drought a few years ago the robins wholly vanished from my garden. I neither saw nor heard one for three weeks, meanwhile a small foreign grape-vine, rather shy of bearing, seemed to find the <b>dusty</b> <b>air</b> congenial, and, dreaming, perhaps of its sweet Argos across the sea, decked itself with a score or so of fair bunches. I watched them from day to day till they should have secreted sugar enough from the sunbeams, and at last made up my mind that I would celebrate my vintage the next morning. But the robins, too, had somehow kept note of them. They must have sent out spies, as did the Jews into the promised land, before I was stirring. When I went with my basket at least a dozen of these winged vintagers bustled out from among the leaves, and alighting on the nearest trees interchanged some shrill remarks about me of a derogatory nature. They had fairly sacked the vine. Not Wellington's veterans made cleaner work of a Spanish town; not Federals or Confederates were ever more impartial in the confiscation of neutral chickens. I was keeping my grapes a secret to surprise the fair Fidele with, but the robins made them a profounder secret to her than I had meant. The tattered remnant of a single bunch was all my harvest-home. How paltry it looked at the bottom of my basket,--as if a humming-bird had laid her egg in an eagle's nest! I could not help laughing; and the robins seemed to join heartily in the merriment. There was a native grape-vine close by, blue with its less refined abundance, but my cunning thieves preferred the foreign flavor. Could I tax them with want of taste? ...|$|E

40|$|Photovoltaic modules {{operating}} in field conditions exhibit {{a significant reduction}} in their power output due to dust accumulated on their surface. Depending on the amount of dust accumulated the reduction in peak power has been reported in the range of 5 - 15 %. The accumulated dust is linked to meteorological and environmental parameters such as humidity, precipitation, solar radiation, ambient temperature, <b>dusty</b> winds, <b>air</b> pollution, etc., but also to the location and surroundings of the installation and the period for which the PV modules have been left without cleaning. To reduce the effect of dust, research has been recently focused on coatings with self-cleaning properties that may be applied on PV glass surface. Also, coatings with spectral selective properties have been investigated to enhance PV performance. The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine the effect of a nanocoating with self-cleaning and anti-reflective properties on the performance of a PV module when applied on its glass surface.

40|$|Episodic {{events of}} both Saharan dust {{outbreaks}} and African Easterly Waves (AEWs) are observed to move westward over the eastern tropical Atlantic Ocean. The {{relationship between the}} warm, dry, and <b>dusty</b> Saharan <b>Air</b> Layer (SAL) on the nearby storms {{has been the subject}} of considerable debate. In this study, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model is used to investigate the radiative effect of dust on the development of AEWs during August and September, the months of maximum tropical cyclone activity, in years 2003 - 2007. The simulations show that dust radiative forcing enhances the convective instability of the environment. As a result, most AEWs intensify in the presence of a dust layer. The Lorenz energy cycle analysis reveals that the dust radiative forcing enhances the condensational heating, which elevates the zonal and eddy available potential energy. In turn, available potential energy is effectively converted to eddy kinetic energy, in which local convective overturning plays the primary role. The magnitude of the intensification effect depends on the initial environmental conditions, including moisture, baroclinity, and the depth of the boundary layer. We conclude that dust radiative forcing, albeit small, serves as a catalyst to promote local convection that facilitates AEW development...|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} the {{isolation}} ofanaerobes is one which the worker is inclined to approach with apologies. Every month or so a paper appears in some journal in which a new and expeditious procedure for the separation of anaerobes is. described. There are many successful ways of isolating anaerobes and it is unwise torecommend any one method above all others. I have succeeded with various arrangements; and wish in this paper to analyze some of the principles governing the isolation of these organisms and to explain {{a few of the}} pitfalls which have caused many workers to believe that the securing of "absolutely pure " anae-robic cultures is a difficult matter. With a little practice and with the exercise of much discrimination, anaerobes may be isolated as quickly, or nearly as quickly, as aerobes. Contamination occurs somewhat more frequently in anaerobic cultures than in those of aerobes. Contamination of originally pure cultures may be attributed to the following causes: (1) In-sufficiently sterilized media; anaerobe media are usually pasty and require more careful sterilization than others. (2) Inocu-lation transfer involving the exposure of the cotton plug and of the inoculum to the air. I have noted in working in London and near the sea in San Francisco, that the more <b>dusty</b> the <b>air,</b> the more frequent are contaminations, and the contamination flora may vary according to location.

5000|$|The State Library and Archives of Florida was {{a library}} of humble {{beginnings}} in the year 1845. Shortly after its admission as a state, the legislature began to realize the vital and crucial need to preserve, protect, and collect documents {{about the history of}} Florida. During that same legislative meeting, a statute was enacted naming the “Secretary of State” responsible for the care, collection, organization, and display of all “books and maps belonging to the state be collected together (Florida’s ‘State’ Library, 1909). It was also said in the statute that all such documents be cataloged as thoroughly as possible. However, this task was neglected, and as a result, the library and archives suffered (Florida’s ‘State’ Library, 1909). According to the Florida Historical Society’s article during the administration of Dr. Jno. L. Crawford, “a space in the upper corridor of the Capitol was partitioned off and furnished with shelving, and a large number of the (apparently) most valuable of the books, maps, etc., was deposited there; and many such occupied shelves are {{in the office of the}} Secretary” (Florida’s ‘State’ Library, 1909). However, when the Capital was remodeled in 1902, the commissioners intended to create space to accommodate the growing library but failed to do so. H. Clay Crawford Secretary of State at the time placed shelving on the either side of the basement walls and moved several books unarranged and uncatalogued where they were left in the <b>dusty</b> damp <b>air.</b> It is undetermined just how many documents of historical value lay untouched and neglected in the basement of the State Library, and it was not until some sixty years later that the library flourished as a historical point or reference for its patrons.|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{transport}} of mineral dust from its source regions in West Africa toward the developing tropical cyclone Helene (2006) and diagnoses the resulting properties of the air influencing the tropical cyclonegenesis. The model system COSMO-ART (Consortium for Small-Scale Modelling-Aerosols and Reactive Trace gases) in which the emission and transport of mineral dust {{as well as the}} radiation feedback are taken into account, was used. The emission of mineral dust between 9 and 14 September 2006 occurred in association with the relatively strong monsoon flow and northeasterly trade winds, with gust fronts of convective systems over land, and with the Atlantic inflow. Additionally, increased surface wind speed was linked to orographical effects at the Algerian Mountains, Atlas Mountains, and the Hoggar. The dust, as part of the Saharan air layer, is transported at low levels by the monsoon flow, the Harmattan, the northeasterly trade winds, and the monsoon trough, and is transported upward in the convergence zone between Harmattan and monsoon flow, in the baroclinic zone along the West African coastline, and by convection. At around 700  hPa the dust is transported by the African easterly jet. Dry and dust-free air is found to the north-northwest of the developing tropical depression due to descent in an anticyclone. Based on the model data, it was possible to distinguish between dry (from the anticyclone), dry and dusty (from the Harmattan and northeasterly trade winds), and <b>dusty</b> and moist <b>air</b> (from the monsoon flow and in the tropical depression due to convection) ...|$|R

50|$|The {{behavior}} of particles or metal filings {{in the presence}} of electricity or electric sparks was noticed in many experiments well before Edouard Branly's 1890 paper and even before there was proof of the theory of electromagnetism. In 1835 Swedish scientist Peter Samuel Munk noticed a change of resistance in a mixture of metal filings {{in the presence of}} spark discharge from a Leyden jar. In 1850 Pierre Guitard found that when <b>dusty</b> <b>air</b> was electrified, the particles would tend to collect in the form of strings. The idea that particles could react to electricity was used in English engineer Samuel Alfred Varley's 1866 lightning bridge, a lightning arrester attached to telegraph lines consisting of a piece of wood with two metal spikes extending into a chamber. The space was filled with powdered carbon that would not allow the low voltage telegraph signals to pass through but it would conduct and ground a high voltage lightning strike. In 1879 the Welsh scientist David Edward Hughes found that loose contacts between a carbon rod and two carbon blocks as well as the metallic granules in a microphone he was developing responded to sparks generated in a nearby apparatus. Temistocle Calzecchi-Onesti in Italy began studying the anomalous change in the resistance of thin metallic films and metal particles at Fermo/Monterubbiano. He found that copper filings between two brass plates would cling together, becoming conductive, when he applied a voltage to them. He also found that other types of metal filings would have the same reaction to electric sparks occurring at a distance, a phenomenon that he thought could be used for detecting lightning strikes. Calzecchi-Onesti's papers were published in il Nuovo Cimento in 1884, 1885 and 1886.|$|E
