I <b>have</b> <b>her</b> overdressed, I <b>have</b> <b>her</b> decidedly underdressed, but she is much the same girl. Very young men cannot have too many of her, but myself I am getting tired of her. I suppose it is the result of growing old.|$|R

5|$|Although the Boleyn {{family still}} held {{important}} {{positions on the}} Privy Council, Anne had many enemies, including the Duke of Suffolk. Even her own uncle, the Duke of Norfolk, had come to resent her attitude to her power. The Boleyns preferred France over the Emperor as a potential ally, but the King's favour had swung towards the latter (partly because of Cromwell), damaging the family's influence. Also opposed to Anne were supporters of reconciliation with Princess Mary (among them the former supporters of Catherine), who had reached maturity. A second annulment was now a real possibility, although it is commonly {{believed that it was}} Cromwell's anti-Boleyn influence that led opponents to look for a way of <b>having</b> <b>her</b> executed.|$|E
5|$|Armed with a gun, Neelambari {{reaches the}} temple where Chandru and Anitha are married. In anger, {{she tries to}} kill Padayappa. However, Padayappa saves her life when he {{prevents}} a bull from attacking her, {{while at the same}} time dodging the bullets she fires at him. Rather than live with the humiliation of knowing she was unsuccessful in avenging her father's death, as well as <b>having</b> <b>her</b> life saved by her enemy, Neelambari commits suicide, promising to take revenge on Padayappa in her next birth. Padayappa prays for her soul to be at peace and eventually attain salvation.|$|E
5|$|Emotions {{contains}} influences from mostly 1950s, 1960s and 1970s balladry and gospel, {{as well as}} her continued work of R and soul. The album, while {{praised by}} some as more mature and raw, failed to reach the critical or commercial heights of her debut effort, while selling far less and failed to introduce Carey into a different market. Following these events, Columbia decided to try to market Carey in a similar fashion to her debut, only <b>having</b> <b>her</b> produce a more commercial and radio-friendly album. Their plans were to tone down Carey's vocals, and soften the album's production, leaving a more contemporary pop/R record. Agreeing to the change, Carey and Afanasieff began writing and recording material for her third studio effort, Music Box.|$|E

5|$|In 1769, Day and his {{barrister}} friend, John Bicknell, chose Sabrina {{and another}} girl, Lucretia, from orphanages, and falsely declared {{they would be}} indentured to Day's friend Richard Lovell Edgeworth. Day took the girls to France to begin Rousseau's methods of education in isolation. After a short time, he returned to Lichfield with only Sabrina, having deemed Lucretia inappropriate for his experiment. He used unusual, eccentric, and sometimes cruel, techniques to try to increase her fortitude, such as firing blanks at her skirts, dripping hot wax on her arms, and <b>having</b> <b>her</b> wade into a lake fully dressed to test her resilience to cold water.|$|E
5|$|In the {{earliest}} {{forms of the}} story, the woman's pig-like appearance {{was the result of}} witchcraft. Following her wedding day, the pig-faced woman's new husband was granted the choice of <b>having</b> <b>her</b> appear beautiful to him but pig-like to others, or pig-like to him and beautiful to others. When her husband told her that the choice was hers, the enchantment was broken and her pig-like appearance vanished. These stories became particularly popular in England, and later in Ireland.|$|E

During this deployment, the carrier visited Subic Bay, where the RAN performed flight deck trials with S-2 Tracker anti-submarine aircraft and A-4 Skyhawk attack fighters. The success of the trials, along with the discovery that Melbourne was able to operate both aircraft with relatively minor modification, led the Australian Government to approve the purchase of these aircraft.|$|E

She then began training in Japan, learning the Japanese wrestling style, as well as Muay Thai, kickboxing, and boxing. She eventually signed a three-year deal with All Japan, which made her the first non-Japanese wrestler to do so. In addition, she worked for the TWA, feuding with Luna Vachon, whom she faced in a Hair vs Hair Mixed Tag Team match in September 1991. Miceli and her partner Eddie Gilbert defeated Vachon and Cactus Jack, which resulted in Vachon <b>having</b> <b>her</b> head shaved.|$|E

Greenwald maintains {{that it was her}} idea to have her head shaved, suggesting the idea to Vince McMahon months before the match occurred because she wanted to do something shocking at WrestleMania. Over the next few months, in storyline, she desperately tried to disguise her bald head using loose-fitting wigs. Later in 2004, Molly feuded with Stacy Keibler, overpowering Stacy on the mat and pinning her in three consecutive occasions, the last one occurring in a number one contender's match.|$|E
5|$|Production of the {{new version}} of the opening episode took place in what was to have been a three-week break for the cast between {{production}} blocks. Gina McKee was initially very concerned about <b>having</b> <b>her</b> character's early life story changed when she had already based elements of her later performance on the previously-established version. Eccleston was also unhappy about the sudden changes. However, McKee felt that the new version of episode one eventually made for a much stronger opening to the story.|$|E
