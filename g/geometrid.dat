5|$|The Albany Pine Bush {{is home to}} {{hundreds}} of species of Lepidoptera (moths), including over 40 Noctuidae considered to be pine barrens specialists. The most well-known species in the area is the Karner blue (Lycaeides melissa samuelis), discovered in the 1940s and named by the author Vladimir Nabokov. The butterfly {{is now on the}} Endangered Species List. Once found in large numbers throughout the grassy openings of the pine barrens, it is today extremely rare and found in a handful of sites. Attempts to reintroduce the butterfly focus on the food and host plant for its larvae – the wild blue lupine, which needs frequent forest fires to maintain its habitat. Other regionally rare butterflies include the dusted skipper (Atrytonopsis hianna), Henry's elfin (Incisalia henrici), frosted elfin (Incisalia irus), and Edward's hairstreak (Satyrium edwardsii). The inland barrens buck moth (Hemileuca maia) is a state-listed special concern animal; and other rare moths include the broad-lined catopyrrha (Catopyrrha coloraria), several noctuid moths (Apharetra purpurea, Chaetaglaea cerata, Chytonix sensilis, Macrochilo bivittata, and Zanclognatha martha), bird dropping moth (Cerma cora), and a <b>geometrid</b> moth (Itame). The Albarufan dagger moth was last seen in the Pine Bush in 1983 and is presumed locally extinct.|$|E

25|$|Other moths (Noctuids, <b>Geometrids,</b> Pyralids, for example) fly {{slowly and}} {{settle on the}} flower. They do not require as much nectar as the fast-flying hawk moths, and the flowers tend to be small (though they may be {{aggregated}} in heads).|$|R

The forewings lack a tornal spot. The hindwings are whitish grey with dark striae and a small discal spot.|$|R

They tend to blend into the background, often with intricate, wavy patterns on their wings. In some species, females have reduced wings (e.g. winter moth and fall cankerworm).|$|R

40|$|Light traps {{are used}} to make inferences about local macro-moth communities, but very {{little is known about}} the {{efficiency}} with which they attract moths from varying distances, and how this may differ among families. We released 731 marked individuals, from three of the most common and species-rich macro-moth families, at several distances from low-wattage actinic light traps in open and woodland habitat. Logistic regression showed family-specific sampling areas: erebids were attracted from up to 27 m, <b>geometrids</b> from up to 23 m, and noctuids from up to 10 m from the light source, with these distances corresponding to a 5 % recapture rate. Sampling size was also family-specific: a maximum of 55 % of erebids, 15 % of <b>geometrids,</b> and 10 % of noctuids were predicted to be trapped when flying near (0 – 1 m) light traps. Our study demonstrates that weak light traps: (i) have remarkably local sampling ranges, resulting in samples that are highly representative of the local habitat, and (ii) attract small, and family-specific proportions of individuals within these ranges. We suggest that the local sampling ranges of weak light traps make them excellent tools to monitor nocturnal macro-moth communities. As trap efficiency differs among macro-moth families, care must be taken in relating the abundance of the sample to absolute local abundance. Frequent sampling can provide adequate data on relative temporal change in the local macro-moth fauna, however...|$|R

5000|$|Among {{the more}} {{important}} moth pollinator groups are the hawk moths of the family Sphingidae. Their behavior is similar to hummingbirds, i.e., using rapid wing beats to hover in front of flowers. Most hawk moths are nocturnal or crepuscular, so moth-pollinated flowers (e.g., Silene latifolia [...] ) tend to be white, night-opening, large, and showy with tubular corollae and a strong, sweet scent produced in the evening, night, or early morning. A lot of nectar is produced to fuel the high metabolic rates needed to power their flight. Other moths (e.g., noctuids, <b>geometrids,</b> pyralids) fly slowly and settle on the flower. They do not require as much nectar as the fast-flying hawk moths, and the flowers tend to be small (though they may be aggregated in heads).|$|R

50|$|This {{species has}} {{recently}} gained attention {{due to the}} discovery of its use of chemical mimicry to avoid predation by ants. The larva of this species, in common with many other <b>geometrids,</b> uses visual mimicry, strongly resembling a twig of its host plant. Recent studies have shown that it also uses chemical mimicry, storing chemicals from its food in its cuticle so that ants are largely unable to distinguish it from a twig, even after making contact with their highly sensitive antennae. Ants foraging for prey have been observed walking along the moth larvae, oblivious of their presence. Utilizing the chemicals directly from diet is advantageous as the larva will always be a chemical match to the plant it is actually feeding on (the species is highly polyphagous - see below). It has been predicted that, with further study, other species will also be shown use this form of defence.|$|R
40|$|Although climatic forcing {{has been}} {{suspected}} {{to be the}} most common cause of spatial population synchrony owing to the Moran effect, it has proved difficult to disentangle the impact of climate from other possible causes of synchrony based on population survey data. Nonlinear population responses to climatic variation may be a part of this difficulty, but they can also provide an opportunity to highlight the climate impacts through targeted survey designs. In particular, when species distribution ranges encompass consistent spatial gradients in climate (e. g. according to latitude or altitude), such gradients can be strategically included in the spatial design of population surveys as to facilitate comparisons of spatial synchrony patterns across and along the gradient. In that case, we predict that nonlinear impacts of climatic variation on population growth rates will result in anisotropic (direction specific) synchrony patterns in the sense that synchrony will drop faster with distance along the climatic gradient than across it. We provide an empirical case study to exemplify survey design and analyses. Of two sympatric species of <b>geometrids,</b> inhabiting an altitudinal gradient in subarctic birch forest, one (Operophtera brumata L.) showed anisotropic synchrony consistent with a strongly nonlinear sensitivity to climatic variation, whereas the other (Epirrita autumnata Bkh.) did not.

Males of the sympatric species Tephrina arenacearia Hbn.

40|$|Nedavna otkrića gljivičnog patogena Entomophaga maimaiga Humber, Shimazu & R. S. Soper u susjednim istočnim i sjevernim zemljama Europe, posebice u Hrvatskoj, te pojavnost progradacija populacija gubara (Lymantria dispar L.) u pojedinim područjima Bosne i Hercegovine, privukla su pozornost istraživača na mogućnost prisutnosti ovog patogena u lokalnim populacijama gubara. Interes istraživača usmjerio se na lokacije zabilježenih mjesta progradacije gubara koja se nalaze u sjevernim dijelovima Bosne i Hercegovine. S obzirom na malu zračnu udaljenost tih lokacija s lokacijama masovne pojavnosti patogena E. maimaiga u Republici Hrvatskoj i Srbiji, hipoteza je bila provjeriti mogućnost prelaska patogena duž graničnog područja rijeke Save i Drine te ulazak u Bosnu i Hercegovinu. Istraživanje je obavljeno početkom srpnja 2013. godine. Odabrano je pet lokacija u kojima je zabilježeno stanje progradacije populacije gubara, te uočen značajni mortalitet larvi gubara od nepoznatog uzročnika. Uzorci larvalnih kadavera sakupljeni su sa stabala na visini od 0, 5 – 1, 5 m iznad razine tla. Sakupljani su samo stariji larvalni stadiji (L 4 – L 6) zbog kasnijeg vremenskog razdoblja uzorkovanja, te analizirani u Laboratoriju za patologiju drveća Šumarskog fakulteta Sveučilišta u Zagrebu. Kod svih pet uzoraka tkiva uginulih larvi s pet različitih lokacija, pronađene su azigospore ili konidije (konidio­spore) i azigospore vrste E. maimaiga. Tip spora koji će se formirati nakon smrti domaćina ovisi o patogenu i načinu infekcije, faktorima vezanim za domaćina i okolišnim uvjetima. Makroskopski simptomi napada gljive E. maimaiga bili su jasno vidljivi na terenu, zajedno s nekim znacima larvalnog mortaliteta od strane poliedrije (LdMNPV), međutim u znatno manjem obujmu. Prisutno je bilo vrlo malo znakova parazitoidnog mortaliteta, ali sa značajnom prisutnošću tipičnih predatora gubara kao što je Calosoma sycophanta L., koji je bio prisutan u sta­diju ličinke i imaga. The fungal {{pathogen}} Entomophaga maimaiga Humber, Shimazu & R. S. Soper (Enthomophthorales: Entomophthoraceae) {{was found}} in the north-east Bosnia and Herzegovina populations of Lymantria dispar L. (Lepidoptera: Erebidae) in summer 2013 at 5 localities (Figure 1, Table 1). Since the first introduction of this pathogen in Bulgaria in 1999 several southeastern European countries confirmed its presence in subsequent years. Recent findings of this pathogen in the neighbouring countries, especially in Croatia and Serbia, and also regarding to the progradation of L. dispar populations in some parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina, attracted the attention of the researchers on the possibility of finding this highly selective fungal pathogen. The sampling localities were selected based on pre-collected data of reported L. dispar population progradation, but also to the relative geographical vicinity regarding the new Croatian positive sites with E. maimaiga fungal pathogen. Large areas were aerially sprayed with a Bacillus thuringiensis kurstaki – based bacterial insecticide and larval development was closely inspected in the field. In the last 70 years, from the first reported outbreak of L. dispar in Bosnia and Herzegovina, many outbreaks have been reported, causing the supstantial economical and ecological damage in forestry but also in agriculture production. Biological insecticide based on the Bacillus thuringiensis kurstaki, commonly used for the suppression of the local populations of L. dispar, does not always produce the desired impact. Consequently, the highly selective, host specific, fungal pathogen that could be put in use as a biological control agent of the L. dispar populations is found to be very interesting for both science and professional application thus deminishing the economical and ecological negative feedback of this indigenous defoliator. The research was carried out during July 2013 throughout the north-east part of Bosnia and Herzegovina where gypsy moth populations continued an ongoing outbreak. From five selected localities, where excessive mortality was observed, larval cadavers were sampled from tree trunks 0, 5 – 1, 5 m above the ground. Only older larval stages (L 4 – L 6) were sampled due to the late sampling period. Cadavers were inspected, and larval tissue samples were prepared under the stereo microscope (LEICA Leitz MZ 8) and light stereo microscope (Motic SMZ – 168 TLED). Process was digitaly documented with Olympus SP – 500 UZ digital camera equipped with the Olympus QuickPHOTO CAMERA 2. 3 digital imaging software. Larval tissue samples were inspected under light microscope (Olympus BX 53) and images were recorded by digital camera Motic MoticamPro 252 A. Measurements of azygospores and conidia (conidiospores) were made via digital imaging software Motic Images Plus 2. 0 and Motic Images Advanced 3. 2. associated with a compound microscope. Microscopic analysis of the dead tissue larvae, in all five locations, confirmed both conidia and azygospores or azygospores only, of the E. maimaiga species. Spore dimensions were as follows: pear-shaped conidia crosswise 25, 7 – 35, 1 µm and 34, 6 – 43, 7 µm lenghtwise; azygospores 32, 2 – 47, 9 µm in diameter (Figure 2, Figure 3). The type of spores (conidia or azygospores or both) that will form after host death is determined by the pathogen and the type of host infection, host-related factors and environmental conditions. Macroscopic symptoms of E. maimaiga attack were easily recognizable on the tree trunks along with some signs of larval mortality caused by Lymantria dispar multicapsid nuclear polihedrosis virus (LdMNPV) (Figure 4). There were very few signs of parasitoid mortality, but unlike in the Croatian sites (Hrašovec et al. 2013), with a great abundant presence of gypsy moth predators like Calosoma sycophanta L. (Figure 5), which could be an indicator that the pathogen has emerged when the L. dispar population was already starting its descent into a retrogradation phase. Just like in the Croatian localities where the sampling took place (Hrašovec et al. 2013), dead larvae were hanging from the tree trunks head down all through the sites and no living larva or viable pupa could be found in the area. Based on the field collections and microscopic analysis, entomopathogenic fungus E. maimaiga, a pathogen of L. dispar introduced on the European continent, has been confirmed in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Extensive monitoring of the fungal pathogen in the following years will give us the information on pathogen spatial spread, its speed and the possibility for establishing its permanent position among the other local indigenous species. Nevertheless, there are some concerns whether E. maimaiga may show some direct and indirect impacts on non-targeted and beneficial organisms in the future, or change the basic community structure of folivore insect guilds on oaks, maybe resulting in increasing populations of other defoliating insect groups such as tortricids, <b>geometrids</b> and sawflies. These concerns will demand more scientific attention in the future...|$|R
