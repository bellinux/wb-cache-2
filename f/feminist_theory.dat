5|$|<b>Feminist</b> <b>theory</b> is the {{extension}} of feminism into theoretical or philosophical fields. It encompasses work {{in a variety of}} disciplines, including anthropology, sociology, economics, women's studies, literary criticism, art history, psychoanalysis and philosophy. <b>Feminist</b> <b>theory</b> aims to understand gender inequality and focuses on gender politics, power relations, and sexuality. While providing a critique of these social and political relations, much of <b>feminist</b> <b>theory</b> also focuses on the promotion of women's rights and interests. Themes explored in <b>feminist</b> <b>theory</b> include discrimination, stereotyping, objectification (especially sexual objectification), oppression, and patriarchy.|$|E
5|$|<b>Feminist</b> <b>theory,</b> {{which emerged}} from feminist movements, aims to {{understand}} the nature of gender inequality by examining women's social roles and lived experience; it has developed theories in a variety of disciplines in order to respond to issues concerning gender.|$|E
5|$|<b>Feminist</b> <b>theory</b> {{can also}} be seen at play in Stowe's book, with the novel as a {{critique}} of the patriarchal nature of slavery. For Stowe, blood relations rather than paternalistic relations between masters and slaves formed the basis of families. Moreover, Stowe viewed national solidarity as an extension of a person's family, thus feelings of nationality stemmed from possessing a shared race. Consequently, she advocated African colonization for freed slaves and not amalgamation into American society.|$|E

5|$|Dworkin {{authored}} ten {{books of}} radical <b>feminist</b> <b>theory</b> and numerous speeches and articles, each designed to assert {{the presence of}} and denounce institutionalized and normalized harm against women. She {{became one of the}} most influential writers and spokeswomen of American radical feminism during the late 1970s and the 1980s. She characterized pornography as an industry of damaging objectification and abuse, not merely a fantasy realm. She discussed prostitution as a system of exploitation, and intercourse as a key site of subordination in patriarchy. Her analysis and writing influenced and inspired the work of contemporary feminists, such as Catharine MacKinnon, Gloria Steinem, John Stoltenberg, Nikki Craft, Susan Cole, and Amy Elman.|$|E
5|$|In fact, process {{theology}} {{is difficult to}} define because process theologians are so diverse and transdisciplinary in their views and interests. John B. Cobb, Jr. is a process theologian who has also written books on biology and economics. Roland Faber and Catherine Keller integrate Whitehead with poststructuralist, postcolonialist, and <b>feminist</b> <b>theory.</b> Charles Birch was both a theologian and a geneticist. Franklin I. Gamwell writes on theology and political theory. In Syntheism - Creating God in The Internet Age, futurologists Alexander Bard and Jan Söderqvist repeatedly credit Whitehead for the process theology they see {{rising out of the}} participatory culture expected to dominate the digital era.|$|E
5|$|Male {{participation}} in feminism is encouraged by feminists and {{is seen as}} an important strategy for achieving full societal commitment to gender equality. Many male feminists and pro-feminists are active in both women's rights activism, <b>feminist</b> <b>theory,</b> and masculinity studies. However, some argue that while male engagement with feminism is necessary, it is problematic because of the ingrained social influences of patriarchy in gender relations. The consensus today in feminist and masculinity theories is that both genders can and should cooperate to achieve the larger goals of feminism. It has been proposed that, in large part, this can be achieved through considerations of women's agency.|$|E

3000|$|<b>Feminist</b> <b>theories</b> are {{relevant}} to this study because they illustrate how women are marginalized in the business environment and economic dialogue. <b>Feminist</b> <b>theories</b> advocate for {{the understanding of the}} nature of gender inequality in the society due to patriarchy ideology and using that knowledge to better women’s lives. The theories reveal where stereotypes and subjective perceptual variables come from and enrich our understanding of how these exert a fundamental influence on women’s entrepreneurial tendency and account for much of difference in entrepreneurial activity between the sexes (Jennings and Brush 2013). Socio-cultural norms have contributed to the creation of the unique barrier for women entrepreneurs to access assets, education and gendered activity expectations among the sexes. Jennings and Brush (2013) identify four substantive contributions of <b>feminist</b> <b>theories</b> to the field of women entrepreneurship: i) entrepreneurship is a gendered phenomenon, ii) entrepreneurship is embedded in families, iii) entrepreneurial activity can result from necessity as well as an opportunity, and iv) entrepreneurs pursue goals beyond economic gain. Therefore, the adoption of a feminist approach to the field of entrepreneurship is important in order to better women’s lives.

25|$|The {{focus on}} {{personal}} acceptance is mirrored {{in much of}} the literature surrounding choosing not to reproduce. Many early books were grounded in <b>feminist</b> <b>theory</b> and largely sought to dispel the idea that womanhood and motherhood were necessarily the same thing, arguing, for example, that childfree people face not only social discrimination but political discrimination as well.|$|E
25|$|From the 1970s onwards, psychoanalytical {{ideas that}} have been arising {{in the field of}} French {{feminism}} have gained a decisive influence on <b>feminist</b> <b>theory.</b> Feminist psychoanalysis deconstructed the phallic hypotheses regarding the Unconscious.

25|$|The term postmodernism {{has been}} applied both to the era {{following}} modernity and {{to a host of}} movements within that era (mainly in art, music, and literature) that reacted against tendencies in modernism. Postmodernism includes skeptical critical interpretations of culture, literature, art, philosophy, history, linguistics, economics, architecture, fiction, <b>feminist</b> <b>theory,</b> and literary criticism. Postmodernism is often associated with schools of thought such as deconstruction and post-structuralism, as well as philosophers such as Jean-François Lyotard, Jacques Derrida, and Frederic Jameson.|$|E

25|$|Susan A. Mann an eco-feminist and {{professor}} of sociological and <b>feminist</b> <b>theory</b> considers the roles women played in these activisms to be the starter for ecofeminism in later centuries. Mann associates the beginning of ecofeminism not with feminists but with women of different race and class backgrounds who made connections among gender, race, class and environmental issues. This ideal is upheld through the notion that in activist and theory circles marginalized groups must {{be included in the}} discussion. In early environmental and women's movements, issues of varying races and classes were often separated.|$|E
25|$|However, some gay {{men such as}} Andrea Dworkin's husband John Stoltenberg {{are also}} {{critical}} of sadomasochism and pornography and agree with the radical feminist and lesbian feminist criticisms of these practices. Stoltenberg wrote that sadomasochism eroticizes both violence and powerlessness. The gay pro-feminist author Christopher N. Kendall wrote the book Gay Male Pornography: An Issue Of Sex Discrimination, advancing the idea that gay male pornography involved sex discrimination and should be banned under Canada's equality laws.

Second, <b>feminist</b> legal <b>theory</b> is dedicated to changing women's status through a reworking of the law and its approach to gender.|$|R
