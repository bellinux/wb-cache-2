[...] "Now, shall I tell you how I came to know that?" [...] she asked, poising a glace cherry on her <b>dessert</b> <b>fork</b> in front of her. [...] "Shall I explain my trick, like the conjurers?" ...|$|E

6000|$|Even {{the oldest}} and most serious men in town {{admitted}} that in talking to her they were aware of a grasp, a reach, a depth that surprised them. Thus old Judge Longerstill, who talked to her at dinner for an hour on the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission, felt sure from the way in which she looked up in his face at intervals and said, [...] "How interesting!" [...] that she had the mind of a lawyer. And Mr. Brace, the consulting engineer, who showed her on the table-cloth at <b>dessert</b> with three <b>forks</b> and a spoon the method in which the overflow of the spillway of the Gatun Dam is regulated, felt assured, from the way she leaned her face on her hand sideways and said, [...] "How extraordinary!" [...] that she had the brain of an engineer. Similarly foreign visitors to the social circles of the city were delighted with her. Viscount FitzThistle, who explained to Dulphemia for half an hour the intricacies of the Irish situation, was captivated at the quick grasp she showed by asking him at the end, without a second's hesitation, [...] "And which are the Nationalists?" ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Dessert</b> <b>fork</b> (alternatively, pudding fork/cake fork in Great Britain): Any {{of several}} {{different}} special types of forks designed to eat desserts, {{such as a}} pastry fork. They usually have only three tines and are smaller than standard dinner forks. The leftmost tine may be widened so as to provide an edge with which to cut (though it is never sharpened).|$|E
50|$|Tables {{are often}} set {{with two or}} more forks, meant {{to be used for}} {{different}} courses; for example, a salad fork, a meat fork, and a <b>dessert</b> <b>fork.</b> Some institutions wishing to give an impression of high formality set places with many different forks for meals of several courses, although many etiquette authorities regard this as vulgar and prefer that the appropriate cutlery be brought in with each course.|$|E
5000|$|A {{finger bowl}} is {{a bowl of}} water used for rinsing one's fingers after the last course of a formal meal served à la russe. It is {{typically}} brought to {{the table at the}} time of the dessert course, arriving atop the dessert plate, with a linen doily between the plate and the bowl and with the <b>dessert</b> <b>fork</b> and spoon on the plate. If a separate fruit course is to follow dessert, the finger bowl should be brought in at that time, with the fruit fork and knife. Alternatively, a full array of dishes can be brought out at once, with the finger bowl atop the dessert plate with its fork and spoon, and the dessert plate atop the fruit plate, with doilies between each dish; in this type of service, the fruit fork and knife are brought out after the dessert plates and silver are cleared. [...] "Where there are plenty of servants, the finger bowl may not come in on the fruit plate but may be brought on its own serving plate, replacing the used fruit plate before the guests leave the table for coffee." [...] A glass ornament, flower, flower petals, lemon slice, sprig of mint or other decoration is often floated in it.|$|E
