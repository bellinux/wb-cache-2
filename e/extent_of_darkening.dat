Tasman) and a very low PPO durum wheat (Triticum durum cv. Kamilaroi). Over 24 h non-PPO darkening occurred {{across a range of}} pH 3. 5 - 10. 5, and in Tasman this was overlaid by darkening from PPO activity. The rate <b>of</b> <b>darkening</b> in YAN was separated into two main time periods, 0 - 4 and 4 - 24 h. The first 4 h <b>of</b> <b>darkening</b> was further divided into two stages using a composite first-order rate equation. Several specific inhibitors that partially inhibited non-PPO darkening were identified. These inhibitors, as well as the PPO inhibitors SHAM and tropolone, were used to analyze YAN <b>darkening.</b> The rate <b>of</b> the early stage <b>of</b> <b>darkening</b> was not altered by any inhibitors used; however, the magnitude <b>of</b> <b>darkening</b> was reduced by inhibitors specific for non-PPO darkening. Both the rate and <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> non-PPO <b>darkening</b> <b>of</b> the second stage <b>of</b> <b>darkening</b> were decreased in Tasman and Kamilaroi by inhibitors specific for non-PPO darkening, whereas both PPO inhibitors only decreased darkening in Tasman. The second and third stages <b>of</b> <b>darkening</b> showed similar characteristics. The third stage <b>of</b> <b>darkening</b> was examined in YAN made from Kamilaroi over a temperature range from - 4 to 65 degrees C. It followed an Arrhenius relationship indicating non-PPO darkening during this stage was nonenzymatic. The inhibitor data suggested that the reactive component(s) was/were present in a reasonably high concentration(s) and that the soluble protein fraction was involved in the non-PPO darkening process.

40|$|Hα {{equivalent}} widths and UBV magnitudes {{are calculated}} for Be star disk models that grow in size and/or density with time. We show that these simple models {{are consistent with}} the known Be star classes of positive and inverse correlations between long-term variations in Hα and V magnitude as identified by Harmanec. We support the conclusion of Harmanec that the distinction is controlled by the inclination of the disk to the line of sight. We demonstrate that the strength of these correlations, particularly those of an inverse correlation where the system becomes fainter as the Hα emission strength grows, is strongly influenced by the scale height of the inner Be star disk and the <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> the gravitational <b>darkening</b> <b>of</b> the central B star due to rapid rotation. This dependence may allow coordinated spectroscopic and photometric observations to better constrain these poorly known Be star parameters.

40|$|Darkening {{in yellow}} {{alkaline}} noodles (YAN) was examined over a 24 h period in noodles made from 4 wheat varieties, including varieties with {{different levels of}} polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity, selected to cover a range of protein levels. Noodles {{were made in the}} presence and absence of the PPO inhibitor, tropolone. The darkening was divided into two time periods: 0 - 4 h and 4 - 24 h. The first four hours was described by a composite rate equation, and this period was subdivided into two stages. The rate <b>of</b> <b>darkening</b> in the first stage was independent of both protein concentration and PPO activity. The amount <b>of</b> <b>darkening</b> (c), however, was highly dependent on protein concentration during this stage (-tropolone, r = 0. 902; +tropolone, r = 0. 905), but independent of PPO activity. The first stage darkening was a zero order reaction where additional protein does not increase the reaction rate, but when the protein supply has been depleted, the reaction stops. The rate <b>of</b> <b>darkening</b> during the first stage (k'(1) = 5. 6 +/- 1. 0) was similar to the rate of change in the protein structure (k'(1) = 6. 5 +/- 1. 3) as measured using the amide II band by infrared spectroscopy. This suggested that the first stage <b>of</b> <b>darkening</b> represents changes in light reflectance and absorbance caused by changes in hydrogen bonding rather than changes in covalent bonding. During the second stage <b>of</b> <b>darkening,</b> both the rate (k'(2)) and amount <b>of</b> <b>darkening</b> (DeltaL*(4 h-c)) were significantly correlated with protein concentration (-tropolone, r = 0. 465; +tropolone, r = 0. 813), {{and in the absence of}} tropolone the amount <b>of</b> <b>darkening</b> was increased by PPO activity. The amount <b>of</b> <b>darkening</b> (DeltaL*(24 h- 4 h)) during the second time period (4 - 24 h) (or third stage) was significantly correlated in the presence of tropolone (r = 0. 375) and in the absence of tropolone (r = 0. 428) with protein concentration. However, compared with earlier stages the response <b>of</b> non-PPO <b>darkening</b> during the third stage to change in protein concentration was smaller. Protein oxidation, or more specifically oxidation of tyrosine groups within the protein, appears to be the main mechanism involved in non-PPO darkening in YAN during the second and third stages with glutenin being the main reactant. Albumin and globulin are important substrates for PPO. No differences in darkening were detected in YAN made from the four varieties in the presence of tropolone; however, differences in YAN darkening were observed for the second and third stages due to site and year variation.

40|$|In the {{framework}} of the Sobolev approximation, the effects <b>of</b> limb <b>darkening</b> <b>of</b> the stellar core on the formation of line profiles in rapidly expanding envelopes are investigated. For the case of outward-accelerating envelopes, it is shown that the P Cygni profiles, calculated with and without limb darkening, do appear almost identical as long as the size of the envelope remains large with respect to the radius of the star. As the <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> the envelope decreases, the resulting profiles are found to differ appreciably close to the line center. When considering outward-decelerating (or equivalently inward-accelerating) envelopes, calculations with the limb darkening effects reveal that the P Cygni profiles are more strongly affected than in the previous case. These effects are specially important in the blue wing and {{near the center of the}} resulting line profiles, irrespective of the size of the envelope. Peer reviewe...|$|R
