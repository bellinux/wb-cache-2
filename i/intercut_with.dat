5|$|In 1300 or shortly after, Villani {{began working}} on the Cronica, which was divided into twelve books; the first six deal with the largely legendary history of Florence, {{starting}} at conventionally biblical times {{with the story of}} the Tower of Babel up to the year 1264. The second phase, in six books, covered the history from 1264 until his own time, {{all the way up to}} 1346. He outlined the events in his Cronica in year-to-year accounts; for this he has gained criticism over the years for writing in an episodic manner lacking a unifying theme or point of view. He wrote his Cronica in the vernacular language rather than Latin, the language of the educated elite. His chronicles are <b>intercut</b> <b>with</b> historical episodes reported just as he heard them, sometimes with little interpretation. This often led to historical inaccuracies in his work, especially in the biographies of historical or contemporary people living outside of Florence (even with well-known monarchs).|$|E

50|$|While the ad's creators {{claimed they}} had {{meant for the}} voiceover lines to refer to Chrétien's {{policies}} and ethics, the <b>intercutting</b> <b>with</b> images of his face focusing on his facial deformity were interpreted by many as an attack on Chrétien's appearance and health condition. The Liberal Party encouraged its members to call media outlets about the ad, an effort led by Roméo LeBlanc. Because of this, PC campaign advisor Hugh Segal claimed that the backlash following the ad was mostly manufactured.|$|R

5000|$|Believing {{they had}} {{no other way to}} keep the Liberals from winning a majority, Gregg and Tory decided to launch a series of {{commercials}} attacking Chrétien. While the ad's creators claim they had meant for the line [...] "I would be very embarrassed if he became Prime Minister of Canada" [...] to refer to Chrétien's policies and ethics, the <b>intercutting</b> <b>with</b> images of his face and its facial deformity (caused by Bell's palsy) were interpreted by many as an attack on Chrétien's appearance. The ad quickly received widespread attention as the Liberal war room under Roméo LeBlanc immediately contacted media outlets. This generated a severe backlash from all sides of the spectrum, including some PC candidates, and Campbell ordered them off the air.|$|R
