Countries with policies include Japan, Taiwan, Indonesia, and South Korea. The practice is controversial due to concerns that it bolsters the perception of women as weak, inefficient workers, as well as concerns that it <b>is</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>to</b> men.|$|E

25|$|In {{the later}} Legend of Atrahasis, Enlil, {{the king of}} the gods, sets out to {{eliminate}} humanity, whose noise is disturbing his rest. He successively sends drought, famine and plague to eliminate humanity, but Enki thwarts his half-brother's plans by teaching Atrahasis how to counter these threats. Each time, Atrahasis asks the population to abandon worship of all gods, except the one responsible for the calamity, and this seems to shame them into relenting. Humans, however, proliferate a fourth time. Enraged, Enlil convenes a Council of Deities and gets them to promise not to tell humankind that he plans their total annihilation. Enki does not tell Atrahasis directly, but speaks to him in secret via a reed wall. He instructs Atrahasis to build a boat in order to rescue his family and other living creatures from the coming deluge. After the seven-day Deluge, the flood hero frees a swallow, a raven and a dove in an effort to find if the flood waters have receded. Upon landing, a sacrifice is made to the gods. Enlil is angry his will has been thwarted yet again, and Enki is named as the culprit. Enki explains that Enlil <b>is</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>to</b> punish the guiltless, and the gods institute measures to ensure that humanity does not become too populous in the future. This {{is one of the oldest}} of the surviving Middle Eastern Deluge myths.|$|E

500|$|In 1960, the London cast {{recording}} was released. [...] According to Hischak, {{the individual}} performers do not sing {{as well as}} the New York cast; the London recording's strong points are the nightclub numbers. [...] The 1961 album from the film uses a larger orchestra and, according to Hischak, has a fuller sound than the Broadway recording. [...] It features dubbing by the opera singer Marilyn Horne ("Love, Look Away") and band singer B. J. Baker (for Linda Low's songs). [...] A cast album for Hwang's revision was released in 2002 featuring strong performances from Lea Salonga as Mei-li and Jose Llana as Wang Ta. [...] This was nominated for a Grammy, though it did not win. [...] Hischak notes that it <b>is</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>to</b> compare the later version with its earlier predecessors, as Hwang's version [...] "has some of the dark corners and richness of a musical play".|$|E

In addition, a string of organizations joined the boycott, cancelling reservations to hold conferences and other high-profile events at the establishment; travel industry firms likewise signed on to a boycott of all Dorchester Collection hotels. Others, including Russell Crowe and Kim Kardashian, have spoken out against the boycott. Crowe stated that despite his disapproval of the new laws in Brunei, it <b>is</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>to</b> punish the hardworking employees of the hotel. Similarly, Kardashian published a blog post voicing her criticism of the boycott and expressing her sympathies for the hotel workers. HR Magazine said that the protests are [...] "misguided" [...] and will not affect the government policy of Brunei when the Dorchester Collection's annual revenue is $300 million while the BIA has over $30 billion in assets from oil and gas.|$|E
500|$|Bret Fetzer of Amazon.com {{wrote that}} [...] "it's best to {{approach}} this season {{as if it were}} a completely new series". He felt that it <b>is</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>to</b> compare the quality of this season to that of past seasons because [...] "the series' previous heights were so very high". However, he called the year [...] "uneven", because episodes would range from putting [...] "Andy into Michael Scott-ish situations" [...] to [...] "seek out new angles on the well-established web of interpersonal conflicts". This vacillation between extremes meant that the episodes [...] "sometimes" [...] work. Matt Zoller Seitz of Salon considered the post-Michael Scott era of The Office [...] "warmer and more reflective". He also praised the decision of Andy as a manager, and he highlighted Ed Helms and Craig Robinson's performances in [...] "Lotto", arguing that they represented the [...] "subtlest, deepest acting to date [...] ". He also selected [...] "Lotto" [...] as the best episode of the season. Hank Stuever of The Washington Post named the series the tenth best series of 2011, specifically praising the actors' ability in [...] "Mrs. California" [...] to deliver cringe humor without Carell. TV Guide named it an honorable mention on their list of the best TV shows of 2011. Price Peterson from TV.com called the series [...] "still one of the best shows on TV" [...] and argued that, while [...] "Season 8 definitely wasn't the show's best", the season [...] "sneaked in some genuinely great jokes, new characters, and affecting plotlines." [...] Despite the lackluster reviews many of the episodes received, many critics praised Ellie Kemper's performance as Erin Hannon. McNutt noted that [...] "regardless of how down I was on this or any other episode, Ellie Kemper really has been tremendous all season." [...] In addition, Kemper's performance in the episodes [...] "Spooked," [...] "Christmas Wishes," [...] "Pool Party," [...] and [...] "Special Project," [...] in particular, were praised by critics.|$|E

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has proposed educational reform in New Jersey that pressures teachers not only to [...] "teach to the test," [...] but also have their students perform at the potential cost of their salary and job security. The reform calls for performance-based pay that depends on students' performances on standardized tests and their educational gains. However, students vary based on cognitive, developmental, and psychological abilities, so it <b>is</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>to</b> teachers with students with difficulties on the test.|$|E

In 2010, during a public spat between actor Thilakan and Association of Malayalam Movie Artists (AMMA) regarding a labour issue, social critic Sukumar Azhikode supported Thilakan and criticized leading Malayalam stars, urging them to step aside since they are old, specially mentioning Mohanlal, that he is [...] "a hypocrite who hid his advancing age to act with younger heroines". Mohanlal responded that Azhikode might be having [...] "hallucinations" [...] and is ignoring it as a joke. This led to further personal remarks by Azhikode against Mohanlal. The two later sorted things out. Azhikode watched Mohanlal's Pranayam in theatre and praised his performance, Mohanlal also visited him in his death bed in 2012.|$|E
2500|$|No kill shelters {{provide more}} room than other shelters.Although proponents of no-kill make the {{distinction}} between euthanasia and killing, some still assert that the term [...] "no-kill" [...] <b>is</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>to</b> employees of traditional shelters. The term has also caused a divide in the animal welfare community beyond ideology as it differentiates between no-kill and [...] "kill" [...] shelters, an accusation that cast a bad light on traditional shelters. Professor of Sociology and Anthropology Arnold Arluke has argued that [...] "The no-kill perspective has damaged the community that long existed among shelter workers, changing how they think and feel about each other. The vast majority of shelter workers suddenly are thought of as cruel; five million deaths each year are seen as avoidable rather than inevitable, as previously thought. The no-kill idea created culpability within the shelter world; open-admissionists became the guilty party." [...] Nathan Winograd, generally considered {{the leader of the}} no-kill movement, makes no apology for the differentiation, and states that the No-Kill ideology is [...] "A Reason for Hope." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{contrast}} {{between them is}} perhaps most forcibly realised when Gloucester dies in Act 3, Scene 2. Margaret makes a speech in which she points out how it <b>is</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>to</b> accuse Suffolk of the murder simply because Suffolk and Gloucester were enemies, as she and Gloucester's wife were enemies too, so if Suffolk is a suspect, so should she be one as well; [...] "Ay me unhappy,/To be a queen, and crowned with infamy" [...] (70–71). Again, she is turning events to focus on herself. Henry however, completely ignores her, calling out sorrowfully; [...] "Ah, woe is me for Gloucester, wretched man" [...] (72). This situation is repeated during the Cade rebellion, but this time they ignore one another. After the rebels deliver their terms to Henry, he tells Buckingham he will speak with Cade, but Margaret is concerned only with herself and Suffolk (whose head she is now carrying). Speaking to the head she ignores Henry's problems and exclaims, [...] "Ah barbarous villain! Hath this lovely face/Ruled like a wandering planet over me,/And could it not enforce them to relent,/That were unworthy to behold the same?" [...] (4.4.14–17). Henry however ignores this, and continues {{to deal with the}} rebel demands, saying simply, [...] "Lord Saye, Jack Cade hath sworn to have thy head" [...] (4.4.18). This tendency for them to ignore one another is another example of their incompatibility, their failure to unite in thoughts.|$|E
