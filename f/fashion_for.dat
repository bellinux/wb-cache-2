5|$|By {{the seventeenth}} century the <b>fashion</b> <b>for</b> {{portraiture}} had spread down the social order to lairds such as Colin Campbell of Glenorchy and John Napier of Merchiston. Adam de Colone, perhaps the son of Adrian Vanson and probably trained in the Netherlands, was working in England in the 1620s. In 1623 he painted his portrait of George Seaton, 3rd Earl of Winton and his sons and another of Seaton's wife Anne Hay with her two daughters.|$|E
5|$|During the 1870s the {{distinction}} grew between 'first-class ironclads' or 'battleships' {{on the one}} hand, and 'cruising ironclads' designed for long-range work on the other. The demands on first-class ironclads for very heavy armor and armament meant increasing displacement, which reduced speed under sail; and the <b>fashion</b> <b>for</b> turrets and barbettes made a sailing rig increasingly inconvenient. , launched in 1876 but not commissioned until 1881, was the last British battleship to carry masts, and these were widely seen as a mistake. The start of the 1880s saw the end of sailing rig on ironclad battleships.|$|E

5|$|In 1926, when M-40 was extended, M-89 was rerouted out of Allegan to the {{southeast}} along its present-day alignment to terminate at US131 in Plainwell. Just a few years later, the road was extended further to {{the southeast}} to Richland then east along its present-day routing to end at M-96 in Augusta. In 1931, the route was realigned to run east, rather than south into Augusta, where it then met up with M-96 just inside the Calhoun County line.

5|$|After the Restoration in 1660, {{there was}} a <b>fashion</b> <b>for</b> grand private houses in designs {{influenced}} by the Palladian style and associated with the architects Sir William Bruce (1630–1710) and James Smith (c. 1645–1731). After the Act of Union in 1707, the threat of Jacobite Rebellions led to the building of military defences such as Fort George near Inverness. Scotland produced {{some of the most}} significant architects of the eighteenth century, including Colen Campbell, James Gibbs and William Adam, who all had a major influence on Georgian architecture across Britain. The influence of Gibbs led to churches that employed classical elements, with a pedimented rectangular plan and often with a steeple.|$|E

5|$|An {{important}} aspect of entertainment is the audience, which turns a private recreation or leisure activity into entertainment. The audience may have a passive role, {{as in the case}} of persons watching a play, opera, television show, or film; or the audience role may be active, {{as in the case of}} games, where the participant/audience roles may be routinely reversed. Entertainment can be public or private, involving formal, scripted performance, as in the case of theatre or concerts; or unscripted and spontaneous, as in the case of children's games. Most forms of entertainment have persisted over many centuries, evolving due to changes in culture, technology, and <b>fashion</b> <b>for</b> example with stage magic. Films and video games, for example, although they use newer media, continue to tell stories, present drama, and play music. Festivals devoted to music, film, or dance allow audiences to be entertained over a number of consecutive days.|$|E
5|$|Andrew Geddes (1783–1844) and David Wilkie (1785–1841) {{were among}} the most {{successful}} portrait painters, with Wilkie succeeding Raeburn as Royal Limner in 1823. Geddes produced some landscapes, but also portraits of Scottish subjects, including Wilkie and Scott, before he finally moved to London in 1831. Wilkie worked mainly in London, and was most famous for his anecdotal paintings of Scottish and English life, including The Chelsea Pensioners reading the Waterloo Dispatch in 1822 and for his flattering painting of the King George IV in Highland dress commemorating the royal visit to Scotland in 1823 that set off the international <b>fashion</b> <b>for</b> the kilt. After a tour of Europe he was more influenced by Renaissance and Baroque painting. David Roberts (1796–1864) became known for his prolific series of detailed lithograph prints of Egypt and the Near East that he produced during the 1840s from sketches he made during long tours of the region.|$|E
5|$|Beagles were {{developed}} primarily for hunting hare, an activity known as beagling. They {{were seen as}} ideal hunting companions for the elderly who could follow on horseback without exerting themselves, for young hunters who could keep up with them on ponies, and for the poorer hunters who {{could not afford to}} maintain a stable of good hunting horses. Before the advent of the <b>fashion</b> <b>for</b> foxhunting in the 19th century, hunting was an all day event where the enjoyment was derived from the chase rather than the kill. In this setting the tiny beagle was well matched to the hare, as unlike Harriers they would not quickly finish the hunt, but because of their excellent scent-tracking skills and stamina they were almost guaranteed to eventually catch the hare. The beagle packs would run closely together ("so close that they might be covered with a sheet") which was useful in a long hunt, as it prevented stray dogs from obscuring the trail. In thick undergrowth they were also preferred to spaniels when hunting pheasant.|$|E

5|$|Biographer Andrew Morton {{noted that}} most of Madonna's admirers were females, who were born-and-brought-up with an image of old-fashioned {{stereotypes}} of women as virginal brides, or as whores, or with feminist values that rejected {{the use of a}} woman's looks for her self-advancement. Author William McKeen of Rock and roll is here to stay: an anthology commented that with the song, Madonna became the last word in attitude and <b>fashion</b> <b>for</b> young girls of that time. He compared that image of Madonna with that of Barbie. McKeen explained that Madonna intermixed middle-class ideas of femininity with examples of what femininity meant to her, which was having equal opportunity. She offered an aggressive sexuality that implied it was acceptable for women not only to initiate relationships, but also enjoy them.|$|E
5|$|By {{the seventeenth}} century the <b>fashion</b> <b>for</b> {{portraiture}} had spread down the social order to lairds such as Colin Campbell of Glenorchy and John Napier of Merchiston. The first significant native artist was George Jamesone of Aberdeen (1589/90-1644), who, having trained in the Netherlands, {{became one of the}} most successful portrait painters of the reign of Charles I. He trained the Baroque artist John Michael Wright (1617–94), who painted both Scottish and English subjects. The Flemish-Spanish painter John Baptist Medina (1659–1710) came to Scotland in 1693 and became the leading Scottish portrait painter of his generation. Among his best known works are a group of about 30 oval bust-lengths, including a self-portrait, in Surgeons' Hall, Edinburgh. He trained his son, also John, and William Aikman (1682–1731), who became the leading portrait painter of the next generation. Aikman migrated to London in 1723, and from this point until the late eighteenth century, most Scottish painters of note followed him.|$|E
5|$|During the 12th century, {{new designs}} {{began to be}} {{introduced}} – in France, quatrefoil-shaped keeps were introduced, while in England polygonal towers were built. By {{the end of the}} century, French and English keep designs began to diverge: Philip II of France built a sequence of circular keeps as part of his bid to stamp his royal authority on his new territories, while in England castles were built without keeps. In Spain, keeps were increasingly incorporated into both Christian and Islamic castles, although in Germany tall towers called Bergfriede were preferred to keeps in the western fashion. In {{the second half of the}} 14th century, there was a resurgence in the building of keeps. In France, the keep at Vincennes began a <b>fashion</b> <b>for</b> tall, heavily machicolated designs, a trend adopted in Spain most prominently through the Valladolid school of Spanish castle design. Meanwhile, tower keeps in England became popular amongst the most wealthy nobles: these large keeps, each uniquely designed, formed part of the grandest castles built during the period.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1930s, {{just before the}} {{outbreak}} of World War II, there was {{a revival of the}} hooped crinoline from designers such as Edward Molyneux, who put hoops in both day skirts and evening gowns, and Norman Hartnell, whose late 1930s Winterhalter-inspired crinoline designs for Queen Elizabeth were so successful that the Queen is popularly (if inaccurately) credited with having single-handedly brought crinolines back into fashion. Both as Queen, and as the Queen Mother, Elizabeth adopted the traditional bell-shaped crinoline as her signature look for evening wear and state occasions. The film Gone With The Wind, released in 1939, inspired the American <b>fashion</b> <b>for</b> prom dresses with crinolines in Spring 1940.|$|E
5|$|Possibly {{the most}} {{pervasive}} influence on Walpole was Walter Scott, whose romanticism {{is reflected in}} much of the later writer's fiction. Such was Walpole's love of Scott that he liked to think of himself as the latter's reincarnation. He amassed the largest collection in Britain of Scott manuscripts and early editions, and constantly reread the novels. With the Herries stories Walpole restored the popularity of the historical novel, a form for which Scott was famous but which had been out of <b>fashion</b> <b>for</b> decades. The Herries series begins in the 18th century and follows a Lakeland family through the generations up to modern times.|$|E
5|$|The Northern Quarter of Delos {{contains}} the Jewelry Quarter, where older {{structures such as}} workshops and other archaeological remains dating to the 3rd century BC and early 2nd century BC have been discovered. By {{the second half of}} the 2nd century BC these were replaced by private homes built in the most characteristic <b>fashion</b> <b>for</b> Delos: a narrow, rectangular floor plan with a central courtyard, a vestibule service room in the front, and a larger, main room in the rear. The quarter of the House of the Masks is the only area of Delos without this archetypal house plan. Some houses of the Northern Quarter feature mosaic decorations with mythological scenes, including Lycurgus of Thrace and Ambrosia in an upper-story mosaic, as well as Athena and Hermes together with a seated woman in a main-room mosaic.|$|E
