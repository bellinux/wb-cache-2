40|$|Abstract. A {{network of}} observable, {{macroscopic}} cosmic (super-) strings {{may well have}} formed in the early Universe. If so, the cusps that generically develop on cosmic-string loops emit bursts of gravitational radiation that could be detectable by gravitational-wave interferometers, such as the ground-based LIGO/Virgo detectors and the planned, space-based LISA detector. Here we report on two versions of a LISA-oriented string-burst search pipeline that we have developed and tested {{within the context of}} the Mock LISA Data Challenges. The two versions rely on the publicly available MultiNest and PyMC software packages, respectively. To reduce the effective dimensionality of the search space, our implementations use the F-statistic to analytically maximize over the signal’s amplitude and polarization, A and ψ, and use the FFT to search quickly over burst arrival times tC. The standard F-statistic is essentially a frequentist statistic that maximizes the likelihood; we also demonstrate an approximate, Bayesian version of the F-statistic that incorporates realistic priors on A and ψ. We calculate how accurately LISA can expect to measure the physical parameters of string-burst sources, and compare to results based on the Fisher-matrix approximation. To understand LISA’s angular resolution for string-burst sources, we draw maps of the waveform fitting factor [maximized over (A, ψ, tC) ] as a function of sky position; these maps dramatically illustrate why (for LISA) inferring the correct sky location of the <b>emitting</b> <b>string</b> loop will often be practically impossible.

40|$|In Part I, we {{consider}} numerical simulations of event horizons. Event horizons are the defining physical features of black hole spacetimes, and are of considerable interest in studying black hole dynamics. Here, we reconsider three techniques to find event horizons in numerical spacetimes, {{and find that}} straightforward integration of geodesics backward in time is most robust. We apply this method to various systems, from a highly spinning Kerr hole through to an asymmetric binary black hole inspiral. We find that the exponential rate at which outgoing null geodesics diverge from the event horizon of a Kerr black hole is the surface gravity of the hole. In head-on mergers {{we are able to}} track quasi-normal ringing of the merged black hole through seven oscillations, covering a dynamic range of about 10 ^ 5. In the head-on “kick” merger, we find that computing the Landau-Lifshitz velocity of the event horizon is very useful for an improved understanding of the kick behaviour. Finally, in the inspiral simulations, we find that the topological structure of the black holes does not produce an intermediate toroidal phase, though the structure is consistent with a potential re-slicing of the spacetime in order to introduce such a phase. We further discuss the topological structure of non-axisymmetric collisions. In Part II, {{we consider}} parameter estimation of cosmic string burst gravitational waves in Mock LISA data. A network of observable, macroscopic cosmic (super-) strings may well have formed in the early Universe. If so, the cusps that generically develop on cosmic-string loops emit bursts of gravitational radiation that could be detectable by gravitational-wave interferometers, such as the ground-based LIGO/Virgo detectors and the planned, space-based LISA detector. We develop two versions of a LISA-oriented string-burst search pipeline {{within the context of the}} Mock LISA Data Challenges, which rely on the publicly available MultiNest and PyMC software packages, respectively. We use the F-statistic to analytically maximize over the signal’s amplitude and polarization, A and psi, and use the FFT to search quickly over burst arrival times t_C.

We calculate how accurately LISA can expect to measure the physical parameters of string-burst sources, and compare to results based on the Fisher-matrix approximation.

Combining our results with current observational constraints, we find that pulsar data rule out a significant number of kinks on loops for strings with tensions Gμ > 10 ^- 12. By contrast, for smaller tensions current observations allow for a large number of kinks on loops. If this is the case, the incoherent superposition of small bursts emitted at kink-kink encounters leads to an enhanced GW background that hides the strong individual bursts from kinks and cusps.

For closed loops with junctions we show this leads to an exponential growth in time of very sharp kinks. Using numerical simulations of realistic, evolving cosmic string loops with junctions to calculate the distribution of kink amplitudes as a function of time, we show that loops of this kind typically develop several orders of magnitude of very sharp kinks before the two junctions collide.
