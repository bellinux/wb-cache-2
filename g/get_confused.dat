5|$|The move 4.Nf3 {{develops}} a piece and covers the sensitive d2-square. After 4...Bb4+ 5.Nbd2Nc6 6.a3 Black can easily <b>get</b> <b>confused</b> by the move-order. The natural 6...Nxd2 7.Bxd2 Bxd2+ 8.Qxd2 Qe7 9.Qc3 transposes {{in the same}} position as after 5.Bd2, but White can also try 6...Nxd2 7.axb4! Nxf3+ 8.gxf3 Nxe5 9.Rg1 Qe7 10.Ra3! with a strong initiative. White can even retain his bishop with 6...Nxd2 7.Nxd2 and now Borik recommends 7...Bf8 with difficult play for Black as he is not certain to gain his pawn back. To avoid these possibilities Lalic advises the move-order 6...Bxd2+ 7.Bxd2 Nxd2 8.Qxd2 Qe7, but does not mention the possibility of White answering 6...Bxd2+ with 7.Nxd2. A possible improvement for Black (after 4...Bb4+ 5.Nbd2) would be 5...d5 with compensation for the pawn in all lines.|$|E
5|$|The {{publisher}} of paperbacks, Penguin Books, introduced {{a range of}} books for children under the Puffin Books brand in 1939. At first these were non-fiction titles but these were soon followed by a fiction list of well-known authors. The demand {{was so great that}} Puffin Book Clubs were introduced in schools to encourage reading, and a children's magazine Puffin Post was established. There is a tradition on the Icelandic island of Heimaey for the children to rescue young puffins, a fact recorded in Bruce McMillan's photo-illustrated children's book Nights of the Pufflings (1995). The fledglings emerge from the nest and try to {{make their way to the}} sea but sometimes <b>get</b> <b>confused,</b> perhaps by the street lighting, ending up by landing in the village. The children collect them and liberate them to the safety of the sea.|$|E

25|$|Ed's Bowling (formerly Red's), is an {{entertainment}} complex {{consisting of a}} bowling alley, arcade, and formerly a pool hall, music stage, and restaurant. The stage was one of Edmonton's major music venues. Past players have included many bands, both Canadian and international. Wilco, Arcade Fire, The Flaming Lips, The Mars Volta, Motörhead, Matthew Good Band, Sloan, P.O.D., Joe Satriani, Cradle of Filth, Theory of a Deadman, Our Lady Peace, In Flames, Lifehouse, Children of Bodom, Bring Me the Horizon, Testament, DragonForce, Opeth, GWAR, Muse and Switchfoot {{are just some of}} the bands that have played at the venue. It was formerly known as the nightclub/restaurant/rec room Red's. At the end of June 2006, the owners of Red's closed its doors after they chose not to renew their lease. The mall separated it into three areas, converting the stage/restaurant area into a separate concert venue known as the Edmonton Event Centre, while the other area containing the lounge, the arcade and the bowling alley was re-dubbed Ed's Rec Room and a mini-golf course, Putt 'n' Glow. The Edmonton Event Centre closed on New Years Day 2013. It was demolished in December 2013, and Sport Chek took over its former space. In 2017, Ed's Rec Room renamed themselves to Ed's Bowling, so they would not <b>get</b> <b>confused</b> with the newly opened Rec Room, operated by Cineplex.|$|E

25|$|There are {{two forms}} of society in the red {{imported}} fire ant: polygynous colonies and monogynous colonies. Polygynous colonies differ substantially from monogynous colonies in social insects. The former experience reductions in queen fecundity, dispersal, longevity, and nestmate relatedness. Polygynous queens are also less physogastric than monogynous queens and workers are smaller. Understanding the mechanisms behind queen recruitment is integral to understanding how these differences in fitness are formed. It is unusual {{that the number of}} older queens in a colony does not influence new queen recruitment. Levels of queen pheromone, which appears to be related to queen number, play important roles in the regulation of reproduction. It would follow that workers would reject new queens when exposed to large quantities of this queen pheromone. Moreover, evidence supports the claim that queens in both populations enter nests at random, without any regard for the number of older queens present. There is no correlation between the number of older queens and the number of newly recruited queens. Three hypotheses have been posited to explain the acceptance of multiple queens into established colonies: mutualism, kin selection, and parasitism. The mutualism hypothesis states that cooperation leads to an increase in the personal fitness of older queens. However, this hypothesis is not consistent with the fact that increasing queen number decreases both queen production and queen longevity. Kin selection also seems unlikely given that queens have been observed to cooperate under circumstances where they are statistically unrelated. Therefore, queens experience no gain in personal fitness by allowing new queens into the colony. Parasitism of preexisting nests appears to be the best explanation of polygyny. One theory is that so many queens attempt to enter the colony that the workers <b>get</b> <b>confused</b> and inadvertently allow several queens to join it.|$|E

500|$|In a road network, {{congestion}} can {{be considered}} a specific measure of the time delay in a journey or time lost through traffic jams. Delays can be caused by some combination of traffic density, road capacity, and the delaying effects of other road users and traffic management schemes such as traffic lights, junctions, and street works. This can be measured as the extra journey time needed to traverse a congested route when compared to the same route with no such interference.

500|$|Uchikoshi {{started writing}} the script by {{working on the}} ending first.

The game's setting, with characters who are trapped and try to escape, was meant to embody two of humanity's instinctive desires: the unconscious desire to return to one's mother's womb and shut oneself away, and the desire to escape and overcome one's current condition. This was a theme Uchikoshi had used before, when writing the visual novel [...] Among scrapped story elements were the use of hands as {{a major part of the}} story; in the final stages of production, Uchikoshi's higher-ups did not accept this focus, forcing him to re-write the story. The characters were originally supposed to be handcuffed to each other as they try to escape, but the idea was scrapped as it was seen as overused, with appearances in games such as Mahou Shoujo Riska.|$|E

They are all wearing ripped/faded blue jeans and leather jackets, standing upright against the brick wall of a private community garden called Albert's Garden, located in the Bowery neighborhood of New York City between Bowery Street and Second Street.

[...] The back cover art, which depicts a belt buckle with a bald eagle and the band's logo, was designed by Arturo Vega.

500|$|The game's {{story was}} written {{by a team of}} three {{full-time}} writers along with Lake, with a goal of making it [...] "believable".

The game's story was described as [...] "complicated": the team hoped that players would <b>get</b> <b>confused</b> and replay the game {{in order to understand the}} story, and Louden had to create a chart for the team to keep track of the story progression. Lake described the game as Remedy's most ambitious project and the [...] "ultimate Remedy game", since the team learnt from Alan Wake and attempted to refine the formula. As in Alan Wake, the game's theme revolves around family. Lake also drew inspiration from the pacing and plot twists of TV shows, and hoped that the game's story would be unpredictable. He also reinterpreted familiar film clichés in an attempt to make dated ideas fresh again. To add dimensions, the team took inspirations from postmodern literature and included many self-references, such as a standalone TV show called Alan Wake's Return.|$|E
