5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Interview magazine, MØ was quoted saying, [...] "I wrote all of the songs, and I'm attached {{to all of the}} songs. They all fit together, and I feel like they're telling a story. If I should name one that I think represents the album very nicely, then it's a song called [...] "Pilgrim". It's very simple and strong in its message. Both production-wise and lyrically, it's very simple and minimalistic, but has some depth to it." [...] The theme for the album is about being young, inexperienced, and being lost in this crazy society we live in these days. Further on the theme she extended, [...] "When you're young and insecure, there's {{a lot of pressure to}} live up to these ideals, and it's impossible. It's hard to find your own way and navigate through. That's the theme of the album: to be young and searching." [...] Her track [...] "Pilgrim" [...] was also featured in the Italian version of the advertisement of Armani's fragrance Acqua di Gioia. She noted that the song is wanting to escape the noise of society and just go somewhere private where you can listen to your own thoughts and <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> want to be. The track [...] "Don't Wanna Dance" [...] adheres to a collection of squelching synths and was released as a single in February 2014. GQ stated that the track [...] "Walk This Way" [...] has [...] "grand vocals" [...] and fantastically produced [...] "dynamic", funky guitar riffs. MØ recorded the vocals for the album in her childhood bedroom.|$|E

The official due date is Wednesday Dec. 8, since this is our last day of classs. You should {{think of this as}} a firm deadline, to help pace yourself, and because you don’t want it hanging over your head during finals week. If necessary there can be a little flexibility there though. You should aim to pick a topic soon, either from this list or not, and discuss it with me by next week. If you pick your own, it should at least fall into the general areas of number theory or algebraic geometry. Set up an appointment or just stop by. By far the longest part of writing this paper should be reading the sources you will use and gaining a general understanding of them, and <b>figuring</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> want to include. That part should not be left until the last minute. The writing part is not meant to take you nearly as long. I’m generally suggesting topics that I don’t know all of the details about myself.

5000|$|De Fratus is {{a devout}} Roman Catholic who, {{though he was}} raised in a large Catholic family, {{struggled}} with his faith after an injury early in his career, but ultimately determined the injury was a gift from God to help him better understand his faith: [...] "I really feel that the setback was God telling me, ‘Hey you are not done. You are not done yet <b>figuring</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> need to <b>figure</b> <b>out,</b> and I am {{going to give you a}} little more time.’ There is a big reason why that injury happened and I feel that I used it as best as I could have." [...] He noted that he would like to take classes at a seminary to help proselytize to others. Early in his professional career, he struggled to find fellow Catholics, and noted that most of his teammates were either Protestants or not religious. Moreover, in many small towns that house minor league teams, there are no Catholic churches, so De Fratus found it easy to slide away from leading a Catholic lifestyle. However, upon realizing that there is more to life than material success, he discovered a need for God, and has thus developed his faith. Aside from his faith, he enjoys writing and recording music, and playing the guitar. He has two brothers, the older of whom, Steve, played in the minor leagues, and the younger of whom, Chris, caught a foul ball during De Fratus's major league debut.|$|R
5000|$|Heart of Nowhere has {{received}} positive reviews from music critics.

[...] Uncut (magazine) summarized, [...] "Their fourth album continues in the vein of 2011's Last Night on Earth, divining its inspiration from cool, crisp '80s US new wave, [...] "Every Breath You Take" [...] bass lines, Brat Pack soundtracks and wistful songs about girls." [...] Scott Kerr of AllMusic praised the record's sound quality: [...] "The striking production -- namely the driving bass and tight drum sound -- that Arcade Fire mixer Craig Silvey has conjured up here has created a spacious sounding record that is packed with strings and synths and is {{for the most part}} -- rather impressively -- recorded live." ...|$|R

How do you respond? What thoughts begin racing across your mind as you recapture the event that just occurred. You see a visual replay in your mind of him coming through the door. As you walk through each step he took you try to <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> did now to receive such abrupt treatment. Your heart begins to palpitate and pound; your mind begins to swim with the pressure of your blood as it rushes to your head; the palms of your hands become sweaty and swollen; a shortness of breath begins in your chest; excitability begins to set in (anxiety); your thoughts race as you are stunned with the decision “Do I run, escape, stand up for myself, or just ignore him? ” You are now in conflict. Is this a real conflict? Did you ‘do’ something to anger him? Or is it just your mere existence that has him sounding off with an annoying tone? Everyone handles conflict in a different way. Some people handle it much better than others. But conflict, if it is truly determined to be such, can cause physical aliments...|$|E
40|$|Remember that {{childhood}} game “Odds or Evens” {{you used}} to play in order to settle important disputes such as who gets the last slice of pizza? There was only one element of skill to that game: trying to <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> the other person would throw. But that wasn’t easy. If your opponent was savvy, that meant trying to <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> he thought <b>you</b> were going to throw. And that sometimes meant <b>figuring</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> he thought <b>you</b> {{thought he was going}} to throw. Philosophers call this “thought attribution,” and top poker players are remarkably good at it. The ability to attribute thoughts to other people is especially important in the No-Limit Texas Hold’em tournaments that have, through television and the Internet, swept the globe in recent years. What is required to succeed in this game is not merely attributing “first-order” thoughts to other players, but attributing to them thoughts about your thoughts about their thoughts. In fact, that’s the minimum. The kind of thinking done by the very best players (T. J. Cloutier, Howard Lederer, and Daniel Negreanu are especially good at it) is much more complex than that. In this paper, I explore the light that recent philosophical work on thought attribution sheds on the kind of thinking that goes on at the expert poker table. The paper should be revealing to poker experts and novices alike. And it should be of interest to philosophers interested in poker or thought attribution. The essay is published in Poker and Philosophy, a volume of Open Court's Popular Culture and Philosophy Series. The goal of the series is to introduce philosophical themes to non-philosophers by way of particular topics of interest (in this case poker) ...|$|R
40|$|This {{bibliography}} is {{more than}} just a list of books and articles you are building on. The purposes of this background reading and the first stage of your research are to refine your question and zero in on your topic. <b>You</b> need to <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> historical problem <b>you</b> are trying to solve and how your sources will allow you to do that. Think of this detailed bibliography as a game plan. You need to list what your sources are and how you are going to use them. This bibliography consists of two main parts: the primary sources and the secondary readings. Primary Sources The primary sources are the documents from which you are going to write your paper and make your argument. By and large, they have to be documents produced from the time period you are writing about. There are some exceptions such as oral histories written after the fact. But mostly the primary sources are historical documents. That includes things like newspaper, magazine, and journal articles; advertisements, commercials, and posters; movies, novels, and television shows; court records, government reports, and political speeches.

5000|$|Writer Nat Segaloff called Milius:The best {{writer of}} the {{so-called}} USC Mafia, a tight-knit group that resuscitated - some say homogenised American cinema in the 1970s ... Raised on Ford, Hawks, Lean and Kurosawa, shaped by filmmakers as disparate as Fellini and Delmer Daves, Milius favours history books over comic books, character over special effects, and heroes with roots in reality, time, place and customs. Milius' stories reflect his own deeply held ethic, which embraces the values of tradition, adventure, spiritualism, honour and an intense loyalty to friends ... Although he privately chafes at his public image as a gun-toting, liberal baiting provocateur, he allows himself to be painted as such, at times even holding the brush. He plays the Hollywood game like a pro, yet sticks to his own rules; he is a romantic filmmaker who avoids love scenes; his movies contain violence, yet no death in them is without meaning.Milius himself once said:Never compromise excellence. To write for someone else is the biggest mistake that any writer makes. You should be your biggest competitor, your biggest critic, your biggest fan, because <b>you</b> don’t know <b>what</b> anybody else thinks. How arrogant it is to assume that you know the market, that <b>you</b> know <b>what’s</b> popular today - only Steven Spielberg knows what’s popular today.

Mass Eye and Ear {{is one of}} the world’s leading {{specialty}} hospitals dedicated to ophthalmology and otolaryngology care, or as John says, they take care of everything from the neck up except the brain, but maybe the brain too sometimes. One {{of the things that is}} clearly important to John is work life balance. They talked about work-life balance both before and during the interview, and one of the pieces of advice he gives to early careerists is to get your personal life sorted out first, and then <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> want from work, which was interesting advice. John has a series of questions that he gives people to help guide them through that process. A reproduction of the slides he shared with those questions can be found here. In this podcast John talks about his journey to leading this world class organization, including his progress into the executive ranks at another world class Boston organization, the Brigham and Women’s Hospital. Throughout the interview, John talks about his management approach, which focuses on the fundamentals: plan, execute, follow up. While this sounds like a fairly simple formula, anyone who has tried it knows that simple isn’t always easy. John tempers his management approach with a focus on kindness, which was something heartening to hear from a senior executive...|$|E

A very briefly statement of the problem. Do not include any background information well-known by the client or tell the client who he/she is. The purpose of this statement is merely to establish the scope of the study. The objectives of the study should be made clear right up front. 2. A summary of what was done [...] -data collected, models built, scenarios considered, etc. 3. Identification of any important assumptions or restrictions that were imposed (e. g., the option of closing the current facility and moving elsewhere was not considered). 4. Specific recommendations, which may be conditional (e. g., if additional copper platers can be purchased for less than $ 150 K then adding capacity at this station is the preferred alternative for increasing throughput). Be careful not to make recommendations beyond the available data. Sometimes the recommendations will be in the form of suggesting further data collection and analysis.

Overview: We’ll add more structure to the grid, which will help us with more-complicated stress systems. Next week finishes up stress by discussing weight effects and foot asymmetries. 1. What are feet? • Concept originally from poetic metrics, where a foot is a grouping of stressed and unstressed syllables (or “long ” and “short”, terms used more properly for Latin verse than for English). Trochee trips from long to short; (x.) From long to long in solemn sort. Slow Spondee stalks, strong foot!, yet ill-able (x x) Ever {{to keep up with}} Dactyl’s trisyllable. (x [...] ) Iambics march from short to long. (. x) With a leap and a bound the swift Anapests throng. ( [...] x) One syllable long, with one short at each side, (. x.) Amphibrachys hastes with a stately stride; [...] ” ” First and last being long, middle short, Amphimacer (x. x) Strikes his thundering hoofs like a proud high-bred Racer. ” ” (Coleridge) • Linguistic feet seem to be trochees and iambs only. � A language usually has all trochees or all iambs. � English is said to have trochaic phonological feet, regardless of poetic meter: x or, equivalently, x x x x x x x x (x.)
