5|$|Under {{the reign}} of King Fuad I, two laws were passed that reorganized the <b>educational</b> <b>structure</b> at al-Azhar. The first of these, in 1930, split the school into three {{department}}s: Arabic language, sharia, and theology, with each department located in buildings outside of the mosque throughout Cairo. Additionally, formal examinations were required to earn a degree {{in one of these}} three fields of study. Six years later, a second law was passed that moved the main office for the school to a newly constructed building {{across the street from the}} mosque. Additional structures were later added to supplement the three departmental buildings.|$|E
25|$|The <b>educational</b> <b>structure</b> at St. Peter's {{changed in}} 1889, and this proved controversial. Most Jesuit {{missions}} in Montana were on Indian land, {{and it was}} common for white settlers {{in the area to}} pay tuition and have their children educated alongside Native Americans at Jesuit schools. The Jesuits believed this integrated educational system also prepared Native Americans for participation in white society. But as the borders of the Piegan Blackfeet territory shrank over time, St. Peter's Mission found itself standing on non-Indian ground. At the request of Bishop Brondel, Father Damiani made the highly controversial decision in 1889 to segregate the Native American children. Nonetheless, both whites and Native Americans credited the school with providing a clean, safe, warm place to live; three meals a day; and an excellent education. Piegan Blackfeet leaders later credited the mission with giving their tribe well-educated leadership other tribes lacked.|$|E

All bouts on French soil recorded as Mixed Martial Arts {{are in fact}} held under Pancrase Rules and other variants (Pankration, Kempo, Pankido). These bouts involve no striking {{on the ground as}} it is illegal in the country. The Commission National de Mixed Martial Arts (CNMMA) was founded as a non-profit organization for the development of MMA in 2009. The CNMMA had worked over four years to put an <b>educational</b> <b>structure</b> in place, including a technical system for the safe progression from grass-roots level, {{all the way up to}} the top professional level. Comprising 11 regional leagues working under regional technical advisers and teams, the CNMMA joined the International Mixed Martial Arts Federation (IMMAF) in March 2013 as The Commission Française de Mixed Martial Arts (CFMMA). In 2012, CFMMA president Bertrand Amoussou ascended to the position of President of the International Mixed Martial Arts Federation.|$|E

500|$|Harris and Graeme-Evans based {{the series}} around an {{underlying}} <b>educational</b> <b>structure,</b> primarily using Howard Gardner's Theory of multiple intelligences. It is recognised that each child learns {{in a different}} way, and each cast member has a specific segment within the show which targets a different aspect of learning, ranging from logical-mathematical thinking to a focus on linguistic skills, to cater to a child's individual learning approach. Harris observed that most viewers had a favourite cast member, believing that children generally [...] "respond more favourably to the presenter who models the learning style they prefer". The use of multiple segments is also designed to hold the attention span of young children. The skills of pre-numeracy and pre-literacy are a focus of the educational theory, to prepare children for learning at school, while also encouraging self-confidence and expression. According to the show's website, Hi-5 also uses Piaget's theory of cognitive development, providing a learning experience that promotes individual growth.|$|E

2500|$|Sectorally, Unger revamped the <b>educational</b> <b>structure</b> and rewrote labor laws. In education, he {{implemented}} {{a model of}} secondary education, where analytical problem-solving education was paired with technical education that focused on conceptual capabilities rather than job-specific skills. There are several hundred of these institutions today. He further drafted legislation to associate national, state and local jurisdictions into common bodies that could intervene when a local school system fell below the minimum acceptable threshold of quality and [...] "fix it the way an independent administrator would fix a failing business under Chapter 11 bankruptcy." [...] In labor, Unger worked with unions to write new labor laws designed to protect and organize temporary workers, subcontractors, and those working in the informal economy.|$|E

2500|$|In {{order to}} rectify this dilemma, Dewey {{advocated}} for an <b>educational</b> <b>structure</b> that strikes {{a balance between}} delivering knowledge while also {{taking into account the}} interests and experiences of the student. He notes that [...] "the child and the curriculum are simply two limits which define a single process. Just as two points define a straight line, so the present standpoint of the child and the facts and truths of studies define instruction" [...] (Dewey, 1902, p.16). It is through this reasoning that Dewey {{became one of the most}} famous proponents of hands-on learning or experiential education, which is related to, but not synonymous with experiential learning. He argued that [...] "if knowledge comes from the impressions made upon us by natural objects, it is impossible to procure knowledge without the use of objects which impress the mind" [...] (Dewey, 1916/2009, pp.217–18). Dewey's ideas went on to influence many other influential experiential models and advocates. Problem-Based Learning (PBL), for example, a method used widely in education today, incorporates Dewey's ideas pertaining to learning through active inquiry.|$|E
60|$|At {{the end of}} {{the fifth}} year, as the natural outcome of its instinctive effort to {{experiment}} and learn, acting amidst wisely ordered surroundings, the little child should have acquired a certain definite foundation for the <b>educational</b> <b>structure.</b> It should have a vast variety of perceptions stored in its mind, and a vocabulary of three or four thousand words, and among these, and holding them together, there should be certain structural and cardinal ideas. They are ideas that will have been gradually and imperceptibly instilled, and they are necessary as the basis of a sound mental existence. There must be, to begin with, a developing sense and feeling for truth and for duty as something distinct and occasionally conflicting with immediate impulse and desire, and there must be certain clear intellectual elements established already almost impregnably in the mind, certain primary distinctions and classifications. Many children are called stupid, and begin their educational career with needless difficulty through an unsoundness of these fundamental intellectual elements, an unsoundness in no way inherent, but the result of accident and neglect. And a starting handicap of this sort may go on increasing right through the whole life.|$|E

40|$|Ways {{in which}} <b>educational</b> <b>structures</b> can {{initiate}} and facilitate older learners' self-directed learning projects {{are described in}} this study. The research was guided by questions related to the ways that educational organizations can facilitate the learning process for older learners. This study involved two distinct phases of research. In the first phase, a survey was administered to approximately 100 older learners at four organizations for senior citizens; the four organizations were Hillcrest Center for 55 +, Golden Learning Opportunities and Workshop, Tulsa Senior Services, and Retired Senior Volunteer Program. The survey enabled the researcher to identify the 10 most frequented sites for gathering information related to the learning projects of senior citizens in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The survey respondents were volunteer participants from classes, social occasions, and other learning opportunities offered by the organizations. The survey produced three sites where older learners pursued learning activities. Phase two involved ethnographic techniques {{in order to identify}} and describe at each three sites specific <b>educational</b> <b>structures</b> that facilitated older learners' self-directed learning projects. The descriptions from each of the identified sites involved three data-collection techniques. The data-collection techniques used included interviews, observation, and artifact collection. The focus of this phase was to describe the <b>educational</b> <b>structures</b> that facilitated the development of learning projects endemic to each site as identified by the older learners. Notes taken during interviews and observations were transcribed, coded, and analyzed. Interviews were also transcribed. The transcripts were transferred to a conceptually clustered matrix for each site. Analyses of the administrator interviews, participant interviews, educational opportunity observations, and artifact collection at each site revealed patterns and trends that represent the <b>educational</b> <b>structures</b> that appeal to older learners as they pursue learning projects. The findings indicate that four patterns or trends were common to each site. These four patterns included accessible materials, service-minded staff, entertainment, and teacher-directed learning style...|$|R
