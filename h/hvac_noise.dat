50|$|Inadequate control {{may lead}} to {{elevated}} sound levels within the space which can be annoying and reduce speech intelligibility. Typical improvements are vibration isolation of mechanical equipment, and sound traps in ductwork. Sound masking can also be created by adjusting <b>HVAC</b> <b>noise</b> to a predetermined level.|$|E
40|$|Noise and {{vibration}} {{have important}} influence on customer&# 039;s perception of vehicle quality. Research and development {{have been conducted}} to investigate the vehicle Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (<b>HVAC)</b> <b>noise</b> generation and transmission mechanism. Noise and vibration comparison tests have been completed for the proposed refinement solutions. Testing results are discussed paying {{special attention to the}} airborne noise reduction. One of interior noise major contributors is the HVAC system, as air handling unit of the HVAC system is located behind the vehicle instrument panel within the cabin. Modifications made to internal structural geometry of the system have been conducted to provide insight into the effect of each structural feature on the overall Sound Pressure Level (SPL) and frequency spectrum components. Acoustic felts have been applied onto some selected locations of the system, test data shows that both the overall noise level and the noise spectrum peaks at specific frequencies have been reduced...|$|E
40|$|Most {{people at}} one time or another have found {{themselves}} irritated or distracted by the background noise in a building. The irritation might have resulted in minor aggravation or may have been dramatic enough to hinder their work. This leads us to ask whether occupants are increasingly aggravated by noise the longer they are exposed to it, or if they naturally habituate to their acoustic environment. In an effort to answer this question, a study was completed in the “Indoor Environment Lab” at the University of Nebraska. This lab resembles a typical office and was specially constructed to be acoustically and thermally controlled. Subjects completed 38 total hours of testing in the lab over multiple days, during which time they were exposed to several background noise conditions over 20, 40, 80, and 240 minute trials. During the trials, subjects completed a variety of performance tasks and answered questions about their perception of the noise, the thermal environment and various other factors. End results aid in understanding the prolonged effects of typical heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (<b>HVAC)</b> <b>noise</b> on worker productivity and annoyance...|$|E

SoundSoap {{is designed to}} remove unwanted clicks, crackles, pops, hum, rumble, and broadband noise (such as tape hiss and <b>HVAC</b> system <b>noise).</b> SoundSoap Pro is a noise reduction/audio restoration plug-in. It {{is based on the}} same technology as SoundSoap, but offers a more advanced user interface, with the ability to access and fine-tune many parameters not available in the standard version. In addition to removing clicks, crackles, pops, hum, rumble, and broadband noise (such as tape hiss and <b>HVAC</b> system <b>noise),</b> SoundSoap Pro also features an integrated noise gate. The Master Perfection suite has six processing plug-ins with features for mastering, sound design, and general audio processing.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} multi-criteria {{analysis}} model to acoustically characterize {{a specific type}} of building: museums. Significant acoustic objective parameters are used and logically weighted (after analysis of questionnaires and interviews for subjective responses of visitors) to find a representative unique index of evaluation of a room, the IAQM (Index of Acoustic Quality in Museums) rated on a scale from 0 (worst) to 20 (best). The acoustic parameters used are: Reverberation Time (RT), weighted standardized sound level difference of facades (D 2 m,nT,w), Rapid Speech Transmission Index (RASTI), LAeq (from <b>HVAC</b> background <b>noise)</b> and L'nT,w (weighted standardized field impact sound pressure level). The multi-criteria mathematical model is presented and numerically tested with two museums...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to acoustically {{characterize}} typical modern and old museums. Modern museums can easily have a bad acoustic behavior due to the widespread use of very smooth and reflective coatings, hard floors, high-ceilings and very expressive volumes. This situation is not usually seen in "old" museums. Acoustic analyses of two case-studies (the 1999 Contemporary Art Museum of Serralves and the National Museum of Soares dos Reis, in Porto, Portugal) are held using objective parameters measured in situ in their largest showrooms (RT, RASTI, LAeq background <b>noise</b> <b>HVAC</b> and NC/NR). This work studies the generic acoustic requirements of these buildings and recommends optimal values for those parameters. Some proposals for the acoustical improvement in the main rooms are suggested. A short comparison of results with other museums is shown...|$|R
40|$|Auralization {{provides}} {{a valuable tool}} that allows architects, building owners, and other decision-makers to directly experi-ence the aural implications of design decisions and allows them to make more informed choices. Standard numerical metrics are difficult to relate to aural phenomena without significant practice and frequently fail to capture acoustical issues that {{are essential to the}} basic functionality of spaces. Consultants at Acentech have been using auralizations of full soundscapes including many independent sources as design and communication tools for a variety of projects including atria, lecture halls, theaters, and performance spaces. These auralizations have included natural speech and electro-acoustic reinforcement, crowd activity, inter-actions between PA systems and room acoustics, <b>HVAC</b> <b>noise,</b> wall and window transmission, and the subjective effects of sound masking. In general, clients find the experience of listen-ing to their as-yet unbuilt spaces to be exciting and useful. Though most are not trained listeners, they typically move quick-ly past the “wow” stage and into critical listening and candid discussion of the different acoustical treatments presented and of the overall sound of the space. This helps architects and project owners to feel connected to the acoustical aspect of the design, and it helps the team to agree on design decisions that may have significant implications regarding cost and aesthetics. This paper presents several case studies of projects where auralization {{was an integral part of}} the design process. Addition-ally, it describes a rapid auralization design and development process using a MaxMSP-based real-time ambisonic convolution platform...|$|E
40|$|The {{acoustical}} {{performance of}} a microperforated panel and a fibrous material are compared to confirm that a microperforated panel lining {{can be used to}} replace a fibrous lining as a sound absorber in a duct. Fibrous materials are often used to line ducts in order to attenuate <b>HVAC</b> <b>noise,</b> for example. These treatments are often primarily useful in a limited frequency range owing to the characteristics of non-planar wave propagation in ducts. At the same time, microperforated materials backed by a finite-depth air space are effective in a limited frequency range owing {{to the nature of the}} reactive impedance of this combination. Here it will be shown that microperforated materials may be used to create duct linings that produce attenuation comparable with that of fibrous materials. The characteristics of the microperforated panel were studied based on the Maa model. To compare the performance of these two linings, theoretical, numerical and experimental cases were studied. In the case studies, both extended reaction and locally-reacting treatments are considered. For the analytical approach, Morse 2 ̆ 7 s theory was applied in the local reaction case. On the other hand, Scott 2 ̆ 7 s analysis was used to study the extended reaction case. In the experimental work, the transmission losses of various samples were measured in the square impedance tube. To tune these {{performance of a}} microperforated sheet to reproduce that of a fibrous material, the hole size, porosity, thickness, density, and air-backing depth were modified. To validate the experimental and analytical data and to handle situations that are not easily modeled using an analytical approach, a finite element model was used for the calculation. For the finite element model analysis, COMET/VISION and SAFE were used. Since the software does not include explicit microperforated material models, an alternative approach was used. The alternative model was based on the Attala and Sgard model in which the microperforated material is replaced by rigid porous material: that model was formed to represent the microperforated panel in the finite element model. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the microperforated panel can successfully reproduce the acoustical performance of glass fiber as a duct lining material cover the desired frequency range. ...|$|E
40|$|Noise may {{be defined}} as any {{unwanted}} sound. Sound becomes noise when it is too loud, unexpected, uncontrolled, happens at the wrong time, contains unwanted pure tones or unpleasant. In addition to being annoying, loud noise can cause hearing loss, and, depending on other factors, can affect stress level, sleep patterns and heart rate. The primary object for determining subjective estimations of loudness is to present sounds {{to a sample of}} listeners under controlled conditions. In heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems only the ventilation fan industry (e. g., bathroom exhaust and sidewall propeller fans) uses loudness ratings. In order to find satisfaction, percent of exposure to noise is the valuable issue for the personnel who are working in these areas. The room criterion (RC) method has been defined by ANSI standard S 12. 2, which is based on measured levels of in <b>HVAC</b> systems <b>noise</b> in spaces and is used primarily as a diagnostic tool. The RC method consists of a family of criteria curves and a rating procedure. RC measures background noise in the building over the frequency range of 16 - 4000 Hz. This rating system requires determination of the mid-frequency average level and determining the perceived balance between high-frequency (HF) sound and low-frequency (LF) sound. The arithmetic average of the sound levels in the 500, 1000 and 2000 Hz octave bands is 44. 6 dB; therefore, the RC 45 curve is selected as the reference for spectrum quality evaluation. The spectral deviation factors in the LF, medium-frequency sound and HF regions are 2. 9, 7. 5 and - 2. 3, respectively, giving a Quality Assessment Index (QAI) of 9. 8. This concludes the QAI is useful in estimating an occupant′s probable reaction when the system design does not produce optimum sound quality. Thus, a QAI between 5 and 10 dB represents a marginal situation in which acceptance by an occupant is questionable. However, when sound pressure levels in the 16 or 31. 5 Hz octave bands exceed 65 dB, vibration in lightweight office construction is possible...|$|R
40|$|A {{by-product}} of Heating, Ventilation, and Air-conditioning (<b>HVAC)</b> systems is <b>noise</b> that {{is produced by}} fans, compressors, and other related equipments and the noises from the turbulence that is created by moving air. Sometimes, it is impractical to modify {{the sources of the}} noise, which requires designers to modify the path of the noise, the duct system. These modifications might include installing an in-duct silencer or acoustical lining on the inside walls of the ducts. The testing and the precise quantification of the performance of these silencers and duct linings are necessary for any designer {{to be able to make}} the correct modifications to the ventilation system. The ASTM E 477 code calls for strict standardization of the testing of such noise attenuation devices. The ASTM E 477 test facility used by the Center for Mechanical 2 ̆ 6 Environmental Systems Technology (CMEST) at UNLV was first constructed in 1991 and required upgrades to meet the newer revisions of the ASTM code. This study includes making modifications to the facility (1) to increase sound input, (2) reduce sound leakage, and (3) to integrate the measurement systems. These upgrades will bring the facility into compliance with the current version of the ASTM E 477 test standard...|$|R
40|$|Several noise {{criteria}} methods {{commonly used in}} architectural acoustics have been quantitatively related to human noise perception and task performance {{under a variety of}} heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (<b>HVAC)</b> systems-induced background <b>noise</b> conditions. The five criteria examined were: Noise Criteria (NC), Balanced Noise Criteria (NCB), Room Criteria (RC), Room Criteria Mark II (RC Mark II), and A-weighted Equivalent Sound Pressure Level (LAeq). ^ The project was completed over three phases. Phase I included twelve background noise conditions controlled to be non-varying over time and non-tonal, while exhibiting neutral, rumbly, roaring, or hissy characteristics. Phase II was conducted as an intermediate study to examine specifically the effects of exposure time length and types of performance tasks used. Phase III investigated the effects of background noise exposures containing various levels of discrete tones across a frequency range from 120 to 595 Hz. Under each noise condition, subjects completed performance tasks and answered questions about their perception of the acoustic environment. ^ Results show that task performance is significantly affected by occupant perception of noise, but this relationship is not fully demonstrated by the criteria systems analyzed. It was also found that the five criteria analyzed are generally well suited in describing subjective loudness perception, but that some discrepancies in criteria ratings of spectral quality and subjective perception exist. Finally, perception of annoyance and tonality changed based on the frequency and prominence of discrete tones in noise, but these changes were not reflected in the criteria level or spectral quality ratings. Based on the findings of this work, modifications to the existing criteria are recommended. ...|$|R
