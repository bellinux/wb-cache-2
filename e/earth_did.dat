In the modern era, some of the modern geocentrists use a modified Tychonic system with elliptical orbits, while rejecting the concept of relativity.|$|E
25|$|The {{series was}} a major {{international}} success: it was sold to 100 territories and watched by an estimated audience of 500 million people worldwide. However, Life on <b>Earth</b> <b>did</b> not generate the same revenue for the BBC as later Attenborough series because the Corporation signed away the American and European rights to their co-production partners, Warner Bros. and Reiner Moritz.|$|E
25|$|Further {{examples}} {{cited by}} Needham supposed to demonstrate dissenting {{voices from the}} ancient Chinese consensus actually refer without exception to the Earth being square, not to it being flat.

25|$|The natural {{evolution}} of the Sun made it progressively more luminous during the Archean and Proterozoic eons; the Sun's luminosity increases 6% every billion years. As a result, the Earth began to receive more heat from the Sun in the Proterozoic eon. However, the <b>Earth</b> <b>did</b> not get warmer. Instead, the geological record suggests it cooled dramatically during the early Proterozoic. Glacial deposits found in South Africa date back to 2.2Ga, at which time, based on paleomagnetic evidence, {{they must have been}} located near the equator. Thus, this glaciation, known as the Huronian glaciation, may have been global. Some scientists suggest this was so severe that the Earth was frozen over from the poles to the equator, a hypothesis called Snowball Earth.|$|E
25|$|Initially, {{the first}} series was simply known as Journey Into Space, with the {{subtitle}} A Tale of the Future added by the Radio Times, {{but within the}} BBC it became known as Journey to the Moon. The series was set in 1965 (the year in which Chilton believed humans would first walk on the Moon), and was first broadcast in 1953–1954 on the BBC Light Programme, which later became BBC Radio 2. The series was originally intended to have 12 episodes (one source claims 8 episodes), and 5.1 million people tuned into the first episode, but the first four episodes (which took place on <b>Earth)</b> <b>did</b> not prove very popular, and the audience soon shrank to fewer than 4 million. But once the rocket set off for the Moon in episode 5, the audience reaction was much more favourable. The series was extended to 18 episodes, {{and by the time}} the final episode was broadcast, 8 million people were tuning in.|$|E

500|$|Some people {{interpreted}} the galactic alignment apocalyptically, claiming that its occurrence would somehow create a combined gravitational effect between the Sun and the supermassive black {{hole at the}} center of our galaxy (known as Sagittarius A*), creating havoc on Earth. Apart from the [...] "galactic alignment" [...] already having happened in 1998, the Sun's apparent path through the zodiac as seen from <b>Earth</b> <b>did</b> not take it near the true galactic center, but rather several degrees above it. Even were this not the case, Sagittarius A* is 30,000 light years from Earth; it would have to have been more than 6 million times closer to cause any gravitational disruption to Earth's Solar System. This reading of the alignment was included on the History Channel documentary Decoding the Past. John Major Jenkins complained that a science fiction writer co-authored the documentary, and he went on to characterize it as [...] "45minutes of unabashed doomsday hype and the worst kind of inane sensationalism".|$|E
500|$|For the game's cover, Acclaim hired Italian male model Fabio Lanzoni to pose as Kuros; Fabio was {{presented}} {{on the cover}} bare-chested and without armor. When Zippo Games saw {{the image of the}} cover a week prior to its release, they were perplexed. According to Ste Pickford, [...] "Our jaws hit the floor when we first saw this image (which was, being merely the developers, probably about a week before the game's release). Why on <b>earth</b> <b>did</b> they choose a photograph of a bare-chested barbarian to promote a game starring a knight in shining armour?". Pickford added that [...] "We used it {{as an example of the}} lack of imagination of Americans", while suggesting that having an actual suit or armor would be too costly to use for a photo shoot. Ironsword: Wizards & Warriors II was released by Acclaim for the NES in North America in December1989 and in Europe and Australia in 1991. It managed to sell about 500,000 copies in North America and about 50,000 copies in Europe. Following the game's release, Zippo Games would proceed to develop its next game for Rare, they would eventually also release the third installment in the Wizards & Warriors series, [...]|$|E

2500|$|The June Bootids, {{also known}} as the Iota Draconids, is a meteor shower {{associated}} with the comet 7P/Pons-Winnecke, first recognized on May 27, 1916, by William F. Denning. The shower, with its slow meteors, was not observed prior to 1916 because <b>Earth</b> <b>did</b> not cross the comet's dust trail until Jupiter perturbed Pons-Winnecke's orbit, causing it to come within 0.03 astronomical units of Earth's orbit the first year the June Bootids were observed.|$|E

2500|$|Even after {{becoming}} Christian, Danes blended the two belief systems together. [...] Families who lived {{close to the}} <b>earth</b> <b>did</b> not want to offend the local spirits (Danish: landvætter), so offerings were left {{just as they had}} been in pre-Christian times. Sacred springs (Danish: kilder) were simply consecrated to one of the local saints associated with the spring and life went on much as it had before. Christian missionaries were able to help the process along by locating churches on or near sacred places, in some cases actually using wood from the sacred groves for church construction. Thor's hammer sign was easily absorbed by the cross.|$|E

2500|$|His work Cosmic Teachings of a Lama {{states that}} life on <b>Earth</b> <b>did</b> not occur through abiogenesis, but instead through pansperma.

Furthermore, while evolution is a verified fact of nature, speciation through Darwinian evolution has never been witnessed and is [...] "an absurd theory without basis or foundation." [...] Instead, the sum of zoological variation is determined by the seeds of life traveling throughout space (protected by electromagnetic [...] "whirlwinds") which determine the evolution and devolution of life on any planet. Life, according to Samael Aun Weor, is eternal, however its expression is divided into evolutive and devolutive modes: species evolve, reach a pinnacle, and necessarily devolve and return to a germinal state.|$|E

In December 2005, a survey of the world's largest firms of architects published in 2006 BD World Architecture 200 voted the tower as the most admired new building in the world.
