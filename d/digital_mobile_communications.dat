Further, the CCI signals and their multipaths can be suppressed with fewer degrees of freedom.

40|$|Pilot-symbol-aided (PSA) {{transmission}} {{is one of}} the effective methods to combat multipath fading in <b>digital</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>communications</b> systems. In the PSA systems, redundant bandwidth and power are required to transmit the pilot symbols. In this paper, we propose a novel fading estimation technique that requires a very low bandwidth redundancy in the PSA systems. The proposed technique uses simple linear interpolation on the pilot symbols and the detected data symbols to obtain the estimates of the channel fading effects. Monte Carlo computer simulation has been carried out to study the effects of the technique on the bit error rate performance of 16 -ary quadrature amplitude modulation in the flat and the frequency-selective Rayleigh-fading channels corrupted with cochannel interference and additive white Gaussian noise. Results have shown that the proposed technique can, at the expense of a little power efficiency, significantly improve the bandwidth efficiency of the PSA systems using receivers with low com plexity and latency. published_or_final_versio...|$|E

40|$|The rapid {{introduction}} of <b>digital</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>communications</b> systems {{is an important}} part of the emerging digital communications scene. These developments pose both a potential problem and a challenge. On one hand, these separate market driven developments can result in an uncontrolled mixture of analog and digital links which inhibit data modem services across the mobile/Public Switched network (PSTN). On the other hand, the near coincidence of schedules for development of some of these systems, i. e., Digital Cellular, Mobile Satellite, Land Mobile Radio, and ISDN, provides an opportunity to address interoperability problems by defining interfaces, control, and service standards that are compatible among these new services. In this paper we address the problem of providing data services interoperation between mobile terminals and data devices on the PSTN. The expected data services include G 3 Fax, asynchronous data, and the government's STU- 3 secure voice system, and future data services such as ISDN. We address a common architecture and a limited set of issues that are key to interoperable mobile data services.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the use of combined spatial and temporal equalization, in particular for short training sequences. The motivation for combining spatial and temporal equalization is the existence of multipath propagation and co-channel interference. Our main concern is to obtain good performance yet low complexity. We will suggest a low complexity algorithm utilizing a circular antenna array. Although it has inferior performance in an asymptotic sense, it turns out to be superior to the general solution for short training sequences. This conclusion is supported by simulations where a number of algorithms are evaluated for different scenarios involving co-channel interference. 1.
