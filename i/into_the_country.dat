5|$|For {{most of the}} country, {{however, the}} {{occupation}} was only brought {{to an end in}} the aftermath of the armistice of November 1918 as the Belgian Army advanced <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> to replace evacuating German troops in maintaining law and order.|$|E

5|$|The {{establishment}} of national television networks {{during this period}} further fueled the growth of independent Somali productions, most shot on video. Having now obtained greater penetration of the domestic market, the focus then shifted from traditional film premieres in movie theaters to private projections. Consequently, fewer foreign films were imported <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>country.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} thirty nations were {{represented}} at the championships, {{with a combined}} total of 123 {{male and female athletes}} in attendance. Five countries entered the maximum of five athletes per race: Ethiopia, Japan, Kenya, South Africa, and the United States. British runner Andrew Lemoncello was scheduled to be his country's sole representative in the men's race, but he was refused entry <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> without explanation, causing a dispute between UK Athletics and the Chinese Athletic Association.|$|E
5|$|After the Dutch {{recognised}} Indonesia's independence on 27 December1949, {{following a}} several month-long {{conference in the}} Hague, Soegijapranata returned to Semarang. The post-revolution period was marked by a drastic increase in enrolment at the nation's seminary; the 100th native Indonesian clergyman was ordained in 1956. The government, however, enacted several laws that limited the Church's ability to expand. In 1953 the Ministry for Religion decreed that no foreign missionaries would be allowed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> and a subsequent law prohibited those already in Indonesia from teaching. In response, Soegijapranata encouraged eligible clergy to apply for Indonesian citizenship, circumventing the new laws.|$|E

5|$|Although a peace {{agreement}} was made in October 2000, violence ensued in the city streets in March 2002 when two diplomats from New Zealand and numerous others were murdered. In July 2003, conditions had become so bad in Honiara that the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI), consisting of multiple Pacific nations under Australian leadership, was invited <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> by the Solomons Government to restore order. In 2006, riots broke out following the election of Snyder Rini as Prime Minister, destroying a part of Chinatown and making more than 1,000 Chinese residents homeless. The riots devastated the town and tourism {{in the city and}} the islands was severely affected.|$|E
5|$|Bond {{attacks the}} house where Breed is staying with the children, and incapacitates the mercenary, leaving him for dead. He {{establishes}} that the children are being used as drug mules to smuggle raw heroin <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> and locates Solomon Adeka, {{who had not been}} killed in Africa, but been turned into a heroin addict in order to control him. Adeka's older brother had been killed in London, ensuring Solomon became chief of the tribe whose lands held massive amounts of oil: as he was an addict, these rights were signed away in favour of Hulbert Linck. Linck was killed by the CIA during the raid on the house.|$|E
5|$|Bond {{proceeds}} to the enclave, {{where he is}} met by Breed, who accepts Bond's cover as a journalist. Bond meets Solomon Adeka and realises that the leader will shortly die of cancer: his mission to kill Adeka is needless. Bond sees supply flights of arms and equipment coming <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> all funded by billionaire Hulbert Linck; the aeroplanes all show the AfriKIN name on the fuselage. When Adeka dies a few days later, Bond tries {{to leave the country}} on one of the supply flights, but is confronted by Breed and Blessing, who both shoot him and leave him to die.|$|E

5|$|Brigade {{headquarters}} {{are scheduled}} to deploy to the Iraq War in fall 2008 to partake in Operation Iraqi Freedom. In July 2008, the 8th MP Brigade began its move into Iraq with a pre-deployment site survey to support the upcoming deployment <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> The brigade headquarters was set to replace the 18th Military Police Brigade, which ended its deployment in fall of 2008. The 8th MP brigade will continue the training and expansion of the national Iraqi Police force in the Baghdad area. On 2 December, the brigade officially took control from the 18th MP brigade and began its deployment.|$|E
5|$|Carlos P. Romulo, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Philippines {{and member}} of the UN had suite 3600, below Hoover's, for some 45 years from 1935 onwards, and fellow Filipino Imelda Marcos also spent much time and money at the hotel. Another {{connection}} with the Philippines is that many meetings were held here between President Manuel L. Quezon and high ranking American politicians and senators. Through the meetings, Quezon encouraged investment <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> and convinced General MacArthur to accompany him back to the Philippines as his military adviser.|$|E
5|$|During {{this time}} the Jewish Resistance Movement was formed, {{comprising}} several pre-existing Jewish groups. In 1921, the part-time Haganah was formed and trained as a national army. Most Jewish males and some females were required to join. After the Second World War, it obtained numerous surplus weapons to equip its members. The Haganah gave priority to increasing the Jewish population by bringing immigrants <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> from Europe. It always attempted to give prior notice of an attack so that any security service personnel in the area could be evacuated.|$|E
5000|$|Strict Islamic law was {{introduced}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>country's</b> legal system by 1978, contributing to current-day sectarianism and religious fundamentalism, {{as well as}} instilling a sense of religious purpose within the youth.|$|R

5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of war between North Korea and South Korea on June 25, 1950, the United States mobilized a large contingent of troops to send into the beleaguered country. Initially, units occupying Japan were called <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> but forces were eventually dispatched from the United States. In August 1950, Kouma, who was then a Sergeant First Class, sailed for Korea along {{with much of the}} 2nd Infantry Division. It arrived there in late August and was moved into line at the Pusan Perimeter, where US troops were fighting a tight defensive line around the port city of Pusan.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{victories}} of Barack Obama and the Democratic Party in the 2008 U.S. presidential election, {{relations between}} Bolivia and the U.S. improved slightly, and in November 2009 the countries entered negotiations to restore diplomatic relations. After the U.S. backed the 2011 {{military intervention in}} Libya by NATO forces, Morales condemned Obama, calling for his Nobel Peace Prize to be revoked. The two nations restored diplomatic relations in November 2011, although Morales refused to allow the DEA back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>country.</b>|$|E
5|$|From a {{military}} point of view, the outcome at Vukovar {{was not a}} disaster for Croatia's overall war effort. The battle broke {{the back of the}} JNA offensive and left Croatia's main adversary exhausted and unable to press its offensive deeper <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> Vukovar was probably indefensible, being almost surrounded by Serb-held territory and closer to Belgrade than to Zagreb, and although the defeat was damaging to morale, in a strategic context the damage and delays inflicted on the JNA more than made up for the loss of the town.|$|E
