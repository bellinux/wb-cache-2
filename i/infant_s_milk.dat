40|$|Background: Several {{different}} factors {{point to}} {{the significance of the}} role of non-genetic causes in the etiology of type 1 diabetes. Some studies have suggested a positive correlation between early exposure to cow <b>s</b> <b>milk</b> in infancy and increased later risk of developing the disease, while other studies have not found such a correlation. The issue is still unresolved, and in this systematic review I will investigate the most relevant literature on the subject. Methods: I conducted a systematic literature search in Medline and Embase databases, using predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. All studies comparing <b>infant</b> cow <b>s</b> <b>milk</b> exposure with type 1 diabetes risk were included in the review. A total of 19 studies were included, most of them being retrospective case-control designed studies. Results: The included studies were categorized in terms of whether they showed a positive, negative or no correlation between <b>infant</b> cow <b>s</b> <b>milk</b> exposure and risk of type 1 diabetes, and with regard {{to the quality of the}} studies. Six of the studies results were considered to be positive and convincing for increased risk of type 1 diabetes with early infant exposure, four were positive and plausible or positive and lacking, and 12 showed no effect. Conclusions: Divergent results could be seen between the different studies included in this review with regards to whether early <b>infant</b> cow <b>s</b> <b>milk</b> exposure increases the risk of developing type 1 diabetes or not. On the basis of the findings in this review, one can therefore not conclude with a positive, negative or a non-existing relationship between the respective exposure and the disease...|$|R

40|$|Differences in {{clotting}} {{between human}} and cow 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>milk</b> in the stomachs of infants are discussed. Gastric pH, after ingesting milk, {{of an infant}} up to 6 months of age stays at a pH range of 4 - 5, near the isoelectric point of casein, and never reaches the value of 2, which is found in adults. Pepsin C (or gastricsin) can hydrolyze proteins at this pH range. Gastric emptying time is shorter with human milk than with cow 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>milk</b> {{which appears to be}} correlated to the smaller size of human milk clots. Elimination of a readily coagulable fraction of casein from cow 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>milk</b> by restricted rennet action produced B-casein rich milk with similar coagulating properties to that of human milk. Although pepsin digestibility at pH 2 was greater for bovine whole casein than bovine B-casein-rich fraction or human casein, this difference was minimized or even reversed at pH 4. This was ascribred to the difference in clotting behavior of s 1 -casein and B-casein, namely a harder clot of the former. Therefore, the difference in clotting and proteolytic properties between human milk and cow 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>milk</b> in an <b>infant</b> 2 ̆ 7 s stomach can be explained from the difference in chemical properties of their major caseins, i. e., B-caseins and s 1 -case-ins in human milk and cow 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>milk,</b> respectively...|$|R

40|$|Background: Growing up milks (GUM) are milk-based {{drinks with}} added {{vitamins}} and minerals intended for children aged 12 – 36 months. Few data {{are available on the}} consumption of GUM and their role in the diets of young children. Objective: To determine the nutritional adequacy of two groups of 12 – 24 -month-old Irish children by type of milk consumption (consumers or non-consumers of GUM). Design: Using data from a cross-sectional study of Irish children, the National Pre-School Nutrition Survey (2010 – 2011), two groups of children were defined. The groups included children aged 12 – 24 months with an average daily total milk intake of at least 300 g and consuming GUM (≥ 100 g/day) together with cow 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>milk</b> (n= 29) or cow 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>milk</b> only (n= 56). Results: While average total daily energy intakes were similar in both consumers and non-consumers of GUM, intakes of protein, saturated fat, and vitamin B 12 were lower and intakes of carbohydrate, dietary fibre, iron, zinc, vitamins C and D were higher in consumers of GUM. These differences in nutrient intakes are largely attributable to the differences in composition between GUM and cow 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>milk.</b> For both consumers and non-consumers of GUM, intakes of carbohydrate and fat were generally in line with recommendations while intakes of protein, dietary fibre and most micronutrients were adequate.

Though prior adaptation to acid enhanced acid tolerance of non-O 157 STEC strains in Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) broth at low pH, it was detrimental to the survival in fermented goat <b>s</b> <b>milk.</b> The growth of both acid adapted (AA) and non-acid adapted (NAA) non-O 157 STEC strains was not inhibited by the single strain potential probiotic L. plantarum B 411 in fermented goat <b>s</b> <b>milk.</b> However, combination of yoghurt starter culture and potential probiotic L. plantarum B 411 for the fermentation of the goat <b>s</b> <b>milk</b> had a bacteriostatic effect on the NAA non-O 157 STEC strains while the growth of AA non-O 157 STEC strains were substantially inhibited.

40|$|People talk {{of having}} an allergy to cow <b>s</b> <b>milk,</b> but such allergies are in fact quite rare. People are {{normally}} referring to an intolerance of cow <b>s</b> <b>milk,</b> through the body s reaction to lactose, the natural sugar of milk. It is a double sugar {{that has to be}} divided into two separate sugars for the body {{to be able to use}} them. This division usually takes place in the small intestine, mediated by an enzyme known as lactase. After birth and during infancy, most people produce enough lactase to digest the <b>milk</b> <b>s</b> lactose. It is at a later age that some adults do not secrete enough lactase, particularly when they have stopped drinking milk regularly. In such cases, the undigested lactose passes into the large intestine, where it is fermented by bacteria. This intolerance is quite frequent in adults in Asia, the Middle East, Africa and South America; it is rarer in Europe and North America. People suffering from this ailment can nonetheless consume milk in small amounts, as well as unlimited amounts of butter, cheese and yoghurt as these products contain very little lactose.

40|$|Milk {{contains}} {{different types}} of colloidal or coarsely dispersed particles, such as casein micelles, membrane fragments, fat globules and cells. The fat globules are composed of subpopulations of differently sized particles. In contrast to COW 1 <b>S</b> <b>milk,</b> the overall average diameter (dys), increases with advancing lactation from about 1. 8 ~min colostrum to 4. 0 ~min mature milk. Membrane materials originating from the milk fat globule membrane, plasma membrane, secretory vesicles and other sources {{can be found in}} milk serum. These particles have also been called lipoprotein particles. Their size ranges from about 10 - 400 nm. New results concerning the structure of human milk casein particles show that their average size is considerably smaller than in cows milk and that their average diameter tends t~ increase with advancing lactation. dvs in human milk ranges from about 11 - 55 nm, in COW 1 <b>S</b> <b>milk</b> from approximately 90 - 100 nm.

40|$|During 1996 - 2000, U. <b>S.</b> {{imports of}} <b>milk</b> protein {{concentrate}} (MPC) increased rapidly. At the same time, Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) stocks of non-fat dry milk (NFDM) went from nothing {{to more than}} 500 million pounds. Consequently, U. <b>S.</b> <b>milk</b> producers attributed low milk prices and dairy farmer income during this period to the increased imports of MPC. U. <b>S.</b> <b>milk</b> producers were especially concerned with MPC imports for two reasons. First, MPC between 40 and 90 percent protein had been classified in subheading 0404. 90. 10 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS). Thus, MPC was {{not subject to the}} tariff-rate quotas applied to many other dairy products. Second, MPC produced in the European Union (EU) and exported to the United States was eligible for production and export subsidies. Along with the high U. <b>S.</b> internal <b>milk</b> protein prices maintained by the Dairy Price Support Program, and volatile world prices of NFDM, these policies created economic rents for trade in MPC between the European Union and the United States. To test the relationship between these policies and U. S. imports of MPC, these economic rents, which were not directly observable, were estimated by combing a set of identifiable variables: (1) the CCC purchase price, (2) the EU export refund, (3) EU casein production aid, and (4) the world price of NFDM as expressed by the Western Europe export price. A vector autoregression model was then estimated using monthly U. S. imports of MPC and the estimate of economic rents. This estimation showed that nearly 40 percent of the variability in U. S. MPC imports was attributable to the estimate of economic rents. These results demonstrate that U. S. and EU policies can not be analyzed in isolation when evaluating the impact of dairy policies on U. S. MPC imports. Agricultural and Food Policy, International Relations/Trade,...|$|R
