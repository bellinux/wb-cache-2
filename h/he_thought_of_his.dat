25|$|Heinz Heydrich {{had five}} children. His oldest, Peter Thomas Heydrich (1931–2000), was a {{well-known}} German cabaret singer, {{and wrote a}} book about his childhood, father, and uncle. In the book, Peter Heydrich describes how, as a youth, he enjoyed the fame of being a “crown prince,” the nephew of Reinhard Heydrich. During boyhood, <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> uncle as a successful sportsman and a sensitive musician. In Prague, Peter observed that his uncle had become a “high animal.” Peter derived many privileges from being Reinhard Heydrich’s nephew. Even after the war, Peter still felt some pride in the familial relationship, if not so openly. But finally, Peter Heydrich had to admit that Reinhard Heydrich was a protean schemer, who planned and executed the Holocaust and other crimes. Peter died on 22 November 2000, after a long illness.|$|E

On his return, he was {{appointed}} the General Officer Commanding (GOC), 26th Infantry Division. While he commanded the division, General K. S. Thimayya was the Chief of the Army Staff (COAS), and Krishna Menon, the defence minister. During Menon's visit to Manekshaw's division, he asked him what <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> chief. Manekshaw replied that it was not appropriate for him to think of his chief in that way, and told Menon not to ask anybody again. This annoyed Menon and he told Manekshaw that if he wanted to, he could sack Thimayya, to which Manekshaw replied, [...] "You can get rid of him. But then I will get another." [...] This heated conversation with Menon later proved to be a thorn in his career.|$|E
6000|$|For {{the first}} time a {{conscientious}} doubt arose in Edward's mind as to the justice of the course he was pursuing in resolving to refuse the alternative offered by Miss Aldclyffe. Could it be selfishness as well as independence? How much <b>he</b> had <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own heart, how little <b>he</b> had <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> father's peace <b>of</b> mind! ...|$|R

500|$|Coelurus was {{described}} in 1879 by Othniel Charles Marsh, an American paleontologist and naturalist known for his [...] "Bone Wars" [...] with Edward Drinker Cope. At the time, he only described what he interpreted as vertebrae from the back and tail, found at the same location as the type specimen of his new genus and species Camptonotus dispar (later renamed Camptosaurus because Camptonotus was already in use for a cricket). Marsh {{was impressed with the}} hollow interiors of the thin-walled vertebrae, a characteristic that gave the type species its name: Coelurus fragilis. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> new genus as an [...] "animal about as large as a wolf, and probably carnivorous". Coelurus would prove to be the first named small theropod from the Morrison Formation, although at the time Marsh was not certain that it was a dinosaur. He returned to it in 1881 and provided illustrations of some bones, along with putting it in a new order (Coeluria) and family (Coeluridae).|$|E
2500|$|Munch often uses {{shadows and}} rings of color around his figures to {{emphasize}} {{an aura of}} fear, menace, anxiety, or sexual intensity. These paintings have been interpreted as reflections of the artist's sexual anxieties, though {{it could also be}} argued that they represent his turbulent relationship with love itself and his general pessimism regarding human existence. Many of these sketches and paintings were done in several versions, such as Madonna, Hands and Puberty, and also transcribed as wood-block prints and lithographs. Munch hated to part with his paintings because <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> work as a single body of expression. So to capitalize on his production and make some income, he turned to graphic arts to reproduce many of his most famous paintings, including those in this series. Munch admitted to the personal goals of his work but he also offered his art to a wider purpose, [...] "My art is really a voluntary confession and an attempt to explain to myself my relationship with life—it is, therefore, actually a sort of egoism, but I am constantly hoping that through this I can help others achieve clarity." ...|$|E
