5|$|Because {{of their}} muscle relaxant action, benzodiazepines may cause {{respiratory}} depression in susceptible individuals. For that reason, they are contraindicated {{in people with}} myasthenia gravis, sleep apnea, bronchitis, and COPD. Caution is required when benzodiazepines are used in people with personality disorders or intellectual disability because of frequent paradoxical reactions. In major depression, they may precipitate suicidal tendencies and are sometimes used for suicidal overdoses. <b>Individuals</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> history of alcohol, opioid and barbiturate abuse should avoid benzodiazepines, {{as there is a}} risk of life-threatening interactions with these drugs.|$|E
5|$|In late 1929, {{the party}} was {{weakened}} by an internal split. Under increasing French pressure, the VNQDD leadership switched tack, replacing a strategy of isolated clandestine attacks against <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> plan to expel the French in a single blow with a large-scale popular uprising. After stockpiling home-made weapons, the VNQDD launched the Yên Bái mutiny on February 10, 1930 {{with the aim of}} sparking a widespread revolt. VNQDD forces combined with disaffected Vietnamese troops, who mutinied against the French colonial army. The mutiny was quickly put down, with heavy French retribution. Học and other leading figures were captured and executed and the VNQDD never regained its political strength in the country.|$|E

Curtis was the original author of the 1898 Curtis Act, which dissolved the tribal governments of the five civilized tribes, including the Cherokee, and promoted the allotment of formerly communal tribal lands to <b>individuals,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> view to encouraging the assimilation of Indians into mainstream US society and the market economy (though the bill was heavily amended in committee, {{to the point where}} Curtis himself had reservations about the legislation in its final form).

5|$|Augmentative and {{alternative}} communication {{is used by}} individuals to compensate for severe speech-language impairments in the expression or comprehension of spoken or written language. People making use of AAC include <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> variety of congenital conditions such as cerebral palsy, autism, intellectual disability, and acquired conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, traumatic brain injury and aphasia. Prevalence data {{vary depending on the}} country and age/disabilities surveyed, but typically between 0.1 and 1.5% of the population are considered to have such severe speech-language impairments that they have difficulty making themselves understood, and thus could benefit from AAC. An estimated 0.05% of children and young people require high technology AAC. Well-known AAC users include physicist Stephen Hawking, broadcaster Roger Ebert and poet Christopher Nolan. Award-winning films such as My Left Foot and The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, based on books by AAC users Christy Brown and Jean-Dominique Bauby respectively, have brought the lives of those who use AAC to a wider audience.|$|E
5|$|The Inn {{is run by}} Pension, its {{ultimate}} governing body. The name is peculiar to Gray's Inn—at Lincoln's Inn the governing body is called the Council, and at the Inner and Middle Temples {{it is called the}} Parliament. The name was used for the governing bodies of three of the Inns of Chancery—Barnard's Inn, Clement's Inn and New Inn. In Gray's Inn the Readers, when they existed, were required to attend Pension meetings, and other barristers were at one point welcome to, although only the Readers would be allowed to speak. Pension at Gray's Inn is made up of the Masters of the Bench, and the Inn as a whole is headed by the Treasurer, a senior Bencher. The Treasurer has always been elected, and since 1744 the office has rotated between <b>individuals,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> term of one year.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of the baronial castles in England were affected by the economic changes during the period. During the 13th and 14th centuries the average incomes of the English barons increased but wealth became concentrated {{in the hands of}} a smaller number of <b>individuals,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> greater discrepancy in incomes. At the same time the costs of maintaining and staffing a modern castle were increasing. The result was that although there were around 400 castles in England in 1216, the number of castles continued to diminish over the coming years; even the wealthier barons were inclined to let some castles slide into disuse and to focus their resources on the remaining stock. The castle-guard system faded into abeyance in England, being replaced by financial rents, although it continued in the Welsh Marches well into the 13th century and saw some limited use during Edward I's occupation of Scotland in the early 14th century.|$|E

40|$|<b>Individuals</b> <b>with</b> disabilities face {{various types}} of social stigma. Research {{suggests}} {{that the presence of}} an assistance dog leads to an increase in social interactions. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine whether people’s attitudes toward <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> disabilities differ when pairing that person <b>with</b> <b>an</b> assistance dog. Undergraduate students (N= 244) were randomly assigned to view <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> disability either alone or <b>with</b> <b>an</b> assistance dog. Participants rated their attitudes toward the individual, completed a newly developed Implicit Association Test, and answered behavioral intention questions. Results of a hierarchical multiple regression analysis indicated that <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> more positives attitudes toward dogs had significantly more positive social attitudes toward the <b>individual</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> disability paired <b>with</b> <b>a</b> dog, after accounting for gender and dog ownership history.

Twenty-nine <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ACL-deficient knee participated in this investigation.
