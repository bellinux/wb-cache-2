5000|$|By 1850, {{the vast}} {{majority}} of ocean-going navigators worldwide had ceased using the method of lunar distances. Nonetheless, expert navigators continued to learn lunars as late as 1905, though for most this was a textbook exercise since they were a requirement for certain licenses. They also continued in use in land exploration and mapping where chronometers could not be kept secure in harsh conditions. The British Nautical Almanac published lunar <b>distance</b> <b>tables</b> until 1906 and the instructions until 1924. [...] Such tables last appeared in the 1912 USNO Nautical Almanac, though an appendix explaining how to generate single values of lunar distances was published as late as the early 1930s. The presence of lunar <b>distance</b> <b>tables</b> in these publications until the early 20th century does not imply common usage until that time period but was simply a necessity due to a few remaining (soon to be obsolete) licensing requirements. The development of wireless telegraph time signals in the early 20th century, used in combination with marine chronometers, put a final end to the use of lunar <b>distance</b> <b>tables.</b>|$|R
50|$|Highway 672 {{was built}} out of an access road that {{travelled}} north from Highway 66 to Esker Lakes Provincial Park that existed as early as 1977,Between 1986 and 1988, this road was extended north through the park and beyond to meet with Highway 101.By 1990, the road was given the Highway 672 designation. It appears {{for the first time}} on the 1990 Official Road Map as a paved road;however, it does not appear in the 1989 Highway <b>Distance</b> <b>Table</b> published eight months earlier.The route has remained unchanged since.|$|E
50|$|The {{algorithm}} {{operates in}} a very simple manner. When a node first starts, it only knows of its immediate neighbours, and the direct cost involved in reaching them. (This information — the list of destinations, the total cost to each, and the next hop to send data to get there — makes up the routing table, or <b>distance</b> <b>table.)</b> Each node, on a regular basis, sends to each neighbour node its own current assessment of the total cost to get to all the destinations it knows of. The neighbouring nodes examine this information and compare it to what they already 'know'; anything that represents an improvement on what they already have, they insert in their own routing table(s). Over time, all the nodes in the network discover the best next hop for all destinations, and the best total cost.|$|E
50|$|WRP, {{similar to}} Destination-Sequenced Distance Vector routing (DSDV), {{inherits}} {{the properties of}} the distributed Bellman-Ford algorithm. To counter the count-to-infinity problem and to enable faster convergence, it employs a unique method of maintaining information regarding the shortest distance to every destination node in the network and the penultimate hop node on the path to every destination node. Since WRP, like DSDV, maintains an up-to-date view of the network, every node has a readily available route to every destination node in the network. It differs from DSDV in table maintenance and in the update procedures. While DSDV maintains only one topology table, WRP uses a set of tables to maintain more accurate information. The tables that are maintained by a node are the following: <b>distance</b> <b>table</b> (DT), routing table (RT), link cost table (LCT), and a message retransmission list (MRL).|$|E
