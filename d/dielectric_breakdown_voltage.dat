Nano oils comprising stable and dilute homogeneous dispersions of {{two forms of}} titanium (IV) oxide (TiO 2) nanoparticles (Anatase and Rutile) have been experimentally examined and observed to exhibit highly enhanced dielectric breakdown strength compared to conventional transformer oils. Indepth survey of literature yields that research on enhancing insulation properties of mineral oils by utilizing anatase and rutile titania nanoparticles is nought. The present study involves titania dispersed in two different grades of transformer oils, both with varied levels of thermal treatment, to obtain consistent and high degrees of enhancement in the breakdown strength, as well as high degrees of increment in {{the survival of the}} oils at elevated electrical stressing compared to the base oils, as obtained via detailed twin parameter Weibull distribution analysis of the experimental observations. It is also observed that heat treatment of the nano oils further enhances the dielectric breakdown performance. Additionally, further enhancements are observed at elevated operational temperatures.
