5|$|After socialist {{gains in}} the legislature, the Argentine {{government}} introduced several bills in May 1914 which would <b>have</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> battleships up for sale, {{but they were all}} defeated by late June. Following the commencement of the First World War, the German and British ambassadors to the United States both complained to the US State Department; the former believed that the British were going to be given the ships as soon as the ships reached Argentina, and the latter considered it the responsibility of the United States to ensure that the ships never left Argentina's possession. International armament companies attempted to get Argentina to sell to one of the smaller Balkan countries and expected that the ships would then find their way into the war.|$|E
5|$|The Art Nouveau Chadderton Baths was {{a public}} {{swimming}} facility opened in 1937. Henry Taylor, the British Olympic freestyle swimming triple gold medallist and champion was an attendant at Chadderton Baths where many of his awards were displayed. Chadderton Baths were closed indefinitely in 2006 after a structural survey found faults which could <b>have</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> public at risk. Chadderton Sports Centre, built onto the Baths, was closed and replaced by the Chadderton Wellbeing Centre in January 2010. An application to demolish the Baths was made in March 2011, but is now in private ownership with conversion work due soon. The Wellbeing Centre is a multi-purpose facility with a swimming pool, dance studio, library, gym, meeting rooms, and café.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} morning of 18 August, the Austro-Hungarians {{launched}} another attack, {{with the intention of}} pushing the 1st Šumadija Division off the Šabac bridgehead to allow the 5th Army to advance. However, the attack failed as the Serbs defeated the Austro-Hungarians at the Dobrava River, forcing their surviving soldiers to withdraw. Elsewhere, the Serbian 2nd Army's counter-offensive continued along the Cer and Iverak, with the 1st Combined Division attacking the village of Rašulijača and coming under severe pressure at Kosanin Grad. The first Serbian assault was fought off, but a wave of further attacks followed throughout the night. In {{the early morning}} of 19 August, the Serbs finally defeated the Austro-Hungarians and seized the small town. The 1st Morava Division drove the 9th Infantry Division from its position and fought off the division's subsequent counterattack, inflicting heavy losses. The 4th Corps renewed its attack against the Šumadija Division, forcing the Serbs to withdraw having only sustained light casualties. Because the 4th Corps did not break the Serbs, the Austro-Hungarian division was unable to alter the direction of its advance towards Cer Mountain, since doing so would <b>have</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> Šumadija Division in a position to attack the 4th Corps from the rear. As a result, the 4th Corps was unable to join other Austro-Hungarian forces fighting at Cer.|$|E

25|$|The Viking army under Ivar the Boneless and Halfdan Ragnarsson first {{occupied}} Nottingham in 868 {{and subsequently}} set up winter quarters there. Burgred and his West Saxon allies laid siege, but made peace {{and allowed the}} Vikings to retreat after little serious fighting in 869. Danish reoccupation and settlement began in 877, and lasted until the assault by Edward of Wessex {{in the summer of}} 918. Edward constructed a second burh {{on the opposite side of}} the Trent in 920 to further fortify the area from Danish attack.

25|$|At first, the {{situation}} inside the town remained calm, but this changed after June 27, after a failed special forces raid in the Sangin area, during which two British soldiers were killed. On June 30, the insurgents launched their first frontal {{attacks on the}} district centre, garrisoned by British troops. The attackers were driven off, after having lost at least twelve killed. Despite this, the Taliban did not relent, and renewed their attacks every night, using small arms, RPGs, and 107mm rockets. The British answered with machine guns, mortars and Javelin missiles, and by calling in artillery and airstrikes. Resupply was sometimes interrupted {{for as long as}} five days, as Taliban fire would <b>have</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> helicopters at risk.|$|E
25|$|Richard Gabriel {{estimated}} that roughly 2,400 PLO fighters were {{killed during the}} war, of whom about 1,400 were killed throughout southern Lebanon and another 1,000 killed during the Siege of Beirut.

Some later estimates <b>have</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> total figure at 18–19,000 killed and more than 30,000 wounded, most of them civilians. 80% of villages in South Lebanon were damaged, with some completely destroyed. The Israeli government maintained that about 1,000 Palestinian fighters and 800 Lebanese civilians died during the invasion, excluding the siege of Beirut. Kenneth Pollack estimated that 1,200 Syrian soldiers were killed and about 3,000 wounded during the war.|$|E

A gun battle between security forces and militants fighting against Indian rule left five people dead and two others injured on 23March 2008. The battle began when security forces raided {{a house on the}} outskirts of the capital city of Srinagar housing militants. The Indian Army has been carrying out cordon-and-search operations against militants in Indian-administered Kashmir since the violence broke out in 1989. While the authorities say 43,000 people have been killed in the violence, various human rights groups and non-governmental organisations <b>have</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> figure at twice that number.|$|E
25|$|WABC, meanwhile, {{had added}} the brand new, King World-distributed Oprah to its lineup that same fall, {{and placed it}} at 10:00a.m., {{following}} its locally produced talk show The Morning Show. Oprah was an immediate success and in December 1986, WABC decided to move it to the 4:00p.m. timeslot. The move, {{which turned out to}} be permanent as Oprah remained at 4:00p.m. for the next twenty-four plus years, displaced the game shows airing there and WABC needed to find a new home for Jeopardy!; moving it back to late night, as the station did with the low-rated Card Sharks, was not an option and the morning slot Oprah left behind would <b>have</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> series up against the daytime offerings on WNBC and WCBS. WABC, however, had another idea.|$|E
25|$|The Arctic's {{native peoples}} still carry out {{subsistence}} hunting of belugas to obtain food and raw materials. This practice {{is a part}} of their culture, but doubts still remain whether the number of whales killed may be sustainable. The number of animals killed is about 200 to 550 in Alaska and around 1,000 in Canada. However, in areas such as Cook Inlet, Ungava Bay, and western Greenland, previous levels of commercial whaling <b>have</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> species in danger of extinction, and continued hunting by the native peoples may mean some populations will continue to decline. The Canadian sites are the focus of discussions between the local communities and the Canadian government, with the objective of permitting sustainable hunting that does not put the species at risk of extinction.|$|E
