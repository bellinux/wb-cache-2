Prevalence of females (74 %) over males (26 %) and patients younger than 30 years (57 %) stands. Other important features of the self-poisoning attended were ingesting large amounts of drugs in capsules / tablets, mainly mixtures of drugs or psychotropic drugs, neurological or gastrointestinal manifestations of mild severity and increased the latency to one hour consultation. Four fatal cases were reported. A multidimensional analysis through the six classes, four characteristics define modalities of symptomatic cases and two asymptomatic cases related were obtained. The incorporation of statistical tools such as multiple correspondence analysis and classification of factorial coordinates allowed us to improve our knowledge of the toxicological profile of self-poisoning treated <b>in</b> our <b>geografical</b> <b>region...</b>|$|R
40|$|Energy {{status of}} dairy cows may be {{estimated}} using results for concentrations of fat, protein and urea (MUN) in milk samples obtained from bulk tank or individual cows. Using individual cow milk samples is recommended on dairy farms <b>in</b> our <b>geografical</b> <b>region</b> {{due to the}} unhomogenity of cows in the herds in respect to their genetic potential for milk production. Depression of milk fat occurs {{as a consequence of}} heat stress, underfeeding of peripartal cows, overfeeding concentrate with reduced ration fiber levels or overfeeding with dietary fat. High milk fat content is usually combined with severe negative energy balance. Nutrition and feeding practices have great impact on milk protein level. A deficiency of crude protein in the ration may depress protein in milk. Feeding excessive dietary protein does not significantly increase milk protein. MUN analyses point out potential problems in feeding program on dairy farm. High MUN values may reflect excessive dietary crude protein and/or low rumen degradable non fiber carbohydrates intake. Also, MUN levels is impacted by heat stress since its value is increased during the summer season. Low MUNs indicate a possible dietary protein deficiency. Additionally, low MUNs concentration may indicate excess in dietary nonstructural carbohydrates. On the bases on the interrelationships between protein and urea concentrations, as well as protein and fat concentrations in individual milk sample, estimation of energy balance of dairy cows may be done more accurately...|$|R

5000|$|Many writers {{say that}} they have found poetical {{inspiration}} in lands south of Rome thanks to a large variety of local traditions, ancient rural landscapes and people's provincialism. Those characters should belong to a <b>geografical</b> <b>region</b> between Tevere and Garigliano, where artists like Alberto Moravia, Elsa Morante, Cesare Zavattini, Cesare Pascarella, Pier Paolo Pasolini, Giuseppe De Santis, Vittorio De Sica lived, producing famous novels and movies.In 1960 De Sica made a film [...] "Two Women" [...] in Vallecorsa, where he represented in cinematography Moravia's novel [...] "La Ciociara"; {{for the first time the}} terms ciociari and Ciociaria appeared in Italian cinematography. After that some film makers of Italian neorealism who lived in southern Lazio called this land Ciociaria as well as the landscapes they represented in some movies. The term was taken both from ancient books of tourist voyages like Pascarella's Viaggio in Ciociaria and from some fascist historical searches about province of Frosinone and [...] "ruralization". In this uncertain context De Santis considered Ciociaria in cinematography as a topos with which the oppressions of poor pleasants has been expressed in some Italian neorealistic films and he showed this point of view in his movie Non c'è pace tra gli ulivi explicitly. Between Miracles is another movie in which Ciociaria is evoked, following a public statement of the author Nino Manfredi who says that the plot represents a part of his life during which he was contemporary rebel and repressed, just in Ciociaria, where he was born.|$|R
40|$|This {{publication}} {{presents a}} description of the Community typology for agricultural holdings and the way how that is applied in Finland. The objective of the Community typology is to achieve a uniform classification of holdings in the European Union. The classification is based on the type of farming and the economic size, which are determined on the basis of standard gross margin. The Community typology for agricultural holding and the statistics where it is applied, the Community Farm Accountancy Data Network and the Community farm structure survey are based to the EU legislation. Joining to the EU in 1995 has meant that the stipulations concerning the typology and its applications entered into force also in Finland. The first half of this publication presents a thorough description of the Community typology as well as its main applications. This part also includes the description of the method of classifying the holdings in parallel statistics in Finland. In the empirical part of the publication the Finnish farms are classified according the Community typology rules. The physical characteristics of the holdings are based on the Rural Business Register. The standard gross margins for each characteristic are calculated for four <b>geografical</b> <b>regions</b> <b>in</b> a way agreed with Eurostat and DG VI. The outcome is the breakdown of Finnish farms by type farming and by economic size based on the Community typology. The first concrete applications of the new typology system in Finland are the determination of the sample needed for the Community Farm Accountancy Data Network and the Community Farm Structure Survey. In {{the last part of the}} publication the first sample for FADN in Finland is determined. The Community typology has many benefits in the future in Finland. It will be one important base for international comparations between holdings. It also facilitates for example the development of the calculation the results of Finnish bookkeeping farms. When the same typology is used the results of the bookkeeping farms can be extrapolated to those field of observation. vokMTT Taloustutkimus (MTTL) The community typology for agricultural holdings in Finlan...|$|R

We {{provide a}} model of {{optimization}} of transportation networks (e. g. urban traffic lines, subway or railway networks) <b>in</b> a <b>geografical</b> area (e. g. a city) with given density of population and that of services and/or workplaces, the latter being the destinations of everyday movements of the former. The model is formulated in terms of Federer-Fleming theory of currents, and allows to get both the position and the necessary capacity of the optimal network. Existence and some qualitative properties of solutions to the respective optimization problem are studied. Also, in an important particular case it is shown that the model proposed is equivalent to another known model of optimization of optimal transportation network, the latter not using the language of currents...|$|R

40|$|The appereance of federalist {{tendencies in}} the Greek world, which reached their peek in the hellenistic period, {{was not only}} conscribed to those States of the {{continental}} area (the best known being the aquean). Federalist structures were developed in Asia Minor as well by autoctonous, non-greek population such as the carians and lycians. Within this context, {{the purpose of this}} article is to analyse the specific federalist formations which went beyond the typical religious objectives and had a relevant political weight. Such is the case of the Lycian Confederation, the only one amongst all minorasiatic federations to have gained State status. Its different stages of development will be analysed focusing on the origins of the lycian federal constitution, only known in certain detail dLiring imperial times. In contradiction to Larsen's research, which (supposes) acknowledges the Greek influence, and in particular that of the Aquean institutions, the author postulates an autonomous evolution of the Lycian Confederation. This can be explained throLigh similar, and previously existant, autoctonous federal political formations whose testimonies can be found nowadays <b>in</b> the <b>geografical</b> surroundings of Lycia...|$|R

The hidrografical basin of Pedroso river, in Santa Luzia MG, are an excelant exemple of this degradated scenery. The fast and desordenated populational and urban growth experienced by Santa Luzia, supplant the legislation in a federal, state and municipal levels.

The delimitation of the PPAs and the analysis of its preservations state was made by the buffers confection <b>in</b> the GIS (<b>Geografical</b> Information Sistem) Arcgis. By the buffers analysis, we could identificate the bad preservation state of PPAs in this hidrografical basin, resultated of the disrespect to the enviroment in the urbanizated areas and the bad planning made to this city. This hidrografical basin have a low socioeconomic levels, that result in a low enviromental levels of preservation. This study could demonstrate how the use of GIS, to this type of enviromental analysis, can be able to reduce the researchs cost and reduce the work field necessity. Pages: 1020 - 102...|$|R
