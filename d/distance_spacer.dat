40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{the analysis of}} steel road restraint system, which is currently in use on European public roads. Observations of installed systems indicate that the current road restraint system design is far too stiff, which results in unacceptable decelerations during the vehicle impact. The global stiffness of the restraint system in the initial phase of an impact is largely attributed to the <b>distance</b> <b>spacer</b> design. The purpose {{of this research is}} to improve the currently road restraint system design by means of computational simulations. The impact severity and stiffness of current and new design have been evaluated with dynamic nonlinear elasto-plastic analysis of a three-dimensional road restraint system {{within the framework of the}} finite element method with LS-DYNA code. Computational simulations were verified with full scale crash tests. Computational analyses prove that the currently used road restraint system is impropriate and that the new road restraint system design assures controllable elasto-plastic deformation and crash energy absorption which in turn decreases the decelerations of an impact vehicle and consequently increases the safety of vehicle passengers...|$|E

40|$|The {{replication}} origin {{region of}} the Escherichia coli K- 12 chromosome has been cloned, and a region of 245 base-pairs {{has been shown to}} contain all the infonnation for autonomous replication (defined ori). In order to obtain further information on the sequence organization in the defined ori stretch, various types of mutation were introduced by iri vitro techniques at a restriction site (Avail site) which locates near the middle of ori. When the correlation between these mutations and replicating function was examined, different effects were obtained with the types of mutation: the replicating function was completely destroyed by either insertion or deletion of short sequences, but not by base-substitutions. Based on these observations and on the fact that multi-gene products are involved in the initiation of replication, we assume that two categories of sequences are present within the ori stretch, one specifying interaction with initiation factors (recognition sequences) and the other spacing the recognition sequences in appropriate <b>distances</b> (<b>spacer</b> sequences), and that the Avail site is located in the spacer region...|$|R

An extensive literature review of existing and past practices is used as the main vehicle to analyze: framing and wall insulation methods, architectural details with focus on minimizing thermal bridges, structural adequacy aspects with respect to gravity and lateral loads, and ability to provide fire and sound breaks. In this paper a wide selection of advance framing wall assemblies is discussed in details with main focus on construction methods, architectural details with minimized thermal bridges, and structural (strength) concerns. High performance wall technologies of consideration include: double walls, Larsen truss walls, optimum or advanced framing walls, walls using <b>distance</b> <b>spacers</b> (furring) and walls made of wood-based composites. Since wood framing for wall applications is mostly used in North America, Scandinavia, and Central Europe, this study is focused on research studies from these regions.

Vibration characteristics are evaluated as the following parameters are varied: thickness of shed ice, <b>distance</b> between adjacent <b>spacers,</b> and number of subconductors in the bundle. Simulation results will provide information on how the amplitude of vibration and the transient dynamic forces change with the application of spacers.

40|$|Negative {{stiffness}} {{refers to}} a negative ratio of the force to the displacement in a deformed material system. It can be very useful {{in the design and}} fabrication of vibration isolation systems. In this study, a new kind of weft-knitted spacer structure that can achieve negative stiffness under compression was specially developed by using elastic yarn to knit the outer layers of spacer structure. Twelve fabric samples were knitted on an electronic flat knitting machine with three different linking distances and four diameters of spacer monofilaments. The compression tests were conducted to verify the negative stiffness effect of the fabrics after a steaming treatment. The results obtained have shown that the negative stiffness effect can be obtained for weft-knitted spacer fabrics in a special range of compression displacement if suitable fabric structure and fiber materials are used, and the decrease of the linking <b>distance</b> of <b>spacer</b> monofilaments can enhance the negative stiffness effect.

Such an artificially engineered absorber can have potential applications in sensing, cancer diagnosis and therapy, and photovoltaic cells etc. This thesis systematically studies a particular class of plasmonic absorber based on gold nanoparticles deposited {{on top of a}} continuous gold substrate. In our case studies, the nanoparticles have sub-wavelength sizes of less than 50 nm; their reflectances are examined over 400 - 800 nm light wavelength range. With a 3 D finite-element method, we identified that the resonance at especially a long-wavelength position originates not from dipole resonance of the particles, but from the inter-particle near-field coupling resonance. The influences of particle size, particle shape, inter-particle <b>distance,</b> particle-substrate <b>spacer,</b> particle lattice, number of particle layers etc on the resonance are studied thoroughly. Experimentally, an absorber based on chemically-synthesized Au@SiO 2 core-shell nanoparticles was fabricated. Measurement shows that the absorber has a characteristic absorption band around 800 nm with an absorbance peak of 90 %, which agrees surprisingly well with our numerical calculation.

The thickness of the silica layer is varied from 0 to approximately 46 nm on a single sample, thus allowing for continuous variation of the interaction strength between plasmon excitations in the metallic film and the excited states of pigments comprising photosynthetic complexes used to probe this interaction. While the largest separation between the silver film and photosynthetic complexes provides fluorescence featuring mono-exponential decay, thinner silica <b>spacer</b> <b>distances</b> show bi-exponential decay.

40|$|ABSTRACTGiven {{that the}} {{durability}} of structures {{is directly related to}} the thickness of the cover to reinforcement, it is essential to ensure minimum cover is achieved when building a structure. However, studies show that this is not always the case. One of the reasons for the this problem is the lack of indication, in structural projects, of the positioning of spacers. This situation is compounded by the lack of standards and regulations on the use of spacers (i. e. minimum quantities and required layout). This study assesses three different <b>spacer</b> <b>distances</b> and two different tying distances in order to examine the influence of these factors in the cover to reinforcement. To achieve so, three slabs were prepared in situ using different arrangements. After demoulding, cover thickness was determined using a digital covermeter.

40|$|AbstractWe {{have used}} the oxidant CuCl 2 to study its effect on {{precursor}} protein import into chloroplasts and on the components involved. CuCl 2 reversibly oxidizes thiol groups, which in turn, can form disulfide bridges. Concentrations of 40 μM CuCl 2 almost completely inhibit precursor protein binding and subsequent translocation into chloroplasts. This inhibitory effect is reversible by a dithiothreitol treatment. Disulfide bridges, which form upon oxidation by CuCl 2, are build up intramolecular and intermolecular, if the thiol groups are in close vicinity to each other. CuCl 2 can thus {{be used as a}} thiol cleavable crosslinker without an additional <b>spacer</b> <b>distance</b> between the two targets. When purified outer envelope membranes were treated with CuCl 2, a hetero oligomeric complex is detected, consisting of OEP 86, OEP 75 and OEP 34, indicating the close vicinity and protein-protein interaction between polypeptides in situ, which are involved in protein translocation into chloroplasts...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental {{study on the}} vibration isolation performance of weft-knitted spacer fabrics under forced harmonic excitation. The weft-knitted spacer fabrics with two different thicknesses were first designed by varying the linking <b>distance</b> of the <b>spacer</b> monofilament and fabricated using an electronic flat knitting machine. Then, their vibration isolation performance was tested under forced vibration condition via sinusoidal sweeps from low to high frequencies. The typical acceleration transmissibility curve and effects of fabric thickness, load mass and excitation level were discussed in detail. The results obtained show that the thicker spacer fabric has a lower resonance frequency than the thinner fabric due to lower stiffness, and thus can isolate the vibration at a lower frequency level. The results also show that changing the load mass and excitation level changes the loading conditions of the fabric structure, and thus also changes fabric stiffness and vibration isolation performance due to nonlinear behavior of spacer fabrics. It is expected that this study could provide some useful information to promote the application of weft-knitted spacer fabrics for vibration isolation. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a report on {{experimental}} investigations of electrical and thermal properties of Si/Si_ 1 _-_xGe_x/Si normal and inverted modulation doped structures and delta doped Si layers grown by solid source Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE). If the grown Si layer is B-doped at some <b>distance</b> (as <b>spacer)</b> {{before or after the}} alloy layer, this remote doping induces the formation of a quasi two dimensional hole gas (2 DHG) near the inverted (SiGe on Si) or normal (Si on SiGe) heterointerfaces of the Si/Si_ 1 _-_xGe_x/Si quantum well, respectively. Other types of samples measured were #delta# -doped Si (2 DHG) and 3 -doped Si (2 DEG) structures. Low temperature magnetotransport measurements (down to 0. 3 K and at the magnetic field up to 12 T in strength) were carried out on one inverted 2 DHG structure. The hole effective mass was extracted from the temperature dependence of Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations. The thesis mainly presents experimental and theoretical results of zero magnetic field thermoelectric power (thermopower) for two dimensional hole gas and electron gas samples in the temperature range 1. 5 - 300 K. The results correspond well with Cantrell-Butcher phonon drag thermopower theory. The temperature dependence of the thermopower is explained both in terms of the effects of phonon drag and the enhancement of electron-phonon interaction. Another contribution to the thermopower is the diffusion thermopower at low temperatures. The diffusion thermopower has been obtained experimentally for temperatures varying between 0. 5 K and 1. 6 K. The thermal conductivity was measured by applying a temperature gradient through the samples. The measured values of the thermal conductivity corresponded with T" 3 temperature dependence law at low temperatures due to the boundary conditions. The phonon mean free paths were calculated from the thermal conductivity data and were found to be in agreement with Casimir length at low temperatures.

40|$|A {{particular}} interesting plasmonic {{system is}} that of metallic nanostructures interacting with metal films. As the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) behavior of gold nanostructures (Au NPs) {{on the top of}} a gold thin film is exquisitely sensitive to the <b>spacer</b> <b>distance</b> of the film-Au NPs, we investigate in the present work the influence of a few-layered graphene spacer on the LSPR behavior of the NPs. The idea is to evidence the role of few-layered graphene as one of the thinnest possible spacer. We first show that the coupling to the Au film induces a strong lowering at around 507 nm and sharpening of the main LSPR of the Au NPs. Moreover, a blue shift in the main LSP resonance of about 13 nm is observed in the presence of a few-layered graphene spacer when compared to the case where gold nanostructures are directly linked to a gold thin film. Numerical simulations suggest that this LSP mode is dipolar and that the hot spots of the electric field are pushed to the top corners of the NPs, which makes it very sensitive to surrounding medium optical index changes and thus appealing for sensing applications. A figure of merit of such a system (gold/graphene/Au NPs) is 2. 8, as compared to 2. 1 for gold/Au NPs. This represents a 33 % gain in sensitivity and opens-up new sensing strategies...|$|R

From determinations of the uridine triphosphate pool sizes and [3 H]uridine uptake, phosphorylation, and incorporation into 28 S and 18 S rRNAs in vivo {{it was estimated that}} the rate of rRNA synthesis was about 0. 01 % in previtellogenic oocytes and 13 % in mature oocytes when compared to midvitellogenesis. Spread preparations of nucleoli showed significant morphological {{changes in the}} transcriptional complexes. The total number of lateral fibrils, i. e., ribonucleoproteins containing the nascent rRNA precursor, were drastically decreased in stages of reduced synthetic activity. This indicates that rRNA synthesis is regulated primarily at the level of transcription. The resulting patterns of fibril coverage of the nucleolar chromatin axes revealed a marked heterogeneity. On the same nucleolar axis occurred matrix units that were completely devoid of lateral fibrils, matrix units that were almost fully covered with lateral fibrils, and various forms of matrix units with a range of lateral fibril densities intermediate between the two extremes.

In this paper we show for the first time that a replicating vector can been used to express foreign genes other than antibiotic resistance genes in Acholeplasma laidlawii. Plasmids derived from the lactococcal vector pNZ 18 could introduce and maintain four different genes for many generations in A. laidlawii. One of these, encoding the dominant membrane lipoprotein spiralin from the mollicute Spiroplasma citri, was expressed; however, expression was weak, the signal peptide of spiralin was not cleaved and the protein was not covalently modified by fatty acids. This resulted in a hydrophilic character of spiralin and its cytoplasmic localization in A. laidlawii. To increase the expression of foreign genes, random A. laidlewii DNA fragments were cloned into a pNZl 8 -related plasmid and expression signals were selected using the Bacillus licheniformis a-amylase gene as a probe. Selection was done in Escherichia coli as well as directly in A. Iaidlawii. Active recombinants from E. coli were also able to express a-amylase activities and an enzyme of native size in A. laidlawii.

40|$|The area of ruthenium(H) and osmium(H) polypyridyl {{chemistry}} {{has been}} the subject of intense investigation over the last half century. In chapter 1, topics relevant to the studies presented in this thesis are introduced. These areas include the basic principles behind the ground and excited state properties of Ru(II) and Os(II) polypyridyl complexes, complexes incorporating the 1, 2, 4 -triazole moiety and the application of deuteriation to inorganic photophysics. Chapter 2 details experimental and basic synthetic procedures employed in the studies presented in later chapters. A limited discussion of practical aspects of both synthetic procedures and physical measurements is included, in particular where major difficulties were encountered and where improvements to standard procedures were made. A central theme to this thesis is the application of deuteriation as a spectroscopic probe. In order to fully exploit its potential fully, a general and systematic approach to the deuteriation of polypyridyl type ligands is required. In chapter 3 a range of isotopomers of heteroaromatic compounds containing pyrazyl-, pyridyl-, 1, 2, 4 -triazole-, thienyl-, methyl-, and phenyl- moieties, are reported. The application of deuteriation in inorganic chemistry as a spectroscopic probe both in simplification of NMR and Raman spectra and as a probe into the excited state structure of heteroleptic complexes is the focus of chapter 4. Deuteriation is employed extensively to probe the excited state structure of several series of Ru(II) and Os(II) polypyridyl complexes. In particular the effect of deuteriation on emission lifetime and ground and excited state resonance Raman spectra is investigated. In chapter 5, the phenomena of temperature dependent dual luminescence observed for the mononuclear complex [Ru(bpy) 2 (pztr) ]+ forms the basis of a wider investigation of related complexes in an effort to gain more insight into the nature of the phenomenon. In addition some fundamental studies into the picosecond excited state processes of [Ru(bpy) 3] 2 + are presented. In these studies deuteriation shows itself as a powerful tool in effecting small but important perturbations.

40|$|Experiments {{investigating}} complex {{flows in}} rod bundles with spacer grids that have mixing devices (such as flow mixing vanes) have mostly been performed using single-point measurements. Although these measurements allow local comparisons of experimental and numerical data they provide little insight because the discrepancies can {{be due to}} the integrated effects of many complex flow phenomena such as wake-wake, wake-vane, and vane-boundary layer interactions occurring simultaneously in a complex flow environment. In order to validate the simulations results, detailed comparison with experimental data must be done. This work describes an experimental database obtained using Time Resolved Particle Image Velocimetry (TR-PIV) measurements within a 5 x 5 rod bundle with spacer-grids. Measurements were performed using two different grid designs. One typical of Boiling Water Reactors (BWR) with swirl type mixing vanes and the other typical of Pressurized Water Reactors (PWR) with split type mixing vanes. High quality data was obtained {{in the vicinity of the}} grid using the multi-scale approach. One of the unique characteristic of this set-up is the use of the Matched Index of Refraction (MIR) technique employed in this investigation. This approach allows the use of high temporal and spatial non-intrusive dynamic measurement techniques to investigate the flow evolution below and immediately above the spacer. The experimental data presented includes explanation of the various cases tested such as test rig dimensions, measurement zones, the test equipment and the boundary conditions in order to provide appropriate data for comparison with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. Turbulence parameters of the obtained data are analyzed in order to gain insight of the physical phenomena. The shape of the velocity profile at various <b>distances</b> from the <b>spacer</b> show important modifications passing the grid which delineates the significant effects of the presence of the grid spacer. Influence of the vanes wake in the global velocity was quantified to be up to a distance of 4 hydraulic diameters from the edge of the grid. Spatial and temporal correlations in the two measured dimensions were performed to quantify the time and length scales present in the flow in the vicinity of the grids and its influence in the flow modification induced by the vanes. Detection of vortex cores was performed using the vorticity, swirl strength and Galilean decomposition approach. The resulted cores were then tracked in time, in order to observe the evolution of the structures under the influence of the vanes for each grid. Vortex stretching was quantified in order to gain insight of the energy dissipation process normally associated with the phenomena. This work presents data in a single-phase flow situation and an analysis of these data for understanding complex flow structure. This data provide for the first time detailed temporal velocity full field which can be used to validate CFD codes...|$|R
40|$|Fusion of {{cervical}} spine in kyphotic alignment {{has been}} proven to produce an acceleration of degenerative changes at adjacent levels. Stand-alone cages are reported to have a relatively high incidence of implant subsidence with secondary kyphotic deformity. This malalignment may theoretically lead to adjacent segment disease in the long term. The prospective study analysed possible risk factors leading to cage subsidence with resulting sagittal malalignment of cervical spine. Radiographic data of 100 consecutive patients with compressive radiculo-/myelopathy due to degenerative disc prolapse or osteophyte formation were prospectively collected in those who were treated by anterior cervical discectomy and implantation of single type interbody fusion cage. One hundred and forty four implants were inserted altogether at one or two levels as stand-alone cervical spacers without any bone graft or graft substitute. All patients underwent standard anterior cervical discectomy and the interbody implants were placed under fluoroscopy guidance. Plain radiographs were obtained on postoperative days one and three to verify position of the implant. Clinical and radiographic follow-up data were obtained at 6  weeks, 3 and 6  months and than annually in outpatient clinic. Radiographs were evaluated with respect to existing subsidence of implants. Subsidence was defined as more than 2  mm reduction in segmental height due to implant migration into the adjacent end-plates. Groups of subsided and non-subsided implants were statistically compared with respect to <b>spacer</b> <b>distance</b> to the anterior rim of vertebral body, spacer versus end-plate surface ratio, amount of bone removed from adjacent vertebral bodies during decompression and pre- versus immediate postoperative intervertebral space height ratio. There were 18 (18 %) patients with 19 (13. 2 %) subsided cages in total. No patients experienced any symptoms. At 2  years, there was no radiographic evidence of accelerated adjacent segment degeneration. All cases of subsidence occurred at the anterior portion of the implant: 17 cases into the inferior vertebra, 1 into the superior and 1 into both vertebral bodies. In most cases, the process of implant settling started during the perioperative period and its progression did not exceed three postoperative months. There was an 8. 7 ° average loss of segmental lordosis (measured by Cobb angle). Average distance of subsided intervertebral implants from anterior vertebral rim {{was found to be}} 2. 59  mm, while that of non-subsided was only 0. 82  mm (P <  0. 001). Spacer versus end-plate surface ratio was significantly smaller in subsided implants (P <  0. 001). Ratio of pre- and immediate postoperative height of the intervertebral space did not show significant {{difference between the two groups}} (i. e. subsided cages were not in overdistracted segments). Similarly, comparison of pre- and postoperative amount of bone mass in both adjacent vertebral bodies did not show a significant difference. Appropriate implant selection and placement appear to be the key factors influencing cage subsidence and secondary kyphotisation of box-shaped, stand-alone cages in anterior cervical discectomy and fusion. Mechanical support of the implant by cortical bone of the anterior osteophyte and maximal cage to end-plate surface ratio seem to be crucial in the prevention of postoperative loss of lordosis. Our results were not able to reflect the importance of end-plate integrity maintenance; the authors would, however, caution against mechanical end-plate damage. Intraoperative overdistraction was not shown to be a significant risk factor in this study. The significance of implant subsidence in acceleration of degenerative changes in adjacent segments remains to be evaluated during a longer follow-up...|$|R
