40|$|Banks as {{financial}} institutions have delivered superior services {{to their customers}} for gaining competitive advantages. The intimacy between banks <b>employees</b> <b>and</b> customers has signifi- cant role for creating satisfaction. This research tries to examine {{the influence of the}} deter- mination of customer intimacy specifically benevolence, credibility, and image of banks em- ployee on intimacy between banks <b>employees</b> <b>and</b> customers and customer satisfaction. Re- search involved 100 customers from four banks (Mandiri, BNI, BRI, and BTN) that selected by purposive sampling. Data were analyzed by Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The results showed that: (1) benevolence did not have significantly effect on intimacy between banks <b>employees</b> <b>and</b> customers, (2) credibility <b>and</b> <b>employees</b> image have significantly in- fluences on intimacy between banks <b>employees</b> <b>and</b> customers, and (3) bank s <b>employees</b> <b>and</b> customers intimacy has positive effect on customer satisfaction. The implication of this research is that bank should improve the credibility <b>and</b> <b>employee</b> image for creating banks <b>employees</b> <b>and</b> customers intimacy. Beside it, bank should keep their intimacy for satisfying the customers...|$|R

40|$|Corporate lawyers, {{investment}} bankers, engineers {{as well as}} {{many other}} types of knowledge workers in the US are expected to work seventy and eighty hour weeks routinely, with extra effort during particularly hectic times. Our research on software engineers working in China, India and Hungary indicates that such work hours are not inherent in the work. Rather work time standards and norms result from reciprocal interdependencies with three interconnected relationships: between <b>employees</b> <b>and</b> employer, <b>employees</b> <b>and</b> other <b>employees</b> <b>and</b> <b>employees</b> <b>and</b> their lives outside of work. The theoretical and practical implications of accounting for variations in work time standards and norms based on these three interconnected relationships are explored. ...|$|R

5|$|A {{principal}} cast of six actors received star billing in the show's first season. Poehler {{portrayed the}} lead character, Leslie Knope, the naive but well-meaning, eager-to-please {{deputy director of}} the parks and recreation department of the fictional town of Pawnee, Indiana. Also among the cast were Aziz Ansari as Tom Haverford, a sarcastic parks department <b>employee,</b> <b>and</b> Rashida Jones as Ann Perkins, a nurse who befriends Leslie and tries to help her turn a giant construction pit into a park. Daniels and Schur intended to cast Ansari and Jones (who previously appeared in The Office as Karen Filippelli) from the series' earliest stages of development, but the ultimate Parks and Recreation concept did not coalesce until they learned Poehler would be available to star. After her recruitment, the general concept of the series was established and the script for the pilot episode was written.|$|E
5|$|All three text-based games {{require the}} player {{to control a}} rocket {{attempting}} {{to land on the}} moon by entering instructions to the rocket in a turn-based system in response to the textual summary of its current position and velocity relative to the ground. In the original Lunar, players controlled only the amount of vertical thrust to apply, based on their current vertical velocity and remaining fuel, with each round representing one second of travel time. Rocket added a simple text-based graphical display of the distance from the ground in each round, while LEM added horizontal velocity and the ability to apply thrust at an angle. In 1970 and 1971, DEC <b>employee</b> <b>and</b> editor of the newsletter David H. Ahl converted two early mainframe games, Lunar and Hamurabi, from the FOCAL language to BASIC, partially as a demonstration of the language on the DEC PDP-8 minicomputer. Their popularity led him to start printing BASIC games in the DEC newsletter, both his own and reader submissions.|$|E
