5|$|Clark Kent (Tom Welling) {{sits in his}} loft {{holding a}} piece of coal, waiting for Lana Lang (Kristin Kreuk) to arrive. He then takes her to the Kawatche Caves, where they are transported to the Fortress of Solitude. Lana is in shock as she looks around at the Fortress. Clark expresses fear that Lana is <b>drifting</b> <b>away</b> because of his secret, so he decides to reveal his powers to her. Clark then uses the coal to make a diamond ring and proposes marriage. Afterward, Clark reveals {{what he did to}} his parents, Jonathan and Martha Kent (John Schneider and Annette O'Toole), who tell him that he is old enough to make {{decisions}} on his own without the advice of his father. After some initial doubt, Lana returns to the Kent farm to accept Clark's proposal.|$|E
5|$|Opening {{arguments}} by both {{prosecution and}} defense set up cases based on purported times of death. Basing their assertion on pathologist-given testimony that Jones had died {{about six hours}} after she ate lunch on May 26, the prosecution claimed that Jones had died more than 24 hours before Kinne and Boldizs found her body; defense attorneys argued that death had more likely occurred six to eight hours prior. Prosecutor J. Arnott Hill cited testimony by Chief of Detectives Lieutenant Harry Nesbitt and by Patricia Jones's husband, Walter, as evidence of Kinne's motive for the crime: the detective recalled statements by Kinne that she was afraid Jones was <b>drifting</b> <b>away</b> from her despite the financial support she offered him, and Jones testified that Kinne had {{told him she was}} pregnant by him and he had thereafter attempted to end the relationship.|$|E
5|$|The German team {{started the}} second half in a more {{positive}} mood with Jancker forcing a save from Schmeichel in the first minute of the restart. Basler was proving to be Bayern's most dangerous player, first firing a 30-yard shot towards goal and then setting up a header for Markus Babbel, who missed the ball entirely. United put together an attack when, after a healthy period of possession, Giggs sent in a cross towards Jesper Blomqvist who could only knock the ball over the bar after a desperate stretch. Another chance for Basler prompted Alex Ferguson to bring on striker Teddy Sheringham. Ottmar Hitzfeld responded with a substitution of his own, bringing on Mehmet Scholl, who immediately set up Stefan Effenberg for a long-range shot which went narrowly wide. Schmeichel kept his side in the game when tipping another Effenberg shot over the bar after 75 minutes. Scholl then almost scored from a delicate 20-yard chip after a run from Basler, but the ball bounced back off the post and {{into the arms of}} a relieved Schmeichel. With the game seemingly <b>drifting</b> <b>away</b> from the English side, Ferguson introduced striker Ole Gunnar Solskjær with 10 minutes remaining. The substitute immediately forced Kahn into a diving save with a header; it was the closest United had come to scoring all game. A minute later, Bayern missed a chance to secure the trophy when an overhead kick from Jancker came off the crossbar. As the game crept into the last five minutes, United's two substitutes forced Kahn into more saves, firstly through a Sheringham volley and then from another Solskjær header.|$|E

25|$|The young {{journalist}} began <b>drifting</b> <b>away</b> from National Liberal politics {{soon after}} 1876, {{when the group}} came to power with Ion Brătianu as Premier. According to many versions, Eminescu, who {{was working on the}} editorial staff of the main Conservative newspaper, Timpul, asked to be joined by Caragiale and the Transylvanian prose writer Ioan Slavici, who were both employed by the paper. This order of events remains unclear, and depends on sources saying that Eminescu was employed by the paper in March 1876. Other testimonies indicate that it was actually Eminescu who arrived last, beginning work in January 1878.|$|E
25|$|While the {{new system}} has {{seemingly}} narrowed {{the gap between the}} calendar's solar and lunar years, it has not made the calendar more accurate when compared against the actual tropical year. Indeed, it is slightly worse than the old system. (The Thandeikta solar year is about 23 minutes 51.4304 seconds ahead of the mean solar year whereas Makaranta is about 23 minutes 50.8704 seconds ahead.) As a result, the calendar has kept on <b>drifting</b> <b>away</b> from the actual solar year. The calendarists have periodically resorted to modifying its intercalation schedule, based on apparent reckoning, to keep pace, at the expense of making publishing future calendars more than a few years out all but impossible.|$|E

Henry's preceding speech to Suffolk, where he demands Suffolk not look at him, and then immediately demands that he wants to look into Suffolk's eyes was played by Alan Howard {{in such a way as}} to suggest that Henry was losing his grip on reality, and in response to this, Mirren played the speech in such a way as to engage Henry's mind in the here and now, focus his thoughts and prevent them <b>drifting</b> <b>away.</b>|$|E

25|$|The ship came adrift on 22October and {{the party}} spent three days recapturing her. She was {{evacuated}} on 12November due to crushing by ice, but it was deemed safe for the crew to return until 21December when the vessel was crushed beyond repair. On 22January 1904 the ship disappeared, either sinking or <b>drifting</b> <b>away</b> during night. The first attempt to reach the pole began on 7March with 26 men and Fiala acting as cook. Bad weather forced them {{to return to the}} base camp on 11March. A new attempt made on 25March lasted only two days before the expedition was forced to wait until the next spring before trying again. The men retreated to Cape Flora, although all but fourteen of them instead stopped at Camp Abruzzi. On 30April the most enthusiastic men continued towards Cape Flora, which they reached on 16May, the same day as one of the Norwegians died. A relief ship made two attempts to reach the party that summer, but failed.|$|E
25|$|Other {{equipment}} {{includes a}} leash (to stop the board from <b>drifting</b> <b>away</b> after a wipeout, {{and to prevent}} it from hitting other surfers), surf wax, traction pads (to keep a surfer's feet from slipping off the deck of the board), and fins (also known as skegs) which can either be permanently attached (glassed-on) or interchangeable. Sportswear designed or particularly suitable for surfing may be sold as boardwear (the term is also used in snowboarding). In warmer climates, swimsuits, surf trunks or boardshorts are worn, and occasionally rash guards; in cold water surfers can opt to wear wetsuits, boots, hoods, and gloves to protect them against lower water temperatures. A newer introduction is a rash vest with a thin layer of titanium to provide maximum warmth without compromising mobility. In recent years, there have been advancements in technology that have allowed surfers to pursue even bigger waves with added elements of safety. Big wave surfers are now experimenting with inflatable vests or colored dye packs to help decrease their odds of drowning.|$|E

500|$|By {{the early}} 1900s, Yavapai were <b>drifting</b> <b>away</b> from the San Carlos Reservation, and were {{requesting}} permission {{to live on}} the grounds of the original Camp Verde Reservation. In 1910, [...] was set aside as the Camp Verde Indian Reservation, and in the following decade added [...] in two parcels, which became the Middle Verde Indian Reservation. These two reservations were combined in 1937, to form the Camp Verde Yavapai-Apache tribe. Today, the reservation spans , in four separate locales. Tourism contributes greatly to the economy of the tribe, due largely to the presence of many preserved sites, including the Montezuma Castle National Monument. The Yavapai-Apache Nation is the amalgamation of two historically distinct Tribes both of whom occupied the Upper Verde prior to European invasion. The Tonto Apache, calling themselves Dilzhe'e, utilized the lands to the north, east and south; while the Wi:pukba or Northeastern Yavapai were using country to the north, the west and the south. It was the Upper Verde where they overlapped.|$|E
500|$|On {{their way}} to the International Space Station (ISS), the two discuss Stone's home life and her daughter, who died young in an accident. As they approach, they see that the ISS's crew has {{evacuated}} into one of its two Soyuz TMA capsules. The parachute of the remaining Soyuz TMA-14M has deployed, rendering the capsule useless for returning to Earth. Kowalski suggests using it to travel to the nearby Chinese space station Tiangong, [...] away, in order to board a Chinese module to return safely to Earth. Out of air and maneuvering power, the two try to grab onto the ISS as they fly by. Stone's leg gets entangled in the Soyuz's parachute cords and she grabs a strap on Kowalski's suit, but it soon becomes clear that the cords will not support them both. Despite Stone's protests, Kowalski detaches himself from the tether to save her from <b>drifting</b> <b>away</b> with him. Stone is pulled back towards the ISS, while Kowalski floats away to certain death. He continues to support her until he is out of communications range.|$|E
