ENGLISH ABSTRACT: This study explores {{patterns}} of separation and/or connection in the narratives of the respondent, a female farm worker {{living and working}} in the Western Cape, South Africa. The major objective of this qualitative case study is to examine the possible construction, co-existence and interaction of separation-connection themes in the reality of the respondent. Founded within the social constructivist tradition, an approach that assumes reality to be constructed through language and within relationships, a window on the respondent's narrative construction of her reality, relationships and separation-connection processes was obtained. To compliment the explorative nature and social constructionist approach of the study, Grounded Theory and Narrative Analysis were administrated. Through the analysis the two central themes, separation and connection, manifested on two different levels - firstly on a content level (what the participant has to say regarding the themes) and secondly on a process level (what is happening between participant and researcher). Findings provided a preliminary understanding of the techniques the respondent implores to construe a sense of separation and connection. Results confirmed the co-existence of separation-connection themes and indicated a possible interaction between the two constructs. Findings also provided a glimpse on the experiences and impact of the separation-connection process in the idiom of the respondent. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Die studie belig patrone van binding en/of skeiding in die narratiewe van die respondent, In vroulike plaaswerker in die Wes-Kaap, Suid-Afrika. Dié kwalitatiewe gevallestudie is gerig op In ondersoek van die potensiële konstruksie, naasbestaan en interaksie van binding- en/of skeidingstemas soos wat die respondent dit beleef en verwoord. Deur die <b>fundering</b> van die navorsing in die sosiaal-konstruktivistiese tradisie, In benadering wat glo dat die realiteit in verhoudings via taal gekonstrueer word, is toegang tot die respondent se narratiewe konstruksie van haar realiteit, verhoudings en binding- en/of skeidingstemas verkry. In ooreenstemming met sosiaal-konstruktivistiese aannames, het die data-analise Narratiewe Analise en Grounded Theory metodiek behels. Met behulp van die ontleding het die twee sentrale konsepte, binding en skeiding, op twee vlakke gemanifesteer - eerstens op In inhoudsvlak (dit wat die respondent daaroor vertel) en tweedens op In prosesvlak (dit wat tussen die respondent en die onderhoudvoerder gebeur). Die resultate bied In voorlopige verstaan van die wyses waarop die respondent binding en/of skeiding konstrueer.

40|$|AFRIKAANS: Visuele kommunikasie vorm die basis van ’n prakties-teologiese literatuurstudie, waar ondersoek gedoen word na die invloed van die massamedia en die populêre kunste op die kommunikasie-arbeid van die hedendaagse prediking. Naas die geskrewe en gesproke taal word in die betrokke studie vir ’n nuwe definiëring van taal gepleit: die visuele taal as selfstandige taalkode binne die homiletiek. Visuele taal is meer as blote literêre metafore wat die menslike verbeelding aangryp; eerder is dit die verskuiwing na ’n genre waar beeld as visuele metafoor die gelykwaardige funksie van die woord verrig. Sonder om die woord enigsins na ’n sekondêre posisie uit te skuif, word ’n pleidooi gelewer vir ‘n harmonieuse wisselwerking waar woord en beeld komplementerend op mekaar inwerk. Hierdie visuele taalkode sal in die prediking as legitieme preekstyl naas die oratoriese preekstyl aangeleer moet word, in wat in hierdie studie as visuele prediking bekend sal staan. In visuele prediking, waar beeldende prediking met multi-sensoriese prediking gekombineer word, word die visuele beeld die primêre kommunikasie-eenheid. In die betrokke studie is daar twee fokusse: ’n Prakties-teologiese <b>fundering</b> van hierdie nuwe visuele taal en veral visuele prediking binne ’n visueel-gedrewe konteks. Opstel van prakties-teologiese riglyne vir die implementering van visuele prediking binne die hedendaagse erediens. ENGLISH: Visual {{communication}} {{forms the}} basis of a practical-theological literature study, where the influence of the mass media and the popular arts on the communication toil of present-day preaching is investigated. Alongside of the written and spoken language, this study is a plea for the new defining of language: the visual language as an independent language code within homiletics. Visual language is more than only literary metaphors which grips the human imagination; rather it is the shift to a genre where image as a visual metaphor performs an equally similar task to the word. Without moving the word to a secondary position, an argument is made for a harmonious interplay where word and image can work complementary to each other. This visual language code should be learned as a legitimate style of preaching besides the oratorical preaching style, which will be known in this study as visual preaching. In visual preaching, where image preaching and multi-sensory preaching are combined, the visual image will become the primary communication unit. In this study there are two focuses: A Practical-theological foundation of this new visual language and especially visual preaching within a visual-driven context. A composition of practical-theological guidelines for the implementing of visual preaching within the present-day church service. Regarding the first focus of the study, theological reflection surrounding the understanding of the second commandment with regards to image within the liturgy and especially homiletics, as well as the dualistic perspective of the church in the past is done, while a theology of incarnation, creation, ‘Imago Dei’ and the Word is established {{in order to create a}} solid basis for visual preaching. Combined herewith, there is also a look at the influence of the visual media and communication on the visual generation, namely Generation X, Y and Z, with specific focus on the postmodern context in which these three generations function. Following this, a new practical-theological perspective on the human imagination, human emotion, human creativity, the visual narrator, transcendence, participation, multi-sensory communication and visual presentation opens the way for effective visual preaching. Regarding the second focus of the study, five categories surrounding visual images can be distinguished: graphic images – pictures, statues, artistic designs and photos; optical images – mirror images and light projections; perceptual images – sensory data, theatre props, illustrative aids; imaginary images – dreams, memories, ideas and imagination; verbal images – metaphors, analogies and narratives. For the purpose of this study the focus is mainly on the first category: graphic and visual images, also including visual presentations as it pertains to the performing arts like drama, dance and mime, as well as the usage of visual illustrations. In conclusion, practical guidelines accompanied by concrete sermons within the three categories of visual preaching as it is suggested in this study, namely the visual image sermon, which concentrates on visual images on a flat surface or screen, the visual presentation sermon, which accomodates visual methaphores as it is presented by the visual arts and illustrations on a stage in the liturgical area, and the visual imagination sermon, which interacts with the human imagination by the use of visual methaphorical language, are submitted.

40|$|What {{works and}} how?  The common factors model {{as a basis}} for psychosocial support in social workPsychosocial support in social work in the Netherlands is generalistic, eclectic and integral. Research into the active {{components}} therein is scarce. One of the reasons is that the medical model, a meta-model that explains what works in therapy, counseling and support, dominates. The core of the medical model is that specific methods and techniques are remedial for specific problems. The conditions for a method to be effective are: a diagnosis of a specific problem, a psychological explanation of that problem, a theory of change, and the application of (evidence-based) specific techniques. The generalistic, eclectic way of working in social work does not fit in with the medical model.  The medical model-explanation of what works is strongly present in the development of methods in social work. For example, the 130 methods in the Database Effective Social Interventions (Movisie) are all described {{along the lines of the}} medical model. A consequence of the medical model is the ever growing development of specific treatments for new or more specific diagnoses. As a result, social work support threatens to become increasingly specific. A second consequence is that the view on the special qualities and active components of social work support remains underexposed and, therefore, not well understood and studied. That makes improvement difficult.  Furthermore, both the perspective and the goal of social work do not correspond with the medical model. An essential aspect of social work is the contextual vision: how problems and solutions are embedded in the social environment and daily life of people. The integral support of people in and with their social context is the concretization thereof. The medical model on the other hand decontextualizes people, it often translates life problems into psychological problems that can be "repaired", isolated from the context of which they are part and from the people that can contribute to its solutions.  The purpose of social work – empowerment – also does not correspond well with the medical model. Unlike the medical model, empowerment does not focus on what is missing, insufficient or "sick", but on people’s resources, on what goes well in life or what is "healthy". Empowerment cannot be achieved through interventions according to the medical model. Empowerment as an "end product" through a protocol with prescribed technical procedures and predetermined goals misses the essence of empowerment. Empowerment is a process that gets its content and shape in the dialogue between two equal partners. The process of the clients themselves and not the method is essential. Which facet of empowerment is strengthened, in what (life) area, how that happens and what the end result shall be, it all depends on and is developed through that dialogue. To coach and support that dialogue is the essence of social work.  Based on the work of Wampold and Imel (20015), supplemented with (Dutch) social work research, it becomes possible to describe the lack of evidence for the efficacy of specific factors.  Furthermore, the possibilities and scope of the non-specific way of working is brought forward. The common factors are seen as an alternative explanation of what works. The factors that are common to any kind of psychological assistance are a client in his context and a therapist/social worker. Together they create a working relationship (alliance). This relationship awakens placebo effects like hope and is, because of its purpose, structured in a certain way (the method). Scientific evidence connects all those five factors to the outcome. The common factors perspective shows that psychological assistance is an interpersonal, relational phenomenon, not an instrumental one.  The common factors perspective changes the view on clients. They are not seen as the recipient of the treatment but as self-helpers who actively maintain the relationship and direct content and goal of the conversations. They have created their own Theory of Change from life experiences. That theory determines what they want and can change and how they can do it in the best way. This active role of clients makes psychosocial assistance a co-operation. A collaboration in which both participants together provide new direction and meaning to problems and solutions is called co-construction. In that, the client and the social worker are equal, each with their own specific expertise. The client is an expert of his own experiences, ideas, expectations, goals, resources. The social worker is an expert in process counseling: in listening, asking questions, and giving information so that he enables the client to make use of what psychosocial support has to offer for achieving his goals.  We describe a common factors model that supports and shapes social work support. The model builds on the model of Wampold and Imel (2015) and extends it with the concept of co-construction. In this model, the psychosocial support has four active components: the co-construction of the (personal) working relationship, of hope, of solutions and of the evaluation. The model emphasizes that psychosocial support is an interpersonal process. It points to the importance of the dialogue and the role of the unique characteristics of the participants in it. In addition, it gives room for eclectic work and specific factors. Moreover, it is open to the complexity of problems and the influence of social and cultural aspects the clients brings with him. These (inter) personal and contextual aspects are essential in social work.   SAMENVATTING Wat werkt er en hoe? Het common factors model als basis voor de psychosociale hulpverlening in het sociaal werkPsychosociale hulpverlening in sociaal werk is generalistisch, eclectisch en integraal. Onderzoek naar de werkzame ingrediënten daarin is schaars. Eén van de redenen is dat het medisch model, een metamodel dat verklaart wat werkt in therapie, counseling en hulpverlening, domineert. De kern van het medisch model is dat specifieke methoden en technieken helend zijn voor specifieke problemen. De medisch model-verklaring van wat werkt is sterk aanwezig bij de ontwikkeling van methoden in maatschappelijk werk. Het medisch model is moeilijk te verenigen met het sociaal werk. Niet alleen de niet-specifieke, generalistische manier van werken in het sociaal werk, maar ook de contextuele visie op problemen en oplossingen en het doel van sociaal werk – empowerment – sluiten niet goed aan op het medisch model.  Op basis van het werk van Wampold en Imel (2015) en aangevuld met (Nederlands) sociaal werk- onderzoek, wordt in dit artikel het gebrek aan bewijs voor de werkzaamheid van specifieke factoren en de mogelijkheden en reikwijdte van de niet-specifieke generalistische werkwijze beschreven. De “common factors” worden gezien als een alternatieve verklaring van wat er werkt. De factoren hebben een stevige basis in wetenschappelijk onderzoek en correleren met het effect van hulpverlening.  In hoofdlijnen wordt een common factors model beschreven als een wetenschappelijke <b>fundering</b> van de psychosociale hulpverlening in het sociaal werk. In dit model heeft die hulpverlening vier werkzame factoren: de co-constructie van de (persoonlijke) werkrelatie, van hoop, van oplossingen en van de evaluatie.  Het model benadrukt dat wat werkt in de psychosociale hulp in het sociaal werk een interpersoonlijk proces is, geen instrumenteel. Het ondersteunt het belang van de dialoog en de rol van de unieke kenmerken van de deelnemers daarin. Het staat open voor de complexiteit van de problemen en de invloed van sociale en culturele aspecten die de cliënten meebrengen. Daarnaast biedt het ruimte voor eclectisch werk en de inbreng van specifieke factoren. Deze (inter) persoonlijke en contextuele aspecten en de flexibiliteit in het methodisch handelen zijn essentieel in het sociaal werk om maatwerk te kunnen leveren aan een grote diversiteit van cliënten en hun complexe problemen...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{priorities}} of research funding bodies govern the research agenda, which {{has important implications}} for the provision of evidence to inform policy. This study examines the research funding landscape for maternal health interventions in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). METHODS: This review draws on a database of 2340 academic papers collected through a large-scale systematic mapping of research on maternal health interventions in LMICs published from 2000 - 2012. The names of <b>funders</b> acknowledged on each paper were extracted and categorised into groups. It was noted whether support took a specific form, such as staff fellowships or drugs. Variations between <b>funder</b> types across regions and topics of research were assessed. RESULTS: Funding sources were only reported in 1572 (67 %) of articles reviewed. A high number of different <b>funders</b> (685) were acknowledged, but only a few dominated funding of published research. Bilateral <b>funders,</b> national research agencies and private foundations were most prominent, while private companies were most commonly acknowledged for support 'in kind'. The intervention topics and geographic regions of research funded by the various <b>funder</b> types had much in common, with HIV being the most common topic and sub-Saharan Africa being the most common region for all types of <b>funder.</b> Publication outputs rose substantially for several <b>funder</b> types over the period, with the largest increase among bilateral <b>funders.</b> CONCLUSIONS: A considerable number of organisations provide funding for maternal health research, but a handful account for most funding acknowledgements. Broadly speaking, these organisations address similar topics and regions. This suggests little coordination between funding agencies, risking duplication and neglect of some areas of maternal health research, and limiting the ability of organisations to develop the specialised skills required for systematically addressing a research topic. Greater transparency in reporting of funding is required, as the role of <b>funders</b> in the research process is often unclear...|$|R
