40|$|About {{half of all}} {{deaths in}} {{developed}} countries are caused by cardiovascular disease. It {{is well known that}} cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk can be influenced by diet, but optimal dietary content of fatty acids continues to be debated. The effect of fatty acid composition of <b>ground</b> <b>beef</b> on selected cardiovascular disease risk indicators was evaluated with two primary goals. The first goal was to document effects of <b>ground</b> <b>beef</b> fatty acid composition on plasma lipoprotein concentrations, whereas the second goal was {{to determine the effects of}} <b>ground</b> <b>beef</b> fatty acid composition on gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). In both studies the results were compared between men and women. Twelve men and women over age of 45 out of initially 15 completed a two-way crossover design. Subjects consumed five, 114 -g <b>ground</b> <b>beef</b> patties per week for 5 -wk periods separated by a 3 -wk washout period. Patties contained on average 20 % fat and monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) : saturated fatty acid (SFA) of 0. 8 and 1. 1 for low- MUFA (conventional) <b>ground</b> <b>beef</b> high-MUFA (premium) <b>ground</b> <b>beef</b> patties, respectively. Blood was collected from each subject before and at the end of each diet period. Overall, the <b>ground</b> <b>beef</b> interventions decreased total plasma cholesterol, triacylglycerol, and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol. Plasma concentrations of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol decreased and increased, respectively with premium <b>ground</b> <b>beef</b> consumption. The change in HDL cholesterol was significant in women but not in men suggesting that premium <b>ground</b> <b>beef</b> consumption had a greater impact on women than in men. For the second goal PBMC were isolated and the expression of selected genes was quantified by real-time PCR. ATP-binding cassette A 1, ATP-binding cassette G 1, and low-density lipoprotein receptor relative expression was increased with premium <b>ground</b> <b>beef</b> consumption. A significant increase was seen in stearoyl-Coenzyme-A desaturase 1 expression after premium <b>ground</b> <b>beef</b> treatment. With the exception of stearoyl-Coenzyme-A desaturase 1, all these genes were down-regulated with conventional <b>ground</b> <b>beef</b> consumption. Both sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1 and mediator complex subunit 1 were down-regulated after each beef patty treatment, but the effect was significant after consuming conventional <b>ground</b> <b>beef.</b> This suggests that genes involved in cholesterol metabolism were down-regulated with conventional <b>ground</b> <b>beef</b> consumption; whereas genes related to lipogenesis were up-regulated with premium <b>ground</b> <b>beef</b> consumption.

In general, ground muscles from fed cows appeared darker and redder than ground muscles from steers. Chronological age did not affect <b>ground</b> <b>beef</b> color stability of muscles from fed cows. Use of steroid implants or [Beta]-agonists did not affect ground muscle color stability of fed steers or fed cows. Overall color stability varied more in muscle from steers than from fed cows.

Ground muscles from fed cows had better color stability properties than ground muscles from steer. When muscles of various color stability were blended to make <b>ground</b> <b>beef</b> and packaged in high-oxygen modified atmosphere (HiO[subscript] 2 MAP), high color stability muscles (≥ 75 %) in formulations maximizes display color life; however, inclusion of low color stability muscles (≥ 25 %) in <b>ground</b> <b>beef</b> formulations had deleterious effects on <b>ground</b> <b>beef</b> color life. <b>Ground</b> semimembranosus (SM) from dairy cows exhibited darker initial color than <b>ground</b> SM from <b>beef</b> cows when packaged in HiO[subscript] 2 MAP.

Under vacuum or non-oxygen conditions, however, irradiation did not influence the redness of <b>ground</b> <b>beef.</b> Also, the red color of <b>ground</b> <b>beef</b> was maintained {{even after the}} irradiated beef was exposed to aerobic conditions. Vacuum-packaged irradiated <b>ground</b> <b>beef</b> had lower metmyoglobin content and lower oxidation-reduction potential than the aerobically packaged ones. Irradiating <b>ground</b> <b>beef</b> under vacuum-packaging conditions was also advantageous in preventing lipid oxidation and aldehydes production. Vacuum-packaged irradiated beef, however, produced high levels of sulfur volatiles during irradiation and maintained their levels during storage, {{which resulted in the}} production of characteristic irradiation off-odor. Double-packaging (V 3 /A 3 : vacuum-packaging during irradiation and the first 3 days of storage and then aerobic-packaging for the remaining 3 days) was an effective alternative in maintaining original beef color (red), and minimizing lipid oxidation and irradiation off-odor. The levels of off-odor volatiles in double-packaged irradiated <b>ground</b> <b>beef</b> were comparable to that of aerobically packaged ones, and the degree of lipid oxidation and color changes were close to those of vacuum-packaged ones. Ascorbic acid at 200 ppm level was not effective in preventing color changes and lipid oxidation in irradiated <b>ground</b> <b>beef</b> under aerobic conditions, but was helpful in minimizing quality changes in doublepackaged irradiated <b>ground</b> <b>beef.</b> This suggested that preventing oxygen contact from meat during irradiation and early storage period (V 3 /A 3 double-packaging) and doublepackaging+ascorbic acid combination are excellent strategies to prevent off-odor production and color changes in irradiated <b>ground</b> <b>beef.</b> Developing methods that can prevent quality changes of irradiated beef is important for the implication of irradiation, which will improve the safety of beef...|$|R
