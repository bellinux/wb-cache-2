5|$|Remains of Nesomys narindaensis {{have been}} found at the sites of Antsingiavo, Ambongonambakoa, and Ambatomainty <b>in</b> <b>northwestern</b> Madagascar, which are late Pleistocene (126,000 to 10,000 years ago) and Holocene (less than 10,000 years ago) in age. Nesomys is a rare element of the rodent fauna, which is {{dominated}} by multiple species of Eliurus and Macrotarsomys. Modern Nesomys live {{on the ground in}} eastern (N.audeberti and N.rufus) and western (N.lambertoni) Madagascar. The only surviving western species, N.lambertoni, is restricted to a relict humid karst area; the presence of N.narindaensis and Brachyuromys mahajambaensis suggests that the past environment <b>in</b> <b>northwestern</b> Madagascar was also more humid. Subfossil remains of Nesomys have been recorded from some other localities <b>in</b> <b>northwestern</b> Madagascar, but these have not been described.|$|E

5|$|Smaller {{communities}} are served via heliports which connect with hubs located at Upernavik Airport in the Upernavik Archipelago <b>in</b> <b>northwestern</b> Greenland; at Uummannaq Heliport in the Uummannaq Fjord region <b>in</b> <b>northwestern</b> Greenland; at Ilulissat and Aasiaat Airports in the Disko Bay region in western Greenland; at Qaqortoq and Nanortalik Heliports in southern Greenland; and at Tasiilaq Heliport in southeastern Greenland. Of the 45 heliports in use, 8 are primary and {{equipped with a}} tarmac, a terminal building and permanent staff. The other heliports are helistops with either a gravel or grass landing area. Often helicopters need to make more than one flight for each connection to a fixed-wing flight because of passenger capacity, causing longer total travel time.|$|E
5|$|Teeth of Brachytarsomys mahajambaensis {{have been}} found at the sites of Antsingiavo, Belobaka, and Ambatomainty <b>in</b> <b>northwestern</b> Madagascar, which are late Pleistocene (126,000 to 10,000 years ago) and Holocene (less than 10,000 years ago) in age. Brachytarsomys is a rare element of the rodent fauna, which is {{dominated}} by multiple species of Eliurus and Macrotarsomys. Modern Brachytarsomys are large rats that live in trees and eat fruits at middle to high altitudes. The modern, dry environment <b>in</b> <b>northwestern</b> Madagascar is decidedly inhospitable to these animals, and they no longer occur there; the former presence of B.mahajambaensis could indicate that the region was more humid in the past.|$|E
