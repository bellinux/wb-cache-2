The mRNA of <b>the</b> human <b>oppo</b> 1 gene (h-oppo 1) was expressed exclusively in the testis, and the 30 kDa protein encoded by the mRNA was detected in human testis and sperm. Immunohistochemical analyses showed that human OPPO 1 protein was localized in the ¯agellae of ejaculated sperm. A human genomic DNA database search indicated that the h-oppo 1 gene mapped to chromosome 17.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>OPPO</b> VOOC (Voltage Open Loop Multi-step Constant-Current Charging) Flash Charging {{system is}} a {{proprietary}} rapid-charge technology created by OPPO Electronics, which, at present, is able to charge certain OPPO devices from 0 to 75% in just 30 minutes. In contrast to Qualcomm's QuickCharge technology increasing the voltage during fast charging, VOOC uses a higher current than normal USB 2.0 charging. Thus, VOOC operates at 5V and 4A. For transferring higher currents of 4A, VOOC requires both a special wall adapter and special cables. The VOOC Flash Charge circuit technology reportedly lowers {{the temperature of the}} charging adapter, and creates an interface from the adapter to the phone, which improves the speed and safety of the charge.|$|R
