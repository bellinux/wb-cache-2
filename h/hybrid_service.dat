We explore a few issues related to <b>hybrid</b> <b>services</b> and propose a platform, as well as a set of components, to facilitate their creation and deployment. The existing infrastructure is only required to generate specific events when requests for <b>hybrid</b> <b>services</b> are detected. We present the design of a service layer, based on Java, that handles the treatment of these special requests. Our service layer is provided with a set of generic components realized as Java Beans.

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims to {{identify}} the dimensions of service quality {{in the case of}} <b>hybrid</b> <b>services.</b> Design/methodology/approach – The service quality dimensions are identified using an exploratory factor analysis (EFA). Next {{the reliability and validity of}} the factors are established through confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) using AMOS. Findings – The paper identifies nine service quality dimensions in the <b>hybrid</b> <b>services</b> – customer service, staff competence, reputation, price, tangibles, ease of subscription, technology security and information quality, technology convenience, and technology usage easiness and reliability. Practical implications – The various dimensions of service quality should be viewed as the levers of improving perceived service quality in the minds of its current customers. Identifying the service quality dimensions in hybrid contexts can offer service providers valuable insights regarding on which aspects of the service to focus in order to improve customer satisfaction, loyalty, and commitment to the firm. Originality/value – This paper introduces the concept of <b>hybrid</b> <b>services,</b> wherein a mix of technology and human interaction is used to produce and deliver <b>services.</b> Furthermore, since <b>hybrid</b> <b>services</b> have received little attention in the literature, the study addresses this gap by identifying a set of dimensions that are relevant for measuring <b>service</b> quality in <b>hybrid</b> contexts...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. For solving complex problems, we {{advocate}} constructing “social computers” which combine {{software and}} human services. However, to date, human capabilities cannot be easily programmed into applications {{in a similar}} way like software capabilities. Existing approaches exploiting human capabilities via crowds do not support well on-demand, proactive, team-based human computation. In this paper, we explore a new way to virtualize, provision and program human capabilities using cloud computing concepts and service delivery models. We propose novel methods for modeling clouds of human-based services and combine human-based services with software-based services to establish clouds of <b>hybrid</b> <b>services.</b> In our model, we present common APIs, similar to APIs for software services, to access individual and team-based compute units in clouds of human-based services. Based on that, we propose frameworks and programming primitives for <b>hybrid</b> <b>services.</b> We illustrate our concepts via some examples of using our cloud APIs and existing cloud APIs for software. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – <b>hybrid</b> <b>service</b> {{discovery}} is introduced as an efficient service discovery protocol in mobile ad-hoc grid witch {{has a good}} compromise between response time and network traffic overhead. In this paper we modify the basic idea of this protocol called Zone. We use multi-level zone in our proposal and called the protocol as multi-level <b>hybrid</b> <b>service</b> discovery protocol. Our algorithm tries to provide the advantage of larger zone with only a little increase of network traffic overhead. We used two levels of zone, inner zone and outer zone which we called internal zone and external zone, respectively. Difference between two zones issued from their advertisement frequency. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm has better performance in network’s traffic and response time than traditional <b>hybrid</b> <b>service</b> discovery protocol.

40|$|In cloud {{computing}} {{it is assumed}} that a single cloud with increased service demands because of the limitations of the hardware and software resources, can encounter overload. Cloud Federation is an ideal solution to overcome these problems. There are different types of single and hybrid clouds in Cloud Federation.

Therefore, measuring the quality of a single cloud <b>service</b> and <b>hybrid</b> cloud <b>service</b> in cloud federation carries much importance. To this end, the models based on the initial model were used to measure the Quality of Service.

40|$|Abstract — Mobile {{users of}} future {{ubiquitous}} environments require novel means for locating relevant services available {{in their daily}} surroundings, where relevance has a user-specific definition. In this paper, we propose the <b>hybrid</b> <b>service</b> provisioning model which complements the traditional model of interaction service provider to consumer with peer-to-peer functionalities. In addition to being notified proactively and in a context-aware manner about services available in the surroundings, users can generate several types of contextual messages, attach them to services or to the environment, and share them with other peers. We have designed and implemented a platform that supports this <b>hybrid</b> <b>service</b> provisioning model. The current application prototype runs on commercial smart phones. To demonstrate the feasibility and technical deployability of our approach, we conducted field trials in which the research subject was a community of recreational boaters. I...|$|E

40|$|The work {{reported}} here addresses the {{modeling and simulation}} of a hybrid network that conforms to <b>Hybrid</b> Internet <b>Service,</b> which is an Internet access currently com-mercialized by Hughes Network System. The objective is to research and discover per-formance enhancement techniques for <b>Hybrid</b> Internet <b>Service.</b> <b>Hybrid</b> Internet <b>Service</b> intends to provide Internet end-users with high bandwidth by delivering packets over a satellite channel. It {{takes advantage of the}} fact that the vast majority of Internet end-users don't send as much data as they receive. However, long delays experienced over the satellite channel (in the case of a GEO satellite) have catastrophic consequences on the overall throughput with Commercial-O-The-Shelf TPC/IP stacks. This prob-lem is addressed by the Asymmetric TCP/IP protocol implemented within a gateway, the hybrid gateway. The hybrid gateway acts as a go-between for the server and the end-user. The hybrid gateway both acknowledges packets on behalf of the end-user and advertises a larger window to the server. We have implemented the Asymmetric TCP/IP within the hybrid gateway with OPNET, which is an industrial strength, pop...|$|R
