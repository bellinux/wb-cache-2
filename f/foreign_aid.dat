40|$|This {{research}} project is an endeavor {{to ascertain the}} possible effects public opinion has on foreign policy spending. Foreign policy spending was broken down into three separate areas to be tested: (1) <b>foreign</b> economic <b>aid,</b> (2) <b>foreign</b> military <b>aid,</b> and (3) defense spending. The bulk of past literature on this subject has focused on defense spending so this study is an expansion {{as well as a}} replication of previous research. The findings were interesting showing public opinion to have a strong correlation with defense spending and a weaker but significant correlation with <b>foreign</b> military <b>aid</b> while having no positive correlation with <b>foreign</b> economic <b>aid.</b> This indicated that defense spending decision and <b>foreign</b> military <b>aid</b> decisions, which are widely considered to fall under the general rubric of “high politics”, are more easily affected by public opinion than the “low politics” of <b>foreign</b> military <b>aid.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examined}} the relationship between health care expenditure and economic growth in Nigeria for the period 1970 - 2009. We employed the multivariate cointegration technique proposed by Johansen and found the existence of at least one cointegrating vector describing a long run relationship among economic growth, <b>foreign</b> <b>aids,</b> health expenditure, total saving and population. This is further confirmed by the Hassen Parameter instability test. The cointegrating equation however shows some deviations in terms of the signs of the coefficients of <b>foreign</b> <b>aids</b> and health expenditure which partly may be attributed to some diversification of <b>foreign</b> <b>aids</b> to other uses or that the allocation to health services is grossly inadequate. It is therefore suggested that an appreciable proportion of the national budget be allocated to the health care services to have a more robust health care programmes capable of fostering economic growth in Nigeria. </p...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is submitted in partial {{fulfillment of}} the requirements for the degree of Masters in Procurement and Supply Management, 2015. Cataloged from PDF version of thesis report. Includes bibliographical references (page 76 - 81). Most of the big projects are being implanted in Bangladesh, financed by <b>foreign</b> <b>aids</b> from different international organizations. In FY 2014 - 15, the <b>foreign</b> <b>aids</b> amounting BDT 4472 (mn) was allocated in the national budget. E-procurement adoptions make purchasing activities more effective {{in terms of both}} time and cost. The objective {{of the study was to}} assess the adoption of e-procurement and value addition to the <b>foreign</b> <b>aided</b> projects in Bangladesh. Organizational-Technological-Environmental research model was used. Data collection techniques focused on questionnaire. Random sampling was used in this study. The result showed that 88. 89 % of the participants were from public entities and 11. 11 % were from others. Management’s positive attitude toward adoption of e-procurement helped allocating enough resources from available funds that brought the business partner close to each other. It also increased the partner’s firm efficiencies. E-procurementwas compatible with most organization’s business operations and existing information but not with those of the supplier. Thecomplexity was much experienced on business partner operation site. Technological infrastructures in most organization were sufficient. Organizations were benefited from cost saving after implementing e-procurement process though the initial installation cost was not negligible. Pressure for adoption of e-procurement came from competition among organization but not from supplier demand. Core value of effectiveness and efficiency of e-procurement acted as normative pressure. Regulatory body of Bangladesh and foreign financing agencies had an influence over the adoption of e-procurement. But regulatory bodies did not perform active role as it was expected. To ensure good governance, transparency, eradication of corruption and building people trust on procurement process is necessary. To achieving the goals “Digital Bangladesh Vision 2021 ” adoption of e-procurement in all <b>foreign</b> <b>aided</b> projects is crucially needed. Muhammad Anisur RahmanM.

Most were moderates who did not object to Joseph II's reforms in principle but because they had been levied on the territories without consultation. They were supported financially by the clergy.

5|$|Abu Nuwar's enmity with Glubb Pasha, the Arab Legion's {{powerful}} British {{chief of}} staff, his insistence on establishing Arab command over {{the army and}} his influence with Hussein led the latter to dismiss Glubb Pasha and appoint Abu Nuwar in his place. However, Abu Nuwar's ardent support for the pan-Arabist policies of Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser contributed to Jordan's increasing isolation from the UK and the US, which were major sources of <b>foreign</b> <b>aid</b> to Jordan. At the same time, existing dissatisfaction with Abu Nuwar's leadership by palace officials and veteran Bedouin army units culminated into violent confrontations at the large army barracks in Zarqa between royalist and Arab nationalist units. Two principal accounts emerged regarding the events at Zarqa, with the royalist version holding that the incident was an abortive coup by Abu Nuwar against Hussein, and the dissident version asserting {{that it was a}} staged, American-backed counter-coup by Hussein against the pan-Arabist movement in Jordan. In any case, Abu Nuwar resigned and was allowed to leave Jordan for Syria. He was subsequently sentenced to 15 years in absentia.|$|E
5|$|Concerns {{about the}} {{proposed}} measure—particularly its {{denial of the}} right to appeal—were voiced by the UK, US, and Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace. The US, UK, IMF, and World Bank threatened that if Zimbabwe implemented the law, it would forfeit <b>foreign</b> <b>aid</b> packages. Responding to the criticisms, the government removed the ban on court appeals from the bill, which was then passed as law. Over the following few years, hundreds of thousands of acres of largely white-owned land were expropriated. In April 1994, a newspaper investigation found that not all of this was redistributed to landless blacks; much of the expropriated land was being leased to ministers and senior officials such as Witness Mangwede, who was leased a 3000-acre farm in Hwedza. Responding to this scandal, in 1994 the UK government—which had supplied £44 million for land redistribution—halted its payments.|$|E
