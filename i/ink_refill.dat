50|$|A {{continuous}} ink system (CIS), {{also known}} as a continuous ink supply system, a continuous flow system, an automatic <b>ink</b> <b>refill</b> system, a bulk feed ink system, or an off-axis ink delivery system is a method for delivering a large volume of liquid ink to a comparatively small inkjet printhead. Many business and professional grade printers incorporate a continuous ink system in their design to increase printing capacity.|$|E
5000|$|With {{commercial}} competition increasing upon the Parker jotter's classic metal <b>ink</b> <b>refill</b> cartridge design from low cost generic copies produced in China, as Parker's unique design patent for the cartridge expired, Parker's sales {{began to be}} drastically adversely affected. In July 2009 Newell Rubbermaid Inc. in response announced that it had decided to close down the Parker production factory at Newhaven in England with the dismissal of 180 employees from the facility, and relocate production to France. The following month, Newell Rubbermaid Inc. announced that the factory in Janesville, Wisconsin, was also to close the remaining operation there producing Parker Pens (which eliminated a further 153 manufacturing jobs). The company press release stated: [...] "This decision {{is a response to}} structural issues accelerated by market trends and is in no way a reflection on the highly valued work performed by our Janesville employees over the years." [...] Newell Rubbermaid offered 'transitional employment services' along with severance pay in compensation to the dismissed workforce.|$|E

Sultan Ahmed III at one point was so intrigued by the ink that Seyyid used in his calligraphy, that he sent a messenger to learn the secret. Seyyid sent back a full inkwell with the messenger. When the Sultan received the gift, he reportedly emptied the <b>ink,</b> <b>refilled</b> the inkwell with gold, and sent it back.|$|R
50|$|Ink {{cartridges}} {{are typically}} priced at $13 to $75 per ounce ($1,664 to $9,600 per gallon) of <b>ink,</b> meaning that <b>refill</b> cartridges sometimes cost a substantial {{fraction of the}} cost of the printer. To save money, many people use compatible ink cartridges from a vendor other than the printer manufacturer. Others use aftermarket <b>inks,</b> <b>refilling</b> their own <b>ink</b> cartridges using a kit that includes bulk ink. The high cost of cartridges has also provided an incentive for counterfeiters to supply cartridges falsely claiming to be made by the original manufacturer. The print cartridge industry lost an estimated $3 billion in 2009 due to this, according to an International Data Corporation estimate.|$|R

50|$|An inkjet refill kit {{is a set}} {{of tools}} and a certain amount of <b>ink</b> used to <b>refill</b> <b>ink</b> cartridges. The {{specific}} tools and the amount or type of ink depends on which cartridge the kit is designed for. The purpose of an inkjet refill kit for consumers is that it offers a low-cost alternative to buying new cartridges.|$|R
50|$|Franchises quickly {{spread through}} 2006, as {{locations}} opened across Canada, the United States, and Mexico. ranking first in category for the 2005 franchise 500 (A {{listing of the}} top franchisors globally) and opening 260 stores by 2007. As of June 2005, the chain had 222 locations—146 in Canada, 73 in the United States, and 3 in Mexico. At that point there were 1103 total stores that specialized in offering <b>ink</b> cartridge <b>refill</b> services in North America and Island Ink-Jet had captured 20% of the in-store <b>ink</b> cartridge <b>refill</b> marketplace. It was second-largest ink-refill chain, behind only Cartridge World. A large portion of these locations were in mall kiosks.|$|R

The brand is {{currently}} owned by The Equipment leasing company ltd. and based in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada, and locations operate under a franchising business model. The chain offer a printer <b>ink</b> cartridge <b>refill</b> service and sell several varieties of ink cartridges and toner cartridges including remanufactured cartridges.|$|R
50|$|Product {{churning}} {{is similar}} to the razor and blades business model. This involves selling a basic product at a loss (or low profit margin), but receiving very high profit margins on associated products that are necessary for the basic product's continued usage. Examples of this strategy include razors (and their blades), computer printers (and their <b>ink</b> cartridge <b>refills),</b> cell phones (and their usage time), and cameras (and film).|$|R
5000|$|Compatible ink is {{manufactured}} {{for several}} types of machines including fax machines, laser printers, inkjet printers, multifunction printers, and copiers. Aside from compatible products, three other sources of consumables are also available to supply these machines, including OEM brand ink and toner, remanufactured toner and <b>ink</b> cartridges, and <b>refilled</b> <b>ink</b> and toner cartridges. Compatible ink manufacturers differentiate their product by using all new parts, whereas other ink replacements recycle used OEM parts.. Compatible ink and toner products tend to offer greater value than original, genuine OEM ink and toner cartridges. Reducing cost for the end user, ink and toner manufactured by third party manufacturers is classified as compatible when consisting of new parts for a third party printer.|$|R
50|$|Consumers can <b>refill</b> <b>ink</b> {{cartridges}} {{themselves with}} a kit, or they can take the cartridge to a refiller or re-manufacturer where ink is pumped back into the cartridge. PC World reports that refilled cartridges have higher failure rates, print fewer pages than new cartridges, and demonstrate more on-page problems like streaking, curling, and colour bleed.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} refill kits come with either: bottles of black <b>ink</b> for black <b>refill</b> kits; or one bottle each of cyan, magenta and yellow for color refill kits; or one bottle each of photo cyan, photo magenta and photo black for photo-color refill kits; or {{combination}} of all colors for combo refill kits.|$|R

5000|$|Over the years, {{business}} models have {{become much more}} sophisticated. The bait and hook business model (also {{referred to as the}} [...] "razor and blades business model" [...] or the [...] "tied products business model") was introduced in the early 20th century. This involves offering a basic product at a very low cost, often at a loss (the [...] "bait"), then charging compensatory recurring amounts for refills or associated products or services (the [...] "hook"). Examples include: razor (bait) and blades (hook); cell phones (bait) and air time (hook); computer printers (bait) and <b>ink</b> cartridge <b>refills</b> (hook); and cameras (bait) and prints (hook). A variant of this model is Adobe, a software developer that gives away its document reader free of charge but charges several hundred dollars for its document writer.|$|R

50|$|While {{cartridges}} are mess-free {{and more}} convenient to refill than bottle filling, converter and bottle filling systems are still sold. Non-cartridge filling systems {{tend to be}} slightly more economical {{in the long run}} since ink is generally less expensive in bottles than in cartridges. Advocates of bottle-based filling systems also cite less waste of plastic for the environment, a wider selection of inks, easier cleaning of pens (as drawing the ink in through the nib helps dissolve old ink), and the ability to check and <b>refill</b> <b>inks</b> at any time.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a novel design of an acoustic-wave liquid ejector by using PDMS soft-lithography. Both annular patterned lens membrane and piezoelectric transducer {{are designed to}} be replaceable to avoid ink clogging on the ejector surface. With the integration of an external siphoning system, the ejector is capable of jetting downward rather than only upward and <b>refilling</b> <b>ink</b> automatically without external force, which makes it suitable for 3 D printing applications. By applying the electric signal at 2. 4 MHz, the ejector can eject water downward with a speed of 0. 29 m/s and droplet dimension of 720 m...|$|R
5000|$|Injecting ink: Depending on {{the type}} of {{cartridge}} being <b>refilled,</b> <b>ink</b> can either be injected through a hole on top of the cartridge, or directly into the ink chambers after the top has been popped off. The ink can be injected directly from a bottle (with a needle tip on it) or from a needle filled with ink. The ink must be slowly injected into the cartridge so as not to cause damage, or overfilling, or overflow to other-color ink reservoirs. (For colors, a label on the cartridge might have three ordered color-dots to indicate the corresponding three ink colors of the reservoir chambers.|$|R
50|$|Also in 2005, Lexmark {{suffered}} a legal {{defeat in the}} case of Lexmark Int'l v. Static Control Components, when the U.S. Supreme Court rejected Lexmark's petition for a writ of certiorari, thereby rejecting their attempt to have the Court hear their case. In this case, the defendant was a manufacturer of microchips that allowed third-party ink and toner cartridges to work on printers, including many manufactured by Lexmark. Such printers incorporated a feature that would require authentication from a microchip within the ink/toner cartridge in order to function; this was designed to prohibit users from refilling the cartridges. However, a recent firmware update allowed Lexmark to prevent end users from <b>refilling</b> <b>ink</b> cartridges or using third-party ink cartridges.|$|R
50|$|Impression Products, Inc. v. Lexmark International, Inc., 581 U.S. ___ (2017), is a {{decision}} of the Supreme Court of the United States on the exhaustion doctrine in patent law in which the Court held that after {{the sale of a}} patented item, the patent holder cannot sue for patent infringement relating to further use of that item, even when in violation of a contract with a customer or imported from outside the United States. The case concerned a patent infringement lawsuit brought by Lexmark against Impression Products, Inc., which bought used <b>ink</b> cartridges, <b>refilled</b> them, replaced a microchip on the cartridge to circumvent a digital rights management scheme, and then resold them. Lexmark argued that as they own several patents related to the ink cartridges, Impression Products was violating their patent rights. The U.S. Supreme Court, reversing a 2016 decision of the Federal Circuit, held that the exhaustion doctrine prevented Lexmark's patent infringement lawsuit, although Lexmark could enforce restrictions on use or resale of its contracts with direct purchasers under regular contract law (but not as a patent infringement lawsuit). Besides printer and ink manufacturers, the decision of the case could affect the markets of high tech consumer goods and prescription drugs.|$|R
50|$|Perhaps the easiest, most {{trouble-free}} {{method of}} <b>refilling</b> <b>ink</b> cartridges {{is through the}} use of a CISS (Continuous Ink Supply System). A CISS consists of a set of cartridges that have tubes connected to them, through which the ink continuously flows from ink reservoirs on the outside of the printer. Instead of refilling the cartridges themselves, the user simply refills the bottles on the outside of the printer. Early CIS systems were composed of OEM cartridges that had been drilled and outfitted with fittings to accept the ink delivery tubes, a set of 'ribbon' tubes, and plastic bottles with holes drilled in the caps for the tubes and the vents. Today's CIS systems are mass-produced in China, often incorporating all ink bottles into one partitioned container. They typically utilize auto-reset chips, which means the cartridges rarely have to be removed from the printer.|$|R
5000|$|A common {{business}} model for inkjet printers involves selling the actual printer {{at or below}} production cost, while dramatically marking {{up the price of}} the (proprietary) ink cartridges (a profit model called [...] "Freebie marketing"). Most current inkjet printers attempt to enforce this product tying by anticompetitive measures such as microchips in the cartridges to hinder the use of third-party or <b>refilled</b> <b>ink</b> cartridges. The microchips monitor usage and report the ink remaining to the printer. Some manufacturers also impose [...] "expiration dates". When the chip reports that the cartridge is empty (or out of date) the printer stops printing. Even if the cartridge is refilled, the microchip will indicate to the printer that the cartridge is depleted. For many models (especially from Canon), the 'empty' status can be overridden by entering a 'service code' (or sometimes simply by pressing the 'start' button again). For some printers, special circuit [...] "flashers" [...] are available that reset the quantity of remaining ink to the maximum.|$|R
5000|$|Computer printer {{manufacturers}} {{have gone through}} extensive efforts {{to make sure that}} their printers are incompatible with lower cost after-market <b>ink</b> cartridges and <b>refilled</b> cartridges. This is because the printers are often sold at or below cost to generate sales of proprietary cartridges which will generate profits for the company {{over the life of the}} equipment. In fact, in certain cases, the cost of replacing disposable ink or toner may even approach the cost of buying new equipment with included cartridges, although included cartridges are often [...] "starter" [...] cartridges that are only partially filled. Methods of vendor lock-in include designing the cartridges in a way that makes it possible to patent certain parts or aspects, or invoking the Digital Millennium Copyright Act to prohibit reverse engineering by third-party ink manufacturers. Another method entails completely disabling the printer when a non-proprietary ink cartridge is placed into the machine, instead of merely issuing an ignorable message that a non-genuine (yet still fully functional) cartridge was installed.|$|R
40|$|The {{advancement}} of technology brings people not only convenience but also new issues. For example, people buy Consumer Electronics and Peripheral Expendables and then produce {{a lot of}} wastes. The climate crisis, ecocrisis warn people that it is highly important to preserve the environment. European Union (EU) has enacted the Directive on product recycling (Waste Electrical Electronics Equipment, WEEE) and Taiwan also has established similar rule of law, such as the Resource Recycling and Reuse Act. There are indications that most nations are enforcing the policy of resource recycling and reuse. The processes of resource recycling and reuse include recycling and reuse. The ink cartridges did not finish their life when the ink was used up and then refilled. The reuse of ink cartridge does mitigate the waste impacts. However, the aftermarket ink cartridges snatch the market share. The patentee starts {{to argue that the}} <b>refilled</b> <b>ink</b> cartridges infringed its patent. January 31, 2006, the Intellectual Property High Court, which was organized within the existing Tokyo High Court in April 2005, rendered an awaited Grand Panel decision in the Canon Inc. v. Recycle Assist Co., Ltd. Case concerning the recycling of ink jet cartridges. This was the first case before the IP High Court concerning the application of the exhaustion theory to recycled products in Japan. The interference between protecting the environment and patent right is occurred. Only reconciliation of the dispute {{can be one of the}} promising ways to a humanistic and equal world for human beings and prosperous world-wide economics. 科技的進步，不只帶給人類便利性，也帶給人類更多課題；像是消費性電子產品廢棄物，以及電腦週邊耗材類製造大量垃圾問題等。加上近年來氣候異常、地球生態浩劫嚴重，使得環境保護已是逐漸被高舉的旗幟。如歐盟施行廢電子電機產品(WEEE) 指令，要求電子電機產品的生產者應盡到回收與再生的義務，台灣亦有類似的環保法規，如資源回收再利用法等；顯示資源的回收與再生，已是各國政府努力推動的公共政策之一。 在資源再生的過程中，包括再生利用與再使用；其中，再使用的產品─噴墨印表機的墨水匣再生，似乎可解決這類耗材大量廢棄後，產生的環境污染問題。然而，墨水匣耗材的再生販售，其低價策略侵蝕原廠墨水匣的利潤與市佔率，原廠開始以其擁有之專利權，以排他性作為攻擊手段欲禁止耗材回收再生業者之行為。第一審的平成 16 年(ワ) 第 8557 號判決及第二審的平成 17 年(ネ) 第 10021 號判決，便是日本佳能為保障其噴墨印表機墨水匣之市場及其利潤，而發動的專利爭訟案；其中，第二審更推翻第一審的判決，墨水匣的再生行為被認定為直接侵害佳能專利權。爭訟當中的權利耗盡是否成立，再生製程是否等同生產製造，都是該專利案爭訟中的有趣問題。 專利保護與環境保護之間，已儼然發生衝突。專利保護與環境保護是否存在可調和的空間？總之，本文期待在保護專利權之餘，公益與私利之間的衝突得以化解，使得專利制度對於人類全體之幸福做出更大的貢獻。第一章	緒論Page 1 第一節	研究動機Page 1 第二節	研究目的Page 3 第三節	研究範圍Page 4 第四節	研究方法及流程Page 4 第二章	綠色產品及其管制規範Page 6 第一節	綠色產品與綠色企業Page 7 第二節	歐盟管制規範Page 11 第三節	台灣之環保法令Page 16 第四節	小結Page 24 第三章	專利權、專利侵權類型及權利耗盡Page 25 第一節	專利權的本質及其效力Page 27 第二節	專利侵權類型Page 31 第三節	權利耗盡之理論及其主要類型Page 52 第四章	噴墨印表機墨水匣專利權與環境保護的衝突Paget 61 第一節	墨水匣市場概況Page 65 第二節	Canon案介紹Page 70 第三節	Canon案件評析Page 94 第五章	結論Page 90 第一節	對於專利訴訟策略的建議Page 99 第二節	Canon案對資源回收再生的影響Page 10...|$|R
