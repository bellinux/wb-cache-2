This study investigated preparation of partially defatted peanut flours by extrusion, screw pressing, and use of the flours in breakfast cereal flakes. Release of oil by wet and <b>dry</b> <b>extrusion</b> was evaluated. Wet extrusion (using an Anderson International Company expander) was tried initially and abandoned in favor of <b>dry</b> <b>extrusion</b> (using an InstaPro International Company extruder). Thus, fewer samples of earlier product were observed. <b>Dry</b> <b>extrusion,</b> followed by screw pressing removed oil for a total recovery of 90. 6 % of the oil in peanut kernels. Press cakes prepared by <b>dry</b> <b>extrusion</b> had higher protein dispersibility index (PDI) than those made using wet extrusion. Trypsin inhibitor was quite stable to heat treatment, only 23 % was inactivated by <b>dry</b> <b>extrusion</b> and 26 % after screw pressing. Press cakes were roasted (166 'C for 8 min) to develop flavor. Press cakes were ground and evaluated as protein supplement in flakes. Corn cones, ground corn of particle size intermediate between meal and flour, were replaced with unroasted partially defatted peanut flour (PDPF) and roasted flour (R-PDPF) at 0 %, 10 %, 20 % and 30 % levels. The mixtures were extruded using a Wenger Manufacturing Company twin-screw extruder to produce collets. The collets were flaked, then roasted at 171 'C for 3 min. Flakes containing 30 % PDPF had 16 % protein. Increasing the peanut flour level decreased the product bulk density and hardness. Lightness and yellowness decreased as the peanut flour content increased. Water absorption (WAI) and water solubility (WSI) indices increased for flakes with addition of peanut flour. Bowl fife, the time for crispiness to disappear after soaking in milk, decreased with addition of peanut flour. Sensory evaluation was conducted for crispiness, color, flavor and overall acceptance using the 9 -point hedonic scale (I = dislike extremely, 9 like extremely). Peanut flavor was also evaluated (I = none, 9 = strong). Untrained sensory panelists (n = 48) evaluated 5 samples of flakes (O%, 10 %, 20 %, 30 % R-PDPF and 30 % PDPF) I min after addition of milk. All flakes were rated acceptable (score > 5. 0). Surprisingly, peanut flavor intensity was the highest for flakes containing 30 % PDPF, rather than the R-PDPF...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Full-fat {{soyabeans}} (FFSB) {{intended for}} use in monogastric nutrition need to undergo heat treatment so that present anti-nutritional factors can be inactivated. Under- or over-treatment will decrease the level of amino acids available to the animal. In this study, the slope-ratio technique was used in two trials with broilers for determining the optimum treatment temperature for soyabeans. Average daily weight gain (ADWG) and feed conversion efficiency (FCE) were used as response parameters. The optimum temperature for <b>dry</b> <b>extrusion</b> of FFSB was 144 °C for Trial 1 and 138 °C for Trial 2. Similar temperature values were generated by both ADWG and FCE.

40|$|The soybean {{is known}} as an {{excellent}} source of protein when formulating diets for swine. However, this potential can be achieved only if certain quantity of heat is applied. Osborne and Mendel (1917) were the first to report that raw soybeans had a growth-depressing effect in rats. Generally, these heat labile factors are protease inhibitors, lectins, goigotrens and antivitamins. The most common way of eliminating these factors is by heating or “toasting” the soybeans in a processing plant, being sure that temperature, duration of the heating, particle size and moisture are controlled. Another way to inactivate these factors is by <b>dry</b> <b>extrusion</b> (without steam). It is well known that antinutritional factors present in raw soybeans can cause inhibition in growth, decreased feed efficiency, goiterogenic responses, pancreatic hypertrophy, hypoglycemia and liver damage in non ruminants animals depending upon species, age, size, sex, state of health and plane of nutrition. Liener (2000) defines protease inhibitors of soybeans as proteins that can be categorized as those that have a molecular weight of about 20, 000 daltons and a specificity directed primarily against trypsin, known as the Kunitz trypsin inhibitor (Kunitz, 1945); and those tha...|$|E

A unidade experimental foi constituída de um animal alojado em baia individual. As dietas experimentais foram isonutritivas e formuladas à base de milho e farelo de soja, com 8 % de soja, de acordo com cada tipo de processamento da soja. Foram avaliadas cinco dietas: soja 1 - dieta com 8 % de soja desativada em reator por aquecimento a vapor e sob pressão; soja 2 - dieta com 8 % de soja desativada com aquecimento por perdas dielétricas, após umidificação dos grãos e passagem por câmara com microondas; soja 3 - similar à soja 1, porém, com soja desativada em reator de outra marca; soja 4 - dieta com soja extrusada a seco, de modo que os grãos eram direcionados para um canhão com helicóides e cones dispostos para provocar aquecimento por atrito e pressão; e soja 5 - dieta com soja extrusada a seco com prensagem para retirada de parte do óleo. Avaliaram-se o desempenho, as características de carcaça e a rentabilidade econômica do processamento.

40|$|This {{scientific}} {{opinion of the}} EFSA Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids deals with the safety assessment of the recycling process FPR, EU register No RECYC 039, {{which is based on}} the Starlinger Recostar PET IV+ technology. The input to the process is hot caustic washed PET flakes originating from collected post-consumer PET bottles and containing no more than 5 % of PET from non-food consumer applications. In this process, washed post-consumer PET flakes are dried with desiccant air at high temperature before being extruded at high temperature and vacuum into pellets. The amorphous pellets are crystallised and solid state polymerised. Having examined the results of the challenge test provided, the Panel concluded that the three steps, pre-drying and <b>drying,</b> <b>extrusion</b> and crystallisation and SSP are the critical steps that determine the decontamination efficiency of the process. The operating parameters to control the performance of these critical steps are temperature, gas flow and residence time for the pre-drying and drying step 2, temperature, pressure and residence time for extrusion step 3 and crystallisation and SSP step 4. Under these conditions, it was demonstrated that the recycling process is able to ensure that the level of migration of potential unknown contaminants into food is below the conservatively modelled migration of 0. 1 μg/kg food. The Panel concluded that the recycled PET obtained from the process FPR intended to be used at up to 100 % for the manufacture of materials and articles for contact with all types of foodstuffs for long term storage at room temperature, with or without hotfill is not considered of safety concern.

The diets were formulated to contain 1. 4 % lysine and 24. 4 % lactose. Soybean meal (with or without extrusion processing) replaced milk protein on an equal lysine basis. Experimental diets were fed for the entire 28 d experiment. On d 14, fecal samples were collected to determine apparent DM and N digestibilities by feeding chromic oxide as an undigestible marker. Average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), and feed efficiency (FIG) were improved (P<. 05) in pigs fed the predominately milk diet from d 0 to 14 postweaning compared to pigs fed soybean meal with or without extrusion processing. For the entire trial (d 0 to 28), ADG was increased in pigs fed the milk based diet compared to pigs fed a soybean meal-based diet. Pigs fed moist extruded soybean meal had a similar ADG to pigs fed the milk diet and had an increased ADG compared to pigs fed dry extruded soybean meal. Average daily feed intake (d 0 to 28) was increased in pigs fed soybean meal (with or without moist extrusion) compared to pigs fed the milk based diet. Pigs fed the milk based diet had improved feed efficiency compared to pigs fed soybean meal with or without extrusion processing. Dry matter and N digestibilities were similar between dietary treatments. These data suggest that extrusion processing can be used to improve soybean meal quality for use in starter pig diets.

40|$|The {{effects of}} the {{fortification}} of tortilla chips with mechanically expelled soy flour as well as baking and frying processes on the properties of tortilla chips were evaluated. Sensory characteristics, texture, thickness, color, protein and oil content were evaluated. Texture was measured by objective and subjective tests. Sensory properties were evaluated using a nine point hedonic scale. Soybeans (food grade Hartz) were mechanically expelled to obtain partially defatted soy flour of 6. 7 % final oil content. Dry masa flour (DMF) was replaced with 0, 10, 20 and 30 % mechanically-expelled soy flour (MESF). The equilibrated tortilla was either fried in oil or baked in an air-impingement oven followed by convection oven drying. Overall, fried tortilla chips were harder and thicker than baked tortilla chips. Fried tortilla chips with 20 and 30 % soy flour substitution required less force to break. In fried tortilla chips, as MESF increased, force and work levels decreased, where 20 % MESF had the lowest force values. Thickness measurements of tortilla chips showed that as the thickness increased, the force and work also increased. Protein increased linearly in baked and fried tortilla chips where 30 % resulted in the highest protein level. In fried tortilla chips, MESF fortification increased oil levels linearly as well. Baked tortilla chips were lighter than fried tortilla chips. In a consumer sensory evaluation, fried tortilla chips were preferred more than the baked ones.

The maximal reduction of crystallinity in PEG 6000 was obtained by co-spray drying with HPMC 2910 E 5. In the next step the model drug Itraconazole was added to the blend and the resulting ternary solid dispersions were characterized. The results of this study show that the addition of PEG 6000 to the Itraconazole/HPMC 2910 E 5 system leads to phase separation that in most cases gives rise to recrystallization of either PEG 6000 or Itraconazole. For all ternary dispersions containing 20 % of Itraconazole the drug was highly amorphous and the dissolution was improved compared to the binary 20 / 80 w/w Itraconazole/HPMC 2910 E 5 solid dispersion. For all ternary dispersions containing 40 % of Itraconazole, the drug was partially crystalline and the dissolution was lower than the dissolution of the binary 40 / 60 w/w Itraconazole/HPMC 2910 E 5 dispersion. These results show that provided Itraconazole is highly amorphous the addition of PEG 6000 to HPMC 2910 E 5 leads to an increase in drug release.

A severely underused marine resource is processing wastes of various types of seafood, which are often disposed of at great cost. Therefore, {{this study was conducted}} to evaluate three different types of seafood processing wastes as potential feed ingredients for the red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus). The three processing wastes evaluated were heads and shells from Penaeid shrimp, and viscera and skeletal remains from filleted black drum (Pogonias cromis) and channel catfish (Ictaluras punctatus). These wastes were blended with soybean meal in a 40 : 60 ratio, dry extruded and dried to produce stable ingredients. All three byproduct meals produced had crude protein levels ranging from 45 to 50 percent. Two feeding trials were conducted to evaluate the different processing waste byproduct meals in comparison to menhaden fishmeal. A digestibility trial was conducted with sub-adult red drum which led to the computation of apparent digestibility coefficients (ADCs) for organic matter, protein, lipid and energy for each of the byproduct meals. Each byproduct meal had relatively high ADC values that were generally similar to those of menhaden fishmeal. A comparative growth trial with red drum was then conducted in which experimental diets were formulated with the three byproduct meals replacing menhaden fishmeal on an equal-digestible-protein basis at levels of 65 percent, 80 percent, or 95 percent. Juvenile red drum were fed the various diets for 8 weeks in a brackish (6 plus/minus 1 ppt) water recirculating system after which weight gain, survival, feed efficiency, as well as whole-body proximate composition and condition indices were measured. All three of the byproduct meals could replace up to 65 percent of the protein provided by fishmeal without adversely affecting performance of red drum. However, the shrimp byproduct consistently provided the highest performance values at 80 percent replacement. The catfish byproduct yielded the lowest fish performance at all levels. This study indicates that <b>dry</b> <b>extrusion</b> of seafood processing wastes can be used to replace a considerable amount of fishmeal in feeds for red drum...|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} replacing fish meal (FM) in the diet of European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) with differently processed soybean meals on growth performance; apparent digestibility coefficients (ADCs); the activity of alkaline phosphatase and the brush border digestive enzymes: leucine amino peptidase, maltase and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase; and the fish morphometric and flesh quality. European sea bass with an initial average body weight of 187. 8 ± 1. 4 g, were fed either a FM based (control) diet or a soy replacement isoproteic, isolipidic and isocaloric diet. The treatments consisted replacing FM protein by: 25 % toasted, dehulled and solvent-extracted soybean meal (SE 25); 50 % dehulled and toasted soy seeds subjected to <b>dry</b> <b>extrusion</b> and mechanical oil extraction (ME 50); 50 % enzyme-treated soybean meal (ET 50) and an inclusion of 60 % composed of 30 % toasted, dehulled and solvent-extracted soybean meal and 30 % enzyme-treated soybean meal (SE+ET/ 60). ADCs values of dry matter, crude protein, crude lipid and gross energy did not significantly differ between ME 50 and SE+ET/ 60 but {{both of them were}} inferior to the other treatments (P 0. 05). In order to gain more insight on the effects of the diet on fish growth, activity of the brush border enzymes was measured. No significant differences were found in leucine amino peptidase and maltase activities, between the control group and the other soy derivate groups. The activity of γ- glutamyl transpeptidase was significantly higher in the upper section in fish that consumed the control diet compared with fish that consumed the soy derivate diets. Yet, the main activity of this enzyme was found in the lower intestinal section. In all the soy derivate diets except for the SE 25 diet, the activity of alkaline phosphatase was significantly lower than its activity in the control diet. Feeding diets that include various types and levels of soybean derivatives did not affect the whole body composition and slaughter yield but significantly reduced liver weight. The results show that in methionine supplemented diets, FM can be replaced in terms of protein by 25 % SE, 50 % ET or 60 % soy composed of 30 % SE and 30 % ET without hampering fish performance. The inclusion of 50 % protein from ME resulted in significantly lower growth performance and feed utilization...|$|E
40|$|Diets of many cultured fishes require high {{inclusion}} of fishmeal and fish oil. With {{the growth of}} aquaculture worldwide, demand for fishmeal and fish oil has increased resulting in higher prices of these ingredients due to increased demand but relatively static supplies. A promising source of alternative protein and lipid is the waste from seafood processing. This project evaluated four different types of seafood processing wastes as potential feed ingredients for the red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus) and hybrid striped bass (Morone saxatilis x M. chysops). Viscera and skeletal remains from filleted channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), black drum (Pogonias cromis), yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) and krill (Euphausia superba) were evaluated with red drum and hybrid striped bass by determining nutrient and energy digestibility. Catfish, black drum, and tuna waste products were blended with soybean meal in a 40 : 60 ratio. All diets were subjected to <b>dry</b> <b>extrusion,</b> and then dried to produce stable ingredients. Diets used for the digestibility trial were formulated to contain 40 % crude protein, 10 % lipid and 1 % chromic oxide as a marker, with each ingredient substituted in a reference diet at a 30 : 70 ratio. The yellowfin tuna fillet waste also was evaluated in a comparative feeding trial with juvenile red drum. In that trial, experimental diets with the tuna by-product meal replaced menhaden fishmeal on an equal protein basis at levels of 5, 10, 20, 40 or 60 %. Diets were formulated to contain 40 % crude protein and 12 % lipid. Juvenile red drum were fed the various diets for 7 weeks in 38 -L aquaria linked as a brackish (6 + 1 ppt) water recirculating system. Apparent digestibility coefficient (ADC) values for crude protein, crude lipid, and energy from krill and catfish meal were similar for red drum while the black drum meal had decisively lower values. Krill meal had higher ADC values for organic matter and energy than catfish meal and black drum meal in hybrid striped bass. ADC values of crude protein, and crude lipid were similar for krill, catfish, and black drum ingredients. Based on weight gain and feed efficiency responses in the feeding trial, red drum fed the control diet with only fishmeal significantly outperformed fish fed the tuna-substituted diets. However, {{no significant differences were}} observed among fish fed the diets with 5, 10, 20, or 40 % tuna substitution. These results suggest that {{inclusion of}} seafood processing by-products can be substituted for fishmeal and possibly reduce the price of fish feeds...|$|E

In this work different semolina samples, of variable protein contents (10. 5 – 14. 2 %) and %UPP (20. 2 – 46. 3 %) are studied. The changes in %UPP induced by the successive pasta processing steps (mixing, <b>extrusion,</b> <b>drying)</b> but also those occurring during resting periods at 35 °C, applied in-between them, were investigated. Effect of a resting period was moderate after mixing, but pronounced after extrusion. Resting of extruded pasta at 35 °C significantly increased %UPP, which can even grow beyond that of the semolina. No relationship was found between pasta viscoelastic index (VI) and semolina %UPP or protein content. However, cooked pasta VI was found related to the calculated %UPP of rested fresh pasta...|$|R

40|$|The use of full fat {{soybeans}} (FFSB) {{in animal}} feeds has, to date, been limited {{due to the}} presence of anti-nutritional factors (ANF). It is, therefore, increasingly recognized that, if the full potential of full fat soybeans for the use in diets is to be realized, reliable analytical procedures must be available for the quality control of processed FFSB which would enable feed manufactures to determine the degree of soybean processing. Results of currently available analytical techniques vary widely between laboratories, causing uncertainty and confusion among soybean processors, feed manufacturers and end users. A collaborative study was conducted to standardize a number of existing analytical procedures used for determining the effects of heat treatment on FFSB and to generate South African ranges for standardized laboratory procedures. Raw soybeans, in a mixture of cultivars, were processed by <b>dry</b> <b>extrusion</b> at eight different temperatures (110 ºC, 120 ºC, 127 ºC, 136 ºC, 140 ºC, 145 ºC, 151 ºC and 164 ºC). In vivo trials were conducted on broiler chicks which were fed the eight extruded FFBB. Their performance was monitored with regard to average daily gain (ADG) and feed conversion ratio (FCR). The Protein Solubility in KOH (PSKOH) and the Protein Dispersibility index (PDI) procedures were used for standardization in an inter-laboratory study with the participation of ten South African analytical laboratories. Statistical analysis of the in vivo trials with broilers showed no significant difference (P> 0. 05) between broilers fed FFSB processed at 136 ºC, 140 ºC and 145 ºC. In addition, samples processed at those temperatures (136 ºC, 140 ºC and 145 ºC) showed the best chick performance with regard to average daily gain (ADG) and the feed conversion ratio (FCR). There was a significant difference (P< 0. 05) between broilers fed FFSB processed at 110 ºC, 120 ºC and 120 ºC as well as those fed FFSB processed at 151 ºC and 164 ºC. In vitro results showed that the PSKOH and PDI values corresponding to temperatures which showed the best chicken performance were between 67 - 77 % and 10. 3 - 8. 5 index units respectively. Therefore, the South African ranges for describing the degree of soybean processing using the PSKOH method are 66 - 77 % with repeatability and reproducibility limits of 3. 5 and 10. 9 respectively and, when using the PDI method, are 8. 5 - 10. 3 index units with repeatability and reproducibility limits of 2. 1 and 7. 7 respectively. A very good correlation was established between the animal production parameters and the PSKOH values, while a poor correlation between animal production parameters (ADWG and FCR) and PDI values was established. The PSKOH method was found to be the most reliable method for FFSB quality control under standardized South African conditions. Dissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2011.

40|$|Purpose: To {{document}} {{the incidence of}} complications after myringotomy and grommet insertion in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The {{focus is on the}} incidence of otorrhea and perforation. The possible risk factors for these conditions and treatment response were studied. Materials and Methods: We reviewed the records on 206 ears of 163 patients who suffered from nasopharyngeal carcinoma and underwent myringotomy and grommet insertion in a 7 -year period. The follow-up period ranged from 4 weeks to 78 months (median, 9 months). Results: The overall incidence of otorrhea in these ears was 38 %. Patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) had a significantly high incidence of postoperative discharge (χ 2 test, P ≤. 0001) compared with other patients who underwent myringotomy and grommet insertion. The mean interval between myringotomy and otorrhea was 19. 8 weeks. Forty-seven per cent of the ears with a discharge developed otorrhea within 1 month. In 42 %, the otorrhea responded to treatment and the ears became <b>dry.</b> After <b>extrusion</b> of the grommet, 29 % of those ears with otorrhea ended with an eardrum perforation, and 24 % of the ears showed recurrent effusion. Conclusions: For patients with NPC who underwent myringotomy, there was a significant risk of otorrhea (49 %) and persistent perforation (29 %), and these complications were difficult to manage. We conclude that myringotomy and grommet insertion should not be routinely offered to NPC patients with middle ear effusion. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Keywords: Extrusion, Canine diet, Protein, Lysine, Starch gelatinization, Palatability, <b>Drying.</b> <b>Extrusion</b> {{cooking is}} a useful and {{economical}} tool for processing animal feed. This high temperature, short time processing technology causes chemical and physical changes that alter the nutritional and physical quality of the product. Effects of extrusion on the feed quality for other animals than pets have been well recognized. Our studies investigated to what extent <b>extrusion</b> and/or <b>drying</b> of a complete canine diet affects lysine reactivity, amino acids, fatty acids, starch gelatinization and physical parameters. In {{order to create a}} general view of dog food quality in practice, the physical and nutritional quality of commercial canine diets available in the Netherlands were examined. This study showed unveiled variation in lysine reactivity and starch gelatinization of commercial dry canine diets. A study was then carried out on the effects of extrusion on the physical and nutritional values of canine diets in a FIDO model. The extrusion conditions (temperatures in the range of 110 to 150 ºC, 300 g/kg moisture) increased lysine reactivity, starch gelatinization and in-vitro starch digestibility. Protein digestibility and dispersibility were not affected by the extrusion conditions used. The increase in the extrusion temperature used (110 to 150 ºC) decreased kibble durability but did not affect hardness. This study also concluded that optimisation of extrusion conditions during production of commercial canine diets should include the measurement of the reactive to total lysine ratio. Single ingredients of a complete canine diet did not respond in a similar way during extrusion: extrusion had no effects on animal ingredients (higher lysine contents) while extrusion could decrease (in barley) or increase (in rice) the reactive lysine content in vegetable ingredients (lower lysine content). Both reactive lysine content and ratios of reactive to total lysine of the mixture of all vegetable ingredients were hugely increased during extrusion. Finally, an additional study was carried out on the effects of drying on extruded canine diets. The results of this study showed that drying temperature (in the range of 120 - 160 ºC) and drying time did not affect the quality of extruded canine diets in terms of amino acids and fatty acids levels while these drying temperatures reduced drying time from hours to minutes. Drying temperature only affected the reactive lysine content and, therefore, the ratio of reactive to total lysine of kibbles dried at a temperature of 200 ºC. Drying temperature also affected a minority of fatty acids with fatty acid C 18 : 3 n- 3 being the most affected at a drying temperature of 200 ºC. In conclusion, extrusion at temperatures in the range of 130 - 150 ºC and at a moisture of 300 g/kg is a mild heat treatment with respect to protein quality for pet food production. Measurement of the ratio of reactive to total lysine should be included in optimisation of extrusion conditions during pet food production. Drying temperature in the range of 120 - 160 ºC and drying time do not affect the amino acids and fatty acids level of extruded canine diets...|$|R
