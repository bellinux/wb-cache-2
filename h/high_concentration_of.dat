Following revitalization efforts and gentrification, Old Louisville is currently home to a diverse population with a <b>high</b> <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> students and young professionals.|$|E

5|$|Overall, high {{temperature}} {{is the most}} common problem in the Little Butte Creek watershed. This is most likely caused by water diversion and depleted riparian zones. Approximately 53percent of riparian zones in the watershed are damaged due to agriculture or deforestation, while 43percent are classified as healthy. Another threat to healthy riparian zones are invasive blackberries, which crowd out native vegetation and provide little shade. The resulting higher water temperatures can be very harmful to anadromous fish. <b>High</b> <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> bacteria is also an issue.|$|E
30|$|The {{differences}} in the element concentrations represent {{the impact of the}} variety of the land use on the soil chemistry. The <b>high</b> <b>concentrations</b> <b>of</b> the SO 4 2 −, associated with <b>high</b> <b>concentrations</b> <b>of</b> H+, in the forested area could be resulted from the high organic sulfur content (Mayer et al. 1995), compared to the arable areas. On the other hand, the <b>high</b> <b>concentrations</b> <b>of</b> the other elements in soil samples collected from the arable field {{may be related to the}} soil treatment and the agricultural activities. The agricultural activities are responsible for <b>higher</b> <b>concentrations</b> <b>of</b> these elements in the topsoil horizon in comparison with the underlying zones.|$|R
25|$|<b>High</b> <b>concentrations</b> <b>of</b> cytosolic citrate can inhibit phosphofructokinase, the {{catalyst}} {{of one of}} the rate-limiting steps of glycolysis. This effect is advantageous: <b>high</b> <b>concentrations</b> <b>of</b> citrate indicate that there is a large supply of biosynthetic precursor molecules, so {{there is no need for}} phosphofructokinase to continue to send molecules of its substrate, fructose 6-phosphate, into glycolysis. Citrate acts by augmenting the inhibitory effect <b>of</b> <b>high</b> <b>concentrations</b> <b>of</b> ATP, another sign that there is no need to carry out glycolysis.|$|R
30|$|These results {{suggested}} that 3 -HPA concentration vary with different initial <b>concentrations</b> <b>of</b> glycerol: the <b>higher</b> the initial <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> glycerol, the <b>higher</b> the 3 -HPA {{concentration in the}} early stage of fermentation. And there was a close relationship between 3 -HPA accumulation in the early stage of fermentation and lactate accumulation in the late stage <b>of</b> fermentation: a <b>higher</b> <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> 3 -HPA resulted in a <b>higher</b> <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> lactate. A <b>higher</b> <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> 3 -HPA during the early stage of fermentation significantly affected the final <b>concentrations</b> <b>of</b> the biomass and 1, 3 -PD, as did the lactate concentration in the late stage of fermentation.|$|R
5|$|Since 2006, the Fe-Oxidizing Microbial Observatory (FeMO), {{funded by}} the National Science Foundation and Microbial Observatory Program, has led cruises to Lōʻihi {{investigate}} its microbiology every October. The first cruise, on the ship R/V Melville and exploiting the submersible JASON2, lasted from September 22 to October 9. These cruises study {{the large number of}} Fe-oxidizing bacteria that have colonized Lōʻihi. Lōʻihi's extensive vent system is characterized by a <b>high</b> <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> CO2 and Iron, while being low in sulfide.

5|$|The unusually <b>high</b> <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> {{oxygen gas}} on Earth {{is the result}} of the oxygen cycle. This {{biogeochemical}} cycle describes the movement of oxygen within and between its three main reservoirs on Earth: the atmosphere, the biosphere, and the lithosphere. The main driving factor of the oxygen cycle is photosynthesis, which is responsible for modern Earth's atmosphere. Photosynthesis releases oxygen into the atmosphere, while respiration, decay, and combustion remove it from the atmosphere. In the present equilibrium, production and consumption occur at the same rate.|$|E
5|$|This <b>high</b> <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> macromolecules in cytosol causes {{an effect}} called {{macromolecular}} crowding, {{which is when}} the effective concentration of other macromolecules is increased, since they have less volume to move in. This crowding effect can produce large changes in both the rates and the position of chemical equilibrium of reactions in the cytosol. It is particularly important {{in its ability to}} alter dissociation constants by favoring the association of macromolecules, such as when multiple proteins come together to form protein complexes, or when DNA-binding proteins bind to their targets in the genome.|$|E
5|$|In 1971, the Israeli Army {{attempted}} to disperse the <b>high</b> <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> Palestinian refugees in al-Shati camp and developed new housing schemes {{that resulted in}} the establishment of the northern Sheikh Radwan district. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) and the PLO were vociferous in their opposition to the move, claiming it was forced resettlement. In 1972, Gaza's military governor dismissed the city's mayor, Rashad al-Shawa, for refusing to annex al-Shati camp to the municipality of Gaza. Since the 1970s, frequent conflicts erupted between Palestinians and the Israeli authorities in the city, leading to the First Intifada in 1987. Gaza became a center of confrontation during this uprising, and consequently, economic conditions in the city worsened.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to bony fish, {{with the exception}} of the coelacanth, the blood and other tissue of sharks and Chondrichthyes is generally isotonic to their marine environments because of the <b>high</b> <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> urea (up to 2.5%) and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), allowing them to be in osmotic balance with the seawater. This adaptation prevents most sharks from surviving in freshwater, and they are therefore confined to marine environments. A few exceptions exist, such as the bull shark, which has developed a way to change its kidney function to excrete large amounts of urea. When a shark dies, the urea is broken down to ammonia by bacteria, causing the dead body to gradually smell strongly of ammonia.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to extracellular fluid, cytosol has a <b>high</b> <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> potassium ions {{and a low}} concentration of sodium ions. This difference in ion concentrations is critical for osmoregulation, since if the ion levels were the same inside a cell as outside, water would enter constantly by osmosis - since the levels of macromolecules inside cells are higher than their levels outside. Instead, sodium ions are expelled and potassium ions {{taken up by the}} Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase, potassium ions then flow down their concentration gradient through potassium-selection ion channels, this loss of positive charge creates a negative membrane potential. To balance this potential difference, negative chloride ions also exit the cell, through selective chloride channels. The loss of sodium and chloride ions compensates for the osmotic effect of the higher concentration of organic molecules inside the cell.|$|E
