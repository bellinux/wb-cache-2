500|$|During {{his four}} years at Michigan, Woolfolk had what one {{reporter}} described as [...] "a strange love-hate relationship" [...] with Coach Bo Schembechler. Woolfolk noted at the time Schembechler is a [...] "tough coach", and it was [...] "not easy at all" [...] playing for him. Schembechler was often angered by Woolfolk's tendency to try to run around defenders rather than banging through them, resulting in Woolfolk being benched more than once. But Schembechler said Woolfolk [...] "came of age" [...] in the November 1980 Ohio State game. After Woolfolk's MVP performance in the 1981 Rose Bowl helped Schembechler to his first bowl game victory, Bo complimented Woolfolk's powerful performance, noting: [...] "Butch {{can be a real}} load." [...] By the 1981 season, Schembechler was a true believer in Woolfolk, saying: [...] "Today, I can say without reservation, that I'd rather go into a big game with Woolfolk at tailback than any other back in the country." [...] Woolfolk, too, concluded in the end that Schembechler was [...] "key" [...] to his success: [...] "He kept after me. He <b>kept</b> <b>saying</b> I was getting too fancy. He <b>kept</b> <b>saying,</b> 'You're a big back, a fast back, and you ought to be running over people -- not trying to dance around them.'" ...|$|E

This he <b>kept</b> <b>saying</b> until Themistocles replied, 'This is the truth of the matter: if I had been a man of Belbina I would not have been honored in this way by the Spartans, nor would you, sir, for all you are a man of Athens.'

('Munnabhai is fine, but who is this Mahatma Gandhi?') So this is the sad state of affairs today. I was shocked. And it's not just the chai-wallah. A few days ago on TV a lot of {{politicians}} were asked India-related questions on the news channels, and I can't believe a lot of them don't know 2 October is Gandhiji's birthday!

500|$|Grey's Anatomy used a color-blind casting technique, {{resulting}} in a racially diverse ensemble. Each role was cast without the character's races being pre-determined, keeping Rhimes' vision of diversity. The production staff began casting with the program's title character, Meredith Grey, which Rhimes stated was a difficult role to cast. [...] "I <b>kept</b> <b>saying</b> we need a girl like that girl from Moonlight Mile," [...] said Rhimes, [...] "and after a while, they were like, 'We {{think we can get}} that girl from Moonlight Mile." [...] The next to be cast, Sandra Oh (Dr. Cristina Yang), was initially invited to audition for the character of Bailey, but pressed to read for the role of Cristina instead. Many actors read for the role of Dr. Derek Shepherd, but when Patrick Dempsey read for the part, [...] "he was just perfect", according to Rhimes.|$|E
500|$|Harrison {{confessed that}} it was not easy for him {{to come up with the}} lyrics to [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] in that length of time. But two hours later, he had written the verses, and the hook, in spite of being hung over. Harrison had also made {{provision}} for a backing track; he played all the instruments on the track. The bridge was written by Beyoncé, who was inspired by looking at herself in the mirror; as she was not wearing matching clothes and her hair was untidy, she <b>kept</b> <b>saying,</b> [...] "I'm looking so crazy right now." [...] Harrison sang back to her and said, [...] "That's the hook." [...] It also inspired the title of the song. After that Beyoncé had filled up the middle eight, she came up with the catchphrase – [...] "Uh-oh, uh-oh, you know" [...] – alongside Harrison.|$|E

Reports came out of the Giants training compound of the exploits of the new [...] Taylor's teammates took to calling him Superman and joked that his locker should be replaced with a phone booth. Phil Simms, the team's quarterback, said, [...] "on the pass rush, he's an animal. He's either going to run around you or over you. With his quickness, he's full speed after two steps." [...] Taylor made his NFL exhibition debut on August 8, 1981, recording 2 sacks in the Giants' 23–7 win over the Chicago Bears. Before the season word spread around the league about Taylor. Years after facing him in an exhibition game, Pittsburgh Steelers Quarterback Terry Bradshaw recalled, [...] "e dang-near killed me, I just <b>kept</b> <b>saying,</b> 'Who is this guy?'

500|$|Pompeo {{discovered}} Grey's Anatomy {{after an}} extended period of doing nothing in the acting profession. [...] Her agent suggested she audition amongst other projects. [...] While casting actresses for the part of Meredith Grey, series' creator Shonda Rhimes said: [...] "I <b>kept</b> <b>saying</b> we need a girl like that girl from Moonlight Mile, and after a while, they were like, 'We think we can get that girl from Moonlight Mile.' I spent time with her and got to know her, and then we started casting for the men." [...] She reported that Grey was not an easy role to cast because of the strong verbal possibilities. [...] Rhimes was informed that the actress in question was Pompeo, who had a deal in place with ABC, having previously tested for a pilot show on the network. It has been speculated that Pompeo was the first character to be cast, but when asked, she said she did not know of this. When asked of how she created Pompeo's character, Rhimes said: ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{suddenly}} {{very wealthy}} and successful, {{much of the}} band and its entourage now struggled with heroin addiction. Four individuals — group leader Duane Allman, bassist Berry Oakley, and roadies Robert Payne and Joseph [...] "Red Dog" [...] Campbell — checked into the Linwood-Bryant Hospital for rehabilitation in October 1971. Their addictions had begun to affect their performances and matters seemed to only be getting worse, according to many involved. The clinic was deemed a [...] "joke" [...] and a [...] "nuthouse" [...] by Payne and Red Dog, and was later described {{as more of a}} psychiatric ward, as true rehabilitation clinics were several years away. All involved (including Duane) struggled to keep off the substance in the ensuing days. Despite this, Duane fueled the band's passion to get better and end their addictions: [...] "Duane was so happy and full of positive energy. He was always like that unless he was just totally wasted. He was the leader, the great soul, and he <b>kept</b> <b>saying,</b> 'We are on a mission and it's time for this thing to happen,'" [...] said Linda Oakley. [...] "He was moving forward, and that energized everyone else. Everyone fed off of that." ...|$|E
500|$|The next day, Churchill filed {{a lawsuit}} in state court {{claiming}} that the firing was retribution for his expressing politically unpopular views. The jury in Churchill's suit for reinstatement weighed the university's claims of academic misconduct per jury instructions it received in the case. As Stanley Fish said, [...] "It was the jury’s task to determine whether Churchill’s dismissal would have occurred independently of the adverse political response to his constitutionally protected statements." [...] The jury found that the alleged misconduct would not have led to Churchill's firing and rejected the university's academic misconduct claim as the grounds for dismissal. On April 1, 2009, a Colorado jury found that Churchill had been wrongly fired, and awarded $1 in damages. As {{one of the jurors}} said later in a press interview, [...] "it wasn't a slap in his face or anything like that when we didn't give him any money. It's just that [...] David Lane <b>kept</b> <b>saying</b> this wasn't about the money, and in the end, we took his word for that." [...] Churchill's counsel asked Chief Judge Larry J. Naves of the Denver District Court to order reinstatement in light of the verdict.|$|E

500|$|Shearer {{said in an}} {{interview}} that [...] "The animating impulse was to do rock 'n' roll right. The four of us had been around rock 'n' roll and we were just amazed by how relentlessly the movies got it wrong. Because we were funny people it was going to be a funny film, but we wanted to get it right." [...] When they tried to sell it to various Hollywood studios, they were told that the film would not work. The group <b>kept</b> <b>saying,</b> [...] "No, this is a story that's pretty familiar to people. We're not introducing them to anything they don't really know," [...] so Shearer thought it would at least have some resonance with the public. The film was only a modest success upon its initial release but found greater success, and a cult following, after its video release. In 2000, the film was ranked 29th on the American Film Institute's list of the top 100 comedy movies in American cinema and it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being [...] "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".|$|E

500|$|On 24 February 2000, Victoria Climbié {{was taken}} semi-conscious and {{suffering}} from hypothermia, multiple organ failure and malnutrition, {{to the local}} Universal Church of the Kingdom of God. With {{the advice of the}} pastor, a mini-cab was called to send Climbié to the hospital. The mini cab driver was horrified at Climbié's condition and sent her to the nearby Tottenham Ambulance Station instead. Climbié was rushed straight to the accident-and-emergency department at North Middlesex Hospital; she was then transferred to the intensive-care unit at St Mary's Hospital. The ambulance crew who drove her to St Mary's described how although Kouao had <b>kept</b> <b>saying,</b> [...] "my baby, my baby", her concern seemed [...] "not quite enough", and that Manning seemed [...] "almost as if he was not there". Climbié died the following day at 3:15pm local time. The pathologist who examined her body noted 128 separate injuries and scars on her body, and described it as the worst case of child abuse she had ever seen; Climbié had been burnt with cigarettes, tied up for periods of longer than 24 hours, and hit with bike chains, hammers and wires. During her life in Britain, Climbié was known to four local authorities (four social services departments and three housing departments), two child protection police teams, two hospitals, an NSPCC centre, and a few local churches. She was buried in Grand-Bassam near her home town.|$|E

500|$|Stone gave Charlie Sheen {{the choice}} of Jack Lemmon or Martin Sheen to play his father in the film, and Sheen picked his father. The elder Sheen related to the moral sense of his character. Stone cast Daryl Hannah as Bud Fox's materialistic girlfriend Darien Taylor, but {{felt that she was}} never happy with the role and did not know why she {{accepted}} it. He tried to explain the character to Hannah repeatedly, and thought that the materialism of the character conflicted with Hannah's idealism. Stone said later that he was aware early on that she was not right for the part. [...] "Daryl Hannah was not happy doing the role and I should have let her go. All my crew {{wanted to get rid of}} her after one day of shooting. My pride was such that I <b>kept</b> <b>saying</b> I was going to make it work". Stone also had difficulties with Sean Young, who made her opinions known that Hannah should be fired and that she should play that role instead. Young would show up to the set late and unprepared. She did not get along with Charlie Sheen, which caused further friction on the set. In retrospect, Stone felt that Young was right and he should have swapped Hannah's role with hers. Stone admits that he had [...] "some problems" [...] with Young, but was not willing to confirm or deny rumors that she walked off with all of her costumes when she completed filming.|$|E
500|$|However, Mercury and {{his inner}} circle of colleagues and friends, whom he felt he could trust, {{continually}} denied the stories, even after one front-page article published on 29 April 1991, showed Mercury appearing very haggard in what was by then a rare public appearance. It {{has been suggested that}} he could have made a contribution to AIDS awareness by speaking earlier about his situation and his fight against the disease. Mercury kept his condition private to protect those closest to him, with Brian May confirming in a 1993 interview he had informed the band of his illness much earlier. Filmed in May 1991, the music video for [...] "These Are the Days of Our Lives" [...] features a very thin Mercury, in what are his final scenes in front of the camera. The rest of the band were ready to record when Mercury felt able to come into the studio, {{for an hour or two}} at a time. May says of Mercury: [...] "He just <b>kept</b> <b>saying.</b> 'Write me more. Write me stuff. I want to just sing this and do it and when I am gone you can finish it off.' He had no fear, really." [...] Justin Shirley-Smith, the assistant engineer for those last sessions, states: [...] "This is hard to explain to people, but it wasn't sad, it was very happy. He [...] was one of the funniest people I ever encountered. I was laughing most of the time, with him. Freddie was saying [...] 'I'm not going to think about it, I'm going to do this.' ...|$|E
500|$|In July 1977, on {{the final}} date at the Montreal Olympic Stadium, {{a small group of}} noisy and excited fans near the stage irritated Waters {{to such an extent that}} he spat at one of them. [...] He was not the only band member to feel disaffected at the show: guitarist David Gilmour refused to perform the band's usual encores ("Money" [...] and [...] "Us and Them"), leaving the band, with backup guitarist Snowy White, to improvise a slow, sad twelve-bar blues, which Waters {{described}} as [...] "some music to go home to". [...] Later that night, returning from hospital after an injury sustained to his foot while play-fighting backstage with manager Steve O'Rourke, Waters spoke with music producer Bob Ezrin, and a friend of Ezrin's, a psychiatrist sharing their car, about the feelings of alienation he was experiencing on the tour. He articulated his desire to isolate himself by constructing a wall across the stage between the performers and the audience. He later said, [...] "I loathed playing in stadiums ... I <b>kept</b> <b>saying</b> to people on that tour, 'I'm not really enjoying this ... there is something very wrong with this.'" [...] While Gilmour and Wright were in France recording solo albums, and Nick Mason was busy producing Steve Hillage's Green, Waters began to write new material. The spitting incident became the starting point for a new concept, which explored the protagonist's self-imposed isolation after years of traumatic interactions with authority figures and the loss of his father as a young child. To execute The Wall concept was to attempt to analyse the performer's psychological separation from the audience, using a physical structure as a metaphorical and theatrical device.|$|E
