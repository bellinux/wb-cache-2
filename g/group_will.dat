5|$|At the June 2017 Board of Trustees Meeting, {{the project}} {{initiated}} for Elementary School No. 33 and architectural firm IBI <b>Group</b> <b>will</b> be helping design the school. The school's design {{is still in}} its early stages and designing plans have began, including input from students. This elementary school will be located at the intersection of Frassati Way and Spring Steubner Road, across the street from Zwink Elementary. Elementary School No. 33 is estimated to finish construction in August 2019.|$|E
5|$|Division I {{is split}} into two groups of six, both groups play in round robin tournaments {{independent}} {{of each other and}} the championship division. Previously the top team from both groups was promoted to the championship, while the bottom team was relegated to Division II. Beginning in 2012, the top two teams from the 'A' <b>group</b> <b>will</b> be promoted to the championship, the bottom team will be exchanged with the group 'B' winner, and that group's last place team will go down to Division II.|$|E
50|$|In {{the event}} of a major incident, the {{formation}} of Gold and Silver co-ordinating <b>groups</b> <b>will</b> occur. These <b>groups</b> <b>will</b> be responsible for actions and co-ordination within their own spheres of activity.|$|R
50|$|First {{stage of}} the <b>group</b> stage <b>will</b> be started on 12 August 2016, except for <b>Group</b> 3 <b>will</b> be started on 31 August 2016 All <b>groups</b> <b>will</b> play home and away {{round-robin}} tournament, {{with the exception of}} <b>Group</b> 3 which <b>will</b> play home tournament round-robin.|$|R
50|$|The book {{noted that}} large <b>groups</b> <b>will</b> face {{relatively}} high costs {{when attempting to}} organize for collective action while small <b>groups</b> <b>will</b> face relatively low costs, and individuals in large <b>groups</b> <b>will</b> gain less per capita of successful collective action. Hence, {{in the absence of}} selective incentives, the incentive for group action diminishes as group size increases, so that large groups are less able to act in their common interest than small ones.|$|R
5|$|In particular, the {{emotional}} {{part of the}} collective consciousness overrides our egoism: as we are emotionally bound to culture, we act socially because we recognize it is the responsible, moral way to act. A key to forming society is social interaction, and Durkheim believes that human beings, when in a <b>group,</b> <b>will</b> inevitably act {{in such a way}} that a society is formed.|$|E
5|$|Say Anything also toured {{with the}} bands Motion City Soundtrack and Saves the Day {{in the fall}} of 2010. Bemis commented on it on his Twitter, {{claiming}} that Say Anything's fans might want to come up with their favorite Two Tongues songs, insinuating that the <b>group</b> <b>will</b> play a few songs on the tour.|$|E
5|$|Millennium Group {{consultant}} Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) {{watches the}} aftermath of the explosion on the news, knowing that the <b>group</b> <b>will</b> ask for his assistance with the case. Dees is among the rescuers seen on the broadcast. Black travels to DC and meets up with fellow group member Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn). The two join the FBI task force investigating the bombing, led by special agents Pierson (Sam Anderson) and Takahashi (Hiro Kanagawa). Watts and Black quickly dismiss several false claims of responsibility by terrorist groups. Black listens to the 911 call left by Dees, deducing that the numbers dialled spell the word kaboom on a telephone keypad.|$|E
50|$|In February 2016 it was {{announced}} a change in format, starting in 2017. Therefore, {{the winners of the}} four <b>groups</b> <b>will</b> be promoted to the OBOS-ligaen, while the bottom seven teams in each <b>groups</b> <b>will</b> be relegated to the 3. Divisjon.|$|R
50|$|First {{stage of}} the <b>group</b> stage <b>will</b> be started on 12 April 2014 to 12 June 2014. All <b>groups</b> <b>will</b> play {{round-robin}} tournament, {{with the exception of}} <b>Group</b> 5 which <b>will</b> play half round-robin tournament.|$|R

5|$|Polio {{vaccination}} {{programs have}} received resistance from {{some people in}} Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Nigeria (the three countries with remaining polio cases). There is distrust surrounding vaccines in Pakistan as in 2011 the CIA organized a fake vaccination program {{in order to help}} find Osama Bin Laden. Additionally, some people believe that the vaccines are secretly being used for sterilization of Muslims. In 2015, the World Health Organization announced a deal with the Taliban to encourage them to distribute the vaccine in areas they control. However, on September 11, 2016, two unidentified gunmen associated with the Pakistani Taliban, Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, shot Zakaullah Khan, a doctor who was administering polio vaccines in Pakistan. The leader of the Jamaat-ul-Ahrar claimed responsibility for the shooting and says that the <b>group</b> <b>will</b> continue to keep doing these kinds of attacks. This resistance to and skepticism of vaccinations has consequently slowed down the polio eradication process within the three remaining countries.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine is the Westernized {{release of}} the puzzle game Puyo Puyo and replaces all of its {{characters}} with those from the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise. The entirety of gameplay takes place across two grid-based boards: the left board {{is used by the}} player, while the right board is controlled by either artificial intelligence or a second player, depending on the game mode. The main objective of the game is to earn as many points as possible by grouping the same coloured beans together as they fall down on the board. The player must arrange beans into groups of at least four of the same colour; should they do this, the beans in the <b>group</b> <b>will</b> disappear and points will be accumulated. If the player drops a group of beans on an uneven surface, any bean left hanging will separate from the original group and will drop to the lowest point on the board. The player may also flip a group of falling beans horizontally or vertically.|$|E
5|$|Electronegativity is a {{chemical}} property {{that describes the}} tendency of an atom or a functional group to attract electrons (or electron density) towards itself. If the bond between sodium and chlorine in sodium chloride were covalent, the pair of shared electrons would be attracted to the chlorine because the effective nuclear charge on the outer electrons is +7 in chlorine but is only +1 in sodium. The electron pair is attracted {{so close to the}} chlorine atom that they are practically transferred to the chlorine atom (an ionic bond). However, if the sodium atom was replaced by a lithium atom, the electrons will not be attracted as close to the chlorine atom as before because the lithium atom is smaller, making the electron pair more strongly attracted to the closer effective nuclear charge from lithium. Hence, the larger alkali metal atoms (further down the <b>group)</b> <b>will</b> be less electronegative as the bonding pair is less strongly attracted towards them. As mentioned previously, francium is expected to be an exception.|$|E

5|$|Jim's plan {{to drive}} home from Philadelphia to see his {{daughter}} CeCe's ballet recital hits a snag when a major investor says he is backing out. Jim asks his wife Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) to record the recital with her phone, which she agrees to do. During {{the opening of the}} recital, she stops recording to take a phone call informing her that she has been chosen to paint an important public mural. In her excitement, she messes up the recording and fails to record any of CeCe's appearance. Jim calls her that evening to tell her the investor backed out, and his <b>group</b> <b>will</b> have to work long hours to make up the lost funds. He asks her to send him her recording of the recital as a way to cheer him up, and Pam confesses that she did not tape it. She tries to make light of the mishap by making self-deprecating remarks and pointing out that they can get recordings of the recital from other attendees, but he becomes frustrated at her, scolding her and starting a fight over his new job, the time he spends away from the family, and the sacrifices they are making to get their new life to work. After he hangs up, Pam breaks down in tears. A previously unseen boom operator named Brian (Chris Diamantopoulos) enters into the shot and comforts her, and tells the crew to stop filming.|$|E
5|$|The magpie is {{generally}} sedentary and territorial throughout its range, living in groups occupying a territory, or in flocks or fringe groups. A group may occupy {{and defend the}} same territory for many years. Much energy is spent defending a territory from intruders, particularly other magpies, and different behaviours are seen with different opponents. The sight of a raptor results in a rallying call by sentinel birds and subsequent coordinated mobbing of the intruder. Magpies place themselves {{either side of the}} bird of prey so that it will be attacked from behind should it strike a defender, and harass and drive the raptor to some distance beyond the territory. A <b>group</b> <b>will</b> use carolling as a signal to advertise ownership and warn off other magpies. In the negotiating display, the one or two dominant magpies parade along the border of the defended territory {{while the rest of the}} group stand back a little and look on. The leaders may fluff their feathers or caroll repeatedly. In a group strength display, employed if both the opposing and defending groups are of roughly equal numbers, all magpies will fly and form a row at the border of the territory. The defending group may also resort to an aerial display where the dominant magpies, or sometimes the whole group, swoop and dive while calling to warn an intruding magpie's group.|$|E
