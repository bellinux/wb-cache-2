5|$|Adolescence and adulthood: When rats forage {{on their}} own, their food choices are {{influenced}} by social interactions that may take place far away from foraging sites. They smell foods on the fur, whiskers and especially the breath of other rats and strongly prefer the foods those rats had previously eaten. This <b>inclines</b> them not to eat poisons avoided by older rats.|$|E
5|$|The {{leaflets}} of {{the plant}} are obovate-oblong and equal-sided, and of a silky texture. The fruits (legumes) are typically one to two inches (2.5 to 5.1cm) long and contain six or seven brownish seeds. The species typically grows {{in areas where the}} soils are relatively deep, especially in semi-arid and wadi areas, and on terraces and slight <b>inclines</b> and hills.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{investigates the}} semigroup of <b>incline</b> Hall matrices. An <b>incline</b> Hall matrix means an <b>incline</b> matrix which {{is greater than}} or equal to an <b>incline</b> {{invertible}} matrix. It is proved that any <b>incline</b> Hall matrix has index. Some necessary and sufficient conditions for an <b>incline</b> Hall matrix to be regular in the semigroup of <b>incline</b> Hall matrices are given and Green's relations on the such semigroup are described. Also the sandwich semigroup of <b>incline</b> Hall matrices is considered. The main results in the present paper generalize some previous results on Boolean matrices, fuzzy matrices and lattice matrices...|$|R

5|$|The Upanishadic age was {{characterized}} by a pluralism of worldviews. While some Upanishads have been deemed 'monistic', others, including the Katha Upanishad, are dualistic. The Maitri {{is one of the}} Upanishads that <b>inclines</b> more toward dualism, thus grounding classical Samkhya and Yoga schools of Hinduism, in contrast to the non-dualistic Upanishads at the foundation of its Vedanta school. They contain a plurality of ideas.|$|E
5|$|As {{the city}} grew, several {{prominent}} buildings were {{constructed in the}} late 19th century, including the Grand Lodge of Canada in 1855, West Flamboro Methodist Church in 1879 (later purchased by Dufferin Masonic Lodge in 1893), a public library in 1890, and the Right House department store in 1893. The first commercial telephone service in Canada, the first telephone exchange in the British Empire, and the second telephone exchange in all of North America were each established in the city between 1877–78. The city had several interurban electric street railways and two <b>inclines,</b> all powered by the Cataract Power Co.|$|E

5000|$|The Knoxville <b>Incline</b> was a {{broad gauge}} <b>inclined</b> railway that ran between Pittsburgh's South Side and Allentown neighborhoods. The <b>incline</b> was {{constructed}} in 1890 and had a track gauge of 9 ft. The charter was in planning as of January 1890, with a target filing date of February 8 of that year, and was originally {{to be called the}} Arlington Avenue <b>Inclined</b> Plane. The last day of service was December 3, 1960. It was demolished in 1960. [...] It was designed by John H. McRoberts, with a length of 2644 feet. The Knoxville <b>Incline</b> briefly controlled the Pittsburgh, Knoxville & St. Clair Electric Railroad, while itself being later controlled by Pittsburgh Railways. During its operation, the <b>incline</b> ferried people and freight between the South Side and Knoxville. The Knoxville <b>Incline</b> and the nearby Mount Oliver <b>Incline</b> enabled the development of land in Allentown and surrounding communities on the hilltop. Like the Nunnery Hill <b>Incline,</b> the Knoxville <b>Incline</b> featured a curve, an unusual engineering feat for an <b>incline.</b>|$|R
40|$|Transitivity of {{generalized}} fuzzy matrices over {{a special}} type of semiring is considered. The semiring is called <b>incline</b> algebra which generalizes Boolean algebra, fuzzy algebra, and distributive lattice. This paper studies the transitive <b>incline</b> matrices in detail. The transitive closure of an <b>incline</b> matrix is studied, and the convergence for powers of transitive <b>incline</b> matrices is considered. Some properties of compositions of <b>incline</b> matrices are also given, {{and a new}} transitive <b>incline</b> matrix is constructed from given <b>incline</b> matrices. Finally, {{the issue of the}} canonical form of a transitive <b>incline</b> matrix is discussed. The results obtained here generalize the corresponding ones on fuzzy matrices and lattice matrices shown in the references...|$|R
5|$|From {{the time}} the GPK was authorised, {{controversy}} raged about the route a railway to England might take. It was plain that Carlisle would be reached from the south; a direct route from Glasgow over the Southern Uplands, the route that {{became known as the}} Annandale line, would involve severe gradients, and pass through almost unpopulated territory. The locomotives available at the time were not thought to be capable of climbing the steep <b>inclines,</b> and rope haulage was put forward by some as the solution. By contrast, a route from Kilmarnock through Cumnock and Dumfries—the Nithsdale line—would have much easier gradients and pass through considerable population centres, bringing in additional traffic. Moreover, the Nithsdale route would be much cheaper to build.|$|E
5|$|In 1854 {{there were}} five or six trains a day between Darlington and Redcar and three a day between Darlington and Frosterly. Travelling at average speeds of , {{passengers}} were charged from 1d per mile for third class to 2.2d per mile for first. Horses were still used on trains in the mid-1850s: a horse-drawn coach was still independently operated between Middlesbrough and Stockton in 1854 on Sundays, as the only S services that run on that day were the mail trains, and locomotives replaced horses on passenger trains to West Auckland in 1856. The S opened a carriage works south of Darlington North Road station in 1853 and later it built a locomotive works nearby to replace its works at Shildon. Designed by William Bouch, who had taken over from Hackworth as Locomotive Supervisor in 1840, it completed its first locomotive in 1864. In 1858 the Brusselton <b>Inclines</b> were bypassed by {{a line from the}} north end of Shildon Tunnel; the same year a passenger service started on the Hagger Leases branch and a mineral line opened from Crook via two <b>inclines</b> to Waterhouse. The section of the SD between West Auckland and Barnard Castle opened for minerals in July 1863 and passengers on 1 August 1863, together with a direct line from Bishop Auckland to West Auckland. Stations at Evenwood and Cockfield replaced stations on the Hagger Leases branch.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{was built}} using the trace italienne style popular during the seventeenth century; its floor has a {{geometric}} design, and bastions {{are the main}} defensive elements. However, unlike other permanent bastioned fortifications, its defensive walls were designed as two sections: {{the lower part of}} the wall is vertical (perpendicular to the base) and the upper part, above the string course, is inclined inwards. This design makes the fort unique in Venezuela; in most castles, the lower portion of the walls <b>inclines</b> outwards at the base and the upper parts are vertical (perpendicular to the base).|$|E

5|$|Green Lantern Coaster {{begins with}} a u-turn out of the station. It ascends a chain lift hill before going down a small dip and into an s-bend {{followed}} by a u-turn. After a slight ascent, the car enters a 120.5° drop – the steepest in the southern hemisphere. The track then returns to approximately two thirds of its original height before entering {{the first set of}} block brakes. These brakes lead into a left turn with reverse or outward banking. It then drops under the block brakes and into the first inversion – a Dive Loop. The inversion begins with half of an inline twist which transitions into half of a vertical loop. Upon exiting the inversion the track <b>inclines</b> into a second set of block brakes. The train then goes around a right u-turn and into the second inversion – a downwards inline twist. This leads into a cutback-style turnaround before entering the final brake run and returning to the station.|$|E
5|$|The {{other main}} sources of {{information}} are maps, particularly those published {{at the time the}} canal was to be converted into a railway. These clearly show twin-track <b>inclines</b> at Capel Ifan and Pont Henry, and because most of the traffic was in the downhill direction, a simple counterbalanced system was probably employed, although it has also been suggested that the barge may have been balanced by a water tank on the second track to more easily control the speed of descent. The Hirwaunissa incline was longer and narrower than the other two, and only included a single track. Recent research has suggested that the incline was powered by a water wheel, with the waste water running down the incline in a side channel, in order to supply the lower levels of the canal.|$|E

[...] The cars would be driven onto the <b>incline</b> platform, which was level and was equipped with rails and (in most cases) overhead trolley wires. The platform, riding on its own rails, would then be pulled up the hill by the cable, carrying the streetcar. Once reaching the top, the streetcar could simply be driven off of the platform, onto the fixed-in-place track along city streets. [...] The 1872-opened Mount Adams <b>Incline</b> began carrying horsecars in 1877, and it was later strengthened for use by electric streetcars, which were much heavier.|$|R
