The Wright brothers made their first successful test flights on December 17, 1903 and were distinguished by their ability to control their flights for substantial periods (more so than the ability to produce lift from an airfoil, which was known). Continuous, reliable control of the airplane was necessary for flights lasting longer than a few seconds.|$|E
25|$|Windows Vista {{contains}} a new networking stack, which brings large improvements {{in all areas}} of network-related functionality. It includes a native implementation of IPv6, as well as complete overhaul of IPv4. IPv6 is now supported by all networking components, services, and the user interface. In IPv6 mode, Windows Vista can use the Link Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) protocol to resolve names of local hosts on a network which does not have a DNS server running. The new TCP/IP stack uses a new method to store configuration settings that enables more <b>dynamic</b> <b>control</b> and does not require a computer restart after settings are changed. The new stack is also based on a strong host model and features an infrastructure to enable more modular components that can be dynamically inserted and removed.|$|E

25|$|As {{would be}} expected, these fifes were notably more {{internally}} in tune than most previous fifes, since {{the designs of}} the 1830s fell from favor, and had the added value of being tunable with each other (by sliding the joint or the head cork). In addition, they gave the player greater <b>dynamic</b> <b>control</b> and could be played even louder than traditional fifes, {{the result of the}} lower cone in the bore. At first, only six hole (Model J) fifes were made, but by 1960, McDonagh designed and Seaman manufactured a 10-hole (Model L). Two of the holes were used by RH2 – covering only one of the two produced F natural. Some players found this quite difficult, so eventually (c. 1970s), an 11-hole model was introduced, the Model M, with both the original double RH2 holes and an RH thumb hole to choose from for the F natural. These were actually ideas derived from several makers of the days of the 19th century, including Giorgi, even though {{there was no need for}} F natural in traditional fife music.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Knee {{osteoarthritis}} (OA) is {{a chronic}} joint condition, with 30 % of those {{over the age}} of 75 exhibiting severe radiographic disease. Nearly 50 % of those with knee OA have experienced a fall in the past year. Falls are a considerable public health concern, with a high risk of serious injury and a significant socioeconomic impact. The ability to defend against a fall relies on adequate <b>dynamic</b> postural <b>control,</b> and alterations in <b>dynamic</b> postural <b>control</b> are seen with normal aging. Neuromuscular changes associated with aging may be responsible for some of these alterations in <b>dynamic</b> postural <b>control.</b> Even greater neuromuscular deficits, which may impact <b>dynamic</b> postural <b>control</b> and the ability to defend against a fall, are seen in people with knee OA. There is little evidence to date on how knee OA affects the ability to respond to and defend against falls and the neuromuscular changes that contribute to balance deficits. As a result, this review will: summarize the key characteristics of postural responses to an external perturbation, highlight the changes in <b>dynamic</b> postural <b>control</b> seen with normal aging, review the neuromuscular changes associated with aging that have known and possible effects on <b>dynamic</b> postural <b>control,</b> and summarize the neuromuscular changes and balance problems in knee OA. Future research to better understand the role of neuromuscular changes in knee OA and their effect on <b>dynamic</b> postural <b>control</b> will be suggested. Such an understanding is critical to the successful creation and implementation of fal...|$|R

2500|$|One {{technique}} is to insert the compressor {{in a parallel}} signal path. This is known as parallel compression, a form of upward compression, which can give a measure of <b>dynamic</b> <b>control</b> without significant audible side effects, if the ratio is relatively low and the compressor's sound is relatively neutral. On the other hand, a high compression ratio with significant audible artifacts can be chosen {{in one of the}} two parallel signal paths—this is used by some concert mixers and recording engineers as an artistic effect called New York compression or Motown compression. Combining a linear signal with a compressor and then reducing the output gain of the compression chain results in low-level detail enhancement without any peak reduction (since the compressor significantly adds to the combined gain at low levels only). This is often beneficial when [...] compressing transient content, since it maintains high-level dynamic liveliness, despite reducing the overall dynamic range.|$|E

[...] Owners expressed concern that duplicating the times achieved in these tests would void their factory warranty. Nissan's chief vehicle engineer Kazutoshi Mizuno has indicated that he has never used the term [...] "launch control", which refers to the act of turning off vehicle <b>dynamic</b> <b>control</b> (VDC) and launching the car at around 4500 rpm. However, Nissan's director of product planning John Wiener stated in an interview with Jay Leno that [...] "we (Nissan) actually offer a 'launch mode'". The GT-R user's manual states that turning off the VDC is only meant for escaping low-traction situations such as mud or snow. Nissan has re-programmed the 2010 model year GT-R to reduce the engine speed at launch to around 3,000-3,500 rpm with VDC enabled, which is meant to improve acceleration times. The new programming was also installed on old 2009 vehicles still in Nissan's inventory, and is available for existing 2009 vehicles.|$|E

40|$|Maintaining {{dynamic balance}} is an {{important}} component of walking function that is likely impaired in chronic stroke survivors, evidenced by an increased prevalence of falls. <b>Dynamic</b> balance <b>control</b> requires maintaining the center of mass (COM) within the base of support during movement. During walking, <b>dynamic</b> balance <b>control</b> is achieved largely by modifying foot placement to adjust the base of support. However, chronic stroke survivors have difficulty with both precision control of foot placement, as well as reduced control of COM movement. The objective of this dissertation was to characterize <b>dynamic</b> balance <b>control</b> strategies during walking in chronic stroke survivors. Additionally, we evaluated whether altered sensory feedback could be used to improve balance control in stroke survivors. <b>Dynamic</b> balance <b>control</b> was characterized during challenging walking conditions in stroke survivors and age-matched neurologically intact individuals. Adaptations to perturbations in frontal plane COM, induced using a custom cable-driven device, were used to further probe mechanisms of <b>dynamic</b> balance <b>control.</b> Despite larger amounts of COM movement and step widths, chronic stroke survivors produced a similar ratio of step width to COM sway, indicating that simply increasing step width does not produce a safer walking pattern for the stroke group. Placement of the paretic limb was unchanged in response to the external perturbations of trunk movement, which might underlie deficits in <b>dynamic</b> balance <b>control.</b> Augmented sensory feedback improved paretic foot placement and COM control, when applied during a stepping or treadmill walking task. These results provide insight into differences in <b>dynamic</b> balance <b>control</b> in stroke while also demonstrating that augmented sensory feedback signals might be used to improve balance control, and thus walking function for chronic stroke survivors...|$|R
