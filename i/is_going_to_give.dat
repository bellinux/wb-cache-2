25|$|After {{finding out}} that Lucifer's gone and that Castiel is back, they find a fatally injured Chuck. As a result of Chuck's injuries, the sun is now dying and the world along with it. Realizing that the only chance {{for the world to}} survive is to kill the Darkness along with Chuck, the Winchesters begin {{gathering}} ghosts to create a bomb to destroy the Darkness.

500|$|Reviewers {{agreed that}} Hosseini's {{succeeded in making}} his {{characters}} complex. Alexander Linklater from The Guardian wrote, [...] "From the moment the realisation dawns that Saboor <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> Pari to {{the wife of a}} wealthy man in Kabul, Hosseini saturates the various layers and characters of his novel with a yearning for the moment that brother and sister will reunite." [...] Soniah Kamal of Atlanta Arts was particularly favorable towards Amra, the Bosnian aid worker who cares for and adopts Roshi, as she [...] "stuns with her hope in humanity no matter what callousness she has witnessed". USA Today critic Kevin Nance found the story of Abdullah and Pari [...] "devastating" [...] but thought the large cast of characters, [...] "including some introduced fairly late in the proceedings, when the reader just wants to return to the core cast", was excessive.|$|E

It was {{sponsored}} by BlackBerry, {{in a move that}} broke U2's prior relationship with Apple Inc. and opened possibilities for collaborations between U2 and Research In Motion on mobile music experiences. Lead singer Bono said of the new relationship, [...] "I'm very excited about this. Research in Motion <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> us what Apple wouldn't: access to their labs and their people so we can do something really spectacular." [...] The explicit corporate sponsorship of a tour was a first for the group, and was due to the anticipated production costs being higher than for any previous U2 tour. The first commercials for a new Blackberry application, called the [...] "U2 Mobile App", began airing in early July 2009 against the song [...] "I'll Go Crazy If I Don't Go Crazy Tonight"; the application allows the user to listen to the album No Line on the Horizon, contains a news section which features updates about the tour, and an interactive section that allows the sharing of images and enables the user to see their position during a concert relative to the band and other application users. Models of the stage were added to Google Earth approximately a week before the scheduled concert took place; tour architect Mark Fisher stated, [...] "We thought {{it would be interesting to}} put up on Google Earth a piece of portable architecture." ...|$|E
2500|$|Spencer Tracy was {{originally}} cast in April 1957 as Joseph Chapin. Because of Tracy's repeated teaming with Katharine Hepburn, the film's producer Charles Brackett {{announced he was}} enthusiastic about casting Hepburn as his wife. In May 1957, model-actress Suzy Parker told the press in an interview: [...] "If I'm good in Kiss Them for Me with Cary Grant, Buddy Adler <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> me a very good role in 10 North Frederick with Spencer Tracy.

2500|$|Revisiting the {{commercial}} in Harper's Magazine {{thirty years after}} it aired, Rebecca Solnit suggested that [...] "1984" [...] did not so much herald {{a new era of}} liberation as a new era of oppression. She wrote, [...] "I want to yell at the liberatory young woman with her sledgehammer, 'Don't do it!' Apple is not different. That industry <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> rise to innumerable forms of triviality and misogyny, to the concentration of wealth and the dispersal of mental concentration. To suicidal, underpaid Chinese factory workers whose reality must be like that of the shuffling workers in {{the commercial}}.

2500|$|Art Miller dismisses {{concerns}} that the perp walk prejudices the jury pool: [...] "This is not Napoleonic justice where the judge is the fact finder, prosecutor and jury. Here the people will decide ultimately. And {{no matter who you}} are, if you have been arrested for something, it is understood {{you are going to be}} subject to all the scrutiny the press <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> you." [...] Israeli researcher Boudana admits that, on a purely informational level, the perp walk itself is harmless. [...] "Indeed, from the moment when the press releases the names of suspects and the motive for their arrest, the persons are identifiable and their presumption of innocence seems to be already compromised," [...] she observes. In a Slate on public shaming as punishment, Emily Bazelon wrote that Americans have become too accustomed to perp walks for them to have any stigmatizing effect. [...] " [...] become part of the wallpaper of the American criminal justice system," [...] she wrote.|$|E
2500|$|On the {{negative}} side, Scott Mendelson of Forbes criticized the film {{for being too}} [...] "dark" [...] and [...] "gritty," [...] saying that the film lacked in humor or excitement, offering little nuance and little artistic interpretation beyond hitting the expected goal posts. He added, [...] "Ridley Scott’s Exodus: Gods and Kings is a terrible film. It is a badly acted and badly written melodrama that takes what should be a passionate and emotionally wrenching story and drains it of all life and all dramatic interest." [...] Pete Hammond of Deadline.com in his review said, [...] "Ridley Scott [...] do a plague well, and here, he gets to do 10 of them. But is this oh-so-familiar tale still fresh enough to get people into theaters in the droves needed to make back the very high production values that we see on screen?" [...] Alonso Duralde of The Wrap also gave a negative review and said, [...] "If you're going into Exodus: Gods and Kings thinking that director Ridley Scott <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> the Moses story anything we didn't already get from Cecil B. DeMille in two versions of The Ten Commandments, prepare to be disappointed." ...|$|E

In March 2012, Lonny Bereal told Kempire Radio that the album would see Rowland returning to her R roots. [...] "She's going in so hard with the R Of course, she <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> the Pop crowd what they're looking for. But, she really is returning to R on this album. Her delivery is real confident now. It's definitely a new Kelly Rowland. She wouldn't even let me put autotune on her voice this time round. She was like 'No, I want people to really get me'." [...] The following month, Rowland told MTV News that the album would have a theme and that she had been documenting the recording process of the album for her fans to see. During an interview with Vegas magazine in June 2012, she described the album as a dedication to [...] "my ladies". She explained, [...] "I want to tell women how incredible we are, how our intuition is so spot-on. Sometimes we don't listen to it, but it is the thing that can actually make us happier." [...] Rowland cited Whitney Houston, Marvin Gaye, and Stevie Wonder as the album's inspirations.|$|E
