Group III-V semiconductors {{can also use}} <b>group</b> <b>IV</b> atoms as either donors or acceptors. When a <b>group</b> <b>IV</b> atom replaces the group III element in the semiconductor lattice, the <b>group</b> <b>IV</b> atom acts as a donor. Conversely, when a <b>group</b> <b>IV</b> atom replaces the group V element, the <b>group</b> <b>IV</b> atom acts as an acceptor. <b>Group</b> <b>IV</b> atoms can act as both donors and acceptors; therefore, they are known as amphoteric impurities.|$|R
