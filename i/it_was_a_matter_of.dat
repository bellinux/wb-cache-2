5|$|The Eucharist {{was a key}} {{center of}} {{controversy}} in the Reformation as it not only focused differences between the reformers and the church but also between themselves. For Zwingli <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> attacking a doctrine that imperiled the understanding and reception of God's gift of salvation, while for Luther <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> defending a doctrine that embodied that gift. It is not known what Zwingli's eucharistic theology was {{before he became a}} reformer and there is disagreement among scholars about his views during his first few years as a priest. In the eighteenth article of The Sixty-seven Articles (1523) which concerns the sacrifice of the mass, he states that it is a memorial of the sacrifice. He expounds on this in An Exposition of the Articles (1523).|$|E
5|$|In a deleted scene set {{after the}} end of the episode, Walter talks with the first patient Joseph Slater, who wonders why he was chosen to have a piece of Walter's brain. Walter {{responds}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> circumstance, as Slater shared his blood type and had a young resilient brain. Walter also says he himself cannot be cured, as his madness had nothing to do with the missing parts of his brain.|$|E
5|$|After the Duke of Northumberland's {{attainder}} {{the entire}} Dudley inheritance had disappeared. His sons {{had to start}} from scratch in rebuilding the family fortunes, as they had renounced any rights to their father's former possessions or titles when their own attainders had been lifted in January 1558. Robert Dudley financed the lifestyle expected of a royal favourite by large loans from City of London merchants until in April 1560 Elizabeth granted him his first export licence, worth £6,000 p.a. He also received some of his father's lands, but since he was not the family heir <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> some difficulty to find a suitable estate for his intended peerage. In June 1563 the Queen granted him Kenilworth Manor, Castle, and Park, together with the lordships of Denbigh and Chirk in North Wales. Other grants were to follow. Eventually, Leicester and his elder brother Ambrose, Earl of Warwick, came to preside over the greatest aristocratic interest in the West Midlands and North Wales.|$|E

25|$|Asquith {{was born}} in Morley, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, the younger son of Joseph Dixon Asquith (1825–1860) and his wife Emily, née Willans (1828–1888). The couple also had three daughters, of whom only one survived infancy. The Asquiths were an old Yorkshire family, with a long nonconformist tradition. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> family pride, shared by Asquith, that an ancestor, Joseph Asquith, was imprisoned {{for his part in}} the pro-Roundhead Farnley Wood Plot of 1664.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the arrival}} of Christians from Persia, their bishops, priests or laymen began visiting them.

25|$|The firm's five {{founding}} partners—William Panton, Thomas Forbes, John Leslie, William Alexander, and Charles McLatchy—formed Panton, Leslie & Company at St. Augustine, {{the capital}} of British East Florida, in late 1782 or early 1783. They were all Scotsmen who had traded with the colonists and Indians of South Carolina, Georgia, and East Florida {{before and during the}} American Revolution. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> survival for them to remain loyal to the Kingdom of Great Britain, as most of their trade goods, especially guns, lead, and gunpowder, came from the mother country, and rebelling against the British would have cut off those supplies.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after her}} dismissal, Myers filed a Section 1983 suit {{in federal court}} for the Eastern District of Louisiana, against Connick both {{personally}} and in his official capacity. She alleged violation of her First Amendment rights and sought back pay, reinstatement and compensatory and punitive damages. At first she sought a preliminary injunction, but Judge Jack Gordon converted it to a trial on the merits. It was held before him {{two months after the}} firing. Myers argued that she had been fired for distributing the questionnaire; Connick claimed <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> her insubordination in refusing to accept the transfer.|$|E

25|$|Attlee and Bevin worked {{together}} on the decision to produce a British atomic bomb, despite intense opposition from pro-Soviet elements of the Labour Party, a group Bevin detested. The decision was taken in secret by a small Cabinet committee. Bevin told the committee in October 1946, that 'We've got to have this thing over here whatever it costs … We've {{got to have the}} bloody Union Jack flying on top of it.' <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> both prestige and national security. Those ministers who would have opposed the bomb on grounds of cost, Hugh Dalton and Sir Stafford Cripps, were excluded from the meeting in January 1947 at which the final decision was taken.|$|E
25|$|Dugas later {{traveled}} to Tokyo {{and took up}} residence at the Imperial Hotel. There she met a young John Kilpatrick. They embarked on an affair, and Kilpatrick delayed his return home to New York. His family became concerned about his ever-lengthening travels and dwindling funds and hired a Pinkerton detective to travel to Tokyo to determine what was delaying him. Upon discovering that May Dugas {{was the source of}} Kilpatrick’s delay, Detective Edwards used what leverage he could, primarily his knowledge of Dugas’s life as a prostitute, to persuade her to release Kilpatrick from her clutches. Dugas did leave Kilpatrick, who returned to New York, only to commit suicide a few months later. One of the coroners on the case suggested that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> homicide, not suicide, and another source asserted that heartbreak over Dugas was the reason for his suicide.|$|E
25|$|Not {{long after}} his condemnation, Photios had reingratiated himself with Basil, and became tutor to the Byzantine emperor's children. From {{surviving}} letters of Photios written during his exile at the Skepi monastery, {{it appears that}} the ex-patriarch brought pressure to bear on the Byzantine emperor to restore him. Ignatios's biographer argues that Photios forged a document relating to the genealogy and rule of Basil's family, and had it placed in the imperial library where a friend of his was a librarian. According to this document, the Byzantine emperor's ancestors were not mere peasants as everyone believed but descendants of the Arsacid Dynasty of Armenia. True or not, this story does reveal Basil's dependence on Photios for literary and ideological matters. Following Photios's recall, Ignatios and the ex-patriarch met, and publicly expressed their reconciliation. When Ignatios died on October 23, 877, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> course that his old opponent replaced him on the patriarchal throne three days later. Shaun Tougher asserts that from this point on Basil no longer simply depended on Photios, but in fact he was dominated by him.|$|E

25|$|The trial against Bevan Spencer von Einem for {{the murder}} of Richard Kelvin opened at the Supreme Court Building of South Australia on 15 October 1984 before Mr. Justice White. A jury of 12 people (seven women and five men) were {{selected}} and were agreed upon by the prosecution and defence. Einem pleaded not guilty, and his defence was led by barrister Barry Jennings, who was assisted by Helena Jasinski, who had been Einem's solicitor {{from the start of the}} police investigation of him in the murder during the previous year. The prosecution was led by Brian Martin QC (later the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory), with assistance from Paul Rofe QC (who went on to be Director of the Department of Public Prosecutions). For the prosecution, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> proving Einem's guilt (along with that of unknown persons) by presenting the strong scientific evidence that had been gathered during the investigation, and disproving Einem's story of being in contact with Richard Kelvin on the night of 5 June 1983. For the defence, it was a case of trying to make Einem's story hold up in court, and raising doubts about his ability to keep Richard Kelvin captive for five weeks and committing the murder.|$|E
