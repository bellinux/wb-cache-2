This resulted in a crash landing at Pithiviers. Although the aircraft was damaged beyond repair, there were no fatalities among the 70 occupants (six crew and 64 passengers). The evidence at the crash site seemed to suggest that an internal failure occurred inside the no. 4 engine, which caused over-speeding and subsequent disintegration of the reduction <b>gear</b> <b>pinion</b> bearing.|$|E

40|$|LecturePg. 85 - 90. High-speed <b>gear</b> <b>pinion</b> precession-shuttling and noise, {{caused by}} {{overhanging}} {{weight of the}} coupling and by misalignment forces generated by tooth friction in the coupling, are being controlled by reduced bearing clearances. A statistical analysis of high-speed gear, mesh-frequency, vibrations was used to decide that sleeve bearings would not control the precession-shuttling adequately and that use of tilting-shoe radial bearings was necessary. Noise data collected to solve the pinion precession-shuttling problem indicate that acoustic passages in the gearbox may be excited by windage at frequencies not related to vibration multiples of mechanical running speed or gear mesh-frequency. Measured resonant frequencies of structural sections of the gear-box when matched to measured acoustic frequencies or mechanical vibration frequencies also appear to cause unnecessary noise. These experiences suggest that some relatively minor design changes, by gear manufacturer-customer agreement, could reduce the chance of mechanical malfunction by installation of tilting-shoe bearings and could eliminate noise sources in preference to use of noise abating gear-box covers...|$|E

At first, relation between loading weight and applied stress was investigated when loading weight Mb on the bogie was changed. Power contribution ratio was estimated using this relationship. The effect of the condition of power contribution ratio on the normal stress applied onto the rack tooth was simulated using obtained relations. The optimum power contribution ratio of front <b>pinion</b> <b>gear</b> was defined as an effective designing parameter to reduce the stress applied onto the rack tooth. A reduction ratio determined with the ratio of maximum compression stress on the tooth considering power contribution ratio to that of conventional case was estimated when the optimum power contribution ratio was considered.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to find and develop methods that enhance and support the creation of evolvable master process plans with possibilities to challenge productivity and meet changing design requirements. The condition for achieving this is primarily that both the fundamental thinking and the results behind a process plan can be described. How should this be done? The focus is laid on process planning of gear transmission parts for heavy vehicles like trucks and coaches. Process planning is the activity where design and manufacturing are brought together with the common target to achieve both a competitive product and production process. There are many factors that influence the process planner when a new product or process shall be introduced for production. Process planning is, in most cases, performed by an experienced, skilled person but without any defined methodology or way of working. Much of the process planning {{is based on the}} retrieval of solutions already used. Much research effort has been devoted to developing systems for computer-aided process planning (CAPP). Yet CAPP systems have not been accepted and spread over a wide front within the manufacturing industry, much because of the functional incompleteness combined with the difficulties of adopting knowledge and changing requests. A method for systematic process planning is proposed as a way to perform and describe the procedure of creating a process plan. The method facilitates the interpretation and understanding of the plan, not only immediately for the process planner responsible, but also for designers, engineers, researchers and other interest groups involved in a manufacturing process. In the last chapter is a case study regarding manufacturing of a bevel <b>gear</b> <b>pinion</b> presented to exemplify use of the proposed method for systematic process planning. KUG...|$|E
40|$|Lecturepg. 113 - 128 A 10, 000 psi high {{pressure}} natural gas injection compressor train was procured, manufactured, tested and {{installed in the}} Boquer?n production facility in Eastern Venezuela. The injection machinery consisted of three (3) parallel slow speed reciprocating gas compressors each driven by a natural gas driven internal combustion engine through a speed reducing gearbox. The equipment had been purchased in an early phase of the project by the original oil company, so {{it could not be}} changed. Due to the critical timing of compression required to maintain reservoir pressure and incremental oil recovery, the equipment could not be changed without large financial consequences. After preliminary review of the purchased equipment, it was recognized early by the engineer, procure, and construct (EPC) design engineering team that the compressor type and selection including the design were not the preferred arrangement. However, due to schedule and contract constraints the selection and design could not be significantly changed. Although the compressor itself was considered properly selected there was considerable attention given to the drive train. This drive train consisted of the internal combustion engine, a gearbox, a steel torque shaft that connected the gearbox to the compressor and an intermediate bearing/bearing support. As the project progressed there were significant design improvements made to improve the safety, operation, and life of the compressor train. The initial design of the torque shaft indicated that it would fail every time the machinery experienced a shutdown. In order to overcome such a failure the drive train included a special coupling with shear bolts that would shear every time the compressor train had shut down, the function of which was to prevent the torque shaft from fatigue failure. Shearing bolts during every shutdown was not considered safe or acceptable operating practice. During the course of the project, there were significant improvements made, first to the torque shaft, and then to the coupling connecting the gearbox to the torque shaft, then to the coupling between the engine and high speed <b>gear</b> <b>pinion.</b> The torsional characteristics were improved significantly with the upgrades and design improvements. After installation, extensive field testing was conducted on each injection gas compressor to ascertain the torsional characteristics of the drive train, including stresses in critical components during the shutdown events. The data confirmed that the torque shaft was in fact designed for infinite life and would not fail from material fatigue as was feared initially. During the design phases engineering consultants were contracted to perform torsional studies to confirm the torsional critical speeds initially predicted by the compressor manufacturer. After installation the same consultant used strain gauges to measure the torsional shear stresses and the torsional critical speeds. There was an enormous amount of valuable engineering data generated during the design verification process and field testing. The authors feel that this information should be shared with others in {{the oil and gas industry}} when considering this type of machinery and machinery train for their {{high pressure}} injection gas compressor services or projects...|$|E
