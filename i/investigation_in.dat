5|$|The game is Barlow's first project {{since his}} {{departure}} from Climax Studios, {{after which he}} became independent. He wanted to develop a game that was dependent on the narrative, and avoided working on the game until he was settled on an idea that was possible to execute. Barlow eventually decided to create a police procedural game, and incorporate live action footage. He conducted research for the game by watching existing police interviews. Upon doing so, he discovered recurring themes in the suspects' answers, and decided to incorporate ambiguity to the <b>investigation</b> <b>in</b> the game.|$|E
5|$|The lack {{of flight}} {{recorder}} {{data for the}} last six minutes of the flight added significant complexity to the investigation and was a major factor in its lengthy duration.

As the aircraft was broken into 2 million pieces by the impact, this process was time-consuming and tedious. The investigation became the largest and most expensive transport accident <b>investigation</b> <b>in</b> Canadian history, costing C$57 million (US$48.5 million) over five years.|$|E
