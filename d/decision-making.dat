40|$|Abstract—Uncertainty is the {{intrinsic}} property of spatial data {{and one of}} important factors affecting the course of spatial data mining. There are diversiform forms for the essentiality and aspect of uncertainty in the spatial objects of geographic information system. Essentiality of uncertainty may consist {{of the components of}} randomicity, fuzzy, chaos, etc. And the latter, i. e. aspect of uncertainty, may include error uncertainty, location uncertainty, attribute uncertainty, topology uncertainty, inconsonance uncertainty, immaturity uncertainty and so on. Spatial data mining, which is based on uncertainty, is the course of discovering knowledge in the spatial data including the attribute of uncertainty. Spatial data is the necessary object operated by spatial data mining and its uncertainty can exist in the whole process of data input, data processing, data output, etc. Uncertainty can affect directly or indirectly the quality of spatial data mining. Specially, uncertainty of spatial data can affect directly or indirectly the veracity and reliability of ultimate <b>decision-makings</b> and may lead to produce false results and even reverse conclusions. Spatial data mining based on uncertainty has taken synchronously into account the two associated factors of uncertainty of data and spatial data mining. Therefore, due to considering the uncertainty, it can enhance the reliability of discovering knowledge and improve the veracity and reliability of spatial as well as raise the efficiency and practicability for the <b>decision-makings</b> made by operation departments. In this paper, aiming at massive spatial data belonging to the Government Geographic Information System, some work has been done under the conditions of summarizing existing relevant theory and technology of spatial data mining and uncertainty and carry out necessary practice.

30|$|The {{proposed}} method {{represents the}} movement of the injection water of the new well properly because it maintains the bimodal distribution with reasonable facies distribution. The strategy 1 makes meaningful WWCT predictions with significantly reduced uncertainty range compared to the initial models and the ensemble-based techniques (Fig.  13 e). In the case of the strategies 2 and 3, water breakthrough time is predicted with a very high reliability (Fig.  13 f, g). Also, its uncertainty is appropriate to provide a rational basis for <b>decision-makings.</b> For example, we can decide the location of an infill well based on these credible results. The outstanding success of the proposed method is proven through the facies distribution, its histogram, the preexisting production wells, and the infill well.|$|R
