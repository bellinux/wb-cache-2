A subject S judges that some object a is F, because S has <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> believing that some object is F and wrongly believes that a is one such object — i. e., an object x such that S has <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> believing that x is F.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{a research}} of acquital (vrijspraak) in some criminal cases that {{were made by the}} judge, and related with the law effort of appellate and cassation. Due process of law in criminal justice of Indonesia tends to be notgiving satisfaction for the justice seekers.
