60|$|The pair {{of friends}} had traversed with their usual cordiality the grassy wilds of Liddesdale, {{and crossed the}} {{opposite}} part of Cumberland, emphatically called The Waste. In these solitary regions the cattle under the charge of our drovers derived their subsistence chiefly by picking their food as they went along the drove-road, or sometimes by the tempting opportunity of a START AND OWERLOUP, or invasion of the neighbouring pasture, where an occasion presented itself. But now the scene changed before them. They were descending towards a fertile and enclosed country, where no such liberties could be taken with impunity, or without a previous arrangement and bargain with the possessors of the ground. This was more especially the case, as a great northern fair was upon the eve of taking place, where both the Scotch and English drover expected to dispose of {{a part of their}} cattle, which it was desirable to produce in the market rested and in good order. Fields were therefore difficult to be obtained, and only upon high terms. This necessity occasioned a temporary separation betwixt the two friends, who went to bargain, each as he could, for the separate accommodation of his herd. Unhappily it chanced that both of them, unknown to each other, thought of bargaining for the ground they wanted on the property of a country gentleman of some fortune, whose estate lay in the neighbourhood. The English drover applied to the bailiff on the property, who was known to him. It chanced that the Cumbrian Squire, who had entertained some suspicions of his manager's honesty, was taking occasional measures to ascertain how far they were well founded, and had desired that any enquiries about his enclosures, with a view to occupy them for a temporary purpose, should be referred to himself. As however, Mr. Ireby had gone the day before upon a journey of some miles distance to the northward, the bailiff chose to consider the check upon his full powers as for the time removed, and concluded that he should best consult his master's interest, and perhaps his own, in making an agreement with Harry Wakefield. Meanwhile, ignorant of what his comrade was doing, Robin Oig, on his side, chanced to be overtaken by a good-looking smart little man upon a pony, most knowingly <b>hogged</b> and <b>cropped,</b> as was then the fashion, the rider wearing tight leather breeches, and long-necked bright spurs. This cavalier asked one or two pertinent questions about markets and the price of stock. So Robin, seeing him a well-judging civil gentleman, took the freedom to ask him whether he could let him know if there was any grass-land to be let in that neighbourhood, for the temporary accommodation of his drove. He could not have put the question to more willing ears. The gentleman of the buckskins was the proprietor, with whose bailiff Harry Wakefield had dealt, or was in the act of dealing.|$|R
40|$|Average net {{farm income}} was $ 69, 787 in 2009 for the 95 farms {{included}} in this annual report of the Southwestern Minnesota Farm Business Management Association. Average earnings decreased by 63 % from $ 190, 901 in 2008. This continues the downward trend that began in 2008 {{after six years of}} steady increases. As expected, low incomes for virtually all types of livestock operations pulled the average down, and some livestock farms sustained large losses. Crop farms, on average, were profitable but also earned much lower incomes compared to recent years. Median net farm income, or the income earned by the middle farm, was $ 96, 130, substantially higher than the average. This indicates that the average was pulled down or skewed by large losses sustained by some farms. This is a reversal from previous years when large profits made by some farms pushed the average income above the median. • As is the case every year, incomes varied widely across the entire group. The average net farm income for the most profitable 20 % of the farms was $ 246, 125 while the least profitable 20 % lost $- 192, 897. • Average gross cash income was virtually unchanged from 2008 (Figure 2) while cash expenses increased by 3 %. Most of the reduction in income resulted from reduced value of inventories. • Government payments accounted for 2 % of gross cash farm income (Figure 2). Crop sales accounted for 48 % of income while livestock sales were 41 %. • Average rate of return on assets (ROA) was 3 % with assets valued at adjusted cost or book value, down from 11 % in 2008 (Figure 3). Rate of return on equity (ROE) averaged 2 %, down from 15 %. The fact that ROE was lower than ROA indicates that debt capital earned less than the average interest rate paid. This has not happened for the association farms since 2001. • The average farm reported net worth growth of $ 78, 660. Net worth growth from earnings (farm and non-farm) averaged $ 25, 212. The remainder resulted from changes in asset values. The average debt-to-asset ratio increased slightly from 39 % to 40 % (Figure 4). Crop Returns • Corn and soybean yields were up. Corn averaged 185 bushels per acre compared to 172 in 2008. Soybeans yields averaged 49 bushels, up from 44 in 2008 (Figure 5). • Both corn and soybean prices received decreased but remained above historical averages. The average price received for corn was $ 3. 83 per bushel compared to $ 4. 51 in 2008. Soybeans average $ 10. 15 per bushel, down from $ 10. 83. • The cost to raise an acre of corn (with land rent) increased 18 % while soybean costs increased 11 %. The cost to produce a bushel of corn on cash rented land increased from $ 2. 90 per bushel in 2008 to $ 3. 30 in 2009, while soybean costs per bushel increased from $ 7. 21 to $ 8. 18. These costs include a charge for unpaid labor and management, but do not include a charge for equity capital. Type of Farm: Crop farms had the highest net earnings, with an average net farm income of $ 115, 857 and an average ROA of 6. 6 % (Figure 6). • Hog/crop and hog farms (those farms with over 70 % of gross income from sale of hogs or a combination of <b>hogs</b> and <b>crops)</b> suffered large losses, with an average net farm loss of $- 370, 973 and an ROA of - 10 % (Figure 7). • Beef/crop and beef farms (those farms with over 70 % of gross income from sale of beef or a combination of beef and crops) experienced reduced earnings, with average net farm incomes of $ 69, 569 and an ROA of 4. 5 % (Figure 8). Size of Farm • When sorted by gross farm income, medium sized farms, those with sales of between $ 250, 000 and $ 1, 000, 000, were most profitable with rates of return on assets of around 7 %. • The largest farms, those with gross revenue over $ 1, 000, 000, were the least profitable based on rate of return on assets. This group earned an average ROA of - 2. 9 %. However, this is probably more a function of enterprise rather than business size as this group includes several hog farms that suffered large losses. The report provides additional information on profitability, liquidity, and solvency as well as other whole-farm information and detailed information on crop and livestock enterprises.

40|$|Average net {{farm income}} was $ 36, 614 in 2001 for the 207 farms {{included}} in this annual report of the Southwestern Minnesota Farm Business Management Association. This is a sharp drop (55 %) from the average net farm income of $ 81, 750 in 2000 (Figure 1). As in previous years, the actual profit levels experienced by individual farms vary greatly from the overall average profit. When the net farm incomes for the 207 farms in the report are ranked from lowest to highest, the resulting graph shows how much the incomes do vary (Figure 2). Twenty-four percent of the farms experienced negative net farm income in 2001; 8 % had incomes over $ 100, 000. Most of the net farm incomes ranged from below 0 to about $ 150, 000. The median or middle income was $ 29, 040. The high 20 % of the farms had an average net farm income of $ 130, 230 which is a 35 % decrease from 2000. The low 20 % of the farms had an average loss of $ 32, 064 in 2000 which is much worse than 2000. Average gross cash farm income in 2001 was $ 433, 698. This was a 3 % increase from 2000. Four sources of sales again dominated: hogs, corn, soybeans, and beef finishing (Figure 3). These sources were quite stable between 2000 and 2001 except beef finishing which increased by 14 %. Government payments of all types decreased slightly to $ 48, 208 per average farm in 2001. Government payments for the average farm were $ 50, 567 in 2000, $ 44, 674 in 1999, $ 30, 021 in 1998, and $ 12, 257 in 1997. As a percentage of total income, government payments were 11 % in 2001, compared to 12 % in 2000, 11 % in 1999, 8 % in 1998, and 3 % in 1997. Cash expenses increased 3 % {{to an average of}} $ 358, 506 in 2001. As a percentage of both cash expenses and depreciation in 2001, feeder purchases; feed, seed, fertilizer, and crop chemicals; and land rent continue to dominate (Figure 4). Both the average rate of return on assets (ROA) and the rate of return to equity (ROE) decreased substantially in 2001 compared to 2000 (Figure 5). In 2001 ROA averaged 6 % and ROE was 4 % using assets valued on a cost basis. Using a market value basis, average total equity (of the 178 sole proprietors) was $ 618, 197 at the end of 2001. This was an increase of $ 20, 730 during the year for these 178 farms (p. 17). Average equity has continued to improve since 1986. The average debt-asset ratio did not change, it remained at 47 % at the end of 2001 (Figure 6). The average corn yield was 128 bushels per acre; soybeans were at 42 bushels per acre (Figure 7). Both yields were lower than the previous 3 years. Results by Type of Farm The 207 farms in the report were classified as a certain type of farm (e. g., hog) on the basis of having 70 percent or more of their gross sales from that category. Using this 70 percent rule in 2001, there were 107 <b>crop</b> farms, 11 <b>hog</b> farms, 22 <b>crop</b> and <b>hog</b> farms, 9 beef farms, and 12 crop and beef farms. (There were 40 farms which did not have a single source (or pair of sources) of income over 70 %.) Compared to 2000, all types of farms (except beef farms) had lower net farm incomes in 2001 (Figure 8). A similar story {{can be seen in the}} rate of return to assets (ROA) (Figure 9). (Assets are valued on a cost-basis for ROA). Using assets valued on a market basis, the average crop farm has a debt-to-asset ratio of 41 % at the end of 2001 (Figure 10).

40|$|Average net {{farm income}} rebounded to $ 70, 007 in 2002 for the 188 farms {{included}} in this annual report of the Southwestern Minnesota Farm Business Management Association. This is a sharp increase (91 %) from the average net farm income of $ 36, 614 in 2001. As in previous years, the actual profit levels experienced by individual farms vary greatly from the overall average profit. When the net farm incomes for the 188 farms in the report are ranked from lowest to highest, the resulting graph shows how much the incomes do vary. Nine percent of the farms experienced negative net farm income in 2002; 26 % had incomes over $ 100, 000. The median or middle income was $ 61, 465. The high 20 % of the farms had an average net farm income of $ 181, 981 which is a 40 % increase from 2001. The low 20 % of the farms had an average loss of $- 22, 998 in 2002. Most of the added income resulted from crop inventory increases. Average gross cash farm income actually decreased slightly, to $ 428, 084, a 1 % decrease from 2001. Four sources of sales again dominated: hogs, corn, soybeans, and beef finishing. Corn and soybean income increased by 17 % and 11 %, respectively, over 2001 levels while hog income was down 6 %. Government payments of all types averaged $ 15, 927 in 2002, a 67 % reduction from the previous year. Payments were reduced because of lower direct crop payments and higher crop prices, resulting in very limited LDP payments. Government payments for the average farm were $ 48, 208 in 2001, $ 50, 567 in 2000, $ 44, 674 in 1999, $ 30, 021 in 1998, and $ 12, 257 in 1997. As a percentage of total income, government payments were 4 % in 2002, compared to 11 % in 2001, 12 % in 2000, 11 % in 1999, 8 % in 1998, and 3 % in 1997. Cash expenses decreased very slightly (2 %) {{to an average of}} $ 352, 995 in 2002. As a percentage of total expenses including depreciation, feeder purchases; feed, seed, fertilizer, and crop chemicals; and land rent continue to be the largest expense items. Both the average rate of return on assets (ROA) and the rate of return to equity (ROE) increased in 2002 compared to 2001. In 2002 ROA averaged 9 % and ROE was 11 % using assets valued on a cost basis. The fact that ROE exceeded ROA indicates that debt capital was earning more than its cost. Using a market value basis, average total equity (of the 161 sole proprietors) was $ 699, 570 at the end of 2002. This was an increase of $ 54, 147 during the year for these farms (p. 17). Average equity has continued to improve since 1986. The average debt-asset ratio decreased from 47 % {{at the beginning of the}} year to 45 % at the end of 2002. The average corn yield was 151 bushels per acre; soybeans were at 49 bushels per acre. Both were substantially higher than 2001 yields. Results by Type of Farm The 188 farms in the report were classified as a certain type of farm (e. g., hog) on the basis of having 70 percent or more of their gross sales from that category. Using this 70 percent rule in 2002, there were 94 <b>crop</b> farms, 10 <b>hog</b> farms, 15 <b>crop</b> and <b>hog</b> farms, 10 beef farms, and 10 crop and beef farms. (There were 40 farms which did not have a single source (or pair of sources) of income over 70 %.) The beef farms were the most profitable in 2002, after experiencing very low returns in 2001. Crop and crop/beef farms also averaged incomes higher than the Association average. The average hog farm in the Association suffered a substantial loss. Beef farms, along with crop farms, also had the highest rate of return on assets (ROA. (Assets are valued on a cost-basis for ROA). Using assets valued on a market basis, the average crop farm has a debt-to-asset ratio of 42 % at the end of 2002.

This is a large increase from the extremely low levels of 1998 and continues the historical pattern of large swings in farm income. Almost all of the increase {{can be attributed to}} the increases in the value of inventories and an average government payment of $ 44, 674 in 1999. (Net farm income is an accrual measure calculated by subtracting total cash farm expense and depreciation from gross cash farm income and adjusting for changes in inventory items.) After subtracting an opportunity cost for equity capital, labor and management, earnings follow a similar but lower pattern. As in previous years, the actual profit levels experienced by individual farms vary greatly from the overall average profit. The high 20 % of these farms had an average profit of $ 132, 905 which is an increase from 1998. The low 20 % of the farms had an average loss of -$ 16, 562 in 1999 which is better than 1998. Average gross cash farm income in 1999 was $ 388, 731. This was a 5 % increase from 1998. Four sources of sales made up more than 70 % of total income in 1999 : corn, hogs, soybeans, and beef finishing. In 1998, these four sources also contributed about 70 %. Soybean sales decreased 21 % between 1998 and 1999. Hog sales increased by 6 %; corn sales by 17 %, and beef finishing by 45 %. Government payments of all types increased to $ 44, 674 per average farm in 1999 [...] an increase from $ 30, 021 in 1998 and $ 12, 257 in 1997. As a percentage of total income, government payments were 11 % in 1999, compared to 8 % in 1998 and 3 % in 1997. The average total government payments in 1999 include $ 11, 031 from FAIR transition payments for the 1999 year; $ 168 for FAIR transition payments for the 2000 year but received in 1999; $ 11, 555 for (emergency) market loss payments; $ 18, 992 for loan deficiency payments (LDPs) for all crops; $ 423 for the conservation reserve program (CRP); and $ 2, 504 for other payments.

As a percentage of both cash expenses and depreciation in 1999, feeder purchases; seed, fertilizer, and crop chemicals; feed expenses; land rent; and depreciation continue to dominate. Both the average rate of return on assets (ROA) and the rate of return to equity (ROE) increased substantially in 1999 compared to 1998. In 1999 ROA averaged 7 % and ROE was just under 7 % using assets valued on a cost basis. Using a market value basis, average total equity (of the 185 sole proprietors) was $ 544, 539 at the end of 1999. This was an increase of $ 33, 532 during the year. Average equity has continued to improve since 1986. The average debt-asset ratio remained unchanged at 49 % at the end of 1999.

40|$|Average net {{farm income}} was $ 81, 750 in 2000 for the 212 farms {{included}} in this annual report of the Southwestern Minnesota Farm Business Management Association. The median or middle income was $ 69, 414. This is the second annual increase from the extremely low levels of 1998. Almost all of the increase {{can be attributed to}} the increase in the value of inventories, government payment, and the decrease in depreciation charge. However, the change in depreciation was almost entirely due to a change in the accounting procedures, not a change in purchasing behavior by farmers. Using the "new" depreciation rules, net farm income (NFI) in the previous 5 years was estimated to be higher than when the "old" rules were used. For example, the "new" NFI was estimated to be $ 61, 347 in 1999 which is $ 17, 585 higher than the NFI using the "old" rules. As in previous years, the actual profit levels experienced by individual farms vary greatly from the overall average profit. When the net farm incomes for the 212 farms in the report are ranked from lowest to highest, the resulting graph shows how much the incomes do vary. Several farms experienced negative income and several experienced very high incomes. Most of the net farm incomes ranged from below 0 to about $ 150, 000. The median or middle income was $ 69, 414. The high 20 % of the farms had an average net farm income of $ 199, 929 which is an increase from 1999. The low 20 % of the farms had an average loss of $ 424 in 2000 which is better than 1999. Average gross cash farm income in 2000 was $ 422, 897. This was a 9 % increase from 1999. Four sources of sales again dominated: corn, hogs, soybeans, and beef finishing. Soybean sales increased 18 % between 1999 and 2000; hog sales, by 14 %; corn sales by 4 %, and beef finishing by 7 %.

As a percentage of both cash expenses and depreciation in 2000, feeder purchases; feed, seed, fertilizer, and crop chemicals; and rent dominate. Both the average rate of return on assets (ROA) and the rate of return to equity (ROE) increased substantially in 2000 compared to 1999. In 2000 ROA averaged 12 % and ROE was 19 % using assets valued on a cost basis. Using a market value basis, average total equity (of the 181 sole proprietors) was $ 605, 149 at the end of 2000. This was an increase of $ 50, 064 during the year for these 181 farms. Average equity has continued to improve since 1986. The average debt-asset ratio improved, that is, decreased to 47 % at the end of 2000. The average corn yield was 150 bushels per acre; soybeans were at 46 bushels per acre. Results by Type of Farm The 212 farms in the report are classified as a certain type of farm (e. g., hog) on the basis of having 70 percent or more of their gross sales from that category. Using this 70 percent rule in 2000, there are 63 <b>crop</b> farms, 13 <b>hog</b> farms, 24 <b>crop</b> and <b>hog</b> farms, 6 beef farms, and 15 crop and beef farms. (There are 87 farms which do not have a single source (or pair of sources) of income over 70 %.) Compared to 1999, all types of farms (except beef farms) had better net farm incomes in 2000. A similar story can be seen in the rate of return to assets (ROA). (Assets are valued on a cost-basis for ROA). Using assets valued on a market basis, the average crop farm has a debt-to-asset ratio of 45 % at the end of 2000. Farms with 70 % of their income from either hogs or beef had an average debt-to-asset ratio higher than 50 %. The report provides additional information on profitability, liquidity, and solvency as well as other whole-farm information and detailed information on crop and livestock enterprises. Also reported are whole-farm financial condition and performance by county, sales size class, and type of farm. Farm Management,...|$|R
40|$|Average net {{farm income}} was $ 147, 862 in 2005 for the 107 farms {{included}} in this annual report of the Southwestern Minnesota Farm Business Management Association. This is a 50 % increase over the average income of $ 98, 362 in 2004. In constant dollars, 2005 was the most profitable year for association members in the past 20. Outstanding crop yields, high profits for hog operations and higher government payments were factors that combined to make 2005 a very profitable year for the average association farm. As in previous years, the actual profit levels experienced by individual farms vary greatly from the overall average profit. When the net farm incomes for the 107 farms in the report are ranked from lowest to highest, the resulting graph shows how much the incomes do vary. One percent of the farms experienced negative net farm incomes in 2005; 57 % had incomes over $ 100, 000. The median or middle income was $ 108, 456. The high 20 % of the farms had an average net farm income of $ 376, 270, which is a 28 % increase from 2004. The low 20 % of the farms had an average net farm income of $ 30, 854 in 2005, {{as opposed to a}} $- 6, 068 loss in 2004. Average gross cash farm income was $ 579, 201, a 17 % increase from 2004. Three sources of sales dominated: hogs, corn, and soybeans, followed by government payments and beef finishing. Total crop sales accounted for 33 % while livestock sales and contracting income accounted for 47 % of total cash receipts. Government payments of all types averaged $ 56, 461 in 2005, a 103 % increase from the previous year. The average farm received $ 26, 519 in LDP payments in 2005, mostly due to low corn prices at harvest. This compared to $ 8, 966 in 2004. Government payments for the average farm were $ 27, 798 in 2004, $ 25, 855 in 2003, $ 15, 927 in 2002, and $ 48, 208 in 2001. As a percentage of total income, government payments were 10 % in 2005 compared to 6 % in 2004, 5 % in 2003, 4 % in 2002, and 11 % in 2001. Cash expenses increased 18 % to an average of $ 477, 476 in 2005. As a percentage of total expenses, feeder livestock purchases, seed, fertilizer, and crop chemicals, feed, and land rent continue to be the largest expense item. Fuel and oil expense accounted for 4 % of total expenses, up from 3 % in 2004. Average rate of return on assets (ROA) was 14 % in 2005 with assets valued at adjusted cost basis, up from 11 % the previous year. Rate of return on equity (ROE) averaged 21 %, up from 16 percent. The fact that ROE exceeded ROA indicates that debt capital earned more than its cost. Using a market value basis, average total equity (of the 91 sole proprietors) was $ 869, 127 at the end of 2005. This was an increase of $ 106, 814 during the year for these farms. The average debt-asset ratio remained constant at 42 %. The average corn yield was 191 bushels per acre, surpassing the previous years record yield of 171 bushels for association farms. Soybeans averaged 55 bushels per acre, up from 41 bushels in 2004. Results by Type of Farm The 107 farms in the report were classified as a certain type of farm (e. g., hog) on the basis of having 70 percent or more of their gross sales from that category. Using this criteria, there were 53 <b>crop</b> farms, 9 <b>hog</b> farms, 7 <b>crop</b> and <b>hog</b> farms, and 9 crop and beef farms. (There were 23 farms which did not have a single source (or pair of sources) of income over 70 %.) Hog farms were most profitable in 2005. Hog farms were also much larger in terms of gross sales than any other farm type. Crop/hog farms also averaged incomes higher than the Association average. All types of farms categorized were more profitable than the previous year. Hog farms also had the highest rate of return on assets (ROA) at 19 %. Paradoxically, hog farms were the only type of farm with average rates of return lower than the previous year. (Assets are valued at adjusted cost basis for ROA calculations.) Using assets valued on a market basis, the average farm had a debt-to-asset ratio of 42 % at the end of 2005. Crop and beef farms, at 60 %, carried much more debt as a percentage of assets than any other farm type.

40|$|Average net {{farm income}} was $ 242, 267 in 2007 for the 107 farms {{included}} in this annual report of the Southwestern Minnesota Farm Business Management Association. Average earnings increased by 57 % over the average of $ 154, 698 in 2006. In constant dollars, 2007 was the most profitable year for association members in the last 20 years (Figure 1). In fact, {{we have to go}} back to 1973 to find a more profitable year for association members. 2007 continued a steady climb in average earnings since 2001. Above average prices for corn, soybeans, and other crops more than compensated for reduced profitability of hog and beef enterprises. As in previous years, the earnings of individual farms varied greatly from the overall average. The median or middle income was $ 199, 745. Unlike most previous years, no farms experienced negative net farm incomes in 2007; 7 % had incomes under $ 50, 000 while 81 % had incomes over $ 100, 000. The high 20 % of the farms had an average net farm income of $ 518, 851, an increase of 36 % over 2006. The low 20 % of the farms had an average net farm income of $ 59, 571 in 2007, an increase of 43 % over 2006. Average gross cash farm income was $ 731, 897, a 20 % increase from 2006 (Figure 2). Three sources of sales dominated: hogs, corn, and soybeans (Figures 3 and 4). Total crop sales accounted for 44 % while livestock sales and contracting income accounted for 45 % of total cash receipts. Entire report is available at: [URL] nt payments of all types averaged $ 17, 033 in 2007, a 48 % decrease from the previous year (Figure 2). With higher crop prices, no farms reported loan deficiency (LDP) payments in their farm income in 2007, compared to $ 3, 145 in 2006 and $ 26, 519 in 2005. Government payments represented 2 % of gross cash farm income in 2007 compared to 5 % in 2006. Cash expenses increased by 20 % in 2007, the same percentage increase as cash income, to an average of $ 592, 841. As a percentage of total expenses, seed, fertilizer, and crop chemicals (17 %), feeder livestock purchases (16 %), feed (16 %), and land rent (10 %) continue to be the largest expense items (Figures 5 and 6). Fuel and oil expense accounted for 4 % of total expenses, unchanged from 2006. Average rate of return on assets (ROA) was 17 % in 2007 with assets valued at adjusted cost or book value, up from 13 % the previous year (Figure 7). Rate of return on equity (ROE) averaged 25 %, up from 19 percent. The fact that ROE exceeded ROA indicates that debt capital earned more than its cost. Using the market value of assets, average total equity (of the 91 sole proprietors) was $ 1, 224, 181 at the end of 2007 (Figure 8), an increase of $ 252, 175 from the beginning of the year for these farms. The average debt-to-asset ratio improved slightly to 40 %. The average corn yield was 162 bushels per acre, down from 169 bushels in 2006. Soybeans averaged 49 bushels per acre, down from 51 bushels in 2006 (Figure 9). Results by Type of Farm The 107 farms in the report were classified as a certain type of farm (e. g., hog) on the basis of having 70 percent or more of their gross sales from that category. Using this criteria, there were 63 <b>crop</b> farms, 5 <b>hog</b> farms, 7 <b>crop</b> and <b>hog</b> farms, and 8 crop and beef farms. (There were 18 farms which did not have a single source (or pair of sources) of income over 70 %.) Based on Net Farm Income, only Crop Farms and Crop and Beef Farms were more profitable than in 2006. Specialized Hog Farms were again the most profitable (Figure 10) based on absolute income levels but it must be recognized that the Hog Farms were much larger in terms of gross sales than any other farm type. In fact, the average Hog Farm's gross sales were five times the association average. Crop and Beef Farms had the highest rate of return on assets (ROA) at 21 %, followed closely by Crop Farms at 20 % (Figure 11). Hog Farms, while they had the highest absolute profit levels, had the lowest ROA at 9 %. (Assets are valued at adjusted cost basis for ROA calculations.) Using assets valued at estimated market value and including deferred liabilities (estimated taxes if liquidated), the average farm had a debt-to-asset ratio of 40 % at the end of 2007. Crop and Beef Farms, at 49 %, carried more debt as a percentage of assets than any other farm type (Figure 12).

40|$|Average net {{farm income}} was $ 98, 362 in 2004 for the 125 farms {{included}} in this annual report of the Southwestern Minnesota Farm Business Management Association. This is a 2 % increase over the average income of $ 96, 404 in 2003. In constant dollars, 2004 was the third most profitable year for association members in the past 20. Higher crop prices, outstanding corn yields, and high profits for hog operations were factors that combined to make 2004 a very profitable year for the average association farm. As in previous years, the actual profit levels experienced by individual farms vary greatly from the overall average profit. When the net farm incomes for the 125 farms in the report are ranked from lowest to highest, the resulting graph shows how much the incomes do vary. Ten percent of the farms experienced negative net farm incomes in 2004; 30 % had incomes over $ 100, 000. The median or middle income was $ 62, 262. The high 20 % of the farms had an average net farm income of $ 294, 683, which is a 17 % increase from 2003. The low 20 % of the farms had an average loss of $- 2, 068 in 2004. Average gross cash farm income was $ 496, 771, a 1 % decrease from 2003. Three sources of sales dominated: corn, soybeans, and hogs. Beef finishing was less of a contributor than in previous years. Total crop sales accounted for 39 % while livestock sales and contracting income accounted for 46 % of total cash receipts. Government payments of all types averaged $ 27, 798 in 2004, a 7. 5 % increase from the previous year. The average farm received $ 8, 966 in LDP payments in 2004 due to low crop prices at harvest. No LDP payments were included in 2003 income. This increase offset a $ 5, 523 decrease in direct government payments. Government payments for the average farm were $ 25, 855 in 2003, $ 15, 927 in 2002, $ 48, 208 in 2001, and $ 50, 567 in 2000. As a percentage of total income, government payments were 6 % in 2004 compared to 5 % in 2003, 4 % in 2002, 11 % in 2001, and 12 % in 2000. Cash expenses increased 1 % {{to an average of}} $ 404, 743 in 2004. As a percentage of total expenses, feeder livestock purchases, feed, seed, fertilizer, and crop chemicals, and land rent continue to be the largest expense items. Average rate of return on assets (ROA) was 11 % in 2004 with assets valued at cost basis, unchanged from the previous year (Figure 7). Rate of return on equity (ROE) averaged 16 %, also unchanged. The fact that ROE exceeded ROA indicates that debt capital earned more than its cost. Using a market value basis, average total equity (of the 109 sole proprietors) was $ 731, 813 at the end of 2004. This was an increase of $ 74, 038 during the year for these farms. Average net worth was slightly lower than 2003, likely due to a change in the size and composition of the farms in this year's summary (Figure 8). The average debt-asset ratio decreased from 44 % {{at the beginning of the}} year to 43 % at the end of 2004. The average corn yield was 171 bushels per acre, the highest average yield on record for association farms. Soybeans averaged 41 bushels per acre, slightly higher than 2003 yields. Results by Type of Farm The 125 farms in the report were classified as a certain type of farm (e. g., hog) on the basis of having 70 percent or more of their gross sales from that category.

40|$|Average net {{farm income}} was $ 96, 404 in 2003 for the 175 farms {{included}} in this annual report of the Southwestern Minnesota Farm Business Management Association. This is a 38 % increase over the average income of $ 70, 007 in 2002. In constant dollars, 2003 was the most profitable year for association members in the past 16 years. As in previous years, the actual profit levels experienced by individual farms vary greatly from the overall average profit. When the net farm incomes for the 175 farms in the report are ranked from lowest to highest, the resulting graph shows how much the incomes do vary. Seven percent of the farms experienced negative net farm income in 2003; 39 % had incomes over $ 100, 000. The median or middle income was $ 77, 187. The high 20 % of the farms had an average net farm income of $ 252, 978, which is a 39 % increase from 2002. The low 20 % of the farms had an average loss of $- 6, 804 in 2003. Average gross cash farm income was $ 504, 022, an 18 % increase from 2002. Four sources of sales again dominated: corn, soybeans, beef finishing and hogs. Corn and soybean sales accounted for over $ 200, 000 (or 41 %) of sales. Total crop sales accounted for 42 % while livestock sales and contracting income accounted for 43 % of total cash receipts. Every major category of income increased over 2002 sales levels. Corn and soybean income increased by 11 % and 19 %, respectively, while hog income was up 21 % and beef finishing income increased 15 %. Government payments of all types averaged $ 25, 855 in 2003, a 62 % increase from the previous year. Government payments increased primarily due to the timing of receipts and not because of increased program benefits. Many members also accepted a counter-cyclical payment (CCP) for corn for the 2003 crop. In all likelihood, however, that CCP payment {{will have to be}} repaid in 2004 because of price rallies in the corn market since the fall of 2003. Government payments for the average farm were $ 15, 927 in 2002, $ 48, 208 in 2001, $ 50, 567 in 2000, $ 44, 674 in 1999, $ 30, 021 in 1998, and $ 12, 257 in 1997. As a percentage of total income, government payments were 5 % in 2003, compared to 4 % in 2002, 11 % in 2001, 12 % in 2000, 11 % in 1999, 8 % in 1998, and 3 % in 1997. Cash expenses increased 14 % to an average of $ 400, 605 in 2003. As a percentage of total expenses, feeder livestock purchases, feed, seed, fertilizer, and crop chemicals, and land rent continue to be the largest expense items. Both the average rate of return on assets (ROA) and the rate of return to equity (ROE) increased in 2003 for the second consecutive year. In 2003 ROA averaged 11 % and ROE was 16 % using assets valued on a cost basis. The fact that ROE exceeded ROA indicates that debt capital was earning more than its cost. Using a market value basis, average total equity (of the 149 sole proprietors) was $ 788, 640 at the end of 2003. This was an increase of $ 99, 883 during the year for these farms. Average equity has continued to improve since 1986. The average debt-asset ratio decreased from 46 % {{at the beginning of the}} year to 44 % at the end of 2003. The average corn yield was 157 bushels per acre; soybeans averaged 39 bushels per acre. Corn yields were higher but soybean yields lower than 2002 yields. Results by Type of Farm The 175 farms in the report were classified as a certain type of farm (e. g., hog) on the basis of having 70 percent or more of their gross sales from that category. Using this 70 percent rule in 2003, there were 96 <b>crop</b> farms, 10 <b>hog</b> farms, 15 <b>crop</b> and <b>hog</b> farms, 9 beef farms, and 5 crop and beef farms. (There were 33 farms which did not have a single source (or pair of sources) of income over 70 %.) For the second straight year, the beef farms were the most profitable in 2003, after experiencing very low returns in 2001. Crop/beef farms also averaged incomes higher than the Association average. No type of farm experienced a loss, on average, in 2003. Beef farms, along with crop/beef farms, also had the highest rate of return on assets. (Assets are valued on a cost-basis for ROA calculations). Using assets valued on a market basis, the average crop farm has a debt-to-asset ratio of 41 % at the end of 2003.
