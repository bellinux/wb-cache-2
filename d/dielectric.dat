5|$|Because of its {{excellent}} thermal {{and chemical}} stability, boron nitride ceramics are traditionally used {{as parts of}} high-temperature equipment. h-BN can be included in ceramics, alloys, resins, plastics, rubbers, and other materials, giving them self-lubricating properties. Such materials are suitable for construction of e.g. bearings and in steelmaking. Plastics filled with BN have less thermal expansion as well as higher thermal conductivity and electrical resistivity. Due to its excellent <b>dielectric</b> and thermal properties, BN is used in electronics e.g. as a substrate for semiconductors, microwave-transparent windows and as a structural material for seals. It {{can also be used}} as <b>dielectric</b> in resistive random access memories.|$|E
5|$|<b>Dielectric</b> barrier {{discharge}} (DBD): {{this is a}} non-thermal discharge {{generated by}} the application of high voltages across small gaps wherein a non-conducting coating prevents the transition of the plasma discharge into an arc. It is often mislabeled 'Corona' discharge in industry and has similar application to corona discharges. It is also widely used in the web treatment of fabrics. The application of the discharge to synthetic fabrics and plastics functionalizes the surface and allows for paints, glues and similar materials to adhere. The <b>dielectric</b> barrier discharge {{was used in the}} mid-1990s to show that low temperature atmospheric pressure plasma is effective in inactivating bacterial cells. This work and later experiments using mammalian cells led to the establishment of a new field of research known as plasma medicine. The <b>dielectric</b> barrier discharge configuration was also used in the design of low temperature plasma jets. These plasma jets are produced by fast propagating guided ionization waves known as plasma bullets.|$|E
5|$|It {{has a high}} <b>dielectric</b> {{constant}} (relative permittivity), {{making it}} a good solvent for ionic species.|$|E
5|$|These SiNH {{films have}} much less tensile stress, but worse {{electrical}} properties (resistivity 106 to 1015Ω·cm, and <b>dielectric</b> strength 1 to 5MV/cm).|$|E
5|$|This {{increase}} in permeability primarily affects transport of ions and other hydrated species, {{indicating that the}} mechanism {{is the creation of}} nm-scale water-filled holes in the membrane. Although electroporation and <b>dielectric</b> breakdown both result from application of an electric field, the mechanisms involved are fundamentally different. In <b>dielectric</b> breakdown the barrier material is ionized, creating a conductive pathway. The material alteration is thus chemical in nature. In contrast, during electroporation the lipid molecules are not chemically altered but simply shift position, opening up a pore that acts as the conductive pathway through the bilayer as it is filled with water.|$|E
25|$|The {{insulator}} in a MOSFET is a <b>dielectric</b> {{which can}} {{in any event}} be silicon oxide, but many other <b>dielectric</b> materials are employed. The generic term for the <b>dielectric</b> is gate <b>dielectric</b> since the <b>dielectric</b> lies directly below the gate electrode and above the channel of the MOSFET.|$|E
25|$|A <b>dielectric</b> {{waveguide}} {{employs a}} solid <b>dielectric</b> rod {{rather than a}} hollow pipe. An optical fibre is a <b>dielectric</b> guide designed to work at optical frequencies. Transmission lines such as microstrip, coplanar waveguide, stripline or coaxial cable may also {{be considered to be}} waveguides.|$|E
25|$|Therefore, <b>dielectric</b> {{thickness}} {{does not}} affect energy density within a capacitor of fixed overall dimensions. Using a few thick layers of <b>dielectric</b> can support a high voltage, but low capacitance, while thin layers of <b>dielectric</b> produce a low breakdown voltage, but a higher capacitance.|$|E
25|$|The {{equivalent}} {{series resistance}} (ESR) summarizes all resistive losses of the capacitor. These are the supply line resistances, the contact resistance of the electrode contact, the line resistance of the electrodes and the <b>dielectric</b> losses in the <b>dielectric</b> film. The largest share of these losses is usually the dissipative losses in the <b>dielectric.</b>|$|E
25|$|A thinner <b>dielectric</b> or {{a larger}} {{electrode}} area each increase the capacitance value, as will a <b>dielectric</b> material of higher permittivity.|$|E
25|$|The {{maximum energy}} {{that can be}} stored safely in a {{capacitor}} {{is limited by the}} breakdown voltage. Due to the scaling of capacitance and breakdown voltage with <b>dielectric</b> thickness, all capacitors made with a particular <b>dielectric</b> have approximately equal maximum energy density, {{to the extent that the}} <b>dielectric</b> dominates their volume.|$|E
25|$|Therefore, the <b>dielectric</b> {{constant}} (and the conductivity) has {{contributions from}} both terms. This {{approach can be}} generalized to compute the frequency dependent <b>dielectric</b> function.|$|E
25|$|PTFE, ceramic filled - expensive, low <b>dielectric</b> loss, {{for high}} {{frequency}} applications. Varying ceramics/PTFE ratio allows adjusting <b>dielectric</b> constant and thermal expansion.|$|E
25|$|The {{electromagnetic}} waves in a (metal-pipe) waveguide may be imagined as travelling down the guide in a zig-zag path, being repeatedly reflected between opposite {{walls of the}} guide. For the particular case of rectangular waveguide, {{it is possible to}} base an exact analysis on this view. Propagation in a <b>dielectric</b> waveguide may be viewed in the same way, with the waves confined to the <b>dielectric</b> by total internal reflection at its surface. Some structures, such as non-radiative <b>dielectric</b> waveguides and the Goubau line, use both metal walls and <b>dielectric</b> surfaces to confine the wave.|$|E
25|$|According to the equation, a thinner <b>dielectric</b> or {{a larger}} {{electrode}} area both {{will increase the}} capacitance value, as will a <b>dielectric</b> material of higher permittivity.|$|E
25|$|Because the {{thickness}} of the effective <b>dielectric</b> is proportional to the forming voltage, the <b>dielectric</b> thickness can be tailored to the rated voltage of the capacitor. For example, for low voltage types a 10V electrolytic capacitor has a <b>dielectric</b> thickness of only about 0.014µm, a 100V electrolytic capacitor of only about 0.14µm. Thus, the <b>dielectric</b> strength also influences the size of the capacitor. However, due to standardized safety margins the actual forming voltage of electrolytic capacitors is higher than the rated voltage of the component.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dielectric</b> {{absorption}} is {{a property}} {{which has been}} long known. Its value {{can be measured in}} accordance with the IEC/EN 60384-1 standard. The capacitor shall be charged at the DC voltage rating for 60 minutes. Then the capacitor shall be disconnected from the power source and shall be discharged for 10s. The voltage regained on the capacitor terminals (recovery voltage) within 15 minutes is the <b>dielectric</b> absorption voltage. The size of the <b>dielectric</b> absorption voltage is specified in relation to the applied voltage in percent and depends on the <b>dielectric</b> material used. It is specified by many manufacturers in the data sheets.|$|E
25|$|The {{separation}} of the electrodes and the voltage proof of the <b>dielectric</b> material defines the breakdown voltage of the capacitor. The breakdown voltage {{is proportional to the}} thickness of the <b>dielectric.</b>|$|E
25|$|Assigning the {{appropriate}} values for <b>dielectric</b> permittivity of the protein, membrane, and aqueous regions {{is of great}} importance. The <b>dielectric</b> coefficient determines {{the strength of the}} interactions between charged particles and also the <b>dielectric</b> boundary forces (DBF) on ions approaching a boundary between two regions of different permittivity. However, in nano scales the task of assigning specific permittivity is problematic and not straightforward.|$|E
25|$|Avalanche {{breakdown}} {{within a}} <b>dielectric</b> material. A free electron becomes sufficiently accelerated by an externally applied electrical field that it frees up additional electrons as it collides with atoms or molecules of the <b>dielectric</b> media. These secondary electrons also are accelerated, creating {{larger numbers of}} free electrons. The resulting exponential growth of electrons and ions may rapidly lead to complete <b>dielectric</b> breakdown of the material.|$|E
25|$|Solvents can be broadly {{classified}} into two categories: polar and non-polar. A special case is mercury, whose solutions {{are known as}} amalgams; also, other metal solutions exist which are liquid at room temperature. Generally, the <b>dielectric</b> constant of the solvent provides a rough measure of a solvent's polarity. The strong polarity of water is indicated by its high <b>dielectric</b> constant of 88 (at 0°C). Solvents with a <b>dielectric</b> constant of less than 15 are {{generally considered to be}} nonpolar. The <b>dielectric</b> constant measures the solvent's tendency to partly cancel the field strength of the electric field of a charged particle immersed in it. This reduction is then compared to the field strength of the charged particle in a vacuum. Heuristically, the <b>dielectric</b> constant of a solvent {{can be thought of as}} its ability to reduce the solute's effective internal charge. Generally, the <b>dielectric</b> constant of a solvent is an acceptable predictor of the solvent's ability to dissolve common ionic compounds, such as salts.|$|E
25|$|The <b>dielectric</b> {{thickness}} of electrolytic capacitors is very slight, {{in the range}} of nanometers per volt. On the other hand, the voltage strengths of these oxide layers are quite high. With this very thin <b>dielectric</b> oxide layer combined with a sufficient high <b>dielectric</b> strength the electrolytic capacitors can already achieve a high volumetric capacitance. This is one reason for the high capacitance values of electrolytic capacitors compared to conventional capacitors.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} varying the {{characteristics}} of the <b>dielectric</b> can be used for sensing purposes. Capacitors with an exposed and porous <b>dielectric</b> can be used to measure humidity in air. Capacitors are used to accurately measure the fuel level in airplanes; as the fuel covers more of a pair of plates, the circuit capacitance increases. Squeezing the <b>dielectric</b> can change a capacitor at a few tens of bar pressure sufficiently that it {{can be used as a}} pressure sensor. A selected, but otherwise standard, polymer <b>dielectric</b> capacitor, when immersed in a compatible gas or liquid, can work usefully as a very low cost pressure sensor up to many hundreds of bar.|$|E
25|$|Ceramic {{capacitors}} {{are composed}} of a mixture of finely ground granules of paraelectric or ferroelectric materials, appropriately mixed with other materials to achieve the desired characteristics. From these powder mixtures, the ceramic is sintered at high temperatures. The ceramic forms the <b>dielectric</b> {{and serves as a}} carrier for the metallic electrodes. The minimum thickness of the <b>dielectric</b> layer, which today (2013) for low voltage capacitors is in the size range of 0.5 micrometers is limited downwards by the grain size of the ceramic powder. The thickness of the <b>dielectric</b> for capacitors with higher voltages is determined by the <b>dielectric</b> strength of the desired capacitor.|$|E
25|$|The {{permittivity}} of a <b>dielectric</b> {{medium is}} often {{represented by the}} ratio of its absolute permittivity to the electric constant. This dimensionless quantity is called the medium’s relative permittivity (εr) or <b>dielectric</b> constant (κ).|$|E
25|$|The {{substrates}} {{are characterized}} by several key parameters, chiefly thermomechanical (glass transition temperature, tensile strength, shear strength, thermal expansion), electrical (<b>dielectric</b> constant, loss tangent, <b>dielectric</b> breakdown voltage, leakage current, tracking resistance...), and others (e.g. moisture absorption).|$|E
25|$|The usual {{breakdown}} {{route is}} that the field strength becomes large enough to pull electrons in the <b>dielectric</b> from their atoms thus causing conduction. Other scenarios are possible, such as impurities in the <b>dielectric,</b> and, if the <b>dielectric</b> is of a crystalline nature, imperfections in the crystal structure can result in an avalanche breakdown as seen in semi-conductor devices. Breakdown voltage is also affected by pressure, humidity and temperature.|$|E
25|$|This linear <b>dielectric</b> example {{shows that}} the <b>dielectric</b> {{constant}} treatment {{is equivalent to the}} uniform dipole moment model and leads to zero charge everywhere except for the surface charge at the boundary of the sphere.|$|E
25|$|Since the <b>dielectric</b> constant, <b>dielectric</b> {{loss tangent}} value, and volume {{resistivity}} are high, the corona resistance {{is not very}} good, and it is generally suitable for medium or low voltage and low frequency insulation materials.|$|E
25|$|Ellipsometry is {{an optical}} {{technique}} for investigating the <b>dielectric</b> properties (complex refractive index or <b>dielectric</b> function) of thin films. Ellipsometry measures {{the change of}} polarization upon reflection or transmission and compares it to a model.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dielectric</b> {{absorption}} {{can cause}} a problem in circuits where very small currents are used, such as long-time-constant integrators or sample-and-hold circuits. However, in most applications where tantalum electrolytic capacitors are supporting power supply lines, <b>dielectric</b> absorption is not a problem.|$|E

25|$|In 1995 {{the minimum}} {{thickness}} of the <b>dielectric</b> was 4µm. By 2005 some manufacturers produced MLCC chips with layer thicknesses of 1µm. , the minimum thickness is about 0.5µm. The field strength in the <b>dielectric</b> increased to 35V/µm.|$|E
25|$|Electrolytic {{capacitors}} have {{a metallic}} anode covered with an oxidized layer used as <b>dielectric.</b> The second electrode is a non-solid (wet) or solid electrolyte. Electrolytic capacitors are polarized. Three families are available, categorized {{according to their}} <b>dielectric.</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>dielectric</b> {{thickness}} of electrolytic capacitors is very thin, {{in the range}} of nanometers per volt. Despite this, the <b>dielectric</b> strengths of these oxide layers are quite high. Thus, tantalum capacitors can achieve a high volumetric capacitance compared to other capacitor types.|$|E
25|$|The {{equivalent}} {{series resistance}} (ESR) summarizes all resistive losses of the capacitor. These are the terminal resistances, the contact resistance of the electrode contact, the line resistance of the electrodes, the electrolyte resistance, and the <b>dielectric</b> losses in the <b>dielectric</b> oxide layer.|$|E
