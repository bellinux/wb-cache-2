40|$|Willow Creek Dam {{is located}} in a unique region on the {{boundary}} of a confined aquifer, where artesian conditions exist. Recently, groundwater levels have exceeded the elevation of the downstream berm well above anticipated piezometric elevations. It was presumed from limited evidence that these high piezometric levels resulted from pressure in the aquifer rather than from seepage out of the reservoir. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the relative contributions of the reservoir and the regional groundwater to observed piezometric levels and how these levels affect seepage <b>exit</b> <b>gradients</b> and slope stability of the dam. Comparing the head levels in shallow and deep piezometers at the dam, the seepage is shown to originate from the regional aquifer and to flow upwards. The head in the groundwater exceeds the reservoir elevation, and the reservoir elevation has little influence on local phreatic elevations. The largest annual fluctuations in the groundwater levels result from local irrigation pumping. Influences of irrigation wells were quantified using a well influence statistic derived for this study. This statistic was found to be the best predictor of variation in groundwater elevations at the dam. Using a finite element analysis program, it was shown that the regional aquifer provides all the flow into the relief well system and solely contributes to the <b>exit</b> <b>gradients</b> long the downstream toe. Flow rates in the dam’s 27 pressure relief wells were found to be less than the flow rates when the reservoir was first filled, even though piezometer levels are much higher now. This points to a need to redevelop the pressure relief wells. Resulting higher relief well flow will decrease the piezometric levels at the dam and will result in reduced <b>exit</b> <b>gradients.</b> Local and global slope stability was not found to be in jeopardy with local seepage failure occurring well before stability failures.

Current geotechnical engineering practice consists of comparing expected <b>exit</b> <b>gradients</b> with the critical gradient of the soil at the seepage exit point. The critical gradient is generally considered as the ratio of soil buoyant unit weight and the unit weight of water, suggesting that the critical gradient only depends on the void ratio and specific gravity of the solids.

The tests are also used to observe the grain scale mechanisms of piping erosion initiation.

In reality however, this is generally not so, and the flow encounters additional resistances due to pipe slotting and clogging around the drains. The present study is intended to investigate the effect of different parameters on the characteristics of subsurface drainage of irrigated land utilizing perforated tile drainage pipes. The saturated flow towards perforated drainage pipes is investigated by means of both laboratory experiments and numerical analysis. The effect of the perforation ratio of the pipe on the entrance resistance and <b>exit</b> hydraulic <b>gradient</b> was studied. The study was performed experimentally by using the sand box model technique and numerically by using energy balance method. Three soil types having different permeabilities were used. The perforation ratio of the drainage pipe was changed to take 3. 3 %, 4. 96 % and 6. 62 %. Two cases of water level were chosen. The results indicated that, the perforation ratio affects not only the seepage discharge but also the water table elevation for the flow towards the pipe. Increasing the perforation ratio of drainage pipe causes an increasing of the seepage flow towards the drain. It was found also, that the coefficient of entrance resistance decreases with the increase of both the perforation ratio and the mean diameter of soils.

40|$|Earthen dams are {{constructed}} to store {{water for the}} purposes of human consumption, food production, electricity production, industrial use and flood protection. Failure of Earthen dams may be due to hydraulic failure, structural failure or seepage failure. Hydraulic failure may be due to overtopping, erosion of the upstream/downstream surface/toe and piping. Structural failures can occur in either the embankment or the appurtenances. Failure of a spillway, lake drain, or other appurtenance may lead to failure of the embankment. Cracking, settlement, and slides are the more common signs of structural failure of embankments. Seepage Failure occurs due to the uncontrolled seepage in both velocity and quantity. Water permeating slowly through the dam and progressively erode the soil in the embankment or the foundation toward the reservoir.

40|$|The {{ministry}} of land, infrastructures, transportation and tourism (MLIT) of the Japanese government maintains governmental managed river levee {{for the safety}} against flood whose total length is more than 10, 000 km. The design standard of river levee had been traditionally done based on so called shape based specification, where levee is judged to be safe {{as long as a}} section satisfies the specified dimensions. In 2002, this policy had been changed and a new inspection guideline which is based on the modern soil mechanics principles had been introduced. The method mainly consists of the non-stationary seepage analysis followed by the circular slip line stability analysis. The <b>exit</b> <b>gradient</b> and uplift pressure are also checked based on specified safety factors. The way of the safety assessment is that, first a river is divided into so called a continuous strip (CS) which is judged to have similar configurations, geotechnical and hydraulic conditions. The typical length of a CS is half to several km long. Then a representative cross section (RCS) that is considered to represent all the CS section is selected. At RCS, detailed soil investigations are carried out, and the inspection is done to assess the safety of the section for stability and piping. A CS is judged to be safe if all the verification items satisfy the specified safety factor, but judged to be NG (no good) if any of the items could not fulfill the threshold value. The first round assessment at year 2011 indicated, only 60 % of the all levee is judged to be safe for all verification items. 25 % of the levee could not satisfy the stability requirement, 30 % piping requirement, and 14 % the both requirements.

40|$|A {{new method}} for {{assessing}} the potential for unsatisfactory levee performance due to underseepage is presented. Specifically, the method assesses {{the potential for the}} initiation of piping (the internal backward erosion of the foundation or embankment caused by seepage). Current assessment methods consist of deterministic seepage analyses and simplified reliability methods. Deterministic methods produce either a maximum hydraulic <b>exit</b> <b>gradient</b> or a Factor of Safety against piping but they do not account for high levels of uncertainty in soil properties and subsurface geometry that are inherent to many levee analyses. The most common simplified reliability approaches that are currently being used to analyze levees with regard to underseepage apply the First Order Second Moment (FOSM) Taylor Series method using the US Army Corps of Engineers 2 ̆ 2 Blanket Theory 2 ̆ 2 equation as the performance function. These methods take into account the uncertainty of the soil properties but are limited to simplified subsurface geometries and often do not model the actual mechanism responsible for levee failure due to underseepage piping. The proposed new method uses a Monte Carlo simulation to calculate the probability of unsatisfactory levee profile performance and can take into account complexities in subsurface geometry that cannot be assessed using the simplified reliability methods. The relationships between uncertainty of the soil parameters, the subsurface geometry, and the Factor of Safety against piping are defined through parametric variation analyses of a finite-element seepage model. The results of the parametric analyses are used to develop a series of equations that define the relationship between the various input parameters and the factor of safety. Using these equations, probability density functions for the various input parameters, and the computer program @Risk which interfaces with Excel, a Monte Carlo analysis is performed to calculate the probability of unsatisfactory performance which represents the probability of initiating erosion given a river flood level. The results of the analysis represent a single node of the event tree. In order to assess failure potential, other points in the event tree will need to be assessed with calculations or judgment since it is only the first phase that is currently considered to be in the process of piping. The new method is demonstrated using actual data of levee profiles from the Natomas Basin in Sacramento, California as a case study. The case study highlights the benefits of reliability-based analyses over the Factor of Safety and demonstrates the importance of subsurface geometry in reliability calculations...|$|E
40|$|Based on the LAMOST {{survey and}} Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we use low-resolution spectra of 130, 043 F/G-type dwarf stars {{to study the}} {{kinematics}} and metallicity properties of the Galactic disk. Our study shows that the stars with poorer metallicity and larger vertical distance from Galactic plane tend to have larger eccentricity and velocity dispersion. After separating the sample stars into likely thin-disk and thick-disk sub-sample, we find that there <b>exits</b> a negative <b>gradient</b> of rotation velocity V_ϕ with metallicity [Fe/H] for the likely thin-disk sub-sample, and the thick-disk sub-sample exhibit a larger positive gradient of rotation velocity with metallicity. By comparing with model prediction, we consider the radial migration of stars appears to have influenced on the thin-disk formation. In addition, {{our results shows that}} the observed thick-disk stellar orbital eccentricity distribution peaks at low eccentricity (e ∼ 0. 2) and extends to a high eccentricity (e ∼ 0. 8). We compare this result with four thick-disk formation simulated models, and it imply that our result is consistent with gas-rich merger model.

40|$|Reverse {{electrodialysis}} {{is a novel}} {{technology that}} exploits a salinity gradient to generate electrical energy. The salinity gradient can be available from natural waters such as seawater and river water or they can be artificially generated and used within closed-loop applications. This last option has been recently investigated leading {{to the development of}} the RED heat engine concept. In this case, the deployed salinity <b>gradient</b> <b>exiting</b> the RED unit is regenerated in a thermally-driven unit using low-temperature heat, thus being able to convert heat to power within an integrated system. Among the different regeneration alternatives, the use of thermolytic salts has been presented as a promising option, due to the possible use of very-low grade heat (40 - 60 °C) to regenerate the solutions by means of degradation/stripping/re-absorption processes. In the present work, different regeneration strategies for ammonium bi-carbonate aqueous solutions have been investigated by means of process simulation (Aspen Plus) and experimental tests. Simulations have been performed looking at two different regeneration methods: i) stripping with air and ii) distillation (in practice, also a stripping process, but with vapour). A sensitivity analysis has been performed to study the effect of different operating variables (streams’ temperature, pressure, flow rate, inlet concentration) on the regeneration performance. The experimental campaign has been carried out mainly on the air stripping concept, which did turn to be the most promising within the expected range of operating conditions. Experiments were also aimed at identifying the main dependences (e. g. the effect of different packing materials and operating conditions on the performance indicators), technological limitations and relevant solutions. Eventually, a comparison between experimental information and model predictions has been performed in order to highlight the main discrepancies and validate model prediction capabilities...|$|R
40|$|The {{most common}} and costly {{unexpected}} post-development gas turbine engine reliability issue is blade failure due to High Cycle Fatigue (HCF). HCF in centrifugal compressors is a coupled nonlinear fluid-structure problem for which understanding of the phenomenological root causes is incomplete. The complex physics of this problem provides significant challenges for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) techniques. Furthermore, the available literature fails to address the flow field associated with the diffuser potential field, a primary cause of forced impeller vibration. Because of the serious nature of HCF, the inadequacy of current design approaches to predict HCF, and the fundamental lack of benchmark experiments to advance the design practices, there exists a {{need to build a}} database of information specific {{to the nature of the}} diffuser generated forcing function as a foundation for understanding flow induced blade vibratory failure. ^ The specific aim of this research is to address the fundamental nature of the unsteady aerodynamic interaction phenomena inherent in high-speed centrifugal compressors wherein the impeller exit flow field is dynamically modulated by the vaned diffuser potential field or shock structure. The understanding of this unsteady aerodynamic interaction is fundamental to characterizing the impeller forcing function. ^ Unsteady static pressure measurement at several radial and circumferential locations in the vaneless space offer a depiction of pressure field radial decay, circumferential variation and temporal fluctuation. These pressure measurements are coupled with high density, full field measurement of the velocity field within the diffuser vaneless space at multiple spanwise positions. ^ The velocity field and unsteady pressure field are shown to be intimately linked. A strong momentum <b>gradient</b> <b>exiting</b> the impeller is shown to extend well across the vaneless space and interact with the diffuser vane leading edge. The deterministic unsteady pressure field is found to be dominated by the blade-vane interaction. HCF concerns are illuminated by persistent pressure waves extending radially across the vaneless space and impacting the impeller pressure surface. Finally, the average impeller exit flow field is found to present a highly unsteady velocity field to the downstream vane row, challenging the common design assumption of a rapid mixing model for diffuser design. ...|$|R
