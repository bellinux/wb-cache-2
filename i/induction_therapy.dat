5|$|First-line {{treatment}} of AML consists primarily of chemotherapy, and {{is divided into}} two phases: induction and postremission (or consolidation) therapy. The goal of <b>induction</b> <b>therapy</b> is to achieve a complete remission by reducing the number of leukemic cells to an undetectable level; the goal of consolidation therapy is to eliminate any residual undetectable disease and achieve a cure. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is usually considered if induction chemotherapy fails or after a person relapses, although transplantation is also sometimes used as front-line therapy for people with high-risk disease.

40|$|Despite {{advances}} in treatment, cancer remains the 2 nd {{most common cause}} of death in the United States. Poor cure rates may result from the ability of cancer to recur and spread after initial therapies have seemingly eliminated detectable signs of disease.

Thus, targeting CSCs in combination with traditional <b>induction</b> <b>therapies</b> may improve treatment outcomes and survival rates. Unfortunately, CSCs tend to be resistant to chemo- and radiation therapy, and {{a better understanding of the}} mechanisms underlying CSC resistance to treatment is necessary.

40|$|Arsenic {{trioxide}} {{is becoming}} a common treatment for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Connie Zanzig Augustyniak, RN, BSN, described the role of arsenic trioxide {{in the treatment of}} APL, noting that it has had success in inducing remissions in relapsed and refractory patients. Augustyniak also discussed the use of arsenic trioxide in APL front-line therapy along with all-transretinoic acid (ATRA) differentiation with an anthracycline and AraC. Healthcare professionals “are not waiting for patients to relapse before they are exposed to arsenic, ” Augustyniak said, adding that arsenic allows early intervention at a molecular relapse level.

Using flow cytometry, we investigated NK and NKT cells and their functional markers, NKp 30, NKp 44, NKp 46, CD 16 and CXCR 3. Both cell populations were influenced by transplantation. Results were independent of the origin of the graft (cadaveric or living donor) and of the immunosuppressive protocol used.

40|$|Pancreas Transplantation aims at {{providing}} Beta cells replacement in diabetic patients, {{especially for}} {{type 1 diabetes}} recipients in whom Beta cells had been destroyed by an autoimmune process. The final achievement is to restore a normal physiological control of glucose metabolism in order to halt or reverse the secondary complications of diabetes i. e. retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy, micro – and macro - angiopathy [1]. That {{can be achieved by}} a vascularised pancreas graft (referred as Pancreas Transplantation, PT) or by islet grafting (referred as Islet Transplantation, IT). The former PT includes transplanting 95 % of unuseful cells, the exocrine part from one pancreas, while the last one IP, embolizing into the recipient liver, Islets of Langerhans after digestion and purification of several human pancreases. Three types of PT can be performed: the pancreas and a kidney are simultaneously transplanted with a single induction of immunosuppression (IS) therapy in hoping to correct both uremia and diabetes mellitus (SPK = Simultaneous Pancreas and Kidney Transplantation); the pancreas is transplanted after a successful kidney graft allowing two <b>induction</b> <b>therapies</b> along with the basic IS treatment (PAK = Pancreas After Kidney Transplantation); and finally the Pancreas can be transplanted alone in pre-uremic recipients with unawareness hypoglycaemic events or with rapidly evolving secondary complications of diabetes such as proliferative retinopathy, or advanced neuropathy (PTA = Pancreas Transplantation Alone) [1]. Moreover, in SPK, both organs the Pancreas and the Kidney are procured from the same deceased donor, either donor after brain death (DBD) or donor after cardiac death (DCD). In some US institutions, a segmental pancreas and the left kidney, are procured in a living donor [2], using a laparoscopic approach in the more recent year [3]. For PAK, in order to avoid an excessive IS load and two <b>induction</b> <b>therapies,</b> other institutions had proposed whenever possible to keep in stand-by the potential live kidney donor until a cadaver whole pancreatic compatible graft is available [1]. By contrast, the number of PTA remains limited in non uremic recipients with life-threatening complications of diabetes, in whom one might hope to avoid the hypoglycaemic events with a successful graft. That can also be achieved with IT. But except for rare cases, insulin independence with IT requires more than a single human pancreas and is limited over time [1]. Moreover, IT needs costly materials, chambers and rooms for preparation. That’s why IT will not be included in the present report. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe are {{presenting}} {{a case of}} an adult male patient with monocytic acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who had on presentation brain infarction and bilobed nuclei had been demonstrated {{in many of the}} leukemic blasts.

50|$|Short Course Immune <b>Induction</b> <b>Therapy</b> or SCIIT, is a {{therapeutic}} strategy employing rapid, specific, short term-modulation {{of the immune}} system using {{a therapeutic}} agent to induce T-cell non-responsiveness, also known as operational tolerance. As an alternative strategy to immunosuppression and antigen-specific tolerance inducing therapies, the primary goal of SCIIT is to re-establish or induce peripheral immune tolerance in the context of autoimmune disease and transplant rejection through the use of biological agents (compare also tolerogenic therapy). In recent years, SCIIT has received increasing attention in clinical and research settings as an alternative to immunosuppressive drugs currently used in the clinic, drugs which put the patients at risk of developing infection, cancer, and cardiovascular disease.|$|E

50|$|Treatment {{decisions}} often follow {{formal or}} informal algorithmic guidelines. Treatment options {{can often be}} ranked or prioritized into lines of therapy: first-line therapy, second-line therapy, third-line therapy, and so on. First-line therapy (sometimes called <b>induction</b> <b>therapy,</b> primary therapy, or front-line therapy) is the first therapy that will be tried. Its priority over other options is usually either: (1) formally recommended {{on the basis of}} clinical trial evidence for its best-available combination of efficacy, safety, and tolerability or (2) chosen based on the clinical experience of the physician. If a first-line therapy either fails to resolve the issue or produces intolerable side effects, additional (second-line) therapies may be substituted or added to the treatment regimen, followed by third-line therapies, and so on.|$|E
40|$|Minimization or {{withdrawal}} of immunosuppressive treatments after organ transplantation represents a major objective for improving {{quality of life}} and long-term survival of grafted patients. Such a goal may be reached under some clinical conditions, particularly in liver transplantation, making these patients good candidates for tolerance trials. In this context in liver transplantation, the central questions are (1) how to promote the natural propensity of the liver graft to be accepted, (2) which type of immunosuppressive drug should be used for induction and maintenance, and (3) which biomarkers could be used to discriminate tolerant patients from those requiring long-term immunosuppression. <b>Induction</b> <b>therapies</b> using aggressive T-cell-depleting agents may favor graft acceptance. However, persistent and/or rapidly reemerging cell lines, such as memory-type cells or CD 8 (+) T cells, could represent a significant barrier for induction of tolerance. The type of maintenance drugs also remains questionable. Calcineurin inhibitors may be eventually deleterious in the context of tolerance protocols, through inhibitory effects on regulatory T cells, that are not observed with rapamycin. In conclusion, significant efforts must be made to achieve reliable strategies for immunosuppression minimization or withdrawal after organ transplantation into the clinics.
