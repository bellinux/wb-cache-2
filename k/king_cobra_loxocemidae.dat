The jaw bones are connected by pliable ligaments, enabling the lower jaw bones to move independently. This allows the <b>king</b> <b>cobra</b> to swallow its prey whole, and swallow prey {{much larger than}} its head.|$|R

5000|$|The hiss of the <b>king</b> <b>cobra</b> is a {{much lower}} pitch than many other snakes and many people thus liken its call to a [...] "growl" [...] rather than a hiss. While the hisses of most snakes are of a broad-frequency span ranging from roughly 3,000 to 13,000 Hz with a {{dominant}} frequency near 7,500 Hz, <b>king</b> <b>cobra</b> growls consist solely of frequencies below 2,500 Hz, with a dominant frequency near 600 Hz, a much lower-sounding frequency closer {{to that of a}} human voice. Comparative anatomical morphometric analysis has led to a discovery of tracheal diverticula that function as low-frequency resonating chambers in <b>king</b> <b>cobra</b> and its prey, the rat snake, both of which can make similar growls.|$|R

5000|$|This {{species is}} capable of {{delivering}} a fatal bite and the victim may receive a large quantity of venom with a dose of 200 to 500 mg [...] or even up to 7 ml. Engelmann and Obst (1981) list the average venom yield at 420 mg (dry weight). Accordingly, large quantities of antivenom {{may be needed to}} reverse the progression of symptoms developed if bitten by a <b>king</b> <b>cobra.</b> The toxins affect the victim's central nervous system, resulting in severe pain, blurred vision, vertigo, drowsiness, and eventually paralysis. If the envenomation is serious, it progresses to cardiovascular collapse, and the victim falls into a coma. Death soon follows due to respiratory failure. Moreover, envenomation from <b>king</b> <b>cobras</b> is clinically known to cause renal failure as observed from some snakebite precedents of this species though it is uncommon. Bites from a <b>king</b> <b>cobra</b> may result in a rapid fatality which can be as early as 30 minutes after the envenomation. The <b>king</b> <b>cobra's</b> envenomation was even recorded to be capable of killing elephants within hours.|$|R

40|$|Three {{patients}} {{bitten by}} the world's largest species of venomous snake, the <b>king</b> <b>cobra</b> (Ophiophagus hannah), {{were observed in}} Myanmar (Burma). All three {{were involved in the}} famous snake dance in Yangon (Rangoon) Zoological Gardens. One patient showed no signs of envenoming despite a sustained bite, another developed only signs of local envenoming, but in a third there was severe neurotoxic envenoming requiring mechanical ventilation for 64 1 / 2 hours, episodes of hypotension and massive swelling of the bitten limb. This patient showed some signs of recovery before delayed treatment with specific antivenom. It is possible that all three patients had some immunity to <b>king</b> <b>cobra</b> venom resulting from traditional 'immunization' achieved by scratching venom into the skin. The literature on <b>king</b> <b>cobra</b> bites is reviewed and recommendations given for antivenom and ancillary treatments...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>king</b> <b>cobra's</b> generic name, Ophiophagus is a Greek-derived {{word that}} means [...] "snake-eater", and its diet {{consists}} primarily of other snakes, including rat snakes, small pythons, and even other venomous snakes such as {{various members of}} the true cobras (of the genus Naja), and the krait. When food is scarce, they may also feed on other small vertebrates, such as lizards, birds, and rodents. In some cases, the cobra may [...] "constrict" [...] its prey, such as birds and larger rodents, using its muscular body, though this is uncommon. After a large meal, the snake may live for many months without another one because of its slow metabolic rate. The <b>king</b> <b>cobra's</b> most common meal is the rat snake; pursuit of this species often brings <b>king</b> <b>cobras</b> close to human settlements.|$|R

5000|$|Snakebites {{from this}} species are rare, and most victims are snake handlers. Not all <b>king</b> <b>cobra</b> bites result in envenomation, {{but they are}} often {{considered}} of medical importance. Clinical mortality rates vary between different regions and depend on many factors, such as local medical advancement. A Thai survey reports 10 deaths out of 35 patients received for <b>king</b> <b>cobra</b> bites, whose fatality rate posed (28%) is {{higher than those of}} other cobra species. A six-year reviewing report published by South Indian Hospital revealed that two-thirds of the patients bitten by <b>king</b> <b>cobras</b> were graded [...] "severe", though none died at the end due to proper medical treatments. Department of Clinical Toxinology in University of Adelaide gives this serpent a general untreated fatality rate of 50-60%, implying that the snake has about a half chance to deliver bites involving nonfatal quantities of venom.|$|R

40|$|Some {{constituents}} of snake venom {{have been found}} to display a variety of biological activities. The antibacterial property of snake venom, in particular, has gathered increasing scientific interest due to antibiotic resistance. In the present study, <b>king</b> <b>cobra</b> venom was screened against three strains of Staphylococcus aureus [including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) ], three other species of gram-positive bacteria and six gram-negative bacteria. King cobra venom was active against all the 12 bacteria tested, and was most effective against Staphylococcus spp. (S. aureus and S. epidermidis). Subsequently, an antibacterial protein from <b>king</b> <b>cobra</b> venom was purified by gel filtration, anion exchange and heparin chromatography. Mass spectrometry analysis confirmed that the protein was <b>king</b> <b>cobra</b> L-amino acid oxidase (Oh-LAAO). SDS-PAGE showed that the protein has an estimated molecular weight of 68 kDa and 70 kDa under reducing and non-reducing conditions, respectively. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of Oh-LAAO for all the 12 bacteria were obtained using radial diffusion assay method. Oh-LAAO had the lowest MIC value of 7. 5 µg/mL against S. aureus ATCC 25923 and ATCC 29213, MRSA ATCC 43300, and S. epidermidis ATCC 12228. Therefore, the LAAO enzyme from <b>king</b> <b>cobra</b> venom may be useful as an antimicrobial agent...|$|R
