40|$|The {{in-plane}} vibration of a slider-mass {{which is}} driven around {{the surface of}} a <b>flexible</b> <b>disc,</b> and the transverse vibration of the disc, are investigated. The disc is taken to be an elastic annular plate and the slider has flexibility and damping in the circumferential (in-plane) and transverse directions. The static friction coefficient is assumed to be higher than the dynamic friction. As a result of the friction force acting between the disc and the slider system, the slider will oscillate in the stick-slip mode in the plane of the disc. The transverse vibration induced by the slider will change the normal force on the disc, which in turn will change the in-plane oscillation of the slider. A numerical method is used to solve the two coupled equations of the motion. Results indicate that normal pressure and rotating speed can drive the system into instability. The rigidity and damping of the disc and transverse stiffness and damping of the slider tend to suppress the vibrations. The in-plane stiffness and damping of the slider do not always have a stabilizing effect.

On day 14, the bone volume associated with titanium-plate-stabilized discs bearing an adsorbed depot of BMP- 2 was 10 -fold higher than that associated with their mechanically unstabilized counterparts. The bone volume associated with discs bearing a coating-incorporated depot of BMP- 2 was similar in the mechanically unstabilized and titanium-plate-stabilized groups, and comparable to that associated with the titanium-plate-stabilized discs bearing an adsorbed depot of BMP- 2. Hence, if an osteogenic agent is delivered in a cell-mediated manner (via coating degradation), ossification can be promoted even within a mechanically unstable environment...|$|R

For the PRV subjected to inner pressure, the calculation {{results show that the}} location of maximum contact press on the sealing ring varies from the outer region to the inner region when the inner pressure increases from 1 to 7 MPa. The PRV with a more <b>flexible</b> <b>disc</b> exhibits a higher maximum contact press, thus resulting in a better sealing performance. For the PRV subjected to impact load in the case of re-closing process, the effects of disc flexibility on the PRV sealing performance was also studied. The finite calculation results indicate that the maximum plastic deformation is located in the outer region of the disc sealing ring and the sliding was occurred on the sealing ring, which is validated by experiments. The maximum plastic deformation and the displacement of sliding increase with a rise of disc flexibility. The plastic deformation and sliding has little effect on the sealing performance when the inner pressure close to setting pressure. As a result, the PRV with a higher disc flexibility showed a better sealing performance after re-closing impact process.

40|$|The {{conventional}} way in time {{of flight}} TOF neutron spectroscopy is to use neutron pulses of one monochromatic wavelength. Repetition Rate Multiplication implies using a set of several monochromatic wavelengths coming from one source pulse, instead of a single one. This makes possible to overcome a major efficiency draw back of practical pulsed neutrons sources, the too low pulse repetition rate for TOF spectroscopy and allow us to freely choose the pulse repetition rate at the sample. Here we present the first experimental realization of this novel technique using the <b>flexible</b> <b>disc</b> chopper system of the TOF spectrometer NEAT at BENSC and report about the first real life data collection by Repetition Rate Multiplication. The first choppers of the instrument emulated a pulsed source with 20 40 Hz repetition rate with the sample at 13. 5 m, and the secondary spectrometer was operated with about 160 Hz chopper pulse frequency. The spectra have been detected by 3 He counters placed at 2. 5 meter from the sample. Several RRM frames with different incoming wavelengths have been recorded coming from each source chopper pulse. The results show that information from different RRM frames can be efficiently combined and evaluated. This offers more efficient use of the pulsed source by cutting the data collection dead time, and allows for faster and enhanced quality data collection by using several monochromatic wavelengths in paralle...|$|E
40|$|Cardiac emboli in {{patients}} with atrial fibrillation {{are one of the}} major causes of ischemic stroke. Because the vast majority of these cardiac emboli descend from the left atrial appendage (LAA), the therapeutic strategy of percutaneous transcatheter occlusion of the LAA by means of a mechanical implant was a logical consequence. Three different devices have been developed and used in humans: PLAATO, WATCHMAN, and ACP. The PLAATO implant, a "soccer ball" shaped self-expanding nitinol cage has demonstrated stroke prevention capability in small, uncontrolled studies. The WATCHMAN implant, a "half rugby ball" shaped self-expanding nitinol cage, has demonstrated non inferiority compared to warfarin treatment in the randomized, controlled PROTECT AF trial. The ACP implant is also a self-expanding nitinol cage. However, its design is of fundamental difference compared to the other two implants. ACP consists of two parts connected by a short waist, which are an "icehockey puck" shaped body for the implant fixation in the appendage wall, and a <b>flexible</b> <b>disc</b> for sealing the appendage ostium. Due to the very flexible connecting waist between the two parts, ACP implant adapts itself to the LAA, which appears in significant individual structural variabilities. The currently unpublished initial experience with ACP in Europe is encouraging. Transcatheter occlusion of the LAA offers an appealing way to reduce the incidence of cardioembolic stroke {{in patients}} with atrial fibrillation. However, the concerns about procedural safety and the need for long-term follow up should be addressed before this potentially important technology is deployed widely...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{consider}} optimal placements of two-dimensional flexible (elastic, deformable) objects. The {{objects are}} discs of equal size placed within a rigid boundary. The paper {{is divided into}} two parts. In the first part, analytical results for three types of regular, periodic arrangements-the hexagonal, square, and triangular placements-are presented. The regular arrangements are analyzed for rectangular boundaries and radii of discs that are small compared to the area of the placement region, because, in this case, the influence of boundary conditions can be neglected. This situation is called the unbounded case. They show that, for the unbounded case among the three regular placements, the type of hexagonal arrangements provides the largest number of placed units for the same deformation depth. Furthermore, it can be proved that these regular placements are not too far from the truly optimal arrangements. For example, hexagonal placements differ at most by the factor of 1. 1 from the largest possible number of generally shaped units in arbitrary arrangements. These analytical results are used as guidances for testing stochastic algorithms optimizing placements of flexible objects. In the second part, mainly two problems are considered: the underlying physical model and a simulated annealing algorithm maximizing the number of <b>flexible</b> <b>discs</b> in equilibrium placements.

40|$|Abstract: The dynamic {{behaviour}} of a rotor {{consisting of two}} tuned and mistuned bladed discs on a solid shaft is considered. The effect of the shaft’s flexibility on the dynamic characteristics of the bladed discs and the coupling effects between the shaft and bladed disc modes are investigated. Results show clearly the coupling effects in a bladed disc-shaft system. Interference diagrams are developed, from which the {{dynamic behaviour}} of a bladed disc can be predicted for varying flexibility relationships between solid shafts and bladed discs. The global rotating mode shapes of flexible tuned and mistuned bladed disc-shaft assemblies are calculated. Rotational effects, such as centrifugal stiffening, are accounted for and all the possible couplings between the flexible parts are allowed. Calculated natural frequencies obtained from the blade, the bladed disc and the shaft with two discs are checked to discover resonance conditions and coupling effects. It is shown that blade mistuning strongly affects the interaction between <b>flexible</b> bladed <b>discs</b> and a <b>flexible</b> shaft. This interaction affects the <b>flexible</b> bladed <b>disc</b> modes and is not restricted to the modes with zero, one and two nodal diameters.

The training of ANN was realized with archives of 3 and 6 volunteers for each one of 4 muscles involved, and in the test stage we used the volunteers was not submitted to the training stage. The results of training stage of ANN showed that was reached the anticipated value for the 3 mandibular situation studied for 3 and 6 volunteers.

40|$|For pt. I see ibid., p. 890 - 904. The {{paper is}} a {{continuation}} of the first part, where the authors considered regular arrangements of flexible objects for the unbounded case. The present part deals with a simulated annealing algorithm maximizing the number of flexible objects in equilibrium placements within rigid boundaries. The forces caused by the boundary are taken into account, i. e., the bounded case of placements is considered. The simulated annealing procedure makes use of the special structure of the underlying configuration space and relationships between deformations of flexible objects and resulting forces. This allows one to obtain tight bounds for the annealing parameters which result in n 3 / 2 ·In 5 / 2 and n·In 2 n time bounds, respectively, for the computation of equilibrium states by two different cooling schedules. The deformation/force formula is derived from a physical model of <b>flexible</b> <b>discs</b> and is based on numerical experiments which were performed for different materials and different sizes of objects.

The seven intervertebral ligaments which span each pair of adjacent vertebrae and the two synovial joints on each vertebra (facets or zygapophyseal joints) allow controlled, fully three-dimensional motion...|$|R

METHODS: The composite resin {{used in this study}} was the experimental material, Hermes (3 M/ESPE). Seventy standardised specimens were prepared using a perspex mould. All samples were stored in distilled water for 10 days. Samples were randomly divided into 7 groups (n= 10). Thereafter, the average roughness of one side of each specimen (formed against the matrix) was recorded using a surface roughness meter (Surftest SJ 301) (control). The other side of each specimen was roughened with 320 grit silicone-carbide paper in a polishing machine for 45 seconds. The finishing/polishing of specimens was performed following the five different protocols according to the manufacturer’s instructions: (1) Enhance polishing cones (E), (2) Enhance followed by POGO (EPG), (3) Jiffy Polishing Cups (J), (4) consecutive use of four <b>flexible</b> Sof-Lex <b>discs</b> (S), (5) consecutive use of four <b>flexible</b> Sof-Lex <b>discs</b> followed by Sof-Lex brush(SB), (6) consecutive use of three flexible OpenDiscs (O), and (7) consecutive use of three flexible OpenDiscs followed by Openshine brushes (OB). The mean roughness of each polished surfaces was determined using the surface profilometer, collecting 5 measurements from each specimen. Data was analyzed statistically (ANOVA). Results: The mean average roughness (Ra) values obtained for specimens in Groups 2 - 8 that were treated with one of the polishing systems ranged from 0. 63 – 1. 21 μm. ANOVA analysis demonstrated a statistically significant difference between Enhance (roughest) compared to all the other groups (P < 0. 001). There were no statistical significant differences (p< 0. 001) between Groups 3 (Enhance and POGO 2), 4 (Jiffy Polishing Cups), 5 (Sof-Lex), 6 (Sof-Lex and Sof-Lex Brushes), 7 (OpenDiscs) and 8 (OpenDiscs and OpenShine Brushes). Clinical Significance: All the polishing techniques evaluated in this study, {{with the possible exception of}} Enhance Points, can be utilised to produce a smooth surface on Hermes composite resin material. The material Hermes can be polished to a high gloss and excellent smoothness, and will be acceptable for usage in the mouth...|$|R
