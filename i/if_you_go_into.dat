6000|$|Lord Valleys {{raised his}} eyebrows. [...] "Waste of time," [...] he said. [...] "You'd know {{more at the}} end of it, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> the House at once. You take the matter too seriously." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{might go}} so far as to point out that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> the stable <b>you</b> would find a spanner on the ledge behind the door. It's an {{instrument}} that's made for screwing off nuts with." ...|$|R

"Moreover, Albert, you cannot but {{be proud}} of the name your father and those before him have won by their gallant deeds, but <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> the Church {{it would no longer}} appear in the roll of the knights of England.

"You are now an ensign," [...] he said, [...] "and, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> {{any more}} fights before your {{regiment}} arrives, you must, Mr. Wilks said, get a proper uniform made for you, and fight as a king's officer.

I think <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> any kid's room in any country in the world, you wouldn't be able to tell what country you were in. They're all wearing Reeboks and Levi's. I think kids are essentially the same the world over and that's why this concept is so powerful." ...|$|R

"I {{have already}} {{described}} {{the way in}} which the city is walled, but they say that it was divided up into narrow streets in the same irregular manner as in Athens, and that the houses were built in such a way that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> look at them from outside they had only one story, while <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> one of them, you at once found subterranean chambers extending as far below the level of the earth as did the chambers above." ...|$|R
5000|$|Pianist Levy {{attested to}} that fact, saying, [...] "I didn’t {{even know they}} {{recorded}} Ella in Rome, I really didn’t.

You could never get it <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> a studio.” [...] Upon its release in 1988, the album went straight to No. 1 on the Billboard jazz charts.|$|R

You can't {{read his}} bosom quite distinctly;--but you may read your own. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> office you become the {{servant of the}} country,--not his servant, and should assume his motive in {{selecting}} {{you to be the}} same as your own in submitting to the selection. Your foot must be on the ladder before you can get to the top of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One {{may be more}} {{awkward to}} deal with than two, or two hundred, for that matter. In a place that's full of women you needn't look at them unless you like; but <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> a room where {{there is only one}} woman, young or old, pretty or ugly, you have got to face her. And, unless you are after her, then--the {{governor}} is right enough--she's in the way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I shall {{think of}} it. You were an old man, Mr. Brown, {{and the money}} was enough for you; or, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> did <b>go</b> <b>into</b> trade again, the old way would have suited you best." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, it's {{your own}} affair, my boy. I {{have no right}} to interfere, and shall not attempt to do so; but of course I must be anxious. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> did <b>go</b> <b>into</b> the church, I suppose he'd buy a living for you?" ...|$|R

He'll die, I know he will--with that reeking {{skirt of}} his. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> must <b>go</b> <b>into</b> the water, I {{wish you had}} worn your abbate's dress.

6000|$|... "No; <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> this, young man, {{you go into}} it {{with your}} eyes open.

These ten-pound householders, now: why ten? Draw the line somewhere--yes: but why just at ten? That's a difficult question, now, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> it." ...|$|E
6000|$|They {{talked the}} matter over, and at length {{concluded}} to {{do a little}} more exploring of the cave. Dave turned up the pocket lantern as high as possible, and as he did this Roger took from his pocket a short, strong cord. [...] "I thought this might come in useful, for tying up our supplies," [...] explained the senator's son, [...] "so I brought it from the last house we stopped at.

"Look here, my son, I've been {{thinking}} about you a considerable bit since I found {{it was no use}} trying to scare you out of the plan, and in a year's time or so, I reckon, between the captain and Walters and me, we can get you in up to headquarters. Now, don't jump so! I didn't mean we allowed <b>you</b> could <b>go</b> there as a recruit; but the captain was saying the other night that we might work it so's you could get some kind of a berth there--sweeping floors, washing windows, and the like of that, which, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> keep your ears and eyes open, would amount to the same as <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> actual training. <b>You</b> ain't the lad I've got in my eye <b>if</b> <b>you</b> couldn't soon work your way into one of the classes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So do {{half the}} people who are in it. You, my dear, must have so many things, so many people, so much mise-en-scène and such a {{perpetual}} spectacle to live," [...] Nick went on. [...] "Perpetual motion, perpetual visits, perpetual crowds! <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> the country you'll see forty people every day and be mixed up with them all day. The idea of a quiet fortnight in town, when by a happy if idiotic superstition everybody goes out of it, disconcerts and frightens you. It's the very time, it's the very place, to do a little work and possess one's soul." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Get money!' {{answered}} the Witch. 'Listen! When {{you reach the}} bottom of the tree you will find yourself in a large hall; it is light there, for there are more than three hundred lamps burning. Then you will see three doors, which you can open--the keys are in the locks. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> the first room, you will see a great chest {{in the middle of the}} floor with a dog sitting upon it; he has eyes as large as saucers, but you needn't trouble about him. I will give you my blue-check apron, which you must spread out on the floor, and then go back quickly and fetch the dog and set him upon it; open the chest and take as much money as you like. It is copper there. If you would rather have silver, you must go into the next room, where there is a dog with eyes as large as mill-wheels. But don't take any notice of him; just set him upon my apron, and help yourself to the money. If you prefer gold, you can get that too, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> the third room, and as much as you like to carry. But the dog that guards the chest there has eyes as large as the Round Tower at Copenhagen! He is a savage dog, I can tell you; but you needn't be afraid of him either. Only, put him on my apron and he won't touch you, and you can take out of the chest as much gold as you like!' ...|$|E

"Yes," [...] he said, {{when he had}} {{recovered}} a little, [...] "so I suppose did Seyapi and his people, but you have been burying them this afternoon--haven't you?--all except the girl, Noie, whom you have sheltered, for which deed Dingaan will bury you all <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> Zululand, or rather throw you to the vultures. Don't think that your being an umfundusi, I mean a teacher, will save you. The Almighty Himself can't save you there. You will be dead and forgotten in a month. What's more, {{you will have to}} drive your own waggon in, for your Kaffirs won't, they know better. A Bible won't turn the blade of an assegai." ...|$|E
500|$|For Elvis Costello, The Basement Tapes [...] "sound {{like they}} were made in a {{cardboard}} box. I think [...] was trying to write songs that sounded like he'd just found them under a stone.

5000|$|The {{description}} of Apollonius's visit to India {{is made in}} Book II, and particularly the visit {{to the city of}} Taxila, described in chapters 20 to 24.

6000|$|Here is {{a pretty}} piece of work done for ourself and our allies, while Valori is quietly dining with the Prince of Dessau! The King stayed about two hours; was {{extremely}} polite, and even frank and communicative. [...] "A very high-spirited young King," [...] thinks Neipperg, reporting of it; [...] "will not stand contradiction; but a great deal can be made of him, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> his ideas, and humor him in a delicate dexterous way. He did not the least hide his engagements with France, Bavaria, Saxony; but would really, so far as I Neipperg could judge, prefer friendship with Austria, on the given terms; and seems to have secretly a kind of pique at Saxony, and no favor for the French and their plans."

6000|$|... "In religion, yes," [...] {{said his}} {{companion}} emphatically; [...] "they {{had come to}} look on the Christ {{as a sort of}} amiable elder Brother, whose letters from abroad were worth reading. Then, when they had emptied all the divine mystery and wonder out of their faith naturally they grew tired of it, oh, but dreadfully tired of it. I know many English of the country parts, and always they tell me they go to church once in each week to set the good example to the servants. They were tired of their faith, but they were not virile enough to become real Pagans; their dancing fauns were good young men who tripped Morris dances and ate health foods and believed in a sort of Socialism which made for the greatest dulness of the greatest number. You will find plenty of them still <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> what remains of social London." ...|$|E
40|$|It {{is tempting}} to {{speculate}} that the beggars reflected social, economic, or religious divisions in Sung society. During Sung Chinese society underwent a great transformation. Among the most striking features of this change were the rapid growth and diversification of trade, the progressive urbanization of society, and the growth to prosperity of an urban class who included the beggars with its own distinctive cultural. The article discussed the urban populations of the sharp disparity {{in the distribution of}} wealth between the rich and the poor. The poor settled in sparsely settled borderlands as migrant laborers or emigrated to cities to beg for food, money, clothes. Beggars were so poor that them made a living by asking for a meal. So, it was the greatest disgrace to anyone <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> beggars. Besides, beggars couldn’t be choosers, must took whatever was offered them. 第一節〈前言〉，從研究回顧，談到寫作動機與問題意識。 第二節〈乞食與謀生〉的論述主旨有二：一是探討乞丐形成的原因，二是乞丐的謀生技能。 第三節〈弱勢乞丐〉的論述主旨，探討乞丐中的殘疾和女性人士，他們在父系社會下，可說乞丐的弱勢者。 第四節〈心態與形象〉的論述主旨有二：一是乞丐的乞食心態，二是宋人記錄下的乞丐形象。 第五節〈神仙與果報〉的論述主旨有二：一是乞丐的神仙傳說，二是乞丐的奇言異行，三是因果報應論述下的乞丐面相。 第六節〈政治互動與官方賑濟〉的論述主旨有三：一是乞丐組織的發展，二是乞丐與政治的互動，三是官方賑濟乞丐的活動。 第七節〈結語〉，整理正文要旨，要加入城市文明、人口壓力、統治策略等考察焦點，將乞丐行為的微觀考察彙整成宋代社會形態的宏觀論述...|$|R
