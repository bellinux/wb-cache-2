Objective: This study was designed to compare old and new practices of corneal care for reduction in corneal complications in ventilated patients. Methods: This study was done in three phases each of six month duration. Phase 1 was the ongoing practice of eye care in the unit. Before the start of phase 2, a new protocol was made for eye care. Corneal complications were observed in terms of haziness, dryness, and ulceration. All nursing staffs were educated and made compliant with the new protocol. In phase 2, a <b>follow-up</b> <b>audit</b> was done to check the effectiveness and compliance to protocol. In phase 3, a <b>follow-up</b> <b>audit</b> was started 3 months after phase 2. Results: In phase 1, total ventilated patients were 40 with 240 ventilator days. The corneal dryness rate was 40 per 1000 ventilator days while the haziness and ulceration rate was 16 per 1000 ventilator days each.

40|$|In Hong Kong, {{antibiotic}} orientated audits {{have been}} conducted with respect to (1) the use of paediatric tetracyclines, and (2) ward usage of expensive antibiotics. Consistent with the very high local prevalence of discolouration in the secondary dentition among young persons in the early 1980 s, the use of paediatric tetracyclines (sales of liquid formulations) was more than ten-fold greater than the corresponding usage in the UK (inferred from retail prescription surveys). With educational efforts and feedback of such data to doctors, <b>follow-up</b> <b>audits</b> confirm a dramatic reduction in such use of tetracyclines in Hong Kong. A one-month audit of expensive antibiotic administration and dispensing in a single medical ward of Queen Mary Hospital revealed that: (a) much larger amounts of β-lactams were dispensed than administered to patients, and (b) the amount of Unasyn® being given intravenously was probably excessive, considering the good oral bioavailability of this pro-drug.

Objectives: The broad objective of the project was to implement evidence-based best practice in the reporting and documentation of adverse drug reactions by health care professionals at a Kenyan public hospital. Methods: The project was designed as a Joanna Briggs Institute Practical Application of Clinical Evidence System best practice implementation project constituting three phases; audit design and baseline audit, implementation of best practice and post-implementation audit. Barriers and strategies to best practice were identified and implemented respectively in phase two.

It sets forth policy, uniform performance standards, and procedural guidance to NASA personnel for use when considering reports issued by the Office of Inspector General (OIG), other executive branch audit organizations, the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA), and the General Accounting Office (GAO). It is intended to: specify principal roles; strengthen the procedures for management decisions (resolution) on audit findings and corrective action on audit report recommendations; emphasize the importance of monitoring agreed upon corrective actions to assure actual accomplishment; and foster the use of audit reports as effective tools of management. A flow chart depicting the NASA audit and management decision process is in Appendix A. This handbook is a controlled handbook issued in loose-leaf form and will be revised by page changes.

40|$|Purpose: Diagnostic Imaging Pathways (DIP) is an ‘on-line’ evidencebased {{decision}} support tool ([URL] {{that was developed}} at Royal Perth Hospital (RPH) to facilitate appropriate diagnostic imaging requesting behaviour amongst clinicians. This study aims to evaluate compliance of diagnostic imaging requests to recommendations outlined in DIP and reasons for non-compliance. Methods and materials: Retrospective audits, followed by intervention and re-audits were {{carried out in the}} Emergency Department (ED). Pathways targeted were: ‘Suspected Pulmonary Embolism’, ‘Ankle Injury’ ‘Suspected Renal Colic’ and ‘Non Traumatic Acute Abdominal Pain’. Interventions included: regular reminders to staff to refer to DIP, education on DIP recommendations, introduction of request forms detailing “proof” of adherence to pathways, and refusal of inappropriate examinations. Results: In the initial audits (N  658), 285 (43 %) received imaging of doubtful appropriateness whilst 158 (24 %) received examinations without indications. <b>Follow-up</b> <b>audits</b> demonstrate only partial improvements in compliance. Requesters failed to follow recommendations for many reasons including: insufficient time to learn about recommendations; disbelief in their validity; failure to understand the importance of adhering to recommendations. Requesters may provide inaccurate pre-requisite information or ‘pressurise’ providers to accept a request without pre-requisites. Providers fail in their ‘gatekeeper’ function because of insufficient time to deliver education, difficulty obtaining pre-requisite information, and reluctance to resist a demand. Conclusion: Targeted interventions were only partially successful in eliminating non-compliance with evidence-based pathways (DIP) amongst clinicians in this study. Future investigations should examine the extent to which information-communication technology linked to electronic ordering of imaging can suppress inappropriate practice...|$|R
