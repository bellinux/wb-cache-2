40|$|Abstract — The European ECSS {{series of}} {{standards}} for the aerospace industry includes data <b>definition</b> <b>and</b> database <b>requirements</b> as one of sixteen types of non functional requirement (NFR) for embedded and real time software. A number of data <b>definition</b> <b>and</b> database related concepts are dispersed throughout the ECSS standards to describe at varying levels of details {{the various types of}} candidate data <b>definition</b> <b>and</b> database <b>requirements</b> at the system, software, and hardware levels. This paper organizes these dispersed data <b>definition</b> <b>and</b> database concepts into a generic standards-based reference model of system data <b>definition</b> <b>and</b> database <b>requirements...</b>|$|R

For example, in Toronto, Canada, {{some of the}} requirements include business and liability insurance, a Commercial Vehicle Operator’s Registration for the truck, permits for each municipality being operated in (downtown, various suburbs), a food handler certificate, appropriate driver's licenses for drivers, assistant's licenses for assistants, and a health inspection.|$|E
50|$|The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) {{reviewed}} the WARN Act in 1993 and 2003. The GAO found that certain <b>definitions</b> <b>and</b> <b>requirements</b> of WARN {{are difficult to}} apply when employers and employees assess the applicability of WARN to their circumstances. The GAO recommended amending the WARN Act to simplify the calculation of thresholds, clarify the definition of employer, clarify how damages are calculated, and establish a uniform statute of limitations.|$|E

50|$|In {{common law}} jurisdictions, {{as a civil}} wrong, fraud is a tort. While the precise <b>definitions</b> <b>and</b> <b>requirements</b> of proof vary among jurisdictions, the {{requisite}} elements of fraud as a tort generally are the intentional misrepresentation or concealment of an important fact upon which the victim is meant to rely, and in fact does rely, to the harm of the victim. Proving fraud {{in a court of}} law is often said to be difficult. That difficulty is found, for instance, in that each and every one of the elements of fraud must be proven, that the elements include proving the states of mind of the perpetrator and the victim, and that some jurisdictions require the victim to prove fraud by clear and convincing evidence.|$|E
50|$|One very {{important}} aspect of the remit of the IOC is to draw up and update methods of analysis and standards for olive products with a view to promoting international trade and preventing fraud. To do so, it works very closely with leading chemists from its member countries who contribute their knowledge and expertise. It also cooperates with other international organisations such as the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) or the Codex Alimentarius Commission in order to bring their testing methods and standards into line with IOC texts. The IOC has two trade standards, one for olive oils and olive pomace oils and the other for table olives. The olive oil standard fixes the names and definitions of the different categories of olive oils and olive pomace oils as well the quality and purity criteria for each grade of product; it specifies testing methods and covers other aspects, such as food additives, contaminants, hygiene, packing, pack fill tolerances and labelling. IOC Members are committed to prohibiting the use of any product names other than those specified in the standard. The table olive standard fixes the names, <b>definitions</b> <b>and</b> <b>requirements</b> for all the different types, styles and trade preparations of table olives.|$|E

40|$|Part 7 : IFIPTM 2017 Graduate SymposiumInternational audienceThe {{processing}} {{of the huge}} amounts of information from the Internet of Things (IoT) has become challenging. Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques {{have been developed to}} handle this task efficiently. However, they require annotated data sets for training, while manual pre{{processing of}} the data sets is costly. The H 2020 project “Bonseyes” has suggested a “Market Place for AI”, where the stakeholders can engage trustfully in business around AI resources and data sets. The MP permits trading of resources that have high privacy requirements (e. g. data sets containing patient medical information) as well as ones with low requirements (e. g. fuel consumption of cars) for the sake of its generality. In this abstract we review trust and privacy definitions and provide a first requirement analysis for them with regards to Cloud-based Market Places (CMPs). The comparison of <b>definitions</b> <b>and</b> <b>requirements</b> allows for the identification of the research gap that will be addressed by the main authors PhD project...|$|E
40|$|Through the {{well-known}} framework contracts, the EU is continuously supporting innovative technologies that might facilitate a step change required for air transport {{in the second}} half of this century and beyond. One of these goals is assessing high-speed flight transportation and its related technologies which are explored in LAPCAT and ATLLAS both being co-funded by the EC. Recently, they have been successfully extended towards a 2 nd phase within the 7 th Framework Programme. Whereas LAPCAT focuses on high-speed propulsion and aerothermodynamics, ATLLAS addresses rather the need for light-weight and high-temperature resistant materials. The present paper summarizes the objectives and the achievements for each of these projects. The <b>definitions</b> <b>and</b> <b>requirements</b> for the different technologies enabling the design, construction and manufacturing of these vehicles and their sub-systems are driven by new conceptual designs which are carried out in each of them. This assures testing and evaluations at realistic conditions. Tendencies in aeronautics clearly show a continuous increase in air traffic (Figure 1). Based on IAT...|$|E
40|$|The Physical {{qualification}} {{standards for}} aviation service {{used by the}} United States Army, Navy/Marine Corps, Air Force, and Coast Guard developed in parallel, diverging in many instances due to differences ranging from terminology to mission. Presently, standards and requirements for waiver vary widely between the services, in spite of minimal differences in aeromedical concerns for any given medical condition. Standardization or increased concordance between the services would have several advantages leading to more efficient and effective delivery of aviation medical support to the operational forces. This is particularly true in an increasingly joint operational environment. The authors have identified four major hurdles that must be overcome before the concept of joint aviation physical standards can be explored. These include: a difference in terminology including aviator classification, a difference in mission <b>definitions</b> <b>and</b> <b>requirements,</b> {{a difference in the}} processes of policy development, and a difference in the review and application of those policies. These hurdles are explored, and suggestions for their mitigation are presented with open discussion following...|$|E
