In 2009, none were considered to be regional priorities, so no other improvements were likely to be <b>funded</b> <b>in</b> the short term.|$|E

5|$|Even {{before its}} closure, there was {{interest}} in retaining the canal for its amenity value. The Stroudwater Canal Society, which {{later became the}} Cotswold Canals Trust, was formed in 1972. Following initial hostility from the Proprietors, {{who had not been}} stripped of their powers when the canal had closed, agreement was reached and work began on restoration of the waterway. The project gained popularity, and in 2003, a bid was made to the Heritage Lottery Fund for £82 million to restore both the Stroudwater Navigation and the Thames and Severn Canal. The project had to be split into smaller parts, and only the first phase has so far been <b>funded</b> <b>in</b> this way, when a grant of £11.9 million was confirmed in 2006. With match funding, this was to enable the section from 'The Ocean' at Stonehouse to Wallbridge to be reopened, together with the Wallbridge to Brimscombe Port section of the Thames and Severn.|$|E
