40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{algorithm}} for optimizing {{the route of}} a connection that becomes suboptimal due to operations such as handoffs and location-based reroutes, for mobile ATM (asynchronous transfer mode) networks based on the PNNI (private network-to-network interface) standard. This algorithm uses hierarchical route information of the connection and summarized topology and loading information of the network to determine a "crossover node" such that adjusting the connection from that crossover node results in an optimally routed connection. We then apply this algorithm to the mobile location management problem. Location management schemes have been proposed in which an incoming call to a mobile is first routed to its <b>home</b> <b>switch</b> (based on summarized reachability data) and then rerouted to the mobile's current location. If we consider such rerouting a "first phase" of mobile connection setup, a "second phase" is required to optimize the paths of such rerouted connections. Such an approach is considered a two-phase mobile location/connection setup scheme. Alternatively, an incoming call to a mobile can be first routed to its <b>home</b> <b>switch</b> based on summarized reachability data, and then "cranked back" to an optimal crossover node before rerouting the connection to the mobile's current location. Such a scheme is a one-phase mobile location/connection setup scheme since it directly results in an optimal path. A comparative performance analysis of the oneand two-phase connection setup schemes is presented. Measures of comparison are call setup delay {{and the amount of}} network resources allocated to a connection. The maximum call setup delay (worst case call setup delay) is lower in the two-phase scheme, but the average call setup delay is lower in the one-phase scheme. T [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The Screen Time Weight-loss Intervention Targeting Children at <b>Home</b> (<b>SWITCH)</b> trial {{tested a}} family {{intervention}} to reduce screen-based sedentary behaviour in overweight children. The trial {{found no significant}} effect of the intervention on children’s screen-based sedentary behaviour. To explore these null findings, we conducted a pre-planned process evaluation, focussing on intervention delivery and uptake. Methods SWITCH was a randomised controlled trial of a 6 -month family intervention to reduce screen time in overweight children aged 9 – 12 years (n[*]=[*] 251). Community workers met with each child’s primary caregiver to deliver the intervention content. Community workers underwent standard training and were monitored once {{by a member of}} the research team to assess intervention delivery. The primary caregiver implemented the intervention with their child, and self-reported intervention use at 3 and 6  months. An exploratory analysis determined whether child outcomes at 6  months varied by primary caregiver use of the intervention. Results Monitoring indicated that community workers delivered all core intervention components to primary caregivers. However, two thirds of primary caregivers reported using any intervention component “sometimes” or less frequently at both time points, suggesting that intervention uptake was poor. Additionally, analyses indicated no effect of primary caregiver intervention use on child outcomes at 6  months, suggesting the intervention itself lacked efficacy. Conclusions Poor uptake, and the efficacy of the intervention itself, may have played a role in the null findings of the SWITCH trial on health behaviour and body composition.

40|$|We {{envision}} the home populated with regular objects that allow programmatic {{access to their}} sensors and actuators. The objects jointly form a pervasive computing platform, open for third-party independently developed applications. A challenge is how to support people in deploying and managing such applications. Today, the user perceives an application as an immaterial artifact, accessed through a screen-based interface of a general-purpose computing device. Contrary to that established paradigm, we propose to reify the pervasive computing application as a simple physical thing, called the "application pill. " The pill can easily be grasped and operated: the user brings the pill <b>home,</b> <b>switches</b> it on, and checks if it works just by glancing at its on/off diode. As the application is destined for many homes, each featuring a different collection of objects, the user should be provided with high-level feedback on how well the application can work in her home. Accordingly, the application pill is also equipped with a simple "functionality level" indicator. The {{degree to which the}} application can deliver its functionality on top of an available object collection is captured as a single number and displayed by the pill. We present a concrete proof-of-concept elaboration and implementation of these ideas in a pervasive computing middleware platform targeted at cooperating objects...|$|R

40|$|The Conference program's website {{is located}} at [URL] develop a three-country version of the Helpman, Melitz and Yeaple (2004) model with firm heterogeneity, {{industry}} heterogeneity and country heterogeneity to study firms’ foreign market entry strategies. We show that (i) for any single host country, the export-FDI cutoff is higher in more skill-intensive industries than in less skill-intensive industries; and (ii) for any single industry, the cutoff is lower (higher) in the more developed country than in the less developed country if the industry’s skill intensity is high (low). We also use this model to study how economic policy changes in one foreign country (F 1) affect home firms’ market entry decisions in another foreign country (F 2). We predicts that FDI liberalization in F 1 results in the following: (i) some firms from the <b>home</b> country <b>switch</b> from export to FDI in F 1; (ii) skilled labor’s wage rate drops in the home country; (iii) wage inequality between the skilled and unskilled labor decreases; and (iv) some firms from the <b>home</b> country <b>switch</b> from FDI to export to F 2. The effects from trade liberalization are just the opposite, but the effects from education improvement are qualitatively the same as FDI liberalization. The cross-country externalities work through the domestic labor market, which is a new channel to understand cross-country effects of trade and FDI liberalization. The existence of cross-country externalities reduces the effects of foreign country’s liberalization on the home country’s labor market. postprin...|$|R
