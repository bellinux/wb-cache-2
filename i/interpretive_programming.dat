5000|$|Gary E. Everhardt (born 1934) [...] was {{the ninth}} Director of the US National Park Service (NPS). He began his NPS {{career as an}} {{engineer}} in 1957 and rose to the superintendency of Grand Teton National Park in 1972. Favorable notice there propelled him to the directorship in January 1975. As director he oversaw a great increase in park development and <b>interpretive</b> <b>programming</b> for the Bicentennial of the American Revolution. The return of an NPS careerist to the job was much applauded by park employees and supporters, but Everhardt's leadership fell short of expectations, and the new Carter administration returned him to the field as Blue Ridge Parkway's superintendent in May 1977.|$|E

50|$|The Guard's {{most senior}} non-administrative {{position}} {{is that of the}} Guard Captain who oversees all aspects of training and performance throughout the summer. His second in command is the Artillery Lieutenant {{who is in charge of}} the fort's artillery. There are also two Ensigns whose main duties are to carry the Regimental Colours when parading, instruct new staff about the history of the Fort and manage <b>interpretive</b> <b>programming,</b> and to assist in the running of Fort Henry as officer of the day. The Guard is composed of two sub-units: the Drill Squad, a precision drill team led by the Serjeant Major and Colour Serjeant; and a precision military marching unit known as the Drums, who play snare and bass drums, fifes and bugles led by the Drum Major and a Drum Serjeant who acts as his or her second-in-command (2 I/C). Other positions within the Guard can include an Adjutant (typically the rank of an Infantry Lieutenant),a Brigade Serjeant Major, who can act as the NCO in charge of the artillery in the absence of a lieutenant, serjeants to assist in artillery and/or interpretation duties, and several junior non-commissioned officers within the two main sub-units who are involved with the training and immediate supervision of the privates. Promotion within the Guard is based on merit and seniority - every Guard Captain in the Fort Henry Guard started as a private. There are also domestic interpreters and a headquarters unit; this is usually composed of pipers, Pioneers, and the Goat Major, who is in charge of David XI, a White Saanen Goat who serves as the Guard's mascot. All Guard are trained to man the Fort's guns in the uniforms of the Royal Artillery.|$|E
40|$|Project (M. A., History (Public History)) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2012. In {{the field}} of public history today, it is {{generally}} argued that sites such as historic house museums should interpret the history of ???others??? (i. e. servants, slaves, workers) {{as well as that}} of famous residents, so as to provide visitors with a more complete and accurate history. California???s Governor???s Mansion currently operates as a State Historic Park. <b>Interpretive</b> <b>programming</b> consists of guided tours, outreach programs and holiday events. All programming focuses predominantly on the gubernatorial families who resided in the home, and on the large collection of original artifacts extant within the Mansion. There is at present no regular or comprehensive interpretation of the servants and working culture of the Governor???s Mansion. This thesis project, through creation of historical profiles of five Governor???s Mansion servants, provides material with which to incorporate servant history into the Mansion???s <b>interpretive</b> <b>programming,</b> thereby providing visitors with a more complete history of the site. Sources used to develop the profiles included the oral history and the secondary and primary document collections of the Governor???s Mansion State Historic Park. Equally important were the resources and collections of the California State Library, the Sacramento County Recorder???s Office, the Sacramento Room of the Sacramento County Public Library, the United States Census Bureau, and the library of California State University Sacramento. Additionally, interviews were conducted with staff at the Governor???s Mansion, historic house museum professionals, members of the greater Sacramento community, and with some of the descendants of the servants being profiled.

40|$|<b>Interpretive</b> <b>programs</b> are an {{integral}} part of the recreational opportunities provided at parks, at both the state and federal levels. Commonly led by the Park Naturalist or Interpreter, <b>interpretive</b> <b>programs</b> are a great way for visitors to connect with the park and its natural resources on a more personal level. While many <b>interpretive</b> <b>programs</b> effectively involve visitors with the park, they often only strongly appeal to two very specific age groups: young children or senior citizens. Through a brief research paper and a series of <b>interpretive</b> <b>programs</b> I designed specifically for Maumee Bay State Park in Ohio, I explore the significance of attracting more teens to parks, along with the ways in which park Naturalists and Interpreters can engage more teens in their programs. Focusing on teamwork and social interaction, channeling individualism and emphasizing independence and responsibility, this thesis expands upon how we can use these three elements to attract our future leaders to become more passionate about the environment and natural resources.

40|$|The role of {{interpersonal}} touch {{has been studied}} in communication fields, demonstrating a handshake or other form of appropriate interpersonal touch (AIT) has rendered favorable results in rapport building with an audience as well as developing audience comfort and receptivity to messaging. This study aimed {{to determine if the}} use of a handshake prior to <b>interpretive</b> <b>programming</b> would increase the positivity of perception of a visitor toward interpreters and/or the message shared by interpreters. Researchers also sought the viewpoints of professionals in the field of interpretation about the current use and perception of touch. Finally, a post-survey interview was conducted with each interpreter involved the study. Through three angles, the research demonstrated that AIT positively affects a visitor’s perception of the interpreter and the message shared. The research also provides boundaries and next steps toward researching AIT’s role in the field of interpretation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Partnerships {{significantly}} {{augment the}} capacity of the USDA Forest Service to care for its lands and serve people using those lands. As part of the agency’s recreation program, partners perform diverse services such as trail building, <b>interpretive</b> <b>programming,</b> grant writing, monitoring, and general maintenance. However, the increasingly formal nature of agency partnerships has added administrative complexity to relationships that were once solidified by handshakes. This paper explores the programmatic capacity of recreation partnerships using data from a multi-phased study conducted with agency personnel. The study found that dedicated leadership cultivates vibrant partnership programs. However, agency personnel expressed concern for declining programmatic capacity due to staff turnover, job compression, and outsourcing. Strategies for building programmatic capacity are discussed, including formalizing work with partnerships as an accountable job duty. As reliance on agency partnerships are predicted to increase, the implications section addresses the specific administrative challenges of partnering...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the implementation of}} an <b>interpretive</b> <b>programming</b> language used to program and operate a fully autonomous Smart House. The program uses an instruction set that consists of intuitive English commands that are input by a user. It was designed for easy use and minimal memory consumption. The commands will be executed by a Motorola M 68 HC 11 (6811) microcontroller. The user interface is a text file that consists of commands containing specific key words. The control program, typed in by the user, {{is used by the}} interpretive program to generate an instruction array and a time line. These components are used by the microcontroller to execute the desired actions. The text file, time line, and instruction array are all passed to the microcontroller and stored in memory. For this reason, a PC is not necessary for operation of the Smart House...|$|E

40|$|SummaryThe {{interactive}} {{visualization of}} large biological assemblies poses {{a number of}} challenging problems, including the development of multiresolution representations and new interaction methods for navigating and analyzing these complex systems. An additional challenge {{is the development of}} flexible software environments that will facilitate the integration and interoperation of computational models and techniques {{from a wide variety of}} scientific disciplines. In this paper, we present a component-based software development strategy centered on the high-level, object-oriented, <b>interpretive</b> <b>programming</b> language: Python. We present several software components, discuss their integration, and describe some of their features that are relevant to the visualization of large molecular assemblies. Several examples are given to illustrate the interoperation of these software components and the integration of structural data from a variety of experimental sources. These examples illustrate how combining visual programming with component-based software development facilitates the rapid prototyping of novel visualization tools...|$|E
40|$|Interpretive {{programs}} are offered by parks and public lands to inspire the visitors to further appreciate the heritage resources presented and protected within parks. These {{programs and services}} add an additional dimension to park visits, may increase enjoyment, provide visitors with a richer understanding of heritage resources, create opportunities to influence visitor behaviors in ways helpful to managers, and possibly provide motivations for visitors to extend their stay. Any potential desired outcome resulting from the strategic use of interpretative programs requires participants, and the broader the audience, the wider the influence. Consequently, {{a study of the}} variety of reasons that people are attentive or not to interpretive services could provide ways to modify programming in terms of publicizing, delivery, and content. Specifically, this study explored the types of constraints to attending interpretive (or ranger-led) programs to that visitors experience. Visitors who attended <b>interpretive</b> <b>programming</b> {{and those who do not}} were asked to describe their perceptions about the value of interpretiv...|$|E
40|$|Maintaining and {{adapting}} scientific applications {{software is}} an ongoing issue for many researchers and communities, especially in domains such as geophysics, where community codes are constantly evolving to adopt new solution methods and constitutive laws. Traditional high performance computing code is written in C or Fortran, which offer high performance but are notoriously difficult to evolve and maintain. Object-oriented and <b>interpretive</b> <b>programming</b> languages (such as C++, Java, and Python) offer better support for code evolution and maintenance, but have not been widely adopted for scientific programming, for reasons including their performance and/ or complexity. This paper describes our approach to developing scientific codes in C that provides the flexibility of interpreted object oriented environments {{with the performance of}} traditional C programming, through techniques including entry points, plug-ins, and coarse grained objects. This approach has been used to implement two very differently formulated scientific codes in active use and development by the geophysics scientific community...|$|E

40|$|Matlab is an <b>interpretive</b> <b>programming</b> {{language}} {{originally developed}} for convenient {{use with the}} LINPACK and EISPACK libraries. Matlab is appealing for accelerator physics because it is matrix-oriented, provides an active workspace for system variables, powerful graphics capabilities, built-in math libraries, and platform independence. A number of accelerator software toolboxes have been written in Matlab [...] the Accelerator Toolbox (AT) for model-based machine simulations, LOCO for on-line model calibration, and Matlab Channel Access (MCA) to connect with EPICS. The function of the MATLAB 'Middle Layer' {{is to provide a}} scripting language for machine simulations and on-line control, including non-EPICS based control systems. The Middle Layer has simplified and streamlined development of high-level applications including configuration control, energy ramp, orbit correction, photon beam steering, ID compensation, beam-based alignment, tune correction and response matrix measurement. The database-driven Middle Layer software is largely machine-independent and easy to port. Six accelerators presently use the software package with more scheduled to come on line soon...|$|E
40|$|The 'Touch Terminal' is a {{microprocessor-based}} {{intelligent terminal}} specially {{geared to the}} control of complex processes. It would be ideally suited to the control of a high-energy physics experiment.

These are a 'touch panel' with computer writable legends, a full graphics display screen, and a high level <b>interpretive</b> <b>programming</b> language. It {{can be used in}} two modes. First, as a peripheral to any host computer, so providing the host with touch panel and display facilities at minimum overhead. Secondly, it {{can be used as a}} stand- alone system with its own high level NODAL language. The terminal is compact and uses an internal 11 slot CAMAC bus. This enables the power of the terminal to be increased by adding appropriate CAMAC modules. A CAMAC controller using a powerful microprocessor provides the intelligence for the terminal operation.

40|$|Jython is an {{implementation}} of the <b>interpretive</b> <b>programming</b> language Python written in Java and designed to generate Java Virtual Machine byte codes. It provides easy access to compiled Java classes including substantial Java libraries. It also provides many of the libraries that are popular with programmers of C-based Python. Python‟s object-oriented language constructs support creation of executable specifications for object-oriented Java systems. Python‟s high-level source language mechanisms include generic container types, meta-classes, first-class functions, closures, generators, list comprehensions, source-level reflection and run-time interpretation of generated source code. Consequently, Jython {{can serve as a}} powerful rapid prototyping and extension environment for Java applications and frameworks. Its integration into the Java Virtual Machine allows construction of layered systems composed of Jython and Java layers. Example systems discussed in the paper include a prototype computer game that uses Java‟s graphical user interface libraries, a computer music performance system that allows users to write instrument control code as part of a performance, a Jython-Java layered system for analyzing audio data streams, and multiprocessor performance benchmarks written in Jython and Java...|$|E
