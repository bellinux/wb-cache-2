40|$|AIM: The {{process of}} {{twisting}} {{has been used}} for decades to fabricate stainless steel instruments, but it was previously thought to be an impractical method for nickel-titanium (Ni-Ti) instrument manufacture A manufacturing method of twisting Nickel-Titanium wire to produce Ni-Ti files has been recently developed: the twisted files (TF). Theoretically, this new manufacturing process should overcome the problems associated with a grinding process, which previously limited instrument strength. Since TF manufacturing process is new and different from grinding, the aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the effects of a final <b>deoxidation</b> <b>process</b> (Deox) on torsional resistance of TF instruments. METHODS: Testing was performed in accordance with the International Standard (ISO 3630 - 1) by comparing 20 TF instruments versus 20 TF prototype instruments produced without the final <b>deoxidation</b> <b>process.</b> Data were collected and statistically analyzed (t-test). RESULTS: Results show that TF instruments withstood 90 % more torque (max. torque) than TF prototype instruments manufactured without the <b>deoxidation</b> <b>process</b> (88. 7 vs. 53. 3 g/cm). This difference was found to be statistically significant at the 0. 05 level of significance. CONCLUSION: Since design and dimensions of tested instruments were the same, the <b>deoxidation</b> <b>process</b> could be the only explanation of the improvement in torsional resistance...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{reaction}} mechanism of electrochemical extraction of FexTi alloys direct from natural ilmenite in molten CaCl 2 has been investigated. The electrochemical <b>deoxidation</b> experiment <b>process</b> {{was carried out}} at 1000 °C and 3. 8 V, and a solid oxide oxygen-ion-conducting membrane (SOM) filled with carbon-saturated liquid metal was served as the inert anode of the electrolytic cell.

40|$|Oxygen is {{an element}} that is first {{purposely}} brought into the steel melt to remove some unwanted elements or to reduce their concentration (oxidation).

40|$|Ti– 15 wt % Mo alloys were {{produced}} via the electrochemical deoxidation of (Ti,Mo) O 2 precursors (formed by sintering TiO 2 and MoO 2 blended powders) in a molten CaCl 2 electrolyte at 1173 K via the Fray–Farthing–Chen (FFC) Cambridge process.

40|$|Understanding and {{controlling}} inclusion removal from steel {{is critical in}} modern steelmaking. Inclusions are usually formed as a reaction product of the steel <b>deoxidation</b> <b>process,</b> though they may also result from slag and mould flux entrainment, refractory degradation or precipitation events during steel solidification. They are generally removed by reacting with a slag (liquid oxide) phase. This is primarily achieved by optimising the process conditions to promote contact and reaction between the inclusion and liquid oxide. Efficient inclusion removal from steel is achieved when the inclusions contact the slag phase, leading to bonding and dissolution in the slag. If the bond is weak, then local fluid conditions are {{likely to result in}} the shearing of the inclusion-slag bond and the inclusions remain in the steel. The strength of the inclusion bond or reactivity with slag may be assessed by measuring the dynamic wetting of the slag on a substrate made of the inclusion phase. The least understood component of inclusion removal is inclusion reactivity/separation with the slag phase. The inclusion has to travel across the steel-slag interface to wet the slag. This is favoured when contact angle (θ) for the steel-inclusion is greater than 90 ° (non-wetting) and when this contact angle is greater than θ for the inclusion-slag. While it is understood that inclusion-slag interfacial tension/wetting {{play a critical role in}} inclusion removal, there are only limited wetting data of slags on typical inclusion phase types in literature. Recently, Choi and Lee investigated the wettability of alumina on slag and concluded that for a slag with a given CaO/SiO 2 ratio, an increase in Al 2 O 3 results in an increase in the wetting angle, θ. This may in part be explained by the change in thermodynamic driving force of the reaction and/or a change in the physical characteristics of the slag with increasing alumina...|$|E
40|$|The {{environmentally}} friendly catalyst iron titanate (FeTiOx) {{was reported to}} be very active for the selective catalytic reduction of NOx with NH 3 (NH 3 -SCR), with high N- 2 selectivity and H 2 O/SO 2 durability in the medium temperature range, and the specific microstructure of iron titanate crystallites as the active phase was determined. In consideration of the probable existence of a redox cycle between Fe 3 + and Fe 2 + species in the NH 3 -SCR reaction, the deoxidation behavior of the FeTiOx catalyst in an H- 2 temperature-programmed reduction process was studied extensively by X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine-structure (EXAFS) methods. Owing to the presence of an electronic inductive effect between Fe and Ti species in the unique edge-shared Fe 3 +(O) (2) Ti 4 + structure, the reducibility of Fe 3 + species in the FeTiOx catalyst was greatly enhanced compared with that in pristine Fe 2 O 3, leading to the higher oxidation ability of Fe species in FeTiOx. In the H- 2 temperature-programmed reduction process, the well-dispersed Fe 3 + species in iron titanate crystallites could be totally converted into Fe 2 + in the form of ilmenite FeTiO 3 below 500 degrees C, whereas pristine Fe 2 O 3 could only be reduced to Fe 3 O 4 up to this temperature point. The typical NH 3 -SCR reaction is usually conducted below 500 degrees C, and the enhanced oxidation ability of Fe 3 + species in FeTiOx catalyst is responsible for its excellent catalytic NOx reduction performance at low temperatures. Based on XANES linear fitting and EXAFS curve-fitting results, the specific <b>deoxidation</b> <b>process</b> of the FeTiOx catalyst was proposed, which can provide useful information for the characterization of the microstructure and redox ability of active sites simultaneously in mixed oxide catalysts for certain catalytic reactions...|$|E
40|$|Non-metallic {{inclusions}} are a {{major issue}} during the production of high performance steels, as they influence the microstructure and structural properties to a large extent. They are often considered as harmful to the final product quality and to the steel processing productivity, so that many industrial efforts are directed towards improving inclusion removal. Another, more positive approach is to use non-metallic inclusions to produce steels with enhanced or tailored properties. In both cases, the key issue is to control {{the characteristics of the}} inclusion population in the liquid steel, such as number, composition, morphology, size and spatial distribution. In this doctoral research, the influence of the main inclusion-related process parameters, like the dissolved aluminium (Al) and oxygen (O) content in liquid iron (Fe), on the formation and morphology of Al 2 O 3 inclusions was studied. Deoxidation and reoxidation phenomena in liquid Fe were investigated during lab-scale experiments under rigorously controlled conditions. First of all, a new technique was developed to enable the observation of inclusions in the initial stage of the <b>deoxidation</b> <b>process,</b> by bringing a piece of Al in contact at 1600 °C with liquid Fe containing different dissolved O levels. A significant increase in inclusion number and a change in inclusion morphology from angular to spherical was observed with increasing dissolved O content. The shape transition was explained by the evolution of the supersaturation and the availability of oxygen at the reaction front. Secondly, the inclusion formation and characteristics during reoxidation were investigated by exposing Fe-Al melts to different oxidizing atmospheres with controlled oxygen partial pressure (pO 2). Dendrites, clusters, aggregates and bars were observed near the melt surface at high pO 2, while compact and faceted shapes were found at low pO 2, i. e. under lower supersaturation conditions. Finally, to assist in the interpretation of the experimental results on the inclusion characteristics, a coupled diffusion/reaction model was formulated to estimate the spatial and time dependent Al and O concentration profiles as a function of selected process parameters.

40|$|Inclusions in {{molten steel}} have {{received}} worldwide concern {{due to their}} serious influence on both the steel product quality and the steel production process. These inclusions may come from the <b>deoxidation</b> <b>process,</b> reoxidation by air and/or slag due to an entrainment during steel transfer, and so on. They can break up a casting process by clogging a nozzle. A good knowledge on both steel flow and inclusion behavior is really important to understand nozzle clogging, {{as well as to}} take some possible measures to alleviate clogging. In this thesis, steel flow and inclusion behavior during a teeming process were investigated by mathematical simulations with verification by pilot-plant experiments. Firstly, steel flow phenomena during a ladle teeming process were studied. Different turbulence models, including the low Reynolds number k-ɛ model and the realizable k-ɛ model both with an enhanced wall treatment (EWT) and a standard wall function (SWF), were used to simulate this process. All of these turbulence model predictions generally agreed well with the experimental results. The velocity distributions in the nozzle were also predicted by these turbulence models. A large difference of the boundary-layer velocity predicted with these two near wall treatment methods was found. At the late stage of the teeming process, the drain sink flow phenomena were studied. The combination of an inclined ladle bottom and a gradually expanding nozzle was found to be an effective way to alleviate a drain sink flow during teeming. Then, inclusion behavior during a teeming stage was studied. A Lagranian method was used to track the inclusions in steel flow and compare the behaviors of different-size inclusions. In addition, a statistical analysis was conducted by the use of a stochastic turbulence model to investigate the behaviors of different-size inclusions in different nozzle regions. Inclusions with a diameter smaller than 20 μm were found to have a similar trajectory and velocity distribution in the nozzle. However, inertia force and buoyancy force were found {{to play an important role}} for the behavior of large-size inclusions or clusters. The statistical analysis results indicate that the regions close to the connection between different angled nozzle parts seem to be very sensitive for an inclusion deposition. QC 20130305 </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was carried out to {{investigate}} theformation and chemical development of non-metallic inclusionsduring ladle treatment of steel. To begin with, {{an investigation of the}} deoxidation processand the impact of aluminium addition was carried out. For thispurpose, a new experimental setup was constructed. The setupallowed the examination of the <b>deoxidation</b> <b>process</b> as afunction of time by using a quenching technique. Preliminaryexperiments showed that homogeneous nucleation of alumina tookplace in the areas supersaturated with aluminium. Theseexperiments also showed that agglomeration of alumina particleswas a very rapid process, even when the convection in the meltwas negligible. In order to examine whether aluminium supersaturation occursduring industrial practice, the deoxidation of liquid steelwith aluminium wire injection in a gas-stirred ladle wassimulated by mathematical modeling using a Computational FluidDynamics (CFD) approach. The results showed that theconcentration of aluminium {{in the vicinity of the}} aluminiumwire injection was high enough to generate homogeneousnucleation of alumina. Aiming at an understanding of the inclusion chemistry duringthe ladle process, an industrial study was performed atUddeholm Tooling AB. The impact of slag-lining reactions andladle glaze as a source of inclusions in the melt was alsostudied. The experimental results were analysed from athermodynamic viewpoint to gain an insight into the origins ofthe inclusions and their changes along the process of the ladletreatment. Six types of inclusions were found in the steel. Thetypes of inclusions present varied along the history of theladle treatment. Three types of inclusions were found in theliquid steel before deoxidation, namely type A (a liquidinclusion with high SiO 2 concentration), type B (spinel) andtype C (a combination of type A and type B). Thermodynamicanalysis indicated that these types of inclusions could begenerated by the reaction between the Electric Arc Furnace(EAF) slag and the ladle glaze, during the filling of theladle. The addition of aluminium resulted in the formation ofalumina inclusions (type E), which agglomerated and separatedfrom the steel very fast. The spinel inclusions of type B werefound to be unstable at low oxygen potentials. The inclusionsof this type would react with the liquid metal forming theinclusions of type F (spinel in the centre surrounded by anoxide solution containing Al 2 O 3, CaO and MgO). Further,reaction between the liquid metal and inclusions of type Fwould result in the inclusions of type G, an oxide solutionmostly consisting of Al 2 O 3 and CaO with small amounts of MgOand SiO 2. The inclusions of type G were the only inclusionsfound in the steel before casting. NR 2014080...|$|E
40|$|To keep up {{with the}} tough {{competition}} today {{and to be able to}} offer the customers competitive prices, it is desirable to shorten the ladle treatment and still keep a high quality of the product. To be able to shorten the ladle treatment under these restrictions, faster <b>deoxidation</b> <b>process</b> is demanded. This master’s thesis investigates what influences the reaction coefficient, which describes the separation rate of oxygen. A higher reaction coefficient indicates a fast separation rate. Special attention has been taken to the factor reoxidation, with regard to the nitrogen pick up after tapping and an increase of the oxygen content after degassing. The reaction coefficient has been calculated for four steel groups, two silicon deoxidised groups, one silicon and aluminium deoxidised group and one aluminium deoxidised steel group. The apparent deoxidation is in the reality the sum of two phenomena: deoxidation and reoxidation. An increase of the deoxidation rate or a decrease of the reoxidation rate would result in a higher k-value. A small increase of the reaction coefficient could gain minutes in the process of oxygen removal, which would result in economical benefits. The deoxidisers have naturally a strong effect on the oxygen content and thus on the reaction coefficient. The fastest separation – highest reaction coefficient – after tapping is found for steel groups deoxidised with the strongest deoxidiser: aluminium. Reoxidation occurs after tapping/before degassing due to the breakthrough eye caused by the strong gas injection. By using nitrogen as a tracer for reoxdiation from the atmosphere it was possible to determine if reoxidation had an effect on the deoxidation rate, which it had since the reaction coefficient decreases as the nitrogen content increases. Stirring makes deoxidation quicker, but on the other hand, too intensive stirring retards the deoxidation rate somewhat due to reoxidation. An optimisation of the gas flow rate might be useful to get an optimum relation between deoxidation and reoxdiation, where the fastest separation of oxides is achieved. The deoxidisers have an effect on the oxygen content after degassing and in the tundish. Reoxidation can occur during these time steps too, but most probably not due to reactions with the atmosphere, since the nitrogen content is stable. The oxygen content increases for the silicon deoxidised heats after degassing due to a higher iron oxide content in the top slag. Thus, the FeO content in the slag is too high to keep the low oxygen content in the steel stable. The heats with higher amount of deoxidisers in the steel tend to be able to stay at a lower oxygen concentration too. Though, in the later parts of the process additional alumina formation should be avoided for the best separation. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E
