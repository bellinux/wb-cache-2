40|$|With the {{escalating}} prevalence of malaria in recent years, artemisinin demand has placed considerable stress on its production worldwide. At present, the relative low­yield of artemisinin (0. 01 ­ 1. 1 %) in the source plant (Artemisia annua L. plant) <b>has</b> <b>imposed</b> <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> limitation in commercializing the drug. Amorpha­ 4, 11 ­diene synthase (ADS) {{has been reported}} a key enzyme in enhancing the artemisinin level in Artemisia annua L. An understanding of the structural and functional correlations of Amorpha­ 4, 11 ­diene synthase (ADS) may therefore, help in the molecular up­regulation of the enzyme. In this context, an in silico approach was used to study the ADS 3963 (3963 bp) gene cloned by us, from high artemisinin (0. 7 ­ 0. 9 % dry wt basis) yielding strain of A. annua L. The full­length putative gene of ADS 3963 was found to encode a protein consisting of 533 amino acid residues with conserved aspartate rich domain. The isoelectric point (pI) and molecular weight of the protein were 5. 25 and 62. 2 kDa, respectively. The phylogenetic analysis of ADS genes from various species revealed evolutionary conservation. Homology modeling method was used for prediction of the 3 D structure of ADS 3963 protein and Autodock 4. 0 version was used to study the ligand binding. The predicted 3 D model and docking studies may further be used in characterizing the protein in wet laboratory...|$|R

40|$|As {{the leading}} cause of deaths worldwide, Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) <b>has</b> <b>imposed</b> <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> burden onto society. Being {{reactive}} in approach, the current healthcare infrastructure struggles to address the problem properly. In contrast, a proactive approach can offer better disease management by predicting impending episodes. The key to the proactive approach is remote continuous monitoring. Traditional long-term monitoring faces serious challenges in transmission as data must be sent out continuously for further processing, leading to short battery life of the sensor node and defying the very notion of continuous monitoring. However, with intelligent signal processing algorithms, signal analysis may directly take place at the sensor node itself. Hence one does not need to transmit data until abnormality is detected. This in turn may save the energy at the sensing node and therefore preserve the notion of continuous monitoring. In this thesis, we first investigate the automated feature detection of Electrocardiogram (ECG) fiducial points by proposing two different algorithms based on time-domain morphology and gradient, as well as time-frequency-domain with Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) respectively. Secondly, to tolerate the possible misdetection errors from ECG fiducial points detection algorithms, we investigate spectral energy as a feature for normal and abnormal ECG classification in feature calculation, as well as statistical analysis of its variation and classification performance under worst-case misdetection. Our exploration shows that spectral energy mostly manages to tackle misdetection error and shows better classification performance than wave duration-based classification. Thirdly, we explore the possibility of adding more time and frequency domain features for enhancing the classification accuracy. Different levels of improvements in classification performance can be observed with respect to the classification models and number of ECG leads involved. Finally, hardware architecture is proposed to integrate spectral energy calculation and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) classifier for an on-body ECG classifier. Verification and power estimation of the system is carried out and shown to be efficient for on-body ECG normal and abnormal classification. <br/...|$|R

40|$|A {{complicated}} and ambitious space mission like Gaia needs a careful {{monitoring and evaluation}} of the functioning of all components of the satellite. This has to be performed on different time scales, by different methods, and on different levels of precision. On the basis of housekeeping data a Quick Look will be performed by the ground segment. A first analyses of the science data quality and consistency will be done by a Science Quick Look. However, due to the nominal scanning law a full self-consistent calibration of the satellite, and a determination of astrometric and global parameters, is not possible before about half <b>a</b> year <b>has</b> elapsed, <b>imposing</b> <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> danger to lose valuable observing time if something goes wrong. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary to perform a Detailed First Look {{on a daily basis}} on the µas accuracy level. We describe two different methods, a block iterative procedure and a direct solution, to monitor all satellite parameters that in principle can be evaluated within a short amount of time, particularly those that can be measured in along-scan direction. This first astrometric analysis would greatly benefit from a modified scanning law (Zero-nu-dot mode) for some time during the commissioning phase. Key words: Gaia; First Look. 1...|$|R
5000|$|During Sri Lanka's tour of Australia in 2007-08 he {{had good}} form with the bat but had an ankle injury which ruled {{him out of}} the rest of the Test series.During the second Test against India on 2 January 2008 Symonds {{completed}} his second Test century, coming to the crease with Australia at 4/119. When Michael Clarke (1) and then Adam Gilchrist (7) were dismissed in quick succession Australia found themselves in poor shape at 6/134. Symonds and Brad Hogg put on a record 7th wicket partnership at the S.C.G (also a record for Australia vs. India) of 173 until Hogg was dismissed for 79. Symonds was the beneficiary of some controversial decisions in the course of his innings. At stumps on the first day, Symonds was not out on 137, and Australia 376/7. By the end of the innings, Symonds finished on 162 not out, when the Australians were finally bowled out for 463. In January 2008, Indian spin bowler Harbhajan Singh received a three-match ban after a complaint that he had racially abused Symonds during the third day of the Second Test at the SCG. It was alleged that Harbhajan called Symonds a [...] "monkey" [...] after Symonds confronted him over touching fellow Australian player Brett Lee. The case was decided by the match referee, Mike Procter, in a hearing held after the match.The BCCI lodged an appeal against the decision. On 29 January 2008, after the hearing of the appeal, at Adelaide by ICC appeals commissioner John Hansen, the racism charge on Harbhajan Singh was not proved and the three Test ban was lifted. However, a lesser charge (Level 2.8 offence) of using abusive language was applied and Harbhajan was fined 50% of his match fee.

The ICC claimed the [...] "database and human errors ... played a part in Harbhajan Singh escaping a more severe penalty during his appeal hearing in Adelaide".Hansen also criticised Symonds in his report accusing him of swearing at Harbhajan after a friendly gesture by the Indian bowler towards Brett Lee. It was also reported that senior players had written a letter to John Hansen requesting a downgrading of the charge. The letter was signed by Sachin Tendulkar and Ricky Ponting and counter-signed by Michael Clarke, Matthew Hayden and Symonds. The stump microphone audio was removed immediately after the alleged incident between Harbhajan Singh and Andrew Symonds was released by Channel Nine.|$|R
