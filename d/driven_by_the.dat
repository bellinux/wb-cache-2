5|$|There {{are three}} {{different}} types of eruptions. The most well-observed are magmatic eruptions, which involve the decompression of gas within magma that propels it forward. Phreatomagmatic eruptions are another type of volcanic eruption, <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> compression of gas within magma, the direct opposite of the process powering magmatic activity. The third eruptive type is the phreatic eruption, which is <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> superheating of steam via contact with magma; these eruptive types often exhibit no magmatic release, instead causing the granulation of existing rock.|$|E
5|$|Argentina, {{which had}} been {{insignificant}} {{during the first half}} of the 19th century, showed growth from the 1860s up until 1930 that was so impressive that it was expected to eventually become the United States of South America. This impressive and sustained economic performance was <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> export of agricultural goods.|$|E
5|$|Flagella are rigid protein structures, about 20nanometres in {{diameter}} and up to 20micrometres in length, that are used for motility. Flagella are <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> energy released by the transfer of ions down an electrochemical gradient across the cell membrane.|$|E

5|$|Phreatic {{eruption}}s (or steam-blast eruptions) are {{a type of}} eruption <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{expansion of}} steam. When cold ground or surface water {{come into contact with}} hot rock or magma it superheats and explodes, fracturing the surrounding rock and thrusting out a mixture of steam, water, ash, volcanic bombs, and volcanic blocks. The distinguishing feature of phreatic explosions is that they only blast out fragments of pre-existing solid rock from the volcanic conduit; no new magma is erupted. Because they are <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> cracking of rock strata under pressure, phreatic activity does not always result in an eruption; if the rock face is strong enough to withstand the explosive force, outright eruptions may not occur, although cracks in the rock will probably develop and weaken it, furthering future eruptions.|$|E
5|$|Spiritualism {{flourished in}} Northern England {{in the nineteenth}} century, in part as a {{backlash}} to the fundamentalist Primitive Methodist movement and in part <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> influence of Owenist socialism.

5|$|Each {{submarine}} {{is equipped}} with three Garden Island-Hedemora HV V18b/15Ub (VB210) 18-cylinder diesel engines, which are each connected to a 1,400kW, 440-volt DC Jeumont-Schneider generator. The combined electrical generation capability of each submarine is 4.2 megawatts. The Hedemora diesels were chosen because of modular construction, which made servicing easier; they could be installed three across in the available space, while other contenders required at least two banks of two; and they had turbochargers <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> exhaust gas. Fifteen fuel tanks are located throughout the submarine: they must be used in specific sequences to preserve the submarine's buoyancy and trim.|$|E
5|$|Estimates of {{the date}} of first {{settlement}} in this area range from 11,500 years ago for a site southwest of the present city to 6,000 years ago at The Forks. In 1805, Canadian colonists observed First Nations peoples engaged in farming activity along the Red River. The practice quickly expanded, <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> demand by traders for provisions. The rivers provided an extensive transportation network linking northern First Peoples with those to the south along the Missouri and Mississippi rivers. The Ojibwe made {{some of the first}} maps on birch bark, which helped fur traders navigate the waterways of the area.|$|E

5|$|For {{internal}} broaching {{the sides of}} the broach are drafted inward so it becomes thinner; for external broaching the sides are drafted outward, to make the pocket bigger. This draft keeps the broach from jamming; the draft must be larger than the angle of misalignment. If the work piece rotates, the broach is pressed against it, is driven by it, and rotates synchronously with it. If the tool holder rotates, the broach is pressed against the workpiece, but is <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> tool holder.|$|E
5|$|In some {{bacteria}} and archaea, ATP synthesis is <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> movement of sodium ions through the cell membrane, {{rather than the}} movement of protons. Archaea such as Methanococcus also contain the A1Ao synthase, a form of the enzyme that contains additional proteins with little similarity in sequence to other bacterial and eukaryotic ATP synthase subunits. It is possible that, in some species, the A1Ao form of the enzyme is a specialized sodium-driven ATP synthase, but {{this might not be}} true in all cases.|$|E

Middlesbrough more than doubled in population from 7600 in 1851 to 19,000 in 1861, and then doubled again to 40,000 in 1871, <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> iron industry.|$|E
5|$|The Congress governments under Reddy placed {{emphasis}} on rural development, agriculture and allied sectors.

Reddy's first term as Chief Minister ended in 1960 after he resigned on being elected President of the Indian National Congress. In 1964, he resigned voluntarily following unfavourable observations made against the Government of Andhra Pradesh by the Supreme Court in the Bus Routes Nationalisation case.|$|E
5|$|The LS3/5A is {{a commercially}} {{produced}} loudspeaker <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{need of the}} BBC to monitor and assess broadcast programme quality. It {{was derived from the}} LS3/5, which was conceived and developed by the BBC Engineering Department in the early 1970s, when it was under the stewardship of Dudley Harwood. Having found no commercially produced small loudspeaker that met the requirement for naturalness and sonic neutrality, the BBC specifically set out to design a speaker to achieve natural overall sound quality and good dynamic range for monitoring broadcasts in tightly confined spaces.|$|E
