5|$|Ferdinand reluctantly ordered saps to be dug <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the mountain. The sapping was {{difficult}} and dangerous and the sappers worked under continuous {{attack from the}} castle's defenders, who fired on them with small arms and the castle's artillery and dropped rocks and debris on their heads. The forced labor of local peasants minimized losses among Ferdinand's own troops, {{but many of the}} peasants perished in the effort.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{outside the}} Malls, in {{the centre of}} Basingstoke's Wote Street stands Willie, the {{heaviest}} sculpture of a male organ on public display in the UK, weighing seven tons. The image of a mother and child is carved <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the sculpture.|$|E

5|$|The Hermitage is a {{small stone}} shelter built <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the gorge, above the river. It was {{designed}} by James Hamilton in the 1770s as a place for ladies to shelter while the men fished in the river.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{managed to}} recover from his morning trouble to post the fourth fastest time in the second Practice Session on Friday afternoon. The Ferraris were still leading, but Massa was fastest, just 0.035 seconds ahead of Räikkönen. However, {{one of the major}} surprises came from Scuderia Toro Rosso, as Scott Speed posted the third quickest time, with Vitantonio Liuzzi posting the fifth quickest time. During the session, Liuzzi was {{involved}} in a bizarre incident with Anthony Davidson; Davidson exited his garage, and smashed his Super Aguri <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> Liuzzi's Toro Rosso; knocking his front wing off in the accident. Alonso finished the second practice session eighth.|$|E
5|$|The castle was rebuilt in {{the late}} 16th century. A new five-storey east range was built <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the rock, and the {{gatehouse}} was rebuilt, {{this time with a}} permanent stone bridge. The upper part of the east range was renovated in 1622, with renaissance details and carving to door and window surrounds. Roslin suffered again from the artillery of Cromwell’s commander in Scotland, General Monck, in 1650. It was further damaged by a Reforming mob in 1688.|$|E

5|$|The {{tower was}} terraced <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> a mound, so the {{northern}} {{side of the}} basement is partially below ground level. As was typical of most keeps, the bottom floor was an undercroft used for storage. One of the rooms contained a well. Although the layout has remained the same since the tower's construction, {{the interior of the}} basement dates mostly from the 18thcentury when the floor was lowered and the pre-existing timber vaults were replaced with brick counterparts. The basement is lit through small slits.|$|E
5|$|In October 1963, London Transport ordered five {{double decker}} buses {{based on the}} Ford Thames Trader chassis for special duties, taking cyclists through the Dartford Tunnel. These had a lower deck {{purpose-built}} for carrying bicycles, with upper deck seats for cyclists. Access was via a stairwell to the upper deck starting several feet above {{the level of the}} road, accessible from special platforms built {{at either end of the}} tunnel; there was also a ladder built <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the bodywork for access elsewhere. The design was criticised for failing to protect any passenger from falling off the vehicle, and running costs were estimated at £2,550 per month, with only £45 revenue. The service was reduced to one bus in April 1964 and then cancelled in 1965, to be replaced by the current transfer service. One of these buses has been preserved.|$|E
5|$|On lap thirty-one, Buemi {{tried to}} pass Glock on the outside heading into turn three but lost control of his car under braking and rammed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> Glock. Buemi {{sustained}} a broken left, front suspension and front wing damage, causing him to retire. The incident called for the race's third safety car period. During the safety car deployment, most of the drivers made pit stops for intermediate tyres. Alonso, who was called in by Ferrari when Vettel changed his strategy, had a pit stop that proved problematic. He arrived into his pit box sideways after locking his tyres. One of his mechanics could not fit his front right wheel because he dropped a wheel nut; he was required to fit a spare wheel nut onto the tyre, causing Alonso to be stationary for longer than usual. He lost third place to Hamilton.|$|E

50|$|Dunn {{was born}} in the coal-mining town of Millerton on the South Island's West Coast. His father was a stone-tunneller who bored <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> hills looking for seams of coal.|$|R

25|$|Hemel {{claims to}} have the first purpose built {{multi-storey}} car park in Britain. Built in 1960 <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> a hill in the Marlowes shopping district, it features a giant humorous mosaic map of the area by the artist Rowland Emett.|$|E
50|$|By the 18th century, candle clocks {{were being}} made with weights set <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> candle. As the candle melted, the weights fell off and made a noise as they fell into a bowl.|$|R
25|$|The tunnels were dug <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> hills, <b>into</b> rock. This {{means that}} {{incomplete}} tunnels remain mostly intact, {{due to the}} strength of the unsupported rock. Completed sections are lined with concrete floors, walls, and ceilings.|$|R
60|$|It was but {{the work}} of a few seconds to drag the sapling to the hole. Then it was lifted upright, so that the end might not dig <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> well and cause a cave-in.|$|R
25|$|On 17 April 2010, ICE 105 Amsterdam - Basel lost a door while {{travelling}} at {{high speed}} near Montabaur. The door slammed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> ICE 612 on the adjacent track. Six people travelling on ICE 612 were injured.|$|E
25|$|Particularly in children, {{another popular}} {{treatment}} choice is midazolam, given <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the mouth or the nose. Sometimes, {{the failure of}} lorazepam alone {{is considered to be}} enough to classify a case of SE as resistant to treatment.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, on {{the morning}} of March 10, a {{southbound}} Rail Runner train struck an abandoned car in the South Valley. On August 18, a northbound train was struck by a car which drove <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the train; the driver was killed.|$|E
50|$|The ancient {{population}} centers such as Chaco Canyon, Mesa Verde, and Bandelier {{for which the}} Ancestral Puebloans are renowned consisted of apartment-like complexes and structures made from stone, adobe mud, and other local material, or were carved <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> canyon walls.|$|R
50|$|Additionally, {{a hunting}} {{breastplate}} may cause the tree points of a poorly fitting saddle to dig <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> horse's withers, creating rubs and great discomfort. In this case, {{it is best}} to get the saddle properly fitted before using a hunting breastplate.|$|R
50|$|The first {{prototype}} of 1933 had a split windscreen, while other prototypes had a one-piece windscreen or even one formed by three separate pieces of glass, with one large central piece and two side parts angled sharply and flowing <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body.|$|R
25|$|In 1955, United Airlines Flight 409 crashed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the mountain; {{there were}} no survivors.

During the recovery process, several additional access routes were established, which are still in use today.|$|E
25|$|The {{ground is}} built <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the gently sloping hill {{on which it}} is located, {{resulting}} in an amphitheatre bowl.

25|$|Flight TE-901 {{took off}} on 29 November 1979.

50|$|Trabuco Canyon was {{the site}} of {{attempts}} to mine tin in the early 1900s. Mining remains from this activity include: tunnels <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> canyon (closed for public safety); the stone foundation of an ore-processing stamp mill; and several dams on the creek.|$|R
