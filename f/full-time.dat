5|$|The {{employer}} mandate requires employers meeting certain {{criteria to}} provide health insurance to their workers. The mandate applies to employers with more than 50 employees that do not offer health insurance to their <b>full-time</b> workers.

Between March 2010 and 2014 the number of part-time jobs declined by 230,000, {{while the number of}} <b>full-time</b> jobs increased by 2 million. In the public sector <b>full-time</b> jobs turned into part-time jobs much more than in the private sector. A 2016 study found only limited evidence that ACA had increased part-time employment.|$|E
