Molecular clocks are frequently used to calibrate phylogeographic analyses, however there is mounting evidence that molecular rates decay over the relevant timescales. It is therefore essential that an appropriate rate is determined, consistent with the temporal scale of the specific analysis. This {{can be achieved by}} using temporally spaced data such as ancient DNA or by relating the divergence of lineages directly to contemporaneous external events of known time. Here we calibrate a Eurasian <b>field</b> <b>vole</b> (Microtus agrestis) mitochondrial genealogy from the well-established series of post-glacial geophysical changes that {{led to the formation of}} the Baltic Sea and the separation of the Scandinavian peninsula from the central <b>European</b> mainland. The <b>field</b> <b>vole</b> exhibits the common phylogeographic pattern of Scandinavian colonization from both the north and the south, however the southernmost of the two relevant lineages appears to have originated in situ on the Scandinavian peninsula, or possibly in the adjacent island of Zealand, around the close of the Younger Dryas. The mitochondrial substitution rate and the timescale for the genealogy are closely consistent with those obtained with a previous calibration, based on the separation of the British Isles from mainland Europe. However the result here is arguably more certain, given the level of confidence that can be placed in one of the central assumptions of the calibration, that <b>field</b> <b>voles</b> could not survive the last glaciation of the southern part of the Scandinavian peninsula.

However, the role of coexisting Ixodes species, such as the widely distributed species Ixodes trianguliceps, as alternative vectors for these pathogens has received little attention. This study aimed to assess the relative {{importance of}} I. ricinus and I. trianguliceps in the transmission of Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Babesia microti among United Kingdom <b>field</b> <b>voles</b> (Microtus agrestis), which serve as reservoir hosts for both pathogens. While all instars of I. trianguliceps feed exclusively on small mammals, I. ricinus adults feed primarily on larger hosts such as deer. The abundance of both tick species and pathogen infection prevalence in <b>field</b> <b>voles</b> were monitored at sites surrounded with fencing that excluded deer and at sites where deer were free to roam. As expected, fencing significantly reduced the larval burden of I. ricinus on <b>field</b> <b>voles</b> and the abundance of questing nymphs, but the larval burden of I. trianguliceps was not significantly affected. The prevalence of A. phagocytophilum and B. microti infections was not significantly affected by the presence of fencing, suggesting that I. trianguliceps is their principal vector. The prevalence of nymphal and adult ticks on <b>field</b> <b>voles</b> was also unaffected, indicating that relatively few non-larval I. ricinus ticks feed upon <b>field</b> <b>voles.</b> This study provides compelling evidence for the importance of I. trianguliceps in maintaining these enzootic tick-borne infections, while highlighting the potential for such infections to escape into alternative hosts via I. ricinus...|$|R

5000|$|The <b>field</b> <b>vole</b> or {{short-tailed vole}} (Microtus agrestis) is a grey-brown vole, around four inches (ten centimetres) in length, {{with a short}} tail.

OPV antibodies (most likely cowpox) were more common but restricted geographically to southeast Finland.

The nature of these impacts on the different species is subject to debate. We live-trapped voles between 2006 and 2009 in 2 commercially harvested forests in south-eastern Norway. We investigated the variation in vole abundance among habitat types (e. g. mature forest and clear-cut) and the hypothesis that graminivorous species such as <b>field</b> <b>voles</b> (Microtus agrestis L.) benefit from clear-cuts {{at the expense of}} forest dwellers (i. e. the bank vole, Myodes glareolus Schreb.), using fine-scale descriptors of the ground vegetation.

We found a positive association between bank vole abundance and bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus L.) availability rather than a specific habitat type. Low <b>field</b> <b>vole</b> density in clear-cuts might be due to variation in local productivity and ground vegetation as well as to large variation in the species temporal dynamics. The latter is particularly associated with the widespread decline of <b>field</b> <b>voles</b> in Scandinavia.

40|$|The {{mating system}} of the Taiwan <b>field</b> <b>vole</b> (Microtus kikuchii) has been {{proposed}} to be monogamous. In monogamous animals, individuals should exhibit monogamy syndromes, such as little sexual dimorphism and strong pair bonding (a strong social preference for a familiar partner versus a strange one). In this study, we examined the effect of cohabitation on the partner preference. In a reciprocal experiment, all test individuals were cohabited with a heterosexual vole for 24 hr prior to the partner preference trials. We collected the feces of voles {{before and after the}} trials, and analyzed the concentration of fecal steroid hormones, including testosterone of males, progesterone and estradiol of females, and corticosterone of all voles. The results showed that the behaviors of focal voles were not influenced by the status (partner or stranger) of stimulus vole. There was no significant relationship between steroid hormones and partner preference. Furthermore, the degree of sexual dimorphism in the Taiwan <b>field</b> <b>vole</b> was low, and {{similar to that of the}} monogamous prairie vole (M. ochrogaster).

Aims: To conduct a large-scale, long-term analysis of pellets regurgitated by Barn Owls collected from a defined area of countryside within the UK south Midlands and compare results with those of other studies that have used pellet analysis to investigate the diet of Barn Owls. Methods: Over 61 000 Barn Owl pellets collected over 20 years in the south Midlands of England were analyzed. Results: We recorded a steady increase in the proportion of <b>Field</b> <b>Voles</b> in pellets over time at the expense of Wood Mice, and a positive relationship between various rainfall measures and the proportion of <b>Field</b> <b>Voles</b> in pellets. We suggest that the conclusions of previous studies of the diet of Barn Owls have often been predicated on inconsistent or untenable assumptions. Conclusion: We challenge some of the premises on which Barn Owl pellet analyses have traditionally been based. We do not think that either a shortage of <b>Field</b> <b>Voles</b> in pellets, or of pellets containing the remains of more, smaller prey items, are indicative of foraging difficulty.

The proportions of Common Vole Microtus arvalis were the only with a significant negative correlation with food niche-breadth (Fig. 2). Common Vole therefore the main prey for the owl. The most important alternate prey species were: <b>Field</b> <b>Vole</b> Microtus agrestis, mice of the genus Apodemus, Common-pine Vole Microtus subterraneus, and Water Vole Arvicola terrestris.

40|$|Sex {{chromosomes}} {{are useful}} in elucidating the evolutionary factors affecting diversity and divergence. In particular, Y chromosome analyses may complement studies using mitochondrial DNA for inferring sex-specific population genetic processes. Y chromosome studies have been scarce due to limited access to genetic markers and the dynamic evolution of Y. Conserved Y-specific primers that could amplify a diverse set of mammalian species were developed from comparison of gametologous X and Y sequences. Y-specific sequence, generally more than one kb, was amplified for all 20 species examined. Intraspecific diversity on mammalian Y {{was found to be}} reduced even when male-biased mutation rate and effective population size were corrected for. A number of factors can cause this low variation on Y of which selection on a haploid chromosome seems most important. The <b>field</b> <b>vole</b> (Microtus agrestis), a common and well-studied small mammal in Eurasia, was examined for X and Y variability. Earlier studies on mtDNA had shown that the <b>field</b> <b>vole</b> is separated in two distinct lineages in Europe.
