40|$|AbstractResistance to the {{neomycin}} analogue G 418 {{forms the}} basis of a <b>dominant</b> <b>marker</b> <b>selection</b> system for mammalian cells transfected with the bacterial neomycin gene. We found that COS- 1 cells stably transfected with the neomycin resistance gene had a greater than 50 % reduction in cell-associated glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) -anchored alkaline phosphatase (AP). A similarly reduced amount of AP was also observed in wild-type COS- 1 cells incubated in the presence of G 418 or other aminoglycoside antibiotics. The AP was released from cells into the culture supernatant in its GPI-anchored form. Our data suggest that the G 418 -induced reduction of AP involves a vesiculation process of COS- 1 cells...|$|E

Total RNA was extracted from human bone marrow, and lactoferrin cDNA was synthesized by primer-specific {{polymerase chain reaction}} after oligo(dT) -primed first-strand synthesis. The cDNA was sequenced to confirm its identity with previously published human lactoferrin sequences and cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pNUT. Recombinant vector DNA containing the human lactoferrin sequence was introduced into baby-hamster kidney (BHK) cells in culture, and stable transfectants were produced by <b>dominant</b> <b>marker</b> <b>selection.</b> Human lactoferrin was expressed from the metallothionein promoter of pNUT by Zn 2 + induction. The protein was secreted into the tissue-culture medium and was subsequently purified to homogeneity in a single step.

40|$|Many {{cell lines}} are {{sensitive}} to growth at low cell density and undergo apoptosis induced by oxidative stress if the cell density is decreased below a critical threshold. In stable transfection experiments this cell density-dependent growth may be the limiting factor, since during drug selection the cell density falls below the critical threshold, precluding outgrowth of transfected clones. We describe here a simple protocol {{for the establishment of}} stably transfected human B cell lines making use of the protective action of antioxidants. The protocol includes: (i) seeding the cells in medium supplemented with sodium pyruvate, alpha-thioglycerol and bathocuproine disulfonate; (ii) delaying the onset of <b>dominant</b> <b>marker</b> <b>selection</b> to improve recovery of the cells after electroporation. Stably transfected clones have thus been obtained from Burkitt's lymphoma lines, which have been regarded as untransfectable. Using this protocol the stable transfection efficiency with episomal plasmids approaches the transient transfection efficiency, indicating that virtually every transfected cell can be established as a stably transfected clone. This protocol should also prove useful for other cell lines, e. g. neuronal cells, having similar sensitivities to oxidative stress...|$|E
30|$|Bacillus subtilis is a {{food-safe}} microorganism, {{which has}} been used to food fermentation {{for a long period of}} time (Song et al. 2015). Several gene expression systems have been developed for high-level production of heterologous proteins such as amylase (Chen et al. 2015 a, b), lysozyme (Zhang et al. 2014), protease (Degering et al. 2010), and lipase (Lu et al. 2010). However, few reports are concerned with application of recombinant B. subtilis directly to food processing. One important reason is that most vectors (mainly based on antibiotics) used in this systems are not food-grade. Food-grade expression systems have been widely developed and investigated for lactic acid bacteria. Such systems require that the resultant strains should only contain materials from food-safe microorganisms, and no antibiotic resistance marker can be utilized. Usually, food-grade <b>selection</b> <b>markers</b> can be classified as <b>dominant</b> <b>markers</b> or complementation markers (de Vos 1999). Compared with <b>dominant</b> <b>markers,</b> <b>selection</b> <b>markers</b> based on complementation do not require supplements in the cultivation medium. In order to develop a food-grade complementation-based system, usually a gene on the host chromosome is mutated or deleted, and a wild type copy is inserted into the expression vector. The alanine racemase gene dal is involved in the conversion of d-alanine and l-alanine (Bron et al. 2002), and d-alanine is not a common ingredient of large-scale fermentation media (Nguyen et al. 2011); the dal gene thus has considerable potential as a food-grade <b>selection</b> <b>marker</b> in B. subtilis.|$|R

The lacL gene, encoding the large subunit of the beta-galactosidases, was fused translationally downstream of the nisin-inducible promoter nisA.

Biochemically transformed cells containing a nonmutated HindIII G fragment proliferated more rapidly in Ca 2 +-deficient media, whereas cells containing a specific deletion within the E 1 b-encoded, 175 -amino-acid (175 R) (19 -kilodalton) T-antigen gene and nontransformed cells grew at a slower rate. Furthermore, transformed cells that did not express the 175 R T antigen and untransformed cells could not replicate their DNA efficiently in low-Ca 2 + medium.

40|$|An {{essential}} {{prerequisite for}} generating a stable helper cell line, which constitutively expresses functional Sendai virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, is {{the expression of}} all three Sendai virus nucleocapsid (NC) proteins, NP, P, and L, simulataneously. Generating a stable helper cell line was accomplished by cotransfecting cell line 293 with all three corresponding viral genes {{under the control of}} cytomegalovirus promoter-enhancer elements. Cotransfection with a <b>dominant</b> selectable <b>marker</b> enabled <b>selection</b> for stably transfected cells. The levels of the expressed P and NP proteins reached up to 1 / 10 th and 1 / 20 th of the protein levels in Sendai virus-infected cells, respectively. The Sendai virus polymerase activity of the coexpressed proteins was demonstrated by an in vivo polymerase assay. The cell clone H 29 gave the strongest signal and produced DI genomes continuously for at least 3 months. This result demonstrates {{that it is possible to}} stably express adequate levels of all three viral NC proteins to form Sendai virus polymerase activity, thereby performing the replication and encapsidation of viral RNA, essential prerequisites for a helper cell line to be competent in producing recombinant viruses...|$|R
40|$|Marine macroalgae play an {{important}} role in marine coastal ecosystems and are widely used as sea vegetation foodstuffs and for industrial purposes. Therefore, there have been increased demands for useful species and varieties of these macroalgae. However, genetic transformation in macroalgae has not yet been established.

We engineered the coding region of the aminoglycoside phosphotransferase gene aph 7 aEuro(3) from Streptomyces hygroscopicus to adapt codon usage of the nuclear genes of P. yezoensis. We designated this codon-optimized aph 7 aEuro(3) gene as PyAph 7. After bombarding P. yezoensis cells with plasmids containing PyAph 7 under the control of their endogenous promoter, 1. 9 thalli (or individuals) of hygromycin-resistant strains were isolated from a 10 -mm square piece of the bombarded thallus.

40|$|The oncogenic {{potential}} of polyomavirus in newborn rats {{could not be}} expressed by a genome encoding only the middle T antigen but required the presence {{of one of the}} other two viral early genes, small T or large T.

The simian virus 40 (cT) - 3 mutant (R. E. Lanford and J. S.

Our data suggested that under the conditions of DNA-mediated tumor induction and cotransfection with a <b>dominant</b> <b>selection</b> <b>marker,</b> the cellular alterations achieved by nonnuclear oncogenes such as polyomavirus small T and simian virus 40 (cT) - 3 were sufficient to complement polyomavirus middle T in transformation and tumorigenesis...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Species of the fungal genus Trichoderma are {{important}} industrial producers of cellulases and hemicellulases, but also widely used as biocontrol agents (BCAs) in agriculture. In the latter function Trichoderma species stimulate plant growth, induce plant defense and directly antagonize plant pathogenic fungi through their mycoparasitic capabilities. The recent {{release of the}} genome sequences of four mycoparasitic Trichoderma species now forms the basis for large-scale genetic manipulations of these important BCAs. Thus far, {{only a limited number}} of <b>dominant</b> <b>selection</b> <b>markers,</b> including Hygromycin B resistance (hph) and the acetamidase-encoding amdS gene, have been available for transformation of Trichoderma spp. For more extensive functional genomics studies the utilization of additional <b>dominant</b> <b>markers</b> will be essential. Results We established the Escherichia coli neomycin phosphotransferase II-encoding nptII gene as a novel selectable marker for the transformation of Trichoderma atroviride conferring geneticin resistance. The nptII marker cassette was stably integrated into the fungal genome and transformants exhibited unaltered phenotypes compared to the wild-type. Co-transformation of T. atroviride with nptII and a constitutively activated version of the Gα subunit-encoding tga 3 gene (tga 3 Q 207 L) resulted in a high number of mitotically stable, geneticin-resistant transformants. Further analyses revealed a co-transformation frequency of 68 % with 15 transformants having additionally integrated tga 3 Q 207 L into their genome. Constitutive activation of the Tga 3 -mediated signaling pathway resulted in increased vegetative growth and an enhanced ability to antagonize plant pathogenic host fungi. Conclusion The neomycin phosphotransferase II-encoding nptII gene from Escherichia coli proved to be a valuable tool for conferring geneticin resistance to the filamentous fungus T. atroviride thereby contributing to an enhanced genetic tractability of these important BCAs. </p...|$|R

Cells resistant to G 418 (a neomycin analog) were cloned and expanded. Transductants retained an undifferentiated phenotype as judged by morphology, tumorigenicity, and cell-surface antigen analyses. Nucleic acid analysis of infectants revealed both Neor-MPSV and F-MuLV proviruses, although no virus was released. G 418 -resistant transductants remained nonpermissive {{for the expression of}} other proviruses and for subsequent superinfection. Northern analysis showed expression of full-length Neor-MPSV, as well as mos-specific subgenomic RNA. mos sequences were deleted from Neor-MPSV (Neor mos- 1), and pseudotypes were used to infect embryonal carcinoma cells. No morphological differences were observed in either mos+ or mos- transductants as compared with parental cell lines. However, mos+ transductants showed an enhanced anchorage-independent growth compared with that of mos- transductants in agar cloning. PCC 4 transductants were induced to differentiate with retinoic acid and superinfected with F-MuLV.

40|$|An IMP {{dehydrogenase}} gene {{was isolated}} from Candida albicans on a approximately 2. 9 -kb XbaI genomic DNA fragment. The putative Candida IMP dehydrogenase gene (IMH 3) encodes a protein of 521 amino acids with extensive sequence similarity to the IMP dehydrogenases of Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{and various other}} organisms. Like the S. cerevisiae IMH 3 sequence characterized in the genome sequencing project, the open reading frame of the C. albicans IMH 3 gene is interrupted by a small intron (248 bp) with typical exon-intron boundaries and a consensus S. cerevisiae branchpoint sequence. IMP dehydrogenase mRNAs are detected in both the yeast and hyphal forms of C. albicans as judged by Northern hybridization. Growth of wild-type (sensitive) C. albicans cells is inhibited at 1 microg of mycophenolic acid (MPA), a specific inhibitor of IMP dehydrogenases, per ml, whereas transformants hosting a plasmid with the IMH 3 gene are resistant to MPA levels of up to at least 40 microg/ml.

The pM 47 plasmid was introduced into T 98 G cells derived from a human glioblastoma multiforme tumor, and a stable clonal cell line, GM 47. 23, was derived that conditionally expressed wt-p 53 following exposure to dexamethasone. We show that induction of wt-p 53 expression in exponentially growing cells inhibits cell cycle progression and that the inhibitory effect is reversible upon removal of the inducer or infection with simian virus 40. Moreover, when growth-arrested cells are stimulated to proliferate, induction of wt-p 53 expression inhibits G 0 /G 1 progression into S phase and the cells accumulate with a DNA content equivalent to cells arrested in the G 0 /G 1 phase of the cell cycle. Taken together, these studies suggest that wt-p 53 may play a negative role in growth regulation...|$|R
40|$|In most {{experimental}} {{gene therapy}} protocols involving stem/progenitor cells, {{only a small}} fraction of cells, often therapeutically inadequate, can be transduced and express the therapeutic gene. A promising strategy for overcoming this problem is the use of a <b>dominant</b> <b>selection</b> <b>marker,</b> such as a drug-resistance gene. In this paper, we have explored the potential of the heavy subunit of gamma-glutamyl cysteine synthetase (gamma-GCSh) to act as a <b>selection</b> <b>marker.</b> We found that 3 T 3 fibroblasts transduced with a bicistronic retroviral vector, coding for gamma-GCSh and the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP), were highly resistant to L-buthionine-S,R-sulfoximine (BSO), a gamma-GCS inhibitor with a very low clinical toxicity profile. The level of resistance was not proportional to the increase in intracellular glutathione. In fact, cells overexpressing both heavy and light gamma-GCS subunits had higher intracellular GSH levels, and a lower level of resistance to the cytotoxic activity of BSO compared to cells overexpressing gamma-GCSh alone. 3 T 3 fibroblasts overexpressing gamma-GCSh could be selected from cultures containing both naïve and gene-modified cells by application of exogenous BSO selection pressure for 4 days. Also primary neural stem/progenitor cells derived from the lateral ventricles of mouse neonatal brains and primary hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells from mouse bone marrow, transduced with the gamma-GCSh-eGFP vector, could be selected by BSO treatment in vitro. These results provide proof-of-principle that neural and hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, transduced with a potentially curative gene and co-expressing the simultaneously transduced gamma-GCSh gene, can be selected by treatment with BSO...|$|R

We have used Cre-mediated recombination of LoxP sites in embryonic stem cells and mice to generate a 550 -kb deletion encompassing 16 of these genes in the corresponding region on mouse chromosome 16. Mice heterozygous for this deletion are normal and do not exhibit cardiovascular abnormalities. Because mice with a larger deletion on mouse chromosome 16 do have heart defects, the results allow us to exclude these 16 genes as being solely, or in combination among themselves, responsible for the cardiovascular abnormalities in velocardiofacial/DiGeorge syndrome. We also generated mice with a duplication of the 16 genes that may help dissect the genetic basis of “cat eye” and derivative 22 syndromes that are characterized by extra copies of portions of 22 q 11, including these 16 genes.

To circumvent this problem, we proposed a new method for estimating the recombination fraction between markers, which greatly improves the accuracy of estimation through distinction between the coupling phase and the repulsion phase of the linked loci. The results obtained from both real and simulated F 2 <b>dominant</b> <b>marker</b> data indicate that the recombination fractions estimated by the new method contain a large amount of linkage information for constructing a complete linkage map. In addition, the new method is also applicable to data with mixed types of <b>markers</b> (<b>dominant</b> and codominant) with unknown linkage phase...|$|R
40|$|Linkage of RAPD markers with loci {{involved}} in partial resistance to Fusarium in Asiatic hybrid lilies was investigated. Variation in resistance {{was found in}} two greenhouse tests using scale bulblets of 150 descendants of a backcross population. The progeny did not show a clear Mendelian segregation in Fusarium resistance. Three out of 213 RAPD markers were significantly (p < 0. 005) linked to Fusarium resistance explaining approximately 24 {{percent of the total}} phenotypic variance of the resistance. The construction of a genetic map with all RAPD markers was hampered because of different segregation types due to the <b>dominant</b> <b>marker</b> system and the low number of descendants evaluated per RAPD marker. Genomic regions, where Fusarium resistance loci were calculated to be linked to markers, were constructed. The use of RAPD <b>markers</b> for <b>selection</b> of quantitative traits and construction of linkage maps is discussed...|$|R

40|$|Composite {{interval}} mapping (CIM) is {{the most}} commonly used method for mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL) with populations derived from biparental crosses. However, the algorithm implemented in the popular QTL Cartographer software may not completely ensure all its advantageous properties. In addition, different background <b>marker</b> <b>selection</b> methods may give very different mapping results, {{and the nature of the}} preferred method is not clear. A modified algorithm called inclusive composite interval mapping (ICIM) is proposed in this article. In ICIM, <b>marker</b> <b>selection</b> is conducted only once through stepwise regression by considering all marker information simultaneously, and the phenotypic values are then adjusted by all markers retained in the regression equation except the two markers flanking the current mapping interval. The adjusted phenotypic values are finally used in interval mapping (IM). The modified algorithm has a simpler form than that used in CIM, but a faster convergence speed. ICIM retains all advantages of CIM over IM and avoids the possible increase of sampling variance and the complicated background <b>marker</b> <b>selection</b> process in CIM. Extensive simulations using two genomes and various genetic models indicated that ICIM has increased detection power, a reduced false detection rate, and less biased estimates of QTL effects...|$|R
