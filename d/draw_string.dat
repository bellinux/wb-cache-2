25|$|In March a new U.S. Army {{combat uniform}} {{that takes into}} {{consideration}} fit requirements of female soldiers (the Army Combat Uniform-Alternate, known as ACU-A) was approved for use by both men and women. The new uniform is wider in the hips and backside and has elastic around the waistband instead of a <b>draw</b> <b>string,</b> as well as adjusted pockets and elbow-pad and knee-pad inserts and shortened crotch length. The rank and name plate were also repositioned on the uniform jacket. The new uniform also has slimmer shoulders, a longer coat, and buttons that replace the Velcro pockets.|$|E
60|$|First he {{drew the}} larger bag over Numa's head and secured it about his neck with the <b>draw</b> <b>string,</b> then he managed, after {{considerable}} effort, during which he barely escaped being torn to ribbons by the mighty talons, to hog-tie Numa--drawing his four legs together and securing them in that position with the strips trimmed from the pigskins.|$|E
60|$|Fore and aft the archers {{had cleared}} the galleys' decks, but {{from either side}} the rovers had poured down into the waist, where the seamen and bowmen were pushed back and so mingled with their foes that it was {{impossible}} for their comrades above to <b>draw</b> <b>string</b> to help them. It was a wild chaos where axe and sword rose and fell, while Englishman, Norman, and Italian staggered and reeled on a deck which was cumbered with bodies and slippery with blood. The clang of blows, the cries of the stricken, the short, deep shout of the islanders, and the fierce whoops of the rovers, rose together in a deafening tumult, while the breath of the panting men went up in the wintry air like the smoke from a furnace. The giant Tete-noire, towering above his fellows and clad from head to foot in plate of proof, led on his boarders, waving a huge mace in the air, with which he struck to the deck every man who approached him. On the other side, Spade-beard, a dwarf in height, but of great breadth of shoulder and length of arm, had cut a road almost to the mast, with three-score Genoese men-at-arms close at his heels. Between these two formidable assailants the seamen were being slowly wedged more closely together, until they stood back to back under the mast with the rovers raging upon every side of them.|$|E

50|$|Typically, long nets {{are placed}} around burrows {{so that a}} bolting rabbit (that is, one leaving its burrow while being chased by a ferret or other animal) will become ensnared, {{allowing}} the hunter to dispatch it. Another method {{is to use a}} purse net, which is a net with a <b>draw</b> <b>string</b> at the opening. This net is placed over the burrow, so that when the rabbit bolts, it will run into the net and cause the <b>draw</b> <b>string</b> to pull the net shut.|$|E

5000|$|A {{drawstring}} (<b>draw</b> <b>string,</b> draw-string) is a , , lace, or rope used to [...] "" [...] (gather, or shorten) fabric {{or other}} material. The {{ends of the}} drawstring may be tied {{to hold it in}} place (and/or simultaneously close an opening). Alternately, the drawstring may be kept drawn using a cordlock. Typically, the drawstring is loose when not being used, and tightened when needed during use.|$|E
5000|$|In a crossbow, {{the limbs}} of the bow, called a prod, are {{attached}} {{at right angles}} to a crosspiece or stock in order to allow for mechanical pulling and holding of the string.

A crossbow shoots a [...] "bolt" [...] or [...] "quarrel", rather than an arrow.|$|R
60|$|This done Tarzan busied himself {{fitting the}} other bags, one over each of Numa's formidably armed paws. Those on the hind feet he secured {{not only by}} {{tightening}} the <b>draw</b> <b>strings</b> but also rigged garters that fastened tightly around the legs above the hocks. He secured the front-feet bags in place similarly above the great knees. Now, indeed, was Numa, the lion, reduced to the harmlessness of Bara, the deer.|$|R
60|$|By now Numa {{was showing}} signs of {{returning}} life. He gasped for breath and struggled; but the strips of pigskin that held his four legs together were numerous and tough. Tarzan watched and was sure that they would hold, yet Numa is mightily muscled {{and there was the}} chance, always, that he might struggle free of his bonds after which all would depend upon the efficacy of Tarzan's bags and <b>draw</b> <b>strings.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The basic combat {{clothing}} was a flocked cotton over nylon. There {{are many different}} variations on the Canadian combat shirt (tunic); one was a simple button up with FN magazine type pockets, another made of a heavier material (for cold weather) and had a zipper in place of buttons with the same pocket style but without dividers for FNC1A1 magazines, and the cadet combats that was made of a lighter material then to both and had different pockets arrangement and size as well as no draw strings. The combat jacket was of heavy cotton while the arctic jacket had a nylon shell. Both the combat shirt and the jackets had two lower cargo pockets with inserts that could hold 3 FNC1A1 20 round magazines each. The upper 2 pockets were angled inward and could hold 1 FNC1A1 magazine each. The combat shirts also have one inner pocket that was held closed by velcro and was clearly visible by an outline of thread on the outer {{right side of the}} shirt. Both the jackets and combat shirts have draw strings on the bottom {{and in the middle of}} the shirt, these were there to prevent debris and winds from entering the shirt as well as to prevent billowing during para jumping. Combat pants have buttons on every belt loop, this was if the pants were to large you could button over to the next button to make them smaller. Combat pants also had [...] "blousers" [...] which were tucked into the boots and the <b>draw</b> <b>string</b> on the bottom of the pant leg with be tightened around the top of the boot to keep out foreign objects and pests. Often the [...] "blousers" [...] were ripped out of the pant leg and used as toilet paper.|$|E

Based on the historical reconstruction in Francois Denis's definitive monograph, Traite de Lutherie, using straightedge and compass constructions, the software can enhance insights into techniques of eighteenth-century design, provide an archival format for describing the properties of string instrument outlines, and the instructions for generating highly accurate digital drawings for use in construction. Further, it can provide {{the foundation for a}} kind of computational art history, where the language and associated software serve as a descriptive tool for analyzing the evolution of instrument designs over time. This work will be integrated with ongoing, active experience constructing violoncellos, connecting the historical and conceptual with the practical...|$|E
40|$|Each sailor is {{expected}} to keep his clothing in good repair. Perhaps when he is sewing up a rent in his trousers or darning his socks he appreciates {{more than ever before}} the nimble fingers and loving heart of mother at home. It is needless to say that mother would be more than glad to be able to perform these little services for her boy at sea. Very likely she has provided him with a "comfort bag" for his use at sea. These "comfort bags" were made for our soldiers and marines {{under the supervision of the}} Red Cross Society and other organizations. The bags were made of washable material, measuring 10 to 13 inches with a <b>draw</b> <b>string</b> at the top. They contained as many as possible of the following articles : Khaki colored sewing cotton No. 30; white sewing cotton No. 30; gray darning cotton; package of needles No. 5; darning needle; needle case; buttons, black and white, medium size, in bag 3 by 5 inches; large thimble; blunt pointed scissors; soap; safety pins, medium size; common pins; small comb; tooth brush; small, round mirror; handkerchief; lead pencil; writing pad; envelopes; post cards; pocket knife; shoe laces. The Navy League supervised the making of other articles for the comfort of the sea men. These w ere sweaters, helmets, mufflers and wristlets knitted of gray yarn. Units of this league were formed all over the United States. These units gave out the knitting material to all women who would knit for the soldiers at sea. If women could not go to war, they could at least do their bit at home as long as the Navy League, Red Cross and other organizations were in need of articles which would add to the comfort of the soldiers...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we studied the failure cause of {{two types of}} piano strings. The {{numerous}} problems which {{make it difficult to}} quantify the string life are systematically analyzed. The strings in question, made of spring steel (cold drawn wires with different thickness), are bass strings and acute strings of a piano concert. SEM analysis and Energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDS) were made. Related questions were taken into account: the connection of the string at the ‘‘tuning pin’’; string wear produced in its anchor point ‘‘agraffe’’; the bending in the compression points; the environment where the piano is located, the relative humidity and the strings corrosion phenomena that might trigger stress-corrosion cracking; the surface finish of the cold <b>drawn</b> <b>string.</b> Besides these factors, it is necessary to consider the different tuning performed on a concert grand piano...|$|R

Wire twist ties are {{sometimes}} supplied for closing the bag once full. Varying thicknesses are commonly manufactured - thicker bags are used for heavy duty applications such as construction waste, or {{in order to be able}} to withstand being compacted during recycling processes. In the mid-1990s bin bags with <b>draw</b> <b>strings</b> for closure were introduced. Some bags have handles which may be tied, or holes through which the neck of the bag can be pulled. Most commonly, the plastic used to make bin bags is the rather soft and flexible LDPE (Low Density Polyethylene) or, for strength, LLDPE (Linear Low Density Polyethylene) or HDPE (High Density Polyethylene) are sometimes used.|$|R
