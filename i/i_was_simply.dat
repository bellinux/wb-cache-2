25|$|I {{think in}} casual {{conversation}} I {{would have told}} anybody I wanted to direct. At the same time I knew Hollywood was a closed off place... It was much harder to get in. To be an older director was a very positive thing. It meant you had survived, knew your way, could make things and make them meet your economic responsibilities. It was always paramount in studio minds, especially in those days... If I was going to direct I was going to write my way in. No TV, no play, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> somebody who said I have a sensibility, I think I can do this, based on nothing other than my scripts basically.|$|E
500|$|An inexperienced Jennings had a {{hard time}} keeping up with his rivals at the other networks, and he – and the upstart ABC News – could not compete with the venerable newscasts of Walter Cronkite at CBS and Chet Huntley and David Brinkley at NBC. Some in the American {{audience}} disliked Jennings' Canadian accent. He pronounced lieutenant as [...] "leftenant", mangled the pronunciation of [...] "Appomattox," [...] and misidentified the [...] "Marines' Hymn" [...] as [...] "Anchors Aweigh" [...] at Lyndon Johnson's presidential inauguration; his lack of in-depth knowledge of American affairs and culture led critics to deride Jennings as a [...] "glamorcaster". [...] "It was a little ridiculous when you think about it," [...] he later reflected. [...] "A 26-year-old trying to compete with Cronkite, Huntley and Brinkley. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> unqualified. After three rocky years at the anchor desk, Jennings quit to become a foreign correspondent.|$|E
500|$|The second commandant of Treblinka II, Franz Stangl, {{escaped with}} his wife and {{children}} from Austria to Brazil in 1951. Stangl found work at a Volkswagen factory in São Paulo. His role in the mass murder of Jews was known to the Austrian authorities, but Austria did not issue a warrant for his arrest until 1961. Stangl was registered under his real name at the Austrian consulate in Brazil. It took another six years before the famous Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal tracked him down and triggered his arrest. After his extradition from Brazil to West Germany Stangl was tried for the deaths of around 900,000 people. He admitted to the killings but argued: [...] "My conscience is clear. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> doing my duty." [...] Stangl was found guilty on 22 October 1970, and sentenced to life imprisonment. He died of heart failure in prison in Düsseldorf on 28 June 1971.|$|E

500|$|His {{resignation}} {{was announced}} amid {{an outpouring of}} appreciation from politicians and naval comrades. Battenberg had written to Churchill on 28 October, [...] "What I shd value above all else is {{to be admitted to}} the Privy Council." [...] The King later swore Louis in as a Privy Councillor in a public show of support. Labour party politician and trade union leader J. H. Thomas wrote to The Times: [...] "I desire to express my extreme regret at the announcement that Prince Louis of Battenberg has, by his resignation, pandered to the most mean and contemptible slander I have ever known ... <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> astounded to hear the base suggestions and rumours current, and I am afraid that his action will simply be looked upon as a triumph for the mean and miserable section of people, who, at a time of national trial, is ever ready to pass a foul lie from lip to lip without a tittle of evidence." [...] Admiral of the Fleet Lord John Hay thought that the [...] "ingeniously propagated lies" [...] originated from Germany.|$|E
500|$|The Spanish {{media has}} often {{compared}} Villa with Raúl, {{to the point}} where Villa was accused of taking the number 7 jersey away from the then-Real Madrid player. In March 2009, Villa spoke out, saying, [...] "I have not taken anything away from anybody, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> playing well for my club and the national coach gave me an opportunity. Too much has been said about the number issue. I’m not looking to cause any controversy. In fact, Raúl and I were in the national squad together in the past. I haven’t forced anybody out." [...] When questioned on whether the whole uproar created over Raúl's omission was affecting him personally, he said, [...] "I've never liked it because I think it has been damaging for the both of us. We've always got on well together whenever we've met up for international duty, so I'm not concerned. I just work hard for myself. All I want is to be in the squad for every game, to have the Spain badge on my chest and to score as many goals as I can." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} by {{television}} critics were positive, with Kevin McFarland of The A.V. Club calling it [...] "an episode of Family Guy that rewards every viewer who liked the show in the past." [...] McFarland also gave high praise to the episode, writing, [...] "At first, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> pleased that 'Back to the Pilot' didn't screw things up at the beginning, but as the episode went, I kept looking at the clock and being amazed that it hadn't dropped the ball yet. It used short cutaways and a plethora of self-referential jokes the writers must have stockpiled for years about the animation quality, voice quality, {{and structure of the}} pilot to every possible advantage." [...] He continued, [...] "It wasn't perfect {{by any stretch of the}} imagination, and it's not on the same level as the occasional brilliance that South Park reaches on about one occasion per season nowadays, but it's the most fun I've had watching the show that didn't involve a Star Wars parody in many years." [...] McFarland concluded his review by giving the episode a grade of A-. Kate Moon of TV Fanatic also enjoyed the episode, noting, [...] "'Back to the Pilot' was a great meta episode of Family Guy. From poking fun at its own flaws in the original series to acknowledging how silly the cutaway gags can be, Family Guy shone at its layered best tonight." [...] She continued, [...] "Treating its animated characters like real actors was a nice touch as well. [...] Watching the original family showed how much the characters evolved and changed throughout the series' long run." [...] Moon concluded her review by giving the episode a 4.2 out of 5. Tom Eames of entertainment website Digital Spy placed the episode at number two on his listing of the best Family Guy episodes in order of [...] "yukyukyuks" [...] and described the episode as [...] "pure genius". He added, [...] "Not only was the episode hilarious with amazing Brian and Stewie moments, but it was genuinely quite clever in the time-travel stakes, which is impressive on a nerd level." ...|$|E

2500|$|Later, Williams stated his analogy was [...] "extreme – {{but it was}} to make a point", and [...] "Some of us {{have strong}} {{opinions}} and are often misunderstood... <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> trying to explain how stupid it seemed to me – how ludicrous that pairing was. They're polar opposites, and it made no sense. They don't see eye-to-eye and never will." ...|$|E
2500|$|Troubled by new acts he {{felt were}} imitating Radiohead, Yorke {{believed}} his music had {{become part of}} a constant background noise he described as [...] "fridge buzz", and became hostile to the music media. He told The Guardian: [...] "I always used to use music as a way of moving on and dealing with things, and I sort of felt like that the thing that helped me deal with things had been sold to the highest bidder and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> doing its bidding. And I couldn't handle that." [...] He suffered from writer's block, and could not finish writing songs on guitar.|$|E
2500|$|Starting on August 3, 1948, during further HUAC hearings, Bentley {{received}} corroboration from Whittaker Chambers, who, under subpoena by HUAC, {{testified that}} he knew at lest two of Bentley contacts, Victor Perlo and Charles Kramer as communists and members of his earlier Ware Group. He also supported her charge that Harry Dexter White, a prominent economist who {{had worked in the}} Treasury Department, was a Communist sympathizer. [...] Of his testimony compared to hers, Chambers wrote in his memoir: [...] I knew that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> back-stopping Miss Bentley, that hers was the current testimony. [...] The things that I had to tell were ten years old and I had only to let the shadows, dust and cobwebs conspicuously drape them to leave the stand unscathed.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the wake}} of the Supreme Court {{decision}} Snyder v. Phelps, which held that the Westboro Baptist Church had the right to picket the funerals of dead soldiers on a public sidewalk, Palin asserted that the Court held a double standard for the WBC's speech, as opposed to other religious speech. On March 2, 2011, she tweeted: [...] "Common sense & decency absent as wacko 'church' allowed hate msgs spewed@ soldiers' funerals but we can't invoke God's name in public square" [...] Palin clarified her tweet the next day: [...] "Obviously my comment meant that when we’re told we can’t say ‘God bless you’ in graduation speeches or pray before a local football game but these wackos can invoke God’s name in their hate speech while picketing our military funerals, it shows ridiculous inconsistency. I wasn’t calling for any limit on free speech, and it’s a shame some folks tried to twist my comment in that way. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> pointing out the irony of an often selective interpretation of free speech rights.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Wills was {{reported}} to be introverted and detached. On court, she rarely showed emotion, ignored her opponents, and took no notice of the crowd. Kitty McKane Godfree, who in 1924 inflicted the only defeat Wills suffered at Wimbledon during her career, said, [...] "Helen was a very private person, and she didn't really make friends very much." [...] Hazel Hotchkiss Wightman said, [...] "Helen was really an unconfident and [...] awkward girl—you have no idea how awkward.... I thought of Helen as an honestly shy person who was bewildered by how difficult it was to please most people." [...] Because of her unchanging expression, Grantland Rice, the American sportswriter, bestowed on Wills the nickname [...] "Little Miss Poker Face". As her success and, ironically, unpopularity with the public increased, she was called [...] "Queen Helen" [...] and [...] "the Imperial Helen". In her own defense, Wills said in her autobiography, [...] "I had one thought and that was to put the ball across the net. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> myself, too deeply concentrated on the game for any extraneous thought." ...|$|E
