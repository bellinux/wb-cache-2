5|$|The Judge {{was always}} {{headline}} news. He {{was a great}} showman, theatrical in appearance, with his sharp jaw and shock of white hair, and people always crowded into his courtroom, <b>knowing</b> <b>there</b> would be something going on. There were few dull moments.|$|E
25|$|<b>Knowing</b> <b>there</b> was {{demand for}} a Ford-built tractor, a group of {{entrepreneurs}} in Minneapolis organized The Ford Tractor Company, paying a company clerk surnamed Ford {{for the use of}} his name, with the intention of getting sales and attention from the confusion of this Ford with Ford Motor Company. The company built and sold some tractors, but anticipated a settlement with Henry Ford for permission to use their already-trademarked name. However, Ford thwarted them by using another name.|$|E
25|$|<b>Knowing</b> <b>there</b> was a {{good chance}} he would be chosen in the first round, Randolph {{declared}} himself eligible for the 2008 NBA draft {{at the end of}} his freshman year at LSU. Some projected Randolph to go high in the year's draft because of his versatility and potential, while his detractors thought he might drop because of his thin frame and raw overall game. In either case, many believed Randolph could be the steal of the draft with his talent and tremendous potential.|$|E
5000|$|The {{song was}} one of Duane Allman's last {{recorded}} performances with the band. [...] "As I mixed songs like [...] "Blue Sky," [...] I knew, of course, that I {{was listening to the}} last things that Duane ever played and there was just such a mix of beauty and sadness, <b>knowing</b> <b>there's</b> {{not going to be any}} more from him," [...] said Johnny Sandlin.|$|R

5000|$|According to Shannon Larkin, {{the song}} is about the band's {{continued}} belief in a higher power. [...] "The song is about <b>knowing</b> <b>there's</b> something out there, whatever God you believe in. But some kind of power that shines down on you and helps you face {{the next day or}} whatever." [...] Shannon Larkin said. Later Sully Erna added that {{the song is}} not about the God that religions talk about.|$|R
25|$|In May 2014 the NHTSA fined {{the company}} $35 million {{for failing to}} recall cars with faulty {{ignition}} switches for a decade, despite <b>knowing</b> <b>there</b> {{was a problem with}} the switches. General Motors paid compensation for 124 deaths linked to the faulty switches. The $35 million fine was the maximum the regulator could impose. General Motors has announced that they are also facing 79 customer lawsuits asking for as much as $10 billion for economic losses attributed to the recall. As well as the Cobalts, the switches of concern had been installed in many other cars, such as the Pontiac G5, the Saturn Ion, the Chevrolet HHR, the Saturn Sky, and Pontiac Solstice. Eventually the recall involved about 2.6 million GM cars worldwide.|$|E
25|$|By early 1945 it {{was clear}} that the price {{controls}} which had been introduced to control inflation had only served to boost the black market and prices continued to move ever upwards. By this time the army had swelled to over 1.2 million men and almost half of state expenditure was going to military spending. De Gaulle was faced with his first major ministerial dispute when the very able but tough-minded economics minister Pierre Mendès France demanded a programme of severe monetary reform which was opposed by the Finance Ministry headed by Aime Lepercq, who favoured a programme of heavy borrowing to stimulate the economy. When de Gaulle, <b>knowing</b> <b>there</b> would be little appetite for further austerity measures sided with Lepercq, Mendès France tendered his resignation, which was rejected because de Gaulle knew he needed him. Lepercq was killed in a road accident a short time afterwards and was succeeded by Pleven, but when in March, Mendès France asked unsuccessfully for taxes on capital earnings and for the blocking of certain bank accounts, he again offered his resignation and it was accepted.|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{provision}} of the Mint Act of 1837 entrusting Longacre, {{by virtue of his}} office, with responsibility for preparing dies, Peale prepared his own and ran off some sample three-cent pieces. [...] Both types of pattern coin were sent by Patterson to Corwin on March 25, 1851, with the Mint director's recommendation that the chief engraver's design be selected. [...] The next day, acting Treasury Secretary William L. Hodge approved Longacre's design. <b>Knowing</b> <b>there</b> was a large demand for the new coins, Patterson thought it best to build up a stock of 500,000 before beginning distribution.|$|E
5000|$|His {{final game}} for LSU was the Capital One Bowl against Penn State on January 1, 2010. As he {{prepared}} to play in his final game for the Tiger, Alexander told The Times-Picayune, [...] "Finally, I {{see the end of}} the tunnel. Nothing ever lasts forever. I've loved every minute of it. My teammates are like my brothers, and now I'm trying to enjoy every moment <b>knowing</b> <b>there's</b> only a couple of days left." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Shine Down" [...] {{was another}} example of the band {{wrenching}} light from dark. [...] "That one's not just a song of hope, but of realistic expectations," [...] explains Erna. [...] "It's about being human and having problems. About not being able to lift your head off the pillow, but <b>knowing</b> <b>there's</b> somebody out there that watches over us and a universe that protects us. I knew this new year would be rocking for us. It's not religious, but spiritual." ...|$|R

[...] "However, <b>knowing</b> <b>there's</b> no use trying to fool you, I'll {{give you a}} fair warning and come straight to something I may as well say now as later. Savine will go down like {{a house of cards}} some day, and those who lean upon him will find it, in our language, frosty weather. Now, suppose we made you a fair offer, would you join us?" ...|$|R
500|$|That neighbor, {{a school}} bus driver {{returning}} home, noticed the young woman was not bleeding or visibly injured, but cold and shivering. He offered to telephone for help. She asked him not {{to call the police}} (one police report says [...] "pleaded") and assured him she'd already called AAA. (AAA has no record of any such call.) <b>Knowing</b> <b>there</b> was no cellular reception in the area, the bus driver continued home and called the police. His call was received by the Sheriff's Department at 7:43 pm. He was unable to see Murray's car while he made the phone call but did notice several cars pass on the road before the police arrived. Another local resident driving home from work claims she passed by the scene around 7:37 pm, and saw a police SUV parked face-to-face with Murray's car. She pulled over briefly and did not see anyone inside or outside the cars, and decided to continue home. This witness's claim contradicts the official police log, which has Haverhill police arriving nine minutes later.|$|E
500|$|The band made {{extensive}} use of the different rooms and acoustics in the house. The vocals on [...] "Exit Music (For a Film)" [...] feature natural reverberation achieved by recording on a stone staircase, and [...] "Let Down" [...] was recorded in a ballroom at 3 a.m. Isolation allowed the band {{to work at a}} different pace, with more flexible and spontaneous working hours. O'Brien said that [...] "the biggest pressure was actually completing [...] We weren't given any deadlines and we had complete freedom to do what we wanted. We were delaying it because we were a bit frightened of actually finishing stuff." [...] Yorke was satisfied with the quality of the recordings made at the location, and enjoyed working without audio separation, meaning that instruments were not overdubbed separately. O'Brien was similarly pleased with the recordings, estimating that 80 per cent of the album was recorded live, and said: [...] "I hate doing overdubs, because it just doesn't feel natural.... Something special happens when you're playing live; {{a lot of it is}} just looking at one another and <b>knowing</b> <b>there</b> are four other people making it happen." [...] Many of Yorke's vocals were first takes; he felt that if he made other attempts he would [...] "start to think about it and it would sound really lame." ...|$|E
500|$|Set {{prior to}} most of the film's action, [...] "Part of Your World" [...] is the second proper song in The Little Mermaid, and takes place in Ariel's grotto before she meets Eric. A {{character}} song used to progress the plot, [...] "Part of Your World" [...] resembles a monologue in which Ariel expresses her desire {{to become part of the}} human world while reveling in her expansive collection of discarded human items and artifacts. Singing about her interest in exploring the human world and learning as much as she can about it, Ariel performs the ballad while gazing up towards the surface longingly, wishing that she could be human herself and live among other humans. [...] "Part of Your World" [...] reveals that Ariel feels repressed and unhappy in her current environment despite her belongings and royal lineage, [...] "want to be a part of something else." [...] A wind-up toy resembling a woman dancing is used to demonstrate that Ariel would much rather be like her. The character also sings the line [...] "What’s a fire and why does it ... What’s the word? Burn!” to Georges de La Tour's painting Magdalene with the Smoking Flame to indicate a similar sentiment. Offering character development, the song explores and voices the inner goings-on of Ariel's mind. Ariel's craving for adventure makes it difficult for the character to enjoy her current surroundings while <b>knowing</b> <b>there</b> is much left for her to explore, causing her to grow increasingly despondent; [...] "change", a non-physical concept that can not be purchased or stolen, is the only thing that could make her truly happy. In the meantime, Ariel uses material belongings to fill the void of what is missing from her life, attempting to live among humans vicariously via what she has salvaged from sunken ships. Voicing her frustration over being confined to the ocean, Ariel is not shy about what she wants, choosing to belt out her desires instead. The Animated Movie Guide author Jerry Beck wrote that the song [...] "capture's Ariel's yearning so intensely that when she extends her hand toward the surface we long to reach out with her", ending with Ariel gesturing while sighing longingly and descending back down to the ocean floor.|$|E

2500|$|Brett was aged two (1948) {{before her}} parents were able to leave Germany and emigrate to Melbourne, Australia. She later {{recalled}} [...] "I grew up in North Carlton <b>knowing</b> <b>there</b> had been a catastrophe, but my parents revealed only odd fragments. Then I started reading about the Holocaust and have never stopped." [...] Her younger sister, Doris Brett, was born in 1950, she later became a clinical psychologist and writer. Rosa worked [...] "behind a sewing machine in a factory." [...] Brett attended University High School, Melbourne but did not matriculate – instead of sitting two of her final exams she watched Hitchcock's Psycho.|$|E
2500|$|In 2013, Hillary Clinton, former United States Secretary of State, {{took part}} in the {{academic}} celebration marking the 600th anniversary of the founding of the University of St Andrews. Clinton received an honorary degree of Doctor of Laws and provided the graduation address, in which she said, [...] "I do take comfort from <b>knowing</b> <b>there</b> is a long tradition of Americans being warmly welcomed here at St Andrews. Every year I learn you educate more than one thousand American students, exposing them to new ideas and perspectives as well as according them with a first class education. I’ve been proud and fortunate to hire a few St Andrews alumni over the years and I thank you for training them so well." ...|$|E
2500|$|Punk band Dropkick Murphys {{covered the}} song for their 2017 album 11 Short Stories of Pain & Glory. Vocalist/bassist Ken Casey {{said in a}} December 2016 {{interview}} discussing the reason behind their version. [...] "As you may know, opiate overdoses are an epidemic in America now particularly in (the Boston) area. I've been to thirty wakes in two years, three this week, one being my cousin, Al's lost a brother in law. It's hit home close to us. I was leaving one of the wakes and this song came on and as I {{was listening to the}} lyrics it summed up exactly how I was feeling. Sad, but <b>knowing</b> <b>there</b> is hope.

2500|$|In August 1659, King's party {{addressed}} {{themselves to}} Col. Lambert through his wife, endeavoring {{to persuade her}} to solicit her husband to be the instrument of the Kings return, with large land offers of whatsoever terms he would demand. [...] "She acquainted the colonel with their propositions; but he having resolved to play another part, discovered the whole intrigue to Henry Vane the Younger, who having communicated it to Sir. Arthur Haslerig, and <b>knowing</b> <b>there</b> had been some differences between the colonel and Sir. Arthur, he persuaded them to renew their former friendship, with promises on each part to unit their endeavors {{in the service of}} Parliament". Ludlow and Lambert were more or less aligned and of the same party. [...] Similar offers were apparently made to Col. Monk by the King's party at about this time.|$|E
2500|$|In {{casting the}} silent comic strip {{characters}} of Peanuts, the trio pulled from their personalities. Lead character Charlie Brown's voice {{was decided to}} be downbeat and nondescript ("blah," [...] as Mendelson noted), while Lucy be bold and forthright. Linus' voice, it was decided, would combine both sophistication with childlike innocence. Mendelson recognized that the character of Snoopy was the strip's most popular character who seemed to seize [...] "the best jokes," [...] but realized they could not cast a voice for the cartoon dog. [...] "In the process, we gained a veritable 'canine Harpo Marx,'" [...] Mendelson later wrote. Melendez suggested he provide gibberish for Snoopy's mutterings, and simply speed up the tape to prevent viewers from <b>knowing.</b> <b>There</b> are no adult characters in the strip or in this special. Later specials would introduce an offscreen teacher; her lines are eschewed {{for the sound of}} a trombone as the team behind the specials found it humorous.|$|E

There is also not [...] "objects out there, mind in here, and experience somewhere in-between". There is a third thing called [...] "awareness" [...] which exists being aware of the contents of mind and what mind cognizes. There are five senses (arising of mere experience: shapes, colors, the components of smell, components of taste, components of sound, components of touch) and mind as the sixth institution; this means, expressly, that there can be a third thing called [...] "awareness" [...] and a third thing called [...] "experiencer who is aware of the experience". This awareness is deeply related to [...] "no-self" [...] because it does not judge the experience with craving or aversion.|$|E

2500|$|Giles Corey, an 81-year-old farmer {{from the}} {{southeast}} end of Salem (called Salem Farms), refused {{to enter a}} plea {{when he came to}} trial in September. The judges applied an archaic form of punishment called peine forte et dure, in which stones were piled on his chest until he could no longer breathe. After two days of peine fort et dure, Corey died without entering a plea. His refusal to plead is usually explained as a way of preventing his estate from being confiscated by the Crown, but, according to historian Chadwick Hansen, much of Corey's property had already been seized, and he had made a will in prison: [...] "His death was a protest ... against the methods of the court". A contemporary critic of the trials, Robert Calef, wrote, [...] "Giles Corey pleaded not Guilty to his Indictment, but would not put himself upon Tryal by the Jury (they having cleared none upon Tryal) and <b>knowing</b> <b>there</b> would be the same Witnesses against him, rather chose to undergo what Death they would put him to." ...|$|E
2500|$|Fernandez visited Beck {{and stayed}} {{for a short}} time; she told {{everyone}} {{they were to be}} married. He returned to New York City while she made preparations in Milton, Florida, where she lived. When she was abruptly fired from her job, she packed up and arrived on his doorstep in New York. Fernandez enjoyed the way she catered to his every whim, and when he learned she had left her children for him, {{he thought it was a}} sign of an unconditional love. He confessed his criminal enterprises to Beck, who quickly sent her children to the Salvation Army in order to assist Fernandez without hindrances. She posed as Fernandez's sister, giving him an air of respectability. Their victims, feeling more secure <b>knowing</b> <b>there</b> was another woman in the house, often agreed to stay with the pair. Beck also convinced some victims that she lived alone and that her [...] "brother" [...] was only a guest. Beck was extremely jealous and would go to great lengths to make sure Fernandez and his [...] "intended" [...] never consummated their relationship. When he did have sex with a woman, Beck subjected both to her violent temper.|$|E
2500|$|At 3:45 pm Chávez {{called for}} another cadena, {{though it was}} {{possibly}} prerecorded in order to distract Venezuelans since government officials reported that Chávez was speaking to them during the broadcast. Broadcasting from an underground location in the palace grounds, Chávez appeared unaware of the violence that was occurring outside and [...] "disconnected from reality", speaking for ninety minutes on the successes of his administration and calling for peace. With the networks concerned that history was in the making and that Chávez was attempting to block a government massacre, half an hour into the cadena the networks decided to split the screen again, showing the violence outside the palace, with the audio from the cadena appearing disrupted. The video also appeared pre-recorded when Chávez called for the networks to be disconnected due to actions performed on 9 April and not the present day. Shortly after Chávez ordered the networks taken off the air, they were disconnected, with Chávez saying that networks are licensed by the state, but [...] "they can't use that right to attack the state itself, to instigate violence, or, <b>knowing</b> <b>there</b> is an insurrectional plan, support it..." [...] However, a single engineer tricked DISIP and National Guard members into thinking he cut all transmission, though the networks continued to broadcast via satellite to cable, satellite and through other outlets.|$|E
