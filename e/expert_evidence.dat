5|$|The {{silencer}} {{played a}} central role. It was deemed to {{have been on the}} rifle when it was fired, because of the blood found inside it. The prosecution said the blood had come from Sheila's head when the silencer was pointed at her. Had she discovered that she could not shoot herself with the silencer attached, the court heard, it would have been found next to her body; she had no reason to return it to the gun cupboard. That she had carried out the killings was further discounted because, it was argued, she had not recently expressed suicidal thoughts; the <b>expert</b> <b>evidence</b> was that she would not have harmed her children or father; she had no interest in or knowledge of guns; she lacked the strength to overcome her father; and there was no evidence on her clothes or body that she had moved around the crime scene or been involved in a struggle. In particular, her long fingernails had remained intact.|$|E
5|$|During the 1950s, efforts {{started to}} attempt {{reform of the}} law. Following the {{prosecution}} of several notable publishers, the Society of Authors formed a committee (with Norman St John-Stevas as legal advisor) to recommend reform of the existing law, submitting their proposals and a draft bill to the Home Office in February 1955. Instead of the wholesale reform the Society hoped for, the government instead chose limited reform through the Children and Young Persons (Harmful Publications) Act 1955 dealing with horror comics, which kept the Hicklin test but required that the work as a whole be examined. The Society and sympathetic Members of Parliament then attempted to introduce a Private Member's Bill, but this was quashed by the ensuing general election. Another Private Member's Bill was successfully introduced in March 1957 and sent to a committee. Composed of a mix of censors and reformers, the committee's recommendations were mixed, consisting of both conservative (further powers of search and seizure for the police) and liberal (the use of <b>expert</b> <b>evidence</b> attesting to the work's artistic merit) proposals.|$|E

500|$|The Supreme Court's {{conclusions}} {{were described}} by newspapers and legal magazines as [...] "a landmark ruling", an [...] "historic decision", {{and as a}} [...] "major victory" [...] for the lawyers acting for the claimant. The Lawyer magazine said that the ruling [...] "professionalised the expert witness industry". In similar vein, one legal training consultant said that it [...] "marked {{the end of the}} amateur expert", but that [...] "only wimps will withdraw" [...] from giving <b>expert</b> <b>evidence.</b> One of the lawyers involved in the case, Daniel Shapiro, predicted that it would lead to between five and ten claims against experts in the following year.|$|E
500|$|He {{said that}} there were three {{justifications}} for the immunity given in the caselaw and in argument. [...] Firstly, there was the [...] "chilling effect" [...] of such claims, making witnesses reluctant to give frank evidence or to provide <b>expert</b> <b>evidence</b> at all; secondly, the risk that an expert witness would be reluctant to comply with his paramount duty to the court if to do so involved giving evidence contrary to his client's interest with a risk of being sued for doing so. Thirdly, it was [...] "undesirable" [...] that a court hearing a claim for negligence against an expert witness should have to decide whether the court that decided the claim in which the expert gave evidence reached the correct decision. [...] This argument was not {{at the forefront of the}} defendant's arguments, but was one that Lord Phillips said should not be wholly discounted. He noted that a claim based on an alleged wrongful conviction as the result of an expert's negligence would be struck out as an abuse of process unless the conviction had been overturned, under the rule in Hunter v Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police.|$|E
500|$|Once a {{duty of care}} (or duty to act, as required) {{has been}} shown, the jury should then be asked, {{following}} Lord Mackay in R v Adamoko: [...] "having regard {{to the risk of}} death involved, [...] the conduct of the defendant... so bad in all the circumstances as to amount to a criminal act or omission". This has two elements: firstly, the breach of the duty of care must relate to the risk of death (confirmed in R v Singh), and not to any lesser harm. In other words, the breach of the duty of care must cause the victim's death. Secondly the breach of the duty of care must be so egregious as to amount to a crime. For example, on the fact of Adomako itself, the defendant, an anaesthetist, failed to spot a problem with the victim's breathing tube for 11 minutes, something <b>expert</b> <b>evidence</b> suggested a competent anaesthetist would spot within thirty seconds or so. The defendant was convicted. This definition has been opposed as being circular, as defining the crime of manslaughter as gross negligence as being negligence to a criminal degree. The jury may, under this characterisation, be ruling upon a point of law and not a point of fact.|$|E

500|$|Although he {{may have}} been {{expected}} to retire following the controversy and in view of his age, Mold continued to play for Lancashire, who were short of quality bowlers, {{at the start of the}} 1901 season. At least one umpire was asked by the MCC to report specifically on Mold's bowling, but decided it was fair, and no umpire initially called him for throwing. He missed two Lancashire matches in which Phillips was an umpire, wishing to avoid a confrontation, but Lancashire were criticised by the public for omitting Mold from these matches. Consequently, he played in the game against Somerset umpired by Phillips, which started on 11 July at Old Trafford Cricket Ground. Under the captaincy of MacLaren, Mold opened the attack and bowled with Phillips at square leg. In Mold's second over of the game, Phillips no-balled him for throwing. Acting at the request of the Lancashire committee, MacLaren then switched Mold to bowl from the opposite end so that Phillips would be at the bowler's end. Even so, Phillips continued to no-ball him, and after 10 overs, Mold had been called 16 times by Phillips. MacLaren removed Mold from the attack, although he returned to bowl later without further action from either umpire. For the remainder of the match, Mold bowled from Phillips' end without censure; Phillips believed he had made his point. The other umpire took no action at any point in the match. The crowd at the game protested noisily against Phillips, for a time shouting [...] "no-ball" [...] as every ball was bowled, and making comments about him. According to Wisden, Phillips' actions caused [...] "a great sensation... The incident naturally gave rise to much excitement, and for the next few days nothing else was talked about in the cricket world." [...] At the conclusion of the match, Mitchell and Kenyon, a film-making company based in Blackburn, filmed the players leaving the field and took footage of Mold bowling in the nets. Phillips received criticism for his actions and Mold had some support in the press. Mold's Times obituary noted: [...] "Mold did not lack defenders, but those who argued that he was, and always had been, a perfectly fair bowler, had a very bad case. The weight of <b>expert</b> <b>evidence</b> was overwhelmingly against them." ...|$|E

50|$|The theory {{behind the}} Purification Rundown is that toxins, drugs, and {{radioactive}} particles {{are stored in}} body fat, which are released through the exchange of fats (thus the oil consumption) and exercise, and then finally released via perspiration and other normal mechanisms such as body waste.
