5|$|In the Islanders' inaugural season, three goaltenders {{played for}} the team: Billy Smith, Gerry Desjardins and Gerry Gray. Since then, 40 others have played {{in at least one}} regular season or playoff game. Smith stayed with the Islanders through 1989 and played in 675 regular season games and 132 playoff games, the most in the team's history. Additionally, he holds the records for most overall wins, with 304. Chico Resch has {{recorded}} the most shutouts with 25. Only fourteen have played in Islanders playoff games and of those, three <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> roster during a Stanley Cup victory.|$|E

5|$|Number two, why {{was this}} person, {{this one of the}} six around to commit this hideous crime? He was out because he had a 31-count {{indictment}} for the rape of a child, and he was out on $15,000 bail, instead of the requisite $450,000 bail that he never could have made and never would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> street.|$|E
5|$|The Livonian Brothers of the Sword {{had been}} all but annihilated in the Battle of Saule in 1236. Even {{if there is no}} other {{evidence}} of their presence in Finland than the earlier papal letter from 1232, both the Archbishop and the Tavastians seem to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> move right after their demise. There had also been a revolt against the Germans in Estonia in 1236.|$|E
5|$|The {{area was}} built {{up during the}} reign of Charles II with fashionable London residences. It became known for high-class {{shopping}} in the 18th century, and gentlemen's clubs in the 19th. The Reform, Athenaeum and Travellers Clubs have survived to the 21st century. The War Office was based on Pall Mall {{during the second half of}} the 19th century, and the Royal Automobile Club's headquarters <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> street since 1908.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} accent and/or dialect spoken by natives {{throughout}} Texas is {{sometimes referred to}} as Texan English, which itself is a sub-variety of a broader category of American English known as Southern American English. Creole language is spoken in East Texas. In some areas of the state—particularly in the large cities – Western American English and General American English, <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> increase. Chicano English—due to a growing Hispanic population—is widespread in South Texas, while African American Vernacular English, is especially notable in historically minority areas of urban Texas.|$|E
5|$|The {{station has}} been on the New Jersey State Historic Preservation Office listings since March 25, 1998, the last of the four {{stations}} from East Orange to Glen Ridge to receive the listing.

5|$|Another {{traditionally}} respected {{group which}} Joehana criticizes is the hajjis, those Muslims who <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. The hajjis in Joehana's stories are generally greedy and lustful, without {{any interest in}} the good of humanity. In Tjarios Agan Permas, for instance, Hajji Serbanna displays his hypocrisy by damning usury as haraam (sinful) while charging high interest rates for a loan, and refuses to complete the mandatory prayers because he is waiting on a guest bearing large gifts. The hajji is portrayed as wearing so much make-up that, {{in the opinion of}} Kartini et al., it is as if he is deliberately dressing as a clown.|$|E

5|$|Bryan Trottier, Denis Potvin and Mike Bossy {{have won}} {{four or five}} {{individual}} awards each. In 1978–79, Trottier led the NHL with 47 goals and 134 points, earning him the Art Ross Trophy and {{a spot on the}} NHL First All-Star Team. Trottier also received the Hart Memorial Trophy for being the most valuable player during the 1978–79 regular season. In the 1975–76, 1977–78, and 1978–79 regular seasons, Potvin was awarded the James Norris Memorial Trophy as the best defense player in the league. Bossy is a three-time winner of the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy, an award given for gentlemanly conduct during the regular season. All three have won the Calder Memorial Trophy once, and <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> NHL First All-Star Team at least twice. Trottier and Bossy have both won the Conn Smythe Trophy once, which is awarded to the most valuable player of the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|Environmental issues <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{national}} agenda since 1970. Environmental controversies include debates on oil and nuclear energy, dealing with {{air and water}} pollution, the economic costs of protecting wildlife, logging and deforestation, and international responses to global warming. Many federal and state agencies are involved. The most prominent is the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), created by presidential order in 1970. The idea of wilderness has shaped the management of public lands since 1964, with the Wilderness Act. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 is intended to protect threatened and endangered species and their habitats, which are monitored by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.|$|E
5|$|In late 2000, Wail {{traveled}} to the United Arab Emirates, where he purchased traveler's checks, presumed to have been paid for by Mustafa Ahmed al-Hawsawi. Five other hijackers passed through the United Arab Emirates and purchased traveler's checks, including Majed Moqed, Saeed al-Ghamdi, Hamza al-Ghamdi, Ahmed al-Haznawi and Ahmed al-Nami. The 9/11 Commission believes {{that three of the}} future muscle hijackers, including Wail and Waleed, traveled in a group from Saudi Arabia to Beirut and then onward to Iran where they could travel through to Afghanistan without getting their passports stamped. An associate of a senior Hezbollah operative is thought to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same flight, although this may have been a coincidence.|$|E

5|$|Native herbivores such as {{the moose}} are found in small numbers near waterways, {{especially}} at lower elevations. Moose populations in northwestern Wyoming and other areas of North America <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> decline {{since the end of}} the 20th century, possibly due to a parasite. There were an estimated 739 moose in the forest in 2006 which is almost 300 fewer than there were 20 years earlier. Other ungulate species are much more common and there are over 20,000 elk (also known as wapiti) and 40,000 mule deer. Bighorn sheep and mountain goats inhabit the rocky terrain and highest elevations. During the winter, one of the largest bighorn sheep herds in the lower 48 states congregate in the region around Dubois, Wyoming; however, their numbers since 1990 have been diminished due to disease transmitted from contact with domesticated sheep and goats. An estimated 5,000 bighorn sheep are found throughout the forest and a small but stable population of 200 mountain goats reside in the northernmost portions of the forest. Bison and pronghorn antelope are two other ungulates that live on the forest and have sustainable populations.|$|E
5|$|The {{disaster}} and investigation received widespread media coverage. The {{impact on the}} public was increased by the dramatic effect of an amateur photo taken of the aircraft rolling that was published {{on the front page of}} the Chicago Tribune on the Sunday two days after the crash. There were some early reports that a collision with a small aircraft had been the cause of the crash. This apparently was the result of the discovery of small-aircraft parts among the wreckage at the crash site. National Transportation Safety Board vice-chairman Elwood T. Driver, in a press briefing, was photographed holding a broken bolt and nut, implying that these parts were a cause of the accident. The small-plane parts were subsequently determined to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground at the time of the crash, at the former general aviation Ravenswood Airport, a facility that had been out of service for a few years. An owner there had been selling used aircraft parts from a remaining hangar building.|$|E
5|$|The {{gatehouse}} to {{the inner}} bailey has the coats of arms of Sir Henry Sidney and Queen Elizabeth I displayed over it, dating to 1581, and was originally a three-storeyed building with transomed windows and fireplaces, probably used as the lodgings for the judges. There were probably additional heraldic supporters displayed alongside the arms, since lost. A porter's lodge would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right hand side of the entrance to control access, with the rooms accessed by a spiral staircase in a protruding tower, with prominent triple chimneys, since lost. Alongside the gatehouse was originally a half-timbered building, possibly a laundry, approximately , which has since been lost.|$|E

5|$|The menu at Pétrus {{is split}} into several fixed price menus, {{containing}} modern French cuisine. It {{has been described}} by Zoe Williams as being distinctly Gordon Ramsay in composition, despite the influences of head chef Sean Burbidge. The meals come with an amuse-bouche, a pre-starter course, and after dinner chocolates in addition to the items listed on the menus themselves. A number of pan fried fish dishes <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> menu, including mackerel with tomato chutney and a niçoise salad, and a sea bream course served with brown shrimp, samphire and an oyster velouté sauce. Further seafood related dishes include a langoustine and watercress soup entrée which was praised by food critic Jay Rayner. Sauces are generally delivered to the table in small jugs and are poured tableside.|$|E
5|$|The {{silencer}} {{played a}} central role. It was deemed to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rifle when it was fired, because of the blood found inside it. The prosecution said the blood had come from Sheila's head when the silencer was pointed at her. Had she discovered {{that she could not}} shoot herself with the silencer attached, the court heard, it would have been found next to her body; she had no reason to return it to the gun cupboard. That she had carried out the killings was further discounted because, it was argued, she had not recently expressed suicidal thoughts; the expert evidence was that she would not have harmed her children or father; she had no interest in or knowledge of guns; she lacked the strength to overcome her father; and there was no evidence on her clothes or body that she had moved around the crime scene or been involved in a struggle. In particular, her long fingernails had remained intact.|$|E
5|$|Today, the {{architectural}} and historical value of Malta's fortifications is widely acknowledged, and many {{also serve as}} tourist attractions. All fortifications were included on the Antiquities List of 1925, and virtually all surviving Hospitaller fortifications are now listed on the National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands, Malta's national heritage register. The fortified city of Valletta has been listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO since 1980. The other fortifications around Malta's harbour area, the fortified cities of Mdina and the Cittadella, {{as well as the}} Victoria Lines <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tentative list of World Heritage Sites since 1998.|$|E
