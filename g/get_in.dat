5|$|Among {{his most}} {{prevalent}} skills are his speed and wrist shot, {{the latter of}} which has improved alongside his recent years of increased offensive production. He is also proficient at taking faceoffs. On the penalty kill, he is an efficient shot blocker, using his body to <b>get</b> <b>in</b> the way of pucks. While competing on the powerplay, he often uses his size and strength to maintain position {{in front of the}} opposing net to either screen the goaltender or deflect shots.|$|E
5|$|Building traditions {{varied by}} region {{and type of}} structure. Food storage houses - stabbur - were usually built on stilts in ways that made it {{difficult}} for mice and rats, but not cats, to <b>get</b> <b>in.</b> Exterior cladding varied by region, often to take into account local climate conditions. Roofs were often covered with birch bark and sod.|$|E

5|$|Lody's {{controllers}} realised {{that his}} mission {{was not going}} according to plan and attempted to <b>get</b> <b>in</b> touch with him to provide assistance. A letter dated 8 September was sent to Charles A. Inglis c/o Thomas Cook, Edinburgh, but he never collected it, and may never {{have been aware of}} it. Another German agent, Paul Daelen, was ordered to go to Britain and provide Lody with a new cover address. Daelen reached England too late. Lody had already travelled to Ireland without giving his controllers a means of contacting him.|$|E
5|$|Paulet was {{something}} of an eccentric. On one occasion, while his ship was moored at Spithead, he asked his admiral for permission to take leave to visit London. This was refused, with the comment that Paulet could travel as far on land as he could <b>get</b> <b>in</b> his barge. Thus challenged, Paulet loaded his barge onto a cart {{and went off to}} London anyway.|$|E

5|$|Potty then scolds Patchy for his unsanitary {{environment}} (such as keeping {{ground beef}} {{in an old}} boot, having rats in the kitchen, not washing his hands after using the bathroom and not wearing a hair net). Fed up with Potty's criticisms, Patchy starts throwing patties at Potty, but they keep missing, and one eventually hits Mr. Pirateson, the Owner of Poop Deck.

5|$|The brawl {{began with}} 45.9seconds {{remaining}} in the game, when Indiana led 97–82. The Pistons' Ben Wallace was fouled from behind by the Pacers' Ron Artest (now known as Metta World Peace), who slapped him {{across the back of}} the head during a layup attempt. Wallace later said that Artest had warned him he would be hit. Wallace responded by shoving Artest in the face with both hands, causing players from both teams to quickly <b>get</b> <b>in</b> between them as they attempted to keep Wallace and Artest separated.|$|E
5|$|The first RAF trial CAM launch {{was from}} Empire Rainbow, at Greenock on the River Clyde on 31 May 1941; the Hurricane landed at Abbotsinch. Six CAM ships joined convoys in June 1941. When a CAM ship arrived at its destination, the pilot usually {{launched}} and landed {{at a nearby}} airfield to <b>get</b> <b>in</b> as much flight time as possible before his return trip. Pilots were rotated out of CAM assignments after two round-trip voyages to avoid the deterioration of flying skills {{from the lack of}} flying time during the assignment.|$|E

5|$|To {{give the}} series its own {{distinctive}} musical identity, according to Djawadi, the producers asked {{him not to}} use musical elements such as flutes or solo vocals {{that had already been}} successfully used by other major fantasy productions.

5|$|According to Savenko, the Serbsky Center {{has long}} labored to legalize its monopolistic {{position}} of the Main expert institution of the country. The ambition and permissiveness—which, due to proximity to power, allow the Serbsky Center to <b>get</b> <b>in</b> touch over the telephone with the judges and explain to them who is who {{and what is the}} guideline, although the judges themselves have already learned it—have {{turned out to be a}} considerable drop in the level of the expert reports on many positions. Such a drop was inevitable and foreseeable in the context of the Serbsky Center efforts to eliminate adversary character of the expert reports of the parties, then to maximally degrade the role of the specialist as a reviewer and critic of the presented expert report, and to legalize the state of affairs. Lyubov Vinogradova believes there has been a continuous diminution in patients' rights as independent experts are now excluded from processes, cannot speak in court and can do nothing against the State experts.|$|E
5|$|After the match, an in {{ring segment}} {{took place in}} which The Big Show, entered the ring and asked the crowd whether they thought {{he should have been}} in the Championship Scramble for the WWE Championship. SmackDown General Manager Vickie Guerrero, who portrays an {{on-screen}} authority figure for the SmackDown brand, then came to the ring and proceeded to insult the Big Show, and demanded that he leave the ring. Druids then came to the ring bringing a casket, and The Undertaker appeared on the TitanTron, telling Guerrero to either <b>get</b> <b>in</b> the casket herself or he would put her in it. Guerrero refused to enter the casket voluntarily, so The Undertaker began to come to ringside. The Big Show held back Guerrero as The Undertaker came to the ring. Once he was in the ring, The Undertaker began to choke Guerrero, but the Big Show turned heel, becoming a villainous character, by striking The Undertaker and freeing Guerrero. He proceeded to attack The Undertaker, and restrained him to allow Guerrero to slap him and spit in his face.|$|E
