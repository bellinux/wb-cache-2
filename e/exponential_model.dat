50|$|One of {{the papers}} in Key and Smith defines channel holding time as being equal to the average holding time divided by {{the average number of}} handovers per call plus one.Usually an <b>exponential</b> <b>model</b> is {{preferred}} to calculate the channel holding time for simplicity in simulations.

The <b>exponential</b> <b>model</b> may not be correctly modelling the channel holding timedistribution as other papers may try to prove, but it gives an approximation.

The mobility of the user and the cell shape and sizecause the channel holding time to have a different distribution function to that of call duration (call holding time). This difference is large for highly mobile users and small cell sizes. Since the channel holding time andcall duration relationships are affected by mobility and cell size, for a stationary MS and large cell sizes,channel holding time and call duration are the same.|$|E
40|$|Curved <b>exponential</b> <b>models</b> {{have the}} {{property}} that {{the dimension of}} the minimal sufficient statistic {{is larger than the}} number of parameters in the model. Many econometric models share this feature. The first part of the paper shows that, in fact, econometric models with this property are necessarily curved exponential. A method for constructing an explicit set of minimal sufficient statistics, based on partial scores and likelihood ratios, is given. The difference in dimension between parameterand statistic and the curvature of these models have important consequences for inference. It is not {{the purpose of this paper}} to contribute significantly to the theory of curved <b>exponential</b> <b>models,</b> other than to show that the theory applies to many econometric models and to highlight some multivariate aspects. Using the methods developed in the first part, we show that demand systems, the single structural equation model, the seemingly unrelated regressions, and autoregressive models are all curved <b>exponential</b> <b>models.</b> ...|$|R

50|$|Other occupancy-abundance {{models that}} can be used to {{describe}} the SPO includes Nachman's <b>exponential</b> <b>model,</b> Hanski and Gyllenberg's metapopulation model, He and Gaston's improved negative binomial model by applying Taylor's power law between the mean and variance of species distribution, and Hui and McGeoch's droopy-tail percolation model. One important application of the SPO in ecology is to estimate species abundance based on presence-absence data, or occupancy alone. This is appealing because obtaining presence-absence data is often cost-efficient. Using a dipswitch test consisting of 5 subtests and 15 criteria, Hui et al. confirmed that using the SPO is a robust and reliable for assemblage-scale regional abundance estimation. The other application of SPOs includes trends identification in populations, which is extremely valuable for biodiversity conservation.|$|E

5000|$|Response Modeling Methodology (RMM) is {{a general}} {{platform}} for modeling monotonic convex relationships. RMM had been initially developed {{as a series of}} extensions to the original inverse Box-Cox transformation:   where y is a percentile of the modeled response, Y (the modeled random variable), z is the respective percentile of a normal variate and λ is the Box-Cox parameter. Note that as λ goes to zero, the inverse Box-Cox transformation becomes:  an <b>exponential</b> <b>model.</b> Therefore, the original inverse Box-Cox transformation contains a trio of models: linear (λ=1), power (λ≠1, λ≠0) and exponential (λ=0). This implies that on estimating λ, using sample data, the final model is not determined in advance (prior to estimation) but rather as a result of estimating. In other words, data alone determine the final model.|$|E

40|$|A {{nonlinear}} model simulating {{the relationship}} between the mass of solute sorbed on clay mineral surfaces and in equilibrium with the concentration of solute in the pore fluid has been discussed in this work. The model and the procedure for obtaining the parameter (β) associated with the model were presented. The predicted cadmium isotherms for two types of clayey soils using the <b>exponential</b> <b>model</b> were in excellent agreement with experimental results (Shackelford and Daniel, 1991). Sorption isotherm predicted by the <b>exponential</b> <b>model</b> was compared with other existing models such as Freundlich model and Langmuir model. Seven statistical goodness-of-fit measures were used to evaluate prediction accuracy of the <b>exponential</b> <b>model</b> as well as the Langmuir model and the Freundlich model. All seven statistical goodness-of-fit measures indicated that the <b>exponential</b> <b>model</b> has the best prediction accuracy among the sorption isotherm prediction models. For instance, the error norm for the <b>exponential</b> <b>model</b> was Ne = 0. 15 (best value of Ne is zero) for the kaolinite clay, while Ne = 2. 95 and Ne = 6. 1 for Langmuir model and Freundlich model, respectively. Furthermore, for Lufkin clay, the error norm for the <b>exponential</b> <b>model</b> was Ne = 1. 6, while Ne = 264. 4 and Ne = 15. 1 for Langmuir model and Freundlich model, respectively. The modeling efficiency (EF), Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient-of-efficiency (E) and the index-of-agreement (d) values (best value for EF, E and d is one for the three measures) are best for the <b>exponential</b> <b>model</b> and for the two considered soils. For example, EF = 0. 992, E = 0. 999, and d = 0. 999 for the <b>exponential</b> <b>model</b> (Lufkin clay). However, EF =- 0. 71, E =- 20. 5 and d = 0. 07 for Langmuir model, and EF = 0. 79, E = 0. 93 and d = 0. 95 for Freundlich model for the same clay...|$|E
