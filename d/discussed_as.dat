5|$|Connectivity to the Game Boy Advance was <b>discussed</b> <b>as</b> an {{opportunity}} among the developers, but they eventually agreed that Double Dash!! was not suited to these connectivity ideas {{and decided to}} exclude it. It was desirable to narrow down {{the gap between the}} ability of veteran and novice players. Therefore, gameplay features like the ability to escape the banana were removed; the staff wanted both veteran and novice players to enjoy themselves.|$|E
5|$|The Lady's Realm was a British women's {{magazine}} published from 1896 until 1914, possibly until 1915. It primarily targeted upper-class readers {{as well as}} an aspirational middle-class audience, featuring photographs, poems, fiction, {{and columns}} by popular authors such as Marie Corelli, Frances Hodgson Burnett, Jack London, and H.G. Wells. The London Season was regularly covered, with visuals of significant society figures and débutantes appearing. Fashion trends in Paris and London were frequently <b>discussed</b> <b>as</b> well, particularly by its fashion editor Marian Pritchard.|$|E

None of these proposals to extend SR 125 have been included in SANDAG's 2050 Regional Transportation Plan.|$|E
5|$|In service, Skylon could {{potentially}} {{lower the cost}} of launching satellites which, according to evidence submitted to the UK parliament by REL, is forecast to be around £650/kg; as of 2011, the average launch cost using conventional methods was estimated to be roughly £15,000/kg. Amongst other prospective operations, Skylon would be capable of transporting payloads of up to 10-tonnes to the International Space Station. REL has also completed internal studies into the use of Skylon as a launch platform for a network of space-based solar power satellites, which have been historically unfeasible due to high launch costs. According to business publication Management Today, Skylon has been <b>discussed</b> <b>as</b> a possible replacement for NASA's Space Shuttle programme.|$|E

5|$|When Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, visited Athens in March 1918, {{to confer}} the Order of the Bath upon the king, Alexander feared that a {{marriage}} {{between him and}} Princess Mary of the United Kingdom would be <b>discussed</b> <b>as</b> part {{of an attempt to}} consolidate the relationship between Greece and Britain. To Alexander's relief, Arthur asked to meet Aspasia, and declared that, if he were younger, he would have sought to marry her himself. For the foreign powers, and particularly the British ambassador, the marriage was seen as positive. The British authorities feared that Alexander would abdicate in order to marry Aspasia if the wedding was blocked, and they wanted to avoid Greece becoming a republic in case it led to instability or an increase in French influence at their expense.|$|E
