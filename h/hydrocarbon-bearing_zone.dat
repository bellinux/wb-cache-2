Due to P- and S-wave attenuation, a gas condensate in clean sandstone was marked with the Sw ranging from 25 to 30 %.|$|E
30|$|The {{assessment}} of depositional environments {{is based on}} available GR wireline log data; however, core or sedimentological data {{is necessary for the}} accurate interpretation of a depositional environment because the defined gamma log trends are not indicative of a specific environment (Cant 1992; Siddiqui et al. 2013). The sandstone package in Chanda- 1 represents a boxcar trend (Fig.  3). Fining upward signatures of the GR is evident in Chanda Deep- 1, showing the irregular/ serrated signature of GR (Fig.  4). The left boxcar trend with less sharp edges occurs at intervals of 4710 – 4720, and 4790 – 4794  m in Chanda Deep- 1. Based on petrophysical analyses, one <b>hydrocarbon-bearing</b> <b>zone</b> is identified in Chanda- 1, while four such zones are identified in Chanda Deep- 1 (Figs.  3, 4).|$|E

30|$|This {{research}} aims to {{add value}} to the geology of the field with special interest in estimating the possible oil and gas initially in-place considering range of reservoir properties and structural uncertainty. This was achieved by interpreting the 3 D seismic data to define the reservoir geometry, evaluating the petrophysical parameters of the reservoirs and determining the lateral extent of the <b>hydrocarbon-bearing</b> <b>zone</b> using the delineated fluid contacts; this helped to estimate the gross rock volume (GRV) and hydrocarbon volume. It {{has been shown that}} when 3 D seismic data are integrated with well log data, it provides a powerful tool to determine the structural frame work and estimation of reserves of a field (Futalan et al. 2012; Oyedele et al. 2013; Ihianle et al. 2013; Amigun et al. 2014; Onayemi and Oladele 2014).

30|$|LRP {{reservoir}} {{was first}} {{discovered in a}} sandstone reservoir within the Gulf of Mexico (Boyd et al. 1995) and has progressively been at the frontline of several industrial projects that involves deep water exploration and brown-field development. It {{has been described as}} <b>hydrocarbon-bearing</b> <b>zone</b> that appears as water interval based on open-hole resistivity measurements. Meanwhile, such intervals show strong hydrocarbon on mud logs and produce hydrocarbon as either gas or oil with little or no water cut from core studies, pressure and production tests (Pittman 1971; Keith and Pittman 1983; Worthington 2000). Additionally, the LRP intervals are commonly identified with high water saturation, which makes such intervals of low interest {{to the extent that they}} are discarded as attractive to appraise, particularly when oil prices are low. Typically, LRP zones are characterized by formation interval, with moderate to high porosities, showing extremely low resistivity that are often less than 3  Ω-m and most frequently encountered in areas with saline formation water (Griffiths et al. 2006; Obeidi et al. 2010; Worthington 2000; Farouk et al. 2014; Uchida et al. 2015). While Boyd et al. (1995) proposed that the resistivity range is between 0.5 and 5  Ω-m, several other researchers, like Zhao et al. (2000), stated that LRP can be identified by the ratio of the pay zone to the water-bearing zone and this ratio is considered to be in the range of 2.|$|E
30|$|Petrophysics {{coupled with}} rock physics studies are {{significant}} {{in the evaluation of}} well and field potential, and to construct subsurface models based on rock properties. This case study combines petrophysics and fluid substitution modeling for reservoir characterization of the producing Datta Formation in the Chanda oil field of Kohat Basin. The Datta Formation interval of two wells, Chanda- 1, and Chanda Deep- 1, is analyzed to calculate petrophysical parameters including gross thickness, net thickness, net to gross ratio (NGR), porosity (PHA), permeability (K), and water saturation (SW). The Datta Formation represents fair to good porosity in the range of 7 – 13 %. Water saturation shows low values lying in the range of 31 – 36 %. The formation is interpreted from gamma ray (GR) log trends, where sand packages dominantly represent a left box-car and irregular trend. Cross-plots, such as density porosity (RHOB-NPHI), gamma ray-density (GR-RHOB), gamma ray-porosity (GR-NPHI), and thorium–potassium (Th–K), were used for lithological identification in the studied wells, and indicated arkosic and micaceous sandstone as the dominant lithology with shale. Evaluation of petrophysical parameters shows that the Datta sands have high hydrocarbon saturation in the area. The fluid substitution modeling was applied to clastics of the Datta Formation for field development. One <b>hydrocarbon-bearing</b> <b>zone</b> (zone 1) was identified in Chanda- 1, while four hydrocarbon-bearing zones (zones 1, 2, 3, and 4) were identified in Chanda Deep- 1. Fluid substitution results at the Datta level showed that the P-wave velocity and density varied when the hydrocarbon phase was substituted completely with water. With the substitution of brine with oil, there was a change in compressional wave velocity (Vp) and a decrease in density (RHOB), while the shear wave velocity (Vs) was stable and unaffected by the change of fluid density and saturation. The results of this research could be used to predict saturation types of reservoir using seismic data and to identify pay-zones, and map reservoir saturation to drill for oil and gas.|$|E
30|$|As a QLM, any {{separation}} between the Ro and Rt curves is an indication to <b>hydrocarbon-bearing</b> <b>zones,</b> whereas non-separation cases are indications to water-bearing zones. The space between the two curves is proportion to {{the percentage of the}} hydrocarbon saturation.|$|R
30|$|In this {{technique}} of QLM which considered as compatible overlays method, three curves are plotted on a logarithmic scale and their overlying pattern is followed to detect {{locations of the}} water- or <b>hydrocarbon-bearing</b> <b>zones</b> in addition to roughly detect {{the ratio of the}} movable hydrocarbons.|$|R
30|$|Before water {{saturation}} {{is calculated}} for any zone, {{it is necessary}} to scan a log and locate favorable zones that warrant further investigation. This is true not only for potential <b>hydrocarbon-bearing</b> <b>zones,</b> but water-bearing zones as well. This {{is often referred to as}} “scanilizing” a log (HLS 2007). There are certain responses that should be looked for, and these responses may indicate whether a zone is water bearing or hydrocarbon bearing.|$|R
30|$|Qualitative {{evaluation}} of hydrocarbon resources involves {{the integration of}} seismic and well data interpretations (Aizebeokhai and Olayinka 2011). P-wave seismic dataset, whether 2 -D or 3 -D, could be analyzed for mapping geological structures, understanding subsurface stratigraphy as well as delineating areal distribution of reservoir sands and their fluid. 3 -D seismic datasets offer more advantages than 2 -D because their dense grid of lines {{makes it possible to}} develop an accurate interpretation of structural and stratigraphic details (Saeland and Simpson 1982). Though 3 -D surveys are relatively expensive, they are cost effective because they eliminate unnecessary development holes and increase recoverable hydrocarbon volumes through the discovery of isolated reservoir pools which otherwise might be missed (Sheriff and Geldart 1983). Niger Delta area {{is one of the most}} productive basins in Africa typified by six depobelts (OPEC 2017). This hydrocarbon-rich basin is ranked eighth amid the world’s hydrocarbon provinces with further auspicious reserves not yet discovered as search for petroleum proceeds into the deeper offshore. The Niger Delta hydrocarbon province has some verified recoverable reserves of around 37, 452  million barrels (mmbbl) of oil (OPEC 2017) and 5.1 trillion cubic metres of gas resources (BP 2014). Current massive oil discoveries in the deep-water zones of the Delta suggest that the province will continue to be a focus of exploration activities (Corredor et al. 2005). It has, therefore, become necessary to apply exploration and production technologies to harness these hydrocarbon resources. The ‘Pennay’ field is around the boundary between Coastal and Central Swamps, and has not been fully explored and exploited to its potential (Billoti and Shaw 2005). Although, seven exploratory wells have been drilled (Fig.  1) to extract useful information about the field, there still exists some level of uncertainty regarding the reservoir structure and internal anisotropy, fluid properties and hydrocarbon volume. Qualitative {{evaluation of}} hydrocarbon resources involves the integration of seismic and well data interpretations. Conventional interpretation of seismic data includes horizon and fault picking on reflection seismic sections. A seismic interpreter integrates geology, geophysics, and engineering, and equally makes simplifying assumptions to get an interpretation job done. Nevertheless, properties of hydrocarbon-bearing reservoirs such as porosity, fluid saturation and net to gross are derived from petrophysical interpretation of well log data. Integrating log-derived reservoir properties with seismic data and structural interpretation enable an interpretation team to quantify subsurface hydrocarbon accumulations, generate prospects and leads, classify petroleum resources, determine probability of success, rank resources, plan future wells, reduce exploration and drilling risks, and also increase success rate for drillable prospects (Adeoye and Enikanselu 2009). This study aims to improve the understanding of the subsurface geology of the field with distinct attention in estimating the possible oil and gas initially in place considering range of reservoir properties and structural uncertainty. This was accomplished by integrating and interpreting the 3 D seismic data to define the reservoir geometry, evaluating the petrophysical parameters of the reservoirs and determining the lateral extent of the <b>hydrocarbon-bearing</b> <b>zone</b> using the delineated fluid contacts; this helped to estimate the gross rock volume (GRV) and hydrocarbon volume. Onayemi and Oladele (2014) have shown that when 3 D seismic data are integrated with well log data, it provides a powerful tool to determine the structural frame work and estimation of reserves of a field (Futalan et al. 2012; Oyedele et al. 2013; Ihianle et al. 2013; Amigun et al. 2014; Onayemi and Oladele 2014). Consequently, this study comprises imaging the subsurface structures, determination of reservoir properties and estimation of volumes for hydrocarbons within reservoirs of the Pennay field using integrated approach of petrophysical, seismic and volumetric methods.|$|E
30|$|Quick look methods (QLM) in log {{interpretation}} {{are helpful}} to the geologist because they provide flags, or indicators, that point to possible hydrocarbon zones. The importance of QLM is {{in their ability to}} provide information {{about the nature of the}} fluids in the pore spaces and the lithology of the reservoirs in a quick and simple way. Four ways of QLM are applied on the Middle Miocene Jeribe Formation from the well Ja- 49 in Jambour Oilfield. The apparent water resistivity (Rwa) method helped in quick detecting the <b>hydrocarbon-bearing</b> <b>zones</b> of the formation. The logarithmic movable oil plot method assisted in detecting the intensity of the movability of the hydrocarbons within the <b>hydrocarbon-bearing</b> <b>zones</b> of the formation. The SP versus Rxo/Rt overlay is an additional helpful way for detecting water and hydrocarbon-bearing horizons without need to know porosity. movable hydrocarbon index (MHI) is also used as QLM for detecting the movability of the hydrocarbons through calculating the ratio of water saturation in the uninvaded zone to that of the flushed zone. Accordingly, the formation in the studied well appeared to be generally a <b>hydrocarbon-bearing</b> reservoir with <b>zones</b> of different movable hydrocarbon potentiality. The application of MHI method indicated that about 53 % of the gross 56  m thickness of the formation contains movable hydrocarbons. The upper and lower 5  m of the formation appear to be containing the most efficient productive horizons. No actual oil water contact is observed in the studied section of Jeribe Formation, which means the oil column extends down to certain depth in the formations underlying Jeribe Formation.|$|R

In this particular study, model-based and sparse-spike inversion algorithms are successfully applied on 3 D seismic and wireline log data to predict reservoir {{character in the}} Lower Goru Formation (C-sand interval). Our results suggest that model-based post-stack seismic inversion provides more reasonable estimates (i. e. returning detailed spatial variations) for acoustic impedance and porosity when compared to sparse-spike inversion algorithms. The calibration of these estimates with petrophysical data from wireline log data indicates an appropriate agreement amongst them.

30|$|The {{datasets}} {{available for}} this study (Table  1) include a base map, 3 -D seismic volume, suites of borehole logs for seven wells (Figs.  5, 6) and checkshot data. The 3 D seismic data volume is a post-stack, zero-phase, migrated, 58 -folds, with dominant bandwidth of 65  Hz. It consists of 401 inlines and 201 crosslines. Lithologies in the field were identified via gamma ray log and this was possible by establishing shale baseline of 70 API within gamma ray log. The negative deviation from the shale baseline indicates that the lithology is sand and positive deviation to the right indicates that the lithology is shale. Hydrocarbon-bearing reservoirs in the seven wells were identified using area that has high resistivity values and low gamma ray which are an indication of hydrocarbon and sand unit, respectively; these areas were delineated and mapped as reservoirs. The 3 D seismic data volume was used for fault interpretation and was quality checked using the 3 D window. Identified faults were assigned names, colour coded (Fig.  7). Four key seismic horizons were tied to the seismic section with the well tops which were defined from the gamma ray log.

30|$|The {{pursuit of}} an ideal {{approach}} for hydrocarbon play assessment has been a task that many oil and gas organizations are engrossed with. Observation has shown that only one-third of oil in place has been recovered through the conventional method of production (Kramers 1994; Nwankwo et al. 2014). For the unproduced oil, {{research has shown that}} it varies according to the depositional environment. 40 – 80 % of the unrecovered oil is found in fluvial sandstone reservoir or deep sea fans (Larue and Yue 2003; Nwankwo et al. 2014). The efforts by oil and gas organizations to increase their production rate through high investment of capitals to improve an enhanced oil recovery sometimes fail. There is need to contribute to the solution of hydrocarbon recovery ambiguities (Nwankwo et al. 2014). One of the major ways of resolving this issue is through hydrocarbon play assessment. This supports our idea of variation of petrophysical property distibutions within the hydrocarbon reservoir, their transition across stratigraphic intervals {{and the quality of the}} reservoirs. Primary depositional or secondary diagenetic processes determine the heteorogeneity of the reservoir rock properties. It has shown that porosity and permeability define the quality of any reservoir model (Nwankwo et al. 2014). Studies have shown that adopting seismic and well log data for reservoir characterization can provide an optimal framework for delineation of subsurface structural features and evaluation of volumetric analysis of probable hydrocarbon reservoir. This can be obtained through the interpretation of 3 D seismic data to define the geometry of the reservoir and estimation of the petrophysical models such as porosity, permeability, water saturation, hydrocarbon saturation and delineation of fluid contacts of the <b>hydrocarbon-bearing</b> <b>zones</b> (Sanuade et al. 2018; Futalan et al. 2012; Oyedele et al. 2013; Ihianle et al. 2013; Amigun et al. 2014; Onayemi and Oladele 2014).|$|R
40|$|AbstractElectrofacies {{are used}} to {{determine}} reservoir rock properties, especially permeability, to simulate fluid flow in porous media. These are determined based on classification of similar logs among different groups of logging data. Data classification is accomplished by different statistical analysis such as principal component analysis, cluster analysis and differential analysis. The {{aim of this study}} is to predict 3 D FZI (flow zone index) and Electrofacies (EFACT) volumes from a large volume of 3 D seismic data. This study is divided into two parts. In the first part of the study, in order to make the EFACT model, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) log parameters were employed for developing an Electrofacies diagram based on pore size distribution and porosity variations. Then, a graph-based clustering method, known as multi resolution graph-based clustering (MRGC), was employed to classify and obtain the optimum number of Electrofacies. Seismic attribute analysis was then applied to model each relaxation group in order to build the initial 3 D model which was used to reach the final model by applying Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN). In the second part of the study, the FZI 3 D model was created by multi attributes technique. Then, this model was improved by three different artificial intelligence systems including PNN, multilayer feed-forward network (MLFN) and radial basis function network (RBFN). Finally, models of FZI and EFACT were compared. Results obtained from this study revealed that the two models are in good agreement and PNN method is successful in modeling FZI and EFACT from 3 D seismic data for which no Stoneley data or NMR log data are available. Moreover, they may be used to detect <b>hydrocarbon-bearing</b> <b>zones</b> and locate the exact place for producing wells for the future development plans. In addition, the result provides a geologically realistic spatial FZI and reservoir facies distribution which helps to understand the subsurface reservoirs heterogeneities in the study area...|$|R
30|$|The {{data sets}} {{available}} {{for this research}} include a base map, a three-dimensional (3 D) seismic volume, suites of well logs for five (5) wells and checkshot data (Table  1). The 3 D seismic data volume is a post stack, zero phase, Migrated, 58 folds, with dominant bandwidth of 65 Hz. It consists of 401 inlines and 201 crosslines. The quality in terms of resolution of the seismic section was further enhanced using post-processing techniques. Various lithologies in the field were identified via gamma ray log and this was possible by establishing shale baseline or cut-off mark of 70 API within gamma ray log. The negative deviation from the shale baseline indicate that the lithology is sand and positive deviation to the right indicates that the lithology is shale lithology. Hydrocarbon-bearing reservoirs in the five wells were identified using area that has high-resistivity values and low gamma ray which {{is an indication of}} hydrocarbon and sand unit, respectively, such area was digitized on petrel and named. The 3 D seismic data volume (Fig.  8 a) was used for fault interpretation and was quality checked using the 3 D window. Identified faults were assigned names, colour-coded (Fig.  8 b). Four key seismic horizons were tied to the seismic section with the well tops which were defined from the gamma ray log. The resistivity logs were used to determine potential <b>hydrocarbon-bearing</b> <b>zones.</b> Qualities such as continuity, event strength, amplitude, and coherency were used as guides. These analyses prompted the interpretation of the seismic horizons (Fig.  8 b). Five faults were mapped from the field the field of study and it was found out that the major faults are growth fault and roll-over anticline. Seven (7) attributes were extracted from the seismic sections (horizon based and at 20 – 40  ms time-windows based) covering all the mapped horizons. This was done to analyze the amplitude and frequency changes and relate them possibly to changing reservoir properties away from well control on the mapped horizons across the field. Another section of the study involved the prediction of spatial distribution of reservoir and rock properties using multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN). The basic idea behind MLPNN is the use of a set of one or more measured values (independent variables) to predict the value of a single dependent variable. Well-to-seismic ties are considered to be the training points for the method; both the seismic response and the well-log property are known at the selected well locations. A statistical relationship in terms of cross plots (Fig.  9 a, b), either linear or non-linear, is developed at the well sites to relate the seismic response to the well-log response. The network will find the optimal (non-linear) mapping between seismic attributes and target well-log attributes such as porosity, volume of shale, hydrocarbon saturation, permeability, and net to gross. The advantages of MLPNN include: handling of larger sets of data such as geophysical SEGY and well-log data, higher number of activation neuron for processing, back propagation network by backing error, and adopting coefficient to overcome limitation of hidden layer, error is determined for each neuron, and it is applied for adopting weighting coefficient and activation value (Fig.  10). It is learning (training) and validating of the network is done with supervision and output can be statistically quantified (Table  2).|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} few years, {{numerous}} works addressed the deformation processes in carbonate rocks. These studies, generally sponsored by the oil industry, aimed {{to a better understanding}} of the structural and hydraulic properties of fault zones as well as of the subsurface fluid pathways in deformed carbonate rocks. This effort was mainly driven by the economic significance that carbonate rocks have for the oil industry, since they represent important natural reservoirs of hydrocarbons. According to the many field-based research scientific articles published in the recent past, both structural and hydraulic properties of fault zones, and their evolution trough time, exert a first order control on subsurface fluid flow and accumulation in fractured carbonate reservoirs. In order to convert this knowledge into predictive modeling tools that would help to optimize their exploitation, it should be useful to integrate the field-based data together with the subsurface data, which generally consist of core and well log (resistivity, acoustic, gamma ray etc.) analyses usually gathered to assess the formation evaluation of carbonate reservoir. The presented work aims at filling this cognitive gap by the acquisition and elaboration of subsurface geophysical properties of a hydrocarbon-bearing oblique normal fault zone characterized by 10 ’s of m offset, and cropping out in an exposed analogue of fractured carbonate reservoir (Maiella Mountain, Italy). The deformation mechanisms associated to the processes of fault nucleation and development within the Oligo-Miocene shallow-water carbonate rocks were documented in the recent past by our research group. In this present contribution, we present the results of our elaboration of the geophysical data, obtained from well logs oriented perpendicular to the study fault zone. These results are consistent with the following statements: a) there is a meaningful correlations between cores and digital images; b) a detailed structural analysis of the deformed carbonates can be performed by using well cores and digital image data; c) both matrix (primary) and fracture (secondary) porosities can be obtained from subsurface data; d) some possible relationships exist between secondary porosity and the measured log geophysical properties (P- and S-wave velocities, Resistivity). In conclusion, the results of this multi-disciplinary study, which involved the analyses of well logs, core and outcrop data of an <b>hydrocarbon-bearing</b> fault <b>zone</b> permitted us, therefore, to obtain useful correlation between fracture porosity and geophysical properties. We propose some practical solutions to compute the petrophysical parameters in order to assess both primary and secondary porosity in fractured carbonate reservoirs...|$|R
40|$|We have {{observed}} narrow-band, low-frequency (1. 5 - 4 Hz, amplitude 0. 01 - 10 mum/s) tremor signals {{on the surface}} over hydrocarbon reservoirs (oil, gas and water multiphase fluid systems in porous media) at currently 15 sites worldwide. These 'hydrocarbon tremors' possess remarkably similar spectral and signal structure characteristics, pointing to a common source mechanism, even though the depth (some hundreds to several thousands of meters), specific fluid content (oil, gas, gas condensate of different compositions and combinations) and reservoir rock type (such as sandstone. carbonates, etc.) for each of those sites are quite different. About half of the sites are fully explored or even developed and producing fields, and hard quantitative data on the reservoirs are available (well data, reservoir monitoring data, seismic surveys, etc.). The other areas are essentially either explored prospect areas where {{we did not have}} access to hard reservoir data or (in only one case) areas where no exploration wells have been drilled at all. The tremor signal itself was observed over ALL locations investigated so far. The signals weaken at the rim of the reservoirs and are not observed outside the reservoir area. There is a strong correlation of the tremor power with the thickness of the <b>hydrocarbon-bearing</b> layers ('pay <b>zone</b> thickness') determined by borehole log measurements. The overall correlation between surface tremor measurements and accessible subsurface well data is higher than 90 %. The phenomenological comparison of hydrocarbon tremor signals with volcanic tremor signals from Stromboli and Arenal volcanoes using both conventional spectral analysis tools and non-linear dynamics methods reveals fundamental similarities between those two phenomena as well as their close relation to bandpass filtered noise. Nevertheless, the specific signal sources are expected to be different for volcanoes and hydrocarbon reservoirs. Using the currently available data we present possible concepts (active or passive mechanisms) {{on the nature of the}} hydrocarbon tremor source. Our data lead us to conclude that we are most likely observing a characteristic filtering/mixing effect, with the energy input supplied by the natural seismo-acoustic background. The reservoir, i. e. the hydrocarbon-water-multifluid system contained in a porous medium, is expected to be the oscillatory element able to act as a filter/mixer (resembling essentially a in-reservoir path effect) for the natural seismo-acoustic background. Most intriguing seems the application aspect, i. e. the practical usability of this spectroscopic approach as a direct from-the-surface, non-invasive hydrocarbon indicator. (C) 2003 Elsevier B. V.
