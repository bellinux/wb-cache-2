25|$|On 21 November 1492, off {{the coast}} of Cuba, Pinzón failed to follow a direct order of Columbus to change course. He {{probably}} sailed off on his own trying to make individual discoveries and to find treasure, although Cesáreo Fernández Duro argues that the initial separation may have been accidental, a matter of missed signals. (Asensio takes Fernández Duro strongly to task for not adequately explaining the length of the separation; Fernández Duro responds that Pinzón simply continued the prior course, and if Columbus wanted, he should have <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> fair idea where to find him over the next several days.) During his separate travels he discovered new land; while all of the island geography of the first voyage is open to question, it is believed that the land was Haiti.|$|E

500|$|Originally, a [...] "time-consuming" [...] fight scene between Skinner and Krycek was {{supposed}} to take place. The scenes were cut because of time-constraints and budgetary reasons. However, Skinner's boxing match proved easy to stage. Mitch Pileggi, who had boxed competitively in college, went for [...] "refresher course" [...] at the Goosen Gym in Los Angeles. He later remarked, [...] "It makes me happy that some people will assume there was a stunt double in the ring. There wasn't! [...] We both <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> good time".

500|$|After {{an almost}} four-month delay, Oblivion went gold on March 2, 2006 and was {{released}} for Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 on March 21, 2006. Early rumors notwithstanding, Oblivion shipped on a single DVD-DL disc. One journalist voiced concern for the game's release date, as it was set in the same week as that of EA's [...] Hines dismissed the suggestion, saying, [...] "We {{tend to focus on}} what we can control and not worry about what we can't control. Given the level of interest and the number of pre-orders and so forth, we <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> good idea we'd be just fine no matter what else was happening that week." [...] Oblivion was the first RPG title to be released for Microsoft's Xbox 360 console. In addition to the standard release version, a Collector's Edition was released for both Windows and Xbox 360 which includes the 112-page Pocket Guide to the Empire, a bonus DVD containing concept art, renders, and an approximately 45-minute-long documentary on the making of Oblivion, and a coin replica of the in-game currency of Tamriel. Its suggested release price of US$69.99 brought back [...] "memories of game prices circa the Nintendo 64" [...] for one Kotaku commentator. Some suggested that the included coin be used to create a [...] "garish piece of jewelry".|$|E
500|$|Oxbow drew post {{position}} {{five for}} the Haskell, carried the highest weight at 122 pounds, {{and was the}} second favorite in the race behind Verrazano. [...] Leading for {{the early part of}} the race, Oxbow was challenged for the lead by Verrazano at the three-quarter-mile marker, then weakened and finished fourth, earning another $60,000. Stevens felt something was wrong with Oxbow at the half-mile pole, later saying the horse [...] "didn’t feel like he did in any of the Triple Crown races", and Lukas stated the jockey [...] "kind of held" [...] Oxbow from that point on. Oxbow was pulled up soon after crossing the finish line, then his rider jumped off and removed the saddle when Oxbow failed to jog sound on the track. [...] The horse walked back to the barn without obvious sign of injury, and radiographs of his right front ankle revealed no fracture, but he did have a soft tissue injury to the area, described as a [...] "sprain". Of Oxbow's overall health, Lukas commented, [...] "he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> set of X-rays. It's amazing. For a horse with that many , they were really clean." [...] Nonetheless, as a result of the soft tissue injury, Oxbow was taken out of races for the duration of the summer, and after three weeks of hand-walking at Saratoga was shipped home to Calumet in mid-August, with an announcement that he was not anticipated to run again in 2013. Lukas said: [...] "He's been a warrior and a hell of a nice horse for us and I don't want to do anything to jeopardize his future down the line." [...] On October 25, 2013, Calumet Farm announced the decision to retire Oxbow. Combined with his winnings in his two-year-old season, his lifetime race earnings were $1,243,500. [...] He stood at stud for the 2014 breeding season at [...] Taylor Made Farm in Lexington, Kentucky, for an introductory stud fee of $20,000. He closed out the year ranked 17th in earnings with $1,146,000 won in 2013. For the 2015 season he moves to Calumet Farms, where he joins seven other stallions, including English Channel, who sired 2014 Travers Stakes winner V.E. Day.|$|E

2500|$|Prior to the {{football}} matchup against the University of Colorado on November 12, 2005 a tornado touched down in Ames, Iowa and forced fans to either stand out {{in the parking lot}} and watch the storm or flee to shelter in Hilton Coliseum.

2500|$|Away they went, thunder-and-turf, out the Canal Road. Coutts took [...] Saucel {{at about}} his usual , and {{he slid the}} whole crowd in [...] "The Shebeen" [...] under the table.

Right out at the cow's tail and getting all the wag, the {{distinguished}} party <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> stormy trip {{all the way to}} Ayr, at which point the murder of Coutts was strongly advocated. But when they found that Coutts had actually lost a minute to Paisley, they began to think something must be wrong with the routing, so the 5.10 was altered to run via the Glasgow and Paisley Joint Line, which was at least straight.|$|E
2500|$|Despite criticisms that Gibson {{deliberately}} added {{additional material}} to the historical accounts of first-century Judea and biblical accounts of Christ's crucifixion, some scholars defend the film as not being primarily concerned with historical accuracy. Biblical scholar Mark Goodacre protested {{that he could not}} find one documented example of Gibson explicitly claiming the film to be historically accurate. Gibson has been quoted as saying: [...] "I think that my first duty is to be as faithful as possible in telling the story so that it doesn't contradict the Scriptures. Now, so long as it didn't do that, I felt that I <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> wide berth for artistic interpretation, and to fill in some of the spaces with logic, with imagination, with various other readings." ...|$|E

However the character from Fantasia which Tytla {{is better known}} for is Chernabog, {{his own version of}} Crnobog the Black God, from the [...] "Night on Bald Mountain" [...] sequence. It is often said that Chernabog was based on actor Bela Lugosi, and Walt did bring him in to do live action reference for the character. However, Bill already <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> good idea of {{what he wanted to do}} and did not like Bela's interpretation of the character. Instead he had Wilfred Jackson (who is credited for the music of Steamboat Willie) act out the part for him, and that is what he used as live action reference.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the last}} cannon shots fired that day hit Paget in the right leg, necessitating its {{amputation}}.

[...] — to which Wellington replied, [...] "By God, sir, so you have!" [...] According to his aide-de-camp, Thomas Wildman, during the amputation Paget smiled and said, [...] "I have <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> long run. I have been a beau these 47 years and it would not be fair to cut the young men out any longer." [...] While Paget had an articulated artificial limb fitted, his amputated leg meanwhile had a somewhat macabre after-life as a tourist attraction in the village of Waterloo in Belgium, to which it had been removed and where it was later interred.|$|E
2500|$|In January 1912 Jack Joyce's Wild West Show was {{appearing}} at Coliseum in London. Later, in May of that year, {{it was the}} big attraction at the New Hippodrome Palast in Berlin. The popular American cowboy had with him about a half dozen boys from Texas and a troupe of fake Indians. The [...] "demand for a wild west show {{is so great that}} the Germans don't worry about the genuineness of the red skin--all they want is the excitement connected with the show." [...] Joyce <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> strong feeling for cowgirls. Although they were not easily found in Berlin, he did not worry. He made a selection among a throng of Berlin maidens and trained them to be cowgirls. In 1916 Jack Joyce was doing well with his circus and wild west show touring Sweden.

Omie, however, was seeing a ne'er-do-well named John Lewis, who never meant anything about anything serious, except some of his meanness. John Lewis courted the girl, seemingly until she became pregnant, and he decided that he'd get rid of her in some secret sort of way. He persuaded her to skip off with him and get married, then pushed her into the water and drowned her. Everyone knew that he had been mean to Omie, and when the body was taken out of the water, there was evidence that she had been beaten quite a lot." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1976, Balderstone {{was called}} into the England Test team to make his {{international}} debut aged 35 having focused in his younger days on football. Against other international sides he might have played more Tests, for he was chosen {{on the strength of}} consistent quality performances for Leicestershire. It was his misfortune, however, to come up against the West Indies just as they were reaching that level of intimidation they were to maintain for the next two decades. Against the fearsome pace of Andy Roberts and Michael Holding he struggled, like so many other English batsmen: his four innings produced only 39 runs. He did though score 35 from sticking it out for 3½ hours at the crease on his test debut. In his second test, at a parched Oval, he encountered Michael Holding and one of the finest individual fast-bowling performances in history – Holding took 14 wickets in the test. [...] Opposing fast bowler Vanburn Holder later said, [...] "I played against him when we <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> ferocious attack and he never blinked. He had plenty of courage." ...|$|E
2500|$|Zombie was {{responsible}} for writing all of the album's songs, while he initially worked with Nine Inch Nails member Charlie Clouser to produce the album.

Clouser claimed [...] "It was me and him with a computer, {{trying to figure out}} a direction we wanted to go in. We <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> good idea of the kind of elements that would be included and an overall concept of the segues between songs and the musical interludes. We even started coming up with the core riffs for the album." [...] Early into the process of recording the album, Clouser became unable to work on the album due to other obligations; however, he recommended that Zombie worked with Scott Humphrey {{for the remainder of the}} album. Humphrey had previously worked with artists such as Metallica prior to producing the album. Due to his departure, the only song on the album produced by Clouser is [...] "Superbeast". Zombie stated that making the album was [...] "weird", and he didn't believe it would do well, as [...] "most debut solo records don't." ...|$|E
