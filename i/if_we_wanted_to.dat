500|$|With {{over twenty}} years of {{parliamentary}} majorities, Liberal ministers did as they wished {{with little regard for}} the opposition parties. The Mackenzie King and St. Laurent governments laid the groundwork for the welfare state, a development initially opposed by many Tories. C.D. Howe, considered one of the leading forces of the St. Laurent government, told his Tory opponents when they alleged that the Liberals would abolish tariffs if the people would let them, [...] "Who would stop us?...

500|$|Like his {{predecessor}} Helen Clark, Key views a New Zealand republic as [...] "inevitable", although probably not for another decade. [...] "If Australia becomes a republic {{there is no}} question it will set off quite an intense debate {{on this side of the}} Tasman", he said. [...] "We would have to have a referendum <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> move towards it." [...] Key later stated that he is a monarchist, and that a New Zealand republic would [...] "Not [...] under my watch". In 2009 Key announced the restoration of titular honours, including knighthoods and damehoods—the abolishment of these titles in 2000 had been seen as an advancement towards republicanism.|$|E
500|$|Sales of the Anarky limited series {{were high}} enough to green light an ongoing series, with Breyfogle commenting, [...] " [...] did well enough so that DC is {{willing to listen to}} Alan’s idea for a sequel <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> pitch them." [...] However, despite the sales, Grant was still {{concerned}} the character lacked enough support among fans to sustain an ongoing series. While the ongoing series did find an audience amongst Latin American nations—Mexico and Argentina in particular—it failed in the United States, where Alan Grant has lamented that the comic was doomed to eventual cancellation, as DC Comics [...] " [...] take foreign sales into consideration when counting their cash".|$|E

I love her voice and I love her style. Long story short, we got her a copy of the song and she loved it. As soon as she started singing, it became obvious {{it was going to be}} great." ...|$|E
500|$|The early 1950s saw {{an era of}} {{prosperity}} in Canada; in most years there was a government surplus. In 1951, the Government introduced an old age pension for Canadians to receive {{from the age of}} 70. With little unemployment and thus a surplus in the unemployment insurance fund, coverage was extended to seasonal workers, such as fishermen. St. Laurent's supervision of his ministers was minimal at the start of his tenure, and decreased as the years passed. With the Opposition few in numbers, ministers did as they wanted, and when Howe was accused by British Columbia Tory MP Howard Green in 1951 of being willing to end tariffs if the people would let him, Howe replied, [...] "Who would stop us?

Linnell responded that they [...] "were in this band, we're making this record, and we're going to start touring next year...They were particularly interested in that, because they said that 1992 was ISY.

On ISIS he stated [...] "We do cross paths ... but what stops us from meeting is that even <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to,</b> they would not accept because they consider the Ba'ath infidels". He used the word Daesh, an Arab acronym considered derogatory by ISIS, and claimed that the group was detaining a third of the Ba'ath's command. Al-Douri then went on to claim the number of ISIS victims in Iraq [...] "does not equal 1% of those killed by the militias". On Iran, al-Douri called for the [...] "Iraqis in Al-Anbar and Karbala to strongly fight the Persian criminal plan, which aims at swallowing Iraq."

2500|$|The band toured Australian {{to promote}} the album, then {{returned}} to Europe, frustrated with low album sales and their inability to gain traction on Australian radio. The following year they were dropped by Sony and forced to curtail European touring. Aya told The Sun-Herald it was a setback that almost brought the band to an end. [...] "Chin Chin didn't go {{as well as we}} hoped it would and we felt the band's future had been discounted. It brought about a period where we questioned <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> write together any more.

2500|$|We weren't {{trying not}} {{to put out a}} record. It was just one thing after another and time flew by. When you don't do your band like a career like us, you've got other things to do than worry about getting records made. If you don't put a {{deadline}} on it, it may never get done. Like us, you turn around and it's been six years. The first year or two after the last record, we were still touring and not thinking about making an album. Then, in the third year, we were busy and it took a few months to write and get in the studio. There's lag time at the label and then it's winter... It just goes on and on. When NOFX asked us <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> go on the road with them, {{we thought it would be}} fun, but we thought it would be better if we had the record finished. We hadn't planned on being done in October. It was for later in the year, so we had to kick it in high gear and get into the studio. Everything worked backwards from there 'cause if we had fucked it up, we'd be looking at 2009 before the album was done. That deadline really got it all together, but it was only a matter of a few weeks. We'd planned to go into the studio three weeks after we actually did. We'd have only rehearsed with the luxury time, so we were ready. Most of [...] the last 12 months, so it's a new record, not stuff we were sitting on and hadn't recorded. It's also not like we were writing these songs for the last six years. Once we were ready, it came together surprisingly quickly, and I think people will be kind of shocked but happy with the results.|$|E
2500|$|Although Bill and I {{performed}} {{at a very}} young age, and Bill, I, Barry and John did a lot of frat parties at Brown University and clubs in Newport ... the most memorable performance of what I would view as the precursor of what The Cowsills would be was at Kings Park in Newport (right at the foot of Halidon Hall) at some carnival. The family angle just evolved ... first Bill and me, then Bill me and Barry, then Bill, me, Barry and John, then Bill, me, Barry, John and Mom, then Bill, me, Barry, John, Mom and Paul, then later, me, Paul, John, Barry, Mom and Susan, then back to Bill, me, Barry and John (very briefly in the end) and then to me, Paul, John and Susan.

Mercury dropped us, but Artie and Steve had written [...] "The Rain, The Park and Other Things" [...] and we went in and recorded that song at A studios in New York and took the whole package to MGM, who decided wouldn't it just be terrific if their mother performed with them and, voila, the rest, as they say, is history.|$|E
