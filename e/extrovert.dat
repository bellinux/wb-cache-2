30|$|Unexpected {{differences}} in the online behavior of <b>extroverts</b> and introverts is observed based on these questions. Introverts post more frequently than do <b>extroverts,</b> especially during the day. However, <b>extroverts</b> visit different cities rather than staying in one familiar city as introverts do. The spatial discrepancy becomes more unintuitive as we zoom in to increased resolution. For example, introverts tend to check in while shopping, whereas <b>extroverts</b> enjoy posting from their workplace. In addition, {{a tiny fraction of}} introverts might attempt to camouflage their own loneliness by tweeting from a large number of different areas (> 20). <b>Extroverts</b> enjoy sharing music and selfies, whereas introverts prefer retweeting news. In terms of online interactions, <b>extroverts</b> mention friends more often than introverts do, implying higher social vibrancy. By presenting a purchasing index to depict online buying intention, we find that compared to <b>extroverts,</b> introverts devote more effort to posting shopping tweets to relieve loneliness {{due to a lack of}} social interaction with others. We also categorize the emotion delivered by tweets into anger, disgust, happiness, sadness, and fear [23] and find that introverts post more angry and fearful (high arousal) tweets while <b>extroverts</b> post more sad (low arousal) tweets. Finally, <b>extroverts</b> attach greater meaning to online virtual honor than introverts do, implying that they might be ideal candidates for online promotion campaigns with virtual honor. To the our best knowledge, this is the first study to thoroughly compare the online behavior of <b>extroverts</b> and introverts in a large-scale sample, and our findings will be helpful to understand the role of personality in shaping human behavior.|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} {{research}} {{is to find out}} the relation between social support contribution and <b>extroverting</b> level in relation with depression on disabled athlete. The population of research was taken from disabled athlete that belongs to the member of National Paralympic Committee Surakarta, from June until August 2014. It consists of 45 disabled athlete. It used total sampling technique. Data collection was taken from social support scale, <b>extroverting</b> level scale, and depression scale. Analysis method was using double regression analysis and chow test. Based on the research can be concluded that there was negative relation between social support, <b>extroverting</b> level, and depression on disabled athlete. Social support and <b>extroverting</b> level had low effect on the other hand depression factor contributed high effect. The result of the analysis showed that depression gave 2. 9 % and <b>extroverting</b> contributed 15. 4 % on depression. Totally social support and <b>extroverting</b> level had contributed about 18. 3 % on depression. There is no significant difference between men and women on social support and <b>extroverting</b> level on depressio...|$|R

The present study examined the effects of quick tempo vocal and non-vocal background music on memory performance in <b>extroverts</b> and introverts. In the presence of either quick tempo vocal or non-vocal background music introverts and <b>extroverts</b> were given a list of 20 moderately memorable nouns to memorize and recall. Both <b>extroverts</b> and introverts had 1 minute to memorize a list and 2 minutes to recall the words. It was hypothesized that <b>extroverts</b> would recall more nouns in the quick tempo non-vocal condition and that introverts would recall significantly less than <b>extroverts</b> in both the quick tempo vocal and non-vocal conditions. One main effect was found for the musical condition in which both <b>extroverts</b> and introverts recalled more nouns in the quick tempo vocal condition. No other significant results were found...|$|R

5000|$|By Jung's rules, 16 {{psychological}} types exist. But in {{his book}} [...] "Psychological Types" [...] he described in detail only 8, distinguished by the 8 possible dominant functions. Contrary to Socionics and MBTI, Jung did not conclude that the types had two introverted functions and two <b>extroverted</b> functions. He instead outlined that <b>extroverted</b> personality types had a Dominant <b>extroverted</b> function, an Auxiliary introverted function, and two Inferior introverted functions that are necessarily retarded.|$|R
50|$|Eysenck's {{theory of}} arousal {{describes}} the different natural frequency or arousal {{states of the}} brains {{of people who are}} introverted versus people who are <b>extroverted.</b> The theory states that the brains of <b>extroverts</b> are naturally less stimulated, so these types have a predisposition to seek out situations and partake in behaviors that will stimulate arousal. Whereas <b>extroverts</b> are naturally under-stimulated and therefore actively engage in arousing situations, introverts are naturally over-stimulated and therefore avoid intense arousal. Campbell and Hawley (1982) studied the differences in introverts versus <b>extroverts</b> responses to particular work environments in the library. The study found that introverts were more likely to choose quiet areas with minimal to no noise or people. <b>Extroverts</b> were more likely to choose areas with much activity with more noise and people. Daoussiss and McKelvie's (1986) research showed that introverts performed worse on memory tasks when they were in the presence of music compared to silence. <b>Extroverts</b> were less affected by the presence of music. Similarly, Belojevic, Slepcevic and Jokovljevic (2001) found that introverts had more concentration problems and fatigue in their mental processing when work was coupled with external noise or distracting factors. The level of arousal surrounding the individuals greatly affected their ability to perform tasks and behaviors, with the introverts being more affected than the <b>extroverts,</b> because of each's naturally high and low levels of stimulation, respectively.|$|R
25|$|Researchers Campbell and Hawley (1982) {{provided}} {{evidence of the}} regulation of arousal differences between introverts and <b>extroverts.</b> They found that when studying in a library, <b>extroverts</b> {{were more likely to}} choose to work in areas with bustle and activity, while introverts were more likely to choose a quiet, secluded area. Accordingly, Adrian Furnham and Anna Bradley discovered that introverts presented with music at the time of two cognitive tasks (prose recall and reading comprehension) performed significantly worse on a test of memory recall than <b>extroverts</b> who were also presented with music {{at the time of the}} tasks. However, if music was not present at the time of the tasks, introverts and <b>extroverts</b> performed at the same level.|$|R

25|$|The popular Itihasas {{and other}} legendary {{literature}} of the Hindu traditions present two major Lakshmi avatars – Radha and Sita, and two major Vishnu avatars as their respective companions – Krishna in the Mahabharata and Rama in the Ramayana. The Radha-Krishna and Sita-Rama pairs represent two different personality sets, two perspectives on dharma and lifestyles, both cherished {{in the way of}} life called Hinduism. Sita is traditionally wedded, dedicated, and virtuous wife of Rama, an introspective temperate paragon of a serious, virtuous man. Radha is sensuous unmarried clandestine lover of Krishna, an <b>extrovert</b> polyamorous playful adventurer.|$|E

30|$|Social interactions. Highly <b>extroverted</b> {{individuals}} {{tend to have}} broad social communications [26] {{and large}} network size [51]. For instance, extraversion is generally positively related {{to the number of}} Facebook friends [52, 53]. Gosling et al. also found particularly strong consensus about Facebook profile-based personality assessment for extroverts [54]. However, Ross et al. showed that <b>extroverts</b> are not necessarily associated with more Facebook friends [4], which is contrary to the later results of Bachrach et al. [52] and Hamburger et al. [53]. Through posting tweets, <b>extroverts</b> are more actively sharing their lives and feelings with other people, and personality traits might shape the language styles used on social media. In English, <b>extroverts</b> are more likely to mention social words such as ‘party’ and ‘love you’, whereas introverts are more likely to mention words related to solitary activities such as ‘computer’ and ‘Internet’ [46]. In Chinese, extraversion is positively correlated with personal pronouns, indicating that <b>extroverts</b> tend to be more concerned about others [55].|$|R
40|$|Abstract   ”I hate you!” -         An {{essay about}} {{preschool}} teacher's challenges with <b>extroverted</b> children   Behavior problems among <b>extroverted</b> preschool-aged {{children have been}} subject to a lively debate for many years. Research in this area is extensive. Preschool teachers have a lot of information available to them about how <b>extroverted</b> children should be interacted with in practice. However, many important issues remain unanswered. One of these issues concerns the subjective feelings that arise in the preschool teacher in its meeting with an <b>extroverted</b> child. The subjective feelings may give rise to unprofessional behavior and thus becoming an obstacle.                                                                                                                                            This scientific essay concerns two similar situations in which <b>extroverted</b> children are the focus, but where I as a teacher react differently in each situation. My aim has been to highlight {{the extent to which the}} teacher's feelings - in this case my own - prevents the preschool teacher to sustain a professional behavior towards <b>extroverted</b> child. In the first situation, I acted instinctively, driven by fear of the children’s and my own safety. In the second situation, I could act more professionally.                       In this paper, I reflect on the reasons why I, as a preschool teacher and educator, reacted differently in the two situations. Furthermore, I reflect on what importance the preschool teacher's knowledge of <b>extroverted</b> children may have for the teacher’s treatment and interactions with these children. In addition, I seek to analyze reactions and perceptions that arise in the two situations...|$|R
5000|$|Extraversion {{is another}} good {{predictor}} of music genre preference and music use. Energetic <b>extroverts</b> {{have been linked}} to preferences in happy, upbeat and conventional music, as well as energetic and rhythmic music, such as rap, hip hop, soul, electronic, and dance music. [...] Additionally, <b>extroverts</b> tend to listen to music more and have background music present in their lives more often. One study compared introverts and <b>extroverts</b> to see who would be more easily distracted by background music with and without lyrics. It was assumed that since <b>extroverts</b> listen to background music more {{they would be able to}} tune it out better, but that was proved untrue. No matter how much music people listen to they are still equally affected and distracted by music with lyrics. Cheerful music with fast tempos, many melodic themes, and vocals are also preferred by <b>extroverts.</b> They are more likely than others to listen to music in the background while doing other activities, such as running, being with friends, or studying. This group also tends to use music to counter the monotony of everyday tasks, such as ironing. [...] In a Turkish study, researchers found that <b>extroverts</b> preferred rock, pop, and rap because these genres facilitated dance and movement.|$|R
25|$|In 1916, Maugham {{travelled}} to the Pacific {{to research}} his novel The Moon and Sixpence, {{based on the}} life of Paul Gauguin. This was the first of his journeys through the late-Imperial world of the 1920s and 1930s which inspired his novels. He became known as a writer who portrayed the last days of colonialism in India, Southeast Asia, China and the Pacific, although the books on which this reputation rests represent only a fraction of his output. On this and all subsequent journeys, he was accompanied by Haxton, whom he regarded as indispensable to his success as a writer. Maugham was painfully shy, and Haxton the <b>extrovert</b> gathered human material which the author converted to fiction.|$|E
25|$|The Central Library {{consisted}} of two elements: the <b>extrovert</b> lending library and the introvert reference library. The lending library was designed for heavy use and short visits. It formed a wing to the reference library and was of three storeys with a curved façade facing the Town Hall. The reference library was an eight-storey square block designed around an open atrium above a public square {{that was designed to}} be entered from four sides. Above the square floated the cantilevered floors of the library in a distinctive inverted ziggurat formation. The designers drew inspiration for the design from Antonio Sant'Elia's drawings of Casa a gradinata, and Marcel Breuer's 1928 scheme for a hospital at Elberfeld, Indiana; while another source of inspiration was Leslie Martin's Bodleian Law Library in Oxford. It has also been suggested that they were influenced by the similar design for Boston City Hall, but a member of Madin’s design team said they had only seen this design after the library was complete.|$|E
25|$|Jung {{was one of}} {{the first}} people to define {{introversion}} and extraversion in a psychological context. In Jung’s Psychological Types, he theorizes that each person falls into one of two categories, the introvert and the extravert. These two psychological types Jung compares to ancient archetypes, Apollo and Dionysus. The introvert is likened with Apollo, who shines light on understanding. The introvert is focused on the internal world of reflection, dreaming and vision. Thoughtful and insightful, the introvert can sometimes be uninterested in joining the activities of others. The extravert is associated with Dionysus, interested in joining the activities of the world. The extravert is focused on the outside world of objects, sensory perception and action. Energetic and lively, the <b>extrovert</b> may lose their sense of self in the intoxication of Dionysian pursuits. Jungian introversion and extraversion is quite different from the modern idea of introversion and extroversion. Modern theories often stay true to behaviourist means of describing such a trait (sociability, talkativeness, assertiveness etc.) whereas Jungian introversion and extraversion is expressed as a perspective: introverts interpret the world subjectively, whereas extraverts interpret the world objectively.|$|E

30|$|Emotion expression. In psychology, it {{is widely}} {{believed}} that extraversion is associated with higher positive affect, namely, <b>extroverts</b> experience increased positive emotions [59, 60]. <b>Extroverts</b> {{are also more likely to}} utilize the supplementary entertainment services provided by social media, which bring them more happiness [61]. Qiu et al. suggested that highly <b>extroverted</b> participants use these services to relieve their existential anxiety about social media [62]. Thus, it is necessary to investigate the relation between various emotions and extraversion rather than only positive affect. However, most existing studies based their conclusions on self-reports from very small samples, and the lack of data and objectivity leads to inconsistent or even conflicting results. Moreover, a comprehensive understanding of how <b>extroverts</b> and introverts behave differently in the context of online social media remains unclear.
