50|$|In the U.S., {{trisodium}} phosphate is an approved flux {{for use in}} <b>hard</b> <b>soldering</b> joints in medical grade copper plumbing. The flux is applied as a concentrated water solution and dissolves copper oxides at the temperature used in copper brazing. Residues are water-soluble and can be rinsed out before plumbing is put into service.|$|E
5000|$|Soldering and brazing {{processes}} rely on {{a filler}} metal added to the joint to form the junction between the base metal parts. Soft soldering uses a filler that melts at a lower temperature than the workpiece, often a lead-tin solder alloy. Brazing and <b>hard</b> <b>soldering</b> use a higher temperature filler that melts at a temperature which may approach that of the base metal, and which may form a eutectic alloy with the base metal.|$|E

40|$|During {{the last}} years high power diode lasers have become {{increasingly}} established for direct material processing. The advantages are the high efficiency (more than 50 %) and long lifetime of more than 10. 000 h. An important factor believed {{to be responsible for}} the aging of diode lasers is the thermo-mechanical stress. High stress levels arise from the packaging process. The mismatch between the thermal expansion coefficient of the heat sink (typically copper 16. 5 × 10 - 6 K- 1) and the laserbar (GaAs 6. 7 × 10 - 6 K- 1) cause high mechanical stress. The change in length during the cooling process of a 10 mm wide laserbar is more than 10 m. If a <b>hard</b> <b>solder</b> is used, the stress is much higher, because <b>hard</b> <b>solder</b> typically has a higher melting point and stress can not be reduced by relaxation. Typically material with lower thermal expansion coefficient have a lower thermal conductivity than copper. This increases the thermal load of the laserbar, which decreases the life-time in this sense. The expansion-matching and the lower thermal conductivity of this material are working against each other. In order to find a good compromise, different active cooled expansion matched heat sinks are simulated. Very promising heat sinks have been fabricated and characterized. Also the solder selection has influence on the long term stability. A very soft solder is more critical in terms of long term stability. A higher diffusion takes place, so that the properties of the solder change during the lifetime of the diode-laser. <b>Hard</b> <b>solder,</b> especially AuSn, are well tested solders with a very high long term stability, (no changes of the intermetallic structure even at higher temperature) The disadvantage of the <b>hard</b> <b>solder</b> is the incapability to reduce the mechanical stress through relaxation. Different solders are being used and investigated...|$|R

5000|$|Spelter, while {{sometimes}} used {{merely as a}} synonym for zinc, {{is often used to}} identify a zinc alloy. In this sense it might be an alloy of equal parts copper and zinc, i.e. a brass, used for <b>hard</b> <b>soldering</b> and brazing, or as an alloy, containing lead, that is used instead of bronze. In this usage it was common for many 19th-century cheap, cast articles such as candlesticks and clock cases and early 20th-century Art Nouveau ornaments and Art Deco figures.|$|E
50|$|Different {{equipment}} is usually required since {{a soldering iron}} cannot achieve high enough temperatures for <b>hard</b> <b>soldering</b> or brazing. Brazing filler metal is stronger than silver solder, which is stronger than lead-based soft solder. Brazing solders are formulated primarily for strength, silver solder is used by jewelers to protect the precious metal and by machinists and refrigeration technicians for its tensile strength but lower melting temperature than brazing, and the primary benefit of soft solder is the low temperature used (to prevent heat damage to electronic components and insulation).|$|E
50|$|Brazing (sometimes {{known as}} silver {{soldering}} or <b>hard</b> <b>soldering)</b> requires {{a much higher}} temperature than soft soldering, sometimes over 850 °C. As well as removing existing oxides, rapid oxidation of the metal at the elevated temperatures has to be avoided. This means that fluxes {{need to be more}} aggressive and to provide a physical barrier. Traditionally borax was used as a flux for brazing, but there are now many different fluxes available, often using active chemicals such as fluorides as well as wetting agents. Many of these chemicals are toxic and due care should be taken during their use.|$|E

40|$|Thermal {{stress is}} an {{influential}} {{factor for the}} reliability of HPDL and their optical properties.

In reflow process and working process, <b>hard</b> <b>solder</b> package suffers higher thermal stress. Thermal stress mainly comes from reflow process.

50|$|Gold solder is {{used for}} joining the {{components}} of gold jewelry by high-temperature <b>hard</b> <b>soldering</b> or brazing. If the work is to be of hallmarking quality, the gold solder alloy must match the fineness (purity) of the work, and alloy formulas are manufactured to color-match yellow and white gold. Gold solder is usually made {{in at least three}} melting-point ranges referred to as Easy, Medium and Hard. By using the hard, high-melting point solder first, followed by solders with progressively lower melting points, goldsmiths can assemble complex items with several separate soldered joints. Gold can also be made into thread and used in embroidery.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are three}} basic {{techniques}} {{that may be}} used to attach granules to a metal surface: <b>hard</b> <b>soldering,</b> fusing and colloidal soldering. The metals used in granulation are usually gold and/or silver alloys of high purity - alloys below 18 kt. gold and sterling silver being unsuitable. With each technique the process begins with the making of the granules themselves. The granules are usually made from the same material as the base to which they will be affixed. Very narrow fringes may be cut along the edge of a thin sheet of metal, a further cut producing small squares or rectangles of metal. After being melted into globules, these may be sorted into various sizes by the use of appropriate meshes. Another option is to use thin wire coiled around a mandrel, the coil then being cut into small rings - this creates even-sized granules when melted.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hard</b> <b>soldering</b> metal items {{together}} exploits the {{capillary action}} of solder {{with a lower}} melting point flowing between the items to be bonded. Soldering is routinely used by bench jewellers and is an ancient technique, but is applied with great difficulty to small metal grains. Extremely small pieces of solder are positioned close {{to the point of}} contact between the granule and the metal, and then heated to melting point. The necessity of repeating this process many hundreds of times renders the technique impractical and expensive, complicated by the possibility of dislodging granules already attached. An improvement to this method is filing the solder to powder size and mixing it with the flux. The work area is painted with tragacanth and the granules are bedded on this using a fine brush. Having dried, the work is sprinkled with the flux-solder powder and heated to melting point. Surplus solder will lodge in the gaps between the granules, an effect which cannot be avoided.|$|E

50|$|One of the {{problems}} increasingly facing Museum during the 20th century was the appearance of forged antiquities on the art market. Even {{before the advent of}} widespread forging, museums had to contend with antiquities that had been expertly 'restored' to make them more attractive. These restorations were often 'fanciful' and not true to the original. At the British Museum, the recruitment of scientists to research conservation processes - the first being Dr Harold Plenderleith MC OBE FBA (1898-1997) - opened up the possibility of using this in-house scientific expertise to investigate the authenticity of antiquities. Starting in the 1930s, Plenderleith and his successors increasingly employed chemical analysis, x-ray diffraction, X radiography, microscopy, and metallurgical techniques to try and show that all the physical aspects of an object being investigated were consistent with its supposed age. For example, finding a copper nitrate 'corrosion product' on the surface of a bronze would condemn it as almost certainly modern. Other examples would be the identification of modern <b>hard</b> <b>soldering</b> products that had been used to assemble jewellery or the presence of corrosion products which had been ground up and stuck onto the surface of a recently-made object. On the whole the British Museum has not published the details of the forensic work on antiquities for obvious reasons.|$|E

Enameling solder has a high melting point, close to that of the material itself, to prevent the joint desoldering during firing in the enameling process. The remaining solder types are used in decreasing order of hardness during the process of making an item, to prevent a previously soldered seam or joint desoldering while additional sites are soldered. Easy solder is also often used for repair work for the same reason. Flux or rouge is also used to prevent joints from desoldering.|$|R
