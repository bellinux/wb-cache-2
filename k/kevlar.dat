5|$|One of {{the design}} intents of the SS190 variety of this {{cartridge}} was that it {{have the ability to}} penetrate <b>Kevlar</b> protective vests—such as the NATO CRISAT vest—that will stop conventional pistol bullets. Fired from the P90, the SS190 is capable of penetrating the CRISAT vest at a range of 200m (219yd), or a Level IIIA <b>Kevlar</b> vest at the same range. However, sporting variants of the 5.7×28mm are classified by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) as not armor-piercing.|$|E
5|$|When {{fired from}} the FN P90, the 5.7×28mm SS190 can {{penetrate}} the NATO CRISAT vest or a Level IIIA <b>Kevlar</b> vest at a range of 200 m (219 yd).|$|E
5|$|In 2009, five Merlin Mk3s were {{operating}} in Afghanistan, transporting troops and supplies. The deployment to Afghanistan was criticised as the aircraft reportedly lacked protective <b>Kevlar</b> armour. By July 2010, the Merlin fleet was fully fitted with ballistic armour. The deployment of Merlins to Afghanistan allowed the detachment of Sea Kings {{to be withdrawn}} from the region in October 2011. As part of the UK drawdown in Afghanistan, Merlins were withdrawn from theatre in June 2013.|$|E
5|$|In October 2011, {{following}} {{several years}} of service in Afghanistan as troop transports for the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) forces stationed there, the Sea King HC.4s returned to the UK; their replacement is the AgustaWestland AW101 Merlin. Between April 2009 and July 2011, the Royal Navy's Sea Kings stationed at Camp Bastion conducted over 1000 operational missions. The initial Afghan deployment had been criticised as the Sea Kings had not been fitted with protective <b>Kevlar</b> armour.|$|E
5|$|In testing done by Houston Police Department SWAT, the SS190 {{fired from}} the P90 into bare {{ballistic}} gelatin exhibited penetration depths ranging from 28 to 34cm (11 to 13.5in). In testing in 1999 by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), the SS190 {{fired from the}} P90 {{at a distance of}} 25m (27yd) exhibited an average penetration depth of 25cm (9.85in) in ballistic gelatin after passing through a Level II <b>Kevlar</b> vest.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from its}} use in {{fertilisers}} and energy-stores, nitrogen is a constituent of organic compounds as diverse as <b>Kevlar</b> used in high-strength fabric and cyanoacrylate used in superglue. Nitrogen is a constituent of every major pharmacological drug class, including antibiotics. Many drugs are mimics or prodrugs of natural nitrogen-containing signal molecules: for example, the organic nitrates nitroglycerin and nitroprusside control blood pressure by metabolizing into nitric oxide. Many notable nitrogen-containing drugs, such as the natural caffeine and morphine or the synthetic amphetamines, act on receptors of animal neurotransmitters.|$|E
5|$|Bernier {{went on to}} win his {{election}} in Beauce with 62% of the vote. Harper won re-election as prime-minister; he did not appoint Bernier to a cabinet position. Bernier would eventually return to the cabinet following the 2011 election, in which the Conservatives won a majority government, as Minister of State for Small Business and Tourism. Bernier continues to sit as an MP, and is currently a candidate for the Conservative Party leadership. Stemming from Couillard's actions during the entire affair, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) launched investigations on how she obtained the secret documents; on whether Couillard's mother was offered a patronage appointment by a Conservative Party official to the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada; and on whether there was influence peddling during the land sale between the <b>Kevlar</b> Group and Public Works.|$|E
25|$|<b>Kevlar</b> {{has also}} {{been found to have}} useful {{acoustic}} properties for loudspeaker cones, specifically for bass and midrange drive units. Additionally, <b>Kevlar</b> {{has been used as a}} strength member in fiber optic cables such as the ones used for audio data transmissions.|$|E
25|$|<b>Kevlar</b> is the {{registered}} trademark for a light, strong para-aramid synthetic fiber. Typically it is spun into ropes or fabric sheets {{that can be}} used as such or as an ingredient in composite material components. Currently, <b>Kevlar</b> has many applications, ranging from bicycle tires and racing sails to body armor because of its high strength-to-weight ratio. Invented at DuPont in 1965 by Stephanie Kwolek, <b>Kevlar</b> was first commercially used in the early 1970s as a replacement for steel in racing tires.|$|E
25|$|<b>Kevlar</b> {{is used in}} the woodwind reeds of Fibracell. The {{material}} of these reeds is a composite of aerospace materials designed to duplicate the way nature constructs cane reed. Very stiff but sound absorbing <b>Kevlar</b> fibers are suspended in a lightweight resin formulation.|$|E
25|$|Wicks {{for fire}} dancing props {{are made of}} {{composite}} materials with <b>Kevlar</b> in them. <b>Kevlar</b> by itself does not absorb fuel very well, so it is blended with other materials such as fiberglass or cotton. Kevlar's high heat resistance allows the wicks to be reused many times.|$|E
25|$|<b>Kevlar</b> K49 – {{high modulus}} used in cable and rope products.|$|E

25|$|Continental AG have {{manufactured}} cycle tyres with <b>Kevlar</b> {{to protect}} again punctures.|$|E
25|$|Stephanie Kwolek, a {{researcher}} at DuPont, invented poly-paraphenylene terephthalamide – better known as <b>Kevlar.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Kevlar</b> is {{sometimes}} {{used as a}} substitute for Teflon in some non-stick frying pans.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, with advancements in technology, Nike used <b>Kevlar</b> in {{shoes for}} the first time. It {{launched}} the Elite II Series, with enhancements to its earlier version of basketball shoes by using <b>Kevlar</b> in the anterior {{as well as the}} shoe laces. This was done to decrease the elasticity of the tip of the shoe in contrast to nylon used conventionally as <b>Kevlar</b> expanded by about 1% against nylon which expanded by about 30%. Shoes in this range included LeBron, HyperDunk and Zoom Kobe VII. However these shoes were launched at a price range much higher than average cost of basketball shoes. It was also used in the laces for the adidas F50 adiZero Prime football boot.|$|E
25|$|<b>Kevlar</b> K-29 – in {{industrial}} applications, such as cables, asbestos replacement, brake linings, and body/vehicle armor.|$|E
25|$|QKE: LD3 same as AKE {{but made}} of <b>KEVLAR</b> and {{designed}} to be bombproof. No forklift holes.|$|E
25|$|Their {{equipment}} {{consists of}} knee protectors, <b>kevlar</b> helmets and anti-shrapnel vests. The ARD's main light infantry vehicle is the AGF.|$|E
25|$|At Oshkosh 1983, the Hawk won the Dupont <b>Kevlar</b> Air Recreational Vehicle Design Competition against {{more than}} 126 other designs.|$|E
25|$|<b>Kevlar</b> – {{lighter and}} {{stronger}} than fiberglass (it is the same material used in bulletproof vests) but the most expensive.|$|E
25|$|Both models feature chain drive, but {{the other}} F-series {{motorcycles}} now use a reinforced <b>kevlar</b> belt drive which requires less maintenance.|$|E
25|$|The {{officers}} used mace {{to subdue}} Clarett after attempts to subdue {{him with a}} Taser proved ineffective because he was wearing <b>Kevlar</b> body armor.|$|E
25|$|The ultraviolet component of {{sunlight}} degrades and decomposes <b>Kevlar,</b> a problem known as UV degradation, {{and so it}} is rarely used outdoors without protection against sunlight.|$|E
25|$|<b>Kevlar</b> is also {{presently}} used as {{a material}} for tailcords (a.k.a. tailpiece adjusters), which connect the tailpiece to the endpin of bowed string instruments.|$|E
25|$|In kyudo, or Japanese archery, {{it may be}} used as an {{alternative}} to more expensive hemp for bow strings. It {{is one of the main}} materials used for paraglider suspension lines. It is used as an inner lining for some bicycle tires to prevent punctures. In table tennis, plies of <b>Kevlar</b> are added to custom ply blades, or paddles, in order to increase bounce and reduce weight. Tennis racquets are sometimes strung with <b>Kevlar.</b> It is used in sails for high performance racing boats.|$|E
25|$|Materials used {{in modern}} designs – modern kayaks are usually made from Rotationally Molded Plastic (Rotomold), Fiberglass or <b>Kevlar,</b> {{each of which}} has {{advantages}} and disadvantages.|$|E
25|$|According to Corso, {{the reverse}} {{engineering}} of these artifacts indirectly {{led to the}} development of accelerated particle beam devices, fiber optics, lasers, integrated circuit chips and <b>Kevlar</b> material.|$|E
25|$|Solid-body {{electric}} violins {{typically have}} a non-traditional, minimalistic design to keep weight down. Lately, {{materials such as}} <b>kevlar,</b> glass and carbon fibres, {{are used in the}} build process.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Kevlar</b> fiber/epoxy matrix {{composite}} materials {{can be used}} in marine current turbines (MCT) or wind turbines due to their high specific strength and light weight compared to other fibers.|$|E
