50|$|Alabama has {{experienced}} several problematic executions involving the chair. On April 22, 1983, John Louis Evans, the first post-Furman prisoner to be <b>executed</b> by <b>the</b> <b>state,</b> {{was hit with}} an initial jolt of electricity, which lasted 30 seconds. Evans’ body tensed up, causing the electrode on his left leg to snap off. Soon smoke and flames were shooting {{out from under the}} hood that covered his head. When two physicians entered the death chamber they found him still alive. Ignoring Evans' lawyer's plea, a third jolt of electricity was applied and he died. The execution took a total of 14 minutes and his body was left charred and smoldering. <b>In</b> 1989 <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>executed</b> Horace Dunkins, who had an IQ of 69 and was convicted of murdering Lynn McCurry. <b>In</b> Dunkins’ execution <b>the</b> first jolt of electricity only knocked him unconscious. Charles Jones, the warden at the time, said that because the jacks connecting the electricity to the chair had been reversed, there was not enough voltage to kill him on the first try. Therefore, it took 19 minutes for Dunkins to die.|$|R
40|$|Bilateral {{investment}} treaties are {{agreements between}} sovereign states that give broad protections to investors and investments made within {{the jurisdiction of}} the other state. <b>The</b> prevailing view <b>in</b> <b>the</b> academy and practice is that developing countries sign bilateral investment treaties in order to reassure investors from developed states that their investments will be safe from changes in domestic law. Without these 2 ̆ 2 credible commitments, 2 ̆ 2 investors would be deterred from making investments, depriving developing countries of foreign capital. This Article disputes that view by demonstrating that foreign investors and host states effectively contract around the risk of changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> law. This Article applies transaction cost economic theory to the most comprehensive empirical study of stabilization clauses (provisions intended to manage post-investment changes in domestic law) recently conducted {{under the auspices of the}} World Bank 2 ̆ 7 s International Finance Corporation. The analysis shows that investors and states demonstrate principles of efficient contracting even without the protections of bilateral investment treaties. This finding adds to current research focusing on the 2 ̆ 2 credible commitment 2 ̆ 2 story. The Article concludes that (1) BITs can be explained as instruments developed and developing states use in their competition for markets and capital and (2) differences <b>in</b> <b>the</b> reasons <b>states</b> <b>execute</b> BITs raise significant doubts about conclusions drawn based on aggregate phenomena...|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> {{political}} integration <b>in</b> <b>the</b> EU, {{made the}} rules of the mutual legal assistance insufficient. The old model of mutual assistance was replaced approaching the judicial cooperation within the EU to the cooperation between judges from the same State. For this purpose it was necessary to find a balance between unification and diversity.

Not all the judicial decisions are interoperable, but only those that were defined as equivalent resolutions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> European common rules. <b>In</b> this system <b>the</b> recognition is widely guaranteed by establishing a compulsory distribution of <b>the</b> competences between <b>executing</b> and issuing judicial authorities, preventing the examination of the internal aspects and basis of the issued resolution by the judge of <b>the</b> <b>executing</b> <b>State,</b> and establishing a strong limitation of the grounds for refusal and of the elements that can be considered by <b>the</b> <b>executing</b> judge.
