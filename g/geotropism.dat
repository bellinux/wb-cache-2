50|$|Gravitropism (also {{known as}} <b>geotropism)</b> is a turning or growth {{movement}} by a plant or fungus {{in response to}} gravity. It is a general feature of all higher and many lower plants {{as well as other}} organisms. Charles Darwin {{was one of the first}} to scientifically document that roots show positive gravitropism and stems show negative gravitropism. That is, roots grow in the direction of gravitational pull (i.e., downward) and stems grow in the opposite direction (i.e., upwards). This behavior can be easily demonstrated with any potted plant. When laid onto its side, the growing parts of the stem begin to display negative gravitropism, growing (biologists say, turning; see tropism) upwards. Herbaceous (non-woody) stems are capable of a small degree of actual bending, but most of the redirected movement occurs as a consequence of root or stem growth outside.|$|E
40|$|<b>Geotropism</b> {{was used}} as a control for the {{specificity}} of potential inhibitors of phototropism by the coleoptiles of corn (Zea mays) seedlings.

Simultaneous irradiation of coleoptiles with phototropically inert light in addition to the phototropically active blue light also results in an inhibition of phototropism. Since azide, iodide, and phenylacetic acid are known to interact with flavins while a simultaneous irradiation with a phototropically inert light may depopulate the first triplet state of flavins, these data support the hypothesis that the photoreceptor pigment for phototropism in corn is a flavin...|$|E

This vertical migration was first studied by the great oceanic expeditions of the last century, particularly that of the â€œ¿Challenger â€œ¿in 1872 (Murray and Hjort, 1912). The first laboratory investigations were those of Groom and Loeb (1890) and Parker (1902). The earlier work has l) een extensively reviewed by Russell (1927) amid Kikuchi (1930).

40|$|The auxin {{transport}} inhibitor methyl- 2 -chloro- 9 -hydroxyfluorene- 9 -carboxylate (CFM), a morphactin, inhibits negative <b>geotropism,</b> causes cellular swelling, and induces {{root hair}} formation in roots of intact Pisum sativum L. seedlings. In excised pea root tips, CFM inhibits elongation more than increase in fresh weight (swell ratio = 1. 3 at 20 μm CFM). CFM growth inhibition was {{expressed in the}} presence of ethylene. Indoleacetic acid (IAA) prevented the expression of CFM growth inhibition possibly because IAA inhibited the accumulation of CFM into the tissue sections. CFM inhibited the accumulation of IAA and 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid into excised root tips. Applying Leopold's (1963. Brookhaven Symp. Biol. 16 : 218 - 234) model for polar auxin transport, this result suggests a possible explanation for CFM inhibition of <b>geotropism</b> in pea roots, i. e. disruption of auxin transport by interfering with auxin binding...|$|E

Of the 24 possible responses, 4 were unaffected at the concentrations used, 5 were affected slightly, and the remaining responses exhibited a 14 -fold range of apparent half-maximum concentration dependencies (i. e. 95 nl/l for the effect on pea epicotyl <b>geotropism</b> to 1350 nl/l for the promotion of cotton hypocotyl diameter). Six or possibly eight of these responses appear to have the same concentration dependencies while the others fell in pairs or as individual responses.

40|$|Using <b>geotropism</b> as {{a control}} for phototropism, {{compounds}} similar to phenylacetic acid that photoreact with flavins and/or have auxin-like activity were examined {{for their ability to}} specifically inhibit phototropism in corn seedlings using <b>geotropism</b> {{as a control}}. Results using indole- 3 -acetic acid, napthalene- 1 -acetic acid, naphthalene- 2 -acetic acid, phenylacetic acid, and β-phenylpyruvic acid suggest that such compounds will specifically inhibit phototropism primarily because of their photoreactivity with flavins and not their auxin activity. For example, strong auxins, indole- 3 -acetic acid and naphthalene- 1 -acetic acid, affected both tropic responses at all concentrations tested whereas weak auxins, phenylacetic acid and naphthalene- 2 -acetic acid, exhibited specific inhibition. In addition, the in vivo concentration of phenylacetic acid required to induce specificity was well below that required to stimulate coleoptile growth. Estimates of the percentage of photoreceptor pigment inactivated by phenylacetic acid (> 10 %) suggest that phenylacetic acid could be used to photoaffinity label the flavoprotein involved in corn seedling phototropism...|$|E
40|$|Rhizophora mangle L., one of {{the most}} common {{mangrove}} species, has an aerial structure system that gives it stability in permanently swampy soils. In fact, these structures, known as "aerial roots" or "stilt roots", have proven to be peculiar branches with positive <b>geotropism,</b> which form a large number of roots when in contact with swampy soils. These organs have a sympodial branching system, wide pith, slightly thickened cortex, collateral vascular bundles, polyarch stele and endarch protoxylem, as in the stem, and a periderm produced by a phellogen at the apex similar to a root cap. They also have the same type of trichosclereid that occurs in the stem, with negative <b>geotropism,</b> unlike true Rhizophora roots, which do not form trichosclereids at all. On the other hand, these branches do not form leaves and in this respect they are similar to roots.

30|$|Obviously, with seed germination, {{growth of}} a plant begins. The first root, called the radicle, will grow out of the seed through the {{micropyle}}, and the micropyle {{is part of the}} seed where water imbibes into the seed and enhances germination. Naturally, the shoot of the germinating seed has a negative <b>geotropism,</b> and the radicle has a positive <b>geotropism.</b> In managing seed sowing processes, the orientation of micropyle is related with supporting the upcoming response of the seedling to the stimulus (gravity). The downward curvature of the root tipped toward the center of gravity is influenced by biochemical and environmental factors and is considered as an essential characteristic for plant survival (He and South 2006). According to Coutts (1989), if the root is displaced from its vertical position or the seeds oriented vertically upward with respect to micropyle, the tip of the root bends downward. Similarly, the roots of the seed sown by positioning the micropyle vertically upright have to curve over the seed itself in order to grow in their normal (downward) direction (Fig.  1).|$|E
40|$|Brazilians {{have been}} using the {{underground}} organs of Smilax species in alternative medicine since the 19 th century because of their anti-rheumatic qualities. However, even nowadays, these species are explored only by extractivism. Studies on seed germination and development of these organs could be useful to preserve these plants. After germination, seedling development of Smilax polyantha was analyzed to understand underground stem formation. Furthermore, to analyze the ontogenesis of the underground system, seedlings aged from one to twelve months were sectioned. One {{of the most striking}} features of this species is the presence of two stem branching systems. The plumule gives rise to the first stem branching system with negative <b>geotropism.</b> Its first underground axillary bud sprouted into the other caulinar axis with positive <b>geotropism.</b> The horizontal growth and the subsequent thickening of this underground organ depended on the development of axillary buds from basal nodes of the previous branches. The cotyledonary bud did not {{play a role in the}} underground formation, as previously described in the literature for this genus, but the buds of the basal cataphylls built the second stem branching system. In this study we discuss the terminology and suggest calling this second stem branching system a rhizophore...|$|E

The leaves reduced in size and deformed contained more stomata. The epidermis and mesophyll cells were reduced in size. The cambium did not form a closed ring.

40|$|Submerged {{hypocotyl}} sections from Helianthus {{have been}} used to test the effect of neutral buffers on shoot <b>geotropism.</b> When hypocotyls have been abraded, it is found that increasing the molarity (0. 25 to 20 mm) of pH 6. 8 K-phosphate buffer, as well as other buffering systems, results in a strong inhibition of geotropic curvature. Buffer strength has no such effect on the curvature of nonabraded segments. One possible explanation for these data is that asymmetric shoot growth following geostimulation may require the establishment of a proton gradient across the cell walls of the shoot. When neutral buffers have access to the wall space (i. e. in abraded segments), they may prevent the establishment of such a gradient...|$|E
30|$|For seeds with {{medium and}} large morphology, {{it was easier}} for roots to emerge and grow if the {{micropyle}} is directed downward, following positive <b>geotropism.</b> When the micropyle is oriented downward, the roots of the seed grew easily and directly downward, with no need for bending. Therefore, the observed higher speed of germination, mean germination time, mean daily germination, peak value, germination value, and germination percent for seeds sown by positioning the micropyle downward is related to the ease for the radicle to emerge and grow downward in the normal direction. In general, plant roots grow downward for as they are positively geotropic and hydrotropic. Exploration of nutrients from soil and increasing the framework for anchorage are also advantage of the correctly growing roots.|$|E
40|$|Low {{concentrations}} of auxin (e. g. 10 − 10 m) do not promote {{the growth of}} intact seedling roots of maize (Zea mays L. Bear Hybrid WF 9 × 38). Higher concentrations are inhibitory.

The promotion of growth by auxin in pretreated roots is preceded by enhanced hydrogen ion secretion from the roots. The data indicate that hormone-enhanced hydrogen ion secretion {{may play a role}} in the rapid promotion of root growth by auxin.
