40|$|A large-eddy {{simulation}} (LES) {{coupled to}} a new bulk aerosol scheme is used to study long-lived regimes of aerosol-boundary layer cloud-precipitation interaction {{and the development of}} pockets of open cells (POCs) in subtropical stratocumulus cloud layers. The aerosol scheme prognoses mass and number concentration of a single log-normal accumulation mode with surface and entrainment sources, evolving subject to processing of activated aerosol and scavenging of dry aerosol by cloud and rain. The LES with the aerosol scheme is applied to a range of steadily-forced simulations idealized from a well-observed POC case. The long-term system evolution is explored with extended two-dimensional simulations of up to 20 days, mostly with diurnally-averaged insolation. One three-dimensional two-day simulation confirms the initial development of the corresponding two-dimensional case. With weak mean subsidence, an initially aerosol-rich mixed layer deepens, the capping stratocumulus cloud slowly thickens and increasingly depletes aerosol via precipitation accretion, then the boundary layer transitions within a few hours into an open-cell regime with scattered precipitating cumuli, in which entrainment is much weaker. The inversion slowly collapses for several days until the cumulus clouds are too shallow to efficiently precipitate. <b>Inversion</b> <b>cloud</b> then reforms and radiatively drives renewed entrainment, allowing the boundary layer to deepen and become more aerosol-rich, until the stratocumulus layer thickens enough to undergo another cycle of open-cell formation. If mean subsidence is stronger, the stratocumulus never thickens enough to initiate drizzle and settles into a steady state. With lower initial aerosol concentrations, this system quickly transitions into open cells, collapses, and redevelops into a different steady state with a shallow, optically thin cloud layer. In these steady states, interstitial scavenging by cloud droplets is the main sink of aerosol number. The system is described in a reduced two-dimensional phase plane with inversion height and boundary-layer average aerosol concentrations as the state variables. Simulations with a full diurnal cycle show similar evolutions, except that open-cell formation is phase-locked into the early morning hours. The same steadily-forced modeling framework is applied to the development and evolution of a POC and the surrounding overcast boundary layer. An initial aerosol perturbation applied to a portion of the model domain leads that portion to transition into open-cell convection, forming a POC. Reduced entrainment in the POC induces a negative feedback between areal fraction covered by the POC and boundary layer depth changes. This stabilizes the system by controlling liquid water path and precipitation sinks of aerosol number in the overcast region, while also preventing boundary-layer collapse within the POC, allowing the POC and overcast to coexist indefinitely in a quasi-steady equilibrium...|$|E

The sea breeze is important because it impacts fire weather, air pollution, agriculture, and aviation operations, among other things. Analyses are conducted using a multi-quadric based program, which incorporates aircraft data, surface observations, and profiler data, to investigate the Monterey Bay sea breeze during 01 - 31 August 2003. Factors including <b>inversions,</b> <b>cloud</b> cover, amount of heating, distribution of heating, synoptic-scale flow, and topography are studied to determine their influence on the sea breeze. Six days are selected that best illustrate the factors that influence the structure of the Monterey Bay sea breeze. Results show that offs hore flow weakened the strength of the sea breeze and decreased the depth. A cooling trend in surface temperatures at the end of August also weakened the strength of the sea breezes and decreased the depth. Clouds are present during this period, which influenced the amount of heating, and consequently, the sea breeze response. The presence of a marine layer weakened the thermal gradient that in turn, weakened the sea breeze circulation. Lieutenant Junior Grade, United States Naval Reserv...|$|R
40|$|A {{technique}} for the tracking of individual clouds in a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) is presented. We use this technique on a LES of a shallow cumulus cloud field {{based upon the}} Barbados Oceanographic and Meteorological Experiment (BOMEX) to calculate statistics of cloud height, lifetime, and other physical properties for individual clouds in the model. We also examine the question of nature versus nurture in shallow cumulus clouds: do properties at cloud base determine the upper-level properties of the clouds (nature), or are cloud properties determined by the environmental conditions they encounter (nurture). We find that clouds which ascend through an environment that has been pre-moistened by previous cloud activity are {{no more likely to}} reach the <b>inversion</b> than <b>clouds</b> that ascend through a drier environment. Cloud base thermodynamic properties are uncorrelated with upper-level cloud properties, while mean fractional entrainment and detrainment rate displays moderate correlations with cloud properties up to the <b>inversion.</b> Conversely, <b>cloud</b> base area correlates well with upper-level cloud area and maximum cloud height. We conclude that cloud thermodynamic properties are primarily influenced by entrainment and detrainment processes, cloud area and height are primarily influenced by cloud base area, and thus nature and nurture both play roles in the dynamics of BOMEX shallow cumulus clouds...|$|R

40|$|Detection {{of clouds}} over polar areas from {{satellite}} radiometric measurements in the visible and IR atmospheric window region is rather {{difficult because of}} the high albedo of snow, possible ice covered surfaces, very low humidity, and the usual presence of atmospheric temperature inversion. Cold and highly reflective polar surfaces provide little thermal and visible contrast between clouds and the background surface. Moreover, due to the presence of temperature <b>inversion,</b> <b>clouds</b> are not always identifiable as being colder than the background. In addition, low humidity often causes polar clouds to be optically thin. Finally, polar clouds are usually composed of a mixture of ice and water, which leads to an unclear spectral signature. Single and bi-spectral threshold methods are sometimes inappropriate due to a large variability of surface emissivity and cloud conditions. The objective {{of this study is to}} demonstrate the crucial role played by surface emissivity in the detection of polar winter clouds and the potential improvement offered by infrared hyperspectral observations, such as from the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI). In this paper a new approach for cloud detection is proposed and validated exploiting active measurements from satellite sensors, i. e., the CloudSat cloud profiling radar (CPR) and the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) on board the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO). For a homogenous IASI field of view (FOVs), the proposed cloud detection scheme tallies with the combined CPR and CALIOP product in classifying 98. 11 % of the FOVs as cloudy and also classifies 97. 54 % of the FOVs as clear.

The cloud-base height and cloud thickness from the cloud radar were added into the atmospheric profile retrieval process, and a back propagation neural network method {{was used as the}} retrieval tool. Because substantial data are required to train a neural network, and microwave radiometer data are insufficient for this purpose, eight years of radiosonde data from Beijing were used as a database. The model MonoRTM was used to calculate the brightness temperature of the same channel as the microwave radiometer. Part of the cloud-base height and cloud thickness in the training dataset was also estimated using the radiosonde data. The accuracy of the results was analyzed by comparing with L-band sounding radar data, and quantified using the mean bias, root-mean-square error and correlation coefficient.

Part I evaluates the model performance against satellite observations and examine physical processes important for maintaining the temperature <b>inversion</b> and Sc <b>clouds</b> in the simulation. The model captures major features of the marine boundary layer in the region, including a well-mixed marine boundary layer, a capping temperature <b>inversion,</b> Sc <b>clouds,</b> and the diurnal cycle. Sc clouds develop in {{the lower half of}} and below the temperature inversion layer that increases its height westward off the Pacific coast of South America. The strength of the capping inversion is determined not only by large-scale subsidence and local sea surface temperature (SST), but also by cloud-radiation feedback. A heat budget analysis indicates that upward longwave radiation cools strongly {{the upper part of the}} cloud layer and strengthens the temperature inversion. This cloud-top cooling further induces a local enhancement of subsidence in and below the inversion layer, resulting a dynamical warming that strengthens the temperature stratification above the clouds. While of secondary importance on the mean, solar radiation drives a pronounced diurnal cycle in the model boundary layer.

The three case studies examined are: warm air advection over dense pack ice causing strong elevated ducting and subrefraction, cold air advection over relatively open water causing shallow convection and normal refraction condi­tions, large scale subsidence in the western quadrants of an anticyclone leading to super-refraction and weak ducting. Developing synoptic scale cyclones adjacent to the MIZEX- 83 area often determined the airflow over the region.

40|$|Abstract. The various {{precipitation}} types formed within winter storms (such as snow, {{wet snow}} and freezing rain) {{often lead to}} very hazardous weather conditions. These types of precipitation often occur during {{the passage of a}} warm front as a warm air mass ascends over a cold air mass. To address this issue further, we used a one-dimensional kinematic cloud model to simulate this gentle ascent (≤ 10 cm/s) of warm air. The initial temperature profile has an above 0 ◦C inversion, a lower subfreezing layer, and precipitation falls from above the temperature <b>inversion.</b> The <b>cloud</b> model is coupled to a double-moment microphysics scheme that simulates the production of various types of winter precipitation. The results are compared with those from a previous study carried out in still air. Based on the temporal evolution of surface precipitation, snow reaches the surface significantly faster than in still air whereas other precipitation types including freezing rain and ice pellets have a shorter duration. Overall, even weak background vertical ascent has an important impact on the precipitation reaching the surface, the time of the elimination of the melting layer, and also the evolution of the lower subfreezing layer. ...|$|R

Therefore, {{to increase the number}} of observations of continental stratocumulus and to compare marine and continental stratocumulus to each other, the approach of large-eddy observation (LEO) was applied to a case of nocturnal continental stratocumulus observed over the Atmospheric RadiationMeasurement Program (ARM) Climate Research Facility (ACRF) in the central United States on 8 April 2006. The stratocumulus occurred in cold-air and dry-air advection behind a surface cold front.

40|$|ABSTRACT] Top cloud {{reflected}} solar radiance measurements directly {{recorded by}} satellites at various spectral bands and observation conditions {{are used to}} understand clouds’ optical and physical characteristics. The magnitude of these radiance measurements modulates the energy balance of the Earth through absorption and scattering.

The Visible and thermal infrared channels are mainly employed to extract, through various <b>inversion</b> techniques, <b>cloud</b> microphysical parameters such as the brightness temperature, optical depth, effective radius, top cloud temperature etc. This study examines reflectance and optical depth retrievals derived from cloud radiative measurement data collected by the SVISSR (Stretched Visible Infrared Spin-Scan Radiometer) and the MODIS (MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) sensors onboard the geostationary satellite (GMS- 5) and the polar-orbiting satellite (Terra) respectively.

Here we investigate the climatology and characteristics of humidity inversions in the Arctic, including their spatial and temporal variability, sensitivity to the methodology applied and differences from the Antarctic humidity inversions. The study is based on data of the Integrated Global Radiosonde Archive (IGRA) from 36 Arctic stations between the years 2000 – 2009. The results indicate that humidity inversions are nearly all the time present on multiple levels in the Arctic atmosphere. Almost half (48 %) of the humidity inversions were found at least partly within the same vertical layer with temperature inversions, whereas {{the existence of the}} other half may, at least partly, be linked to uneven vertical distribution of horizontal moisture transport. A high atmospheric surface pressure was found to increase the humidity inversion occurrence, whereas relationships between humidity <b>inversion</b> properties and <b>cloud</b> cover were generally relatively weak, although for some inversion properties systematic. The statistics of Arctic humidity inversion properties, especially inversion strength, depth and base height, proved to be very sensitive to the instruments and methodology applied. For example, the median strength of the strongest inversion in a profile was twice as large as the median of all Arctic inversions. The most striking difference between the Arctic and Antarctic humidity inversions was the much larger range of the seasonal cycle of inversion properties in the Arctic. Our results offer a baseline for validation of weather prediction and climate models and also encourage for further studies on humidity inversions due to the vital, but so far poorly understood, role of humidity <b>inversions</b> in Arctic <b>cloud</b> processes...|$|R

With nonlinearity in mind, logarithms of CTP, CWP, and CER are elements of the state vector.

These include the so-called “cold-U/V shape ” coupled with embedded warm areas, regions of increased shortwave IR (1. 6 – 4 µm) cloud top reflectivity, above-anvil plumes in VIS and shortwave IR bands, and moisture possibly present above storm tops in the lower stratosphere. While in the past, most of these phenomena were documented or studied independently, at different instants in time, MSG SEVIRI offers a chance to study their evolution and evaluate possible relationships between these cloud top features. The present work focuses on tops of convective storms over Europe, as observed by the SEVIRI instrument. The first goal of this work is to investigate the hypothesis that a cold-U/V shape can result from masking of lower cold anvil top by a warmer plume, developing above storm cloud top in the lower stratosphere. The second goal is to explore the possibility of detection of water vapor present above storm tops. Although the above-anvil plumes have been well documented in the VIS and near IR spectral bands only, latest modeling results suggest that a plume of moisture develops above the anvil before the formation of ice particles. If such a moisture plume forms, {{it should be possible}} to detect it under favorable conditions (a thermal <b>inversion</b> above <b>cloud</b> top level) from the brightness temperature difference of WV and IR window bands.

40|$|The role {{of surface}} {{friction}} on shallow nonprecipitating convection is investigated using {{a series of}} large-eddy simulations with varying surface friction velocity and with a cloud identification algorithm. As surface friction intensifies, convective rolls dominate over convective cells and secondary overturning circulation becomes stronger in the subcloud layer, thus transporting more moisture upward and more heat downward between the subcloud and cloud layers. Identifying individual clouds, using the identification algorithm based on a three-dimensional topological analysis, reveals that intensified surface friction increases the number of clouds {{and the degree of}} tilting in the downstream direction. Highly intensified surface friction increases wind shear across the cloud base and induces cloud tilting, which leads to a vertically parabolic profile of liquid water mixing ratio instead of the classical two-layer structure (conditionally unstable and trade <b>inversion</b> layers). Furthermore, <b>cloud</b> tilting induces more cloud cover and more cloud mass flux much above the cloud base (e. g. 0. 8 km 1. 2 km) because of increased lateral entrainment rate.

Cloud layers in the summer spanned a warmer temperature regime than in the spring and enhancement of ice concentrations in these cases was found to be due to secondary ice production through the Hallett–Mossop (H–M) process. Aerosol concentrations during spring ranged from ~ 300 – 400 cm − 3 in one case to lower values of ~ 50 – 100 cm − 3 in the other. The concentration of aerosol with sizes D p > 0. 5 μm was used in a primary ice nucleus (IN) prediction scheme (DeMott et al., 2010). Predicted IN values varied depending on aerosol measurement periods but were generally greater than maximum observed median values of ice crystal concentrations in the spring cases, and less than the observed ice concentrations in the summer due to the influence of secondary ice production. Comparison with recent cloud observations in the Antarctic summer (Grosvenor et al., 2012), reveals lower ice concentrations in Antarctic clouds in comparable seasons. An enhancement of ice crystal number concentrations (when compared with predicted IN numbers) was also found in Antarctic stratocumulus clouds spanning the H–M temperature zone; however, concentrations were about an order of magnitude lower than those observed in the Arctic summer cases but were similar to the peak values observed in the colder Arctic spring cases, where the H–M mechanism did not operate...|$|R

40|$|Three boundary-layer cloud object types, stratus, {{stratocumulus}} and cumulus, {{that occurred}} over the Pacific Ocean during January-August 1998, are identified from the CERES (Clouds and the Earth s Radiant Energy System) single scanner footprint (SSF) data from the TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission) satellite. This study emphasizes the differences and similarities in the characteristics of each cloud-object type between the tropical and subtropical regions and among different size categories and among small geographic areas. Both the frequencies of occurrence and statistical distributions of cloud physical properties are analyzed. In terms of frequencies of occurrence, stratocumulus clouds dominate the entire boundary layer cloud population in all regions and among all size categories. Stratus clouds are more prevalent in the subtropics and near the coastal regions, while cumulus clouds are relatively prevalent over open ocean and the equatorial regions, particularly, within the small size categories. The largest size category of stratus cloud objects occurs more frequently in the subtropics than in the tropics and has much larger average size than its cumulus and stratocumulus counterparts. Each of the three cloud object types exhibits small differences in statistical distributions of cloud optical depth, liquid water path, TOA albedo and perhaps cloud-top height, but large differences in those of cloud-top temperature and OLR between the tropics and subtropics. Differences in the sea surface temperature (SST) distributions between the tropics and subtropics influence some of the cloud macrophysical properties, but cloud microphysical properties and albedo for each cloud object type are likely determined by (local) boundary-layer dynamics and structures. Systematic variations of cloud optical depth, TOA albedo, cloud-top height, OLR and SST with cloud object sizes are pronounced for the stratocumulus and stratus types, which are related to systematic variations {{of the strength of}} <b>inversion</b> with <b>cloud</b> object sizes, produced by large-scale subsidence. The differences in cloud macrophysical properties over small regions are significantly larger than those of cloud microphysical properties and TOA albedo, suggesting a greater control of (local) large-scale dynamics and other factors on cloud object properties. When the three cloud object types are combined, the relative population among the three types is the most important factor for determining the cloud object properties in a Pacific transect where the transition of boundary-layer cloud types takes place...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of clouds dramatically alters the opacity and radiative transfer within Earth's atmosphere at both {{short and long}} wavelengths. Knowledge of cloud top and base is needed to estimate the Outgoing Long wave Radiation (OLR) to space and the net radiation at the surface from a given atmospheric profile. Satellite observations are required to provide the global perspective needed for climate. Cloud top pressure can be determined to some accuracy from spaceborne radiance measurements when cloud opacities are sufficiently large and cloud top temperatures are sufficiently low to readily them from the surface. Cloud base is particularly difficult to determine from space. The relatively small sensitivity of long wavelengths must be used to penetrate the clouds {{while at the same}} time providing sufficient sensitivity to detect the cloud base. We are studying the indirect sensitivity of radio occultation observations to clouds through their impact on the refractivity structure. The tradewind inversion is an excellent example where a very sharp refractivity structure coincides with the top of the tradewind cumulus and stratus clouds. In general, any cloud with sufficient IR opacity will have large transmissivity gradient at cloud top (base) which will result in large cooling (heating) which will create a thermal <b>inversion</b> at <b>cloud</b> top (base). Both liquid and ice clouds can reach this critical opacity. The thermal inversion and sharp change in specific humidity will cause a sharp change in the refractivity gradient which can be identified in the radio occultation results, particularly the signal amplitude. The occultations yield very accurate information on the height of such features. The heating at cloud base drives convection causing the air to follow a moist adiabat within the Cloud which further helps constrain the interpretation of the observations. The upward expansion of such opaque clouds due to convection may be an important mechanism supplying moisture into the upper troposphere. We will present simulations using high resolution radiosondes from field campaigns representing the expected signatures of such features. We will also present initial results of comparisons between GPS observations and GOES-derived cloud tops to assess the utility of this concept...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{evaluate}} {{the impact on}} the cloud parameter retrievals of the ORAC (Optimal Retrieval of Aerosol and Cloud) algorithm following the inclusion of stereo-derived cloud top heights as a priori information. This is performed in a mathematically rigorous way using the ORAC optimal estimation retrieval framework, which includes the facility to use such independent a priori information. Key to the use of a priori information is a characterisation of their associated uncertainty. This paper demonstrates the improvements that are possible using this approach and also considers their impact on the microphysical cloud parameters retrieved. The Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) instrument has two views and three thermal channels, so it is well placed to demonstrate the synergy of the two techniques. The stereo retrieval is able to improve the accuracy of the retrieved cloud top height when compared to collocated Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO), particularly in the presence of boundary layer <b>inversions</b> and high <b>clouds.</b> The impact of the stereo a priori information on the microphysical cloud properties of cloud optical thickness (COT) and effective radius (RE) was evaluated and generally found to be very small for single-layer clouds conditions over open water (mean RE differences of 2. 2 (± 5. 9)  microns and mean COD differences of 0. 5 (± 1. 8) for single-layer ice clouds over open water at elevations of above 9  km, which are most strongly affected by the inclusion of the a priori) ...|$|R
40|$|Observations {{suggest that}} {{processes}} maintaining subtropical and Arctic stratocumulus differ, {{due to the}} different environments in which they occur. For example, specific humidity inversions (specific humidity increasing with height) are frequently observed to occur coincident with temperature inversions in the Arctic, while they do not occur in the subtropics. In this study we use nested LES simulations of decoupled Arctic Mixed-Phase Stratocumulus (AMPS) clouds observed during the DOE Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program's Indirect and SemiDirect Aerosol Campaign (ISDAC) to analyze budgets of water components, potential temperature, and turbulent kinetic energy. These analyses quantify the processes that maintain decoupled AMPS, including {{the role of the}} humidity inversions. The results show the maintenance of liquid clouds in both the shallow upper entrainment zone (temperature and humidity inversion) due to a down gradient transport of water vapor by turbulent fluxes into the cloud layer and direct condensation by radiative cooling, and in the updrafts of the mixed-layer eddies below cloud top due to buoyant destabilization. These processes cause at least 20 % of the cloud liquid water to extend into the inversion. The redistribution of water vapor {{from the top of the}} humidity inversion to the base of the humidity <b>inversion</b> maintains the <b>cloud</b> layer while the mixed layer-entrainment zone system is continually losing total water. In this decoupled system, the humidity inversion is the only source of water vapor for the cloud system since water vapor from the surface layer is not efficiently transported into the mixed layer. Sedimentation of ice is the dominant sink of moisture from the mixed layer...|$|R
40|$|Stratocumulus clouds play an {{important}} role in climate cooling and are hard to predict using global climate and weather forecast models. Thus, previous studies in the literature use observations and numerical simulation tools, such as large-eddy simulation (LES), to solve the governing equations for the evolution of stratocumulus clouds. In contrast to the previous works, this work provides an analytic closed-form solution to the cloud thickness evolution of stratocumulus clouds in a mixed-layer model framework. With a focus on application over coastal lands, the diurnal cycle of cloud thickness and whether or not clouds dissipate are of particular interest. An analytic solution enables the sensitivity analysis of implicitly interdependent variables and extrema analysis of cloud variables that are hard to achieve using numerical solutions. In this work, the sensitivity of inversion height, cloud-base height, and cloud thickness with respect to initial and boundary conditions, such as Bowen ratio, subsidence, surface temperature, and initial inversion height, are studied. A critical initial cloud thickness value that can be dissipated pre- and post-sunrise is provided. Furthermore, an extrema analysis is provided to obtain the minima and maxima of the <b>inversion</b> height and <b>cloud</b> thickness within 24 h. The proposed solution is validated against LES results under the same initial and boundary conditions. Then, the proposed analytic framework is extended to incorporate multiple vertical columns that are coupled by advection through wind flow. This enables a bridge between the micro-scale and the mesoscale relations. The effect of advection on cloud evolution is studied and a sensitivity analysis is provided...|$|R
40|$|At mid and {{tropical}} latitudes, cirrus clouds are present more than 50 % {{of the time}} in satellites observations. Due to their large spatial and temporal coverage, and associated low temperatures, cirrus clouds have a major influence on the Earth-Ocean-Atmosphere energy balance through their effects on the incoming solar radiation and outgoing infrared radiation. At present the impact of cirrus clouds on climate is well recognized but remains to be asserted more precisely, for their optical and radiative properties are not very well known. In order to understand the effects of cirrus clouds on climate, their optical and radiative characteristics of these clouds need to be determined accurately at different scales in different locations i. e. latitude. Lidars are well suited to observe cirrus clouds, they can detect very thin and semi-transparent layers, and retrieve the clouds geometrical properties i. e. altitude and multilayers, as well as radiative properties i. e. optical depth, backscattering phase functions of ice crystals. Moreover the linear depolarization ratio can give information on the ice crystal shape. In addition, the data collected with an airborne version of POLDER (POLarization and Directionality of Earth Reflectances) instrument have shown that bidirectional polarized measurements can provide information on cirrus cloud microphysical properties (crystal shapes, preferred orientation in space). The spaceborne version of POLDER- 1 has been flown on ADEOS- 1 platform during 8 months (October 96 - June 97), and the next POLDER- 2 instrument will be launched in 2000 on ADEOS- 2. The POLDER- 1 <b>cloud</b> <b>inversion</b> algorithms are currently under validation. For cirrus clouds, a validation based on comparisons between cloud properties retrieved from POLDER- 1 data and cloud properties inferred from a ground-based lidar network is currently under consideration.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2002 The {{physical}} {{mechanisms that}} affect the tropical sea surface temperature (SST) are investigated using a two box model and a mesoscale model with fixed uniform and sinusoidal SST gradients. Emphasis {{is placed on the}} large-scale circulation containing rising motion in regions with high humidity and high clouds and subsidence in regions with low upper tropospheric humidity, a trade <b>inversion</b> and low <b>clouds.</b> Changes {{in the area of the}} convective region are investigated as are effects of the high and low clouds. The results show that water vapor feedback in clear skies depends on the height of the moist boundary layer. Radiative cooling in the cold pool constrains the large-scale circulation strength. The strength of the circulation decreases with increasing convective area, because the increase in dry static stability overwhelms the increase in cooling rate in the two box model and the mesoscale model with SST gradients. For simulations with constant fixed SST and zero mean vertical motion, the sensitivities of the top of the atmosphere radiative quantities to SST are similar to observations comparing El Nino and La Nina SSTs and radiative quantities when averaged over an area including the ascending and descending branches of the tropical large-scale circulation. These simulations also show that the clear-sky temperature and water vapor feedbacks are of about equal magnitude in opposite directions, and the lapse rate feedback is negative with a magnitude of approximately 2 W m- 2 K- 1. Shortwave cloud forcing is related to the strength of the large-scale circulation in the SST gradient simulations. The longwave radiative cooling at the top of stratus clouds enhances the large-scale circulation. Increasing the mesoscale model SST gradient strengthens the large-scale circulation and decreases the average net absorbed shortwave radiation...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{is motivated by}} the need to conserve tropical montane cloud forests (TMCFs) as a biodiversity hotspot threatened by environmental change. A defining feature ofTMCFs is frequent cloud immersion, which also provides moisture to the ecosystem in the dry season. Therefore, TMCFs may be sensitive to any changes in the height or frequency of cloud. The thesis consists of four papers using a combination of field and satellite-based estimations of cloud heights and frequencies with reanalysis data to investigate cloud climatology, trends and variability for a TMCF in SE Peru. The first paper uses satellite-based cloud observations from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) (1983 to 2008), MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) (2000 to 2009) and ground-based o~i'rvations to characterise cloud frequency at local and regional scales. The study area is divided into highlands (or puna), eastern slope and lowland zones to investigate spatial variability in the seasonal/diurnal cycles. Greater amplitude annual cycles and an early dry season minimum were found for the puna. For the lowlands, the minimum occurred in the late dry season except in the early morning. The second paper examines differences in interannual variability of cloud frequency between the three zones and its relationship with SSTs. Cloud frequencies are correlated with SSTs areas in the Pacific, Indian Ocean and tropical Atlantic, revealing differences between zones in the SST region of highest correlation, which also varies with season. Composites of cloud frequency, circulation and moisture flux for four combinations of high and low SSTs in the tropical North Atlantic and tropical Pacific suggest that high(low) SST anomalies in these regions are associated with reduced(increased) cloud frequency in all zones in both MAM and SON. Significant decreasing trends are found for the lowlands in January, March and September and in March on the eastern slope. The third uses radiosonde observations from the field site with station data from four elevations and cloud top heights from MODIS to investigate seasonal, diurnal and intra-seasonal variability of atmospheric structure and its relationship with cloud height and frequency. On a seasonal basis the cloud base height varies by approximately 400 m and top height by approximately 4000 m resulting in a minimum relative humidity in September at lower elevations but in June at higher elevations on the slope. Diurnal variability is dominated by daytime upslope and night-time downslope flows. The direction of mid to upper level winds are a dominant feature of intra-seasonal variability and influence <b>inversion</b> frequency, <b>cloud</b> height and frequency in all zones. The final paper compares direct observational methods (photographs, infrared thermometer and disappearance time of the radiosonde), with profile-based methods using relative humidity or temperature thresholds or gradients to estimate the positions of cloud boundaries. Methods to estimate cloud base height using the MODIS Cloud Product were also tested but potential applications were found to be limited. A method is proposed for cloud base height estimation involving consensus estimates from three methods that could be applied on long time scales. 11 EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS), Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI), and Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) are all hyper-spectral {{satellite}} sensors {{with thousands}} of spectral channels. Top of atmospheric radiance spectra measured by these sensors contain high information content on atmospheric, cloud, and surface properties. Exploring high information content contained in these high spectral resolution spectra is a challenging task due to computation e ort involved in modeling thousands of spectral channels. Usually, only very small fractions (4 { 10 percent) of the available channels are included in physical retrieval systems or numerical weather forecast (NWP) satellite data assimilations. We will describe a method of simultaneously retrieving atmospheric temperature, moisture, cloud, and surface properties using all available spectral channels without sacrificing computational speed. The essence of the method is to convert channel radiance spectra into super-channels by an Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) transformation. Because the EOFs are orthogonal to each other, about 100 super-channels are adequate to capture the information content of the radiance spectra. A Principal Component-based Radiative Transfer Model (PCRTM) developed at NASA Langley Research Center {{is used to calculate}} both the super-channel magnitudes and derivatives with respect to atmospheric profiles and other properties. There is no need to perform EOF transformations to convert super channels back to spectral space at each iteration step for a one-dimensional variational retrieval or a NWP data assimilation system. The PCRTM forward model is also capable of calculating radiative contributions due to multiple-layer clouds. The multiple scattering effects of the clouds are efficiently parameterized. A physical retrieval algorithm then performs an <b>inversion</b> of atmospheric, <b>cloud,</b> and surface properties in super channel domain directly therefore both reducing the computational need and preserving the information content of the IASI measurements. The inversion algorithm is based on a non-linear Levenberg-Marquardt method with climatology covariance matrices and a priori information as constraints. One advantage of this approach is that it uses all information content from the hyper-spectral data so that the retrieval is less sensitive to instrument noise and eliminates the need for selecting a sub-set of the channels...|$|R
