5000|$|In Muhammad Yunus' early {{efforts to}} {{alleviate}} {{poverty in the}} regions near his home, he worked to improve local farmers' crop yields. Though he succeeded in his short-term project goals, he discovered another problem: a whole section of Bangladesh's poor had slipped through the cracks in poverty reduction programs. To combat that problem, he researched the poor {{in the village of}} Jobra, later redefining the previously vague 'poverty' and developing and studying categories of 'poor people.' [...] In Banker to the Poor, Yunus writes: [...] "I found it useful to use three broad definitions of poor to describe the situation in Bangladesh: P1—the bottom 20 percent of the population (absolute poor) P2—bottom 35 percent of the population P3—bottom 50 percent of the population Watching the poor in each of these categories, he discovered that slightly impoverished citizens who were <b>eligible</b> <b>for</b> <b>aid</b> crowded out those who desperately needed aid. When Yunus started Grameen Bank, he tailored its programs toward these desperately poor.Some people disagree that Yunus' approaches are the best possible way to address poverty or microfinance. For instance, Milford Bateman with the Overseas Development Institute wrote, [...] "When microfinance-funded enterprises are set up, they tend simply to displace other tiny businesses without funding, meaning there is generally no net impact on poverty." [...] Bateman also contends, [...] "It turns out that as more and more microenterprises were crowded into the same local economic space, the returns on each one began to fall dramatically. Starting a new business or a basket-making operation or driving a rickshaw required few skills and only a tiny amount of capital, but such a project generated very little income, because everyone else was pretty much already doing exactly the same things in order to survive." [...] In Yunus' attempt to help the absolute poor (which is different from the 'nonpoor' or middle business sector of the economy), Bateman argues that he inadvertently crowded out this vital middle business sector, hurting the absolute poor to which he devoted Grameen's efforts. Bateman further argues, [...] "To the extent that local savings and remittance income are increasingly channeled into such simple activities via microfinance institutions, and so channeled away from more sophisticated and scaled-up activities associated with small and medium enterprises, the more the economic structure of that country, region or locality is inevitably undermined and destroyed." ...|$|E

We find that regional inequality in these composite measures is lower than regional inequality in gross-domestic product (GDP) per capita.

It is also shown that using alternative indicators instead of GDP per capita would only have a small effect on the set of regions <b>eligible</b> <b>for</b> <b>aid</b> from EU Structural Funds. The exception appears to be an aggregation based on how individual dimensions of welfare relate to average life satisfaction across regions, which would substantially change both the ranking of regions and which regions would receive EU funds...|$|E

40|$|Concerns over rising {{college tuition}} and slow {{economic}} growth have brought renewed {{attention to the}} role of federal and state financial aid programs in opening access to education. Despite a large body of literature examining the effects of grant aid on four-year and public two-year college enrollment, for-profit colleges-particularly the vast majority that offer two-year degrees and certificates-have largely been ignored. Using panel data methods and a new administrative data set of for-profit colleges operating in California between 1989 and 2003, I assess the impact of the federal Pell Grant program, the G. I. Bill, and California's Cal Grant program on the net number of for-profit colleges per county. The results suggest that for both Pell and Cal Grants, increases in the per-student maximum award encourage for-profit entry. This relationship is particularly strong in counties with high adult poverty levels, where more students are <b>eligible</b> <b>for</b> <b>aid.</b> Further, these gains in the private sector do not appear to {{come at the expense of}} the public sector. Rather, public community colleges also experience enrollment gains as the generosity of Pell and Cal Grants increases, although this reaction appears to be weaker than the reaction of for-profits. © 2010 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management. ...|$|E
