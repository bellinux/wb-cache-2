The torment {{is present in the}} song's opening ('There were nights when the wind was so cold'), from which the singer recovers ('I {{finished}} crying <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>instant</b> that you left... And I banished every memory you and I had ever made'). However, the defiance in the verses are replaced by the return of the 'subservient' feelings in the chorus ('when you touch me like this, and you hold me like that...'); this juxtaposition continues throughout the song.|$|E

25|$|Writing for the Court, Justice Scalia {{referenced}} Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123 (1968), in {{laying out}} the question presented <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>instant</b> case. In Bruton, the Court held that a defendant was deprived of his rights under the Confrontation Clause if a confession by his codefendant was introduced in their joint trial, {{regardless of whether the}} jury received instructions only to consider it against the confessor. Similarly, the question in Cruz concerned whether a codefendant's confession is barred if the defendant's confession is substantially the same as the codefendant's.|$|E
25|$|The TCAs show {{efficacy}} in {{the clinical}} treatment {{of a number of}} different types of chronic pain, notably neuralgia or neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia. The precise mechanism of action in explanation of their analgesic efficacy is unclear, but it is thought that they indirectly modulate the opioid system in the brain downstream via serotonergic and noradrenergic neuromodulation, among other properties. They are also effective in migraine prophylaxis, though not <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>instant</b> relief of an acute migraine attack. They may also be effective to prevent chronic tension headaches.|$|E

Nonetheless, the contract specified payment in coin, and payment in coin must be made. The Court also held that fluctuations in the price of the property between the date on which the contract was agreed and the date the down payment was made do not create issues of equity.|$|E
40|$|In dam-break flow experiments, the {{instantaneous}} dam-break {{is usually}} modeled by a moving gate whose removal time {{has to be}} small enough to not disturb significantly <b>the</b> flow <b>in</b> <b>the</b> initial <b>instants.</b> <b>The</b> gate motion direction, up or downward, {{is also an important}} parameter that will affect <b>the</b> initial <b>instants</b> of <b>the</b> dam-break flow propagation. In this paper an analysis of the gate removal effect <b>in</b> <b>the</b> initial <b>instants</b> of <b>the</b> dam-break flow is made considering two different initial water heights. By analyzing the water column behavior immediately after the dam-break, a new criterion for downward moving gates is presented.

25|$|In his 19th footnote, Blackmun had {{admitted}} {{there was in}} the case a possible reason not to compel arbitration, raised in the federal government's brief: that, since the contract was governed by Swiss law, the arbitration panel could therefore decide to disregard the Sherman Act entirely and consider Soler's claims under that body of law. On the other side, the International Chamber of Commerce had conceded in its amicus brief that that could occur as well, though it considered the possibility unlikely. Blackmun allowed {{that this was a}} valid concern but countered that Mitsubishi had already stipulated at oral argument that American law would control the antitrust claims, mooting it <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>instant</b> case.|$|E
25|$|The attack force staged {{through an}} {{airfield}} on Kendari, {{spending the night}} of 16 January there, refueling and taking off {{in the early hours}} next morning. Two targets had been assigned: the B-17s were to attack shipping in Menado Bay, while the LB-30S bombed an airport in the vicinity. However, their orders were so unclear that the LB-30 crews could not be sure where the airport was and they had to spend fifteen or twenty minutes searching before they finally found the field at Langoan, beside a lake, about 20 miles south of Menado. Almost <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>instant</b> that the last plane reported its bombs away, they were hit by five Zeros, and for six minutes the three LB-30s were under fire. They managed to shoot down one of the Zeros before themselves escaping into the weather; but two of the aircraft had been fatally hurt.|$|E
25|$|As not {{infrequently}} happens, {{the process}} for canonization {{in this case was}} subject to delays and obstacles of various kinds. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>instant</b> case, certain interventions were initiated through unorthodox routes in early 1998 by a small group of ecclesiastics in Mexico (then or formerly attached to the Basilica of Guadalupe) pressing for a review of the sufficiency of the historical investigation. This review, which not infrequently occurs in cases of equipollent beatifications, was entrusted by the Congregation for the Causes of Saints (acting in concert with the Archdiocese of Mexico) to a special Historical Commission headed by the Mexican ecclesiastical historians Fidel González, Eduardo Chávez Sánchez, and José Guerrero. The results of the review were presented to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints on October 28, 1998 which unanimously approved them. In the following year, the fruit of the Commission's work was published in book form by González, Chávez Sánchez and Guerrero under the title Encuentro de la Virgen de Guadalupe y Juan Diego. This served, however, only to intensify the protests of those who were attempting to delay or prevent the canonization, and the arguments over the quality of the scholarship displayed by the Encuentro were conducted first in private and then in public. The main objection against the Encuentro was that it failed adequately to distinguish between the antiquity of the cult and the antiquity of the tradition of the apparitions; the argument on the other side was that every tradition has an initial oral stage where documentation will be lacking. The authenticity of the Codex Escalada and the dating of the Nican Mopohua to the 16th or 17th century have a material bearing on the duration of the oral stage. Final approbation of the decree of canonization was signified in a Consistory held on February 26, 2002 at which Pope John Paul II announced that the rite of canonization would take place in Mexico at the Basilica of Guadalupe on July 31, 2002, as indeed occurred.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This letter {{proposes a}} time-effective method for {{determining}} <b>the</b> <b>instants</b> of significant excitation <b>in</b> speech signals. <b>The</b> <b>instants</b> of significant excitation correspond to <b>the</b> <b>instants</b> of glottal closure (epochs) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case of voiced speech, {{and to some}} random excitations like onset of burst <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case of nonvoiced speech. The proposed method consists of two phases: the first phase determines the approximate epoch locations using the Hilbert envelope of the linear prediction residual of the speech signal. The second phase determines the accurate locations of <b>the</b> <b>instants</b> of significant excitation by computing the group delay around the approximate epoch locations derived from the first phase. <b>The</b> accuracy <b>in</b> determining <b>the</b> <b>instants</b> of significant excitation and the time complexity of the proposed method is compared with the group delay based approach.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{variation}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> switching <b>instant</b> of <b>the</b> output switch of the pulser circuit used in energizing an NEMP simulator on the voltage fed to the simulator {{and hence the}} electric field within the working volume of the simulator has been studied.

This wave shape of the output voltage from the pulser circuit determines the shape and characteristics of the electric field within the working volume of the simulator. To study the effect of variation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> switching <b>instant</b> on <b>the</b> vertical electric field within the working volume, the vertical electric field has been computed in time and frequency domains.
