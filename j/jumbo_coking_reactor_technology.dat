40|$|Hydrogen (H 2) fuel {{obtained}} via thermo-catalytic ammonia (NH 3) decomposition {{is rapidly}} attracting considerable interest for portable and distributed power generation systems. Consequently, {{a variety of}} <b>reactor</b> <b>technologies</b> are being developed {{in view of the}} current lack of infrastructure to generate H 2 for proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells. This paper provides an extensive review of the state-of-the-art <b>reactor</b> <b>technology</b> (also referred to as reactor infrastructure) for pure NH 3 decomposition. The review strategy is to survey the open literature and present <b>reactor</b> <b>technology</b> developments in a chronological order. The primary objective {{of this paper is to}} provide a condensed viewpoint and basis for future advances in <b>reactor</b> <b>technology</b> for generating H 2 via NH 3 decomposition. Also, this review highlights the prominent issues and prevailing challenges that are yet to be overcome for possible market entry and subsequent commercialization of various <b>reactor</b> <b>technologies.</b> To our knowledge, this work presents for the first time a review of reactor infrastructure for distributed H 2 generation via NH 3 decomposition. Despite commendable research and development progress, substantial effort is still required if commercialization of NH 3 decomposition reactor infrastructure is to be realized. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|Less {{developed}} <b>reactor</b> <b>technologies</b> {{are characterized}} by a high uncertainty level of the key performance indicators, as compared to more mature options, {{due to lack of}} information on the design, operation and cost data, etc., while the expected performance of such systems is normally more attractive in comparison with more mature options. Evidently, a greater uncertainty leads to higher economic risks involved in the deployment of the respective technology. Evaluating comparatively the competitiveness and performance of <b>reactor</b> <b>technologies</b> at different maturity levels requires taking into account economic risks to balance the judgments regarding the expected performance of the considered options. A reliable basis for this is formed by the economic risk theory. Evaluation of risk indicators requires calculation of characteristics for probabilistic distributions of economic performance indicators and systemic use of statistical approaches based on Monte Carlo methods. Demonstration analysis results for the risk indicator evaluation have been discussed as applied to different economic performance indicators based on the example of a comparative analysis for two hypothetical light water <b>reactor</b> <b>technologies</b> to be considered in the selection of the most attractive option. Use of economic risk indicators for the comparative evaluation of <b>reactor</b> <b>technologies</b> appears to be helpful to decision makers not familiar with the technical characteristics and performance measures of <b>reactor</b> <b>technologies</b> but informed about the economic risk concepts. Such methodology may be employed efficiently to interpret the ranking results in a multi-criteria comparative evaluation of less and more mature <b>reactor</b> <b>technologies...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract- The {{deployment}} of advanced reactors {{of the type}} proposed for Generation IV will require a new strategy for licensing and demonstration. One of the requirements for NRC certification is that for technologies, {{for which there is}} not a regulatory history or an experience base, demonstration plants are a requirement. The current regulatory process as codified 10 CFR Parts 50, 51 and 52 has to be met by law. This process is largely focused on the light-water <b>reactor</b> <b>technology</b> and would make introduction of these new <b>reactor</b> <b>technologies</b> very difficult. What is required is a technology-neutral regulatory regime that will allow the timely licensing of advanced <b>reactor</b> <b>technologies.</b> One of the difficulties that the introduction of new technologie...|$|R

40|$|The thermal {{upgrading}} of Nigerian {{petroleum residue}} was studied at relatively low pressure in a delayed <b>coking</b> <b>reactor</b> system. In this work, {{the intent was}} to investigate the effects of process variables such as reaction temperature (200 (0) C to 600 (0) C), reaction time (0 to 120 min), additive concentration loading and additive-to-residue ratio on the amounts and quality of organic liquid product (OLP). The liquid products derived from the delayed coking process were characterized by means of instrumental analysis of gas-liquid chromatography. Results obtained from the analyses of the OLP revealed an upward trend of the conversion process and the selectivity of the aromatic compounds with additive-to-residue ratio (ARR) and increase in temperature. This led to maximum yield of 37. 2 % achieved with ARR of 5 compared to 31 % achieved with ordinary thermal conversion. The selectivity for aromatic hydrocarbons was maximum at 83. 1 wt% the selectivity towards aromatics and aliphatic hydrocarbons were highest for methanol-potassium hydroxide and methanol respectively. In all additive system cases, maximum OLP was produced at an optimum reaction temperature of 370 (0) C in the delayed <b>coking</b> <b>reactor</b> and at higher residence time. The gaseous product consisted of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide and C 1 - C 6 hydrocarbons, which amounted to about 20 to 30 wt% of liquid distillate. The information obtained in this study show that the organic liquid products are amenable to characterization procedure and provided the basis for the identification of processes for upgrading Nigerian petroleum residue and such other starting materials such as bitumen or fossil fuel coal liquids...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis work {{investigates the}} impact of {{catalyst}} structuring into particles or monoliths on methanol production from only CO 2 and H 2 at a large scale. Methanol synthesis in multi-tubular reactors is evaluated using packed-bed and monolithic reactors by modeling heat and mass transfer in each reactor. The obtained simulation results show that, at low gas hourly space velocity (GHSV = 10, 000 h‚àí 1), the performances of both <b>reactor</b> <b>technologies</b> are similar. In this case, the packed-bed <b>reactor</b> <b>technology</b> is the most appropriate technology due to its simplicity of installation and operation. At high GHSV (25, 000 h‚àí 1), the packed-bed <b>reactor</b> <b>technology</b> is limited by a considerable pressure drop that causes an important loss in productivity due to thermodynamic equilibrium, whereas the monolithic reactors exhibit negligible pressure drop and achieve far better performances...|$|R
