40|$|Piezoelectric and {{transient}} {{differential pressure}} sensors are two {{among the most}} widely employed sensors for vortex flowmeter application. The present study evaluates the performance of these two techniques under fully developed and disturbed flow conditions. Firstly, {{the location of the}} transient differential pressure sensor is optimized to obtain high amplitude signals and good linearity in Strouhal number. Empirical mode decomposition method in combination with autocorrelation decay is successfully employed at high Reynolds numbers to identify the vortex shedding frequency in presence of hydrodynamic noise. The performance of the differential pressure sensor deteriorates significantly under disturbed flow conditions at low Reynolds number due to the presence of low frequency components. This deterioration in the signal quality limits the lower operating range of the flowmeter with differential pressure sensor. The output signals of the piezoelectric sensor and differential pressure sensor under no flow condition are compared to obtain the background noise due to piping vibrations and <b>electrical</b> <b>interferences.</b> These results will help a designer to suggest robust signal processing algorithms for vortex frequency detection.

Partial discharge (PD) measurements are for this increasingly used for on-line and off-line condition assessment of rotating machines in the power generation, industrial drive application and traction.

This makes the interpretation of partial discharge measurements on rotating machines much more significant and reliable.

40|$|Detecting partial {{discharges}} in {{the insulation}} system {{of a power}} transformer {{at an early stage}} reduces the risk of total breakdown. One method to detect partial discharges is acoustic measurement. With this technique detection and localisation of partial discharge is possible by placing acoustic sensors {{on the surface of the}} transformer tank. The low impact of <b>electrical</b> <b>interferences</b> from outside the measurement set-up constitutes one of the strengths of the acoustic method. A further advantage is the ability to identify the position of the partial discharge source, which is needed to estimate the risk and to enable a fast and effective repair. The sensitivity and accuracy of the PD localisation can be improved with a combination with conventional electrical measurement or with Ultra High Frequency (UHF) measurement method. Since the UHF measurement method is more advantageous for measurement environments with heavy interferences in the field, the combination with acoustic localisation proves to be useful even in challenging field situations.
