2500|$|A type of {{electric}} propulsion, spacecraft such as Dawn use an ion engine. In an ion engine, electric power {{is used to}} create charged particles of the fuel, usually the gas xenon, and accelerate them to extremely high velocities. The exhaust velocity of conventional rockets {{is limited by the}} chemical energy stored in the fuel’s molecular bonds, which limits the thrust to about 5km/s. [...] This gives them power (for lift-off from Earth, for example) but limits the top speed. By contrast, ion engines have low force, but the top speed in principle is limited only by the electrical power available on the spacecraft and on the <b>gas</b> <b>ions</b> being accelerated. The exhaust speed of the charged particles range from 15km/s to 35km/s.|$|E
5000|$|Alkali ion {{scattering}} spectroscopy (AISS) uses alkali ions {{in place}} of noble <b>gas</b> <b>ions</b> to give a distinctly different type of interaction. The primary difference between AISS and normal ISS is the increase in ion survival probability when using alkali ions. This {{is due to the}} relative stability of alkali (+1) ions as opposed to noble <b>gas</b> <b>ions</b> which have a much stronger energetic incentive for abstracting electrons from the sample. Increasing the ion survival probability results in an increase in ion flux and an improvement in sensitivity, which in turn allows for a reduction in primary ion flux to a point where the method is almost non-destructive. A disadvantage of using alkali ions {{in place of}} noble <b>gas</b> <b>ions</b> is the increased likelihood of adsorption or deposition to the sample surface.|$|E
40|$|In-situ {{purification}} {{of the gas}} used as stopping {{medium in}} a noble <b>gas</b> <b>ion</b> catcher by operating the device at low temperatures of 60 to 150 K was investigated. Alpha-decay recoil ions from a 223 Ra source served as energetic probes. The combined ion survival and transport efficiencies for 219 Rn ions saturated below about 90 K, reaching 28. 7 (17) % in helium, 22. 1 (13) % in neon, and 17. 0 (10) % in argon. These values may well reflect the charge exchange and stripping cross sections during the slowing down of the ions, and thus represent a fundamental upper limit for the efficiency of noble <b>gas</b> <b>ion</b> catcher devices. We suggest the cryogenic noble <b>gas</b> <b>ion</b> catcher as a technically simpler alternative to the ultra-high purity noble <b>gas</b> <b>ion</b> catcher operating at room temperature.

50|$|Rather {{than being}} dispersed, {{a beam of}} charged {{particles}} travelling in an inert gas environment sometimes becomes narrower. This is ascribed to the generation of <b>gas</b> <b>ions</b> which diffuse outwards, neutralizing the particle beam globally, and producing an intense radial electric field which applies a radially inward force to the particles in the beam.|$|E
50|$|An {{electrical}} contactor is an electrically controlled switch which closes a power or high voltage electrical circuit.

40|$|In 2010 {{more than}} 600 {{radiocarbon}} samples were measured with the <b>gas</b> <b>ion</b> source at the MIni CArbon DAting System (MICADAS) at ETH Zurich {{and the number}} of measurements is rising quickly. While most samples contain less than 50 mu g C at present, the <b>gas</b> <b>ion</b> source is attractive as well for larger samples because the time-consuming graphitization is omitted. Additionally, modern samples are now measured down to 5 per-mill counting statistics in less than 30 min with the recently improved <b>gas</b> <b>ion</b> source. In the versatile gas handling system, a stepping-motor-driven syringe presses a mixture of helium and sample CO 2 into the <b>gas</b> <b>ion</b> source, allowing continuous and stable measurements of different kinds of samples. CO 2 can be provided in four different ways to the versatile gas interface. As a primary method. CO 2 is delivered in glass or quartz ampoules. In this case, the CO 2 is released in an automated ampoule cracker with 8 positions for individual samples. Secondly, OX- 1 and blank gas in helium can be provided to the syringe by directly connecting gas bottles to the gas interface at the stage of the cracker. Thirdly, solid samples can be combusted in an elemental analyzer or in a thermo-optical OC/EC aerosol analyzer where the produced CO 2 is transferred to the syringe via a zeolite trap for gas concentration. As a fourth method, CO 2 is released from carbonates with phosphoric acid in septum-sealed vials and loaded onto the same trap used for the elemental analyzer. All four methods allow complete automation of the measurement, even though minor user input is presently still required. Details on the setup, versatility and applications of the gas handling system are given. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

50|$|Ionisers are {{distinct}} from ozone generators, although both devices {{operate in a}} similar way. Ionisers use electrostatically charged plates to produce positively or negatively charged <b>gas</b> <b>ions</b> (for instance N2− or O2−) that particulate matter sticks to in an effect similar to static electricity.

In the negative mode, M−H− ions are produced by either proton abstraction, or M+X− ions are produced by anion attachment. Most work on the APCI-MS analysis has been in positive mode.|$|E
50|$|Resistance affects {{electrical}} {{conditions in the}} dust layer by a potential electric field (voltage drop) being formed across the layer as negatively charged particles arrive at its surface and leak their electrical charges to the collection plate.

Minimum ion beam production costs of 90 to 100 watts per beam ampere (W/A) were obtained for argon, krypton and xenon.

50|$|A {{regulated}} {{electron current}} (typically 10 mA) is emitted from a heated filament. The electrons {{are attracted to}} the helical grid by a DC potential of about +150 V. Most of the electrons pass through the grid and collide with gas molecules in the enclosed volume, causing a fraction {{of them to be}} ionized. The <b>gas</b> <b>ions</b> formed by the electron collisions are attracted to the central ion collector wire by the negative voltage on the collector (typically −30 V). Ion currents are on the order of 1 mA/Pa. This current is amplified and displayed by a high-gain differential amplifier/electrometer.|$|E
50|$|If a poor gas {{quencher}} {{is introduced}} to the tube, the positive argon ions, during their motion toward the cathode, would have multiple collisions with the quencher gas molecules and transfer their charge and some energy to them. Thus, neutral argon atoms would be produced and the quencher <b>gas</b> <b>ions</b> in their turn would reach the cathode, gain electrons therefrom, and move into excited states which would decay by photon emission, producing tube discharge. However, effective quencher molecules, when excited, lose their energy not by photon emission, but by dissociation into neutral quencher molecules. No spurious pulses are thus produced.|$|E
50|$|Ionizer purifiers use charged {{electrical}} surfaces or needles {{to generate}} electrically charged air or <b>gas</b> <b>ions.</b> These ions attach to airborne particles {{which are then}} electrostatically attracted to a charged collector plate. This mechanism produces trace amounts of ozone and other oxidants as by-products. Most ionizers produce less than 0.05 ppm of ozone, an industrial safety standard. There are two major subdivisions: the fanless ionizer and fan-based ionizer. Fanless ionizers are noiseless and use little power, but are less efficient at air purification. Fan-based ionizers clean and distribute air much faster. Permanently mounted home and industrial ionizer purifiers are called electrostatic precipitators.|$|E

40|$|Abstract For many of archaeology’s rarest {{and most}} enigmatic bone {{artifacts}} (e. g. human remains, bone ornaments, worked bone), {{the destruction of}} the 500 mg material necessary for direct accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) dating on graphite targets would cause irreparable damage; therefore many have not been directly dated.

50|$|An {{electron}} avalanche happens between two unconnected electrodes in a gas when an electric field exceeds a certain threshold. Random thermal collisions of gas atoms {{may result in}} a few free electrons and positively charged <b>gas</b> <b>ions,</b> in a process called impact ionization. Acceleration of these free electrons in a strong electric field causes them to gain energy, and when they impact other atoms, the energy causes release of new free electrons and ions (ionization), which fuels the same process. If this process happens faster than it is naturally quenched by ions recombining, the new ions multiply in successive cycles until the gas breaks down into a plasma and current flows freely in a discharge.|$|E
