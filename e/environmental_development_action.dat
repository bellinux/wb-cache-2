50|$|The {{contemporary}} {{consumer movement}} {{is among the}} fastest-growing social movements in Africa today. One indicator of this is membership of African consumer groups into Consumers International; in 1991, forty African countries had no representation in this network. <b>Environmental</b> <b>Development</b> <b>Action</b> in the Third World collaborated with Consumer International until 1994 and by 1995, only 15 countries were not participating and many countries had made stronger commitments to participation in the organized network. In 1994 50 delegates from Africa participated in the annual Consumers International World Congress {{and as a result}} participated {{in the development of the}} Codex Alimentarius, General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and World Trade Organization issues. Participation in Consumers International has otherwise raised the profile of various consumer groups, such as Mali's Association des Consommateurs du Mali (ASCOMA) and Senegal's Association de Defense des Usagers de l'Eau l'Electricite, les Telecommunications et les Services (ADEETelS) have both had representation in government policy making.|$|E

40|$|Conventional and unscientific mining poses severe {{threat to}} life, public {{property}} and continuation of mining in the area. Incompatible land uses, huge waste dumps and large scale land transformation {{have resulted in}} land degradation, ponding, flooding, water contamination and health hazards in Makrana mining area. Segregation of dumps, compatible land use, research and development activity for use of marble slurry are suggested measures for reclamation and restoration of the degraded land. While {{for the purpose of}} development and economic upliftment of people, {{there is a need for}} establishment of industrial project, but these have to be environmentally friendly. Therefore it is essential to assess the impacts of mining on different environmental parameters, before starting the mining operations, so that abatement measures could be planned in advance for eco-friendly mining in the area. Environmental impact assessment (EIA) is a systematic process that examines the <b>environmental</b> consequences of <b>development</b> <b>action</b> like mining, cement, transport, river valley. EIA systematically examines booth beneficial and adverse consequences of the proposed project and ensures that these impacts are taken into account during the project design...|$|R
