5|$|Another {{question}} in the case was whether the High Court, sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns, had jurisdiction to <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> case. Hill argued {{that because of the}} structure of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, the court could not <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> case. She argued that elections could not be disputed by petition if the dispute was about the eligibility of a candidate, as another provision of the Act meant that it would require a resolution of the relevant house of Parliament, the Senate in this case.|$|E
5|$|Both parties {{appealed to}} the Supreme Court, which, after noting a Wisconsin Supreme Court {{decision}} in the same area, granted certiorari and agreed to <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> case.|$|E

500|$|<b>The</b> <b>hearing</b> was {{not open}} to the public and {{initially}} was not publicized.

50|$|When {{looking at}} the source of {{knowledge}} about an event, <b>hearing</b> <b>the</b> news from the media or from another person does not cause a difference in reaction, rather causes {{a difference in the}} type of information that is encoded to ones memory.

5|$|The Court has no {{original}} {{jurisdiction in}} most cases, {{meaning that it}} can only hear cases appealed to the Court after having been previously heard in lower courts. Most cases begin in local circuit courts, where the initial trial is held and a jury decides {{the outcome of the}} case. The circuit court decision can be appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals or the Indiana Tax Court, who can <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> case or enforce the lower court's decision. If the parties still disagree with the outcome of the case, they can appeal the decision to the Indiana Supreme Court. The Court can choose to <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> case and possibly overturn the previous judgment, or it can decline to accept the case and uphold the decision of the lower courts.|$|E
