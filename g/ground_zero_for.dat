[...] Rolling Stone senior editor David Fricke noted in 2000 that Byrdmaniax suffered not just from Melcher's inappropriate orchestration but also from being a Byrds' album that is almost totally bereft of The Byrds' signature sound. [...] Fricke noted that the familiar chime of McGuinn's 12-string Rickenbacker guitar is lost beneath the overbearing strings and the band's trademark harmonies are also largely absent from the album.|$|E
2500|$|A central {{timing and}} firing system was on board Atlanta to direct photo planes, smoke rockets and {{hundreds}} of recording instruments, the synchronization of which was essential. The test shots resembled a small nuclear explosion, creating a shock wave {{on the water and}} an expanding shock condensation cloud. The fireball and mushroom cloud were present (but obviously no radiation or dangerous fallout was produced). The blast created an overpressure of 10 psi on the target, a moving wall of highly compressed air with maximum wind speeds of 294mph. An overpressure blast of that magnitude is equivalent to a [...] burst at roughly 8000 feet and is sufficient to be lethal and capable of destroying reinforced concrete buildings. Knowing the yield of the blast, this also implies the Atlanta was placed around 800 feet away from <b>ground</b> <b>zero</b> <b>for</b> that particular test. Two blimps were also destroyed high above ground, and a life size mannequin placed on the deck facing the blast was violently thrown over. The first test Bravo also produced a large amount of rock ejecta that caused secondary damage. To solve this problem, the second shot was placed over a five-foot mound of sand, and the last shot Delta was detonated over the previous crater that was back filled with 39,000 cubic yards of sand.|$|E

The Douglasses, joined by other activists seeking to prevent the installation of Trident missiles, formed a small intentional community, the Pacific Life Community, near the submarine base. Their goal was to [...] "seek the truth of a nonviolent way of life," [...] both personally and politically.

5000|$|The game sold 574,957 copies {{after two}} weeks on sale in Japan.

In Europe the game failed to chart in most countries and placed 13th in the UK its first week, and by its third week {{had fallen out of}} the top 40. In the United States the game similarly failed to make the top 20 during its first month, selling only 52,000 physical UMD copies, a markedly worse performance than Metal Gear Acid. However, with the PSP's digital content delivery option through PSN, it has been noted that perhaps sales on the PSP should be counted differently since digital downloads on PSP and PSPgo are not counted. [...] Industry analyst Mike Hickey told IGN that poor sales of the PSP platform itself was likely [...] "the main cause" [...] for Peace Walkers unimpressive sales. However, Konami has stated they have a profit of $15 million from sales of Peace Walker and Pro Evolution Soccer games, but they did not provide sales figures for Peace Walker. They have however, said Peace Walker sales helped Metal Gear games sell 1.27 million copies for the quarter. The low sales of Peace Walker overseas was cited by Hideo Kojima as the reason why Kazuhira Miller was omitted from the box art of Metal Gear Solid V: <b>Ground</b> <b>Zeroes</b> <b>for</b> its international release.|$|R
