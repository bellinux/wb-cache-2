25|$|Tuvaluans {{are well}} known for their {{seafaring}} skills, with the Tuvalu Maritime Training Institute on Amatuku motu (island), Funafuti, providing training to approximately 120 marine cadets each year so {{that they have the}} skills necessary for employment as seafarers on merchant shipping. The Tuvalu Overseas Seamen's Union (TOSU) is the only registered trade union in Tuvalu. It represents workers on foreign ships. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) estimates that 800 Tuvaluan men are trained, certified and active as seafarers. The ADB estimates that, at any one time, about 15% of the adult male population works abroad as seafarers. Job opportunities also exist as observers on tuna boats where the role is to monitor compliance with the boat's tuna <b>fishing</b> <b>licence.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The Asian Development Bank {{described}} the Global Economic Crisis (GEC) as impacting on Tuvalu through: “(i) lower demand for Tuvalu seafarers and, therefore, falling remittances; (ii) volatile exchange rate movements affecting {{the value of}} remittances, revenues from <b>fishing</b> <b>licence</b> fees, and food prices; and (iii) lower {{market value of the}} Tuvalu Trust Fund (TTF), which at the end of May 2010 was about 12% below the maintained value. Thus, {{as a direct result of}} the GEC, no distribution was made from the fund to the budget for 2010 and further distributions are unlikely while there is uncertainty in international financial markets.” ...|$|E
