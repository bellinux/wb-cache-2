5|$|On opening day, {{there was}} {{considerable}} comment on the uniform of the hostesses from the UK Pavilion. The dresses <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>designed</b> to the then-new miniskirt style, popularized a year earlier by Mary Quant.|$|E
5|$|David Gwin, the {{economic}} development director for College Station, {{is working with the}} mall on a possible $8.5 million renovation project to give the mall a further boost. As of 2008, details about what the renovations would entail have not been released. In February 2009, the city noted that plans <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>designed</b> to renovate both the interior and exterior of the mall.|$|E
5|$|Due to laxer laws about {{building}} housing on major roads, as London suburbs developed, properties {{were allowed to}} be built on the North Circular Road. The original purpose-built road <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>designed</b> with no speed limit, as was typically {{the case in the}} 1920s, but by 1951 a 30mph speed limit was enforced along the route.|$|E

To perform the experiment, a 25 k gate CMOS Test Chip <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>designed,</b> manufactured (5491 devices), and evaluated with over 300 tests. The chip contains five types of CUTs derived from functions in production ASICs...|$|R
5|$|In 1919, {{he changed}} his surname to Gilbert-Carter. In the early 1920s, he moved back to Barbados, and lived at Ilaro Court, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>designed</b> and built by Lady Gilbert Carter. He died there on 18 January 1927. When his will was probated on 22 March of that year, {{the total value of}} his effects was £6859 9s 11d.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool Street <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>designed</b> to {{integrate}} with the expanding London Underground network, {{and served as}} the new terminus for the Metropolitan Railway which extended east from Moorgate. From 1874 to 1875 the Metropolitan Railway used the Liverpool Street main-line station as a terminus; on 12 July 1875 the company opened their own station, initially called Bishopsgate. Subsurface platforms 1 and 2, were opened in 1875.|$|E
5|$|Mickiewicz {{spent his}} {{childhood}} in Navahrudak, initially taught by his mother and private tutors. From 1807 to 1815 he attended a Dominican school following a curriculum that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>designed</b> by the now-defunct Polish Commission for National Education, which had been the world's first ministry of education. He was a mediocre student, although active in games, theatricals, and the like.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} built in the Unity game engine, which enabled faster {{prototyping}} across multiple smartphone platforms. It was also designed first to fit on the iPhone's smaller screen—a lesson learned from Hitman Go, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>designed</b> for tablets. The Square Enix team collaborated with Tomb Raider brand owners Crystal Dynamics to fit the series license. The player-character outfits, in particular, were informed by this exchange.|$|E
5|$|Another problem {{exposed by}} Rolling Thunder was the unpreparedness of the Air Force for the {{operations}} it was undertaking. Its aircraft <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>designed</b> and its pilots trained for strategic operations against the Soviet Union – for nuclear, not conventional war. The new campaign exposed {{years of neglect}} in conventional tactics, while aircraft capabilities and armament were ill-suited to the task at hand. The Air Force was also embarrassed {{by the fact that}} the Navy was better prepared. It possessed the only all-weather bomber in the U.S. inventory in the new A-6 Intruder and was also responsible for the development of the F-4 Phantom fighter-bomber, which became ubiquitous during the Vietnam War.|$|E
5|$|Bernard Lovell {{built the}} Transit Telescope at Jodrell Bank {{in the late}} 1940s. This was a -diameter radio {{telescope}} that could only point directly upwards; {{the next logical step}} was to build a telescope that could look at all parts of the sky so that more sources could be observed, as well as for longer integration times. Although the Transit Telescope <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>designed</b> and constructed by the astronomers that used it, a fully steerable telescope would need to be professionally designed and constructed; the first challenge was to find an engineer willing to do the job. This turned out to be Charles Husband, whom Lovell first met on 8 September 1949.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the only}} {{surviving}} structures known to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>designed</b> by Downing <b>is</b> the cottage at Springside (Matthew Vassar Estate) in Poughkeepsie, New York. The cottage and the estate's gardens <b>designed</b> by Downing <b>are</b> a National Historic Landmark. The Cedarcliff Gatehouse is also believed to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>designed</b> by him.|$|R
5|$|Fernando Alonso {{began the}} weekend's event knowing {{he would start}} {{from the back of}} the grid due to a number of {{penalties}} incurred for changing engine parts. Honda provided him with an upgraded internal combustion engine, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>designed</b> using the team's last four in-season development tokens. Alonso's McLaren teammate Jenson Button had to continue using the old-specification engine at this race as Honda only had one of the upgraded power units available. However, Alonso used the new power unit only in the first practice session before switching back to the older unit, albeit voicing satisfaction with the performance of the new specification.|$|E
5|$|GRBs {{were first}} {{detected}} in 1967 by the Vela satellites, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>designed</b> to detect covert nuclear weapons tests. Following their discovery, hundreds of theoretical models were proposed to explain these bursts, such as collisions between comets and neutron stars. Little information {{was available to}} verify these models until the 1997 detection of the first X-ray and optical afterglows and direct measurement of their redshifts using optical spectroscopy, and thus their distances and energy outputs. These discoveries, and subsequent studies of the galaxies and supernovae associated with the bursts, clarified the distance and luminosity of GRBs, definitively placing them in distant galaxies.|$|E
5|$|Gneisenau {{was laid}} {{down at the}} AG Weser {{shipyard}} in Bremen, Germany in 1904, under construction number 144. She was launched on 14 June 1906, and commissioned into the fleet nearly two years later on 6 March 1908. The ship cost the German government 19,243,000 goldmarks. The ship <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>designed</b> for service with the High Seas Fleet, though it {{was found to be}} too weak for service with the battle fleet; instead it was deployed overseas, a role in which it performed well.|$|E

5|$|In October 1834 Richard Weobley, the Clerk of Works, {{received}} {{instructions from}} Treasury officials {{to clear the}} old tally sticks while parliament was adjourned. He decided against giving the sticks away to parliamentary staff to use as firewood, and instead opted to burn them in the two heating furnaces of the House of Lords, directly below the peers' chambers. The furnaces <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>designed</b> to burn coal—which gives off a high heat with little flame—and not wood, which burns with a high flame. The flues of the furnaces ran up {{the walls of the}} basement in which they were housed, under the floors of the Lords' chamber, then up through the walls and out through the chimneys.|$|E
5|$|In early 1943, the Nazis {{decided to}} {{increase}} greatly the gassing capacity of Birkenau. Crematorium II, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>designed</b> as a mortuary with morgues {{in the basement}} and ground-level incinerators, was converted into a killing factory by installing gas-tight doors, vents for the Zyklon B (a highly lethal cyanide-based pesticide) to be dropped into the chamber, and ventilation equipment to remove the gas thereafter. It went into operation in March. Crematorium III was built using the same design. Crematoria IV and V, designed from the start as gassing centers, were also constructed that spring. By June 1943, all four crematoria were operational. Most of the victims were killed using these four structures.|$|E
5|$|In late 1939, the Southern Railway, {{until then}} {{primarily}} a high-density commuter railway serving London and South-East England, {{much of it}} electrified with third-rail pick-up, found itself on the British front line of the Second World War, with a severe lack of modern freight-handling capability. The newest freight design was the Q Class 0-6-0 of 1938, the last locomotive designed by Richard Maunsell. Built to essentially Victorian era principles, these <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>designed</b> as replacements {{for many of the}} older 0-6-0s inherited by the Southern Railway in 1923, and entered service in January 1938. Maunsell, having retired at the end of October 1937, was replaced by Oliver Bulleid.|$|E

5|$|Lars' {{inclusion}} in Naruto Shipuuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 2 was initially conceived of by CyberConnect2 CEO Hiroshi Matsuyama. In 2009, Matsuyama {{read in a}} Weekly Shōnen Jump magazine that Lars' third costume <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>designed</b> by Kishimoto and thought he {{should be included in}} Ultimate Ninja Storm 2. As a result, Matsuyama approached Tekken 6 producer Suguru Sasaki and his team and asked them to include Lars in the game using Kishimoto's outfit. Once this was approved, the Tekken staff started assisting CyberConnect2 to adjust Lars' moves to fit the other characters in the Naruto game. When the work was concluded, Matsuyama was surprised at how well Lars fitted in with the game's cast.|$|E
5|$|Planners {{believed}} the SEALs {{could get to}} Abbottabad and back without being challenged by the Pakistani military. The helicopters {{to be used in}} the raid <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>designed</b> to be quiet and to have low radar visibility. Since the U.S. had helped equip and train the Pakistanis, their defensive capabilities were known. The U.S. had supplied F-16 Fighting Falcons to Pakistan on the condition they were kept at a Pakistani military base under 24-hour U.S. surveillance.|$|E
5|$|Pricing {{was central}} to the {{marketing}} strategy, {{as it had been}} through Sinclair's career. The ZX81 <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>designed</b> to meet a £70 price point and was launched at a price of £69.95 (built) or £49.95 (kit). One Sinclair brochure presented a side-by-side comparison of the ZX81 with the four machines that Sinclair considered its main rivals – the Acorn Atom, Apple II Plus, Commodore PET and TRS-80. The comparison highlighted the vast differences in cost, from £630 {{in the case of the}} Apple II Plus to just £70 for the ZX81, though even by Sinclair's own comparison the Apple was by far the more capable machine.|$|E
