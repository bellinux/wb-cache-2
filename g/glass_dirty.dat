60|$|It was {{a nondescript}} building, half canvas and half boards. The {{interior}} {{seen through the}} open door was fitted up with side shelves, a counter carelessly piled with provisions, groceries, clothing, and hardware--with no attempt at display or even ordinary selection--and a table, on which stood a demijohn and three or four <b>dirty</b> <b>glasses.</b> Two roughly dressed men, whose long, matted beards and hair left only their eyes and lips visible in the tangled hirsute wilderness below their slouched hats, were leaning against the opposite sides of the doorway, smoking.

40|$|The {{accuracy}} and working condition of 210 sphygmomanometers were tested: 100 (50 and mercury and 50 aneroid) models {{were used in}} family practices and 100 mercury models in hospitals. Faults in the inflation-deflation system were common and caused mainly by dirt or wear in the control valves. Leakage occurred in 48 % of the hospital and 33 % of the family practice sphygmomanometers. In the mercury models the mercury or air vents were often in an unsatisfactory condition or the calibrated <b>glass</b> tube <b>dirty.</b> The accuracy of the gauges was examined at 90 and 150 mm Hg: fewer than 2 % of the mercury sphygmomanometers but 30 % of the aneroid models had errors greater than +/- 4 mm Hg at either pressure. Over half of the cuffs examined had bladders widths less than the recommended size, and 94 % had bladders shorter than the length recommended for use on normal adults. Mercury sphygmomanometers should be bought in preference to aneroid models as they are more accurate, less expensive in the long term, and can be maintained by the owner; they should be checked every six to 12 months depending on usage. Replacement parts should be kept readily available...|$|R
6000|$|And they ventured {{under the}} archway, as into {{the jaws of}} the dragon. They emerged into a wide yard, like a well, with {{buildings}} all round. It was littered with straw and boxes, and cardboard. The sunshine actually caught one crate whose straw was streaming on to the yard like gold. But elsewhere the place was like a pit. There were several doors, and two flights of steps. Straight in front, on a <b>dirty</b> <b>glass</b> door {{at the top of}} a staircase, loomed the ominous words [...] "Thomas Jordan and Son--Surgical Appliances."

Here he gave his name to a clerk, who thrust a very oily head out of a kind of mahogany box, and was told that Mr. Ranson was engaged, but that, if he cared to wait, perhaps he would see him later on. He said he would wait, and was shown into a stuffy little room, furnished with ancient deed-boxes and a very large, old leather-covered sofa that took up half the place. Here he sat for a while, staring at a square of <b>dirty</b> <b>glass</b> which gave what light was available, and reflecting upon things in general.|$|R
5000|$|DJ Kat was {{a puppet}} {{with a black}} leather jacket who loved {{spinning}} his records. He also liked to eat junk from the trash cans.

It's a D and a J and a Kat with a K."The reason it is spelled with a K is because the Dutch spell cat with a k and Linda de Mol is Dutch.

500|$|The {{two pages}} in {{question}} {{consisted of the}} short sketch [...] "Roderick O'Conor", concerning the historic last king of Ireland cleaning up after guests by drinking the dregs of their <b>dirty</b> <b>glasses.</b> Joyce completed another four short sketches in July and August 1923, while holidaying in Bognor. The sketches, which dealt with different aspects of Irish history, {{are commonly known as}} [...] "Tristan and Isolde", [...] "Saint Patrick and the Druid," [...] "Kevin's Orisons" [...] and [...] "Mamalujo". While these sketches would eventually be incorporated into Finnegans Wake in one form or another, they did not contain any of the main characters or plot points which would later come to constitute the backbone of the book. The first signs of what would eventually become Finnegans Wake came in August 1923 when Joyce wrote the sketch [...] "Here Comes Everybody", which dealt {{for the first time with}} the book's protagonist HCE.|$|R
60|$|He {{was sitting}} in this state with a map before him, and with the squire's letter upon the map, when Matthew, the butler, {{opened the door and}} {{announced}} a visitor. As soon as Mr. Barry had gone, he had supported nature by a mutton-chop and a glass of sherry, and the debris were now lying on the side-table. His first idea was to bid Matthew at once remove the glass and the bone, and the unfinished potato and the crust of bread. To be taken with such remnants by any visitor would be bad, but by this visitor would be dreadful. Lunch should be eaten in the dining-room, where chop bones and <b>dirty</b> <b>glasses</b> would be in their place. But here in his book-room they would be disgraceful. But then, as Matthew was hurriedly collecting the two plates and the salt-cellar, his master began to doubt whether this visitor should be received at all. It was no other than Miss Thoroughbung.|$|R

One was the harpoon with which the deed was committed. It had been {{snatched}} down from a rack on the wall. Two others remained there, {{and there was a}} vacant place for the third. On the stock was engraved 'SS. SEA UNICORN, Dundee.' This seemed to establish that the crime had been done in a moment of fury, and that the murderer had seized the first weapon which came in his way. The fact that the crime was committed at two in the morning, and yet Peter Carey was fully dressed, suggested that he had an appointment with the murderer, which is borne out by the fact that a bottle of rum and two <b>dirty</b> <b>glasses</b> stood upon the table." ...|$|R
50|$|The only clue from an {{eyewitness}} {{comes from a}} stonemason named Slater, who says that he saw {{the shadow of a}} head on the blind in one of Carey’s cabin windows, and he is sure that it was not Carey. The next day, Carey was in his foulest mood, and then early the next morning, at about two o’clock, his daughter heard a scream {{from the direction of the}} cabin, but took no notice, as Carey often screamed when he was drunk. The murder was not discovered until about midday, when the ladies summoned enough courage to look in on him. Hopkins was soon on the scene. Carey was fully dressed, suggesting that he was expecting a visitor, and there was some rum laid out along with two <b>dirty</b> <b>glasses.</b> There were brandy and whisky, too, but neither had been touched. There was also a knife in its sheath at Carey's feet; Mrs. Carey has identified it as her husband’s.|$|R

The room, like the rest of the house, had been {{stripped}} of everything, with the solitary exceptions of a box and a mattress, beside which were an empty bottle and a <b>dirty</b> <b>glass.</b> On the mattress sat the fair Edithia, /alias/ Mrs. d'Aubigne, /alias/ the Tiger, /alias/ Mrs. Quest, and such a sight as she presented George had never seen before. Her fierce face bore traces of recent heavy drinking and was moreover dirty, haggard and dreadful to look upon; her hair was a frowsy mat, on some patches of which the golden dye had faded, leaving it its natural hue of doubtful grey. She wore no collar and her linen was open at the neck. On her feet were a filthy pair of white satin slippers, and on her back that same gorgeous pink satin tea-gown which Mr. Quest had observed on the occasion of his visit, now however soiled and torn. Anything more squalid or repulsive than the whole picture cannot be imagined, and though his nerves were pretty strong, and in the course of his life he had seen many a sight of utter destitution, George literally recoiled from it.|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundVision {{loss from}} {{glaucoma}} {{has traditionally been}} described as loss of "peripheral vision. " In this prospective study, we aimed to improve our clinical understanding of the visual symptoms caused by glaucoma by asking patients specific detailed questions about how they see. MethodsPatients who were clinically diagnosed with various types and stages of glaucoma were included. All had a comprehensive ocular examination, including Octopus visual field testing. Patients were excluded if they had other ocular conditions that affected their vision, including cornea, lens or retina pathologies. Patients responded to an oral questionnaire about their visual symptoms. We investigated the visual symptoms described by patients with glaucoma and correlated the severity of visual field loss with visual symptoms reported. ResultsNinety-nine patients completed the questionnaire. Most patients (76 %) were diagnosed with primary open-angle glaucoma. The most common symptoms reported by all patients, including patients with early or moderate glaucoma, were needing more light and blurry vision. Patients with a greater amount of field loss (Octopus mean defect>+ 9. 4 dB) {{were more likely to}} report difficulty seeing objects to one or both sides, as if looking through <b>dirty</b> <b>glasses</b> and trouble differentiating boundaries and colors. ConclusionsVision loss in patients with glaucoma is not as simple as the traditional view of loss of peripheral vision. Needing more light and blurry vision were the most common symptoms reported by patients with glaucoma...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: I {{argue that}} the system of {{interacting}} bosons at zero temperature and in random external potential possesses a simple critical point which describes the proliferation of disorder-induced defects in the superfluid ground state, and which is located at weak disorder close to and above one dimension. This {{makes it possible to}} address the critical behavior at the superfluid-Bose <b>glass</b> transition in <b>dirty</b> boson systems by expanding around the lower critical dimension of d = 1. Within the formulated renormalization procedure near d = 1 the dynamical critical exponent is obtained exactly and the correlation length critical exponent is calculated as a Laurent series in the parameter √ ǫ, with ǫ = d − 1 : z = d, ν = 1 / √ 3 ǫ + O (√ √ ǫ) for the short-range, and z = 1, ν = 2 / 3 ǫ + O (√ ǫ), for the long-range Coulomb interaction between bosons. The identified critical point should be stable against the residual perturbations in the effective action for the superfluid, at least in dimensions 1 ≤ d ≤ 2, for both short-range and Coulomb interactions. For the superfluid-Mott insulator transition in the system in a periodic potential and at a commensurate density of bosons I find ν = (1 / 2 √ ǫ) + 1 / 4 + O (√ ǫ), which yields a result reasonable close to the known X...|$|R

50|$|The {{pregnant}} woman (Victim 100, portrayed by Andrea Alfonso) {{is the first}} to be brutalized. All the while, Victims' 101 and 102 are screaming and moaning through their tightly gagged mouths. Accompanying their gagged moaning is a industrial music score by El Hemisferio Derecho. Victim 100 is beaten, several of her fingers are cut off and a bag is pulled over her head, which is stomped and kicked repeatedly. The masked killer gropes Victim 100, stomps her stomach, bites one of her nipples off, mutilates her genitals with a chef knife, and proceeds to cut her open with the knife. Before moving on, the masked killer then removes the gag of Victim 102 and orally rapes her with the same chef knife while also masturbating. He then reapplies her gag and drags Victim 100 to the bathroom. With the killer now out of sight, Victim 102 flings a shard of broken <b>glass</b> from the <b>dirty</b> and trash-laden floor with her bare toes to her hands bound behind her to start cutting the rope that binds her wrists {{to the back of the}} chair. Coming out of the bathroom, the killer now goes to work on the porn star (Victim 101, portrayed by Silvia Paz). He beats her with a hammer, rips one of her eyes out, asphyxiates her with a bag, knocks her front teeth out with a chisel, and urinates on and rapes her.|$|R
5000|$|... ‘You’re {{not very}} good at it, are you?’ said Gust, ‘they ought to have sent heavies in.’ He thought the man very likely could have got a job playing Hess in this new TV series they were doing on the war, and he would have had a word with a few {{directors}} he knew in Soho if he had been a mate of his. But, as he wasn’t, Gust kicked him in the stomach as he tried to drag himself up on one leg {{with the help of the}} bar-rail, then turned back to the other man. ‘You all right?’ he said. ‘How are you feeling now? Chipper?’ He took one of the man’s ears in his thumb and forefinger; the ear was tiny, considering the size of his head, and it had little hairs inside it. Gust picked up a cocktail stick out of a <b>dirty</b> <b>glass</b> on the bar and jabbed it down into the eardrum as far as he could; when he pulled it out the stick was half-way red, and there was some grey stuff in it as well. He shouted down his ear: ‘I think I just broke your foot!’ but the man wasn’t making sense any more; he was wailing with his hand clapped to the side of his head, swaying up and down from the waist like a bereaved widow, or else perhaps he just didn’t hear, or maybe the music was too loud. Gust realised then that he had pushed the stick in too far and that the man would probably die. Dirty cocktail-stick in the brain? What a bleeding way to go! Now the man with the broken leg tried another naughty stroke; although he only had one hand free because he was using the other one to hold onto the rail, he still managed to smash a glass and try putting it in Gust’s face. ‘This is just self-defence after all,’ Gust said to himself. He stamped on the man’s feet again; this time he definitely felt bones go and the man screamed, dropped the glass and let go of the rail; but instead of letting him fall Gust took him round the waist, ripped his fly open and searched inside his pants until he found his testicles, which he yanked right out into his hand. Their owner can’t have been much into baths because they smelled like something tepid from a canteen counter. Gust wrung them like the devil having a go at a set of wedding bells with all the grip he had, until the man was shrieking on the same D minor as the music. ‘It’s nothing personal,’ said Gust, ‘but I’m afraid you’re going to have to learn to fuck all over again.’ He wiped the blood off the man’s prick down his face, then pulled the face towards him and drove his nose into his brain with his head. The music boosted into E major on a key change, and the man doubled up under a bar-stool, leaving a lot of blood behind him while Gust receded into the half darkness towards the black drapes on the walls. —Brand New Dead, pp. 86-87 ...|$|R
