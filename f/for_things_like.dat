25|$|The {{software}} utility Cron is a time-based {{job scheduler}} in Unix-like computer operating systems.

It typically automates system maintenance or administration—though its general-purpose nature makes it useful <b>for</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> downloading files from the Internet and downloading email at regular intervals. The origin of the name cron is from the Greek word for time, χρόνος (chronos).|$|E

The texts deal without exception with administrative matters such as the rationing of foodstuffs or listing objects and animals. Literary genres like hymns and king lists, which become very popular later in Mesopotamian history, are absent. Two different counting systems were in use: a sexagesimal system for animals and humans, for example, and a bisexagesimal system <b>for</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> grain, cheese, and fresh fish. Contemporary archives have been found at Tell Uqair, Tell Khafajah, and Uruk.|$|E

Some bill acceptors found in vending machines, self checkout lanes, and other automated kiosks are configured to accommodate two-dollar bills, even if the fact is not stated on the label.

25|$|In many jurisdictions (including many American states), {{there is}} a general tax levied {{periodically}} on residents who own personal property (personalty) within the jurisdiction. Vehicle and boat registration fees are subsets of this kind of tax. The tax is often designed with blanket coverage and large exceptions <b>for</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> food and clothing. Household goods are often exempt when kept or used within the household. Any otherwise non-exempt object can lose its exemption if regularly kept outside the household. Thus, tax collectors often monitor newspaper articles for stories about wealthy people who have lent art to museums for public display, because the artworks have then become subject to personal property tax. If an artwork had to be sent to another state for some touch-ups, it may have become subject to personal property tax in that state as well.|$|E

Her big taste <b>for</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> clothes and male strippers have run Al into debt on numerous occasions. A recurring joke in the series is Al's regret of having married Peggy in the first place; the union was forced on him at shotgun-point. Peggy's best friend is Marcy, with whom she occasionally conspires against Al. Her family is a stereotypical backwoods clan of degenerates whom she often forces the other Bundys to endure, especially her morbidly obese mother whom Al finds intolerable.|$|E

25|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, these uniforms became outdated. The Fechheimer Bros. of Cincinnati {{created some}} uniforms for OSU. These uniforms {{were the same}} navy blue as the {{previous}} uniforms, except the buttons were changed to silver. At this time the chin straps and Eagle Ohio were also changed to silver. The plumes took on the modern red and gray appearance and were constructed of tough turkey feathers. The spats were changed from cloth to vinyl during this time as well. The shoulder patches changed design and size. The uniforms changed very little from the 1970s until 1988, except <b>for</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> hat manufacturer, a short period in which a large metal diamond Ohio replaced the Eagle Ohio, {{and the use of}} aluminum hat bands instead of the silver adjustable type. After the directorship of Charles Spohn, the Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma recognition bars were no longer authorized for wear on the OSUMB uniform. During the expansion years in the 1970s, many uniforms dating back to the 1940s had to be dug out of storage and updated with the current patch designs of the band. To a careful and up-close observer, one would notice significant differences in the cut and style of the uniforms being worn. Even hats were not standardized. The only common thread among the uniforms was the color, which even began to fade on older uniforms. It was common practice for band members to use black marker to fix frayed parts of the uniform which exposed white cotton lining. These uniforms also had to be used by the Military band, and were falling apart. Pieces were sourced as needed from manufacturers such as Ostwald, Bayly, Frechheimer, and DeMoulin Brothers. The Fechheimer Corporation began producing a police uniform in the 1980s that matched the design of the Marching Band uniforms. These eventually became the standard replacement uniform coat until 1989, when Dr. Woods commissioned a new uniform style.|$|E

500|$|O'Donnell {{said in an}} {{interview}} that he feels that one problem with games is those that play music non-stop, which he feels detracts from the overall impact. Composers are forced to either write ambient music, he says, or very light music that is not emotionally driven, which he said is a detriment. O'Donnell prefers to write music towards the end of the development cycle, because he would rather score the final timing <b>for</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> cinematics and gameplay changes. O'Donnell credits part of the success of the Halo theme to his background writing jingles. For that music, O'Donnell had to make sure he could write music that would [...] "get in people's heads" [...] after 15 to 30seconds. O'Donnell pushed Bungie to spend money on hiring singers and musicians to record the theme before Macworld as a way to present a strong showing.|$|E

Some stages offer Yoshi the ability to morph into vehicles for a short time. Like the original Yoshi's Island, the DS game differs from many platforming series in that Yoshi does not have a life bar; when Yoshi is hit, the baby he is carrying falls off his back and Yoshi must retrieve him or her before a timer expires. (unless Yoshi falls on something that kills him instantly, such as a lava pit or spike field) ...|$|E
500|$|The Torchwood Archives, {{published}} {{after the}} second series in 2008, is a companion book written by Gary Russell which gives an [...] "insider's look" [...] {{into the life of}} Jack and the Torchwood team. The book collects and re-publishes ancillary material which appeared on the Torchwood website in the first two seasons, and provides new material such as rough dates <b>for</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> Jack's marriage as relayed by the book's fictional narrator. The book is composed of fictitious archive notes, personnel forms, photographs, newspaper clippings and staff memos, and offers revelations about the character which would later be confirmed by the television series. [...] For example, Archives first mention Jack's lover Lucia Moretti, who is mentioned in Children of Earth. In a similar vein to The Torchwood Archives but from a real-world perspective, Gary Russell's The Torchwood Encyclopedia (2009) expands on [...] "every fact and figure" [...] for Jack and the Torchwood world.|$|E
500|$|During an {{interview}} for his new television series Homeland, 24 executive producer Howard Gordon addressed {{the impact of the}} series, describing it as [...] "stunning - everyone from Rush Limbaugh to Bill Clinton would talk about it, and we knew they were among our fans. I guess when people used it as propaganda for their own ideas—you know, when Justice Scalia mentioned Jack Bauer—that would make me feel uncomfortable." [...] On the topic of torture and Islamophobia within the series, Gordon said, [...] "I think the one thing that we all felt very confident about—although we had a vigorous behind-the-scenes debate—was at what point are we loyal and beholden to good storytelling, and at what level do you hold yourself accountable <b>for</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> stoking Islamophobia or promoting torture as a policy? There were just certain things that we needed to portray {{in order to make it}} feel thrilling—and real, even. When discussing his regrets, he referred to an advertisement for the show for its fourth season (though mistakenly quoted it as an advertisement for the second season, saying [...] "I actually do have regrets about one particular moment, which had more to do with the promotion of the show. In season four, the story involved a Muslim American family, and the father and the mother—and the son—were party to a terror plot. It was sort of a purple conceit in a way. But it was maybe a year and a half after 9/11, and on the 405 freeway there's this giant electronic billboard, and I think the line was: [...] "They could be next door." [...] The writers and the producers were not party to that campaign, but we quickly put an end to it, and realized how dangerous and potentially incendiary this show could be. And I think our awareness of that changed the way we approached the series. So I guess you could call it a regret, but it was really an epiphany.|$|E
