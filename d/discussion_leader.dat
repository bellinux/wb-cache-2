40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{focused on the}} special role of <b>discussion</b> <b>leaders</b> and their {{engagement}} in the facilitation of online discussions {{in comparison to the}} online teacher. The methodology combined quantitative data of students’ frequency behaviour with qualitative discourse analysis of students’ individual contributions.
