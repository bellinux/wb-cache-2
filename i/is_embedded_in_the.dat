5|$|Collybia cookei is {{most likely}} to be {{confused}} with the two other members of Collybia, both of which are outwardly similar in appearance; distinguishing between the three typically requires excavating the stem base away from the moss or debris in which the stem <b>is</b> <b>embedded.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> field, C.tuberosa may be distinguished from C.cookei by its dark brown sclerotia that somewhat resembles an appleseed. Using a microscope provides a more definitive way of distinguishing the two: the hyphae in the sclerotia of C.cookei are rounded, while those of C.tuberosa are elongated; this diagnostic character is apparent with both fresh and dried material of the two species. C.cirrhata does not produce sclerotia.|$|E

5|$|The Solar System {{is in the}} Local Interstellar Cloud or Local Fluff.

The Local Interstellar Cloud is an area of denser cloud in an otherwise sparse region known as the Local Bubble, an hourglass-shaped cavity in the interstellar medium roughly 300 light-years (ly) across. The bubble is suffused with high-temperature plasma, that suggests it is the product of several recent supernovae.|$|E

The mediaeval chain, as in Ramon Lull's Ladder of Ascent and Descent of the Mind, 1305, added steps or levels above humans, with orders of angels reaching up to God at the top.|$|E
5|$|Two sculptures made by Dan Corson were {{installed}} at the station's underground level: Portals consists of a wall of portals with images from the Hubble Space Telescope, microscopes, and the deep sea at the elevator lobby; Space Forms {{is a series of}} brightly-colored, translucent sculptures suspended above the platforms that resemble microscopic creatures floating under a microscope. An additional installation, Bill Bell's Light Sticks, <b>is</b> <b>embedded</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> walls of the Beacon Hill Tunnel. A series of LED displays, typically showing images of playing cards, flash for 1/30th of a second through the train windows. The art is considered by Sound Transit an extension of Bell's installation at the University Street station that similarly depends on persistence of vision to project subliminal images.|$|E

30|$|When L being a {{continuous}} lattice, an embedding functor from the category CS to SL-CS is introduced, {{then it is}} used to prove that the category CS can <b>be</b> <b>embedded</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> category SL-CS as a reflective subcategory. When L being {{a continuous}} lattice with a multiplicative condition, Pang and Shi’s functor (2016) is generalized from the lattice context, then {{it is used to}} prove that the category CS can <b>be</b> <b>embedded</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> category SL-CS as a coreflective subcategory. It is well known that the category of topological spaces can <b>be</b> <b>embedded</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> category of stratified L-topological spaces as a both reflective and coreflective subcategory. But, we find that the category of convex spaces seem not <b>be</b> <b>embedded</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> category of stratified L-convex spaces as a both reflective and coreflective subcategory. This shows the difference between (stratified L-)topological spaces and (stratified L-) convex spaces from categorical sense.|$|R

25|$|Chlorinated Polyethylene (PE-C) is an {{inexpensive}} material having a chlorine content from 34 to 44%. It {{is used in}} blends with PVC because the soft, rubbery chloropolyethylene <b>is</b> <b>embedded</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> PVC matrix, thereby increasing the impact resistance. In addition, it also increases the weather resistance. Furthermore, it is used for softening PVC foils, without risking the migrate of plasticizers. Chlorinated polyethylene can be crosslinked peroxidically to form an elastomer which is used in cable and rubber industry. When chlorinated polyethylene is added to other polyolefins, it reduces the flammability.|$|E
