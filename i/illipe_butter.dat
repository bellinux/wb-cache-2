5000|$|<b>Illipe</b> <b>butter</b> is a {{vegetable}} fat from the nut (known as the [...] "false illipe nut") of the Shorea stenoptera tree, sometimes {{used as a}} cocoa butter substitute. Borneo tallow nut oil is extracted from this species. The word Illipe {{is derived from the}} Tamil word for the tree Iluppai (இலுப்பை). The true illipe nut is from the species Madhuca latifolia, it is used for producing biodiesel and the Mowrah Butter is from Madhuca longifolia, Family Sapotaceae.|$|E
40|$|Tengkawang is {{referred}} {{to a group of}} approximately 16 species of Shorea producing <b>illipe</b> <b>butter</b> from their kernels. The name Tengkawang mostly referred to the Bornean Illipe Nut, even though they are not restrictly distributed in Borneo. Nine of the 16 species belonging to Shorea Section Pachycarpae, two species of Section Brachypterae, three species of Section Mutica and two species of Section Shorea. Recent phylogenetic studies based on molecular markers considered Section Pachycarpae tend to form a monophyletic group. This present study was aimed to investigate the nature of groupings within Tengkawang and their relatedness based on phenotypic traits. Thirteen species of Shorea and one species of Hopea as an outgroup were selected to perform a phenetic analysis. An UPGMA dendrogram of Tengkawang was obtained using average taxonomic distance. Cluster analysis indicated that genetic distance (Dist coefficient) varied from 0. 92 to 0. 24. Two main groups were formed, first group contained exclusively Shorea Section Pachycarpae and second group consisted of the remaining species from various Sections The principal Component Analysis (PCA) was also performed and showed the relative position of 13 of Tengkawang in two-dimension. The PCA has also identified 27 morphological traits having important roles in the grouping of Shorea section Pachycarpae. A comparative phylogenetic analysis using several chloroplast genes was also in accordance to the results of phenetic analysis, and that the Bornean endemic Shorea section Pachycarpae was a monophyletic group...|$|E

40|$|The work {{reviews the}} {{literature}} on the compositional data of vegetable fats used or proposed as alternatives to cocoa butte in chocolate and confectionary products. These fats are mostly mixtures of various vegetable fats often modified) and can consist of palm and palm kernel oil, <b>illipe</b> fat, shea <b>butter,</b> sal fat and kokum butter. In addition, a large variety of other vegetable oils can be used. Their composition according to triglycerides, fatty acids, sterols and other unsaponifiable components is discussed. Moreover we review {{the literature on}} analytical methods suitable for the detection and identification and determination of foreign fats in cocoa butter and chocolate. None of the methods reviewed here, allows the unequivocal quantification or just detection of foreign fats in chocolate. It is proposed to combine a number of techniques with a chemometric approach to develop unique patterns allowing the unequivocal detection and quantification foreign fats without having prior knowledge regarding the kind of fat added.

40|$|By definition, “butters” are {{anhydrous}} {{and solid}} fats at room temperature. A {{lot of different}} crude fats and butters are available in Africa and other tropical countries, and their characteristics make often them interesting to valorise. This presentation will focus on a personal experience dealing with production and development of African butters. The production of butters and particularly the shea fat, is done {{by one of the}} two basic methods, roughly described as “traditional or modern”. The rural (traditional) vegetable oil extraction processes, which predominate the extraction technologies in many of the shea kernel producing areas, involve water extraction. This method often employs simple small sized and household equipments; it is based on aqueous extraction techniques to produce oil. The work is very hard but provides jobs, money and “consideration” to the women who are traditionally in charge of this work. Such a traditional method yields not more than 35 % of the kernel oil contents and the product quality is often poor. It is obvious that a major contributing factor to the low yield is the treatment inability to adequately break the kernel cellular structures, a necessity to obtain an efficient oil/fat extraction. The “modern” methods involve the use of mechanical presses and organic solvents; although the methods are quite high-yielding (with extraction rates around 80 %), they are reportedly difficult to perform because of the high latex content in the kernels: in fact the latex agglutinates and clogs the equipment or inhibits an efficient penetration of the extraction solvent. As we all know olein rich vegetable oils are globally abundant but commercial sources of vegetable fats, or “stearin”, are less common. Stearin is used in confectionery for chocolates, cakes, etc. and for margarine industries. The most developed and well-known source of stearin is cocoa butter; the development of this production is historical and is based on the “chocolate business” involving a lot of organisms and industries mainly located in “developed” countries. Beside this, other butters like Shea <b>butter,</b> <b>Illipe,</b> Kokum, Sal and mangoare available sources for substitutes in the production of cocoa butter improvers (CBI), equivalent (CBE) or substitutes (CBS). Other markets for Shea butter exist in the personal care industry; the main reason for this growing interest has been the recognition by the cosmetic industry and consumers of the Sheat butter therapeutic benefits (ultra violet light protection, antiinflammatory, moisturizing, regenerative, anti-eczema and anti-wrinkle properties) due to the presence of a significant fraction of unsaponifiable matters (3 - 15 %) composed of many bioactive chemicals, e. g. triterpene alcohols, phenols, sterols and the poly-isoprenic hydrocarbons like karitenes. In this field of valorisation (cosmetics), the unsaponifiable content is a key factor. In 1992 on the demand of DESLOG company, ITERG worked and patented an interesting method of increasing the unsaponifiable content of Shea butter using cryogenic enrichment by fractionation at about – 30 °C. The final product called CRYOKARITENE (registered trade mark) can be enriched up to more than 50 % of unsaponifiable and shows excellent dermo-cosmetic properties...|$|R
