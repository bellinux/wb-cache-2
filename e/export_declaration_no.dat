40|$|The {{application}} of program transformations and refactorings involves {{the risk of}} capturing variables, which may break the intended semantics of the transformed code. One way to resolve variable capture is by renaming of the involved identifiers. However, in a modular context, the renaming of <b>exported</b> <b>declarations</b> is undesirable (affecting a module’s clients), and the renaming of imported declarations is impos-sible (requiring changes to third-party modules). We present an algorithm name-fix that detects and elimi-nates variable capture modularly. We extend a previous non-modular version of name-fix in order to (i) minimize re-namings of <b>exported</b> <b>declarations,</b> (ii) propagate necessary renamings of <b>exported</b> <b>declarations</b> to clients, and (iii) avoid renamings of imported declarations altogether. Together with support for transitive name bindings and conflicting declara-tions, our extensions to name-fix enable the application to real-world languages that feature separate compilation. To demonstrate the applicability of name-fix, we use it to mod-ularly resolve variable capture for optimizations, refactorings, and desugarings of Lightweight Java...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – This paper uses {{data from}} the U. S. Census Bureau Annual Survey of Manufactures (ASM) {{to examine the effects}} that a growth of low-valued {{transactions}} likely has on the quality of export estimates provided in the U. S. International Trade in Goods and Services (FT- 990) series. These transactions, valued at less than $ 2, 500, do not legally require the filing of <b>export</b> <b>declarations.</b> As a result, they are often not captured in the administrative records data used to construct FT- 990 estimates. By comparing industry-level estimates created from the ASM to related FT- 990 estimates, this paper estimates that the undercounting of low-valued transactions in the FT- 990 export series increases by roughly $ 30 billion over the period of 1994 - 1997. It also finds that regression analysis provides little insight into the undercounting issue as results are primarily driven by industries whose contributions to total manufacturing exports are small.

40|$|A {{growing number}} of {{countries}} are adopting e-government to deliver greater operational efficiency, cost savings and transparency. The current wave of globalization and {{the integration of the}} world economy have intensified international trade volumes. Thus, the prospect of development through trade has driven some countries sub-Saharan Africa to adopt information and communication technologies (ICTs), particularly electronic data interchange (EDI) to facilitate international trade. This paper applies Amartya Sen’s Capability Approach (CA) as a framework to examine the effect of an e-government initiative intended to modernise customs operational procedures and facilitate trade. E-trade facilitation has given individuals and businesses the opportunity to lodge import and <b>exports</b> <b>declarations</b> electronically with a single document, resulting in time and cost savings as declarations can be made electronically from any location and at any time. The paper makes a contribution by offering a useful example of the affordances of the CA for examining e-government initiatives particularly in developing countries focusing on what people can actually do with the opportunities provided by e-government, rather than using income-based measures...|$|R
