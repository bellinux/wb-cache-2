25|$|The NTEU {{has been}} famous for {{aggressive}} {{use of the}} courts to supplement their statutorily-limited powers to bargain and restraints on traditional labor tactics such as strikes and boycotts. In 1972, the union sued President Richard M. Nixon, challenging his decision to bypass Congress and postpone salary increases for all federal workers covered by the General Schedule. This lawsuit, NTEU v. Nixon, resulted in an unprecedented victory that required the government to pay over $533 million in back pay to federal employees. In another lawsuit, Boyce and Dixon v. United States, the removal of two IRS service center employees was reversed, establishing {{for the first time}} the principles that an agency did not have total discretion in penalizing employees and that mitigating circumstances could render an agency-ordered removal an abuse of discretion. Shortly thereafter, in NTEU v. Fasser, the union won the right for federal employees to engage in informational picketing, an action previously deemed banned by federal law. During the Reagan and <b>first</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administrations,</b> NTEU participated aggressively in numerous court battles. It took the issue of the constitutionality of random drug testing of Customs inspectors all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court in NTEU v. Von Raab and it successfully fought initiatives it viewed as anti-worker proposed by the head of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).|$|R

40|$|Political {{communication}} {{comes in}} various forms. The {{first part of}} this paper presents some variants of political communication, and provides a set of definitions of such communication. A centre of gravity is along the borderline and overlap between rhetoric and propaganda. It is argued here that rhetoric unlike propaganda has a potential for deliberation. Propaganda is inherently hostile towards debate and discussion. This reluctance towards debate and discussion has at times been evident as regards the Bush administration’s war on terrorism. The second part of the article deals with propaganda from the <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> aimed at quelling debate. All the principals from the <b>first</b> George W. <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> (2001 - 2005) took part in this strategy.

40|$|James Mann refutes {{the idea}} that George W. Bush’s foreign policy was a rupture from {{previous}} administrations. He does find that it took previous policies much further but these trends had already been in place. He points {{to a number of}} military interventions to bolster his case including Haiti, Somalia, Panama, Iraq and Yugoslavia. He notes that previous administrations in foreign policy have acted unilaterally though not to the degree of the <b>Bush</b> <b>administration,</b> have promoted democracy, have used military force without Congressional approval, and have reserved the right to preemption. However, the <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> used preemption, unlike previous administrations, to intimidate a region. Mann argues that this administration was also different from its predecessors because its military strategy in Iraq was a “complete failure”. He ends by raising the counterfactual of what Gore would have done if he had been elected in 2000. John Mueller weighs three themes to determine the continuity and change between the Clinton and second <b>Bush’s</b> <b>administrations.</b> In “policing” the world order, the <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> departed from the previous strategy of intervention and withdrawal from civil wars and toppling uncooperative despots since 1989. Instead, it chose to “stay the course” in Iraq and Afghanistan. In terrorism and nuclear proliferation, the <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> generally continued the policies carried on by the Clinton administration. He finalizes his remarks with some consideration of what might transpire if Iran produces a nuclear weapon. Ronald Steel suggests that the legacy of the second <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> is different from previous presidencies because {{of the results of the}} latest phase of the Iraq War. In part, the goals were not a significant departure from the <b>first</b> <b>Bush</b> or Clinton <b>administrations</b> but the desire to impose a democracy on Iraq was the beginning of failure. Thus, the winners of the war were anti-imperialists, “mobilizers of terror”, and China. It split NATO, heightened US debt, undermined domestic civil liberties and weakened future military responses to problems elsewhere in the world. However, Steel does not consider these negatives as destroying the Pax Americana rather it will produce a reordering of priorities for the US.

40|$|Is {{standardized}} testing {{on the decline}} outside the United States? How much testing goes on internationally? What types of testing and for what purposes? or some time now, we have witnessed considerable interest in state-level or national systems of student examinations. Public opinion polls have revealed {{a large majority of}} adults and parents in favor of large-scale examination systems for decades (Phelps, 1998). Likewise, business associations have proffered proposals for such systems for over a decade (Phelps, 1998). <b>First</b> the <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> and then the Clinton administration made specific proposals for national examination systems. Background As part of the discussion, both proponents and opponents of national testing in particular and {{standardized testing}} in general have drawn attention to testing regimes in other countries. Some proponents have argued that students in other countries learn more because they have the focus, motivation, and ordered curricula created by large-scale tests. Some opponents have argued that, while other countries may have employed large-scale testing more frequently than we have in the past, the trend is toward testing less. It is that latter claim of a trend toward less large-scale testing in other countries that is examined here. The claim can be found in fiv...|$|R

40|$|White House press {{briefings}} are daily {{meetings between}} the White House press secretary and the press. As {{one of the}} main official channels of communication for the White House, they {{play a crucial role in}} the administration communication strategies (Kumar 2007). Security has always been a key concept in political debate (Buzan 2000), particularly after the events of 9 / 11 and the rising of a new regime of international security (Fairclough 2007). Our analysis of a corpus of press briefings ranging across five presidencies, from Bill Clinton to Barack Obama, will focus on the lexical item security from a modern diachronic corpus-assisted discourse studies perspective (Partington 2010). The analysis of the collocational profile of security across time will enable us to assess the phraseological evolution of the senses of the term and its conceptualisation in US political debate, from “social security” (during Bill Clinton presidencies) to “homeland security” (especially during the <b>first</b> George W. <b>Bush</b> <b>administration),</b> and up to “national security” (in Obama’s presidential term) ...|$|R
40|$|Neoconservative {{political}} ideology has influenced U. S. foreign and defense policy in various ways. During President G.

Since the President is the key foreign and defense policy decision maker in the U. S. A., {{the influence of the}} neoconservatives in this field was very significant. To support the main thesis of the paper, an analysis of the content of neoconservative policy papers was made, and statements representing policy goals of neoconservatives were identified. It was concluded that the foreign and defense policy of the <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> was influenced by neoconservative {{political ideology}}, but the neoconservatives and hard-line realists who actively participated in decision-making processes diverged significantly from the political philosophy and advice of the ‗original‘ neoconservatives. They used elements of neoconservative ideology, considered useful for implication of their policy, particularly towards the Middle East and especially towards Iraq. Therefore, the practical (geo) political reasoning of the decision-makers within the Administration clouded the declared theoretical base of their policy as well as the neoconservative values they claimed to suppor...|$|R
