5|$|As Mulder and Scully investigate, they {{discover}} a Malaysian orderly is illicitly giving the patients an herbal drug made of mushrooms he {{cultures in the}} building's basement. The drug cures their Alzheimer's, but also allows them to see the spirits of people who <b>have</b> <b>died</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nursing home and channel them into existence. In this state, the spirits assault and murder the orderlies that have looked down on them and treated them poorly while they were patients. When a patient overdoses on the drug, the spirits once again attack Charters, trapping her and Mulder in the bathroom, which begins flooding.|$|E

5|$|The Chicago Union Stock Yards Fire {{started on}} December 22, 1910, {{destroying}} $400,000 {{of property and}} killing twenty-one firemen, including the Fire Marshal James J. Horan. Fifty engine companies and seven hook and ladder companies fought the fire until it was declared extinguished by Chief Seyferlich on December 23. In 2004, a memorial to all Chicago firefighters who <b>have</b> <b>died</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> line of duty was erected just behind the Union Stock Yards Gate {{at the intersection of}} Exchange Avenue and Peoria Street.|$|E
5|$|The Memorial {{contains}} an inscribed roll of honour behind a glass panel, containing {{the names of}} approximately 1600 officers killed whilst on duty, {{in the course of}} effecting an arrest or whilst carrying out hazardous duties.

5|$|There {{have been}} {{eighteen}} permanent and five caretaker managers of Arsenal since {{the appointment of}} the club's first professional manager, Thomas Mitchell in 1897. The club's longest-serving manager, {{in terms of both}} length of tenure and number of games overseen, is Arsène Wenger, who was appointed in 1996. Wenger is also Arsenal's only manager from outside the United Kingdom. Two Arsenal managers <b>have</b> <b>died</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> job– Herbert Chapman and Tom Whittaker.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} {{eighteen}} permanent and seven caretaker managers of Arsenal since 1897; Stewart Houston has managed {{the club in}} two separate spells as caretaker. The most successful person to manage Arsenal is incumbent manager Arsène Wenger, who has won three Premier League titles, seven FA Cups and seven Community Shields since his appointment in 1996. Wenger is the club's longest-serving manager; he surpassed George Allison's record of 13 years in October 2009. Two Arsenal managers <b>have</b> <b>died</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> job – Herbert Chapman and Tom Whittaker.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{increasingly}} squalid conditions, {{the population}} inside continued to grow. The situation {{inside the building}} was described as chaotic; reports of rampant drug use, fights, rape, and filthy living conditions were widespread. At the time, as many as 100 were reported to <b>have</b> <b>died</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Superdome, with most deaths resulting from heat exhaustion, but other reported incidents included an accused rapist who was beaten to death by a crowd and an apparent suicide. Despite these reports, though, the final official death toll was significantly less: six people inside (4 of natural causes, one overdose, and an apparent suicide) {{and a few more}} in the general area outside the stadium.|$|E

5|$|Exact French {{casualties}} {{are difficult}} to calculate, but of the 1,300 aboard Droits de l'Homme, 103 are known to <b>have</b> <b>died</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> battle and just over 300 were saved from the wreck, indicating the deaths of approximately 900men on the French ship between the morning of 14January and the morning of 18January. However, a French source suggests that up to another 500 of the crew were rescued from the wreck by the corvette Arrogante and the cutter Aiguille on 17 and 18 January. This would give a toll of only about 400. A menhir at Plozévet, with an inscription carved in 1840 gives a death toll of six hundred.|$|E
5|$|Kepler {{was born}} on December 27, the feast day of St John the Evangelist, 1571, in the Free Imperial City of Weil der Stadt (now part of the Stuttgart Region in the German state of Baden-Württemberg, 30km west of Stuttgart's center). His grandfather, Sebald Kepler, had been Lord Mayor of the city. By the time Johannes was born, he had two {{brothers}} and one sister and the Kepler family fortune was in decline. His father, Heinrich Kepler, earned a precarious living as a mercenary, and he left the family when Johannes was five years old. He was believed to <b>have</b> <b>died</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Eighty Years' War in the Netherlands. His mother Katharina Guldenmann, an innkeeper's daughter, was a healer and herbalist. Born prematurely, Johannes {{claimed to have been}} weak and sickly as a child. Nevertheless, he often impressed travelers at his grandfather's inn with his phenomenal mathematical faculty.|$|E
5|$|Pennington {{assigned}} Sherman {{to serve}} {{as chairman of the}} Committee on Ways and Means, where he spent much of his time on appropriations bills, while cooperating with his colleague Justin Smith Morrill on the passage of {{what became known as the}} Morrill Tariff. The Morrill Tariff raised duties on imports to close the deficit that had resulted from falling revenues. It also had the effect of encouraging domestic industries, which appealed to the former Whigs in the Republican party. Sherman spoke in favor of the bill, and it passed the House by a vote of 105 to 64. The tariff bill would likely <b>have</b> <b>died</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Senate, but the withdrawal of Southern members at the start of the Civil War allowed the rump Senate to pass the bill in the 36th Congress's final session, and President Buchanan signed it into law in February 1861. Likewise, Sherman supported a bill admitting Kansas as a free state that passed in 1861.|$|E

5|$|The Briarcliff Manor Community Bonfire is {{a winter}} holiday event at Law Park, {{hosted by the}} village and the Briarcliff Friends of the Arts, {{involving}} live music (primarily seasonal and holiday songs), refreshments, and craft projects for children. Another annual community event is the Memorial Day parade, a tradition in Briarcliff Manor for more than fifty years. Before the parade begins, the Municipal Building's bell is rung to commemorate firefighters who <b>have</b> <b>died</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> previous year; the parade ends at the village's war memorial in Law Park, where wreaths are laid on the monument. The holiday has been celebrated in the village since the early 1900s, though initially involving large family picnics, with parades reserved for the Fourth of July.|$|E
5|$|The Castle Doctrine {{incorporates}} {{elements of}} puzzle, strategy, stealth, and roguelike games, viewed from a 2D perspective. It focuses on maintaining and protecting a vault of money stored in one's house from intruders. These intruders are actually other {{players of the}} game; likewise, the player can invade others' houses and steal their money—presented in a list rather than found through exploration—in the same way. This list shows a pre-determined three-name pseudonym of each player, the number of dollars contained in their vault, how many others have tried to rob it, and how many <b>have</b> <b>died</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process. All deaths in the game are permanent; upon dying, the player must create a new character.|$|E
5|$|In 1064, Echmarcach {{seems to}} have {{accompanied}} by Donnchad upon a pilgrimage to Rome. By this time the two {{may well have been}} of an advanced age, and both appear to <b>have</b> <b>died</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city soon afterwards. Surviving sources give conflicting dates for Echmarcach's passing, and it is uncertain whether he died in 1064 or 1065. The Annals of Inisfallen, the Annals of Loch Cé, and the Annals of Ulster indicate that he died in 1064. The eleventh-century Chronicon of Marianus Scotus (died 1082) records that Echmarcach died in 1065, in a statement which implies that Echmarcach and Donnchad travelled to Rome together. Donnchad himself {{seems to have}} died in 1064, as a multitude of sources report his pilgrimage to Rome and demise that year. Several of these sources appear to indicate that Donnchad died at Santo Stefano Rotondo, an ancient basilica on the Caelian Hill. This building was an important place of pilgrimage to contemporaries, and apparently housed both Echmarcach and Donnchad before they died. Pilgrimages such as those of Echmarcach and Donnchad were not unheard of amongst high-ranking Gaelic and Norse-Gaelic contemporaries, and several such high-status figures are known to have perished undertaking pilgrimages of their own to Rome. If Echmarcach's father was indeed Ragnall mac Gofraid, and if Echmarcach had been born only a few years before his father's death, Echmarcach would have thus been about sixty-five when he himself was laid to rest.|$|E

5|$|Inside {{the cave}} network {{she finds a}} dying Cameo, who tells her the Beforetime weapons Alexi and Vega are searching for caused the Great White, {{but they do not}} know this. She also reveals it is Elspeth’s destiny, as the Seeker, to destroy them. After {{mourning}} her death, Elspeth overhears that Rushton, imprisoned in the next cavern, is the true heir of Obernewtyn. Suddenly, she is captured by Ariel, who ties her to a table next to the Zebkrahn machine. Elspeth is forced to hold the diaries of Marisa Seraphim, the wife of the founder of Obernewtyn and Alexi's stepmother, and use her abilities to discover what Marisa was thinking when she wrote them to determine the weapons’ location. Still withstanding the torture, Elspeth mentally enters Rushton’s mind and recognises the voice of her earlier rescuer from the Zebkrahn. Rushton gives his mental strength to her to endure the pain inflicted on her by the machine. In her despair at their threats to kill him, her resistance breaks and Marissa’s thoughts reveal the map to be carved into the front doors of Obernewtyn. At this point, the Zebkrahn overheats and bursts into flames. Something in Elspeth’s mind cracks and she uses this new power to kill Vega, who she saw standing over Rushton with a knife. She falls unconscious as Domick and Rushton’s other friends rush in. Alexi is killed, but Ariel flees into the night and is believed to <b>have</b> <b>died</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> blizzard. Now known to be the legal master of Obernewtyn, Rushton plans to build it into a secret refuge for Misfits.|$|E
