40|$|Understanding {{the effect}} of central bank policy actions on asset prices is {{important}} both to central banks in estimating the welfare effects of their actions and to individual investors in making correct decisions. Studies of these effects have been made predominantly on the U. S. market. This paper will investigate the direct effect of an unexpected change in the main Swedish <b>funding</b> <b>rate</b> on Swedish market interest rates. Data on the <b>funding</b> <b>rate,</b> interbank rate and market interest rates are used in regressions quantifying this effect. The unexpected part {{of a change in}} the <b>funding</b> <b>rate</b> is isolated using the one month Swedish interbank rate. The results indicate that an unexpected rate cut or hike causes a decrease or an increase in the market rates respectively.

25|$|When the {{deliverable}} asset {{exists in}} plentiful supply, {{or may be}} freely created, then {{the price of a}} futures contract is determined via arbitrage arguments. This is typical for stock index futures, treasury bond futures, and futures on physical commodities when they are in supply (e.g. agricultural crops after the harvest). However, when the deliverable commodity is not in plentiful supply or when it does not yet exist - for example on crops before the harvest or on Eurodollar Futures or Federal <b>funds</b> <b>rate</b> futures (in which the supposed underlying instrument is to be created upon the delivery date) - the futures price cannot be fixed by arbitrage. In this scenario there is only one force setting the price, which is simple supply and demand for the asset in the future, as expressed by supply and demand for the futures contract.|$|E

Using hand-collected data on Morningstar’s mutual fund ratings we examine the rating migration and closure risk of mutual funds from 2005 to 2012.

To assess the information content of mutual fund ratings for buy-and-hold investment strategies, we determine the rating migration based on {{the first and the}} last mutual <b>fund</b> <b>rating</b> during two-, four-, six-, and eight-year horizons. With respect to dynamic investment strategies, we calculate the number of <b>rating</b> changes per <b>fund</b> during these time horizons on a monthly basis.

Only for lower-rated <b>funds</b> the <b>rating</b> appears to indicate higher risk of fund closure. In addition, mutual funds face a large number of up to 38 monthly rating changes in the eight-year window.
