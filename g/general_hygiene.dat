25|$|China {{experienced}} a serious decrease in spatial health equity following the Chinese economic {{revolution in the}} 1980s {{as a result of}} the degradation of the Cooperative Medical System (CMS). The CMS provided an infrastructure for the delivery of healthcare to rural locations, as well as a framework to provide funding based upon communal contributions and government subsidies. In its absence, there was a significant decrease in the quantity of healthcare professionals (35.9%), as well as functioning clinics (from 71% to 55% of villages over 14 years) in rural areas, resulting in inequitable healthcare for rural populations. The significant poverty experienced by rural workers (some earning less than 1 USD per day) further limits access to healthcare, and results in malnutrition and poor <b>general</b> <b>hygiene,</b> compounding the loss of healthcare resources. The loss of the CMS has had noticeable impacts on life expectancy, with rural regions such as areas of Western China experiencing significantly lower life expectancies.|$|E

The FSMS diagnosis indicated FSMS activities at an average level operating in moderate-risk context level but with good system output.

Six agritourisms outbuilding slaughterhouses – EU-approved – were investigated. <b>General</b> and <b>hygiene</b> requirements of outbuilding slaughterhouses and animal welfare indicators of 68 piglets and 5 finishing pigs were evaluated by mean of a checklist. The following parameters were determined on 45 piglets and 5 finishing pigs carcasses: i) pH 1 and 24 h after slaughter, and ii) carcass surface microbial contamination by non destructive method (sponge) on the following sampling sites: ham; back (adults); belly; jowl (adults). Aerobic colony count (ACC; ISO 4833 : 2003), Enterobacteriaceae (EB; ISO 21528 - 2 : 2004), Salmonella spp. (ISO 6579 : 2002), Listeria monocytogenes (ISO 11290 - 1 : 1996 and 11290 - 2 : 1998) were also tested. All the plants except one have two separate rooms, for clean and dirty zones, stunning and bleeding operations being frequently carried out on open air. The piglet scalding was carried out in hot water bowls, and hair removal by singeing. Animal welfare signs revealed the following aspects: handling: hoisting prior to stunning, vocalizations (41 %); stunning: not individual access to box, repeated shocks (4 %), mean voltage 135. 6 V, mean current for head-only electrical stunning 0. 78 A; indicators of not effective stunning: palpebral reflex (24. 2 %), corneal reflex (12. 8 %), vocalizations (15. 4 %); bleeding: conscious and sensitive animal shackling (53. 8 %). Results of carcass evaluation showed, for piglets and adult pig respectively: i) pH: pH 1 = 6. 21 ± 0. 25 and 6. 18 ± 0. 22; pH 24 = 5. 66 ± 0. 17 and 5. 49 ± 0. 11; ii) ACC: 4. 11 ± 0. 64 and 4. 63 ± 0. 42 (log 10 CFU/cm 2, mean±standard deviation); iii) Enterobacteriaceae prevalence of 81. 6 % (2. 55 ± 0. 80) in piglets and 100 % (3. 22 ± 0. 90) in adults.
