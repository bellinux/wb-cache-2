5|$|The plenum {{put forward}} three points {{to solve the}} {{problems}} alleged by Tho; (1) to get party cadres to focus on technical economic and management responsibilities, (2) cadres were to be organized and get specialized training in economic and administrative fields to reequip them with information on how to run an increasingly complex economy, and (3) engineer a shift in the <b>internal</b> <b>balance</b> of power.In a Nhân Dân (The People) editorial, Lê Đức Thọ stressed the need to go beyond political slogans and remonstration to enhance the level of management skills of party cadres in party-level organizations. Lê Đức Thọ wanted to change the party's role in the economy from that of implementer to one of supervisor. The central leadership faced an obstacle; most party cadres had what the party leadership considered an outdated education from 20 to 30 years ago, while the party lacked young cadres. To solve this problem, the central party leadership began talking about the need to introduce personnel planning, a retirement age, rotation of officials and tenure length for cadres and sensitive posts.|$|E

In keeping with the coalition's <b>internal</b> <b>balance</b> of power she named seven ministers from the Christian Democrat Party (PDC), five from the Party for Democracy (PPD), four from the Socialist Party (PS), one from the Social Democrat Radical Party (PRSD) and three without party affiliation.|$|E

5000|$|Offensive realists {{believe that}} <b>internal</b> <b>balancing</b> {{measures}} such as increasing defense spending, implementing conscription, are only effective {{to a certain extent}} as there are usually significant limits on how many additional resources a threatened state can muster against an aggressor.

40|$|Sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) are {{increasingly}} powerful {{actors in the}} international political system and world economy. The current discourse often focuses on SWFs as political versus market actors. In this exploratory article, however, it is shown that SWFs may be both. They may be employed {{as a means to}} increase a state's relative economic power, even when their individual investments are generally {{made on the basis of}} economic, market-driven, logic. After a brief overview of SWFs, and literature review of the issues that attend them, I examine the traditional neorealist understanding of <b>internal</b> <b>balancing</b> and argue that there is evidence to support the claim that SWFs can be employed as tools of this state strategy. Four methods, and two cases (Singapore and China), of <b>internal</b> <b>balancing</b> through SWFs are then examined. I find that some SWFs are used for <b>internal</b> <b>balancing</b> purposes in the conventional sense, but that the phenomena may be better captured by the newer concept of non-military <b>internal</b> <b>balancing</b> (in which a state's relative economic power is enhanced without damage to the overall relationship they currently maintain with the target state) ...|$|R
50|$|Balancing can {{be carried}} out through {{internal}} or external efforts and means. <b>Internal</b> <b>balancing</b> involves efforts to enhance state's power by increasing one's economic resources and military strength {{in order to be able}} to rely on independent capabilities in response to a potential hegemon and be able to compete more effectively in the international system. In a self-help, anarchic system, mechanisms of <b>internal</b> <b>balancing</b> are believed to be more reliable and precise than external balancing since they rest on independent strategies and actions.|$|R
25|$|The {{individuality}} of a {{being is}} a certain intricate form, not an enduring substance. In order to understand an organism, it must {{be thought of as}} a pattern which maintains itself through homeostasis – life continues by maintaining an <b>internal</b> <b>balance</b> of various factors such as temperature and molecular structure. While the material substances that compose a living being may be constantly replaced by nearly identical ones, an organism continues functioning with the same identity as long as the pattern is kept sufficiently intact. Since patterns can be transmitted, modified, or duplicated, they are therefore a kind of information. Based on this, Wiener suggests it should be theoretically possible to transmit the entirety of a living person as a message (which is practically indistinguishable from the concept of physical teleportation) – although he admits that the obstacles to such a process would be great, because of the enormous amount of information embodied in a person, and the difficulty of reading or writing it.|$|E
500|$|In 1969, {{programmer}} Ken Thompson {{worked for}} Bell Labs on the Multics operating system. During his work, he developed Space Travel on a GE 635 computer. When Bell Labs {{pulled out of}} the Multics project, he adapted the code from Multics to a Fortran program so that it could run on the GECOS operating system already present on the GE 635. Thompson and other Bell Labs employees, such as Ravi Sethi and Dennis Ritchie, played the game on the system. The computer, however, was run on an [...] "interactive batch" [...] model, meaning that several computer terminals were attached to the central computer and each terminal's program jobs had to be submitted in a queue, resulting in long pauses in the game while the GE 635 worked on jobs for other terminals. The company tracked the computer usage internally with a cost system, meaning that each game cost US$50 to US$75 on the <b>internal</b> <b>balance</b> sheet to play. The game also did not run as well on the GECOS system as it had on the Multics. Additionally, the system required the user to type in commands rather than press buttons, resulting in the ship being difficult to control. Wanting to find a better solution, Thompson initially petitioned for Bell to purchase a PDP-10 computer, then US$120,000, for the purposes of writing a new operating system; he was turned down, as Bell Labs was uninterested in spending money on an operating system project after just cancelling the previous one. Thompson, however, learned that a neighboring department had an older, little-used PDP-7 minicomputer which he could re-purpose.|$|E

50|$|Neorealists {{contend that}} there are {{essentially}} three possible systems according {{to changes in the}} distribution of capabilities, defined by the number of great powers within the international system. A unipolar system contains only one great power, a bipolar system contains two great powers, and a multipolar system contains more than two great powers. Neorealists conclude that a bipolar system is more stable (less prone to great power war and systemic change) than a multipolar system because balancing can only occur through <b>internal</b> <b>balancing</b> as there are no extra great powers with which to form alliances. Because there is only <b>internal</b> <b>balancing</b> in a bipolar system, rather than external balancing, there is less opportunity for miscalculations and therefore less chance of great power war. That is a simplification and a theoretical ideal.|$|R
5000|$|States {{are deemed}} similar {{in terms of}} needs but not in {{capabilities}} for achieving them. The positional placement of states in terms of abilities determines the distribution of capabilities. The structural distribution of capabilities then limits cooperation among states through fears of relative gains made by other states, {{and the possibility of}} dependence on other states. The desire and relative abilities of each state to maximize relative power constrain each other, resulting in a 'balance of power', which shapes international relations. It also gives rise to the 'security dilemma' that all nations face. There are two ways in which states <b>balance</b> power: <b>internal</b> <b>balancing</b> and external <b>balancing.</b> <b>Internal</b> <b>balancing</b> occurs as states grow their own capabilities by increasing economic growth and/or increasing military spending. External balancing occurs as states enter into alliances to check the power of more powerful states or alliances.citation needed ...|$|R
