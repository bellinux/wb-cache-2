500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{reactions from}} critics. Writing for Entertainment Weekly, critics Mary Kaye Schilling and Mike Flaherty stated [...] "Even Seinfeld's bit players {{must have some}} grounding in reality — you need to love to <b>hate</b> <b>them.</b> Ultimately, there's no redeeming comic payoff to Rava's and Ray's weirdness". Flaherty and Schilling graded the episode with a C-. Colin Jacobson of the DVD Movie Guide called the episode's storyline [...] "fairly pedestrian", but felt the performances of Conway and Koppel saved the episode.|$|E

One British volunteer soldier sent home a letter explicitly detailing the British soldiers' hatred of their Boer enemy: [...] "The Cape Dutch and Boers are a dirty treacherous lot and as soon as the Transvaal is subdued and the beggars (those that survive) trek farther out of our way the better. We do <b>hate</b> <b>them</b> down here like poison. The rascally dirty varmints, they must be exterminated; the country swarms with them and their dirty compatriots the German Jew." ...|$|E
500|$|Matsui {{had told}} friends {{before going to}} Sugamo Prison that at the IMTFE he planned to defend not only himself but also Japan's wartime conduct as a whole. Matsui insisted that Japan had acted defensively against {{aggression}} by foreign powers and that Japan's war aims were to liberate Asia from Western imperialism. Concerning {{the origins of the}} Second Sino-Japanese War, Matsui called it [...] "a fight between brothers within the 'Asian family'" [...] and stated that the war was fought against the Chinese, not [...] "because we <b>hate</b> <b>them,</b> but on the contrary because we love them too much. It is just the same in a family when an elder brother has taken all that he can stand from his ill-behaved younger brother and has to chastise him in order to make him behave properly." ...|$|E

[...] The quote caused a storm of controversy, with Noel having to write a letter of apology; he later confessed that [...] "my whole world came crashing down in on me then". However, in an interview with The Guardian in 2005, Blur's guitarist Graham Coxon explained that he bore no malice towards Oasis. [...] "At least they were outright about it.

500|$|Alucard's {{following}} {{appearance in}} the series is in the 1997 [...] for the PlayStation and Sega Saturn, where he is featured as the game's protagonist and primary playable character. He {{is described as a}} man of great strength and inhuman beauty. Due to the brainwashing of the current member of the Belmont clan, Richter Belmont, Alucard heads to his father's castle to find Richter and ensure that Dracula does not return into the world. He encounters Richter, who has been controlled by the dark priest Shaft into believing he is the lord of Dracula's castle, and Alucard manages to free him from the spell controlling him. In response, Shaft creates an inverted version of Dracula's castle for Alucard to travel through, and Alucard defeats Shaft, and ultimately, Dracula as well. Symphony of the Night also expands on Alucard's background, revealing how his human mother, Lisa, was hunted down and executed by humans who believed her to be a witch. Despite this, Lisa admonished Alucard to respect humans and not <b>hate</b> <b>them</b> as his father did. Alucard's placement as a protagonist was unusual for the series up to that point, as previous Castlevania games had featured often members of the Belmont clan as the protagonists. Symphony of the Night would later be re-released as part of the Xbox Live Arcade for the Xbox 360, on the PlayStation Network for the PlayStation 3, and part of , a compilation that contained Symphony of the Night alongside [...] Aside from the changing of the script and Alucard's English voice actor to Yuri Lowenthal, his role in the Symphony of the Night portion of The Dracula X Chronicles remains the same.|$|E

5000|$|Black novelist James Baldwin (1924-1987) {{grew up in}} Harlem in {{the years}} between the world wars. He wrote, In Harlem.... our ... landlords were Jews, and we <b>hated</b> <b>them.</b> We <b>hated</b> <b>them</b> because they were terrible landlords and did not {{take care of the}} buildings.

[...] When {{asked for a}} clarification and if he really hated Utah, he continued, [...] "I think the whole university and their fans and the organization is [...] classless. They threw beer on my family and stuff last year and did {{a whole bunch of}} nasty things. I don't respect them and they deserved to lose." [...] During the game, Hall had 12 completions out of 32 pass attempts for 134 yards. He had two touchdown passes and no interceptions.|$|E
2500|$|The Simpsons writer Al Jean {{commented that}} Grampa {{is often the}} focus of pointed jokes about old people. He said {{the reason for that}} is because the staff is trying to {{illustrate}} how society mistreats the elderly, [...] "and some of it is because people over 55 never watch our show". Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein, former writers on the show, said that they liked to write episodes about Grampa because they are [...] "obsessed" [...] with old people. Weinstein commented that they [...] "both love [...] and seem to really <b>hate</b> <b>them</b> at the same time". He also said that he [...] "enjoys" [...] writing for characters such as Grampa and Mr. Burns because of their [...] "out-datedness", and because he gets to use dictionaries for looking up [...] "old time slang".|$|E
