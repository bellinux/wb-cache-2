She was surprised that Bill was not involved in killing Nikki, saying that he [...] "came across as a bit of a jerk for most of the episode", adding that Nikki had a [...] "short, sad life". Orlando praised the detail of Nikki's neck, noticing the bruising to show she was strangled. She said, [...] "I generally hate gore yet I found myself fascinated by the autopsy of the girl's neck.

5000|$|According to Brothwell, {{it is one}} of {{the most}} complex {{examples}} of [...] "overkill" [...] in a bog body, and possibly has ritual meaning as it was [...] "extravagant" [...] for a straightforward murder or perfunctory execution. Archaeologists John Hodgson and Mark Brennand suggest that bog bodies may have been related to religious practice, although there is division in the academic community over this issue and in the case of Lindow Man, whether the killing was murder or ritualistic <b>is</b> <b>still</b> debated. Anne Ross, an expert on Iron Age religion, proposed that the death was an example of human sacrifice and that the [...] "triple death" [...] (throat cut, strangled, and hit on the head) was an offering to several different gods. The wide date range for Lindow Man's death (2 BC to 119 AD) means he may have met his demise after the Romans conquered northern England in the 60s AD. As the Romans outlawed human sacrifice, this opens up other possibilities; this was emphasised by historian Ronald Hutton, who challenged the interpretation of sacrificial death. Connolly suggests that as Lindow Man was found naked, he could have been the victim of a violent robbery. Joy said, [...] "The <b>jury</b> really <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>out</b> on these bodies, whether they were aristocrats, priests, criminals, outsiders, whether they went willingly to their deaths or whether they were executed - but Lindow was a very remote place in those days, an unlikely place for an ambush or a murder".|$|R

40|$|The Conspiracy of Kings, {{published}} in February 1792, {{is very much}} a work of its time, the first months of the constitional monarchy in France. Louis XVI and the new Legislative Assembly began their uneasy relationship in October 1792. Outside France, exiled members of the nobility campaigned to persuade the sovereigns of Europe to intervene and restore them to their privileges. On the other side, friends of the French Revolution sought to discourage intervention and to discredit the principles of legitimacy and social hierarchy that supported the old order. Joel Barlow had arrived in France in 1788 to act as the representative of a scheme to at-tract French settlers to the western territories, in what is now Ohio. After some initial success, difficulties at the American end caused the scheme to fail, and Barlow left France for England in 1791. Having observed events in France at close hand, he had become an ardent supporter of the Revolution, and set himself to advance the cause by writing. He began his prose work, Advice to the Privileged Orders in the Several States of Europe, Resulting from the Necessity and Propriety of a General Revolution in the Principle of Government, the first four parts of which were published early in 1792; the title might serve as a summary of The Conspiracy of Kings. For English readers, the debate over the revolution was essentially a debate over the views advanced eloquently in Edmund Burke 2 ̆ 7 s Reflections on the Revolution in France, pub-lished in November 1790. Many of the books that attacked the Reflections were published by Joseph Johnson, a well-established London bookseller and publisher with a long history of taking the dissenting side in politics and religion. (He had published the English edition of Barlow 2 ̆ 7 s The Vision of Columbus in 1787.) For Barlow, Burke was a particularly troubling opponent because of his earlier support of the American Revolution. The attack on Burke that makes the centerpiece of the poem is a conflicted one that shows Barlow 2 ̆ 7 s regret as well as his scorn for what Burke has become, and stands {{in sharp contrast to the}} ironic footnote dismissals of the Vicomte de Calonne and the Comte D 2 ̆ 7 Artois, the leading figures among the exiled nobility. Barlow has gibes for the Frederick William II of Prussia, Catherine the Great of Russia, and Leopold II of the Holy Roman Empire, but two sovereigns are conspicuous by their absence: George III of Britain and Louis XVI of France. An attack on the first would have exposed Barlow to prosecution in England. As for the second, the <b>jury</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>out</b> on the constitutional monarchy as Barlow wrote; his objective was to direct attention from what is happening now in France to the significance of what has happened in France for the rest of Europe. There he sees much to denounce, but the poem ends on a note of hope: the enlightened king Stanslaus Poniatowski has promulgated the Constitution of May 3, 1791 to move Poland toward a more egalitarian society, and on the other side of the Atlantic the United States provides the example which may yet move the nations of Europe to reason their way to governments of that rare union, Liberty and Laws. ETERNAL Truth, thy trump undaunted lend, People and priests and courts and kings, attend; While, borne on weﬅern gales from that far shore Where Justice reigns, and tyrants tread no more, Th 2 ̆ 7 unwonted voice, that no dissuasion awes, That fears no frown, and seeks no blind applause, Shall tell the bliss that Freedom sheds abroad, The rights of nature and the gift of God.

In this study, we quantify the combined impact of growth and conservatism on financial statement information using a comprehen-sive measure of conservatism that considers the impact of accounting-policy decisions on the carrying value of both tangible and intangible investments. We observe that accounting information—despite its imperfections—reliably identifies firms with superior economic performance. Distortions generated by differences in growth or accounting policies are not large enough to break the link between accounting and economic profitability. This finding is especially relevant in light of the increasing integration of global accounting standards.

40|$|As {{the notion}} of “sustainability ” takes root in communities, the term is broadly used to {{encompass}} many aspects of local and regional planning. Unlike traditional comprehensive planning, where both state laws and decades of precedence offer clear guidelines for formulating and implementing a plan, {{there is no such}} guidance for sustainability planning. Consequently, there are no standards for what elements comprise a sustainability plan, and nor is there clear documentation of what makes a plan successful. This paper discusses an analysis of over 50 sustainability plans from around the world, which provides new insight into what makes a plan effective. Although research concluded that plans lack any form of consistency—including topics covered, measurements, indicators, and implementation – categories throughout the plans as well as characteristics of their respective cities began to paint a picture about what works and what doesn’t. Some of these themes that affect the depth and thoroughness of sustainability plans include the longevity of a community’s commitment to sustainability, knowledgebase on key sustainability issues and location-specific factors, and the overall structure of plans. So, is there a formula to produce an effective plan? Is a sustainability plan necessary or can independent efforts with little framework produce the same results? The <b>jury</b> may <b>still</b> <b>be</b> <b>out.</b> But this research has the potential to greatly benefit communities, providing framework to begin or advance sustainability efforts, locally, nationally and globally...|$|R
40|$|In his Letter, Kristoffer Hellstrand [1] {{raises the}} {{important}} {{issue of the}} role of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs) in the suppression of intratumor immunity. They make the point that CD 3 z, an oxygen radical-sensitive molecule, could provide a link between ROI and defective function of intratumor T and natural killer (NK) cells. We agree with Hellstrand on the potential importance of ROIs in the suppression of NK function and specific immunity and indeed we have contributed the first ana-lysis of ROI in tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) [2]. However, in this early study, as well as in subsequent ones [3 – 5], TAMs {{have been shown to be}} poor producers of ROI compared to normal macrophages. Even in the study by Kono et al. [6], direct measurement of ROI was missing. The finding of poor ROI production by TAMs is consistent with the high levels of TAM-derived or tumor-derived interleukin- 10 (IL- 10) [7]. Therefore, the available infor-mation on low ROI production by TAMs is consistent with the hypothesis that TAMs represent a skewed M 2 popu-lation, with the caveat intrinsic to this definition [8, 9]. It <b>is</b> <b>still</b> possible that low local production of ROIs contributes to suppression of T-cell function. Given the pleiotropic actions of histamine (e. g. stimu-lation of adhesion molecules and chemokines in endo-thelial cells, relevant to leukocyte traffic), we find it hard to accept its activity combined with IL- 2 as proof for the key role of ROIs in the suppression of specific immunity in tumor bearing individuals. We thank Hellstrand for raising the issue of ROIs, overlooked into our Review, for the reasons discussed above. Based on available information, we conclude that the <b>jury</b> on radicals <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>out...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background Health {{technology}} assessment (HTA) is frequently used {{when a new}} and expensive technology is being introduced into clinical practice. This certainly {{is the case with}} the da Vinci surgical robot, with costs ranging from 1 to 2. 5 million for each unit. This systematic review documents major variability in the reported cost evaluation studies of da Vinci robot-assisted operations compared with those performed by the direct manual laparoscopic approach. Methods Published studies in the English language related to the period 2000 – 2010 were searched using economic and clinical electronic databases. Results All 11 reports included some form of cost analysis, which made it possible for the authors to extract information on certain specific economic outcomes: operating room time, hospital stay, and total costs. With the exception of two studies, the reported operating room time was higher with the robotic approach than with manual laparoscopic surgery, and the hospital stay was the same for the two techniques. Robotic surgery is significantly more expensive if the purchase and maintenance costs of the robot system are included in the total costs. Only 3 of the 11 publications included these costs. Conclusions The disadvantage of robotic surgery is its higher costs related to purchase and maintenance of technology and its longer operating room time. However, emerging evidence shows that operating room time decreases with experience using the robot. From the HTA viewpoint, the result of this review <b>is</b> that the <b>jury</b> <b>still</b> <b>is</b> <b>out</b> on the HTA of da Vinci-assisted robotic surgery...|$|R

40|$|The {{first line}} of {{evidence}} {{is the presence of}} GDGTs, including crenarchaeol, in suspended particulate matter (SPM) at 83 m, the archaeal community of which is nearly exclusively composed of MG-II (> 94 % of archaeal reads) (table 1 in ref. 1) as determined by pyrosequencing. However, according to Lincoln et al. ’s definition, all SPM samples < 100 m do not contain sufficient archaeal reads (i. e., < 1, 000) (figure S 6 and table S 2 in ref. 1) to draw any conclusion. This low abundance of archaeal DNA is also evident from the absence of detectable MG-I 16 S rRNA gene copies (figure 2 in ref. 1). It is, however, not surprising that GDGTs were detected in the 83 -m SPM sample because the lipid tracers used are core lipids. Core lipids do not occur as such in living cells, where they contain polar sugar and phospho head groups (e. g., ref. 2). Thus, by definition core lipid GDGTs are derived from dead material. The second line of evidence is based upon relating the presence of monohexose GDGTs in two SPM samples (although not the crucial 83 -m sample) with archaeal diversity data. Although this approach uses intact polar lipids, {{it has been shown that}} monohexose GDGTs are also poor tracers of living archaeal cells (3) because they have a turnover time in the order of thousands of years (4), de facto also representing dead material. This dominance of dead lipid material readily explains the absence of any correlation of total MG-I+MG-II DNA abundance with total GDGT abundance (r 2 = 0. 06 and 0. 04 for 0. 3 - to 3 -µm and 3 - to 57 -µm fractions, respectively). Furthermore, it explains the much higher abundance of GDGTs in the large particle fraction compared to the small fraction (16 – 490 vs. 1 – 20 pg/L), contrasting its lower total archaeal abundance (0. 3 – 1. 8 × 105 vs. 1 – 7 × 105 cells/L) (figure 2 in ref. 1). We conclude that both lines of evidence are based on a comparison of minute amounts of archaeal DNA (often below detection limit) with unsuitable lipid tracers. The dominance of dead material and low abundance of archaeal cells make it impossible to infer the lipid composition of uncultivated MG-II from these samples, let alone to extrapolate this to the global ocean. In contrast, other studies, using abundant archaeal DNA and more suitable phospholipid GDGTs, do show a good match between MG-I DNA abundance and crenarchaeol concentration and not with MG-II (3, 5). Nevertheless, members of the Marine Group III Euryarchaeota have been suggested to contribute to GDGTs 0 – 3 (3); thus, members of the MG-II may potentially contribute to this pool of GDGTs as well.
