50|$|In {{molecular}} biology, the <b>hexon</b> <b>protein</b> {{is a major}} {{coat protein}} found in Adenoviruses. Hexon coat proteins are synthesised during late infection and form homo-trimers. The 240 copies of the hexon trimer that are produced are organised so that 12 lie {{on each of the}} 20 facets. The central 9 hexons in a facet are cemented together by 12 copies of polypeptide IX. The penton complex, formed by the peripentonal hexons and base hexon (holding in place a fibre), lie at each of the 12 vertices. The hexon coat protein is a duplication consisting of two domains with a similar fold packed together like the nucleoplasmin subunits. Within a hexon trimer, the domains are arranged around a pseudo 6-fold axis. The domains have a beta-sandwich structure consisting of 8 strands in two sheets with a jelly-roll topology; each domain is heavily decorated with many insertions. Some hexon proteins contain a distinct C-terminal domain.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Fowl {{adenovirus}} (FAdv) serotype 2 causes {{inclusion body}} hepatitis (IBH) disease which adversely affects the broiler industry in Thailand. We developed an indirect ELISA based on the recombinant <b>hexon</b> <b>protein</b> produced by E. coli. The recombinant <b>hexon</b> <b>protein</b> was tested with sera, in both infected and noninfected chickens. The recombinant <b>hexon</b> <b>protein</b> was standardized with an antigen concentra-tion of 3. 75 µg/ml and test sera. The intra- and inter-assays were repeatable. The cutoff value from TG-ROC curve analysis was 0. 106. The specificity and sensitivity were 80 and 80 %, respectively. The correlation coefficient (r) of absorbance values from this ELISA compared with the serum neutralization test was 0. 76. This ELISA might be helpful for IBH diagnosis and surveillance.

The existence {{of at least}} 54 different serotypes of HAdVs has resulted in difficulties in clinical diagnosis. Acute respiratory tract disease (ARD) caused by some serotypes from B and C species is particularly serious. Hexon, the main coat protein of HAdV, contains the major serotype-specific B cell epitopes; however, few studies have addressed epitope mapping in most HAdV serotypes. In this study, we utilized a novel and rapid method for the modeling of homologous proteins based on the phylogenetic tree of protein families and built three-dimensional (3 D) models of <b>hexon</b> <b>proteins</b> in B and C species HAdVs.

40|$|An {{outbreak}} of adenovirus has been surveyed in Taiwan in 2011. To {{better understand the}} evolution and epidemiology of adenovirus in Taiwan, full-length sequence of hexon and fiber coapsid protein was analyzed using series of phylogenetic and dynamic evolution tools. Six different serotypes were identified in this outbreak and the species B was predom-inant (HAdV- 3, 71. 50 %; HAdV- 7, 15. 46 %). The most frequent diagnosis was acute tonsillitis (54. 59 %) and bronchitis (47. 83 %). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that <b>hexon</b> <b>protein</b> gene sequences were highly conserved for HAdV- 3 and HAdV- 7 circulation in Taiwan. However, comparison of {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} (RFLP) analysis and phylogenetic trees of fiber gene in HAdV- 7 clearly indicated that the predominant genotype in Taiwan has shifted from 7 b to 7 d. Several positive selection sites were observed in <b>hexon</b> <b>protein.</b> The estimated nucleotide substitution rates of <b>hexon</b> <b>protein</b> of HAdV- 3 and HAdV- 7 were 0. 234 × 10 - 3 substitutions/site/year (95 % HPD: 0. 387 ~ 0. 095 × 10 - 3) and 1. 107 × 10 - 3 (95 % HPD: 0. 541 ~ 1. 604) respectively; those of the fiber protein of HAdV- 3 and HAdV- 7 were 1. 085 × 10 - 3 (95 % HPD: 1. 767 ~ 0. 486) and 0. 132 × 10 - 3 (95 % HPD: 0. 283 ~ 0. 014) respective...|$|E

Av 3 nBg demonstrated gene transfer and expression {{comparable to that of}} Av 1 nBg, a first-generation adenovirus vector with deletions in E 1 and E 3. Several lines of evidence suggest that this vector is significantly more attenuated than E 1 and E 3 deletion vectors. Metabolic DNA labeling studies showed no detectable de novo vector DNA synthesis or accumulation, and metabolic protein labeling demonstrated no detectable de novo <b>hexon</b> <b>protein</b> synthesis for Av 3 nBg in naive A 549 cells even at a multiplicity of infection of up to 3, 000 PFU per cell.

40|$|Adenoviruses (Ad) show {{promise as}} a vector system for gene {{delivery}} in vivo. However, {{a major challenge}} {{in the development of}} Ad vectors is the circumvention of the host immune responses to Ad infection, including both the host cytotoxic T-cell response and the humoral response resulting in neutralizing antibodies. One method to circumvent the effect of neutralizing antibodies against an Ad vector is to use different Ad serotypes to deliver the transgene of interest. This approach has been demonstrated with Ad genomes of highly related members of subgroup C. However, it is not known whether an Ad 5 -based vector DNA molecule can be packaged into capsids of evolutionarily more divergent adenoviruses. The aim of these studies was to determine if capsids containing hexon proteins from other Ad subgroups could package the Ad 5 genome. A genetic approach utilizing an Ad 5 temperature-sensitive (ts) mutant with a mutation in the <b>hexon</b> <b>protein</b> was used. When grown at the nonpermissive temperature, Ad 5 ts 147 replicates normally, providing a source of Ad 5 DNA for virus assembly, but does not produce virus particles due to the <b>hexon</b> <b>protein</b> mutation. Coinfection of Ad 5 ts 147 with a wild-type virus of other Ad serotypes (Ad 3, Ad 4, or Ad 9), which supply functional hexon proteins, resulted in the pseudopackaging of the Ad 5 DNA genome. Furthermore, the pseudopackaged Ad 5 DNA virions obtained in the coinfections were infectious. Therefore, switching hexons did not impair the infectivity or uncoating process of the pseudopackaged virion. Since <b>hexon</b> <b>protein</b> is a major antigenic determinant of the Ad capsid, this approach may prove useful to reduce the antigenicity of therapeutic Ad vectors and allow repeated vector administration...|$|E

40|$|Adenovirus type 5 (Ad 5) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{promising}} vectors for gene therapy applications. Genetic engineering of Ad 5 capsid proteins has been employed to redirect vector tropism, to enhance infectivity, or to circumvent preexisting host immunity. As the most abundant capsid <b>protein,</b> <b>hexon</b> modification is particularly attractive. However, genetic modification of hexon often results in failure of rescuing viable viruses. Since hypervariable regions (HVRs) are nonconserved among hexons of different serotypes, we investigated whether the HVRs could be used for genetic modification of hexon by incorporating oligonucleotides encoding six histidine residues (His 6) into different HVRs in the Ad 5 genome. The modified viruses were successfully rescued, and the yields of viral production were similar to that of unmodified Ad 5. A thermostability assay suggested the modified viruses were stable. The His 6 epitopes were expressed in all modified <b>hexon</b> <b>proteins</b> as assessed by Western blotting assay, although the intensity of the reactive bands varied. In addition, we examined the binding activity of anti-His tag antibody to the intact virions with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and found the His 6 epitopes incorporated in HVR 2 and HVR 5 could bind to anti-His tag antibody. This suggested the His 6 epitopes in HVR 2 and HVR 5 were exposed on virion surfaces. Finally, we examined the infectivities of the modified Ad vectors. The His 6 epitopes did not affect the native infectivity of Ad 5 vectors. In addition, the His 6 epitopes did not appear to mediate His 6 -dependent viral infection, as assessed in two His 6 artificial receptor systems.

40|$|The {{utility of}} the present {{generation}} of adenovirus (Ad) vectors for gene therapy applications could be improved by restricting native viral tropism to selected cell types. In order to achieve modification of Ad tropism, we proposed to exploit a minor component of viral capsid, protein IX (pIX), for genetic incorporation of targeting ligands. Based on the proposed structure of pIX, we hypothesized that its C terminus {{could be used as}} a site for incorporation of heterologous peptide sequences. We engineered recombinant Ad vectors containing modified pIX carrying a carboxy-terminal Flag epitope along with a heparan sulfate binding motif consisting of either eight consecutive lysines or a polylysine sequence. Using an anti-Flag antibody, we have shown that modified pIXs are incorporated into virions and display Flag-containing C-terminal sequences on the capsid surface. In addition, both lysine octapeptide and polylysine ligands were accessible for binding to heparin-coated beads. In contrast to virus bearing lysine octapeptide, Ad vector displaying a polylysine was capable of recognizing cellular heparan sulfate receptors. We have demonstrated that incorporation of a polylysine motif into the pIX ectodomain results in a significant augmentation of Ad fiber knob-independent infection of CAR-deficient cell types. Our data suggest that the pIX ectodomain can serve as an alternative to the fiber knob, penton base, and <b>hexon</b> <b>proteins</b> for incorporation of targeting ligands for the purpose of Ad tropism modification...|$|R
40|$|The innate immune {{response}} to adenovirus (Ad) -derived gene transfer vectors {{has been shown}} to initiate immediately after interaction of Ad with respiratory epithelial cells, through the induction of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK 1 / 2) and JNK mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), nuclear factor B (NF-B), and different proinflammatory genes. Ad serotypes 2 or 5 (Ad 2 / 5) enter respiratory epithelia after initial binding of fiber with the coxsackievirus-adenovirus receptor (CAR) or, alternatively, with cell surface heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans. Ad 2 / 5 internalization is triggered by binding of penton base to cellular RGD-binding integrins. Here we investigated the role of the Ad 5 surface domain proteins constituting the vector capsid, namely, the fiber, the penton base, and the hexon, on the transmembrane signals leading to the transcription of the different proinflammatory genes in the human respiratory A 549 cell line. Interaction of Ad fiber with CAR activates both ERK 1 / 2 and JNK MAPK and the nuclear translocation of NF-B, whereas no activation was observed after exposing A 549 cells to penton base and <b>hexon</b> <b>proteins.</b> Moreover, interaction of Ad fiber with CAR, but not heparan sulfate proteoglycans, promotes transcription of the chemokines inter-leukin- 8, GRO-, GRO-, RANTES, and interferon-inducible protein 10.

Comprehensive comparison of this sequence with <b>hexon</b> <b>protein</b> sequences from human subgenera A, B, C, D, F, bovine AV 3, and mouse AV 1 revealed seven discrete hypervariable regions (HVRs) among the 250 variable residues in loops 1 and 2. These regions differed in length between serotypes, from 2 to 38 residues, and contained > 00 % of hexon serotype-specific residues among human serotypes. Alignment with the published crystal structure of AV 2 established {{the location and}} structure of the type-specific regions. Five HVRs were shown to be part of linear loops on the exposed surfaces of the protein, analogous to the serotype-specific loops or "puffs" in picornavirus capsid proteins. The HVRs were supported by a common framework of conserved residues, of which 68 to 75 % were hydrophobic.

Nucleotide sequence of conserved and seven hypervariable regions (HVRs) of the <b>hexon</b> <b>protein,</b> the pVI core protein signal peptide, and noncoding region between the two genes was determined. Among AV 48 isolates the base misincorporation rate was 3. 2 per 10, 000 bases over 6 years. A 6 -bp deletion occurred in one isolate between short direct repeats in HVR 7. Among subgenus D serotypes mutation rates were extremely low in the pVI peptide, the 5 ′ hexon noncoding region, and first 187 bases of <b>hexon</b> <b>protein.</b> Small 2 - and 3 -bp deletions between short direct repeats in a polypurine stretch in the noncoding region occurred in 3 strains. Mutation increased with proximity to the HVRs. Within HVR 1, 2, 4, 5, and 7 variability consisted of extensive intrachromosomal illegitimate recombination, including deletions between short direct repeats, insertions and duplications in repetitive polypurine stretches, and numerous base substitutions. All serotypes and intermediates differed {{by at least one}} illegitimate recombination event, with one exception. We conclude that AV serotype evolution is driven by illegitimate recombination events (antigenic shift), concommitant with single base mutation (antigenic drift), and that the HVRs are “hot spots” for both. These events could be explained by slippage-misalignment of the AV DNA polymerase in repetitive polypurine stretches during single-strand DNA replication.

40|$|Adenoviral (Ad) vectors {{have been}} used for a variety of vaccine {{applications}} including cancer and infectious diseases. Traditionally, Ad-based vaccines are designed to express antigens through transgene expression of a given antigen. However, in some cases these conventional Ad-based vaccines have had sub-optimal clinical results. These sub-optimal results are attributed in part to pre-existing Ad serotype 5 (Ad 5) immunity. In order to circumvent the need for antigen expression via transgene incorporation, the "antigen capsid-incorporation" strategy has been developed and used for Ad-based vaccine development {{in the context of a}} few diseases. This strategy embodies the incorporation of antigenic peptides within the capsid structure of viral vectors. The major capsid <b>protein</b> <b>hexon</b> has been utilized for these capsid incorporation strategies due to hexon's natural role in the generation of anti-Ad immune response and its numerical representation within the Ad virion. Using this strategy, we have developed the means to incorporate heterologous peptide epitopes specifically within the major surface-exposed domains of the Ad capsid <b>protein</b> <b>hexon.</b> Our study herein focuses on generation of multivalent vaccine vectors presenting HIV antigens within the Ad capsid <b>protein</b> <b>hexon,</b> as well as expressing an HIV antigen as a transgene. These novel vectors utilize HVR 2 as an incorporation site for a twenty-four amino acid region of the HIV membrane proximal ectodomain region (MPER), derived from HIV glycoprotein gp 41 (gp 41). Our study herein illustrates that our multivalent anti-HIV vectors elicit a cellular anti-HIV response. Furthermore, vaccinations with these vectors, which present HIV antigens at HVR 2, elicit a HIV epitope-specific humoral immune response...|$|R
40|$|The {{members of}} the family Adenoviridae are widely spread among {{vertebrate}} host species and normally cause acute but innocuous infections. Special attention is focused on adenoviruses because of their ability to transform host cells, their possible application in vector technology, and their phylogeny. The primary structure of the genome of Tupaia adenovirus (TAV), which infects Tupaia spp. (tree shrew) was determined. Tree shrews are taxonomically assumed to be {{at the base of the}} phylogenetic tree of mammals and are frequently used as laboratory animals in neurological and behavior research. The TAV genome is 33, 501 bp in length with a G+C content of 49. 96 % and has 166 -bp inverted terminal repeats. Analysis of the complete nucleotide sequence resulted in the identification of 109 open reading frames (ORFs) with a coding capacity of at least 40 amino acid residues. Thirty-eight of them are predicted to encode viral proteins based on the presence of transcription and translation signals and sequence and positional conservation. Thirty viral ORFs were found to show significant similarities to known adenoviral genes, arranged into discrete early and late genome regions as they are known from mastadenoviruses. Analysis of the nucleotide content of the TAV genome revealed a significant CG dinucleotide depletion at the genome ends that suggests methylation of these genomic regions during the viral life cycle. Phylogenetic analysis of the viral gene products, including penton and <b>hexon</b> <b>proteins,</b> viral protease, terminal protein, protein VIII, DNA polymerase, protein IVa 2, and 100, 000 -molecular-weight protein, revealed that the evolutionary lineage of TAV forms a separate branch within the phylogenetic tree of the Mastadenovirus genus...|$|R
40|$|To {{detect and}} {{identify}} adenovirus (Ad), {{we used a}} combination of PCR and {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} (RFLP) analysis. Nested PCR with two primer sets that hybridize to the conserved region for <b>hexon</b> <b>proteins</b> of 14 prototypes of Ad, Ad serotype 1 (Ad 1) to Ad 8, - 11, - 14, - 19, - 37, - 40, and - 41, amplified a 956 -bp DNA fragment. The amplified fragments from the 14 prototypes were completely differentiated with a combination of three restriction endonucleases, EcoT 14 I, HaeIII, and HintI. We applied this new method for 127 samples of conjunctival scrapings from patients with conjunctivitis and compared the results with those obtained with the combination of culture isolation and a neutralization test (NT). PCR gave a positive result in 69 of 127 cases (54. 3 %), while only 61 of the 127 samples (48. 0 %) tested positive by culture isolation. Compared with isolation, the PCR method had a sensitivity of 100 % (61 of 61). Positive PCR samples were further classified as Ad 37 (59. 5 %), - 3 (31. 9 %), - 11 (4. 3 %), - 8 (2. 9 %), and - 4 (1. 4 %) by PCR-RFLP analysis. Of eight samples that were PCR positive and culture isolation negative, six were Ad 37 and two were Ad 8 by PCR-RFLP analysis. These differentiations of isolation-positive samples were identical to the results obtained by the NT. It took only 3 days to detect and identify Ad by PCR-RFLP analysis, whereas it took at least 3 weeks by culture isolation and NT. Our newly developed method of detecting and typing human Ad by PCR-RFLP analysis is more sensitive, accurate, and rapid than the conventional method of culture isolation and an NT...|$|R
40|$|AbstractHuman {{adenovirus}} type 12 (HAdV- 12) {{displays a}} relatively low virulence and slow replication in cultured human cells, which is manifested by premature death of HAdV- 12 -infected cells. Whereas HAdV- 2 induction of IFN-β expression was transient, HAdV- 12 -infected cells maintained high levels of IFN-β expression, protein kinase R (PKR) activation and eIF- 2 α phosphorylation throughout the infectious cycle. The importance of the IFN-inducible PKR kinase in restriction of HAdV- 12 {{was supported by the}} enhanced growth of the virus following PKR knockdown in HeLa cells. Ectopic expression of HAdV- 2 VA RNAI increased HAdV- 12 <b>hexon</b> <b>protein</b> expression, suggesting that insufficient VA RNA expression contributes to the restricted growth of HAdV- 12. Although some adenovirus species are known to persist in human lymphoid tissues, HAdV 12 has so far not been found. Thus, {{it is possible that the}} inability of HAdV 12 to evade the INF response may have implications for the virus to establish long-lasting or persistent infections...|$|E
40|$|Fowl {{adenovirus}} (FAdV) is {{a member}} of the genus Aviadenovirus and causes a number of economically important poultry diseases. One of these diseases, inclusion body hepatitis (IBH), has a worldwide distribution and is characterised by acute mortality (5 % – 20 %) in production chickens. The disease was first described in the United States of America in 1963 and has also been reported in Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, France and Ireland, but until now, not in South Africa. Adenoviruses isolated from the first outbreak of IBH in South Africa were able to reproduce the disease in chicken embryo livers. The aim of the present study was to characterise the viruses and determine the pathogenicity of the FAdV strains responsible for the first reported case of IBH in South Africa. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the L 1 loop region of the fowl adenovirus hexon gene using degenerate primer pair hexon A/B was used to identify the viruses that were isolated. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of the amplification products was used for the differentiation of 14 isolates of fowl adenovirus. Sequencing of the PCR products followed by amino acid comparison and phylogenetic analysis using the L 1 loop region of the <b>hexon</b> <b>protein</b> was done to determine the identity of the isolates. Amino acid sequences of the hexon genes of all the South African isolates were compared with those of reference strains representing FAdV species. Amino acid comparison of 12 South Africa field isolates to FAdV reference strains revealed a high sequence identity (> 93. 33 %) with reference strains T 8 -A and 764. Two of the isolates had high sequence identity (93. 40 %) with reference strains P 7 -A, C 2 B and SR 48. Phylogenetic analysis of the L 1 loop region of the <b>hexon</b> <b>protein</b> of all 14 South African isolates was consistent with their RFLP clusters. The mortality rates of embryos challenged with 10 6 egg infective doses (EID 50) FAdV 2 were 80 % – 87 % and mortality rates for embryos challenged with 10 5. 95 (EID 50) FAdV 8 b were 65 % – 80 %. </span...|$|E
40|$|Human {{adenovirus}} type 55 (HAdV 55) is a newly identified re-emergent acute {{respiratory disease}} (ARD) pathogen with a proposed recombination of hexon gene between HAdV 11 and HAdV 14 strains. The {{identification of the}} neutralizing epitopes {{is important for the}} surveillance and vaccine development against HAdV 55 infection. In this study, four type-specific epitope peptides of HAdV 55 <b>hexon</b> <b>protein,</b> A 55 R 1 (residues 138 to 152), A 55 R 2 (residues 179 to 187), A 55 R 4 (residues 247 to 259) and A 55 R 7 (residues 429 to 443), were predicted by multiple sequence alignment and homology modeling methods, and then confirmed with synthetic peptides by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and neutralization tests (NT). Finally, the A 55 R 2 was incorporated into human adenoviruses 3 (HAdV 3) and a chimeric adenovirus rAd 3 A 55 R 2 was successfully obtained. The chimeric rAd 3 A 55 R 2 could induce neutralizing antibodies against both HAdV 3 and HAdV 55. This current study will {{contribute to the development of}} novel adenovirus vaccine candidate and adenovirus structural analysis...|$|E
40|$|A {{detailed}} {{understanding of}} adenovirus (Ad) specific immune responses {{is needed to}} develop immunotherapy options {{for the treatment of}} invasive Ad disease in Hematopoetic Stem Cell Transplant (HSCT) patients. Most healthy adults exhibit memory T cell responses to the Ad <b>Hexon,</b> a capsid <b>protein</b> synthesized late after infection. Several groups are investigating the efficacy of Hexon-specific donor T cells in treatment of invasive Ad disease. However, the fact that the Ad E 3 - 19 k down regulates MHC class I molecules suggests that cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) targeted to early viral proteins may be more effective in limiting Ad replication in vivo. We propose that CTLs targeted to adenoviral early proteins would be more efficient than Hexon specific CTLs, as they would recognize virally infected cells prior to E 3 - 19 k mediated down regulation of MHC class I molecules and before the onset of viral replication. Here we show that several adenoviral early proteins are recognized by human Ad specific CD 8 T cells and bear cross reactive epitopes that are well conserved amongst several Ad serotypes. We identify HLA A 2 restricted epitopes from adenoviral early region 2 (E 2) proteins: DNA polymerase (Pol) and DNA binding protein (DBP). We detect interferon-γ (IFN-γ) responses to HLA A 2 -binding motif peptides from Pol and DBP in PBMC from a recently infected normal donor as well as 3 SCT patients recovering from invasive Ad disease. Interestingly Pol epitope specific T cells are found in higher frequency than Hexon (or DBP) epitope specific T cells from PBMC in three SCT patients. Subsequently we compare human memory CD 8 T cell responses to early protein Pol (P- 977) and late capsid <b>protein</b> <b>Hexon</b> (H- 892) CD 8 T cells in peripheral blood (PB) and lymphoid (tonsils) compartments, using epitope specific pentamers. We show that in tonsils, epitope-specific pentamers detect a significantly higher frequency of P- 977 +CD 8 + T cells compared to H- 892 +CD 8 + T cells, although this trend gets reversed in PB. Tonsil epitope –specific CD 8 T cells express IFN-γ and IL- 2 but not perforin or TNF-α, whereas PB CD 8 T cells are positive for IFN-γ, TNF-α, and perforin. Tonsil epitope-specific CD 8 T cells express lymphoid homing marker CCR 7 and exhibit lower levels of the activation marker CD 25 but higher proliferative potential than PB CD 8 T cells. Finally, in parallel with the kinetics of mRNA expression, P- 977 -specific CTLs lyse targets as early as 8 hrs post infection. In contrast, H- 892 -specific CTLs do not kill unless infected fibroblasts are pretreated with IFN-γ to up regulate HLA class I antigens, and cytotoxicity is delayed until 16 - 24 hours. These data show that while both Ad early (Pol) and late (<b>Hexon)</b> <b>proteins</b> are recognized in humans, central memory type DNA polymerase CTLs dominate the lymphoid compartment and kill fibroblasts earlier after infection without requiring exogenous IFN-γ. Thus, use of CTLs targeted to early Ad proteins may improve the efficacy of immunotherapy for life-threatening Ad disease in SCT recipients. ...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the many}} {{potential}} advantages of Ad vectors for vaccine application, the full utility of current Ad vaccines {{may be limited}} by the host anti-vector immune response. Direct incorporation of antigens into the adenovirus capsid offers a new and exciting approach for vaccination strategies; this strategy exploits the inherent antigenicity of the Ad vector. Critical to exploiting Ad in this new context is the placement of antigenic epitopes within the major Ad capsid <b>protein,</b> <b>hexon.</b> In our current study we illustrate {{that we have the}} capability to place a range of antigenic epitopes within Ad 5 capsid <b>protein</b> <b>hexon</b> hypervariable regions (HVRs) 2 or 5, thus producing viable Ad virions. Our data define the maximal incorporation size at HVR 2 or HVR 5 as it relates to identical antigenic epitopes. In addition, this data suggests that Ad 5 HVR 5 is more permissive to a range of insertions. Most importantly, repeated administration of our hexon-modified viruses resulted in a secondary anti-antigen response, whereas minimal secondary effect was present after administration of Ad 5 control. Our study describes antigen placement and optimization {{within the context of the}} capsid incorporation approach of Ad vaccine employment, thereby broadening this new methodology...|$|R

We conclude that these alterations reflect a specific reorganization rather than an unorganized breakdown of the cell during adenovirus infection...|$|R
