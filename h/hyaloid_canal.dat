Occasionally, failure of the normal third-trimester gestational atrophy of the <b>hyaloid</b> <b>canal</b> and the tunica vasculosa lentis is associated with other anomalies.

50|$|In the fetus, the <b>hyaloid</b> <b>canal</b> {{contains}} a prolongation {{of the central}} artery of the retina, the hyaloid artery, which supplies blood to the developing lens. After birth, the <b>hyaloid</b> <b>canal</b> contains lymph and its purpose is to facilitate changes in {{the volume of the}} lens. As the lens expands in positive accommodation, its volume increases. This results in compression of the <b>hyaloid</b> <b>canal,</b> so that the volume of the eye remains constant.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Hyaloid</b> <b>canal</b> (Cloquet's {{canal and}} Stilling's canal) {{is a small}} {{transparent}} canal running through the vitreous body from the optic nerve disc to the lens. It is formed by an invagination of the hyaloid, a membrane which encloses the vitreous body.|$|E

5000|$|During {{the tenth}} week of {{development}} in humans (time varies depending on species), the lens grows independent of a blood supply and the hyaloid artery usually regresses. Its proximal portion remains as the central artery of the retina. Regression of the hyaloid artery leaves a clear central zone through the vitreous humor, called the <b>hyaloid</b> <b>canal</b> or Cloquet's canal. Cloquet's canal is named after the French physician Jules Germain Cloquet (1790-1883) who first described it.|$|E
