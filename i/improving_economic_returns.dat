The system consists of a derrick, a hoisting system, TDS, and a drill string system, and is inserted into a long, narrow borehole. The drill string then interacts with mud, the borehole wall, and the bottom hole, which generates resonance and {{increases the risk of}} drilling accidents. Natural frequency, which is related to the structure of the drill string, determines critical speed. In a vertical well, the transverse, torsional, and longitudinal fluid–structure interaction vibrations of the flexible multi-body drill string system within 1, 700 m was analysed using the ANSYS. The natural frequency and the associated critical speed for different bottomhole assemblies (BHAs) were obtained. Results show that reasonably selecting the TDS rotation speed and optimizing BHA offer practical engineering applications for increasing drilling speed, reducing drilling accidents, and <b>improving</b> <b>economic</b> <b>returns...</b>|$|E
40|$|Culling {{wildlife}} hosts {{is often}} implemented as a management technique to control pathogen transmission from wildlife to domestic or other economically important animals. However, culling may have unexpected consequences, {{can be expensive}} and may have wider implications for biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. 2.  We assess the evidence that culling mountain hares Lepus timidus is an effective and practical way to control louping ill virus in red grouse Lagopus lagopus scoticus. 3.  Evidence from the available literature is limited, restricting our ability to reliably assess the effectiveness of culling mountain hares to control ticks, louping ill virus, or increase red grouse densities. Furthermore, the information required to assess the cost-benefit of this management strategy is lacking. The population response of mountain hares to culling is not well understood and the possible effects on their conservation status and the upland ecosystem remain unexplored. 4.  We conclude {{that there is no}} compelling evidence base to suggest culling mountain hares might increase red grouse densities. 5.  Synthesis and applications. Widespread culling of wildlife is not necessarily effective in reducing disease or <b>improving</b> <b>economic</b> <b>returns.</b> The use of wildlife culls for disease control should be proposed only when: (i) the pathogen transmission cycle is fully understood with all host-vector interactions considered; (ii) the response of wildlife populations to culling is known; and (iii) cost-benefit analysis shows that increased revenue from reduced disease prevalence exceeds the cost of culling...|$|E
40|$|The {{site-specific}} {{application of}} inputs such as seed, fertilizer and crop protection chemicals {{has the potential}} to reduce input costs, maximize yields, and benefit the environment. The economic returns currently received by the early adopters of precision farming methods need to be improved before wide-scale acceptance of this practice will occur. These improvements include cost-effective identification and management of the spatial variability of soil and nutrients, applying inputs based on each site's productive capacity, and correct decision-making using the available layers of information. Soil electrical conductivity (EC) measurements have long been used to identify contrasting soil properties in the geological and environmental fields. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to discuss the applications in precision farming where EC maps are proving useful in <b>improving</b> <b>economic</b> <b>returns</b> to precision farming. The usefulness of soil conductivity stems from the fact that sands have a low conductivity, silts have a medium conductivity and clays have a high conductivity. Consequently, conductivity (measured at low frequencies) correlates strongly to soil grain size and texture. One of the applications of an EC map, which will be covered in this paper, is to view it in conjunction with other information layers. Farmers practicing precision farming methods have a wide assortment of data layers to assist them in their decision-making: yield maps, fertility/grid sampling data, soil surveys, a grower's historical knowledge, and visible changes in soil appearance and topography. As soil serves as the growth medium for crops, it is a major factor affecting a crop's potential. This paper provides examples of how an EC soil map, along with other information layers, can offer a promising foundation for precision farming...|$|E

LFTP has similar protein and fat contents as lean meat, but is more economical for processed meat formulations. In order to recommend best utilization of this inexpensive meat ingredient, we studied the protein composition and functionality of LFTP.

40|$|Our {{objectives}} were to evaluate strategies to <b>improve</b> productivity and <b>economic</b> <b>returns</b> from beef and dual-purpose cattle systems {{based on data}} collected on one dual-purpose (Bos taurus × Bos indicus) and two beef (Nellore) cattle farms in the western Amazon region of Brazil. Forage chemical composition and digestion rates of carbohydrate fractions of grazed Brachiaria decumbens and Brachiaria brizantha cv. Marandu grasses and Pueraria phaseoloides (tropical kudzu) legume were measured monthly during a 9 -mo period {{from the end of}} one dry season {{to the end of the}} subsequent rainy season. Measurements of milk and growth responses to grazing these forages were used to predict animal productivity responses to dietary nutrient availability throughout an annual cycle. The ME available for gain in our simulations was always more limiting than metabolizable protein. The predicted ME available for gain was 0. 50 kg/d for steers grazing B. brizantha and 0. 40 kg/d for finishing steers grazing B. decumbens. Grasses contained more NDF and neutral detergent insoluble protein and less ME (P < 0. 05) in the rainiest months than in the less rainy season, which resulted in 20 % less predicted weight gain by growing steers (P < 0. 05). Supplementation with sorghum grain was required to increase milk production and growth by 25 or 50 % per animal, respectively, but this strategy was less profitable than current forage-only diets. Greater productivity of land and labor from higher stocking indicated greater net margins for beef production, but not for milk. This study suggested that more intensive beef production by judicious fertilization of grass-legume pastures and greater stocking density is the preferable strategy for owners of these cattle systems to <b>improve</b> <b>economic</b> <b>returns</b> under current conditions.

There was a significant (P < 0. 05) breed effect for birth weight, with D (S) goats being the heaviest and fastest in growth from birth to weaning and from birth to sexual maturity. D (S) showed higher twinning percent (80), litter size at birth (1. 8), litter size at weaning (1. 7) and litter weight at weaning, kg (28. 4) than the other breeds.

A randomized blocks design with three replications was installed in a 2 x 5 x 4 factorial scheme, corresponding to two N sources (urea and cattle manure), five N doses (0 g plant- 1, 5 g plant- 1, 10 g plant- 1, 15 g plant- 1 and 20 g plant- 1) and four densities (51, 282 plants ha- 1, 76, 923 plants ha- 1, 90, 909 plants ha- 1 and 126, 984 plants ha- 1). The N sources did not affect the pH, total titratable acidity and total soluble solids/total titratable acidity ratio (TSS/TTA).

Wireworm (Limoniusspp.) populations and crop damage have been increasing in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) production across eastern Washington. Today nearly all spring cereal crop acres throughout eastern Washington are treated for wireworms with neonicotinoid insecticides such as Cruiser® (thiamethoxam) or Gaucho® (imidacloprid) at rates between 0. 190 - 0. 315 oz/cwt. At these rates, then eonicotinoids are toxic to wireworms but at sub-lethal doses, or in other words they repel or provide only seedling protection. Our objective {{is to find a}} labeled lethal dose of neonicotinoid insecticide to reduce wireworm populations. An on-farm test (OFT) was initiated in 2008 to examine spring wheat treated with 2. 0 oz/cwt of Gaucho vs. a non-Gaucho treated spring wheat check. At this location frost severely limited yield, however 2. 0 oz/cwt Gaucho had a trend for <b>improved</b> yield and <b>economic</b> <b>return</b> over costs, and it reduced wireworm populations by 78 %.

In the Australian sugar industry, the opportunity arose to evaluate the performance of 231 farms in the Tully Mill area in far north Queensland using production information on cane yield (t/ha) and CCS (a fresh weight measure of sucrose content in the cane) accumulated over a 12 -year period. Such an arrangement of data can be expressed as a 3 -way array where a farm × attribute × year matrix can be evaluated and interactions considered. Two multivariate techniques, the 3 -way mixture method of clustering and the 3 -mode principal component analysis, were employed to identify meaningful relationships between farms that performed similarly for both cane yield and CCS. In this context, farm has a spatial component and the aim of this analysis was to determine if systematic patterns in farm performance expressed by cane yield and CCS persisted over time. There was no spatial relationship between cane yield and CCS. However, the analysis revealed that the relationship between farms was remarkably stable from one year to the next for both attributes and there was some spatial aggregation of farm performance in parts of the mill area. This finding is important, since temporally consistent spatial variation may be exploited to improve regional production. Alternatively, the putative causes of the spatial variation may be explored to enhance the understanding of sugarcane production in the wet tropics of Australia...|$|R
40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to {{investigate}} the impact of carcase estimated breeding values on carcase size and lean meat yield of lambs and to determine whether nutrition alters these responses. Selection for high estimated breeding values for growth increased carcase size by as much as 4 kg in lambs fed a high plane of nutrition. On a low plane of nutrition, this effect was reduced by 60 %, highlighting the importance of nutrition for realizing the potential of this trait. Selection for estimated breeding values for muscling reduced total carcase fatness by 3 % in lambs fed at a low plane of nutrition and by 10 % in lambs fed at a high plane of nutrition, resulting in an increase in lean meat yield and <b>improved</b> <b>economic</b> <b>returns</b> for sales based on a lean-meat-yield grid. Selecting for estimated breeding values for low fat depth reduced total carcase fatness by 4 %; this effect was the same whether lambs were maintained on high or low planes of nutrition. Other aspects of meat quality maybe influenced by using sires selected for muscling. Meat tenderness may be reduced due to greater connective tissue content, but it is likely that this can be controlled by concurrent selection for growth. Juiciness and flavour may be reduced due to reduced intramuscular fat content, but this can be attenuated by nutritional practices and, in the longer term, by alleviating the negative selection for fatness. Selection for a combination of muscling and growth estimated breeding values in terminal sires is an excellent way to increase both carcase size and lean meat yield of lambs - and to provide greater returns for producers...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{ability to}} {{identify}} likely takeover targets {{at an early stage}} should provide an investor with valuable information to profit from investing in potential target firms. Based on the hypothesis that agents with asymmetric information operate in the securities market, the objective {{of this study is to}} develop an investment strategy able to achieve high portfolio returns and reduce risks by investing in takeover targets. The analysis conducted on tick-by-tick data from shares traded on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) uses a range of models from the logistic, neural network, forecast combination, Autoregressive Conditional Duration (ACD), along with associated market timing rules. The first part of this thesis contributes to the takeover prediction literature by showing that the combination of probability forecasts as an alternative approach improves forecast accuracy in takeover prediction with <b>improved</b> <b>economic</b> <b>return</b> from portfolios made up of predicted targets. The second part investigates the joint impact of market microstructure variables on return volatility in the months prior to the public release of the takeover announcement. The last part introduces an innovative market timing approach to capture information from the intraday trading and to guide portfolio investments. The information content of each trade is analysed in the search for trading behaviour consistent with the use of privileged information before the takeover announcement. Three general conclusions come from the results. First, an investment in a portfolio comprising predicted targets is capable of achieving significant abnormal returns. Second, traders who may hold private information before the event affect the intraday trading behaviour in takeover targets. Finally, the proposed Forecast Range Strategy is shown to be successful in predicting market trends and providing an alternative method for reducing risk without sacrificing return...|$|R

However, improved varieties, not sequences per se, contribute to <b>improved</b> <b>economic</b> <b>return</b> to the farmer. Functional genomics and systems biology research are facilitating the identification of gene networks that are involved in controlling genetic variation for agronomically valuable traits in elite breeding populations. Furthermore* combining the new knowledge from genomic research with conventional breeding methods is essential for enhancing response to selection, hence crop improvement. Superior varieties can result from the discovery of novel genetic variation, improved selection techniques, and/or the identification of genotypes with improved attributes due to superior combinations of alleles at multiple loci assembled through marker-assisted selection. Although it is clear that genomics research has great potential to revolutionize the discipline of plant breeding, high costs invested in/associated with genomics research currently limit the implementation of genomics-assisted crop improvement, especially for inbreeding and/or minor crops.

At the same time, the availability of resources {e. g. agricultural land) decreases. The objective of this study is to operationalize a methodology to assess the effectiveness of new crop and livestock technologies in attaining rural development goals, using Jiangxi Province as a case study area. Cropping and livestock systems, quantified in terms of inputs and outputs, are used as the smallest unit of analysis in this study. The new, also referred to as alternative, cropping systems comprise cultivation of Super Rice varieties and introduction of site-specific nutrient management (SSNM), integrated pest management (IPM) and mechanization in rice production. In alternative livestock systems, improved animal breeds, chemical treatment of crop residues and improved management in animal husbandry are adopted. A regional land use model, based on linear programming techniques, is used to assess the contribution of these alternative cropping and livestock systems to rural development goals. The results indicate that adoption of Super Rice varieties is most effective in attaining national grain security, while integration of Super Rice with improved beef cattle fattening systems is most effective in increasing income. Competition between livestock and rice production is limited, since high quality feed can be produced in rotation with rice without requiring additional rice land, and on non-rice land. Both, SSNM and IPM are most effective in reducing adverse environmental and human health effects, but hardly <b>improve</b> <b>economic</b> <b>returns.</b> Mechanization of rice production strongly reduces labour requirements in agriculture, leads to higher returns to labour and provides opportunities to work off-farm.

The main five categories of products purchased were pasteurized milk (11. 33 %), yogurts (23. 44 %), sour cream (18. 75 %), butter (10. 55 %) and cheeses (21. 48 %). The least dairy derived products categories purchased and consumed were UHT milk (4. 30 %), refrigerated milk (3. 91 %), raw milk (5. 86 %) and frozen milk (0. 00 %). The most important selection criterions of the surveyed consumers were ‘freshness’ (21. 72 %), expiring date (13. 64 %), taste characteristics (10. 10 %), price/quality ratio (13. 13 %) and nutritive value (16. 16 %).  Results {{of the current}} study should be taken into consideration by both farmers and dairy factories, in order to possible identify niche markets, in order to add value to the food chain and <b>improve</b> their <b>economic</b> <b>returns</b> by producing and selling products that have among higher demands from consumers...|$|R
40|$|The {{conversion}} of natural grasslands to both pine plantations and cultivation was {{studied in the}} South American tropical alpine ecosystem called páramo. Hydrological and meteorological {{data were collected from}} four microcatchments, each with predominant vegetation,. The water balance was analysed in order to obtain the evapotranspiration of each catchment. The natural grasslands catchments had the lowest evapotranspiration. Evaporation in the cultivated catchment was about 20 - 40 % higher, compared to 40 - 70 % in the pine catchment. Flow duration curves were derived from the discharge time series and used to assess differences in the hydrological response of the catchments. The cultivated catchment is characterized by a significantly faster hydrological response than the natural catchment. The flow duration curves show higher peak flows and lower base flows. In the pine catchment, both peak and base flow are drastically lower because of higher local consumption. In the past, pine plantations have been widely considered as a viable method to <b>improve</b> the <b>economic</b> <b>return</b> of the páramo. In view {{of the importance of the}} páramo as a water supplier, these activities might need to be re-evaluatevol. 31...|$|R
40|$|Coffee (Coffea arabica L.) is an {{important}} export commodity for Ethiopia and {{an important}} source of income in the country. It; contributes 41 % to foreign exchange earnings and 20 to 50 % to household income. A main coffee zone is the Aftomontane forest of southwestern Ethiopia, where it originates from. In Southwestern Ethiopia, coffee is produced under fourproduction systems with different degrees of intensification: forest coffee (10 % of total production), semi-forest coffee (35 %), garden coffee (35 %) and plantation coffee (20 %). As intensification increases, forest/shade coverage decreases and labor and other input requirements increase. The intensification in coffee production <b>improves</b> <b>economic</b> <b>returns</b> but often comes at the expense of forest cover loss, loss of biodiversity and other ecosystem services. To circumvent orminimize such trade-offs between socio-economic and environmental benefits, sustainability certification schemes have been developed. In this research we analyze whether coffee certification helps to promote socially responsible, economically attractive, and environmentally friendly coffee production. In theory, certification leads to price premiums and improved market access, which, in turn, creates financial incentives for producers to meet certification requirements. In southwestern Ethiopia coffee is currently certified for Fair Trade (FT) standards, Organic standards, and Rainforest Alliance (RFA) standards. Each certification scheme works with different principles and criteria. While specific schemes have their own focus, they all touch upon the three sustainability dimensions (economic, social and environmental). Despite a growing number of studies on coffee value chains and coffee certification in Ethiopia, there is still a lack of empirical evidence that can substantiate and quantify the social, economic and environmental effects of smallholdercoffee certification. Previous studies have typically looked at one certification scheme and analyzed the effects on economic outcome indicators. Social and environmental effects and the degree of coffee intensification are hardly taken in to account in studies on the impact of coffee certification. The objective of this PhD research is to empiricallyanalyze the economic, social and environmental effects of coffee certification along a coffee intensification gradient. We thereby hope to create insights on the potential for the sustainable development of smallholder coffee production systems in southwestern Ethiopia. nrpages: 177 status: publishe...|$|R

Se distribuyeron 240 pollos de ceba machos de raza Ross de un día de edad en un delineamiento {{experimental}} aleatorio con 6 tratamientos y 6 repeticiones por tratamiento, cada una de estas incluía 10 aves. Los tratamientos se constituyeron de 6 dietas en la fase inicial (1 - 21 días) y seis dietas en la fase final (22 - 42 días), en donde el maíz fue substituido en niveles crecientes: 0, 5, 10, 20 y 25 % por MC. Todas las aves recibieron agua junto con la comida {{ad libitum}} durante todo el desarrollo del experimento siendo las dietas iso-proteicas e iso-calóricas. El análisis de varianza demostró que tanto a los 21 días como a los 42 días de edad de los pollos existe una diferencia significativa (P This study analyzed {{the effects of}} adding dry sugar cane molasses (MC) to the feed of broiler chickens, and determining the economic feasibility of use {{of this type of}} diet; 240 male Ross race broiler chickens, one day in age, were utilized in this study. The experimental design was randomized with 6 treatments and 6 replicates per treatment, each one of which included 10 birds. The treatments included 6 feed types (T 1 -T 6) in the initial step (1 - 21 days) and 6 diets (T 1 -T 6) in the final step (22 - 42 days) with substitution of corn meal by dry MC at increasing levels of 0, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 %. All the birds received water and food ad libitum during the whole growth step; the diets were iso&# 8209;proteic and iso-caloric.

40|$|Humanity {{is facing}} a series of challenges, {{including}} climate change, biodiversity loss, decreasing availability of cheap fossil fuel energy and social inequality that, when taken together, constitute a sustainability crisis. Agricultural systems are vitally important {{for the survival of}} humanity and must be moved towards greater sustainability. In Vietnam, the challenges facing the agriculture sector are immediate and pressing. These challenges include the need to improve the livelihoods of millions of smallholder farmers, improve food safety and protect already heavily burdened ecosystems. In response to these challenges, a number of alternative agriculture approaches, including safe vegetable production and organic farming have emerged. While the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides are not permitted in certified organic agriculture, the requirements for safe vegetable production are not nearly as stringent. Chemical fertilizers and some low toxicity pesticides are allowed in safe vegetable production as long as pesticide residues are below proscribed limits. This research assesses the contributions that safe vegetable production and organic agriculture are making to the development of more sustainable agroecosystems in Vietnam. Organic production is still in early stages of development, with the majority of the projects directed towards production for export. Safe vegetables in contrast are produced primarily for the domestic market and demand is driven by consumer concerns over excessive pesticide use in conventional vegetable production. A sustainability assessment that explores the effect that safe vegetable production is having on eight major criteria for sustainability is applied in Cu Chi District, Ho Chi Minh City. Research methods included semi-structured interviews and group discussions with safe vegetable farmers together with interviews of other key actors from the agricultural sector in Vietnam. Along with the goal of protecting human health, farmers are interested in safe vegetable production because of <b>improved</b> <b>economic</b> <b>returns</b> made possible by reduced inputs and greater market access. While safe vegetable production is contributing to greater agroecosystem sustainability, further improvements are needed in some areas, specifically in the use of agrochemicals. There are encouraging signs in relation to pesticides, with some farmers reducing their pesticide use and moving towards less-toxic pesticides. Further movement towards sustainability could be fostered by a shift to the use of pesticides only as a last resort, a further shift from chemical to organic fertilizers, and improved capacity of farmers to experiment with and adapt safe vegetable production techniques...|$|R

This will <b>improve</b> the <b>economic</b> <b>return</b> by reducing input cost from water. Recent increase in energy cost for pumping water has necessitated this study to compare the benefits of continuing irrigation until black layer formation. With the decline of Ogallala aquifer groundwater level and rising fuel cost, any reduction of pumping makes economic sense. The first irrigation ending date around August 10 - 15, corresponding to denting and starch layer formation of to towards the germ layer resulted in an yield reduction of 17 bushels averaging for four years of data for a silty loam soil as compared to second ending date around August 21 - 22, which corresponded to starch layer at to towards the germ layer. However, continuing irrigation until September 1, corresponding {{to the start of}} black layer formation, improved yield by only 2. 5 bushels per acre. Economic sensitivity tests show that irrigating until the formation of starch layer at to towards germ layer is feasible with a corn price of $ 2 per bushel and $ 8 per inch pumping costs.
