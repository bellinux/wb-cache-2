5|$|An iOS {{version of}} the game, 999: The Novel, was {{developed}} by Spike Chunsoft as the second entry in their Smart Sound Novel series. It was released in Japan on May 29, 2013, and worldwide in English on March 17, 2014. This version lacks the Escape sections of the Nintendo DS version, and features high resolution graphics and an added <b>flowchart</b> that helps players keep track of which narrative paths they have experienced; additionally, dialogue is presented through speech bubbles, and an extra ending is included.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} alternates {{between two}} types of sections: Escape sections, where the player completes puzzles in escape-the-room scenarios; and Novel sections, where the player reads the game's narrative through visual novel segments, and makes decisions that influence the story toward one of twenty-four different endings. The player is given access to a <b>flowchart,</b> which allows them to revisit any previously completed section, and choose a different option to cause the story to proceed in another direction.|$|E
5|$|Zero Escape: The Nonary Games, {{a bundle}} that {{contains}} remastered versions of Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors and Virtue's Last Reward, was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita in the West on March 24, 2017. In Japan, the Microsoft Windows version launched on March 25, 2017, and the console versions on April 13. The European PlayStation Vita version {{will be released}} on December 15, 2017. The Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors remaster features voice acting, but the new ending from The Novel is not included. The remaster also includes a story <b>flowchart,</b> a feature used in the following games, that helps the player track which endings they have completed as to obtain the game's true ending.|$|E

Our conclusion is that D-charts are in one technical sense more restrictive than general <b>flowcharts,</b> but not if one allows the introduction of additional variables which represent a history of control flow...|$|R
5|$|Reviewers {{were divided}} in their {{opinions}} of the Escape sections. Edge and Wallace thought that the Escape sections were satisfying to solve, while Robinson did not find them fun. Boosinger called them dull and uninspired, but appreciated their connections to the game's mathematical and scientific themes. Several reviewers noted that the controls for both the Nintendo 3DS and the PlayStation Vita were awkward and oversensitive, and Molie L. Patterson of Electronic Gaming Monthly found the limited camera movement disappointing as well. Kemps commented that the user interface was improved from Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors. Many reviewers praised the <b>flowchart</b> for not forcing the player to replay previously completed sections or restart the game from the beginning, but Boosinger and Edge criticized it for removing the tension of making wrong decisions.|$|E
25|$|The terms AutoRun and AutoPlay {{tend to be}} interchangeably {{used when}} {{referring}} to the initiating action, the action that detects and starts reading from discovered volumes. The <b>flowchart</b> illustration in the AutoPlay article shows how AutoRun is positioned as a layer between AutoPlay and the Shell Hardware Detection service and may help in understanding the terminology. However, to avoid confusion, this article uses the term AutoRun when referring to the initiating action.|$|E
25|$|In playtesting {{the newer}} version, Pugh found that players {{did not respond}} well to having a preconceived idea of where the {{divergent}} points in the game took place, as represented by a <b>flowchart</b> early in the game, and this was taken out. However, Pugh also found that without some visual cues as to where divergent paths occurred, they would often miss these choices, and so added elements like colors to highlight that a choice was available at these points. In the original mod, one set of choices briefly takes the player to sections modeled after parts of Half-Life 2. In the remake, Pugh and Wreden included one section where the player briefly revisits the opening of Portal, and another where the player is dropped {{into the middle of}} a Minecraft game. These sections were included after getting approval from their creators Valve Corporation and Markus Persson, respectively.|$|E

25|$|A bundle {{containing}} {{the first two}} games, titled Zero Escape: The Nonary Games, was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita in the West on March 24, 2017. In Japan, the Microsoft Windows version launched on March 25, 2017, and the console versions on April 13. The European PlayStation Vita version will be released later in 2017. The updated version of Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors has separate Adventure and Novel modes; the Novel mode presents the character interactions similar to the original game, while Adventure mode uses animated characters and voice acting. The updated version also includes a story <b>flowchart,</b> similar {{to the other two}} games in the series, to help players with getting to the game's true ending. However, it does not include the additional content {{that was part of the}} iOS version. The new version of Virtue's Last Reward is primarily based on the existing PlayStation Vita version, but corrects some typographic errors.|$|E
25|$|When {{writing the}} stories, {{he started with}} their twist endings, and then worked his way back from that. He {{designed}} {{the flow of the}} story by using a spreadsheet, and wrote prototypes of potential outcomes of the different scenarios in the game; after this, he matched it with the <b>flowchart</b> he had made, and came up with the details of each story. As he wrote each scene, he imagined what the player might be thinking as they play through it, and decided what to write based on it; {{this was one of the}} most important things to him when writing. A key element to Uchikoshi when writing the outcomes of player decisions is that the importance of the decision usually is much greater after the player has made it, with the consequences only being revealed later on as the player learns more information; this was to maintain the high suspense level, and to avoid situations where choices end up not actually mattering. One big challenge for him was to maintain player interest through all branches; he tried to have each branch develop differently, as to avoid repetition and fatigue, and keep the player motivated. While he came up with the set-up, the setting, and the characters on his own, he had a sub-writer helping him with writing the second game, and two sub-writers for the third game. They would help with brainstorming ideas and finding what does not work so well and how to improve scenarios.|$|E
500|$|The {{player has}} access to a <b>flowchart</b> {{that allows them to}} {{immediately}} revisit or [...] "jump" [...] to any previously completed Novel or Escape section without replaying the game from the beginning. This allows the player to transition to an earlier branching point in the story and choose a different option that causes the story to progress in another direction. For example, the player can jump to a previous decision and ally with their opponent instead of betraying them, and vice versa. While there are 24 endings available, many endings are inaccessible initially and must be unlocked by experiencing events or learning information in other plotlines. For example, if a particular plotline cannot progress because a required password is unknown, the player must jump to another plotline and learn the password there before returning to the original one.|$|E

Like program flow of a Minsky machine, a <b>flowchart</b> always starts {{at the top of}} a page and proceeds down.

In the first game, the player has to start over from the beginning after completing each branch, replaying Escape sections; in the second game, the branches are represented by an interactive <b>flowchart,</b> allowing the player to jump to any point in the game that they have reached, and try different outcomes. This <b>flowchart</b> was also implemented in the iOS version of the first game.

2500|$|Uchikoshi {{prioritized}} storylines over characters, {{and used}} the feeling of discomfort {{as the foundation of}} the narrative. He first came up with a setting, and then made characters along with the drama and stories behind them. After this, he decided on the core of the game's story, and created a <b>flowchart</b> based on it, which became the [...] "bone structure of the story". According to Uchikoshi, it did not matter that the setups of the games were far-fetched, as long as their internal logic worked; he said {{that as long as the}} story is interesting and immersive, implausible situations feel plausible to the player. On the other hand, he felt that if he had specifically tried to make it more plausible, by forcing explanations that justify the situations, the story would become boring and the implausible would look even more implausible. Instead, he chose to rely on players' imagination, saying that players can make things seem plausible in ways he had not even imagined himself. One thing he did to make the stories more believable was adding concepts such as Schrödinger's cat, which he felt added flavor and kept players wondering whether a particular concept could be the main idea of the game; he felt that when players wonder that, it makes the story feel more real, as they create the game world in their minds.|$|E

Tony Ponce of Destructoid called 999 [...] "one of the greatest videogame tales ever told", and {{a great example of}} how engaging and powerful narratives in video games can be. Bob Mackey of 1UP.com featured 999 on a list of [...] "must-play" [...] Nintendo DS visual novels, citing its story, themes and [...] "zany narrative experimentation", and called Virtue's Last Reward [...] "one of the biggest, boldest visual novels to ever hit America". Writers for Famitsu liked the tense story and the sense of accomplishment when solving puzzles in 999, and the intertwined story and <b>flowchart</b> system in Virtue's Last Reward. Jason Schreier of Kotaku included both 999 and Virtue's Last Reward on a list of [...] "must-play" [...] visual novels worth playing even for people who do not like anime tropes.
