5|$|At the Leipzig {{performances}} of the cantata, the first verse of the chorale was probably sung by a soprano, <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> an instrumental rendition of the chorale tune in the first aria.

5|$|Breckinridge {{was also}} {{concerned}} with easing overland {{transport of goods}} to Virginia. In mid-1795, he, Robert Barr, Elijah Craig, and Harry Toulmin formed a committee {{to raise funds for}} a road connecting the Cumberland Gap to central Kentucky. Breckinridge was disappointed with the quality of the route, which was finished in late 1796, concluding that the individual maintaining it was keeping most of the tolls <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> them for the road's upkeep.|$|E

5|$|In casting Glee, Murphy {{sought out}} actors who could {{identify}} with the rush of starring in theatrical roles. <b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> traditional network casting calls, he spent three months on Broadway, where he found Matthew Morrison, who had previously starred on stage in Hairspray and The Light in the Piazza; Lea Michele, who starred in Spring Awakening; and Jenna Ushkowitz, {{who had been in}} the Broadway revival of The King and I.|$|E
5|$|Still unfinished, {{the vehicle}} was entered in an SPL {{competition}} in 1997 {{at which a}} complaint was lodged against the computer control of the DC motor. <b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> the controller, two leads were touched together {{in the hope that}} the motor speed was set correctly. The drive shaft broke after one positive stroke which created an interior pressure wave of 162dB. The Concept Design 60-inch was not shown in public after 1998.|$|E
5|$|The DX {{structural}} motif is {{the fundamental}} building block of the DNA origami method, {{which is used to}} make larger two- and three-dimensional structures of arbitrary shape. <b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> individual DX tiles, a single long scaffold strand is folded into the desired shape by a number of short staple strands. When assembled, the scaffold strand is continuous through the double-helical domains, while the staple strands participate in the Holliday junctions as crossover strands.|$|E

5|$|As {{it connects}} to I-580, I-205 is a frequently-congested major {{commuter}} {{route to the}} Bay Area. Signs on eastbound I-580 instruct travelers to take I-205, SR120, and SR99 to reach Modesto <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> the direct, but non-freeway, route SR132. I-205 also serves to connect the Bay Area with popular weekend destinations such as Yosemite, Reno, and Lake Tahoe. The Altamont Commuter Express provides commuters with an alternate route over Altamont Pass to San Jose and San Francisco, the latter through a transfer to BART.|$|E

5|$|Building {{began in}} 1909, using oak from the estate, {{metalwork}} from local blacksmiths, and stone quarried locally, {{brought to the}} site by a private railway line. Barnsley insisted that no machines would be used, so <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> a saw powered by steam engine, the wood was hand-sawn in a saw pit. The east wing was completed by 1915, and the Biddulphs moved into them, with the reception rooms finished around the same time. Despite {{the grandeur of the}} building, the Biddulph's lived in some small rooms and fitted the large reception rooms for community use. Biddulph also built some cottages {{at the site of the}} old manor house at Rodmarton around the same time.|$|E
5|$|CTW {{solicited}} the Educational Testing Service (ETS) {{to conduct}} its summative research. CTW and ETS hired and trained coordinators, testers, and observers from local communities to conduct these studies. The most relevant {{tests of the}} show's effectiveness were comparisons between children who watched it regularly {{and those who did}} not. After the first season, however, Sesame Street was so widely watched that it was difficult to make this distinction; ETS began to have problems finding subjects for their non-viewing groups, which weakened the experimental design. It solved this problem by selecting control-group households from areas that did not broadcast the show. <b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> groups of viewers and non-viewers, later large-scale studies used statistical designs and methods for estimating cause-effect relationships.|$|E
5|$|Diệm {{used the}} Ministry of Information's electoral {{education}} campaign as a partisan political tool. <b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> it purely {{to explain the}} democratic process, the campaign was used to extol Diệm and his allies.

After elaborating on {{the powers of the}} head of state, the pamphlet went on to champion Diệm as an anti-communist who could defend people's freedom, while explaining why Bảo Đại was unfit to lead, saying {{that he did not have}} respect among the international community.|$|E

An actual peacock was featured here. In one scene, Liz Lemon sees Argus and is frightened of him. While talking to Jack, Argus hits Liz across the face with his feathers, thus marking her as his mate. To accommodate this, puppeteers—Peter Linz, Noel MacNeal, and Carmen Osbahr—were brought in to hit Liz in the face with feathers <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> the peacock itself.|$|E
5|$|For Shaw's Ferrari, it {{was decided}} that {{purchasing}} an actual model of which only 350 exist and would cost at least $1million would be too expensive and the vehicle would be unsuitable for filming purposes. Instead, two replicas were commissioned, a process which took three months under the supervision of prop master Peter Gelfman. The replicas then received additional reinforcement for filming purposes from Steve Kirshoff and the special effects crew. After running camera tests on several authentic Ferrari colors, {{it was decided}} to paint the replicas bright red {{in order to create a}} lasting impression <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> the actual metallic brown muted-coloring of McQueen's vehicle.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Krug led the {{challenge}} to {{the constitutionality of the}} Children's Internet Protection Act. Her efforts led to a partial victory for the Act's opponents; the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that the law was constitutional, but that internet filtering software on computers in public libraries could be turned off if so requested by an adult guardian. She said that filters used to censor Internet pornography from children were not perfect and risked blocking educational information about social matters, sexuality, and healthcare. She emphasized the need to educate children about morality <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> online filters to block information from them. In 2006, she was elected Vice-President of the Phi Beta Kappa Society.|$|E

Although the March 2012 {{issue of the}} magazine AirForces Monthly stated that the USMC intended to fly some of the ex-British Harrier IIs, <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> them just for spare parts, the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) has since stated that the USMC has never had any plans to operate those Harriers.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the innovative visual effects for the film, Stokdyk created a miniature of a skyscraper section at 1:16 scale with New Deal Studios' Ian Hunter and David Sanger. Stokdyk chose to design the miniature <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> computer-generated imagery so damage done to the building could be portrayed realistically and timely without guesswork involving computer models. In addition, to Sony Imageworks, Cafe FX provided visual effects for the crane disaster scene when Spider-Man rescues Gwen Stacy, as well as shots in the climactic battle.|$|E
5|$|Instead of {{blurring}} and thresholding, {{this method}} can alternatively {{be described as}} applying a median filter with Gaussian weights to each pixel.
