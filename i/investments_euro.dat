40|$|It {{is often}} {{discussed}} how bank-dependent for financing <b>investment</b> <b>euro</b> area firms are. It {{is estimated that}} 80 % of their investment needs are financed from banks and only 20 % from capital markets, while in the US the reverse is true. One {{of the reasons for}} this may be the large number of small and medium sized firms (SMEs) in Europe that are relatively small to be analysed and rated by rating companies. Hence, they remain dependent on the assessment of their local bank branch. Another reason may be the fragmentation of national capital markets where asymmetry of information, differences in regulation and savings availability issues are important...|$|R

40|$|Computed {{fundamental}} real {{exchange rates}} in four acceding countries {{point out to}} difficulties in entering the ERM II too soon after the EU entry. Computations {{suggest that it is}} unlikely for the Czech, Hungarian and Polish economies to maintain low inflation during 2004 - 2010, and at the same time, to keep their currencies within the ERM II. In addition, those currencies were overvalued in 2003. Moreover, experience of Greece, Portugal, and Spain – viewed through the fundamental real exchange rates goggles - indicate both more stable paths of real exchange rates as well as smaller currency misalignments prior to the euro adoption than what can be expected from the acceding countries in the forthcoming years. If acceding countries sail too fast towards the euro, their sailing may not be as smooth as the one of frontrunners.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} reasons for which the very accommodative policy led by the ECB has not {{triggered}} a rebound of investment. After examining the evolutions of <b>investment</b> in the <b>euro</b> area, we observe a large heterogeneity both across sectors and countries.

We use a counterfactual analysis and compute the level of investment had the ECB’s decisions been different. We observe the importance of the ECB in support to investment. Indeed, the <b>investment</b> in the <b>euro</b> area would have sunk without accommodative – first conventional, then unconventional – monetary policy. Finally, we lay the emphasis on the role of credit demand as one of the main determinants of investment since the 2008 crisis, which has depended among others on the impact of deleveraging and fiscal consolidation...|$|R

40|$|The Brexit vote has {{considerably}} increased economic {{uncertainty in}} Europe and beyond. It will likely affect economic performance {{and in particular}} <b>investment</b> in the <b>euro</b> area, which are both already relatively weak. The impact of this uncertainty shock on the euro area and the German economy is estimated with an econometric framework. A counterfactual analysis indicates that the uncertainty associated with the Brexit vote reduces GDP in the model economy for the euro area {{for more than two}} years, with a trough of about 0. 2 percent after eight months, relative to a situation in which this shock would not have occurred. It also leads to an increase in the unemployment rate and to a mild decline of consumer prices. Investment is estimated to fall by approximately 0. 7 percent over the horizon of one year. In Germany, these effects are qualitatively and quantitatively similar. The findings highlight the importance to stimulate <b>investment</b> in the <b>euro</b> area and in Germany, and to minimize uncertainty in the further political process...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the determinants of}} bilateral international equity and bond portfolio reallocation across a large cross-section of countries spanning over two sample periods: 1997 - 2001 and 1997 - 2005. We find that the strongest drivers are the marginal diversification benefits arising from the pure asset component and the initial degree of underweight. This evidence suggests that global portfolio reallocations over the asset boom and bust period were determined by optimal diversification considerations. We also find that due to economic and monetary union (EMU) the weight assigned by euro area investors to <b>investment</b> in <b>euro</b> area countries increased significantly in equity and fixed income portfolios, with a trade diverting effect against the British bond market.
