5|$|Metagenomics allows {{researchers}} {{to access the}} functional and metabolic diversity of microbial communities, but it cannot show which of these processes are active. The extraction and analysis of metagenomic mRNA (the metatranscriptome) provides information on the regulation and <b>expression</b> <b>profiles</b> of complex communities. Because of the technical difficulties (the short half-life of mRNA, for example) {{in the collection of}} environmental RNA there have been relatively few in situ metatranscriptomic studies of microbial communities to date. While originally limited to microarray technology, metatranscriptomcs studies have made use of transcriptomics technologies to measure whole-genome expression and quantification of a microbial community, first employed in analysis of ammonia oxidation in soils.|$|E

The EFS mRNA was also identified as differentially expressed in two of the three groups of glioblastoma multiforme as identified by gene <b>expression</b> <b>profiles</b> (GEPs). EFS was differentially expressed in the GEP1 and GEP3 groups, which were associated with worse prognosis, with more significant cytogenetic abnormalities and genomic instabilities observed in this groups.|$|E

Gene <b>expression</b> <b>profiling</b> {{test scores}} have {{primarily}} {{been used to}} identify heart transplant recipients who have a low probability of rejection {{at the time of}} surveillance testing. We hypothesized that the variability of gene <b>expression</b> <b>profiling</b> test scores within a patient may predict risk of future events of allograft dysfunction or death. Method. Patients from the IMAGE study with rejection surveillance gene <b>expression</b> <b>profiling</b> tests performed at 1 - to 6 -month intervals were selected for this cohort study. Gene <b>expression</b> <b>profiling</b> score variability was defined as the standard deviation of an individual’s cumulative test scores. Gene <b>expression</b> <b>profiling</b> ordinal score (range, 0 Y 39), threshold score (binary value= 1 if ordinal score Q 34), and score variability were studied in multivariate Cox regression models to predict future clinical events. Results. Race, age at time of transplantation, and time posttransplantation were significantly associated with future events in the univariate analysis. In the multivariate analyses, gene <b>expression</b> <b>profiling</b> score variability, but not ordinal scores or scores over threshold, was independently associated with future clinical events. The regression co-efficient P values were G 0. 001, 0. 46, and 0. 773, for gene <b>expression</b> <b>profiling</b> variability, ordinal, and threshold scores, respectively. The hazard ratio for a 1 unit increase in variability was 1. 76 (95 % CI, 1. 4 Y 2. 3). Discussion. The variability of a heart recipient’s gene <b>expression</b> <b>profiling</b> test scores over time may provide prog-nostic utility.

25|$|RNA {{sequencing}} (RNA-Seq) is {{a powerful}} computational tool that allows for the quantification of RNA expression for all genes within a sample. Incorporating RNA-Seq into browning studies is of great value, as it offers better specificity, sensitivity, and a more comprehensive overview of gene expression than other methods. RNA-Seq {{has been used in}} both human and mouse studies in an attempt characterize beige adipocytes according to their gene <b>expression</b> <b>profiles</b> and to identify potential therapeutic molecules that may induce the beige phenotype. One such study used RNA-Seq to compare gene <b>expression</b> <b>profiles</b> of WAT from wild-type (WT) mice and those overexpressing Early B-Cell Factor-2 (EBF2). WAT from the transgenic animals exhibited a brown fat gene program and had decreased WAT specific gene expression compared to the WT mice. Thus, EBF2 has been identified as a potential therapeutic molecule to induce beiging.|$|E

In the context of cancer, gene <b>expression</b> <b>profiling</b> {{has been used to}} more accurately classify tumors.

In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, gene <b>expression</b> <b>profiling</b> has revealed at least 2 diseases that are strikingly different in their response to chemotherapy and the inhibition of critical oncogenic pathways. In follicular lymphoma, gene <b>expression</b> <b>profiling</b> showed that the host immune response to tumors is an important determinant of outcome and can strongly predict survival at the time of diagnosis. The application of immunologic therapies that modify the host immune response could have a major effect on survival in patients with follicular lymphoma.

The module eigengene of a given module is defined as the first principal component of the standardized <b>expression</b> <b>profiles.</b> Eigengenes define robust biomarkers. To find modules that relate to a clinical trait of interest, module eigengenes are correlated with the clinical trait of interest, which gives rise to an eigengene significance measure. Eigengenes can be used as features in more complex predictive models including decision trees and Bayesian networks. One can also construct co-expression networks between module eigengenes (eigengene networks), i.e. networks whose nodes are modules.|$|E
25|$|Many {{periodically}} expressed {{genes are}} driven by transcription factors that are also periodically expressed. One screen of single-gene knockouts identified 48 transcription factors (about 20% of all non-essential transcription factors) that show cell cycle progression defects. Genome-wide studies using high throughput technologies have identified the transcription factors that bind to the promoters of yeast genes, and correlating these findings with temporal expression patterns have allowed the identification of transcription factors that drive phase-specific gene expression. The <b>expression</b> <b>profiles</b> of these transcription factors {{are driven by}} the transcription factors that peak in the prior phase, and computational models have shown that a CDK-autonomous network of these transcription factors is sufficient to produce steady-state oscillations in gene expression).|$|E
25|$|As {{described}} above, one {{can identify}} significantly regulated genes {{first and then}} find patterns by comparing the list of significant genes to sets of genes known to share certain associations. One can also work the problem in reverse order. Here is a very simple example. Suppose there are 40 genes associated with a known process, for example, a predisposition to diabetes. Looking at two groups of <b>expression</b> <b>profiles,</b> one for mice fed a high carbohydrate diet and one for mice fed a low carbohydrate diet, one observes that all 40 diabetes genes are expressed {{at a higher level}} in the high carbohydrate group than the low carbohydrate group. Regardless of whether any of these genes would have made it to a list of significantly altered genes, observing all 40 up, and none down appears unlikely {{to be the result of}} pure chance: flipping 40 heads in a row is predicted to occur about one time in a trillion attempts using a fair coin.|$|E

In this case report, we note that based on histology, immunohistochemistry and <b>expression</b> <b>profile</b> this patient’s poorly differentiated neuroendocrine tumor would {{have been expected to}} grow very rapidly on no therapy. Instead, this cancer was very indolent, with only very little radiographic progression over several years. We believe this report represents a remarkable case of a tumor where features, including <b>expression</b> <b>profile,</b> would not at all have accurately predicted the clinical course seen.
