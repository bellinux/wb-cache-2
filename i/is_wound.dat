5|$|The {{building}} is mainly 14thcentury although the east {{wall of the}} chancel contains remnants of 12th-century material, including two clamped buttresses. The ashlar-faced tower is 14thcentury with angled buttresses north and south. The west window has three lights with flowing tracery. The clock on the east face of the tower, dated 1876, is by JB Joyce & Co of Whitchurch, Shropshire, the oldest firm of tower clockmakers in the world; it <b>is</b> <b>wound</b> weekly by the churchwardens.|$|E
5|$|In around 1770 {{the neoclassical}} {{architect}} Robert Adam designed Pulteney Bridge, a three-arched bridge spanning the River Avon. He used as his prototype an original, but unused, design by Andrea Palladio for the Rialto Bridge in Venice. Adam also submitted {{plans for the}} new Assembly Rooms but these were rejected as too costly. John Wood, the Younger raised funding {{for the construction of}} the Assembly Rooms by the use of a Tontine, an investment plan that is named after the Neapolitan banker Lorenzo de Tonti, who is credited with inventing it in France in 1653. It combines features of a group annuity and a lottery. Each subscriber pays an agreed sum into the fund, and thereafter receives an annuity. As members die, their shares devolve to the other participants, and so the value of each annuity increases. On the death of the last member, the scheme <b>is</b> <b>wound</b> up. Construction started in 1769 and was completed in 1771, when a grand opening was held.|$|E

25|$|Modern banjos are {{typically}} strung with metal strings. Usually the fourth string <b>is</b> <b>wound</b> with either steel or bronze-phosphor alloy. Some players may string their banjos with nylon or gut strings {{to achieve a}} more mellow, old-time tone.|$|E
25|$|Bass strings in pianos are {{generally}} constructed with round—sometimes hexagonal—drawn-steel cores, over which copper <b>is</b> <b>wound.</b> Especially on round core wire, {{the last several}} inches of {{the area where the}} winding terminates is often flattened—swaged—to create a grabbing point for the copper winding material.|$|E
25|$|Some systems use Null Current systems (also {{sometimes}} called Null Flux systems). These use a coil that <b>is</b> <b>wound</b> {{so that it}} enters two opposing, alternating fields, so that the average flux in the loop is zero. When the vehicle is in the straight ahead position, no current flows, but any moves off-line create flux that generates a field that naturally pushes/pulls it back into line.|$|E

25|$|Crompton {{built his}} mule from wood. Although he used Hargreaves' ideas of {{spinning}} multiple threads and of attenuating the roving with rollers, {{it was he}} who put the spindles on the carriage and fixed a creel of roving bobbins on the frame. Both the rollers and the outward motion of the carriage remove irregularities from the rove before it <b>is</b> <b>wound</b> on the spindle. When Arkwright's patents expired, the mule was developed by several manufacturers.|$|E
25|$|Mule {{spindles}} rest on {{a carriage}} that travels on a track a distance of , while drawing out and spinning the yarn. On the return trip, known as putting up, as the carriage moves back to its original position, the newly spun yarn <b>is</b> <b>wound</b> onto the spindle {{in the form of}} a cone-shaped cop. As the mule spindle travels on its carriage, the roving which it spins is fed to it through rollers geared to revolve at different speeds to draw out the yarn.|$|E

60|$|The {{captains of}} Emmanuel were clad in silver armour, and the {{soldiers}} in that which was of proof; the soldiers of Diabolus were clad in iron which was made to give place to Emmanuel's engine- shot. In the town, some were hurt, and some <b>were</b> greatly <b>wounded.</b> Now, {{the worst of it}} was, a chirurgeon was scarce in Mansoul, for that Emmanuel at present was absent. Howbeit, with the leaves of a tree the <b>wounded</b> <b>were</b> kept from dying; yet their wounds did greatly putrefy, and some did grievously stink. Of the townsmen, these <b>were</b> <b>wounded,</b> namely, my Lord Reason; he <b>was</b> <b>wounded</b> in the head. Another that <b>was</b> <b>wounded</b> <b>was</b> the brave Lord Mayor; he <b>was</b> <b>wounded</b> in the eye.

25|$|For the hajj, {{the annual}} pilgrimage to Mecca, Muslim men wear the ihram, a simple, {{seamless}} garment made of white, terry clothlike cotton. One piece <b>is</b> <b>wound</b> skirt-like around {{the lower half}} of the body; the other is thrown loosely over one shoulder. The Qahtani sheep herders in the Southern Asir provence wear ankle-length skirt-like kilts. In Yemen standard dress is a calf-length, wraparound skirt, the futah. The Palestinians of the Eastern Mediterranean traditionally wear the qumbaz, an ankle-length unisex garment, which opens all the way down the front with the right side brought over the left, under the arm, and then fastened.|$|E
25|$|The new {{generation}} Zero-Hum P-90 Hx by Kinman has an authentic P-90 sound and appearance but {{is far more}} complex with some 202 individual parts. Sonically destructive magnetic coupling between the coils is negated by highly efficient magnetic shields around the upper coil. The lower coil <b>is</b> <b>wound</b> with much thicker wire and far fewer turns onto a unique laminated steel bobbin which imparts ultra high efficiency; thus, the hum voltage {{is the same as}} the upper coil and cancels hum perfectly. Kinman advertise their P-90 Hx as having a sonically transparent 600-Ohm hum sensor which is remarkable considering the large amount of hum that P-90s put out.|$|E
25|$|The {{origins of}} {{spinning}} fibre to make string or yarn are lost in time, but archaeological {{evidence in the}} form of representation of string skirts has been dated to the Upper Paleolithic era, some 20,000 years ago. In the most primitive type of spinning, tufts of animal hair or plant fibre are rolled down the thigh with the hand, and additional tufts are added as needed until the desired length of spun fibre is achieved. Later, the fibre is fastened to a stone which is twirled round until the yarn is sufficiently twisted, whereupon it <b>is</b> <b>wound</b> upon the stone and the process repeated over and over.|$|E

25|$|This process {{continues}} {{until the}} whole skein <b>is</b> <b>wound.</b> The time to skein yarn on a niddy-noddy {{depends on the}} yardage, and thus how many wraps need to be made. A larger niddy-noddy can speed up the skeining, but a very large one can be bulky, and thus slow down {{the time to do}} one wrap. At this point, the skein is secured by loose figure eight knots between each crossbar. This can be done with scrap yarn, or with slip knots {{from the end of the}} skein. In either case, loosely securing each end with a slip knot makes it easier to find the ends in the finished skein. Generally 4 or more knots are tied.|$|E
25|$|Long draw is spun from a carded rolag. The rolag is spun {{without much}} {{stretching}} of the fibres from the cylindrical configuration. This {{is done by}} allowing twist into a short section of the rolag, and then pulling back, without letting the rolag change position in one's hands, until the yarn is the desired thickness. The twist will concentrate in the thinnest part of the roving; thus, when the yarn is pulled, the thicker sections with less twist will tend to thin out. Once the yarn is the desired thickness, enough twist is added to make the yarn strong. Then the yarn <b>is</b> <b>wound</b> onto the bobbin, and the process starts again.|$|E
25|$|Franklin {{also had}} a {{research}} assistant, James Watt, subsidised by the National Coal Board and was now {{the leader of the}} ARC group at Birkbeck. The Birkbeck team members continued working on RNA viruses affecting several plants, including potato, turnip, tomato and pea. In 1955 the team was joined by an American post-doctoral student Donald Caspar. He worked on the precise location of RNA molecules in TMV. In 1956 he and Franklin published individual but complementary papers in the 10 March issue of Nature, in which they showed that the RNA in TMV <b>is</b> <b>wound</b> along the inner surface of the hollow virus. Caspar was not an enthusiastic writer, and Franklin had to write the entire manuscript for him.|$|E

25|$|The four {{strands of}} the tzitzit are passed through holes near {{the four corners}} of the garment (Shulchan Aruch Orach Chaim 11:9-11:15) that are {{farthest}} apart (10:1). Four tzitzyot are passed through each hole (11:12-13), and the two groups of four ends are double-knotted to each other {{at the edge of the}} garment near the hole (11:14,15). One of the four tzitzit is made longer than the others (11:4); the long end of that one <b>is</b> <b>wound</b> around the other seven ends and double-knotted; this is done repeatedly so as to make a total of five double knots separated by four sections of winding, with a total length of at least four inches, leaving free-hanging ends that are twice that long (11:14).|$|E
25|$|Poirot meets Sir Joseph {{and offers}} two alternatives: prosecute the {{criminal}} (whom he doesn't name), {{in which case}} he will lose his money, or just {{take the money and}} call the case closed. The greedy Sir Joseph agrees to the latter option and takes Poirot's cheque. The detective turns the conversation round to murder cases and tells a rattled Sir Joseph that he reminds him of a Belgian murderer who poisoned his wife to marry his secretary. Poirot's meaning is quite clear and the shaken man gives Poirot his cheque back, telling him to keep the money. Poirot sends it back to the Misses Carnaby, telling them that it is the final contribution to their fund before it <b>is</b> <b>wound</b> up. Meanwhile, Lady Hoggin tells her relieved husband that her tonic no longer tastes so bitter.|$|E
25|$|Most modern sewing {{machines}} use the lockstitch technique of sewing invented by Walter Hunt, {{which consists of}} two threads, an upper and a lower. The upper thread runs from a spool kept on a spindle on top of or next to the machine, through a tension mechanism, a take-up arm, and finally {{through the hole in}} the needle. The lower thread <b>is</b> <b>wound</b> onto a bobbin, which is inserted into a case in the lower section of the machine. Walter Hunt invented the first lock-stitch sewing machine in 1833. Hunt lost interest and did not patent his invention. In 1846, Elias Howe secured a patent on an original lock-stitch machine, and failed to manufacture and market it. Isaac Singer infringed on Howe's patent to make his own machine, making him wealthy. Elias Howe filed a lawsuit, alleging patent infringement. On July 1, 1854, a federal commission ruled in favor of Howe, ordering Isaac Singer as well as all sewing machine makers to pay Elias Howe royalties.|$|E
