5|$|A {{disappointed}} Oliphant {{flew to the}} United States {{to speak}} to the American scientists. These included Ernest Lawrence at the University of California's Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley. The two men had met before the war, and were friends. Lawrence was sufficiently impressed to commence his own research into uranium. Uranium-235 makes up only about 0.72% of natural uranium, so the separation factor of any uranium <b>enrichment</b> <b>process</b> needs to be higher than 1250 to produce 90% uranium-235 from natural uranium. The Maud Committee had recommended that this be done by a process of gaseous diffusion, but Oliphant had pioneered another technique in 1934: electromagnetic separation. This was the process that Nier had used.|$|E

5|$|Gaseous {{diffusion}} {{is based}} on Graham's law, which states {{that the rate of}} effusion of a gas through a porous barrier is inversely proportional to the square root of the gas's molecular mass. In a container with a porous barrier containing a mixture of two gases, the lighter molecules will pass out of the container more rapidly than the heavier molecules. The gas leaving the container is slightly enriched in the lighter molecules, while the residual gas is slightly depleted. A container wherein the <b>enrichment</b> <b>process</b> takes place through gaseous diffusion is called a diffuser.|$|E
5|$|Germanium's {{abundance}} in the Earth's crust is approximately 1.6ppm. Only a few minerals like argyrodite, briartite, germanite, and renierite contain appreciable amounts of germanium, and none in mineable deposits. Some zinc-copper-lead ore bodies contain enough germanium to justify extraction {{from the final}} ore concentrate. An unusual natural <b>enrichment</b> <b>process</b> causes a high content of germanium in some coal seams, discovered by Victor Moritz Goldschmidt during a broad survey for germanium deposits. The highest concentration ever found was in Hartley coal ash with as much as 1.6% germanium. The coal deposits near Xilinhaote, Inner Mongolia, contain an estimated 1600tonnes of germanium.|$|E
5|$|After the August 1943 Quebec Agreement merged the British and American {{atomic bomb}} projects, Mark Oliphant persuaded the Admiralty to release Massey {{to work on}} the Manhattan Project. In November 1943, Massey set out with Oliphant for the Radiation Laboratory at the University of California in Berkeley in a B-24 Liberator bomber. The Radiation Laboratory's part was to develop an {{electromagnetic}} isotope separation process. Massey was in charge of its Theoretical Group, which included American David Bohm and Australian Eric Burhop. They studied the characteristics of electric discharges in magnetic fields, today known as Bohm diffusion, and studied the ionization of uranium compounds used as feed in the electromagnetic uranium <b>enrichment</b> <b>process</b> such as uranium tetrachloride (UCl4) and uranium hexafluoride (UF6). Oliphant returned to Britain in March 1945, and was replaced as head of the British mission in Berkeley by Massey.

5|$|Like the United States, the Soviet Union (USSR) {{carried out}} {{research}} on multiple enrichment technologies for the Soviet atomic bomb project. A trial electromagnetic process {{was carried out}} in 1946 with a calutron using a magnet taken from Germany. A site was chosen for an electromagnetic plant at Sverdlovsk-45 in 1946. The pilot plant, known as Plant 418, was completed in 1948. A more efficient design was developed in which the particle beams were bent by 225° instead of 180° as in the American calutron. It was used to complete the uranium <b>enrichment</b> <b>process</b> after technical difficulties were encountered with the gaseous diffusion process. Uranium enriched to about 40 percent uranium-235 was brought to Sverdlovsk-45 for final enrichment to between 92 and 98 percent. After the problems with the gaseous diffusion process were resolved in 1950, it was decided not to proceed with a full-scale electromagnetic plant. , it remains operational. In 1969, a research calutron known as S-2 was built at Arzamas-16 for high-efficiency separation of isotopes of heavy elements like plutonium.|$|E
5|$|On 26 May 1943, Oliphant {{wrote to}} Appleton {{to say that}} he had been {{considering}} the problem of electromagnetic isotope separation, and believed that he had devised a better method than Lawrence's, one which would result in a five to tenfold improvement in efficiency, and make it more practical to use the process in Britain. His proposal was reviewed by Akers, Chadwick, Peierls and Simon, who agreed that it was sound. While the majority of scientific opinion in Britain favoured the gaseous diffusion method, there was still a possibility that electromagnetic separation might be useful as a final stage in the <b>enrichment</b> <b>process,</b> taking uranium that had already been enriched to 50 per cent by the gaseous process, and enriching it to pure uranium-235. Accordingly, Oliphant was released from the radar project to work on Tube Alloys, conducting experiments on his method at the University of Birmingham.|$|E
25|$|The HEU {{feedstock}} {{can contain}} unwanted uranium isotopes: 234U {{is a minor}} isotope contained in natural uranium; during the <b>enrichment</b> <b>process,</b> its concentration increases but remains well below 1%. High concentrations of 236U are a byproduct from irradiation in a reactor and may be contained in the HEU, depending on its manufacturing history. HEU reprocessed from nuclear weapons material production reactors (with an 235U assay of approx. 50%) may contain 236U concentrations as high as 25%, resulting in concentrations of approximately 1.5% in the blended LEU product. 236U is a neutron poison; therefore the actual 235U concentration in the LEU product must be raised accordingly {{to compensate for the}} presence of 236U.|$|E

40|$|There {{is still}} an ongoing {{scientific}} discussion regarding the importance of erosion-induced lateral soil organic carbon (SOC) redistribution for the burial and/or mineralisation of carbon and the resulting long-term C balance at the catchment scale. Especially {{the effects of the}} event driven nature of water erosion and the potentially associated enrichment of SOC in sediment delivery are still unclear. In general, two <b>processes</b> lead to <b>enrichment</b> of SOC: (i) enrichment due to selective interrill erosion at erosion sites, and (ii) enrichment due to selective depletion at deposition sites. In this study, the conceptual soil erosion and SOC turnover model SPEROS-C was adapted to integrate these processes and applied in a small arable catchment (4. 2 ha) in Germany for a 57 -year period. A total number of 901 model runs were performed with different realisations of frequency and magnitude of water erosion as well as realisations of enrichment and depletion ratios taken from literature and compared to a reference model run representing mean annual erosion without <b>enrichment</b> <b>processes.</b> In general, our modelling study indicates that ignoring temporal variability and <b>enrichment</b> <b>processes</b> may lead to a substantial misinterpretation of erosion-induced C fluxes. Especially the vertical C flux (difference between C inputs from plant assimilates and organic fertilizer and SOC mineralisation) at deposition sites strongly depends on the model parameterisation ranging from a maximum C source of - 336 gCm- 2 to a maximum C sink of 44 gCm- 2. In combination with a substantially higher C export due to <b>enrichment</b> <b>processes,</b> the overall C balance of the catchment potentially turns into a maximum C source of - 44 gCm- 2 {{at the end of the}} simulation period compared to a C source of - 1 gCm- 2 for the reference run...|$|R

500|$|The gas {{centrifuge}} process, where gaseous uranium hexafluoride (...) is separated by {{the difference in}} molecular weight between 235UF6 and 238UF6 using high-speed centrifuges, is the cheapest and leading <b>enrichment</b> <b>process.</b> The gaseous diffusion process had been the leading method for enrichment and {{was used in the}} Manhattan Project. In this process, uranium hexafluoride is repeatedly diffused through a silver-zinc membrane, and the different isotopes of uranium are separated by diffusion rate (since uranium 238 is heavier it diffuses slightly slower than uranium-235). The molecular laser isotope separation method employs a laser beam of precise energy to sever the bond between uranium-235 and fluorine. This leaves uranium-238 bonded to fluorine and allows uranium-235 metal to precipitate from the solution. An alternative laser method of enrichment is known as atomic vapor laser isotope separation (AVLIS) and employs visible tunable lasers such as dye lasers. Another method used is liquid thermal diffusion.|$|E

Like nearly everyone else, Oppenheimer had been thinking of uranium enrichment in terms of a process to produce weapons grade uranium suitable for use in an atomic bomb, but now he considered another option. If the columns at the Philadelphia plant were operated in parallel instead of in series, then it might produce 12kg per day of uranium enriched to 1 percent. This could be valuable because an electromagnetic <b>enrichment</b> <b>process</b> that could produce one gram of uranium enriched to 40 percent uranium-235 from natural uranium, could produce two grams per day of uranium enriched to 80 percent uranium-235 if the feed was enriched to 1.4 percent uranium-235, double the 0.7 percent of natural uranium.
