5|$|The lack of patrolling by MacGregor's troops {{allowed the}} Spanish to march {{straight}} into Porto Bello early on 30 April 1819. MacGregor {{was still in}} bed when the Spaniards found his riflemen <b>drilling</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> main square and opened fire. Awoken by the noise, MacGregor threw his bed and blankets from the window onto the beach below and jumped out after them, then attempted to paddle out to his ships on a log. He passed out and would probably have drowned {{had he not been}} picked up and brought aboard the Hero by one of his naval officers. MacGregor would claim that on regaining consciousness he immediately raised his standard over the Hero, then despatched runners to Rafter ordering him not to surrender. The version of events favoured by Sinclair is that Rafter received orders to this effect only after he had himself contacted MacGregor on the Hero. Rafter, in the fort with 200 men, kept up a steady barrage and waited for his commander to fire on the royalists from the ships—but to the colonel's astonishment MacGregor instead ordered his fleet to turn about and made for the high seas. Abandoned, Colonel Rafter and the remnants of MacGregor's army {{had no choice but to}} surrender; most of the surviving officers and troops entered miserable existences in captivity. Rafter was ultimately shot with 11 other officers for conspiring to escape.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The graphite-like carbon (GLC) coating was {{deposited}} onto {{high-speed steel}} (HSS) twist drills by magnetron sputter ion plating technique. The drilling tests {{were performed on}} the ferrous metal under dry cutting conditions. By the analysis and comparison of the flank wear and the drilling forces on drills, the cutting performance of GLC coated HSS tools was researched. The results show that GLC coating with high hardness and low friction coefficient, due to its good adhesion and match with HSS substrate, can significantly improve the cutting performance of HSS twist drills, prolong the tool life, decrease <b>the</b> <b>drilling</b> forces <b>in</b> <b>drilling</b> <b>the</b> ferrous metal. And its cutting performance is better than <b>the</b> hard coated <b>drills</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lower speed, but its thermal stability is inferior to <b>the</b> hard coated <b>drills</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> higher speed...|$|R
25|$|The first {{offshore}} wells <b>drilled</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Beaufort used artificial islands as drilling platforms, {{but this}} was a winter drilling system, and was only practical in shallow water. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> mid-1970s, the introduction of a fleet of reinforced drillships extended the drilling season to include the 90 to 120 ice-free days of summer. This also enabled <b>the</b> industry to <b>drill</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> deeper waters of the Beaufort Sea. By the mid-1980s, variations on artificial island and drilling vessel technologies had extended both the drilling season and the depth of water at which the industry could operate. They had also reduced exploration costs.|$|R

Advocating increased regulation of futures markets and windfall profits taxes on oil profits, Cantwell has drawn scathing criticism from the Wall Street Journal. In December 2005, Cantwell scored what many perceived as one of the strongest victories of her first term when she blocked Alaska senator Ted Stevens' efforts to allow <b>drilling</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Stevens attached the measure to a bill that provided money for defense spending and Hurricane Katrina recovery efforts. Cantwell managed to round up the votes of 41 Democrats and 2 Republicans, enough to block a final vote. Stevens removed the ANWR drilling measure from the larger bill, but promised to bring the matter up at a later date.|$|E
