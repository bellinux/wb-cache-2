5|$|Dark {{matter is}} the matter <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> that cannot be seen. Because of the {{gravitational}} effect it exerts on stars and galaxies, scientists know that approximately 80% of the matter <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> is dark matter.

5|$|There are {{dynamical}} forces {{acting on}} the particles <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> which affect the expansion rate. Before 1998, {{it was expected that}} the rate of increase of the Hubble Constant would be decreasing as time went on due to the influence of gravitational interactions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Universe,</b> and thus there is an additional observable quantity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> called the deceleration parameter which cosmologists expected to be directly related to the matter density of the Universe. In 1998, the deceleration parameter was measured by two different groups to be consistent with −1 but not zero, which implied that the present-day rate of increase of the Hubble Constant is increasing over time.|$|E

5|$|During the 1970s and the 1980s, various {{observations}} {{showed that}} there is not sufficient visible matter <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> to account for the apparent strength of gravitational forces within and between galaxies. This led to the idea that up to 90% of the matter <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> is dark matter that does not emit light or interact with normal baryonic matter. In addition, the assumption that the universe is mostly normal matter led to predictions that were strongly inconsistent with observations. In particular, the universe today is far more lumpy and contains far less deuterium than can be accounted for without dark matter. While dark matter has always been controversial, it is inferred by various observations: the anisotropies in the CMB, galaxy cluster velocity dispersions, large-scale structure distributions, gravitational lensing studies, and X-ray measurements of galaxy clusters.|$|E
5|$|Further {{observational}} improvements led to {{the realization}} that our Solar System is located in the Milky Way galaxy, which is one of many galaxies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Universe.</b> It is assumed that galaxies are distributed uniformly and the same in all directions, meaning that the Universe has neither an edge nor a center. Discoveries in the early 20th century have suggested that the Universe had a beginning and that it is expanding at an increasing rate. The majority of mass <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> appears to exist in an unknown form called dark matter.|$|E
5|$|Heisenberg's {{uncertainty}} principle predicts {{that during the}} inflationary phase there would be quantum thermal fluctuations, which would be magnified to cosmic scale. These fluctuations serve as the seeds of all current structure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe.</b> Inflation predicts that the primordial fluctuations are nearly scale invariant and Gaussian, which has been accurately confirmed by measurements of the CMB.|$|E
40|$|The two-world {{background}} of the Special Theory of Relativity started in part one {{of this article is}} continued in this second part. Four-dimensional inversion is shown to be a special Lorentz transformation that transforms the positive spacetime coordinates of a frame of reference <b>in</b> <b>the</b> positive <b>universe</b> into <b>the</b> negative spacetime coordinates of the symmetry-partner frame of reference <b>in</b> <b>the</b> negative <b>universe</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> two-world picture, contrary to the conclusion that four-dimensional inversion is impossible as actual trans- formation of the coordinates of a frame of reference <b>in</b> <b>the</b> existing one-world picture. By starting with the negative spacetime dimensions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> negative <b>universe</b> derived <b>in</b> part one, <b>the</b> signs of mass and other physical parameters and physical constants <b>in</b> <b>the</b> negative <b>universe</b> are derived by application of the symmetry of laws between the pos- itive and negative <b>universes.</b> <b>The</b> invariance of natural laws <b>in</b> <b>the</b> negative <b>universe</b> is demonstrated. <b>The</b> derived negative sign of mass <b>in</b> <b>the</b> negative <b>universe</b> is a conclu- sion of over a century-old effort towards the development of the concept of negative mass in physics...|$|R

5|$|Most galaxies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> are gravitationally {{bound to}} a number of other galaxies.

If there is insufficient kinetic energy, however, the group may evolve into a smaller number of galaxies through mergers.|$|E
