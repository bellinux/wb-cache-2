25|$|One of {{the oldest}} types of filters, the undergravel filters consist of a porous plate which is placed beneath the gravel {{on the base of}} the {{aquarium}} and one, or more, uplift tubes. Historically, undergravel filters have been driven via air displacement. Air stones are placed at the base of uplift tubes which force water out of the uplift tube creating negative pressure beneath the undergravel <b>filter</b> <b>plate</b> (also called the plenum). Water then percolates down through the gravel which itself is the filtration material. Greater flow rate of water through the gravel can be achieved via the use of water pump rather than air displacement.|$|E

Grazing experiments combined with image analysis con-firmed the efficient grazing of B. longirostris on natural bacteria with cell lengths equal to or larger than the intersetular distances of the gnathobasic <b>filter</b> <b>plates.</b> During the experiments, the animals minimized the average cell length of the bacterioplankton assemblages from 0. 77 - 0. 96 u. m to 0. 55 - 0. 68 (xm, corresponding to the mean of the filter mesh size on the fine gnathobasic <b>filter</b> <b>plates</b> of the experimental populations.

5000|$|A Lyot filter is {{made from}} one or more {{birefringent}} plates (usually quartz), with (in multi-plate filters) each plate being half {{the thickness of the}} previous one. Because the plates are birefringent, the ordinary and extraordinary polarization components of a light beam experience a different refractive index and thus have a different phase velocity. Therefore, the polarization state of light with an arbitrary wavelength will in general be modified after a passage through the <b>filter</b> <b>plate,</b> and this causes a loss of optical power in a subsequent polarizer. For certain wavelengths, however, the optical path length difference is an integer multiple of the wavelength, so that the losses are very small. By rotating the plates, one can shift the wavelengths of the transmission peaks.|$|E
50|$|A vacuum {{ceramic filter}} is {{designed}} to separate liquids from solids for dewatering purposes. The device consists of a rotator, slurry tank, ceramic <b>filter</b> <b>plate,</b> distributor, discharge scraper, cleaning device, frame, agitating device, pipe system, vacuum system, automatic acid dosing system, automatic lubricating system, valve and discharge chute. The operation and construction principle of vacuum ceramic filter resemble those of a conventional disc filter, but the filter medium {{is replaced by a}} finely porous ceramic disc. The disc material is inert, has a long operational life and is resistant to almost all chemicals. Performance can be optimized by taking into account all those factors which affect the overall efficiency of the separation process. Some of the variables affecting the performance of a vacuum ceramic filter include the solid concentration, speed rotation of the disc, slurry level in the feed basin, temperature of the feed slurry, and the pressure during dewatering stages and filter cake formation.|$|E
50|$|In {{keeping with}} its predecessors, the VL7 {{featured}} {{a number of}} innovations. First and foremost (at least from a marketing point of view) was the CVF colour system. This featured neither wheels nor twisting filters, but rather a pair of comparatively large, oblong, dichroic filter plates, which could be moved in the vertical and horizontal plane. Each plate carried three basic shades, carefully graduated to merge across the longer, horizontal plane. In the vertical plane, the three basic shades were progressively etched away with lasers, so that they were fully saturated at the top, but completely clear at the bottom. One <b>filter</b> <b>plate</b> carried the colours red, green and blue; while the other carried cyan, magenta and yellow. US Patent Nos. 5825548 and 5969868 describe the concepts behind the CVF colour system. Both patents make mention of a colour wheel and a fixed position wheel {{was included in the}} finished luminaire. This could carry both colours and/or gobos, but was mostly used for the latter. There was also a rotating gobo wheel, with a total of six positions and a strobe shutter, which could run at up to 7.25 Hz.|$|E
50|$|Despite these {{innovations}} and Vari-lite's previous experience, {{development of}} the VL7 was fraught with problems; originally unveiled in 1997, it was not released onto the market until 1998. Behind schedule, over-budget and not fully tested, the initial run of VL7 luminaires immediately fell victim {{to a wide range}} of teething troubles, for which—in most cases—there was no immediate cure. This left technicians only able to replace failed parts, rather than fix the problems which were causing them to fail. For example: a problem in the CVF, which caused the teeth to soften and become stripped from the belts that drove the <b>filter</b> <b>plates,</b> was traced to their drive gears, which had been made of a material with a high Specific Heat Capacity. Once this was understood, the gears could be changed, but not before several hundred belts had already required replacement. Further problems with the CVF caused cracks to appear in the (expensive) <b>filter</b> <b>plates,</b> although this did not always immediately affect the quality of the beam output.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>plate</b> {{and frame}} <b>filter</b> press {{is the most}} {{fundamental}} design, and many now refer it as a [...] "membrane filter plate". This type of filter press consists of many plates and frames assembled alternately with the supports {{of a pair of}} rails. The presence of a centrifuge pump ensures the remaining suspended solids do not settle in the system, and its main function is to deliver the suspension into each of the separating chambers in the <b>plate</b> and frame <b>filter.</b> For each of the individual separating chambers, there is one hollow filter frame separated from two <b>filter</b> <b>plates</b> by <b>filter</b> cloths. The introduced slurry flows through a port in each individual frame, and the filter cakes are accumulated in each hollow frame. As the filter cake becomes thicker, the filter resistance increases as well. So when the separating chamber is full, the filtration process is stopped as the optimum pressure difference is reached. The filtrate that passes through filter cloth is collected through collection pipes and stored in the filter tank. Filter cake (suspended solid) accumulation occurs at the hollow plate frame, then being separated at the <b>filter</b> <b>plates</b> by pulling the <b>plate</b> and frame <b>filter</b> press apart. The cakes then fall off from those plates and are discharged to the final collection point.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In most cases, {{recycled}} plastics include lots of impurities {{that can}} not be separated in operation steps of separation and washing.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we perform direct {{numerical}} simulation (DNS) {{on the problem of}} fluid flow through a <b>filter</b> <b>plate</b> backed by a packed bed of spheres, resembling a cake layer on top of a membrane. For both the complete problem, and its single components (the <b>filter</b> <b>plate</b> and a bed of spheres of finite height) we have observed three flow regimes, depending on the Reynolds number. In each regime the flow resistance is showing a different scaling with the Reynolds number. In the Stokes flow regime the total flow resistance can be decomposed in linear independent components. The interior flows inside the filter holes and inside the packed bed follow the same correlations as hold for the single component. However, at the transition zone between <b>filter</b> <b>plate</b> and packed bed, there is a diverging flow in the first row of the packed bed, whose contribution in the flow resistance scales with the fractional hole to the power − 1. 5. Similar scaling exponent has been found earlier for the viscous-inertial regime with Reynolds numbers larger than 10, which has been modelled using the porous medium approach. Our findings suggest that also in the Stokes flow and the weakly flow regime the problem can also be solved with the same porous medium approach using the Navier-Stokes equation having Darcy–Brinkman terms incorporated. This investigation provides a good basis for developing more accurate analytical models for the flow resistance of membrane filters with a cake layer on top. </p...|$|E
40|$|The Glutathione-S-Transferase (GST) “pulldown ” assay {{has been}} used {{extensively}} to assay protein interactions in vitro. This methodology has been especially useful for investigating the interactions of nuclear hormone receptors {{with a wide variety}} of their interacting partners and coregulatory proteins. Unfortunately, the original GST-pulldown technique relies on multiple binding, washing and elution steps performed in individual microfuge tubes, and requires repeated centrifugation, aspiration, and suspension steps. This type of batch processing creates a significant liquid handling bottleneck, limiting the number of sample points that can be incorporated into one experiment and producing inherently less efficient washing and elution than would a flow-through methodology.
