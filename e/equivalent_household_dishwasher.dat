50|$|Brine is an {{auxiliary}} agent in water softening and water purification systems involving ion exchange technology. The most common example are <b>household</b> <b>dishwashers,</b> utilizing natrium chloride {{in form of}} dishwasher salt. Brine {{is not involved in}} the purification process itself, but used for regeneration of ion-exchange resin on cyclical basis. The water being treated flows through the resin container until the resin is considered exhausted and water is purified to a desired level. Resin is then regenerated by sequentially backwashing the resin bed to remove accumulated solids, flushing removed ions from the resin with a concentrated solution of replacement ions, and rinsing the flushing solution from the resin. After treatment, ion-exchange resin beads saturated with calcium and magnesium ions from the treated water, are regenerated by soaking in brine containing 6-12% NaCl. The sodium ions from brine replace the calcium and magnesium ions on the beads.|$|R

40|$|According to Kakwani and Lambert (1998), an {{equitable}} income tax should respect three axioms {{related to each}} taxpayer’s tax liability, average tax rate and post-tax income: whenever taxation determines unequal tax treatments among equals or modifies pre-tax ordering, it influences the potential vertical effect of the tax through three types of inequity. Following the authors’ measurement system, we investigate changes in axiom violations due to the 2007 Italian personal income tax reform, that introduced {{significant changes in the}} tax structure. Our microsimulation model uses as input data those provided by the Bank of Italy in its Survey on Households Income and Wealth in the year 2006; estimates of the distribution of taxpayers are very close to the Ministry of Finance official statistics. The analysis considers both the individual and <b>equivalent</b> <b>household</b> gross income distribution and evaluates the decomposition with and without surtaxes. Main findings suggest that both in the 2006 and 2007 tax system most of the overall violations concern the axiom demanding the average tax rate to be a non decreasing function with respect to the gross income; the axiom requiring richer taxpayers to pay higher tax liabilities than poorer ones and the axiom requiring the tax to do not introduce re-rankings in the pre-tax income order present minor violations. The 2007 reform enhances both the potential redistributive effect, that is the one that could be obtained without axiom violations, and the axiom violations: the net result is a small positive variation of the actual redistributive effect. These phenomena appear more relevant for taxpayers than those for <b>equivalent</b> <b>households.</b> For what concerns taxpayers, the 2007 reform has modified also the composition of the three axiom violations, that remains almost the same whenever <b>equivalent</b> <b>households</b> are considered. Finally, focusing on each decile of the income distribution, regressivities are concentrated in the bottom five deciles of the income distribution both for taxpayers and <b>equivalent</b> <b>households.</b> Personal Income Tax, Redistributive Effect, Horizontal Inequity, Reranking, Microsimulation Models...|$|R

30|$|Before {{preparing}} {{coffee in}} the pots, the aluminum content of the coffee itself was determined. To this end, 1.5  kg ground coffee (3  ×  0.5  kg packets) {{was placed in a}} dry plastic tray that had been rinsed with tap water. The ground coffee was then stirred to homogeneity with a plastic spoon that had also been rinsed with tap water and dried. Care was taken when purchasing the coffee to make certain that all packets had the same batch number. After stirring, three samples of this coffee were removed to be used for determination of aluminum content of the coffee itself. All necessary laboratory equipment was rinsed with tap water before use in order to remove any residual aluminum contamination. Tap water was also used for preparation of the coffee. Thirty liters of tap water were stored in a PE canister with outlet tap that had previously been rinsed with tap water. Coffee was prepared in the aluminum moka pots in exactly the same manner as in the stainless steel pots: 12 -g portions of ground coffee were measured out with an accuracy of two decimal places into the strainer basket of the moka pot. The 150  mL water for brewing was drawn from the canister mentioned above through the outlet tap, measured in a graduated cylinder, and poured into the bottom chamber of the coffee maker. Coffee was prepared a total of six times in a row per moka pot. The brewing time was 7  min for all moka pots heated on an electric plate with a temperature of 270  °C. After brewing was complete, the coffee was left in the collecting chamber of the pots for 5  min before transfer to 250 -mL sample bottles for subsequent analysis. Allowing the coffee to stand before transfer served to let any particulate coffee to settle in the finished drink. Of the original 150  mL, aliquots of 100  mL were poured through a funnel into the sample bottles. This method assured that no residual coffee particles would find their way into the samples. The remaining {{coffee in the}} collection chambers was disposed of and the complete moka pots were rinsed three times each by shaking for 30  s. After the 5 th brewing cycle, the moka pots were washed in a standard <b>household</b> <b>dishwasher</b> for 22  min at 50  °C (normal wash cycle with standard <b>household</b> <b>dishwasher</b> detergent tablets). This treatment is specifically not recommended by the manufacturers of the pots and serves as a worst-case condition. Before the pots were reused, they were also rinsed three times each in tap water by shaking for 30  s in order to remove any residue from the dishwasher detergents and to assure that the conditions were the same as for the other brewing cycles.|$|R

40|$|AbstractMotion {{of water}} inside a <b>household</b> <b>dishwasher</b> has been characterised via Positron Emission Particle Tracking (PEPT). The {{technique}} enables the visualisation {{of the motion}} of a radioactive tracer in three-dimensional and opaque systems. Results showed a periodic sequence of the water over time, encompassing the following steps: movement inside internal equipment and spray arm, ejection via jets, impact over walls and crockery, downfall (either over walls, crockery or free falling) and recirculation of the bulk water {{from the bottom of}} the dishwasher. This sequence was shown to occur within a few seconds and the highest velocities, and therefore, the highest kinetic energies, were found upon ejection. Jet paths were observed to follow a straight line. Increased pump speeds increased velocity ejection profiles, but the effect over the downfall step was negligible. In fully loaded dishwasher (with crockery), the tracer moved slower in these high packing zones, showing low velocity profile areas with higher residence times. Other stagnant areas were found at the edges of the bulk of water remaining at the bottom of the dishwasher. Use of detergent did not seem to affect water motion. Finally, data generated via CFD was compared with equivalent PEPT data, showing good agreement for the spray arm and ejection steps but disagreement in the free falling step. The divergences in the results can be explained by a combination of PEPT data processing and CFD model constraints.

40|$|In this study, {{the shape}} {{behavior}} of complete dentures in <b>household</b> <b>dishwashers</b> was investigated. The ulterior motive {{was to establish}} an improved and simpler method of cleaning dentures in geriatric institutions. For {{the investigation of the}} shape behavior, a method involving digital 3 -D measuring technique was used, which was modified to meet the specific requirements. It was shown that the digital 3 -D measuring technique is suitable for the evaluation of the shape behavior of complete dentures. For the entire test assembly, the average deviation was ± 19 µm. For the investigation, stylized maxillary dentures without tooth arch were fabricated of heat-curing and cold-curing polymer. All denture bases were stored in tap water at 37 °C for three weeks. After that, some dentures of each material group were washed in a common <b>household</b> <b>dishwasher</b> twice a day, in addition to the water storage. The dentures were subject to a total of 81 dishwasher cleaning cycles. Digital data records were collected by means of optical recording of the internal denture aspects prior to the immersion in water and after 23, 26, 40, and 62 days. Additionally, the weight of the dentures was determined each time. The first data record of each denture was used for comparison with each of the corresponding subsequent data records by means of a computer program. The resulting color-coded difference images were evaluated visually and by means of histograms. To asses the movements of the different surface areas, separate histograms were created for four areas of the difference images. The mean deviations of these areas were then statistically evaluated and compared. The movements of the individual elements of the internal aspects were recorded by means of sections of the difference images and vector representation. The dentures that were only stored in water were compared to those that underwent dishwasher cleaning cycles. The dentures stored in water can be considered suitable for incorporation, since the water storage corresponds with the in-vivo situation. The first measurable shape changes occurred on different days in the two material groups, but the changes steadily increased until the last measurement in both material groups. The heat-curing polymer group demonstrated considerably less shape changes than the cold-curing polymer group. In the heat-curing polymer group, {{there was no significant difference}} between the dentures stored in water and those that were subject to additional dishwasher cleaning cycles. As far as the dentures made of cold-curing polymer is concerned, a slightly significant difference between the two subgroups was noticeable. The dentures cleaned in the dishwasher showed more shape changes. This test assembly does not permit a comparison with other studies on shape behavior in general, or on dimensional behavior in particular. The observation that the denture bases extend, however, and the tendency of individual surfaces to change direction correspond with the results of existing studies. The weight development is also congruent with the results of other studies on water absorption. The largest weight increase occurs during the first three weeks. The test samples that were subject to water storage alone continued to absorb water, if only little, until the end of the observation period. The weight of the dentures subject to dishwasher cleaning cycles considerably decreased between the 26 th day and the end of the test, with the dentures made of heat-curing polymer losing more weight than those made of cold-curing polymer. In order to make a reliable statement on the dishwasher stability of dentures, tests involving more than 81 cleaning cycles would have to be conducted. The weight loss indicates that the dentures desiccate. Consequently, changes in flexural strength are to be expected, which should also be investigated...|$|R
