5|$|As {{with other}} American {{self-propelled}} guns produced {{during the early}} World War II period, the prototype was assembled and tested at the Aberdeen Proving Ground. The M2 recoil mechanism {{and other parts of}} the M2 howitzer carriage were used in the vehicle mounting. After several tests, the gun carriage proved fragile on bumpy terrain. The problem was corrected by reinforcing the frame, and redesigning the howitzer mount. <b>Demountable</b> headlights were recommended because of the muzzle blast, although they were not available for early production models. Early models had no shield for the howitzer either, but a foldable shield was added during testing. The gun faced forward, like many other half-track models. The total traverse was 40 degrees and the elevation was from −5 to +35 degrees. The armored windshield cover was remounted so it could fold onto the hood. After further testing, it was accepted for production.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} blockhouses, <b>demountable</b> turrets and {{observation}} points were scattered in the interval {{spaces in the}} sub-sector between the river Nied and the Casernement de Téting..|$|E
25|$|On 17 May 1917 Benjamin Franklin Fitch inaugurated {{exploitation}} of the experimental installation for transfer of the containers called the <b>demountable</b> bodies based on his own design in Cincinnati, Ohio in US. Later in 1919, his system was extended to over 200 containers serving 21 railway stations with 14 freight trucks.|$|E
25|$|D Block {{is the new}} {{languages}} block {{which was}} completed {{in the spring of}} 2013, constructed from the <b>demountables</b> previously used in V block. The previous D block stood on the same site, constructed from a set of <b>demountables</b> demolished prior to construction of the new block.|$|R

25|$|In 1982 access {{was further}} {{restricted}} by railings and a <b>demountable</b> gate. They {{were replaced by}} black steel gates in 1989. The increase in security was due {{to an increase in}} violence, particularly by the IRA during The Troubles. The Thatcher ministry was particularly moved to increase security after the 1979 assassination of Lord Mountbatten.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{concerns}} about the original dam capacity to withstand floods and a projected increase in demand for water by the agricultural industry in the region, Wyangala Dam was upgraded and enlarged from 1961 to 1971. Housing for the workers and their families was provided in temporary <b>demountable</b> dwellings within the village. At this time and also during the 1935 dam build, utilitarian construction prevailed, giving Wyangala no dwellings of historical note.|$|E
25|$|These parking {{structures}} are generally <b>demountable</b> {{and can be}} relocated so to avoid to make the choice of converting a surface to parking area irrevocably. They are conceived as temporary parking facilities for temporary parking demand needs, whenever the parking demand can be managed dynamically and easily integrated into the planning of urban infrastructures. A number of parking decks have been demounted after a few years, to make room {{to the development of}} permanent, multi-storey parking structures, and relocated to respond to local parking demand.|$|E
50|$|Several {{years later}} another two-floored C-shaped {{extension}} was added containing more classrooms and several art rooms closing off the original C-shape creating the Quad later {{on one side}} of the quad was turned into a large staff room. There was a single storey industrial technology wing on the edge of the second C. Several <b>demountables</b> were located on the exterior side of the second C. In 1987, a Chapel was built in the school grounds which still stands today. There are also 6 tennis courts which stand between the netball courts and the now-relocated <b>demountables.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Art rooms {{moved back}} {{across to the}} main site and <b>demountables</b> across the road were removed. Extensive {{building}} work was completed in late 2003 and the College now has a multi-purpose hall, Mercy Centre, new music and practice rooms.|$|R
50|$|Cecil Hills Public School {{opened in}} 2003. Uniform is navy blue and white, with navy blue hats. The school is fairly large, with brick {{classrooms}} and <b>demountables.</b> The playground has two basketball/netball courts, a soccer/football field and areas for handball.|$|R
25|$|Flooding of October 2014 {{was less}} than a 1–5 flood with a flow of 300m3/s. As part of a media {{exercise}} by the OPW the barrier were all put up. The flood defence consists of <b>demountable</b> barriers, walls and earth banks. Flooding occurred at the Gashouse Bridge, Coleville Road, Davis Road, the Quays and the Old Bridge area before the flood defences. Clonmel is not tidal as the tide turns above the Miloko chocolate crumb factory in Carrick-on-Suir. Flood waters spill onto the land above Miloko on the County Waterford side of the river.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, {{the general}} plan for {{to repair the}} {{structure}} was initiated in nine parts of the structure, under direction of DREMS. The following year, a tender by DGMEN was issued to complete repairs in the castle. Work from this project went to benefit {{the walls and the}} path towards the bartizan over the Vila Gate, and was extended to the tower. Recuperation of the hearth and guardhouse was also included in these tasks. A similar tender was issued in March 2004 by the municipal government to improve the site's illumination, that included improvements to electrical system and telephone network, in addition to the construction of a <b>demountable</b> stage. This was later expanded between 2005 and 2006, under the pretext of program of ant-vandalism, the public illumination was improved.|$|E
500|$|In 1972, {{plans were}} {{advanced}} {{to build a}} large new concrete-and-fiberglass band shell atop a new underground parking garage, but community groups defended the Ward restrictions. A compromise produced the inexpensive, staff-designed, <b>demountable</b> band shell at Butler Field, which opened in 1978. The [...] "semi-permanent" [...] designation skirted the Ward prohibitions and the new structure cost only $3 million ($ million).|$|E
25|$|The {{school has}} a ceiling of 195 {{enrolments}} in 2007 as compared to numbers close to 70 in 1994. With this expansion has come the need to install <b>demountables.</b> These detract from the historic value of the site and although meant as a temporary measure there is currently no plans {{in place for a}} new building.|$|R
50|$|Genesis Christian College {{opened in}} 1991 with thirty-five Year 1 to 7 {{students}} who were temporarily schooled in two <b>demountables</b> until {{they were able to}} move into the newly built church. Mr Bob Van Veen, the founding Principal and Miss Jane Nyhouse (now Mrs Eyles) were the first teachers. Over the ensuing years, the Primary School was built.|$|R

500|$|The {{original}} design used a gun shield {{taken from the}} T44 57 mm Gun Motor Carriage, but after the first tests were complete, a new shield was designed with face-hardened steel 5/8 inch thick {{on the front and}} 1/4 inch thick on the sides and top. The shield extended over the crew with a relatively low silhouette of only [...] Experience with the M3 Gun Motor Carriage in the Philippines Campaign, resulted in <b>demountable</b> headlights being used. The T48 was accepted for production in 1942.|$|E
500|$|Also {{based on}} the Panzer IV chassis was the Sturmpanzer IV [...] infantry-support {{self-propelled}} gun. These vehicles were primarily issued to four Sturmpanzer units (Numbers 216, 217, 218 and 219) and used {{during the battle of}} Kursk and in Italy in 1943. Two separate versions of the Sturmpanzer IV existed, one without a machine gun in the mantlet and one with a machine gun mounted on the mantlet of the casemate. Furthermore, a [...] artillery gun was mounted in an experimental <b>demountable</b> turret on a Panzer IV chassis. This variant was called the Heuschrecke ("Grasshopper"). Another 105mm artillery/anti-tank prototype was the 10.5 cm K (gp.Sfl.) nicknamed Dicker Max.|$|E
500|$|The roof weighs 6000 tonnes {{and is able}} {{to support}} {{suspended}} aircraft weighing up to 10 tonnes. A glass wall, <b>demountable</b> to permit aircraft to be rearranged, allows in daylight, thereby reducing lighting costs and enabling the aircraft to be seen from the outside of the building. It also allows visitors inside the museum to watch aircraft landing or taking off. From a visitor's perspective, the pedestrian entrance leads to a mezzanine floor level with the cockpit of the museum's B-52, while the lack of supporting columns allows aircraft to hang from the ceiling. Heavier aircraft stand {{on the floor of the}} building, which covers [...] Construction began with the building of abutments in October 1995 and the roof was completed in September 1996. The building won the 1998 Stirling Prize for Foster and Partners and was described by the judges as [...] "a great big, clear span hangar of a building...dramatic, awe-inspiring, an object of beauty...simple yet replete with imagery." ...|$|E
25|$|In 2004, a V {{block was}} created. It {{is thought that}} this refers {{to the concept of}} the block being a 'village' community. The V block was built to house the English department, whilst we awaited the new build block. There was a small fire in one of the old D block <b>demountables,</b> but the fire itself did not {{contribute}} to the installation of V block. However, 2 of the 5 buildings still remain which were not touched by the fire. V block housed the school's English department. But is now used as a cafeteria.|$|R

50|$|The school {{first opened}} on 29 January 1974 under {{principal}} R.C.H. (Bob) Everitt, with 400 students in years 7 and 8. Due to bad weather and material shortages, <b>demountables</b> at Dapto High School were used until {{the school was}} completed. On 18 October 1974 they moved to the new site at Robert and Joan Streets. The school first offered Higher School Certificate subjects in 1978. The school's population peaked at 1,164 students in 1983. With changes to demographics {{and the opening of}} other schools in the area, the school population fell to a relatively stable 650 in the late 1990s.|$|R
2500|$|... 2013 {{brought the}} {{introduction}} of four new <b>demountable</b> classrooms located behind the current Tolentine wing. The four classrooms can be accessed through Tolentine Park and contain smart boards and air conditioning for an enhanced learning environment.|$|E
2500|$|The {{traditional}} beverage is the [...] "erva mate". The Chalet of the XV de Novembro Plaza {{is located}} along the Glênio Peres Square, {{it is one}} of the most traditional bar-draught beer-restaurants in the city, where the last [...] "lambe-lambe" [...] photographs of the region work. [...] "Lambe-lambes" [...] are photographers who develop pictures outdoor using the oldest method known. In the Bavarian style, with art nouveau traits, the centenary Chalet was built up on a <b>demountable</b> steel structure, keeping its original chandeliers and tiles even nowadays.|$|E
2500|$|Midsummer Place (subsequently rebranded intu Milton Keynes) is {{effectively}} a southwards {{extension of the}} centre but is owned and operated independently. (It was a planning requirement {{that it should not}} physically attach to the original building, so there is an approximately one metre gap between them). Midsummer Place was designed by GMW Architects of London and opened in 2000. This extension is built across (and thus closing) Midsummer Boulevard using a (covered and enclosed) plaza that contains some <b>demountable</b> kiosks: it is a further planning requirement that the Boulevard should technically be capable of being reopened (remain free of structures) at some future date. The new centre was constructed in part around an existing oak tree that briefly survived being built around (at a [...] higher level) until it succumbed to 'technical drowning' (undrained flooding) from about 2008.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] central school opened 3 April 1922 {{for boys}} and girls on the site of Cwmgwyn Farm. It was Swansea's first central school, midway between an {{elementary}} and secondary school. [...] The single story buildings were wooden <b>demountables,</b> brought as World War One military surplus from Salisbury Plain. The rooms were arranged in a rectangle, with each linked by an open veranda, and this side could be opened completely in summer. Cloakrooms between rooms gave access to the large central space. The rooms were called 'the cowsheds' by the pupils of other schools. The first head of the girls' school was Clara Neal, resigning around 1925.|$|R
5000|$|In the mid 1960s, {{planning}} had commenced for a {{high school}} to serve the region, {{but it was not}} until 8 July 1970 that Nightcliff High School was officially opened. 300 students, who had been temporarily housed in <b>demountables</b> at Darwin High School, transferred immediately to the new buildings. Following Cyclone Tracy, the new school, which had survived the devastation better than most buildings, was immediately pressed into service as an evacuation centre, then becoming a hostel for workers involved in the temporary repair of essential services.Following Cyclone Tracy, students of the school were temporarily enrolled to attend Casuarina High School situated approximately 8 kilometres away. The school was reopened in 1975 with classes starting at 7am to avoid heat as the air conditioning was not functioning.|$|R
50|$|The suburb's primary school, Monkland State School, {{first opened}} on 24 September 1884 with 74 pupils in attendance. A public meeting in 1880 called for its establishment, {{due to the}} number of {{families}} in the district and the long walk to the One Mile State School which had been established in 1869. The school was struck by a tornado in 1932, and a new building had to be constructed. An extensive reconstruction occurred in 1958, and <b>demountables</b> were added in the 1970s and 1980s. The original timber-frame headmaster's residence, designed by architect Robert Ferguson, is largely fenced off from the school and has been heritage listed by the Queensland Government. Today, the school has 134 students (2008) and offers an instrumental music program. The school has a feeder arrangement with Gympie State High School which is located about two kilometres away.|$|R
2500|$|The {{rules of}} the 1924 Lympne trials were revised to allow more {{practical}} aircraft, rather than motor-gliders. [...] Parnall therefore built a two-seat version, the Pixie IIIA with its fuselage extended by 3ft 2 in (965mm) to allow a second cockpit, one now above each wing spar and the wing span extended to 32ft 5 in. [...] A <b>demountable</b> upper wing, attached by N form interplane struts and several cabane struts and of markedly smaller span and deep central chord allowed the IIIA to be flown either as monoplane or biplane. Its undercarriage legs now had rubber compression shock absorbers. [...] Two were built, one with a 32hp Bristol Cherub III engine {{and the other with}} a 35hp Blackburne Thrush. [...] After the trials and in the following year, the Thrush was replaced with a 1,100 cc Anzani. [...] In 1926, both IIIAs were converted to permanent monoplane configuration as Pixie IIIs, both now with the Bristol engine.|$|E
60|$|Irene wheeled {{herself out}} and joined Uncle Peter and Mary Louise in {{watching}} the boy attach the tires, which were on <b>demountable</b> rims and soon put in place.

60|$|He peeped {{with equal}} earnestness at the socks and the shirts of the {{traveling}} men. Socks {{had been to}} him not {{an article of faith}} but a detail of economy. His attitude to socks had lacked in reverence and technique. He had not perceived that socks may be as sound a symbol of culture as the 'cello or even <b>demountable</b> rims. He had been able to think with respect of ties and damp piqué collars secured by gold safety-pins; and to the belted fawn overcoat that the St. Klopstock banker's son had brought back from St. Paul, he had given jealous attention. But now he graduated into differential socks.|$|E
5000|$|In about 1994 a two-storey wing {{was added}} to the north-west side of the main building, {{extending}} beyond the Chapel and creating the western boundary of what is now known as the [...] "Senior Area" [...] (bounded on the south by the art block, on the east by the bus bay, on the north by the admin building, with the Chapel in the middle). The <b>demountable's</b> were also removed and now serve as storage sheds adjacent the tennis courts. A large separate two storey building was constructed on the West side of the Quad which house the new library and food technology rooms. To the south of that building, the original four-lab science block stands, including the renovated staffroom. Slightly further south, the newer, two lab science block stands, bounded by the staff carpark (E), the old labs (N), the tarmac (W) and adjacent houses (S).|$|R
40|$|In this essay, I {{focus on}} {{seemingly}} benign and innocuous civil sites, spaces and technologies – such as hotel rooms, <b>demountables</b> and shipping containers – and proceed to argue that, once these civil sites and technologies are situated within geopolitical relations of biopower, they become {{instrumental in the}} production of refugee trauma and death. I term the trauma and violence that refugees experience in the context of everyday civilian life ‘vernacular violence’. In the process of examining how hotel rooms and containers are instrumentalised by western governments into prisons, I question the line of demarcation between the civil and the penal. I argue that what is in fact operative is a type of biopolitical power predicated on the exercise of ‘civil penality’. In {{the latter part of the}} essay, I track the manner in which civil penality and vernacular violence inscribe, for refugees from the Global South, such technologies of civil transport as planes, ships and trucks. Situated within violently unequal relations of geopolitical power, these civil technologies of transport generate fundamentally disjunctive ontologies that interrogate the line of demarcation between ‘letting-die’ and ‘making-die’. 17 page(s...|$|R
40|$|A {{visit to}} Australia’s most remote outpost {{highlights}} {{the failure of}} the federal government to lead a rational debate, writes Klaus Neumann in Inside StoryCHRISTMAS ISLAND is a weird place to begin with: a big rock in the Indian Ocean, much of it covered in high grade phosphate, inhabited by about 100 million red crabs. The island’s peculiarities are not limited to its natural environment. People travelling to this Australian outpost on a direct flight from Perth depart from the international terminal and go through customs {{at both ends of the}} journey. But surely the strangest feature of Christmas Island, a landmark that reminded me of an oversized version of the new elephant enclosure at the Melbourne Zoo, is a state-of-the-art, high security immigration detention centre, surrounded by sea on three sides and a national park on the fourth. In fact Christmas Island currently houses four detention facilities: the North West Point immigration detention centre, built by the Howard government for a staggering $ 400 million; Lilac and Aqua compounds, a comparatively cheap extension of the North West Point facility built by the Rudd government; the so-called Construction Camp at Phosphate Hill for families, unaccompanied minors and Indonesian crew, which makes use of the dongas used to house the workers building the North West Point centre; and another, smaller detention facility adjacent to the Construction Camp with <b>demountables</b> and tents for single men. The Department of Immigration and Citizenship currently holds more than 2400 detainees on the island. As far as I could tell after guided tours of all four detention centres and meetings with detainees in three of the four facilities, the department is doing a good job on Christmas Island. There did not seem to be any tangible tension between detainees, on the [...] . Read the full article Photo: Klaus Neuman...|$|R
