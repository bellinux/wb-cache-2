40|$|This paper {{examines}} national Internet {{control from}} a policy regime perspective. The mechanisms through which governments {{attempt to control}} the Internet may be developed and implemented by different institutions and agencies, or fall outside of a formal regulatory structure entirely. As such, {{the totality of the}} institutions and practices of national Internet control is better conceptualized not as a regulatory regime, but as a <b>control</b> <b>regime.</b> After a survey of the critical policy and control dimensions, a six-part typology of <b>control</b> <b>regimes</b> is proposed. The purpose of this study and typology is exploratory. With comparative research about Internet <b>control</b> <b>regimes</b> at a relatively early stage, this paper aims to enable the formation of concepts and hypotheses about the interrelationship, or co-presence, of key distinguishing variables in different Internet <b>control</b> <b>regimes...</b>|$|R

In response to these issues, successive UK Governments have introduced sanctions for non-compliant enforcement agents. Despite the fact that these types of sanctions are often discursively linked by immigration authorities to the notion of preventing third parties’ exploitation of irregular migrants, ultimately it is the irregular migrants’ survival which is threatened by the developing <b>control</b> <b>regime...</b>|$|R

As a caveat, we have not yet made a systematic attempt at correlating the criteria and different knowledge representations formalisms and <b>control</b> <b>regimes,</b> although we make some preliminary remarks throughout the paper...|$|R
40|$|This article {{analyses}} why informal labourers working ‘at the margins’ {{of global}} production networks lack ‘structural’ and ‘associational’ power. It {{does so in}} order to better understand potential changes in their material and political conditions, and as part of broader calls to put labour at the centre of development studies. The article focuses on rural-based labourers in south India who work relatively invisibly as agricultural labourers, informal factory workers, and on the construction sites of a ‘global city’ (Bangalore). It deploys a three-way labour <b>control</b> <b>regime</b> framework that encompasses i) the macro-labour <b>control</b> <b>regime,</b> which is ultimately defined by capitalist relations of production, and characterized in India by particularly high levels of informality (precarious and largely unregulated work) and segmentation (due to the fragmentary impact of caste); ii) the local labour <b>control</b> <b>regime,</b> which refers to how class relations in specific places are shaped by patterns of accumulation and work (themselves shaped by differences in agro-ecology, irrigation, and remoteness from non-agricultural labour markets), distributions of classes and castes, and the uneven presence of the state; and iii) the labour process, which is increasingly marked by forms of ‘remote control’ marshalled by labour intermediaries. Debate on the macro-labour <b>control</b> <b>regime</b> and on the labour process is well established, but little has been said about local labour <b>control</b> <b>regimes,</b> which are newly defined here and discussed in terms of differences between ‘wetland/circulation zones’ and ‘dryland/commuting zones’. The article identifies locations where labour has greater potential structural and associational power. Increased worker organisation in these areas could have knock-on effects in more ‘obscure’ sites...|$|R

40|$|This article {{provides}} an empirical {{comparison of the}} level of education spending under three different institutional structures of spending control. From least to most centralized, these are local control of spending with overlapping Jurisdictions, local control with nonoverlapping jurisdictions, and state (or provincial) control. A model of education expenditure determination under each regime is derived and estimated (using Canadian data), and spending levels under the three regimes are simulated and compared. The results indicate that spending behavior differs significantly across regimes and that the institutional structure ofspending control is an important determinant {{of the level of}} education expenditures. The local <b>control</b> <b>regime</b> with nonoverlapping jurisdictions yields the lowest level of total education spending, but the provincial <b>control</b> <b>regime</b> has the lowest operating expenditures. The local <b>control</b> <b>regime</b> with overlapping jurisdictions has the highest level of both total and operating expenditures.

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} {{delineate}} some preliminary factors and working methods that {{could work in}} favour of establishing a workable international export <b>control</b> <b>regime</b> for dual-use goods and technologies. Drawing on the work initiated by various United Nations initiatives and the Wassenaar Agreement, but specifically looking at the European Union export regime model, this working paper asks if and how a similar model could be adopted at the international level. Far from suggesting that the EU regime should of could be adopted on a global basis or that the regime is full-proof, the authors acknowledge that EU regulations are seen as among the most stringent of frameworks on dual-use goods and technologies available. Accordingly, this paper asks what elements of the EU’s <b>control</b> <b>regime</b> could be of international benefit after the ATT negotiations and {{how it could be}} adopted on a more international basis. Indeed, any future ATT control mechanism for dual-use items will have to draw on existing arms transfers and <b>control</b> <b>regimes.</b> It does this through an analysis of the ATT and the current discourse on dual-use goods and technologies in the negotiations, an stocktaking of {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the EU’s export <b>control</b> <b>regime</b> and by asking what elements of the EU’s regime could be utilised for international control mechanisms after a future ATT is negotiated...|$|R

40|$|The {{end of the}} Cold War had {{significantly}} decreased the threat of large scale nuclear war. However, the emergences of new non-state actors have seriously challenged nonproliferation and arms <b>control</b> <b>regime.</b> Arms <b>control</b> and nonproliferation efforts in general during the Cold War successfully prevented nuclear war. In addition although many believe that nonproliferation and strategic arms <b>control</b> <b>regime</b> will fail to prevent the expansion of nuclear states current reality seems to oppose these thoughts. However, process of globalization and destruction of Cold War stability have created environment where the shortfalls of the nonproliferation regime seriously threaten its existence. Inconsistent policies by permanent nuclear powers, like the case of “Indian exception“ {{have proved to be}} dangerous example. Using this as an excuse some states like North Korea and Iran have either abandon the nonproliferation regime (i. e. NPT) or have begun unilateral interpretation of its provisions. Fragility of the nonproliferation regime in the post Cold War era should be also considered in the context of small states interest and the treats by modern terrorism. Therefore the article will first examine the effects of globalization on nonproliferation and arms <b>control</b> <b>regime.</b> Then it will briefly address the effects from unilateralism in the context of nonproliferation and arms <b>control</b> <b>regime.</b> The article will also look in to possibility of Macedonia to become nuclear power and the consequences of such an attempt in the context of modern terrorism. ...|$|R
40|$|Drained peatlands in {{northern}} Europe comprise more than 10 million ha of forestland and thus constitute a considerable production potential in forestry. Much {{of this area}} consists of stands dominated by Scots pine and close to maturity regarding commercial thinning. The trees within these stands typically vary in terms of age, size, and growth rate. The impacts of silvicultural cuttings on these uneven-structured stands are inadequately known. We simulated the impacts of a <b>control</b> <b>regime</b> with no thinnings, and three different thinning regimes, involving different thinning intensities, {{on the development of}} fifteen pine-dominated stands in Finland. The simulations started from the first thinnings and were continued until regeneration maturity. The predicted total yields ranged from 244 to 595 m 3 ha- 1, depending on site and thinning regime. The highest total yields were observed for the <b>control</b> <b>regime</b> in which 18 - 38 % of the yield was, however, predicted to self-thin {{by the end of the}} simulation. Thus, the differences in the yields of merchantable wood were fairly small among the compared regimes. However, the regimes involving thinnings generally needed less time than the <b>control</b> <b>regime</b> to reach regeneration maturity. The mean annual increment of total stem volume was at its highest in the <b>control</b> <b>regime.</b> The highest mean annual increment of merchantable wood was obtained in the regime involving two moderate thinnings, but excluding the most low-productive sites where thinnings did not increase the yield of merchantable wood.

The impact on regime effectiveness of an alternative set of measures, based on proposals by the US government is assessed subsequently. It is concluded that the Protocol would have led to a greater increase in regime effectiveness. The alternative measures either do not lead to rules and procedures for state behaviour that are linked to and thus do not support the norms of the regime, or threaten to lead to an unequal regime strengthening that could lead to polarization among regime members and fragmentation of the overall BTW <b>control</b> <b>regime...</b>|$|R
