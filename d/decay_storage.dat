40|$|Logistical {{simulation}} of {{spent nuclear fuel}} (SNF) management in the U. S. combines storage, transportation and disposal elements to evaluate schedule, cost and other resources needed for all major operations leading to final geologic disposal. Geologic repository reference options are associated with limits on waste package thermal power output at emplacement, {{in order to meet}} limits on peak temperature for certain key engineered and natural barriers. These package power limits are used in logistical simulation software such as CALVIN, as threshold requirements that must be met by means of <b>decay</b> <b>storage</b> or SNF blending in waste packages, before emplacement in a repository. Geologic repository reference options include enclosed modes developed for crystalline rock, clay or shale, and salt. In addition, a further need has been addressed for open modes in which SNF can be emplaced in a repository, then ventilated for decades or longer to remove heat, prior to permanent repository closure. For each open mode disposal concept there are specified durations for surface <b>decay</b> <b>storage</b> (prior to emplacement), repository ventilation, and repository closure operations. This study simulates those steps for several timing cases, and for SNF with three fuel-burnup characteristics, to develop package power limits at which waste packages can be emplaced without exceeding specified temperature limits many years later after permanent closure. The results are presented in the form of correlations that span a range of package power and peak postclosure temperature, for each open-mode disposal concept, and for each timing case. Given a particular temperature limit value, the corresponding package power limit for each case can be selected for use in CALVIN and similar tools...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{mathematical}} model that described {{the relationship between}} cell−count de− cay and storage time in fixed bacterioplankton samples from three Antarctic lakes of differ− ing trophic status was determined after a one−year experiment. Bacterial density was esti− mated by epifluorescence microscopy. Cell count data fitted a negative exponential model in all three cases (p < 0. 00001). However, the slopes of their curves were significantly dif− ferent (p < 0. 01), {{as well as the}} percentage of bacterial loss after a period of two months. This fact might be related to the limnological characteristics of the water bodies, though the individual genetic variability of their bacterioplankton should not be left aside. Original bacterial numbers in the samples could also be a reason of the differences observed in the pattern of decay in cell counts. Thus, applying a general decay function to any sample and assuming the idea that freshwater bacterioplankton samples can be stored for a two month−period before the bacterial counts decay, can lead to an erroneous estimation of bac− terial numbers with direct consequences in ecological investigations.

40|$|We {{estimated}} {{the generation of}} low- and intermediate-level waste (LILW) and high-level waste (HLW) from open and closed nuclear fuel cycles. The closed fuel cycle reflects the development and deployment of fast reactors and pyroprocessing from 2013 to 2100, while the open fuel cycle only considers pressurized water reactors. The closed fuel cycle hardly affects short-term spent fuel management but can save nearly 60 % space of interim storage compared with the open fuel cycle. Compared with the open fuel cycle, the accumulated volume of HLW can be significantly reduced in the closed fuel cycle up to over 95 % in 2100. For this volume reduction, high heat generating fission products should be separated from transuranic waste in pyroprocessing and stored in <b>decay</b> <b>storages</b> for a few hundred years. Mining and milling waste in the closed fuel cycle decreases by about 31 %. In contrast, the closed fuel cycle generates 3. 0 %- 4. 5 % more LILW than the open fuel cycle because fast reactors and pyroprocessing produce more LILW and conversion, enrichment, and fabrication produce less LILW.

40|$|Germany is phasing-out the {{utilization}} of nuclear energy until 2022. Currently, nine light water reactors of originally nineteen are still connected to the grid. All power plants generate high-level nuclear waste like spent uranium or mixed uranium-plutonium dioxide fuel which has to be properly managed. Moreover, vitrified high-level waste containing minor actinides, fission products, and traces of plutonium reprocessing loses produced by reprocessing facilities has to be disposed of. In the paper, the assessments of German spent fuel legacy (heavy metal content) and the nuclide composition of this inventory have been done. The methodology used applies advanced nuclear fuel cycle simulation techniques in order to reproduce {{the operation of the}} German nuclear power plants from 1969 till 2022.

40|$|Conductivity of {{insulating}} materials {{is a key}} parameter to determine how accumulated charge will distribute across the spacecraft and how rapidly charge imbalance will dissipate. Classical ASTM and IEC methods to measure thin film insulator conductivity apply a constant voltage to two electrodes around the sample and measure the resulting current for tens of minutes. However, conductivity is more appropriately measured for spacecraft charging applications as the "decay" of charge deposited {{on the surface of}} an insulator. Charge decay methods expose one side of the insulator in vacuum to sequences of charged particles, light, and plasma, with a metal electrode attached {{to the other side of}} the insulator. Data are obtained by capacitive coupling to measure both the resulting voltage on the open surface and emission of electrons from the exposed surface, as well monitoring currents to the electrode. Instrumentation for both classical and charge <b>storage</b> <b>decay</b> methods has been developed and tested at Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and at Utah State University (USU). Details of the apparatus, test methods and data analysis are given here. The JPL charge <b>storage</b> <b>decay</b> chamber is a first-generation instrument, designed to make detailed measurements on only three to five samples at a time. Because samples must typically be tested for over a month, a second-generation high sample throughput charge <b>storage</b> <b>decay</b> chamber was developed at USU with the capability of testing up to 32 samples simultaneously.

40|$|The recent {{experimental}} determinations {{of a large}} theta_ 13 angle {{have opened}} {{the way to a}} determination of the mass hierarchy and of the CP-violating phase. Experiments based on horn produced (anti-) neutrino conventional beams are presently under development. The event rates are marginal for a definitive search, since they require very intense beams and extremely large detector masses. Zucchelli has proposed a method in which pure (anti-) nu_e beams are generated by the beta-decay of relativistic radio-nuclides stored in a high energy storage ring pointing towards a far away neutrino detector. Since they have a much smaller transverse momentum distribution, the neutrino flux will be much more narrowly concentrated than with a horn. The isomeric doublet Li- 8 (anti-nu_e, tau_ 1 / 2 = 0. 84 s) and B- 8 (nu_e, tau_ 1 / 2 = 0. 77 s) has been studied. Neutrino and antineutrino beams are produced with an average transverse momentum of about 6. 5 MeV/c. Radioactive ions may be generated with a dedicated table-top storage ring to supply a suitable ion source to be accelerated at high energies either at FNAL or at CERN. Ions should then extracted from the accelerator and accumulated in a <b>decay</b> <b>storage</b> ring with a long straight section pointing toward the neutrino detector. A massive detector based on liquid Argon technology is probably offering the best opportunities for such future programme. The present ICARUS LAr-TPC experiment has already collected at LNGS events in the relevant neutrino energy region. They should provide a first evidence for a conclusive experimental study of the competing signals and more generally for the actual feasibility of the beta-beam option in a search of the CP violating phase. Additional data may be provided in the near future with the ICARUS and MicroBooNe neutrino experiments located at a short distance neutrino beam and that will collect a much larger number of neutrino events.

At the genesis of this project, next generation spent fuel reprocessing methods were being developed {{as part of the}} U. S. Department of Energy's Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative. One of these processes was focused on solvent extraction schemes to isolate cesium (Cs) and strontium (Sr) from spent nuclear fuel. Isolating these isotopes for short-term <b>decay</b> <b>storage</b> eases the design requirements for long-term repository disposal; a significant amount of the radiation and decay heat in fission product waste comes from Cs- 137 and Sr- 90. For the purposes of this project, the Fission Product Extraction (FPEX) process is being considered to be the baseline extraction method. The objective of this project was to evaluate the nature and behavior of candidate materials for cesium and strontium immobilization; this will include assessments with minor additions of yttrium, barium, and rubidium in these materials. More specifically, the proposed research achieved the following objectives (as stated in the original proposal) : (1) Synthesize simulated storage ceramics for Cs and Sr using an existing labscale steam reformer at Purdue University. The simulated storage materials will include aluminosilicates, zirconates and other stable ceramics with the potential for high Cs and Sr loading.

40|$|The {{key process}} is the {{observation}} of tiny oscillation mixing between numu and nue related to so far unknown theta 13 amplitude, at distances corresponding to an invariant neutrino flight path around about 2. 0 MeV/km. Zucchelli [12] has proposed the production of very pure neue beams (beta beams), in which relativistic radio-nuclides are stored in a high energy storage ring and decay in a long straight section pointing toward the neutrino detector far away. This method produces ultra pure anti-neue (He- 6) and neue (Ne- 18) with a negligible numu contamination (10 - 5). A novel kind of beta element production has been recently proposed [15] in which slow (v about 0. 1 c) fully ionized ions are stored {{in a very small}} storage ring. Products like the isomeric doublet Li- 7 (d,p) Li- 8 and Li- 6 (He 3,n) B- 8 are stopped in some foils few micron thick, from which they quickly diffuse as neutral atoms. The improvements are shown to be considerable. An ion source, a chain of several accelerators in cascade and a high energy storage/decay ring can produce a B- 8 induced nue spectrum which has as much as 7. 7 times higher energy than the one from He- 6 induced anti-nue for a given magnetic rigidity of the storage ring. At a given neutrino energy, the CC cross sections for nue are about 3 times larger than the ones of anti-nue while the NC/CC inelastic pion background faking muons is about 3 times smaller.

A combination of summer pruning and covering the orchard ground with white textile increased tree productivity, improved coloration at harvest, and increased contents of anthocyanin, ascorbic acid and total phenolic compounds in {{at least some of the}} cultivars. It also developed fruit resistance to Neofabraea spp. and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides which were the most common pathogens, causing fungal storage deseases. Analyses of various fruit ripening parameters showed that starch hydrolysis point and Streif index (firmness/(starch hydrolysis point * soluble solid concentration)) were corrlated with internal ethylene concentration (IEC) at harvest. Thus, the optimal harvesting time can be deduced from the starch index in some cultivars (Agra, Santana and Sultanat) while the Streif index is more accurate for other cultivars (Eir, Delorina and Zarya alatau). In yet others, titratable acidity and flesh firmness also produced important information and have to use as an additional index beside starch hydrolysis for Ella and Dayton respectively which showed only close correlation between starch hydrolysis and IEC. By contrast, soluble solids concentration and skin color are not useful due to their sensitivity to weather conditions and light intensity.

We introduce ArchSim, a simulation tool that for evaluating an implementation of an archival repository system and compare options such as different disk reliabilities, error detection and correction algorithms, preventive maintenance, etc. We use ArchSim to analyze a case study of an Archival Repository for Computer Science Technical Reports. KEYWORDS: digital archiving, digital preservation, archival repository, models for archival repositories, performance of archival repositories, simulation of archival repositories. 1 Introduction A continual threat to digital libraries is the loss of documents. Digital information can be lost not just through magnetic <b>decay</b> in <b>storage</b> devices, but also because of format and device obsolescence. This proble [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Reference {{concepts}} for geologic {{disposal of}} used nuclear fuel and {{high-level radioactive waste}} in the U. S. are developed, including geologic settings and engineered barriers. Repository thermal analysis is demonstrated {{for a range of}} waste types from projected future, advanced nuclear fuel cycles. The results show significant differences among geologic media considered (clay/shale, crystalline rock, salt), and also that waste package size and waste loading must be limited to meet targeted maximum temperature values. In this study, the UFD R&D Campaign has developed a set of reference geologic disposal concepts for a range of waste types that could potentially be generated in advanced nuclear FCs. A disposal concept consists of three components: waste inventory, geologic setting, and concept of operations. Mature repository concepts have been developed in other countries for disposal of spent LWR fuel and HLW from reprocessing UNF, and these serve as starting points for developing this set. Additional design details and EBS concepts will be considered as the reference disposal concepts evolve. The waste inventory considered in this study includes: (1) direct disposal of SNF from the LWR fleet, including Gen III+ advanced LWRs being developed through the Nuclear Power 2010 Program, operating in a once-through cycle; (2) waste generated from reprocessing of LWR UOX UNF to recover U and Pu, and subsequent direct disposal of used Pu-MOX fuel (also used in LWRs) in a modified-open cycle; and (3) waste generated by continuous recycling of metal fuel from fast reactors operating in a TRU burner configuration, with additional TRU material input supplied from reprocessing of LWR UOX fuel. The geologic setting provides the natural barriers, and establishes the boundary conditions for performance of engineered barriers. The composition and physical properties of the host medium dictate design and construction approaches, and determine hydrologic and thermal responses of the disposal system. Clay/shale, salt, and crystalline rock media are selected as the basis for reference mined geologic disposal concepts in this study, consistent with advanced international repository programs, and previous investigations in the U. S. The U. S. pursued deep geologic disposal programs in crystalline rock, shale, salt, and volcanic rock in the years leading up to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, or NWPA (Rechard et al. 2011). The 1987 NWPA amendment act focused the U. S. program on unsaturated, volcanic rock at the Yucca Mountain site, culminating in the 2008 license application. Additional work on unsaturated, crystalline rock settings (e. g., volcanic tuff) is not required to support this generic study. Reference disposal concepts are selected for the media listed above and for deep borehole disposal, drawing from recent work in the U. S. and internationally. The main features of the repository concepts are discussed in Section 4. 5 and summarized in Table ES- 1. Temperature histories at the waste package surface and a specified distance into the host rock are calculated for combinations of waste types and reference disposal concepts, specifying waste package emplacement modes. Target maximum waste package surface temperatures are identified, enabling a sensitivity study to inform the tradeoff between the quantity of waste per disposal package, and <b>decay</b> <b>storage</b> duration, with respect to peak temperature at the waste package surface. For surface storage duration on the order of 100 years or less, waste package sizes for direct disposal of SNF are effectively limited to 4 -PWR configurations (or equivalent size and output). Thermal results are summarized, along with recommendations for follow-on work including adding additional reference concepts, verification and uncertainty analysis for thermal calculations, developing descriptions of surface facilities and other system details, and cost estimation to support system-level evaluations...|$|E
40|$|SummaryThe {{localization}} of mRNA to defined cytoplasmic {{sites in}} eukaryotic cells not only allows localized protein production but also determines {{the fate of}} mRNAs. For instance, translationally repressed mRNAs localize to P-bodies and stress granules where their <b>decay</b> and <b>storage,</b> respectively, are directed. Here, we find that several mRNAs are localized to granules in unstressed, actively growing cells. These granules {{play a key role}} in the stress-dependent formation of P-bodies. Specific glycolytic mRNAs are colocalized in multiple granules per cell, which aggregate during P-body formation. Such aggregation is still observed under conditions or in mutants where P-bodies do not form. In unstressed cells, the mRNA granules appear associated with active translation; this might enable a coregulation of protein expression from the same pathways or complexes. Parallels can be drawn between this coregulation and the advantage of operons in prokaryotic systems...|$|R
40|$|Washing {{water used}} for {{processing}} {{fruits and vegetables}} can convey spoilage fungi and bacteria. The common procedure to reduce microbial contamination {{involves the use of}} chlorine based compounds. Recently, electrolyzed water (EW) has been evaluated as an alternative measure in controlling microbial spoilage contamination occurring during washing steps. This work reviews results related to the application of EW for controlling microbial viability responsible for <b>decay</b> development during <b>storage</b> period. EW produced with sodium bicarbonate as electrolyte reduced Penicillium spp. population in water and, consequently, green mould decay in citrus fruits; the use of sodium chloride in EW production inactivated spores of Fusarium sp. in water and reduced pineapple <b>decay</b> during <b>storage</b> at 12 °C for 20 days as well as controlled yeast and mould population in date fruit up to six months of cold storage. EW was also found effective in controlling spoilage bacteria on ready-to-eat produce. Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pantoea agglomerons, and Rhanella aquatilis were undetectable in electrolyzed process water amended with sodium chloride although similar treatment slightly reduced Erwinia carotovora load inoculated onto lettuce. EW at low free chlorine concentration reduced viability of Pseudomonas spp. And psychrotrophic bacteria in both simulated and industrial washing water. EW treatment of fresh cut lettuce dipped in microbial contaminated water reduced Pseudomonas spp. of about 1 log cfu g- 1 delaying spoilage symptoms that occurred early in untreated vegetables. These results demonstrate that the use of EW can control spoilage microorganisms in washing water, reduce crosscontamination phenomena and delay fruit and vegetable decay...|$|R
40|$|The {{advance in}} {{neutrino}} oscillation physics {{is driven by}} the availability of well characterized and high flux neutrino beams. The three present options for the next generation neutrino oscillation facility are super beams, neutrino factories and beta-beams. A super-beam is a very high intensity classical neutrino beam generated by protons impinging on a target where the neutrinos are generated by the secondary particles decaying in a tunnel down streams of the target. In a neutrino factory the neutrinos are generated from muons <b>decaying</b> in a <b>storage</b> ring with long straight sections pointing towards the detectors. In a beta-beam the neutrinos are also originating from <b>decay</b> in a <b>storage</b> ring but the decaying particles are radioactive ions rather than muons. I will in this presentation review the three options and discuss {{the pros and cons of}} each. The present joint design effort for a future high intensity neutrino oscillation in Europe within a common EU supported design study, EURONU, will also be presented. The design study will explore the physics reach, the detectors, the feasibility, the safety issues and the cost for each of the options so that the the community can take a decision on what to build when the facilities presently under exploitation and construction have to be replaced...|$|R
40|$|Loquat (Eriobotrya japonica Lindl.) is a {{subtropical}} evergreen tree whose {{fruit is}} consumed both fresh and processed. Loquat fruit {{is a good}} source of minerals and carotenoids, while the kernel is rich in protein and carbohydrates. It has been considered a non-climacteric fruit, but there is evidence that some cultivars have a ripening pattern similar to that of climacteric fruits. The fruit has a short postharvest life at ambient temperatures and is susceptible to physical and mechanical damage, loss of moisture and nutrients, and <b>decay.</b> Low-temperature <b>storage</b> extends the shelf life of loquat fruit, but some cultivars are severely affected by chilling injury and flesh browning during cold storage. Purple spot, browning and leatheriness are major postharvest disorders. The shelf life of loquat can be extended by modified or controlled atmosphere storage as well as by postharvest treatment with 1 -methyl cyclopropene or methyl jasmonate...|$|R
