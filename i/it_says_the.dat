5|$|In the series' story, the Nemesis is {{the result}} of infecting a Tyrant — a {{humanoid}} bio-weapon created to be the ultimate lifeform—with a parasitic organism designed to increase its intelligence. Upon infection, the parasite takes control of the Tyrant's nervous system, forming its own brain and enabling it to follow precise instructions and make decisions without a need for constant direction. Clothed in black trousers, an overcoat, boots, and gloves, the Nemesis is armed with a rocket launcher mounted on its left arm. To emphasize its design as a prototype, the game developers left exposed muscles on its body and added stitches to cover the right eye. Upon spotting its target, <b>it</b> <b>says</b> <b>the</b> target's name out loud and attacks.|$|E
5|$|The other {{national}} symbol that was chosen in the 1995 referendum {{was the national}} emblem. The elements of the emblem include a ribbon in {{the colors of the}} national flag, a map of Belarus, wheat ears and a red star. At the base of the ribbon, <b>it</b> <b>says</b> <b>the</b> country's official name in the Belarusian language. The emblem is an allusion to the one used by the Byelorussian SSR, designed by Ivan Dubasov in 1950. In the Soviet version, a hammer and sickle replaced the map of Belarus and the ribbon was all red. On the left and right ribbons, the Soviet motto Workers of the world, unite! appeared in the Belarusian and Russian languages.|$|E

25|$|The more {{credible}} theory {{comes from the}} source of Rajatarangini written by a Kashmiri Brahman, Kalhana. <b>It</b> <b>says</b> <b>the</b> region was originally known as Dhakka. The word Dhakka means watchtower. Bikrampur and Sonargaon—the earlier strongholds of Bengal rulers were situated nearby. So Dhaka was most likely used as the watchtower for the fortification purpose.|$|E
25|$|This is {{followed}} by {{an examination of the}} attacks on the Pentagon. The film opposes the official story of Flight 77 hitting the Pentagon, alleging that the path of destruction does not match what a 757 would leave. In particular it claims that the size of the hole in the Pentagon, a lack of debris and, little landscape damage seem inconsistent with prior airliner crashes. It also alleges that too few parts were recovered from the crash site to reliably ascertain that they were of a Boeing 757, and that a flywheel observed at the site seemed too small to {{have been part of the}} aircraft's engine turbine. Experts officially declared that the wheel was part of the APU, but others say it didn't come from the APU of a 757 but likely from an E-3 Sentry aircraft. The film also claims that the alleged hijacker-pilot Hani Hanjour had difficulty operating basic controls on a small Cessna that he rented at a flight school, and that perhaps not even an experienced pilot could have maneuvered the reflex angle of turn at the airspeed and altitude at which the aircraft approached without going into a high speed stall. The film mentions three cameras on nearby buildings that allegedly caught the entire incident at the Pentagon on film, which <b>it</b> <b>says</b> <b>the</b> government confiscated and has refused to release in full.|$|E

500|$|However, {{the text}} is ambiguous, making it {{questionable}} that Henry ever matures. As critic Donald Gibson stated in The Red Badge of Courage: Redefining the Hero, [...] "the novel undercuts itself. It {{says there is no}} answer to the questions it raises; yet <b>it</b> <b>says</b> <b>the</b> opposite.... It says that Henry Fleming finally sees things as they are; it says he is a deluded fool. It says that Henry does not see things as they are; but no one else does either." [...] Although Crane critic and biographer Stallman wrote of Henry's [...] "spiritual change" [...] {{by the end of the}} story, he also found this theme difficult to champion in light of the novel's enigmatic ending. Although Henry [...] "progresses upwards toward manhood and moral triumph", as he begins to mature by taking leave of his previous [...] "romantic notions," [...] "the education of the hero ends as it began: in self deception." [...] Critic William B. Dillingham also noted the novel's heroism paradox, especially in terms of the introspective Henry's lapse into unreasoning self-abandon in the second half of the book. Dillingham stated that [...] "in order to be courageous, a man in time of physical strife must abandon the highest of his human facilities, reason and imagination, and act instinctively, even animalistically." ...|$|E
