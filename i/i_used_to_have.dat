Sandom had generally been the peacemaker as Daltrey and Townshend feuded between themselves, but because of Moon's temperament the group now had four members frequently in conflict. [...] "We used to fight regularly," [...] remembered Moon in later years. [...] "John [...] and <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> fights– it wasn't very serious, it was more of an emotional spur-of-the moment thing." [...] Moon also clashed with Daltrey and Townshend: [...] "We really have absolutely nothing in common apart from music," [...] he said in a later interview. Although Townshend described him as a [...] "completely different person to anyone I've ever met," [...] the pair had a rapport in the early years and enjoyed practical jokes and improvised comedy. Moon's drumming style affected the band's musical structure; although Entwistle initially found Moon's lack of conventional timekeeping problematic, it created an original sound.|$|E

Kenseth had two Top 5 finishes during the partial season. The following year he raced full-time all season. He won his first Busch Series race on February 22, 1998, when he nudged leader Tony Stewart's car entering the final turn of the final lap, culmulating in a second- and third-place finishes in the Busch points.

I wanted <b>to</b> know when <b>having</b> smartboards, iPads, laptops, computers, clickers and other technologies no longer engages students in learning. The method that <b>I</b> <b>used</b> was <b>to</b> <b>have</b> three different treatments that allowed me to see when and if the technology that I had in my classroom would enhance their learning. For the first treatment the students were not allowed any technology in the classroom. This meant these students <b>had</b> <b>to</b> rely on their own knowledge and ask questions of me and their fellow classmates. The second treatment group was allowed the use of technology fifty percent of the time. These students were given technology half of the time in the classroom. They could ask questions of their neighbors, their teacher, and use some other resources when time was permitted. The final treatment had full use of technology. These students were only allowed <b>to</b> <b>use</b> technology <b>to</b> find the answer that they were searching for. They could ask their teacher some questions but were to rely heavily on their technology for their answers. The results from my study were that second treatment group preformed the best on their posttest. They showed the most gain in their knowledge than the other two groups. The students that are coming to us in our classrooms are much more familiar with the use of computers, iPads, iPods, and other technology that in the years before. I think there is one thing that will never change in learning and that is the need for human contact...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} an autobiographical {{investigation}} of my construction {{as a public}} school chess teacher from a blue-collar background. Exploring chess as both a form of cultural capital and a metaphor for social life (and especially the work of teaching), I trace my personal history from first learning the game to my present and intended future uses of it in classroom settings {{as part of the}} official curriculum. In the course of that exploration I also develop a narrative understanding of the working class circumstances into which I was born and the conflicted intellectual identity I forged through an upward class mobility that led me to become the first member of my immediate family to graduate from college. I further narrate my evolving understanding of chess as a possible school subject by reflecting on its status during my childhood schooldays and my working day as full-time chess teacher in a public school setting. ^ In the course of writing this study I have found that I am most at home—and am rewarded with the greatest sense of purpose—within the tensions and struggles of practical school life (why I feel like an amphibian too long out of water in more purely academic settings) and that I am a much more thoughtful teacher when I am actively writing about my work. It takes me a step beyond the old teacher/academic paradigm <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> think <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> straddle (straddling is a recurring theme I this work). This study finds me recognizing a personal and professional need to work within that tension and dialogue in both directions when possible—reclaiming the role of teacher as intellectual within the academic game and remaining closely tied to working class learning communities. ...|$|R
