25|$|Compression of air creates heat; {{the air is}} warmer after compression. Expansion removes heat. If {{no extra}} heat is added, the air will be much colder after expansion. If the heat {{generated}} during compression can be stored and used during expansion, {{the efficiency of the}} storage improves considerably. There are three ways in which a CAES system can deal with the heat. Air storage can be adiabatic, <b>diabatic,</b> or isothermal.|$|E

2500|$|Figure 2 {{shows the}} {{dependence}} of the <b>diabatic</b> and adiabatic energies {{on the value of}} the magnetic field; note that for non-zero coupling the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian cannot be degenerate, and thus we have an avoided crossing.

2500|$|<b>Diabatic</b> storage dissipates much of {{the heat}} of {{compression}} with intercoolers (thus approaching isothermal compression) into the atmosphere as waste; essentially wasting, thereby, the renewable energy used to perform the work of compression. [...] Upon removal from storage, the temperature of this compressed air is the one indicator {{of the amount of}} stored energy that remains in this air. Consequently, if the air temperature is low for the energy recovery process, the air must be substantially re-heated prior to expansion in the turbine to power a generator. This reheating can be accomplished with a natural gas fired burner for utility grade storage or with a heated metal mass. As recovery is often most needed when renewable sources are quiescent, fuel must be burned {{to make up for the}} wasted heat. [...] This degrades the efficiency of the storage-recovery cycle; and while this approach is relatively simple, the burning of fuel adds to the cost of the recovered electrical energy and compromises the ecological benefits associated with most renewable energy sources. [...] Nevertheless, this is thus far the only system which has been implemented commercially.|$|E
50|$|In the <b>diabatic</b> representation, the {{potential}} energy surfaces are smoother, so that low order Taylor series expansions {{of the surface}} capture much {{of the complexity of}} the original system. However strictly <b>diabatic</b> states do not exist in the general case. Hence, <b>diabatic</b> potentials generated from transforming multiple electronic energy surfaces together are generally not exact. These can be called pseudo-diabatic potentials, but generally the term is not used unless it is necessary to highlight this subtlety. Hence, pseudo-diabatic potentials are synonymous with <b>diabatic</b> potentials.|$|E
50|$|Alternatively, one {{can avoid}} {{explicit}} use of derivative couplings by switch from the adiabatic to the <b>diabatic</b> {{representation of the}} potential energy surfaces. Although rigorous validation of a <b>diabatic</b> representation requires knowledge of vibronic coupling, it is often possible to construct such <b>diabatic</b> representations by referencing the continuity of physical quantities such as dipole moment, charge distribution or orbital occupations. However, such construction requires detailed knowledge of a molecular system and introduces significant arbitrariness. <b>Diabatic</b> representations constructed with different method can yield different results and {{the reliability of the}} result relies on the discretion of the researcher.|$|E
