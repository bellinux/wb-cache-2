40|$|The GB {{transmission}} network is experiencing {{significant changes in}} its generation mix, with increasing volume of renewables and the decommissioning of large-scale thermal power plants. One of the main challenges resulting from these changes in the generation portfolio is the potential impact on the reliable operation of the existing protection schemes. Specifically, the likely decrease in the <b>fault</b> <b>level</b> may result in conventional protection schemes being slow/failing in detection faults, and the decrease of the system inertia {{would lead to a}} power system being more sensitive to disturbances, which may subsequently lead to undesired operation of Rate of Change of Frequency (RoCoF) – based Loss-of-Main (LOM) relays. Synchronous compensators are considered to have the potential to offer, among other benefits, a boost to system inertia and an increase of system <b>fault</b> <b>level,</b> which could facilitate the operation of protection systems in future energy scenarios. This paper presents the initial studies conducted under a project that has been initiated by a number of utility companies in the UK, focusing on the demonstration and deployment of the first synchronous compensator at a strategic point in the GB transmission system. The studies investigate the potential impacts of a GB transmission system with high penetration of non-synchronous generation on fault levels and system inertia, while contrasting the results with that of a system reinforced by synchronous compensation. The results of the inertia studies show that synchronous compensation {{could be used as a}} potential solution to limit system RoCoF following a disturbance, thereby reducing the risk of a cascading event as a result of the tripping of RoCoF relays. In the <b>fault</b> <b>level</b> studies, it was observed that while increasing the synchronous compensator rating, fault current and short circuit ratio increased, with a faster rate of increase the closer the synchronous compensator is to the fault. This observation suggests that synchronous compensators can also be used to minimise the risk of commutation failure of HVDC links, with the added likelihood of ensuring that the network protection operates correctly in low <b>fault</b> <b>level</b> scenarios...|$|E

A case study involving the connection of distributed generation (DG) via a superconducting fault current limiter (SFCL) is used to illustrate the potential protection and control issues. In particular, DG fault ride-through, autoreclosure schemes, and transformer inrush current can be problematic for SFCLs that require a recovery period.

40|$|<b>Fault</b> <b>levels</b> in {{electrical}} distribution systems are rising {{due to the}} increasing presence of distributed generation, and this rising trend {{is expected to continue}} in the future. Superconducting fault-current limiters (SFCLs) are a promising solution to this problem. This paper describes the factors that govern the selection of optimal SFCL resistance. The total energy dissipated in an SFCL during a fault is particularly important for estimating the recovery time of the SFCL; the recovery time affects the design, planning, and operation of electrical systems using SFCLs to manage <b>fault</b> <b>levels.</b> Generic equations for energy dissipation are established in terms of fault duration, SFCL resistance, source impedance, source voltage, and fault inception angles. Furthermore, using an analysis that is independent of superconductor material, it is shown that the minimum required volume of superconductors linearly varies with SFCL resistance but, for a given level of fault-current limitation and power rating, is independent of system voltage and superconductor resistivity. Hence, there is a compromise between a shorter recovery time, which is desirable, and the cost of the volume of superconducting material needed for the resistance required to achieve the shorter recovery time...|$|R

This paper presents the methodology, measurement results, and data analysis in relation to synchronized flicker measurements carried out in a high-voltage (HV) /medium-voltage (MV) power system which contains an arc furnace supplied by a dedicated feeder connected to the HV busbar. The flicker transfer coefficients derived from measurement results clearly indicate that flicker transfer from the arc furnace site to the upstream HV busbar is governed by the <b>fault</b> <b>levels</b> at the two locations. However, the transfer of flicker from the upstream HV busbar to other downstream busbars is dependent on the downstream load composition.
