5|$|A {{snowflake}} is {{a single}} ice crystal that has achieved a sufficient size, and may have amalgamated with others, then falls through the Earth's atmosphere as snow. Each flake nucleates around a dust particle in supersaturated air masses by attracting supercooled cloud water droplets, which freeze and accrete in crystal form. Complex shapes emerge as the flake moves through differing temperature and humidity zones in the atmosphere, such that individual snowflakes differ in detail from one another, but may be categorized in eight broad classifications and at least 80 individual variants. The main constituent shapes for ice crystals, from which combinations may occur, are needle, column, plate and rime. Snowflakes appear white in color despite being made of clear ice. This is due to <b>diffuse</b> <b>reflection</b> of the whole spectrum of light by the small crystal facets.|$|E
5|$|Once a droplet has frozen, {{it grows}} in the {{supersaturated}} environment—one where air is saturated with respect to ice when the temperature is below the freezing point. The droplet then grows by diffusion of water molecules in the air (vapor) onto the ice crystal surface where they are collected. Because water droplets {{are so much more}} numerous than the ice crystals due to their sheer abundance, the crystals are able to grow to hundreds of micrometers or millimeters in size {{at the expense of the}} water droplets by the Wegener–Bergeron–Findeisen process. The corresponding depletion of water vapor causes the ice crystals to grow at the droplets' expense. These large crystals are an efficient source of precipitation, since they fall through the atmosphere due to their mass, and may collide and stick together in clusters, or aggregates. These aggregates are snowflakes, and are usually the type of ice particle that falls to the ground. Although the ice is clear, scattering of light by the crystal facets and hollows/imperfections mean that the crystals often appear white in color due to <b>diffuse</b> <b>reflection</b> of the whole spectrum of light by the small ice particles.|$|E
25|$|Reflections can {{be divided}} into two types: {{specular}} reflection and <b>diffuse</b> <b>reflection.</b> Specular reflection describes the gloss of surfaces such as mirrors, which reflect light in a simple, predictable way. This allows for production of reflected images that can be associated with an actual (real) or extrapolated (virtual) location in space. <b>Diffuse</b> <b>reflection</b> describes non-glossy materials, such as paper or rock. The reflections from these surfaces can only be described statistically, with the exact distribution of the reflected light depending on the microscopic structure of the material. Many diffuse reflectors are described or can be approximated by Lambert's cosine law, which describes surfaces that have equal luminance when viewed from any angle. Glossy surfaces can give both specular and <b>diffuse</b> <b>reflection.</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Diffuse</b> <b>reflections</b> have {{received}} increasing attention in architectural acoustics {{over the past}} quarter century. The term diffuse refers to non-specular directions. This paper identifies three mechanisms that cause <b>diffuse</b> <b>reflections.</b> Practitioners have found that changing specular <b>reflections</b> into <b>diffuse</b> <b>reflections</b> can reduce noise and echoes both indoors and outdoors. Developers of acoustical modeling software have also found that modeling diffuse in additional to specular reflections produces more accurate predictions. The final portion of this paper presents results {{for a study of}} scattering coefficients in acoustical modeling software...|$|R

This oriented form has the same lattice constants as α-form but is associated with extra <b>diffuse</b> <b>reflections.</b> This form and the <b>diffuse</b> <b>reflections</b> disappear by annealing above 170 °C and give an oriented and more stable form (α') in which the chain has the T 3 GT 3 G- conformation...|$|R

25|$|The {{propagation}} of {{light through the}} core of an optical fiber is based on total internal reflection of the lightwave. Rough and irregular surfaces, even at the molecular level, can cause light rays to be reflected in random directions.

25|$|Thermal {{effects are}} the {{predominant}} cause of laser radiation injury, but photo-chemical effects {{can also be}} of concern for specific wavelengths of laser radiation.

25|$|In {{the late}} 1860s, through the {{practice}} of painting light and water en plein air (outdoors), he and his friend Claude Monet discovered that the color of shadows is not brown or black, but the reflected color of the objects surrounding them, an effect known today as <b>diffuse</b> <b>reflection.</b> Several pairs of paintings exist in which Renoir and Monet worked side-by-side, depicting the same scenes (La Grenouillère, 1869).|$|E
40|$|A {{technique}} for optical measurement of a thickness of a {{layer on a}} surface uses <b>diffuse</b> <b>reflections</b> at opposite boundaries of the layer, operates on transparent, or translucent layers. The thickness is determined by computing a separation between the centers of the two <b>diffuse</b> <b>reflections,</b> and using the index of refraction of the layer, and geometric properties of a beam and detector {{with respect to the}} surface.

40|$|Datum This thesis {{describes}} {{a method for}} approximative soft shadows and <b>diffuse</b> <b>reflections</b> in dynamic scenes, based on a method by Ren et al. [32]. An overview of precomputed radiance transfer and spherical harmonics is also presented, {{as well as a}} short introduction to global illumination. The proposed method uses a low-order spherical harmonics basis to represent incident radiance and visibility on the hemisphere of a receiver point. Diffuse reflecting geometry and shadow casting geometry is represented as sets of spheres. The spheres of an object approximate its shape and diffuse surface color as seen from any viewpoint. In a first pass, the direct illumination of an object is projected to its spheres and stored along with an approximation of the diffuse surface color as SH vectors defined over the surface of each sphere. In a second pass, the average color and the visibility for each sphere at a receiver point is found. The product of average color and visibility is used to approximate the incident radiance from <b>diffuse</b> <b>reflections.</b> Using a sphere set approximation instead of actual geometry for both soft shadows and <b>diffuse</b> <b>reflections</b> allows us to compute the visibility and <b>diffuse</b> <b>reflections</b> of an object on the fly at runtime.

25|$|They produce large mucus webs to filter-feed on {{phytoplankton}} {{but also}} small zooplankton. They eat the web with the captured prey and then re-reproduce a web net. The web {{is large and}} spherical {{and it is difficult}} to see during the day because of <b>diffuse</b> <b>reflection.</b> Webs are easier to see at night. Limacina helicina is easily disturbed (like all other Thecosomata); when disturbed, it retracts into its shell and destroys its web. Gilmer & Harbison (1991) have assumed, that Limacina helicina feeds while motionless (without actively swimming). Its web enables them neutral buoyancy or allow them slow sinking only.|$|E
25|$|Lasers in {{this class}} may cause damage if the beam enters the eye directly. This {{generally}} applies to lasers powered from 5–500mW. Lasers in this category can cause permanent eye damage with exposures of 1/100th of a second or more depending {{on the strength of}} the laser. A <b>diffuse</b> <b>reflection</b> is generally not hazardous but specular reflections can be just as dangerous as direct exposures. Protective eyewear is recommended when direct beam viewing of ClassIIIb lasers may occur. Lasers at the high power end of this class may also present a fire hazard and can lightly burn skin.|$|E
25|$|Glass is in {{widespread}} use {{largely due to}} the production of glass compositions that are transparent to visible light. In contrast, polycrystalline materials do not generally transmit visible light. The individual crystallites may be transparent, but their facets (grain boundaries) reflect or scatter light resulting in <b>diffuse</b> <b>reflection.</b> Glass does not contain the internal subdivisions associated with grain boundaries in polycrystals and hence does not scatter light {{in the same manner as}} a polycrystalline material. The surface of a glass is often smooth since during glass formation the molecules of the supercooled liquid are not forced to dispose in rigid crystal geometries and can follow surface tension, which imposes a microscopically smooth surface. These properties, which give glass its clearness, can be retained even if glass is partially light-absorbing—i.e., colored.|$|E

This approach is geared towards VR applications, where realism and fast rendering is important.

500|$|The exact {{details of}} the {{sticking}} mechanism remain controversial. Possibilities include mechanical interlocking, sintering, electrostatic attraction {{as well as the}} existence of a [...] "sticky" [...] liquid-like layer on the crystal surface. The individual ice crystals often have hexagonal symmetry. Although the ice is clear, scattering of light by the crystal facets and hollows/imperfections mean that the crystals often appear white in color due to <b>diffuse</b> <b>reflection</b> of the whole spectrum of light by the small ice particles. The shape of the snowflake is determined broadly by the temperature and humidity at which it is formed. Rarely, at a temperature of around , snowflakes can form in threefold symmetry — triangular snowflakes. The most common snow particles are visibly irregular, although near-perfect snowflakes may be more common in pictures because they are more visually appealing. It is unlikely that any two snowflakes are alike due to the estimated 1019 (10 quintillion) water molecules which make up a typical snowflake, which grow at different rates and in different patterns depending on the changing temperature and humidity within the atmosphere that the snowflake falls through {{on its way to the}} ground.|$|E
2500|$|In a 1909 paper, On a <b>Diffuse</b> <b>Reflection</b> of the α-Particles, Geiger and Marsden {{described}} the experiment {{by which they}} proved that alpha particles can indeed be scattered by more than 90°. In their experiment, they prepared a small conical glass tube (AB) containing [...] "radium emanation" [...] (radon), [...] "radium A" [...] (actual radium), and [...] "radium C" [...] (bismuth-214); its open end sealed with mica. [...] This was their alpha particle emitter. [...] They then set up a lead plate (P), behind which they placed a fluorescent screen (S). [...] The tube was held {{on the opposite side}} of plate, such that the alpha particles it emitted could not directly strike the screen. [...] They noticed a few scintillations on the screen, because some alpha particles got around the plate by bouncing off air molecules. [...] They then placed a metal foil (R) to the side of the lead plate. [...] They pointed the tube at the foil to see if the alpha particles would bounce off it and strike the screen on the other side of the plate, and observed an increase in the number of scintillations on the screen. Counting the scintillations, they observed that metals with higher atomic mass, such as gold, reflected more alpha particles than lighter ones such as aluminium.|$|E
50|$|Reflected {{light can}} be divided into two sub-types, {{specular}} reflection and <b>diffuse</b> <b>reflection.</b> Specular reflection reflects all light which arrives from a given direction at the same angle, whereas <b>diffuse</b> <b>reflection</b> reflects that light in a broad range of directions. An example of the distinction between specular and <b>diffuse</b> <b>reflection</b> would be glossy and matte paints. Matte paints have almost exclusively <b>diffuse</b> <b>reflection,</b> while glossy paints have both specular and <b>diffuse</b> <b>reflection.</b> A surface built from a non-absorbing powder, such as plaster, can be a nearly perfect diffuser, whereas polished metallic objects can specularly reflect light very efficiently.
