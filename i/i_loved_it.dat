It's sensual, it's exciting, it's so rich with color. <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>it.</b> The people came out so heavy and so hard. I think it was exciting, {{especially}} to participate and experience it with them like that. Me and B have a good relationship. And {{to be able to have}} the chemistry we have and do it in a city that's so unique like that is unforgettable. The pictures speak a thousand words. So you saw the energy out there.

500|$|Desi Arnaz, Jr. voiced {{his support}} of the film, stating {{that he and his}} sister Lucie Arnaz, [...] "loved the story being told in this movie." [...] Arnaz, Jr. said, [...] "It is an amazing saga of people in search of the American dream. It is my father`s story. It is the story of many people who came to this country with hopes and dreams." [...] Tito Puente praised the film prior to its {{theatrical}} release, stating, [...] "I've seen the movie twice, and <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>it</b> the second time.

[...] Feller was ranked 36th on Sporting Newss list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players and also the publication's [...] "greatest pitcher of his time" [...] {{as well as a}} finalist for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team in 1999.

He {{believes}} that an actor with a [...] "proven track record" [...] would likely have been chosen if another network had broadcast the show. He went through numerous auditions; each time he explained to the casting directors what he could bring to the character, if given the part. Alan Taylor and Mad Men creator Matthew Weiner initially thought Hamm was too handsome for the role but ultimately decided, [...] "it was perfect to cast sort of the perfect male in this part". Weiner also sensed that the actor had suffered early loss of his parents, which was similar to Draper's backstory.|$|E

However, {{the album was}} not released in the United States until 2008, and Amerie was dropped from Columbia Records and Sony Urban Music due to low sales of Because <b>I</b> <b>Love</b> <b>It</b> and the low performance of its singles [...] "Take Control", [...] "Gotta Work" [...] and [...] "That's What U R".|$|R

500|$|The {{greatest}} {{amount of}} technical advice for the production came from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), who provided Trek fan Jesco von Puttkamer as advisor to the film. Roddenberry had known Puttkamer since 1975, when they had been introduced by a mutual friend, the Assistant Director of Astronautics at the Smithsonian Institution. From 1976 until {{the completion of the}} film Puttkamer provided the writers, producer, and director with memos on everything technical in the script; the scientist reviewed every line in the script, and was unpaid for his assistance. [...] "Science fiction films, including those of the recent past, have been woefully short of good science advice," [...] he said. [...] "Star Wars [...] really not science fiction. <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>it,</b> but it's a fairy tale of princes and knights in another galaxy.

500|$|Gunn had a [...] "fantastic {{rapport with}} the Norwich supporters". As a player, he liked [...] "to tease the crowd during the game". Before each half of a match, Gunn would run toward his goal and pretend to attempt to headbutt the crossbar.

Norwich fans noticed it soon after his arrival at the club and, in Gunn's words, [...] "would wait until I got to about the 18-yard line and then start a small [...] "Wooo..." [...] which would build into a full-blown [...] "WOOOO ... AH!" ... <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>it</b> and came close to smacking my head against the woodwork a couple of times".

500|$|Reviewers {{who gave}} Wipeout 3 lower marks noted {{a sense of}} {{disappointment}} that the series broke little new ground. Stuart Miles of The Times admitted Wipeout 3 was a good game, but {{felt that he had}} been expecting much more from the sequel: [...] "It's as if the programmers have concerned themselves more with the overall look and feel, rather than further developing the existing gameplay." [...] Alistair Wallace of Gamasutra, in a retrospective on Wipeout 2097, remembered that [...] "I enjoyed [...] because it was more of the same and <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>it,</b> but I think the series ran out of its innovation. Doing loop the loops isn't a big deal really." [...] GameSpot summed up its review of the game by judging Wipeout 3 an excellent racer, but not able to beat Wipeout 2097 as the best futuristic racing game of all time.|$|E

500|$|Following his blues fusion with {{gospel and}} jazz {{influences}} on his earlier Atlantic material, which {{had brought him}} much fame and controversy, Charles sought to experiment with country music.

[...] At Atlantic, he attempted to incorporate this style and influence with his cover of country singer Hank Snow's [...] "I'm Movin' On". Charles later said about the song, [...] "When I heard Hank Snow sing 'Moving On', <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>it.</b> And the lyrics. Keep in mind, I’m a singer, so I like lyrics.

500|$|I {{loved my}} drunk scenes. I know {{that may sound}} very strange to people! I got to just let go and just do a down and dirty version of Sue Ellen.

500|$|Tim Burton {{first saw}} Stephen Sondheim's 1979 stage musical, , as a CalArts student in London in 1980.

I just wandered into the theatre and it just blew me away because I'd never really seen anything that had the mixture of all those elements. I actually went three nights in a row because <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>it</b> so much." [...] Although not a fan of the musical genre, Burton was struck by how cinematic the musical was, and repeatedly attended subsequent performances. He described it as a silent film with music, and was [...] "dazzled both by the music and its sense of the macabre." [...] When his directing career took off in the late 1980s, Burton approached Sondheim with a view to making a cinematic adaptation, but nothing came of it.

500|$|Yeats finally visited Olivia at her Porchester Circle home a {{few weeks}} later to present his well-thought out {{intentions}} but, to his bewilderment, Olivia declared her love for him. Unsure of himself, he took another absence, during which he decided that if Maud was unattainable, or unavailable due to circumstances, he would have Olivia, writing [...] "but after all if I could not get the woman <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>it</b> would be a comfort for a little while to devote myself to another". For Yeats, Olivia was willing to lose her daughter, financial security, social standing, and the goodwill of her family. Although her husband had grounds to sue Yeats and consequently destroy his reputation, her best hope against complete ruin was Shakespear's strong dislike of public scenes. Then Yeats lost his nerve again, suggesting instead each seek advice from a friend (a [...] "sponsor"). He probably chose Florence Farr to be his sponsor while Olivia chose Valentine Fox—Harwood speculates that the sponsors advised the two {{to go ahead with the}} affair, perhaps to Yeats' discomfort.|$|E
500|$|A {{key feature}} of the song is Beck's {{innovative}} guitar playing. Shadwick comments it [...] "suited Beck's taste for shaping and sculpting guitar sounds through the control and manipulation of sustain and, on occasion, feedback". Beck recalled he began incorporating feedback into his guitar solos after he realised that he could control it, adding [...] "I started finding the resonant points on the neck where it came in best. [...] <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>it</b> {{because it was a}} most peculiar sound that contrasted wildly with a plucked string, this round trombone-like noise coming from nowhere. [...] In addition to feedback, Beck's uses a musical scale and bent notes variously described as Eastern, Indian, or raga sounding. [...] Critics and biographers have called the solo [...] "monumental fuzz-drenched", [...] "explosively warped", and [...] "climaxed with a solitary, gigantic burst of feedback". [...] For many, the song represents the Yardbirds' creative peak, including Beck. [...] He commented, [...] "'Shapes of Things' was the pinnacle of the Yardbirds" [...] and added [...] "if I did nothing else, that was the best single".|$|E
500|$|He {{looked through}} the Yellow Pages for jobs and played at bar mitzvahs for $125; he later said [...] " [...] was glad to do it." [...] Weinberg became the live drummer for 10,000 Maniacs in 1992 after their drummer Jerry Augustyniak was injured five days before a five-week tour. He went after that {{assignment}} once he heard it was open and later said, [...] "I lived on a bus and had a roommate. Not exactly like the E Street Band, but <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>it.</b> It reminded me that I am a drummer and I'm good. I was put here to play the drums. To {{turn my back on}} that ability was wrong." [...] He played at the January 1993 inauguration of Bill Clinton. Weinberg auditioned in 1993 to be the principal drummer on the Broadway show The Who's Tommy, but was selected instead as the second substitute. Despite the very low pay, Weinberg was nevertheless happy: [...] "I'd buried drumming so far into my psyche. I felt I'd resurrected it."
