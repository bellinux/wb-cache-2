40|$|Multiplication {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{arithmetic}} operations employed in digital systems, but multipliers are the most time, area, and power consuming circuits. Improvement in any of these parameters can be advantageous for improving the efficiency of the circuit. The ever increasing need for development of efficient and high speed multipliers has motivated several researchers to go a step ahead and present some novel approach. This paper presents an approach towards the reduction of delay in the Wallace tree multipliers by using 4 : 2 compressors along with full-adders and <b>half-adders,</b> in the partial product reduction stage; and employing Kogge-Stone adder for the final addition. The proposed multiplier has been designed using Xilinx ISE Design Suite 14. 7 and implemented for Spartan 3 FPGA...|$|R
40|$|Squarers modulo M {{are useful}} design blocks for digi-tal signal {{processors}} that internally use a residue number system and for implementing the exponentiators required in cryptographic algorithms. In these applications, {{some of the}} most commonly used moduli are those of the form 2 n + 1. To avoid using (n+ 1) -bit circuits, the diminished- 1 number system can be effectively used in modulo 2 n + 1 arithmetic applications. In this paper, {{for the first time in}} the open lit-erature, we formally derive modulo 2 n + 1 squarers that adopt the diminished- 1 number system. The resulting im-plementations are built using only full- or <b>half-adders</b> and a final diminished- 1 adder and can therefore be pipelined straightforwardly. 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel {{approach}} to build integer multiplication circuits based on speculation, a technique which performs a faster -but occasionally wrong- operation resorting to a multi-cycle error correction circuit only in the rare case of error. The proposed speculative multiplier uses a novel speculative carry-save reduction tree using three steps: partial products recoding, partial products partitioning, speculative compression. The speculative tree uses speculative (m: 2) counters, with m> 3, that are faster than a conventional tree using full-adders and <b>half-adders.</b> A technique to automatically choose the suitable speculative counters, taking into accounts both error probability and delay, is also presented in the paper. The speculative tree is completed with a fast speculative carry-propagate adder and an error correction circuit. We have synthesized speculative multipliers for several operand lengths using the UMC 65 nm library. Comparisons with conventional multipliers show that speculation is effective when high-speed is required. Speculative multipliers allow reaching a higher speed compared with conventional counterparts and are also quite effective in terms of power dissipation, when a high speed operation is required...|$|R

50|$|This {{application}} {{was developed by}} Greg Snider of Hewlett-Packard and employs crossbar latches to replicate the functions of a half adder, which {{form the basis of}} modern computational architectures. In this application a crossbar tile is formed of a layer of horizontal row wires and a layer of vertical column wires in which memristor or similar materials are sandwiched between the horizontal and vertical wire layers. Each intersection or junction of the crossbar tile is configurable to be at a high-resistance state in which {{there is little or no}} current between the horizontal and vertical wires or at a low-resistance state in which current is permitted. Fig. 1 illustrates the configuration of a <b>half-adder</b> using a crossbar tile, as taught by Snider, with the nodes identifying junctions of the crossbar tile configured as low-resistance states. By setting different logic inputs A, NOT A, B, and NOT B to different row wires this configuration produces the sum and carry outputs typical for a <b>half-adder.</b> Connections between multiple half-adders may then be used to form full adders in accordance with conventional arithmetic architectures.|$|E
50|$|In {{compound}} B {{the bottom}} section now contains a tertiary amino group also capable of binding to protons. In this system fluorescence only takes place when both cations available. The presence of both cations hinders photoinduced electron transfer (PET) allowing compound B to fluoresce. In {{the absence of}} both or either ion, fluorescence is quenched by PET, which involves an electron transfer from either the nitrogen atom or the oxygen atoms, or both to the anthracenyl group. When both receptors are bound to calcium ions and protons respectively, both PET channels are shut off. The overall result of Compound B is AND logic, since an output of “1” (fluorescence) occurs only when both Ca2+ and H+ are present in solution, that is, have values as “1”. With both systems run in parallel and with monitoring of transmittance for system A and fluorescence for system B {{the result is a}} <b>half-adder</b> capable of reproducing the equation 1+1=2.|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, the {{implementations}} of Single Electron Tunneling (SET) circuits for Brownian Motion Based Logic and Arithmetic Computation were investigated. Random fluctuations {{and noise}} are major factors {{interfering with the}} operation of nanometer scale electronic devices and circuits, as the feature size decreases. In SET technology, one of these interfering effects, namely quantum tunneling, is actually utilized for computations by controlling the transport of individual electrons. However, at the single electron level, random fluctuations are largely unavoidable. In previous research, Brownian Motion based building blocks were proposed which take advantage of random fluctuations to function. i. e, Conservative Join (CJoin) and Hub. However, the SET design of the CJoin had two major limitations when taking industrial implementation into account. Firstly, it had long diagonal wires that appear on the design literally. Secondly, the circuit parameters of the tunnel junction capacitances fell short of the industrial standard. In this research we present a new design for the Cjoin, i. e, the Redesigned CJoin. In the Redesigned CJoin the long diagonal wires that cause routing problem are eliminated and additionally the circuit parameters are industrially realizable, while meeting the same functionality. Secondly, we construct networks of the Redesigned CJoin design and the Hub and show that the two blocks {{can be used to}} build computational units. We investigate networks of two Hubs and one redesign CJoin, three Hubs and two redesign CJoin and network of four Hubs and four redesign CJoin.
