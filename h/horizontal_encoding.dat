40|$|Abstract — A novel {{framework}} {{is presented to}} characterize the tradeoff between diversity and multiplexing of space-time codes at finite signal-to-noise ratios (SNR’s). The diversity gain of a space-time code {{is defined by the}} slope at a particular SNR of the outage probability versus SNR curve for a multiplexing gain defined by the ratio of the system spectral efficiency to the capacity of an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. The finite-SNR diversity-multiplexing tradeoff is evaluated for orthogonal space-time block codes and spatial multiplexing with <b>horizontal</b> <b>encoding.</b> The tradeoff curves provide a characterization of achievable diversity and multiplexing gains for a given space-time code at SNR’s encountered in practice. It is seen that the achievable diversity gains at finite SNR are significantly lower than the asymptotic values given in the literature. I...|$|E

The successive interference cancellation (SIC) algorithm {{is compared to}} the K-best list sphere detector (LSD). A modification to the K-best LSD algorithm is introduced. The SIC and K-best LSD receivers are designed for a 2 x 2 antenna system with 64 -quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). The ASIC implementation results for both architectures are presented. The K-best LSD outperforms the SIC receiver in bad channel conditions but the SIC receiver performs better in channels with less correlated MIMO streams.

In the cyprinid fish retina, where a hierarchical set of interactions between horizontal cells and cone types has been proposed, a particular type of horizontal cell generates light-evoked triphasic (red-hyperpolarizing/green depolarizing/blue-hyperpolarizing) responses. In the present study, we have studied the cone connectivity of these cells by intracellular recording and staining in the roach retina. The horizontal cells were first identified electrophysiologically using spectral stimuli, and then stained intracellularly with horseradish peroxidase. Light microscopy revealed that the cells had consistent H 3 -like morphologies. At an ultrastructural level, these horizontal cells were deduced to contact selectively blue-sensitive cones. Within the cone pedicles, the majority (∼ 80 %) of the contacts were “central” to synaptic ribbons. Some 50 % of the “lateral” processes were large and engulfed cone cytoplasm. Spinules were present within the contacted pedicles but not upon the dendrites of the stained horizontal cells, although previous work had suggested that horseradish peroxidase would not interfere with spinule dynamics. The results are discussed in terms of existing modes of horizontal cell-cone connectivity in cyprinid fish retinae...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a fast and memory {{efficient}} encoding strategy for text image compression with the JBIG 2 standard. The encoder splits up the input image into <b>horizontal</b> stripes and <b>encodes</b> one stripe at a time. Construction of the current dictionary is based on updating dictionaries from previous stripes. We describe separate updating processes for the singleton exclusion dictionary and for the modified-class dictionary. Experiments show that, for both dictionaries, splitting the page into two stripes can save 30 % of encoding time and 40 % of physical memory with a small loss of about 1. 5 % in compression. Further gains can be obtained by using more stripes but with diminishing returns.

Enterococcus faecalis harbours a pathogenicity island (PAI) of 153 kb containing several virulence factors including the enterococcal surface protein (esp). Until now only internal fragments of the PAI or larger chromosomal regions containing it have been transfered. Here we demonstrate precise excision, circularization and horizontal transfer of the entire PAI element from the chromosome of E. faecalis strain UW 3114. This PAI (ca. 200 kb) contained some deletions and insertions {{as compared to the}} PAI of the reference strain MMH 594, transferred precisely and integrated site-specifically into the chromosome of E. faecalis (intergenic region) and Enterococcus faecium (tRNAlys). The internal PAI structure was maintained after transfer. We assessed phenotypic changes accompanying acquisition of the PAI and expression of some of its determinants. The esp gene is expressed on the surface of donor and both transconjugants. Biofilm formation and cytolytic activity were enhanced in E. faecalis transconjugants after acquisition of the PAI. No differences in pathogenicity of E. faecalis were detected using a mouse bacteraemia and a mouse peritonitis models (tail vein and intraperitoneal injection).

Ten patients with 13 thoracic aortic aneurysms, single or multiple, or grafts (4) participated in the study. The causes of disease were atherosclerosis (4), Marfan's syndrome (2), trauma (1), and unknown (1), {{and there were two}} dissections. Spin-echo imaging and cine velocity mapping in 10 mm thick slices with vertical and <b>horizontal</b> velocity <b>encoding</b> were done. Maps of the two velocity components were processed into multiple computer-generated streaks whose orientation and length corresponded to velocity vectors in the chosen plane. The dynamic arrow maps were compared with previously reported aortic arrow maps from normal subjects. The forward flow occupied the entire lumen in the normal aorta in systole and small vortices were only present in the sinuses of Valsalva. Atherosclerotic aneurysms in the ascending aorta were located at the anterior right and had oblique, eccentric jet flows that created a large secondary vortex in the aneurysm. Patients with Marfan's syndrome had a central jet and two large vortices, one on each side. All other aneurysms, dissections, and grafts had irregular flows and vortices not seen in normal subjects. Magnetic {{resonance imaging}} with multidirectional velocity mapping is a powerful noninvasive tool to assess morphologic features and disturbed blood flow in aortic aneurysms and grafts. Recognizably altered flow patterns were found to be associated with altered vessel geometry. The significance of this requires further investigation.

However, the exact {{details of the}} mapping are not specified. Interleaving of spatial streams across antennas is important to achieve spatial diversity for MIMO systems. for MIMO. Starting on page 362, the vertical encoder proposed for spatially-multiplexed MIMO systems does not specify details of the blocks shown in Figure 251 c, i. e. the Encoder, Modulation, Demux and Sub-carrier mapping/PRBS blocks. It is important to design these blocks carefully to fully exploit spatial and frequency diversity with all types of receivers. In this contribution we propose space-frequency bit-interleaved coded modulation (SF-BICM) “vertical-encoded ” architecture which interleaves FEC blocks across both spatial streams and frequency tones. Spatial streams are multiple data streams transmitted over multiple antennas, both in open-loop and closed-loop modes. Space-frequency interleaving provides spatial diversity in addition to frequency diversity, especially with minimum mean squared error (MMSE) spatial filters per tone. Performance of the proposed SF-BICM is compared to simple spatial multiplexing (F-BICM) over 2 x 2 spatially i. i. d ITU channels. The proposed SF-BIC...|$|R
40|$|<b>Encoding</b> <b>horizontal</b> eye {{position}} in the oculomotor system occurs through temporal integration of eye velocity inputs to produce tonic outputs. The nucleus prepositus is commonly {{believed to be the}} “neural integrator ” that accomplishes this function through the activity of its ensemble of predominantly burst-tonic neurons. Single-unit characterizations and labeling studies of theseneuronshave suggested that their collective output is achieved through local feedback loops producedbydirect connections between them. If this is the case, then the ensemble of burst-tonic neurons should exhibit correlated activity. To obtain electrophysiological evidence of local interactions between neurons, we simultaneously recorded pairs (n 29) of burst-tonic neurons in the nucleus prepositus of rhesus macaque monkeys using eight-channel linear microelectrode arrays. We computed the magnitude of synchrony between their spike trains as a function of eye position during ocular fixations and as a function of distance between neurons. Importantly, we found that neurons exhibit unexpected levels of positive synchrony, which is maximal during contralateral fixations and weakest when neurons are located far apart from one another (300 m). Together, our results support a role for shared inputs to ipsilateral pairs of burst-tonic neurons in the encoding of eye {{position in}} the primate nucleus prepositus.

Consequently, assuming that evolutionary processes occur in isolated genomes of individual species has become an unrealistic abstraction. Adaptive variations also involved natural genetic engineering of mobile DNA elements to rewire regulatory networks. In the most highly evolved organisms, biological complexity scales with “non-coding” DNA content more closely than with protein-coding capacity. Coincidentally, we have learned how so-called “non-coding” RNAs that are rich in repetitive mobile DNA sequences are key regulators of complex phenotypes. Both biotic and abiotic ecological challenges serve as triggers for episodes of elevated genome change. The intersections of cell activities, biosphere interactions, horizontal DNA transfers, and non-random Read-Write genome modifications by natural genetic engineering provide a rich molecular and biological foundation for understanding how ecological disruptions can stimulate productive, often abrupt, evolutionary transformations...|$|R
40|$|The way animals {{move through}} space {{is likely to}} affect the way they learn and {{remember}} spatial information. For example, a pelagic fish, Astyanax fasciatus, moves freely in vertical and <b>horizontal</b> space and <b>encodes</b> information from both dimensions with similar accuracy. Benthic fish can also move with six degrees of freedom, but {{spend much of their}} time travelling over the substrate; hence they might be expected to prioritise the horizontal dimension. To understand how benthic fish encode and deploy three-dimensional spatial information we used a fully rotational Y-maze to test whether Corydoras aeneus (i) encode space as an integrated three-dimensional unit or as separate elements, by testing whether they can decompose a three-dimensional trajectory into its vertical and horizontal components, and (ii) whether they prioritise vertical or horizontal information when the two conflict. In contradiction to the expectation generated by our hypothesis, our results suggest that C. aeneus are better at extracting vertical information than horizontal information from a three-dimensional trajectory, suggesting that the vertical axis is learned and remembered robustly. Our results also showed that C. aeneus prioritise vertical information when it conflicts with horizontal information. From these results, we infer that benthic fish attend preferentially to a cue unique to the vertical axis, and we suggest that this cue is hydrostatic pressure...|$|R
40|$|What, if anything, is {{cognitive}} {{architecture and}} how is it implemented in neural architecture? Focusing on perceptual organization, this question is addressed by way of a pluralist approach which, supported by metatheoretical considerations, combines complementary insights from representational, connectionist, and dynamic systems approaches to cognition. This pluralist approach starts from a representationally inspired model which implements the intertwined but functionally distinguishable subprocesses of feedforward feature <b>encoding,</b> <b>horizontal</b> feature binding, and recurrent feature selection. As sustained by a review of neuroscientific evidence, these are the subprocesses that are believed to take place in the visual hierarchy in the brain. Furthermore, the model employs a special form of processing, called transparallel processing, whose neural signature is proposed to be gamma-band synchronization in transient horizontal neural assemblies. In neuroscience, such assemblies are believed to mediate binding of similar features. Their formal counterparts in the model are special input-dependent distributed representations, called hyperstrings, which allow many similar features to be processed in a transparallel fashion, that is, simultaneously as if only one feature were concerned. This form of processing does justice to both the high combinatorial capacity and the high speed of the perceptual organization process. A naturally following proposal is that those temporarily synchronized neural assemblies are "gnosons", that is, constituents of flexible self-organizing cognitive architecture in between the relatively rigid level of neurons and the still elusive level of consciousness. status: publishe...|$|R

Using our reaction-diffusion model, we obtain receptive fields and responses of simple cells in layer IV in cat V 1. The dif-frequency cells in the model cortex have tilt in binocular receptive field but we show that tilt by itself does not indicate slant selectivity. We studied cell responses to binocular combination of spatial frequencies (SFs) by varying the SF ratio of the input gratings {{to the left and}} right eye in the range of 0. 35 – 3. This range of SF ratio corresponds to surface slant variation of − 85 ◦ to 85 ◦. The mean binocular tuning hwhh (half width at half height) is 41 ◦.

30|$|More recently, {{the complex}} {{discrete}} wavelet transform (CDWT)a {{and the new}} quaternionic wavelet transform (QWT) employ analytic filters and propose magnitude-phase representations, shift invariance, and no aliasing. Several authors have studied the CDWT and its application to image denoising. Kingsbury [5 – 7] introduced a very elegant computational structure, the dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DT-CDWT), and incorporates it into the image restoration and enhancement. The DT-CDWT overcomes two drawbacks of the DWT. First is that the real and imaginary parts of CDWT associated with the pair of the Hilbert transforms are in quadrature; their magnitudes are almost shift invariant and redundancy is limited (factor 2 to compare with the undecimated wavelet transform ratio). Second, the complex phase encodes the signal location. However, in 2 D, the complex representation by dual tree is not a satisfactory generalization of the analytic wavelet [8]. It has poor directional selectivity: its single phase can lead to ambiguity when translating the image in two directions. Recently, the concept of generalizing complex wavelets to quaternion algebra has gained a lot of popularity [8 – 11]. The quaternionic wavelet transform has solved the problem of 2 D localization. The phase of the QWT is represented by three angles: the first two <b>encode</b> <b>horizontal</b> and vertical orientations, while the third encodes texture information and edge. For the first application, QWT is used for multiscale image flow estimation [11]. Recently, Soulard studied the QWT [12] and its application in texture classification [13]. Gai et al. [14] used the dual-tree QWT (DT-QWT) in mono-spectral image denoising.|$|R
40|$|WOS: 000384250600025 International audienceThe {{world is}} three-dimensional; hence, even surface-bound animals {{need to learn}} {{vertical}} spatial information. Separate encoding of vertical and horizontal spatial information {{seems to be the}} common strategy regardless of the locomotory style of animals. However, a difference seems to exist in the way freely moving species, such as fish, learn and integrate spatial information as opposed to surface-bound species, which prioritize the <b>horizontal</b> dimension and <b>encode</b> it with a higher resolution. Thus, the locomotory style of an animal may shape how spatial information is learned and prioritized. An alternative hypothesis relates the preference for vertical information to the ability to sense hydrostatic pressure, a prominent cue unique to this dimension. Cuttlefish are mostly benthic animals, but they can move freely in a volume. Therefore, they present an optimal model to examine these hypotheses. We tested whether cuttlefish could separately recall the vertical and horizontal components of a learned two-dimensional target, and whether they have a preference for vertical or horizontal information. Sepia officinalis cuttlefish were trained to select one of two visual cues set along a 45 deg diagonal. The animals were then tested with the two visual cues arranged in a horizontal, vertical or opposite 45 deg configuration. We found that cuttlefish use vertical and horizontal spatial cues separately, and that they prefer vertical information to horizontal information. We propose that, as in fish, the availability of hydrostatic pressure, combined with the ecological value of vertical movements, determines the importance of vertical information...|$|R
40|$|Fish orient {{by using}} a memorized map of their {{surroundings}} and, as they live in aquatic environments, this map must be three dimensional. Studies have shown that fish are able to <b>encode</b> <b>horizontal</b> information; however, we have little information about the cues that are learnt and remembered in the vertical axis. We used the blind Mexican cave fish, Astyanax fasciatus, to test whether fish can orient in the vertical axis and whether they use hydrostatic pressure to do so. After learning the cues associated with a specific height in the aquarium (evident by a reduction in swimming speed), the fish showed significant dishabituation (their swimming speed increased) when moved vertically upwards. When we controlled for the increase in light intensity from the bottom {{to the top of}} the tank the effect persisted, indicating that the most likely cue used by the fish to orient vertically was hydrostatic pressure. A post hoc experiment revealed that the change in swimming speed in response to altered light levels probably represents a change in the level of activity rather than an orientational response. This may define a photokinetic mechanism which operates in conjunction with a negatively phototactic response (revealed in previous experiments) by which the fish orient away from higher light levels and swim faster as light levels increase. This would result in the fish spending more time in lower light levels and would prevent the fish exiting the cave. © 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the distribution of}} functionally activated vestibular-related brainstem neurons during postnatal development, combined immuno-/hybridization histochemistry for c-fos expression was performed in Sprague-Dawley rats (P 1 – 21; adult). Conscious animals were subjected to rotational or translational stimulus which activates hair cells on the horizontal semicircular canals or utricle, respectively. Neuronal activation within brainstem nuclei was defined by the expression of c-fos. Labyrinthectomized controls and normal stationary controls showed only a few sporadically scattered Fos-expressing neurons. During postnatal development, Fos-labeled vestibular nuclear (VN) neurons activated by cycles of constant angular acceleration and deceleration were observed by P 4 while those by sinusoidal translational movement were not identifiable until P 7. In both stimulation paradigms, an age-dependent increase in Fos-labeled neurons was observed in the VN and prepositus hypoglossal nucleus (PrH), the latter being a downstream area related to vestibulo-oculomotor function. In P 7 – 9 rats, Fos-labeled neurons activated by canal or utricle input were evenly distributed throughout the rostro-caudal length of the VN complex (except the dorsal part of lateral VN) as well as groups x and y. At this age, PrH neurons were only activated with rotational stimulus and those activated with translational stimulus were not found until P 11. In P 21 and adult rats, the overlapping distribution of canal- and utricle-related Fos-labeled neurons {{was limited to the}} middle part of medial VN and caudal part of spinal VN. The rostral part of spinal VN was found to be constituted with neurons activated by translational motion. In the medial VN and PrH, a vast majority of the neurons was activated by rotational stimulus and only a small proportion was by translational stimulus.

40|$|The {{ability to}} derive meaning from complex, {{ambiguous}} sensory input requires {{the integration of}} information over both space and time, as well as cognitive mechanisms to dynamically shape that integration. We have studied these processes in the primary visual cortex (V 1), where neurons have been proposed to integrate visual inputs along a geometric pattern known as the association field (AF). We first used cortical reorganization as a model to investigate the role that a specific network of V 1 connections, the long-range horizontal connections, might play in temporal and spatial integration across the AF. When retinal lesions ablate sensory information from portions of the visual field, V 1 undergoes a process of reorganization mediated by compensatory changes in the network of horizontal collaterals. The reorganization accompanies the brainâ€™s amazing ability to perceptually â€œfill-inâ€, or â€œseeâ€, the lost visual input. We developed a computational model to simulate cortical reorganization and perceptual fill-in mediated by a plexus of <b>horizontal</b> connections that <b>encode</b> the AF. The model reproduces the major features of the perceptual fill-in reported by human subjects with retinal lesions, and it suggests that V 1 neurons, empowered by their horizontal connections, underlie both perceptual fill-in and normal integrative mechanisms that are crucial to our visual perception. These results motivated the second prong of our work, which was to experimentally study the normal integration of information in V 1. Since psychophysical and physiological studies suggest that spatial interactions in V 1 may be under cognitive control, we investigated the integrative properties of V 1 neurons under different cognitive states. We performed extracellular recordings from single V 1 neurons in macaques that were trained to perform a delayed-match-to-sample contour detection task. We found that the ability of V 1 neurons to summate visual inputs from beyond the classical receptive field (cRF) imbues them with selectivity for complex contour shapes, and that neuronal shape selectivity in V 1 changed dynamically according to the shapes monkeys were cued to detect. Over the population, V 1 encoded subsets of the AF, predicted by the computational model, that shifted {{as a function of}} the monkeysâ€™ expectations. These results support the major conclusions of the theoretical work; even more, they reveal a sophisticated mode of form processing, whereby the selectivity of the whole network in V 1 is reshaped by cognitive state...|$|R
