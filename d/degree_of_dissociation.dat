40|$|Summary ‐ The {{ultraviolet}} absorption spectra of several 2 ‐thiouracil derivatives were measured at various pH values and apparent dissociation constants determined from these spectra. General comparisons {{were made with}} corresponding uracil analogues. The structure of 2 ‐thiouracil is shown {{to be in the}} diketo form in acid and near‐neutral aqueous solutions. With further increase in pH two equilibria are demonstrated spectrophotometrically, referring to tautomerism and concomitant ionization at the 2 and 4 positions respectively. The spectra and structure of other 2 ‐thiouracil derivatives are discussed. A comparison <b>of</b> the <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>dissociation</b> <b>of</b> 2 ‐thiouracil and its 6 ‐methyl analogue at blood pH values as determined from their spectra places in question the necessity <b>of</b> assuming appreciable <b>dissociation</b> <b>of</b> these compounds for iodine absorption in anti‐thyroid activity.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Chloride-sensitive {{fluorescence}} probe {{provides a}} new approach to study the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> micellar counterion <b>dissociation</b> (α). The fluorescence of N-ethoxycarbonylmethyl- 6 -methoxyquinolinium bromide (MQAE) is quenched by chloride ion with linear Stern-Volmer plots. Thus the fluorescence intensity can be used to monitor the concentration of free chloride ion in micellar solutions. The Stern-Volmer plot gave a distinct break at critical micelle concentration (CMC) due to the counterion binding to micelles. The estimated α and CMCs of cationic surfactants including fluorocarbon ones were in fair agreement with the reported experimental values. The MQAE has greater sensitivity to bromide ion of CTAB than chloride ion of CTAC. The α of 0. 16 for CTAB micelles was almost constant up to 0. 2 M CTAB at 35 ℃. The α values of CTAB micelles decreased with increasing the concentrations of CTAB and NaBr along with micellar growth.
