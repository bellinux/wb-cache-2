40|$|Infants with leukemia {{who require}} hematopoietic cell {{transplantation}} (HCT) remain 1 {{of the most}} significant challenges in pediatric stem cell transplant. Infant leukemia is characterized by a unique biology including a predominance mixed lineage leukemia(MLL) gene rearrangement and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. Moreover, the long-term effects of transplantation are particularly prominent in infants who have active endocrine, cardiovascular, pulmonary, neurologic, musculoskeletal, hearing, and vision development, with the added risk of second malignant neoplasms. Currently, there is no solid basis to support allogeneic HCT as first-line therapy for infant acute lymphoblastic leukemia-first remission (ALL-CR 1), although indicated for other infant leukemias, including juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML). The relative long-term toxicity of total body <b>irridiation</b> (TBI) versus non-TBI containing preparative regimens for HCT in infants remains controversial, with the differences, especially on neurocognitive function, unknown...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Chitosan coated {{bentonite}} (CCB) {{was prepared}} by microwave <b>irridiation,</b> original bentonite {{as raw materials}} and chitosan as modifier. The adsorption performance in acid scarlet dye solution was discussed. Firstly the optimum adsorption conditions: concentration of chitosan of 35 g/L, bentonite quality and chitosan solution volume rate of 0. 7 (g/L), microwave time of 17 min, infilltration time of 50 min, deacetylation degree of chitosan of 85 %, soil particle size of 15 mm, pH of 5, dosage of CCB of 20 g/g, stirring speed of 300 r/min, centrifugal time of 15 min, and stirring time of 35 min, were investigated by single factor experiment. And the maximum adsorption rate reached to 96. 2 %. Subsquently, all the effect tendencies of the physicochemical parameters of the preparation and adsorption were studied on the optium experimental condition, which would provide reference data for the subsequent pilot test. The results suggested that CCB was a promising sorbent to remove organic contaminants and might be utilized to purify water contaminated by organic compounds...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTwo hundred twenty-four {{patients}} with leukemia transplanted with an unrelated donor between 1991 and 2003 at the Karolinska University Hospital were analyzed according to association between graft failure and ABO, RhD, MNSs, and Kidd {{blood group antigen}} compatibility. Median age was 29 years (range: 0 - 55). Conditioning consisted of total-body <b>irridiation</b> or busulfan-based myeloablative conditioning. A bone marrow graft was given to 152 patients, and 72 patients received peripheral blood stem cells. Most patients received graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis with cyclosporine and MTX. Graft failure (GF) was seen in 6 (2. 7 %) patients. In the multivariate analysis major ABO mismatch (odds ratio [OR] 14. 9, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 2. 01 - 110, P =. 008) and HLA-allele mismatch (6. 42, 1. 19 - 34. 8, P =. 03) was significantly associated to GF. In {{patients with}} and without major ABO mismatch the incidence of GF was 7. 5 % and 0. 6 % (P =. 02), respectively. Using an ABO major mismatched graft increases the risk for GF after unrelated donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation...|$|E
40|$|As {{a part of}} a {{measuring}} program that should give us a survey of the radiation sensitivity of present commercial optical fibres we tested four more single mode (SM) and three graded index (GI) fibres at wavelengths of 850 nm (GI fibres only), 1300 nm and 1550 nm. All fibres were exposed to electron pulses of 500 rd, 3 krd, 10 krd and 100 krd {{as well as to the}} continous gamma radiation of a Co- 60 source up to 10 krd and 100 krd. At 10 krd additonal measurements with fibre temperatures of + 100 degrees C and - 50 degrees C were made at both <b>irridiation</b> facilities. After some brief comments on experimental details we present a small fraction of the results and refer to some interesting details we found til now, e. g. the enormous photobleaching in a SM fibre with pure SiO 2 core or the reverse temperature dependence of the induced loss after pulsed irradiation of a P containing fibre at very short and longer times after irradiation. Furthermore, induced losses after pulsed and continuous irra diation are compared, as well as their dependence upon wavelength and temperature...|$|E
40|$|We {{analyzed}} {{the outcomes of}} 248 (61 % male) adult recipients of HLA-matched unrelated and HLA-mismatched related donor hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) after reduced or lower intensity conditioning (RIC), reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) from 1997 to 2004. Median age was 52 (range: 18 - 72 years); 31 % had a Karnofsky performance score < 90. Follicular NHL (43 %) was the major histology. Incidence of grades II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) was 43 % at 100 days; and chronic GVHD (cGVHD) was 44 % at 3 years. Treatment-related mortality (TRM) at 100 days was 24 %. Three-year overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were 41 % and 32 %, respectively. In multivariate analysis, use of antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and HLA mismatch were associated with increased TRM. High-grade histology, ATG use, and chemotherapy resistance were associated with lower PFS. Older age, shorter interval from diagnosis to HCT, non–total body <b>irridiation</b> (TBI) conditioning regimens, ex vivo T cell depletion, and HLA-mismatched unrelated donors were associated with mortality. GVHD did not influence relapse or PFS. Older age, aggressive histology, and chemotherapy resistance correlated with poorer survival. For selected patients with NHL, lack of an available sibling donor {{should not be a}} barrier to allogeneic HCT...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{incidence}} of {{central nervous system}} (CNS) complications, their risk factors, and impact on outcome are not well defined in recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (aHSCT). We reviewed the medical records of 302 consecutive patients who underwent aHSCT for malignant and nonmalignant hematologic diseases at Princess Margaret Hospital between 2002 and 2005. The cumulative incidences of all CNS complications and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) at days 100 and 365 were 18 % (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 14 - 22) and 23 % (95 % CI: 19 - 29), and 6 % (95 % CI: 4 - 9) and 7 % (95 % CI: 5 - 11), respectively. Seizures occurred in 37 % of all CNS events in the first 100 days and 73 % of PRES episodes. Female gender and high-dose total-body <b>irridiation</b> (TBI) were identified as independent risk factors for CNS complications in the first 100 days posttransplant. Survival at 1 -year was significantly inferior in patients who developed CNS complications within 100 days of transplant (28 % [95 % CI: 17 - 41] versus 72 % [95 % CI: 66 - 77]) and PRES (27 % [95 % CI: 10 - 47] versus 67 % [95 % CI: 62 - 73]) {{compared to those who}} did not (P <. 0001). Death from graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was more common in patients with CNS complications in the first 100 days (P =. 006) and PRES (P =. 01) compared to patients without complications...|$|E
40|$|While huge {{research}} activities are being directed towards fast lithium ion conductors as potential electrolytes in batteries, {{it should be}} noted that also materials with low lithium diffusivity have many applications in modern technology. They are used, e. g., in semiconductor fabrication as non-doping substrate or are considered as tritium breeding blankets in fusion reactors offering both a slow lithium release and a fast release of tritium after neutron <b>irridiation.</b> Many of the materials investigated and discussed for the latter applications are lithium metal oxides. A well known example is single or microcrystalline lithium niobate, LiNbO 3, which is not only interesting due to its ferroelectricity, but also due to its very slow lithium diffusion [1, 2]. Here, we report on ultraslow lithium diffusion in lithium orthoniobate, Li 3 NbO 4, a cubic (space group I- 43 m, see [3]) lithium rich phase in the lithium niobium oxide system. The correlation time of the hopping lithium ions was accessed via one-particle twotimes correlation functions recorded using the 7 Li spin alignment echo nuclear magnetic resonance (SAE NMR) technique [4 - 6]. Microcrystalline Li 3 NbO 4 was prepared in a solid state reaction of equimolar amounts of LiNbO 3 (99. 9 %, Cerac/Pure Inc.) and Li 2 CO 3 (99. 95 %, Alfa). After heat treatment in a tube furnace (20 h at 973 K followed by 48 h at 1123 K) the crystallinity and phase purity of the product was verified by x...|$|E
40|$|Patient {{readmission}} within 30 {{days from}} discharge has been perceived by the Centers for Medicare and Medical Services {{as an indicator of}} poor healthcare quality for specific high-cost medical conditions. Patients who undergo allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) are often being readmitted. Our study identified the risk factors for 30 -day readmission among 618 adult recipients of myeloablative allo-HCT from 1990 to 2009. Two hundred forty-two (39 %) of 618 patients (median age = 42 years [range: 18 - 66]) were readmitted a median of 10 days (range: 1 - 30) from their hospital discharge. Median duration of readmission was 8 days (range: 0 - 103). Infections (n = 68), fever with or without identified source of infection (n = 63), gastrointestinal complications (n = 44), graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (n = 38), and other reasons (n = 29) accounted for 28 %, 26 %, 18 %, 16 %, and 12 % of readmissions, respectively. During their index admission, patients who were subsequently readmitted had more documented infections (P <. 001), higher hematopoietic cell transplantation comorbidity index (HCT-CI) (P <. 01), total body <b>irridiation</b> (TBI) -based conditioning (P <. 001), unrelated donor (P <. 001), and peripheral stem cell (P =. 014) transplantation. In multivariable analysis, HCT-CI (odds ratio [OR] = 1. 78; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 25 - 2. 52), TBI-based preparative regimen (OR = 2. 63; 95 % CI, 1. 67 - 4. 13), and infection during admission for allo-HSCT (OR = 2. 00; 95 % CI, 1. 37 - 2. 92) predicted 30 -day readmission. Thirty-day readmission itself was an independent predictor of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR]Adj = 1. 66; 95 % CI, 1. 36 - 2. 10). Our data emphasize the importance of a risk-standardized approach to 30 -day hospital readmission if it is used as a quality-of-care metric for bone marrow transplantation...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Only a {{small amount}} of solar {{ultraviolet}} C (UV-C) radiation reaches the Earth's surface. This is because of the filtering effects of the stratospheric ozone layer. Artificial UV-C irradiation is used on leaves and fruits to stimulate different biological processes in plants. Grapes are a major fruit crop and are grown {{in many parts of the}} world. Research has shown that UV-C irradiation induces the biosynthesis of phenols in grape leaves. However, few studies have analyzed the overall changes in gene expression in grape leaves exposed to UV-C. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In the present study, transcriptional responses were investigated in grape (Vitis vinifera L.) leaves before and after exposure to UV-C irradiation (6 W·m- 2 for 10 min) using an Affymetrix Vitis vinifera (Grape) Genome Array (15, 700 transcripts). A total of 5274 differentially expressed probe sets were defined, including 3564 (67. 58 %) probe sets that appeared at both 6 and 12 h after exposure to UV-C irradiation but not before exposure. A total of 468 (8. 87 %) probe sets and 1242 (23. 55 %) probe sets were specifically expressed at these times. The probe sets were associated with a large number of important traits and biological pathways, including cell rescue (i. e., antioxidant enzymes), protein fate (i. e., HSPs), primary and secondary metabolism, and transcription factors. Interestingly, some of the genes involved in secondary metabolism, such as stilbene synthase, responded intensely to irradiation. Some of the MYB and WRKY family transcription factors, such as VvMYBPA 1, VvMYB 14, VvMYB 4, WRKY 57 -like, and WRKY 65, were also strongly up-regulated (about 100 to 200 fold). CONCLUSIONS: UV-C <b>irridiation</b> has an important role in some biology processes, especially cell rescue, protein fate, secondary metabolism, and regulation of transcription. These results opened up ways of exploring the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of UV-C irradiation on grape leaves and have great implications for further studies...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWithin {{the concept}} of reduced-intensity stem cell {{transplantation}} (RIST) {{there is a wide}} range of different regimens used, and little information is available on the clinical impact of chimerism status in patients conditioned with a busulfan-containing regimen. Therefore, we retrospectively reviewed lineage-specific chimerism and the subsequent clinical outcome in 117 patients (median age, 55 years; range: 29 - 68) who underwent busulfan-containing RIST. The conditioning regimen consisted of busulfan (oral 8 mg/kg or i. v. 6. 4 mg/kg) and fludarabine (180 mg/m 2, n = 64) or cladribine (0. 66 mg/kg, n = 53), with or without 2 - 4 Gy total-body <b>irridiation</b> (TBI) (n = 26) or antihuman T-lymphocyte immunoglobulin (ATG; 5 - 10 mg/kg; n = 31). Chimerism was evaluated with peripheral blood samples taken on days 30, 60, and 90 after transplantation by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -based amplification of polymorphic short tandem repeat regions. The median follow-up of surviving patients was 1039 days (153 - 2535). The percent donor-chimerism was significantly higher in granulocyte than T cell fraction throughout the entire course, and the median (mean) values were, respectively, 100 % (96 %) versus 95 % (83 %), 100 % (98 %) versus 100 % (89 %), and 100 % (98 %) versus 100 % (91 %) at days 30, 60, and 90 after RIST. In a multivariate analysis, having received < 2 types of chemotherapy regimens before RIST was the only factor that was significantly associated with low donor T cell chimerism (< 60 %) at day 30 (hazard ratio [HR]: 6. 1; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 2. 1 - 18. 4; P <. 01). The median percentage of donor T cell chimerism at day 30 was 9 % (0 %- 63 %) in 5 patients who experienced graft failure, which was significantly lower than that (97 %; 15 %- 100 %) {{in the rest of the}} patients (P <. 01). No correlation was found between the kinetics of T cell chimerism and the occurrence of acute or chronic GVHD (aGVHD, cGVHD). The stem cell source and the addition of TBI or ATG were not associated with the degree of T cell chimerism, overall survival (OS) or event-free survival (EFS). In a Cox proportional hazard model, low donor T cell chimerism of < 60 % at day 30 was associated with both poor OS (HR: 2. 2; 95 % CI, 1. 1 - 4. 5; P =. 02) and EFS (HR: 2. 0; 95 % CI, 1. 1 - 3. 8; P =. 02). In conclusion, we found that 43 % of the patients retained mixed donor T cell chimerism (< 90 % donor) at day 30, whereas 92 % achieved complete chimerism in granulocyte fraction. Low donor T cell chimerism of < 60 % at day 30 may predict a poor outcome, and a prospective study to examine the value of early intervention based on chimerism data is warranted...|$|E
