Signing a two-year deal with Lincoln, Nutter stated — [...] "I {{think it will}} benefit {{me to have a}} fresh start, play in front of new people and show what I can do. I feel I'm better than this level but I've got to show that and we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> as a team". His Lincoln debut came on the opening day of the 2011–12 season, playing the whole match as Lincoln twice squandered a lead to draw 2–2 with Southport at Haig Avenue. He scored his first goal for the club in November 2011, netting Lincoln's third with a shot from outside the area in a 3–0 home win over Ebbsfleet United. Nutter would add to his goal tally once more during the campaign when he scored a 20-yard free-kick in an important 2–0 win against relegation rivals Newport County on 24 March 2012. Nutter played in all 51 of Lincoln's matches during the season, with the club struggling to adapt during their first season back in non-league, finishing just above the relegation places.|$|E

We could say this about professional football players, master chefs and seminal guitar players. None of these people, by EMH logic, should be seen as skilled.

2500|$|Despite the {{conflict}} and fierce resistance, the Bill continued its passage through Parliament. It moved to its second reading on 9 June, and the Committee stage on 11 June, where it became fraught in controversy after a young Liberal named Thomas Agar-Robartes proposed an amendment excluding four of the Ulster counties (Londonderry, Down, Antrim & Armagh) from the Irish Parliament. This put Law in a delicate situation, since he had previously {{said that he would}} support a system allowing each county to remain [...] "outside the Irish Parliament", at the same time saying that he would not support any amendment that didn't have Ulster's full co-operation. If he accepted the amendment, he would be seen as abandoning the Irish Unionists, {{but on the other hand}} if the amendment was carried it might disrupt the government by causing a split between the Liberals and Irish Nationalists, bringing down the government and thus forcing an election. If the Unionists wished to win the ensuing election they would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> they were willing to compromise. In the end the amendment failed, but with the Liberal majority reduced by 40, and when a compromise amendment was proposed by another Liberal MP the government Whips were forced to trawl for votes. Law saw this as a victory, as it highlighted the split in the government. Edward Carson tabled another amendment on 1 January 1913 which would exclude all nine Ulster counties, more to test government resolve than anything else. While it failed, it allowed the Unionists to portray themselves as the party of compromise and the Liberals as stubborn and recalcitrant.|$|E

(For example, {{we might have a}} rule telling us that from [...] "" [...] we can derive [...] " [...] or [...] ". In III.a We assume that if [...] is provable it is implied. We also know that if [...] is provable then [...] " [...] or [...] " [...] is provable. We <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> then [...] " [...] or [...] " [...] too is implied.

6000|$|Colour is {{generally}} esteemed by the systematic naturalist as unimportant: let us, therefore, {{see how far}} it indirectly affects our domestic productions, and how far it would affect them if they were left exposed to {{the full force of}} natural selection. In a future chapter I shall <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> constitutional peculiarities of the strangest kind, entailing liability to the action of certain poisons, are correlated with the colour of the skin. I will here give a single case, on the high authority of Professor Wyman; he informs me that, being surprised at all the pigs in a part of Virginia being black, he made inquiries, and ascertained that these animals feed on the roots of the Lachnanthes tinctoria, which colours their bones pink, and, excepting {{in the case of the}} black varieties, causes the hoofs to drop off. Hence, as one of the squatters remarked, [...] "we select the black members of the litter for raising, as they alone have a good chance of living." [...] So that here we have artificial and natural selection working hand in hand. I may add that in the Tarentino the inhabitants keep black sheep alone, because the Hypericum crispum abounds there; and this plant does not injure black sheep, but kills the white ones in about a fortnight's time.

60|$|And next we {{may suggest}} that we must take great care that we pay for the thing we need and not for some {{subsidiary}} qualification of less value. The reward must be {{directly related to the}} work, and independent of all secondary considerations. It must have no taint of charity. The recipient must not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> he is in want. Because a writer or investigator is a sober, careful body and quite solvent in a modest way, that is no reason why we should not pay him stimulatingly for his valuable contributions to the general mind, or because he is a shiftless seeker of misfortunes, why we should pay him in excess. But pay him anyhow. Almost scandalous private immorality, I submit, should not bar the literary worker from his pay any more than it justifies our stealing his boots. We must deal with immorality as immorality, and with work as work. Above all, at the present time, we must keep clearly in view that popularity has no relation to literary, philosophic or scientific value, it neither justifies nor condemns. At present, except in the case of certain forms of research and in relation to the altogether too charitable-looking British Civil List, we make popularity the sole standard by which a writer may be paid. The novelist, for example, gets an income extraordinarily made up of sums of from sixpence to two shillings per person sufficiently interested to buy his or her books. The result is entirely independent of real literary merit. The sixpences and shillings are, of course, greatly coveted, and success in getting them on anything like a magnificent scale makes a writer, good or bad, vehemently hated and abused, but the hatred and abuse--unaccompanied as they are by any proposals for amelioration--are hardly less silly than the system. And for our present purpose it really does not matter if the fortunate persons who interest the great public are or are not overpaid. Our concern is with the underpaid, and with all this affair of mammoth editions and booming only as it affects that aspect. We are concerned with the exceptional man's necessities and not with his luxuries. The fly of envy in the True Artist's ointment may, I think, very well stop there until magnanimity becomes something more of a cult in the literary and artistic worlds than it is at the present time.|$|E
