500|$|By the 1970s Tunis {{felt his}} message had been ignored or {{misunderstood}} by most Americans, saying [...] "Nobody has paid attention... There {{was a time}} when <b>I</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> do some good. But that was a long while ago." [...] This may seem surprising considering that his New York Times obituary referred to him as a man who [...] "helped educate a whole generation of Americans". Perhaps seen in light of Tunis' distrust of professional athletics, it can be understood. Though he may have felt his message against the commercialization of sports was ignored, there are those who cite Tunis as having made a lasting impact in publishing and to them personally and professionally.|$|E
500|$|In August 2010, Walker {{signed for}} Watford on a free transfer, signing a two-year contract, with Watford having the option {{on a third}} year. He made his Watford debut a day after joining the club, coming on as a 76th-minute {{substitute}} in a 0–0 draw away at Hull City. Walker also came on as a late substitute in three more games in September 2010, including in Watford's 3–1 victory against his former employers, Middlesbrough. Having made just four substitute appearances for Watford, Walker said [...] "If I'm being honest, <b>I</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> do more than I have done at Watford, I still believe I should have played {{a lot more than}} I have so far".|$|E
500|$|When Songz began {{recording}} for Ready; {{the purpose}} of the album was to crossover and increase his exposure on radio. The album's lead single, [...] "I Need a Girl" [...] was released to connect to mainstream radio. Songz said that [...] " [...] was a very radio-geared record which would do great and play on radio heavily during whatever time. It wasn't a record <b>I</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> last forever, or one I was even excited about singing, but it was a record I knew would do well." [...] Speaking of the following singles, Songz thought that [...] "I Invented Sex" [...] would be a [...] "career-defining record, and I knew 'Say Aah' would be a monster club record." ...|$|E

500|$|Asch {{suggested}} that Sherif's {{results could be}} largely influenced from the environment of a laboratory experiment. Because the experiment was designed to have each of the passages have very few differences between them, participants were faced with a dilemma when asked to distinguish between them. The experimenter and other neighboring participants may appear to find the task obvious, so the participant attends to any clues that might help him make the decision. In fear of looking ridiculous, the participant might now approach the task as, [...] "Which of these am <b>I</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> like and dislike?" [...] With the only information that varies being the author, the participant might make conclusions about the quotes based on this one piece of information that varies.|$|E
500|$|Known as an {{offensive}} defenceman {{at the outset}} of his NHL career, Pronovost played an aggressive rushing style that led Red Wings fans to call him [...] "Detroit's own Flying Frenchman". He also established a reputation as a physical player who rarely missed time to serious injury. He overcame numerous injuries, including a cracked vertebrae suffered in 1954. [...] Among his other injuries, he suffered a broken jaw, broke his wrist twice, separated his shoulder and broke his nose 14 times. By age 32, he had required over 200 stitches to close various cuts and lacerations. Pronovost viewed the injuries as part of the game: [...] "My game is a contact sport. It's a game of men. <b>I</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> get bounced and get my lumps. I also expected to play in every single game." ...|$|E
2500|$|England {{therefore}} won the two Test series 2–0, taking both matches by {{more than}} an innings. This was their fifth successive Test series win, {{and the first time}} that the English had won five successive Test series since 1971. With their first three innings all being over before the Bangladeshis made 200, the series was clearly England's, who consolidated their position at second in the ICC Test Championship table. Bangladesh remain bottom in tenth place. Afterwards England captain Michael Vaughan said, [...] "It's difficult to judge how much we've got out of these games because we've won so easily. We've not had those real tough-in sessions and fight-through sessions where we've lost a batch of wickets. We have had stages when we had to knuckle down but it has been easier than <b>I</b> <b>expected.</b> <b>To</b> win two Test matches in almost two days each is obviously quite an easy series victory." ...|$|E

2500|$|Famously vituperative attacks {{came from}} {{journalist}} H. L. Mencken, whose syndicated columns from Dayton for The Baltimore Sun drew vivid caricatures of the [...] "backward" [...] local populace, {{referring to the}} people of Rhea County as [...] "Babbits", [...] "morons", [...] "peasants", [...] "hill-billies", [...] "yaps", and [...] "yokels". He chastised the [...] "degraded nonsense which country preachers are ramming and hammering into yokel skulls". However, Mencken did enjoy certain aspects of Dayton, writing, [...] "The town, I confess, greatly surprised me. <b>I</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> find a squalid Southern village, with darkies snoozing on the horse-blocks, pigs rooting under the houses and the inhabitants full of hookworm and malaria. What I found was a country town full of charm and even beauty—a somewhat smallish but nevertheless very attractive Westminster or Balair." [...] He described Rhea County as priding itself on a kind of tolerance or what he called [...] "lack of Christian heat", opposed to outside ideas but without hating those who held them. He pointed out, [...] "The Klan has never got a foothold here, though it rages everywhere else in Tennessee." [...] Mencken attempted to perpetrate a hoax, distributing flyers for the [...] "Rev. Elmer Chubb", but the claims that Chubb would drink poison and preach in lost languages were ignored as commonplace by the people of Dayton, and only the Commonweal bit. Mencken continued to attack Bryan, including in his famously withering obituary of Bryan, [...] "In Memoriam: W.J.B.", in which he charged Bryan with [...] "insincerity"—not for his religious beliefs but for the inconsistent and contradictory positions he took on a number of political questions during his career. Years later, Mencken did question whether dismissing Bryan [...] "as a quack pure and unadulterated" [...] was [...] "really just". Mencken's columns made the Dayton citizens irate and drew general fire from the Southern press. After Raulston ruled against the admission of scientific testimony, Mencken left Dayton, declaring in his last dispatch, [...] "All that remains of the great cause of the State of Tennessee against the infidel Scopes is the formal business of bumping off the defendant." [...] Consequently, the journalist missed Darrow's cross-examination of Bryan on Monday.|$|E
