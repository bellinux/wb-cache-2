5|$|Rivoli {{departed}} Venice on 21 February 1812 {{under the}} command of Commodore Jean-Baptiste Barré, accompanied by five smaller escort ships, the 16-gun brigs Mercure and Iéna, the 8-gun brig Mamelouck and two small gunboats, strung out in an improvised line of battle. Barré hoped to make use of a <b>heavy</b> <b>sea</b> fog that had descended, to break out from Venice and elude pursuit. Victorious had held off from the land during the fog and by the time Talbot was able to observe Venice harbour at 14:30, his opponent had escaped. Searching for Barré, who was sailing to Pula, Talbot spotted one of the French brigs at 15:00 and gave chase.|$|E
5|$|On 26 March, Wichita, {{assigned}} to Task Force 39, departed the United States {{to reinforce the}} British Home Fleet based in Scapa Flow. Task Force 39, commanded by Rear Admiral John W. Wilcox, Jr., included Wasp, the battleship , the cruiser Tuscaloosa, and eight destroyers. While en route, Wilcox was swept overboard in a <b>heavy</b> <b>sea</b> and lost. Rear Admiral Robert C. Giffen, who flew his flag in Wichita, took command of the task force. After arriving in Scapa Flow, Wichita and the other American ships spent several weeks training with their British counterparts. On 28 April, Wichita departed on her first major operation with the British. She was {{assigned to}} the Allied escort for the Arctic convoys QP 11 and PQ 15. The American component, organized as Task Force 99, comprised Washington, Wichita, Tuscaloosa, and four destroyers. The British assigned the carrier , the battleship , a light cruiser, and five destroyers. After successfully escorting the convoys, Wichita returned to Hvalfjörður, arriving on 6 May.|$|E
5|$|Taiwanese aborigines are Austronesian peoples, with {{linguistic}} and genetic ties to other Austronesian ethnic groups, such as {{peoples of the}} Philippines, Malaysia, Madagascar and Oceania. Chipped-pebble tools dating from perhaps as early as 15,000 years ago suggest that the initial human inhabitants of Taiwan were Paleolithic cultures of the Pleistocene era. These people survived by eating marine life. Archaeological evidence points to an abrupt change to the Neolithic era around 6,000years ago, {{with the advent of}} agriculture, domestic animals, polished stone adzes and pottery. The stone adzes were mass-produced on Penghu and nearby islands, from the volcanic rock found there. This suggests <b>heavy</b> <b>sea</b> traffic took place between these islands and Taiwan at this time.|$|E
50|$|When {{the craft}} brewing {{industry}} experienced a contraction {{in the late}} '90s, Clipper City resorted to contract brewing to stay afloat financially. In 2003, Clipper City started its <b>Heavy</b> <b>Seas</b> brand—intended for higher gravity beers. The new brand took off; the beers under the <b>Heavy</b> <b>Seas</b> line could sell in more states than could Clipper City beers, limited as they were by insular branding. Due to the steady success of the <b>Heavy</b> <b>Seas</b> brand, Sisson and his crew decided to rebrand Clipper City beers in 2010; the beers under the Clipper City brand now sell as <b>Heavy</b> <b>Seas</b> Gold Ale, <b>Heavy</b> <b>Seas</b> Powder Monkey Pale Ale and <b>Heavy</b> <b>Seas</b> Cutlass Amber Lager.|$|R
50|$|<b>Heavy</b> <b>Seas</b> Beer is brewed by Clipper City Brewing Company, in Baltimore, Maryland. The brewery was {{established}} by Hugh Sisson in 1995. Previously, Sisson operated Maryland's first brewpub, Sisson's. In 2010, the brewery rebranded. While {{the name of the}} company remains Clipper City Brewing Company, all of its beer falls under the <b>Heavy</b> <b>Seas</b> brand. <b>Heavy</b> <b>Seas</b> hosts tours on most weekends. It is located at 4615 Hollins Ferry Road, Suite B, in the Halethorpe section of Baltimore. <b>Heavy</b> <b>Seas</b> currently offers a variety of beer styles in approx. 18 states within the United States. Several <b>Heavy</b> <b>Seas</b> beers have been awarded and include the following: Cutlass Amber Lager (a repeat medal winner at the Great American Beer Festival from 2006-2010, bronze medal winner at the 2010 World Beer Cup and silver medal winner at the 2012 World Beer Cup as <b>Heavy</b> <b>Seas</b> Märzen), Powder Monkey Pale Ale (silver medal winner at the 2008 Great American Beer Festival and bronze medal winner at the 2010 World Beer Cup as <b>Heavy</b> <b>Seas</b> Pale Ale), Small Craft Warning Uber Pils (bronze medal winner at the 2004 Great American Beer Festival), Gold Ale (gold medal winner at the 2010 World Beer Cup, bronze medal winner at the 2010 Great American Beer Festival and bronze medal winner at the 2014 Great American Beer Festival as <b>Heavy</b> <b>Seas</b> Gold Ale) and Winter Storm Imperial ESB (gold medal winner at the 2008 World Beer Cup).|$|R

5|$|The 22.5-foot (6.85m) James Caird was {{launched}} on 24 April 1916. The {{success of the}} voyage depended on the pin-point accuracy of Worsley's navigation, using observations {{that would have to}} be made in the most unfavourable of conditions. The prevailing wind was helpfully north-west, but the <b>heavy</b> <b>sea</b> conditions quickly soaked everything in icy water. Soon ice settled thickly on the boat, making her ride sluggishly. On 5 May a north-westerly gale almost caused the boat's destruction as it faced what Shackleton described as the largest waves he had seen in twenty-six years at sea. On 8 May South Georgia was sighted, after a 14-day battle with the elements that had driven the boat party to their physical limits. Two days later, after a prolonged struggle with heavy seas and hurricane-force winds to the south of the island, the party struggled ashore at King Haakon Bay.|$|E
5|$|At about 3:30am on Thursday, 25 February, Gothenburg {{continued}} to heel over. The deck became so steep that {{passengers and crew}} had to climb over the rails to get on her side. At about 4:00am, the two remaining starboard lifeboats were lowered and were rushed by the passengers. One starboard lifeboat, crammed with women and children, capsized when others tried to board it. Some half dozen men righted her in the water, but, damaged and without oars, food or water, it quickly drifted away and was never found. The second starboard lifeboat also capsized when the sea crashed over, washing all the occupants into the sea. One passenger recalled the sea on the downwind {{side of the ship}} being covered with human heads bobbing up and down like corks. Five or six men and one woman climbed onto the upturned hull. The boat was still connected to its painter, but it was unable to be recovered from the <b>heavy</b> <b>sea</b> and wind which swept the woman off and drowned her. A passenger, John Cleland, swam to the connected, but upturned lifeboat and further secured it with a rope tied to Gothenburg. In less than fifteen minutes, nearly 100 people had drowned; washed away or trapped in their water-filled cabins. By this time, several sharks were circling the wreck.|$|E
5|$|Comet was recommissioned in 1869 {{to perform}} the same duties as in the {{previous}} year; 1870 followed the same pattern as well, until the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in July interrupted Comets activities. On 16 July, Comet was assigned to the defense force in the Jade Bay outside Wilhelmshaven, but she saw no action during the conflict. She was decommissioned on 29 April 1871, at which point an investigation of her hull revealed the necessity of a major overhaul, which was done at the Königliche Werft in Danzig. Work ended in May 1872. In December, Comet was sent into the Baltic to search for vessels that had been wrecked in a severe storm, and if necessary, sink them to prevent them from becoming navigational hazards. She returned to Kiel without having located any wrecks on 31 December, in advance of the <b>heavy</b> <b>sea</b> ice that occurred in the Baltic every winter. Admiral Albrecht von Stosch, the chief of the German admiralty, did not consider Comet to have sufficiently performed her duties, and so he relieved her captain of his command. With a new commander, Comet was sent out again on 5 January 1873, and this time did succeed in finding and sinking several wrecked vessels. After returning to Kiel on 24 January, she was decommissioned, but was temporarily recommissioned from 5 to 20 March for another patrol in the Baltic for wrecked ships. During this period, a detachment from the Torpedo Division based in Wilhelmshaven came aboard the vessel to test their new towed torpedoes. On 12 March, while cruising north of Cape Arkona, Comet encountered a wrecked vessel and was able to sink it with one of the torpedoes.|$|E

25|$|One {{lifeboat}} contained 38 {{people and}} was commanded by Captain Capon.

Mr Vernon's boat transferred the Third Officer, Roland Moscrop-Young, {{to command the}} third boat, leaving Mr Vernon's boat with 34 people. Mr Moscrop-Young's boat contained 27 people and was the least crowded boat. Mr Moscrop-Young tried to get it alongside to take some people off Captain Capon's, but was prevented by the <b>heavy</b> <b>sea.</b> Capon ordered the three boats to keep together overnight and then sail for the Azores, which were about 570 miles to the south.|$|E

25|$|On 27 January 1801, Créole {{departed}} Brest with {{a division}} under contre-amiral Ganteaume, tasked to ferry ammunitions and reinforcements to the Armée d'Égypte, {{taking part in}} Ganteaume's expeditions of 1801. After several false starts due to unfavourable weather or to the British blockade, Ganteaume eventually set sail on 23 February on a <b>heavy</b> <b>sea</b> which soon dispersed his squadron. The next day, Créole rejoined Indivisible, and the two ships sailed together until they finally made contact with their division.|$|E
25|$|The {{five men}} in the {{lifeboat}} soon lost all their provisions, as they were washed out in the <b>heavy</b> <b>sea,</b> {{and they had to}} keep up a continuous bailing. They had a sail and tried to steer for Shetland. After several days, with no food and only the rainwater they could collect to drink, they sighted Muckle Flugga. Soon after they were picked up by a ship and told about the four men on the raft. Ships and planes were sent out searching.|$|E

25|$|A huge wave {{swept the}} midships {{accommodation}} block, washing away the Chief Officer, Third Engineer, Radio Officer and his wife. The crew {{of a fire}} service helicopter threw a lifebelt to the Third Engineer, Arthur Carey, who managed to catch it and was rescued. The Chief Officer landed on the monkey island on top of London Valours bridge, and was later rescued by the harbour master's boat. The Radio Officer and his wife, Eric and Nan Hill, died in the <b>heavy</b> <b>sea.</b>|$|E
25|$|Captain Lee {{feared the}} <b>heavy</b> <b>sea</b> could {{break up the}} ship. He {{therefore}} had the crew lower her motor boat and start putting people ashore. The boat completed two trips, putting ashore a total of 63 people including eight women, three babies {{and a number of}} elderly men. Then the rough sea disabled the boat and it was stranded on the beach. They were left with no shelter and only the boat's water and food rations to sustain them. Another 42 people, including Captain Lee, were left aboard the beached ship.|$|E
25|$|<b>Heavy</b> <b>sea</b> {{conditions}} saw {{at least}} 10 men drown {{at the first}} attempt to launch a boat. After one week a long boat was launched. Later, {{most of the remaining}} crew was ferried on the long boat to what would be later known as Gun Island; a flat, rocky, 800 by 350m limestone island located 4km off the reef. From Gun and surrounding islands, the critical commodity of fresh water was available, as well as vegetables, birds and seals that were combined with the ship's goods to sustain the survivors.|$|E

25|$|A USAAF {{search and}} rescue PBY Catalina mission was also mounted, escorted by 12 P-38s. C.202 and C.205s of 51° Stormo, led by Ennio Tarantola, intercepted this flight. The Catalina was taken by {{surprise}} on the surface near the Sardinian coast, having broken a propeller blade in the <b>heavy</b> <b>sea</b> conditions. The Italians also claimed to have downed all 12 P-38s, whereas the Americans claimed three or four victories over the Axis fighters with no losses.
