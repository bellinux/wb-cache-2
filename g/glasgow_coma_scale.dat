40|$|Traumatic and non-traumatic coma is {{a common}} problem in {{paediatric}} practice with high mortality and morbidity. Early recognition {{of the potential for}} catastrophic deterioration {{in a variety of settings}} is essential and several <b>coma</b> <b>scales</b> have been developed for recording depth of consciousness that are widely used in clinical practice in adults and children. Prediction of outcome is probably less important, as this may be able to be modified by appropriate emergency treatment, and other clinical and neurophysiological criteria allow a greater degree of precision. The scales should be reliable, i. e. with little variation between observers and in test-retest by one observer, since this promotes confidence in the assessments at different time points and by different examiners. This is particularly important when the patient is being assessed by personnel dealing with adults as well as children, discussed on the telephone, handed over at shift change, or transferred between units or hospitals. The British Paediatric Neurology Association has recommended one of the modified child's <b>Glasgow</b> <b>coma</b> <b>scales</b> (CGCS) for use in the UK.

5|$|Damage to {{the brain}} (such as from a massive stroke, {{non-penetrating}} head injury, intoxication or poisoning) {{may result in a}} depressed level of consciousness. When this becomes severe to the point of stupor or coma (defined as a score on the <b>Glasgow</b> <b>Coma</b> <b>Scale</b> of less than 8), dynamic collapse of the extrinsic muscles of the airway can obstruct the airway, impeding the free flow of air into the lungs. Furthermore, protective airway reflexes such as coughing and swallowing may be diminished or absent. Tracheal intubation is often required to restore patency (the relative absence of blockage) of the airway and protect the tracheobronchial tree from pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents.|$|E
5|$|Stabilizing {{the person}} is the first priority. Those with a {{depressed}} level of consciousness {{may need to be}} intubated and mechanically ventilated. Blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, and <b>Glasgow</b> <b>Coma</b> <b>Scale</b> are monitored frequently. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, admission to an intensive care unit may be preferable, especially since 15 percent may have further bleeding soon after admission. Nutrition is an early priority, with by mouth or nasogastric tube feeding being preferable over parenteral routes. In general, pain control is restricted to less-sedating agents such as codeine, as sedation may impact on the mental status and thus interfere with the ability to monitor the level of consciousness. Deep vein thrombosis is prevented with compression stockings, intermittent pneumatic compression of the calves, or both. A bladder catheter is usually inserted to monitor fluid balance. Benzodiazepines may be administered to help relieve distress. Antiemetic drugs should be given to awake persons.|$|E

A determination of possible deliberate overdose should be considered with appropriate scrutiny, and precautions taken to prevent any attempt by the patient to commit further bodily harm. Hypotension is corrected with fluid replacement, although catecholamines such as norepinephrine or dopamine may be required to increase blood pressure.

40|$|OBJECT: The {{presence}} of the apolipoprotein E-epsilon 4 (APOE-epsilon 4) allele {{is reported to be}} associated with poor outcome after traumatic brain injury (TBI). This study was performed to determine if the {{presence of}} the APOE-epsilon 4 allele influenced outcome in a cohort of black patients with TBI who had homogeneous neuropathological findings. METHODS: Venous blood was collected at the time of admission to determine the APOE genotype in black Zulu-speaking patients who presented with traumatic cerebral contusions. The frequency of the APOE-epsilon 4 allele's appearance was correlated with outcome at a minimum of 6 months of follow up. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine independent risk factors and to control for confounding factors. In 110 black Zulu-speaking patients with traumatic cerebral contusions, genotypes for APOE were analyzed. Eleven of 45 (24. 4 %) with the APOE-epsilon 4 allele experienced a poor outcome, compared with 10 (15. 4 %) of 65 without this allele (p = 0. 34). Both patients with homozygous APOE-epsilon 4 alleles experienced a good outcome (Glasgow Outcome Score 5). Univariate and multivariate analysis revealed no significant relationship in patients with the APOE-epsilon 4 allele with regard to age, admission <b>Glasgow</b> <b>Comas</b> <b>Scale</b> score, contusion volume, type of neurosurgical management, and outcome. The risk of a poor outcome was, however, greater in patients with the APOE-epsilon 4 allele (relative risk 1. 59; 95 % confidence interval 0. 74 - 3. 42). CONCLUSIONS: The authors recorded no relationship between APOE-epsilon 4 allele status and outcome after TBI in black patients. Given the high regional susceptibility to the APOE gene, further studies, possibly even community-based investigations and studies conducted in other geographic areas, are probably warranted...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the prognosis of}} mortality in patients with spontaneous subarachnoid haemorrhage associated with Terson's syndrome. Methods: A prospective, consecutive case series {{study was conducted in}} patients admitted to the emergency room with a diagnosis of acute subarachnoid haemorrhage. After a complete neurological examination, funduscopic examination using binocular indirect ophthalmoscopy under mydriasis was performed upon admission and at days 3, 7, 30 and 60 after the onset. in all cases, the diagnosis of intracranial bleeding was made by computerized tomography, and the clinical condition was graded according to the Hunt & Hess and <b>Glasgow</b> <b>coma</b> <b>scales.</b> Results: Forty-seven patients with the diagnosis of subarachnoid haemorrhage were enrolled. Forty-four cases were associated with a ruptured aneurysm and three cases with arterio-venous malformation. Fourteen patients (29 %) were diagnosed with Terson's syndrome. Seven patients (50 %) with Terson's syndrome died, whereas death occurred in three patients (9 %) without Terson's syndrome (p = 0. 002). Ocular findings in Terson's syndrome were preretinal, intraretinal, sub-retinal and vitreous haemorrhage. Associated ocular findings included third-nerve palsy, papilloedema and subconjunctival haemorrhage. Conclusion: the presence of Terson's syndrome was associated with an increased mortality rate (50 % versus 9 %; p < 0. 01). Therefore, patients with the diagnosis of intracranial haemorrhage should be submitted to a funduscopic examination, because the presence of intraocular haemorrhage is an important life-threatening prognostic factor.

500|$|The {{more complex}} {{procedure}} {{is known as}} a neurological examination, and is usually carried out by a neurologist in a hospital setting. [...] A formal neurological examination runs through a precisely delineated series of tests, beginning with tests for basic sensorimotor reflexes, and culminating with tests for sophisticated use of language. [...] The outcome may be summarized using the <b>Glasgow</b> <b>Coma</b> <b>Scale,</b> which yields a number in the range 3—15, with a score of 3 to 8 indicating coma, and 15 indicating full consciousness. [...] The <b>Glasgow</b> <b>Coma</b> <b>Scale</b> has three subscales, measuring the best motor response (ranging from [...] "no motor response" [...] to [...] "obeys commands"), the best eye response (ranging from [...] "no eye opening" [...] to [...] "eyes opening spontaneously") and the best verbal response (ranging from [...] "no verbal response" [...] to [...] "fully oriented").

500|$|In medicine, {{consciousness}} is assessed by observing a patient's arousal and responsiveness, {{and can be}} seen as a continuum of states ranging from full alertness and comprehension, through disorientation, delirium, loss of meaningful communication, and finally loss of movement in response to painful stimuli. [...] Issues of practical concern include how the presence of consciousness can be assessed in severely ill, comatose, or anesthetized people, and how to treat conditions in which {{consciousness is}} impaired or disrupted.

40|$|Purpose: Trauma {{is one of}} {{the most}} common reason of admissions to {{emergency}} departments. In this study, it was aimed to determine the demographic characteristics, etiology, morbidity and mortality rates and prognosis of adult trauma patients admitted to our emergency department (ED). Materials and Methods: Patients over the age of 18 years, who admitted to ED between 01 March 2011 and 31 August 2011 were included in this retrospective study. Patient examination cards, hospitalization files and records entered with ICD 10 codes to hospital automation system were analyzed. Patients with inaccessible data were excluded from the study. Results: During the study period, total number of 110495 patients admitted to ED, and 13585 (12, 29 %) of them admitted with trauma. Simple extremity injuries (38, 28 %) and falls (31, 7 %) were most common etiological factors. <b>Glasgow</b> <b>coma</b> <b>scales</b> of 99, 71 % of the patients were between 13 and 15. Of the patients with trauma, 9, 6 % had a Computed Tomography (CT) scan, and 84, 5 % of CT scans were evaluated as normal, and cranial CT was the most requested one. Only 6 % of the patients were hospitalized, and 0, 9 % of the trauma patients died. Falls from height in females and traffic accidents in males were the leading causes of death. Conclusion: Most of the patients with simple traumas admitted to ED can be discharged from the hospital with a complete history and careful examination. The rate of unnecessary medical tests, loss of time and waste money should be reduced, and the time and labor allocated to severe patients can be increased by this way.

Neurologic etiologies were {{ischemic stroke}} (52 %), intracranial bleeding (39 %), hypoxic encephalopathy (4.5 %) and transverse sinus thrombosis (4.5 %). The <b>Glasgow</b> <b>Coma</b> <b>Scales</b> (GCS) were 9 (5 - 11) at hospital and 7 (5 - 9) at ICU admission. The clinical sign encouraging the clinicians to think BD were brain stem areflexia (39 %), decreased GCS (34.5 %), absence of spontaneous breathing (17.5 %) and polyuria (9 %). BD was suspected first by ICU physicians in 56.5 %. BD diagnosis was delayed for > 12 hours in 11 patients because of being sure about BD (46 %), legal observation time (27 %), sedation (18 %) and hemodynamic instability (9 %). Fifteen patients had BD diagnosis with apnea and brainstem testing. The remaining 8 cases had confirmatory diagnostic evaluations of BT angiography (6) and EEG (2) due to inability of performing apnea testing (5), clinical suspicion (2) and uncomfortable feeling in giving the decision (1). Apnea testing was reported before neurologic examination in 26 %. No complication was documented during apnea testing. Diabetes insipidus {{was developed in}} 78 % and desmopressin was given to 39 % of polyuric patients. Vasopressors were ordered to 95.5 % [Noradrenaline (68 %), dopamine (18 %) and both drugs (14 %)] and methylprednisolone [60 (36 - 60) mg/day] to 57 %. Levothyroxine [300 (112 - 400) mcg] was ordered only one time to 39 % during the BD diagnosis period. Three (13 %) patients were allowed to be donors by the relatives. The therapy was withdrawn in 55 % and held on the present support until cardiac arrest in 35 % of the nondonors. No information was found for 10 % of the nondonors.

500|$|Brain {{injuries}} can {{be classified}} into mild, moderate, and severe categories. The <b>Glasgow</b> <b>Coma</b> <b>Scale</b> (GCS), {{the most commonly used}} system for classifying TBI severity, grades a person's level of consciousness on a scale of 3–15 based on verbal, motor, and eye-opening reactions to stimuli. In general, it is agreed that a TBI with a GCS of 13 or above is mild, 9–12 is moderate, and 8 or below is severe. Similar systems exist for young children. However, the GCS grading system has limited ability to predict outcomes. [...] Because of this, other classification systems such as the one shown in the table are also used to help determine severity. [...] A current model developed by the Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs uses all three criteria of GCS after resuscitation, duration of post-traumatic amnesia (PTA), and loss of consciousness (LOC). It also has been proposed to use changes that are visible on neuroimaging, such as swelling, focal lesions, or diffuse injury as method of classification. Grading scales also exist to classify the severity of mild TBI, commonly called concussion; these use duration of LOC, PTA, and other concussion symptoms.|$|E

Doctors at Guy's Hospital, London reported that, of 15 patients they treated after taking mephedrone in 2009, 53% were agitated, 40% had increased heart rates, 20% had systolic hypertension and 20% had seizures; three required treatment with benzodiazepines, predominantly to control their agitation. They reported none of their patients suffered from cold or blue peripheries, contrary to other reports. Nine of the 15 of patients had a <b>Glasgow</b> <b>coma</b> <b>scale</b> (GCS) of 15, indicating they were in a normal mental state, four had a GCS below 8, but these patients all reported using a central nervous system depressant, most commonly GHB, with mephedrone.

40|$|Background. Establishing {{prognosis}} in patients in a persistent vegetative state (VS) is still challenging. Neural networks underlying consciousness may be regarded as complex systems whose outputs show a degree of unpredictability experi-mentally quantifiable by means of nonlinear parameters such as approximate entropy (ApEn). Objective. The authors propose that the VS might {{be the result of}} derangement of the above neural networks, with an ensuing decrease in complexity and mutual interconnectivity: this might lead to a functional isolation within the cerebral cortex and to a reduction in the chaotic behavior of its outputs, with monotony taking the place of unpredictability. To test this hypothesis, the authors investigated whether nonlinear dynamics methods applied to electroencephalography (EEG) recordings may be able to predict outcomes. Methods. A total of 38 vegetative patients and 40 matched healthy controls were investigated. At admission, all patients were assessed by means of the Extended <b>Glasgow</b> Outcomes <b>Coma</b> <b>Scale</b> (E-GOS) and the Coma Recovery Scale–Revised (CRS-R). At the same time an EEG recording was performed and used for time series analysis and ApEn computation. Patients were clinically reassessed at 6 months from the first evaluation. Results. Mean ApEn values (0. 73, standard deviation [SD] = 0. 12 vs 0. 97, SD = 0. 02; P <. 001) were lower in patients than in controls. Patients with the lowest ApEn values either died (n = 14) or remained in a VS (n = 12), whereas patients with the highest ApEn values became minimally conscious (n = 5) or showed partial (n = 4) or full recovery (n = 3). Conclusions. These findings suggest that dynamic correlates of neural residual complexity might help in predicting outcomes in vegetative patients...|$|R
