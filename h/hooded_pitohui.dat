5|$|Common and {{widespread}} throughout New Guinea, the <b>hooded</b> <b>pitohui</b> is evaluated {{as a species}} of least concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. In one study {{of the effects of}} small subsistence gardens, populations of <b>hooded</b> <b>pitohui</b> were lower in disturbed agricultural habitat in the lowlands, compared to undisturbed forest, but actually increased in disturbed habitat higher in the mountains.|$|E
5|$|The <b>hooded</b> <b>pitohui</b> {{was placed}} in the genus Pitohui with five other species, and the genus was thought to reside within the Australasian {{whistler}} family (Pachycephalidae). A 2008 examination of the genus, however, found it to be polyphyletic (meaning that the genus contained unrelated species), with some purported members of the genus not actually falling within the whistlers. The <b>hooded</b> <b>pitohui</b> and the closely related variable pitohui were both found {{to be related to the}} Old World orioles (Oriolidae). A 2010 study by the same team confirmed that the <b>hooded</b> <b>pitohui</b> and variable pitohui were orioles and indeed were sister species, and that together with the figbirds they formed a well defined basal clade within the family. As the variable pitohui was the type species for the genus Pitohui, the <b>hooded</b> <b>pitohui</b> was retained in that genus and the four remaining species were moved to other genera.|$|E
5|$|The <b>hooded</b> <b>pitohui</b> {{is found}} in forests from sea-level up to , but is most common in hills and low mountains. A social bird, it lives in family groups and {{frequently}} joins and even leads mixed-species foraging flocks. The diet {{is made up of}} fruits, seeds and invertebrates. This species is apparently a cooperative breeder, with family groups helping to protect the nest and feed the young. The <b>hooded</b> <b>pitohui</b> is common and not at risk of extinction.|$|E
5|$|The <b>hooded</b> <b>pitohui</b> is monotypic, lacking any subspecies. Birds in {{the south}} east of New Guinea are {{sometimes}} separated into a proposed subspecies, P. d. monticola, but the differences are very slight and the supposed subspecies are generally regarded as inseparable.|$|E
5|$|In 1990 {{scientists}} {{preparing the}} skins of the <b>hooded</b> <b>pitohui</b> for museum collections experienced numbness and burning when handling them. It {{was reported in}} 1992 that this species and two other pitohuis contained a neurotoxin called homobatrachotoxin, a derivative of batrachotoxin, in their tissues. This made them the first documented poisonous birds, other than some reports of coturnism caused by consuming quails (although toxicity in quails is unusual), and the first bird discovered with toxins in the skin. The same toxin had previously only been found in Colombian poison dart frogs from the genus Phyllobates (family Dendrobatidae). The batrachotoxin family of compounds are the most toxic compounds by weight in nature, being 250 times more toxic than strychnine. Later research found that the <b>hooded</b> <b>pitohui</b> had other batrachotoxins in its skin, including batrachotoxinin-A cis-crotonate, batrachotoxinin-A and batrachotoxinin-A 3′-hydroxypentanoate.|$|E
5|$|One {{possible}} source {{has been}} identified in the forests of New Guinea: beetles of the genus Choresine (family Melyridae), which contain the toxin and {{have been found in}} the stomachs of <b>hooded</b> <b>pitohui.</b> An alternative explanation, that the birds and beetles both get the toxin from a third source, is considered unlikely as the blue-capped ifrit is almost exclusively insectivorous.|$|E
5|$|The {{function}} of the toxins to the <b>hooded</b> <b>pitohui</b> has {{been the source of}} debate and research since its discovery. The initial suggestion was that the toxins acted as a chemical deterrent to predators. Some researchers cautioned this suggestion was premature, and others noted that the levels of batrachotoxins were three orders of magnitude lower than in the poison dart frogs that do use it in this way.|$|E
5|$|The plumage of {{both sexes}} in both species are almost identical, with the only {{difference}} being iris colour in the lesser melampitta, the male having a red iris and the female a brown one. The plumage of juvenile lesser melampittas {{is the same as}} adults except they are brown on the lower body. Several researchers have noted that the plumage of juvenile greater melampittas resembles that of the <b>hooded</b> <b>pitohui.</b> Hooded pitohuis are unusual for birds in having a toxin, homobatrachotoxin, in their feathers and skin which can cause convulsions and death if consumed. The resemblance is probably an example of Batesian mimicry as the greater melampitta is not itself poisonous.|$|E
5|$|The {{poisonous}} pitohuis, {{including the}} <b>hooded</b> <b>pitohui,</b> are not thought {{to create the}} toxic compound themselves but instead sequester them from their diet. Phyllobates frogs kept in captivity do not develop the toxins, {{and the extent of}} the toxicity varies both in the pitohuis across their range and also across the range of the unrelated blue-capped ifrit, another New Guinean bird found with toxic skin and feathers. Both of these facts suggest that the toxins are obtained from the diet. The presence of the toxins in the internal organs as well as the skins and feathers rules out the possibility that the toxins are applied topically from an unknown source by the birds.|$|E
5|$|One {{argument}} {{in favour of}} the toxin acting as a defence against predators is the apparent Müllerian mimicry {{in some of the}} various unrelated pitohui species, which all have similar plumage. The species known as pitohuis were long thought congeneric, due to their similarities in plumage, but are now spread through three families, the oriole, whistlers and Australo-Papuan bellbirds. The similarity in appearance therefore presumably evolved as a shared aposematic signal to common predators of their distasteful nature. This signal is reinforced by the species' strong sour odor. There is also evidence that some other birds in New Guinea have evolved Batesian mimicry, where a non-toxic species adopts the appearance of a toxic species. An example of this is the non-toxic juvenile greater melampitta, which has plumage similar to the <b>hooded</b> <b>pitohui.</b>|$|E
25|$|Another odd {{avifauna}} from New Guinea is {{the poisonous}} birds, notably the <b>hooded</b> <b>pitohui.</b> In 1989, scientists {{discovered that the}} <b>hooded</b> <b>pitohui</b> is poisonous. Later, they learned that the feathers and other organs of the pitohui were found to contain batrachotoxin. Since then, six other songbirds in New Guinea {{have been found to}} possess the same toxin in varying amounts.|$|E
500|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{breeding}} biology of the <b>hooded</b> <b>pitohui</b> and its relatives due to the difficulties of studying the species high in the canopy of New Guinea. Nests with eggs of the <b>hooded</b> <b>pitohui</b> have been found from October through to February. The nest that has been described was [...] off the ground. The nest is a cup of vine tendrils, lined with finer vines and suspended on thin branches.|$|E
500|$|The toxic and {{unpalatable}} {{nature of}} the <b>hooded</b> <b>pitohui</b> {{has long been known}} to local people in New Guinea, and this knowledge has been recorded by Western scientists as far back as 1895. In spite of this, and reports of toxicity in birds going back to classic antiquity, before the discovery that the <b>hooded</b> <b>pitohui</b> was toxic, toxicity was not [...] a trait that scientists attributed to birds. The discovery of toxicity in birds, triggered by this species, sparked interest in the subject and a re-examination of older accounts of unpalatability and toxicity in birds, although the field is still understudied.|$|E
500|$|Pitohui, {{the common}} {{name for the}} group and the genus name, is a Papuan term [...] for rubbish bird, a {{reference}} to its inedibility. The specific name dichrous is from the Ancient Greek word dikhrous for two coloured. Alternate names for the <b>hooded</b> <b>pitohui</b> include the black-headed pitohui and lesser pitohui.|$|E
500|$|The <b>hooded</b> <b>pitohui</b> (Pitohui dichrous) is {{a species}} of bird in the genus Pitohui [...] found in New Guinea. The species was long {{thought to be a}} {{whistler}} (Pachycephalidae) but is now known to be in the Old World oriole family (Oriolidae). Within the oriole family this species is most closely related to the variable pitohuis in the genus Pitohui, and then the figbirds.|$|E
500|$|The <b>hooded</b> <b>pitohui</b> is [...] {{long and}} weighs [...] The adult has a black , head, chin, throat and upper breast {{and a black}} tail. The rest of the plumage is a rufous chestnut. The bill and legs are black, and the irises are either reddish brown, dark brown or black. Both sexes look alike. Juvenile birds look like adults, except that the [...] of the tail and [...] of the wing are tinged with brown.|$|E
500|$|The <b>hooded</b> <b>pitohui</b> makes {{a variety}} of calls, mostly forms of whistles. Its song is a {{variable}} collection of three to seven whistles, which can slur up or down with hesitant pauses in between. Usually the song begins with two similar notes followed by an upslur. It also makes an [...] "tuk tuk w’oh tuw’uow" [...] call, two whistled [...] "woiy, woiy" [...] notes, two downslurred whistled [...] "tiuw tow" [...] notes, and three whistles [...] "hui-whui-whooee", which increase in volume.|$|E
500|$|The <b>hooded</b> <b>pitohui</b> is {{endemic to}} the islands of New Guinea. It is found widely across the main island, and also on the nearby island of Yapen. It inhabits rainforest, forest edge {{habitats}} and secondary growth, and sometimes mangrove forests. It is most commonly found in hills and low mountains, between , but is found locally down to sea-level and up to [...] It typically occurs at higher elevations than the lowland variable pitohui and lower than the (unrelated) black pitohui, although there is some overlap.|$|E
500|$|Another {{explanation}} {{for the purpose of}} the toxins is to mitigate the effects of parasites. In experimental conditions chewing lice were shown to avoid toxic feathers of <b>hooded</b> <b>pitohui</b> in favour of feathers with lower concentrations of toxin or no toxins at all. Additionally lice that did live in the toxic feathers did not live as long as control lice, suggesting that the toxins could lessen both the incidence of infestation and the severity. A comparative study of the tick loads of wild birds in New Guinea would seem to support the idea, as hooded pitohuis had considerably fewer ticks than almost all the 30 genera examined. The [...] batrachotoxins do not seem to have an effect on internal parasites such as Haemoproteus or the malaria-causing Plasmodium.|$|E
500|$|The diet of the <b>hooded</b> <b>pitohui</b> is {{dominated}} by fruit, particularly figs of the genus Ficus, grass seeds, some insects and other invertebrates, and possibly small vertebrates. Among the invertebrates found in their diet are beetles, spiders, earwigs, bugs (Hemiptera, including the families Membracidae and Lygaeidae), flies (Diptera), caterpillars and ants. They feed {{at all levels of}} the forest, from the forest floor to the canopy, and are reported to do so in small groups, presumably of related birds. The species also regularly joins mixed-species foraging flocks, and on Yapen and between [...] above sea-level it will often act as the flock leader. This leadership role, and indeed their participation in mixed flocks, is not true across all of their range however.|$|E
500|$|The <b>hooded</b> <b>pitohui</b> (Pitohui dichrous) was {{described}} by the French ornithologist Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1850. Bonaparte placed it in the genus Rectes which had been erected {{in the same year}} by Ludwig Reichenbach as an alternative name for the genus Pitohui, which had been described by René Lesson in 1831. No explanation was given for the preference of the newer name over the established older one, but it was common to prefer Latin names over non-Latin names, and to provide Latin names to those without. Richard Bowdler Sharpe encapsulated that attitude when he wrote in 1903 [...] "Pitohui is doubtless an older name than Rectes, but can surely be laid aside as a barbarous word". Eventually however the principle of priority, which favours the first formal name given to a taxon, was applied, and Rectes was suppressed as the junior synonym of Pitohui.|$|E
50|$|They are brightly coloured, {{omnivorous}} birds. The <b>hooded</b> <b>pitohui</b> is brightly coloured, with a brick red {{belly and}} a jet-black head. The variable pitohui, {{as its name}} implies, exists in many different forms, and 20 subspecies with different plumage patterns have been named. Two of them, however, closely resemble the <b>hooded</b> <b>pitohui.</b>|$|E
