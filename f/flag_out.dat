5|$|As {{part of the}} contest's graphic design, special postcards were {{commissioned}} by the Danish host broadcaster DR to introduce each of the participating countries before the acts took to the stage. For the 2014 contest the contestants were asked to take a photo of their country's flag, made in a creative way. Austria's postcard {{was the first to}} be filmed by DR, and was shot at the Schönbrunn Palace in Vienna featuring Wurst and her stylist Tamara Mascara creating the Austrian <b>flag</b> <b>out</b> of 70 baroque-style dresses.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson {{formed a}} {{committee}} to resolve the ongoing issue {{of the lack of}} an official Canadian flag, sparking a serious debate about a flag change to replace the Union <b>Flag.</b> <b>Out</b> of three choices, the maple leaf design by George Stanley, based on the flag of the Royal Military College of Canada, was selected. The flag made its first official appearance on February 15, 1965; the date is now celebrated annually as National Flag of Canada Day.|$|E
5|$|By 1948, Braathens SAFE's routes were so regular {{that several}} {{countries}} stated that a bilateral agreement {{would have to}} be negotiated for them to continue. However, the concession that had been granted to DNL did not allow Braathens to fly any scheduled flights. Braathens SAFE applied for fifteen-year concession on 5 February 1948; Minister of Transport Nils Langhelle from the Labor Party knew that he would be violating DNL's concession by granting Braathens SAFE a concession, {{but at the same time}} he was worried that Braathens SAFE could easily <b>flag</b> <b>out</b> to another country, from which DNL would receive no protection. The exception in DNL's concession could not be used, since DNL declared that they, through the Scandinavian cooperation Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS), were planning to start a route to the far east. The Directorate for Civil Aviation stated that it was unlikely that DNL/SAS would start such a route within a few years, and recommended Langhelle that Braathens SAFE be granted the route. Concession was granted by the Norwegian Parliament on 3 February 1949, with a duration of five years. The airline had to follow the route Oslo or Stavanger – Amsterdam – Geneva – Rome – Cairo – Basra – Karachi – Bombay – Calcutta – Bangkok – Hong Kong. The concession was made conditional that Braathens SAFE built a technical base at Stavanger Airport, Sola.|$|E

5|$|Saturday's {{afternoon}} qualifying session {{lasted for}} an hour. Each driver {{was limited to}} twelve laps, with the grid order decided by the drivers' fastest laps. During this session, the 107% rule was in effect, which necessitated each driver set a time within 107% of the quickest lap {{to qualify for the}} race. The session was held in dry and hot weather conditions. Michael Schumacher clinched his second pole position of the season, his third at the circuit, with a time of 1:19.475. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Trulli who recorded a lap 0.271 seconds slower than the pole sitter and took his best qualifying performance of the season. Coulthard qualified third and said he could have set a better lap time as he saw a yellow <b>flag</b> <b>out</b> on the track. Trulli's teammate Frentzen qualified fourth but criticised Irvine for an apparent blocking manoeuvre. Häkkinen took fifth and suffered from understeer along with traffic during his second qualifying run. Barrichello secured the sixth place and reported his car was nervous. Alesi recorded the seventh-fastest time, despite experiencing alternator problems on his race car in the opening minutes of qualifying and switched to the spare Prost. Fisichella occupied the eighth position and reported his Benetton's handling had worsened. Ralf Schumacher and Irvine completed the top ten positions. Herbert set the eleventh fastest time, five one hundredths slower than his teammate and reported excessive oversteer on his car. He was ahead of Wurz in the slower of the two Benetton cars. Salo qualified in 13th position despite a misunderstanding with his race engineer over a yellow flag. Similarly, Jenson Button who took 14th in the other Williams, was caught out by the waved yellow flags. The two Arrows drivers filled the next two positions with Verstappen in 15th and Pedro de la Rosa in 16th; the latter crashed at the Raccasse chicane. BAR's Jacques Villeneuve started from 17th had an engine failure and was forced to use his team's spare car. Heidfeld took 18th and reported he experienced a lack of grip and understeer. He qualified ahead of Diniz and Ricardo Zonta in 19th and 20th respectively. The two Minardi drivers qualified {{at the rear of the}} grid; Marc Gené ahead of Gastón Mazzacane and both crashed at Raccasse.|$|E

25|$|Games are officiated by one referee {{who usually}} has two assistants, {{one on each}} side of the field. The referee is {{responsible}} for ensuring the game is played according to the laws, keeping the time and recording the score. Prior to the start of the match, the referee organises the team captains for a coin toss. The winner chooses to either kick-off or selects an end of the playing field to defend in the first half. If the decision is made to kick off, the loser of the coin toss chooses an end to defend, otherwise they must kick off. After half time the teams swap ends and the team that did not kick off in the first half starts play. The referee blows a whistle to begin each half, stop play or indicate a score. The assistant referees raise a flag if the ball has crossed the touch line or scored a goal. They can also signal foul play by holding the <b>flag</b> <b>out</b> horizontally and in some games are able to communicate with the referee using microphones. In higher level matches a fourth official is appointed who can replace an assistant if needed and is usually responsible for allowing the substitutions to enter the playing field. A television match official is also sometimes appointed and the referee can consult them if they are unsure of a score.|$|E
2500|$|The {{partially}} state-owned Norwegian Air Lines (DNL) {{was granted}} a monopoly on all domestic and international flights during the late 1940s. [...] They started the Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) cooperation and stated that they would start a route to the Far East. Braathens SAFE's charters were by 1948 so regular that a concession would be needed. SAS demanded preferential treatment, but Braathens SAFE threatened to <b>flag</b> <b>out</b> and the government gave them a concession that lasted until 1954, on condition they establish a technical base at Stavanger Airport, Sola. The airline chose {{at the same time}} to move its main base from Gardermoen to Oslo Airport, Fornebu.|$|E
2500|$|In a July 2015 {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, Anselmo {{spoke out against}} Pantera and his other band's usage of the Confederate flag claiming {{it was a mistake}} to use it on their merchandise, albums and other promotional material.

The way I feel and the group of people I've had to work with my whole life, you see a Confederate <b>flag</b> <b>out</b> there that says 'Heritage, not hate.' I'm not so sure I'm buying into that." [...] Anselmo said originally that Pantera used the image because they were huge fans of Lynyrd Skynyrd but it was never about promoting hate.|$|E

2500|$|At the time, {{opposition}} to changing the flag came from various sides, including from Confederate historical {{groups like the}} United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC). Opponents to a change of the flag stated that incorporating the Confederate battle flag into the design would be too sectionalist, counterproductive, and divisive, saying that people should show patriotism towards the United States rather than the defunct Confederacy, referring to the U.S. Pledge of Allegiance, which states that the U.S. was [...] "one nation" [...] and [...] "indivisible". Opponents to the flag's change also {{said that there was}} nothing wrong with the 1920 flag and that people were content with it. Others opposed changing the <b>flag</b> <b>out</b> of the burden it would place on those who would have to purchase a new flag to replace the outdated one.|$|E

60|$|And {{now they}} were herded in {{at the base of}} the Abousir Rock, this little group of modern types who had fallen into the rough clutch of the seventh century,--for in all save the rifles in their hands there was nothing to {{distinguish}} these men from the desert warriors who first carried the crescent <b>flag</b> <b>out</b> of Arabia. The East does not change, and the Dervish raiders were not less brave, less cruel, or less fanatical than their forebears. They stood in a circle, leaning upon their guns and spears, and looking with exultant eyes at the dishevelled group of captives. They were clad in some approach to a uniform, red turbans gathered around the neck as well as the head, so that the fierce face looked out of a scarlet frame; yellow, untanned shoes, and white tunics with square, brown patches let into them. All carried rifles, and one had a small, discoloured bugle slung over his shoulder. Half of them were negroes--fine, muscular men, with the limbs of a jet Hercules; and the other half were Baggara Arabs--small, brown, and wiry, with little, vicious eyes, and thin, cruel lips. The chief was also a Baggara, but he was a taller man than the others, with a black beard which came down over his chest, and a pair of hard, cold eyes, which gleamed like glass from under his thick, black brows. They were fixed now upon his captives, and his features were grave with thought. Mr. Stuart had been brought down, his hat gone, his face still flushed with anger, and his trousers sticking in one part to his leg. The two surviving Soudanese soldiers, their black faces and blue coats blotched with crimson, stood silently at attention upon one side of this forlorn group of castaways.|$|E

60|$|So {{the weeks}} went heavily by till suddenly, like a {{thunderbolt}} {{out of a}} clear sky, came the news, 'All safe, letters on the way.' Then up went the <b>flag,</b> <b>out</b> rang the college bells, bang went Teddy's long-unused cannon, and a chorus of happy voices cried 'Thank God', as people went about, laughing, crying, and embracing {{one another in a}} rapture of delight. By and by the longed-for letters came, and all the story of the wreck was told; briefly by Emil, eloquently by Mrs Hardy, gratefully by the captain, while Mary added a few tender words that went straight to their hearts and seemed the sweetest of all. Never were letters so read, passed round, admired, and cried over as these; for Mrs Jo carried them in her pocket when Mr Bhaer did not have them in his, and both took a look at them when they said their prayers at night. Now the Professor was heard humming like a big bee again as he went to his classes, and the lines smoothed out of Mother Bhaer's forehead, while she wrote this real story to anxious friends and let her romances wait. Now messages of congratulation flowed in, and beaming faces showed everywhere. Rob amazed his parents by producing a poem which was remarkably good for one of his years, and Demi set it to music that it might be sung when the sailor boy returned. Teddy stood on his head literally, and tore about the neighbourhood on Octoo, like a second Paul Revere--only his tidings were good. But best of all, little Josie lifted up her head as the snowdrops did, and began to bloom again, growing tall and quiet, with the shadow of past sorrow to tone down her former vivacity and show that she had learned a lesson in trying to act well her part on the real stage, where all have to take their share in the great drama of life.|$|E
6000|$|It {{is awful}} dry weather here, no rain of any {{consequence}} {{for five or}} six weeks. We have strawberries good and plenty, 15 cents a quart, with the hulls on--I go down to market sometimes of a morning and buy two or three quarts, for the folks I take my meals with. Mother, do you know I have not paid, as you may say, a cent of board since I have been in Washington, that is for meals--four or five times I have made a rush to leave the folks and find a moderate-priced boarding-house, but every time they have made such a time about it that I have kept on. It is Mr. and Mrs. O'Connor (he is the author of [...] "Harrington"); he has a $1600 office in the Treasury, and she is a first-rate woman, a Massachusetts girl. They keep house in a moderate way; they have one little girl (lost a fine boy about a year ago); they have two rooms in the same house where I hire my rooms, and I take breakfast (half-past 8) and dinner (half-past 4) with them, as they will have it so. That's the way it has gone on now over five months, and as I say, they won't listen to my leaving--but I shall do so, I think. I can never forget the kindness and real friendship, and it appears as though they would continue just the same, if it were for all our lives. But I have insisted on going to market (it is pleasant in the cool of the morning) and getting the things at my own expense, {{two or three times a}} week lately. I pay for the room I occupy now $7 a month--the landlord is a mixture of booby, miser, and hog; his name is G----; the landlady is a good woman, Washington raised--they are quite rich; he is Irish of the worst kind--has had a good office for ten years until Lincoln came in. They have bought another house, smaller, to live in, and are going to move (were to have moved 1st of June). They had an auction of the house we live in yesterday, but nobody came to buy, so it was ridiculous--we had a red <b>flag</b> <b>out,</b> and a nigger walked up and down ringing a big bell, which is the fashion here for auctions.|$|E

40|$|The Swedish {{merchant}} fleet has declined sharply since the 1970 s, {{largely because of}} the lack of competitive conditions compared with many other countries, for instance Denmark. A large number of ships <b>flagged</b> <b>out</b> from Sweden, some shipping companies have even closed down offices and moved abroad which meant jobs being lost as a result. To prevent ships from <b>flagging</b> <b>out,</b> Sweden introduced various support measures such as subsidies for shipping and TAP agreements, which would reduce the crew costs for Swedish flagged vessels. These measures have not completely slowed down the <b>flagging</b> <b>out,</b> as it has continued to do so in recent years. Other European countries, such as Denmark and Norway, chose to adopt more parts of the Commission's State Aid Guidelines, for instance the international ship register and tonnage tax, which has increased their competitiveness against Sweden. To prevent further vessels from <b>flagging</b> <b>out</b> and promote regrowth in Swedish shipping, Sweden has decided to introduce tonnage tax in the summer of 2016, which has made the shipping industry very happy. The report was written in 2016 to find out what the Swedish shipping companies require to flag into Sweden, and if the tonnage tax will affect shipping companies to register their ships in Sweden. To find out, six shipping companies were interviewed, as well as the industry organization Swedish Shipowner’s Association and one of the unions. Overall the shipping companies are satisfied with some of the actions that has been adopted, including tonnage tax and the delegation of flag state inspections from the Transport Agency to classification societies. However, they demand long-term and reliable maritime transport politics, as well as that the Swedish Transport Agency should continue to improve, for example, their customer service and the procedure of flagging into Sweden. Furthermore, some of the companies want to see that the Maritime Officers' Association provides temporary or permanent exception from the requirements to have a Swedish master and chief engineer. In the Swedish Government Official Reports, SOU 2010 : 73, parts of the proposed actions have been implemented. The net wage model has been increased and the Swedish Transport Agency has appointed a supervisor to handle the matters regarding the registration of ships. However, the TAP agreement has not become a central contract or been increased...|$|R
