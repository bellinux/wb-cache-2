One can just as easily set the electric field in the [...] direction to zero and ask what modes that gives rise to. Such modes are designated LSE{x} modes. Similarly there can be LSE{y} modes and, analogously for the magnetic field, LSM{x} and LSM{y} modes.

40|$|The <b>hybrid</b> <b>mode</b> {{operation}} for {{the reduction of}} plasma drops is being investigated. This report discusses the results obtained from two molybdenum emitter converters. One converter had a molybdenum collector {{and the other a}} nickel collector. The molybdenum collector converter was operated in a <b>hybrid</b> <b>mode</b> (at an interelectrode distance of 1. 7 mm) and produced a minimum barrier index of 1. 96 eV at an emitter temperature of 1500 K. The arc drop was calculated to be 0. 14 eV, using the published results for a molybdenum collector. On the other hand, the nickel collector converter was operated in a conventional ignited mode (at an interelectrode distance of 0. 5 mm) and produced a minimum barrier index of 2. 1 eV at an emitter temperature of 1700 K. It is tentatively concluded that a large-gap operation of the <b>hybrid</b> <b>mode</b> converter permits the diffusion of cesium ions to a distance in the order of one millimeter for an effective neutralization of electron space charge. By employing a low work function collector (1. 55 eV) in a <b>hybrid</b> <b>mode</b> converter with an arc drop of 0. 14 eV, it appears that a barrier index as low as 1. 69 eV could be achieved...|$|R
