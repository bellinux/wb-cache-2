I didn’t just want to do Dusk… again, same reason that Reign in Blood was made to sound {{different}} and clearer. I’d like people to understand what I’m saying, when a lot of the time these vocals can just sound like an orc with nails in his testes. I’ve always been deep into the occult, and would like people to hear these ideas and think about them. The thing is, and it happens a lot amongst our fans as well; especially with this record Manticore...I think because it’s grounded, it’s heavy, and it’s screamy and rough and that, but it’s very singy as well and I think there’s a few people that say, [...] "Oh, I want him to scream all the time, I want him to do this, I want him to do that," [...] and they immediately assume you’ve lost your voice when you don’t do it. They don’t seem to sit back and think, [...] "Maybe he just doesn’t want to do it all the time. Perhaps the songs benefit from having this new style." [...] That’s how it was written, that’s how it was addressed, so you <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>dig</b> your own grave.

P. Lovecraft are made more than once). Cradle's bass guitarist Dave Pybus described it as an [...] "eclectic mix between the group's Damnation and Cruelty albums with a renewed vigour for melody, songmanship [...] and plain fucking weirdness." [...] Nymphetamine debuted at No. 89 on the Billboard Top 200 chart, selling just under 14,000 copies, and the band's growing acceptance by the mainstream was confirmed when the album's title track was nominated for a Grammy award. The album's track [...] "Coffin Fodder" [...] was referenced in an episode of the Channel 4 sit-com The IT Crowd in February, 2006.|$|E
50|$|Notably, {{the player}} can only {{dig a hole}} to the sides, and not {{directly}} underneath himself. This introduces an important strategy for when digging a hole x blocks deep, the player must first dig a gap at least x wide {{to be able to}} dig through it, as the number of spaces will shrink with each layer, and the player needs at least one free adjacent space to be able to dig. However, exceptions to this rule arise when the player digs from the position of standing on a ladder, or hanging from a hand-to-hand bar, which allows the player to repeatedly dig and descend one row. This <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>digging</b> is involved in solving many of the levels.|$|R

Dynamical, self-organizing models of sentence processing predict “Digging In ” effects: the more committed the parser becomes to a wrong syntactic choice, the harder it is to reanalyze.

Experiment 2 finds a corresponding effect on reading times. Experiment 3 finds that making two wrong attachments is worse than making one.

We show that, under an appropriately formulated self-organizing account, both results stem from self-reinforcement of activations, a feature which is needed independently. We outline an implemented model...|$|R

Yes, folks: our boy is spitting game in Na'vi. And Quinn's <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>digging</b> it. Remember when I said this show was realistic with its sexual tension stuff? I take it back. Anyway, Quinn's <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> feeling Sam, but she'd rather keep her heart cold and shriveled {{so as not to}} risk her popularity again, so she tells him to take his hair and get lost. Problem is, she and Sam were the only team who stood a chance of knocking off Rachel and Finn, so Rachel and Finn cement their plan by singing a thoroughly offensive song (I'll {{get to that in a}} bit) and reuniting the giant-killers. And so succeeds evil machination #4. Sam and Quinn go on their free dinner on the condition that it soooo isn't a date. But Sam awkwardly praises Quinn's bravery after her fall from grace, while admitting his own terrible secret: he does, in fact, dye his hair." [...] Benigno continues, [...] "In any case, Quinn's heart grows four sizes and she puts away the gift certificate, because Sam, the gentleman, should pay on the first date. Sam's totally loving it, but wait till he realizes he's suddenly out 50 bucks. That's like, a month's worth of peroxide there, dude." ...|$|R

In this study, 311 and 134 scorpions were collected from Abumosa and Great Tonb, respectively and all of them were classified as Buthotus jayakari. In our study we could’nt find any scorpion. In Hengam island 155 scorpions were collected, that 134 and 21 scorpions respectively were belong to B. jayakari and Mesobuthus eupeus species. In conclusion B. jayakari and M. eupeus are scorpion fauna in the Persian Gulf Islands...|$|R
