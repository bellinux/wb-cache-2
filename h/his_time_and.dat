5|$|Cibber's poetical {{work was}} derided in <b>his</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> has been remembered only for being poor. His {{importance}} in British theatre history rests on his {{being one of}} the first {{in a long line of}} actor-managers, on the interest of two of his comedies as documents of evolving early 18th-century taste and ideology, and on the value of his autobiography as a historical source.|$|E

5|$|From the 1890s through 1906, Tesla spent a {{great deal}} of <b>his</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> fortune on a series of {{projects}} trying to develop the transmission of electrical power without wires.

5|$|Archibald Campbell MacLaren (1 December 1871– 17 November 1944) was an English cricketer who captained the England cricket team {{at various}} times between 1898 and 1909. A {{right-handed}} batsman, he played 35 Test matches for England, as captain in 22 of those games, and led the team to defeat in four Ashes series against Australia.

As a batsman, MacLaren was one of the leading cricketers of <b>his</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> had a reputation as a fast-scoring stylist.

Opinions were divided over his captaincy. He was a deep thinker on the game and critics believed him to be tactically advanced, but his pessimism, clashes with the selectors and inability to get the best out of his players led most commentators to rate him a poor leader.|$|E
