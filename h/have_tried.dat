5|$|Based on the letter, {{some historians}} <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> {{to date the}} {{so-called}} Second Swedish Crusade to 1238 or 1239, listing it as Thomas' accomplishments as well.|$|E

50|$|The {{report has}} also {{affected}} behaviour. A YouGov survey, commissioned by WCRF UK {{a year after}} the launch, revealed that since the launch 23 per cent of people <b>had</b> <b>tried</b> to eat more fruit and vegetables {{as a result of the}} report; 18 per cent of people <b>had</b> <b>tried</b> to watch their weight and 18 per cent of people <b>had</b> <b>tried</b> to be more physically active.|$|R

5|$|Another {{significant}} human {{impact is}} roadkill—dead turtles, especially females, are commonly seen on summer roads. In addition to direct killing, roads genetically isolate some populations. Localities <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> to limit roadkill by constructing underpasses, highway barriers, and crossing signs. Oregon has introduced public education on turtle awareness, safe swerving, and safely assisting turtles across the road.|$|E
50|$|Foster {{disputed the}} paper's {{claims that he}} <b>had</b> <b>tried</b> to sell his story to Granada Television, though the Press Complaints Commission {{concluded}} that as he <b>had</b> appeared to <b>try</b> to sell the story any inaccuracy about the company he <b>had</b> <b>tried</b> to sell the story to was not significant.|$|R
50|$|The journal {{for which}} he became known {{was not the first}} he <b>had</b> <b>tried</b> to keep; he <b>had</b> <b>tried</b> to write one at age 17 to chronicle a romantic relationship, but {{abandoned}} it after losing interest in the project.|$|R

5|$|As La Dispute have {{promoted}} {{their music}} on headline tours they <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> {{to create a}} play different songs and create a different experience for each live show. They have also used songs after {{a certain period of}} time: an example is 'King Park', which although was initially considered too emotionally draining for live performances, the band eventually started to play the song live. The band played 'St Paul Missionary Baptist Church Blues' from Wildlife at its first performance in September 2012.|$|E
5|$|HIP 78530 b is {{most likely}} a brown dwarf, a massive object that {{is large enough to}} fuse {{deuterium}} (something that planets are too small to do) but not large enough to ignite and become a star. Because HIP 78530 b's characteristics blend the line between {{whether or not it is}} a brown dwarf or a planet, astronomers <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> to determine what HIP 78530 b is by predicting whether it was created in a planet-like or star-like (how brown dwarves are formed) manner.|$|E
5|$|Many {{species of}} poison dart frogs have {{recently}} experienced habitat loss, chytrid diseases, and collection for the pet trade. Some {{are listed as}} threatened or endangered as a result.

Also, several artists <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> {{to produce a}} realistic portrait of Marko based on his frescoes. In 1924 Prilep Brewery introduced a light beer, Krali Marko.|$|E
5|$|Philip had no {{intention}} of handing over Amphipolis to the Athenians, but acted as if he was just delaying the transfer of the city. He seems to have gone straight on to besiege Pydna after capturing Amphipolis. The Athenians, perhaps still hoping to receive Amphipolis if they allowed Philip to take Pydna, do not seem to <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> to intervene (and may not have been able to). Pydna seems to have fallen to Philip by treachery, in either 357 or 356 BC.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scholars}} <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> {{to reconcile}} the conflicting accounts of the Chronicle and the De administrando imperio as implying a first recovery of Patras c. 805 {{as the result of}} Skleros' campaign, which was probably concurrent with the establishment of the Peloponnese as a separate theme from Hellas, if this had not been done slightly earlier. According to this interpretation, the Slavic revolt and attack on Patras followed as a reaction a few years later, between 807 and 811.|$|E

5|$|Tensions {{with the}} European Union in 2014 have {{increased}} both unions to pressure post-Soviet states {{to join their}} integration unions. Both sides have accused each other of carving spheres of influence.

5|$|The Indian Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore, {{a strong}} {{supporter}} of Pan-Asianism, met Japanese premier Count Terauchi and Count Okuma, a former premier, in an attempt to enlist support for the Ghadarite movement. Tarak Nath Das urged Japan to align with Germany, on the grounds that American war preparation could actually be directed against Japan. Later in 1915, Abani Mukherji— a Jugantar activist and associate of Rash Behari Bose— is also known to <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> unsuccessfully to arrange for arms from Japan.|$|E
5|$|The Osiris myth {{reached its}} basic form in or before the 24th century BCE.

5|$|About {{a talent}} for composition... I can say nothing as yet. You <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> your powers too little... Yes, one can study on one's own. Sometimes one needs advice, but one must study... All of us, that is, I myself and Borodin, and Balakirev, and {{especially}} Cui and Mussorgsky, did disdain these things. I consider myself lucky that I bethought myself in time and forced myself to work. As for Balakirev, owing to his insufficient technique he writes little; Borodin, with difficulty; Cui, carelessly; and Mussorgsky, sloppily and often incoherently.|$|E
