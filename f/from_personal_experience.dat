5|$|Bertie's and Lionel's {{relationship}} {{comes to}} be known to the King's advisors when there are preparations for his coronation in Westminster Abbey. It comes to light that George never asked for advice from his advisors about his speech defect treatment and that Lionel never had formal training to be a medical doctor. Lionel explained {{that at the time}} he started with speech defects there was no formal training and that the only known help that was available for returning Great War shell-shocked Australian soldiers was <b>from</b> <b>personal</b> <b>experience.</b>|$|E
5|$|Newton {{wrote the}} words <b>from</b> <b>personal</b> <b>experience.</b> He grew up without any {{particular}} religious conviction, but his life's path {{was formed by}} a variety of twists and coincidences that were often put into motion by his recalcitrant insubordination. He was pressed (conscripted) into service in the Royal Navy, and after leaving the service, he became involved in the Atlantic slave trade. In 1748, a violent storm battered his vessel off the coast of County Donegal, Ireland, so severely that he called out to God for mercy, a moment that marked his spiritual conversion. He continued his slave trading career until 1754 or 1755, when he ended his seafaring altogether and began studying Christian theology.|$|E
5|$|The San Diego {{chapter of}} JC's Girls {{is based at}} the Rock Church, a 10,000-member church with a {{majority}} of members {{under the age of}} 30. In the first year, several strippers left the sex industry and began volunteering with the chapter. Many of the chapter's members do not personally visit strip clubs but help in other ways. Scher said the former strippers were the most effective JC's Girls volunteers because they understand <b>from</b> <b>personal</b> <b>experience</b> the situations of the women they are trying to help. By 2011, members of the San Diego chapter of JC's Girls were visiting strip clubs twice each month. They pray before, during, and after each visit and a team of other members pray for them from another location.|$|E

5|$|The {{third phase}} {{received}} the least consideration, but naval planners {{were aware that}} Singapore was too far from Japan to provide an adequate base for operations close to Japan. Moreover, the further the fleet proceeded from Singapore, the weaker it would become. If American assistance was forthcoming, there was the prospect of Manila {{being used as a}} forward base. The idea of invading Japan and fighting its armies on its own soil was rejected as impractical, but the British planners did not expect that the Japanese would willingly fight a decisive naval battle against the odds. They were therefore drawn to the concept of a blockade. <b>From</b> <b>personal</b> <b>experience</b> they were aware of the impact it could have on an island nation {{at the heart of a}} maritime empire, and felt that economic pressure would suffice.|$|E

25|$|The work is {{important}} for its descriptions of the many different machines used for engineering structures such as hoists, cranes and pulleys, as well as war machines such as catapults, ballistae, and siege engines. As a practising engineer, Vitruvius must be speaking <b>from</b> <b>personal</b> <b>experience</b> rather than simply describing the works of others. He also describes the construction of sundials and water clocks, {{and the use of}} an aeolipile (the first steam engine) as an experiment to demonstrate the nature of atmospheric air movements (wind).|$|E
25|$|The Mystery of the Sea {{contains}} supernatural elements, but is in {{many respects}} a political thriller. Stoker draws <b>from</b> <b>personal</b> <b>experience</b> and incorporates historical strands from the Spanish–American War {{as well as the}} sixteenth-century conflict between Spain and Elizabethan England, using these events to explore important themes of his time such as national identity and changing concepts of womanhood. Although The Mystery of the Sea received many favorable reviews when it was published (and many of the criticisms it received could be equally well applied to Dracula), it has been significantly overshadowed in scholarship and criticism by Dracula.|$|E

25|$|William Maloney, who was {{a medical}} doctor, wrote in his 1936 book The Forged Casement Diaries of the {{whispering}} campaign in 1916 performed as a contagious disease infecting people with doubt and confusion and this is recognized by Casement's biographers. This being the case, Casement's prosecutor, Lord Chancellor (Smith), showed the diaries to Michael Collins in 1922 with the same purpose and knowing <b>from</b> <b>personal</b> <b>experience</b> that, once infected, Collins would inevitably transmit the infection to his government colleagues in Dublin, only one of whom allegedly had ever met Casement. Collins' uncertainty {{would have been enough}} to dissuade others from pursuing such a distasteful matter. But this would explain why senior officials of the Irish State have always remained ambivalent with regard to the enduring controversy over the authenticity of these highly incriminating documents.|$|E
25|$|The Home Army units {{under the}} command of {{officers}} from left-wing Sanacja, the PPS as well as the centrist Democratic Party welcomed Jewish fighters to serve with Poles without problems stemming from their ethnic identity. As noted by Joshua D. Zimmerman, many negative stereotypes about the Home Army among the Jews came from reading postwar literature on the subject, and not <b>from</b> <b>personal</b> <b>experience.</b> In spite of Polish Jewish representation in the London-based government in exile, some rightist units of the Armia Krajowa – as noted by Joanna B. Michlic – exhibited ethno-nationalism that excluded Jews. Similarly, some members of the Delegate's Bureau saw Jews and ethnic Poles as separate entities. Historian Israel Gutman has noted that AK leader Stefan Rowecki advocated the abandonment of the long-range considerations of the underground and the launch of an all-out uprising should the Germans undertake a campaign of extermination against ethnic Poles, but that no such plan existed while the extermination of Jewish Polish citizens was under way. On the other hand, not only the pre-war Polish government armed and trained Jewish paramilitary groups such as Lehi but also – while in exile – accepted thousands of Polish Jewish fighters into Anders Army including leaders such as Menachem Begin. The policy of support continued throughout the war with the Jewish Combat Organization and the Jewish Military Union forming {{an integral part of the}} Polish resistance.|$|E
500|$|Sean Moore has {{described}} {{the content of the}} lyrics as being [...] "as far as Richey's character could go". According to Bradfield: [...] "Some of the lyrics confused me. Some [...] were voyeuristic and some were coming <b>from</b> <b>personal</b> <b>experience</b> [...] I remember getting the lyrics to 'Yes' and thinking 'You crazy fucker, how do I write music for this?'". Critic Simon Price notes that the potential radio-friendliness of the song is undermined by its focus on the subject of prostitution and the recurrence of sexual swearing in the lyric.|$|E

500|$|Symeon is now {{recognized}} as a saint by the Orthodox Church. The title of [...] "Theologian" [...] was not given {{to him in the}} modern academic sense of someone who is learned in theology, but to recognize someone who speaks <b>from</b> <b>personal</b> <b>experience</b> of the vision of God. Until Symeon's time, that title was reserved mainly for [...] John the Apostle, author of one of the four gospels, and Gregory of Nazianzus, writer of contemplative poetry. His opponents derisively called him the [...] "new" [...] theologian because of his creative approach—his supporters, and later the Church at large, embraced the name in the most positive sense.|$|E
500|$|Symeon the New Theologian (sometimes spelled [...] "Simeon") ( [...] ; 949–1022 AD) was a Byzantine Christian monk {{and poet}} {{who was the}} last of three saints canonized by the Eastern Orthodox church and given the title of [...] "Theologian" [...] (along with John the Apostle and Gregory of Nazianzus). [...] "Theologian" [...] was not applied to Symeon in the modern {{academic}} sense of theological study; the title was designed only to recognize someone who spoke <b>from</b> <b>personal</b> <b>experience</b> of the vision of God. One of his principal teachings was that humans could and should experience theoria (literally [...] "contemplation," [...] or direct experience of God).|$|E
500|$|In {{describing}} {{life on a}} long sea voyage, Poe {{also drew}} <b>from</b> <b>personal</b> <b>experience.</b> In 1815, a six-year-old Poe along with his foster-parents traveled from Norfolk, Virginia to Liverpool, England, a journey of 34 days. During the difficult trip, young Poe asked his foster father, John Allan, to include him in a letter he was writing. Allan wrote, [...] "Edgar says Pa say something for me, say I was {{not afraid of the}} sea." [...] The family returned to the United States in 1820 aboard the Martha and docked in New York after 31 days. Closer to the time Poe wrote his novel, he had sailed during his military career, the longest trip being from Boston to Charleston, South Carolina.|$|E

50|$|The {{reason for}} complicating {{so far the}} plot of this book is to {{increase}} the effort and the attention required from the reader to understand this book. This is because of Gurdjieff's conviction that knowledge which comes without any effort from the student is completely useless for that student. He believed that true knowledge comes <b>from</b> <b>personal</b> <b>experiences</b> and individual confrontations actualized by one's own intentions.|$|R
500|$|Roosevelt had {{recently}} returned from his African safari, having seen, admired and shot large numbers of animals. He was scornful of Thayer's theories, which he described as [...] "phantasmagoria", and the writer as [...] "a well meaning and ill-balanced enthusiast". Thayer's suggestion that the white markings {{on the body of}} the harnessed bush buck are meant to resemble [...] "flecks of water shine" [...] is dismissed as wild, with the observation <b>from</b> <b>personal</b> <b>experience</b> that bush buck spend little time in watery places, while the [...] "situtunga or lechwe, which lack the spots" [...] spend more. Roosevelt does not refrain from harshness: he describes the camouflaged flamingo theory as [...] "probably the wildest" [...] of [...] "all the wild absurdities to which Mr. Thayer has committed himself".|$|E
500|$|Others have {{expressed}} more negative sentiments. The English pianist Ian Pace describes Sorabji's music {{as that of}} [...] "a massive ego thoroughly unaware of its crushing banality."; whilst it is unclear on which or how many of Sorabji's works such a view might have been based, none appears to have entered his repertoire at any time, so it has not arisen <b>from</b> <b>personal</b> <b>experience</b> of performing any of them. The music critic Andrew Clements calls Sorabji [...] "just another 20th-century English eccentric... whose talent never matched [...] musical ambition." [...] The music journalist Max Harrison, in his review of Rapoport's book Sorabji: A Critical Celebration, heavily criticised Sorabji's compositions, piano playing, music criticism and personal conduct and implied that [...] "nobody cared except a few close friends", although such observations were {{in marked contrast to}} the enthusiastic reception of Yonty Solomon's London performances of some of those works in his published reviews in British newspapers.|$|E
500|$|Horner's ruse of {{impotence}} {{is a great}} success, and he has {{sex with}} many ladies of virtuous reputation, mostly the wives and daughters of citizens or [...] "cits", i.e. upwardly mobile businessmen and entrepreneurs of the City of London, {{as opposed to the}} Town, the aristocratic quarters where Horner and his friends live. Three such ladies appear on stage, usually together: Lady Fidget, her sister-in-law Mrs Dainty Fidget, and her tag-along friend Mrs Squeamish names that convey both a delicate sensitivity about the jewel of reputation, and a certain fidgety physical unease or tickle and the dialogue gives an indefinite impression of many more. The play is structured as a farce, driven by Horner's secret and by a succession of near-discoveries of the truth, from which he extricates himself by aplomb and good luck. A final hair-raising threat of exposure comes in the last scene, through the well-meaning frankness of the young country wife Margery Pinchwife. Margery is indignant at the accusations of impotence directed at [...] "poor dear Mr. Horner", which she knows <b>from</b> <b>personal</b> <b>experience</b> to be untrue, and is intent on saying so at the traditional end-of-the-play public gathering of the entire cast. In a final trickster masterpiece, Horner averts the danger, joining forces with his more sophisticated lovers to persuade the jealous Pinchwife to at least pretend to believe Horner impotent and his own wife still innocent. Horner never becomes a reformed character but is assumed to go on reaping the fruits of his planted misinformation, past the last act and beyond.|$|E
