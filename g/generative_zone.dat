50|$|Trilobites grew through {{successive}} moult stages called instars, {{in which}} existing segments increased {{in size and}} new trunk segments appeared at a sub-terminal <b>generative</b> <b>zone</b> during the anamorphic phase of development. This {{was followed by the}} epimorphic developmental phase, in which the animal continued to grow and moult, but no new trunk segments were expressed in the exoskeleton. The combination of anamorphic and epimorphic growth constitutes the hemianamorphic developmental mode that is common among many living arthropods.|$|E
40|$|During {{development}} segmentation is {{a process}} that generates a spatial periodic pattern. Peak splitting of waves of gene expression is a mathematically predicted, simple strategy accounting for this type of process, but it has not been well characterized biologically. Here we show temporally repeated splitting of gene expression into stripes that is associated with head axis growth in the spider Achaearanea embryo. Preceding segmentation, a wave of hedgehog homologue gene expression is observed to travel posteriorly during development stage 6. This stripe, co-expressing an orthodenticle homologue, undergoes two cycles of splitting and shifting accompanied by convergent extension, serving as a <b>generative</b> <b>zone</b> for the head segments. The two orthodenticle and odd-paired homologues are identified as targets of Hedgehog signalling, and evidence suggests that their activities mediate feedback to maintain the head <b>generative</b> <b>zone</b> and to promote stripe splitting in this zone. We propose that the ‘stripe-splitting ’ strategy employs genetic components shared with Drosophila blastoderm subdivision, which are required for participation in an autoregulatory signalling network...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMultipotent neural {{progenitor}} species present within {{developing and}} adult periventricular <b>generative</b> <b>zones</b> can {{give rise to}} all of the major cellular elements of the brain. Although lineage specification during development has been thought to be restricted to these <b>generative</b> <b>zones,</b> we have utilized quantitative immunoselection techniques to isolate an enriched population of multipotent neural progenitor cells that express polysialylated neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM) from postnatal day 2 cerebral cortex independent of <b>generative</b> <b>zones.</b> This population of cerebral cortical progenitor cells exhibited robust proliferation in response to epidermal growth factor and subsequently gave rise to clonally derived neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. Quantitative regional analysis further demonstrated that while the multipotent cells derived from the cerebral cortex uniformly expressed PSA-NCAM, multipotent cells derived from <b>generative</b> <b>zones</b> contained equal proportions of PSA-NCAM-positive and -negative multipotent progenitor cells. The generation of individual cellular lineages from cortical multipotent progenitors could be enhanced by specific cytokines that are expressed within the cerebral cortex. Further, while oligodendroglial progenitor cells derived from cortical multipotent progenitors exhibited responsiveness to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and neurotrophin- 3 (NT- 3), primary cultures of cortical oligodendroglial progenitors were responsive to PDGF but not to NT- 3. These observations suggest that in addition to glial progenitors that commit to a specific lineage prior to migration from <b>generative</b> <b>zones,</b> there is within the cerebral cortex a separate pool of multipotent cells that are capable of generating mature glial progeny in response to specific environmental cues. Therapeutic interventions aimed at differentiation of endogenous cerebral pools of multipotent progenitors may provide a novel strategy for amelioration of the sequelae of environmental and genetic insults to the postnatal cerebrum...|$|R

In this study, in situ hybridization analyses demonstrate that BMPspecific type I (BMPR-IA and BMPR-IB) and type II (BMPR-II) receptor mRNAs are expressed at significant levels in multiple regions of the CNS, cranial ganglia, and peripheral sensory and autonomic ganglia during the embryonic and neonatal periods. All three BMP receptor subunits are expressed within periventricular <b>generative</b> <b>zones.</b> BMPR-IA is more abundant than the other receptor subtypes, with widespread expression in the brain, cranial ganglia, and peripheral ganglia. By contrast, BMPR-IB mRNA displays significant expression within more restricted regions, including the anterior olfactory nuclei. BMPR-II mRNA exhibits peak expression within the cerebella...|$|R

40|$|The ellipsocephalid {{trilobite}} Strenuaeva spinosa occurs {{widely in}} Scandinavia {{in the lower}} part of the Ornamentaspis? linnarssoni Zone (Cambrian Series 2). Its first appearance is a readily recognisable, widespread biohorizon in Scandinavia. During ontogeny, intergenal spines are lost and the librigenae develop from a <b>generative</b> <b>zone</b> in the genal region. The palpebro-ocular ridges are distinct and connected to the posterior part of the frontal glabellar lobe in the early meraspid period, but eye ridges become separate from the palpebral lobes and the glabella in the late meraspid period. S. spinosa is characterised by large genal spines, distinct axial spines and falcate pleural tips. The spines may have functioned in predation resistance. S. spinosa also has a small pointed projection at the anterolateral corners of some thoracic pleurae, the function of which is unknown. The presence of five furrows in the cephalic axial lobe of S. spinosa, best expressed in meraspides, suggests that the head of this ellipsocephalid trilobite was composed of six fused primary segments...|$|E
40|$|We have {{previously}} isolated {{epidermal growth factor}} (EGF) responsive multipotent progenitor cells from the early postnatal rodent cerebral cortex independent of <b>generative</b> <b>zones.</b> In this study we have examined the mechanisms regulating the generation of differentiated oligodendrocytes (OLs) from these multipotent cells. Although cultures of primary cortical OL progenitor cells propagated at clonal density spontaneously gave rise to differentiated OLs in defined medium, cultures of multipotent progenitors isolated from identical regions supported the elaboration of OL progenitors but not differentiated OLs. These observations indicate that the terminal maturation of OL progenitors derived from multipotent cells is dependent on signals present within the cellular environment.

40|$|To {{ensure the}} {{maintenance}} of tissues in mammals, cell loss must be balanced with cell production, the proliferative activity being different from tissue to tissue. In this article, the authors propose a new method for the quantification of the proliferative activity, defined as the S-phase fraction of actively cycling cells, by dual labeling with fluorescence and peroxidase immunohistochemistry using BrdU (marker of S-phase) and Ki 67 antibodies (marker of G(1) -, S-, G(2) -, and M-phases) after a one-step antigen retrieval. In the <b>generative</b> cell <b>zones</b> of fundic and pyloric glandular stomachs, {{where the majority of}} cells were cycling, the authors measured a proliferative activity of 31 %. In the epithelium of the forestomach and the skin, where cycling cells are intermingled with G(0) and differentiated cells, proliferative activities were 21 % and 13 %, respectively. In the adrenal cortex, in which cycling cells were sparsely distributed, the proliferative activity reached 32 %. During the regenerative process in the skin after a lesion, the proliferative activity increased in proximity to the wound. The present one-step dual-labeling method has revealed that the proliferative activity is different between tissues and depends on the physiological or pathological state...|$|R
40|$|The luminal {{epithelium}} of the oviduct (magnum) {{of laying}} quails {{is composed of}} ciliated cells and mucous cells. Ciliogenesis was observed {{in some of the}} mucous cells. Both centrioles of the diplosome migrate {{to the top of the}} cell, and one of them induces the formation of a rudimentary cilium. In some of the other cells, that are filled with mucous granules, the formation of basal bodies by an acentriolar pathway was observed. In these cells, numerous, dense fibrous masses are associated with the forming face of the Golgi apparatus. In the Golgi <b>zone,</b> <b>generative</b> complexes composed of a deuterosome and some forming procentrioles were found. Cilia develop from completed basal bodies. During ciliogenesis, the Golgi apparatus is disorganized, and generally the production of mucous granules is arrested. The nucleus is also modified: it becomes larger and the chromatin is dispersed. It is assumed that mucous cells are able to be transformed into ciliated cells in the oviduct of laying quails...|$|R
40|$|Preservation permittingpatterns of {{developmental}} evolu-tion can be reconstructed within long extinct clades, {{and the rich}} fossil record of trilobite ontogeny and phylogeny provides an unparalleled opportunity for doing so. Furthermore, knowledge of Hox gene expression pat-terns among living arthropods permit inferences about possible Hox gene deployment in trilobites. The trilobite anteroposterior body plan is consistent with recent suggestions that basal euarthropods had a relatively low degree of tagmosis among cephalic limbs, possibly related to overlapping expression domains of cephalic Hox genes. Trilobite trunk segments appeared sequen-tially at a subterminal <b>generative</b> <b>zone,</b> and were ex-changed between regions of fused and freely articulating segments during growth. Homonomous trunk segment shape and gradual size transition were apparently phylogenetically basal conditions and suggest a single trunk tagma. Several derived clades independently evolved functionally distinct tagmata within the trunk, apparently exchanging flexible segment numbers for greater regionally autonomy. The trilobite trunk chro-nicles how different aspects of arthropod segmenta-tion coevolved as the degree of tagmosis increased...|$|E
40|$|According {{to modern}} {{morphological}} concepts the entire branched annual system of floral shoots in flowering plants may {{be regarded as}} a single inflorescence (synflorescence) composed of florescences at different levels. In descriptive terms, inflorescences of most buckwheat species are complex open (in indeterminate forms) or close (in determinate forms) clusters. In the buckwheat stem, the generative zone- {{the upper part of the}} stem from whose nodes of the internodes the terminal and lateral inflorescences develop- and the vegetative zone- the lower part of the stem from whose nodes of the internodes only a pair of leaf blades develops- are distinguished. A novel mutant form of the buckwheat was identified among plants of a homostyled population self-pollinated through subsequent generations in the greenhouse. Among the 136 examined plants, a single mutant plant, which was 0. 74 % of their number, was identified. The identified mutant plant and its offspring were subsequently reproduced by self-pollination for 3 generations. In all, 348 plants were examined, of which 339 (97. 4 %) showed the mutant trait, thereby indicating high inheritance of the identified mutation. In contrast to the normal homostyled form, floriferous shoots formed both in the <b>generative</b> <b>zone</b> and in the firs...|$|E
40|$|As in some Recent arthropods, {{the link}} between {{segmentation}} as expressed in the dorsal exoskeleton of trilobites and that of ventral appendages is not always exact, suggesting that specification at a cellular level and the morphological appearance of segments may have been significantly dissociated during trilobite ontogeny. It {{is possible that the}} cellular primordia of all segments to be expressed later morphologically were specified during a short sequence of events early in ontogeny. Such a mechanism is invoked in the multiplicative model of segmentation suggested for centipedes, and could apply to all arthropods, trilobites included. This model contrasts with the additive model for trilobite postcephalic segmentation, which suggests that segments were both specified in and budded from a posterior <b>generative</b> <b>zone</b> in a gradual manner that extended late into ontogeny. Discriminating between these ideas in trilobites will require careful exploration of the dynamic relationship between the size of individual segments {{and the size of the}} entire organism. The trilobite postcephalic region also shows a dynamic exchange of segments between the transitory pygidium and the thorax. This contrasts with how tagmata are defined among living arthropods, and thus the adult pygidium of trilobites is a kind of ‘frozen’ postcephalic growth zone, following the cessation of the appearance of new segments in the dorsal exoskeleton. As such, we suggest that the trilobite exoskeletal bodyplan should be regarded as consisting of only two tagmata – the cephalic and postcephalic tagma...|$|E
40|$|Thirty-four rats were sacrificed {{periodically}} from 191 th day to 378 th {{day after}} peroral administration of MNNG. 94 lesions {{were found in}} pyloric region of the glandular stomach of rats. Histologically, these lesions were classiffied as follows: 1) Regenerative glandular hyperplasia (34 lesions), 2) Adenomatous glandular hyperplasia (44 lesions), 3) Adenocarcinoma (16 lesions). The changes of cellular proliferation and differentiation of these lesions were studied {{by means of the}} (3) H-thymidine radioautography. 1. At the margin of these three types of lesions, the tendency of increase of labelled cells and extension of <b>generative</b> cell <b>zone</b> toward mucosal surface was observed. 2. The regularities of cell proliferation and migration from neck cell to foveolar and surface cell in normal gastric glands were maintained in the regenerative glandular hyperplasia and in the adenomatous glandular hyperplasia but in the adenocarcinoma such normal cell kinetics were lacking. 3. In these three types of lesions, two kinds of different atypical cells were found, namely dark and red cell, which can not be found in normal gastric gland. They were distinguished not only morphologically but also according to the degree of (3) H-thymidine uptake. The dark cell has close similarities to the neck cell and red cell to the regenerative or foveolar epitheliar cell. MNNG induced adenocarcinomas were composed of these dark and red cells which had marked cellular and structural atypia. It is suggested that atypical proliferation of the neck cell which is induced by MNNG during repeated injuries and regeneration of gastric mucosa, might develop into the dark and red cell and finally into adenocarcinoma...|$|R

40|$|Parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) {{is widely}} {{expressed}} in normal tissues and elicits various functions through the PTH/PTHrP receptor. Relaxation effects of PTHrP on gastrointestinal smooth muscle cells were well documented, but the physiological role on mucosal growth and differentiation is little known. The {{purpose of this}} study was to evaluate the expression of PTHrP and PTHPTHrP receptor in the rat gastric mucosa, and the role of PTHrP on mucosal cell proliferation. Male Wistar rats were used in this study. Localization of PTHrP and PTH/PTHrP receptor were observed by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. Expression of PTH/PTHrP receptor mRNA were examined by RNase protection assay in control and stress condition. Double staining with BrDU incorporation was performed to differentiate cell cycle states. Cell proliferative effect by external PTHrP-(1 - 34) was evaluated by BrDU incorporation. PTHrP immunopositive cells were encountered in and around the mucosal neck area. PTH/PTHrP receptor immunoreactivity was observed in the gastric mucosa broadly. Cells with stronger expression for PTHrP and its cognate receptor were located in the vicinity of <b>generative</b> <b>zone.</b> But BrDU incorporating cells were negative for both PTHrP and PTH/PTHrP receptor. By RNase protection assay, PTH/PTHrP receptor mRNA expression was weak in a steady state, and the receptor expression increased at stress. External PTHrP-(1 - 34) did not show cell proliferative effect in a steady state. At stress BrDU incorporation was suppressed significantly, and PTHrP-(1 - 34) increased BrDU incorporation. These observations suggest that PTHrP and PTH/PTHrP receptor involve maintenance of mucosal growth and differentiation in the stomach...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Helicobacter pylori is an {{identified}} carcinogen for gastric cancer, {{however, the}} underlying mechanisms remain to be defined. In this review, we sought to elucidate the role of apoptosis in gastric carcinogenesis, to {{determine the influence of}} H. pylori infection on apoptosis, and finally to provide insights into the mechanisms by which H. pylori may lead to gastric carcinogenesis. METHODS: A broad-based MEDLINE and Current Contents literature search was performed to identify relevant publications between 1966 and March 2000 addressing H. pylori infection, apoptosis, cell proliferation, gastric carcinoma, oncogenes, and tumor suppressor genes, as well as the products of these genes. Abstracts from recent major conferences that provided adequate additional data were also included. RESULTS: Apoptotic cells are rare in the glandular neck region (the generative cell zone) of normal gastric mucosa. With progression of atrophic gastritis, the generative cell zone shifts downward and a relatively large number of apoptotic cells occur. In intestinalized glands, both apoptotic cells and proliferative cells are present in deeper portions of the glands, corresponding to the <b>generative</b> <b>zone.</b> A higher frequency of apoptosis has been observed in gastric dysplasia than in coexisting gastric carcinomas, whereas the number of proliferative cells is significantly higher in gastric carcinoma than in dysplasia. Upregulation of oncogene bcl- 2 in premalignant lesions and 'downregulation' of the gene after malignant change is probably a common event. Accumulation of p 53 protein is first detected in dysplasia, although mutation of the pS 3 gene may occur in intestinal metaplasia. H. pylori infection induces apoptosis in gastric epithelial cells, which returns to normal after eradication of the infection. Numerous molecules produced by H. pylori including cytotoxin (VacA), lipopolysaccharide, monochloramine, and nitric oxide may directly induce apoptosis. Moreover, H. pylori-stimulated host inflammatory/immune responses lead to release of a large amount of cytokines. Cytokines produced by type 1 T helper cells, such as TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma, markedly potentiate apoptosis. Gastric cell proliferation is significantly higher in patients with H. pylori infection than in normal controls, and eradication of the infection leads to a reduction in cell proliferation. Apoptosis and cell proliferation are also increased in precancerous lesions such as gastric atrophy, intestinal metaplasia, and dysplasia in the presence of H. pylori infection. However, H. pylori-induced apoptosis may no longer be cell cycle-dependent in these lesions because of the occurrence of alterations and mutations of apoptosis-regulating genes, resulting in a loss of balance between apoptosis and cell proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: It is hypothesized that H. pylori-induced apoptosis may {{play a key role in}} gastric carcinogenesis by increasing cell proliferation and/or resulting in gastric atrophy...|$|E
