She was once noted as saying: The Democratic party is one that I've always observed. I have struggled greatly in life from the day <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>born</b> <b>and</b> I am honored {{to be a part}} of something that focuses on working class citizens and molds them into a proud specimen. Mr. Roosevelt and Mr. Kennedy have done so much in that regard for the two generations they've won over during their career course.|$|E

In a statement {{released by the}} gallery, Dylan said, [...] "I've been around iron all my life ever since I was a kid. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>born</b> <b>and</b> raised in iron ore country, where you could breathe it and smell it every day. Gates appeal to me because of the negative space they allow. They can be closed {{but at the same}} time they allow the seasons and breezes to enter and flow. They can shut you out or shut you in. And in some ways there is no difference." ...|$|E

I was exciting for me to take this on as my own and do a song like this, especially with the lyrics being like that." [...] The track was composed during Rihanna's Last Girl on Earth tour. The song's instrumental was recorded by Cary Clark at The Village in Los Angeles. Kuk Harrell produced Rihanna's vocals with Josh Gudwin and Marcos Tovar at Westlake Recording Studios, also in Los Angeles. Bobby Campbell assisted with vocal production and recording. The song was mixed by Manny Marroquin at Larrabee Sound Studios in Los Angeles, assisted by Erik Madrid and Christian Plata.|$|E

Danner also claims descent from a far-off land (Colorado) inhabited by a race of super-strong, indestructible men. In order to keep his true [...] "experimental" [...] origins a secret, he tells his Legionnaire superiors, [...] " [...] place in America. A place that has scarcely been explored. I was born there. All the men of Colorado are born as <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>born</b> <b>and</b> are like me. We are very strong. We are great fighters. We cannot be wounded except by the largest shells." [...] Other examples of similarities include both of their biological fathers are scientists (Jor-El and Abednego), both grow up in rural settings (Smallville and Indian Creek, Colorado), both are imbued with a strong moral compass from a young age both lift cars over their heads, and both hide their powers from the world.|$|E
500|$|By {{the second}} half of 1814, {{following}} his long and almost continuous campaigns throughout Europe during the last ten years, the health of General Nansouty badly deteriorated. He was suffering from his wounds, some of which were very recent, but, above all from war fatigue. On his death bed, he is recorded to have said: [...] "I have carefully reflected upon all my action ever since <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>born</b> <b>and</b> in all my life, I have not done anyone wrong." [...] He is also said to have reasserted his Christian faith and to have asked that his son be recommended for the King's protection, as a favour for his services. Just before passing away, he told his son that his heritage would be to follow his example and live an honourable and blameless life. General Count Étienne-Marie-Antoine-Champion de Nansouty died on 12 February 1815 in Paris, leaving behind his wife and their only son. A pension of 6,000 Francs per year was granted to the General's widow by the King of France. His final resting place is at the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris, division 27. The engraving on his tombstone reads: ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1999, Goldsmith {{composed}} the energetic Fireworks: A Celebration of Los Angeles to conclude his first concert {{series with the}} Los Angeles Philharmonic at the Hollywood Bowl. [...] Looking back on the experience, Goldsmith later said, [...] "After starting to write {{what was to be}} a big fireworks extravaganza, I realized that I was writing about the city where <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>born</b> <b>and</b> had lived my entire life. [...] I decided instead to make the piece a grand celebration of my childhood, growing years, my years of maturity, and all the events that climaxed with my first appearance at the Hollywood Bowl." ...|$|E
2500|$|McCann {{claims to}} have no {{knowledge}} of Stanley or Maidenhead when Stanley asks him [...] "Ever been anywhere near Maidenhead? [...] There's a Fuller's teashop. I used to have my tea there. [...] and a Boots Library. I seem to connect you with the High Street. [...] A charming town, don't you think? [...] A quiet, thriving community. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>born</b> <b>and</b> brought up there. I lived well away from the main road" [...] (51); yet Goldberg later names both businesses that Stanley used to frequent connecting Goldberg and possibly also McCann to Maidenhead: [...] "A little Austin, tea in Fuller's a library book from Boots, and I'm satisfied" [...] (70). Of course, both Stanley and Goldberg could just be inventing these apparent [...] "reminiscences" [...] as they both appear to have invented other details about their lives earlier, and here Goldberg could conveniently be lifting details from Stanley's earlier own mention of them, which he has heard; as Merritt observes, the factual basis for such apparent correspondences in the dialogue uttered by Pinter's characters remains ambiguous and subject to multiple interpretations.|$|E
2500|$|The album's title, Two Eleven, is a {{reference}} to both Norwood's birthday and the day her idol and mentor, entertainer Whitney Houston, died in 2012. Norwood declared selecting a title a [...] "tough decision". About the title, she stated: [...] "Some of the titles I was working with were Rebirth, Reincarnation, Reinvention, Resurrection [...] I just felt like Two Eleven describes all of that. It’s the day <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>born,</b> <b>and</b> each year, I evolve and change with time. It also has {{a whole new meaning}} to it because I gained my angel. My icon is my angel now. It’s all tied in there and I just think it best represents who I am and the responsibilities I have moving on." [...] Dismissing ongoing reproaches, that she was [...] "trying to use the passing of Whitney Houston to sell records," [...] Norwood remarked that the title was nothing but a homage, “I need for everybody to know that, if it wasn’t for Whitney Houston, there would be no me, because she was the possibility for me. She was the vision of my dreams actually coming true, and she meant everything to me.” The official album, photograpphed by Gomillion & Leupold, cover was revealed on August 29, 2012. The deluxe edition cover is entirely identical to the standard edition but is tinged yellow.|$|E

2500|$|During {{his time}} in Romania, the {{scientist}} was involved in cultural debates surrounding the Romanian ethos. As a disciple of Moses Gaster and contributor to Anuar pentru Israeliți, Șăineanu implicitly stood for a Haskalah ideology, supporting Jewish integration into the cultural mainstream, and favored the scientific approach to Jewish history akin to the Wissenschaft des Judentums methods. Laszlo Alexandru refers to his [...] "fundamental program" [...] as being [...] "the assimilationist thesis", and explains that, for this reason, the scholar changed Schein to Șăineanu. The same commentator notes that Șăineanu disregarded Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu's publicized antisemitism {{when he became a}} [...] "fervent disciple" [...] of Hasdeu in scholarly matters. In reference to his own patriotic sentiment, Șăineanu once defined the country as [...] "twice sacred to my eyes—the land where <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>born</b> <b>and</b> where my parents sleep their eternal slumber." [...] After his departure to France, he further stated that he bore [...] "not even the shadow of a grudge" [...] on the Romanian people as a whole. According to literary historian Eugen Lovinescu, the scholar's subsequent correspondence stands as [...] "proof of sincere adherence, prolonged over decades and perils, to his country of origin". However, according to one account, when Șăineanu happened to meet Nicolae Iorga in Paris some decades after their polemic, he made a point of addressing him in French, which was interpreted as a statement of disgust with the Romanian cultural environment.|$|E
