40|$|Abstract — Motivated {{from the}} results of {{previous}} studies, we aim to evaluate the effect of antenna beampattern on the performance of <b>directional</b> <b>beacon</b> based position location algorithm in this paper. We make use of earliest arrivals to detect the line of sight components. Directional beacons are generated using four element uniform linear antenna array (ULA) at the transmitting nodes. To achieve narrow beamwidth, we design the beampattern using Dolph-Chebyshev method that provides a way to tradeoff beamwidth for sidelobes level in an optimum manner. Simulation results show that the minimum error in time estimation (consequently position location) does not occur at the minimum beamwidth. The increase in range estimation error at the minimum beamwidth is due to the significant sidelobes level at this point. Through simulation results, we show that the minimum error in range estimation occurs at 0. 33 rad beamwidth for 20 dB SNR case. I...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel {{approach}} {{to the problem of}} indoor location estimation based on IEEE 802. 11 (WiFi) signals. The approach uses a rotating directional antenna at the Access Point (AP). The Mobile Device (MD) measures the variation of Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) with antenna Direction Of Emission (DOE). The observed DOE-RSSI signature is used as a fingerprint to search a map of previously measured DOE-RSSI signatures. The method has the advantage that it works with existing 802. 11 cards and that it provides higher accuracy, for the same number of APs, than the conventional RSSI fingerprinting technique based on maps obtained using multiple omnidirectional APs. We report results obtained from an experimental testbed deployed in a typical office space. The Lighthouse algorithm achieved 85 % and 95 % success ratio in MD localisation over 20 possible positions using one AP and two APs, respectively.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. August 2008. Major: Electrical Engineering. Advisor: Tewfik, Ahmed H. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xiv, 115 pages. Ranging and positioning in {{wireless sensor networks}} refers {{to the ability to}} determine the positions of all nodes in a sensor network using the known positions of a few nodes called reference nodes and pairwise distance or range estimates between neighboring nodes. This is also known as the sensor network localization problem. In this thesis we first present two time-of arrival based localization algorithms for indoor quasi-static environments based on statistical modeling of the ultra-wideband multipath channel. A model of the multipath channel {{in the form of the}} signal return and noise characterization is derived, and utilized to distinguish signal components from noise. The first localization algorithm uses multiple (ranging) signal receptions at each reference node, to differentiate between line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight components, and to accurately estimate the position of the line-of-sight component in the received multipath signal. The second localization algorithm employs a time-of-arrival based algorithm to obtain pseudo range estimates which are then used in a spatial domain quasi-maximum likelihood method for location estimation. Furthermore, the associated range estimation error does not increase with increase in the transmitter-receiver range. We next present a distributed solution of the sensor network localization problem based on second-order cone programming relaxation. This algorithm is independent of the ranging technique being used and is computationally more efficient than most contemporary approaches, and scalable to networks with thousands of nodes. We show that the nodes can estimate their positions based on local information. Unlike previous approaches, we also consider the effect of inaccurate reference node positions. In the presence of reference node position errors, the localization is performed in three steps. First, the unlocalized nodes estimate their positions using information from their neighbors. In the second step, the reference nodes refine their positions using relative distance information exchanged with their neighbors and finally, the previously unlocalized nodes refine their position estimates. We demonstrate the convergence of the algorithm numerically. The simulation results, shown for both uniform and irregular network topologies, illustrate the robustness of the algorithm to reference node position and distance estimation errors. We also present the prototype implementation of a <b>directional</b> <b>beacon</b> based positioning algorithm using radio frequency signals. This algorithm allows each unlocalized node to compute its position with respect to a set of reference nodes which are equipped with rotating directional antenna. The <b>directional</b> <b>beacon</b> based algorithm eliminates the need for strict synchronization between the reference nodes and the unlocalized node. In contrast to time-of-arrival based positioning algorithms that rely on signal propagation time and bandwidth, the <b>directional</b> <b>beacon</b> based algorithm depends on the width of the antenna beampattern and the rotational speed of the directional antenna. We will show that these parameters can be optimized in a low cost solution while providing good position estimates. The system implementation is based on the GNU Radio software platform and the Universal Software Radio Peripheral as the hardware component. To deal with obstructed line-of-sight scenarios, we do not rely purely on the received signal strength and instead formulate a least squares problem to estimate the line-of-sight component in a multipath environment. These signal processing techniques yield a more accurate estimation of the bearing of the unlocalized node with respect to each of the reference nodes. We demonstrate the ability to obtain unlocalized node position estimates with sub-meter accuracy by transmitting a narrowband signal of 1 KHz bandwidth in the 2. 4 GHz band. Finally, event detection scenarios in sensor networks are considered. The goal in these network deployments is to detect certain critical or emergency conditions with minimum possible delay. We propose a heuristic based sensor selection and a sequential detection procedure that significantly improves the detection speed, measured in terms of the number of measurements needed for detection. In the proposed model, the fusion center selects one sensor at a time for measurement while maximizing a greedy heuristic. Instead of collecting a fixed number of measurements, the fusion center collects one measurement at each time step, until by some sequential decision rule the collection stops and a decision is made. The sequential detection procedure significantly outperforms a non-sequential (or fixed sample size) detector in that it always needs fewer measurements on average to achieve the same detection performance. In addition, we derive a simplified heuristic under the Gaussian probabilistic model. It is seen that the simplified heuristic performs as good as or slightly better than the greedy heuristic. The greedy heuristic based sensor selection provides a general framework for probabilistic models where a simplified heuristic is difficult to obtain. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In recent years, the {{incorporation}} of the directional antennas within mobile devices has been studied in many areas. The usage of directional antennas can greatly reduce the radio interference, which results in improved utilization of the wireless medium. It becomes practical to exploit the directional antennas in the Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol design. In this paper, a Location and Mobility Aware (LMA) MAC protocol is developed for the vehicular ad hoc networks. The predictive location and mobility of the vehicles are adopted to provide robust communication links while using the directional beams. The deafness problem is also alleviated using the directional listen (D-Listen) mechanism in the proposed algorithm. Moreover, the exploitation of the <b>Directional</b> <b>Beacons</b> (DBs) within the scheme can enhance {{the reliability of the}} communication linkages even the moving directions and speeds of the vehicles have been changed. Under dynamic moving scenarios, both the spatial reuse and the routing efficiency are preserved using the proposed LMA MAC scheme. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated and compared with other existing MAC protocols in simulations.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel method for indoor {{location}} estimation using an unmodified mobile device (MD) in an IEEE 802. 11 wireless local area network. In this method, <b>Directional</b> <b>Beaconing</b> {{is combined with}} Fingerprinting whereby the WiFi access points (APs) transmit a narrow beamwidth signal switching between {{a small number of}} fixed directions of emission (DOEs) and the MD records the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) for all in-range APs and all DOEs. These observations give a DOE-RSSI signatures at the MD for each AP. The location of the MD is determined using a K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm which finds the best matching DOE-RSSI signature in a pre-stored map. The method improves on previous omnidirectional fingerprinting methods by increasing the number of RSSI maps available per AP. A testbed network was deployed in an office building and its performance was evaluated. The results show a reduction in mean location error from 2. 87 m to 1. 64 m (43 % improvement) for the proposed method compared with conventional omnidirectional RSSI fingerprinting, when using 3 APs in a positioning space of 12 m by 13. 5 m...|$|R
40|$|Underwater Sensor Networks (UWSN) {{are widely}} used in many applications, such as oceanic {{resource}} exploration, pollution monitoring, tsunami warnings and mine reconnaissance. In UWSNs, determining the location information of each sensor node is a critical issue, because many services {{are based on the}} localization results. In this paper, we introduce a novel underwater localization approach based on directional signals, which are transmitted by an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). Our method utilizes <b>directional</b> <b>beacons</b> (UDB) to replace traditional omnidirectional localization which provides more accurate and efficient ways to locate the sensors themselves by simple calculations. The advantage of this novel scheme is that the communications between AUV and sensors are not necessary because the AUV broadcasts signals and sensors only need to passively listen to the signals. Since the energy consumption for transmissions in underwater environments is a nontrivial factor, our localization scheme not only supports accurate positioning, but also reduces energy consumption of sensors. We evaluate our scheme by simulations. The results show that our new approach is very precise in a strap area. At the same time, we minimize the number of beacons issued from the AUV. © 2008 IEEE...|$|R
