At sufficiently low temperatures, the interaction-induced magnetization overwhelms the Landau and Pauli contributions. Curiously, the interaction-induced magnetization is third-order in the (renormalized) Coulomb interaction. We give a simple interpretation of this effect in terms of classical paths using a renormalization argument: a polygon must have at least three sides in order to enclose an area.

Reaction of methane with platinum or ruthenium supported on Ce_(1 -x) Zr_xO_ 2 (x= 0, 0. 2, 0. 5) in the absence of gaseous oxygen was studied in a packed-bed reactor at 550 - 700 °C. The oxidation of methane utilized lattice oxygen of the support, which was subsequently restored by reacting with oxygen in a separate step. Thus, by using theredox property of cerium oxide, methane oxidation can be carried out by air without diluting the product with nitrogen. Addition of ZrO_ 2 into CeO_ 2 increased the reducibility of the oxide as well as the rate of methane oxidation but decreased the selectivity to CO and H_ 2.

40|$|We {{develop a}} {{systematic}} theory of microwave-induced oscillations in the magnetoresistivity of a two-dimensional electron <b>gas,</b> <b>focusing</b> on {{the regime of}} strongly overlapping Landau levels. At linear order in microwave power, two novel mechanisms of the oscillations (``quadrupole'' and ``photovoltaic'') are identified, {{in addition to those}} studied before (``displacement'' and ``inelastic''). The quadrupole and photovoltaic mechanisms are shown to be the only ones that give rise to oscillations in the nondiagonal part of the photoconductivity tensor. In the diagonal part, the inelastic contribution dominates at moderate microwave power, while at elevated power the other mechanisms become relevant. We demonstrate the crucial role of feedback effects, which lead to a strong interplay of the four mechanisms in the nonlinear photoresponse and yield, in particular, a nonmonotonic power dependence of the photoconductivity, narrowing of the magnetoresonances, and a nontrivial structure of the Hall photoresponse. At ultrahigh power, all effects related to the Landau quantization decay due to a combination of the feedback and multiphoton effects, restoring the classical Drude conductivity.

40|$|Over {{the past}} several years of ONR support for our {{research}} program we have mainly studied the various schemes for intense, high-brightness H- beam transport and focusing in the context of its application in space defense. Detailed theoretical studies revealed that the conventional <b>gas</b> <b>focusing</b> system is not suitable as a low-energy beam transport (LEBT) system and also that there are too many unknown parameters to model accurately the be-havior of partially charge-neutralized particle beams.

40|$|Phase {{transitions}} are {{ubiquitous in}} nature, ranging from protein folding and denaturisation, to the superconductor-insulator quantum phase transition, to the decoupling of {{forces in the}} early universe. Remarkably, phase transitions can be arranged into universality classes, where systems having unrelated microscopic physics exhibit identical scaling behaviour near the critical point. Here we present an experimental and theoretical study of the Bose-Einstein condensation phase transition of an atomic <b>gas,</b> <b>focusing</b> on one prominent universal element of phase transition dynamics: the spontaneous formation of topological defects during a quench through the transition. While the microscopic dynamics of defect formation in phase transitions are generally difficult to investigate, particularly for superfluid phase transitions, Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) offer unique experimental and theoretical opportunities for probing such details. Although spontaneously formed vortices in the condensation transition have been previously predicted to occur, our results encompass the first experimental observations and statistical characterisation of spontaneous vortex formation in the condensation transition. Using microscopic theories that incorporate atomic interactions and quantum and thermal fluctuations of a finite-temperature Bose gas, we simulate condensation and observe vortex formation in close quantitative agreement with our experimental results. Our studies provide further understanding {{of the development of}} coherence in superfluids, and may allow for direct investigation of universal phase-transition dynamics.

Among these are self-phase modulation, nonlinear self-focusing, plasma generation, and group velocity dispersion. The combination of these factors leads to an asymmetric spectrum. If group velocity dispersion cannot arrest nonlinear self-focusing, self-phase modulation, coupled with nonlinear self-focusing, gives rise to a red shifted spectrum. In case plasma is generated, large blue shifted components are observed. The maximum blue shift is determined by both the maximum value of the electron density, and the distance over which the plasma extends. Finally, the injection of laser pulses into hydrodynamically preformed plasma channels is investigated. The injection of laser pulses into hydrodynamically preformed plasma channels can be hindered by the conditions at the entrance of the channel. In particular, neutral gas and narrowing of the channel prevent efficient coupling of laser pulse entering into the channel. To solve this problem, a funnel shaped plasma lens can be grafted onto the channel using an auxiliary formation pulse. Simulations of channel formation show that such a funnel can be made in the density ramp of a gas jet. Simulations of laser pulse propagation show that such a funnel efficiently couples pulse energy into the channel. For a backfill target with a funnel, the coupling efficiency is lower and required funnel parameters are more restrictive than for the gas jet case...|$|E
