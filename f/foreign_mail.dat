By special arrangement, as an inducement to use the Austrian service for <b>foreign</b> <b>mail</b> as well, the Austrian post transported letters and cards between these Jewish settlements free of charge. The use of local or JNF labels on such postal matter was totally without any need and is known on philatelic items only.|$|E

6000|$|Anything like unmitigated {{acceptance}} of my [...] "Leaves of Grass" [...] book, and heart-felt response to it, {{in a popular}} however faint degree, bubbled forth as a fresh spring from the ground in England in 1876. The time was a critical and turning point in my personal and literary life. Let me revert to my memorandum book, Camden, New Jersey, that year, fill'd with addresses, receipts, purchases, &c., of the two volumes pub'd then by myself--the [...] "Leaves," [...] and the [...] "Two Rivulets"--some home customers, for them, but mostly from the British Islands. I was seriously paralyzed from the Secession war, poor, in debt, was expecting death, (the doctors put four chances out of five against me,)--and I had the books printed during the lingering interim to occupy the tediousness of glum days and nights. Curiously, the sale abroad proved prompt, and {{what one might call}} copious: the names came in lists and the money with them, by <b>foreign</b> <b>mail.</b> The price was $10 a set. Both the cash and the emotional cheer were deep medicines; many paid double or treble price, (Tennyson and Ruskin did,) and many sent kind and eulogistic letters; ladies, clergymen, social leaders, persons of rank, and high officials. Those blessed gales from the British Islands probably (certainly) saved me. Here are some of the names, for I w'd like to preserve them: Wm. M. and D.G. Rossetti, Lord Houghton, Edwd. Dowden, Mrs. Anne Gilchrist, Keningale Cook, Edwd. Carpenter, Therese Simpson, Rob't Buchanan, Alfred Tennyson, John Ruskin, C.G. Gates, E.T. Wilkinson, T.L. Warren, C.W. Reynell, W.B. Scott, A.G.

50|$|After various claims {{had been}} considered, on 21 March 1652 Parliament {{resolved}} {{that the office}} of postmaster ought {{to be at the}} sole disposal of the House of Commons, and the Irish and the Scotch committee, to which the question was referred, reported in favour of letting contracts for the carriage of letters. Prideaux contended that the office of postmaster and the carrying of letters were two distinct things, and that the 1652 resolution of Parliament referred to the former only; but eventually all previous grants were held to be set aside by that resolution, and in 1653 contracts were let for the inland and <b>foreign</b> <b>mails</b> to John Manley.|$|R
2500|$|When the USPS {{began to}} service all {{international}} First Class mails by air without additional charge in 1995 and simultaneously eliminated Surface (or [...] "Sea") service which provided transportation by ship, it also {{announced that the}} words [...] "Air Mail" [...] would no longer appear on any U.S. postage stamps However a stamp denominated for <b>foreign</b> <b>mailing,</b> and showing a small airplane silhouette, {{is considered to be}} the final [...] "air mail" [...] issue. [...] It was issued in 2012.

5000|$|The United States Internal Revenue Service has {{excluded}} some regulations such as Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) from tax treaties {{that protect}} double taxation. [...] In its current format even if US citizens are paying income taxes {{at a rate}} of 56%, far above the maximum US marginal tax rate, the citizen can be subject to US taxes because the calculation of the Alternative Minimum Tax does not allow full deduction for taxes paid to a foreign country. Other regulations such as the post date of <b>foreign</b> <b>mailed</b> tax returns are not recognized and can result in penalties for late filing if they arrive at the IRS later than the filing date. However, the filing date for overseas citizens has a two-month automatic extension to June 15.|$|R

50|$|Infrastructure was poorly {{maintained}} {{during this}} period. Roads could only carry lighter vehicles, while poorly maintained bridges hampered car transport.

The checks were to be used to purchase goods in the Vneshposyltorg Beriozkas.|$|E

2500|$|In 1653 Parliament {{set aside}} all {{previous}} grants for postal services, and contracts were let for the inland and <b>foreign</b> <b>mails</b> to John Manley. Manley {{was given a}} monopoly on the postal service, which was effectively enforced by Protector Oliver Cromwell's government, {{and thanks to the}} improvements necessitated by the war Manley ran a much improved Post Office service. In July 1655 the Post Office was put under the direct government control of John Thurloe, a Secretary of State, and best known to history as Cromwell's spymaster general. Previous English governments had tried to prevent conspirators communicating, Thurloe preferred to deliver their post having surreptitiously read it. As the Protectorate claimed to govern all of Great Britain and Ireland under one unified government, on 9 June 1657 the Second Protectorate Parliament (which included Scottish and Irish MPs) passed the [...] "Act for settling the Postage in England, Scotland and Ireland" [...] that created one monopoly Post Office for the whole territory of the Commonwealth. The first Postmaster General was appointed in 1661, and a seal was first fixed to the mail.|$|R
5000|$|In 1632, Charles I {{appointed}} Thomas Witherings as the Postmaster of <b>foreign</b> <b>mails.</b> Three {{years later}} Witherings proposed to Charles's Council to [...] "settle a pacquet post between London and {{all parts of}} His Majesty's dominions, for the carrying and recarrying of his subjects letters." [...] To justify the expenditure Witherings suggested that [...] "anie fight at sea, anie distress of His Majestie's ships (which God forbid), anie wrong offered by anie nation to anie of ye coastes of England or anie of His Majestie's forts...the newes will come sooner than thought," [...] implying {{that the reason for}} this innovation was to provide better defence of the realm. Two years later a state letter monopoly formally came into being and the public institution of the Post Office was created. It was used to raise revenues to sponsor state activities including war. Under Witherings' organisation a public postal service was established with post offices connected by regular routes established, throughout the country, along the lines of communication used by the Tudor armies. A conveyance tariff was fixed. Postage was paid on receipt of the letter by the addressee and remained so until the Rowland Hill reforms of the 1840s.|$|R
