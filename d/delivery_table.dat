An unwitting, young Nikki Reed signed on and became entangled {{in the death of}} a businessman, Walter Addison. Rose later ran a home for unwed mothers while actually operating a black-market baby ring. She took a teenage Nina Webster under her wing, only to later abandon her on the <b>delivery</b> <b>table</b> and kidnap her son. Nina was led to believe the baby was stillborn. Eventually learning the truth, however, it was too late: Rose was gone and never seen again. The ordeal haunted Nina on and off over the years, the show occasionally featuring flashbacks, which featured Rose. The last of these happened in 2000 and 2010. In 2010, Nina and her friends, Paul Williams and Christine Blair all reminisced about the sad day. As Paul investigated Nina's lost-son whereabouts, he mentioned that Rose was deceased.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Most {{pregnant}} women experience severe pain and discomfort {{during the second}} stage of labor. In addition, the longer the duration of second-stage labor the greater the potential for a woman and her fetus to experience adverse effects. Thus, the purpose of this experimental study, using a randomized factorial design, was {{to determine the effects of}} the Prince of Songkla University (PSU) locked-upright position on the duration, pain (sensation and distress) and comfort of second-stage labor among 320 primiparous women with no known health complications. The sample was divided into 4 groups of 80 subjects each, whereby: Group 1 used the supine lithotomy position; Group 2 used the PSU locked-upright position with knees-to-chest; Group 3 used the PSU locked-upright lithotomy position; and, Group 4 used the upright lithotomy position. Subjects in Groups 2, 3 and 4 had the head of the <b>delivery</b> <b>table</b> raised 45 - 60 o. In addition, subjects in Groups 2 and 3 had their lumbar areas raised 30 - 40 o, via a pillow. Findings reveal the duration of second-stage labor, in Group 1 subjects, was longer than that of subjects in the other three groups. Although subjects in Groups 2, 3 and 4 did not show significant differences in the duration of second-stage labor, Group 3 experienced the shortest duration. This finding suggests the PSU locked-upright lithotomy position may be useful in decreasing the length of second-stage labor. No significant differences were found, among the four groups, regarding pain (sensation and distress), demographics, and obstetrical and infant data. However, of the four groups, subjects in the supine lithotomy position (Group 1) indicated having the greatest amount of back pain and discomfort while in their labor position...|$|E

Modeling experiments using the California water system simulation model, DWRSIM, show that aggressive re-operation of groundwater storage, both {{north and south}} of the Delta, can increase long-term average project deliveries by as much as 114 TAF. However, to obtain these benefits, the entire system must be re-operated to take advantage of increased groundwater storage flexibility. To make the experimental studies comparable with the base studies, all studies were operated with the same acceptable amount of project delivery shortages and the same level of acceptable Shasta Reservoir storages.

40|$|Abstract. The major {{concept of}} the Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) network uses the Label Switch Path (LSP) {{technique}} that provides high performance in packet <b>delivery</b> without routing <b>table</b> lookup. Nevertheless, it needs more overhead to rebuild a new path when occurring link failure in the MPLS network. In this paper, we propose an efficient fast path recovery mechanism, which employs the Diffusing Update Algorithm (DUAL) to establish the working and backup paths concurrently and modify the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) to establish the LSP by using Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP). Simulation {{results show that the}} proposed mechanism not only improves resource utilization but provides shorter path recovery time than the end-to-end recovery mechanism. ...|$|R

40|$|When {{talking about}} pregnancy, {{it reminds us}} of many pathophysiologic changes caused by {{alterations}} in hormones, anatomy and mechanisms. In addition, some diseases, disorders and injuries related to pregnancy and <b>delivery</b> may occur (<b>Table</b> 1). Apart from activity modification, exercises should be pre-scribed for such disorders. These vary from simple strengthening exercise-isometric exercises of limb muscles-to more specific and therapeutic exercises such as- back and pelvic floor exercises. In addition, physical modalities-hydro-therapy, ice massage and {{transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation}} (TENS) - can be adjunctive treatment. Splints and supports as well as alternative and com-plementary medicine may also be help-ful. However one should not forget that physical modalities such as short wave diathermy, can be harmful to pregnant women. Musculoskeletal considerations Low back and pelvic pain Low back pain (LBP) occurs in as many as half of all pregnant women. Risks of LBP are previous LBP, previous pregnancy and higher maternal age. During pregnancy, an increasing lumbar lordosis produces progressive shear stresses across the posterior spinal ele-ments and its intervertebral discs. Postural accommodation is achieved by flattening the lumbar spine to preserve balance, with the line of the center of gravity displaced backward and behind the ankle joint. This straightening occurs at the 30 th week. (2) In addition, there is an increase in relaxin hormone during pregnancy that increases ligament laxity. (3) LBP is rarely due to disc herniation. It generally includes lumbar or posterior pelvic pain, which occasionally radiates to the buttocks or into the posterior thigh. This condition is usually aggravated by activity and relieved by lying down, sitting or using a support. Carr’s pilo...|$|R
40|$|The {{history of}} the kitchen has {{received}} much attention from designers and design historians. Since the writings of Catharine Beecher, designers, household engineers, and others have written {{about the importance of}} the kitchen as the center of the home. This research traces the impact of the writings of theorists such as Frederick Taylor, Georgie Boynton Child, Helen Binkerd Young, and Christine Frederick on the designs produced by the architects in the first quarter of the 20 th century.  Frederick’s work took the concept of an efficient kitchen to a new level applying movement studies and introducing new ideas to the kitchen layout and arrangement.   In a properly laid out and equipped kitchen, steps were saved by placing kitchen cabinets, ovens and stoves, refrigerators and sinks where they were needed in the sequence of food preparation and <b>delivery</b> to dining <b>table</b> as well as clean up after the meal.   In her books, she also provided advice on a variety of considerations, such as appliances and accessories, lighting and ventilation; materials, finishes and color; and appliances and equipment.   In 1919 a group of architects dedicated to improving the housing stock in the United States through good design banded together to form the Architects’ Small House Service Bureau (ASHSB).   Their first plan book, How to Plan Finance and Build your Hom e published in 1921, also encouraged labor-saving kitchen design and provided advice on kitchen design. The research reported here assesses how the influence of Frederick and Boyton’s advice as reflected in the work of and interpreted by Helen Binkerd Young is demonstrated in the kitchen designs of the ASHSB’s first plan book. A plan content analysis instrument, developed using Frederick’s writings and edited to include other variables from Young and Child, is used to analyze the 99 kitchens and two essays in the ASHSB’s plan book.   The plans and accompanying comments evidence enthusiasm for the concept of scientific management and other labor- and energy-saving concepts promoted by Frederick.   Many of her specific suggestions are incorporated in their kitchen designs, but there is limited evidence that ASHSB designs are only influenced by Frederick but rather include other popular labor-saving concepts of the early 20 th century. </p...|$|R
