5|$|Construction of {{the three}} {{prototype}}s began in late 1945 and the first prototype began manufacturer's testing on 30 December. The ground testing revealed that the engine exhaust caused a low-pressure area under the rear fuselage which caused the fighter to tilt tail-down during engine tests. The rigidly mounted <b>heatshield</b> caused {{the underside of the}} rear fuselage to deform because the steel and the duralumin skin of the fuselage had different expansion ratios when heated. The rear fuselage and the <b>heatshield</b> were both redesigned to eliminate these problems. On 23 March the prototype was trucked to the Flight Research Institute (LII)'s airfield at Ramenskoye to begin preparations for flight testing.|$|E
5|$|According to {{aviation}} historian Bill Gunston, on 24 April 1946 {{representatives from}} Mikoyan-Gurevich and the Yakovlev OKB tossed a coin {{to determine which}} aircraft {{would be the first}} Soviet jet to fly. (MiG had brought the I-300, and Yakovlev the Yak-(3)-15.) MiG won and the I-300's first flight lasted six minutes. These early flights revealed problems with the stability of the aircraft and vibration problems with the new articulated <b>heatshield.</b> It was stiffened before the twelfth flight, but that only partially cured the problem. The first aircraft crashed, killing the pilot, during a demonstration in front of high-ranking officials on 11 July when the attachment lugs of the wing leading edge fairings failed and they hit the horizontal stabilizers. The remaining two prototypes began flight testing the following month, but preparations for the 7 November parade commemorating the October Revolution delayed the start of the State acceptance trials until 17 December. Meanwhile, the horizontal stabilizer of the second prototype disintegrated during flight, but the pilot was able to land the aircraft safely. Another such incident happened to the third prototype in February 1947 and forced the tail to be reinforced.|$|E
25|$|Mars Pathfinder {{directly}} entered Mars {{atmosphere in}} a retrograde direction from a hyperbolic trajectory at 6.1km/s using an atmospheric entry aeroshell (capsule) that {{was derived from}} the original Viking Mars lander design. The aeroshell consisted of a back shell and a specially designed ablative <b>heatshield</b> to slow to 370m/s (830mph) where a supersonic disk-gap-band parachute was inflated to slow its descent through the thin Martian atmosphere to 68m/s (about 160mph). The lander's on-board computer used redundant on-board accelerometers to determine the timing of the parachute inflation. Twenty seconds later the <b>heatshield</b> was pyrotechnically released. Another twenty seconds later the lander was separated and lowered from the backshell on a 20m bridle (tether). When the lander reached 1.6km above the surface, a radar was used by the on-board computer to determine altitude and descent velocity. This information was used by the computer to determine the precise timing of the landing events that followed.|$|E

Conceptual studies have been undertaken to determine if new, nanostructured materials (composites of existing TPS materials and nanostructured composite fibers) could improve the performance of TPS. To this end, we have studied various candidate <b>heatshields,</b> some composed of existing TPS materials (with known material properties), to provide a baseline for comparison with others that are admixtures of such materials and a nanostructured material. In the latter case, some assumptions were made about the thermal conductivity and strength of the admixture, relative to the baseline TPS material. For {{the purposes of this}} study, we have made the conservative assumption that {{only a small fraction of}} the remarkable properties of carbon nanotubes (for example) will be realized in the material properties of the admixtures employing them. The <b>heatshields</b> studied included those for Sharp leading edges (appropriate to out-of-orbit entry and aero-maneuvering), probes, an out-of-orbit Apollo Command Module (as a surrogate for NASA's new Crew Exploration Vehicle [CEV]), a Mars Sample Return Vehicle and a large heat shield for Mars aerocapture missions.

40|$|To {{fulfill the}} President s Vision for Space Exploration - {{successful}} human and robotic missions between the Earth and other solar system bodies {{in order to}} explore their atmospheres and surfaces - NASA must reduce trip time, cost, and vehicle weight so that payload and scientific experiment capabilities are maximized. As a collaboration among NASA Centers, this project will generate products that will enable greater fidelity in mission/vehicle design trade studies, support risk reduction for material selections, assist in optimization of vehicle weights, and provide the material and process templates for development of human-rated qualification and certification Thermal Protection System (TPS) plans. Missions performing aerocapture, aerobraking, or direct aeroentry rely on technologies that reduce vehicle weight by minimizing the need for propellant. These missions use the destination planet s atmosphere to slow the spacecraft. Such mission profiles induce heating environments on the spacecraft that demand thermal protection <b>heatshields.</b> This program offers NASA essential advanced thermal management technologies needed to develop new lightweight nonmetallic TPS materials for critical thermal protection <b>heatshields</b> for future spacecraft.

500|$|Taxi tests {{began in}} October 1945, but the <b>heatshield</b> {{proved to be}} too short and {{the heat from the}} engine exhaust melted the {{duralumin}} skin of the rear fuselage as well as the rubber tire of the tailwheel. Modifications to rectify the problems took until late December. By this time a second prototype had been completed with a solid steel tailwheel and an enlarged tailplane. After a few taxiing tests, it was transferred to the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute (TsAGI) for full-scale windtunnel testing that lasted until February 1946. On the 26th of that month, the Council of People's Commissars issued requirements that the aircraft should have a maximum speed of [...] at sea level and a speed of [...] at an altitude of [...] It should be able to climb to that altitude in 4 1/2 minutes or less and it should have a range of [...] at 90% of maximum speed.

500|$|On 9 April 1945, the Council of People's Commissars {{ordered the}} Yakovlev OKB {{to develop a}} single-seat jet fighter to be {{equipped}} with a single German Jumo 004 engine. To save time, Yakovlev based the new design (known as the Yak-3-Jumo or Yak-Jumo) on {{the latest version of}} his successful Yakovlev Yak-3 piston-engined fighter. The piston engine was removed and the jet engine was mounted underneath the forward fuselage so that its exhaust exited underneath the middle of the fuselage. To protect the fuselage, a steel <b>heatshield</b> was added to its bottom. The deeper forward part of the fuselage gave the aircraft a [...] "pod-and-boom" [...] configuration. Very few changes were made to the metal fuselage other than at the aircraft's nose. This was recontoured to accommodate the armament of two [...] Nudelman-Suranov NS-23 autocannon, an additional fuel tank above the engine and the engine itself. No changes were made to the wings other than the elimination of the air intakes for the oil cooler and the bending of the front wing spar into an inverted U-shape to clear the engine. The vertical stabilizer was slightly enlarged, but the tailplane was unmodified. The conventional landing gear was also unmodified other than the tailwheel which now used several steel leaf springs as shock absorbers. The Yak-Jumo carried a total of [...] of fuel.|$|E
500|$|The OKB chose a [...] "pod-and-boom" [...] layout {{for their}} new fighter, the I-300 (also called the izdeliye F (model or product F) by the OKB) because it offered the {{advantages}} of improved landing performance and better visibility from the cockpit when landing but it had some drawbacks, such as the unfamiliar tricycle arrangement of the landing gear, protecting the rear fuselage from the jet exhaust, and where to place the aircraft's armament. The all-metal aircraft had unswept, mid-mounted wings with two prominent air intakes in the nose. Its two-spar wings were fitted with slotted flaps and Frise ailerons. Its powerplant comprised two RD-20 turbojets, which were Soviet-manufactured versions of the BMW 003. The two engines were located behind the cockpit in the lower fuselage, with the exhaust exiting under the tail unit. A steel laminate <b>heatshield</b> was installed {{on the bottom of}} the rear fuselage to protect it from the exhaust gasses. There were four bag-type fuel tanks in the fuselage and three in each wing, providing a total internal fuel capacity of 1,625 liters (429 US gallons). The cockpit was not pressurized. The planned armament consisted of a 57mm NL-57 cannon mounted in the centerline engine intake bulkhead and two 23mm Nudelman-Suranov NS-23 autocannon mounted on the lower lip of the air intakes. The N-57 gun was provided with 28 rounds and the two NS-23 cannons had 80 rounds each.|$|E

500|$|Io has an {{extremely}} thin atmosphere consisting mainly {{of sulfur dioxide}} (...) , with minor constituents including sulfur monoxide (...) , sodium chloride (...) , and atomic sulfur and oxygen. The atmosphere has significant variations in density and temperature with time of day, latitude, volcanic activity, and surface frost abundance. The maximum atmospheric pressure on Io ranges from 3.3 to 3 pascals (Pa) or 0.3 to 3 nbar, spatially seen on Io's anti-Jupiter hemisphere and along the equator, and temporally {{in the early afternoon}} when the temperature of surface frost peaks. Localized peaks at volcanic plumes have also been seen, with pressures of 5 to 40  Pa (5 to 40 nbar). Io's atmospheric pressure is lowest on Io's night side, where the pressure dips to 0.1 to 1 Pa (0.0001 to 0.001 nbar). Io's atmospheric temperature ranges from the temperature of the surface at low altitudes, where sulfur dioxide is in vapor pressure equilibrium with frost on the surface, to 1800 K at higher altitudes where the lower atmospheric density permits heating from plasma in the Io plasma torus and from Joule heating from the Io flux tube. The low pressure limits the atmosphere's effect on the surface, except for temporarily redistributing sulfur dioxide from frost-rich to frost-poor areas, and to expand the size of plume deposit rings when plume material re-enters the thicker dayside atmosphere. The thin Ionian atmosphere also means any future landing probes sent to investigate Io will not need to be encased in an aeroshell-style <b>heatshield,</b> but instead require retrothrusters for a soft landing. The thin atmosphere also necessitates a rugged lander capable of enduring the strong Jovian radiation, which a thicker atmosphere would attenuate.|$|E

40|$|Modeling of roughness-dominated {{transition}} {{is a critical}} design issue for both ablating and non-ablating thermal protection systems (TPS). Ablating TPS, used for planetary-entry and earth-return missions, first experience recession under high-altitude, low-Reynolds-number conditions. Such laminar-flow ablation causes {{the formation of a}} surface microroughness pattern characteristic of the TPS material composition and fabrication process. For non-ablating TPS, such as the overlapping-tile, metallic <b>heatshields</b> proposed for future reusable launch vehicles, the surface roughness pattern is established a priori by the engineering design and assembly procedure. In both cases, these distributed surface roughness patterns create disturbances within, and alter the mean velocity profile of, the laminar boundary layer flowing over the surface. As altitude decreases, Reynolds number increases, and flow field conditions capable of amplifying these roughness-induced perturbations are eventually achieved, i. e., transition onset occurs. Boundary layer transition to turbulence results in more severe heat-transfer rates. Ablating TPS experience increased recession rates, leading to potential bum-through, while non-ablating TPS experience accelerated temperature rise, leading to potential melting of key components...|$|R

Phenolic Impregnated Carbon Ablator (PICA) and LI- 2200 materials (the insulation material of Shuttle tiles) were used for this study.

In order to investigate the reliability of PICA tiles {{in the presence of}} high thermal gradients as well as mechanical loads, the authors designed and conducted solar-tower tests. This paper presents the design and analysis work for this tests series. Coupled non-linear thermal-mechanical finite element analyses was conducted to estimate in-depth temperature distribution and stress contours for various cases. The first set of analyses performed on isolated PICA tile showed that stresses generated during the tests were below the PICA allowable limit and should not lead to any catastrophic failure during the test. The tests results were consistent with analytical predictions. The temperature distribution and magnitude of the measured strains were also consistent with predicted values. The second test series is designed to test the arrayed PICA tiles with various gap-filler materials. A nonlinear contact method is used to model the complex geometry with various tiles. The analyses for these coupons predict the stress contours in PICA and inside gap fillers. Suitable mechanical loads for this architecture will be predicted, which can be applied during the test to exceed the allowable limits and demonstrate failure modes.

There are significant uncertainties in the tools and models currently used for the prediction of entry aeroheating and TPS material thermal response.

Their goal was a conformal material, processed with a flexible reinforcement {{that would result in}} similar or better thermal characteristics and higher strain-to-failure characteristics that would allow for easier integration on flight aeroshells than then-current rigid ablative TPS materials. In 2012, NASAs Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) began funding the maturation of the best formulation of the game changing conformal ablator, C-PICA. Progress has been reported at IPPW over the past three years, describing C-PICA with a density and recession rates similar to PICA, but with a higher strain-to-failure which allows for direct bonding and no gap fillers, and even more important, with thermal characteristics resulting in half the temperature rise of PICA. Overall, C-PICA should be able to replace PICA with a thinner, lighter weight, less complicated design. These characteristics should be particularly attractive for use as backshell TPS on high energy planetary entry vehicles. At the end of this year, the material should be ready for missions to consider including in their design, in fact, NASAs Science Mission Directorate (SMD) is considering incentivizing the use of C-PICA in the next Discovery Proposal call. This year both scale up of the material to large (1 -m) sized pieces and the design and build of small probe <b>heatshields</b> for flight tests will be completed.
