50|$|A {{discontinuous}} <b>filament</b> <b>winding</b> <b>machine</b> (DFW {{machine or}} DW machine) is a machine for laying fiberglass filament windings over a cylindrical mould or mandrel bar using a carriage that is traveling along {{the axis of}} that mandrel.

40|$|From both {{theory and}} {{experimental}} evidence, an optimum solution for filament wound tubes subjected to hydrostatic pressure is the  55 ° laminate, maximising strength and allowing for satisfactory production rates. The usual strength criteria predict an equally good behaviour if a (0 °/ 90 ° 2) s laminate is adopted. Although the latter solution would imply dedicated <b>filament</b> <b>winding</b> <b>machines</b> and longer fabrication times, {{it would also}} provide a sensibly higher flexural stiffness in the circumferential direction, required when buried pipes are concerned. At this time, no data are available, comparing the performances of  55 ° and (0 °/ 90 ° 2) s on a common basis. This {{was one of the}} objectives of the present work, where Glass Fibre Reinforced Plastic (GFRP) pipes, made of E-glass and Synolite NP 244 polyester resin, were produced according to the lay-ups (90, 0, 90) n and ( 55) n, with n = 1 - 3, obtaining shell thicknesses in the range 1 to 3 mm. From the pipes, specially designed specimens were fabricated, suitable to yield valid failure modes. The samples were subjected to hydrostatic tests in a Hammel Sciteq P 400 machine, by which an internal pressure was applied through water inlet. During the mechanical characterisation tests, the specimens were continuously monitored by two Acoustic Emission (AE) sensors linked to a Vallen AMSY 4 system. The scope of AE analysis was twofold: a) to verify the usefulness of typical AE parameters [1 - 3], as the hits evolution, energy, and amplitude, in identifying the different failure modes occurring during loading; b) to attempt an effective localisation of the damage, rendered difficult by the acoustic anisotropy of the material [4]. After tests, some specimens were sectioned and microscopically examined, in order to verify their failure modes. It was found that, before the pipe burst, a dense network of resin microcracks, resulting in water leakage, is generated in the shell (Fig. 1 a). This phenomenon impairs the possibility of actually achieving burst with evident fibre failure. It was found that the critical stress for leakage of the 0 / 90 is slightly lower than its  55 counterpart. Further, the AE response is strongly influenced by the laminate type, with the  55 laminate emitting much more than the 0 / 90 laminate. In all cases, the resin microcracks were characterised by low amplitude signals...|$|R

40|$|This paper (Part II) {{provides}} {{the continuation of}} 'Filament Winding Part I'. The main issue in Part II is the formulation and solution of the kinematic equations associated with <b>filament</b> <b>winding.</b> The basic geometry is a generic one; this implies that the method presented here should be suitable to deal with every possible <b>winding</b> <b>machine</b> configuration. However, {{in order to create}} a well-determined solution, various assumptions have been made, mainly regarding the coupling between the involved machine movements (translations and rotations). These couplings should preferably be derived by optimisation techniques. The solution method presented here can be characterised by robustness, improved accuracy and short calculation times. These properties make the method suitable for optimisation purposes. The obtained results clearly indicate that for a particular wound object geometry, the most suitable <b>winding</b> <b>machine</b> configuration is not always the lathe winder. In addition, the use of a lathe winder without cross-carriage is generally not feasible due to excessive feed eye translations. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Innovated FRP (Fiber Reinforced Polymer) {{bridge deck}} system is {{gradually}} applied widely {{in the recent}} years. Many FRP deck products by varied processes were created and manufactured. In the decks, local delamitation, debonding and buckling are usually the ultimate failure modes that cause the FRP strength not to be utilized fully and result in a sudden or brittle failure. In this paper, a concept of improving the mechanical performance of FRP decks by outside <b>filament</b> <b>winding</b> is presented. Two sets of experiments are conducted in order to compare the suggested filament wound FRP decks with the others without winding under static load. In the tests, the ultimate load of the pultruded shaped plank increased largely and the stiffness improved obviously by the <b>filament</b> <b>winding.</b> The ultimate deformation capacity of the combined deck was enhanced greatly. Pseudo ductility appeared in the filament wound combined deck. Based on the experimental results, the mechanism of the outside <b>filament</b> <b>winding</b> which provides not only the additional shear and torsion stiffness but also the confinement is analyzed.
