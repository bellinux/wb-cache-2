40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} how elementary principals are evaluated and the extent to which evaluation is considered a means for assisting elementary school principals to improve student learning. The four major research questions guiding this study are: What <b>evaluation</b> <b>procedures</b> do selected public schools use to evaluate the effectiveness of elementary school principals? What similarities and differences in procedures do selected school systems use to evaluate the effectiveness of elementary school principals? What ways do teachers in selected public schools use to evaluate elementary school principals? How are evaluations of elementary school principals in selected public schools used to improve student learning? ^ The review of research and literature undertaken for this study described contemporary principal <b>evaluation</b> <b>procedures</b> and examined the role of parents, students, and teachers in the evaluation of elementary school principals. ^ Data were gathered about principal <b>evaluation</b> <b>procedures</b> in interviews with fourteen public elementary school principals in demographically diverse schools in the state of Massachusetts. A content analysis of the principal <b>evaluation</b> <b>procedures</b> found in the data was conducted to determine whether school districts have documented principal <b>evaluation</b> <b>procedures,</b> the characteristics of the <b>evaluation</b> <b>procedures</b> that school districts are utilizing, the participants included in the evaluation of principals, and the procedures/similarities and differences in the <b>evaluation</b> <b>procedures.</b> This study analyzed the performance indicators included on principal evaluations and how they contributed to improving student learning. ^ The data gathered in this research found that the participating principals supported the linkage of their evaluation to the improvement of student learning. Further, this research indicated that the participating principals were knowledgeable of their school district 2 ̆ 7 s principal <b>evaluation</b> <b>procedures</b> and tat some school districts in Massachusetts are lacking documented principal <b>evaluation</b> <b>procedures.</b> Finally, this study proposes recommendations that may be useful to principal preparation programs and to assist school districts in strengthening principal <b>evaluation</b> <b>procedures</b> for improving student learning. ...|$|R

5000|$|Design of Experiments(DoE) {{is used by}} {{engineers}} or applied {{scientist in}} physical or simulated experiments {{to reduce the number}} of runs. Each experiment is defined by a number of factors, for instance the oven temperature or the heating time. One run is defined by specific values of each factor. Hence, we have a huge number of runs which increase exponentially with the number of factors. The main question in DoE is to figure out a reliable small subset of runs to answer initially defined questions. These questions vary from the significance of a factor to predictions of unobserved areas in the experiment. Cornerstone focuses on D-optimal designs [...] to select the subset of runs. They can be adjusted flexibly to practical requirements like constraints in the design space, integration of existing experiments, and model approaches in any order. The analysis of DoEs use regression methods for both categorical and continuous factors (incl. compositions).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to contribute to the lack of <b>evaluation</b> <b>procedures</b> (identified in the academic literature) able to tackle the complexity of Social Housing (SH) sector. We analysed the <b>evaluation</b> <b>procedures</b> currently suggested in the literature on SH, in order to understand what methodologies are proposed/applied and we checked if the <b>evaluation</b> <b>procedures</b> identified are able to tackle the current trends occurring in the SH provision in Europe. Operatively, we apply a review framework structured into keywords derived from the official SH definitions provided by CECODHAS Housing Europe. First, the keywords are linked to the bibliographic references of scientific journals and to the country of each study analysed over the past fifteen years, from 2000 to 2015. Second, the papers identified are reviewed by checking whether or not they present <b>evaluation</b> <b>procedures.</b> Third, a geographical distribution of the papers is provided. The results of this review show that, even if several <b>evaluation</b> <b>procedures</b> are clearly identified and applied in SH, none of the papers analysed deals with all the SH keywords in an integrated perspective. To contribute filling this gap, we finally propose a conceptual decision framework based on the integration between Multicriteria Decision Analyses (MCDA) and Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), able to balance the different SH issues seen not as trade off but complementary.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the {{opinions}} of kindergarten teachers, transitional grade teachers, and first grade teachers regarding the importance of selected goals, content, learning activities, and <b>evaluation</b> <b>procedures</b> for a transitional grade between kindergarten and first grade. Effects of teaching experience and educational background were examined. The Transitional Curriculum Questionnaire for Teachers was developed by the researcher and mailed to 189 elementary schools with transitional classrooms. Respondents included 156 kindergarten teachers, 104 transitional grade teachers, and 263 first grade teachers. The majority of the teachers reported educational backgrounds in elementary education. Teaching experience ranged from 1 to 44 years. Through the use of a checklist, responding teachers identified goals, content, learning activities, and <b>evaluation</b> <b>procedures</b> which they considered "important" for a transitional program. A chi-square test at the. 05 level of significance was used to analyze the data. Results 1. Kindergarten teachers, transitional grade teachers, and first grade teachers agreed on the importance of 10 of the 16 goals, 6 of the 16 content areas, 6 of the 16 learning activities, and 11 of the 16 <b>evaluation</b> <b>procedures</b> for a transitional program. 2.

5000|$|The [...] "shoestring {{evaluation}} approach" [...] {{is designed}} to assist evaluators operating under limited budget, limited access or availability of data and limited turnaround time, to conduct effective evaluations that are methodologically rigorous(Bamberger, Rugh, Church & Fort, 2004). This approach has responded to the continued greater need for evaluation processes that are more rapid and economical under difficult circumstances of budget, time constraints and limited availability of data. However, {{it is not always}} possible to design an evaluation to achieve the highest standards available. Many programs do not build an <b>evaluation</b> <b>procedure</b> into their design or budget. Hence, many evaluation processes do not begin until the program is already underway, which can result in time, budget or data constraints for the evaluators, which in turn can affect the reliability, validity or sensitivity of the evaluation. > The shoestring approach helps to ensure that the maximum possible methodological rigor is achieved under these constraints.|$|E
50|$|The idea of {{measuring}} the residual stress by {{drilling a hole}} and registering the change of the hole diameter was first proposed by Mathar in 1934. In 1966 Rendler and Vignis introduced a systematic and repeatable procedure of hole drilling to measure the residual stress. In the following period the method was further developed in terms of drilling techniques, measuring the relieved deformations, and the residual stress evaluation itself. A very important milestone {{is the use of}} finite element method to compute the calibration coefficients and to evaluate the residual stresses from the measured relieved deformations (Schajer, 1981). That allowed especially the evaluation of residual stresses which are not constant along the depth. It also brought further possibilities of using the method, e.g., for inhomogeneous materials, coatings, etc. The measurement and <b>evaluation</b> <b>procedure</b> is standardised by the norm ASTM E837 of the American Society for Testing and Materials which also contributed to the popularity of the method. The hole drilling is currently one of the most widespread methods {{of measuring}} the residual stress. Modern computational methods are used for the evaluation. The method is being developed especially in terms of drilling techniques and the possibilities of measuring the deformations.|$|E
50|$|As {{the earlier}} Erprobungsstelle Rechlin central {{military}} aviation test facility of the defunct Third Reich was well inside East German borders after 1945, following {{the foundation of}} the modern German Armed Forces (Bundeswehr) in November 1955, the need for a new institution to test military aircraft became apparent. On 1 October 1997 the Testing Centre for Military Aerial Equipment (Erprobungsstelle für militärisches Luftgerät) was founded, the predecessor of the Bundeswehr Technical and Airworthiness Center for Aircraft. The centre was based at Oberpfaffenhofen Airfield. Initially, the tasks of this new centre were to create the structure and procedures for the testing centre. Once this was completed, the centre was operational and began the testing and <b>evaluation</b> <b>procedure</b> of aerial military equipment selected for possible procurement by the German Armed Forces. Parts of the testing centre were relocated to Manching Air Base in 1967. The fact that Manching Air Base was also used by Reconnaissance Wing 51 at that time, restricted the testing of new aircraft. Consequently in 1968, a new airfield was selected, Giebelstadt Airport, to house the units previously based at Manching Air Base. In 1969, all units of the testing centre were concentrated at Manching Air Base. In 1987, the centre was renamed Wehrtechnische Dienststelle für Luftfahrzeuge - Musterprüfwesen für Luftfahrtgerät der Bundeswehr (Wehrtechnische Dienstelle 61 (WTD 61)).|$|E
