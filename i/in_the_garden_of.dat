5|$|A {{fluxgate}} gradiometer {{survey in}} July 2009 investigated standing stones <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> <b>of</b> the Druids Arms public house known as The Cove, {{which showed that}} the stones date from nearly a thousand years before the stone circles. The conclusion from the study was that these upright stones {{are likely to have}} been the portals or façade of a chambered tomb.|$|E

5|$|A {{monument}} to Raoul Wallenberg by Scottish sculptor Philip Jackson {{is located at}} Great Cumberland Place in London's Marble Arch district, outside the Western Marble Arch Synagogue. It was unveiled by Queen Elizabeth II in 1997, {{in the presence of}} the President of Israel, Ezer Weizman, the Secretary General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, and survivors of the Holocaust. A separate monument stands near the Welsh National War Memorial in Cathays Park, Cardiff.

5|$|After the festival, the Wagner family {{journeyed to}} Venice for the winter. Wagner {{died of a}} heart attack at the age of 69 on 13 February 1883 at Ca' Vendramin Calergi, a 16th-century palazzo on the Grand Canal. The legend that the attack was {{prompted}} by argument with Cosima over Wagner's supposedly amorous interest in the singer Carrie Pringle, who had been a Flower-maiden in Parsifal at Bayreuth, is without credible evidence. After a funerary gondola bore Wagner's remains over the Grand Canal, his body was taken to Germany where it was buried <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> <b>of</b> the Villa Wahnfried in Bayreuth.|$|E

5|$|Although the story's {{central theme}} is loneliness, it uses shoes and rain as motifs, along with Man'yōshū poetry and the Japanese garden {{in which it}} is set. Although rain is {{typically}} seen as sad and gloomy, <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Garden</b> <b>of</b> Words it makes the world more vivid and protects the two main characters from the reality of their lives and the limitations imposed by society. Shinkai also noted a parallel between love and rain—that neither can be controlled or stopped.|$|E
5|$|An {{analogy is}} also made between Gawain's {{trial and the}} Biblical test that Adam {{encounters}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Garden</b> <b>of</b> Eden. Adam succumbs to Eve just as Gawain surrenders to Bertilak's wife by accepting the girdle. Although Gawain sins by putting his faith in the girdle and not confessing when he is caught, the Green Knight pardons him, thereby allowing {{him to become a}} better Christian by learning from his mistakes. Through the various games played and hardships endured, Gawain finds his place within the Christian world.|$|E
5|$|Arriving in Iaşi (Jassy) in 1876, Goldfaden was {{fortunate}} to be better known as a good poet — many of whose poems had been set to music and had become popular songs — than as a less-than-successful businessman. Nevertheless, when he sought funds from Isaac Librescu for another newspaper, Librescu was uninterested in that proposition. Librescu's wife remarked that Yiddish-language journalism was {{just a way to}} starve; she suggested {{that there would be a}} lot more of a market for Yiddish-language theater. Librescu offered Goldfaden 100 francs for a public recital of his songs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> <b>of</b> Shimen Mark, Grădina Pomul Verde ("the Green Fruit-Tree Garden").|$|E

5|$|At 5:17pm on 30 January 1948, Gandhi {{was with}} his grandnieces <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> <b>of</b> the former Birla House (now Gandhi Smriti), {{on his way to}} address a prayer meeting, when Nathuram Godse fired three bullets from a Beretta 9mm pistol into his chest at point-blank range. According to some accounts, Gandhi died on the spot. In other accounts, such as one {{prepared}} by an eyewitness journalist, Gandhi was carried into the Birla House, into a bedroom. There he died about 30 minutes later as one of Gandhi's family members read verses from Hindu scriptures.|$|E
5|$|Benn met Caroline Middleton DeCamp (born 13 October 1926, Cincinnati, Ohio, United States) over tea at Worcester College, Oxford, in 1949 {{and just}} nine days after meeting her; he {{proposed}} to her {{on a park bench}} in the city. Later, he bought the bench from Oxford City Council and installed it <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> <b>of</b> their home in Holland Park. Tony and Caroline had four children – Stephen, Hilary, Melissa, a feminist writer, and Joshua – and ten grandchildren. Caroline Benn died of cancer on 22 November 2000, aged 74, after a career as an educationalist.|$|E
5|$|By the 1830s {{the species}} was in {{cultivation}} in continental Europe. It was recorded as being cultivated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> <b>of</b> Karl von Hügel in Vienna, Austria in 1831, and in 1833 it was listed amongst the rare plants {{that had been}} introduced into Belgium. Along with several hundred other native Australian plants it was exhibited at plant shows held at Utrecht and Haarlem in the Netherlands in the 1840s and 1850s. By this time, however, English gardeners {{had already begun to}} lose interest in the Proteaceae, {{and by the end of}} the 19th century European interest in the cultivation of Proteaceae was virtually non-existent.|$|E

5|$|Gandavyuha is {{the story}} told in the final chapter of the Avatamsaka Sutra about Sudhana's tireless {{wandering}} {{in search of the}} Highest Perfect Wisdom. It covers two galleries (third and fourth) and also half of the second gallery, comprising in total of 460 panels. The principal figure of the story, the youth Sudhana, son of an extremely rich merchant, appears on the 16th panel.

5|$|Green {{today is}} not {{commonly}} associated in Europe and the United States with love and sexuality, but in stories of the medieval period it sometimes represented love and the base, natural desires of man. It {{was the color of}} the serpent <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Garden</b> <b>of</b> Eden who caused the downfall of Adam and Eve. However, for the troubadours, green was the color of growing love, and light green clothing was reserved for young women who were not yet married.|$|E
5|$|On 3 June 1944, Braun's sister Gretl Braun married SS-Gruppenführer Hermann Fegelein, {{who served}} as Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler's liaison officer on Hitler's staff. Hitler used the {{marriage}} {{as an excuse to}} allow Braun to appear at official functions, as she could then be introduced as Fegelein's sister-in-law. When Fegelein was caught in the closing days of the war trying to escape to Sweden or Switzerland, Hitler ordered his execution. He was shot for desertion <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> <b>of</b> the Reich Chancellery on 28 April 1945.|$|E

5|$|The Great Circle was {{surrounded}} by a ditch and is accompanied by smaller stone circles to the north east and south west. There is also a group of three stones, known as The Cove, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> <b>of</b> the local pub. Slightly further from the Great Circle is a single stone, known as Hautville's Quoit. Some of the stones are still vertical, but the majority are now recumbent and some are no longer present.|$|E
5|$|The {{octagonal}} font {{dates from}} the 15th century; its carved panels alternate images of the symbols of the Four Evangelists with seated figures of the Doctors of the Church (Saint Ambrose, Saint Augustine, Saint Jerome, and Pope Gregory I). The central column carries shields depicting the Instruments of the Passion and the Holy Wounds. The eastern shield is unusual in that a sword is shown with an ear stuck to it. This refers {{to the story of}} Saint Peter striking off the ear of Malchus, the High Priest's servant, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> <b>of</b> Gethsemane.|$|E
