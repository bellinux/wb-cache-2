25|$|There {{are some}} further {{constraints}} upon the sustaining of a Stackelberg equilibrium. The leader must know <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> that the follower observes its action.

Indeed, if the 'follower' could commit to a Stackelberg leader action and the 'leader' knew this, the leader's best response would be to play a Stackelberg follower action.|$|E
25|$|Monitoring by {{the board}} of directors: The board of directors, with its legal {{authority}} to hire, fire and compensate top management, safeguards invested capital. Regular board meetings allow potential problems to be identified, discussed and avoided. Whilst non-executive directors are thought to be more independent, they may not always result in more effective corporate governance and may not increase performance. Different board structures are optimal for different firms. Moreover, the ability of the board to monitor the firm's executives is a function of its access to information. Executive directors possess superior knowledge of the decision-making process and therefore evaluate top management {{on the basis of the}} quality of its decisions that lead to financial performance outcomes, <b>ex</b> <b>ante.</b> It could be argued, therefore, that executive directors look beyond the financial criteria.|$|E
500|$|The {{loanable funds}} doctrine, by contrast, does not equate savings and investment, both {{understood}} in an <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> sense, but integrates bank credit creation into this equilibrium condition.

2500|$|Going [...] "downstream", {{from the}} {{technology}} to the sale of goods, market signals enter the picture at opposite stages. First, market signals can act <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> in the competition among different paradigms: if more paradigms are available, firms would select {{one or the other}} according to their expected profitability. But once a paradigm is affirmed, the direction of technological change would be already implied by its technological prescriptions. Second, market signals can act by selecting ex post those applications of the affirmed paradigm (i.e. the final products) that best fit the market requests. However, at that point their impact on the direction of technical change would be null, since such direction had already been decided by the prescriptions of the affirmed paradigm.|$|E
2500|$|Entrepreneurship is {{the process}} of designing, {{launching}} and running a new business, which is more often than not, initially a small business, offering a product, process or service for sale or hire. The people who create these businesses are called entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurship has been described as the [...] "capacity and willingness to develop, organize and manage a business venture along with any of its risks {{in order to make a}} profit". While definitions of entrepreneurship typically focus on the launching and running of businesses, due to the high risks involved in launching a start-up, a significant proportion of businesses have to close, due to [...] "lack of funding, bad business decisions, an economic crisis, lack of market demand – or a combination of all of these". In the 2000s, the definition of [...] "entrepreneurship" [...] expanded to explain how and why some individuals (or teams) identify opportunities, evaluate them as viable and then decide to exploit them, whereas others do not and, in turn, how entrepreneurs use these opportunities to develop new products or services, launch new firms or even new industries and create wealth. Recent advances stress the fundamentally uncertain nature of the entrepreneurial process, because although opportunities exist, their existence cannot be discovered or identified prior to their actualization into profits. What appears as a real opportunity <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> might actually be a non-opportunity or one that cannot be actualized by entrepreneurs lacking the necessary business skills, financial or social capital.|$|E

50|$|In {{the case}} of private goods, the {{inefficiency}} asymptotically disappears {{when the number of}} market participants becomes large. Yet, in {{the case of}} public goods the inefficiency is aggravated when the number of agents becomes large. Note that Myerson and Satterthwaite considered an <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> asymmetric situation, in the sense that at the outset one party has 100% of the good and the other party has 0% of the good. It has been shown that ex post efficiency can be attained if <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> both parties own 50% of the good to be traded. The latter result has been extended to settings in which the parties can make unobservable <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> investments in order to increase their own valuations. Yet, ex post efficiency cannot be achieved if the seller's unobservable investment increases the buyer's valuation, even if only the buyer has private information about his or her valuation. Another impossibility result where only one party has private information about its valuation can be shown to hold when the outside option payoffs are not exogenously given.|$|E
