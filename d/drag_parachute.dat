5000|$|The car debuted at a meet in Bakersfield, California on March 4, 1966. Driven by Joe Schubeck, the Hurst Hairy Olds {{began as}} a fully trimmed and later {{upholstered}} Oldsmobile 442 in body in white (BIW) form. Hurst installed {{not one but two}} 425 inÂ³ (7 L) Oldsmobile engines and Toronado transaxles both front and rear; a pair of <b>drag</b> <b>parachutes</b> were mounted in the stock taillight positions and four-wheel disc brakes were fitted as well. Two engines meant two of virtually everything in the cockpit related to the operation of the car, including two cable-operated shifters, two tachometers, two sets of oil pressure and temperature gauges and even two accelerator pedals. Additional power was provided via a Cragar Equipment-modified 6-71 GMC supercharger atop each engine, each burning a blend of nitromethane and alcohol. Weight was reduced through the use of aluminum body components and Plexiglas windows. The result was a 2400-horsepower, four-wheel-drive exhibition drag racer which smoked its front and rear tires {{down the length of the}} race track with times in the eleven-second range.|$|R

40|$|The data {{returned}} from the successful Phoenix Mars Scout mission are analyzed {{in order to determine}} characteristics and behaviors of the supersonic parachute that was used to slow the entry body during its descent to the surface. At least one significant drag reduction event was observed when the vehicle was traveling at Mach 1. 6; this is consistent with previously reported terrestrial high altitude testing and is likely associated with an area oscillation of the parachute. The parachute is shown to possess some lateral instability relative to the anti-velocity vector that is also at a level that is consistent with the same historic data. Ramifications of the lateral instability and, in particular, the unsteadiness in the <b>parachute</b> <b>drag</b> are discussed as energizing elements of the entry body wrist mode. The apparent coefficient of <b>drag</b> for the <b>parachute</b> is calculated and shown to have relatively small variations on an average basis over the supersonic portion of flight...|$|R

The problem of time point to open main parachute (tm) in this UAV Recovery System is analyzed by simulation results of this model, and a series of meaningful conclusion is drawn. When recovery system works while UAV is flying steadily, tm becomes earlier as velocity increases, and later as pitch angle increases. tm is earliest when relieve <b>drag</b> <b>parachute</b> reefing at the time when control subsystem stops working. Larger the drag characteristics of the fully opened <b>drag</b> <b>parachute</b> is, earlier tm is, and larger the drag characteristics of the reefing opened <b>drag</b> <b>parachute</b> is, later tm is.

50|$|This was {{the first}} of the Aggregat rockets to be {{launched}} from the PeenemÃ¼nde area. As part of Operation Lighthouse the first A3 was launched on 4 December 1937, but suffered problems with both premature parachute deployment and engine failure, and crashed close to the takeoff point. The second launch on 6 December 1937 suffered similar problems. The parachute was disabled in the third and fourth rockets launched on 8 and 11 December 1937, but these, too, experienced engine failures, though the lack of <b>parachute</b> <b>drag</b> allowed them to crash further from the launch site.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} the development history and technical {{highlights of the}} Space Shuttle Orbiter Drag Chute Program. Data and references are given on the design, development, and testing of the system, plus several interesting operational issues and solutions. The last Shuttle flight was completed in 2011 and all the Orbiters have now become museum pieces. Before all the data from system development and the 86 Orbiter Drag Chute (ODC) operational landings is lost or forgotten, {{it may be useful}} to summarize it here and to identify data sources for future reference. Much has been written about various aspects of the program, and this summary has attempted to cite many such references to make available more detailed information. The ODC program was a high-visibility NASA program that afforded the opportunity to thoroughly engineer and test the chute system, far beyond so many of today s tight-budget programs. So the ODC program was extremely informative [...] it provided a wide scope of information including protective door jettison issues and solutions, wind tunnel data and analyses on chute stability and drag behind a huge and rather blunt forebody, component and system reuse, and chute cleaning methods. Technology and data created have aided several current and past parachute programs, {{and will continue to do}} so in the future. The original Orbiter preliminary design included a <b>drag</b> <b>parachute</b> [...] it was deleted early to save weight. But after the 1987 Challenger accident and during the program redefinition phase that followed, Astronaut John Young presented a strong case for enhancing landing safety by adding nosegear steering, brake improvements, and reviving the drag chute...|$|E
40|$|This {{project was}} {{performed}} {{in support of the}} engineering development of the NASA X- 38 Crew Return Vehicle (CRV) system. Wind tunnel experiments were used to visualize various aerodynamic phenomena encountered by the CRV during the final stages of descent and landing. Scale models of the CRV were used to visualize vortex structures above and below the vehicle, and in its wake, and to quantify their trajectories. The effect of flaperon deflection on these structures was studied. The structure and dynamics of the CRV's wake during the <b>drag</b> <b>parachute</b> deployment stage were measured. Regions of high vorticity were identified using surveys conducted in several planes using a vortex meter. Periodic shedding of the vortex sheets from the sides of the CRV was observed using laser sheet videography as the CRV reached high angles of attack during the quasi-steady pitch-up prior to parafoil deployment. Using spectral analysis of hot-film anemometer data, the Strouhal number of these wake fluctuations was found to be 0. 14 based on the model span. Phenomena encountered in flight test during parafoil operation were captured in scale-model tests, and a video photogrammetry technique was implemented to obtain parafoil surface shapes during flight in the tunnel. Forces on the parafoil were resolved using tension gages on individual lines. The temporal evolution of the phenomenon of leading edge collapse was captured. Laser velocimetry was used to demonstrate measurement of the porosity of the parafoil surface. From these measurements, several physical explanations have been developed for phenomena observed at various stages of the X- 38 development program. Quantitative measurement capabilities have also been demonstrated for continued refinement of the aerodynamic technologies employed in the X- 38 project. Detailed results from these studies are given in an AIAA Paper, two slide presentations, and other material which are given on a Web-based archival resource. This is the Digital Library of the Georgia Tech Experimental Aerodynamics Group...|$|E
50|$|Designed to {{be dropped}} from low {{altitude}}s, the bomb's fall is slowed by a parachute. The maximum release speed is 550 kn and the minimum release altitude is 200 ft. When the bomb has reached a 40Â° angle due to the <b>parachute's</b> <b>drag,</b> it fires a rocket booster that accelerates it into the runway surface. The 100 kg primary charge explodes once the weapon has penetrated the concrete and drives the secondary charge even deeper. The 15 kg secondary charge then explodes after a one-second delay. Later production weapons have a programmable fuze that can delay the secondary detonation up to several hours.|$|R

50|$|A {{static line}} is a cord {{attached}} at {{one end to the}} aircraft and at the other end {{to the top of the}} jumper's 'D-Bag' (Deployment Bag, into which the canopy is packed). The parachutist's fall from the aircraft causes the static line to become taut, this then pulls the D-Bag out of the container on the jumper's back. The static line and D-Bag stay with the aircraft as the jumper leaves, and is pulled back into the aircraft by the dispatcher. Now free of its D-Bag, the canopy is allowed to inflate as the jumper continues to fall. Effectively, the jumper <b>drags</b> the <b>parachute</b> behind him, causing the upward-rushing wind to force open and inflate the canopy. The canopy should inflate and begin supporting the jumper within 4 seconds. In the unlikely event of a malfunction, students are taught how to cut away the main canopy and deploy the reserve chute. The aim of static line progression is to train students to maintain the correct, stable body position upon exiting the aircraft, and to teach how to deploy the canopy via the pilot chute mechanism.|$|R
