40|$|Winnowing of cowpea {{has been}} widely done {{manually}} in developing countries, such as Nigeria. The need to develop machines to ease this task cannot be overemphasized. As such, a pedal <b>operated</b> cowpea <b>winnower</b> machine was designed and fabricated in the Department of Agricultural and Bio-Environmental Engineering Department of Federal College of Agriculture, Akure with locally sourced materials. The machine which required 0. 12 Kw energy was evaluated based on three different speeds of feeder rotation of 54 rpm, 108 rpm and 216 rpm and at a constant speed of fan rotation of 108 rpm. The result of the machine, after testing shows that the winnower has a maximum capacity of 374 kg/h and 90 % cleaning efficiency. This is better than manual <b>operated</b> <b>winnower.</b> Also, the optimum speed of feeder, capacity and cleaning efficiency were 195 rpm, 310 kg/h and 63 % respectively. The cost of production of machine was N 66, 500...|$|R
