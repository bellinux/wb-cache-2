5|$|Because of America's {{entry into}} World War I in April 1917 {{and the ongoing}} war effort, several SIAA schools did not field {{football}} teams in 1918.

40|$|This study empirically {{investigates the}} moderating effect of {{competitive}} intensity {{on the relationship}} between innovative <b>efforts</b> <b>and</b> performance. The study proposes that a firm’s competitive intensity acts as a quasi-moderator of the relationship between innovative <b>efforts</b> <b>and</b> performance. The results support the predictions of the study. The results indicate that competitive intensity moderates the relationship between innovative <b>efforts</b> <b>and</b> performance such that when competitive intensity is high, the relationship between innovative <b>efforts</b> <b>and</b> performance is positive, and vice versa, when the competitive intensity is low, the relationship between innovative <b>efforts</b> <b>and</b> performance is negative. Furthermore, the results reveal that competitive intensity has a positive relationship to the level of innovative efforts but has a negative relationship to performance...|$|R

5|$|The British did {{not return}} to Charleston until 1780, when General Clinton {{successfully}} besieged the city and captured an entire army.

30|$|Further {{research}} on organizational pride may also separate the employee-related sources of organizational pride, i.e., employees’ <b>efforts</b> <b>and</b> abilities, {{from the experience}} of organizational pride in comparing their influence with other antecedents such as work conditions.

5|$|A {{second wave}} of work {{took place on the}} city walls in the late 15th century. Backed by {{substantial}} communal <b>effort</b> <b>and</b> financial contributions, Newingate was rebuilt between 1450 and 1470, and probably closely resembled the West Gate in style. Burgate was rebuilt in brick from 1475 onwards, again thanks to public contributions, but it was not completed until 1525, furnished with gunports and anachronistic battlements. Queningate was closed up at shortly after the 15th century, probably following {{the construction of a new}} postern gate nearby. West Gate was appointed the city gaol in 1453 by Henry VI, with Canterbury Castle serving as the county gaol.|$|E

5|$|As {{with the}} Mackensens, the three ships of the Ersatz Yorck class were never completed. This was {{primarily}} due to shifting wartime construction priorities; U-boats were deemed more important to Germany's war <b>effort,</b> <b>and</b> so work on other types of ships was slowed or halted outright. The lead ship, Ersatz Yorck, was the only vessel of the three to have construction begin, though she was over two years from completion by the time work was abandoned. With the hull incomplete, the ship could not be launched and towed to ship-breakers; as a result, Ersatz Yorck was broken up in situ.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{years of}} heavy promotion, the Deseret {{alphabet}} was never widely adopted.

5|$|During World War II PRR carried {{troops and}} matériel for the Allied war <b>effort,</b> <b>and</b> the Curve was under armed guard. The {{military}} intelligence arm of Nazi Germany, the Abwehr, plotted to sabotage important industrial {{assets in the}} United States in a project code-named Operation Pastorius. In June1942 four men were brought by submarine and landed on Long Island, planning to destroy such sites as the Curve, Hell Gate Bridge, Alcoa aluminum factories and locks on the Ohio River. The would-be saboteurs were quickly apprehended by the Federal Bureau of Investigation after one, George John Dasch, turned himself in.|$|E
5|$|During the war the Australian Government greatly {{expanded}} its powers {{in order to}} better direct the war <b>effort,</b> <b>and</b> Australia's industrial and human resources were focused on supporting the Allied armed forces. The expansion of the government's powers began on 9 September 1939 when the National Security Act became law. This act enabled the government to introduce industrial conscription, and both men and women were ordered into essential industries. Rationing was first introduced in 1940 and was {{greatly expanded}} during 1942. The Government also strongly encouraged austerity and war bonds as a means of reducing demand for scarce resources.|$|E
