40|$|Superannuation is the Commonwealth Government’s {{preferred}} {{system for}} the provision of income in retirement. By definition, occupational superannuation benefits those with a strong attachment to the workforce. Employment in a part-time capacity and/or a low-paid, low status occupation places a significant constraint on the capacity of individuals to accumulate private retirement savings. The policy shift towards this form of retirement income system thus has particular adverse consequences for women. Using micro-simulations this paper estimates the final lump-sums that women with a range of different work and other characteristics could expect to achieve. Adequacy assessments suggest that, even under a fully-matured Superannuation <b>Guarantee</b> <b>Charge</b> system, a typical woman will remain heavily dependent on the age pension in retirement.

40|$|A novel, fully {{decentralized}} {{strategy to}} coordinate charge operation of electric vehicles is proposed in this paper. Based on stochastic switching control of on-board chargers, this strategy ensures high-efficiency charging, reduces load variations to the grid during charging periods, achieves charge completion with high probability, and accomplishes approximate “valley-filling”. Further improvements on the core strategy, including individualized power management, adaptive strategies, and battery support systems, {{are introduced to}} further reduce power fluctuation variances and to <b>guarantee</b> <b>charge</b> completion. Stochastic analysis is performed to establish the main properties of the strategies and to quantitatively show the performance improvements. Compared with the existing decentralized charging strategies, the strategies proposed in this paper can be implemented without any information exchange between grid operators and electric vehicles (EVs), resulting in a communications cost reduction. Additionally, it is shown that by using stochastic charging rules, a grid-supporting battery system with a very small energy capacity can achieve substantial reduction of EV load fluctuations with high confidence. An extensive set of simulations and case studies with real-world data are used to demonstrate {{the benefits of the}} proposed strategies...|$|E

40|$|We {{address the}} {{importance}} of symmetry and symmetry breaking on linear response theories of fermionic BCS superfluids. The linear theory of a noninteracting Fermi gas is reviewed and several consistency constraints are verified. The challenge to formulate linear response theories of BCS superfluids consistent with density and spin conservation laws comes from {{the presence of a}} broken U(1) _EM symmetry associated with electromagnetism (EM) and we discuss two routes for circumventing this. The first route follows Nambu's integral-equation approach for the EM vertex function, but this method is not specific for BCS superfluids. We focus on the second route based on a consistent-fluctuation-of-the order-parameter (CFOP) approach where the gauge transformation and the fluctuations of the order parameter are treated on equal footing. The CFOP approach allows one to explicitly verify several important constraints: The EM vertex satisfies not only a Ward identity which <b>guarantees</b> <b>charge</b> conservation but also a Q-limit Ward identity associated with the compressibility sum rule. In contrast, the spin degrees of freedom associated with another U(1) _z symmetry are not affected by the Cooper-pair condensation that breaks only the U(1) _EM symmetry. As a consequence the collective modes from the fluctuations of the order parameter only couple to the density response function but decouple from the spin response function, which reflects the different fates of the two U(1) symmetries in the superfluid phase. Our formulation lays the ground work for application to more general theories of BCS-Bose Einstein Condensation crossover both above and below T_c.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decades, the life {{insurance}} sector has been {{faced with a}} number of challenges that emerged {{as a result of the}} growing longevity and stagnating birth rates for highly developed societies. In the field of actuarial application one could therefore ask for the implications of (long-term) mortality trends and (short-term) population fluctuation on an insurer's pricing and reserving of pension contracts, particularly in interaction with uncertainty in the capital markets. The first part of the thesis focuses on the mathematical description and projection of the mortality of homogeneous populations or insurance cohorts. Besides a survey of the most important representatives, a comprehensive analysis and comparison of stochastic and deterministic mortality forecasting models is carried out. In the second part a full stochastic model approach for two typical old-age provision products is set up and applied in terms of a management of longevity risk. On the one hand, a deferred conventional life annuity is analysed with regard to the combined effects of stochastic mortality and interest rates on different premium principles and risk capital allocation. On the other hand, a modern unit-linked annuity insurance, namely a deferred variable annuity contract, with an additional guaranteed minimum death benefit during the deferment period and a minimum income benefit at retirement is discussed. Mathematically, the guarantees represent options on the greater of the net asset value and a predetermined insurance benefit.

40|$|One {{of the key}} {{objectives}} of any retirement system (in Australia, termed superannuation) is to ensure the efficient and effective transformation of retirement savings into retirement income. Australia’s policy of mandated superannuation contributions (a legislated percentage of wages and salary) was formulated {{in response to a}} low level of private saving, government concern over the existing economic environment and anticipation of an ageing population that was to demand greater pension support than fiscal capacity could deliver. Since its inception in 1992, the mandated Superannuation <b>Guarantee</b> <b>Charge</b> (SGC) has been accompanied by a range of tax incentives to save for retirement. While the SGC is admirable in forcing/mandating behavioural change with people saving for retirement; concerns surround the ‘tax concessions’ with the superannuation system and whether they are delivering value for money. The Australian Treasury estimated the cost of such concessions to have exceeded $ 24 billion in fiscal 2012. In this paper we explore whether the taxation incentives provided to superannuation contributors in Australia are a form of public good. Economists typically think of public goods as representing non-excludable and non-rivalrous consumption. Public goods can be considered as providing a ‘net benefit’ accruing to the community arising from government expenditure. Following the extant literature in the field, we frame our discussion regarding superannuation tax concessions around the received cost-benefit approach to decision-making, based upon three key criteria. The criteria comprise: the cost of the expenditure (including the valuation or discount rate to apply); the benefit the expenditure creates; and the spillover effect of any structural externalities that may arise. These three criteria provide the means to link the economic aspects of a public good to its social welfare consequences...|$|E
40|$|Almost {{all sources}} of high energy {{particles}} and photons {{are associated with}} jet phenomena. Prominent sources of such highly relativistic outflows are pulsar winds and Active Galactic Nuclei. The current understanding of these jets assumes diluted plasmas which are best described as kinetic phenomena. In this kinetic description particle acceleration to ultra-relativistic speeds can occur in completely unmagnetized and neutral plasmas through insetting effects of instabilities. Even though the morphology and nature of particle spectra are understood to a certain extent, {{the composition of the}} jets is not known yet. While Poynting-flux dominated jets are certainly composed of electron-positron plasmas, the understanding of the governing physics in AGN jets is mostly unclear. In this article we investigate how the constituting elements of an electron-positron-proton plasma behave differently under the variation of the fundamental mass-ratio m_p/m_e. We studied initially unmagnetized counterstreaming plasmas using fully relativistic three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations to investigate the influence of the mass-ratio on particle acceleration and magnetic field generation in electron-positron-proton plasmas. We covered a range of mass-ratios m_p/m_e between 1 and 100 with a particle number composition of n_{p^+}/n_{e^+} of 1 in one stream, only protons are injected in the other, whereas electrons are present in both to <b>guarantee</b> <b>charge</b> neutrality in the simulation box. We find that with increasing proton mass the instability takes longer to develop and for mass-ratios > 20 the particles seem to be accelerated in two phases which can be accounted to the individual instabilities of the different species. This means that for high mass ratios the coupling between electrons/positrons and the heavier protons, which occurs in low mass-ratios, disappears. Comment: 15 pages, 6 figure...|$|E
40|$|Superannuation {{is a form}} {{of savings}} for retirement. The savings are {{invested}} and earn income, but the proceeds are generally not available until the beneficiary reaches retirement age The federal government 2 ̆ 7 s retirement income policy has three components, two of which relate to superannuation: the age pension, which provides income support to men aged 65 and over and to women aged 62 and over. 2 The pension is means tested and does not depend on previous labour force participation or individual contributions; a compulsory superannuation scheme (under the Superannuation <b>Guarantee</b> <b>Charge</b> (Administration) Act 1992 (SGA Act)), which requires contributions to be made by employers on behalf of all employees, whether full-time, part-time or casual; 3 and encouragement, through the taxation system, of voluntary contributions to approved superannuation funds. 4 In May 2002, the government released a report, the "Intergenerational Report", 5 which identifies issues associated with Australia 2 ̆ 7 s ageing population and considers the fiscal implications of those changes. The Report noted that a steadily ageing population is likely to place significant pressure on government finances. It also noted that one of the key priorities for ensuring fiscal sustainability should be "maintaining a retirement income policy that encourages private saving for retirement and reduces the future demand for the Age Pension". 6 The main way the government has sought to encourage that private saving is through the tax system, primarily by the use of tax concessions. Over the past 20 years, however, the taxation of superannuation has grown in an extremely ad hoc manner and is now inequitable, inefficient and overly complex. This article suggests that the taxation of superannuation in Australia is in urgent need of a complete review. The article further asserts that, if an appropriate framework can be devised, changes could be introduced as budgetary pressures allow. <br /...|$|E

40|$|The {{maximum power}} {{conversion}} efficiency of a solar cell {{as defined by the}} Shockley-Queisser (SQ) radiative recombination limit relies {{on the assumption that the}} collection probability for all photogenerated electron/hole pairs is unity. This assumption implies a virtually infinite mobility mu(n) of the photogenerated charge carriers. In order to compute the radiative efficiency limit with finite mobilities, we solve the continuity equation for minority carrier transport including an additional photon recycling term that accounts for emission of photons by radiative recombination and their subsequent reabsorption. This approach quantitatively connects the SQ approach with the classical diode theory. Even when assuming radiative recombination as the only loss mechanism, the maximum efficiency achievable within our model is reduced drastically when mu(n) drops below a critical value. This critical value depends on the absorption coefficient, the doping density of the absorber material, as well as on the thickness and the light trapping scheme of the solar cell. Thus, these material and device parameters gain a fundamental importance as soon as finite carrier mobility is considered. Our theory yields a criterion that has to be fulfilled by any photovoltaic material in order to <b>guarantee</b> <b>charge</b> separation even in an otherwise most ideal case. Exemplary application of our model to three real photovoltaic materials, crystalline silicon (c-Si), amorphous silicon (a-Si:H), as well as Cu(In,Ga) Se- 2 (CIGS), shows that mobilities of c-Si and CIGS are three, respectively, 1 order of magnitude above this critical limit whereas the effective hole mobilities in a-Si:H are scattered around the critical value.

40|$|Regulation {{has played}} a {{significant}} role in shaping the financial services sector in Australia over the past few decades. Regulatory changes have included the establishment of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA), floating the Australian dollar, allowing foreign financial institutions to operate domestically, the introduction of the superannuation <b>guarantee</b> <b>charge,</b> and the removal of interest rate controls. As the economy emerges from the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, a new force of change that is recognised as one of the most significant sources of risk and opportunity facing the business community in the foreseeable future has come to the forefront: climate change. Climate change is expected to be a significant change agent in the financial services sector as extreme weather patterns, sea level rises and atmospheric changes impact on asset values (both investment and lending), project finance and risk products. The financial services industry will particularly be affected by these developments, both as a provider of financial products (capital, credit, investment, advice and insurance) and through its powerful influence on the economy in terms of capital allocation. In addition, industry constituents will be impacted significantly by government regulation in this area (reporting, emissions trading and environmental policies) with respect to both their own business practices and those of their clients. This study reports the results of interviews conducted with senior members of the finance sector working in the sustainability area to gauge their perceptions of the challenges facing the sector with respect to climate change. Our results confirm that that regulatory intervention will be critical to climate change response gaining traction and momentum. In particular, regulatory certainty will promote engagement, especially in relation to the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (CPRS), with other developments needed in terms of information disclosure, performance and remuneration, and incentive programs. Accordingly, the significant potential risks and opportunities that climate change presents to the sector, and to the broader economy, will in part be managed/realised only if a swift and significant regulatory response is achieved.

40|$|On 21 September 1999 Division 152 was {{inserted}} into the Income Tax Assessment Act (1997) (ITAA 1997). It was subsequently subject to amendments in 2006. Division 152 contains the small business CGT concessions, which enables eligible small business taxpayers {{to reduce the amount}} of tax payable on capital gains arising from certain CGT events (including the sale of the small business itself) that occur after 11 : 45 am on 21 September 1999. One of the stated principal objectives of the legislation was to provide a concessionary regime for small business owners who did not have the same ability to access the concessionary superannuation regime (particularly the superannuation <b>guarantee</b> <b>charge)</b> generally available to employees. The then Federal Treasurer, Mr Peter Costello, when announcing the introduction of the concessions, specifically stated that the object of Div 152 was to provide “small business people with access to funds for retirement or expansion”. The purpose of this project is to: one, assess the extent to which small business taxpayers understand the CGT small business concessions, particularly when considering sale of their business; two, determine which of the four small business CGT concessions are being adopted and/or recommended by tax advisors to clients; and three, determine whether the recent superannuation changes announced by the Federal Government in relation to the capping of the concessional superannuation thresholds have had an impact on the use of the small business retirement concession. It is anticipated that the results of this study will reveal that that small business owners are reliant on their tax advisors to explain the operation of Division 152. It is plausible that give the complexity of the CGT concessions, most small business owners are completely unaware of the four small business CGT concessions contained in Division 152 and do not understand how these concessions apply. Our study will also reveal the extent to which each CGT small business concession has been adopted (and reasons why). In particular, emphasis will be placed on the adoption of the small business retirement concession contained in Subdivision 152 -D (and specific reasons for its adoption). This study also seeks to understand whether the recent (and impending) changes to the concessional superannuation cap has resulted in the retirement concession being more widely adopted (or recommended) by tax advisors. We would expect that the results of our study to confirm this to be the case, particularly coupled with the recent economic downturn, which has led to lower superannuation fund balances. By providing accounting firms with this information, small business owners will benefit from the information, becoming better placed to be long-term self funded retirees, providing not only financial benefits to the individuals and the country, but a significant increase in social self-assurance by these members of the community...|$|E
40|$|In this work, {{we treat}} the Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) {{equations}} {{as the basis}} for a consistent framework of the electrokinetic effects. The static limit of the PNP equations is shown to be the charge-conserving Poisson-Boltzmann (CCPB) equation, with <b>guaranteed</b> <b>charge</b> neutrality within the computational domain. We propose a surface potential trap model that attributes an energy cost to the interfacial charge dissociation. In conjunction with the CCPB, the surface potential trap can cause a surface-specific adsorbed charge layer σ. By defining a chemical potential μ that arises from the charge neutrality constraint, a reformulated CCPB can be reduced to the form of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation, whose prediction of the Debye screening layer profile is in excellent agreement with that of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation when the channel width is much larger than the Debye length. However, important differences emerge when the channel width is small, so the Debye screening layers from the opposite sides of the channel overlap with each other. In particular, the theory automatically yields a variation of σ that is generally known as the “charge regulation” behavior, attendant with predictions of force variation as a function of nanoscale separation between two charged surfaces that are in good agreement with the experiments, with no adjustable or additional parameters. We give a generalized definition of the ζ potential that reflects the strength of the electrokinetic effect; its variations with the concentration of surface-specific and surface-nonspecific salt ions are shown to be in good agreement with the experiments. To delineate the behavior of the electro-osmotic (EO) effect, the coupled PNP and Navier-Stokes equations are solved numerically under an applied electric field tangential to the fluid-solid interface. The EO effect is shown to exhibit an intrinsic time dependence that is noninertial in its origin. Under a step-function applied electric field, a pulse of fluid flow is followed by relaxation to a new ion distribution, owing to the diffusive counter current. We have numerically evaluated the Onsager coefficients associated with the EO effect, L_{ 21 }, and its reverse streaming potential effect, L_{ 12 }, and show that L_{ 12 }=L_{ 21 } in accordance with the Onsager relation.

40|$|Tax {{avoidance}} is {{a problem}} in every modern tax system, specifically when businesses and personal transactions are overwhelmed by the impact of high tax rates. In the case of Duke of Westminster (1936), the courts had traditionally permitted taxpayers to diminish their tax liabilities. There are two ways to escape paying taxable liability: one is tax avoidance, which is legal and the other is tax evasion, which is illegal. The form approach, instead of the substance approach, was traditionally applied by the courts in tax cases and an arrangement was allowed, whether tax avoidance was or was not the purpose of the arrangement. When an arrangement involves an "anti-avoidance" section, the courts usually disregard the condition of tax avoidance arrangement. Tax mitigation is one example of this rule. There are two "anti-avoidance" sections in the Income Tax Act 1994 : specific anti-avoidance provision and general anti-avoidance provision. Tax avoidance arrangement is affirmed in the case of McGukian and the Commissioner. Part IVA is the current anti-avoidance provision of Australia income tax legislation. It is applicable when a tax advantage is gained from the arrangement by the taxpayer. There are a few federal taxes (e. g. FBT, superannuation <b>guarantee</b> <b>charge</b> and income tax etc.) that have been falsely avoided from being paid and have been found as crimes under the Crimes Act 1980. Trying to avoid tax on a tax haven income is a crime. A general anti-avoidance provision is applicable when a taxpayer has received an advantage in association with the arrangement that was committed. It is important to examine all corners of a tax planning scheme for possible tax benefits. Tax benefits have amendments propositions and the reasonable test will be amended. The Income Tax Assessment Act 1891 was the first income tax act in New Zealand and during the 20 th century, there were other acts that followed at different times: the Land and Income Tax Act 1923, the Land and Income Tax Act 1954, the Income Tax Act 1976, and the Income Tax Act 1994. Goods and Services Tax Act was first introduced on 1 October 1986. Both sections 76 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 and BG 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 contain the same wordings. Section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act defines tax avoidance arrangement. Section 76 (8) defines "tax avoidance". Section BG 1 is designed to counteract the tax avoidance arrangement. The definition of arrangement contains three elements: agreement, contract and plan or understanding. The definition of tax avoidance raises doubts in the case of BNZI where tax avoidance existed in downstream transactions. Tax mitigation and tax avoidance are distinguished but may not solve all problems globally. Case K 52 (1988) 10 NZTC 426 is another example of a tax avoidance arrangement. The interpretation problems of the Act (s 99) can be ameliorated by a succinct analysis of the scheme of the legislation and the purpose of the legislation...|$|E
40|$|We give a short {{review of}} {{recently}} obtained results {{on a new}} lattice formulation of the non-linear change of variables which was once called the Cho [...] Faddeev [...] Niemi decomposition in SU(2) Yang-Mills theory. Based on this formulation, we proposed a new gauge-invariant definition of the magnetic monopole current which <b>guarantees</b> the magnetic <b>charge</b> quantization. We also demonstrated the magnetic monopole dominance in the string tension in SU(2) Yang-Mills theory on a lattice. Our formulation enables one to reproduce in the gauge-invariant way remarkable results obtained so far only in the Maximally Abelian gauge. Comment: 7 pages, talk presented at Lattice 2006 (Confinement and Topology...|$|R
5000|$|Until 2010 {{there was}} a federal tax credit equal to 50% of the cost to buy and install a home-based {{charging}} station with a maximum credit of [...] for each station. Businesses qualified for tax credits up to [...] for larger installations. These credits expired on December 31, 2010, but were extended through 2013 with a reduced tax credit equal to 30% with a maximum credit of up to [...] for each station for individuals and up to [...] for commercial buyers. In 2016, the Obama administration and several stake holders announced $4.5 billion in loan <b>guarantees</b> for public <b>charge</b> stations, along with other iniatives.|$|R
50|$|As the now-arrested Alexis {{goes through}} a roller coaster of legal tribulations, {{including}} possibly being tried for attempted murder and being denied bail for attempting to kill Christina and the unborn baby instead of getting a misdemeanor sentence, Claire decides to makes a deal with Wilhelmina, who is of course behind the harsh sentence {{in an effort to}} get back at her former ally and buy out her stake in Meade Publications, thanks to her affair with the DA. Wilhelmina then offers Alexis to drop her charges in exchange of her share of the publication. As Alexis discovers Wilhelmina's plans, Alexis turns down Wilhelmina's offer. But Claire, who knows all about Wilhelmina and the DA (since Claire has given money to the DA's campaign) adds an incentive part to the deal that <b>guarantees</b> all <b>charges</b> against Alexis being dropped by splitting all of Alexis' shares of Meade Publications between Daniel and Wilhelmina (even though it will go to the unborn child), thus making them 50-50 partners and co-editors-in-chief of Mode. Claire tells Wilhelmina the importance of family as something she does not understand, much to Willi's chagrin. In the end, Wilhelmina is pleased with the deal, then hints to Marc that when she gets the other half she'll be much closer to ruling Meade Publications.|$|R
40|$|In this chapter, {{we propose}} {{a method for}} the utility grid {{operator}} and aggregators to coordinate multiple grid-connected electric vehicles (EVs) so as to provide electricpower ancillary services accounting for quality-of-service (QoS) <b>guarantees</b> for EV <b>charging</b> in a multilevel vehicle-to-grid (V 2 G) system. This method includes applying consensus-algorithm-based distributed control, designing the control objective functions and constraints for providing ancillary services, and designing the constraints for charging/discharging power schedules and the individual QoS requirements of EVs. The consensus-algorithm-based distributed control consists of operation protocols for control and communication among the utility grid operator, aggregators, and EVs, calculating the control signals in the utility grid operator and aggregators, determining the optimal charging/discharging power schedules of EVs so as to provide a required type of ancillary services as well as satisfy the QoS requirements of EVs...|$|R
50|$|The Geneva Conventions {{guarantee}} combatants {{the right}} not {{to be put on}} trial for fighting in a war - unless they commit a war crime (a grave breach) or other crime (e.g., captured behind enemy lines out of proper uniforms or insignia while carrying out espionage or sabotage operations). Most held under the Geneva Conventions are not accused of a crime and therefore it would be a war crime under the Geneva Conventions to give them a trial. This protection against getting a trial is fully consistent with human rights law because human rights law prohibits putting people on trial when there is no crime to try them for. The Geneva Conventions however <b>guarantee</b> that anyone <b>charged</b> with a war crime or other crime must get a fair trial.|$|R
