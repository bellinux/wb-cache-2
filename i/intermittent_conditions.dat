40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} adverse effects of {{familiarity}} and human factors issues associated with the reliability of low-cost warning devices at level crossings. The driving simulator study featured a repetitive, low workload, monotonous driving task in which there were no failures of the level crossing (control) or prolonged or intermittent right-side failures (where the device reverts to a safe failure mode). The results of the experiment provided mixed support for the familiarity hypothesis. Four of the 23 participants collided with the train when it first appeared on trial 10 but safety margins increased from the first train to the next presentation of a train (trial 12). Contrary to expectations, the safety margins decreased with repeated right-side failure only for the <b>intermittent</b> <b>condition.</b> The limited head movement data showed that participants in the prolonged failure condition {{were more likely to}} turn their head to check for trains in the right-side failure trials than in earlier trials where there was no signal and no train.

Overall, the software is flexible and easy to use, allowing the user to specify the emission concentration pattern, the gas concentration pattern, as well as the spraying cycle periods for up to two different emission patterns per day.

40|$|In this study, we {{analyzed}} changes to gastropod assemblages {{with regard to}} the seasonal variations of discharge, substrate composition and temperature in 19 springs in northwestern Bosnia and Herzegovina. Six aquatic gastropod species were identified, including Bosnidilhia vreloana Boeters, Glöer & Pešić, 2013 and Islamia dmitroviciana Boeters, Glöer & Pešić, 2013, two species endemic for the studied area. Surprisingly, we did not observe a significant influence of discharge on the composition of gastropod assemblages in the studied springs. This could mean that gastropod assemblages in the springs examined are well adapted to <b>intermittent</b> <b>conditions</b> (i. e. fluctuations in discharge). The results of canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) showed that specific substrate types can be good predictors for the occurrence of particular species. Interestingly, we found that spring specialists such as Bythinella schmidti and Islamia dmitroviciana also inhabit springs with intermittent dry periods. The studied springs should be considered at risk and some of their gastropod dwellers, such as the endemics Bosnidilhia vreloana and Islamia dmitroviciana, are possibly endangered, requiring conservation planning to protect these spring habitats...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} long term {{anaerobic}} and intermittent anaerobic/aerobic starvation {{on the structure}} and activity of aerobic granules was studied. Aerobic granular sludge treating abattoir wastewater and achieving high levels of nutrient removal was subjected to 4 - 5 week starvation under anaerobic and <b>intermittent</b> anaerobic/aerobic <b>conditions.</b> Microscopic pictures of granules {{at the beginning of}} the starvation period presented a round and compact surface morphology with a much defined external perimeter. Under both starvation conditions, the morphology changed at the end of starvation with the external border of the granules surrounded by floppy materials. The loss of granular compactness was faster and more pronounced under anaerobic/aerobic starvation conditions. The release of Ca(2 +) at the onset of anaerobic/aerobic starvation suggests a degradation of extracellular polymeric substances. The activity of ammonia oxidizing bacteria was reduced by 20 and 36 % during anaerobic and intermittent anaerobic/aerobic starvation, respectively. When fresh wastewater was reintroduced, the granules recovered their initial morphology within 1 week of normal operation and the nutrient removal activity recovered fully in 3 weeks.

Bivalves were less diversified, represented only by Pisidium pulchellum? and Eupera simoni?. The taxonomic composition and {{the small size of}} many species reflect the <b>intermittent</b> <b>condition</b> of the basin. Additionally, the occurrence of shells of five terrestrial species (Helicina angulata, Gastrocopta pellucida hordeacella?, Beckianum beckianum, Succinea sp. and Systrophiidae gen. et sp. indet.) in the rivers reflects the occasional heavy rainfalls and floods in the region. The invasive gastropod M. tuberculata was the most abundant and widely distributed species. All 13 species were found in the lower course, in the Atlantic Forest region, and most, but not all, were recorded in the upper course, in the Caatinga region. The distribution and the occurrence of the bivalve species exclusively in the Atlantic Forest region indicate that the locally higher annual precipitation provides favorable conditions for the survival of these mollusks, such as a more stable hydroperiod...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a solution for}} battery-less power management circuits for micro-power energy converters, allowing energy harvesting systems to operate under continuous and <b>intermittent</b> <b>conditions.</b> The proposed trigger circuit is a fully passive, normally open, single pole, single throw, analog switch driven by a nano-power CMOS control unit. The trigger circuit starts in an OPEN state until the voltage, at its input terminal, reaches a high threshold, when it toggles to the CLOSED state. Once the input voltage drops below a low threshold, the trigger circuit returns to the OPEN state. In the CLOSED state, the trigger circuit creates a low resistance path between the input and output terminals, while at the OPEN state the input is isolated from the output. A first prototype was breadboarded by using discrete components {{for the sake of}} performance evaluation. Low threshold voltages (2. 15 V and 1. 15 V), sub-ohm CLOSED-state resistance, and power consumption requirements (in the order of 55. 9 and 167. 7 nW), coupled with relatively high energy extraction capabilities are confirmed by experimental results. These features put our proposed circuit among the best {{of its kind in the}} state-of-the-art circuits. To prove the effectiveness of the proposed trigger circuit, we have included it into a custom battery-less power management circuit for a piezoelectric energy harvesting system. The system was proven to work even under intermittent operating conditions, and lock-up phenomena, related to current surge effect, were avoided...|$|E
40|$|Schumpeter {{asserted}} {{that there were}} two types of business cycle theories: one in which cycles reflected dampened economic behavior and another in which cycles reflect explosive economic behavior. Both of these theories allowed that cycles could be either monotonic or oscillating. In this working paper, Domenico Delli Gatti, Mauro Gallegati, and Levy Institute Distinguished Scholar Hyman P. Minsky expand the alternative types of theory to three by adding one in which cycles reflect nonoscillating time series, wavelike motions, and incoherent behavior, such as those witnessed in times of runaway inflation and debt deflations. In Gatti, Gallegati, and Minsky's business cycle theory, "cycles result from the combination of endogenous interactions that can lead to incoherence" and the effects of institutions to contain these tendencies in the economy. The authors construct an accelerator-multiplier model that reflects the idea that "times series that can generate smooth growth and well-behaved cycles as possible transitory results of the economic process, but that also allow for <b>intermittent</b> <b>conditions</b> conducive to the emergence of incoherence or turbulence. " This turbulence, however, can be contained by institutional factors that act as circuit breakers on the economy. Whenever institutionally determined values dominate endogenously determined values, the path of the economy is broken and an interactive process, which starts with new initial conditions, generates future values. Specifically, whenever the economy threatens to behave incoherently, these stabilizers, whether built-in or activated by government authority, prevent the economy from continuing on the prior determined path. ...|$|E
40|$|Muscle fatigue models (MFM) have broad {{potential}} application if {{they can}} accurately predict muscle capacity and/or endurance time during the execution of diverse tasks. As an initial step toward facilitating improved MFMs, we assessed the sensitivity of selected existing models to their inherent parameters, specifically that model the fatigue and recovery processes, and the accuracy of model predictions. These evaluations were completed for both prolonged and intermittent isometric contractions, and were based on model predictions of endurance times. Based on a recent review of the literature, four MFMs were initially chosen, from which a preliminary assessment led to two of these being considered for more comprehensive evaluation. Both models had a higher sensitivity to their fatigue parameter. Predictions of both models were also {{more sensitive to the}} alteration of their parameters in conditions involving lower to moderate levels of effort, though such conditions may be of most practical, contemporary interest or relevance. Although both models yielded accurate predictions of endurance times during prolonged contractions, their predictive ability was inferior for more complex (<b>intermittent)</b> <b>conditions.</b> When optimizing model parameters for different loading conditions, the recovery parameter showed considerably larger variability, which might be related to the inability of these MFMs in simulating the recovery process under different loading conditions. It is argued that such models may benefit in future work from improving their representation of recovery process, particularly how this process differs across loading conditions...|$|E
