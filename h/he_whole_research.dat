40|$|INTRODUCTION: whole {{systems of}} {{healthcare}} offer unique methodological and theoretical challenges for researchers. Herbalism {{has its own}} set of methodological and philosophical research issues that are beyond those presented for <b>whole</b> system <b>research</b> in general. It was our objective to explore various conceptual and methodological issues surrounding <b>whole</b> system herbal <b>research.</b> METHODS: an International Society for Complementary Medicine Research workshop, Challenges in Herbal <b>Whole</b> System <b>Research,</b> was presented. Starting from a definition of herbalism, the most important challenges to herbal <b>whole</b> system <b>research</b> were elicited with inputs from both the workshop presenters and the audience. RESULTS: five major challenges unique to herbal <b>whole</b> system <b>research</b> were identified: (1) defining herbalists and herbalism, (2) the role of the natural products industry in herbal research, (3) designing placebos and delivering active herbal treatments as given by herbalists, (4) researching the herb as a living entity, and (5) designing trials to investigate and develop multicomponent herbal therapies. CONCLUSIONS: unique methods and theoretical frameworks are required to design studies of herbalism. Solutions to these methodological challenges need to be addressed to conduct research that examines herbal systems of medicine versus conducting trials on individual herbs given out of their original therapeutic contex...|$|R

50|$|Internal {{validity}} is an inductive {{estimate of}} the degree to which conclusions about causal relationships can be made (e.g. cause and effect), based on the measures used, the research setting, and the <b>whole</b> <b>research</b> design. Good experimental techniques, in which the effect of an independent variable on a dependent variable is studied under highly controlled conditions, usually allow for higher degrees of internal validity than, for example, single-case designs.|$|R
