5000|$|In {{the early}} 1870s, William Stanley Jevons, Carl Menger, and Leon Walras each reintroduced {{the theory of}} {{marginal}} utility. During discussions of which of those three {{had been the first}} to formulate the theory, a colleague of Jevons discovered a copy of Die Entwicklung. However, the discovery (in 1878) came several years after the three principals in the Marginal Revolution had published their own books, and significant differences with Gossen’s original contributions were overlooked.A century later (1983) Gossen’s book was translated into English. In his introduction to the book, Nicholas Georgescu Roegen, a prominent American economist (Distinguished Fellow of the American Economics Association), strongly supported Gossen’s vision, which stands in opposition to the neoclassical orthodoxy that utility (satisfaction) <b>is</b> <b>properly</b> <b>identified</b> with consumables in basic (utility) theory rather than consumption activity: ...|$|E
5000|$|The actual {{aircraft}} used in {{the series}} was a SCAN Type 30, a license-built copy of a Grumman Widgeon seaplane, U.S. registry N4453. It was manufactured by the Société Construction Aéro-Navale (aka SCAN) in Rochelle, France in 1951 but not initially completed with engines because of unsatisfactory results achieved previously on other SCAN Type 30 Widgeons with various engines available there. Instead, it was disassembled and stored until 1967 when it was imported into the US, re-assembled, and finally completed using seven cylinder, 300 hp Lycoming model R-680 radial engines in what was called a Mansdorf Gannet conversion. [...] It {{was one of the}} few Widgeons converted with radial engines, and it is often mistaken for a Grumman Goose. Note however that although it is technically certified under the same FAA type certificate no.A-734 because it was not built actually by Grumman, it is incorrect to identify it as a Grumman Widgeon; it <b>is</b> <b>properly</b> <b>identified</b> as a SCAN Type 30 Widgeon because it was built actually by SCAN.|$|E

40|$|As the {{navigation}} solution of exclusion-based RAIM follows {{from a combination}} of least-squares estimation and a statistically based exclusion-process, the computation of the integrity of {{the navigation}} solution has to take the propagated uncertainty of the combined estimation-testing procedure into account. In this contribution, we analyse, theoretically as well as empirically, the effect that this combination has on the first statistical moment, i. e., the mean, of the computed navigation solution. It will be shown, although statistical testing is intended to remove biases from the data, that biases will always remain under the alternative hypothesis, even when the correct alternative hypothesis <b>is</b> <b>properly</b> <b>identified.</b> The a posteriori exclusion of a biased satellite range from the position solution will therefore never remove the bias in the position solution completely.

40|$|Abstract: A {{relatively}} {{new class of}} linepipe steels with yield strength above 500 MPa created for thermomechanical processing at temperatures in excess of 1473 K (1200 C) has established a firm foothold {{in the market for}} modern, large diameter, and high pressure gas transmission systems. The design concept for the steels takes advantage of the enhanced role which higher levels of niobium can play in very low carbon steels, during the plate manufacturing process. The transformation products observed after cooling have been interpreted in conflicting ways in the literature, using ambiguous terms which are not established rigorously. Revealing characterisation-experiments have therefore been conducted to establish that the principal transformation product grows by a displacive transformation mechanism, and that it <b>is</b> <b>properly</b> <b>identified</b> as bainite. The implications of this, both on the interpretation of microstructure and on the processing of the steel, are discussed. ...|$|E

30|$|The {{focus of}} this paper was on travellers’ route choices under ATIS. In particular, an {{experiment}} was carried out by considering different inaccuracy levels and different kinds of information: prescriptive; mixed; mixed with augmented information. On the basis of the data collected two different kinds of analyses were made: the first studied the warm-up phase of the experiment in order to determine from which trial of our repeated choice experiment suitable data for our route choice analysis can first be extracted. This analysis was based on the use of several warm-up indicators and statistical tests. The empirical approach adopted is suggested for similar kinds of studies. Once the warm-up phase <b>is</b> <b>properly</b> <b>identified,</b> the second analysis aimed to assess the effect of information (with reference to different kinds of information and its reliability) on travellers’ route choice behaviour. Non-parametric statistical tests showed that the respondents can be considered to have concluded the warm-up phase from trial 20 onwards.|$|E
40|$|Over the years, many {{researchers}} have proposed theoretical models of problem-solving. These models work {{a problem in}} a sequential and rational manner. Through our professional experience and an action research study, we discovered fundamental differences between what these models describe and what actually happens when problems are solved in a real-world setting. Assisting with a process improvement experience in a plastics company, we discovered that when a problem <b>is</b> <b>properly</b> <b>identified,</b> problem-solving generally follows the theoretical models. However, when a problem is difficult to identify, problem-solving proceeds in a cyclical and apparently irrational manner. Cyclical problem-solving increases the average time of problem-solving and production cost. The authors find that the relationships among the problem-solving steps are much more complex than implied in existing literature. Incorporating this new understanding into process improvement training reduced the variability of the problem-solving time from 44 to 21 min. problem solving; process improvement; action research; plastics industry. ...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the main}} tools in phenomenological studies is the {{identification}} of correlations among different processes. This is essentially effected in retrospective with the specific aim of finding a positive result, and {{that leads to a}} parameter optimization which introduces a bias, so far only marginally considered, in the significance level of the results. If the correlation can be validated in a forward study in which parameters are kept fixed, such a bias is irrelevant. Unfortunately, forward studies are often infeasible for either cost or intrinsic reasons. This is the case of geophysics, due to the comparatively long time scale of recurrence of the phenomena. Unbiased estimates can be obtained in retrospective if each of the optimal choices <b>is</b> <b>properly</b> <b>identified</b> and accounted for. An estimate of the bias is made in a specific case, which can be written in closed form. While simulation confirms its good performance, the latter shows that apparently highly significant retrospective correlations may be insignificant...|$|E

40|$|Sixteen {{years after}} Kim's seminal paper {{offering}} a welcomed {{analysis of the}} emergence concept, I propose in this paper a needed extension of Kim's work that does more justice to the actual diversity of emergentism. Rather than defining emergence as a monolithic third way between reductive physicalism and substance pluralism, and this through a conjunction of supervenience and (functional) irreducibility, I develop a comprehensive taxonomy of the possible varieties of emergence in which each taxon – theoretical, explanatory and causal emergence – <b>is</b> <b>properly</b> <b>identified</b> and defined. This taxonomy has two advantages. First, it is unificatory {{in the sense that}} the taxa it contains derive from a common unity principle, which consequently constitutes the very hallmark of emergentism. Second, it can be shown that the emergence taxa it contains are able to meet the challenges that are commonly considered as being the hot topics on the emergentists' agenda, namely the positivity, the consistency and the triviality/liberality challenges...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Terrain {{variations}} {{can greatly}} influence autonomous ground vehicle (AGV) performance. However, if the terrain <b>is</b> <b>properly</b> <b>identified,</b> the AGV control {{systems can be}} adjusted to better suit the terrain. Current terrain classification techniques are largely based on vision and terrain dependent vehicle reactions. But at this time both methods have limitations. Visual methods can easily be fooled by fallen leaves or other superficial ground coverings, whereas responsebased methods yield poor results when the AGV speed is {{significantly different from the}} training speeds. In addition, current response-based methods are not capable of identifying the multiple terrains that a vehicle may simultaneously traverse, e. g., when one subset of wheels is on-road and one is off-road. This paper proposes a response-based method called Terrain Input Classification to solve the issue of speed dependency and multiple terrain traversal. This method is dependent upon knowing the vibration transfer function of the AGV. The method has been verified through terrain-based simulation results and is ready for experimental testing...|$|E
