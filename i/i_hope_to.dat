25|$|You cannot surely mean {{to degrade}} the Joan of Arc into a pot girl. You are not going, <b>I</b> <b>hope,</b> <b>to</b> annex to that most splendid {{ornament}} of Southey's poem all this cock and a bull story of Joan the publican's daughter of Neufchatel, with the lamentable episode of a waggoner, his wife, and six children; the texture {{will be most}} lamentably disproportionate. The first forty or fifty lines of these addenda are, no doubt, in their way, admirable, too; but many would prefer the Joan of Southey.|$|E
25|$|I wish {{to express}} my heartfelt horror at the {{indiscriminate}} terrorist attacks committed against innocent people of the United States yesterday. While {{it is still not}} clear who carried out the attack, it must be stated that no right-thinking follower of Islam could possibly condone such an action. The Qur'an equates the murder of one innocent person with the murder of the whole of humanity. We pray for the families of all those who lost their lives in this unthinkable act of violence as well as all those injured; <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> reflect the feelings of all Muslims and people around the world whose sympathies go out to the victims of this sorrowful moment.|$|E

25|$|Next after fine colors, I like plain white. One of my sorrows, {{when the}} summer ends, is that I must put off my cheery and {{comfortable}} white clothes and enter {{for the winter}} into the depressing captivity of the shapeless and degrading black ones. It is mid-October now, and the weather is growing cold {{up here in the}} New Hampshire hills, but it will not succeed in freezing me out of these white garments, for here the neighbors are few, and it is only of crowds that I am afraid. I made a brave experiment, the other night, to see how it would feel to shock a crowd with these unseasonable clothes, and also to see how long it might take the crowd to reconcile itself to them and stop looking astonished and outraged. On a stormy evening I made a talk before a full house, in the village, clothed like a ghost, and looking as conspicuous, all solitary and alone on that platform, as any ghost could have looked; and I found, to my gratification, that it took the house less than ten minutes to forget about the ghost and give its attention to the tidings I had brought.I am nearly seventy-one, and I recognize that my age has given me a good many privileges; valuable privileges; privileges which are not granted to younger persons. Little by little <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> get together courage enough to wear white clothes all through the winter, in New York. It will be a great satisfaction to me to show off in this way; and perhaps the largest of all the satisfactions will be the knowledge that every scoffer, of my sex, will secretly envy me and wish he dared to follow my lead.|$|E

500|$|In the song's opening verse, Harrison {{admits that}} he [...] "Can't say what I'm doing here" [...] in the {{material}} world, a statement that theologian Dale Allison identifies as Kafkaesque until Harrison offers [...] "eschatological hope" [...] with the subsequent line, [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> see much clearer". Harrison then states that he uses his body [...] "like a car / Taking me both near and far". Author Ian Inglis regards this as an apt metaphor, since our bodies [...] "are merely the vehicles that carry us on our journeys".|$|E

The loan deal was confirmed on West Ham's official site with the striker saying, [...] "I didn't have opportunities to play recently, but I did well before and I know I am a very good striker. We played only one striker at Arsenal, so I didn't play a lot, so <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> do so more with West Ham." [...] He played only three games for West Ham without scoring.|$|E
500|$|Lee divided {{his forces}} into {{multiple}} columns, spread apart widely {{as he moved}} into Maryland and also maneuvered to capture the federal arsenal at Harpers Ferry. This was a risky move for a smaller army, but Lee was counting on his knowledge of McClellan's temperament. He told one of his generals, [...] "He is an able general but a very cautious one. His army {{is in a very}} demoralized and chaotic condition, and will not be prepared for offensive operations—or he will not think it so—for three or four weeks.

Nolan's work has also been recognised as an influence on video games. Renowned video game designer Hideo Kojima compared Dunkirk to his own work: [...] "Its approach to technology in movie making and refusal to rely on defeating one's enemies as a portrayal of war, reminds me in many ways of my work on Metal Gear and where <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> see my next game go".

500|$|Somalia was {{represented}} by one male athlete at the 2016 Games in athletics – Mohamed Daud Mohamed, a 5000 metres runner. It marked his first appearance at an international athletics competition, following a transition into athletics from football. He said prior to the Olympics, [...] "I am improving by the day and <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> improve on my finish time. Running is hard and all athletes aim to win. My objective is to win; but there are different ways of winning. It is not about being first, second or third. If I set a new personal record, it is a win for me". Mohamed competed on 17 August in the first heat of the 5000 metres, finishing in 24th position out of the 25 runners, only ahead of Rosefelo Siosi of the Solomon Islands, thus eliminating him from the competition.|$|E
500|$|Zubir is {{estimated}} to have written about 1,500 songs, including those written for Cathay-Keris Film Productions' Malay films in the 1950s and 1960s. Less than 10% of these songs were recorded. On 22 August 2007, Zubir's family {{signed an agreement with}} Universal Music in Malaysia for the latter to manage his works. The copyright in the songs remains with his family. The idea to do so came after his daughter Dr. Rohana met Sandy Monteiro, senior vice-president (Asean) of the Universal Music Publishing Group in 2005 through Monteiro's wife, who was a good friend of hers. Dr. Rohana was reported as saying: [...] "It is time to hand over the songs in order to revive them two decades after my father's passing. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> ensure that his songs continue to live in the hearts of young artists in Malaysia." ...|$|E

500|$|For {{months on}} end Jeannette hardly moved at all; De Long {{recorded}} on March 2 that their position was almost precisely {{what it had}} been three months earlier. On May 5, the ship passed {{to the west of the}} 180° meridian, but two months later had retreated back to the other side of the line. [...] The summer brought no relief; although it briefly seemed possible in August that Jeannette might break free and find open water, this proved a false hope. The condition of Danenhower was a further source of anxiety. His syphilis began to take toll of his body, particularly his left eye which, despite Ambler's repeated operations—stoically endured, given the lack of anesthetic—left the navigator largely incapacitated and unable to perform his duties. On the last day of 1880 De Long wrote in his journal: [...] "I begin the new year by turning over a new leaf, and <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> God we are turning over a new leaf in our book of luck".|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Pretty Girl Rock" [...] was {{directed}} by Joseph Kahn. Hilson told Kahn {{that she did not}} want the video to be about her, since she felt that the song was already very much about herself. During an interview with MTV News while on the set of the video, Hilson explained that in the video she does nine outfit changes because it will show [...] "10 different eras", starting from 1920 and up until 2010, in which she portrays herself. She also said, [...] " [...] way of paying homage to groundbreaking women, strong women who were fearless and so bold and so confident that they made women feel that way...And <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> do the same." [...] Kahn wanted Hilson to pay homage to some female singers in the video. He discussed about it with Hilson, who chose the singers she loved and was inspired by as a youth to appear in the video. The completed video premiered on 106 & Park on November 11, 2010.|$|E

Following his official installation on 8 June 2010, Nesbitt said, [...] "Rather than being just an informal role officiating at ceremonies, I think I can act as an ambassador. I have access to {{an awful lot of}} people and places because of my work. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> be a voice that can be heard, not just at the university, but also outside promoting the importance of the funding of education. If that involves me being at Stormont, then I'd be very happy to do that. Clearly these public spending cuts are going to have an impact and it's important to fight for funding because it's about investing in students and investing in the future of Northern Ireland. I believe I can bring something to that, otherwise I wouldn't have taken this on." ...|$|E

Khánh said Taylor and the US would need to be [...] "more practical and not have a dream of having Vietnam be an image of the United States, because the way of life and people are entirely different." [...] He added that Taylor's [...] "attitude during the last 48 hours—as far as my small head is concerned—has been beyond imagination". Justifying the removal of the HNC, Khánh said they were [...] "exploited by counter-revolutionary elements who placed partisan considerations above the homeland's sacred interest."

[...] Then I began asking older authors, and they told me that 'there are no rules, nor can there be any, for the art of novel-writing.' [...] Then , brought to desperation, I set about trying to resolve for myself the question: [...] 'Can literary art be reduced to general rules?' [...] After several years of observing and thinking, the matter began to get clearer for me, and as early as August 1886 I set down my first notes [...] and, God willing, <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> publish a scientific theory of literary art.

500|$|After {{returning}} from Moncton, Schmirler felt physically well, but suffered a setback when a CAT scan revealed spots around her lungs. The {{decision was made}} not to proceed with further chemotherapy, but she continued with the orthomolecular therapy. She {{had been scheduled to}} work the 2000 Scott Tournament of Hearts, but was unable to do so. She faxed a statement from the hospital, which was read by TSN's Vic Rauter. [...] "I'm still fighting hard and I still hope {{to make it to the}} Brier, not playing but talking. For Saskatchewan, I was hoping to be in your green shoes (at the Scott).
