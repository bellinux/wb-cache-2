50|$|Euphemus was mythologically {{linked to}} the Greek {{colonization}} of Libya and foundation of Cyrene. In Pindar's Pythian Ode 4, the myth of him as the ancestor of the colonizers is recounted {{in the form of}} a prophecy by Medea, and runs as follows. When the Argonauts stop by the lake Tritonis in Libya, they encounter Eurypylus, a son of Poseidon, who offers them a clod of earth as a sign of hospitality. Euphemus takes the clod with instructions to throw it on the ground beside the entrance to the Underworld at Taenarum by which his descendants in the fourth generation would then rule over Libya. The clod is accidentally washed overboard and carried to the island Thera, and Libya is colonized from that island by Battus of Thera, an alleged distant descendant of Euphemus (by 17 generations), who founds Cyrene. The Argonautica by Apollonius Rhodius appears to follow a different version of the same myth: in the poem, when the Argonauts arrive near Lake Tritonis, Euphemus accepts the clod of earth from Triton who first introduces himself as Eurypylus but later reveals his true <b>divine</b> <b>identity.</b> Later, Euphemus has a dream of the clod producing drops of milk and then changing into a woman; in his dream, he has sex with the woman, and at the same time cries over her as if she were nursed by him; she then tells him that she is a daughter of Triton and Libya and the nurse of future children of Euphemus, and instructs him to entrust her to the care of the Nereids, promising that she would return in the future to provide a home for Euphemus' children. Euphemus consults Jason about this dream and, following his advice, throws the clod in the sea, whereupon it transforms into the island Calliste (Thera). The island is later colonized by the descendants of Euphemus who had previously been expelled from Lemnos and failed to find refuge in Sparta.|$|E
40|$|Certain gods in Euripides’ Hippolytos and Herakles {{exhibit a}} high level of control over mortals.

Secondary gods react to the primary god’s will and in so doing help assert/re-assert the primary god’s identity, as does mortal suffering. I apply Austin’s concept of perlocution, an utterance’s action or effect, to define divine motivation and control.

Dissertations, Academic [...] University of Missouri [...] Columbia [...] Classical studies. "May 2011 "[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] This dissertation examines the practical functioning of Roman religion {{and the nature of the}} Roman gods. Roman religion operated as a thaumaturgical polytheistic orthopraxy, a religion that worshipped many gods, emphasized the importance of performing ritual correctly, and was concerned exclusively with this-worldly benefits. As a result, the Romans attempted to maximize their chances of receiving a favorable divine response to any given request by assigning specific divine agency to individual functions and processes. Such a narrowly defined divine identification allowed a more precise targeting of ritual and function, thus increasing the chances of receiving the desired response. This specific narrowing of <b>divine</b> <b>identity</b> occurred in multiple ways. The most common method was aspectualization, the fragmentation of a larger <b>divine</b> <b>identity</b> into smaller aspects, which were often labeled with epithets, for example, Jupiter Optimus Maximus or Jupiter Tonans as aspects of Jupiter. Other methods of narrowing identity included the creation of new, often specific, deities, or the adaptation of existing deities or aspects to a new function. The ultimate result of this process was an extremely flexible religious system, responsive and easily able to adapt to the constantly shifting needs of its practitioners...|$|E

40|$|The {{ministry}} of Jesus moved through times of seeking justice, sharing hospitality, and withdrawing for prayer. Though inescapably “other” {{because of his}} <b>divine</b> <b>identity,</b> he sought solidarity with humans by becoming human and interacting with humanity through hospitable practices. The Ancient Mediterranean customs of hospitality were well-defined, but Jesus took this powerful cultural framework and changed its practice so that it produced reconciliation and justice. This work briefly reviews the practice of hospitality {{in the time of}} Jesus. It also presents the work of scholars identifying linguistic markers that would have cued readers in the Ancient Mediterranean to recognize a story as a hospitality narrative. Using biblical, theological, and philosophical materials, I construct a hermeneutic that equips readers of these narratives to see how Jesus brought justice through his practice of hospitality. When that hermeneutic is applied to our contemporary life narratives, it empowers us as the disciples of Jesus to work alongside God in acting justly in this world...|$|E
40|$|Within {{the wider}} {{framework}} of contemporary debates on primitive NT Christology concerning the early Christians’ {{perception of the}} divinity of Jesus, this work investigates the influence of Hebrew Divine Warrior Traditions (HDWT) on the Markan sea-miracles (Mark 4. 35 - 41; 6. 45 - 52) and exorcisms (Mark 1. 21 - 28; 5. 1 - 20; 7. 24 - 30; 9. 14 - 29).

The present work argues that in the sea-miracles and exorcisms, Mark transfers divine attributes and operations to Jesus, claiming some form of <b>divine</b> <b>identity</b> for Jesus. The findings of this study are then considered in terms of their implications for Mark’s Christology, and located in relation to the work of leading scholars on primitive Christology in general...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{explores the}} {{connection}} between immutability and change {{as a key to}} the relationship between man and God within the thought of Philo of Alexandria. Considering the divine name expressed in Ex. 3, 14, where God presents himself as Being, <b>divine</b> <b>identity</b> is conceived by Philo as essentially exempt from beginning and mutation. On the other hand, man and cosmos are marked by a state of change and their becoming is characterized by fatigue, effort and instability. Starting from this preliminary analysis, the thesis develops the issue of ethical and cognitive human progress toward the transcendent God. Knowledge has the task of reaching the unknowable Being and virtue coincides with platonic assimilation to a God which is however radically dissimilar to man. The relationship between man and God is therefore enlightened by the role of paradox. Paradox was a logic and ethical tool connected to the rational power of the stoic sage. It is converted by Philo toward the act of abdication of the virtuous man who recognizes the radical otherness of God...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{sets the}} Christology of Athanasius of Alexandria {{in the context}} of its sources, and evaluates its reception up to the Council of Chalcedon. His well-known emphasis upon the Son’s divinity is shown to be underpinned and counterpointed by a theological integration of creatio ex nihilo into his Christology. Recognizing the lack of continuity between the soul and divine being, Athanasius insisted upon the need for an ontological understanding of mediation, a project opposed by Arius. This dissertation demonstrates that the influence of Contra Gentes / De Incarnatione’s dynamic emphasis upon the Logos’s <b>divine</b> <b>identity,</b> is evident in both miahypostatic and dyohypostatic Christological trajectories, and that different aspects of the Athanasian corpus are responsible for multi-dimensional Christological developments. The impact of Athanasius is shown by a re-evaluation of Apollinarius, and in an exploration of the development of Christological language in Antiochene and Alexandrian Christologies of the fifth century. The motif of ontological mediation and relation of both natures in the God-Man in these diverse contexts demonstrates that Athanasius’s resolution was pivotal in subsequent Christian theology.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the mosaic of the Crucifixion in the Church of Nea Monì, Chios, {{providing}} an iconographic reading of the Centurion. As has been repeatedly pointed out, with his dark hair and his turban, the Centurion has the distinctive looks of an Arab. Although the turban is often confused with the scarf soldiers used to wear under their helmet, or else with the Jewish tallit, the centurion’s turban seems to be actually inspired by Arabic fashion, as the comparison with the Madrid Skylitzes shows well enough. Connections with eastern costume are further reinforced by the preudo-cufic ornaments embellishing the Centurion’s socks, as well as and by his round shield, which shows the same decoration as the σκουτάρια ραπτά commonly used by the Byzantine army during the Macedonian and Comnenian empire. Thus, the Centurion can be construed as an alter ego of the non-Christians who embraced the orthodox religion after acknowledging the <b>divine</b> <b>identity</b> of Christ. He conveys the same message as the Arab aristocrat depicted under the column of Saint Symeon the Elder in the Menologion of Basil II in the Vatican Library. Macedonian art, I argue, aimed to translate into images the imperial policy directed to the Arabs settled in Constantinople and on the eastern borders, who had been “byzantinized” {{by the power of}} law.

40|$|Autor u članku razrađuje tematiku implicitne (neizravne) kristologije. Temeljeći svoj govor na evanđeoskim izvješćima, iznosi argumente u prilog tvrdnji da razna događanja vezana uz Isusa neizravno govore o njegovu božanskom identitetu i sinovstvu. Tako, analiziranjem Isusova propovijedanja i poučavanja, uspoređivanjem Isusa sa starozavjetnim prorocima, preko njegova ponašanja prema Zakonu, hramu i nekim grupama ljudi, odnosno prema »javnim grešnicima«, upućuje na neke događaje i na njegove izričaje koji implicitno govore o Isusovu božanstvu. Jednako tako, Isusov odnos prema Bogu, kojega on naziva Abba, te neki njegovi »ja« - izričaji također aludiraju na njegovo božansko sinovstvo. Uzimajući sve to u obzir, dolazi se do zaključka da - iako Kristov pashalni događaj, odnosno njegovo uskrsnuće jesu i ostaju glavni temelji vjere koji konačno otkrivaju osobu Isusa Krista - i predpashalna događanja imaju veliku važnost za kristološko razmišljanje, jer također otkrivaju - implicitno — i Isusov božanski identitet. The {{author of}} this article {{examines}} the theme of implicit (indirect) Christology. Basing his presentation on Gospel accounts, he delivers his arguments in favour of the various events associated with the Jesus of Nazareth which indirectly speak of his <b>divine</b> <b>identity</b> and sonship. To begin with, the article examines the most common aspect of the preresurrected Christ; his preaching and teaching. Even though it seemed to many that Jesus was one of many iterant preachers and teachers, or that he was just another prophet, the content, method and originality of Jesus 2 ̆ 7 words and expressions indirectly lead to a conclusion of his divinity. Jesus 2 ̆ 7 behaviour towards Jewish Law, the temple and certain segments of the population, in others words, the »public sinners«, also implicitly awakens faith of him as the Son of God. Namely, with many of his expressions and gestures Jesus gives the impression that he is »above« the Law and temple, or that he brings and declares a new law with which he desires to lead all people to God. Equally so, his behaviour towards people, especially towards the weak and the sinful to whom he forgives sin, indirectly supports that he is God, in other words, the Son of God who has »authority tο forgive sins» (Mk 2 : 10). Therefore, Jesus 2 ̆ 7 behaviour towards fundamental Jewish institutions and his call for conversion and his forgiveness of sins prior to the Paschal event represents a solid Christological foundation on which faith in Jesus Christ is built. The same applies of Jesus 2 ̆ 7 relationship towards God, whom he calls Abba, in a way that no one of the Jewish faithful would have called him. That expression, which translated means Dad, reveals an original and intimate (»family«) relationship between God the Father and Jesus Christ. It reveals Jesus 2 ̆ 7 divine sonship and his consciousness of that sonship. Also included are some of Jesus 2 ̆ 7 »I« sayings (»I tell you«, »I command you«, »I am [...] . «) which indirectly leads to the conclusion that divine authority is expressed by the one who uses it. In other words, it recalls the revelation of the names of Yahweh from the Old Testament (cf. Ex 3 : 14; Jn 8 : 12, 57 - 58). The conclusion is that even though Christ 2 ̆ 7 s Paschal event and his Resurrection are and remain the principle foundations of faith, which eventually reveal the person of Jesus Christ, the pre-Paschal events have a great importance for Christological reflection, for they also implicitly reveal Jesus 2 ̆ 7 <b>divine</b> <b>identity...</b>|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the identity of}} the Holy Spirit within the thought and experience of the Apostle Paul. Using the methodologies of Richard Bauckham (the framework of The Unique <b>Divine</b> <b>Identity)</b> and Larry Hurtado (Religious Experience), this thesis argues that the structure of Paul’s thought and his religious experience contributed to the emergence of a distinct identity of the Spirit within his Christian monotheism which developed beyond his Jewish roots. This conclusion is reached by demonstrating that within the Hebrew Scriptures, the literature of Second Temple Judaism, and Paul’s letters, the Spirit is understood to participate in those divine functions that characterise God’s own unique identity as ruler and creator of all things, and to participate in cultic devotion towards God. Furthermore, in these same three bodies of literature, the Spirit is presented as an experiential reality and was identified by its effects. How Paul’s thought and experience develops beyond and is distinguished from his Jewish context is observed in the subtle differentiation that Paul perceives between the Spirit and God – most clearly observed in the Spirit’s unique activity which is distinguished from the activity of God – and in the novel formation of the relation between the Spirit and Jesus Christ, a formation that distinguishes the Spirit from Christ. Consequently, the Spirit is viewed by Paul as both the Spirit of God and the Spirit of Christ. The contribution of this thesis is observed in a) the distinctive presentation of the Spirit within the framework of Bauckham’s ‘Unique Divine Identity’ in the literature of the Hebrew Scriptures, Second Temple Judaism, and in the letters of Paul which has not been achieved previously in any study on the Holy Spirit; b) the impact of Paul’s religious experience of the Spirit upon his perception of {{the identity of the}} Spirit, a point much neglected in Pauline studies, and c) a focused study that addresses the question of the identity of the Spirit through a fresh approach...|$|E
