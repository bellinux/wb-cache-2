Large dosage variations in the patient's medication (including a self-increased dosage from 10 mg/day to as much as 100 mg/day for at least 3 months) produced extreme behavioral changes, from missed appointments to physical altercations, and eventually admission to a psychiatric ward and later to a locked Alzheimer facility. During this time, neuropsychological testing showed a decline in the patient's previously superior IQ as well as deficits in memory, language, fluency, and visuospatial function, which given the patient's age was considered to be compatible with early dementia. When the steroid treatment ended after a year, the patent's confusion and disorganized appearance stopped immediately. Within several weeks, testing showed strong improvement in almost all cognitive functions.

40|$|Down {{syndrome}} (DS) is {{the most}} common genetic cause of intellectual disability (ID). Abilities relating to executive <b>function,</b> <b>memory</b> and language are particularly affected in DS, although there is a large variability across individuals. People with DS also show an increased risk of developing dementia. While assessment batteries have been developed for adults with DS to assess cognitive abilities, these batteries may not be suitable for those with more severe IDs, dementia, or visual / hearing difficulties. Here we report the development of an informant rated questionnaire, the Cognitive Scale for Down Syndrome (CS-DS), which focuses on everyday abilities relating to executive <b>function,</b> <b>memory</b> and language, and is suitable for assessing these abilities in all adults with DS regardless of cognitive ability. Complete questionnaires were collected about 128 individuals with DS. After final question selection we found high internal consistency scores across the total questionnaire and within the executive <b>function,</b> <b>memory</b> and language domains. CS-DS scores showed a wide range, with minimal floor and ceiling effects. We found high interrater (n = 55) and test retest (n = 36) intraclass correlations. CS-DS scores were significantly lower in those aged 41 + with significant cognitive decline compared to those without decline. Across all adults without cognitive decline, CS-DS scores correlated significantly to measures of general abilities. Exploratory factor analysis suggested five factors within the scale, relating to memory, self-regulation / inhibition, self-direction / initiation, communication, and focussing attention. The CS-DS therefore shows good interrater and test retest reliability, and appears to be a valid and suitable informant rating tool for assessing everyday cognitive abilities {{in a wide range of}} individuals with DS. Such a questionnaire may be a useful outcome measure for intervention studies to assess improvements to cognition, in addition to detecting dementia-related cognitive decline.

We measured both types of working memory using the Digit Span forward (DF) and backward (DB) tasks in a large sample of schizophrenia patients (n= 267) and normal comparison subjects (n= 82); in the patients, we also examined associations between performance on the Digit Span tasks and Letter-Number Sequencing (LNS), a putative executive <b>function</b> working <b>memory</b> test. Compared to healthy subjects, the schizophrenia patients showed impairment in the medium effect size range on both DF (d=- 0. 55) and 1313 (d=- 0. 68). 1313 scores predicted LNS performance, whereas DF scores did not. Worse negative symptoms were associated with worse performance on DF, DB and LNS.

40|$|AbstractAgeing is {{associated}} with declines in cognitive function and mobility. The extent to which this relationship encompasses the subdomains of cognition and mobility remains unclear, however. We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE databases for cross-sectional studies examining the association between objective mobility measures (gait, lower-extremity function, balance) and cognitive function (global, executive <b>function,</b> <b>memory,</b> processing speed) in healthy older adults. Of the 642 studies identified, 26 studies met the inclusion criteria, {{with a total of}} 26, 355 participants. For each feature of physical mobility, the relation to each aspect of cognition was reviewed. In the context of each association, we summarised the results to date and performed random-effects meta-analyses of published data. Reviewed findings suggest that individuals with better mobility perform better on assessments of global cognition, executive <b>function,</b> <b>memory</b> and processing speed. Not all measures of mobility were equally associated with cognitive function, however. Although there was a larger number of gait and lower-extremity function studies, and this may have driven findings, most studies examining balance and cognition measures reported no significant results. Meta-analyses on reported associations supported results by revealing significant, albeit small, effect sizes in favour of a positive association between performance on mobility measures and cognitive assessments. Future research should aim to establish the mechanisms driving this relationship, as this may identify predictors of age-related impairments...|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackgroundDaytime and {{nighttime}} {{sleep disturbances}} and cognitive impairment occur frequently in Parkinson's disease (PD), but {{little is known}} about the interdependence of these non-motor complications. Thus, we examined the relationships among excessive daytime sleepiness, nighttime sleep quality and cognitive impairment in PD, including severity and specific cognitive deficits. MethodsNinety-three PD patients underwent clinical and neuropsychological evaluations including the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Patients were classified as having normal cognition (PD-NC), mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI), or dementia (PDD) using recently proposed Movement Disorder Society PD-MCI and PDD criteria. Relationships between the sleep and cognitive measures and PD cognitive groups were examined. ResultsThe PD cohort included PD-NC (n =  28), PD-MCI (n =  40), and PDD (n =  25) patients. ESS scores, as a measure of daytime sleepiness, were significantly worse (p =  0. 005) in cognitively impaired PD patients, particularly PDD patients. ESS scores correlated significantly with Mini-Mental State Examination scores and also with cognitive domain scores for attention/working memory, executive <b>function,</b> <b>memory,</b> and visuospatial function. In contrast, PSQI scores, as a measure of nighttime sleep quality, neither differed among cognitive groups nor correlated with any cognitive measures. ConclusionsDaytime sleepiness in PD, but not nighttime sleep problems, is associated with cognitive impairment in PD, especially in the setting of dementia, and attention/working memory, executive <b>function,</b> <b>memory,</b> and visuospatial deficits. The presence of nighttime sleep problems is pervasive across the PD cognitive spectrum, from normal cognition to dementia, and is not independently associated with cognitive impairment or deficits in cognitive domains...|$|E
40|$|Background : Essential tremor (ET) and Parkinson’s disease (PD) {{are two of}} {{the most}} common {{movement}} disorders. Leaving aside their motor features, these two conditions share several non-motor features, including cognitive dysfunction and personality changes. However, there are few data comparing the cognitive and personality profiles of ET with PD. Here we compare the cognitive and personality profiles of the two diseases. Methods : Thirty-two consecutive non-demented ET patients (13 females and 19 males) (67. 7 ± 9. 8 years), 32 non-demented PD patients (13 females and 19 males) (67. 7 ± 9. 5 years), and 32 healthy matched controls (14 females and 18 males) (67. 9 ± 10. 1 years) underwent a neuropsychological test battery, including a global cognitive assessment and tests of attention, executive <b>function,</b> <b>memory,</b> language, and visuospatial function, as well as the Personality Assessment Inventory. Multivariable linear regression analyses were performed, adjusted for age, sex, years of education, medications that potentially affect cognitive function, number of medications, and the 17 -item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale Total Score. Results : Neuropsychological scores were similar in PD and ET patients, but patients with disease performed more poorly than control subjects in cognitive tasks such as attention, executive <b>function,</b> <b>memory,</b> and naming. Discussion : ET and PD exhibited similar deficits in specific aspects of neuropsychological functioning, particularly those thought to rely on the integrity of the prefrontal cortex, and this suggests involvement of frontocerebellar circuits.

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND AND AIMS: Social {{functioning}} is impaired {{in approximately}} two-thirds of stroke patients of vocational age, even {{several months after}} a first ever mild to moderate stroke. The known predictors of social functioning are initial stroke severity, anxiety and depression, and the Mini-Mental State Evaluation, suggesting that cognitive deficits contribute to post-stroke social dysfunctioning. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate whether cognitive domains correlated with social functioning and to determine the cognitive predictors of social dysfunctioning. METHODS: 74 patients were prospectively included 6 months after a first ever stroke. National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), modified Rankin scale, depression and anxiety were recorded. Social functioning was recorded using the Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS). An extensive neuropsychological test battery explored general cognitive <b>functioning,</b> episodic <b>memory,</b> instrumental <b>functions,</b> executive <b>functions</b> and working <b>memory.</b> Univariate comparisons assessed the relationships between the neuropsychological tests and scores on the WSAS. Predicting factors for WSAS were determined using ordinal logistic regression. RESULTS: 52 patients (70 %; 95 % confidence interval 58 % to 80 %) complained of significant perturbations in work and social functioning. In univariate comparisons, general cognitive <b>functioning,</b> <b>memory,</b> instrumental <b>functions,</b> executive <b>functions</b> and working <b>memory</b> significantly correlated with social <b>functioning.</b> Working <b>memory</b> was the most affected domain. With multivariate modelling, the NIHSS at admission, Hospital Anxiety Depression scale and Owen's Spatial Working Memory test were independent predictors of WSAS. CONCLUSIONS: All cognitive domains were associated with social <b>functioning,</b> working <b>memory</b> being the main cognitive determinant.
