5|$|All of {{the forces}} in the {{universe}} are based on four fundamental interactions. The strong and weak forces are nuclear forces that act only at very short distances, and {{are responsible for the}} interactions between subatomic particles, including nucleons and compound nuclei. The electromagnetic force acts between electric charges, and the gravitational force acts between masses. All other forces in nature derive from these four fundamental interactions. For example, friction is a manifestation of the electromagnetic force acting between the atoms of two surfaces, and the Pauli <b>exclusion</b> <b>principle,</b> which does not permit atoms to pass through each other. Similarly, the forces in springs, modeled by Hooke's law, are the result of electromagnetic forces and the <b>Exclusion</b> <b>Principle</b> acting together to return an object to its equilibrium position. Centrifugal forces are acceleration forces that arise simply from the acceleration of rotating frames of reference.|$|E
5|$|Such densities are {{possible}} because white dwarf material is not composed of atoms joined by chemical bonds, but rather {{consists of a}} plasma of unbound nuclei and electrons. There is therefore no obstacle to placing nuclei closer than normally allowed by electron orbitals limited by normal matter. Eddington wondered what would happen when this plasma cooled and the energy to keep the atoms ionized was no longer sufficient. This paradox was resolved by R. H. Fowler in 1926 by an application of the newly devised quantum mechanics. Since electrons obey the Pauli <b>exclusion</b> <b>principle,</b> no two electrons can occupy the same state, and they must obey Fermi–Dirac statistics, also introduced in 1926 to determine the statistical distribution of particles which satisfy the Pauli <b>exclusion</b> <b>principle.</b> At zero temperature, therefore, electrons can not all occupy the lowest-energy, or ground, state; {{some of them would}} have to occupy higher-energy states, forming a band of lowest-available energy states, the Fermi sea. This state of the electrons, called degenerate, meant that a white dwarf could cool to zero temperature and still possess high energy.|$|E

In 1900 Plank found the elementary length L * = 10 – 33 cm. This notion has been widely used in modern physics ever since. The properties of granular space are studied in this article {{on the assumption that}} a three-dimensional material cell with the size of Planck’s elementary length is the only material for the construction of the whole Universe.

5|$|Compression of a {{white dwarf}} will {{increase}} the number of electrons in a given volume. Applying the Pauli <b>exclusion</b> <b>principle,</b> this will increase the kinetic energy of the electrons, thereby increasing the pressure. This electron degeneracy pressure supports a white dwarf against gravitational collapse. The pressure depends only on density and not on temperature. Degenerate matter is relatively compressible; this means that the density of a high-mass white dwarf is much greater than that of a low-mass white dwarf and that the radius {{of a white}} dwarf decreases as its mass increases.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of antisymmetry, {{solutions}} of the wave equation for interacting electrons result in a zero probability that each pair will occupy the same location or state. This {{is responsible for the}} Pauli <b>exclusion</b> <b>principle,</b> which precludes any two electrons from occupying the same quantum state. This principle explains many of the properties of electrons. For example, it causes groups of bound electrons to occupy different orbitals in an atom, rather than all overlapping each other in the same orbit.|$|E

40|$|International audienceAccurate {{junction}} {{detection and}} characterization are of primary importance for {{several aspects of}} scene analysis, including depth recovery and motion analysis. In this work, we introduce a generic junction analysis scheme. The first asset of the proposed procedure is an automatic criterion {{for the detection of}} junctions, permitting to deal with textured parts in which no detection is expected. Second, the method yields a characterization of L-, Y- and X- junctions, including a precise computation of their type, localization and scale. Contrary to classical approaches, scale characterization does not rely on the linear scale-space, therefore enabling geometric accuracy. First, an a contrario approach is used to compute the meaningfulness of a junction. This approach relies on a statistical modeling of suitably normalized gray level gradients. Then, <b>exclusion</b> <b>principles</b> between junctions permit their precise characterization.

40|$|The {{maintenance}} of species diversity {{is a central}} focus in ecology. It is not rare to observe more species {{than the number of}} limiting resources, especially in plankton communities. However, such high species diversity is hard to achieve in theory under the competitive <b>exclusion</b> <b>principles,</b> known as the plankton paradox. Previous studies often focus on the coexistence of predefined species and ignore the fact that species can evolve. We model multi-resource competitions using evolutionary games, where the number of species fluctuates under extinction and the appearance of new species. The interspecific and intraspecific competitions are captured by a dynamical payoff matrix, which has a size of the number of species. The competition strength (payoff entries) is obtained from comparing the capability of species in consuming resources, which can change over time. This allows for the robust coexistence {{of a large number of}} species, providing a possible solution to the plankton paradox...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} new method for {{simulating}} electron dynamics in open quantum systems out of equilibrium, using a finite atomistic model. The proposed method {{is motivated by}} the intuitive and practical nature of the driven Liouville von-Neumann equation approach of Sánchez et al. [J. Chem. Phys., 124, 214708 (2006) ]. A key ingredient of our approach is a transformation of the Hamiltonian matrix from an atomistic to a state representation of the molecular junction. This allows us to uniquely define the bias voltage across the system while maintaining a proper thermal electronic distribution within the finite lead models. Furthermore, {{it allows us to}} investigate complex molecular junctions, including non-linear setups and multi-lead configurations. A heuristic derivation of our working equation leads to explicit expressions for the damping and driving terms, which serve as appropriate electron sources and sinks that effectively "open" the finite model system. Although the method does not forbid it, in practice we find neither violation of Pauli's <b>exclusion</b> <b>principles</b> nor deviation from density matrix positivity throughout our numerical simulations of various tight-binding model systems. We believe that the new approach offers a practical and physically sound route for performing atomistic time-dependent transport calculations in realistic molecular junctions.

5|$|An {{electron}} can {{be bound}} to the nucleus of an atom by the attractive Coulomb force. A system {{of one or more}} electrons bound to a nucleus is called an atom. If the number of electrons is different from the nucleus' electrical charge, such an atom is called an ion. The wave-like behavior of a bound electron is described by a function called an atomic orbital. Each orbital has its own set of quantum numbers such as energy, angular momentum and projection of angular momentum, and only a discrete set of these orbitals exist around the nucleus. According to the Pauli <b>exclusion</b> <b>principle</b> each orbital can be occupied by up to two electrons, which must differ in their spin quantum number.|$|E
5|$|The {{magnetic}} field produced by an atom—its magnetic moment—is determined by these {{various forms of}} angular momentum, just as a rotating charged object classically produces a {{magnetic field}}. However, the most dominant contribution comes from electron spin. Due {{to the nature of}} electrons to obey the Pauli <b>exclusion</b> <b>principle,</b> in which no two electrons may be found in the same quantum state, bound electrons pair up with each other, with one member of each pair in a spin up state and the other in the opposite, spin down state. Thus these spins cancel each other out, reducing the total magnetic dipole moment to zero in some atoms with even number of electrons.|$|E
5|$|Ions in ionic {{compounds}} {{are primarily}} {{held together by}} the electrostatic forces between the charge distribution of these bodies, {{and in particular the}} ionic bond resulting from the long-ranged Coulomb attraction between the net negative charge of the anions and net positive charge of the cations. There is also a small additional attractive force from van der Waals interactions which contributes only around 1–2% of the cohesive energy for small ions. When a pair of ions comes close enough for their outer electron shells (most simple ions have closed shells) to overlap, a short-ranged repulsive force occurs, due to the Pauli <b>exclusion</b> <b>principle.</b> The balance between these forces leads to a potential energy well with a minimum energy when the nuclei are separated by a specific equilibrium distance.|$|E

40|$|A central long {{standing}} prediction {{of the theory}} of fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states that it is a topological fluid whose elementary excitations are vortices with fractional charge and fractional statistics. Yet, the unambiguous experimental detection of this fundamental property, that the vortices have fractional statistics, has remained an open challenge. Here we propose a three-terminal "T-junction" as an experimental setup for the direct and independent measurement of the fractional charge and statistics of fractional quantum Hall quasiparticles via cross current noise measurements. We present a non-equilibrium calculation of the quantum noise in the T-junction setup for FQH Jain states. We show that the cross current correlation (noise) can be written in a simple form, a sum of two terms, which reflects the braiding properties of the quasiparticles: the statistics dependence captured in a factor of cosθ in one of two contributions. Through analyzing these two contributions for different parameter ranges that are experimentally relevant, we demonstrate that the noise at finite temperature reveals signatures of generalized <b>exclusion</b> <b>principles,</b> fractional exchange statistics and fractional charge. We also predict that the vortices of Laughlin states exhibit a "bunching" effect, while higher states in the Jain sequences exhibit an "anti-bunching" effect. Comment: 26 pages, 10 figures.

5|$|The {{chemical}} bond between atoms occurs {{as a result}} of electromagnetic interactions, as described by the laws of quantum mechanics. The strongest bonds are formed by the sharing or transfer of electrons between atoms, allowing the formation of molecules. Within a molecule, electrons move under the influence of several nuclei, and occupy molecular orbitals; much as they can occupy atomic orbitals in isolated atoms. A fundamental factor in these molecular structures is the existence of electron pairs. These are electrons with opposed spins, allowing them to occupy the same molecular orbital without violating the Pauli <b>exclusion</b> <b>principle</b> (much like in atoms). Different molecular orbitals have different spatial distribution of the electron density. For instance, in bonded pairs (i.e. in the pairs that actually bind atoms together) electrons can be found with the maximal probability in a relatively small volume between the nuclei. By contrast, in non-bonded pairs electrons are distributed in a large volume around nuclei.|$|E
5|$|Biogeographical {{patterns}} and range distributions are explained or predicted through {{knowledge of a}} species' traits and niche requirements. Species have functional traits that are uniquely adapted to the ecological niche. A trait is a measurable property, phenotype, or characteristic of an organism that may influence its survival. Genes {{play an important role}} in the interplay of development and environmental expression of traits. Resident species evolve traits that are fitted to the selection pressures of their local environment. This tends to afford them a competitive advantage and discourages similarly adapted species from having an overlapping geographic range. The competitive <b>exclusion</b> <b>principle</b> states that two species cannot coexist indefinitely by living off the same limiting resource; one will always out-compete the other. When similarly adapted species overlap geographically, closer inspection reveals subtle ecological differences in their habitat or dietary requirements. Some models and empirical studies, however, suggest that disturbances can stabilize the co-evolution and shared niche occupancy of similar species inhabiting species-rich communities. The habitat plus the niche is called the ecotope, which is defined as the full range of environmental and biological variables affecting an entire species.|$|E
5|$|In agriculture, fungi may {{be useful}} if they {{actively}} compete for nutrients and space with pathogenic microorganisms such as bacteria or other fungi via the competitive <b>exclusion</b> <b>principle,</b> or if they are parasites of these pathogens. For example, certain species {{may be used to}} eliminate or suppress the growth of harmful plant pathogens, such as insects, mites, weeds, nematodes, and other fungi that cause diseases of important crop plants. This has generated strong interest in practical applications that use these fungi in the biological control of these agricultural pests. Entomopathogenic fungi can be used as biopesticides, as they actively kill insects. Examples that have been used as biological insecticides are Beauveria bassiana, Metarhizium spp, Hirsutella spp, Paecilomyces (Isaria) spp, and Lecanicillium lecanii. Endophytic fungi of grasses of the genus Neotyphodium, such as N. coenophialum, produce alkaloids that are toxic to a range of invertebrate and vertebrate herbivores. These alkaloids protect grass plants from herbivory, but several endophyte alkaloids can poison grazing animals, such as cattle and sheep. Infecting cultivars of pasture or forage grasses with Neotyphodium endophytes is one approach being used in grass breeding programs; the fungal strains are selected for producing only alkaloids that increase resistance to herbivores such as insects, while being non-toxic to livestock.|$|E

40|$|The gilthead {{sea bream}} (Sparus aurata L.) {{is one of}} the most {{important}} marine fish species produced in southern European countries. Over the last two decades, microsatellites have become a powerful tool for DNA studies of fish populations, making it possible to establish existing genealogical relationships between individuals and to perform reliable estimates of genetic parameters. In the present study, a total of 7959 fish (494 breeders and 7465 fry) were genotyped using two rounds of multiplex reactions with four microsatellite markers each. Offspring were assigned based on the Mendelian <b>exclusion</b> <b>principles,</b> using FAP program. Genealogical information was successfully obtained for more than 83 % of the progeny. Heritability estimates were close to 0. 40 in all cases and for all considered traits. The lowest value was for the length at first age (350 ± 6 dph) and the highest for the length at the second age (500 ± 7 dph). The heritabilities for the first and the second weight were similar although somewhat higher for the second age, but not significant. The highest genetic correlations were found between weight and length at the same age and the lowest between weight and length at different ages. Based on the results of this study, it seems reasonable to expect that the implementation of a breeding program for improved growth in this population of gilthead sea bream will offer comparable performances to those achieved in other populations and species of great success in aquaculture around the world...|$|R
5|$|The factor {{limiting}} {{this process}} {{is the amount of}} energy that is released through fusion, which is dependent on the binding energy that holds together these atomic nuclei. Each additional step produces progressively heavier nuclei, which release progressively less energy when fusing. In addition, from carbon-burning onwards, energy loss via neutrino production becomes significant, leading to a higher rate of reaction than would otherwise take place. This continues until nickel-56 is produced, which decays radioactively into cobalt-56 and then iron-56 {{over the course of a}} few months. As iron and nickel have the highest binding energy per nucleon of all the elements, energy cannot be produced at the core by fusion, and a nickel-iron core grows. This core is under huge gravitational pressure. As there is no fusion to further raise the star's temperature to support it against collapse, it is supported only by degeneracy pressure of electrons. In this state, matter is so dense that further compaction would require electrons to occupy the same energy states. However, this is forbidden for identical fermion particles, such as the electron – a phenomenon called the Pauli <b>exclusion</b> <b>principle.</b>|$|E

Our approach consists in first constructing, {{in the context}} of angular momentum algebra, the wave functions of the two-hole system that fulfill Paulis <b>exclusions</b> <b>principle.</b> Second, we construct the acceptor-bound exciton states by adding the electron states in a similar manner that two-hole states are constructed. We discuss the optical selection rules for the acceptor-bound exciton recombination. Finally, we compare our theory with experimental data for CdS and GaN. In the specific case of CdS for which much experimental information is available, we demonstrate that, compared with cubic semiconductors, the sign of the short-range hole-exchange interaction is reversed and more than one order of magnitude larger. The whole set of data is interpreted {{in the context of}} a large value of the short-range hole-exchange interaction Xi(0) = 3. 4 +/- 0. 2 meV. This value dictates the splitting between the ground-state line I- 1 and the other transitions. The values we find for the electron-hole spin-exchange interaction and of the crystal-field splitting of the two-hole state are, respectively, - 0. 4 +/- 0. 1 and 0. 2 +/- 0. 1 meV. In the case of GaN, the experimental data for the acceptor-bound excitons in the case of Mg and Zn acceptors, show more than one bound-exciton line. We discuss a possible assignment of these states.
