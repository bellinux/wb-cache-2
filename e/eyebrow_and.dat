5|$|Young {{southern}} boobooks {{are usually}} paler than adults, {{and do not}} attain adult plumage properly until their third or fourth year. Juveniles (up to a year old) have whitish underparts and foreneck, a larger and more prominent pale <b>eyebrow</b> <b>and</b> larger whitish spots on their upperparts. The tips of their feathers are white and fluffy, remnants of the nestlings' down. These are worn away over time, persisting longest on the head. The feathers of the head, neck and underparts are fluffier overall. Immatures in their second and third year have plumage more like adults, though their crowns are paler and more heavily streaked.|$|E
5|$|The {{goldcrest}} {{is usually}} easily distinguished from other small birds in its range, but poor views could possibly lead to confusion {{with the common}} firecrest or yellow-browed warbler. The adult common firecrest has a distinguishing face pattern showing a bright white supercilium (<b>eyebrow)</b> <b>and</b> black eye-stripe, and the juvenile usually shows enough of this face pattern to be readily distinguished from the plain-faced goldcrest. The yellow-browed warbler has a yellowish supercilium and pale crown stripe, so also shows a different head pattern. The ruby-crowned kinglet, an American Regulus species and a potential vagrant in Europe, could {{be more difficult to}} distinguish. It has a plain face like its Old World cousin, but the male has a red crest without any yellow or a black border. Female and juvenile ruby-crowned kinglets lack the ruby-red crown patch, but compared with the similarly crestless juvenile goldcrest, the American bird is larger in size, has an obvious whitish eyering, and yellowish wing bars.|$|E
25|$|On 6 April 2012, Darchinyan lost to WBC bantamweight {{champion}} Shinsuke Yamanaka in Yamanaka's {{home country}} of Japan. The fight {{was not without}} controversy. Darchinyan was slightly ahead on one card {{and the other two}} were even after the fourth round. In the fourth, a clash of heads opened a bloody cut on Darchinyan's <b>eyebrow</b> <b>and</b> nose. Yamanaka hit Darchinyan with an elbow on the same eyebrow in round five, severing the cut. The referee was not in line of sight to see this. Blood was pouring more rapidly out of Darchinyan's eyebrow afterward and the ringside doctor examined it. A fight would usually be stopped and given a technical decision at this point, but the cut was controversially ruled to have been caused by a punch by the ringside doctor, who examined the cut in the sixth round, when Darchinyan was ahead on points. Darchinyan, fighting with blood in his eyes {{for the rest of the}} fight, lost via decision. The headbutt and elbow thrown by Yamanaka had raised much controversy, as Darchinyan was winning the fight beforehand and his performance seemed to slow down as consequence. The result is currently being protested by Team Darchinyan with photographic proof Yamanaka used an illegal headbutt and elbow.|$|E

25|$|In 2006, a 51-year-old police constable {{attracted}} a 16-year-old girl {{to his house}} by showing her his badge, where he got her drunk and raped her twice. The constable was fired and sentenced to a two-year suspended sentence. In 2007, an Iranian-born immigrant, Rasoul Pourak, was beaten in a cell at Pasila Police Station, Helsinki. The ill-treatment caused Pourak bruises all over his body, an open wound over his <b>eyebrow,</b> <b>and</b> a fractured skull. In addition, facial bones were broken and the victim was left permanently damaged. One guard participating in the assault was sentenced to an 80-day suspended prison sentence. In 2010, two police officers assaulted {{a man in a}} wheelchair in connection with an arrest. The police twisted the man's hands and pushed him backward causing him to break a femur. In 2013, two policemen were sentenced to 35 day fines for assault and breach of duty in connection with stamping on a man's head onto the asphalt thrice. According to the police, the man of Romani descent resisted, yet according to eyewitnesses, the man did not resist. The event was captured in surveillance video, which was stored but accidentally destroyed according to a third officer present. However the third officer, having seen the surveillance footage, testified that the video didn't show any resistance {{on the part of the}} Romani, but also that the assault happened out of view from the camera.|$|E
500|$|Lesions of {{the facial}} nerve (VII) may {{manifest}} as facial palsy. This is where a person is unable to move the muscles on one or both sides of their face. A very common and generally temporary facial palsy is known as Bell's palsy. [...] Bell's Palsy is the result of an idiopathic (unknown), unilateral lower motor neuron lesion {{of the facial}} nerve and is characterized by an inability to move the ipsilateral muscles of facial expression, including elevation of the <b>eyebrow</b> <b>and</b> furrowing of the forehead. [...] Patients with Bell's palsy often have a drooping mouth on the affected side and often have trouble chewing because the buccinator muscle is affected.|$|E
500|$|Ken Tucker {{summarized}} Hartman's comedic style: [...] "He could momentarily fool audiences {{into thinking}} he was the straight man, but then he'd cock an <b>eyebrow</b> <b>and</b> give his voice an ironic lilt that delivered a punchline like a fast slider—you barely saw it coming until you started laughing." [...] Hartman claimed that he borrowed his style from actor Bill Murray: [...] "He's been a great influence on me – when he did that smarmy thing in Ghostbusters, then {{the same sort of}} thing in Groundhog Day. I tried to imitate it. I couldn't. I wasn't good enough. But I discovered an element of something else, so in a sick kind of way I made myself a career by doing a bad imitation of another comic." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{species is}} {{strongly}} sexually dimorphic. Adult males {{are black and}} white, with a black head, neck, wings and upperparts, and a black stripe running down from {{the centre of the}} chest to the abdomen, and with a white belly, flanks and under-tail coverts. The female’s crown, ear coverts and upper parts are buff brown, scalloped paler, with a pale <b>eyebrow,</b> <b>and</b> the chest is speckled grey-brown grading into a dull white belly. [...] In both male and female the iris is dark brown and the bill and legs blackish brown. [...] Immature birds are similar to the adult female, however the upper breast and throat tend to be more uniform grey-brown and the base of the bill is paler. Immature birds are not distinguishable from adults at a distance.|$|E
500|$|Filming {{began in}} June 1990 and took eight weeks (a third {{less time than}} {{required}} by Miller's Crossing), and the estimated final budget for the movie was US$9 million. The Coens worked well with Deakins, and they easily translated their ideas for each scene onto film. [...] "There was only one moment we surprised him," [...] Joel Coen recalled later. An extended scene called for a tracking {{shot out of the}} bedroom and into a sink drain [...] "plug hole" [...] in the adjacent bathroom as a symbol of sexual intercourse. [...] "The shot {{was a lot of fun}} and we had a great time working out how to do it," [...] Joel said. [...] "After that, every time we asked Roger to do something difficult, he would raise an <b>eyebrow</b> <b>and</b> say, 'Don't be having me track down any plug-holes now.'" ...|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} prevent {{possible}} injuries and be in peak condition for the film, Willis worked out almost daily for several months prior to filming. Willis was injured on January 24, 2007 during a fight scene, when he was kicked above his right eye by a stunt double for actress Maggie Q who was wearing stiletto heels. Willis described the event as [...] "no big deal" [...] but when Len Wiseman inspected his injury, {{he noticed that the}} situation was much more serious than previously thought—in the DVD commentary, Wiseman indicates in inspecting the wound that he could see bone. Willis was hospitalized and received seven stitches which ran through his right <b>eyebrow</b> <b>and</b> down into the corner of his eye. Due to the film's non-linear production schedule, these stitches can accidentally be seen in the scene where McClane first delivers Farrell to Bowman.|$|E

500|$|The {{beautiful}} nuthatch (Sitta formosa, {{sometimes called}} Callisitta formosa) is a bird {{species in the}} Sittidae family, collectively known as nuthatches. It is a large nuthatch, measuring [...] in length, that is not sexually dimorphic. Its coloration and markings are dramatic, the upper parts being black and azure, streaked with white and pale blue {{on the head and}} lined with the same colors on the wing feathers. The underparts are orange, and the <b>eyebrow</b> <b>and</b> throat are ochre. An irregular, dark eyestripe highlights its eye. S. formosas ecology is not fully described, but it is known to feed on small insects and larvae found on the trunks and epiphyte-covered branches of trees in its range. Reproduction takes place from April to May; the nest is placed in the hole of an oak, rhododendron, or other large tree. The nest is made of plant material and fur in which the bird typically lays four to six eggs.|$|E
500|$|Described by Erik Matthysen in his 1998 {{treatise}} The Nuthatches as a {{bird that}} [...] "deserves its name", the beautiful nuthatch has highly distinctive plumage. Its upperparts are black and azure, and it is orange on the underparts. The crown and upper mantle are black, streaked with pale blue and white. The scapulars, back and rump are an azure blue. The greater and medium coverts are black, finely edged with white, forming two narrow wing bars; the flight feathers are black and more or less lined with pale blue. The <b>eyebrow</b> <b>and</b> throat are white and buff and the eye is highlighted by an irregular, dark eyestripe. Under the wing, the white base of the primary coverts contrasts sharply with gray undertail-coverts, a distinguishing trait when viewing the bird in flight. The iris is reddish-brown or dark brown and the bill is black but for a whitish tinge {{at the base of}} the lower mandible. The lower parts are generally orange-cinnamon. The legs and feet are yellowish-brown, olive-brown or greenish-brown.|$|E
500|$|On August 21, 2015, Stone and his {{childhood}} friends Alek Skarlatos and Anthony Sadler, were traveling together during a sightseeing vacation in Europe when they boarded Thalys train 9364 from Amsterdam bound to Paris via Brussel. Stone was serving at the United States Air Force 65th Air Base Group. A 25-year-old Moroccan man, {{believed to be}} Ayoub El-Khazzani, was in train car No. 12, armed with an AKM assault rifle and equipped with 270 rounds of ammunition. Several people {{tried to stop the}} gunman, but failed to do so. Sadler reported that they heard a gunshot and breaking glass behind them, seeing an employee sprint down the aisle followed by a man with an automatic rifle. Stone woke up from the breaking glass, with Skarlatos telling Stone to [...] "go". Stone tackled the armed suspect, and was stabbed in the neck and <b>eyebrow</b> <b>and</b> almost lost his thumb. [...] Skarlatos took action and seized the assailant's rifle, beating him in the head with the muzzle of it until he was unconscious. Skarlatos stated that [...] "I was thinking about survival," [...] and [...] "t was to survive and for everybody else on the train to make it." [...] Stone was transferred to the central hospital in Lille, France and went under treatment in Germany, returning home September 3, 2015.|$|E

500|$|The {{southern}} boobook {{has generally}} dark brown head and upperparts, with white markings on the scapulars and {{spots on the}} wings. Its head lacks tufts common in other owls, and has a paler facial disk, with a white supercilium (<b>eyebrow)</b> <b>and</b> dark brown ear coverts and cheeks. The brown feathers of the upper forehead, above the supercilium, and sides of the neck have yellow-brown highlights. The feathers of the lores, chin and throat are white with black shafts. The feathers of the underparts are mostly brown with white spots and dark blue-grey bases. The upper tail is dark brown with lighter brown bars and [...] a grey fringe at the end, while the undertail is a lighter grey-brown. The female {{tends to be more}} prominently streaked than the male overall, though this is inconsistent and there is wide variation. The eyes have been described as grey-green, green-yellow, or even light hazel. The bill is black with a pale blue-grey base and cere. The feet are greyish to pinkish brown with dark grey to blackish claws. The underparts are pale, ranging from buff to cream, and are streaked with brown. The overall colour is variable and does not appear to correspond to subspecies or region. In northern and central Australia, Mayr found that the colour of the plumage appears to correlate with the rainfall or humidity, paler birds being found in three disjunct areas, each around [...] away from the other two: the western Kimberley and Pilbara, Sedan on the Cloncurry River, and around Ooldea, with darker birds found on Cape York and Melville Island.|$|E

2500|$|Having already {{recorded}} two reggae-oriented albums {{under the}} production of Compass Point All Stars, Jones went to Nassau, Bahamas in 1982 and recorded Living My Life; the album resulted in Jones' final contribution to the Compass Point trilogy, with only one cover, Melvin Van Peebles's [...] "The Apple Stretching". The rest were original songs; [...] "Nipple to the Bottle" [...] was co-written with Sly Dunbar, and, apart from [...] "My Jamaican Guy", the other tracks were collaborations with Barry Reynolds. Despite receiving a limited single release, the title track was left off the album. Further session outtakes included [...] "Man Around the House" [...] (Jones, Reynolds) and a cover of [...] "Ring of Fire", written by June Carter Cash and Merle Kilgore and popularized by Johnny Cash, {{both of which were}} included on the 1998 compilation [...] The album's cover art resulted from another Jones/Goude collaboration; the artwork has been described as being as famous as the music on the record. It features Jones' disembodied head cut out from a photograph and pasted onto a white background. Jones' head is sharpened, giving her head and face an angular shape.

2500|$|Breaking the {{symmetry}} of the helmet are subtle {{differences in the}} two eyebrows, and in the methods employed to fashion the cloisonné garnets. The dexter and sinister eyebrows, though at first glance identical, may have been [...] "manufactured in different ways while being intended to look essentially the same." [...] The dexter brow is approximately 5 millimeters shorter than the sinister, and contained 43 rather than 46 inlaid silver wires {{and one or two}} fewer garnets. Gilding on the dexter eyebrow was [...] "reddish in colour" [...] against the [...] "yellowish" [...] hue of the sinister, while the latter contains both trace amounts of mercury and a tin corrosion product which are absent from its counterpart. Moreover, while the individual bronze cells into which the garnets are set, both on the dexter brow and on three of the four remaining dragon eyes, are underlain by small pieces of [...] "hatched gold foil," [...] those on the sinister side, and the sinister eye of the upper dragon head, have no such backing. The gold backing served to reflect light back through the garnets, increasing their lustre and deepening their colour. Where this backing was missing on the sinister <b>eyebrow</b> <b>and</b> one dragon eye, the luminosity of the garnets would be [...] "substantially dimmed" [...] by direct placement against the bronze.|$|E
2500|$|There [...] are {{numerous}} {{other examples of}} Korean sculpture or images influenced by [...] Korean style in Japan. [...] The Kanshoin pensive bodhisattva (...)

[...] The strong constriction of the upper body, the [...] incised line chiseled into the <b>eyebrow,</b> <b>and</b> tassel {{on the front of}} the [...] crown. [...] Scholars currently debate whether Hōryū-ji Dedicated treasure no. 156 (...) [...] is Korean in origin or made in Japan, influenced by Korean styles. [...] An [...] inscription on its base can be plausibly attributed to either a 606 or [...] 666 date. [...] An early date would suggest a Korean origin because of the [...] still developing nature of Japanese sculpture at the time. [...] By 666, [...] plenty of indigenous Japanese sculpture can be found. [...] Some Korean [...] traits include the emaciated body, three-tiered crown and head knot, and the [...] extreme stylization of the drapery over the base. [...] Either way, the image [...] is an important example of Korean traits in early Japanese art. [...] The inscription mentions Gaya, a [...] group of statelets that were annexed by Paekche and Silla in the 6th century, which may suggest that the image preserves the style prevalent [...] in the Nakdong River valley.|$|E
