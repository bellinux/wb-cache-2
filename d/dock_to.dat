5|$|The site {{chosen for}} the <b>dock</b> <b>to</b> be built on was an area of land bordered by Salthouse <b>Dock</b> <b>to</b> the east, the {{entrance}} channel to Canning <b>Dock</b> <b>to</b> the north and by Duke's <b>Dock</b> <b>to</b> the south. The land earmarked for the site had to be cleared, with 59 tenants being evicted and numerous premises demolished including a pub, several houses and the Dock Trustee's Dockyard. Upon the clearance of this land both the Salthouse and Canning dock's were drained to allow entrance passages into the Albert <b>Dock</b> <b>to</b> be constructed, whilst hundreds of 'Navvies' were employed to dig out the dock basin and construct the new river wall. The dock basin was completed by February 1845, allowing the first ships to enter the Albert Dock, although with the warehouses still under construction this was merely to allow these boats to 'lay-up'.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the nature}} of the strata under the dock there was no need to puddle the bottom of the <b>dock</b> <b>to</b> prevent water from seeping out and {{damaging}} the surrounding lands.|$|E
5|$|After {{the two new}} dreadnoughts {{were awarded}} to Fore River, Moreno was {{subcontracted}} out to the New York Shipbuilding Corporation of Camden, New Jersey as {{called for in the}} final contract. Morenos keel was laid on 9 July 1910, and construction was overseen by the Argentine Naval Commission. After the completion of the hull, it was launched on 23 September 1911. Isabel Betbeder, wife to the chief of the Argentine Naval Commission, sponsored Moreno. The ship was then moored to a <b>dock</b> <b>to</b> commence fitting-out, which was finished on 15 February 1915. It was commissioned into the Argentine Navy nine days later.|$|E

5|$|Any rider {{may take}} {{unlimited}} trips {{of up to}} 30 minutes, measured from when the bike is withdrawn from a <b>dock</b> <b>to</b> when it is returned. (If a destination station is full, riders can use the kiosk to get 15 more free minutes to return the bike to another location.) Longer trips incur fees for each additional half-hour {{on a scale that}} rises from $1.50 to $8.00. These prices are designed to encourage short trips from place to place instead of longer leisure rides.|$|E
5|$|Cardiff Airport is {{the only}} airport in Wales which offers {{international}} scheduled flights. Destinations available include {{other parts of the}} United Kingdom, Ireland and parts of continental Europe. The airport is also used for charter flights on a seasonal basis. In 2015, around 1.2 million passengers used the airport. Several ferry services operate between Welsh ports and Ireland: Holyhead to Dublin; Fishguard to Rosslare; Pembroke <b>Dock</b> <b>to</b> Rosslare; and Swansea to Cork.|$|E
5|$|On 24 February 1990, tugboats moved Texas from dry <b>dock</b> <b>to</b> {{a repair}} {{facility}} on Green's Bayou for further repairs. It {{was here that}} the wood deck was installed and four of the ten mounts of quad 40mm guns were installed. On 26 July, the ship was returned to her berth at San Jacinto where the final six mounts of 40mm guns were installed. Repairs complete, the ship officially reopened to the public on 8 September 1990. Since returning to her slip at San Jacinto, members of the ship's staff and volunteers have worked to restore the interior spaces.|$|E

5|$|The TVR {{line would}} {{dominate}} the transportation of coal throughout the Rhondda's industrial history, and its monopoly {{was a point}} of contention, as with no rivals the colliery owners could not negotiate for haulage rates. Several {{attempts were made to}} break the monopoly including the opening of the Rhondda and Swansea Bay Railway, between 1885 and 1895, which linked Blaenrhondda {{at the head of the}} Rhondda Fawr to the Prince of Wales <b>Dock.</b> <b>To</b> achieve this rail link the Rhondda Tunnel was constructed through Mynydd Blaengwynfy to Blaengwynfi; at the time the longest railway tunnel in Wales.|$|E
5|$|After the war, {{construction}} of the Bristol Portway along the Avon Gorge necessitated {{the closure of the}} line from Sneyd Park Junction to Hotwells, with trains along it ceasing on 3 July 1922. By this point there were nine trains per day from Hotwells, and eight return. To compensate for the loss of service, the Great Western provided an additional four trains daily from Avonmouth <b>Dock</b> <b>to</b> Bristol and six return. In 1923, grouping resulted in the Midland Railway being absorbed into the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS), and the line continued in a joint arrangement between the Great Western and the LMS. The engine shed was closed in 1924.|$|E
5|$|In December 1974, the Council bought Bridgwater Dock from British Railways. The {{concrete}} wall across the barge lock was removed, {{but there was}} no intention to restore the ship lock. By 1980, the Council had invested over £50,000 in the restoration, which included Kings and Standards locks, and the bottom gates of Newtown Lock. Some bridges had been raised, but only to , which allowed canoeing, but prevented bigger boats from using the waterway. Work on the deep cutting between West Street and Albert Street started in September 1978, jointly funded by the County Council and Sedgemoor District Council, using direct labour, while a Manpower Services Commission scheme to dredge the canal from the <b>dock</b> <b>to</b> the cutting and to widen the towpath was funded by the District Council in 1981.|$|E

5|$|The next day, {{a general}} store {{delivery}} boy named Jimmy (Jack Parker) listens to a radio {{report about the}} Creeper's murders. The cantankerous store owner Mr. Haskins (Oscar O'Shea) arrives with a handwritten letter slipped under the door, requesting groceries be delivered to a nearby dock. Jimmy brings the groceries to the dock and leaves them at a door, where the Creeper takes them into his hideout. But, when Jimmy tries to spy on him through a window, the Creeper sneaks up on Jimmy and kills him. Meanwhile, at the police station, Captain M.J. Donelly (Donald MacBride) and Lieutenant Gates (Peter Whitney) receive complaints from the mayor's office about their failure to arrest the Creeper, but they deflect the blame. The two officers then get a call about the missing delivery boy and head to the <b>dock</b> <b>to</b> investigate.|$|E
5|$|The repairs were {{abandoned}} in March 1945 {{for lack of}} materials and the ship was moved from the <b>dock</b> <b>to</b> Ebisu Bay, Sasebo on 1 April. Efforts to camouflage the ship began on 23 April and she was reclassified as a guard ship on 20 June. Junyōs armament was ordered removed on 5 August and the ship was surrendered to the Allies on 2 September. An American technical team evaluated the ship's condition on 8 October and deemed her a constructive total loss. Junyō was stricken from the Navy List on 30 November and scrapped between 1 June 1946 and 1 August 1947 by the Sasebo Ship Company.|$|E
5|$|When sailing {{the western}} side of Spitzbergen, a blade of the {{propeller}} of the Island was damaged in a collision with an ice floe. When the engine was run, severe vibration was felt and this forced Worsley to continue northwards under sail, searching for Gillis Land until the ship reached the pack ice. While doing so, soundings were taken which confirmed the presence of a submarine plain between Spitzbergen and the island group of Franz Josef Land. Turning south and sailing along the northern coast of Spitzbergen, a previously uncharted harbour was found, which Algarsson named after Worsley. The ship then sailed north, still seeking Gillis Land, but became trapped in the ice. Worsley took the opportunity to create an ice <b>dock</b> <b>to</b> facilitate repairs to the rudder, which had become damaged. After two weeks beset in the ice, he used the engine to break free but the last blade of the propeller was lost in the process.|$|E

5|$|The first manned mission flown from an {{independent}} Kazakhstan was Soyuz TM-14, launched on 17 March 1992, which carried the EO-11 crew to Mir, docking on 19 March before {{the departure of}} Soyuz TM-13. On 17 June, Russian President Boris Yeltsin and US President George H. W. Bush announced what would later become the Shuttle-Mir programme, a cooperative venture which proved useful to the cash-strapped Roskosmos (and led to the eventual completion and launch of Spektr and Priroda). EO-12 followed in July, alongside a brief visit by French astronaut Michel Tognini. The following crew, EO-13, began preparations for the Shuttle-Mir programme by flying to the station in a modified spacecraft, Soyuz TM-16 (launched on 26 January 1993), which was equipped with an APAS-89 docking system rather than the usual probe-and-drogue, enabling it to <b>dock</b> <b>to</b> Kristall and test the port which would later be used by US space shuttles. The spacecraft also enabled controllers to obtain data on the dynamics of docking a spacecraft to a space station off the station's longitudinal axis, in addition to data on the structural integrity of this configuration via a test called Rezonans conducted on 28 January. Soyuz TM-15, meanwhile, departed with the EO-12 crew on 1 February.|$|E
5|$|The orbital {{assembly}} of Mir began on February 19, 1986 with {{the launch of}} the Proton-K rocket. Four of the six modules which were later added (Kvant-2 in 1989, Kristall in 1990, Spektr in 1995 and Priroda in 1996) followed the same sequence {{to be added to the}} main Mir complex. Firstly, the module would be launched independently on its own Proton-K and chase the station automatically. It would then <b>dock</b> <b>to</b> the forward docking port on the core module's docking node, then extend its Lyappa arm to mate with a fixture on the node's exterior. The arm would then lift the module away from the forward docking port and rotate it on to the radial port where it was to mate, before lowering it to dock. The node was equipped with only two Konus drogues, which were required for dockings. This meant that, prior to the arrival of each new module, the node would have to be depressurised to allow spacewalking cosmonauts to manually relocate the drogue to the next port to be occupied.|$|E
5|$|In 1737, Salsette was {{captured}} from the Portuguese by Maratha Baji Rao I and {{the province of}} Bassein was ceded in 1739. The Maratha victory forced the British to push settlements within the fort walls of the city. Under new building rules set up in 1748, many houses were demolished and the population was redistributed, partially on newly reclaimed land. Lovji Nusserwanjee Wadia, {{a member of the}} Wadia family of shipwrights and naval architects from Surat, built the Bombay Dock in 1750, which was the first dry <b>dock</b> <b>to</b> be commissioned in Asia. By the middle of the eighteenth century, Bombay began to grow into a major trading town and soon Bhandaris from Chaul in Maharashtra, Vanjaris from the Western Ghat mountain ranges of Maharashtra, Africans from Madagascar, Bhatias from Rajasthan, Vaishya Vanis, Goud Saraswat Brahmins, Daivajnas from konkan, ironsmiths and weavers from Gujarat migrated to the islands. In 1769, Fort George was built {{on the site of the}} Dongri Fort and in 1770, the Mazagaon docks were built. The British occupied Salsette, Elephanta, Hog Island, and Karanja on 28 December 1774. Salsette, Elephanta, Hog Island, and Karanja were formally ceded to the British East India Company by the Treaty of Salbai signed in 1782, while Bassein and its dependencies were restored to Raghunathrao of the Maratha Empire. Although Salsette was under the British, but the introduction of contraband goods from Salsette to other parts of Bombay was prevented. The goods were subjected to Maratha regulations with respect to taxes and a 30% toll was levied on all goods into the city from Salsette.|$|E

25|$|UHF {{radio is}} used by astronauts and cosmonauts {{conducting}} EVAs. UHF {{is used by}} other spacecraft that <b>dock</b> <b>to</b> or undock from the station, such as Soyuz, Progress, HTV, ATV and the Space Shuttle (except the shuttle also makes use of the S band and Ku band systems via TDRSS), to receive commands from Mission Control and ISS crewmembers. Automated spacecraft are fitted with their own communications equipment; the ATV uses a laser attached to the spacecraft and equipment attached to Zvezda, known as the Proximity Communications Equipment, to accurately <b>dock</b> <b>to</b> the station.|$|E
25|$|In 1972 rotundas {{were added}} to the end of each <b>dock</b> <b>to</b> allow more gates. In the later 1970s growth in {{regional}} air travel created a need for more gates. In 1980 the South East Dock was opened. Even with these expansions, the terminal was too small.|$|E
