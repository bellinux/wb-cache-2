5000|$|In October 2007, Eric Traut, a {{developer}} at Microsoft, demonstrated a self-contained MinWin system, {{made up of}} about 100 files, on which a basic HTTP server was running. Traut noted that MinWin takes up about 25 MB on disk and has a working set (memory usage) of 40 MB. It lacked a graphical user interface and is interfaced using a <b>full-screen</b> <b>command</b> line interface. Traut explained during the demo that MinWin would not be offered as a stand-alone product, but would instead {{be used as the}} basis for future operating system releases such as Windows 7.|$|E

Although superseded in MS-DOS 5.0 and later by the <b>full-screen</b> edit <b>command,</b> and by Notepad in Microsoft Windows, {{it continues to be}} included in the 32-bit versions of current Microsoft operating systems.|$|R

Since the memory is very limited on these early home computers, the compiler can compile to/from disk and memory. The software package for C64 includes a <b>full-screen</b> editor and <b>command</b> shell.|$|R
