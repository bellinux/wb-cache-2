5|$|Freemasonry {{and women}} have a complex {{relationship}}, which can be readily divided into many phases with no <b>demonstrable</b> relationship to each other until the 20th century. A few women were involved in Freemasonry before the 18th century; however the first printed constitutions of the Premier Grand Lodge of England appeared to bar them from the Craft forever.|$|E
5|$|In 1889, Huxley wrote:Therefore, {{although}} it be, as I believe, <b>demonstrable</b> {{that we have}} no real knowledge of the authorship, or of the date of composition of the Gospels, as they have come down to us, and that nothing better than more or less probable guesses can be arrived at on that subject.|$|E
5|$|It is {{difficult}} for scholars {{to piece together the}} exact form of the entertainments, but clues have been gleaned from the written accounts, scripts, artworks, and tapestries that derived from these famous occasions. Though such sources must be treated with caution, since they contain <b>demonstrable</b> inaccuracies and contradictions, they provide evidence of the richness and scale of Catherine de' Medici's court festivals.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, a {{biochemical}} polymorphism {{study was}} conducted in four sample areas of the species. Electrophoretically <b>demonstrable</b> variation was found in one or more populations at 15 of 39 (38%) of the loci examined, and two and sometimes three alleles per locus were detected. At the least, the findings give an indication of the kind of genetic variation that may be found between populations within a species. The amount of variation was similar to findings in examinations of Peromyscus polionotus, Sigmodon, and Dipodomys.|$|E
5|$|This was {{a blow to}} the {{short-range}} committee, who {{had made}} good progress on the specification. Despite being technically superior, FACT had not been created with portability in mind or through manufacturer and user consensus. It also lacked a <b>demonstrable</b> implementation, allowing supporters of a FLOW-MATIC-based COBOL to overturn the resolution. RCA representative Howard Bromberg also blocked FACT, so that RCA's work on a COBOL implementation would not go to waste.|$|E
5|$|Hibakusha {{and their}} {{children}} were (and still are) victims of severe discrimination in Japan due to public ignorance {{about the consequences of}} radiation sickness, with much of the public believing it to be hereditary or even contagious. This is despite the fact that no statistically <b>demonstrable</b> increase of birth defects or congenital malformations was found among the later conceived children born to survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. A study of the long-term psychological effects of the bombings on the survivors found that even 17–20 years after the bombings had occurred survivors showed a higher prevalence of anxiety and somatization symptoms.|$|E
5|$|The reigns of Djedkare Isesi and of Unas were a time {{of changes}} in Ancient Egyptian {{religion}} and in the ideology of kingship, changes that are first <b>demonstrable</b> under Unas. A statistical analysis of clay seal fragments bearing Horus names of pharaohs of the Fifth Dynasty points to a marked decline of {{the cult of the}} king during Unas' time on the throne. This continued under Unas' successor Teti, for whom we know only two seals bearing his Horus name. This trend reflects the lessening of the king's power in conjunction with the growth of the administration and priesthood.|$|E
5|$|Around 1550 the {{mounting}} conflict {{seems to have}} reached a turning point with the Zafikasimambo noble family rising to power in Matitana following the family leader's marriage to a local woman. Historical texts tie the lineage of the family's leader, Zafikazimambobe, to Anteony noble Ramarohala, who had settled there at least three generations before. Other historical sources confirm however that the genealogy described in these texts is not factual, and that the Zafikazimambo family had only newly arrived and so had no <b>demonstrable</b> descent from local nobles. Rather, these texts suggest that it took over three generations for the Antemoro to successfully integrate into the society through intermarriage and other means, and also reflect an awareness among the Antemoro {{of the importance of}} local caste and lineage traditions and their need to find a place within them. Upon rising to power, the Zafikasimambo clan absorbed the ritual privileges of the former Zafiraminia clan and had established themselves as the premier ombiasy (wise men) who practiced astrology and served as scribes; they regularly left the Antemoro homeland to provide their services where needed. These ombiasy also often trained the spiritual leaders of other communities, further reinforcing the preeminence of the Matitana ombiasy as masters of arcane knowledge and those outside their clan who sought to learn or dispense it. The Zafikasimambo used their right to conduct sombily (ritual sacrifice) to shape and increasingly control political and economic activities in the area. To end the conflict with the Zafiraminia, they executed as many males of the group as possible and relegated the women and children to restricted areas. In this way they established the first strong Antemoro kingdom. They are rare among Malagasy clans as newcomers who successfully established their own kingdom within a short time after landing on the island.|$|E
25|$|In Christian faith, {{theologians and}} {{philosophers}} {{make a distinction}} between: (a) preambles of faith and (b) articles of faith. The preambles include alleged truths contained in revelation which are nevertheless <b>demonstrable</b> by reason, e.g., the immortality of the soul, the existence of God. The articles of faith, on the other hand, contain truths that cannot be proven or reached by reason alone and presuppose the truths of the preambles, e.g., the Holy Trinity, is not <b>demonstrable</b> and presupposes the existence of God.|$|E

25|$|However, the First Cause {{does not}} {{necessarily}} have to be temporally the first. Thus, {{the question of whether}} or not the universe can be imagined as eternal was fiercely debated in the Middle Ages. The University of Paris's condemnation of 1270 denounced the belief that the world is eternal. Aquinas' intellectual rival, Bonaventure, held that the temporality of the universe is <b>demonstrable</b> by reason. Aquinas' position was that the temporality of the world is an article of faith, and not <b>demonstrable</b> by reason; though one could reasonably conclude either that the universe is temporal or eternal.|$|E

25|$|Visual field defects {{had been}} {{reported}} as early as 1997 by Tom Eke and others, in the UK. Some authors, including Comaish et al. believe that visual field loss and electrophysiological changes may be <b>demonstrable</b> in up to 50% of Vigabatrin users.|$|E
25|$|For the {{survivors}} of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, who are known as the Hibakusha, no statistically <b>demonstrable</b> increase of birth defects/congenital malformations was found among their later conceived children, or found in the later conceived children of cancer survivors who had previously received radiotherapy.|$|E
25|$|Diagnosis of late-onset CAH may be {{suspected}} {{from a high}} 17α-hydroxyprogesterone level, {{but some}} cases are so mild that the elevation is only <b>demonstrable</b> after cosyntropin stimulation.

25|$|According to {{standard}} conceptions of economic value (see the subjective theory of value), {{the goods and}} services of virtual economies do have a <b>demonstrable</b> value.

Elsewhere there was a discontinuity.|$|E
25|$|Little {{is known}} of the {{languages}} and no relationship to other languages is <b>demonstrable.</b> It appears that there were several language families on Tasmania, which would be {{in keeping with the}} long period of human habitation on the island. Joseph Greenberg proposed an Indo-Pacific superfamily which includes Tasmanian along with Andamanese and Papuan (but not Australian). This is not accepted by historical linguists.|$|E
25|$|The Yilgarn Craton and {{its cover}} {{sequences}} are host {{to a significant}} percentage of the world's endowment in economically <b>demonstrable</b> and recoverable reserves (EDR) of uranium. Most uranium is hosted within palaeochannels derived from granites of the Yilgarn Craton and/or its flanking Proterozoic orogens, and this metal is deposited within Tertiary or younger palaeodrainage and current drainage systems. Examples include Yeelirrie, Mulga Rock and Lake Way-Centipede.|$|E
25|$|Dravidian {{is one of}} {{the primary}} {{language}} families in the Nostratic proposal, which would link most languages in North Africa, Europe and Western Asia into a family with its origins in the Fertile Crescent sometime between the last Ice Age and the emergence of proto-Indo-European 4–6 thousand years BCE. However, the general consensus is that such deep connections are not, or not yet, <b>demonstrable.</b>|$|E
25|$|Two major {{trials of}} arthroscopic surgery for {{osteoarthritis}} {{of the knee}} found no benefit for these surgeries. Many medical insurance providers are now reluctant to reimburse surgeons and hospitals for what {{can be considered a}} procedure which seems to create the risks of surgery with questionable or no <b>demonstrable</b> benefit. However this is still a widely adopted treatment for a range of conditions associated with osteoarthritis, including labral tears, femoroacetabular impingement, osteochondritis dissecans.|$|E

In this style, a 10th dan rank is sometimes awarded posthumously for practitioners with a lifetime of <b>demonstrable</b> contributions {{to the practice of}} taekwondo.|$|E
25|$|Lassus {{remained}} Catholic {{during this}} age of religious discord, although not dogmatically so, as may be seen from his more worldly secular songs {{as well as his}} imitation Masses and Magnificats based on secular compositions. Nevertheless, the Catholic Counter-Reformation, which under Jesuit influence was reaching a peak in Bavaria in the late sixteenth century, had a <b>demonstrable</b> impact on Lassus' late work, including the liturgical music for the Roman Rite, the burgeoning number of Magnificats, the settings of the Catholic Ulenberg Psalter (1588), and especially the great penitential cycle of spiritual madrigals, the Lagrime di San Pietro (1594).|$|E
25|$|For some populations, {{access to}} {{healthcare}} and health resources is physically limited, resulting in health inequities. For instance, an individual might be physically incapable of traveling the distances required to reach healthcare services, or long distances can make seeking regular care unappealing despite the potential benefits. Costa Rica, for example, has <b>demonstrable</b> health spatial inequities with 12–14% {{of the population}} living in areas where healthcare is inaccessible. Inequity has decreased {{in some areas of}} the nation {{as a result of the}} work of healthcare reform programs, however those regions not served by the programs have experienced a slight increase in inequity.|$|E
25|$|Homeopathy is {{singled out}} {{as an example of}} a {{mainstream}} alternative medicine that has public support and taxpayer funding through the National Health Service. Dawkins explains that the rationale behind it is unfounded and demonstrates that the magnitude of dilution required is so great the patient is practically imbibing pure water. This is illustrated by the typical homeopathic dilution of 30C (1:10030, that is thirty steps of dilution by 1% each time), which requires a drop of active ingredient dissolved in a body of water greater than the whole ocean. Dawkins cites a 2005 meta-analysis by The Lancet that concludes that homeopathy has no consistently <b>demonstrable</b> effect on health.|$|E
25|$|It {{shares a}} large portion of its grammar and {{phonology}} with the rural dialects of the Southern United States, and especially older Southern American English. Several creolists, including William Stewart, John Dillard and John Rickford, argue that AAVE shares so many characteristics with African creole languages spoken around the world that AAVE itself may be an English-based creole language, separate from English; however, mainstream linguists maintain that there are no significant parallels and that AAVE is a <b>demonstrable</b> variety of the English language, having features that can be traced back mostly to the nonstandard British English of early settlers in the Southern United States.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, {{the company}} began to develop network {{encryption}} technologies, again {{in response to a}} growing number of similar requests from its customers. Early products in this sphere included PowerTelnet which is comparable to today's ssh, and PowerFTP, which provided encrypted file transfer. In February 1996, Freedman realized that this technology could be generalized, resulting in a general-purpose network encryption solution that would encrypt the traffic of any application, without requiring much, if any, modification to that application. Chmilar, Huxley, and Lowe worked hard to prepare a <b>demonstrable</b> version of this new CipherLink product in time for the Networld+Interop trade show in April, 1996. The product was well received, and became a finalist for the Best Product of Show award at the trade show that year.|$|E
25|$|Whilst an {{extremely}} lopsided result {{occurred in the}} 2013 series and the Australians were accused of demonstrating apathy to the concept, a 2014 series featuring current and former All-Australian players occurred, one that {{was regarded as a}} <b>demonstrable</b> success. During a successful training camp in New York City ahead of the 2015 Series, Australian coach Alastair Clarkson gave his strongest pitch yet for the expansion of the series to include a test match in America and even an actual American international rules team, to facilitate a tri-nations format. In May 2016, the GAA and AFL announced an agreement to not have a test match in 2016 and instead renew the 2-match aggregate series in 2017 (in Australia), with a view to conducting further series in the following years in both Ireland and the United States.|$|E
25|$|In an {{interview}} with Marc Maron that summer, Andy Richter noted the contradiction between Ebersol's comments and {{the actions of the}} network. The <b>demonstrable</b> impact of The Jay Leno Show on the ratings of local news across the country was the direct cause of the cancellation of The Jay Leno Show, and gave lie to Ebersol's implication that lead-ins are irrelevant. Leno's Tonight Show, in contrast, had always enjoyed healthy lead-ins courtesy of a strong NBC primetime line-up. Furthermore, the network would have reportedly faced a US$150 million penalty in order to release Leno from his contract, making O'Brien the far less expensive host to get rid of and running counter to the assertion that his ratings were the cardinal factor in being pushed out of the traditional Tonight Show time slot.|$|E
25|$|Hyposalivation is a {{clinical}} diagnosis {{that is made}} based on the history and examination, but reduced salivary flow rates have been given objective definitions. Salivary gland hypofunction {{has been defined as}} any objectively <b>demonstrable</b> reduction in whole and/or individual gland flow rates. An unstimulated whole saliva flow rate in a normal person is 0.3–0.4 ml per minute, and below 0.1 ml per minute is significantly abnormal. A stimulated saliva flow rate less than 0.5 ml per gland in 5minutes or less than 1 ml per gland in 10minutes is decreased. The term subjective xerostomia is sometimes used to describe the symptom {{in the absence of any}} detectable abnormality or cause. Xerostomia may also result from a change in composition of saliva (from serous to mucous). Salivary gland dysfunction is an umbrella term for the presence of either xerostomia or salivary gland hypofunction.|$|E
25|$|Mechanism: In the future, further {{investigation}} of the precise steps involved in the mechanism of hydrogen bond catalysis will be required that will enable chemists to rationally design catalytic strategies for more complex or more useful transformations. For comparison, the basic steps of palladium-catalyzed cross coupling have been systematically and thoroughly studied {{over the last few}} decades and have led to dramatic advances in catalytic scope, control and reaction design principles. For example, improved understanding of oxidative addition has led to aryl chlorides becoming practical coupling partners, while improved understanding of reductive elimination has {{led to the development of}} new reactions involving sp3 centers. Knowing these fundamental catalytic steps, the ability to rationally plan new reactions and cascades has been extremely useful in the field of total synthesis. In contrast, we lack a general, systematic mechanistic understanding of the steps of hydrogen bond catalysis and how to influence them. Detailed mechanistic studies have so far been limited to individual systems, and their findings have not been of <b>demonstrable</b> predictive use.|$|E
25|$|In {{the winter}} of 1176/1177, the chronicle reveals that Guðrøðr was {{formally}} married to Muirchertach's granddaughter, Findguala Nic Lochlainn, in a ceremony conducted {{under the auspices of}} the visiting papal legate, Vivian, Cardinal priest of St Stephen in Celio Monte. The precise date when Guðrøðr and Findguala commenced their liaison is unknown, and the two could have been a couple for some time before their formal marriage. It is possible that the union was originally brokered as a compromise on Muirchertach's part, as a means to placate Guðrøðr for withdrawing from Dublin. The <b>demonstrable</b> unreliability of the chronicle's chronology, and the apparent corroboration of events by the Annals of the Four Masters and the Annals of Ulster, suggests that the Guðrøðr's adventure in Dublin date to about 1162. Such a date, however, appears to contradict the fact that Guðrøðr seems to have endured Norwegian exile in 1160/1161, and apparently only returned to the Isles in 1164. If the chronicle's date is indeed correct, Guðrøðr's inability to incorporate Dublin into the Kingdom of the Isles could well have contributed to his loss of status to Somairle.|$|E
25|$|Since TRIPS {{came into}} force, {{it has been}} subject to {{criticism}} from developing countries, academics, and non-governmental organizations. Though some of this criticism is against the WTO generally, many advocates of trade liberalisation also regard TRIPS as poor policy. TRIPS's wealth concentration effects (moving money from people in developing countries to copyright and patent owners in developed countries) and its imposition of artificial scarcity on the citizens of countries that would otherwise have had weaker intellectual property laws, are common bases for such criticisms. Other criticism {{has focused on the}} failure of TRIPS to accelerate investment and technology flows to low-income countries, a benefit advanced by WTO members in the lead-up to the agreement's formation. Statements by the World Bank indicate that TRIPS has not led to a <b>demonstrable</b> acceleration of investment to low-income countries, though it may have done so for middle-income countries. Lengthy patent periods under TRIPs have been scrutinised for unduly slowing the entry of generic substitutes and competition to the market. In particular, the illegality of pre-clinical trials or submission of samples for approval until a patent expires have been blamed for driving the growth of a few multinationals, rather than developing country producers.|$|E
