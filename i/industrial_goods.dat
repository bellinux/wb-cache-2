5|$|By 1960, the Cold War raged {{between two}} superpowers: the United States, a {{capitalist}} liberal democracy, and the Soviet Union (USSR), a Marxist–Leninist socialist state {{ruled by the}} Communist Party. Expressing contempt for the U.S., Castro shared the ideological views of the USSR, establishing relations with several Marxist–Leninist states. Meeting with Soviet First Deputy Premier Anastas Mikoyan, Castro agreed to provide the USSR with sugar, fruit, fibers, and hides, in return for crude oil, fertilizers, <b>industrial</b> <b>goods,</b> and a $100 million loan. Cuba's government ordered the country's refineries – then controlled by the U.S. corporations Shell and Esso – to process Soviet oil, but under U.S. pressure, they refused. Castro responded by expropriating and nationalizing the refineries. Retaliating, the U.S. cancelled its import of Cuban sugar, provoking Castro to nationalize most U.S.-owned assets on the island, including banks and sugar mills.|$|E
5|$|Brezhnev {{was able}} to criticise Kosygin by {{contrasting}} him with Vladimir Lenin, whom Brezhnev {{claimed to have been}} more interested in improving the conditions of Soviet agriculture than improving the quality of light <b>industrial</b> <b>goods.</b> Kosygin's support for producing more consumer goods was also criticised by Brezhnev, and his supporters, most notably Konstantin Chernenko, for being a return to quasi First World policies. At the 23rd Party Congress Kosygin's position was weakened when Brezhnev's supporters were able to increase expenditure on defence and agriculture. However, Brezhnev did not have a majority in the Politburo, and could count on only four votes. In the Politburo Kosygin could count on Kiril Mazurov's vote, and when Kosygin and Podgorny were not bickering with each other, they actually had a majority in the Politburo over Brezhnev. Unfortunately for Kosygin this was not often the case, and Kosygin and Podgorny were constantly disagreeing on policy.|$|E
5|$|Real {{advantages}} of the peace came in the economic field. As an open economy, the Republic needed unhindered trade. It was heavily dependent on exports of agricultural products to the British markets, and on its services sector (especially its large merchant fleet, and the banking sector), whereas its industry (whatever remained of it after a century of being confronted by foreign protectionism) also was dependent on exports. All these sectors had suffered enormously from the war: the British blockade and French and British privateering had almost brought marine trade to a standstill, whereas a commercial treaty with France (which would have ended French discrimination of Dutch trade in <b>industrial</b> <b>goods)</b> proved an ever-receding fata morgana. True, much of the trade had shifted to flags of convenience (especially that of the U.S.A. and European neutrals like Prussia), but the peace made the resurgence of the Dutch carrying trade fully practicable. Nevertheless, some changes proved irreversible, like the shift of trade patterns to German ports, {{and the decline of}} the fisheries.|$|E
40|$|Adopting {{the basic}} Ricardian static trade model, Two-country (Home and Foreign), Two-goods (Agricultural and Industrial) and One-factor (labour) model with {{environmental}} resource, we extended Copland and Taylor (1999) in three points. Firstly, we assumed pollution should be trans-boundary. Secondly, we considered the technical difference between two countries. Thirdly, we introduced international migration. We {{assumed that the}} only difference between two countries is the pollution protecting technology caused by industrial production. There will occur three different situations depending on the strength of demand on <b>industrial</b> <b>good.</b> Firstly, if <b>industrial</b> <b>good</b> is strongly preferred, the country with low technology (country L) will specialize in production of <b>industrial</b> <b>good</b> and another country (country H) will produce both goods. In this case, if trade is permitted, country L will gain while whether country H will gain or not is ambiguous. Moreover, after free trade, there occurs no international migration. Secondary, if both goods are preferred almost equally, then country H (L) will specialize agricultural (<b>industrial)</b> <b>good.</b> Whether free trade is beneficial or not for each country depends on parameters. After trade, there remains wage gap between two countries and therefore international migration from L to H will occur. Thirdly, if <b>industrial</b> <b>good</b> is weakly preferred, then country L produces both goods while country H produces agricultural good only. In this case free trade will reduce the economic welfare of country L while the effects on country H is ambiguous. After free trade, workers will migrate from L to H if permitted. In the second and third cases, migration expands the production of agricultural good but reduces that of <b>industrial</b> <b>good</b> and it will continue until comparative advantage of each country diminishes. If we consider that one of the two goods is non-tradable, there is no possibility of international trade but if international migration is permitted, workers in country L will migrate to country H, which will not end before all of inhabitants in country L quit their home country. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the link between}} government spending on a public good and pattern of trade {{in the presence of}} specialization-based external economies. The results presented in this paper are based on a simple model of an economy that produces one industrial, one agricultural, one public good and a large number of varieties of professional services. It is shown that, when the agricultural and the public goods are non-traded, the country where government spending is relatively large is a net-exporter of varieties of professional services; if varieties of professional services are equally (or more) capital intensive as compared to the <b>industrial</b> <b>good.</b> When the public good and varieties of professional services are non-traded, the country where government spending is relatively large may export the <b>industrial</b> <b>good</b> in exchange for the agricultural good; if the combined capital intensity of professional services and the <b>industrial</b> <b>good</b> is greater than the capital intensity of the agricultural good and the size of specialization-based external economies is sufficiently small.

5|$|The port {{remained}} open {{to service}} the papermills, importing wood pulp and esparto grass from Russia and Scandinavia, using mainly East European registered vessels after World War II. Requiring a return load, {{the result was that}} Watchet became a leading UK port for the export of car parts, tractors and other <b>industrial</b> <b>goods.</b> However, with the replacement of coal with oil from the mid-1960s, the port traffic began to terminally decline. The harbour was in commercial use until 2000, the harbour has now been converted into a marina for pleasure boats. It is surrounded by renovated quaysides and narrow streets. The commercial esplanade has been refurbished with new shelters, information points, and the provision of new paving in some areas, as well as railings, lamps, curved benches, planters and new tree plantings. There are several museums in the town, including the Market House Museum, which explores the history of the town and its harbour. The building was constructed in 1820 {{on the site of the}} previous market house which had been demolished in 1805. It was converted into a museum in 1979. It houses a collection of exhibits about the natural history of Watchet and the surrounding area. The focus is on nautical and maritime history of the port. Artefacts include those relating to: Archaeology, Coins and Medals, Land Transport, Maritime, Natural Sciences, Science and Technology and Social History. At the rear of the museum building is the old town lock-up for the temporary detention of people, often drunks who were usually released the next day or to hold people being brought before the local magistrate. The Watchet Boat Museum, which is housed in the 1862 Victorian architecture former railway goods shed, displays the unusual local flatner boats and associated artefacts.|$|E

25|$|<b>Industrial</b> <b>goods</b> used in {{agricultural}} production {{were sold to}} agricultural units in the 1980s. Local cooperatives or state supply and marketing bureaus sold most agricultural producer goods, including chemical fertilizers and insecticides, to households at set prices. The state also offered preferential prices for agricultural inputs to grain farmers to encourage grain production. Households were permitted to purchase agricultural machinery and vehicles to transport goods to market. In {{order to ensure that}} rural units could cover the costs of the increasing quantities of industrial inputs required for higher yields, the government periodically reduced the prices of the <b>industrial</b> <b>goods</b> sold to farmers, while raising the procurement prices for agricultural products. In the mid-1980s, however, the price gap between agricultural and industrial products was widening to the disadvantage of farmers.|$|E
40|$|We {{work with}} a basic general {{equilibrium}} model of an economy with an <b>industrial</b> <b>good</b> and a rural <b>good.</b> <b>Industrial</b> <b>good</b> production results in pollution that affects the provision of ecosystem services and thereby {{the production of the}} rural good. The assignment of ecosystem rights to the industrial polluters or to the rural pollutees results in differential transaction costs that affect production possibilities between the two goods. Ecosystem rights are assigned to maximize social welfare. Over time, technological change and differences in income superiority affect the choice of the assignment of rights. Opening to trade affects the choice of the assignment of ecosystem rights depending on the nature of technological change, but the relative income superiority of goods no longer affects the assignment of ecosystem rights in a small economy. Thus, among other findings, we demonstrate that the phenomena known as the environmental Kuznets curve does not hold for the protection of ecosystem services in production, or production externalities generally, because trade separates consumption from production. ...|$|R

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} that provision of production infrastructure, among other things, attracts foreign investment. In {{the context of a}} small open economy model where monopolistic competition prevails in the intermediate good sector, this paper focuses on the impact of changes in the supply of a public good on foreign investment and welfare. From {{the point of view of}} producers, the public good is akin to public infrastructure that reduces the fixed cost associated with the production of the intermediate good.
