I.E., most kitchen sinks evacuate water with a -inch drain pipe, which feeds into a larger 4-inch drain pipe on the main plumbing stack before heading to a septic tank or to the city sewage system. This means that, barring intrusion by tree roots or other debris into buried piping, {{the vast majority of}} household drain clogs occur in the smallest-diameter piping, usually in the pop-up or <b>drain</b> <b>trap,</b> where they can be reached easily by a hydro-mechanical device's water hose.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{describe}} the epidemiology of a protracted nosocomial clonal outbreak due to multidrug-resistant IMP- 8 producing Klebsiella oxytoca (MDRKO) that was finally eradicated by removing an environmental reservoir. The outbreak {{occurred in the}} ICU of a Spanish hospital from March 2009 to November 2011 and evolved over four waves. Forty-two patients were affected. First basic (active surveillance, contact precautions and reinforcement of surface cleaning) and later additional control measures (nurse cohorting and establishment of a minimum patient/nurse ratio) were implemented. Screening of ICU staff was repeatedly negative. Initial environmental cultures, including dry surfaces, were also negative. The above measures temporarily controlled cross-transmission but failed to eradicate the epidemic MDRKO strain that reappeared {{two weeks after the}} last colonized patients in waves 2 and 3 had been discharged. Therefore, an occult environmental reservoir was suspected. Samples from the drainpipes and traps of a sink were positive; removal of the sink reduced the rate number but did not stop new cases that clustered in a cubicle whose horizontal drainage system was connected with the eliminated sink. The elimination of the horizontal drainage system finally eradicated the outbreak. In conclusion, damp environmental reservoirs (mainly sink <b>drains,</b> <b>traps</b> and the horizontal drainage system) could explain why standard cross-transmission control measures failed to control the outbreak; such reservoirs should be considered even when environmental cultures of surfaces are negative...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Acid sulfate {{soils are}} weak {{mechanically}} and therefore highly erodible, if drain banks are not properly stabilised, they {{are prone to}} collapse, dumping into the drains eroded soil and sediments, which are highly acidic and loaded with heavy metals and nutrients. Low flow velocities in the drains allow iron mono-sulphides and metal oxides to accumulate due to the high iron, aluminium and other metal concentrations in drainage waters. In north Queensland, the establishment of vetiver grass {{has been shown to}} control channel bank erosion, lower frequency of <b>drain</b> maintenance, <b>trap</b> sediments in runoff water and reduce acidic loading by exposing less acid sulfate soil in the drain wall to oxidisation and leaching.

Two years after its closure, the entire area of the sediment trap (16 ha) was subjected to soil science and phytosociological investigation. Differentiated moisture content and soil conditions of the sediment tank surface were favourable for the settlement of various species characterised by differing site requirements which conferred a completely new quality to this post-industrial land and its biodiversity.

40|$|AlGaN/GaN High Electron Mobility Transistors (HEMTs) {{have enjoyed}} {{tremendous}} market growth in RF power amplifiers {{over the past}} decades. In the quest for enhancing the operating frequency of GaN HEMTs, {{there has been a}} great effort to scale down the gate length. Maintaining acceptable short-channel effects requires shrinking the barrier thickness at the same time. However, a limitation exists since there is a minimum barrier thickness that is needed to obtain a sufficiently high two-dimensional electron gas density. One possible solution to this problem is the use of a new barrier material, i. e., InAlN. Due to its high spontaneous polarization, if InAlN is used as a barrier material in GaN HEMTs, a much smaller layer thickness is required compared with conventional HEMTs. This enables further barrier thickness scaling and therefore gate length scaling and a higher frequency response. However, as a relatively new structure, reliability studies of InAlN/GaN HEMTs are still lacking. Solid reliability is essential before the wide commercial deployment of this new technology. This thesis investigates the most relevant degradation mechanisms under important stress regimes, aiming at building a comprehensive understanding of InAIN/GaN HEMT reliability. Through investigating various voltage, current, and temperature stress levels, we have identified one recoverable degradation mechanism as well as three permanent degradation mechanisms. Under high <b>drain</b> voltage, hot-electron <b>trapping</b> results in temporary drain current decrease and drain resistance increase. In addition, under high drain voltage but relatively low drain current level, permanent negative threshold voltage shift and drain current increase have been observed. We attribute the phenomena to dehydrogenation of pre-existing defects in GaN channel by hot electrons. Under high positive gate bias, defect generation in the AIN interlayer due to high electric field across AIN has proven to be responsible for the observed gate leakage current increase. Also, under high-power stress conditions, positive threshold voltage shift and maximum drain current decrease have been consistently observed. We verified through both thermal stress experiments and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) analysis that Schottky gate sinking is the cause. This work provides fundamental understanding of potential reliability concerns in InAlN/GaN HEMTs and is essential in accelerating the future commercialization of this promising technology. by Yufei Wu.

40|$|This Corrective Action Plan {{has been}} {{prepared}} for Corrective Action Unit (CAU) 562, Waste Systems, {{in accordance with the}} Federal Facility Agreement and Consent Order (1996; as amended March 2010). CAU 562 consists of 13 Corrective Action Sites (CASs) located in Areas 2, 23, and 25 of the Nevada National Security Site. Site characterization activities were performed in 2009 and 2010, and the results are presented in Appendix A of the Corrective Action Decision Document for CAU 562. The scope of work required to implement the recommended closure alternatives is summarized. (1) CAS 02 - 26 - 11, Lead Shot, will be clean closed by removing shot. (2) CAS 02 - 44 - 02, Paint Spills and French Drain, will be clean closed by removing paint and contaminated soil. As a best management practice (BMP), asbestos tile will be removed. (3) CAS 02 - 59 - 01, Septic System, will be clean closed by removing septic tank contents. As a BMP, the septic tank will be removed. (4) CAS 02 - 60 - 01, Concrete Drain, contains no contaminants of concern (COCs) above action levels. No further action is required; however, as a BMP, the concrete drain will be removed. (5) CAS 02 - 60 - 02, French Drain, was clean closed. Corrective actions were completed during corrective action investigation activities. As a BMP, the drain grates and drain pipe will be removed. (6) CAS 02 - 60 - 03, Steam Cleaning Drain, will be clean closed by removing contaminated soil. As a BMP, the steam cleaning sump grate and outfall pipe will be removed. (7) CAS 02 - 60 - 04, French Drain, was clean closed. Corrective actions were completed during corrective action investigation activities. (8) CAS 02 - 60 - 05, French Drain, will be clean closed by removing contaminated soil. (9) CAS 02 - 60 - 06, French Drain, contains no COCs above action levels. No further action is required. (10) CAS 02 - 60 - 07, French Drain, requires no further action. The french drain identified in historical documentation was not located during corrective action investigation activities. (11) CAS 23 - 60 - 01, Mud <b>Trap</b> <b>Drain</b> and Outfall, will be clean closed by removing sediment from the mud trap. As a BMP, the mud trap and outfall pipe will be removed. (12) CAS 23 - 99 - 06, Grease Trap, will be clean closed by removing sediment from the grease trap and backfilling the grease trap with grout. (13) CAS 25 - 60 - 04, Building 3123 Outfalls, will be clean closed by removing contaminated soil and the sludge-containing outfall pipe...|$|R
