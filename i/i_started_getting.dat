500|$|Aquemini {{begins with}} the {{introductory}} track [...] "Hold On, Be Strong", which was written by session guitarist Donny Mathis and was originally a full song with verses, but the group preferred to only use the hook.

[...] "Return of the G" [...] addresses concerns from fans who felt that the group's style had changed too drastically since the release of Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik, {{as well as those}} who make poor decisions in order to keep their street credibility. When discussing the lyrical content of the song, André 3000 explained, [...] "I was young and wilder and some of my fashion choices people didn't accept at the time. <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>getting</b> flak from some people, so they were like, 'Either he's gay or on drugs'... 'Return of the Gangsta' was trying to give them a sense of, 'Hey, I'm still a regular person.'" [...] "Rosa Parks" [...] contains blues-influenced guitar work and folksy harmonies that [...] "announce OutKast's distinctive style of Southern boogie. The groove goes into overdrive during a clapping, foot-stomping breakdown funkified by a fierce harmonica as the kick drum pounds incessantly." ...|$|E

2500|$|Fator's success {{stems from}} {{combining}} singing, ventriloquism, and comedy. Fator {{was the lead}} singer in bands and often did impersonations of singers Garth Brooks, Etta James, James Taylor and Dean Martin, while ventriloquism had been just a comic side gig for him. In 2005, Fator decided to combine his talents, singing, ventriloquism, comedy, and impersonations.
