5|$|Striding Edge is {{a notorious}} {{accident}} spot among hikers and scramblers. In winter conditions the climb from Striding Edge {{up to the}} summit plateau can involve crossing steep icy ground and a snow cornice, and {{can be the most}} dangerous part of the walk. Without an <b>ice</b> <b>axe</b> or crampons this presents a serious obstacle. In January 2008 two walkers died after falling from the ridge in separate incidents. Another walker died after falling from Striding Edge in May 2008.|$|E
5|$|The {{details of}} the murder are sketchy. Carol was killed due to blunt trauma to her face by means of some instrument, alleged in court {{to have been an}} <b>ice</b> <b>axe.</b> She was then bound with rope, using complex knots, weighed down with rocks and lead pipes and thrown {{overboard}} from a boat on Coniston Water. The body landed on an underwater ledge where it was later found by amateur divers. Had it been dropped a few metres further from the shore, it would have sunk to the much deeper bottom and probably never have been discovered.|$|E
5|$|Details of Carol's death were {{revealed}} in the post mortem. There were severe injuries to the skull, and {{it was said that}} her face had been smashed by multiple blows. It was later found in court that the murder weapon had been an <b>ice</b> <b>axe.</b> The body was found to be in a foetal position, which suggested that the body had been dealt with within a few hours of death, before rigor mortis could settle in. It has since been said that the investigators failed to acknowledge that rigor mortis passes in a 24‑to48‑hour time period, and that the body could feasibly have been trussed once rigor mortis had passed. Many unusual knots were used to tie the body, and the same knots were said to be used in Gordon Park's house and boat. This was one of the key pieces of evidence used against Gordon in the trial.|$|E
50|$|Early <b>ice</b> <b>axes</b> had {{picks and}} adzes of about equal lengths. By the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, the pick lengthened to about twice the length of the adze. Improvements in crampon design (pioneered by Eckenstein in 1908) and ice climbing technique led to use of shorter, lighter <b>ice</b> <b>axes</b> appropriate to steeper ice climbs in the period between the world wars.|$|R
50|$|The {{physical}} {{designs of}} ice tools differ more widely {{than those of}} other <b>ice</b> <b>axes.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{head of an}} <b>ice</b> <b>axe</b> {{typically}} possesses an adze for chopping rough {{steps in}} ice.|$|E
25|$|From the {{discovery}} of a serious rope-jerk injury around Mallory's waist, which was encircled by the remnants of a climbing rope, it appears that he and Irvine were roped together when one of them slipped. Mallory's body lay 300m below and about 100m horizontal to the location of an <b>ice</b> <b>axe</b> found in 1933, which is generally accepted from three characteristic marks on the shaft as belonging to Irvine. The fact that the body was relatively unbroken, apart from fractures to the right leg (the tibia and fibula were broken just above the boot), in comparison to other bodies found in the same location that were known to have fallen from the North-East Ridge, strongly suggests that Mallory could not have fallen from the <b>ice</b> <b>axe</b> site, but must have fallen from much lower down. Wang reportedly found Mallory's <b>ice</b> <b>axe</b> near his body (and took it with him). If this is true, then Mallory not only survived the initial fall with Irvine, but was in possession of his axe until the last seconds before striking a rock that stopped his final fall. When found, his body was sun-bleached, frozen and mummified.|$|E
25|$|On 20 August 1940, Mercader {{was alone}} with Trotsky in the exiled Russian's study, under the pretext of showing him a document. Mercader struck from behind and fatally wounded Trotsky {{on the head with}} an <b>ice</b> <b>axe</b> while the exiled Russian was looking at the document.|$|E

5000|$|Glacier hiking {{describes}} {{the activity of}} hiking on a glacier with special equipment. This equipment includes crampons, rows, suspender belts, helmets and <b>ice</b> <b>axes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Regardless of route, Mount Hood is a {{technical}} climb. It requires ropes, crampons, and <b>ice</b> <b>axes.</b> Approximately 95% of Mount Hood's climbs occur April through July.|$|R
25|$|At the time, Odell {{observed}} {{that one of}} the men surmounted the Second Step of the northeast ridge. Apart from his testimony, though, no evidence has been found that Mallory and Irvine climbed higher than the First Step; one of their spent oxygen cylinders was found shortly below the First Step, and Irvine's <b>ice</b> <b>axe</b> was found nearby in 1933. They never returned to their camp.|$|E
25|$|On June 4, 2000, Diana Kornet, 29, slipped as she {{was looking}} over the {{northeast}} side of Mount Hood. She fell about 2500ft to her death. She and six friends had reached the summit about 7 am. She unroped - as many climbers do - and left her <b>ice</b> <b>axe</b> {{when she went to}} take a look. It was windy in this exposed location. After one of her companions called 911, the sheriff's office sent a search plane and found Kornet's body at the 8,700-foot level at the top of Eliot Glacier.|$|E
25|$|A mass fall {{occurred}} as the climbers began the traverse. George Bell slipped {{and fell on}} a patch of hard ice, pulling off his rope-mate Tony Streather. As they fell their rope became tangled with those connecting Houston, Bates, Gilkey and Molenaar, pulling all these climbers off as well. Finally the strain came onto Pete Schoening, who had been belaying Gilkey and Molenaar. Quickly wrapping the rope around his shoulders and <b>ice</b> <b>axe,</b> Schoening held all six climbers, some of whom had by that point fallen over 100m. Had he not done so, the entire team, apart from Craig who was unroped, would have fallen around 2000m to the Godwin-Austen Glacier.|$|E
50|$|CAMP {{manufactures}} a {{wide range}} of products, including <b>ice</b> <b>axes,</b> crampons, <b>ice</b> screws, pitons, carabiners, nuts, tricams, camming devices, harnesses, helmets, rucksacks, tents, ski racing clothing, and various snow tools.|$|R
5000|$|William and Fanny Bullock Workman {{explored}} Karakoram glaciers in 1908 and Fanny {{was photographed}} beside her {{modified version of}} the Mummery tent. In 1920 Harold Raeburn discussed an improved design with a groundsheet attached and commented that <b>ice</b> <b>axes</b> were too short to be tent poles. He recommended that two bamboo sticks [...] long should be taken to fit over the ends of the <b>ice</b> <b>axes.</b> These tents were among those used on the 1921 British Mount Everest reconnaissance expedition and two Mummeries were used at the East Rongbuk Glacier camp before and after the culminating ascent to the North Col.|$|R
50|$|Eckenstein {{was also}} a pioneer in {{developing}} new equipment and climbing methods. He started using shorter <b>ice</b> <b>axes</b> {{which could be used}} single-handed, designed the modern crampons and improved on the nail patterns used for the climbing boots.|$|R
25|$|After {{leading a}} failed {{struggle}} of the Left Opposition against the policies and rise of Joseph Stalin in the 1920s and against the increasing role of bureaucracy in the Soviet Union, Trotsky was removed from power (October 1927), expelled from the Communist Party (November 1927), exiled to Alma–Ata (January 1928), and exiled from the Soviet Union (February 1929). As {{the head of the}} Fourth International, Trotsky continued from exile to oppose the Stalinist bureaucracy in the Soviet Union. On 20 August 1940, Trotsky was assassinated by Ramón Mercader, a Spanish-born NKVD agent, passing away the next day in a hospital. Mercader, who attacked Trotsky with an <b>ice</b> <b>axe,</b> acted upon instruction from Stalin and was nearly beaten to death by Trotsky's bodyguards, with Mercader spending 20 years in a Mexican prison for murdering Trotsky. Stalin presented Mercader with an Order of Lenin in absentia.|$|E
500|$|Falls Trail is a [...] {{difficult}} loop, {{estimated to}} take 4 to 5hours to hike. The January 2009 issue of Backpacker Magazine named the Falls Trail loop the best hike in Pennsylvania, {{as part of}} the magazine's Reader's Choice Awards. It boasts a series of wild, free-flowing waterfalls, each cascading though rock-strewn clefts, and passes through a stand of old-growth forest. The park's website stresses the difficulty of the trail, and The New York Times calls it [...] "difficult and potentially dangerous" [...] near the top of glens. The Falls Trail was [...] "rehabilitated" [...] in 2008 to make the [...] "easier to hike". The trail is closed during the winter months to hiking, but it is open to ice climbing. The ice climbers must use an <b>ice</b> <b>axe,</b> crampons, and rope.|$|E
500|$|The {{court found}} that Gordon had first put his hands around Carol's neck to {{strangle}} her, but that she had struggled. He then grabbed his <b>ice</b> <b>axe,</b> and brought it down with what was described as [...] "considerable" [...] force on Carol's face, and smashed the front right-hand side of her face, splitting open her head and smashing her teeth. He then did this again [...] the attack was described as consisting of [...] "two big heavy, crushing blows" [...] by pathologist Dr. Edwin Tapp. After this, Gordon dumped his wife's body in the lake, {{and went back to}} his day-to-day life. During the trial, the prosecution speculated that Gordon had [...] "drugged his wife, possibly on or around the 17 July, tied her up and stored her body in a chest freezer before dumping it in Coniston Water".|$|E
5000|$|Ice climbing: Ascending ice or hard snow {{formations}} using special equipment, usually <b>ice</b> <b>axes</b> and crampons. Techniques {{of protecting}} the climber {{are similar to those}} of rock climbing, with protective devices (such as ice screws and snow wedges) adapted to frozen conditions.|$|R
2500|$|The Fred Hoyle Collection at St John's College Library {{contains}} [...] "a pair {{of walking}} boots, five boxes of photographs, two <b>ice</b> <b>axes,</b> some dental X-rays, a telescope, ten large film reels and an unpublished opera" [...] {{in addition to}} 150 document boxes of papers.|$|R
50|$|On April 26, 2006, {{the school}} opened a $58-million Student Union and Recreation Center. The Student Union and Recreation Center {{is home to}} a {{full-sized}} rock-climbing wall, fully equipped gymnasium, and an outdoor recreation office, which rents everything from rafts, to snowshoes and <b>ice</b> <b>axes.</b>|$|R
500|$|Gordon {{was again}} arrested on 13 January 2004. Police {{said at the}} time that the murder file had never been closed, and that the arrest {{followed}} new leads. These new leads were later reported to be a confession by Michael Wainwright, who claimed to have been a cellmate of Gordon's during his short prison stay in 1997. The police then revisited the site where the body was discovered, and found a piece of Westmorland green slate, a stone that matched the rocks that made up the wall of the family's bungalow. The case was brought to trial at Manchester Crown Court, and lasted ten weeks. There was no single piece of evidence that pointed to Gordon indisputably, but the prosecution argued that when the evidence was placed together, it could only point at Park, and not a [...] "mysterious stranger or secret lover". Primarily, the case for the prosecution rested on circumstantial evidence, with the jury being asked to consider knots, rocks used to weight down the body and the <b>ice</b> <b>axe,</b> all linking Gordon Park to the crime. However, the statements of Michael Wainwright, and another of Gordon's cellmates, who had learning difficulties, were also used as evidence by the prosecution. He was sentenced to be jailed for life, and told that he must serve at least 15 years. The judge said that he had taken into account the [...] "terrible concealment" [...] of the body.|$|E
2500|$|The other {{significant}} find made on Mallory's body was a severe, golf-ball size puncture wound in his forehead, {{which was the}} likely cause of his death. The unusual puncture wound is consistent with one which might be inflicted by an <b>ice</b> <b>axe,</b> leading some to conclude that, while Mallory was descending in a self-arrest [...] "glissade", sliding down a slope while dragging his <b>ice</b> <b>axe</b> in the snow to control the speed of his descent, his <b>ice</b> <b>axe</b> may have struck a rock and bounced off, striking him fatally.|$|E
2500|$|The summit {{was less}} than [...] above Norton {{when he decided to}} turn around because of {{increasing}} terrain difficulty, insufficient time and doubts of his remaining strength. He re-joined Somervell at 2p.m.; and they descended. Shortly after they joined up, Sommervell accidentally dropped his <b>ice</b> <b>axe</b> and it fell down the north face and out of view.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, Chouinard and {{business}} partner Tom Frost began studying ice climbing equipment, and re-invented the basic tools (crampons and <b>ice</b> <b>axes)</b> {{to perform on}} steeper ice. These new tools and his book Climbing Ice (1978) started the modern sport of ice climbing.|$|R

500|$|There are no trails to the summit. Even the [...] "easier" [...] southside {{climbing}} {{route is}} a technical climb with crevasses, falling rocks, and often inclement weather. Ropes, <b>ice</b> <b>axes,</b> crampons and other technical mountaineering gear are necessary. Peak climbing season is generally from April to mid-June.|$|R
2500|$|Anthony Walker (21 February 1987 [...] 30 July 2005) was a Black British {{student of}} African descent from Huyton, Merseyside, England, who was murdered with an <b>ice</b> <b>axe</b> by Michael Barton (brother of footballer Joey Barton) {{and his cousin}} Paul Taylor, in an unprovoked racially {{motivated}} attack. Walker was eighteen years old and was {{in his second year}} of A-levels. He lived with his mother Gee Walker, his father Steve Walker, his two sisters and one brother.|$|E
2500|$|Winter backpacking {{requires}} {{a higher level}} of skill and generally more specialized gear than in other seasons. Skis or snowshoes may be required to traverse deep snow, or crampons and an <b>ice</b> <b>axe</b> where needed. Winter sleeping bags and tents are essential, as are waterproof, water-repellent, and moisture dissipating materials. Cotton clothing retains moisture and chills the body, both particularly dangerous in cold weather. [...] Winter backpackers stick to wool or synthetic fabric like nylon or polypropylene, which hold less moisture and often have specialized wicking properties to dissipate sweat generated during aerobic activities. Layering is essential, as wet clothes quickly sap body heat and can lead to frostbite or hypothermia.|$|E
2500|$|Of {{the highest}} peaks, only Mount Temple (...) has an {{established}} scrambling route. All other mountains (including other routes up Mount Temple), require more mountaineering skills and experience. Despite {{the fact that}} it is only a moderate scramble, even Mount Temple should not be attempted by novices. According to the Alpine Club of Canada, more people have died on Mount Temple than any other Canadian mountain, including seven youths in an unsupervised American school group in 1955. The upper slopes are usually covered with snow and there is a glacier on top. Scramblers on Mount Temple should carry an <b>ice</b> <b>axe</b> and enough clothing to survive a freezing night on the mountain if a storm hits and prevents them from descending.|$|E
500|$|Technical <b>ice</b> <b>axes,</b> fall protection, and {{experience}} are now recommended {{in order to}} attempt the left chute variation or Pearly Gates ice chute. The Forest Service is recommending several other route options due to these changes in conditions (e.g. [...] "Old Chute", West Crater Rim, etc.).|$|R
5000|$|... (The term [...] "Ice pick" [...] {{also finds}} use in {{referring}} to a category of mountaineering tools {{sometimes referred to as}} <b>ice</b> <b>axes,,</b> whose gross form has two members somewhat perpendicular to each other, thus evoking a scythe or hoe rather than a rapier or needle.) ...|$|R
50|$|Standard backpacking gear is {{required}} for a crossing, but also gear that accounts for alpine campsites exposed to high winds and severe weather elements. <b>Ice</b> <b>axes</b> and crampons are useful for traversing ice. Climbing rope, with or without harnesses, is suggested in case of exposure to crevasses.|$|R
