It is a store of chemical energy which, in all its wide variety of forms, originates from the process of photosynthesis. Whether the use of biomass is sustainable and environmentally sound is determined by the source of the biomass, production methods and land use, alternative treatments when biomass {{is in the form of}} organic wastes, and the type of energy conversion processes involved. In all cases the level of greenhouse gas emissions is low or zero. Life cycle analyses to determine the environmental impacts of modern biomass have shown the overall system can be environmentally benign. In the longer term there are good opportunities for biomass to be used in environmentally sound, small scale, distributed generation systems including fuel cells and micro-turbines, suitable for both developed and developing countries.

50|$|Several {{studies in}} recent years have found a multi-decadal {{oscillation}} increase in OHC of the deep and upper ocean regions and attribute the <b>heat</b> <b>uptake</b> to anthropogenic warming.

40|$|Previous {{studies on}} the effect of mass <b>uptake</b> of <b>heat</b> pumps on the {{capability}} of local or national electricity grids have relied on modelling or small datasets to create the aggregated heat pump load profile. This article uses the UK Renewable Heat Premium Payment dataset, which records the electricity consumption of nearly 700 domestic heat pump installations every 2 minutes, to create an aggregated load profile using an order of magnitude more sites than previously available. The aggregated profile is presented on cold and medium winter weekdays and weekends and is shown to contain two peaks per day, dropping overnight to around 40 % of its peak. After Diversity Maximum Demand (ADMD) for the population of heat pumps is calculated as 1. 7 kW per site; this occurs in the morning, whereas the peak national grid demand occurs in the evening. Analysis is carried out on how heat pump ADMD varies with number of heat pumps in the sample. A simple upscaling exercise is presented to give a first order approximation of the increase in GB peak electricity demand with mass deployment of heat pumps. It is found that peak grid demand increases by 7. 5 GW (14 %) with 20 % of households using heat pumps. The effect of the same <b>heat</b> pump <b>uptake</b> on grid ramp rate is also discussed; this effect is found to be minor.

40|$|AbstractDiphenhydramine (DPH) {{is one of}} the {{pharmaceuticals}} {{commonly found}} in the effluent stream after wastewater treatment, and the cause of its environmental persistence needs to be addressed urgently. Smectite minerals are common soil components with large surface area, expandable interlayer, and high cation exchange capacity (CEC), thus are capable of adsorbing or intercalating inorganic or organic cations on the surface or in the interlayer. In this study the intercalation of DPH in the interlayer of a Ca-smectite was characterized by X-ray diffraction, infra-red, and thermogravimetric analyses supported by molecular dynamic simulation. At the low (0. 2 – 0. 3 CEC) and high (0. 6 – 0. 7 CEC) adsorption levels, the intercalated DPH might take a horizontal monolayer or a bilayer configuration, resulting in a d 001 expansion to 15 or 17 Å, respectively. As the amount of DPH intercalation increased, a gradual, yet systematic, dehydration due to removal of hydrated inorganic cation Ca 2 + from the interlayer was observed. In addition, the intercalated DPH had a slightly higher thermal stability due to the shield effect of the host mineral smectite against <b>heat.</b> The <b>uptake</b> of DPH by the smectite was attributed to both electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged mineral surfaces and the positively charged tertiary amine and cation exchange interactions between DPH+ and hydrated Ca 2 +. Thus, smectite minerals could serve as a sink to remove dissolved DPH from water on the one hand, and as a carrier to transport intercalated DPH in the environment on the other hand...|$|R

Denote the sensitivity, i.e. the equilibrium increase in global mean temperature including the effects of feedbacks due to a sustained forcing by doubled [...] (taken as 3.7 W/m2), as x °C. If Earth were to experience an equilibrium temperature change of ΔT (°C) due to a sustained forcing of ΔF (W/m2), then {{one might say that}} x/(ΔT) = (3.7 W/m2)/(ΔF), i.e. that x = ΔT * (3.7 W/m2)/ΔF. The global temperature increase {{since the beginning of the}} industrial period (taken as 1750) is about 0.8 °C, and the radiative forcing due to [...] and other long-lived greenhouse gases (mainly methane, nitrous oxide, and chlorofluorocarbons) emitted since that time is about 2.6 W/m2. Neglecting other forcings and considering the temperature increase to be an equilibrium increase would lead to a sensitivity of about 1.1 °C. However, ΔF also contains contributions due to solar activity (+0.3 W/m2), aerosols (-1 W/m2), ozone (0.3 W/m2) and other lesser influences, bringing the total forcing over the industrial period to 1.6 W/m2 according to best estimate of the IPCC AR4, albeit with substantial uncertainty. Additionally the fact that the climate system is not at equilibrium must be accounted for; this is done by subtracting the planetary <b>heat</b> <b>uptake</b> rate H from the forcing; i.e., x = ΔT * (3.7 W/m2)/(ΔF-H). Taking planetary <b>heat</b> <b>uptake</b> rate as the rate of ocean <b>heat</b> <b>uptake,</b> estimated by the IPCC AR4 as 0.2 W/m2, yields a value for x of 2.1 °C.

Although geothermal is unique amongst renewables for its baseload and renewable <b>heat</b> provision capabilities, <b>uptake</b> continues to lag far behind that of solar and wind. This is mainly attributable to (i) uncertainties over resource availability in poorly-explored reservoirs and (ii) the concentration of full-lifetime costs into early-stage capital expenditure (capex). Recent advances in reservoir characterization techniques are beginning to narrow the bounds of exploration uncertainty, both by improving estimates of reservoir geometry and properties, and by providing pre-drilling estimates of temperature at depth. Advances in drilling technologies and management have potential to significantly lower initial capex, while operating expenditure is being further reduced by more effective reservoir management—supported by robust models—and increasingly efficient energy conversion systems (flash, binary and combined-heat-and-power). Advances in characterization and modelling are also improving management of shallow low-enthalpy resources that can only be exploited using heat-pump technology.

30|$|Due {{to their}} unique {{properties}} such as biodegradability, biocompatibility, and controlled release, natural biopolymers and proteins have recently increased attention in gene delivery. Biopolymers are polymers produced by living organismsand {{can be categorized}} in three groups: polysaccharides, proteins, and nucleic acids. To fabricate nanoparticles from these biopolymers, for therapeutic objects, a variety of materials have been used [25]. Naturally derived proteins such as collagen, elastin, and fibronectin {{have been used in}} biomaterial nanoparticle fabrication. Silk proteins due to their properties such as slow biodegradability, biocompatibility, self-assembling property, excellent mechanical property, and controllable structure and morphology are promising materials as biomaterial nanoparticles [25]. Collagen, the main component of extracellular matrix, {{is one of the main}} biomaterials in fabrication of gene delivery nanoparticles due to biocompatibility, low antigenicity, and biodegradability. Collagen can be formed to hydrogels without the use of chemical crosslinking, but additional chemical treatment is necessary for prepared nanoparticles due to their weak mechanical strengths [23, 25]. Collagen is often chosen as a biomaterial because this protein is abundant in the animal kingdom and plays a vital role in biological functions, such as tissue formation, cell attachment, and proliferation [30]. In addition, proteins such as albumin, β-casein, and zein are good candidates for fabrication of nanoparticles due to their non-immunogenicity, non-toxicity, biodegradability, and biocompatibility [29]. Albumin can be considered an ideal material as a delivery carrier due to its remarkable properties including high binding capacity, high stability in pH and <b>heat,</b> preferential <b>uptake</b> in tumor and inflamed tissue, biodegradability, low toxicity, low immunogenicity, and suitable blood circulation with a half-time of 19  days [29, 31]. Beta casein, the major milk protein, can self-assemble into micellar structure by intermolecular hydrophobic interactions. Therefore, its micellar structure is a suitable feature for the delivery applications. Zein is an alcohol-soluble protein existence in corn with properties such as biocompatibility, low water uptake value, high thermal resistance, and good mechanical properties. The main application of zein is in edible coating for foods and pharmaceuticals. Zein exists as small nanosized globules and consists of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acid residues; therefore, it has been applied as a promising carrier system [23, 25, 29].|$|R

We investigated {{the role of}} FcRII and FcRIII in the phagocytosis of group B streptococci (GBS) by measuring neutrophil uptake of radiolabeled type III GBS. The mean uptake of GBS opsonized with human serum containing complement and specific antibody was 76 %, but when this serum was <b>heated,</b> the mean <b>uptake</b> was only 22 %. A monoclonal antibody to FcRIII, Leu- 11 b, inhibited in a dose-dependent manner uptake of GBS opsonized with heated or intact serum to maxima of 40 and 30 %, respectively. Conversely, a monoclonal antibody to FcRII, IV. 3, inhibited by 77 % the uptake of GBS opsonized with heated serum but had no effect when GBS was opsonized with intact serum. Leu- 11 b and IV. 3 had an additive inhibitory effect with heated but not with intact serum. Neither monoclonal antibody inhibited the uptake of GBS opsonized with hypogammaglobulinemic serum. Therefore, FcRII is the primary mediator of the phagocytosis of GBS opsonized by antibody alone, whereas FcRIII plays a lesser role. Surprisingly, FcRII is not necessary for phagocytosis when complement is also present. FcRIII participates, to a limited extent, in phagocytosis of GBS opsonized with antibody whether or not complement is present. These {{findings suggest that the}} function of FcRII in triggering phagocytosis may be particularly important in host defense against type III GBS in the setting of complement deficiency of young infants...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{diffusion}} of ions in compactedbentonite clay. Laboratory experiments were performed toexamine in detail different processes that affect thediffusion. To demonstrate that the results obtained from thelaboratory investigations are valid under in situ conditions,two different kinds of in situ experiments were performed. Laboratory experiments were performed to better understandthe impact of ionic strength on the diffusion of Sr 2 + and Cs+ions, which sorb to mineral surfaces primarily by ion exchange. Furthermore, surface related diffusion was examined anddemonstrated to take place for Sr 2 + and Cs+ but not for Co 2 +,which sorbs on mineral surfaces by complexation. The diffusion of anions in bentonite clay compacted todifferent dry densities was also investigated. The resultsindicate that anion diffusion in bentonite clay consists of twoprocesses, one fast and another slower. We ascribe the fastdiffusive process to intralayer diffusion and the slow processto diffusion in interparticle water, where anions are to someextent sorbed to edge sites of the montmorillonite. Two different types of in situ experiments were performed,CHEMLAB and LOT. CHEMLAB is a borehole laboratory, where cation(Cs+, Sr 2 + and Co 2 +) and anion (I- and TcO 4 -) diffusionexperiments were performed using groundwater from a fracture inthe borehole. In the LOT experiments cylindrical bentoniteblocks surrounding a central copper rod were placed in a 4 mdeep vertical borehole. The borehole was then sealed and theblocks are left for 1, 5 or>> 5 years. When the bentonitewas water saturated the central copper rod is heated tosimulate the temperature increase due to radioactive decay ofthe spent fuel. Bentonite doped with radioactive Cs and Co wasplaced {{in one of the}} lower blocks. Interestingly, the redox-sensitive pertechnetate ion (TcO 4 -) which thermodynamically should be reduced and precipitate asTcO 2 ·nH 2 O, travelled unreduced through the bentonite. However, at some spots in the clay, the Tc activity wasconsiderably higher. We ascribe these activity peaks toiron-containing minerals in the bentonite, by which Tc(VII) hasbeen reduced to Tc(IV) and precipitated. The cations Sr 2 +, Cs+and Co 2 +, as well as the anion I-, behaved in the CHEMLABexperiments as expected from laboratory studies. Three experiments in the LOT series are completed. The firsttwo diffusion experiments in LOT were less successful, thefirst {{due to the fact that}} saturation of the bentonite was notobtained during the experimental period and the radionuclidesdid not move at all. In the second, the uptake of the bentoniteparcel was less successful. Water from the drilling flushedaway large pieces of the top part of the bentonite and thelower part of the test parcel was super-saturated with waterand expanded when released from the rock. The activity distribution in the second experiment wasanalysed. The Co 2 + profile looked as we had expected, while Cs+had spread more than our calculations indicated. However, thethird experiment was successful from emplacement, watersaturation and <b>heating</b> to <b>uptake.</b> The activity distribution forboth cations was as expected from laboratory studies.

40|$|Kafirin and zein are alcohol-soluble prolamin-type {{proteins}} {{that can be}} used to make biodegradable, environmental-friendly bioplastic films and coatings. Despite this potential, there is no commercial process for kafirin extraction. Zein, though commercially produced, is expensive. Factors affecting kafirin and zein extraction and bioplastic quality were studied. Specifically, the effects of sorghum and maize grain particle size, inclusion of glacial acetic acid and sodium hydroxide in the aqueous ethanol extractant on extract filtration time, protein preparation purity and yield; as well as effect of heating kafirin and zein films on water uptake and film digestibility were investigated. Sorghum meal with particle size > 1 mm gave more rapid extract filtration time than sorghum flour with particle size < 250 ?m, due to larger inter-particle spaces. Sorghum flour yielded a kafirin preparation with lower purity (50 %) than sorghum meal (58 %). Kafirin extracted from distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS) had a higher purity (78 %) than kafirin from sorghum meal (68 %) and zein (69 %). Washing decorticated sorghum and maize meals to remove starch prior to protein extraction substantially increased protein preparation purity. Inclusion of sodium hydroxide resulted in a slightly higher protein preparation purity and yield than inclusion of acetic acid. SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions revealed more dimers in kafirin than zein, while kafirin from DDGS contained polymers, indicating polymerisation due to cross-linking occurring during DDGS drying. All films absorbed water but remained whole on soaking. Heat treated films prepared from kafirin extracted from washed sorghum meal absorbed less water (approximately 42 %), compared to zein films (approximately 47 %) due to its greater hydrophobicity and heat induced intermolecular disulphide cross-linking. Heating had no effect on DDGS kafirin film water uptake because it was highly cross-linked. In vitro pepsin and total digestion were less for kafirin films than zein films, probably due to the greater hydrophobicity of kafirin. Heating the films resulted in reduced digestibility, probably due to heat induced disulphide bonding. Extraction of kafirin and zein from coarse meal enables more rapid filtration than from fine flour. Acetic acid-ethanol method appears to be a simpler extraction procedure than NaOHethanol method as it does not require protein neutralisation. Washing decorticated sorghum and maize meals prior to protein extraction improves protein preparation purity. Sorghum DDGS shows potential as a starting material for kafirin extraction for use in film making, based on high purity and low film water <b>uptake.</b> <b>Heating</b> the films decreases water uptake properties and reduces film digestibility.

The National Post used the subheading [...] "IPCC report skeptics seize on lull in global warming". Even Nature headlined their news report [...] "IPCC: Despite hiatus, climate change here to stay", though it said that [...] "the 'hiatus' since the record hot year of 1998 — probably due to increased <b>heat</b> <b>uptake</b> by the oceans — is no sign that global warming has stopped, as some would like to hope", and quoted climatologist Thomas Stocker saying that [...] "Comparing short-term observations with long-term model projections is inappropriate", and adding [...] "We {{know that there is a}} lot of natural fluctuation in the climate system. A 15-year hiatus is not so unusual even though the jury is out as to what exactly may have caused the pause." [...] He said that claims dismissing climate models would only be justified if [...] "temperature were to remain constant for the next 20 years", and Brian Hoskins said other factors showed climate change.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to examine muscle <b>heat</b> production, oxygen <b>uptake</b> and {{anaerobic}} energy turnover throughout repeated intense exercise to test the hypotheses that (i) energy turnover is reduced when intense exercise is repeated and (ii) anaerobic energy production is diminished throughout repeated intense exercise. Five subjects performed three 3 min intense one-legged knee-extensor exercise bouts (EX 1, EX 2 and EX 3) at a power output of 65 ± 5 W (mean ±s. e. m.), separated by 6 min rest periods. Muscle, femoral arterial and venous temperatures were measured continuously during exercise for the determination of muscle heat production. In addition, thigh blood flow was measured and femoral arterial and venous blood were sampled frequently during exercise for the determination of muscle oxygen uptake. Anaerobic energy turnover was estimated as the difference between total energy turnover and aerobic energy turnover. Prior to exercise, the temperature of the quadriceps muscle was passively elevated to 37. 02 ± 0. 12 °C and it increased 0. 97 ± 0. 08 °C during EX 1, which was higher (P < 0. 05) than during EX 2 (0. 79 ± 0. 05 °C) and EX 3 (0. 77 ± 0. 06 °C). In EX 1 the rate of muscle heat accumulation was higher (P < 0. 05) during the first 120 s compared to EX 2 and EX 3, whereas the rate of heat release to the blood was greater (P < 0. 05) throughout EX 2 and EX 3 compared to EX 1. The rate of heat production, determined as the sum of heat accumulation and release, was the same in EX 1, EX 2 and EX 3, and it increased (P < 0. 05) from 86 ± 8 during the first 15 s to 157 ± 7 J s− 1 during the last 15 s of EX 1. Oxygen extraction was higher during the first 60 s of EX 2 and EX 3 than in EX 1 and thigh oxygen uptake was elevated (P < 0. 05) during the first 120 s of EX 2 and throughout EX 3 compared to EX 1. The anaerobic energy production during the first 105 s of EX 2 and 150 s of EX 3 was lower (P < 0. 05) than in EX 1. The present study demonstrates that when intense exercise is repeated muscle heat production is not changed, but muscle aerobic energy turnover is elevated and anaerobic energy production is reduced during the first minutes of exercise...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{simultaneously}} examine skeletal muscle heat production and ATP turnover in humans during dynamic exercise with marked differences in aerobic metabolism. This was done to test the hypothesis that efficiency is higher in anaerobic than aerobic ATP resynthesis. Six healthy male subjects performed 90 s of low intensity knee-extensor exercise with (OCC) and without thigh occlusion (CON-LI) as well as 90 s of high intensity exercise (CON-HI) that continued from the CON-LI bout. Muscle heat production was determined by continuous measurements of muscle heat accumulation and heat release to the blood. Muscle ATP production was quantified by repeated measurements of thigh oxygen uptake as well as blood and muscle metabolite changes. All temperatures of the thigh were equalized to ≈ 37 °C prior to exercise by a water-perfused <b>heating</b> cuff. Oxygen <b>uptake</b> accounted for 80 ± 2 and 59 ± 4 %, respectively, of the total ATP resynthesis in CON-LI and CON-HI, whereas it was negligible in OCC. The rise in muscle temperature was lower (P < 0. 05) in OCC than CON-LI (0. 32 ± 0. 04 vs. 0. 37 ± 0. 03 °C). The mean rate of heat production was also lower (P < 0. 05) in OCC than CON-LI (36 ± 4 vs. 57 ± 4 J s− 1). Mechanical efficiency was 52 ± 4 % after 15 s of OCC and remained constant, whereas it decreased (P < 0. 05) from 56 ± 5 to 32 ± 3 % during CON-LI. During CON-HI, mechanical efficiency transiently increased (P < 0. 05) to 47 ± 4 %, after which it decreased (P < 0. 05) to 36 ± 3 % at the end of CON-HI. Assuming a fully coupled mitochondrial respiration, the ATP turnover per unit of work was calculated to be unaltered during OCC (≈ 20 mmol ATP kJ− 1), whereas it increased (P < 0. 05) from 21 ± 4 to 29 ± 3 mmol ATP kJ− 1 during CON-LI and further (P < 0. 05) to 37 ± 3 mmol ATP kJ− 1 during CON-HI. The present data confirm the hypothesis that heat loss is lower in anaerobic ATP resynthesis than in oxidative phosphorylation and can in part explain the finding that efficiency declines markedly during dynamic exercise. In addition, the rate of ATP turnover apparently increases during constant load low intensity exercise. Alternatively, mitochondrial efficiency is lowered as exercise progresses, since ATP turnover was unaltered during the ischaemic exercise bout...|$|R
40|$|The {{accident}} of geography {{that creates a}} circumpolar channel of ocean at the latitude of Drake Passage has {{a profound impact on}} global ocean circulation patterns and climate. The strong eastward flow of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) connects the ocean basins, allowing the existence of a global-scale overturning circulation that dominates ocean heat transport. The tilting of density surfaces associated with the geostrophic flow of the ACC brings dense water to the surface at high latitudes. Water mass transformations where these layers outcrop link the upper and lower limbs of the overturning circulation. Water masses exported from the Southern Ocean ventilate the deep and intermediate layers of the ocean and play an important part in global budgets of heat, freshwater, carbon and nutrients. As well as influencing mean climate, the Southern Ocean plays a role in climate variability and is likely to both drive and respond to climate change. The existence of high quality atmospheric reanalyses at high southern latitudes has helped to clarify the main modes of southern hemisphere climate variability. The extent to which the ocean circulation is an active or passive partner in these modes remains a topic of active research. Climate models suggest the Southern Ocean overturning circulation is sensitive to climate change and that reductions in the strength of the overturning may result in positive feedback through a reduction in <b>heat</b> and carbon <b>uptake</b> by the ocean. Changes in Antarctic sea ice provide another potential climate feedback. Evidence is growing that changes are underway in the Southern Ocean system. The most dramatic changes have been observed on the Antarctic Peninsula, where air temperatures have increased more rapidly {{than anywhere else in the}} southern hemisphere in recent decades. The collapse of the Larsen B ice shelf and increased melt rates of floating glaciers on the western peninsula have been linked to increases in both water and air temperatures. Water mass changes over several decades have been observed through much of the Southern Ocean water column, with the rate of change in some near-bottom waters comparable in magnitude to the well-documented freshening observed in the deep North Atlantic. However, the short and gappy observational record makes it difficult to distinguish natural variability from climate change. Many of these changes may ultimately be linked to the positive trend of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) in recent decades. The source of the trend in the SAM is itself a topic of debate, with candidate explanations including depletion of ozone in the stratosphere, enhanced greenhouse warming, and natural variability [...] Pages: 1349 - 135...|$|R
