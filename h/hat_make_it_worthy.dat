Kirkus Reviews wrote the novel has a [...] "genuinely tender love story" [...] and [...] "insightful political commentary." ...|$|R

40|$|Agents are {{becoming}} widespread {{in a variety}} of computer systems and domains, but often appear to have little in common with each other. In this paper we look at different agent systems and identify what a generic agent should be composed of.

We then discuss the implications for the interaction of using agents, that is, the notion of a balanced interface, and briefly look at how an agent-based approach assists in two very different application domains...|$|R

The {{mean of the}} estimates of concentrations of toluene which reduce responding by 50 % is 2329 ppm and by 10 % is 1523 ppm. The results are compared with previous determinations that used a closed-chamber procedure. The values then were 1806 ppm and 1299 ppm. The difference in the 2 estimates would have no appreciable effect on decisions on permissible concentrations based on the estimates so the greater simplicity of the closed-chamber method <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>worthy</b> of con-sideration for routine purposes...|$|R

The proposed method uses an antenna of known performance and scales the size and frequency to conform with the LST 1 / 5 -th scale model. The simplification that the approach provides over switching antenna elements on board the LST or switching from the ground by frequency diversity <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>worthy</b> of consideration against the factors of performance, cost, reliability, and operations complexity. For LST applications, the system capabilities, requirements, and margins are summarized. The areas to be covered by further investigations into the proposed LST antenna are noted...|$|R

PopMatters said of the album: [...] "Beginning with the quietly devastating epic “Stone Dress”, it’s clear that O’ Doubt O’ Stars is aiming for something uncompromising and original.

5000|$|The Road to Dallas, {{about the}} Kennedy assassination, was {{published}} by Harvard University Press in 2008. The book accepts the Warren Commission's finding that Lee Harvey Oswald was the lone gunman, but posits {{that he was an}} opponent of Castro used by mafia leaders who wanted Kennedy and Castro dead. Publishers Weekly's review stated: [...] "While plenty of authors have argued that the Mafia and anti-Castro Cubans were behind the assassination of President Kennedy, few have done so as convincingly as... Kaiser."

The Production Code Administration was concerned that Kurt Muller escaped prosecution for his murder of Teck de Brancovis, and the Hays Office suggested it be established Kurt was killed by the Nazis {{at the end of the}} film in order to show he paid for his crime. Hellman objected and the studio agreed Kurt had been justified in shooting Teck, and the scene remained.|$|R

40|$|From 3 to 10 {{percent of}} the time, the solar wind has a radial proton {{temperature}} between 15, 000 K and 3500 K (the lowest recorded temperature). This 'cold' component shows some very important features that <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>worthy</b> of special study. It shows a temperature dependence on helicentric distance that is nearly adiabatic. When extrapolated back to 3 R(s), assuming adiabatic cooling, the resulting temperature for this cold component is in good agreement with coronal temperatures near the sonic point. Most importantly, the proton velocities and densities associated with this cold component match those predicted by solar wind models that do not incorporate significant wave heating. It is concluded {{that this is one}} solar wind component that fits well with appropriate models...|$|R

The city of Massa, in particular, saw much of its plan redesigned (new roads, plazas, intersections, pavings) in order to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>worthy</b> of an Italian country's capital.

Even {{those who}} may dissent from his {{opinions}} will consider {{that he was a}} man of genius, and that the world will take more interest in his slightest word than in the waters of Lethe which are so eagerly prescribed as medicinal for all its wrongs and woe. This drama, however, must not be judged for more than was meant. It is a mere plaything of the imagination; which even may not excite smiles among many, who will not see wit in those combinations of thought which were full of the ridiculous to the author. But, like everything he wrote, it breathes that deep sympathy for the sorrows of humanity, and indignation against its oppressors, which <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>worthy</b> of his name.|$|R
50|$|The Palace has a rich history, and the {{building}} and its site has been utilised in many different carnations over the decades.

50|$|Mendelssohn {{was only}} 15 {{when he began}} to write Camacho, but he had already written other Singspiel for {{performance}} within the family circle. The first act was completed in 1824, and he began work on the overture in February 1825. He revised Camacho carefully to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>worthy</b> of public performance. According to Felix's friend Eduard Devrient, who was to sing the role of Camacho, 'motherly fondness yearned to witness the son's great success'. The music to Camacho indicates that he had carefully studied the operas of Carl Maria von Weber and of Mozart. Despite Mendelssohn's youth, there are some striking features, including what is in effect a leitmotif played on the brass to characterise Don Quixote, which is also heard in the opening bars of the overture and in the opera's final cadence.|$|R

Kirchick further asserts that some of J Street's positions, such as advocating negotiations with Hamas, are not popular with most American Jews. According to a March 2008 Haaretz-Dialog poll the majority of Israelis do support direct talks with Hamas, although this referred solely {{to the issue of}} kidnapped Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. Jeremy Ben-Ami responded to Kirchick's charges during a May 26, 2008, interview published in Haaretz Magazine. Kirchick also reacted against J Streets endorsement of the play Seven Jewish Children, which many critics consider antisemitic.
