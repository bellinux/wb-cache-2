50|$|In {{the late}} 1930s, Bill Monroe formed the <b>Blue</b> <b>Grass</b> Boys (named after his native state of <b>Kentucky,</b> the <b>blue</b> <b>grass</b> state) and {{combined}} diverse influences into Appalachian folk music. These include Scottish, Poland and Southeastern Europe and folk, {{as well as}} doo wop, country and gospel. Monroe became the father of bluegrass music, and his band was a training ground for most of bluegrass' future stars, especially Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs. Flatt and Scruggs popularized bluegrass {{as part of the}} Foggy Mountain Boys, which they formed in 1948. Though bluegrass has never quite achieved mainstream status, it did become well-known through its use in several recorded plays, including the T.V. theme song for Beverly Hillbillies and the movies Bonnie and Clyde and Deliverance. In the 1950s, bluegrass artists included Stanley Brothers, Osborne Brothers and Jimmy Martin's Sunny Mountain Boys.|$|R

50|$|Seeds {{generated}} by apomixis are {{a means of}} asexual reproduction, involving the formation and dispersal of seeds that do not originate from the fertilization of the embryos. Hawkweed (Hieracium), dandelion (Taraxacum), some Citrus (Citrus) and <b>Kentucky</b> <b>blue</b> <b>grass</b> (Poa pratensis) all use this form of asexual reproduction. Pseudogamy occurs in some plants that have apomictic seeds, where pollination is often needed to initiate embryo growth, though the pollen contributes no genetic material to the developing offspring. Other forms of apomixis occur in plants also, including the generation of a plantlet in replacement of a seed or the generation of bulbils instead of flowers, where new cloned individuals are produced.|$|E

5000|$|In a wide sense, {{methods of}} {{vegetative}} propagation include cutting, vegetative apomixis, layering, division, budding, grafting and tissue culture. Cutting {{is the most}} common artificial vegetative propagation method, where pieces of the [...] "parent" [...] plant are removed and placed in a suitable environment so that they can grow into a whole new plant, the [...] "clone", which is genetically identical to the parent. Cutting exploits the ability of plants to grow adventitious roots (i.e. root material that can generate from a location other than the existing or primary root system, as in from a leaf or cut stem) under certain conditions.Vegetative propagation is usually considered a cloning method. However, there are several cases where vegetatively propagated plants are not genetically identical. Root cuttings of thornless blackberries will revert to thorny type because the adventitious shoot develops from a cell that is genetically thorny. Thornless blackberry is a chimera, with the epidermal layers genetically thornless but the tissue beneath it genetically thorny. Similarly, leaf cutting propagation of certain chimeral variegated plants, such as snake plant (Sansevieria trifasciata), will produce mainly nonvariegated plants.Grafting is often not a complete cloning method because seedlings are used as rootstocks. In that case only the top of the plant is clonal. In some crops, particularly apples, the rootstocks are vegetatively propagated so the entire graft can be clonal if the scion and rootstock are both clones.Apomixis (including apospory and diplospory) is a type of reproduction that does not involve fertilisation. In flowering plants, unfertilized seeds are involved, or plantlets that grow instead of flowers. Hawkweed (Hieracium), dandelion (Taraxacum), some citrus (Citrus) and many grasses such as <b>Kentucky</b> <b>blue</b> <b>grass</b> (Poa pratensis) all use this form of asexual reproduction. Bulbils are sometimes formed instead of the flowers of garlic.|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to develop an accurate design method for computing inlet hydrogaphs of surface runoff, with average recurrence intervals of 10, 25, and 50 years, from typical urban highway by flood routing technique. Resistance to sheet flows over natural turf surfaces is experimentally investigated. The formuation of a functional relationship between the resistence coefficient and controlling parameters for shallow flows over various turf surfaces is essential to the mathematical modeling of surface runoff from urban highway sideslopes covered with different species of turf. An analysis of results obtained from laboratory experiments from laminar flow on <b>Kentucky</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>grass</b> and Bermuda grass reveals that a relationship exists between the Darcy-Weisback friction coefficient, Reynolds number, and bed slope. Time did not premit tests to be performed on all species of turf other than <b>Kentucky</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>grass</b> and Bermuda grass which can be sodded.

40|$|Increased {{demand for}} {{water in the}} future may require a {{transition}} to more water efficient landscaping. Many landscapes in Utah use water inefficiently by maintaining non-native plant species that are not adapted to a semi arid environment or summer drought conditions characteristic of the Intermountain West. For example <b>Kentucky</b> <b>blue</b> <b>grass</b> (Poa pratensis), a cool season C 3 grass uses up to 762 mm of water {{a year in a}} semi arid environment where the precipitation rate averages only 330 mm a year. Buffalo grass (Buchloe dactyloides) a warm season C 4 grass native to the Great Plains is considered a low water use species adapted to a climate with only 380 mm of water a year. One of the objectives {{of this study was to}} compare soil water potentials and plant water use between traditional non native high water use and native drought tolerant landscapes during a 3 week dry-down at the Utah Botanical Center, Kaysville, Utah. Soil water potentials were measured using inexpensive Irrometer Watermark resistance blocks at 4 points and 3 depths (15, 45, and 90 CM) along an 11 m diagonal transect in 4, 2 X 2 replicated traditional and native landscapes. Each replicated landscape is installed in a (9. 1 m x 6. 1 m x 1. 6 m) drainage lysimeter, and is being monitored for seasonal changes in soil water status. Data from each landscape were compared during a dry down between DOY 216 to DOY 238 to measure differences in soil water potential and dry down response at the 12 locations in the soil profile. The 4 points along the diagonal transect include 3 landscape treatments. Ornamental annual and perennial shrubs and bunch grass, turf grass, and pine tree. At the end of the dry down on day of year 238 the soil profile had soil water potential values that were 50 % more negative at 15 and 45 cm under the non native <b>Kentucky</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>grass</b> compared to Buffalo grass. Soil water potentials were less negative under the mulched ornamental and pine tree treatments compared to the drier turf grass treatments indicating lower plant water use in the non turf grass treatments. Irrometer Watermark Blocks provide an inexpensive method to estimate relative changes in soil water potential, soil water transport, and plant water use over time and may be used to provide information for irrigation scheduling...|$|E
40|$|Background and objective: Asthma and {{allergic}} rhinitis are significant, increasing causes of morbidity worldwide. Pollen, {{a major cause}} of seasonal rhinitis/conjunctivitis, carries proteolytic enzymes on its surface. We showed previously that peptidase allergens from house dust mites compromise epithelial barrier function by degrading the extracellular domains of the tight junction proteins, occludin and claudin, thus facilitating allergen delivery across epithelial layers. In this study, we aimed to determine whether peptidases from allergenic pollens should similarly be considered to have a role in disrupting tight junctions. Methods: Diffusates from stored pollen of Giant Ragweed, White Birch and <b>Kentucky</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>Grass,</b> and fresh pollen from Easter Lily were applied to confluent monolayers of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) and Calu- 3 cells in serum-free medium. Immunofluorescence was performed for the tight junction proteins, occludin, claudin- 1 and ZO- 1. The effect of pollen diffusate on occludin was studied by Western blotting, and enzymatic activity in the diffusates was demonstrated by zymography. The ability of protease inhibitors to block the action of the diffusate on tight junctions was investigated. Results: Diffusates from all four allergenic pollens caused loss of immunofluorescence labelling for tight junction proteins on MDCK and Calu- 3 cells. The effect was blocked by inhibitors of serine and cysteine proteases. Degradation of occludin was demonstrated by Western blotting and zymography indicated that diffusates contain proteolytic activity. Conclusions: Pollen peptidases directly or indirectly disrupt epithelial tight junctions, and this activity should be considered as a possible mechanism for facilitating allergen delivery across epithelia. ...|$|E
