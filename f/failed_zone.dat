40|$|This Bureau of Mines report {{describes}} {{the results of}} an investigation for developing and applying procedures for stabilizing excavations openings in highly yielding ground. The approach developed in this report involves nonlinear modeling of the progressive relaxation of the zones of rock mass around the excavations opening where Coulomb criterion of failure is exceeded. Stresses are calculated by using a computer code; Coulomb-failure condition is examined for both intact rock and joints (using strength parameters [~] and c). The rock mass in the failed zones is relaxed by reducing the Young's modulus of the rock based on an empirical formulation that {{is a function of the}} shape of the opening and the extent of the <b>failed</b> <b>zone.</b> In addition, the material in the <b>failed</b> <b>zone</b> is assigned reduced strength paramters 0 ' and c'. The limiting (or convergent) relaxed zone is obtained through an iterative process by manually changing the rock modulus and the strength parameters between iterations. Support pressures are computed by applying forces normal to the excavation surface.

40|$|Abstract: Drilling of {{vertical}} wellbores in sandstone {{often results in}} stress-induced <b>failed</b> <b>zones</b> called breakouts. In the laboratory, miniature drilling under simulated far-field crustal stress con-ditions above a certain threshold produces breakouts that can be studied to enhance our under-standing of deformation and failure mechanisms in rock. We report on drilling experiments in St. Peter sandstone, an Ordovician aeolian rock consisting of well-rounded bimodal quartz grains held together by sutured contacts. Breakouts here are slot-shaped and oriented {{at right angles to}} the far-field maximum stress direction (sH), resembling emptied compaction bands. We distinguish between two porosity ranges in this rock. In the high-porosity variety (16 – 22 %), grains are bonded through narrow sutures. In the vicinity of the borehole at points aligned with the far-field least horizontal principal stress (sh) direction, where the maximum com-pressive stress concentrates, grain sutures sever at relatively low stress levels, leading to intergra-nular cracking. Debonded intact grains repack and produce a reduced-porosity narrow compaction band. Loose grains in the band abutting the borehole wall are then flushed out, assisted by the circulating drilling fluid. This intensifies the stress concentration ahead of the breakout tip, advan-cing the compaction band and lengthening the slot-shaped breakout. The process continue...|$|R
40|$|A {{significant}} {{component of}} underground mining costs stems from ground {{support in the}} form of rock bolts, mesh and screen, cable bolts, and shotcrete. Should any of this support approach or reach failure (stripped or broken cable bolts, severe bagging of screen, large numbers of broken rock bolts, etc.) then the support needs to be rehabilitated. This rehabilitation is often much more expensive than the initial support installation, due not just to the cost of the support, but to loss of access, down-time of that area of the mine, potential for injuries, and possible lost mining revenues. Many mines use instrumentation in critical infrastructure, such as haulage drifts, crusher stations, intersections, etc., to monitor the displacement of the backs and/or walls, support loads, etc. Data is generally collected by hand from time-to-time and entered into a database, but is analysed only if there is a problem (i. e. reactive engineering). Most mines today also utilize numerical modeling. These models, normally linear-elastic, are often not up to date and modeling is often done only in reaction to a problem. In certain cases modeling of the underground mining environment requires software packages that employ non-linear constitutive models (i. e. models that allow for failure to occur). Linear elastic models unrealistically allow for stresses to build up far beyond those at failure and hence do not redistribute stresses away from <b>failed</b> <b>zones.</b> The challenge with non-linear models is that they require the input o...|$|R

40|$|When the {{distributed}} rock stress {{around the}} roadways exceeds {{the strength of}} the rock, the rock is failed and a softening zone is formed. Roof deformation developed in the roof and ribs of the roadways are highly controlled by the depth of softening zones. The rock failure process starts from a point ahead of the face and grows into the roof, floor and ribs by advancing roadway. The maximum stress that can be transferred through the failed rocks would be equal to its residual confined strength. Therefore, rock stress is moved above <b>failed</b> <b>zone</b> and will create new failure zone if it is higher than the confined strength of rock at that depth. This process continues until the confined strength of the rock becomes higher than stress components. Bedding and lamination planes play a big role into the failure pathway of rocks around roadways. The thickness of softening zone is significantly influenced by the shear and tensile strength of bedding planes and laminations.

40|$|Abstract—Several {{models of}} user churn, resilience, and link {{lifetime}} have recently {{appeared in the}} literature [12], [13], [34], [35]; however, these results do not directly apply to classical Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) in which neighbor replacement occurs not only when current users die, but also when new user arrive into the system, and where replacement choices are often restricted to the successor of the <b>failed</b> <b>zone</b> in the DHT space. To understand neighbor churn in such networks, this paper proposes a simple, yet accurate, model for capturing link dynamics in structured P 2 P systems and obtains the distribution of link lifetimes for fairly generic DHTs. Similar to [8], our results show that deterministic networks (e. g., Chord [28], CAN [24]) unfortunately do not extract much benefit from heavy-tailed user lifetimes since link durations are dominated by small remaining lifetimes of newly arriving users that replace the more reliable existing neighbors. We also examine link lifetimes in randomized DHTs equipped with multiple choices for each link and show that users in such systems should prefer neighbors with smaller zones rather than larger age as suggested in prior work [13], [30].

The wet mix is poured into a concrete repository for on-site disposal. Solidified Saltstone is a dense, alkaline, reducing, micro-porous, monolithic, cementitious matrix, containing a solution of salts within its pore structure. Sodium sulfate concentrations in the pore fluid are around 0. 15 mol/L, and external sulfate attack on concrete barriers is expected to occur over time. To predict the long-term performance of concrete repositories, the STADIUM{reg_sign} code was used to simulate the reactive transport processes leading to formation of ettringite, an expansive mineral phase often associated with spalling or cracking. STADIUM{reg_sign} is a multi-ionic transport model based on a split operator approach that separates ionic movement and chemical reactions. Ionic transport is described by the extended Nernst-Planck equation for unsaturated media, and accounts for electrical coupling between ionic species, chemical activity, transport due to water content gradient, and temperature effects. STADIUM{reg_sign} does not predict whether physical damage will occur, or the impact on transport properties should fracturing occur. Thus the presence of ettringite was assumed to coincide with physical damage {{for the purpose of}} estimating effective transport properties. Effective properties for concrete barriers were estimated assuming complete hydraulic failure behind the ettringite front and unaltered properties ahead of the front.

40|$|Aspects of {{stability}} of access tunnels with particular {{reference to the}} factors controlling face access tunnel closure upon the efficiency of coal production and safety of longwall mining operations are investigated. These are used to justify the present studies of tunnel stability and barrier pillar design in mines of the Cape Breton Coalfield. An analysis of in situ deformation data of 26 face access tunnels by tunnel convergence measurement and a new photographic technique for approximately 40 km of tunnels are presented. Comparative studies of these techniques are made and deformation characteristics with respect to depth of cover, panel width, extracted seam height, barrier pillar width, type of steel arch supports {{and the effect of}} adjacent workings are investigated. Due to the narrow range of field data, the effect of such parameters as extracted seam height, panel width, tunnel shape and tunnel size could not be examined, nor could the influence which the material properties may have on tunnel closure be identified. Hence, comprehensive parametric studies by two dimensional finite element simulation of the face access tunnels by use of MSAP 2 D are undertaken. Stress and displacement distributions and the extent of any <b>failed</b> <b>zone</b> around the tunnel with respect to the aforementioned parameters together with barrier pillar width, and the stiffness of the surrounding materials are considered. The existing theories for tunnel convergence prediction are described. From this investigation it is found that some of these theories are inapplicable to soft rocks at depth. Those which are applicable, due to their limitations, are not suited for prediction of the vertical convergence profile from tunnel faceline in longwall coal mining. Hence, a new theoretical exponential formula for tunnel convergence prediction based on a modified Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion is developed and checked against in situ convergence measurements. The current barrier pillar design criteria are also investigated. It is found that these criteria yield too conservative a design and are not suited for depths greater than 600 m below ground surface. Hence, two theoretical methods of designing barrier pillar width for longwall coal mining are developed and compared with field data and current barrier pillar design criteria...|$|E
40|$|Sand {{production}} {{is a complex}} problem that has plagued {{the oil and gas}} industry for decades, leading to reduced productivity, wellbore instability, equipment failure and expensive sand control and management techniques. Therefore, a reliable prediction of the potential of a formation to produce sand as well as the mass and volume of the sand produced is required for an appropriate and economically effective sand management. In this thesis a novel approach (yield energy model) to predict the potential of formation to produce sand and to quantify the mass of sand produced around yielded wellbore region based on energy dissipation is presented. During drilling and hydrocarbon production, yield and fragmentation of rock around a wellbore may occur when the rock is exposed to stresses which exceed its failure criterion, creating yield zone and hence the potential for instability and sand production. Generally, in brittle rocks, grains are deformed elastically with increasing stress, storing strain energy in the process. The stored strain energy is dissipated during failure, some of which is available for the fragmentation of the rock along failure surfaces. It is argued that the major source of sand production in competent rock is associated with the debris created by slippage along shear fractures in the yielded zone along perforation wall. The potential for sand production and the mass or volume of the sand created around the yield zone is predicted by quantifying the reduction in strain energy stored in the rock as its yields around a completion on removal of completion fluid and the imposition of drawdown. The resultant sand then becomes available as a source for sand production. The yield energy model has been applied to assess the potential of several reservoir samples to produce sand and also quantify the mass of the sand produced as a result of formation instability caused by drilling and hydrocarbon production in a field specific manner. Results from laboratory testing of representative samples and field data has been utilised as input parameters. The extent of the <b>failed</b> <b>zone,</b> the sand production potential and the mass of debris have been analysed as a function of mud weights, drawdown pressures and production rates.

40|$|Present study {{concentrates}} {{primarily on}} radial crack propagation by the explosive gas {{pressure and the}} associated fracture formation, and on estimating the effects of natural discontinuities on rock fragmentation in bench blasting. Boundary element and finite element methods coupled with fracture mechanics theories are used to study the crack propagation. Fractal geometry principles are used to study the effect of natural discontinuities. Predicted stresses from conventional bench blasting model without any radial crack differ little from those around a pressurized hole in an infinite medium. Contrary to field observations, the radially symmetric stress field predicts a thin <b>failed</b> <b>zone</b> concentric with the hole. A loading rate dependent model, developed considering microflaws, suggest only long micro fractures become the radial cracks. The biaxial compression zone {{at the side of}} a radial crack suppresses smaller cracks. Other cracks can grow beyond this zone. Some die as the cracks become pressurized. Tensile σ₃ outside this zone peaks near the crack tip. A biaxial tension zone forms ahead of the crack tip. A multicrack model of bench blasting is developed. Biaxial compression zone forms near the hole. σ₃ is tensile outside this zone and peaks near the crack tips. Numerous tensile fractures form in these regions. Tensile fractures continue to form with radial crack growth and existing fractures grow in sliding. Stress redistribution around the fractures produces second and lower order fractures. These fractures break rock between the radial cracks. Pressurization of radial cracks is essential to propagate them for longer distances and to form associated fractures for further breakage of burden. The beam bending model produces unrealistically large burden displacement. The equivalent cavity hypothesis correctly estimates the stresses beyond the radial cracks but ignores the radial crack propagation and the associated breakage. It predicts a failed region concentric with the hole. The effect of natural discontinuities on fragmentation is determined by comparing the Schuhmann size distribution curves of the blasted fragments and the in-situ blocks. In-situ block and after blast fragments sizes, measured from photographs, are fractal which is analogous to Schuhmann Distribution. Exploiting the fractal characteristics eliminates the problems associated with size determination. Automated data reduction processes can make this method very powerful for routine monitoring and design optimization of blasts. Discontinuity pattern, fracture density, block density, fault structure, and microcracks in laboratory specimens are also fractal. Fractal behavior at microscale (10 ⁻⁶ m) to megascale (10 ⁵ m) implies Self-similar rock fracture formation. The fractal dimension {{may be related to the}} applied stress field...|$|E
40|$|The French National Radioactive Waste Management Agency (Andra) {{began in}} 2000 the {{construction}} of an Underground Research Laboratory (URL) with the main goal of demonstrating the feasibility of a geological repository in Callovo-Oxfordian claystone. Several research programs have taken place to improve the knowledge of the rock properties and its response to the excavation progress. A network of experimental drifts has been constructed with variations on: excavation method, structure geometry, supports system and orientations with respect to principal stresses’ directions. In each drift different sections have been instrumented to monitor the hydro-mechanical behavior of the rock mass formation. Continuous monitoring of the excavated zone around the drifts in the main level (- 490 m) revealed the development of a fractured zone (extensional and shear fractures) induced by the excavation. The extent of this fractured zone depends on the drift orientation regarding the in-situ stress field. Accordingly, the convergence measurements showed an anisotropic closure which depends also on the drifts’ orientations. Moreover, marked overpressures and an anisotropic pore pressure field around the drifts have been also observed. The approach proposed in this work is mainly based on a direct analysis of the convergence measurements, for studying the anisotropic response of the rock formation during and after excavation. The convergence evolution is analyzed {{on the basis of the}} semi-empirical law proposed by Sulem et al. (1987) [Int J Rock Mech Min Sci Geomech Abstr 24 : 145 – 154]. The monitoring and analysis of convergence data can provide a reliable approach of the interaction between rock mass and support. Therefore, the anisotropy and the variability of the closure are analyzed taking into account different field cases: drifts excavated in two different orientations (i. e. influence of the initial stress state), different methods, sizes and rates of excavation and different supports systems with different conditions of installation. This broad range of cases permits to refine the analysis for reliable predictions of the convergence evolution in the long term. This approach can thus be used for the design of various types of support and the evaluation of its performance in the long term. On the other hand, the pore pressure evolution induced by excavation of drifts as recorded in situ has been analyzed. The anisotropic response observed in-situ suggests that the intrinsic anisotropy of the material plays a key role in the response of the rock formation. To understand these phenomena, an anisotropic poroelastic analysis of the pore pressure evolution induced by the drift excavation is performed. The main goal is to simulate the main trends of the pore pressure evolution with a simple model taking into account the inherent anisotropy of the material. Finally, an analysis of the onset of failure shows the key role of the hydro-mechanical coupling on the extension of the <b>failed</b> <b>zone</b> around the driftsL'Agence nationale pour la gestion des déchets radioactifs (Andra) a commencé en 2000 la construction du Laboratoire Souterrain de Meuse / Haute-Marne (LS-M/HM) avec l'objectif principal de démontrer la faisabilité d’un stockage géologique dans l’argilite du Callovo-Oxfordien. Un réseau de galeries expérimentales a été excavé, principalement en suivant les directions des contraintes horizontales (majeure et mineure), avec des variations sur : la méthode d'excavation, la géométrie de la structure et le soutènement. Chaque galerie a été instrumentée en différentes sections pour suivre le comportement hydromécanique de la roche face à l’excavation. Le suivi de la zone autour des galeries excavées au niveau principal (- 490 m) a révélé le développement d'une zone fracturée (fractures en extension et en cisaillement) induite par l'excavation. La distribution de la zone fracturée dépend à la fois de l'orientation de la galerie et du champ de contraintes in-situ et a une influence importante sur la déformation des galeries. En effet, les mesures de convergence ont montré une fermeture anisotrope de la section de la galerie. De plus, il a été observé un champ de distribution anisotrope de la pression de pores ainsi que des surpressions autour des galeries. Afin d’analyser la réponse anisotrope du massif pendant l’excavation et après celle-ci, les travaux effectués dans le cadre de la thèse sont axés principalement sur une étude directe des mesures de convergence in-situ. Cette analyse s’effectue à l’aide de la loi semi-empirique proposée par Sulem et al. (1987) [Int J Rock Mech Min Sci Geomech Abstr 24 : 145 – 154]. A cet égard, différentes galeries excavées dans le LS-M/HM ont été étudiées. Ces galeries présentent certaines différences dans leurs orientations et l’état initial des contraintes, dans la méthode et la vitesse d’excavation ainsi que dans les diamètres de la section et les types de soutènements installées. Cette analyse permet d’obtenir des prédictions fiables de la convergence à long-terme, ce qui peut servir pour le dimensionnement et la prévision de la performance du soutènement à long-terme. En outre, nous avons étudié la réponse anisotrope du champ de pression interstitielle observée in-situ. Cette analyse est basée sur une approche poroélastique anisotrope. L’objectif principal est de reproduire qualitativement l’évolution de la pression des pores autour des galeries avec une approche simple qui prend en compte l’anisotropie intrinsèque du matériau.

Hemipelagic, or "no-event" lithofacies comprise about 50 % of total sediment cored. Mass-transported sediment, or "event" lithofacies, including fine-grained turbidites and debris flows, comprise the remaining cored material. Synsedimentary deformation features were observed in cores taken from the acoustically identified disturbed zones. [...] Wisconsinan sedimentation on the Scotian Slope has been largely affected by glacial events. Processes related to ice margins and lower sea levels served to transport material to the slope. High sedimentation rates and vigorous environmental conditions resulted in abundant sediment failures, producing the event lithofacies. During non-active sedimentation periods, background depositional processes resulted in hemipelagic deposition with abundant bioturbation. The entire study area is covered by a are to two metre drape of fine-grained, bioturbated, Holocene sediment. [...] The aocustically-deJfined disturbed zones record the occurrence of a large scale sediment fMlure.

30|$|In China, Road Traffic Signs and Markings Manual (GB 5768 - 2009), {{which is}} the National Standards of the People’s Republic of China (2009), {{contains}} guidelines for implementing traffic control devices in school zones. However, the guidelines are relatively vague, only mention speed limit signs, School Bus Stop Ahead signs, and the School Crossing Ahead Warning Assembly. Besides, it doesn’t offer specific requirements for the of these traffic control devices under various traffic, road and environmental conditions. Therefore, the national standard of the school <b>zone</b> <b>fails</b> to provide sufficient guidance for {{the proper use of}} traffic control devices.|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, the {{failures}} {{that occurred during}} the construction of the Jamuna Bridge Abutment in Bangladesh have been investigated. In particular, the influence of heterogeneity on slope stability has been studied using statistical methods, random field theory and the finite element method. The research is divided into three main parts: the statistical characterization of the Jamuna River Sand, based on an extensive in-situ and laboratory database available for the site; calibration of the laboratory data against a double-hardening elastoplastic soil model; and stochastic finite element slope stability analyses, using a Monte Carlo simulation, to analyse the slope failures accounting for heterogeneity. The sand state has been characterised in terms of state parameter, a meaningful quantity which can fully represent the mechanical behaviour of the soil. It was found that the site consists of predominantly loose to mildly dilative material and is very variable. Also, a Normal distribution was found to best represent the state parameter and a Lognormal distribution was found to best represent the tip resistance. The calibration of the constitutive model parameters was found to be challenging, as alternative approaches had to be adopted due to lack of appropriate test results available for the site. Single-variate random fields of state parameter were then linked to the constitutive model parameters based on the relationships found between them, and a parametric study of the abutment was then carried out by linking finite elements and random field theory within a Monte Carlo framework. It was found that, as the degree of anisotropy of the heterogeneity increases, the range of structural responses increases as well. For the isotropic cases, the range of responses was relatively smaller and tended to result in more localised failures. For the anisotropic cases, {{it was found that the}}re are two different types of deformation mechanism. It was also found that, as the vertical scale of fluctuation becomes bigger, the range of possible structural responses increases and failure is more likely. Finally, it was found that the <b>failed</b> <b>zones</b> observed during the excavation of the West Guide Bund of the Jamuna Bridge Abutment could be closely predicted if heterogeneity was considered in the finite element analyses. In particular, it was found that, for such a natural deposit, a large degree of anisotropy (in the range of 20) could account for the deformation mechanisms observed on site.

40|$|The {{magnetic}} lineation pattern {{produced by}} the Gorda Rise reflects a complex tectonic history marked by propagating ridges and nonrigid deformation of the Gorda plate. The Pacific-side lineation pattern is matched using a kinematic model which incorporates northward and southward propagating ridge segments and ridge rotation. By superimposing flexural-slip style deformation on the resulting Gorda-side lineations, and allowing convergent motion at the Mendocino Fracture Zone, the Gorda magnetic pattern is also successfully predicted. A similar model, but one which does not allow convergence at the Mendocino Fracture <b>Zone,</b> <b>fails</b> to produce the observed lineation pattern. Model predictions {{of the amount of}} material that would be 'obducted' at the Mendocino due to convergence between the Gorda and Pacific agree with bathymetric and density estimates of the amount of material located along the Mendocino Ridge...|$|R
50|$|Omaha {{started the}} game with {{possession}} and drove 40 yards before giving up a fumble to Nebraska. Nebraska failed to capitalize, coming as close as 1 yard from the end zone before a penalty setback eventually resulted in the drive coming up empty. Omaha's subsequent possession ended early when an attempt to kick {{the ball out of}} the end <b>zone</b> <b>failed</b> and the kicker was tackled for a safety by Charles Chandler and James Porterfield, marking Nebraska's first-ever points scored and putting them ahead 2-0. After several possession changes, Nebraska came close enough to try for a field goal. However, the play was executed as a drop-kick, and although it went through the uprights it was ruled as a punt by the officials, and no points were awarded.|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{describe}} {{the extent to}} which presynaptic structures at the embryonic neuromuscular junction of Drosophila can form in mutants where development of postsynaptic somatic muscles is affected. Although twist mutant embryos lack mesoderm, motor axons still grow out of the CNS and form morphologically normal presynaptic active zones, independent of their target cells. In myoblast city mutant embryos, myoblasts do not fuse but form fully differentiated mononucleate muscles, which make functional neuromuscular synapses with correctly localized presynaptic active <b>zones.</b> Myoblasts also <b>fail</b> to fuse but still attract appropriate innervation in mef 2 mutant embryos. However, these myoblasts fail to differentiate into muscles and presynaptic active <b>zones</b> <b>fail</b> to localize at neuromuscular contacts. Thus, the process of synapse formation can be genetically separated from the process of target recognition, revealing that localization of presynaptic active zones requires mef 2 -dependent muscle differentiation...|$|R
40|$|SummaryCD 8 α+ {{dendritic}} cells (DCs) prime cytotoxic T lymphocytes during viral {{infections and}} produce interleukin- 12 {{in response to}} pathogens. Although the loss of CD 8 α+ DCs in Batf 3 −/− mice increases their susceptibility to several pathogens, we observed that Batf 3 −/− mice exhibited enhanced resistance to the intracellular bacterium Listeria monocytogenes. In wild-type mice, Listeria organisms, initially located in the splenic marginal zone, migrated to the periarteriolar lymphoid sheath (PALS) where they grew exponentially and induced widespread lymphocyte apoptosis. In Batf 3 −/− mice, however, Listeria organisms remain trapped in the marginal <b>zone,</b> <b>failed</b> to traffic into the PALS, and were rapidly cleared by phagocytes. In addition, Batf 3 −/− mice, which lacked the normal population of hepatic CD 103 + peripheral DCs, also showed protection from liver infection. These results suggest that Batf 3 -dependent CD 8 α+ and CD 103 + DCs provide initial cellular entry points within the reticuloendothelial system by which Listeria establishes productive infection...|$|R
