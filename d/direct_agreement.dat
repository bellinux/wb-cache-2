500|$|Take-Two filed {{a lawsuit}} against 3D Realms over their failure to {{complete}} Duke Nukem Forever, citing that they paid $12 million to Infogrames in 2000 to acquire the publishing rights. 3D Realms argued, however, that they never received that money, as it was a <b>direct</b> <b>agreement</b> between Infogrames and Take-Two. The lawsuit seemed to be over a contractual breach, but not regarding the $12 million mentioned above. Take-Two asked for a restraining order and a preliminary injunction, to make 3D Realms keep the Duke Nukem Forever assets intact during proceedings, but the court denied the publisher's request for a temporary restraining order. In December 2009, Apogee CEO Scott Miller clarified that [...] "we've never said that Duke Nukem Forever has ceased development, [...] we released the internal team, but that doesn't correlate to the demise of the project." ...|$|E

50|$|An {{additional}} {{concern in}} English {{is that there}} are special rules for pronouns in compound subjects. Although English has morphological case distinctions in pronouns (e.g. I vs. me), grammatical case is not a living characteristic of the spoken language, and hence the case-based terms subjective case (e.g. for I) vs. objective case (e.g. for me) are misleading. In general, in the spoken language, me is the default form, but I for an argument of a verb when occurring directly before a finite verb. On the other hand, in compound subjects in informal speech, me occurs in this position, e.g. Johnny and me are coming tomorrow (possibly {{because of the lack of}} <b>direct</b> <b>agreement</b> between me and are).|$|E

In 1956 the first 60 specialists were sent to Syria, and began delivery weapons (from the fighter planes and tanks to ammunition) from Czechoslovakia with a total value of $ 18 million. At the end of the year, the Soviet Union and Syria signed first <b>direct</b> <b>agreement</b> on deliveries of weapons, jet aircraft and anti-aircraft guns, and also about the training of Syrian military personnel.

5000|$|German-Chetnik {{collaboration}} {{entered a}} new phase after the Italian surrender, because the Germans now had to police a much larger area than before and fight the Partisans {{in the whole of}} Yugoslavia. Consequently, they significantly liberalized their policy towards the Chetniks and mobilized all Serb nationalist forces against the Partisans. The 2nd Panzer Army oversaw these developments: the XV Army Corps was now officially allowed to utilize Chetniks troops and forge a [...] "local alliance". The first formal and <b>direct</b> <b>agreement</b> between the German occupation forces and the Chetniks took place in early October 1943 between the German-led 373rd (Croatian) Infantry Division and a detachment of Chetniks under Mane Rokvić operating in western Bosnia and Lika.

5000|$|In 1942, the Germans, {{helped by}} Jewish {{collaborators}} from the Żagiew network, promised to allow Jews from Warsaw holding foreign passports of neutral countries {{to leave the}} General Government for South America. Seeing {{this as an opportunity}} to save the lives of Jews in the ghettos, Jewish organizations from Switzerland started sending documents to the Warsaw Ghetto. However, in many cases, the holders of these affidavits and passports were already dead. In May 1943, after the last deportation from the Warsaw Ghetto, a network of Jewish collaborators, some of them probably in <b>direct</b> <b>agreement</b> with local Gestapo authorities, started to sell these documents to Jews who were hiding on the [...] "Aryan" [...] side of Warsaw. The Gestapo used the Hotel Polski to house the Jewish families preparing for the journey. Around 2500 people came out of their hiding places and moved to the Hotel Polski. In July 1943 they were transferred to the Vittel and Bergen-Belsen camps. On 15 July 1943, the 300 Jews remaining in the Hotel without foreign passports were executed by the Germans at Pawiak prison. The South American governments refused to recognize most of the passports. Therefore, instead of being transferred to South America, the Jews were sent to Auschwitz in May 1943 and October 1943. About 350 Jews who held Palestinian affidavits survived.|$|E

40|$|A moist coal {{adiabatic}} oven {{test has}} been used to quantify the effect of applying an anti-oxidant agent to reactive coals from Australia and the US. For the dosage rate applied, the anti-oxidant significantly reduces the coal self-heating rate and extends the time taken to reach thermal runaway by a factor of three for sub-bituminous coal and by a factor of two for the same application to high volatile C bituminous coal. The laboratory result obtained for sub-bituminous coal from Powder River Basin is in <b>direct</b> <b>agreement</b> with the practical site experience of applying the anti-oxidant product as a spontaneous combustion management control. Consequently, it is now possible to benchmark the application of the anti-oxidant to any reactive coal prior to mining as part of developing a leading practice spontaneous combustion management plan...|$|E
40|$|In two {{separate}} experiments, rats with kainic acid-induced lesions of the anteromedial (AMC) or ventrolateral (VLC) caudate nucleus {{were compared with}} controls on various discrete-trial maze and runway tasks: (a) the AMC lesion disrupted the direction but the degree of spontaneous bias in a T-maze, whereas the VLC disrupted the degree of bias but not its direction; (b) the AMC rats were impaired in the acquisition and reversal of a spatial position habit; (c) the VLC rats were impaired in runway extinction; (d) both lesion groups showed enhanced levels of activity when tested under the same conditions of food deprivation, but {{did not differ from}} controls when under free-feeding conditions. The histological analysis suggested that kainic acid does permit the selective lesioning of cell bodies in the neostriatum, whilst sparing fibres of passage.

40|$|A {{continuous}} conveyor-belt processing concept using {{microwave heating}} {{was developed and}} evaluated. Four hydrocarbon-contaminated soils were used as model feedstocks, {{and the degree of}} organic removal was assessed against the power and energy input to the process. The findings of this study at scale (150 kg/h) are in <b>direct</b> <b>agreement</b> with data obtained in batch laboratory scale experiments, and show that microwave heating processes are fundamentally scalable. It is shown that there is a trade-off between the efficiency of organic removal and the power distribution, and applying the power in a single stage was found to be 20 - 30 % more energy efficient but the overall degree of organic removal is limited to 60 %. 75 % removal was possible using two processing steps in series, but the organic removal is ultimately limited by the amount of power that can be safely and reliably delivered to the process material. The concept presented in this work is feasible when 75 % organic removal is sufficient, and could form a viable industrial-scale process based on the findings of this study...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A {{mathematical}} {{model of the}} longitudinal flexibility of a continuously welded railway track and the methodology {{for the analysis of}} the longitudinal displacement of rails under the effects of passing trains is developed to investigate the longitudinal behavior of rails. The purpose of this analysis is to explore the changes of longitudinal stress distribution in the rails due to mechanical loading applied by a travelling train. A half track system is used to derive the equations required to obtain the magnitude of deflection and force of rails and these values are scaled to produce the displacement pattern using the method of superposition. The {{mathematical model}} is translated into MATLAB and validation of the program is verified through comparisons of displacement patterns generated by a computer software LONGIN. Analysis of a straight track due to train braking was performed over a track length of 1000 m. The longitudinal displacement obtained showed that maximum longitudinal displacement occur {{in the middle of the}} track at the distance of 570 m which is in <b>direct</b> <b>agreement</b> with the published result...|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} {{an intuitive}} and semi-analytical polaron master equation approach to model pulse-driven population inversion and emitted single photons from a quantum dot exciton. The master equation theory {{allows one to}} identify important phonon-induced scattering rates analytically, and fully includes {{the role of the}} time-dependent pump field. As an application of the theory, we first study a quantum dot driven by a time-varying laser pulse on and off resonance, showing the population inversion caused by acoustic phonon emission in <b>direct</b> <b>agreement</b> with recent experiment of Quilter et al., Phys Rev Lett 114, 137401 (2015). We then model quantum dots in weakly coupled cavities and show the difference in population response between exciton-driven and cavity-driven systems. Finally, we assess the nonresonant phonon-assisted loading scheme with a quantum dot resonantly coupled to a cavity as a deterministic single photon source, and compare and contrast the important figures of merit with direct Rabi oscillation of the population using a resonant π pulse, where the latter is shown to be much more efficient...|$|E
