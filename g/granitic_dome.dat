60|$|The altered clay-slate formation, already described, is seen {{in several}} parts of the valley as far down as Las Vacas, {{underlying}} the porphyritic conglomerate. At the Casa de Pujios [L], there is a hummock of (andesitic?) granite; and the stratification of the surrounding mountains here changes from W. by S. to S.W. Again, near the R. Vacas there is a larger formation of (andesitic?) granite [M], which sends a meshwork of veins into the superincumbent clay-slate, and which locally throws off the strata, on one side to N.W. {{and on the other}} to S.E. but not at a high angle: at the junction, the clay-slate is altered into fine-grained greenstone. This granitic axis is intersected by a green dike, which I mention, because I do not remember having elsewhere seen dikes in this lowest and latest intrusive rock. From the R. Vacas to the plain of Uspallata, the valley runs N.E., so that I have had to contract my section; it runs exclusively through porphyritic rocks. As far as the Pass of Jaula, the claystone conglomerate formation, in most parts highly porphyritic, and crossed by numerous dikes of greenstone porphyry, attains a great thickness: there is also much intrusive porphyry. From the Jaula to the plain, the stratification has been in most places obliterated, except near the tops of some of the mountains; and the metamorphic action has been extremely great. In this space, the number and bulk of the intrusive masses of differently coloured porphyries, injected one into another and intersected by dikes, is truly extraordinary. I saw one mountain of whitish porphyry, from which two huge dikes, thinning out, branched DOWNWARDS into an adjoining blackish porphyry. Another hill of white porphyry, which had burst through dark- coloured strata, was itself injected by a purple, brecciated, and recemented porphyry, both being crossed by a green dike, and both having been upheaved and injected by a <b>granitic</b> <b>dome.</b> One brick-red porphyry, which above the Jaula forms an isolated mass {{in the midst of the}} porphyritic conglomerate formation, and lower down the valley a magnificent group of peaked mountains, differs remarkably from all the other porphyries. It consists of a red feldspathic base, including some rather large crystals of red feldspar, numerous large angular grains of quartz, and little bits of a soft green mineral answering in most of its characters to soapstone. The crystals of red feldspar resemble in external appearance those of orthite, though, from being partially decomposed, I was unable to measure them; and they certainly are quite unlike the variety, so abundantly met with in almost all the other rocks of this line of section, and which, wherever I tried it, cleaved like albite. This brick-red porphyry appears to have burst through all the other porphyries, and numerous red dikes traversing the neighbouring mountains have proceeded from it: in some few places, however, it was intersected by white dikes. From this posteriority of intrusive origin,--from the close general resemblance between this red porphyry and the red granite of the Portillo line, the only difference being that the feldspar here is less perfectly granular, and that soapstone replaces the mica, which is there imperfect and passes into chlorite,--and from the Portillo line a little southward of this point appearing to blend (according to Dr. Gillies) into the western ranges,--I am strongly urged to believe (as formerly remarked) that the grand mountain-masses composed of this brick-red porphyry belong to the same axis of injection with the granite of the Portillo line; if so, the injection of this porphyry probably took place, as long subsequently to the several axes of elevation in the gypseous formation near the Cumbre, as the injection of the Portillo granite has been shown to have been subsequent to the elevation of the gypseous strata composing the Peuquenes range; and this interval, we have seen, must have been a very long one.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{synthesis}} of available data on the Velay dome that include both small- and large-scale lithologic and structural mapping, strain analysis, isotope geochemistry, geochronology and pressure – temperature estimates. The Velay dome, {{one of the largest}} granite–migmatite domes of the Variscan Belt, formed during orogenic collapse at around 300 Ma. Its study allows an assessment of the thermal and geodynamic context leading to voluminous crustal anatexis of the Variscan orogenic crust. A first melting stage developed in connection with south-verging thrust zones during the Early Carboniferous, leading to a crustal thickening estimated at 20 km minimum. The involvement of fertile lithologies and the intrusion of plutons of deep origin contributed to the development of water-saturated melts. The volume of biotite granite extracted from melt during this period was limited. The second phase of melting, corresponded to generalized melting of gneiss achieved by biotite-dehydration melting reactions and accompanied by the generation of cordierite-bearing granites. At this stage, crustal-scale detachment faults were active and partially obliterated the earlier structures. The new structures were progressively tilted to the vertical at the margin of the Velay dome due to the southward and lateral ballooning of the <b>granitic</b> <b>dome.</b> The reconstructed P, T path indicate that the large volume of melt produced was a consequence of a significant increase in temperature at the onset of biotite dehydration melting.

40|$|Upper Carboniferous {{heating and}} melting {{of the middle}} orogenic crust {{associated}} with the emplacement of syntectonic granitoids are documented in the Upper Gneissic Unit of the Livradois area (central part of the French Massif Central). Crustal melting post-dates peak metamorphism conditions (800 - 625 degrees C, 10 - 8 kb) dated at 360 +/- 4 Ma (U-Th-Pb on monazite). The P-T evolution of the metamorphic series indicates that Barrovian metamorphism {{was followed by a}} decompression (from 10 +/- 1 kbar to 6 +/- 1 kbar) associated with either a decrease in temperature {{in the southern part of}} the series or with an increase in temperature (of about 150 degrees C) in the northern part of the series. This evolution records the first step of the exhumation of the series coeval with granitoids intrusion, of which the emplacements were dated at 315 +/- 4 and 311 +/- 18 Ma (U-Pb on zircon). The final stage of the exhumation is associated with an isobaric cooling of the whole series. Similarity of Ar- 40 /Ar- 39 ages for biotite in the paragneisses (307 - 300 Ma) and K-feldspar in the granitoids (306 - 300 Ma) document rapid cooling for this stage.

40|$|In SE China, a Mesozoic <b>granitic</b> <b>dome</b> coeval to extensional {{tectonics}} {{is exposed}} in the Wugongshan massif. Its center {{is occupied by}} Mesozoic granitoids and granitic gneisses, and the E–W-trending Late-Paleozoic–Mesozoic Pingxiang and Anfu basins are located along its northern and southern sides, respectively. In this paper, the petrological, geochemical (major, incompatible, and rare earth elements) and isotopic characteristics of the granitoids and granitic gneisses of this dome allow us to constrain their geodynamic evolution. The Wugongshan Mesozoic K-feldspar-enriched granitoids consist of six granitic bodies and lie within a Paleozoic metamorphic basement. The Caledonian Shanzhuang granodiorite, containing some dioritic enclaves, occurs {{in the study area}} and is a calc-alkaline type granodiorite characterised by lower SiO 2 and composed of andesine, biotite, quartz, hornblende, magnetite and sphene. The Mesozoic granitoids, either Indosinian plutons or Yanshanian bodies, show a geochemical affinity of peraluminous S-type granite, having higher SiO 2, K 2 O contents, Al>K+Na+ 2 Ca, enriched in Rb, Th and depleted in Eu. They also exhibit LREE-enriched patterns and marked negative Eu anomalies. The Yanshanian plutons also contain characteristic minerals such as sillimanite, garnet and monazite. The Wugongshan Mesozoic granitoids have higher ISr values (0. 70981 – 0. 72885) and lower var epsilonNd(T) (− 10. 6 to − 14. 7; an average of − 12. 6) than those of the early Paleozoic Shanzhuang granodiorite. The Mesozoic granitoids were likely derived from ancient sedimentary rocks by partial melting. The Wugongshan Mesozoic granitoids contain three petrological zones, that is, an Early Cretaceous massive granitic zone in the core (Zone I), a foliated granitic zone (Zone II) and a Triassic granitic gneissic zone in the outer-rim (Zone III). The petrological and geochemical features of massive granitoids (Zone I) {{are similar to those of}} foliated granites (Zone II) and of granitic gneisses (Zone III) in this Mesozoic dome. Moreover, geometric and kinematic features within the ductile parts (Units 2 and 3) are also similar to those within the brittle part (Unit 1) of the dome. All these features show that the geologic evolution of the Wugongshan doming is a continuous process lasting from Triassic to Early Cretaceous time. Published 40 Ar/ 39 Ar and K–Ar ages in the Wugongshan Mesozoic granitic rocks fall into two major age fields, corresponding to two geodynamic events of intracontinental deformation and magmatic activity. The first tectonothermal event, dated at 226 – 259 Ma on the granitic gneisses in the outer-rim of dome, can be linked to Indosinian collision between the South China plate and the North China plate during Triassic time. The second event took place during the Early Yanshanian, dated at 180 – 120 Ma on the granites of the core of dome, and are responsible for final doming of the Wugongshan plutons. This event may be related to a westward subduction of the Paleo-Pacific oceanic plate under the SE-China continent during Late Jurassic–Early Cretaceous time...|$|E

40|$|Irregular {{patches of}} Archaean hypersthene-bearing granulites, widely ranging in size, are common {{throughout}} the Wheat Belt of southwestern Australia (60000 km 2) {{which is now}} composed dominantly of biotite or hornblende gneisses intruded by large coarse 2600 MA grey <b>granitic</b> <b>domes.</b> Some of the granulites were Archaean sediments, volcanic rocks (both mafic and silicic) and highly magnesian ultramafic rocks, whereas some large areas appear to be older Archaean basement now converted to dark greasy rocks like the silicic charnockites of India. Although some mafic granulites are strongly lineated and some silicic granulites show well-developed platy quartz grains, most granulites exhibit ill-defined linear elements, and present the appearance of having suffered thermal metamorphism rather than strong deformation. Cordierite, sillimanite, spinel and olivine are common in rocks of appropriate composition, but kyanite and high pressure clinopyroxene-garnet assemblages are unknown. Linear belts of granulites, which yield Proterozoic ages by Rb-Sr methods, engirdle on three sides the Archaean block of the Wheat Belt and adjoining greenstones to the east. The Fraser Block (8000 km 2), separated from the Archaean by an extensive mylonite zone and intense Bouguer gravity anomaly, is dominated by anhydrous mafic granulites of higher pressure than the Archaean granulites of the Wheat Belt, The mafic granulites were basic lavas and small intrusives of continental tholeiite type set within an intracratonic linear zone, and metamorphosed at 1338 MA (Rb-Sr). In the Musgrave Ranges silicic and mafic granulites were formed at about 1380 MA, and are of both anhydrous and hydrous types, and range from low to intermediate granulites. These granulites are intruded by large bodies of "magmatic" charnockitic adamellite at about 1130 MA. Older silicic and mafic granulites (1860 MA) appear in the Strangways Range within the Arunta Block, and in places have recorded a second granulite event at c. 1470 MA. Archaean basement {{has not yet been}} recognised within the Arunta Block, and the granulites form imbricate thrust slices of deep-seated igneous and sedimentary rocks. Major and trace element and REE studies reveal a close correspondence of the mafic granulites of the Fraser Range to continental tholeiites, whereas those of both the Musgrave and Strangways Ranges mostly show island arc or oceanic tholeiitic characters. Element mobility during granulite facies metamorphism was Strongly controlled by thermal and fluid gradients. Large increase in total pressure but at approximately constant temperature produced no significant element mobility in dry mafic granulites along 100 km traverse in the Fraser Range, and U and Th values are not correlated with metamorphic grade. In the Musgrave Ranges, where granulite hornblende and biotite are common, Th, U, Rb, Ni and Co were depleted with increase of both total pressure and temperature, whereas Ba, Sr, REE, Na, Ca and P were enriched. Elements showing less than 20 % change are Si, Al, Mn, Ca, K, Zn, Cr, Y, Nb, Fe 3, Fe 2, Mg, Ti, Zr, V and Pb. In the aureole of a large charnockitic intrusive pluton where F was active there is a marked increase in U, Th and Rb, but a depletion of Zr and Ti, two elements normally considered immobile elements. Silicic granulites in all three terrains show depletion, with increase of grade, of U, Th and Rb and increase with K/Rb, as noted in several Archaean shields. In view of the varying influence of partial pressures of the fluids, and temperature, complications of polymetamorphism, and differing tectonic setting of many terrains, significant chemical differences cannot yet be recognised between Archaean and Proterozoic granulites...|$|R
40|$|Cima Dome, {{a remarkably}} smooth {{symmetrical}} alluvium-fringed rock dome {{in the desert}} of southeastern California, is the prototype of Davis' <b>granitic</b> desert <b>dome,</b> supposedly convex and presumably developed by backwearing of a granitic fault block. Transit-stadia profiles across Cima Dome show concave or essentially straight slopes and demonstrate {{that it is not}} convex except to a slight degree in the uppermost 25 feet. Geophysical explorations by resistivity, gravity, and seismic methods on the southeastern flank reveal no boundary fault or any form unequivocably identifiable as the convex suballuvial bench deduced by Lawson. At its deepest point the granitic rock floor is buried by 1300 feet of overburden composed of 550 feet of alluvium, or geophysically comparable material, and 650 feet of more coherent rock, presumably welded rhyolitic tuff. Cima Dome is primarily a regraded part of an extensive late Pliocene-early Pleistocene erosion surface, Hewett's Ivanpah upland, now buried by Pleistocene volcanic rocks immediately to the west. The dome may be an erosion residual on that surface or it may have been created largely by subsequent deformation, primarily warping. Evidence cited favors the warping hypothesis. The present profile of Cima Dome is due to erosion and regrading in the current cycle, and in most places the smoothness of slope and the symmetry are due to uniform debris yielded by granular disintegration of homogeneous quartz monzonite composing the dome. The relations at Cima Dome and elsewhere suggest that the role of recent warping merits consideration with regard to the origin of closed basins, broad divides, disintegrated drainages, areas of dissection and related landscape features in the desert of southeastern California...|$|R
2500|$|The Yule Marble is a {{metamorphic}} facies of the regionally distributed Leadville Limestone of Mississippian age deposited 350 million to 324 million years ago.

40|$|International audienceA {{microstructural}} and metamorphic {{study of}} a naturally deformed medium- to high-pressure <b>granitic</b> orthogneiss (OrlicaSnieznik <b>dome,</b> Bohemian Massif) provides evidence of behaviour of the felsic crust during progressive burial along a subduction-type apparent thermal gradient (similar to 10 degrees C km- 1). The granitic orthogneisses develops three distinct microstructural types, as follows: type I augen orthogneiss, type II banded orthogneiss and type III mylonitic orthogneiss, each representing an evolutionary stage of a progressively deformed granite. Type I orthogneiss is composed of partially recrystallized K-feldspar porphyroclasts surrounded by wide fronts of myrmekite, fully recrystallized quartz aggregates and interconnected monomineralic layers of recrystallized plagioclase. Compositional layering in the type II orthogneiss is defined by plagioclase- and K-feldspar-rich layers, both of which show an increasing proportion of interstitial minerals, {{as well as the}} deformation of recrystallized myrmekite fronts. Type III orthogneiss shows relicts of quartz and K-feldspar ribbons preserved in a fine-grained polymineralic matrix. All three types have the same assemblage (quartz + plagioclase + K-feldspar + muscovite + biotite + garnet + sphene +/- ilmenite), but show systematic variations in the composition of muscovite and garnet from types I to III. This is consistent with the equilibration of the three types at different positions along a prograde P-T path ranging from 700 degrees C (types II and III orthogneisses). The deformation types thus do not represent evolutionary stages of a highly partitioned deformation at constant P-T conditions, but reflect progressive formation during the burial of the continental crust. The microstructures of the type I and type II orthogneisses result from the dislocation creep of quartz and K-feldspar whereas a grain boundary sliding-dominated diffusion creep regime is the characteristic of the type III orthogneiss. Strain weakening related to the transition from type I to type II microstructures was enhanced by the recrystallization of wide myrmekite fronts, and plagioclase and quartz, and further weakening and strain localization in type III orthogneiss occurred via grain boundary sliding-enhanced diffusion creep. The potential role of incipient melting in strain localization is discussed...|$|R
