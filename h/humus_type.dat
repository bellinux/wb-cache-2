40|$|Duchaufour {{has noted}} the {{relation}} between forest humus typesand natural regeneration of Fir in the Vosges : on the biologicallyactive humus of the Mull acide type, which maintain a high levelof fertility {{for the growth of}} adult trees, barely any seedlings areencountered, although they abund on the slowly decomposing humusof the Model,- or Mor types. Investigation of this phenomenonemphasized the decisive rôle played by the moss carpet which, byprotecting Moder and Mor against intense evaporation, maintainsthe humidity required by the growing seedlings; on the contrary,Hull humus are either bare or covered with a herbaceous florawhich dries up the zone occupied by the roots of the young seedlings. Investigation pursued at the Soils Laboratory of the Ecole Nationaledes Eaux et Forêts, has shown that the Mull of the Vosgesforests already highly permeable to water because of its coarsestructure, may loose through drought and changes in the state ofits colloidal components, the capacity to absorb summer rainfallwhich then infiltrates at a rate four-times that prevailing in thespring. The soil colloids seem to recuperate slowly during autumnor winter their initial water-holding capacity. However, the few Fir seedlings that were found in the Hullhumus possessed peculiar characteristics of atrophy and necrosisin their root system. As these symptoms seemed evidence for toxicityof some nature, it appeared logical to investigate the activityof antiphytotic substances. Laboratory cultures of seedlings in the various <b>humus</b> <b>types,</b> wateredwith aqueous extracts of these same humus, did not revealany toxic activity of the Mull as long as the humidity of the culturemedia remained high; but upon lowering the moisture contentof the humus, the necrosis of the roots already noted in the fieldstarted to appear and was followed by the death of the seedlings. The hypothesis of intoxication by water-soluble antiphytotic substanceshad therefore to be abandoned, since their activity should undoubtedlyhave increased {{as a consequence of the}} higher concentrationsarising from the extract-waterings. Chemical investigation of the soil revealed that a very largeamount of manganese, — particularly in its di-valent form availahle to plants, — was present in the toxic humus layer, even whenthis element was only found as traces in the sub-soil. The enrichmentis brought about by the adult trees which concentrate in theirfoliage the Manganese obtained by the deeper roots from the soil. The quantity of manganese in the various <b>humus</b> <b>types,</b> whenexpressed on a weight basis is already noticeably higher in Mullthan in Moder and Mor.

In addition to soils exposed in their sites of origin, replicate units containing labelled material were translocated {{in a cascade}} sequence southwards along the transect, to simulate the effects of climate warming on decomposition processes. The current Atlantic climate represented the most favourable soil temperature and moisture conditions for decomposition. Northward this climatic zone, where the soil processes are essentially temperature-limited, the prediction for a temperature increase of 3 degrees C estimated a probable increase of C mineralisation by 20 - 25 % for the boreal zone and 10 % for the cool temperate zone. Southward the cool Atlantic climate zone, (the Mediterranean climate), where the processes are seasonally moisture-limited, the predicted increase of temperature by 1 - 2 degrees C little affected the soil organic matter dynamics, because of the higher water deficit.

Site locations comprised {{a mixture of}} both grassland (5 sites) and oak tree dominated (2 sites) areas. Geographically, sites were either low lying or on adjacent elevated ground. Across the transect, a severe gradient of metal concentrations was found with highest values for organic soil horizons from close to the factory. Comparisons with quality standards indicate that these metal levels {{are likely to be}} a major ecological stressor. In addition to the strong metal gradient, a number of other between site differences were also observed.

The pre-humus complexes are dispersed, and the nearest to certinoriginal constituents of the vegetal tissues, and not easily decomposed. As they are soluble in the acetyl bromide, different inthat from the true humic acids, it was possible to appreciate themattantitatively. The a complexes (brown humic acids) are still lightly coloured andloosely tied to clay.

The b complexes (grey humic acids) are much darker and closelytied to clay. They can be ext-acted by dilute soda only when clayis completely dispersed, consequently in the absence of KC 1.

40|$|The {{degree of}} mixing {{of organic matter}} with {{minerals}} in organic and hemi-organic horizons of forest soils largely differs between humus types. As clay minerals might control the mobility of radiocesium in these forest floor horizons, plant contamination could greatly vary {{with the kind of}} humus. We measured the mobility of radiocesium in the upper O, OAh and Ah horizons of three acid forest soils with three distinct humus types: eumoder, dysmoder and fibrimor. We used two different approaches: a physico-chemical test quantifying the radiocesium interception potential (RIP) and a biological assay simulating an experimental rhizosphere. The results show that the (137) Cs horizon-to-plant transfer is directly governed by RIP, and thus by frayed edge sites born by weathered micaceous minerals. The inverse relationship between RIP and organic matter content indicates that in the three sites investigated the mixing of organic residues with Cs-fixing minerals is a key process in 137 Cs mobility. These Cs-fixing clay minerals indeed decrease in the sequence eumoder > dysmoder > fibrimor because they are more diluted in forest floor with less bioturbation. Our results suggest that <b>humus</b> <b>type</b> might be an important parameter in classifying forest soils with respect to their ability to transfer radiocesium to the above standing vegetation...|$|E
40|$|Soil protists play {{fundamental}} {{roles in}} many earth system processes, yet we {{are only beginning to}} understand the true diversity of the organisms involved. In this study we used conventional (microscopy-based) methods to characterise the diversity and estimate protist population sizes in soils from a variety of distinct habitats within Mere Sands Wood nature reserve in NW England. We produced population size data for over ninety soil protists belonging to two major eukaryotic functional groups: testate amoebae (TA) and diatoms, adding substantial ‘cryptic diversity’ to the nature reserves recorded biota. From these population size data we estimated relative contributions of TA and diatoms to soil biogenic silicon (BSi) pools and found significant correlations between taxon richness and the TA and diatom Si pool. This could indicate that protist functional diversity can influence terrestrial BSi pools, especially in early successional plant communities where TA and diatoms can potentially increase Si mineralisation and/or create Si ‘hot spots’ and hence, the biological availability of this element for subsequent plant uptake. TA were particularly abundant in mor <b>humus</b> <b>type</b> soils further supporting the idea that they could be important players in nutrient cycling in such soils. Overall, we demonstrate this is a useful approach in order to start to attempt to estimate the role of protists in the Si cycle and other ecological processes...|$|E

In acid soils derived from loess, this process has been diagnosed mainly by morphological observation. We investigated this process in a toposequence of Luvisols and Cambisols on loess using selective extraction and mineralogical data as well as characteristics of the leaf litter. The <b>humus</b> <b>type</b> (O and OAh horizons) is a moder in the three Luvisols and one of the Cambisols, whereas it is a fibrimor in the two other Cambisols. The contents in total alkaline and alkaline-earth cations range from 35 to 60 cmol(c) kg(- 1) in the fibrimor and from 40 to 90 cmol(c) kg(- 1) in the moder humus. In the two Cambisols with fibrimor smectite occurs in the clay fraction of the Ah horizon; Fe-humus complexes seem to have moved, but no more than 9 cm, from the Ah to the AB horizon beneath. Relative to the Ah horizon, {{the upper part of the}} AB has larger tetraborate-extractable Fe/Al ratio and optical density of the oxalate extract. Such features converge to diagnose surface podzolization in the Cambisols with fibrimor. However, they were not detected in the Cambisol and Luvisols with moder.

However, {{its role in}} terrestrial nutrient and carbon cycles is less studied, in particular in central Europe. We analysed the decay process of spruce Picea abies (L.) Karst., the most common tree species in Switzerland. The aims were: (i) to examine the usefulness of ultrasonic wave measurements for characterising of decay processes; (ii) to assess changes in physical and chemical variables of CWD during the decay process in relation to site-specific humus forms. We analysed 25 logs, five per decomposition class within a five-class system, for their density, moisture, C, N and P contents, lignin and cellulose. We also applied ultrasonic measurements to the radial axis of decaying logs using the Sylvatest-Duo ® tool. In addition, we described eight soil profiles below the sampled logs and analysed the soil samples for total C, N and P and water pH. All the soils sampled were classified as humiferous Brunisol (eutric Cambisol) with various <b>humus</b> <b>types.</b> The propagation speed of ultrasonic waves {{was found to be}} directly proportional to the average tree density and inversely proportional to C content. These preliminary results point out the potential usefulness of this technique for further studies of wood decay. Wood density was found to decrease during wood decay (434 – 308 mg g− 1), whereas moisture increased (94 – 258 %). Carbon and lignin concentrations remained stable, while N and P contents both increased between classes 3 and 5 (N: 0. 41 – 1. 26 mg g− 1 and P: 0. 01 – 0. 06 mg g − 1). These general decay patterns are in accordance with previous studies of other tree species and of P. abies in other geographic regions. However, we did find some site-specific patterns, e. g. N and P were lower and wood density declined less than in other studies. Climatic factors at the study site slow down biological activity and they also seem to explain the morphology of the humus forms and their variations. We found no concordance between the humus morphology and the wood-decay state. We recommend performing long-term experiments in Central European forests to investigate the different factors that may influence CWD decomposition, such as edaphic and climatic conditions, in a controlled way...|$|R
40|$|Forest {{restoration}} in protected exclosures {{has become}} a common practice to fight land degradation in the highlands of northern Ethiopia. Insights into ecosystem processes governing restoration in these formerly degraded areas are gained through the study of humus forms and factors influencing humus formation during vegetation recovery. Humus forms of 135 sample plots located in different land use types were morphologically described. The subsequent classification into six <b>humus</b> form <b>types</b> was based on principal component analysis and cluster analysis. Where areas are closed for a longer time, humus profiles are commonly more developed and higher organic matter accumulation is noticed as well as increased nutrient stocks. The combined effects of seasonal drought conditions and low fresh litter quality account for an overall slow decomposition, which explains the high importance of litter input for organic matter accumulation. Based on a correlation analysis, vegetation cover, litter production, litter quality, soil nutrient content, soil moisture, and topography were identified as important factors influencing humus formation.

Moreover, this podzolic tendancy is confirmed by the weathering patterns of the clay minerals in the A 1 (B) horizons developed under spruces, i. e. a more pronouced weathering of chloritic layers than those observed in the beechwood soil, with a correlative genesis of more abundant smectite-like minerals.

Numerical size of populations was estimated using two sampling methods, i. e. extraction from soil samples (abundances) and pitfall trapping (activities). Although a quite good relationship was registered between abundances and activities estimated in spring and autumn, pitfall efficiency greatly depended on the taxa concerned. Multiple multivariate regression analysis and canonical correspondence analysis were used to study spatial community structure. The most significant variables influencing the distribution of species are: (1) available water in the Ah layer correlated with C/N ratio of the litter layer (related to both the litter structure and humus type); (2) the textural soil conditions (silt content); and (3) the local biogeographical structure. Mull species are essentially macrosaprophagous taxa belonging to ''bulldozer'' and ''roller'' ecomorphological types or small hypogeic species able to resist summer drought whereas microsaprophagous epigeic taxa with high water requirement are linked to moder soils. Finally, the results are discussed in keeping with regard to the patchiness concept and the local edaphic and floristic conditions...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} the nitrogen source for main taxa of soil fauna in two beech forests of contrasted <b>humus</b> <b>type</b> using 15 N-labelled beech litter and 15 N analysis of soil fauna. 15 N-labelled beech litter was deposited on the topsoil in December 2000 in four stands {{of different ages}} at Leinefelde (Germany) with mull humus and in one mature stand at Sorø (Denmark) with moder humus. The fate of the tracer isotope was measured in litter and soil, {{as well as in}} the soil fauna, and for each taxa, we calculated the proportion of N in the animal derived from the labelled substrate. Of the original N contained in the litter, 20 % to 41 % was lost after 9 months at Leinefelde, and only 10 % at Sorø. This loss was counterbalanced by the incorporation of 24 % to 31 % external N at Leinefelde, and 31 % at Sorø, partly originating from fungal colonisation of the added litter. The proportion of N assimilated from the labelled litter by the different soil animals varied in relation to their mobility and feeding preferences. Large and mobile soil animals, especially predators, derived on average less 15 N because they were also able to feed outside the labelled litter boxes. Detritivores assimilated at most 15 % of their nitrogen content at Leinefelde and 11 % at Sorø from the decomposing labelled litter. The most labelled taxa at Leinefelde were small fungivorous and coprophagous species, mainly isotomid Collembola such as Isotomiella and Folsomia. A...|$|E
40|$|Gap {{formation}} affects {{environmental conditions}} in forest ecosystems. In this study, {{the effect of}} forest gap on humus form in a mixed Fagus orientalis Lipsky (Oriental Beech) forest was investigated by comparing the humus forms found in gaps with those {{in parts of the}} stand with closed canopies in a temperate mixed forest in northern Iran. In total, 32 gaps were selected from which 160 humus profiles were considered within gaps, and a further 160 within adjacent closed canopies. In each profile, humus forms were determined based on their morphological characteristics. Results indicated that gap significantly affected humus forms. The humus forms in gaps differed significantly from those in adjacent areas of closed stand. Mull order <b>type</b> <b>humus</b> was the most commonly found in the study site (70 % of all profiles). The results also showed that forest floor thickness was lower in gaps than in adjacent closed areas. The suborder eumull was the most common in gaps, whereas dysmull was found to be the most common within closed areas...|$|R
40|$|The {{fate and}} {{transport}} of insoluble, hydrophobic organic pollutants in the aquatic environment constitutes a prominent area of concern. It {{is thought that}} pollutants of this nature may exist in association with organic carbon, which is predominantly aquatic <b>humus.</b> This <b>type</b> of association could significantly affect the kinetics of such transformation processes as volatilization or chemical and biological degradation of the pollutant. While dissolved organic matter (DOM) comprises the bulk of organic carbon (or aquatic humus) in natural waters, the interaction between naturally occurring DOM and insoluble organic pollutants has not been quantified. The work presented in this dissertation {{is an effort to}} quantify the effect of dissolved organic matter on the solubility in water and, hence, the transport of hydrophobic organic compounds (specifically, DDT) in the environment. Saturated aqueous solutions of DDT were generated by a method that is different from those used by other workers. Within a closed system, an excess of solid DDT was allowed to vaporize and enter an aqueous solution through the gas phase. The concentration of DDT in solution increased with time, leveling off when equilibrium and a saturated solution was established. The solubility of p,p 2 ̆ 7 -DDT in distilled water was determined to be 1. 87 (+OR-). 01 ppb. The solubility of the o,p 2 ̆ 7 -DDT isomer in distilled water was determined to be 4. 88 (+OR-). 03 ppb. The concentrations of p,p 2 ̆ 7 -DDT and o,p 2 ̆ 7 -DDT in distilled water solutions containing dissolved organic matter were definitely higher than the aqueous solubilities of these compounds. A minimum value for the DDT/DOM partition coefficient (K(,p)) in water was determined. This partition coefficient, when normalized to organic carbon, is referred to as K(,oc) (K(,oc) = K(,p) /fraction organic carbon). A minimum log K(,oc) for both p,p 2 ̆ 7 -DDT and o,p 2 ̆ 7 -DDT was determined to be 4. 7 (+OR-). 2 log units. Under environmental conditions, this partition coefficient indicates that the majority of DDT present in aqueous systems will be associated with dissolved organic matter...|$|R

The humus forms have been classified using two different approaches: the French one (Brethes et al. 1995, AFES-INRA 1998) and the Canadian one (Klinka et al. 1981, Green et al. 1993). In 8 representative soilscapes 28 humus forms surveys were carried out to correlate <b>humus</b> to the <b>type</b> of vegetation. Has been developed general proposal on distribution and variability of humus forms in explored mountains and hillys of the Lombardy areas in relation to environmental factors. This approach allowed us to single out, in a preliminary way, the characterization of humus forms on some sites of the mountain land of Lombardy. The humus forms shows more variability on the hilly sites (350 - 600 m a. s. l.), with no dominant form. The Mulls forms, Vermimull and Rhizomull (Green et al. 1993) are more present in open enviorments on mountain and premountain landscapes (grass/graze lands). The Rhizomull are also present in the subalpine belt (1200 - 1900 m a. s. l.) and on grassland in the mountain belt (1200 - 1900 m a. s. l.). Mormoders forms (Green et al. 1993) appear from 500 to 950 m a. s. l. (in the premountain belt). At high altitudes (mountain belt) in forest envoiroments or where there was a forest onetime, the Mors while Humimors (Green et al. 1993) are predominant...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} of infrared spectroscopy to establish differences {{in terms of}} the environmental factors on the humification processes has been assessed on Mediterranean forest soils from Central Spain developed under sclerophyllic and gymnosperm vegetation. Humic acids were isolated from 21 soil samples differing in terms of vegetation (pine, holm oak, oak), geological substrate (granite, limestone), soil type (Humic Dystrudepts, Humic Dystroxerepts, Humic Haploxerepts, Calcic Argixerolls), soil horizon (O, A 1, A 2), <b>humus</b> <b>type</b> (calcic mull, mesotrophic-acid mull, moder), physiographic unit (hillside, moorland, ramp), altitudinal step, epipedon (mollic or umbric) and moisture regimen (udic or xeric), which were used as environmental classification factors. Quantitative peak intensity data were obtained from the second derivative infrared spectra of the humic acids. Discriminant analysis with automatic variable backward selection was used to identify the infrared bands showing more systematic changes in their intensities depending on the above classification factors. The diagnostic infrared bands chosen were at 1720, 1260 and 1330 cm- 1, corresponding mainly to carboxyl and lignin-derived O-containing functional groups. The bands at 2920 and 1510 cm- 1, corresponding to aliphatic and aromatic structures of the carbon backbone, respectively, were not significantly responsive to the environmental variability in the studied samples. The results showed how, in the scenario under study, taking advantage of the relative intensities of specific peaks from the second derivative infrared spectra, it is possible to discriminate different soil Suborders and humus types, as well as between several physiographic and bioclimatic features. © 2010 Elsevier B.

40|$|The {{characteristics}} {{of both the}} mineral substrate and the humus layer are of key importance in podzol formation. However, {{the properties of the}} forest floor leachates are seldom considered. We measured the complexation capacity by Cu 2 + titration (CuCC), the optical density (E- 4 /E- 6), as well as the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and of major and trace ions in the liquid extracts of forest floors of two Cambisols and two Luvisols on loess under deciduous forest. The vegetation consists of a mixture of beech, oak and maple. The <b>humus</b> <b>type</b> is a fibrimor in one Cambisol and a moder in the three other soils. Both in the solid phase and in the liquid extracts of the forest floors, the Si/(Al + Fe) and C/(Al + Fe) atomic ratios are much larger in the fibrimor than in the moders. In the liquid extracts, the complexation capacity (CuCC) and the density of metal binding sites (CuCC/DOC are larger in the fibrimor than in the moders. These large CuCC and CuCC/DOC in the fibrimor leachate are linked with relatively small stability constant of the humus-Cu complex and relatively large E- 4 /E- 6 ratio, i. e. with reactive organic ligands with low molecular weight and weak aromatic character. These characteristics are associated with current incipient podzolization in the Cambisol with a fibrimor, and might be considered as an indicator of a substantial podzolizing potential of the forest floor.

40|$|A multi-site and multi-age set of in situ 15 N-labelled litter {{decomposition}} experiments {{was carried}} out in various European beech forests. The sites presented contrasted situations of climate and <b>humus</b> <b>type</b> that were representative of northern Europe temperate forests. 15 N-labelled leaf litter was produced by urea spraying in an experimental beech plot, and was used in litter decomposition experiments over a 3 – 6 -year period, depending on the site. Schemes of decomposition covered a wide range of situations, some of them not expected, like high decay rate on Moder humus forms or slow decomposition on Mull humus form. The objectives of this study were to determine how nitrogen release and/or incorporation rates could characterize litter decomposition dynamics. A carbon and nitrogen coupled model of decomposition based on the quality theory was used to fit the given data. High correlation coefficients and unbiased fitting were obtained both for carbon (R 2 = 0. 96, p≤ 0. 0001, n = 392) and nitrogen (R 2 = 0. 86,p ≤ 0. 0001, n = 367). The theoretical concept of quality was somewhat lightened and related to decomposer activity: low rates of quality decrease were associated with high decomposition rates, showing that when decomposers are sufficiently supplied with labile carbon from the humus they decompose litter more completely than when they are carbon limited. Provided that the degrading substrate stoichiometry was kept constant (i. e. C loss / N loss ratio), the same litter decomposition could be processed at different rates. Taking seasonal variations of the parameters into account is likely to improve our understanding, but further experiments at more frequent intervals are neede...|$|E

In this study an innovative integrated approach based on soil/humus {{and vegetation}} was used in order to detect the habitats quality and to test the relationship between vegetation and <b>humus</b> forms. This <b>type</b> of relationship, in fact, has never been investigated in the mediterranean region of Italy. 65 phytosociological relevés and humus profiles were {{carried out in the}} same sampling sites. Ellenberg’s indicator values were used to test the relationships between vegetation and humus; in particular, the product R*N, corresponding to the aggregation of the two indica- tors R-pH and N-nutrients; this index, is considered linked to humus quality and function- ality, was applied {{for the first time to}} a mediterranean data set. A matrix of 178 plant species x 65 relevés was subjected to statistical multivariate treat- ment by the procedure of Cluster Analysis; the Spearman’s rank correlation test was used to verify the correlations between indicators and measured humus/soil parameters (i. e. pH, content of carbon). The humus forms are related with the index of humus quality R*N and were classified into three main categories: mull with elevated functionality, exclusive of the most meso- hygrophilous woodlands, moder with intermediate functionality, mainly present in the decid- uous oak woodlands, amphi with low functionality in the evergreen sclerophyllous wood- lands. In the more disturbed habitats the humus forms show a mosaic pattern, in corre- spondence with a very low diversity of the understorey flora. horizons.

40|$|The {{vertical}} distribution of {{soil organic matter}} (SOM) in the profile may constitute a significant factor for soil carbon cycling. However, {{the formation of the}} SOM profile is currently poorly understood due to equifinality, caused by the entanglement of several processes: input from roots, mixing due to bioturbation, and organic matter leaching. In this study we quantified the contribution of these three processes using Bayesian parameter estimation for the mechanistic SOM profile model SOMPROF. Based on organic carbon measurements, 13 parameters related to decomposition and transport of organic matter were estimated for two temperature forest soils: an Arenosol with a mor humus form (Loobos, The Netherlands), and a Cambisol with mull <b>type</b> <b>humus</b> (Hainich, Germany). Furthermore, the use of the radioisotope 210 Pbex as tracer for vertical SOM transport was studied. For Loobos the calibration results demonstrate the importance of liquid phase transport for shaping the vertical SOM profile, while the effects of bioturbation are generally negligible. These results are in good agreement with expectations given in situ conditions. For Hainich the calibration offered three distinct explanations for the observations (three modes in the posterior distribution). With the addition of 210 Pbex data and prior knowledge, as well as additional information about in situ conditions, we were able to identify the most likely explanation, which identified root litter input as the dominant process for the SOM profile. For both sites the organic matter appears to comprise mainly adsorbed but potentially leachable material, pointing to the importance of organo-mineral interactions. Furthermore, organic matter in the mineral soil appears to be mainly derived from root litter, supporting previous studies that highlighted the importance of root input for soil carbon sequestration. The 210 Pbex measurements added only slight additional constraint on the estimated parameters. However, with sufficient replicate measurements and possibly in combination with other tracers, this isotope may still hold value as tracer for a SOM transport...|$|R
40|$|Geographic Information Systems (GIS) used {{in concert}} with {{statistical}} and geostatistical software provide the geologist with {{a powerful tool for}} processing, visualizing and analysing geoscience data for mineral exploration applications. This thesis focuses on different methods for analysing, visualizing and integrating geochemical data sampled from various media (rock, till, soil, <b>humus),</b> with other <b>types</b> of geoscience data. Different methods for defining geochemical anomalies and separating geochemical anomalies due to mineralization from other lithologic or surficial factors (i. e. true from false anomalies) are investigated. With respect to lithogeochemical data, this includes methods to distinguish between altered and un-altered samples, methods (normalization) for identifying lithologic from mineralization effects, and various statistical and visual methods for identifying anomalous geochemical concentrations from background. With respect to surficial geochemical data, methods for identifying bedrock signatures, and scavenging effects are presented. In addition, a new algorithm, the dispersal train identification algorithm (DTIA), is presented which broadly helps to identify and characterize anisotropies in till data due to glacial dispersion and more specifically identifies potential dispersal trains using a number of statistical parameters. The issue of interpolation of geochemical data is addressed and methods for determining whether geochemical data should or should not be interpolated are presented. New methods for visualizing geochemical data using red-green-blue (RGB) ternary displays are illustrated. Finally data techniques for integrating geochemical data with other geoscience data to produce mineral prospectivity maps are demonstrated. Both data and knowledge-driven GIS modeling methodologies are used (and compared) for producing prospectivity maps. New ways of preparing geochemical data for input to modeling are demonstrated with the aim of getting the most out of your data for mineral exploration purposes. Processing geochemical data by sub-populations, either by geographic unit (i. e., lithology) or by geochemical classification and alteration style was useful for better identification of geochemical anomalies, with respect to background, and for assessing varying alteration styles. Normal probability plots of geochemical concentrations based on spatial (lithologic) divisions and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were found to be particularly useful for identifying geochemical anomalies and for identifying associations between major oxide elements that in turn reflect different alteration styles.
