5|$|The band began {{production}} on Parachutes in late 1999, after producing & releasing The Blue Room EP with British record producer Chris Allison. Allison {{was asked to}} assist with production, and the band's musical direction, which was desired by both the band & the A department. Production started with the track 'High Speed', {{which was part of}} the EP and was later re-released as a part of Parachutes. Allison describes 'High Speed' as thus: 'You'll notice it is quite a bit different to the other tracks, because there are other sounds going on in it: we wanted to mix a soundscape in with the classic rock sound on that particular track. I thought 'High Speed' was a really good marriage between the classic rock sound and the new sound that was developing out of <b>it,</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> was more atmospheric'. Seven tracks in all were recorded during the sessions at Orinoco studios in London, with three of them ending up on The Blue Room EP.|$|E

25|$|The end of 1912 saw {{the end of}} a year of {{political}} struggle for Law. As well as the problem of Home Rule, there were internal party struggles; supporters of the Church of England or military reform lambasted Law for not paying attention to their causes, and tariff reformers argued with him over his previous compromise on food duties. Despite this, most Conservatives realised that as a fighting leader, Law could not be bettered. The results of by-elections throughout 1913 continued to favour them, but progress on the Home Rule Bill was less encouraging; on 7 July it was again passed by the Commons, and again rejected by the Lords on 15 July. Parliament rose for the summer recess on 15 August, and Law and the Unionists spent the summer trying to convince the King to voice an opinion on the issue. Their first suggestion was that he should withhold the Royal Assent on <b>it,</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> horrified Law's constitutional law adviser A.V. Dicey. The second was more reasonable– they argued that the Liberals had put the King in an impossible position by asking him to ratify a bill that would infuriate half of the population. His only option was to write a memo to Asquith saying this and requesting that the problem of home rule be put to the electorate via a general election. After thinking on this, the King agreed, and handed a note to Asquith on 11 August requesting either an election or an all-party conference.|$|E

However, Carey gave Daily News a few more details {{regarding}} the project, saying, [...] "Since I recorded the Christmas album, I've always wanted to make a movie to go with <b>it,</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> people could watch and hear and enjoy every year. I'm into it. I'm all about the holiday season." ...|$|E

In the book, Hermione blackmails her into writing {{an article that}} supports Harry {{as the rest of}} the Wizarding world denies his claims.

500|$|Cyrus became {{involved}} with Bolt once she was cast as Penny, Bolt's owner. Filmmakers asked Cyrus to write a song for herself and John Travolta, who stars as Bolt. She co-wrote the song {{with the aid of}} Jeffrey Steele, who also produced the track, {{in a short period of}} time as they had a due date. The film's settings vary in cities throughout the United States, which Cyrus thought she could capture in the song. [...] "Not just make <b>it</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> sounds from Hollywood and really produced, but we could add a little country twang to it," [...] she said. Cyrus said the writing process was easy. Before the song's completion, Travolta agreed to sing it, believing [...] "Well, it will be a cute song, whatever it is." [...] After listening to the song, he was surprised at Cyrus' songwriting abilities. [...] "She's really gifted at writing, and she really wanted to write something good for me as the character Bolt, so she went out of her way with her writing partner to come up with something good, and I really think they pulled it off", Travolta told MTV News.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by co-executive {{producer}} Mindy Kaling, her eighteenth writing credit for the series. Rainn Wilson, who portrays Dwight Schrute on the series, directed the episode, his second directing credit of the series after the sixth-season episode [...] "The Cover-Up". The episode {{was also the first}} of several season seven episodes that saw the return of Amy Ryan as Holly. Kaling purposely made Dwight [...] "complicated" [...] and [...] "mean" [...] in the script; she wanted to avoid a situation wherein Jim and Dwight become best friends, calling <b>it</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> would happen in a [...] "crappy sitcom feel-good formula." [...] She wanted to stress the fact that [...] "Jim [...] are not friends." [...] Kaling specifically wrote Jim to be [...] "off-guard [...] surprised" [...] in the episode, because she reasoned that [...] "perfect isn't always nearly as fun to play or watch as flawed." [...] The episode was filmed in early November and was shot out of order. This required the assistant directors of The Office to re-dress [...] "the sets from white, spare 'classy Christmas' look to the elaborate, colorful 'regular Christmas look.|$|E
500|$|The {{screenplay}} The Understudy {{was written}} by Andres Heinz; Aronofsky first heard about it while editing his second film Requiem for a Dream (2000) and described it as [...] "All About Eve with a double, set in the off-Broadway world." [...] After making The Fountain (2006), Aronofsky and producer Mike Medavoy had screenwriter John McLaughlin rewrite The Understudy; Aronofsky said McLaughlin [...] "took my idea of Swan Lake and the ballet and put [...] into the ballet world and changed the title to Black Swan." [...] When Aronofsky proposed a detailed outline of Black Swan to Universal Pictures, the studio decided to fast-track development of the project in January 2007. The project [...] "sort of died, again" [...] according to Aronofsky, until after the making of The Wrestler (2008), when he had Mark Heyman, director of development of Aronofsky's production company Protozoa Pictures, write for Black Swan [...] "and made <b>it</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> was workable." [...] By June 2009, Universal had placed the project in turnaround, generating attention from other studios and specialty divisions, particularly with actress Portman attached to star. Black Swan began development under Protozoa Pictures and Overnight Productions, the latter financing the film. In July 2009, Kunis was cast.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{response}} to Star Wars Headspace was mixed, holding a weighted mean of a 48 out of 100 {{on the site}} Metacritic based on seven reviews. Drew Mcweeny reviewed it for One Thing I Love Today, his daily column on HitFix which is meant to highlight certain aspects of modern-day popular culture. He honored the compilation's concept of an EDM Star Wars tribute as funny: [...] "I'm not sure how long I'll listen to it, because in the end, it's still {{an hour or so}} of EDM, but it was a delightful soundtrack to a busy weekend, and all of the small surprises built into it should make <b>it</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> any Star Wars fan will be able to easily enjoy." [...] A correspondent for The Boston Globe wrote that it was much better than he expected it to be, giving all credit to the producers who contributed to the compilation. Los Angeles Times critic Randall Roberts spotlighted the distinguishing characteristic of each song. [...] Bromwich, who wrote a review for Pitchfork Media, scored the release a 6.9 out of ten, highlighting the record's goal of just being [...] "simple fun" [...] and [...] "Neither [...] stale tribute nor sloppy lovefest". At the same time, however, he also disliked that the nostalgic style was seemingly [...] "a way of avoiding risk".|$|E
500|$|At the BFI London Film Festival, Nagy {{said she}} titled the film Carol, not The Price of Salt, because Highsmith herself {{had changed the}} title to Carol when the novel was republished, and she also [...] "liked the sort of strange, obsessive nature of calling it by someone's name." [...] There were later other discussions with Haynes. Haynes said that the film is called Carol because the novel [...] "is locked into the {{subjectivity}} of the younger woman" [...] and Carol is [...] "really the object of desire in the story." [...] "There's an element of, something aloof ... something unsettled about , that puts Therese and these new feelings ... on edge {{throughout much of the}} film. That relationship of who's the object and who's the subject does shift in the story, but it made sense ultimately that that would be the name for the film." [...] On the universal theme of the story, Haynes said [...] "the real determining question is not whether society will accept [...] feelings or not; it's, will this person return her love or not? ... That is what transcends the class of love, or the period in which it's occurring, and makes <b>it</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> just humbles us all and levels us all in the throes of those experiences that most of us have." ...|$|E

A near-five minute video received airtime on music television programs. [...] "Under the Milky Way" [...] won an ARIA Award in 1989 for 'Single of the Year'. In 2008, readers of The Australian voted it the best Australian song of the last 20 years. In response Kilbey said, [...] "it's not really about anything at all.

2500|$|His book Either/Or {{discussed}} {{whether or}} not love can be deceived. Is it {{a good thing to}} find out you have been deceived or is <b>it</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> makes you angry? Kierkegaard had already discussed anger in his Two Upbuilding Discourses, 1843 where he quoted The Epistle of James, Therefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger, because man’s anger does not work what is righteous before God. (James 1:17-22) Earlier in the same discourse he had discussed equality. There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. He asks pointed questions, [...] "Did the woman who was a sinner feel her guilt more deeply when the scribes were accusing her than when there was no accuser anymore and she stood alone before the Lord! But you also realize that the most dangerously deceived person is the one who is self-deceived, that the most dangerous condition is that of the one who is deceived by much knowledge, and, furthermore, that it is a lamentable weakness to have one’s consolation in another’s light-mindedness, {{but it is also a}} lamentable weakness to have one’s terror from another’s heavy-mindedness.
