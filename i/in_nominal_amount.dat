40|$|A {{scheme was}} put forward some short time ago, which promised {{to effect a}} radical and {{sweeping}} change in the ownership of the land, without imposing any great hardship or additional burden on any class in the State. Mr. Giffen, {{the author of the}} scheme propounded, under the nom de plume "Economist" in the Statist early in the present year, claimed for his proposal that it would enable the imperial government to buy out every landlord in Ireland, giving him consols at par, equal <b>in</b> <b>nominal</b> <b>amount</b> to twenty years 2 ̆ 7 purchase of the present judicial rents; to give the land free to the present occupiers, subject only to a rent-charge of one-half or two-thirds of the present judicial rents, payable to the new local authorities in Ireland, and to relieve the imperial exchequer of all payments now made out of it in connection with the local government of Ireland. Without in any way touching on the more purely political aspect of the question, my object is to consider the facts and figures on which Mr. Giffen 2 ̆ 7 s proposal is based, and submit his proposal to a more minute examination than has yet been given to it. To do this satisfactorily {{it will be necessary to}} analyze carefully the present burden of local and imperial taxation in Ireland, and define the existing and forecast the future financial relations between the exchequers of Great Britain and Ireland. Before dealing with the proposed future financial relations between the two countries, it will be necessary to state carefully the present position of affairs, so that we may thoroughly understand the circumstances with which we have to deal, and the existing interests which we must take into account...|$|E
50|$|One of {{the reasons}} for setting the {{currencies}} at parity with the pre-war price was the prevailing opinion at that time that deflation was not a danger, while inflation, particularly the inflation in the Weimar Republic, was an unbearable danger. Another reason was that those who had loaned <b>in</b> <b>nominal</b> <b>amounts</b> hoped to recover the same value in gold that they had lent. Because of the reparations that Germany had to pay France, Germany began a credit-fueled period of growth in order to export and sell enough goods abroad to gain gold to pay the reparations. The U.S., as the world's gold sink, loaned money to Germany to industrialize, which was then the basis for Germany paying back France, and France paying back loans to the U.K. and the U.S. This arrangement was codified in the Dawes Plan.|$|R
40|$|In intertemporal choice {{experiments}} {{people usually}} choose between smaller-sooner and larger-later amounts of money. That is, they make tradeoffs <b>in</b> terms of <b>nominal</b> <b>amounts.</b> Yet the factor governing intertemporal tradeoffs {{in the marketplace}} is usually the interest rate. In this study, we tested whether two major phenomena that occur when trading off <b>nominal</b> <b>amounts,</b> excessive discounting and the hyperbolic-interval effect, would also occur when trade-offs are made in terms of interest rates. They don’t. In a large-scale (N= 1, 960) internet study of Spanish consumers who made intertemporal tradeoffs for money, tradeoffs described <b>in</b> terms of <b>nominal</b> <b>amounts</b> induced high discount rates and a considerable hyperbolic-interval effect (replicating earlier studies). However, when they were described as both amounts and interest rates, discount rates were much lower, {{and there was no}} effect for how finely the interval was partitioned. When the tradeoffs were described as interest rates only, discount rates were even lower, and the hyperbolic-interval effect was reversed. Thus, some of the most-cited results in intertemporal choice research are unique to a specific way of eliciting discount rates...|$|R
40|$|Never {{before has}} the {{interest}} for charity been greater. At this writing, U. S. charities have collected nearly one billion U. S. dollars (!) {{only in the}} aid for the disaster victims in Haiti. But can you get people to give even more? Are there yet unexplored market in which charitable organizations still have growth potential? Traditional economic theory {{which is based in}} individuals' rational behavior and self-utility maximization has a hard time to explain the phenomenon of charitable donations. But relatively new research can possibly connect the theory and the phenomenon through the theorem of warm-glow in why people actually donate money anonymously and indirectly to people they never met or will ever know who made the donation. This thesis will examine whether or not a small change in the environment could influence individuals to donate more money and / or more frequently. The study was conducted as a field experiment at an ICA store deposit station where people are faced with the choice to donate their deposit to the Swedish Red Cross instead of getting a voucher for themselves. The obtained results shows a statistically significant difference between the donation of the pledge of over 13 percentage more {{in the presence of a}} visual stimulus, more specifically a picture of a poor boy drinking clean water from a tap. That results in a doubling <b>in</b> <b>nominal</b> <b>amounts</b> of donations for the charity. Moreover, I find that people who already before the experiment are sympathetic to donating the pledge do so to a greater extent than people who were not. Neither sex nor age seemed to affect the results in any way...|$|R

The group overpayed such renowned consortiums as Goldman Sachs / Flow East or PPF / CS First Boston, by about half a billion CZK. In 2003, the EC Group sued ČKA and demanded the return of about 570 mil CZK against portions of the claims that ČKA never owned due to legal shortcomings and therefore the claims could not even be sold. ČKA eventually returned about 440 mil CZK based on a judicial verdict..|$|R
50|$|National {{accounts}} can {{be presented}} <b>in</b> <b>nominal</b> or real <b>amounts,</b> with real amounts adjusted {{to remove the}} effects of price changes over time. A corresponding price index can also be derived from national output. Rates of change of the price level and output may also be of interest.

Economic growth rates (most commonly {{the growth rate of}} GDP) are generally measured in real (constant-price) terms. One use of economic-growth data from the national accounts is in growth accounting across longer periods of time for a country or across to estimate different sources of growth, whether from growth of factor inputs or technological change.|$|R

30|$|Second, {{the figures}} are asymmetric, {{revealing}} a general sense of “pessimism”: the average probability that purchasing power will fall is {{much larger than the}} probability that it will rise; and the average probability that purchasing power will fall by at least 10 % is much larger than the probability that it will rise by at least 10 %. This may seem surprising since there are no explicit plans to change the purchasing power of these benefits, which, as explained above, are in principle determined by the official poverty line. It might imply that respondents expect that the benefit level will not be fully indexed so that nominal increases will not be given at all or will not be enough to compensate for inflation. This implicitly reduces the official poverty line in real terms. In the past, there have also been time periods <b>in</b> which the <b>nominal</b> <b>amounts</b> of these and other social benefits were kept constant, reducing their purchasing power. The pessimistic expectations might also reflect that some respondents are aware of the future removal of the “Partner allowance”, which, although applying to a limited subgroup of elderly couples only, will reduce the average benefit per person or per household.|$|R

30|$|Figure 6 {{shows how}} the {{subjective}} probabilities vary with respondent age, combining data from all available time periods. 6 These figures show that pessimism concerning the state pension eligibility age falls with age. For example, the average percentage probability that the state pension eligibility age will be increased is about 60 % for respondents of 30 years old, but only about 40 % for respondents aged 70. The average probability that the same eligibility age will rise by {{at least two years}} is about 40 % for the youngest group and only 25 % for the oldest age group. A similar age pattern is found for the other questions (results available upon request from the authors) and the age patterns seem even stronger than the time trends discussed above. Interpreting the age patterns in terms of general optimism or pessimism {{about the future of the}} pension system, these results suggest the opposite of those of Dominitz and Manski (2005), who find that young people have more optimistic expectations on equity returns than older people. There may also be alternative explanations than age or cohort differences in optimism and pessimism for some of the age patterns. For example, different age groups have different consumption patterns. If expected price changes are heterogeneous across consumption commodities, this may induce differences <b>in</b> which <b>nominal</b> <b>amounts</b> the various age groups think are necessary to maintain purchasing power. Moreover, there are age and cohort differences in home ownership rates and the type and amount of mortgage people hold, and expectations concerning policy reforms in the housing market such as limiting tax deductability of mortgage interest payments may affect different age groups in different ways. For example, older people are often renting or have already redeemed most of their mortgage, so that they may not incorporate the consequences of less generous tax treatment of mortgages for the purchasing power of future retirement income.|$|R
