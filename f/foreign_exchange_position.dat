5000|$|The {{interest}} each minister {{exhibited in}} the other's country fostered {{the development of the}} relationship. By the mid-1950s, there was a flurry of new bilateral activity. In 1954, for example, the two countries' departments of immigration, aware that each confronted similar problems in settling the wave of postwar European immigrants, established the first of many inter-governmental exchange programs. At the same time, stimulated by the postwar economic boom, officials began to dismantle those tax barriers that discouraged investors from seeking new investment opportunities in the other country. By the end of the decade, Canadian direct investment in Australia had more than doubled. The quickening pace of bilateral relations attracted the attention of Pearson's cabinet colleagues. In 1955, Canada's ubiquitous [...] "minister of everything", C.D. Howe, visited Australia in his capacity as deputy prime minister. Howe's visit, which led to a 1959 agreement on nuclear cooperation, heralded a slow but steady stream of Canadian visitors that culminated in 1958 when John Diefenbaker became the first Canadian prime minister to visit Australia. A good many of these visitors were struck by Australia's potential as a market for Canadian products. Canadian exports had remained stagnant for most of the 1950s, constrained by the import restrictions that Australia imposed to protect sterling's weak <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>position.</b> This hiatus gave the booming Australian economy an opportunity to redress its perpetual trade deficit with Canada and exports to Canada doubled during the decade.38 As Australia gradually liberalized its import regulations in the late 1950s, there were grounds to hope that the warm political partnership might secure preferential access for Canadians to this strong economy. After two years of discussions, which were complicated by Canadian efforts to protect its dairy and agricultural industries, a new trade agreement with most of the substantive provisions found in its 1931 predecessor, came into effect in June 1960. When combined with Australia's decision to lift the last of its import restrictions, its effect on trade was dramatic. In three years, Canadian exports to Australia almost doubled from $54.2 million in 1959 to $105 million in 1962. By 1964, they had jumped to almost $146 million.|$|E

40|$|February 1998 The {{severity}} of the financial crises enveloping the ‘tiger’ economies of South East Asia in 1997 {{came as a surprise}} to many observers. This paper uses a simple Fisherian model of the ‘overborrowing syndrome’ to compare the Asian crises of 1997 with earlier overborrowing episodes in Mexico and Chile. While important similarities exist, the crises in South East Asia have been exacerbated by the unhedged <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>positions</b> of Asian banks. These open currency positions not only imposed significant additional losses on the banks following devaluation, they also magnified the scale of overborrowing during the cycle’s initial boom phase. Failure to limit the exposure of banks to <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> risk therefore increased the magnitude of the boom - bust overborrowing cycle both ex ante and ex post. The paper highlights the importance of effective regulation and supervision of capital markets, with a focus on limiting the speculative currency positions of banks, especially those that form the core of the domestic payments system and therefore enjoy a (possibly implicit) public guarantee. Improving the institutional infrastructure of financial supervision is the only effective way of mitigating the macroeconomic costs of overborrowing. JEL Classification: O 16, F 32, F 34, E 44.

40|$|The {{proposed}} market-risk capital-adequacy framework, to {{be implemented}} {{at the end of}} 1997, requires Australian banks to hold capital against market risk. A fundamental component of this framework is the opportunity for banks to use their value-at-risk (VaR) models as the basis of the market-risk capital charge. Value-at-risk measures the potential loss on a portfolio for a specified level of confidence if adverse movements in market prices were to occur. This paper examines the VaR measure and some of the techniques available for assessing the performance of a VaR model. The first section of the paper uses a simple portfolio of two spot <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>positions</b> to illustrate three of the approaches used in the calculation of a VaR measure: variance-covariance, historical simulation and Monte-Carlo simulation. It is concluded that, although VaR is a very useful tool, it is not without its shortcomings and so should be supplemented with other risk-management techniques. The second section of the paper focuses on the use of backtesting – the comparison of model-generated VaR numbers with actual profits and losses z– for assessing the accuracy of a VaR model. Several statistical tests are demonstrated by testing daily VaR and profit and loss data obtained from an Australian bank. The paper concludes that, although the tests are not sufficiently precise to form the basis of regulatory treatment of banks’ VaR results, the tests do provide useful diagnostic information for evaluating model performance. ...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade the growth of trading {{activity}} in financial markets, numerous instances of financial instability, {{and a number of}} widely publicised losses on banks' trading books have resulted in a re-analysis of the risks faced, and how they are measured. The most widely advocated approach to have emerged to measure market risk is that of Value-at-Risk (VaR). This methodology was designed in J. P. Morgan to give their chief executive a single figure that would provide a daily summary of the evolving risk of the Banks investment portfolio. VaR methods estimate the distribution of losses/gains on a portfolio of assets/liabilities over a given horizon. From the estimated distribution one can then find, for the loss on the portfolio, a bound that will only be exceeded rarely. This bound is the VaR. The term “rarely” is often taken to refer to an event that occurs one or five times per hundred periods. In actual applications users are free to define “rarely” to suit their own needs. VaR can be calculated in various ways and its value depends on the assumptions made and models used. This paper looks at six different measures of the VaR of an Irish investor holding an equally weighted portfolio of <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>positions</b> in the currencies of Ireland’s major trading partners. The basic data used are daily exchange rates covering the period 1990 to 1998. Daily VaRs for four different holding periods are calculated, using six alternative approaches to estimating the distribution of the underlying risk. The measured VaRs are compared graphically and statistically with actual losses/gains over the period. Recently developed techniques are used to measure the performance and accuracy of the estimates of the VaR estimates. For the portfolios considered here the method based on Exponentially Weighted Moving Averages is superior to the others. This may of course be due to the statistical properties of the FOREX returns being considered. The article provides a framework for the comparison of different measures of VaR. These can be adapted for the evaluation of alternative VaR models for risk control within an organisation. This framework can also serve as an input to the validation of in-house models proposed for the calculation of capital adequacy under the Capital Adequacy Directive. ...|$|R

The four questions that the dissertation attempts to answer in Chapters Two to Five respectively are: 1) Does the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission depend on the financial development of an economy? 2) Can monetary policy be used as a tool in easing pressure on domestic currencies in the <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> market? 3) Do banks engage in excessively risky behaviour when monetary policy is expansionary? 4) Does monetary policy influence aggregate variables like private capital formation, growth and their interrelationships? Chapter Two tests the completeness of the pass-through of the central bank policy rate to bank lending rates on one hand, and the interest rate pass-through {{as a function of the}} level of financial development on the other hand. The results show that the pass-through of central bank policy rate to bank lending rates is asymmetric for three Anglophone West African countries, namely: Gambia, Ghana and Nigeria, which are seeking to ascend onto a single monetary framework. However, there is no evidence that financial development affects the pass-through of monetary policy. These findings still prove relevant, especially with regard to the quest for effective monetary policy implementation and the ascension onto a single monetary framework by these 3 countries. The motivation for this study stemmed from policy discussions and academic debates on the premise that financial development is a key element in the pursuit of effective monetary policy implementation, focusing on the three Anglophone West African countries between 1975 and 2011. The study employs the bounds testing approach to cointegration, and the Autoregressive Distributed Lags (ARDL) by Pesaran et al., (2001). The findings show significant differences in the interest rate pass-through of the 3 countries studied. Ghana and Gambia were characterised by undershooting in the response of lending rates to monetary policy changes whilst Nigeria was characterised by overshooting in bank lending rates. Financial development proved significant in some, but not in all the cases, while economic growth proved mostly insignificant in the transmission of the policy rate to bank lending rates In Chapter Three, we show that contractionary monetary policy of high interest rates is able to correct disequilibrium in the foreign currency market in selected countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The chapter also provides empirical evidence about the impact of macroeconomic fundamentals on the domestic <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> market. The study assesses the impact of monetary policy on <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> market pressure (EMP) in developing country contexts focusing on some selected countries in SSA. EMP is the sum of exchange rate depreciation and change in foreign reserves that is required to restore equilibrium to the domestic <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> market. The study was motivated by the fact that most of the SSA countries are developing economies that have negative net export positions and stand to lose significantly from consistently deteriorating <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>positions.</b> This study thus sought to measure the ability of monetary policy to significantly address currency pressures that arise from trading on the global market. The hypothesis that a tighter monetary policy stance can lend strength to a currency was tested in this study using Generalised Methods of Moments (GMM) estimation in a dynamic panel setting. Data on 20 SSA economies for which data were available for the period 1991 to 2010 are used. The study found a negative and significant relationship between monetary policy and EMP, implying that contractionary monetary policy can ease EMP...|$|R
