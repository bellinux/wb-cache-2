Branagh stated the footage contains [...] "things like the Asgardian parents, Odin and Frigga, played by the beautiful Rene Russo, there's some beautiful scenes in there that I think people will enjoy.

[...] He referred to the recording process of the album as [...] "gradual but really organic."

[...] Fazekas noted that [...] "the challenge" [...] for the season was to find a way to reunite Carter with Edwin Jarvis since he is [...] "not an agent....that's a really important relationship, how do we keep them together?...The nice thing about Peggy this season is she's not having to hide her agenda from the SSR. [...] is helping her out, just in a different way." [...] Elaborating on the SSR's role in the season, Fazekas explained that when Markus and McFeely created the organisation for [...] it was inspired by the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), which was [...] "somewhat disbanded after the war, because it was created because of World War II. So now that the war is over, things are changing. And in real history, the OSS sort of became the CIA and some of its other functions went under other departments. There's a little bit of change going on within SSR and so Thompson [...] has a boss [...] that's going to be saying, [...] "Look, things are changing, and you need to look out for yourself."" [...] The season also sees Daniel Sousa promoted to the chief of the Los Angeles SSR office.|$|E

2500|$|Five of {{the songs}} on Armageddon are written by Sebastian alone, while the others {{have at least one}} co-writer. Sebastian began writing songs which appear on the album almost two years before its release, and {{performed}} two of them, [...] "Summer Love" [...] and [...] "Keeper", while touring as a support act on Lionel Richie's Australian and New Zealand tour in March 2011. Both are pop songs, with [...] "Keeper" [...] having a reggae feel. [...] "Summer Love" [...] is about bittersweet feelings for a lost love, and [...] "Keeper" [...] is about finding that special love, the one who is a keeper. [...] "Don't Worry Be Happy", released as the lead single in November 2012, is an upbeat pop song Sebastian wrote after he encountered an angry motorist in Los Angeles. Discussing the inspiration for the track he explained he could sometimes be caught up <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of [...] "glass half empty" [...] in his life, and wrote the song as a reminder to himself and hopefully to others that life is too short to stress about the small things. Sebastian showcased two more songs, [...] "Amnesia" [...] and [...] "Armageddon", at the [...] "Don't Worry Be Happy" [...] media launch in December 2011. [...] "Amnesia" [...] is a soulful pop ballad about the anguish of coping with a broken relationship. Sebastian says of the power ballad [...] "Armageddon", [...] "The title track might sound pretty dark, but it's actually about not taking love for granted, and living like tomorrow is the last day on earth".|$|E
