5|$|Phoenix {{contains}} HE0107-5240, possibly one of {{the oldest}} stars yet discovered. It has around 1/200,000 the metallicity that the Sun has and hence must have formed very early in the <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe.</b> With a visual magnitude of 15.17, it is around 10,000 times dimmer than the faintest stars {{visible to the naked eye}} and is 36000 light years distant.|$|E
5|$|All of this cosmic {{evolution}} {{after the}} inflationary epoch can be rigorously described and modeled by the ΛCDM model of cosmology, which uses the independent frameworks {{of quantum mechanics}} and Einstein's General Relativity. There is no well-supported model describing the action prior to 10−15 seconds or so. Apparently a new unified theory of quantum gravitation is needed to break this barrier. Understanding this earliest of eras in the <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> is currently {{one of the greatest}} unsolved problems in physics.|$|E
5|$|Creationists {{argue against}} {{evolution}} {{on the grounds}} that it cannot explain certain non-evolutionary processes, such as abiogenesis, the Big Bang, or the meaning of life. In such instances, evolution is being redefined to refer to the entire <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe,</b> and it is argued that if one aspect of the universe is seemingly inexplicable, the entire body of scientific theories must be baseless. At this point, objections leave the arena of evolutionary biology and become general scientific or philosophical disputes.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> {{possible}} thermal <b>histories</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> during <b>the</b> epoch z = 10 - 1000 are studied. Expressions for the fractional ionization and {{electron temperature}} {{are given in}} <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> homogeneous heating as a function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parameters <b>of</b> arbitrary ionizing sources. It is shown that present and future limits on spectral distortions to the microwave background radiation do not provide very restrictive constraints on possible thermal <b>histories</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe.</b> If H(0) = 50 km/s Mpc, <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> could have been completely ionized throughout its history with no observable spectral effects even if Omega = 1 and <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> is entirely made of baryons. Heating by cosmic rays and very massive stars is briefly discussed...|$|R
5|$|In an {{animated}} segment of this episode, Tyson discusses {{the life and}} vision of the 16th-century Italian philosopher Giordano Bruno (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) {{as the person who}} championed a much more expansive understanding of the Earth's place in the universe, with the Sun being just one star among all the others. Later, he presents the <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> on Carl Sagan's Cosmic Calendar. The episode ends with Tyson's brief speech about Carl Sagan's life and career, and how Sagan inspired him to become an astrophysicist.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{discovered}} that Type Ia supernovae that were considered the same are in fact different; moreover, a form of the Type Ia supernova that is relatively infrequent today was far more common earlier in the <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe.</b> This could have far reaching cosmological significance and could lead to revision of estimation of the rate of {{expansion of the universe}} and the prevalence of dark energy.|$|E
5|$|The dust {{present in}} the {{interstellar}} medium is opaque to visual light. It is more transparent to far-infrared, {{which can be used}} to observe the interior regions of giant molecular clouds and galactic cores in great detail. Infrared is also used to observe distant, red-shifted galaxies that were formed much earlier in the <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Universe.</b> Water vapor and carbon dioxide absorb a number of useful portions of the infrared spectrum, so high-altitude or space-based telescopes are used for infrared astronomy.|$|E

5|$|For many {{practical}} purposes, {{light and}} other electromagnetic waves will appear to propagate instantaneously, but for long distances and very sensitive measurements, their finite speed has noticeable effects. In communicating with distant space probes, {{it can take}} minutes to hours for a message to get from Earth to the spacecraft, or vice versa. The light seen from stars left them many years ago, allowing {{the study of the}} <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> by looking at distant objects. The finite speed of light also limits the theoretical maximum speed of computers, since information must be sent within the computer from chip to chip. The speed of light can be used with time of flight measurements to measure large distances to high precision.|$|E
5|$|Stars {{are created}} within galaxies from a reserve of cold gas that forms into giant {{molecular}} clouds. Some galaxies {{have been observed}} to form stars at an exceptional rate, which {{is known as a}} starburst. If they continue to do so, then they would consume their reserve of gas in a time span less than the lifespan of the galaxy. Hence starburst activity usually lasts for only about ten million years, a relatively brief period in the history of a galaxy. Starburst galaxies were more common during the early <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Universe,</b> and, at present, still contribute an estimated 15% to the total star production rate.|$|E
5|$|He was {{a friend}} of Queen guitarist and {{astrophysicist}} Brian May, who was an occasional guest on The Sky at Night. May bought Moore's Selsey home in 2008, leasing it back to him for a peppercorn rent the same day to provide financial security. May, Moore and Chris Lintott co-wrote a book Bang! The Complete <b>History</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Universe.</b> In February 2011, Moore completed (with Robin Rees and Iain Nicolson) his comprehensive Patrick Moore's Data Book of Astronomy for Cambridge University Press. In 1986 he was identified as the co-author of a book published in 1954 called Flying Saucer from Mars, attributed to Cedric Allingham, which was intended as a money-making venture and practical joke on UFO believers; Moore never admitted his involvement. He once joined the Flat Earth Society as an ironic joke.|$|E

5|$|The {{proportions}} {{of all types}} of matter and energy have changed over the <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Universe.</b> Today, ordinary matter, which includes atoms, stars, galaxies, and life, accounts for only 4.9% of the contents of the Universe. The present overall density of this type of matter is very low, roughly 4.5 × 10−31 grams per cubic centimetre, corresponding to a density of the order of only one proton for every four cubic meters of volume. The nature of both dark energy and dark matter is unknown. Dark matter, a mysterious form of matter that has not yet been identified, accounts for 26.8% of the contents. Dark energy, which is the energy of empty space and is causing the expansion of the Universe to accelerate, accounts for the remaining 68.3% of the contents.|$|E

5000|$|Daly conducts theoretical, phenomenological, and {{observational}} work in astrophysics. Her main {{areas of}} study are cosmology and extragalactic astrophysics. She is most well-known for her work on the expansion and acceleration <b>histories</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe,</b> <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> these <b>histories</b> to determine <b>the</b> contents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe,</b> and studies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> properties <b>of</b> supermassive black holes, e.g., as summarized. Non-specialists interested in this work can {{read about it in}} the popular literature, such as Sky & Telescope. [...] Some key results, obtained in collaboration with Professor Stanislav George Djorgovski, are that the expansion and acceleration <b>histories</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> can be determined in a model-independent manner, which does not require that a theory of gravity be specified and does not depend upon <b>the</b> contents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe.</b> <b>The</b> results indicate that <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> is accelerating at the present time, and was decelerating in the recent past. Daly has also shown that <b>the</b> properties <b>of</b> outflows from <b>the</b> vicinity <b>of</b> a supermassive black hole can be used to estimate <b>the</b> spin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> black hole.
