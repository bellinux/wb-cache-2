5|$|De Hauteclocque {{broke his}} leg {{in two places}} in a fall from his horse in 1936. He told his company {{that it was his}} own fault for riding on the {{shoulder}} of the road. Thereafter he frequently walked with a cane. After another mishap involving losing his way during a tactical exercise and getting stuck in a field cordoned off with barbed wire, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> when you have done something really stupid, it is best to admit it.|$|E
5|$|Later on in 2012, Feeder took on {{one last}} tour for the year. The tour lasted for five dates {{starting}} at the O2 Academy Glasgow, before ending at the Brixton Academy in November. At the Brixton show, Grant Nicholas announced that the band would be going away for a while, before deciding what to do next. Earlier on before the tour began, Nicholas was interviewed by website Mancunian Matters in which <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> the band would take a break next year with no shows planned, although a follow-up album was mentioned alongside possible side-projects.|$|E
5|$|Jane Pierce died of {{tuberculosis}} in Andover, Massachusetts in December 1863; she was buried at Old North Cemetery in Concord, New Hampshire. Pierce was further grieved by his close friend Nathaniel Hawthorne's death in May 1864; {{he was with}} Hawthorne when the author died unexpectedly. Hawthorne had controversially dedicated his final book to Pierce. Some Democrats tried again to put Pierce's name up for consideration as the 1864 presidential election unfolded, but he kept his distance; Lincoln easily won a second term. When news spread of Lincoln's assassination in April 1865, a mob gathered outside Pierce's home in Concord, demanding to know why he had not raised a flag as a public mourning gesture. Pierce grew angry, expressing sadness over Lincoln's death but denying any need for a public gesture. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> his history of military and public service proved his patriotism, which was enough to quiet the crowd.|$|E
50|$|Stanford's {{situation}} deteriorates as {{his father}} continues {{to distance himself from}} home, his grandmother becomes senile and moves to a dead retirement home, Millicent tortures him in their study sessions, and his lie to his friends becomes harder and harder to cover up - because <b>he's</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> passed English with flying colors.|$|R
60|$|The fire {{continued}} all day unabated; and at nightfall, when a man, as usual, {{brought the}} captives food, <b>he</b> exultingly <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> no damage whatever had been effected by the guns of the fleet.|$|R
5000|$|Investigate {{magazine}} published, in February 2006, {{allegations that}} he entered the girls' dormitory to awaken students twice, and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> once <b>that</b> they were taking too long to shower after a [...] "mud run." [...] Benson-Pope denied any impropriety.|$|R
5|$|Mark Hoppus' {{involvement}} {{stems from}} when an Atticus Clothing employee played him I Am the Movie. He was so taken with {{it that he}} raved about the band in Rolling Stone, inviting them to open for his group, Blink-182 on their 2004 European tour. On the trek, he became good friends with the musicians. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> he had purchased an abundance of recording gear and amplifiers for the previous Blink-182 album and told the band of his interest in recording music from a production standpoint. At the final show of the tour, guitarist Joshua Cain went to Hoppus' dressing room {{and asked him to}} produce their next record. Although Hoppus had never produced anything before, he was excited {{to be a part of}} the album and accepted the offer.|$|E
25|$|Narbona {{held back}} his forces, who were hidden {{on both sides}} of the defile. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> when the time was right, and not before, they would cut the long file of men into small pieces, like cutting a long tree trunk into firewood.|$|E
25|$|Columbus timed {{the eclipse}} with his hourglass, and {{shortly before the}} totality ended after 48 minutes, he told the frightened {{indigenous}} people {{that they were going}} to be forgiven. When the moon started to reappear from the shadow of the Earth, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> his god had pardoned them.|$|E
60|$|The boys found old Uncle Barney {{polishing}} his gun. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>them,</b> however, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was {{not going}} out hunting, but was going into the woods to inspect some of the trees {{with a view to}} cutting them down for lumber.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Hathorn had {{no doubt}} on the subject. The cane had been going all the morning, and <b>he</b> had <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> extra tasks would be given which would occupy all their {{playtime}} until the offender was given up to judgment.|$|R
5000|$|In 1913 Barney {{played for}} the Great Falls Electrics. The September 5, 1913 Salt Lake Tribune reports that Barney [...] "started under a handicap. He was unknown, and {{there were those who}} {{predicted}} his early finish. The things that were said to him would have taken the heart out of any 19 year old lad. But Barney Duffy was different. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>'em</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was going to go in and pitch ball and show <b>'em</b> <b>that</b> he was there. And her certainly has made good. Now there isn't a man in the Union association who doubts for a minute that Duffy will stick with the Pirates." ...|$|R
25|$|<b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> {{they did}} not need to find {{corroboration}} of Price's testimony. If they believed her, that was enough to convict. Judge Callahan said he was giving them two forms - one for conviction and one for acquittal, but he supplied the jury with only a form to convict. He supplied them with an acquittal form only after the prosecution, fearing reversible error, urged him do so.|$|E
25|$|Josef Fritzl told Elisabeth and {{the three}} who {{remained}} (Kerstin, Stefan, and Felix) {{that they would be}} gassed if they tried to escape. Investigators concluded that this was just an empty threat to frighten the captives; there was no gas supply to the basement. He stated after his arrest that <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> they would receive an electric shock and die if they meddled with the cellar door.|$|E
25|$|Robertson later {{claimed that}} he {{attended}} the Calais Conference thinking it would be solely about railways, but this is probably untrue. Robertson was at the War Cabinet (20 February) – <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> Haig and Nivelle were in complete agreement – which insisted on a conference {{to draw up a}} formal agreement about “the operations of 1917”, and Robertson wrote to Haig (24 February) informing him of this.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, no, sir; not all <b>that.</b> <b>'E</b> only <b>told</b> <b>'em</b> <b>that</b> <b>'e</b> {{was in for}} a good thing.

60|$|He {{reached his}} lowest deep {{one night after}} a {{conversation}} with Lloyd Smith, an ex-clerk, {{and a couple of}} young fellows who called upon him at his room. Lloyd noticed his gloomy face, and asked what the trouble was. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> frankly <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was disgusted.|$|R
6000|$|... "That I can't tell you. He was {{a friend}} of Sir Thomas before his marriage; I know <b>that.</b> And <b>he</b> has <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> it is of no use their {{attempting}} to keep it secret. He was over at Hap House with Owen Fitzgerald before he went." ...|$|R
25|$|According to his Department of Defense Detainee Assessment, it is {{believed}} that he traveled in Mecca in 2001 where he met Abu Walid al-Makki who began {{to talk to him about}} Islam and jihad. Al-Makki introduced him to Muhammad al-Saudi al-Harabi who was his contact for joining the jihad in Afghanistan. Because he believed that his family would not support his participation in jihad <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> he would be traveling to Pakistan to memorize the Koran.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} witness was Ari Ben-Menashe, {{who also}} provided affidavits for Inslaw that Brian had brought both public domain and enhanced versions of Promis to Israel, and eventually sold the enhanced version to the Israeli government. Committee investigators interviewed Ben-Menashe in May 1991, and <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> Brian sold enhanced Promis to both Israeli intelligence and Singapore's armed forces, receiving {{several million dollars}} in payment. He also testified that Brian sold public domain versions to Iraq and Jordan.|$|E
25|$|Anzhel Vagenshtain {{was their}} {{discoverer}} for the cinema. After reading their feuilletons in Starshel, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> they should write a comedy. As a joke, {{they sat down}} and wrote the screenplay for The Ancient Coin. This led to the first Bulgarian musical film, a 1965 co-production with East Germany. The then-fashionable Bulgarian singer Liana Antonova and the East German film star Manfred Krug appeared in the film. The music was by Bulgarian composer Petar Stupel.|$|E
60|$|But Jonas was {{too much}} engaged in some work about the new barn {{to listen to their}} story then. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>them,</b> however, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would go down about sunset, and look at their work, and hear the account, in the evening, of the {{experiment}} in doing work like workmen.|$|R
6000|$|The boys still {{possessed the}} great nut which the Captain had insisted they should keep for themselves, and <b>he</b> now <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> if {{they chose to}} sell it, they would each have a nice little fortune to take back with them. The eldest boy {{consulted}} the others, {{and then he said}} to the Captain: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do not {{you think}} so?" [...] said Hugo Bohun to Mrs. Campian, {{who was sitting}} apart, {{listening}} to Lord St. Aldegonde's account of his travels in the United States, which he was very sorry he ever quitted. And then they inquired to what Mr. Bohun referred, and then <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> all <b>that</b> had been said.|$|R
25|$|The war {{was thus}} {{locked in a}} stalemate. As the Pandavas mulled over this situation, Krishna advised them to visit Bhishma himself and request him to suggest {{a way out of}} this stalemate. Bhishma loved the Pandavas and knew that he stood as the {{greatest}} obstacle in their path to victory and so when they visited Bhishma, he gave them a hint as to how they could defeat him. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> if faced by one who had once been of the opposite gender, he would lay down his arms and fight no longer.|$|E
25|$|Kelly {{was deeply}} upset by his {{treatment}} before the Committee and privately described MacKinlay as an 'utter bastard.' During the hearing, he was closely questioned about several quotes given to Susan Watts, another BBC journalist working on Newsnight, who had reported a similar story. It later emerged that Gilligan had himself told {{members of the}} committee that Watts' source was also Kelly. Kelly denied any knowledge of the quotes and must have realised that he would have serious problems if the Ministry of Defence believed he had been the source of them. On the following day, (16 July 2003), Kelly gave evidence to the Intelligence and Security Committee. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> he liaised with Operation Rockingham within the Defence Intelligence Staff.|$|E
25|$|News of {{the conference}} leaked and Tory churchmen were shocked that Rochester might have wavered in his faith. Rochester {{requested}} another conference and James consented. Rochester {{let it be known}} to influential Catholics at court that he would do everything they requested (except convert) so long as he remained in office. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> as a Protestant he would prove more useful to them than as a Catholic. However, on 17 December James called Rochester into an audience and told him that so high an office of Lord Treasurer could not be held by a staunch Anglican under a Catholic monarch. James asked him to think again on his refusal to convert but Rochester would not and on 4 January 1687 he was dismissed. However he received a pension of approximately £4000 per annum and £40,000 and estates from a convicted traitor.|$|E
60|$|Thomas {{threatened}} to excommunicate them all, a menace {{which did not}} amount to much as they were already excommunicating themselves, and when they remained obstinate, <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would {{have nothing to do}} with this rain-making business, which was unholy and repugnant to him. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>them,</b> moreover, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was certain that their wickedness would bring some judgment upon them, in which he proved to be right.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Walker {{was nearly}} as pleased as wot 'e was, and the fuss they made of the old gentleman was sinful a'most. He 'ad to speak about it 'imself at last, and <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>'em</b> plain <b>that</b> when <b>'e</b> wanted arf-a-dozen sore-eyed {{children}} to be brought down in their night-gowns to kiss 'im while he was eating sausages, he'd say so.|$|R
2500|$|Fales {{was stabbed}} 11 times, {{including}} {{once in the}} back, and her throat was slashed.

25|$|Danzan and Choibalsan {{arrived in}} Verkhneudinsk, {{the capital of}} the pro-Soviet Far Eastern Republic, {{in the first part of}} July. They met with Boris Shumyatsky, then acting head of the government. Shumyatsky knew little about them, and for three weeks dodged their demands for a speedy Soviet {{decision}} whether or not to provide military assistance to the Mongolians against the Chinese. Finally, perhaps at Shumyatsky's suggestion, they sent a telegram to members of the MPP in Urga with a coded message that they should obtain a letter, stamped with the seal of the Bogd Khaan, formally requesting Soviet assistance. The MPP did succeed in obtaining a letter from the Khaan's court, albeit with difficulty. Five members of the Party—D. Losol, Dambyn Chagdarjav, Dogsom, L. Dendev, and Sükhbaatar—brought it to Verkhneudinsk. When the seven men met with Shumyatsky, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> he had no authority to make a decision on their request; they must go to Irkutsk.|$|E
25|$|During the 1964 Hama riot, Assad {{voted to}} {{suppress}} the uprising violently if needed. The decision {{to suppress the}} Hama riot led to a schism in the Military Committee between Umran and Jadid. Umran opposed force, instead wanting the Ba'ath Party to create a coalition with other pan-Arab forces. Jadid desired a strong one-party state, {{similar to those in}} the communist countries of Europe. Assad, as junior partner, kept quiet at first but eventually allied himself with Jadid. Why Assad chose to side with him has been widely discussed; he probably shared Jadid's radical ideological outlook. Having lost his footing on the Military Committee, Umran aligned himself with Aflaq and the National Command; <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> the Military Committee was planning to seize power in the party by ousting them. Because of Umran's defection, Rifaat al-Assad (Assad's brother) succeeded Umran as commander of a secret military force tasked with protecting Military Committee loyalists.|$|E
25|$|In April 2005, Diehl-Armstrong {{confided to}} a state trooper that she had {{information}} about the Wells' case and after meeting with FBI agents, said she would tell them everything she knew if she was transferred from Muncy State Penitentiary to a minimum-security prison in Cambridge Springs. During a series of interviews, Diehl-Armstrong admitted to providing the kitchen timers used for the bomb and said that Rothstein was the mastermind of the plot and that Wells had been {{directly involved in the}} plan. In late 2005, Kenneth Barnes, an ex-television repairman in jail on unrelated drug charges and friend of Diehl-Armstrong, was turned in by his brother-in-law after revealing details of the crime to him. Barnes told investigators that would tell them the whole story in return for a reduced sentence. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> Diehl-Armstrong was the mastermind of the crime and that she wanted the money to pay Barnes to kill her father, whom she believed was wasting her inheritance.|$|E
50|$|Another version {{given by}} Carlos Teschauer {{says that the}} child born from the union of the chief's {{daughter}} and the white warrior not only lived long, but also taught his tribe many things. <b>He</b> also <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> after a year from his death they should open his grave that the greatest treasure of all, a bread-yielding root, would be then revealed to them.|$|R
5000|$|Adam and Eve {{were placed}} in the Garden of Eden. Although they had {{physical}} bodies, they were not yet mortal.

60|$|After dinner Mr. Goodenough {{invited the}} people to sit down in a vast circle holding each other's hands. <b>He</b> then <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> should at a word make them all jump to their feet. Then taking out a small but {{powerful}} galvanic battery, he arranged it and placed wires {{into the hands of}} the two men nearest to him in the great circle.|$|R
