Research efforts in this area have created several different technological approaches to the issue, {{one of its most}} promising being electrophoretic displays (EPDs). Due to their extraordinary properties, they have the potential to make a major impact both economically and ecologically. This master’s thesis deals with ecological and economic aspects of EPDs along with some technical aspects of electrophoretic display applications. The basic functioning of the displays is discussed, as well as a few of its major implementations and concurrent developments. Among the many possible applications of EPDs, two are readers for electronic newspapers and e-books, which this report deals with in depth.

Their seeking of copyright licenses to permit them to produce such books did not pose any particular threat to copyright holders and publishers. But as they started taking their places as libraries that rendered library services, and as technological developments enabled them to make and circulate accessible books in various forms to readers with different print disabilities, it became {{difficult for them to}} have to seek and obtain such licenses for a variety of reasons. Many governments therefore enacted statutory exceptions to their copyright laws to assist them. Some of those exceptions are considered here, with reference to their efficacy. Particular attention is paid to difficulties arising out of those exceptions as they impact interlending services. It is argued that those laws alone {{do not appear to be}} at the heart of the problems libraries {{for the blind}} experience with regard to interlending.

40|$|Although {{evidence}} suggests that enjoyment in reading is declining (Sainsbury and Schagen, 2004), students that enjoy reading are likely to read more often and be better readers (Clark and De Zoysa, 2011). The last decade has seen a well-publicised proliferation of digital reading devices as a platform for the <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> electronic <b>books</b> (e-books). E-books include features that influence the reading experience, and the present study aims to explore the impact of using an iPad as an e-book on the reading experience (state enjoyment) of struggling adolescent readers. A mixed methods approach was used, including an experimental repeated-measures design where thirty participants (from years 7 – 9) were allocated to groups that read the same book for fifteen minutes across three conditions (a print book, iPad without features deployed, iPad with features deployed). The conditions were experienced in different orders and state enjoyment was measured through a questionnaire. Follow up focus groups were conducted to complement the questionnaire data. Analysis of the results shows that the iPad (with features deployed) had a significant, {{positive impact on the}} state enjoyment of struggling adolescent readers. Although some of the impact is likely attributable to the novelty of the iPad, the focus groups suggested that the dictionary and narration, {{and the size of the}} font were important for struggling adolescent readers. Whilst care must be taken with the results of this study, not least as it does not consider the maintenance of any changes in enjoyment, it is tentatively suggested that electronic reading devices with congruent features may encourage disaffected, struggling adolescent readers to return to reading.
