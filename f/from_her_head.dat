5|$|The goddess {{carries her}} own severed head– {{sometimes}} {{on a platter}} or in a skull-bowl– in her left hand. Though no legend mentions a specific weapon for the beheading, she holds a scimitar, a knife or a scissor-like object in her right hand. Though generally depicted with two arms, manifestations of the goddess with four arms also exist. While her own severed head and the sword appear in two of her hands, the implements in the remaining arms vary: a scissor-like object, a skull-bowl collecting the dripping blood <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> or blood stream from her neck, or a severed head, sometimes identified {{as that of the}} god Brahma.|$|E
5|$|From a young age, Jackson {{was exposed}} to sex. He {{received}} mixed messages on the subject from his parents. His mother Katherine was a devout Jehovah's Witness and conveyed her thoughts clearly; lust in thought or deed was sinful outside of marriage, and physical intimacy should be saved for marriage. In contrast to his wife, father Joseph, a steel mill worker, shunned the religion and would have The Jackson 5 perform at strip clubs and seedy bars in {{the earliest days of}} their career. He allowed nine-year-old Michael to watch from the wings of the stage as male audience members whistled at women who stripped until nude. In one incident, a fascinated Michael watched as an apparently big breasted female removed all but her underwear. The stripper then proceeded to reach into her bra, removing two large oranges and the wig <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> to reveal that the person he thought was a female was not a woman at all.|$|E
25|$|The use of veil in Renaissance paintings, {{from the}} Meditations on the Life of Christ, symbolizes {{the manner in}} which the Madonna wrapped the Child in the veil <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> at the Nativity and, prophetically, again at the Crucifixion.|$|E

25|$|Julius was {{executed}} first; he died {{after the first}} electric shock. Ethel's execution did not go smoothly. After she was given {{the normal course of}} three electric shocks, attendants removed the strapping and other equipment only to have doctors determine that Ethel's heart was still beating. Two more electric shocks were applied, and at the conclusion, eyewitnesses (Bob Considine among them) reported that smoke rose <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E
25|$|The USA Basketball organization, with {{input from}} VanDerveer, decided {{to depart from}} the usual {{strategy}} to form a team {{a few weeks before}} the event, which severely limited the practice time. Instead, they decided to form a full-time national team to stay together for a year, preparing to the 1996 Olympics. VanDerveer was chosen as head coach, but was expected to take a one-year sabbatical <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> coaching position at Stanford.|$|E

50|$|The Chimera {{finally was}} {{defeated}} by Bellerophon {{with the help of}} Pegasus, at the command of King Iobates of Lycia, after terrorising Lycia and nearby lands. Since Pegasus could fly, Bellerophon shot the Chimera from the air, safe <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>heads</b> and breath. A scholiast to Homer adds that he finished her off by equipping his spear with a lump of lead that melted when exposed to the Chimera's fiery breath and consequently killed her, an image drawn from metalworking.|$|R
60|$|As she spoke, {{her eyes}} were fixed on a tomblike hollow of the cliff, and she saw, she averred the same to me with solemnity, Idris pacing slowly towards this cave. She was turned <b>from</b> <b>her,</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> was bent down, her white dress was such as she was {{accustomed}} to wear, except that a thin crape-like veil covered her golden tresses, and concealed her as a dim transparent mist. She looked dejected, as docilely yielding to a commanding power; she submissively entered, and was lost in the dark recess.|$|R

25|$|By the early/mid-1990s, some of McTavish's {{storytelling}} received {{criticism for}} being gimmick-driven (i.e. multiple dual roles, bomb plots). Reports soon surfaced that Behr and McTavish were having conflicts about storylines {{and the direction}} of the series. After the O.J. Simpson trial preempted daytime television programs throughout late 1994 and into 1995, many soaps saw their ratings decline, and All My Children was no different. When Megan McTavish was fired <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> writing post in the spring, former head writer Lorraine Broderick was tapped by Behr to lead the team once again.|$|E

She dances in a trance and empties another cup, which is filled by the ghost of Candaules, who {{suddenly}} tears the crown <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> Terrified, she swoons and Gyges hurries to her side and endeavours to lead her to her throne, but again, the ghost appears. Nisia, panic-stricken, runs among the dancers, who cannot see the reason for her fear. At last, exhausted, she falls in Gyges's arms, but the ghost points to his grave, where he awaits his guilty wife. A deathly pallor steals over her features and she sinks to the ground dead. Gyges, overcome with grief, tries to restore her to life. At this moment, Pythia appears. She tells Gyges not to grieve, but to thank Heaven for having preserved him from death and she indicates a cup of poison that Nisia had prepared for him.|$|E

It is generally realistic in tone, marked by occasional bursts of surrealism and absurdity, such as Osaka imagining Chiyo's ponytails being [...] "unscrewed" [...] <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> and an episode featuring the characters' New Year's dreams.|$|E
500|$|The first live {{performance}} of [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] {{was on the}} 1990 Blond Ambition World Tour.

Hundreds of burning candles surrounded her as she knelt {{down in front of the}} stage, the backup singers crying the words [...] "Oh my God" [...] several times. Madonna eventually removed a scarf <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> to display a huge crucifix hanging from her neck, and then rose and sang the full song, while her dancers gyrated around her. Two different performances were taped and released on video: the Blond Ambition: Japan Tour 90, taped in Yokohama, Japan, on April 27, 1990, and Blond Ambition World Tour Live, taped in Nice, France, on August 5, 1990. On his review of the latter release, Entertainment Weeklys Ty Burr praised the [...] "gymnastic dance productions in songs such as 'Where's the Party' and 'Like a Prayer'", calling them [...] "astonishing".|$|E

It {{was the first}} release from her new production company, Semtex Films and was released in both DVD and CD formats, capturing the tour as directed by Jonas Åkerlund. The DVD release consists of the full twenty-one song set list of the tour, while the CD captures thirteen highlights from the same. The tour was first shown on NBC during the Thanksgiving of 2006. This broadcast was edited, cutting the likes of [...] "Paradise (Not For Me)". Madonna's performance of [...] "Live to Tell", while hanging from a glass embellished crucifix, faced strong reaction from the media and religious groups. [...] "Live to Tell" [...] {{was followed by the}} performance of [...] "Forbidden Love" [...] from the Confessions on a Dance Floor album, where Madonna took off a crown made of thorns <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> Asian media and services company Fridae reported that the album was banned in Singapore, Malaysia and parts of East Asia, because of the inclusion of the performances in the DVD.|$|E

The leaders of the Haute Cour agreed, and Sibylla was crowned thereafter as queen regnant. Taking her choice as husband, to the astonishment of the rival court faction, she remarried Guy, who became King in August 1186. The Queen removed the crown <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> and handed it to Guy, permitting him to crown himself, at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, in September 1186.

[...] The Russian Orthodox Church had generally opposed the crowning of women prior to Peter's reign, and his decision to introduce this innovation reflected his desire to break with previous tradition and bring Russia more into line with other Western monarchies. The church incorporated these developments into its coronation ritual, retaining them through the final ceremony in 1896.
