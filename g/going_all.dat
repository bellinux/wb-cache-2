Although he can be annoyed with his protégés at times, he is visibly proud when they succeed, as Greg did by passing his field test and {{becoming}} a CSI. He is also protective of his staff and defends them as much as he can, as seen in episode 521 ("Rashomama") for example.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1955, four 12-year-old boys — Petey LaChance (Peter, with Richard Dreyfuss's voice in his head narrating the story), Quag Chambers (Quagmire), Joey Duchamp (Joe with Roy Scheider's voice in his head, who starts talking with Dreyfuss until Joe stops them), and Cleve Brown (Cleveland) — {{set out to find}} a dead body in the woods, {{following}} a set of railroad tracks to find it. At the start of their trip, they try going through Old Man Pressman's (Stewie) junkyard, only to be chased out by Pressman and his dog Chopper (Brian). As they travel further down the tracks, they are chased across a bridge by a train, which ends up running over Joey's legs, as does another train that follows closely behind, which effectively cripples him. The others end up <b>going</b> <b>all</b> the way back to Pressman's junkyard to get him a wheelchair.|$|E
5|$|The {{electric}} {{fire engine}} would have several advantages over the steam fire engine. One {{was that an}} electric fire engine could be brought eto full power immediately, whereas a steam fire engine took time. It was necessary to keep the fire <b>going</b> <b>all</b> the time to boil the water on a steam pump vehicle, with workmen furnishing coal for it. This was required so that as little time as possible was lost getting the water to boil to produce steam to run the water pump to extinguish the fire. In {{the case of an}} electric motor running a fire engine water pump, its operation was basically instantaneous since the motor was running at full power capacity when the switch was turned on. The advantage of using electricity was its lower cost overall, (i.e. no coal or extensive maintenance) and simplicity of operation.|$|E

5|$|The highway enters Geneseo {{from the}} south, taking the name Genesee Street {{as it passes}} {{the western edge of}} the campus of SUNY Geneseo. At the edge of the campus, the route crosses the Genesee River and exits Geneseo. Past the river in the town of York, NY63 begins to curve {{northwest}} up and out of the Genesee River valley until it runs east–west once again at the hamlet of Piffard. The major junction in York is the community of Greigsville, where NY63 reconnects with NY36. This next section of highway has become a major shortcut for traffic heading to the Buffalo area, despite remaining a two-lane road through open rural country, since it is both physically shorter than <b>going</b> <b>all</b> the way to the New York State Thruway as well as toll-free. Most of this Buffalo-bound traffic follows NY36 north from Mount Morris and turns on to NY63 here. Signage along this route reflects this use.|$|E

Humans have also been able to explore space with satellites (later used for telecommunication) and in manned missions <b>going</b> <b>all</b> the way to the moon.

25|$|The Free Church of Scotland was a Scottish {{denomination}} {{which was}} formed in 1843 by a large withdrawal from the established Church of Scotland in a schism or division known as the Disruption of 1843. In 1900 {{the vast majority of}} the Free Church of Scotland joined with the United Presbyterian Church of Scotland to form the United Free Church of Scotland (which itself mostly re-united with the Church of Scotland in 1929). The House of Lords judged that the minority continuing after the 1900 union were entitled to all the assets.

The plant was capable of turning out 500,000 cartridges per day, as was done during the Turkish war, and it took 50 tons of rolled brass, 100 tons of lead, and 20 tons of gunpowder weekly to keep the factory fully <b>going,</b> <b>all</b> kinds of ammunition for rifles and machine guns being made on the premises.

Batting first, RR off to a flier with Watson <b>going</b> <b>all</b> guns blazing. Though one side wickets were sliding, RR reached 185 helped by a {{magnificent}} century by Watson and some late power-hits by Stuart Binny. CSK while chasing lost Vijay cheaply once again within the Powerplays. With some fluent hits by Michael Hussey and heavy shots by RainaRaina consolidating the middle overs, CSK reached 100 in the 11th over. With Raina getting out for 55, Hussey going for well played 88 and Jadeja getting {{out in the next}} ball, CSK once again went into the danger zone. However MSD's cameo fireworks and Dwayne Bravo's last over heroics helped CSK win the match with a ball to spare. Hussey was awarded MoM for his match-winning 88 runs off 51 balls.|$|E

Williams lost in round two to Vera Zvonareva, in a match that lasted over three hours. Her next tournament was Wimbledon, where she was the defending champion. She reached the round of 16, where she lost to Marion Bartoli. After the loss her ranking dropped to 169. Williams won her first titles since her return to tennis triumphing in Stanford and Toronto. At the Western & Southern Open, Serena defeated Lucie Hradecká, only to withdraw the next day, citing a right toe injury. She then played at the US Open <b>going</b> <b>all</b> the way to the final losing to Samantha Stosur, during a match which featured her verbally abusing the chair umpire.

25|$|On March 20 {{a second}} army sent from Samarra, {{consisting}} of 4,000 Turks, North Africans and Ferghanans, arrived {{in front of}} the western side of Baghdad and made camp near the Gates of the Fief and Qatrabbul. The next morning, Muhammad b. 'Abdallah ordered a large contingent of infantry and cavalry to battle them. At first the Samarrans had the upper hand, and were able to force the Baghdadis into a narrow area near the Gate of the Fief. Baghdadi reinforcements soon arrived, however, and the combined forces were able to drive the Samarrans back. Having gained the initiative, the defenders charged and forced the Samarrans to retreat to an area where yet another Baghdadi force lay in ambush. At this point, the Samarran retreat turned into a rout, and the troops began to flee for their lives. Many attempted to swim across the Tigris to Abu Ahmad's camp, but were seized by boats patrolling the river. The rest turned north, with some of the soldiers <b>going</b> <b>all</b> the way back to Samarra.|$|E
