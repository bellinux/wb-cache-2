They are found in eastern Australia, from Queensland through New South Wales and into Victoria, and as well as New Guinea and the Aru Islands to the north.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are five}} {{vegetation}} communities within the Rosny Hill Nature Recreation Area: Grassy Eucalyptus viminalis woodland, Inland Acacia verticillata low fores, Lowland Themeda grassland, Lowland grassland complex and Bursaria-acacia woodland and scrub. [...] There are several rare and threatened native plant species, including Leafy sun orchid (Thelymitra bracteata), Grassland <b>flax</b> <b>lily</b> (Dianella amoena), Spear grass (Austrostipa nodosa), Tall wallaby grass (Austrodanthonia induta), Shade peppercress (Ledidium pseudotasmanicum), and Narrow leaf New Holland daisy (Vittadinia muelleri).|$|E
50|$|Phormium is a genus of two {{plant species}} in the Asphodelaceae family. One species is endemic to New Zealand {{and the other is}} native to New Zealand and Norfolk Island. The two species are widely known in New Zealand as 'flax' and {{elsewhere}} as New Zealand flax or <b>flax</b> <b>lily</b> but are not related to flax, which is native to the region extending from the eastern Mediterranean to India and which was used by humans in 30,000 B.C.|$|E
5000|$|During 1979, {{the island}} was {{surveyed}} {{as part of a}} study to determine the feasibility of introducing, brush-tailed bettong, a native mammal. The survey found two distinct vegetation communities that covered the island’s platform in [...] "roughly equal proportions" [...] - one being a [...] "low shrubland dominated by umbrella bush" [...] and the other being a [...] "more open grassland." [...] Thirty-nine plant species were found to be present including sticky hop-bush, shore westringia, black-anther <b>flax</b> <b>lily,</b> Australian hollyhock, various speargrass species and introduced species such as bearded oat.|$|E
50|$|As of 1996, {{the cliff}} faces were {{relatively}} un-vegetated. The islet’s summit {{was occupied by}} clumps of Coast tussock-grass with a fringing shrubland dominated by Coast Daisy-bush. The 25 other species were identified including Dry land Tea-tree, Coast Beard-heath, Common correa, Cotton bush, Thyme Riceflower, pointed twinleaf, Black-anther <b>Flax</b> <b>Lily,</b> Common Wallaby Grass and Downy Dodder-laurel. The only animal life observed in 1996 was an Osprey nest located on the islet’s northern side, white-faced storm petrels which were nesting in shallow burrows located over the entire summit and two species of lizard - the marbled gecko and the bull skink.|$|E
50|$|As of 1996, {{the flora}} is {{reported}} as {{consisting of two}} distinct areas. The coastal sand supports plants such as grey saltbush, sea spurge and two-horned sea rocket. The rest of the island supports a shrubland dominated by nitre bush and saltbush. Other species observed in the shrubland included Australian hollyhock, black-anther <b>flax</b> <b>lily,</b> bower spinach, coastal lignum, karkalla, native juniper and variable groundsel. As of 1996, the fauna was reported as consisting of the following vertebrates: five species of birds including Pacific gulls, rock parrots and a breeding colony of white-faced storm petrels, and one species of reptile, the southern grass skink.|$|E
50|$|While the {{low profile}} of the islands do limit what can grow due to wind {{exposure}} and salt spray, surveys {{have shown that the}} Northern island group (excluding the ‘small satellite islet’) has 35 plant species while the Southern group has 28 species on its north island while Lighthouse Island has 13 species. The latter is attributed to combination of the disturbance caused by activity associated with the formerly-manned lighthouse, airstrip, an introduced goat population that was eradicated in 1968 and burrows made by the large numbers of short-tailed shearwaters. Plant species include sea celery, leek lily, <b>flax</b> <b>lily,</b> coast tussock grass, salt couch, billy button daisies, variable groundsel and an introduced Northern Hemisphere grass, rat's-tail fescue.|$|E
5000|$|As of 1996, Dorothee Island {{retained}} significant soil {{around its}} twin peaks and shelter {{to support the}} following five plant associations which are informed by the specific characteristics of the soil and the associated exposure to the elements. [...] The deepest and the most sheltered granitic soils are vegetated by a heath dominated by twiggy daisy-bush followed by other heath species such as common correa, black-anther <b>flax</b> <b>lily</b> and coast beard-heath {{as well as two}} small patches of Cape Leeuwin wattle. A “calcareous sandy loam” associated with the central crevasse on the northern half of the island supports a grey saltbush heath. The granitic soils associated with the island’s southern peak support a shrubland of marsh saltbush that forms a perimeter around the twiggy daisy-bush confined to the peak. The thinnest soils support herbfields dominated by rosy stork's bill. Soils at top of the granite ridges closest to the sea are occupied by herblands of round-leaved pigface.|$|E
50|$|Edgewater Towers {{originally}} had a garden open to Marine Parade which included very limited planting, extensive pebble and decorative concrete screen block walls (Besser block). The gardens were reviewed and redesigned to incorporate DDA access by Phil Tulk, Heritage Landscape Consultant and replanted in 2012. No original 60s plantings remain. The front patio, strip and pocket gardens are planted with indigenous {{species of the}} St Kilda area including: Allocasuarina littoralis (Black Sheoke), Pomaderris paniculosa ssp. Parilia (Shining Dogwood), Atriplex cinerea (Coast salt bush), Correa reflexa (Native fuchsia), Leucophyta brownii (Pincushion bush), Dianella brevicaulis (Small flower <b>flax</b> <b>lily),</b> Goodenia ovata prostrate form (Hop Goodenia) and a Banksia. The Willow Myrtle 'Agonis' was planted in the 70s by longtime resident building manager (1969-1988 Approx.) Johannes (Jonas) LeFerink. The 'Avenue' of deciduous trees to the South is Ulmus parvifolia 'Burnley Select' (non-fruiting Chinese Elm) and the hedge is Raphiolepis Snow Maiden. In 2013 the car park was upgraded and planted with a 'Grove' of Ulmus parvifolia 'Burnley Select' (non-fruiting Chinese Elm) {{and there is a}} small herb garden.|$|E
