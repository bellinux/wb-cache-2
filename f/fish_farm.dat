In 1901, he led a team of miners and cavers to dig into Swildon's Hole, where he found the 'Forty Foot Pot' as well as chambers full of stalagmites. Despite the publicity around the find, Balch refused to disclose the location of the cave as he believed it was too dangerous for amateur explorers. The farmer who owned the land denied them entrance the following year, turning the valley into a <b>fish</b> <b>farm,</b> so the team headed upstream where they discovered Eastwater Cavern, one of Balch's personal favourites.|$|E

40|$|Problem statement: Fisheries {{sector is}} a rising sector in Bangladesh. Many farmers are {{shifting}} their rice fields to ponds for <b>fish</b> <b>farming</b> {{in the study}} areas. This transformation of farming raises a question to the researchers whether <b>fish</b> <b>farming</b> has any impact on household income or not. Thus, the researchers took the present study to identify the contribution of <b>fish</b> <b>farming</b> on household income of the fish farmers in the study areas. Approach: The population of the study consisted of all fish farmers of the selected eight villages from four sub-districts of Mymensingh district. Required data for the study were collected with questionnaire through personal interviewing of the respondent farmers. Results: Result shows that <b>fish</b> <b>farming</b> is contributing {{in a range of}} 15. 35 - 86. 63 % on household income of the respondent farmers and the average contribution of <b>fish</b> <b>farming</b> is 50. 99 % indicating major contribution of this entrepreneurship on household income of the practitioner farmers. The result of the stepwise multiple regression analysis shows that all of the income sources jointly can elucidate 98. 3 % variation on household income where <b>fish</b> <b>farming</b> alone can contribute the highest (44 %) on household income of the respondent farmers. However, the results of multiple regressions indicate that 74 % {{of the variance in the}} income from <b>fish</b> <b>farming</b> could be explained by the explanatory variables of the study. The study successfully explored following factors: age of the household head, family land holdings, pond size, training on <b>fish</b> <b>farming</b> and access to information on <b>fish</b> <b>farming</b> which can influence income from <b>fish</b> <b>farming.</b> Conclusions/Recommendations: The study reported that <b>fish</b> <b>farming</b> has significant contribution on household income of the practitioner farmers. Thus, it is essential for the policy makers in the field of fisheries to take into account the identified factors for rapid expansion of <b>fish</b> <b>farming</b> in rural Bangladesh...|$|R
5|$|The {{threat to}} humans in {{developed}} countries is rising {{as a result of}} social trends: the increase in organic farming, which uses manure and sewage sludge rather than artificial fertilizers, and spreads parasites both directly and via the droppings of seagulls which feed on manure and sludge; the increasing popularity of raw or lightly cooked foods; imports of meat, seafood and salad vegetables from high-risk areas; and, as an underlying cause, reduced awareness of parasites compared with other public health issues such as pollution. In less-developed countries, inadequate sanitation and the use of human feces (night soil) as fertilizer and to enrich <b>fish</b> <b>farm</b> ponds continues to spread parasitic platyhelminths, and poorly designed water-supply and irrigation projects have provided additional channels for their spread. People in these countries often cannot afford the cost of fuel required to cook food thoroughly enough to kill parasites. Controlling parasites that infect humans and livestock has become more difficult, as many species have become resistant to drugs that used to be effective, mainly for killing juveniles in meat. While poorer countries still struggle with unintentional infection, cases have been reported of intentional infection in the US by dieters desperate for rapid weight-loss.|$|E

25|$|Work {{continues}} on substituting vegetable proteins and protein concentrates for fish meal in the salmonid diet. As of 2014, an enzymatic {{process can be}} used to lower the carbohydrate content of barley, making it a high-protein fish feed suitable for salmon. Many other substitutions for fish meal are known, and diets containing zero fish meal are possible. For example, a planned closed containment salmon <b>fish</b> <b>farm</b> in Scotland uses ragworms, algae and amino acids as feed. However, commercial economic animal diets are determined by least cost linear programming models that are effectively competing with similar models for chicken and pig feeds for the same feed ingredients and these models show that fish meal is more useful in aquatic diets than in chicken diets, where they can make the chickens taste like fish. Unfortunately, this substitution can result in lower levels of the highly valued omega-3 content in the farmed product. However, when vegetable oil is used in the growing diet as an energy source and a different finishing diet containing high omega-3 content fatty acids from either fish oil, algae oils or some vegetable oils are used a few months before harvest, this problem is eliminated.|$|E

40|$|Aquaculture, or more {{generally}} <b>fish</b> <b>farming,</b> and fisheries interact {{in several different}} ways. First, many types of <b>fish</b> <b>farming</b> require <b>fish</b> products as inputs, mostly for feeding purposes. Second, <b>farmed</b> <b>fish</b> and wild fish products compete in fish markets with consequences for both the industry and, of course, consumers. Third, <b>fish</b> <b>farming</b> generates various types of polluting agents that may affect wild fish stocks and their habitat. Several other interactions exist. This paper is primarily concerned with {{the implications of the}} first of these interactions, namely the input relationships, for the overall supply of fish products in the future. To the extent that the <b>fish</b> <b>farming</b> industry demands wild fish products such as fish meal, fish oil, etc. as inputs, the price of these products is increased compared to what would otherwise be the case and, as a result, the price of fish landings. This encourages increased demand from the <b>fish</b> <b>farming</b> industry may – especially given the ecosystem context of most fisheries – lead to long-term fluctuations, instability and even chaotic behavior of wild fish supply. A formal model describing the above considerations is constructed. Possible schedules of global supply of fish products are calculated given various assumptions about (i) fisheries management, (ii) wild fish requirements of the <b>fish</b> <b>farming</b> industry, and (iii) technological progress in <b>fish</b> <b>farming.</b> The impact of expanding global <b>fish</b> <b>farming</b> on the wild fish industry and global supply of fish products is assessed.
