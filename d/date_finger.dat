6000|$|At last Mrs. Flushing sought {{her diary}} for help, {{the method of}} {{reckoning}} <b>dates</b> on the <b>fingers</b> proving unsatisfactory. She opened and shut every drawer in her writing-table, and then cried furiously, [...] "Yarmouth! Yarmouth! Drat the woman! She's always {{out of the way}} when she's wanted!" ...|$|R
50|$|Carousel prompts {{users to}} free local storage {{once it has}} synced and backed-up local photos to the cloud. Flashback is a feature (enabled by default) that pops up past photos or videos taken the same day a year or some years back. Flashback uses an {{algorithm}} designed to identify human faces - resulting in greater likelihood of the owner’s picture or people in owner's close circle showing up. A scrollable timeline, which was earlier a scroll wheel, at the bottom lets the user drag to photo(s) to a specific <b>date</b> with a <b>finger</b> swipe.|$|R
5000|$|Lewis Corner of Digital Spy {{gave the}} song a {{positive}} review stating: [...] "Luckily for Cardle, it's infinitely {{better than his}} Take That reject last effort. [...] "It wouldn't matter if we died tonight/ We are beautiful," [...] he proclaims over a rousing combo of weighty beats and soaring guitar riffs breezier than {{the top of the}} Blackpool tower, before unleashing his impressive vocal talents on the chorus. The result is easily his strongest offering to <b>date,</b> so <b>fingers</b> crossed it's not all in vain." [...] The Mirror was also favourable, saying [...] "Like a phoenix from the ashes, perhaps it’s not quite over yet for Matt Cardle.". Unreality Shout said [...] "There’s an pleasant enough production at work here, with meaty guitars backed up by a thumping piano chime, and there’s an almost tangible sense of optimistic anticipation for the chorus. When the chorus arrives, the tightly rounded verse structure is thrown up into the air with the arrival of raucous guitars and a soaring vocal from Cardle, but he takes his time getting the stride right." ...|$|R
6000|$|The first {{business}} on Monday morning, after the little boys {{had gone off}} for two hours to a tutor, was an examination into Marian's attainments, beginning with French and Italian reading and translation, in which she acquitted herself very well till Mrs. Lyddell came in, {{and put her in}} such a state of trepidation that she no longer knew what she was about. In truth, Marian's education had been rather irregular in consequence of her father's illness, and its effect had been to give her a general cultivation of mind, and appreciation of excellence, to train her to do her best, and fed an eagerness for information, but without instructing her in that routine of knowledge for which Mrs. Lyddell and Miss Morley looked. She was not ready in answering questions, even upon what she knew perfectly well; she had no tables of names and <b>dates</b> at <b>finger's</b> ends, and when she saw that every one thought her backward and ignorant, the feeling that she was not doing justice to her mamma's teaching added to her confusion, her mistakes and puzzles increased, and at last she was almost ready to cry. At that moment Caroline said, [...] "Mamma, you have not seen Marian's drawings yet. Do fetch them, Marian." ...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades, {{research}} groups in both academia and private industry have developed key technologies, including viral delivery vectors and engineered transposon-based or zinc finger protein-based nucleases, towards achieving the long-sought goal of therapeutic genome editing in humans. To <b>date,</b> Zinc <b>Finger</b> Nucleases (ZFNs) {{have been the most}} promising reagents for potential therapeutic applications in humans, but the recently characterized Transcription Activator Like Effector (TALE) proteins may soon change this status quo. Although {{it remains to be seen}} whether nucleases based on these proteins (TALENs) will be as broadly applicable and effective as ZFNs, based on initial reports, TALENs look very promising. Currently, the primary advantage of TALENs is that the DNA binding code for TALENs appears to be simple and robust, making their synthesis relatively simple. In this dissertation, I summarize advances made in the field of genome editing over the past decade and compare and contrast the currently available tools, focusing on ZFNs and TALENs. Specifically, I describe our efforts to make ZFN technology more accessible by designing and implementing models to help researchers choose target sites that are most amenable to targeting using ZFNs. Also, to help explore the potential of TALENs as tools for genome editing, I describe the development of a simple protocol to aid in constructing TALENs. As ZFNs become easier to use, and TALENs become more robust, the use of genome editing techniques as therapeutics appears poised to become reality in the near future...|$|R
5000|$|In {{keeping with}} the {{approach}} established for Spite, Marionette assembled a production team for Enemies which included Pontus Hjelm (Dead by April) and two-time Swedish Grammy award winning producer Åke Parmerud. Fredrik Nordström (In Flames, At the Gates, Bring Me the Horizon) and Peter In De Betou (Dimmu Borgir, Meshuggah) handled mixing and mastering duties respectively. [...] "Enemies" [...] was born to critical acclaim upon its European release in late 2009 and early 2010 in North America and Japan. Special recognition {{was given to the}} band’s aggressive sound, “stylistic depth”, “technical cohesion”, and an intrinsic ability to walk the line between relentless heaviness and commercial appeal (Kerrang! magazine). [...] Heavy touring followed including Scandinavian <b>dates</b> with Five <b>Finger</b> Death Punch and Shadows Fall in November 2009 and European and UK tour with Blessthefall. [...] "Enemies" [...] was nominated for a Swedish Metal Award in the category of “Best Death Metal Album” of 2009.|$|R
5000|$|In Western cultures, {{a wedding}} ring is {{traditionally}} worn on the ring finger. This developed from the Roman [...] "anulus pronubis" [...] when the man gave a ring to {{the woman at the}} betrothal ceremony. Blessing the wedding ring and putting it on the bride's <b>finger</b> <b>dates</b> from the 11th century. In medieval Europe, the Christian wedding ceremony placed the ring in sequence on the thumb, index, middle, and ring fingers of the left hand. The ring was then left on the ring finger. In a few European countries, the ring is worn on the left hand prior to marriage, then transferred to the right during the ceremony. For example, a Greek Orthodox bride wears the ring on the left hand prior to the ceremony, then moves it to the right hand after the wedding. In England, the 1549 Prayer Book declared [...] "the ring shall be placed on the left hand". By the 17th and 18th centuries the ring could be found on any finger after the ceremony — even on the thumb.|$|R
40|$|A 69 -year-old man {{presented}} with a 20 -year history of a slowly enlarging mass of the left index <b>finger</b> <b>dating</b> from a hammer injury. The mass was excised, and seen to have the characteristic histological appearance of an elastofibroma, a benign tumour-like growth usually found in the soft tissue of the back Such a lesion has not previously been documented in the hand, which we consider surprising {{in view of the}} generally accepted traumatic aetiology of this entity and the susceptibility of the hand to injury. Elastofibroma characteristically presents as a painless, slow-growing soft-tissue mass in patients over the age of 50. It is usually firm to the touch and not attached to the overlying skin. Pathological examination reveals an unencapsulated tumour-like proliferation ofcollagen and elastic fibres with relatively sparse fibroblasts. There is also a variable amount of interstitial ground substance, and some mature fat cells may be included (Enzinger and Weiss 1983). First described by J#{ 228 }rviand Saxen in 1961, most cases then and subsequently have been situated in the soft tissue beneath the scapula. However, lesions with an identical appearance have been documented in other sites such as the right breast, lateral chest wal...|$|R
5000|$|... "On the 24th of April, 2013, I {{went into}} Blast Studios, Newcastle, UK {{to record a}} {{souvenir}} CD for the Acoustic tour in May/June. With the help of studio engineer, Mark Broughton I started recording at 11.00AM and finished at 17.10PM. It was just myself on an acoustic with a few mikes placed around me. Most of the tracks were first takes apart from Meat Abstract where I was finding my feet, Our Love Must Die because I forgot the lyrics and had to Google them and a new song, Meltdown Bound which I had to abandon for a later <b>date</b> as my <b>fingers</b> were too tired to play the tricky fingerpicking bits I'd written a few days earlier.It's mostly Therapy? tunes but also some new ones, written in the previous couple of weeks especially for the session. The track Lost In Care was written for the 'A Brief Crack of Light' album but only a snippet of it {{was used in the}} track The Buzzing. We also meant to record Living in the Shadow of the Terrible Thing, Exiles, Crooked Timber and Six Mile Water but ran out of time.Thanks very much for coming to the show and picking up this CD, I hope you enjoy it and thanks also for your continued support of Therapy? After this short tour we'll be getting together to work on our next album and look forward to seeing you all soon.Best, Andy C 30/4/13"- (liner notes) ...|$|R
