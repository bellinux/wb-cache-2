40|$|Following the {{philosophy}} of embodiment of Merleau-Ponty, Jonas and others, enactivism is a pivot point from which various areas of science can be brought into a fruitful dialogue {{about the nature of}} subjectivity. In this chapter we present the enactive conception of agency, which, in contrast to current mainstream theories of agency, is deeply and strongly embodied. In line with this thinking we argue that anything that ought to be considered a <b>genuine</b> <b>agent</b> is a biologically embodied (even if distributed) agent, and that this embodiment must be affectively lived. However, we also consider that such an affective agent is not necessarily also an agent imbued with an explicit sense of subjectivity. To support this contention we outline the interoceptive foundation of basic agency and argue that there is a qualitative difference in the phenomenology of agency when it is instantiated in organisms which, due to their complexity and size, require a nervous system to underpin their physiological and sensorimotor processes. We argue that this interoceptively grounded agency not only entails affectivity but also forms the necessary basis for subjectivity...|$|E
40|$|Author cannot archive publisher's version/PDF. The United Nations Millennium Development Goals (2000 − 2015) {{are clearly}} {{embedded}} in South Africa’s education policy documents. However, {{they are not}} adequately infused into the curriculum. This article focuses specifically on the third Millennium Development Goal (MDG) − promoting gender equality and empowering women − {{and the need to}} place this curriculum content at the centre and not on the periphery, to achieve its goal. Qualitative document research was used to explore the extent to which South Africa’s curriculummaking has promoted gender equality and the empowerment of women during the promotion of the 2000 – 2015 MDGs. The findings of this research show potential intersections of poverty, age and worldviews with gender; a stronger focus on human rights values; and concrete strategies to combat unhealthy sexual behaviour. However, the curriculum continues to be saturated with negative perspectives and binary perceptions of gender. There is also a lack of attention to the world of work. The assumption underlying this seems to be that gender equality and the empowerment of women are unattainable or that they are unimportant. This article concludes by underlining the need for the curriculum to be a <b>genuine</b> <b>agent</b> of change, which necessitates a new gender discourse in curriculum-making. [URL]...|$|E
25|$|There are {{no clear}} {{criteria}} {{set by the}} government in terms of the requirements needed to issue an agency licence. In order to open an agency, an agent must place a $33,500 non-interest-bearing guarantee in Bank de l’Habitat which is the government's Housing Bank.

40|$|In this paper, I {{examine a}} variety of agents that appear in Kantian ethics in order to {{determine}} which would be necessary to make a robot a <b>genuine</b> moral <b>agent.</b> However, building such an agent would require that we structure into a robot’s behavioral repertoire the possibility for immoral behavior, for only then can the moral law, according to Kant, manifest itself as an ought, a prerequisite for being able to hold an agent morally accountable for its actions. Since building a moral robot requires the possibility of immoral behavior, I go on to argue that we cannot morally want robots to be <b>genuine</b> moral <b>agents,</b> but only beings that simulate moral behavior. Finally, I raise but do not answer the question that if morality requires us to want robots that are not <b>genuine</b> moral <b>agents,</b> why should we want something different in the case of human beings. The newly emerging area of robot ethics raises questions that shed light not only on how we might make robots behave in morally acceptable ways, but also on how morality applies in the case of human beings.

40|$|Are companies, churches, {{and states}} <b>genuine</b> <b>agents?</b> Or {{are they just}} {{collections}} of individual agents that give a misleading impression of unity? This question is important, since the answer dictates how we should explain the behaviour of these entities and whether we should treat them as responsible and accountable {{on the model of}} individual agents. Group Agency offers a new approach to that question and is relevant, therefore, to a range of fields from philosophy to law, politics, and the social sciences. Christian List and Philip Pettit argue that there really are group or corporate agents, over and above the individual agents who compose them, and that a proper approach to the social sciences, law, morality, and politics must take account of this fact. Unlike some earlier defences of group agency, their account is entirely unmysterious in character and, despite not being technically difficult, is grounded in cutting-edge work in social choice theory, economics, and philosophy...|$|R
40|$|In A Metaphysics for Freedom (Steward, Helen. A Metaphysics for Freedom. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012) {{and related}} papers, Helen Steward {{advances}} a new argument for incompatibilism. Though she {{concedes that the}} luck objection is persuasive with regard to existing versions of libertarianism, she claims that agency itself is incompatible with determinism: we are only agents at all if {{we are able to}} settle matters concerning our movements, where settling something requires that prior to our settling it lacked sufficient conditions. She argues that <b>genuine</b> <b>agents</b> settle very fine-grained aspects of their movements: when and how they move, even when and how their neurons fire. In this paper, I advance two linked arguments against agency incompatibilism. I argue, first, that we do not exercise direct control over the fine-grained aspects of our movements. Rather, we control these movements indirectly, by intentionally engaging in broadly individuated action types (regarding which Steward concedes that the compatibilist has a plausible story to tell). Second, I argue that these aspects of our movements are lucky for us and, since this is true, they cannot play the role of grounding our agency. 14 page(s...|$|R

5|$|Moreover, by compromising CIA methods, Ames {{enabled the}} KGB and its successor, the SVR, to filter feed {{material}} to the CIA from 1986 to 1993. In 1987, KGB agent Aleksandr Zhomov offered to sell the CIA intelligence on how the Soviets had detected and arrested the CIA's agents. The SE Division accepted Zhomov and assigned him the cryptonym GTPROLOGUE. Zhomov, who was actually a Soviet double agent assigned to protect Ames, furnished fake documents ascribing the CIA's agent losses to superior KGB surveillance and luck. He then told the CIA that he would identify upcoming KGB plants, but only {{on the condition that}} the CIA treat them as genuine, lest the KGB discover the leak and arrest him. The fake agents soon overwhelmed Moscow Station's resources, and Zhomov disappeared in July 1990 after receiving payment from the U.S. The spurious sources and the disinformation they provided reportedly convinced the CIA that the 1985–1986 debacle was an anomaly, thus protecting Ames. Other <b>genuine</b> CIA <b>agents</b> were compromised by the Soviets, who used them to feed false intelligence back to the U.S.|$|R
40|$|The current paper {{investigates the}} phenomenological aspects of “selves ” in {{relation}} to autonomous agents. Through a review {{of a series of}} neuro-robotics experiments conducted by the author’s group, we elucidate three different as-pects of “selves”, namely, minimal selves, social selves and self-referential selves. Upon integrative discussions of these “selves”, it is suggested that genuine con-structs of “authentic ” selves may appear with criticality, which is self-organized in the iterative interplay between regression of past experience and lookahead prediction of future outcomes. It is concluded that <b>genuine</b> autonomy of <b>agents</b> likely originates from genuine autonomy of authentic selves. 1 Adaptive Behavior, Vol, 17, No. 5, pp. 421 - 443, 2009...|$|R

40|$|In its January 20 th, 2010 {{decision}} in Citizens United vs. Federal Election Commission, the United States Supreme Court ruled that certain restrictions on independent expenditures by corporations for political advocacy violate the First Amendment of the Constitution, which provides that “Congress shall make no law […] abridging {{the freedom of}} speech, or of the press; or {{the right of the}} people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. ” Justice Kennedy, writing for the 5 - 4 majority, held that “[b]y suppressing the speech of manifold corporations, both for-profit and non-profit, the Government prevents their voices and view-points from reaching the public and advising voters on which person or entities are hostile to their interests” (Citizens United vs. Federal Election Commission 558 U. S. 38 - 9 (2010); emphasis added). Much of the language of the opinion, and some of its reasoning, as this passage illustrates, presupposes that corporations are agents capable of speech, and that it is (at least in part) in the light of this that limitations on political advocacy by corporations are prohibited by the Constitution. While there are other strands in the argument, they are interwoven with the conception of the corporation as agent and speaker, with its voice and its viewpoints. The dissenters on the court objected on precisely this point (among others). Justice Stevens wrote sarcastically in his dissent, joined by Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, and Sotomayor, that “[u]nder the majority’s view, I suppose it may be a First Amendment problem that corporations are not permitted to vote, given that voting is, among other things, a form of speech” (558 U. S. 33 (2010)). Justice Sotomayor suggested in oral argument that the Court’s century-old practice of treating corporations as persons rests on a conceptual mistake. My concern in this essay is not with the question whether the restrictions violate the Constitution. There are many issues that bear on this which will be outside the scope of my discussion. My concern is with the proper conceptual framework for understanding the agency of corporations and corporate speech, and the role that conceptions of these play in the background of the majority’s reasoning. The issue is legal, but it also has philosophical, conceptual and semantic aspects. It will be the latter aspects, and their potential to shed light on legal reasoning, that are my main focus. An adequate framework requires saying what properly speaking the corporation is, how agency is expressed through the corporation, whose agency it is, centrally whether the corporation is an agent or person in its own right, and in what sense it can be said to be capable of speech. I draw on recent work in collective action theory, particularly with respect to the semantics of collective action sentences (Ludwig 2007) and the analysis of the proxy agency in collective action (Ludwig 2014), to show (i) that corporations are neither <b>genuine</b> <b>agents</b> nor (therefore) capable of engaging in genuine speech, (ii) that consequently the First Amendment does not apply to corporations per se, and (iii) that a better understanding of the mechanisms of corporate agency casts doubt on more indirect arguments for extending the First Amendment to “corporate speech” as well...|$|R
5000|$|According to Pavel Sudoplatov, Operation Berezino was {{conceived}} by the NKVD officers Victor Ilyin and Mikhail Maklyarsky {{as an extension}} of Operation Monastyr (1941-1944). In 1941 NKVD operative Alexander Demyanov (Soviet codename Heyne, German codename Max), wearing a persona of a disgruntled bohemian socialite, established contact with the German resident in Moscow. The NKVD used this opportunity to expose the undercover network of the Abwehr in the Soviet Union. In December 1941 Demyanov [...] "defected" [...] to the German side and showed up at the Abwehr field office in Smolensk. Three months later he returned to Moscow as a trusted German agent. His apartment became a death trap for scores of <b>genuine</b> German <b>agents</b> but he retained the trust of his German superiors. In the middle of 1942, Demyanov's control officer Willie Fischer expanded the operation into a strategic level disinformation campaign. For more than two years, Demyanov supplied Reinhard Gehlen, the head of the Fremde Heere Ost (Foreign Armies East) department of the Oberkommando des Heeres (OKH, German Army High Command), with carefully scripted [...] "military plans". According to Sudoplatov, the German success in repelling the Soviet Rzhev offensive were, in part, influenced by correct information fed to Gehlen through Demyanov. The intent of feeding the Germans information about an operation, was to conduct strategic deception to distract the Germans from the simultaneous Operation Uranus in the south. The Germans were indeed surprised by the latter attack, resulting in the encirclement and eventual surrender of the German 6th Army at Stalingrad.|$|R

40|$|It is {{postulated}} that peptides {{derived from the}} N-terminal region of Annexin A 1, a glucocorticoid-regulated 37 -kDa protein, could act as biomimetics of the parent protein. However, recent evidence, amongst which the ability to interact with distinct receptors other then that described for Annexin A 1, suggest that these peptides might fulfil other functions at variance to those reported for the parent protein. Here we tested the ability of peptide Ac 2 - 26 to induce chemotaxis of human neutrophils, showing that this peptide can elicit responses comparable to those produced by the canonical activator formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (or FMLP). However, whilst disruption of the chemical gradient abolished the FMLP response, addition of peptide Ac 2 - 26 in the top well of the chemotaxis chamber did not affect (10 &# 181;M) or augmented (at 30 &# 181;M) the neutrophil locomotion to the bottom well, as elicited by 10 &# 181;M peptide Ac 2 - 26. Intriguingly, the sole addition of peptide Ac 2 - 26 in the top wells produced a marked migration of neutrophils. A similar behaviour was observed when human primary monocytes were used. Thus, peptide Ac 2 - 26 is a <b>genuine</b> chemokinetic <b>agent</b> towards human blood leukocytes. Neutralization strategies indicated that engagement of either the GPCR termed FPR 1 or its cognate receptor FPR 2 /ALX was sufficient to sustain peptide Ac 2 - 26 induced neutrophil migration. Similarly, application of pharmacological inhibitors showed that cell locomotion to peptide Ac 2 - 26 was mediated primarily by the ERK, but not the JNK and p 38 pathways. In conclusion, we report here novel in vitro properties for peptide Ac 2 - 26, promoting neutrophil and monocyte chemokinesis, a process that may contribute to accelerate the resolution phase of inflammation. Here we postulate that the generation Annexin A 1 N-terminal peptides {{at the site of}} inflammation may expedite the egress of migrated leukocytes thus promoting the return to homeostasis...|$|R
40|$|The Crofters Commission is {{responsible}} for the regulation of crofting. In recent years it has developed its advocacy work. The Crofters Commission is one of many government and non-governmental agencies operating in the Highlands and Islands. The region has been considered a 'problem' area requiring government intervention for over a century. Today, in keeping with trends across Europe, there has been a shift towards a decentralised territorial policy of integrated sustainable rural development, with increased use of partnerships between the public, private and voluntary sectors. Arguments persist that subsidy should be increasingly directed towards the development of new activities, and away from declining primary sectors. A bottom up approach to rural development has been encouraged, and emphasis has been placed on the added value of locally specific environmental and cultural amenities in support of small and medium sized diversified enterprises. Investment in telecommunications infrastructure, transport, training and education are considered quasi public goods that are essential to enterprise. This research has explored the way in which croft households are mediating and negotiating such changes. The study is based on indepth, open ended qualitative interviews with croft households, rural development managers, and executive and media actors. An inductive eclectic methodology has been used. Particular {{attention has been paid to}} the value rationality and context dependence of why people act, its social construction. The research concludes that crofting as a distinctive way of life, typified by a tradition of pluriactivity, varied in detail according to the local context. Many croft households are adapting to meet the challenge of new circumstances, and utilising croft land as the base for diverse business activities. There are generational differences in attitude to crofter forestry, and environmental schemes. Local knowledge of the way of life was recognised by agencies as an essential requirement for their staff in order to progress schemes. The research concludes that the penetration of croft household members into management positions within the main agencies working in the Highland and Islands is creating an interesting dynamic. They spoke of competition amongst agencies, despite the public profile of partnership working. They commented that bottom-up development often had to work to very strict criteria that was top down. The problem of short term funding was articulated repeatedly. A key argument put forward for local empowerment stressed the need to develop capacity building within communities, to create <b>genuine</b> community <b>agents</b> rather than agency agents. A positive media profile was important to all agencies. A need for more lateral thinking was called for. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|The {{kinetics}} and thermodynamics of the addition-fragmentation equilibrium in fluorodithioformate (S=C(F) SR; F-RAFT) mediated polymerization of styrene and {{vinyl acetate}} were investigated via high-level ab initio molecular orbital calculations. The fragmentation efficiencies {{of a wide}} range of leaving groups (R = C(CH 3) 2 CN, CH 2 CN, C(CH 3) 2 Ph, CH(Ph) CH 3, CH 2 Ph, CH(COOCH 3) CH 3, CH 2 COOCH 3, CH(OCOCH 3), CH 2 -OCOCH 3, C(CH 3) 3, CH 2 CH 3, CH 3) were also investigated. The calculations confirm earlier predictions, on the basis of thermodynamic considerations alone, that these agents are likely to function as <b>genuine</b> multipurpose RAFT <b>agents.</b> Thus, stable propagating radicals (as in styrene polymerization) are capable of adding to the RAFT agent with high rate coefficients (1. 8 × 106 L mol- 1 s- 1 at 333. 15 K), comparable to those observed with normal dithioesters such as S=C(CH 3) SR (3. 8 × 106 L mol- 1 s - 1). Concurrently, unstable propagating radicals (as in vinyl acetate polymerization) are capable of undergoing fragmentation with significantly higher rate coefficients (1. 7 × 104 s - 1) than that for S=C(CH 3) SR (8. 4 s- 1) and are not expected to be rate retarded. On the basis of an examination of leaving group abilities and known reinitiation rate coefficients, the agents S=C(F) SC(CH 3) 2 CN or S=C(F) SC(CH 3) 2 Ph are identified as optimal F-RAFT agents for styrene polymerization, while S=C(F) SCH 2 -CN or S=C(F) SC(CH 3) 3 are identified as optimal F-RAFT agents for vinyl acetate and ethylene polymerization. The potential suitability of employing F-RAFT to invoke living free radical polymerization of ethylene has been tested by a general kinetic screening exercise as well as specific simulations that employ quantum chemically predicted F-RAFT rate coefficients. These results indicate that F-RAFT is expected to control ethylene free radical polymerization. © 2006 American Chemical Society...|$|R
40|$|The ritual {{process is}} complex. The {{following}} lines {{intend to be}} a guide to enter {{the world of the}} ritual and its implications. This brief approach will invite us to reflect on the place the symbolic occupies in our modern society. To a greater or lesser extent we all have had experiences that invite us to think that there exist at least two ways of being in the world and hence of representing it. It is not in vain that there exist manifestations such as the musicality of poetry, the imagination of child play, or the harmonious sensation of a musical piece. These manifestations being real and lived as non tangible realities offer a vision of the world that is different to that offered by manifestations such as a military harangue or the cleaning of the vehicle. We feel that there exist at least two ways of being in the world, of representing the world. At the risk of simplifying excessively we are going to name these two ways “aesthetic ” and “instrumental”. We understand by “aesthetic ” what Kant pointed out in his Critique of Judgement (1790) when he defined it as “a purpose with no aim ” and by “instrumental ” the attitude that pursues an aim. The aesthetic attitude or the “aesthetic way of contemplating the world ” is generally opposed to the practical attitude. The <b>genuine</b> real estate <b>agent</b> who contemplates a scenery thinking only of its monetary value is not contemplating it aesthetically. To do so we have to “ perceive it for perceiving it”, with no other intention. We have to savour the experience of perceiving the scenery itself focusing on its perceptive details instead of using the perceived object as a means for some other end. Naturally, we could object that even in the aesthetic contemplation we do not observe something “for itself ” but for some other reason, for example, for the pleasure it gives us. We would not continues {{to pay attention to the}} perceived object if to do so was not pleasant for us. According to this, will not enjoyment be the aim in the aesthetic case?
