25|$|The recent {{disruption}} of the Status quo ante in the <b>Kodori</b> <b>Valley</b> in Abkhazia led to a further downturn in the already tensed Russian-Georgian relations.|$|E
25|$|August 9 - A second {{front was}} opened by the {{military}} of the separatist Republic of Abkhazia in the <b>Kodori</b> <b>Valley,</b> the only region of Abkhazia effectively controlled by Georgia.|$|E
25|$|After the 1992-1993 War the Upper <b>Kodori</b> <b>Valley</b> was {{the only}} part of the country that was not {{controlled}} by the Abkhazian government. It remained under the formal control of Georgian authorities however it was mainly run by a local strongman Emzar Kvitsiani. As a result of the 2006 Kodori crisis Georgia reasserted its power in the valley. Abkhazians claimed that the infiltration of the territory by Georgian armed units was a violation of the Agreement on the Ceasefire and Disengagement of Forces of May 14, 1994, however Georgia maintained that only police and security forces were employed there. Abkhaz forces occupied <b>Kodori</b> <b>Valley</b> in August 2008 as a result of an operation that coincided with the 2008 South Ossetia War.|$|E
25|$|The Government of the Autonomous Republic of Abkhazia is the {{government}} in exile that Georgia recognises as the legal government of Abkhazia. This pro-Georgian government maintained a foothold on Abkhazian territory, in the upper <b>Kodori</b> <b>Valley</b> from July 2006 until it was forced out by fighting in August 2008. This government is also {{partly responsible for the}} affairs of some 250,000 IDPs, forced to leave Abkhazia following the War in Abkhazia and ethnic cleansing that followed. The current Head of the Government is Vakhtang Kolbaia.|$|E
25|$|Eduard Shevardnadze {{left the}} city {{narrowly}} escaping death. Soon Abkhaz forces and the Confederates overran the whole territory of Abkhazia, but the <b>Kodori</b> <b>Valley</b> remained in Georgian hands. The total defeat of Georgian forces was accompanied by the ethnic cleansing of the Georgian population. As {{a result of the}} war, more than 250,000 people (mainly Georgians, also Greeks and others) fled from or were forced out of Abkhazia. In September 1994, several reports indicated ethnic clashes between Abkhaz and Armenians, a significant part of whom supported the former during the war. Chechen militants of the CMPC later left Abkhazia {{to take part in the}} First Chechen War with Russia.|$|E
25|$|On 8 October 2001, a UNOMIG {{helicopter}} {{was shot down}} in Georgia in <b>Kodori</b> <b>Valley</b> gorge near Abkhazia, amid fighting between Chechens and Abkhazians, killing nine including five UN observers. Georgia denied having troops in the area, and the suspicion fell on the armed group headed by Chechen warlord Ruslan Gelayev, who was speculated to have been hired by the Georgian government to wage proxy war against separatist Abkhazia. On 2 March 2004, following a number of cross-border raids from Georgia into Chechnya, Ingushetia, and Dagestan, Gelayev {{was killed in a}} clash with Russian border guards while trying to get back from Dagestan into Georgia.|$|E
25|$|August 12 - Russian President Medvedev {{said that}} he had ordered an end to {{military}} operations in Georgia. However, Russian air raids did not stop in Georgia. Russian troops drove through Poti and took up positions around it. After an end to hostilities was announced, Gori was shelled by artillery for the first time. A fragmentation shell exploded at a press center, which killed a Dutch journalist and also damaged the neighbouring buildings and lone open shop. Abkhaz forces captured the <b>Kodori</b> <b>Valley,</b> from which Georgian military and civilians had fled. French President Nicolas Sarkozy mediated a ceasefire plan between Russia and Georgia, which included provision to withdraw all troops to the lines they held before the war broke out.|$|E
500|$|United Kingdom – British Foreign Secretary David Miliband said on 9 August, [...] "Russia has {{extended}} the fighting today well beyond South Ossetia, attacking the Georgian port of Poti, {{and the town}} of Gori, while Abkhaz forces have been shelling Georgian positions in the Upper <b>Kodori</b> <b>valley.</b> I deplore this." ...|$|E
500|$|At the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg in January 2005, Georgian {{president}} Saakashvili {{proposed a}} peace settlement for South Ossetia within a unified Georgian state. The proposal {{was rejected by}} South Ossetian president Eduard Kokoity. In 2006, Georgia sent security forces to the <b>Kodori</b> <b>Valley</b> region of Abkhazia, when a local militia leader rebelled against Georgian authorities. In 2007, Georgia established what Russia called a [...] "puppet government" [...] in South Ossetia, led by Dmitry Sanakoyev (former South Ossetian prime minister), calling it a provisional administration.|$|E
2500|$|President of Abkhazia Sergei Bagapsh said 1,000 {{troops were}} sent to the <b>Kodori</b> <b>Valley.</b> The {{mobilisation}} of reservists to reinforce positions was announced by him. He warned Abkhazia was ready to [...] "enforce order" [...] and would push further in case of Georgian resistance. That day, it was reported that separatist military was also concentrating on the border of Zugdidi Municipality. On the same day, Abkhaz president also accused Georgia of [...] "genocide". That day, Russia was accused of having sent 150 tanks and 10 thousand troops to Abkhazia by Georgian president Saakashvili.|$|E
2500|$|In July 2006, the Georgian {{police and}} {{security}} forces {{took control of the}} <b>Kodori</b> <b>Valley,</b> hitherto controlled by the local Georgian militias led by the defiant commander Emzar Kvitsiani. Georgian officials claimed that the Russian security services were behind the 2006 Kodori crisis, while Russian and Abkhaz authorities accused Georgia of violation of the previous ceasefire agreements by deploying an armed force in the Valley. [...] In September 2006, the area was officially renamed Upper Abkhazia by the Georgian government and declared to be the [...] "temporary administrative center" [...] of Abkhazia until the conflict is resolved.|$|E
2500|$|In late April 2008, Russia {{said that}} Georgia was {{amassing}} 1,500 soldiers and {{police in the}} upper Kodori Gorge area and planning to invade Abkhazia. President Saakashvili, in his televised address, pledged to pursue only a peaceful line in the conflict areas and called upon the Abkhaz and Ossetians to unite with Georgia in defying attempts by [...] "outrageous and irresponsible" [...] external force to trigger bloodshed. Russia accused Georgia of {{trying to solve the}} Abkhazia problem by force and of sending its troops in the Georgian-controlled upper <b>Kodori</b> <b>Valley</b> in Abkhazia. Russia announced it would increase its military in the region and threatened to [...] "retaliate" [...] militarily to Georgia's efforts. The Georgian Prime Minister Lado Gurgenidze said Georgia would treat any additional troops in Abkhazia as aggressors. The European Union also urged caution, saying to increase troop numbers would be [...] "unwise". The United States called on Russia [...] "to reconsider" [...] "some provocative steps" [...] it had taken in respect of Abkhazia.|$|E
2500|$|On 13 October 2006, the UN Security Council {{unanimously}} {{adopted a}} resolution, {{based on a}} Group of Friends of the Secretary-General draft, extending the UNOMIG mission until 15 April 2007. Acknowledging that the [...] "new and tense situation" [...] resulted, at least in part, from the Georgian special forces' operation in the upper <b>Kodori</b> <b>Valley,</b> the resolution urged the country {{to ensure that no}} troops unauthorised by the Moscow ceasefire agreement were present in that area. It urged the leadership of the Abkhaz side to address seriously the need for a dignified, secure return of refugees and internally displaced persons and to reassure the local population in the Gali district that their residency rights and identity will be respected. The Georgian side is [...] "once again urged to address seriously legitimate Abkhaz security concerns, to avoid steps that could be seen as threatening and to refrain from militant rhetoric and provocative actions, especially in upper Kodori Valley." ...|$|E
2500|$|The UAV {{incident}} {{triggered a}} new rise in tensions between the two countries. Russia accused Georgia of trying to exploit the NATO support to solve the Abkhazia problem by force and of sending its troops into the Georgia-controlled upper <b>Kodori</b> <b>Valley</b> in northeast Abkhazia. However, the U.N. monitors in Abkhazia stated earlier in April they did not observe any military buildup {{on either side of}} the demilitarization line. On April 29, Russia announced it would increase its military presence in the region and threatened to retaliate militarily against Georgia’s efforts. According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, it increased the number of its peacekeepers in Abkhazia to 2,542 peacekeepers, which is 458 short of the 3,000 limit set by agreement. The Georgian Prime Minister Lado Gurgenidze said Georgia would treat any additional troops in Abkhazia as aggressors, while President Saakashvili, in his televised address, pledged to pursue only a peaceful line in the conflict areas and called upon the Abkhaz and Ossetians to unite with Georgia in defying attempts by [...] "outrageous and irresponsible external force to trigger bloodshed". The European Union also urged caution, saying that to increase troop numbers would be [...] "unwise" [...] given current tensions, while the United States called on Russia [...] "to reconsider some provocative steps" [...] it had taken in respect of Georgia’s breakaway region Abkhazia. Georgia also suspended the talks regarding Russia's admission to the World Trade Organization (WTO) and threatened to veto the process. Georgian officials claim Russia is changing facts on the ground in order to make it impossible for NATO foreign ministers to give Georgia a Membership Action Plan when they meet in December 2008. In the meantime, the Russian Cossacks and North Caucasian mountaineers declared their readiness to fight Georgia again in the case of a renewed confrontation in Abkhazia as they did early in the 1990s. On May 6, 2008, the Georgian state minister for reintegration Temur Iakobashvili said Georgia was on the verge of war with Russia. Georgia requested the U.N. mission to inquire into the number and deployment of the Russian peacekeeping troops in Abkhazia. The Russian Ministry of Defense claimed that the chief U.N. observer [...] "agreed that actions by the Russian side do not contradict basic agreements on the conduct of the peacekeeping operation", but the mission later responded to this statement, declaring that it [...] "has no authority to pronounce on the conformity between the CIS peacekeeping operation in the Zone of the Georgian-Abkhaz Conflict and CIS rules." ...|$|E
50|$|On {{the morning}} of 9 August 2008, the Abkhaz de facto deputy defense {{minister}} requested, that UNOMIG should withdraw its observers from the Upper <b>Kodori</b> <b>Valley.</b> UNOMIG then withdrew all 15 observers from the Upper <b>Kodori</b> <b>Valley.</b> The Abkhaz de facto authorities announced a decision, taken by president Bagapsh, to expel the Georgian armed forces from the Upper <b>Kodori</b> <b>Valley.</b> On the afternoon, UNOMIG reported aerial bombardments of Georgian villages in the Upper <b>Kodori</b> <b>Valley.</b> On 10 August, the president of Abkhazia, Sergei Bagapsh, gave a press conference where he announced that their operation in the Upper <b>Kodori</b> <b>Valley</b> was proceeding according to plan. He gave both Georgian civilians and armed personnel an ultimatum to leave the Upper <b>Kodori</b> <b>Valley.</b> He also said, {{that the government of}} Abkhazia had requested Russia to take measures to strengthen the Abkhaz maritime border. Bagapsh said, that his decision to start a military operation against the Upper <b>Kodori</b> <b>Valley</b> was approved by the parliament.|$|E

50|$|The Battle of the <b>Kodori</b> <b>Valley</b> was a {{military}} operation during the Russo-Georgian War in the Upper <b>Kodori</b> <b>Valley</b> of Abkhazia, a breakaway region of Georgia. It was {{the only part of}} Abkhazia, which was under Georgian control before this military conflict. On 9 August 2008, the Abkhaz military, with support by Russian forces, launched an operation to remove the remaining Georgian troops from the disputed gorge. After three days, the Georgian military left the Upper <b>Kodori</b> <b>Valley.</b>|$|E
