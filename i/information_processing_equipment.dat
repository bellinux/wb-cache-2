5000|$|The major {{variables}} of any theory of social production are production factors, which are some universal characteristics of production processes and are considered as original sources of value. In classical political economy (Smith, Marx, Ricardo), it is human efforts (labour) , which are measured in working hours. Neoclassical practice [...] adds capital , {{which is a}} money estimate of production equipment, that is value of the collection of all energy-conversion machines and <b>information</b> <b>processing</b> <b>equipment,</b> plus ancillary structures to contain and move them, including residential housing, when one considers capital in a wider sense. The earliest theories assumed, that output [...] {{can be considered a}} function of labour [...] and capital , as creative factors of production, This relation formalised the concept of neo-classical political economy about substitution of labour by capital. There can be different realisation of the above function. The next important step to the understanding of economic growth was done {{in the middle of the}} past century. To incorporate into the theory technological progress, which is believed is ultimately the source of economic growth in developed countries in recent centuries, it was suggested [...] to modify concepts of arguments in the production function and consider them to be not capital and expenditures of labour, but services of the capital [...] and work , so thatThe quantity [...] and [...] are capital and labour services which are connected with measured quantities of capital stock [...] and labour , but are somewhat different from them. In other words, an extra time dependence of the production function (so called exogenous technological progress) has to be assumed. This approach describes the empirical data by use of the two production factors and some empirical quantity called total factor productivity. Suggesting that capital service [...] can be considered as an independent variable, whereas labour service [...] is regarded just as labour, one came to the formulation of technological theory, in which, taking also capital stock [...] into account, production of value [...] can be considered as a function of the three production factorsThis function can also be compared with the previous equation, in which capital as variable played two distinctive roles: capital stock as value of production equipment and capital service as a substitute of labour. The only thing which is done is a separation of the two roles of capital: we consider capital stock [...] to be the means of attracting labour [...] and capital service , to the production. It was shown also that capital service , as one of the three factors of production, has a meaning of substitutive work of production equipment (energy delivered to animate production equipment). The theory was considered in one sector an approximation of the production system, including some reference to multi-sector approach.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Spatial Information Grid (SIG) is {{a project}} of {{applying}} grid technology to share and integrate spatial data resources, <b>information</b> <b>processing</b> resources, <b>equipment</b> resources, and knowledge resources. SIG computing environment aims to apply the concept of SIG to share hybrid computing resources for processing remote sensing (RS) images. RS image processing is a data-intensive computing problem, and it adapts to be processed according data parallel computing model. In this paper, we discuss the architecture of SIG computing environment, which can provide a powerful computing infrastructure used to process RS image cooperatively. In order to achieve high performance, we propose {{a model of the}} image division. From the relation among the processing time, the communication latency, and the transferring ratio, we can achieve some useful conclusions to determine the strategy of the image division. Furthermore, we can discover two optimal division strategies through comparing the experimental results with those useful conclusions. 1...|$|R

Specifically, the study provides an empirical analysis aimed to examine whether the quality of information systems is able to abate the negative effects of information overload/underload inside a company. Through a survey we assess the managerial feelings about the information overload (and underload) and the managerial assessment of the Information System (IS) quality. Preliminary empirical findings of our survey confirm, by performing a factor analysis, previous literature and suggest the items to be monitored for assessing the information underload and information overload phenomena and the dimensions to take into account for evaluating the IS quality, namely, <b>information</b> <b>processing</b> capacity, technical <b>equipment</b> and communication. Furthermore, results show that when the information underload increases, the <b>information</b> <b>processing</b> capacity of IS decreases and vice versa.

A secondary {{purpose of the}} study was to examine constraints that were perceived to have hampered the inclusion of <b>information</b> <b>processing</b> in Indiana secondary business education instruction. A review of related literature and research was conducted in three major areas, (1) data processing, (2) word <b>processing,</b> and (3) <b>information</b> <b>processing.</b> A questionnaire was developed for use in surveying 120 secondary business education department chairpersons in Indiana. One respondent was utilized in each of 50 large comprehensive high schools, 50 small comphrensive high schools, and 20 area vocational schools. A total of 87 questionnaires or 73 percent of the questionnaires were returned. Tables were prepared to indicate frequency distribution and percentages of response choices for each item on the questionnaire. Among the findings of the study were the following: 1. Data <b>processing</b> <b>equipment</b> was being utilized for businesseducation instruction in 35 percent of the schools and word <b>processing</b> <b>equipment</b> was being utilized in 50 percent of the schools. Micro-computers were more frequently used for data processing instruction than mainframe connected terminals. 2. A higher percentage of business education students attending vocational schools received data processing hands-on experience than in comprehensive high schools. 3. Data processing concept instruction was not provided to students in 38 percent of the schools; 33 percent did not offer word processing concepts instruction. 4. Slightly more than one-fourth of all business teachers had necessary skills to teach on modern electronic equipment. However, 62 percent of schools had at least one business a teacher skilled to teach data processing and 75 percent had teachers skilled to teach word processing. Only four percent of all business teachers were currently taking courses in data processing and six percent were taking courses in word processing. Lack of funds and equipment was the most frequently given reason for not including word processing in business education curricula.

Also, policymakers enacted significant revisions to the tax laws in efforts to alter the allocation of investment.

40|$|Automation and {{computerized}} {{control of}} processes in electric power plants were intensively {{started at the}} end of seventies and at the beginning of eighties during the introduction of microprocessor–based computer systems. The first generation of the <b>information</b> <b>processing</b> <b>equipment</b> has in most cases already become disused. From that time, visibility of controlled process has been increased by installing new and modern devices which enable better informing about all relevant events. The increased quantity of information by which processes can be described implies that new and more efficient techniques for information modeling should be developed. In this paper a device-based approach to process information modeling is proposed. Such modeling approach is more efficient than function-based approach we used before. The efficiency {{lies in the fact that}} device-based approach is in the very essence an object-oriented modeling approach. Therefore, device-based information models can be easily mapped to object-oriented models. Both function-based and device-based modeling approaches are described in the paper and differences between two modeling paradigms are emphasized. In the last Chapter of the paper analogy between device-based and object-oriented models is described. This analogy represents basis for the model mapping...|$|E

40|$|During {{the latter}} part of the 1990 s, U. S. {{economic}} growth was boosted by sizable increases in business purchases of <b>information</b> <b>processing</b> <b>equipment</b> and software, otherwise known as high-tech capital goods. Beginning in 2000, though, firms began to curtail these expenditures; by 2001, high-tech and other forms of business investment were falling sharply. Indeed, much of the downturn in the growth of U. S. economic activity can be traced to the sharp decline in investment spending. Several explanations have been offered, from the acceleration in labor productivity—the so-called “New Economy” story—to the stock market surge and subsequent collapse. One explanation that has not been explored in much detail is the surge in business purchases of hardware and software in preparation for the century date change (Y 2 K). Because many information processing systems and much of the hardware and software were not Y 2 K compliant as late as 1998, it was thought that business investment in high-tech equipment and software would increase appreciably to fix this problem. Although solid Y 2 K spending data are lacking, the evidence presented in this paper indicates that the magnitude and timing of Y 2 K-related expenditures make it unlikely that the investment boom and bust was a Y 2 K event.
