We compared the safety, feasibility and outcome of laparoscopic <b>urinary</b> tract <b>surgery</b> in children weighing 6 kg or less with a weight matched cohort undergoing open <b>urinary</b> tract <b>surgery.</b> MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective nonrandomized chart review comparing 17 infants weighing 6 kg or less who underwent laparoscopic <b>urinary</b> tract <b>surgery</b> beginning in 2005 with a weight matched historical group of 18 {{patients who had}} undergone open <b>urinary</b> tract <b>surgery.</b> We recorded procedures performed, operative times, blood loss, length of hospitalization, preoperative and postoperative hemoglobin and serum creatinine levels, analgesia requirements, complications and outcomes. Urine output during anesthesia was recorded and expressed as ml/kg per hour. We also recorded intraoperative changes in heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure, peak inspiratory pressure, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, CO(2) and core body temperature. RESULTS: Estimated blood loss was minimal in all cases. Mean operative time +/- SD was 201 +/- 72 minutes in the laparoscopic group and 112 +/- 36 minutes in the open group (p < 0. 01). Patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery had lower intraoperative urine output but no changes in preoperative or postoperative serum creatinine levels. Mean postoperative hospitalization +/- SD was 2 +/- 1 days in the laparoscopic group and 3. 2 +/- 2. 18 days in the open group. Mean opioid requirement (morphine equivalent) +/- SD was higher in the open group, at 0. 24 +/- 0. 15 mg/kg, compared to the laparoscopic group, at 0. 13 +/- 0. 19 mg/kg.

And HuR often exerts its promotive effects on tumorigenesis via binding to AU-rich elements in target transcripts and thus regulating {{the expression of}} target transcripts. However, the roles and related mechanisms of HuR/HOTAIR in bladder cancer progression have never been formally tested. Here, {{we found that the}} expression level of HuR was higher in clinical bladder cancer samples than in normal adjacent samples, mirroring that of HOTAIR, and their expression showed strong correlation. Knockdown of HuR/HOTAIR in bladder cancer inhibited cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and promoted cell apoptosis. Notably, HuR interacted and stabilized HOTAIR mRNA and knockdown of HuR decreased HOTAIR expression. Additionally, HOTAIR was identified as a potential target of miR- 1 in bladder cancer cells. Interestingly, overexpression of HOTAIR enhanced HuR expression and increased cytoplasmic accumulation of HuR, thus enhancing HOTAIR expression in turn. But mutation of miR- 1 binding site in HOTAIR canceled the effects of HOTAIR on HuR expression. Overall, we identified a regulatory loop between HOTAIR and HuR during the progression of bladder cancer, which could be exploited to curb bladder cancer progression.

40|$|Abstract Background- Neonatal {{abdominal}} ultrasound {{is usually}} performed in Nigeria to investigate neonatal symptoms {{rather than as}} a follow up to evaluate fetal abnormalities which were detected on prenatal ultrasound. The role of routine obstetric ultrasonography in the monitoring of pregnancy and identification of fetal malformations has partly contributed to lowering of fetal mortality rates. In Nigeria which has a high maternal and fetal mortality rate, many pregnant women do not have ante-natal care and not infrequently, women also deliver their babies at home and only bring the newborns to the clinics for immunization. Even when performed, most routine obstetric scans are not targeted towards the detection of fetal abnormalities. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the benefit of routinely performing abdominal scans on newborns with a view to detecting possible abnormalities which may have been missed ante-natally. Methods- This was a longitudinal study of 202 consecutive, apparently normal newborns. Routine clinical examination and abdominal ultrasound scans were performed on the babies by their mother's bedside, before discharge. Neonates with abnormal initial scans had follow-up scans. Results- There were 108 males and 94 females. There were 12 (5. 9 %) abnormal scans seen in five male and seven female neonates. Eleven of the twelve abnormalities were in the kidneys, six on the left and five on the right. Three of the four major renal anomalies- absent kidney, ectopic/pelvic kidney and two cases of severe hydronephrosis were however on the left side. There was one suprarenal abnormality on the right suspected to be a possible infected adrenal haemorrage. Nine of the abnormal cases reported for follow- up and of these, two cases had persistent severe abnormalities. Conclusions- This study demonstrated a 5. 9 % incidence of <b>genito</b> <b>urinary</b> anomalies on routine neonatal abdominal ultrasound in this small population. Routine obstetric USS is very useful but inadequate availability of skilled personnel and cost implications create great challenges in poor resource settings like Nigeria. However, awareness should be created so that parents who can afford such investigations can make informed decisions. </p...|$|R

Introduction: Protargol {{is a fine}} {{yellowish brown}} powder, a compound of albumen and silver, odorless and with a weak metallic taste. The drug contains 8. 3 % silver {{and seems to be}} a salt containing silver in a masked form as well as a firm combination with a proteid. This product is soluble in one part of water, in glycerine and blood serum. It is not precipitated by alkaline sulphates, albumen, sodium chloride or acids and has a neutral reaction. It is superior to Silver Nitrate in being much less irritating, indifferent to sodium chloride and albumen and in that it does not discolor the skin and exceeds the Nitrate in certainty and efficiency of action. Protargol is a powerfully penetrating antiseptic and mild astringent in catarrhal and purulent inflammations of mucous cavities and tracts. In purulent wounds, abscesses, fistulous tracts it is effective in destroying bacteria and promoting healing. Protargol was first introduced into medicine in 1897 by Prof. Neisser, as a local medication for gonorrhoea in man. It is also used as a local treatment for catarrhal or purulent urethritis in the Human. The drug is indicated in acute catarrhal and purulent conjunctivitis in from one half to ten per cent aquous solutions. In tubercular ulcers, fistulous tracts it is reported very effectual. In catarrhal and ulcerative affections of the ear it is indicated. Abscesses, purulent arthritis, persistant granulating wounds and wounds of the foot yield readily to this drug. Internally the drug is indicated in canine practice as a relief of hemorrhages and ulcerations of the alimentary tract and purulent inflammations of the <b>genito</b> <b>urinary</b> tract. The drug in powder or in solution must be preserved from the action of light or heat. In making, the solutions the menstruum should be cold and the drug placed on the surface and allowed to dissolve slowly or with gentle agitation.

However, the relationship between NAT 2 slow acetylation and bladder cancer is still debatable at present. This study aims to explore preliminarily correlation of NAT 2 slow acetylation and the risk of bladder cancer. Methods: The articles were searched from PubMed, Cochran, McGrane English databases, CBM, CNKI, and other databases. The extraction of bladder cancer patients and a control group related with the NAT 2 gene were detected by the state, and the referenced articles and publications were also used for data retrieval. Using a random effects model, the model assumes that the studies included in the analysis cases belong to the overall population in the study of random sampling, and considering the variables within and between studies. Data were analyzed using STATA Version 6. 0 software, using the META module. According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the literature study, 20 independent studies are included in this meta-analysis. Results: The results showed that the individual differences of bladder cancer susceptibility might be part of the metabolism of carcinogens. Slow acetylation status of bladder cancer associated with the pooled odds ratio was 1. 31 (95 % confidence interval: 1. 11 – 1. 55). Conclusion: The status of NAT 2 slow N-acetylation is associated with bladder cancer risks, and may increase the risk of bladder cancer.

40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review {{recently}} published studies on stress <b>urinary</b> incontinence <b>surgery</b> outcomes in older women. RECENT FINDINGS: Five prospective and two retrospective studies were identified that reported tension-free vaginal tape (n = 6), colposuspension (n = 1) and cadaveric fascia transvaginal sling (n = 1) procedure results. In each study, 21 - 175 older women were included, with mean ages ranging from 71 to 83 years; most studies included younger comparison groups. Mean follow-ups ranged from 3 to 30 months. Subjective {{stress urinary incontinence}} 2 ̆ 7 cure/improvement 2 ̆ 7 rates after surgery were significantly lower in older women when compared with younger women in only one study, although similar trends were seen in two additional studies. Intraoperative complications occurred at similar rates in older and younger women. Postoperative complications (urinary tract infection, urgency, voiding dysfunction, and mesh erosion) were more common in older women {{in only a few}} studies. SUMMARY: Recent studies demonstrate that <b>surgery</b> for stress <b>urinary</b> incontinence in older women improves symptoms, although in some reports, not to the extent seen in younger women. It is unclear if some postoperative complications are more common in older women undergoing incontinence surgery. Results from randomized trials focusing on stress <b>urinary</b> incontinence <b>surgery</b> in older women are needed...|$|R
40|$|Aim: Results {{of first}} 50 laparoscopic upper <b>urinary</b> tractus <b>surgeries</b> which were {{performed}} in Adiyaman State Hospital during compulsory duty after specialty training are presented. Material and Method: Fifty patients who underwent laparoscopic upper <b>urinary</b> tractus <b>surgeries</b> in our clinic between February 2012 and January 2013 were retrospectively evaluated. All of the laparoscopic procedures were performed using transperitoneal method. Results: Mean {{age of the}} patients was 42, 6 ± 13, 6 (17 - 74), and mean operation duration was 96, 8 ± 12, 4 minutes (28 - 165). Thirty two patients were males and 18 were females. Intraoperative complications were not seen {{in any of the}} patients and operations didn%u 2019 t proceed to open surgeries. All patients were mobilized at first day after the operation. No patient needed opioids as painkillers at postoperative period. Decrease in hematocrit level was obseved in a patient at early postoperative period and this patient was followed conservatively with 6 units of erythrocyte suspension. Herniation from the port area was observed in a patient who had cortical cyst excision at postoperative 3 rd month. No major complication was observed. Discussion: Laparoscopic surgery which is becoming more commonly used nowadays can be safely applied in state hospitals if appropriate infrastructure is provided...|$|R

As it does not have specific symptoms and its epidemiological features are similar to transitional {{cell carcinoma}} of the bladder, it is often misdiagnosed. SCBC is highly aggressive, metastasizes very early and has a poor prognosis, and consequently, it has become a focus for urological surgeons and oncologists. An 82 -year-old male visited the Department of <b>Urinary</b> <b>Surgery,</b> in the Affiliated Hospital of Guangdong Medical College (Zhanjiang, China), due to gross hematuria that had persisted for one week. Abdominal computed tomography showed a neoplasm of ~ 6 x 6 x 7 cm on the anterior wall of the bladder. The initial diagnosis was of uroepithelial cell {{carcinoma of the}} bladder and surgery was performed to remove the tumor. However, the subsequent pathological examination suggested that the tumor was an SCBC. Small cell carcinoma is a highly malignant disease, with a high mortality rate, and it rarely occurs in the bladder. Upon review {{of a large number of}} studies, SCBC was not found to present with specific symptoms, making the early diagnosis of the disease difficult, however, commonly occurring symptoms included dysuria, painless gross hematuria and urinary tract obstruction...|$|R
40|$|Following {{spinal cord}} injury (SCI), bladder {{management}} is of primary importance. As an activity of daily living (ADL), it affects community integration {{and quality of life}} (QOL). Women with SCI have neurogenic bladders that require self-catheterization, but they are unable to catheterize the native urethra, thus making bladder management physically and emotionally challenging. The {{purpose of this study was}} to understand the experiences of women with SCI who undergo <b>urinary</b> diversion <b>surgery</b> for bladder management. Qualitative data were collected using semistructured interviews from 10 women with SCI after <b>urinary</b> diversion <b>surgery</b> for bladder management. Qualitative Nvivo analysis of interview data was based on cognitive adaptation theory, which emphasizes adaptation to life-threatening events. Analysis showed improved quality of life among these 10 women, with improvements in independence, convenience, aesthetics, confidence, and sexuality. The women 2 ̆ 7 s lived experiences also showed enhanced privacy, dignity, normalcy, and safety. The lack of awareness in health care workers to offer this procedure was universally highlighted by participants. The social change implications include the need to advocate for women with SCI with bladder management needs who are unaware of this surgery option. Understanding the bladder management needs of women with SCI may help this population make choices for a better quality of life...|$|R
