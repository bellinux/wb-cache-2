5|$|Khambatta also faced {{difficulties}} during filming. Due to the actress' personal objections, {{she would}} not appear nude as {{called for in the}} script during the Ilia probe's appearance. The producers got her to agree to wear a thin skin-colored body stocking, but she caught a cold {{as a result of the}} shower mist, created by dropping dry ice into warm water and funneling the vapors into the shower by a hidden tube. Khambatta had to leave the location repeatedly to avoid hypercapnia. One scene required the Ilia probe to slice through a steel door in the sickbay; doors made out of paper, corrugated cardboard covered in aluminum foil, and cork were tested before the proper effect was reached. The <b>illuminated</b> <b>button</b> in the hollow of the probe's throat was a 12–volt light bulb that Khambatta could turn on and off via hidden wires; the bulb's heat eventually caused a slight burn.|$|E
25|$|Ridership {{has been}} rising, and {{user-friendly}} features {{that have grown}} up through custom and practice help this. For instance, passengers open the doors by pressing a green strip on the central pole (in PCC trams) or an <b>illuminated</b> <b>button</b> (on Flexity trams), and drivers usually {{make a point of}} waiting for latecomers. However, overcrowding at rush hours and at weekend is common. The rate of detected fare-dodging is 4.15%, despite periodic enforcement campaigns, and this is being addressed by the installation of ticket barriers in all metro stations. From 2013, the obligation to check out of as well as into the system is being progressively introduced.|$|E

5000|$|Astron Belt came in both {{upright and}} cockpit cabinets. The cockpit version {{featured}} <b>illuminated</b> <b>buttons</b> {{on the control}} panel, a larger 25" [...] monitor (the upright used a standard 19"), and a vibrating seat.|$|R
50|$|A keyboardless MIDI controller, the Novation Launchpad, was {{launched}} in 2009 with an 8x8 grid of large <b>illuminated</b> <b>buttons</b> {{that could be used}} to trigger sounds, loops, effects and other parameters, initially in conjunction with the Ableton Live music performance application. Launchpad was one of the first grid-based performance controllers and this area expanded over the subsequent period to become a significant aspect of the electronic music hardware market. There are currently 3 variations of the product, the Launchpad, Launchpad Pro, and Launchpad Mini.|$|R
30|$|A visual {{interface}} {{has been developed}} to intuitively use the MONOME to control the robot's behavior. On each column of the button grid, {{the status of a}} trajectory slot is summarized; starting as blank, each slot can be activated, by pressing the first column button. The diverse combination of <b>illuminated</b> <b>buttons</b> guides the performer throughout the setting of the initial radius of the trajectory, the recording of robot's movement, and the managing of virtual trajectories, allowing him to easily recognize which slot is currently active, which slots contain virtual trajectories, and which others are still empty.|$|R
50|$|A {{telephone}} exchange system capable {{of working with}} upto 10n external lines and upto five operating positions, each position having a keypad with an <b>illuminated</b> push <b>button</b> for each line and a buzzer that sounded for 2 seconds when an incoming call was received.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Many {{different}} kinematic and kinetic signals {{have been}} proposed as possible variables {{under the control of}} the primary motor cortex. Despite the presence of direct projections to motor neurons, muscle activation has received less attention as a controlled variable. Furthermore, although it is well known that descending fibers project to multiple motor pools, an objective, quantitative study of the relation between neuronal modulation and the activity of groups of muscles has not previously been reported. We have recorded the discharge of 310 neurons located in the primary motor cortex of two monkeys, along with the activity of a variety of arm and hand muscles. Data were recorded while the monkey reached to and pressed a series of <b>illuminated</b> <b>buttons.</b> The similarity of a given neuron’...|$|R
50|$|Invisible {{details such as}} {{wiring and}} {{electronics}} do not affect the visual accuracy of the prop, {{as long as the}} effects those components are responsible for producing are identical to that of the original. Blinking lights and <b>illuminated</b> <b>buttons</b> appear everywhere from the bridge of the Enterprise to Darth Vader's belt, and attempting to faithfully reproduce the exact circuit boards and lamps is in most cases impossible or impractical. This is particularly true for older films. Similarly, mechanical effects and even the choice of materials often boils down to practicality and the purpose of the prop rather than close attention to detail. A prop designed to be worn with a costume may be constructed differently than one intended solely for display in a sealed case.|$|R
5000|$|Launchpad (2009) is a multi-button {{controller}} for {{the popular}} live control application Ableton Live, featuring {{a grid of}} 64 (8x8) brightly <b>illuminated</b> square <b>buttons.</b> Each button can be assigned to a Clip [...] - [...] a piece of audio or MIDI {{that may or may}} not be looped. Additional modes allow Automap control of features and mixer control.|$|R
5000|$|Early {{handheld}} games used simple {{mechanisms to}} interact with players, often limited to <b>illuminated</b> <b>buttons</b> and sound effects. Notable early handheld games included Waco's Electro Tic-Tac-Toe (1972), the Mattel Auto Race (1976), and Mattel Electronic Football (1977), which featured very simple red-LED displays; gameplay involved the player pressing buttons to move his car or quarterback icon (represented by a bright dot) to avoid obstacles (represented by less bright dots). In 1978 the Milton Bradley Company entered the handheld market with Simon, a simple color-and-sound-matching game. Simon had no dedicated display, but featured four colored, lighted buttons; the original version was {{large enough to be}} used as a tabletop game or a handheld; later versions became increasingly smaller. The same year, Parker Brothers also released Merlin, a more sophisticated handheld which could play six different games using an array of 11 buttons with integrated LEDs. Despite their relative simplicity, each of these early games was highly successful.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} all the 3.0L models VG, VX and VZ trim {{come with}} <b>illuminated</b> steering <b>button</b> cruise control, dual large exhaust pipe, V6 logo, VCM (variable cylinder management engine), active engine mount to reduce vibration, active noise control, twin silencer and DBW (drive-by-wire) throttle control. This DBW system when {{used with the}} cruise control can help save fuel as the ECU will calculate the most efficient fuel vs speed in oppose to self-drive.|$|R
50|$|In August 2009 a {{slightly}} down-specced budget {{version of the}} E-620 was announced by Olympus, this model was called the E-600 and was available to the North American market only. The features not present on the E-600 are the <b>illuminated</b> function <b>buttons</b> and all but four of the art filters, other than that the E600 is an E-620 and has gradually spread out of North America through grey imports of both new and used cameras and is often {{thought of as a}} better value option to the E-620.|$|R
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 2006 season, a virtual on-field graphic showing an arrow pointing towards the direction of advancement and the down/yardage information began to be used on all plays. This feature was then added by CBS, NBC, NFL Network (for its Run to the Playoffs game telecasts) and (beginning with the 2008 season) ESPN. At the same time, the down/yardage information is also displayed on the scoring banner, resulting in duplicate presentation of the same information. The bar was also enhanced for high definition and is thinner than previous versions, with little translucency. The NFL on Fox logo was also repositioned to the far left instead of the far right. During high definition broadcasts, the area above the banner features a translucent slanting pattern going from left-to-right across the screen. During the 2006 preseason telecasts, the quarter was indicated by four <b>illuminating</b> <b>buttons</b> (the number of buttons that were lit indicated the quarter being played), but due to difficulties in visibility, the quarter returned to being numerically represented for the regular season. On the rare occasion during a game in which the field lines are not visible (such as those dealing with snow or rain), a small bug pops up on the bottom left side of the screen with the logo of the team that is currently in possession as well as text indicating where the ball is (e.g., Arizona-Own 41 Yard Line).|$|R
50|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been a {{proliferation}} of devices that use media symbols in order to represent the Run/Stop/Pause functions. Likewise, user interface programing pertaining to these functions has also been influenced by that of media players. For example, some washers and dryers with a common <b>illuminated</b> play/pause <b>button</b> are programed so that when the appliance is off, the play/pause light stays off. When the device is running the light stays on, and when the washer/dryer is in a paused state, the button flashes. This type of programing {{is similar to that of}} earlier CD players, which are also set to flash in this manner in the pause state.|$|R
50|$|The company {{installed}} {{the very first}} 'Real-Time' computer system {{in the western hemisphere}} which handled bookings, flights and hotels all-in-one. The system was a UNIVAC 96K 9400 card reading real time computer, also with a complete terminal using a teletype-like data entry point with hexadecimal data entered by pressing numerous <b>buttons</b> <b>illuminated</b> on the main board. There were 6 magnetic tape machines and two magnetic Disk drives, each 10 megabytes with six heavy metal disks for each machine, with a high-speed line printer, capable of printing charter airline tickets {{at a rate of about}} one every three seconds on multi-part paper. The basement room was maintained at 64°F and 65% humidity, and operated 7-days-per-week, 52 weeks per year.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a brain-computer interface (BCI) {{that can help}} users to input phone numbers. The system {{is based on the}} steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP). Twelve <b>buttons</b> <b>illuminated</b> at different rates were displayed on a computer monitor. The buttons constituted a virtual telephone keypad, representing the ten digits 0 – 9, BACKSPACE, and ENTER. Users could input phone number by gazing at these buttons. The frequency-coded SSVEP was used to judge which button the user desired. Eight of the thirteen subjects succeeded in ringing the mobile phone using the system. The average transfer rate over all subjects was 27. 15 bits/min. The attractive features of the system are noninvasive signal recording, little training required for use, and high information transfer rate. Approaches to improve the performance of the system are discussed. Index Terms—Brain-computer interface (BCI), electroencephalography (EEG), steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP), transfer rate. I...|$|R
500|$|The Nord Stage Organ Section {{provides}} {{physical models}} of three electric organs – the Hammond B3, the Vox Continental, and the Farfisa Compact. Instead of physical drawbars, the Organ section features [...] "drawbuttons" [...] {{with a set}} of red LED strips to indicate the position of each drawbar from 0 (fully in) to 8 (fully out). For the Hammond and Vox organ emulations, pressing the [...] "down" [...] <b>button</b> <b>illuminates</b> more LEDs to visually emulate a drawbar being pulled out, while pressing the [...] "up" [...] button does the reverse. Since a real Farfisa organ selects sounds via rocker tabs instead of drawbars, the drawbuttons behave as tabs when the Farfisa emulation is selected on the Stage. The standard set of Percussion, Chorus and Vibrato settings as found on each of the three organs are available, and a rotary speaker emulation (similar to a Leslie speaker), including speed selection and overdrive, is also available. The Organ section is fully polyphonic.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- This paper {{introduces}} {{a system that}} can help the disabled persons, who have no motor control left for communication besides eye movements, to achieve an acceptable level of communication. The system incorporates a brain-computer interface (BCI) for connecting the brain to the computer. Steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) recorded from the occipital scalp are used as the input of our BCI system. SSVEP-based BCI is essentially EEG-based vision-tracking system. This system relies on the user’s ability to control eye movements. The frequency-coded SSVEPs elicited by multiple flickered visual stimuli {{can be used to}} determine where the eyes are directed. Twenty-eight <b>buttons</b> <b>illuminated</b> at different rates were displayed on a computer monitor. The buttons constituted a virtual keypad, representing the 26 alphabets from A-Z, BACKSPACE, and ENTER. Users could input alphabets by gazing at these buttons. The frequency-coded SSVEP was used to judge which button the user desired. The attractive features of the system are noninvasive signal recording, little training required for use, and high information transfer rate. ...|$|R
5000|$|When a Windows PC {{controls}} a LaserJet, the [...] "Form Feed" [...] button seldom {{does anything}} when pressed. It {{has a small}} indicator light, and was usually used with very simple DOS programs that did not eject the last page after sending data to the printer, though {{it could also be}} useful to print the data in the printer's memory if a program failed in the middle of sending a page to be printed. (In certain cases, this might {{be the only way to}} recover one's data in the event of a system crash that occurred while printing.) The Form Feed button would print whatever was remaining in memory and prepare the printer to accept any new data as the start of a new page. Note that for at least some LaserJet models, notably the LaserJet 4MPlus, the printer must be switched off-line before the Form Feed button will work. Most users of dot-matrix printers in the 1980s probably found the Online and Form Feed functions obvious, as most dot-matrix printers had these buttons and they worked similarly. The indicator on the Form Feed <b>button</b> <b>illuminates</b> when there is received data in the printer's buffer; this makes it much easier to predict what will happen if the printer is put online and a new job is sent to it, or if sending of a job in progress is resumed.|$|R
