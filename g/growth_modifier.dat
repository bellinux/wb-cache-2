However, {{it is still not}} clear how <b>growth</b> <b>modifiers</b> like amino acids and peptides select different crystal phases of a complex material like iron oxide. The current paper shows that already with single amino acids, (incomplete) crystal phase selection is achieved in vitro.

Other amino acids like L-valine have only minor effects when compared to control samples grown in the absence of amino acids. The effects of the amino acids can be rationalized via kinetic trapping and different interaction strengths of the amino acids with the growing iron oxide particles.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Polycarboxylate {{molecules}} and oligomers {{have been investigated}} as <b>growth</b> <b>modifiers</b> during seeded calcite precipitation. To better understand possible molecular interactions and kinetic effects, additives with different structures and molecular weights have been investigated in this work. All additives show growth modifying effects, albeit less strongly for succinic acid and glutaric acid. This is attributed to a relatively weak interaction with the precipitated particles as well an additive size too small to influence the aggregation phase of the growth mechanism. Poly(acrylic acid) and poly(aspartic acid), on the other hand, led to strong growth modification, with the resulting particles being nanostructured, formed by an assembly of nanosized primary particles and consequently having a high specific surface area. Poly(aspartic acid) showed a stronger growth modifying effect than poly(acrylic acid) at a similar molecular weight and functional group concentration. This was not readily explainable without using molecular dynamics simulations (reported in a separate article), {{which suggests that the}} differences originate from the rigidity of the backbone and favorable electrostatic interactions between backbone nitrogen atoms and the surface in the case of poly(aspartic acid). 1...|$|R

40|$|Laminar-turbulent {{transition}} in compressible, high-speed boundary layers is currently not well understood. The transition {{location on the}} surface of a vehicle can therefore not accurately be predicted. This is particularly true for transition on surfaces with a localized two-dimensional unevenness, such as a roughness element (Balakumar 2003; Marxen et al. 2009). Cases with geometrical changes are relevant for a number of applications, including the heat-shield of vehicles (re-) entering a planetary atmosphere and the inlet to scram jet combustors for hypersonic cruise vehicles. Transition is undesirable on the heat shield due to an associated increase in temperature. It is desirable for scram jets to ensure proper mixing within the combustor. In all theses applications an accurate prediction of the transition location is advantageous for the vehicle design. Presently, many transition prediction methods rely on a deterministic description in which a fixed transition location is computed.

Both anionic and cationic polysaccharides were prepared. Random and crosslinked graft copolymers {{were also}} prepared. The percentage grafting {{was determined by}} gravimetric analysis and results were confirmed by cross-polarization magic angle spinning carbon- 13 nuclear magnetic resonance microscopy (CP/MAS 13 C NMR). These modified biodegradable polymers were then used to flocculate precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC). The effects of pH, percentage grafting, crosslinker concentration and polysaccharide concentration on PCC flocculation were evaluated. Furthermore, the effects of anionic and cationic starch, either added to PCC sequentially or simultaneously, on PCC flocculation were also investigated. Generally, anionically modified starch showed excellent flocculation properties, which are desirable for the end application of PCC retention. The effect of polyacrylic acid (PAA) and polyacrylamide (PAM) modified cellulose fibers on calcium carbonate crystal nucleation and growth modification was investigated. When the heterogeneous crystallization of CaCO 3 {{was carried out in}} the presence of modified cellulose fibers the CaCO 3 crystals were found to be residing {{on the surface of the}} fibers. The morphologies of the crystallized CaCO 3, polymorph and fiber surface coverage were different for cellulose materials grafted with polymers of different functionalities, meaning that there is interaction between the crystal <b>growth</b> <b>modifier</b> and the growing nuclei. The effect of the modified starch on the crystallization of calcium carbonate gave useful insight into designing CaCO 3 filler morphologies. It was found that the filler size, morphology and surface properties of fillers can be tailor-made by choosing suitable CaCO 3 crystallization conditions as well as a suitable crystal <b>growth</b> <b>modifier.</b> The crystallized CaCO 3 had a negatively charged surface. Results of fluorescence studies showed that the PAA modified starch (polymeric additive used) resided on the surface of the crystals. Thus the presence of the polysaccharide on the surface of a filler could be advantageous for strengthening fiber–filler bonding in paper applications. Anionic starch materials were also used to prepare anionic-starch-coated starch particles. Both the anionic starch and anionic-starch-coated starch particles were evaluated for PCC retention and other properties of hand sheets. When anionic-starch-coated starch particles were used there was generally an improvement in the PCC retention, while the other paper properties remained desirable. The success achieved with the use of anionic-starch-coated starch particles now opens the way for the further preparation and testing of various modified starch particles, for optimization of filler retention...|$|E

40|$|Calcium {{carbonate}} crystallization in organisms often occurs {{through the}} transformation from the amorphous precursor. It {{is believed that}} the amorphous phase could be temporarily stabilized and stored, until its templated transition to the crystalline form is induced. Here we develop a bio-inspired crystallization strategy {{that is based on}} the above mechanism. Amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) spherulitic particles are formed and stabilized on a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of hydroxy-terminated alkanethiols on Au surface. The ACC is stored as a reservoir for ions and is induced to crystallize on command by introducing a secondary surface that is functionalized with carboxylic acid-terminated SAM. This secondary surface acts as a template for oriented and patterned nucleation. Various oriented crystalline arrays and micropatterned films are formed. We also show that the ACC phase can be doped with foreign ions (e. g.

40|$|Glass is a {{group of}} {{materials}} that has been used for structural and functional purposes for many centuries. Nevertheless, interest in the science and technology of glass has expanded significantly in recent years {{as a result of the}} need to develop new materials for advanced applications. Examples of new materials in which glasses of various kinds are an essential constituent include glass ceramics which are prepared by crystallizing glass, glass matrix composities, glass fibre reinforced composities and optical-fibre glass. Sintered covalent ceramics, used for example for wear resistance and high temperature applications often also contain a small proportion of glass phase which is added intentionally to aid densification during sintering. In the development of such materials it has proved necessary to widen knowledge of the physical, chemical and mechanical properties of glass and how these are influenced by composition and microstructural morphology. The aim of the work presented in this thesis is to develop a better understanding of the crystallization behaviour of glasses in the system YSi-Al- 0 -(N) with small additions of ZrO 2 as a nucleating agent. Interest in the Y-Si-Al- 0 -(N) system stems not only from the fact that it forms the basis of glass phases added as sintering aids found as microstructural constituents in sintered Si 3 N 4 -based ceramics but also because glasses in this system have potential to form a relatively new group of refractory glass-ceramics. The study of compositions within this system in this work has involved investigation of: the glass formation in the Al 2 O 3 -Y 2 O 3 -Si 02 system under conditions of laser melting; the crystallization behaviour and properties of selected oxide and oxynitride glasses with / without addition of zirconia; the role of zirconia addition on the crystallization behaviour of Y-Si-Al- 0 -(N) glasses and on the melting of Y-Si-Al- 0 -(N) glass-ceramics; the YAG crystallization from an oxynitride glass relevant to the improved heat treatment of YAG-based glass-ceramics and YAG/beta-SiAlON materials. Techniques used in the investigations involved laser glass melting, conventional furnace glass melting, glass-ceramic furnace heat treatment, scanning electron microscopy, room temperature X-ray diffractometry, high temperature X-ray diffractometry, differential thermal analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, dilatometry, infrared spectroscopy, Vickers hardness and density measurements. The glass-forming region in the system Y 2 O 3 -Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 under conditions of laser melting was found to be more extensive than in earlier studies. No glass formed in compositions with less than 20 wt % SiO 2. 6 wt % of ZrO 2 can be dissolved in the investigated composition of the yttria-alumina-silica liquid at 1700 °C. When larger amounts are added a cubic crystalline phase of "yttria-stabilized zirconia" with a composition of Y 0. 15 Zr 0. 8501. 9 forms. The hardness and density of the zirconia-containing glasses are slightly higher than for the zirconiafree glasses. The glass transition temperature and softening temperature are lowered by the addition of zirconia. The Zr 4 + cation acts as a glass-network modifier causing lowering of the viscosity of the glass with a consequent decrease of the nucleation density. The optimum nucleation temperature of the ZrO 2 -containing glasses is marginally lower than that of the ZrO 2 -free glass. ZrO 2 acts as a crystal <b>growth</b> <b>modifier</b> rather than a nucleating agent during the crystallization of the ZrO 2 -containing glasses. Addition of ZrO 2 promotes the formation of the y-Y 2 Si 2 O 7 phase. Due to the lower viscosity of the retained glass in the ZrO 2 -containing glass-ceramics the rates of the phase transformations involved in the melting process are increased. The YAG crystallization from a ZrO 2 -free oxynitride glass was studied by high temperature X-ray diffractometry. It was found that the crystallization occurred preferably at free surfaces.

Thirty-two pigs each of either 1 / 4 Duroc- 3 / 4 white composite (Duroc crossbred), purebred Meishan, or 1 / 4 Meishan- 3 / 4 white composite (Meishan crossbred) breeding were injected daily with 0 or 4 mg pST and fed a diet containing 0 or 2. 75 ppm salbutamol for approximately 34 d and subsequently slaughtered. As the percentage Meishan in the genotype increased, loin muscle area, semitendinosus weight, average daily gain (ADG), and carcass gain decreased. There was an interaction between salbutamol and genotype for ADG, daily protein gain, and total carcass gain, resulting in Meishan crossbred pigs having similar rates to non-treated Duroc crossbred pigs. When Duroc crossbred pigs were treated with salbutamol, both daily protein gain and total carcass gain were greatest, whereas ADG was nonsignificantly greater than that of untreated Duroc crossbred and salbutamol-treated Meishan crossbred pigs. Meishan pigs did not respond to salbutamol treatment for the criteria mentioned. Both pST and salbutamol increased loin muscle area and semitendinosus weight across genotypes. Leaf fat was reduced more by pST treatment in purebred Meishan pigs than in the other two genotypes, and salbutamol treatment resulted in small reductions in leaf fat across genotypes. Efficiency of feed utilization was similar among genotypes but increased with either pST or salbutamol treatment.

Calix[4]arenes functionalised at the wide-rim with acidic amino acids were investigated as potential crystal <b>growth</b> <b>modifiers</b> on model mineral systems and {{were compared with}} previously investigated narrow-rim analogues. This {{study found that the}} wide-rim aspartic acid and glutamic acid functionalised calix[4]arenes {{had an impact on the}} morphology of calcium carbonate and barium sulfate. The iminodiacetic acid calix[4]arene was found to have minor impact on the morphology of calcium carbonate. In comparison with the narrow-rim analogues, the wide-rim and narrow-rim aspartic acid calix[4]arenes had similar potency on calcium carbonate while the wide-rim glutamic acid calix[4]arene appeared to be more potent than the narrow-rim calix[4]arene. Calcium carbonate crystallised in the presence of wide-rim aspartic acid and glutamic acid calix[4]arenes and their narrow-rim analogues had stepped edges which resembled calcium carbonate found in biomineral systems (e. g. mollusc shells). Desupersaturation experiments showed the wide-rim aspartic acid calix[4]arene to be a more potent inhibitor of barium sulfate crystallisation than the wide-rim glutamic acid calix[4]arene. An aqueous solution of L-proline calix[4]arene exhibited surfactant-like properties. The self-assembly behaviour of L-proline calix[4]arene in solution was characterised by UV-visible and NMR spectroscopy. The critical aggregation concentration of L-proline calix[4]arene was determined to be 4 – 9 mM by monitoring a {{selection of}} dye compounds using UV-visible spectroscopy. The interaction of L-proline calix[4]arene with small molecules and in the presence of electrolytes was also characterised by NMR spectroscopy. The 1 H NMR spectra of L-proline calix[4]arene in the presence of small molecules (tetrahydrofuran, 1 -methyl- 2 -pyrrolidinone, and tert-butyl alcohol) suggested that the calixarene was either acting as a host or selfassembling into larger aggregates. Variable temperature NMR experiments showed that these interactions were thermoreversible. The formation of a hydrogel by proline calix[4]arenes in the presence of electrolytes was a serendipitous discovery. Investigations with selected electrolytes showed that the anion was the dominant factor in determining if a hydrogel formed, with lesser influence from the cation. The thermostability of the calixarene-electrolyte hydrogels tended to follow the Hofmeister series, where more stable hydrogels formed in the presence of anions towards the chaotropic end of the series. A racemic mixture of the proline calixarenes gave a less stable hydrogel compared with hydrogels of the enantiopure compounds. The calixarene-electrolyte hydrogels had a fibrous appearance, as characterised by atomic force microscopy. Some hydrogels collapsed slowly and deposited crystals of sufficient quality for single crystal x-ray crystallography. These structures gave some insights into how intermolecular forces may give rise to the fibrous gel structures; in particular hydrogen bonds between proline moieties, and the inclusion of a proline group into the cavity of a neighbouring calixarene, leading to spiral-like structures. A sarcosine functionalised calix[4]arene also formed hydrogels upon addition of some electrolytes, whereas the proline-functionalised calix[5]arene analogue did not. Since a range of hydrogels have been used as matrices to control crystal growth, a proline calix[4]arene-lithium nitrate hydrogel was used as a potential template for barium sulfate crystallisation. The results suggested that lithium nitrate was the main factor in modification of the barium sulfate morphology. The hydrogel did have a minor impact by slowing the diffusion of sulfate anions into the barium-containing gel phase resulting in smaller particles. The versatility of amino acid functionalised calix[4]arenes has been highlighted here. Wide-rim functionalised acidic amino acid calix[4]arenes were found to be effective crystal growth modifiers; having an impact on the morphology and growth kinetics of model crystallisation systems, calcium carbonate and barium sulfate. Interesting supramolecular chemistry was observed with proline functionalised calix[4]arenes; the proline calixarene interacts with small molecules in solution and either act as a host or self-assembles into large aggregates. The formation of proline calix[4]arene aggregates is interesting as they give rise to hydrogels in the presence of selected electrolytes...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Crystallization is a key unit operation used for obtaining purified products by many process industries. The key properties of the crystalline products, such as size and shape distribution, purity and polymorphic form are controlled by the crystallization process. All these properties impact significantly the downstream operations such as drying or filtration. Therefore, monitoring and controlling this process is fundamental {{to ensure the quality}} of the final product. Process analytical technology (PAT) brings numerous new methods and opportunities in the process analytics and real time process monitoring systems, which can be integrated into the control algorithm and provide high level optimal control strategies as well as deeper understanding of the process. Process monitoring helps develop mathematical models which can, in one hand, help in better understanding the processes and consecvently the development and application of advanced control methods in order to achieve better product quality. In this work, image processing and image analysis based direct nucleation control (IA-DNC) is developed in order to investigate the evolution of the crystal properties, such as crystal size, and crystal shape distribution. The IA-DNC approach is also compared to alternative DNC techniques, in which particle number were measured by Focused Beam Reflectance Measurement (FBRM) in order to control crystal size. A control approach is introduced that control the nucleation and disappearance of crystals during cooling and heating segments related to the changes of the number of counts (measured by Particle Vision Measurment, so called PVM or combination of FBRM and PVM). The approach was applied to investigate crystallization of compounds with different behavior: potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KDP) water, contaminated KDP -water and Ascorbic acid water systems. The results demonstrate the application of imaging technique for model-free feedback control for tailoring crystal product properties. The second main aim of the thesis is to investigate and control crystallization processes in impure media in the presence of multiple impurities, with an impact on the crystal shape via growth kinetics. The broad impact of the crystal <b>growth</b> <b>modifiers</b> (impurities) on the growth kinetics is observed in real time by using in situ video imaging probe and real-time image analysis. A morphological population balance model is developed, which incorporates a multi-site, competitive adsorption mechanism of the impurities on the crystal faces. The kinetic parameters of primary nucleation, growth and impurity adsorption for a model system of potassium dihydrogen phosphate crystallization in water in the presence of two impurities, were estimated and validated with experimental results. It was demonstrated that the model can be used to describe the dynamic evolution of crystal properties, such as size and aspect ratio during crystallization for different impurity profiles in the system. Manual, feedback and hybrid feedback-feedforward control techniques are developed and investigated numerically for continuous processes, while model-based and model-free control approach for crystal shape are developed for batch processes. The developed morphological population balance model is implemented and applied in the model-based control approaches, which are suitable to describe multicomponent adsorption processes and their influence on the crystal shape. Case studies show the effectiveness of crystal <b>growth</b> <b>modifiers</b> based shape control techniques. Comparison of different control approaches shows the effectiveness of the techniques. The third part of the thesis deals with purification of crystals when adsorption of impurities on crystal surfaces and its incorporation into crystals are considered. A purification method, called competitive purity control (CPC) is proposed and investigated. A morphological population balance model, including nucleation, growth and competitive impurity adsorption kinetics is developed to describe the case when multiple impurities can adsorb competitively on the crystal surface. The model is also combined with liquid phase chemical reaction model, in order to investigate the purity control case when an additive is introduced in the system that reacts with the impurity forming a non-adsorbing reaction product. Both competitive purity control approaches proposed: the adsorption based competitive purity control (A-CPC) and the reaction based competitive purity control (R-CPC); are investigated using detailed numerical simulations then compared with the alternative widely used purification method, called recrystallization. In the last contribution chapter, an integrated process optimization of a continuous chemical reactor and crystallizer is performed and studied numerically. The {{purpose of this study is}} to show the way in which the byproduct produced in the chemical reactor may affect the crystallization process and how its negative effect can be reduced by applying integrated process optimization. Sensitivity analysis of the system was performed by considering the flow rate and the concentration of substances in the input stream of the chemical reactor as manipulated process variables. Model based integrated process optimization and the sensitivity analysis in order to obtain improved quality product in terms of crystal size, shape and purity...|$|R
40|$|Few {{dermatologic}} conditions carry as much {{emotional distress}} as chemotherapy-induced alopecia (CIA). The prerequisite for successful development of strategies for CIA prevention is {{the understanding of}} the pathobiology of CIA. The incidence and severity of CIA are variable and related to the particular chemotherapeutic protocol. CIA is traditionally categorized as acute diffuse hair loss caused by dystrophic anagen effluvium; however, CIA presents with different clinical patterns of hair loss. When an arrest of mitotic activity occurs, obviously numerous and interacting factors influence the shedding pattern. The major approach to minimize CIA is by scalp cooling. Unfortunately, most published data on scalp cooling are of poor quality. Several experimental approaches to the development of pharmacologic agents are under evaluation and include drug-specific antibodies, hair <b>growth</b> cycle <b>modifiers,</b> cytokines and <b>growth</b> factors, antioxidants, inhibitors of apoptosis, and cell-cycle and proliferation modifiers. Ultimately, the protection should be selective to the hair follicle; for example, topical application, such that the anticancer efficacy of chemotherapy is not hampered. Among the few agents that have been evaluated so far in humans, AS 101 and minoxidil were able to reduce the severity or shorten the duration of CIA, but could not prevent CIA...|$|R
40|$|LiCoPO 4 /C {{nanocomposite}} {{with growth}} controlled by carbonate anions was synthesized via a unique solid-state fusion method. Carbonate anions {{in the form}} of H 2 CO 3 or a mixture of H 2 CO 3 + (NH 4) 2 CO 3 have been used as a <b>growth</b> inhibiting <b>modifier</b> to produce morphology controlled lithium cobalt phosphate. The presence of cobalt phosphide (Co 2 P) as a second phase improved the conductivity and electrochemical properties of the parent LiCoPO 4. The formation of Co 2 P is found to be achievable only in an inert atmosphere. Super P ® carbon (10 wt. %) provided an adherent carbon coating on pristine LiCoPO 4 resulting in the LiCoPO 4 /C composite cathode. This electrode exhibited enhanced electrochemical properties: capacity of 123 mAh g - 1 with excellent capacity retention of 89 % after 30 cycles, and reasonable rate capability of up to 5 C rate. The synergistic effect of carbonate anions and formation of Co 2 P under inert atmosphere has influenced the electrochemical behavior of LiCoPO 4 /C cathode through controlling the morphology and increasing the conductivity...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{demonstrate}} spatial control of osteoblast differentiation in vitro and bone formation in vivo using inkjet bioprinting technology and to create three-dimensional persistent bio-ink patterns of bone morphogenetic protein- 2 (BMP- 2) and its modifiers immobilized within microporous scaffolds. Semicircular patterns of BMP- 2 were printed within circular DermaMatrixÔ human allograft scaffold constructs. The contralateral halves of the constructs were unprinted or printed with BMP- 2 modifiers, including the BMP- 2 inhibitor, noggin. Printed bio-ink pattern retention was validated using fluorescent or 125 I-labeled bio-inks. Mouse C 2 C 12 progenitor cells cultured on patterned constructs differentiated in a dose-dependent fashion toward an osteoblastic fate in register to BMP- 2 patterns. The fidelity of spatial restriction of osteoblastic differentiation at the boundary between neighboring BMP- 2 and noggin patterns improved in comparison with patterns without noggin. Acellular DermaMatrix constructs similarly patterned with BMP- 2 and noggin were then implanted into a mouse calvarial defect model. Patterns of bone formation in vivo were comparable with patterned responses of osteoblastic differentiation in vitro. These results demonstrate that three-dimensional biopatterning of a growth factor and <b>growth</b> factor <b>modifier</b> within a construct can direct cell differentiation in vitro and tissue formation in vivo in register to printed patterns...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background High <b>growth</b> (hg) <b>modifier</b> and {{background}} independent quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting growth, adiposity and carcass composition were previously identified on mouse chromosomes (MMU) 1, 2, 5, 8, 9, 11 and 17. To confirm and further characterize each QTL, two panels of speed congenic strains {{were developed by}} introgressing CAST/EiJ (CAST) QTL alleles onto either mutant C 57 Bl/ 6 J- hg/hg (HG) or wild type C 57 Bl/ 6 J (B 6) genetic backgrounds. Results The first speed congenic panel was developed by introgressing four overlapping donor regions spanning MMU 2 in its entirety onto both HG and B 6 backgrounds, {{for a total of}} eight strains. Phenotypic characterization of the MMU 2 panel confirmed the segregation of multiple growth and obesity QTL and strongly suggested that a subset of these loci modify the effects of the hg deletion. The second panel consisted of individual donor regions on an HG background for each QTL on MMU 1, 5, 8, 9, 11 and 17. Of the six developed strains, five were successfully characterized and displayed significant differences in growth and/or obesity as compared to controls. All five displayed phenotypes similar to those originally attributed to each QTL, however, novel phenotypes were unmasked in several of the strains including sex-specific effects. Conclusion The speed congenic strains developed herein constitute an invaluable genomic resource and provide the foundation to identify the specific nature of genetic variation influencing growth and obesity. </p...|$|R
40|$|Amylin (islet amyloid polypeptide) is a peptide {{synthesized}} principally in the b-cells of the pancreatic islets {{together with}} insulin and has actions as a hormone, <b>growth</b> factor, and <b>modifier</b> of behavior. As a hormone, amylin acts to modify gastric motility, renal resorption, and has metabolic actions. It is postulated {{that the principal}} function of amylin as a hormone is the activation of physiological processes associated with feeding. As a growth factor, amylin acts on bone cells, renal proximal tubular cells, and islet b-cells. Amylin has important targets in the brain that mediate its actions in the modification of behavior, including thirst and satiety. In man, amylin can form islet amyloid deposits, an event linked to the reduction of b-cell mass and loss of signal-secretion coupling.
