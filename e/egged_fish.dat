50|$|<b>Fish</b> <b>egg</b> fossils are the fossilized {{remains of}} <b>fish</b> <b>eggs.</b> Fossil <b>fish</b> <b>eggs</b> have an {{extensive}} record going {{at least as}} far back as the Devonian and spanning into the Cenozoic era. The eggs of many different fish taxa have contributed to this record, including lobe-finned fish, placoderms, and sharks. Occasionally eggs are preserved still within the mother's body, or associated with fossil embryos. Some fossil eggs possibly laid by fish cannot be confidently distinguished from those laid by amphibians; for example, the ichnogenus Mazonova is known from impressions of eggs which resemble <b>eggs</b> of both <b>fish</b> and amphibians. Paleontologist B.K. Hall has observed that the discovery of fossil <b>fish</b> <b>eggs,</b> embryos and larvae link the sciences of paleontology with evo-devo.|$|R

40|$|Version of Record online: 22 SEP 2015 In the community, wine is {{sometimes}} considered responsible for adverse reactions. Commonly reported reactions to wine include skin flushing, itching and nasal congestion. A {{review of the}} literature was undertaken to identify adverse food reactions from wine, including those related to residues from <b>egg,</b> <b>fish,</b> milk, or nut processing aids and additives used in winemaking. Relatively limited literature was found reporting true allergic reactions following the ingestion of wine. This paper also examines what is known about the potential of <b>egg,</b> <b>fish,</b> milk, nut and other food proteins used in wine production to cause an allergic reaction to wine. It can be cautiously concluded that wine made with traditional proteinaceous processing aids, according to good manufacturing practice, poses little risk to the health of adult consumers with food allergies.

50|$|Other species, such as {{marine turtles}} (Superfamily: Chelonioidea), fish, and {{shellfish}} {{can also be}} adversely affected by oil spills. Sea turtles may become affected when they return to shores to lay <b>eggs.</b> <b>Fish</b> are impacted by the oil that is taken in by their gills and digestive system. Many species of shellfish can survive exposure to oil, but accumulate high levels in containment in their bodies. Oil in water can contaminate algae, plankton, and <b>fish</b> <b>eggs,</b> which in turn contaminate fish that feed on them.|$|R
