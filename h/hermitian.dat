5|$|By the {{spectral}} theorem, real symmetric matrices and complex <b>Hermitian</b> matrices have an eigenbasis; that is, every vector is expressible as a linear combination of eigenvectors. In both cases, all eigenvalues are real. This theorem can {{be generalized to}} infinite-dimensional situations related to matrices with infinitely many rows and columns, see below.|$|E
5|$|The {{significance}} {{of the concept of}} a Hilbert space was underlined with the realization that it offers one of the best mathematical formulations of quantum mechanics. In short, the states of a quantum mechanical system are vectors in a certain Hilbert space, the observables are <b>hermitian</b> operators on that space, the symmetries of the system are unitary operators, and measurements are orthogonal projections. The relation between quantum mechanical symmetries and unitary operators provided an impetus {{for the development of the}} unitary representation theory of groups, initiated in the 1928 work of Hermann Weyl. On the other hand, in the early 1930s it became clear that classical mechanics can be described in terms of Hilbert space (Koopman–von Neumann classical mechanics) and that certain properties of classical dynamical systems can be analyzed using Hilbert space techniques in the framework of ergodic theory.|$|E
25|$|Given any {{combination}} of complex numbers, bras, kets, inner products, outer products, and/or linear operators, written in bra–ket notation, its <b>Hermitian</b> conjugate can be computed by reversing {{the order of the}} components, and taking the <b>Hermitian</b> conjugate of each.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Hermitian</b> {{conjugate}} of {{a complex}} number is its complex conjugate.|$|E
25|$|With the Clifford {{action as}} above but with {{contraction}} using the <b>hermitian</b> form, this construction gives a spinor space at every point of an almost <b>Hermitian</b> manifold {{and is the}} reason why every almost complex manifold (in particular every symplectic manifold) has a Spinc structure. Likewise, every complex vector bundle on a manifold carries a Spinc structure.|$|E
25|$|A <b>Hermitian</b> metric on {{the complex}} {{representations}} of the real spin groups.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Hermitian</b> {{conjugate}} of a bra is {{the corresponding}} ket, and vice versa.|$|E
25|$|Operators {{like this}} that are equal to their adjoints are called <b>Hermitian</b> or self-adjoint.|$|E
25|$|For <b>Hermitian</b> {{matrices}} {{there are}} two notable theorems related to the trace of matrix exponentials.|$|E
25|$|Note {{that both}} {{matrices}} are <b>hermitian,</b> {{since they are}} constructed from the Fourier coefficients of real quantities.|$|E
25|$|Thus, energy {{conservation}} requires that infinitesimal transformations of a polarization state occur through {{the action of}} a <b>Hermitian</b> operator.|$|E
25|$|If A is {{not only}} <b>Hermitian</b> but also positive-definite, positive-semidefinite, negative-definite, or negative-semidefinite, then every {{eigenvalue}} is positive, non-negative, negative, or non-positive, respectively.|$|E
25|$|There is an {{invariant}} complex antilinear map b: S → S∗ that is invertible. This {{defines a}} pseudohermitian bilinear form on S and {{is called a}} <b>hermitian</b> structure.|$|E
25|$|Any {{combination}} of bras, kets, and operators are interpreted using matrix multiplication. A bra and a ket {{with the same}} label are <b>Hermitian</b> conjugates of each other.|$|E
25|$|The {{couplings}} {{between the}} position variables {{have been transformed}} away; if the Q and Π were <b>Hermitian</b> (which they are not), the transformed Hamiltonian would describe N uncoupled harmonic oscillators.|$|E
25|$|If A {{is equal}} to its {{conjugate}} transpose A*, or equivalently if A is <b>Hermitian,</b> then every eigenvalue is real. The {{same is true of}} any symmetric real matrix.|$|E
25|$|In media termed birefringent, {{in which}} the amplitudes are {{unchanged}} but a differential phase delay occurs, the Jones matrix is a unitary matrix: |g1| = |g2| = 1. Media termed diattenuating (or dichroic {{in the sense of}} polarization), in which only the amplitudes of the two polarizations are affected differentially, may be described using a <b>Hermitian</b> matrix (generally multiplied by a common phase factor). In fact, since any matrix may be written as the product of unitary and positive <b>Hermitian</b> matrices, light propagation through any sequence of polarization-dependent optical components can be written as the product of these two basic types of transformations.|$|E
25|$|Here R, C and H denote real, <b>hermitian</b> and quaternionic {{structures}} respectively, and R + R and H + H {{indicate that}} the half-spin representations both admit real or quaternionic structures respectively.|$|E
25|$|If {{there is}} an {{irreducible}} <b>hermitian</b> symmetric space of the form G/(U(1) · K), then both H and C*· H are non-symmetric irreducible affine holonomy groups, where V the tangent representation of K.|$|E
25|$|For <b>Hermitian</b> matrices, {{the leading}} {{principal}} minors {{can be used}} to test for positive definiteness and the principal minors {{can be used to}} test for positive semidefiniteness. See Sylvester's criterion for more details.|$|E
25|$|The {{family of}} <b>Hermitian</b> {{matrices}} is a proper subset of matrices that are unitarily diagonalizable. A matrix M is unitarily diagonalizable if {{and only if}} it is normal, i.e. M*M = MM*. Similar statements hold for compact normal operators.|$|E
25|$|Bra–ket {{notation}} is a notation for linear algebra, particularly {{focused on}} vectors, inner products, linear operators, <b>Hermitian</b> conjugation, and the dual space, for both finite-dimensional and infinite-dimensional complex vector spaces. It is {{specifically designed to}} ease the types of calculations that frequently come up in quantum mechanics.|$|E
25|$|In {{the physics}} {{literature}}, the term <b>Hermitian</b> {{is used in}} place of the term symmetric. It should be noted, however, that the physics literature generally glosses over the distinction between operators that are merely symmetric and operators that are actually self-adjoint (as defined in the next section).|$|E
25|$|This {{mathematical}} machinery gives a simple, {{direct way}} to compute a statistical {{property of the}} outcome of an experiment, once it is understood how to associate the initial state with a Hilbert space vector, and the measured quantity with an observable (that is, a specific <b>Hermitian</b> operator).|$|E
25|$|The Merkulov–Schwachhöfer {{classification}} {{has been}} clarified considerably by {{a connection between}} the groups on the list and certain symmetric spaces, namely the <b>hermitian</b> symmetric spaces and the quaternion-Kähler symmetric spaces. The relationship is particularly clear in the case of complex affine holonomies, as demonstrated by Schwachhöfer (2001).|$|E
25|$|Given {{a complex}} <b>hermitian</b> vector bundle V of complex rank n over a smooth {{manifold}} M, {{a representative of}} each Chern class (also called a Chern form) ck(V) of V are given as the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of the curvature form Ω of V.|$|E
25|$|Since X is a <b>Hermitian</b> matrix, {{it should}} be diagonalizable, {{and it will be}} clear from the {{eventual}} form of P that every real number can be an eigenvalue. This makes some of the mathematics subtle, since there is a separate eigenvector for every point in space.|$|E
25|$|Calculations for {{measurements}} {{performed on}} a system S postulate a Hilbert space H over the complex numbers. When the system S is prepared in a pure state, it {{is associated with a}} vector in H. Measurable quantities are associated with <b>Hermitian</b> operators acting on H: these are referred to as observables.|$|E
25|$|The {{description}} of photon polarization contains {{many of the}} physical concepts {{and much of the}} mathematical machinery of more involved quantum descriptions, such as the quantum mechanics of an electron in a potential well, and forms a fundamental basis for an understanding of more complicated quantum phenomena. Much of the mathematical machinery of quantum mechanics, such as state vectors, probability amplitudes, unitary operators, and <b>Hermitian</b> operators, emerge naturally from the classical Maxwell's equations in the description. The quantum polarization state vector for the photon, for instance, is identical with the Jones vector, usually used to describe the polarization of a classical wave. Unitary operators emerge from the classical requirement of the conservation of energy of a classical wave propagating through lossless media that alter the polarization state of the wave. <b>Hermitian</b> operators then follow for infinitesimal transformations of a classical polarization state.|$|E
25|$|The matrix {{formulation}} {{was built}} on the premise that all physical observables are represented by matrices, whose elements are indexed by two different energy levels. The set of eigenvalues of the matrix were eventually understood to be the set of all possible values that the observable can have. Since Heisenberg's matrices are <b>Hermitian,</b> the eigenvalues are real.|$|E
25|$|An ideal {{birefringent}} crystal {{transforms the}} polarization state of an electromagnetic wave without loss of wave energy. Birefringent crystals therefore provide an ideal test bed for examining the conservative transformation of polarization states. Even though this treatment is still purely classical, standard quantum {{tools such as}} unitary and <b>Hermitian</b> operators that evolve the state in time naturally emerge.|$|E
25|$|As for <b>Hermitian</b> matrices, the {{key point}} is to prove the {{existence}} {{of at least one}} nonzero eigenvector. To prove this, we cannot rely on determinants to show existence of eigenvalues, but instead one can use a maximization argument analogous to the variational characterization of eigenvalues. The above spectral theorem holds for real or complex Hilbert spaces.|$|E
25|$|The Bohr–Sommerfeld {{quantization}} conditions lead {{to questions}} in modern mathematics. Consistent semiclassical quantization condition requires {{a certain type}} of structure on the phase space, which places topological limitations on the types of symplectic manifolds which can be quantized. In particular, the symplectic form should be the curvature form of a connection of a <b>Hermitian</b> line bundle, which is called a prequantization.|$|E
25|$|The {{correspondence}} principle {{is one of}} the tools available to physicists for selecting quantum theories corresponding to reality. The principles of quantum mechanics are broad: states of a physical system form a complex vector space and physical observables are identified with <b>Hermitian</b> operators that act on this Hilbert space. The {{correspondence principle}} limits the choices to those that reproduce classical mechanics in the correspondence limit.|$|E
25|$|So far, H {{is only an}} {{abstract}} <b>Hermitian</b> operator. However using the correspondence principle {{it is possible to}} show that, in the classical limit, the expectation value of H is indeed the classical energy. The correspondence principle does not completely fix the form of the quantum Hamiltonian due to the uncertainty principle and therefore the precise form of the quantum Hamiltonian must be fixed empirically.|$|E
25|$|Freedman's {{classification}} can {{be extended}} to some cases when the fundamental group is not too complicated; for example, when it is Z there is a classification {{similar to the one}} above using <b>Hermitian</b> forms over the group ring of Z. If the fundamental group is too large (for example, a free group on 2 generators) then Freedman's techniques seem to fail and very little is known about such manifolds.|$|E
