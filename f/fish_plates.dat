500|$|Burges was {{a notable}} {{designer}} of Gothic-inspired metalwork and jewellery, {{and he has}} been cited as [...] "Pugin's successor in the Gothic revival style." [...] Although Burges was foremost an architect, Edmund Gosse described his buildings as [...] "more jewel than architecture", and Crook states that [...] "Burges's genius as a designer is expressed to perfection in his jewellery and metalwork." [...] He began with religious artifacts (candlesticks, chalices, pectoral crosses) as individual commissions or as part of the decorative scheme for buildings over which he had complete artistic control. Examples include the chalices for St Michael's Church, Brighton, the statue of the Angel which stands above St Fin Barre's and which was his personal gift to the cathedral, and the Dunedin Crozier. This item, carved in ivory and depicting St George slaying the dragon, was made for the first Bishop of Dunedin. In 1875 Burges published the design in a French magazine as a thirteenth century original, an example of his delight in tricks and jokes. Similarly inventive were his designs for <b>fish</b> <b>plates</b> for Lord Bute, in which a service of eighteen plates is decorated with punning illustrations, such as a skating skate, and a winged perch seated on the branch of a tree. He also undertook commissions for other patrons, including the Sneyd dessert service. On 3 April 1872, Burges produced a gothic-style brooch for the marriage of the Marquess of Bute to Lady Bute. In September 1873, he produced another brooch for the Marchioness, {{in the shape of a}} gothic G, a gold heraldic shield in enamel, encrusted with gems and pearls. He followed this with a necklace and earrings, an attempt to [...] "design in Castellani's archeological style." [...] Another example of the works that Burges created for Lady Bute as a present for her husband, was a silver cruet set, in the form of two medieval retainers carrying tiny barrels of salt and pepper; the answer to the question of [...] "what to give a man who (could) afford everything." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{line had}} now been carried {{three-quarters of the}} {{distance}} to Abu Hamed, which {{was still in the}} hands of the Dervishes. It had been constructed with extraordinary rapidity, for the ground was so level that only occasional cuttings were needed. The organization of labour was perfect. The men were divided into gangs, each under a head man, and each having its own special work to do. There were the men who unloaded the trucks, the labourers who did the earth work, and the more skilled hands who levelled it. As fast as the trucks were emptied, gangs of men carried the sleepers forward, and laid them down roughly in position; others followed, and corrected the distance between each. The rails were then brought along and laid down, with the <b>fish</b> <b>plates,</b> in the proper places; men put these on, and boys screwed up the nuts. Then plate layers followed and lined the rails accurately; and, when this was done, sand was thrown in and packed down between the sleepers.|$|E

These Attic <b>fish</b> <b>plates</b> are characterized by fish whose bellies are oriented towards the outside rim of the plate. In Athens the palette was restricted to red clay fabric and black gloss slip with rare uses of white overpainting. Later, Italiote Greek settlers in Southern Italy began to mass-produce more colorful <b>fish</b> <b>plates</b> in Taranto (Greek [...] "Taras"), Paestum (Greek [...] "Poseidonia"), Capua (Etruscan [...] "Capue"), and Cumae (Greek [...] "Kyme").

5000|$|The form of {{the plate}} was called a [...] "pinax" [...] or [...] "pinakion", meaning [...] "tablet," [...] because of its flat shape. The <b>fish</b> <b>plate's</b> form {{was that of a}} dimpled disk {{elevated}} on a pedestal, in other words, round and flat with a small cup in the center of plate designed to hold oil or sauce. Its rim was turned down, and often bears a decorative border, either spiraling waves, Greek key and meander motifs, or a wreath of laurel leaves. A <b>fish</b> <b>plate</b> is almost always also elevated above table level by a pedestal foot. Plates of this form are known since Minoan times (Pre-Greek), but they were not decorated with fish {{until the end of the}} fifth century BC.|$|R

5000|$|Other {{commentators}} have questioned this view, some claiming that <b>fish</b> <b>plates</b> were not missing at all, {{or that they}} were dislodged during the crash and fell into the river.

5000|$|All <b>fish</b> <b>plates</b> are red figure ware, {{meaning that}} the creatures are left in reserve, while {{the body of the}} vessel is largely painted in black glaze. Then dilute glaze and white {{overpainting}} were applied. Sometimes, in the South Italian examples the palette is enlarged to include deep red, pink, and yellow overpainting as well. This polychrome technique with its chiaroscuro (highlights and lowlights) is called [...] "sovradipinto."

50|$|The {{inhabitants}} of this antique center imported luxury pottery from Attic workshops for their domestic usage. Among the painted pottery discovered in Pistiros, vessels of krater and scyphos types predominate, while {{those of the}} kylix and pelike types are more uncommon. Scenes of everyday life, mythology, leisure, and games of the ancient Greeks are depicted on the vessels. Represented in more variety are black glazed pottery wares, including scyphoi, kanthaoroi, bowls and one-handled cups, kylices and various shapes of latter type, lekythoi, and <b>fish</b> <b>plates.</b> The import of luxurious Attic pottery in Pistiros was interrupted around the mid 3rd century BC. This trend is typical for the entire Thracian plain.|$|E
50|$|Some {{contend that}} <b>fish</b> <b>plates</b> were {{decorated}} {{with pictures of}} the seafood they were intended to hold. Most of them, however, {{have been found in}} mortuary contexts, so it might be surmised that the fish images could represent symbolic offerings for the dead. On the other hand, these plates could just as well be objects which were in popular use among the living, placed in tombs for the deceased to continue using in the hereafter. At any rate the small size of these plates could not realistically afford some of the large aquatic animals represented upon them, and the decoration must therefore be regarded as artistic or symbolic compositions rather than pictures of actual food items on the plates.|$|E
50|$|Heat waves {{can also}} damage rail roads, such as {{buckling}} and kinking rails, {{which can lead}} to slower traffic, delays, and even cancellations of service when rails are too dangerous to traverse by trains. Sun kinking is caused when certain types of rail design like short section rails welded together or <b>fish</b> <b>plate</b> rails expand and push on other sections of rail causing them to warp and kink. Sun kinking can be a serious problem in hotter climates like Southern USA, parts of Canada, the Middle East, etc.|$|R

In summertime many people prefer to eat a cold dish of vegetables cooked with olive oil (zeytinyağlı yemekler) instead of the soup, either {{before or after the}} main course, which can also be a chicken, meat or <b>fish</b> <b>plate.</b>|$|R
50|$|Acts of {{sabotage}} occurred {{throughout the}} country. For instance on the railways the rails and <b>fish</b> <b>plates</b> were removed. In Waskaduwa the rails with the sleepers were torn up {{for over a}} mile, and the telegraph posts toppled over along the whole stretch. In Totagamuwa, the wooden sleepers were set on fire which warped the rails. In numerous places telephone and telegraph wires were cut. In Egoda Uyana, the demonstrators invaded the station captured a train and uncoupled the engine so that the train could not leave. Buses particularly those of the Gamini Bus Co. Ltd. and the High Level Road Bus Co. Ltd. were stopped, stoned and smashed by the demonstrators.

On 7 July 2015, Federal Minister for Railways Khawaja Saad Rafique while putting the responsibility of the incident on the deceased driver revealed that the train incident occurred due to over-speeding. He also reiterated that Chawan bridge and the railway track was perfectly fine.
