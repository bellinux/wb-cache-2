30|$|The {{traditional}} {{defenses against}} jamming include spread spectrum techniques [5] where {{the energy of}} the signal is spread across a very wide bandwidth. Another important class of antijamming techniques is channel hopping [6, 7] where the signal transmission channel is changing over time. While spread spectrum and frequency hopping techniques are important physical layer mechanisms for combating <b>jamming,</b> additional <b>protection</b> is required at the packet-level. As in the case of standard wireless protocols such as IEEE 802.11 and Bluetooth, the jammer may know the pseudorandom noise code or frequency hopping sequence.|$|R

Interoperability increases survivability by providing alternate paths. Interoperability also improves total system reliability and cost effectiveness, and it permits a flexible, distributed communications architecture to evolve. To implement this approach, functional satellite data link standards {{are needed to}} pull together mission data relay, communications, and tracking, telemetry and command (TT&C) requirements {{so that they can}} be satisfied by a common link design. The basic requirement which unifies these diverse users is their need for uplink <b>jamming</b> <b>protection</b> and scintillation resistance (in a perturbed atmosphere) at low (75 bps to 19. 2 Kbps) data rates. While the downlink and crosslink requirements are more diverse, they do not constitute major drivers of the standard. This paper describes Space Division’s standardization effort, the links to be standardized, the parameters that must be defined and an evolutionary implementation approach. The first satellite-ground links to be standardized will use 44 / 20 GHz with wideband spreading for jam resistance, while the crosslinks will use 60 GHz to avoid terrestrial jamming. Key issues are discussed, such as the conflicting requirements between TT&C and communications and the tradeoffs between minimum designs and flexibility...|$|R

The simulation is {{used to determine the}} optimum distributed C 2 W/EA configuration of assets including placement of sensors and system selection (jammer or receiver or both) for important mission scenarios leading {{to a better understanding of}} the minimum requirements for suppression of enemy air defense operations. ARES is a pulse level simulation that models the complex interaction of multiple radar systems being acted upon by multiple AEA aircraft, considering target aircraft radar cross section (RCS) and altitude, terrain masking effects, both standoff <b>jamming</b> and self <b>protection</b> <b>jamming</b> effects, and network connection effect. Its features include an object%-oriented scenario workbook allowing the users to build a battlefield scenario and a search procedure based on a genetic algorithm (GA) for optimizing configurations of what the core and peripheral components of the AEA architecture should be. ARES is available in two forms: Graphical User Interface (GUI) and parallel. ARES' GUI runs on a personal computer (PC) and its primary application is for setting up scenarios and post processing.

40|$|Due to {{the shared}} nature of {{wireless}} medium, wireless communications {{are more vulnerable}} to security threats. In my PhD work, I focused on two types of threats: relay attacks and jamming. UWB-IR physical layer technology has seen a great development {{during the last decade}} which makes it a promising candidate for short range wireless communications. My main goal was to exploit UWB-IR physical layer characteristics in order to reinforce security of wireless communications. By the simple way of signal relaying, the adversary can defeat wireless authentication protocols. The first countermeasure proposed to thwart these relay attacks was distance bounding protocol. The concept of distance bounding relies on the combination of two sides: an authentication cryptographic side and a distance checking side. In this context, I propose two new distance bounding protocols that significantly improve the security of existing distance bounding protocols by means of UWB-IR physical layer parameters. The first protocol called STHCP is based on using secret time-hopping codes. Whereas, the second called SMCP is based on secret mapping codes. Security analysis and comparison to {{the state of the art}} highlight various figures of merit of my proposition. Jamming consists in the emission of noise over the channel while communication is taking place and constitutes a major problem to the security of wireless communications. In a first contribution, I have determined worst case Gaussian noise parameters (central frequency and bandwidth) against UWB-IR communication employing PPM modulation and a non-coherent receiver. The metric considered for jammer optimization is the signal-to-jamming ratio at the output of the receiver. In a second contribution, I propose a new jamming model by analogy to attacks against ciphering algorithms. The new model leads to distinguish various jamming scenarios ranging from the best case to the worst case. Moreover, I propose a modification of the UWB-IR physical layer which allows to restrict any jamming problem to the most favorable scenario. The modification is based on using a cryptographic modulation depending on a stream cipher. The new radio has the advantage to combine the resistance to <b>jamming</b> and the <b>protection</b> from eavesdropping. Finally, I focused on the problem of security embedding on an existing UWB-IR network. Security embedding consists in adding security features directly at the physical layer and sending them concurrently with data. The embedding mechanism should satisfy a compatibility concern to existing receivers in the network. I propose two new embedding techniques which rely on the superposition of a pulse orthogonal to the original pulse by the form or by the position. Performances analysis reveal that both embedding techniques satisfy all system design constraints. Du fait de la nature ouverte et partagée du canal radio, les communications sans fil souffrent de vulnérabilités sérieuses en terme de sécurité. Dans ces travaux de thèse, je me suis intéressé particulièrement à deux classes d’attaques à savoir l’attaque par relais et l’attaque par déni de service (brouillage). La technologie de couche physique UWB-IR a connu un grand essor au cours de cette dernière décennie et elle est une candidate intéressante pour les réseaux sans fil à courte portée. Mon objectif principal était d’exploiter les caractéristiques de la couche physique UWB-IR afin de renforcer la sécurité des communications sans fil. L’attaque par relais peut mettre à défaut les protocoles cryptographiques d’authentification. Pour remédier à cette menace, les protocoles de distance bounding ont été proposés. Dans ce cadre, je propose deux nouveaux protocoles (STHCP : Secret Time-Hopping Code Protocol et SMCP : Secret Mapping Code Protocol) qui améliorent considérablement la sécurité des protocoles de distance bounding au moyen des paramètres de la radio UWB-IR. Le brouillage consiste en l’émission intentionnelle d’un signal sur le canal lors du déroulement d’une communication. Mes contributions concernant le problème de brouillage sont triples. D’abord, j’ai déterminé les paramètres d’un brouilleur gaussien pire cas contre un récepteur UWB-IR non-cohérent. En second lieu, je propose un nouveau modèle de brouillage par analogie avec les attaques contre le système de chiffrement. Troisièmement, je propose une modification rendant la radio UWB-IR plus robuste au brouillage. Enfin, dans une dernière partie de mes travaux, je me suis intéressé au problème d’intégrer la sécurité à un réseau UWB-IR en suivant l’approche d’embedding. Le principe de cette approche consiste à superposer et à transmettre les informations de sécurité simultanément avec les données et avec une contrainte de compatibilité. Ainsi, je propose deux nouvelles techniques d’embedding pour la couche physique UWB-IR afin d’intégrer un service d’authentification...|$|R
