40|$|With {{the advent}} of {{alternative}} fuels, such as biodiesels and related blends, {{it is important to}} develop an understanding of their effects on inter-cycle variability which, in turn, influences engine performance as well as its emission. Using four methanol trans-esterified biomass fuels of differing carbon chain length and degree of unsaturation, this paper provides insight into the effect that alternative fuels have on inter-cycle variability. The experiments were conducted with a heavy-duty Cummins, turbo-charged, common-rail compression ignition engine. Combustion performance is reported in terms of the following key in-cylinder parameters: indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP), net heat release rate (NHRR), standard <b>deviation</b> <b>of</b> <b>variability</b> (StDev), coefficient of variation (CoV), peak pressure, peak pressure timing and maximum rate of pressure rise. A link is also established between the cyclic variability and oxygen ratio, which is a good indicator of stoichiometry. The results show that the fatty acid structures did not {{have a significant effect on}} injection timing, injection duration, injection pressure, StDev of IMEP, or the timing of peak motoring and combustion pressures. However, a significant effect was noted on the premixed and diffusion combustion proportions, combustion peak pressure and maximum rate of pressure rise. Additionally, the boost pressure, IMEP and combustion peak pressure were found to be directly correlated to the oxygen ratio. The emission of particles positively correlates with oxygen content in the fuel as well as in the air-fuel mixture resulting in a higher total number of particles per unit of mass...|$|E
40|$|In any {{distribution}} system {{the processing of}} inbound material has significant indirect impact upon the customer experience. The inbound process encompasses all the steps to get a product into the distribution center (DC). It starts with the inventory and procurement policies and ends with the product being in a physical storage location at the DC. In order for a product {{to be sold to}} a customer it must first be brought through this inbound process (with the exception of drop shipping) and therefore it is important for this to be completed in a timely and predictable manner. However, {{from the perspective of a}} given distribution center within a network, there is significant variability of product arriving at the facility. The need to get product into inventory quickly and predictably must be balanced with the significant challenges of handling this variability. The variability can come from a variety of upstream sources: the procurement policies, the vendors/manufacturers, or the inbound transportation providers. At one facility in the Amazon network the day to day standard <b>deviation</b> <b>of</b> <b>variability</b> was approximately 15 - 30 % of units. This variability must be handled efficiently at the facility while balancing all of the other operational goals of the distribution center. The goal of this research is to analyze the inbound system at one online distributor - Amazon. com - to measure the inbound variability and to perform an investigation into methods for handling the inbound variability to the distribution center. This research is applicable to any distribution company looking to manage outbound service levels through improvements on the inbound system. (cont.) This thesis will focus on two key practical methods for handling the variability in the inbound product arrival: 1. management and scheduling of the labor workforce (labor supply) and 2. managing the release of work into the distribution center (work demand). by David O.

40|$|The {{assumption}} of relationship between recruitment and spawning stock {{is the cornerstone}} of both the Precautionary Approach and the use of a Maximum Sustainable Yield target for fisheries management, as the failure to include such relationship suggests that providing a measure of stock protection is unnecessary. The implications of fitting different functional forms and stochastic distributions to stock and recruit data are investigated. The importance of these considerations is shown by taking a practical example from a specific management problem: the management plans for North Eastern Atlantic (NEA) mackerel (Scomber scombrus) a major fish stock with average annual catch of 600, 000 t. Commonly historic stock dynamics from a stock assessment explains only a small proportion <b>of</b> the recruitment <b>variability.</b> These data are used to investigate how best to reflect the uncertainty in the stock-recruit relationship.

Slope-corrected standard <b>deviation,</b> an index <b>of</b> <b>variability</b> <b>of</b> the underlying ideal threshold, was used as a common metric for the different test conditions.

40|$|Ecotoxicological hazard {{assessment}} relies on species effect data to estimate quantities {{such as the}} predicted no-effect concentration. While there is {{a concerted effort to}} quantify uncertainty in risk assessments, the uncertainty due to intertest variability in species effect measurements is an overlooked component. The European Union Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation, and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) guidance document suggests that multiple toxicity records for a given chemical–species combination should be aggregated by the geometric mean. Ignoring this issue or applying unjustified so-called harmonization methods weakens the defensibility of uncertainty quantification and interpretation about properties of ecological models, for example, the predicted no-effect concentration. In the present study, the authors propose a simple and broadly theoretically justifiable model to quantify intertest variability and analyze it using Bayesian methods. The value of data in ecotoxicity databases is maximized by using (interval-) censored data. An exploratory analysis is provided to support the model. The authors conclude, based on a large ecotoxicity database of acute effects to aquatic species, that the standard <b>deviation</b> <b>of</b> intertest <b>variability</b> is approximately a factor (or fold-difference) of 3.

40|$|The {{variability}} {{inherent in}} wind power production will require increased {{flexibility in the}} power system, when {{a significant amount of}} load is covered with wind power. Standard <b>deviation</b> (σ) <b>of</b> <b>variability</b> in load and net load (load net of wind) has been used when estimating the effect of wind power on the short term reserves of the power system. This method is straightforward and easy to use when data on wind power and load exist. In this paper, the use <b>of</b> standard <b>deviation</b> as a measure of reserve requirement is studied. The confidence level given by ± 3 - 6 times σ is compared to other means of deriving the extra reserve requirements over different operating time scales. Also taking into account the total <b>variability</b> <b>of</b> load and wind generation and only the unpredicted part <b>of</b> the <b>variability</b> <b>of</b> load and wind is compared.

40|$|In {{this paper}} both a {{microwave}} attenuation measurement along a horizontal line and multiple point gauge measurements are analyzed as possible ground-truth designs to validate satellite precipitation retrieval algorithms {{at the field}} of view spatial level (typically about 20 km). The design consists of comparing a sequence of pairs of contemporaneous measurements taken from the ground and from space. The authors examine theoretically the variance of expected differences between the two systems. The line average measurement leads to a smaller mean-square error compared to the case of a single point gauge, since some <b>of</b> the small-scale <b>variability</b> <b>of</b> the rain field is smoothed away by the line integration. The multiple point gauge measurements also give smaller mean-square error than that of a single point gauge. The centroid of the line and point gauge configurations are considered to be located randomly inside {{the field of view}} for different overpasses. A space-time spectral formalism is used with a noise-forced diffusive rain field to find the mean-square error.

Results: The model based on the hip accelerometer data and the model based on the ankle accelerometer data correctly classified the five activities 80. 4 % and 77. 7 % of the time, respectively, whereas the model based on the data from both sensors achieved a percentage of 83. 0 %. The hip model produced a better classification of the activities cycling, using the stairs, and sitting, whereas the ankle model was better able to correctly classify the activities walking and standing still. All three models often misclassified using the stairs and standing still. The accuracy of the models significantly decreased when a distinction was made between regular versus brisk walking or cycling and between going up and going down the stairs. Conclusions: Relatively simple ANN models perform well in identifying the type but not {{the speed of the}} activity of adults from accelerometer data. © 2010 by the American College of Sports Medicine...|$|R

40|$|ObjectivesContinuous flow left {{ventricular}} assist devices {{are used in}} end-stage systolic heart failure. However, about {{one half of the}} patients with heart failure exhibit diastolic dysfunction with a normal ejection fraction. In the present study, the possible hemodynamic consequences of continuous flow {{left ventricular}} assist devices use for these patients were investigated. MethodsA previously developed cardiovascular model was modified to reproduce the peculiar hemodynamics of heart failure with a normal ejection fraction. The model was based on and validated with patient data derived from the published data. A continuous flow left ventricular assist device model was included and the hemodynamic effects of pump support evaluated at rest and during exercise. ResultsThe model accurately reproduced the published data both at rest and during exercise, leading to simulated hemodynamic values within the standard <b>deviations</b> <b>of</b> patient <b>variability.</b> At rest, pump support decreased the end-diastolic left ventricular pressure (6 vs 15 mm Hg) and volume (88 vs 135 mL). During exercise, maximal pump support substantially unloaded the left ventricle (end-diastolic pressure, 14 vs 35 mm Hg; volume, 133 vs 158 mL) and the pulmonary venous circulation (left atrial pressure, 12 vs 24 mm Hg) and resulted in a slight increase in cardiac output (11. 7 vs 9. 9 L/min). ConclusionsThe simulation results suggested that continuous flow left ventricular assist devices improve the hemodynamics in patients with heart failure and a normal ejection fraction. For an optimal use of continuous flow left ventricular assist devices, low speeds should be maintained at rest, to avoid suction. However, during physical activity, higher speeds are needed to prevent an abnormal increase in the ventricular filling pressures typical of patients with heart failure and a normal ejection fraction...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a method for {{predicting}} the psychological states of spectators watching professional baseball games at a stadium. This method includes a real time measurement of instantaneous heart rate (i. e., the inverse of the RR interval) without preventing the subject from watching the game and a mathematical procedure used to predict moment by moment psychological states by correlating the degree of a psychological state with the strength of heart rate response, defined as the mean <b>deviation</b> <b>of</b> heart rate <b>variability</b> from a linear regression line from 5 sec before to 25 sec after an event during a baseball game. We recorded the instantaneous heart rates of 10 subjects (total of 27 cases) while they watched Japanese professional baseball games at a stadium and had them subjectively rate the degree of their psychological states in an after-event interview. We identified three psychological states (happiness, excitement, and vigor) whose strength can be predicted from the strength of heart rate response. Analysis of the measured data clarified that heart rate response had a significant correlation with the subjective rating of the intensity of happiness (r = 0. 56, p < 0. 0001), vigor (r = 0. 55, p < 0. 0001), and excitement (r = 0. 49, p < 0. 0001) ...|$|R
