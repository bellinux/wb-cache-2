5|$|At 16:30, {{the gunmen}} {{released}} their first hostage, Frieda Mozaffarian. She had been unwell since the siege began, and Oan <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> {{a doctor to}} be sent into the embassy to treat her, but the police refused. The other hostages deceived Oan into believing that Mozaffarian was pregnant, and Oan eventually released Mozaffarian after her condition deteriorated.|$|E
5|$|Federal {{prosecutors}} {{launched an}} investigation {{to determine if}} he had acted out of hatred for Obama. Writings by Ortega-Hernandez and testimonies from {{those who knew him}} revealed that he believed that he was Jesus, and that President Obama was the Antichrist and the devil. Ortega-Hernandez was not found to be affiliated with any extremist groups. In September 2013, Ortega-Hernandez pled guilty to two of the nineteen charges against him: one count of destruction of property and one count of discharging a firearm during a crime of violence. As part of his plea bargain, the remaining charges were dropped, including the charge of attempting to assassinate the President, which carried a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. On March 31, 2014, Ortega-Hernandez was sentenced to 25 years imprisonment by Judge Rosemary M. Collyer. His lawyers <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> a 10-year sentence, stating Ortega-Hernandez was suffering from depression and stress. Prosecutors <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> the maximum sentence of 27½ years. He is serving his sentence at United States Penitentiary, Beaumont, with a release date of October 24, 2033.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, {{a dispute}} arose between Foran, {{in his role}} as Stanley Cup trustee, and the NHL. The American Hockey League <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> a Stanley Cup {{challenge}} against the champions of the NHL. Foran had agreed to the challenge and ordered the NHL to comply, but the NHL refused to play the challenge. Foran was fired from his position as Senators' president and was replaced by Redmond Quain.|$|E

5|$|Against Oueddei stood freshly arrived French forces. Already in 1977, after Oueddei first offensives, Malloum <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> a French {{military}} {{return in}} Chad, but President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing {{was at first}} reluctant to commit himself before the 1978 legislative elections; also, France was afraid of damaging its profitable commercial and diplomatic relations with Libya. However, the rapid deterioration {{of the situation in}} Chad resolved the President on 20 February 1978 to start Opération Tacaud, which by April brought 2,500 troops to Chad to secure the capital from the rebels.|$|E
5|$|Although she {{was never}} {{successful}} in her {{more than a decade}} of legal pursuits for recompense from the United States government for seized land, in 1911 she was finally granted a $1,250 a month lifetime pension by the Territory of Hawaii. Historian Sydney Lehua Iaukea noted that besides being a greatly reduced figure from what she <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> recompense, it also never addressed the question of the legality of the seizure itself.|$|E

5|$|Evans {{was asked}} to produce the group Natural Gas, and {{was working on a}} book of memoirs called Living The Beatles' Legend which he was due to deliver to his publishers, Grosset & Dunlap, on 12 January 1976. Evans was {{depressed}} about the separation from his wife (who <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> a divorce before Christmas) even though he was then living with his new girlfriend, Fran Hughes, in a rented motel apartment at 8122 West 4th Street in Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|On 26 November, a week's filming with Firth, Rush, and Jacobi {{began at}} Ely Cathedral, the {{location}} used for Westminster Abbey. The production <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> permission to {{film in the}} Abbey but were denied due {{to the demands of}} tourism. Though Lincoln Cathedral is architecturally a closer match to the Abbey, they preferred Ely, a favoured filming location. Its size allowed them to build sets showing not just the coronation, but the preparations before it.|$|E
5|$|The Simpsons' {{family members}} that showed up {{took some time}} to be made, but the staff enjoyed the results.

5|$|The last of {{the bronze}} reliefs on the column's {{pedestals}} was not completed until May 1854, and the four lions, although {{part of the original}} design, were only added in 1867. Each lion weighs seven tons. A hoarding remained around the base of Nelson's Column for some years and some of its upper scaffolding remained in place. Landseer, the sculptor, <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> a lion that had died at the London Zoo to be brought to his studio. He took so long to complete sketches that its corpse began to decompose and some parts had to be improvised. The statues have paws that resemble cats more than lions.|$|E
5|$|The {{third stage}} of Zeppelin {{involved}} a delay until 21 May, {{on the basis}} that the Soviets <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> them to be synchronised with their own invasion plans. This ran from 21 April until 9 May, when a major revision to the plans (stage four) was introduced. The Twelfth Army and Polish forces would land in Albania and Croatia, bypassing Greece due to mutiny within Allied Greek forces in Africa, with an invasion set in June. A major invasion of Southern France was also added, codenamed Vendetta.|$|E
5|$|All five {{versions}} of the speech differ widely from one another in regard to particulars. All versions, except that in the Gesta Francorum, generally agree that Urban talked about the violence of European society {{and the necessity of}} maintaining the Peace of God; about helping the Greeks, who <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> assistance; about the crimes being committed against Christians in the east; and about a new kind of war, an armed pilgrimage, and of rewards in heaven, where remission of sins was offered to any who might die in the undertaking. They do not all specifically mention Jerusalem as the ultimate goal. However, {{it has been argued that}} Urban's subsequent preaching reveals that he expected the expedition to reach Jerusalem all along. According to one version of the speech, the enthusiastic crowd responded with cries of Deus vult! ("God wills it!"). However, other {{versions of}} the speech do not include this detail.|$|E

5|$|Controversy hit the Championship in the 1921–22 season {{which saw}} the major clubs (including Pro Vercelli, Bologna and Juventus) in {{dispute with the}} FIGC. The best 24 teams <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> a {{reduction}} in the number of clubs in the top division in accordance with a plan drawn up by Vittorio Pozzo, the Italian national team coach. Pozzo's plan was dismissed and the CCI (Italian: Confederazione Calcistica Italiana) was founded and organised a 1921–22 CCI league (Prima Divisione) to run concurrently with the 1921–22 season (Prima Categoria) organised by the FIGC. Therefore, that season saw two champions: Novese (FIGC) and Pro Vercelli (CCI). The schism ended when FIGC accepted to reduce the Northern Championship 1922–23 to only 36 clubs ("Compromesso Colombo/Colombo compromise"); from 1923–24 the Northern Championship was reduced to 24 clubs divided into two groups.|$|E
5|$|During the campaign, Combs had {{advocated}} a progressive platform that included increased funding for education, highways, parks, industry, and airports. Soon after his election, he won {{approval for a}} three-percent sales tax to pay a bonus to military veterans, although he could have funded the bonuses with a one-percent tax. He <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> the larger tax in order to fund his other priorities. As {{a result of the}} sales tax, Combs presided over the state's first billion-dollar budget. One study showed that Kentucky doubled its per capita expenditures between 1957 and 1962, growing its appropriations faster than any other state. Combs held large public relations events for each tax-funded project that was completed, declaring in dedication speeches that the sales tax had made the project possible.|$|E
5|$|Dönitz {{contacted}} the British {{commander of the}} city of Flensburg, asking him for permission to conduct a formal state funeral, which was approved. That funeral, the last such of the Third Reich, was held on 16 May 1945 with Dönitz, Adolf Hitler's successor as Head of State, delivering the eulogy. In advance, Dönitz had ordered a board of inquiry and court martial to clarify the circumstances of the shooting. During the court martial, Gottlob stated that, in accordance with his orders, he <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> the password three times without receiving a response from the person, whom he could not visually identify in the darkness. Without aiming he had fired his rifle from the hip. The chain of events was confirmed by the watch leader. The court ruled that Gottlob was not guilty and cleared him of any fault.|$|E

5|$|In 1922 Gaudí was commissioned, by the Franciscan Padre Angélico Aranda, to {{construct}} a church dedicated to the Assumption in the Chilean city of Rancagua. Gaudí apologised {{and said that he}} was occupied exclusively with the Sagrada Família, but sent some sketches of the Assumption chapel which he had designed for the apse of the Sagrada Família, which more or less coincided with what Padre Aranda <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for.</b> Unfortunately this project was not carried out, though there are currently plans by the Chilean architect Christian Matzner to take up the project. The President of Chile, Michelle Bachelet, has announced that building will begin in 2015, with an expected completion in 2017 and at a cost of $7million. Once completed it will become the first of Gaudí's works to be constructed in the Americas.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, UBS {{agreed to}} pay US$160 million in restitution, {{penalties}} and disgorgement of profits for rigging bids in the U.S. municipal bond market, after the bank and three of its employees were charged by the U.S. Department of Justice in 2010. In July 2013, the three employees were convicted of conspiracy in the muni market fraud: former UBS Vice President Gary Heinz was sentenced to 27 months in prison and fined US$400,000; former UBS global commodities chief Peter Ghavami was sentenced to 18 months and fined US $1 million; and former UBS VP Michael Welty received a 16-month sentence and fined US$300,000. In addition to conspiracy, Ghavami and Heinz also were convicted of wire fraud. Federal prosecutors <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> much harsher sentences, but U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood rebuffed the request. Wood said that the criminal behavior of the three was an aberration from their normal law-abiding lives.|$|E

This also gave the opportunity for a new interior set to be designed, as Belbin had been unhappy with the original set designed for the series, which she felt was too restrictive to shoot in.|$|E
