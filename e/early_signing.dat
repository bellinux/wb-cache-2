500|$|According {{to music}} {{journalist}} Chris Hunt, {{in the weeks}} after writing the song, McCartney [...] "test his latest composition on anyone too polite to refuse. And that meant everyone." [...] On 30 June, after recording the Black Dyke Mills Band's rendition of his instrumental [...] "Thingumybob", in Yorkshire, McCartney stopped at a village in Bedfordshire and performed [...] "Hey Jude" [...] at a local pub. He also regaled members of the Bonzo Dog Band with the song while producing their single [...] "I'm the Urban Spaceman", in London, and interrupted a recording session by the Barron Knights to do the same. Ron Griffith of the group the Iveys – soon to be known as Badfinger and, like the Black Dyke Mills Band, an <b>early</b> <b>signing</b> to the Beatles' new record label Apple Records – later recalled that on their first day in the studio, McCartney [...] "gave us a full concert rendition of 'Hey Jude'".|$|E
500|$|Johnson {{spent much}} of his {{childhood}} in Baltimore. [...] He played his sophomore and junior season of high school basketball at Moorhead Senior High School in Moorhead, Minnesota. Johnson transferred from Minnesota to Towson Catholic High School prior to his senior season. [...] During the <b>early</b> <b>signing</b> period from November 13 through November 20, 1991, Johnson, who was considering several Ivy League schools as well as Northeastern University, verbally committed to Boston University. On December 1, 1991, Boston University announced that Johnson signed a letter of intent. During his senior season, Johnson lead Towson to the Baltimore Catholic Basketball League Championship. [...] Following the season, he earned Baltimore Catholic Basketball League All-league first-team recognition. He was also selected to participate in the Rodney Beasley East vs. West All-Star Games, sponsored by the Baltimore Metro Coaches Association. He was also a second team All-metro selection and following his 1992 graduation attended the Fork Union Military Academy in Virginia for a postgraduate year. In April 1993, after playing a year a Fork Union, Johnson signed a letter of intent with Herb Sendek's Miami (OH) team, but upon being accepted by Princeton University in June of that year, he revoked his letter.|$|E
40|$|This study aims to {{understand}} early signs’ sensemaking relevance to identifying unknown unknowns on innovative projects. When managing these projects, <b>early</b> <b>signs</b> {{of changes in}} the environment, combined with a sensemaking process, can help identify them prior to their occurrence and mitigate unwanted effects of these uncertainties. To this end, we conducted a field research to assess 16 projects, totaling 35 events representative of this kind of uncertainty. Based on in-depth interviews, we performed an initial qualitative analysis, and then applied non-parametric statistical tests. <b>Early</b> <b>signs</b> perception in cases where external factors may cause the occurrence of unknown unknowns show that this perception and the search for information are relevant to identifying unk unks. Furthermore, some biases, such as overconfidence and unrealistic optimism, can hinder it. There was a high prevalence of project managers detecting <b>early</b> <b>signs</b> of change in their projects {{at the beginning of the}} project. However, the majority of perceived <b>early</b> <b>signs</b> can be considered to be the first symptoms of a problem. Thus, as a contribution, we suggest: learning processes, which can provide sensemaking for <b>early</b> <b>signs</b> in unknown unknowns; project managers stimulating their team to be alert to environmental changes that may affect the project; and discussion of <b>early</b> <b>signs</b> perceived by the team during stakeholder management...|$|R

500|$|November 12, 2008, {{marked the}} first day of the <b>early</b> <b>signing</b> period for high school seniors wishing to become {{eligible}} student-athletes in the 2009-2010 academic year. The early period ended on November 19, 2008 for NCAA college basketball teams (the regular signing period is from April 15 – May 20, 2009). [...] However, verbal commitments are usually accurate predictors of signing activity. [...] Based on verbals and very early signings, Big Ten Conference rivals Indiana, Minnesota and Illinois had top 25 signing classes, but Michigan did not according to both ESPN and Scout.com. The team was the choice of four blue chip prospects who followed through on their verbal commitments and signed letters of intent including Matt Vogrich and Darius Morris. The [...] Morris was listed among the top 15 point guards in the nation by Scout.com, Rivals.com and ESPN. [...] Kelvin Grady, who had played 64 games and made 33 starts during his first two seasons, was going to transfer from the program at the end of the prior season, but he became a wide receiver on the 2009 Michigan Wolverines football team.

40|$|Objective: We {{observed}} sensory {{features in}} toddlers ages 12 – 24 mo with {{risk factors for}} autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and explored their relationship to general development and <b>early</b> <b>signs</b> of ASD. Method: Participants (N = 46) included toddlers with higher risk for ASD. All participants were administered standardized assessments of sensory features, <b>early</b> <b>signs</b> of ASD, and general development at a single study visit. Results: Sensory features in toddlers were characterized as either adaptive or reactive. Toddlers with more difficulties in oral sensory processing displayed more <b>early</b> <b>signs</b> of ASD. Typical oral and auditory processing were associated with higher cognitive function, and toddlers with fewer sensory features overall had more mature language skills. Conclusion: Specific sensory features were associated with both <b>early</b> <b>signs</b> of ASD and less mature general development. Replication of this preliminary study is required...|$|R
