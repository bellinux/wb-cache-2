Chinchoros covered the whole body with manganese dust, brilliant ochre or clay. The skin of the mummies from Melanesia was coated with fats mixed with red ochre, and Egyptians impregnated the dead bodies and linen bandages with herbal oils derived from Cedar Tree (Cedrus atlantica).

In this study, biocontrol effects of Trichoderma isolates, both separately and their combined effects were evaluated against Fusarium oxysporum, F. solani pathogen. In this investigation the ability of Trichoderma harzianum and T. asperellum isolates, isolated from soil and chickpea root, were compared with combination of three fungal lentil Fusarium rot. Three isolates (Trichoderma) of isolates T 1, and T 2 around Fusarium oxysporum and F. solani hyphae. Volatile metabolites of all isolates reduced the mycelial growth of fusarium diseas pathogen. T 1 and T 2 isolates and their combination were more effective than other treatments to control the disease, where it reduced 75 to 78 % disease. All of treatments showed significant differences with control (Trichoderma harzianum) T 1, (Trichoderma asperellum) T 2, were selected before test (shown good antagonist effect) after screening tests for antifungal combination effects against Fusarium disease pathogen in greenhouse.

From a total of 210 isolates, 103 strains inhibited the growth {{of at least one}} microorganism from the test panel including Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria as well as a yeast.

40|$|Abstract Background Antibiotic {{resistance}} {{is not confined}} to pathogens, but is also widespread in various natural environments. In nature the microbes producing antibiotic compounds have been around for millions of years. Heavy use of antibiotics in medicine and veterinary practice may lead to the accumulation of resistance genes in microbial populations, followed by a rise in multiresistant bacteria. Results To test the extent of resistance among aquatic bacteria, we have collected 760 isolates resistant to at least one antibiotic. The phylogeny of the <b>isolates</b> <b>covers</b> a wide range of Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes. In order {{to determine the extent of}} multiresistance, the isolates were tested on six antibiotics. As the growth rate of the different bacteria was highly variable, the classical medical resistance tests could not be used, and an alternative method considering the full growth curve was developed. In general, the overall resistances to different antibiotics could be explained by random, independent distribution. An exception to this was the resistances against tetracycline and chloramphenicol, which tended to occur in pairs. Conclusions We conclude that there is no massive spread of multiresistance determinants in the studied environment, although some specific cases can be found, awaiting for molecular characterization of the resistance mechanisms. </p...|$|R

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{population}} biology of Streptococcus pneumoniae in developing countries, although the majority of pneumococcal infections occur in this setting. The aim {{of the study was to}} apply MLST to investigate the population biology of S. pneumoniae in West Africa. Seventy three invasive and carriage S. pneumoniae isolates from three West African countries including The Gambia, Nigeria and Ghana were investigated. The <b>isolates</b> <b>covered</b> seven serotypes (1, 3, 5, 6 A, 11, 14, 23 F) and were subjected to multilocus sequence typing and antibiotic susceptibility testing. Overall, 50 different sequence types (STs) were identified, of which 38 % (29) were novel. The most common ST was a novel clone-ST 4012 (6. 5 %), and some clones including STs 913, 925, 1737, 2160 and 3310 appeared to be specific to the study region. Two STs including ST 63 and ST 4012 were associated with multiple serotypes indicating a history of serotype switching. ST 63 was associated with serotypes 3 and 23 F, while ST 4012 was associated with serotypes 6 A and 23. eBURST analyses using the stringent 6 / 7 identical loci definition grouped the 50 STs into 5 clonal complexes and 65 singletons, expressing a high level of genetic diversity among the isolates. Compared to the other serotypes, serotypes 1 and 5 isolates appeared to be more clonal. Internationally recognized antibiotic resistant clones of S. pneumoniae were generally absent in the population investigated and the only multidrug resistant isolate identified (1 / 66) belong to the Pneumocococcal Epidemiology Network clone ST 63.

Quite recently, pneumococcal conjugate vaccines have been developed, and {{have been shown to}} be superior to the previous polyvalent polysaccharide vaccine of the organism. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) are being introduced in many West African countries and it is important to understand the expected performance, relevance, and limitations of these vaccines in the subregion. Aim: The objective of the study presented here was to provide epidemiological insights into PCVs in West Africa based on the prevailing pneumococcal serotypes in the subregion. Methods: A systematic review was carried out on pneumococcal serotypes causing invasive and noninvasive diseases in West Africa. Studies included in the review were those that reported at least 20 serotyped pneumococcal isolates and which were conducted prior to the introduction of PCVs in the region in 2009. The proportion of pneumococcal disease associated with each serotype as well as the serotype coverage of various PCVs (PCV 7, PCV 10, and PCV 13) were calculated. Results: The data covered 718 serotyped pneumococcal isolates from six West African countries: Burkina Faso, Ghana, Nigeria, Mali, Senegal, and The Gambia. The 718 <b>isolates</b> <b>covered</b> more than 20 serotypes. Serotype 1 was the most prevalent serotype (32 %), followed by serotype 5 (15 %), serotype 6 (7 %), serotype 2 (6 %), serotype 3 (6 %), and serotype 12 (5 %). The estimated serotype coverage of PCVs among the West African countries was 2 %– 36 % for PCV 7, 39 %– 80 % for PCV 10, and 65 %– 87 % for PCV 13. Conclusion: A pneumococcal capsular vaccine for use in West Africa must contain serotypes 1 and 5, the most important serotypes responsible for pneumococcal disease in the region. Consequently, while PCV 10 and PCV 13 are generally suitable for use in West Africa, PCV 7 is unsuitable.
