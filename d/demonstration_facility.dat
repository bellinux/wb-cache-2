25|$|On March 22, 2015, Saga University {{opened a}} Flash-type {{desalination}} <b>demonstration</b> <b>facility</b> on Kumejima. This satellite of their Institute of Ocean Energy uses post-OTEC deep seawater from the Okinawa OTEC <b>Demonstration</b> <b>Facility</b> and raw surface seawater to produce desalinated water. Air is {{extracted from the}} closed system with a vacuum pump. When raw sea water is pumped into the flash chamber it boils, allowing pure steam to rise and the salt and remaining seawater to be removed. The steam is returned to liquid in a heat exchanger with cold post-OTEC deep seawater. The desalinated water {{can be used in}} hydrogen production or drinking water (if minerals are added).|$|E

25|$|Japan {{has also}} been researching {{agricultural}} uses of Deep Sea Water since 2000 at the Okinawa Deep Sea Water Research Institute on Kume Island. The Kume Island facilities use regular water cooled by Deep Sea Water in a heat exchanger run through pipes in the ground to cool soil. Their techniques have developed an important resource for the island community as they now produce spinach, a winter vegetable, commercially year round. An expansion of the deep seawater agriculture facility was completed by Kumejima Town next to the OTEC <b>Demonstration</b> <b>Facility</b> in 2014. The new facility is for researching the economic practicality of chilled-soil agriculture on a larger scale.|$|E

BioAmber plans to construct a second site and may build it in Sarnia. Solutions4CO2 is developing a 4,645 square metre <b>demonstration</b> <b>facility</b> at Bluewater Energy Park. This company captures waste gas/water streams to process into value-added co-products, pharmaceutical drugs, and biofuels. PlantForm Corporation, a Canadian biotech startup company producing ultra-low-cost therapeutic antibody drugs, opened an office at the Western University Research Park in 2011. At the same Park, from the summer of 2012 to the summer of 2016, KmX Corporation operated a pilot plant to produce membranes that filter wastewater from industrial processes.

500|$|K-25 {{became a}} {{prototype}} for additional gaseous diffusion facilities {{established in the}} early post-war years. The first of these was the [...] K-27 completed in September 1945. It {{was followed by the}} [...] K-29 in 1951, the [...] K-31 in 1951 and the [...] K-33 in 1954. Additional gaseous diffusion facilities were built at Paducah, Kentucky in 1952, and Portsmouth, Ohio in 1954. The K-25 plant was renamed the Oak Ridge Gaseous Diffusion Plant in 1955. Today, uranium isotope separation is usually done by the more energy-efficient ultra centrifuge process, developed in the Soviet Union. Centrifuge cascades began operating at Oak Ridge in 1961. A gas centrifuge test facility (K-1210) opened in 1975, followed by a larger centrifuge plant <b>demonstration</b> <b>facility</b> (K-1220) in 1982. In response to an order from President Lyndon B. Johnson to cut production of enriched uranium by 25 percent, K-25 and K-27 ceased production in 1964, but in 1969 K-25 began producing uranium enriched to 3 to 5 percent for use in nuclear reactors. Martin Marietta Energy replaced Union Carbide as the operator in 1984. Gaseous diffusion finally ceased on 27 August 1985. The Oak Ridge Gaseous Diffusion Plant was renamed the Oak Ridge K-25 Site in 1989, and the East Tennessee Technology Park in 1996. Production of enriched uranium ceased in Portsmouth in 2001, and at Paducah in 2013.|$|E

50|$|Due to {{the lack}} of {{existing}} commercialized plant data, {{it is difficult to determine}} the exact method of production that will be most commonly employed.

New <b>demonstration</b> <b>facilities,</b> such as the Advanced Fuel Cycle Facility (AFCF), the Advanced Burner Reactor (ABR), and the Consolidated Fuel Treatment Center (CFTC) will use advanced nuclear and chemical process technologies that must incorporate increased proliferation resistance to enhance nuclear safeguards. The ASA- 100 Project, “Advanced Safeguards Approaches for New Nuclear Fuel Cycle Facilities,” commissioned by the NA- 243 Office of NNSA, has been tasked with reviewing and developing advanced safeguards approaches for these <b>demonstration</b> <b>facilities.</b> Because one goal of GNEP is developing and sharing proliferation-resistant nuclear technology and services with partner nations, the safeguards approaches considered are consistent with international safeguards as currently implemented by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This first report reviews possible safeguards approaches for the new fuel reprocessing processes to be deployed at the AFCF and CFTC facilities. Similar analyses addressing the ABR and transuranic (TRU) fuel fabrication lines at AFCF and CFTC will be presented in subsequent reports...|$|R
