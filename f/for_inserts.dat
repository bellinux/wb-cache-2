50|$|Most {{operating}} systems and threading libraries provide {{a variety of}} system calls that will block the process on an event, such as lock acquisition, timer changes, I/O availability or signals. Using such calls generally produces the simplest, most efficient, fair, and race-free result. A single call checks, informs the scheduler of the event it is waiting <b>for,</b> <b>inserts</b> a memory barrier where applicable, and may perform a requested I/O operation before returning. Other processes can use the CPU while the caller is blocked. The scheduler is given the information needed to implement priority inheritance or other mechanisms to avoid starvation.|$|E
50|$|When {{operating}} in fully ACID-compliant modes, InnoDB must do a flush to disk {{at least once}} per transaction, though it will combine flushes <b>for</b> <b>inserts</b> from multiple connections. For typical hard drives or arrays, this will impose a limit of about 200 update transactions per second. For applications which require higher transaction rates, disk controllers with write caching and battery backup will be {{required in order to}} maintain transactional integrity. InnoDB also offers several modes which reduce this effect, naturally leading to a loss of transactional integrity guarantees, though still retaining greater reliability than MyISAM. MyISAM has none of this overhead, but only because it does not support transactions.|$|E

However in The Mummy's Hand the mummy is a High Priest named Kharis and the details of the story are changed to describe a similar but alternate scenario. For this reason, the Kharis films are not sequels to the original, as occasionally misperceived.|$|E
50|$|Yeast {{artificial}} chromosomes (YACs) are linear DNA {{molecules containing}} the necessary features of an authentic yeast chromosome, including telomeres, a centromere, and an origin of replication. Large inserts of DNA can be ligated {{into the middle}} of the YAC so that there is an “arm” of the YAC on either side of the insert. The recombinant YAC is introduced into yeast by transformation; selectable markers present in the YAC allow for the identification of successful transformants. YACs can hold inserts up to 2000kb, but most YAC libraries contain inserts 250-400kb in size. Theoretically there is no upper limit on the size of insert a YAC can hold. It is the quality in the preparation of DNA used <b>for</b> <b>inserts</b> that determines the size limit. The most challenging aspect of using YAC is the fact they are prone to rearrangement.|$|E

5000|$|On August 28, 1875, the Kiralfy Brothers put up, “in {{spectacular}} style,” Around the World in Eighty Days at the New York Academy of Music. According to Bolossy Kiralfy, {{their goal}} {{with the production}} was to “convert American theatre audiences into enthusiasts for the French style of musical spectacle” which so inspired the brothers. Around the World in Eighty Days based on the Jules Verne novel and adapted for the stage by Michael d’Ennery, was another Parisian import. To mount the show in the United States, the brothers re-created the scenery and costumes from the Paris production as precisely as possible, and hired all {{the cast and crew}} members, except for the principal speaking roles, from the Théâtre de la Porte Saint-Martin, where the original production was performed. In terms of special effects, the brothers rented an elephant for $150 per week, brought a steam engine from Europe to run automation, and created a new stage deck for the Academy of Music to accommodate for a sinking steam ship. Audiences loved the depictions of foreign attractions such as the Suez Canal, Calcutta, and the Taj Mahal. The Kiralfys were immediately praised for their use of pastel backgrounds which please the eye but do not distract from performance. They were also some of the first American producers to utilize realistic set design. For example, their trees looked like actual trees and not theatrical renditions of trees. They convinced Jules Verne to add a bit about a hot air balloon to the already-extensive adventures of Phileas Fogg and his companions so that the Kiralfys could put a real helium balloon onstage to be operated by wires. Aside from adding special effects, few changes were made to the Paris production. They added the Around the World Waltz and a curtain for scene changes that was {{in the shape of a}} fan. The Kiralfy production was larger than the Paris production, having a cast of 35 principal actors, a ballet corps, and over 200 ensemble members. Around the World in Eighty Days opened at the Academy of Music, after a legal challenge due to another New York troupe trying to mount the same Paris production, and it was a major hit. The special effects and exciting story attracted large audiences consistently. It became so popular that the President of the United States attended a performance. President Ulysses S. Grant, who attended a performance on September 17, 1875 with Secretary George M. Robeson, General Orville E. Babcock, and former-Attorney General George Henry Williams, “seemed to be much pleased with the brilliant spectacle”. After the production closed in October at the Academy of Music, it went on tour to the outer boroughs for two weeks, until it reached the Brooklyn Academy of Music, during Christmas week in 1875. Yet, like The Deluge, this Kiralfy Brothers production did not end here. [...] The first of a long line of expansive revivals of Around the World in Eighty Days opened again at Niblo's Garden on January 22, 1877. It was presented at Niblo's Garden nine times, together with a series of very successful tours and revivals between 1881 and 1892 throughout New York City and the United States. Some of the houses for Around the World included Haverly’s Theatre in Brooklyn, the Novelty Theatre in Brooklyn, and the Grand Opera House, the Windsor Theatre, and the Amphion Academy. For the audience and the producers, much of the appeal in such frequent productions lay in the fluidity of the plot, which allowed many opportunities for additions to the story, scenery and dance. The fantastic situations Phileas Fogg and company get into on their trip around the world, allow <b>for</b> <b>inserts</b> and interpretation. Due to their success with this work, the brothers bought a property at 39 Washington Square, which they used for offices and residence until 1921.|$|E
