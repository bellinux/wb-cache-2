500|$|Charged {{with the}} theft of the vessel in October 1936, Orsborne {{maintained}} in court that the owners had instructed him {{to get rid of}} the ship, as part of a scheme to obtain its <b>insurance</b> <b>value.</b> This claim was dismissed by the court. Years later, in his memoirs, Orsborne told a different, uncorroborated story: in absconding with Girl Pat he had been carrying out a mission on behalf of British Naval Intelligence, connected with the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in July 1936.|$|E
500|$|MacLean {{testified that}} in his discussions with George Orsborne, he had formed the {{impression}} that the captain was part-owner of the vessel. Orsborne had mentioned to him the possibility of engaging in profitable activities such as gun-running and smuggling. John Moore, the managing director of Marstrand's, stated that he had expected Orsborne to take Girl Pat fishing in an area of the North Sea where another Marstrand vessel was fishing successfully. When Moore was cross-examined, the defence's [...] "serious allegations" [...] were revealed. It was put to Moore that he had instructed George Orsborne not to go fishing, but {{to get rid of the}} vessel so that the company could claim its <b>insurance</b> <b>value,</b> of which Orsborne would be rewarded with a share. The defence alleged that the company was in poor financial shape, and that its ships were heavily mortgaged. Moore denied that he had made any such suggestion to Orsborne. The company, he insisted, was financially sound, the mortgages on its vessels were relatively low, and he had never discussed insured values with Orsborne. The defence further alleged that when taken out Girl Pat had been in an unseaworthy condition, inadequately provisioned and unfit for a normal fishing voyage. This suggestion was also denied by Moore.|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{consequences of}} some important assumptions ofthe perpetual inventory method of capital stock calculation under geometric depreciation. The data are plant-level panel {{data from the}} Norwegian manufacturing statistics, containing independent measures of capital stocks and gross investment flows for two capital types and three industries. First, we look at consequences of choosing different depreciation rates a priori, when we use as benchmark for {{the level of the}} capital stocks deflated fire <b>insurance</b> <b>values</b> in a specific year. The choice of depreciation rate is of substantial importance, some values resulting in decreasing, other in increasing capital stocks over time. Second, we attempt to estimate depreciation rates by combining time series on gross investment and fire <b>insurance</b> <b>values</b> for the same period. In our regression models, both systematic and random measurement errors in the fire <b>insurance</b> <b>values</b> and various forms of heterogeneity in the coefficient structure are represented. We conclude that the estimated depreciation rates vary significantly with the specification of the measurement error process and that heterogeneity in this process across plants is important.

50|$|The {{principle}} of insurable interest on life insurance {{is that a}} person or organization can obtain an insurance policy {{on the life of}} another person if the person or organization obtaining the <b>insurance</b> <b>values</b> the life of the insured more than the amount of the policy. In this way, insurance can compensate for loss. A company may have an insurable interest in a President/CEO or other employee with special knowledge and skills. A creditor has an insurable interest {{in the life of a}} debtor, up to the amount of the loan. A person who is financially dependent on a second person has an insurable interest in the life of that second person.|$|R

50|$|The idea {{dates back}} to at least a 1984 article by P.

A 2006 study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology appears to have corroborated this latter view.|$|E

Artists and institutions which had sent works to the museum on permanent loan asked for them to be returned - requests were received for the return of 86 of the 104 works in the collection. Cicelyn estimated the transport costs at €100,000, and the <b>insurance</b> <b>value</b> of the works at more than €5000 million.|$|E

Chinese investors are entitled to recover their investment losses from auditors owing to audit failure. However, civil lawsuits against auditors have not succeeded in the past. Therefore, Chinese auditors do not face the real threat of shareholder litigation. They only have the threat of costly governmental penalties for violating the regulations. Even so, we demonstrate that Chinese audit still contains both assurance and <b>insurance</b> <b>values.</b> Also, the entire market reacted to the scandal. Moreover, we show that investors differentiate audit quality in stock valuation. Finally, companies audited by international auditors suffered less value losses.
