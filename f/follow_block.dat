50|$|NASCAR 06 {{follows the}} series' recent {{tradition}} of being subtitled {{with the major}} new feature of that edition. Total Team Control derives from the new teammate features: one can switch control from their driver to another car on their team during a race, and can command the teammate to <b>follow,</b> <b>block</b> for or work with the player. It also implements Logitech USB audio technology, allowing the player to order their crew chief with a headset or microphone. The rest of the game retains the modes and features brought into the series by NASCAR 2005: Chase for the Cup, making NASCAR 06 very similar to its predecessor. The game begins with the Pepsi 400, where Jimmie Johnson gets wrecked after bumping Hendrick Motorsports teammate Jeff Gordon ahead of Dale Earnhardt Jr. and the player must take control of Gordon and win the race.|$|E

40|$|The {{cationic}} tear proteins lactoferrin and lysozyme exhibit co-operative antistaphylococcal properties. The {{purpose of}} this study was to determine the mechanism of action of this co-operation on Staphylococcus epidermidis. <b>Following</b> <b>blocking</b> of lipoteichoic acid (LTA) binding sites, the effects on binding of lactoferrin and susceptibility to lactoferrin and lysozyme were determined. The effect of lactoferrin on autolysis and LTA release was also examined. Maximal susceptibility occurred on addition of lactoferrin first <b>followed</b> by lysozyme. <b>Blocking</b> the LTA binding sites both reduced lactoferrin binding and decreased susceptibility. Autolytic activity decreased and LTA release increased in the presence of lactoferrin. These results suggest that binding of lactoferrin to LTA is important in its synergy with lysozyme and interferes with the autolysins present on the LTA. It is proposed that, on binding to the anionic LTA of S. epidermidis, the cationic protein lactoferrin decreases the negative charge, allowing greater accessibility of lysozyme to the underlying peptidoglycan...|$|R

30|$|There is accumulating {{evidence}} that cysteine sulfenation (cys-SOH) in proteins {{plays an important}} role in cellular response to oxidative stress. The purpose of the present study was to identify mitochondrial proteins that undergo changes in cys-SOH during aging. Studies were conducted in rats when they were 5 or 30  months of age. <b>Following</b> <b>blocking</b> of free protein thiols with N-ethylmaleimide, protein sulfenic acids were reduced by arsenite to free thiol groups that were subsequently labeled with biotin-maleimide. Samples were then comparatively analyzed by two-dimensional Western blots, and proteins showing changes in sulfenation were selectively identified by mass spectrometry peptide sequencing. As a result, five proteins were identified. Proteins showing an age-related decrease in sulfenation include pyruvate carboxylase and pyruvate dehydrogenase; while those showing an age-related increase in sulfenation include aconitase, mitofilin, and tubulin (α- 1). Results of the present study provide a general picture of mitochondrial protein sulfenation in brain oxidative stress and implicate the involvement of protein sulfenation in overall decline of mitochondrial function during brain aging.|$|R
