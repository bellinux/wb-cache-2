5000|$|TCP <b>Gender</b> <b>Changer</b> is {{a method}} in {{computer}} networking for making an internal TCP/IP based network server accessible beyond its protective firewall.|$|E
50|$|In {{the absence}} of genderless connectors, <b>gender</b> <b>changer</b> {{fittings}} {{might be used to}} enable certain connections. The designer of a connection system may use one or both schemes to allow arbitrary connectivity, or even combine both schemes into a single system.|$|E
50|$|If a given cable {{will not}} allow a data connection, {{especially}} if a <b>gender</b> <b>changer</b> is in use, a null modem cable may be necessary. Gender changers and null modem cables are {{not mentioned in the}} standard, so there is no officially sanctioned design for them.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gender</b> <b>changers</b> {{are used}} in {{professional}} audio to adapt XLR connectors, RCA connectors, Speakon connectors and TRS phone connectors.|$|R

5000|$|When an {{enforced}} {{sense of}} unidirectionality or [...] "one-way flow" [...] {{is required for}} safety or other reasons (for example, AC electrical power connections), a strict assignment of connector genders is implemented to prevent undesired configurations, and <b>gender</b> <b>changers</b> are banned.|$|R
5000|$|The {{null modem}} is a {{computer}} communications adapter which {{may appear to be}} a <b>gender</b> <b>changer,</b> but it reroutes the wiring. The [...] "transmit" [...] pair from each side is routed into the [...] "receive" [...] pair of the other side, {{in the manner of a}} crossover cable.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>gender</b> <b>changer</b> or [...] "gender-bender", is a {{hardware}} device placed between two cable connectors {{of the same}} type and gender.An example is a cable connector shell with either two female or two male connectors on it (male-to-male or female-to-female), used to correct the mismatches that result when interconnecting two devices or cables with the same gender of connector.|$|E
5000|$|Devices {{used for}} mating two {{connectors}} {{of the same}} gender have {{a wide variety of}} terms, including for example: [...] "gender changer", [...] "gender mender", [...] "gender bender", [...] "gender blender", [...] "sex changer", and [...] "homosexual adapter". A specific <b>gender</b> <b>changer</b> can be referred to by either the gender of its connectors, or the gender which it is designed to connect to, resulting in a thoroughly ambiguous terminology. Thus a [...] "male gender changer" [...] might have female connectors to mate two male ends, or male connectors to mate two female ends.|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} of consumer-level AC power, {{connector}} gender is used to implicitly enforce safe use of power connectors. Because of this consideration, it is illegal under electrical code to make or use any <b>gender</b> <b>changers</b> to connect AC line power to consumer-level equipment.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Gender</b> <b>changers</b> {{are used}} for RS-232C ports in either the {{original}} DB-25 or the IBM AT DE-9 format. They are also used when extending any sort of cable that normally has plugs on both ends (rather than a socket on one and plug on the other), however {{in this case it}} is usually called just an [...] "extender", such as with F connectors, BNC connectors, and various RJ connectors used in telephony and computer networking.|$|R
5000|$|Sheet metal {{ductwork}} for conveying air in HVAC systems typically uses gendered connections. Typically, the airflow {{through a}} ductwork connection is from male to female. However, since one-way flow is implemented by forced-air fans or blowers, [...] "backwards" [...] gendered connections {{can be seen}} frequently in some systems, since all connections are typically sealed with duct sealing mastic or tape to prevent leakage anyway. The flow convention is usually loosely adhered to for simplicity of design, and {{to reduce the number}} of <b>gender</b> <b>changer</b> fittings required, but exceptions are made whenever expedient.|$|E
