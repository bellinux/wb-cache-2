25|$|The Corps {{estimated}} the New Orleans area {{was more than}} 80 percent unwatered. Corps officials {{estimated the}} overall unwatering effort, given normal seasonal rainfall, would be completed no later than early October, 2005. Tropical Storm Rita was being closely watched at this point.

25|$|In 1981, the MTA {{proposed}} {{abandoning the}} severely deteriorated line under the failed Program for Action. At the time, only 10,000 passengers used the line per day. It was proposed that bus service along nearby Franklin Avenue could {{substitute for the}} line. During the winter, the line would often be closed because there was fear that trains would derail. Stations were in horrible condition; portions of the wooden platforms were sealed off because they had burned or collapsed. In January 1982, the line needed to close for <b>emergency</b> <b>repair</b> work because a retaining wall along the line {{was in danger of}} collapse.|$|E
25|$|He also {{insisted on}} always {{wearing the same}} {{battered}} old flowerpot sunhat during his time out in the field, a constant companion from his debut in 1981 to his last game in 2004. Russell lined up the ball with the specially cut back rim, but it ended up rather worn out. Only his wife Aileen was allowed to repair it, while Russell carried an <b>emergency</b> <b>repair</b> kit of cotton thread and rubber. Its state of age and hence apparent disrepair caused more than one argument with the authorities. Russell refused to wear the official coloured one-day sunhat in South Africa, with a compromise only reached when Russell agreed to wear his old flowerpot hat inside the new sun hat. On a second occasion in the West Indies, he agreed to wash it, and placed it to dry in an oven. Forgotten and resultantly overbaked, the hat caught fire, and was only just rescued from total incineration – the top collapsed like puff pastry on removal. The fire damage could still {{be seen on the}} hat years later.|$|E

During {{the night of}} August 10, 1994, two pins {{supporting}} an expansion joint failed and caused a section on the Illinois end of the bridge to sink nearly 4 inches, causing 3 of the 4 lanes to close for <b>emergency</b> <b>repairs.</b> [...] For the remainder of that month, various lanes would close due to <b>emergency</b> <b>repairs</b> and inspections and news regarding the <b>emergency</b> <b>repairs</b> frequently made headlines in the Alton Telegraph.|$|R

500|$|Danny Daniels choreographed {{the opening}} music number [...] "Anything Goes". Capshaw learned {{to sing in}} Mandarin and took tap dance lessons. However the dress was fitted so tightly that Capshaw {{was not able to}} dance in it. Made by Barbara Matera out of {{original}} 1920s and 1930s beads, the dress was one of a kind. The opening dance number was actually the last scene to be shot, but the dress did feature in some earlier location shots in Sri Lanka, drying on a nearby tree. Unfortunately an elephant had started to eat it, tearing the whole back of the dress. Consequently, some <b>emergency</b> <b>repair</b> work had to be done by Matera with what remained of the original beads, and it was costume designer Anthony Powell who had to fill in the insurance forms. As to the reason for damage, he had no option but to put [...] "dress eaten by elephant".|$|E

2500|$|Separately in May 2005 the Canadian company MagEnergy {{signed an}} {{agreement}} with SNEL to rehabilitate some of Inga II’s turbines, with a completion goal of 2009. [...] Actual work to rehabilitate Inga II finally began April 27, 2006, just under a year after the initial agreement with MagEnergy was signed. [...] This first phase, which involved fixing a single 168 MW turbine and other <b>emergency</b> <b>repair</b> work, was reported 90% complete in April 2009, and the second phase (four other turbines) was estimated to take five additional years. [...] However, there is doubt over whether the government accepts the validity of the contract, and in the meantime the Canadian company First Quantum was hired to rehabilitate two separate Inga II turbines. [...] To carry out the repairs, the SNEL has received funding from the Regional and Domestic Power Markets Development Project, which is itself supported by the World Bank, African Development Bank, and European Investment Bank.|$|E

2500|$|As {{complaints}} about the city subway's delays and disrepair reached a fever pitch in summer 2017 under state governor Andrew Cuomo, he drafted a congestion pricing proposal with lessons from Bloomberg's handling of the State Legislature. Despite having earlier doubted such a plan's viability, Cuomo described congestion pricing as [...] "an {{idea whose time has}} come". London and Stockholm had implemented the concept successfully. Cuomo's plan is expected to differ significantly from Bloomberg's proposal. Its primary intent is to raise funds for city transit and reduce street gridlock, while balancing suburban commuter considerations. The New York Times reflected that Bloomberg's 2008 proposal, which would have raised $500 million annually, could have rectified infrastructure issues and <b>emergency</b> <b>repair</b> schedule affecting the subway in 2017. The plan could be implemented through open road tolling, which records E-ZPass transponders and license plates without forcing the vehicles to slow down significantly, thus increasing vehicle throughput. This would coincide with MTA Bridges and Tunnels' ongoing project to convert all of its crossings from a tollbooth-based system to an open road tolling system. This was in contrast to the circumstances during Bloomberg's tenure, when open road tolling was not widely used yet. As with the Bloomberg proposal, Queens politicians still opposed Cuomo's proposal because it would potentially add tolls to the remaining free crossings over the East River.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the death}} of Charles XII in 1718, and the defeat in the Great Northern War (1700–1721) the Swedish capital was a city in despair, {{preparing}} for a Russian attack and encamped by impoverished, refugees, and idle soldiers. [...] The southern lock {{of the city was}} approaching a century in age, a bottleneck in a state of decay, inadequate for both the larger shipping vessels of the era and the increasing traffic load. [...] While Göran Josuæ Adelcrantz (1668–1739), the pupil and successor of Tessin the Younger, was mostly occupied by the construction works of the new Royal Palace, in 1622 he accomplished an <b>emergency</b> <b>repair</b> of the old lock; workers wading between the temporary embankments filling cracks with clay, straw, and muck, while loose and missing planks were put back in place. These measure not only ended much more expensive than intended but also proved completely insufficient, and as the decay had obviously made the old lock impossible to repair properly, Christopher Polhem (1661–1751), [...] "the father of Swedish mechanics", was consulted for a new construction. The proposal of Adelcrantz for a new construction, estimated to cost 32,741 riksdaler in silver coins, was passed over by a suggested repair of the old lock by Johan Eberhard Carlberg (1683–1773) in 1726, limited in cost to 30,000 rikdaler while implying widening the canal from 6,5 to 8,2 meters, a proposal to the taste of the city's building board which subsequently had Adelcrantz replaced by Carlberg. [...] The latter, however, was a daring man and he quickly produced a proposal for a new lock south of the old, a proposal which implied not only the demolition of the city's brewery, but also the discontinuation of the bar iron deposit next to the lock (the biggest in Europe, representing about 40% of the global market at the time). By 1728, however, the city had accepted the need for a new construction, and, as Carlberg was busy with other undertakings, finally assigned Polhem for the project in 1729. [...] The proposal for a wooden construction he produced the following year didn't please the board which had anticipated a more lasting construction in stone, and as the whole affair failed to conclude, a contract wasn't signed until 1744. [...] At the age of 93 years, only days before his death, Polhem was reward the knighthood of the Royal Order of the Polar Star, {{at the bottom of the}} lock. [...] Finally inaugurated on May 2, 1755, Polhems sluss ("Lock of Polhem"), was 3,9 meters deep, 12,5 meters wide, and 59 meters long; in the western end overpassed by a drawbridge flanked by two brick towers on either side and therefore called Röda Slussen ("The Red Lock"). [...] With the new lock the surrounding area changed considerably in character; on the square south of the lock a triangular block was built, named Strykjärnet ("The [...] Iron"); several old wooden buildings were replaced by new in stone; and an eastern bridge was added over the canal named Blå Slussen ("The Blue Lock") after the blue hoisting device.|$|E
