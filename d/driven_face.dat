50|$|With modern chains it {{is unusual}} for a chain (other {{than that of a}} bicycle) to wear until it breaks, since a worn chain leads to the rapid onset of wear on the teeth of the sprockets, with {{ultimate}} failure being the loss of all the teeth on the sprocket. The sprockets (in particular the larger of the two) suffer a grinding motion that puts a characteristic hook shape into the <b>driven</b> <b>face</b> of the teeth. (This effect is made worse by a chain improperly tensioned, but is unavoidable no matter what care is taken). The worn teeth (and chain) no longer provides smooth transmission of power and this may become evident from the noise, the vibration or (in car engines using a timing chain) the variation in ignition timing seen with a timing light. Both sprockets and chain should be replaced in these cases, since a new chain on worn sprockets will not last long. However, in less severe cases {{it may be possible to}} save the smaller of the two sprockets, since it is always the larger one that suffers the most wear. Only in very light-weight applications such as a bicycle, or in extreme cases of improper tension, will the chain normally jump off the sprockets.|$|E

Auditory-visual speech recognition is more accurate than auditory only or visual only speech recognition [1][10]. Research shows that a synthetic talking face can help people understand the associated speech in noisy environments [16]. It also helps people react more positively in interactive services [20]. In some situations, reliable high bandwidth communication channel can hardly be guaranteed. Real-time speech driven avatar, which requires only very low bit rate channel to transmit information, provides an effective solution.

Based on this framework, we learn the correlation between neutral facial deformation and expressive facial deformation with Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). A hierar-chical structure is proposed to map the acoustic parameters to lip FAPs. Then the synthesized neutral FAP streams will be extended with expressive variations according to the prosody of the input speech. The quantitative evaluation of the experimental result is encouraging and the synthesized face shows a realistic quality. ...|$|E

We {{start with a}} review of previous work on face modeling, face animation, and facial motion analysis, and discuss the connections among them. This leads us to the integrated framework.

It provides a guideline for building a complete face modeling and animation system. Based on the framework, we improved our face modeling and animation system, called the iFACE system [6].

Only Automatic Speech Recognition system (ASR) {{does not give}} good results in noisy environment. Audio Visual Speech Recognition system plays vital role in such harsh environment as it uses both – audio and visual – information. In this paper, we have proposed a novel approach with enhanced performance over traditional methods that have been reported so far. Our algorithm works on the bases of acoustic and visual parameters to achieve better results. We have tested our system for English language using MFCC and LPC parameters of the speech. Lip parameters like lip width, lip height etc are extracted from the video and these both acoustic and visual parameters are used to train neural network.

40|$|One {{problem of}} {{existing}} appearance-based face recognition methods (e. g. PCA, LDA) is their weak ability {{of coping with}} local variations caused by fa-cial expressions, motion deformation, data missing, etc. Multi-subregion fusion methods, which divide the face into a set of subregions, aim at this issue, and were re-ported a better performance. However, it leaves two open questions: 1. what subregions are good partitions on the face, and 2. How to fuse these subregions could achieve the expected performance. In this paper, we ad-dress these two questions and propose a local discrimi-nation <b>driven</b> <b>face</b> partition method based on a coarse-to-fine Quad-tree decomposition. Unlike other multi-subregion approaches relying on prior knowledge, our method partitions the face {{according to the data}} prop-erty. Thus, it can adapt to varied databases. Mean-while, our method introduces an optimized solution that fuses selected subregions to reach higher recognition accuracy. The cross-database experiments including one 3 D database and three 2 D databases demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method. 1...|$|E
40|$|Finally, a {{performance}} <b>driven</b> <b>face</b> animation system is introduced. The proposed system {{consists of two}} key components: a robust non-rigid 3 D tracking module and a MPEG 4 compliant facial animation module. Firstly, the facial motion is tracked from source videos which contain both the rigid 3 D head motion (6 DOF) and the non-rigid expression variation. Afterward, the tracked facial motion is parameterized via estimating a set of MPEG 4 facial animation parameters (FAP) and applied to drive the animation of the target avatar. In {{the first part of}} the thesis, the problem of tracking a non-rigid 3 D face is studied. A novel framework for non-rigid 3 D face tracking is proposed for applications in live scenarios. In order to extract more information of feature correspondences, the proposed framework integrates three types of features which discriminate face deformation across different views. The integration of these complementary features is important for robust estimation of the 3 D parameters. In order to estimate the high dimensional 3 D deformation parameters, we develop a hierarchical parameter estimation algorithm to robustly estimate both rigid and non-rigid 3 D parameters. We show the importance of both features fusion and hierarchical parameter estimation for reliable tracking 3 D face deformation. Experiments demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of the proposed algorithm especially in the cases of agile head motion, drastic illumination change, and large pose change up to profile view. The video based face recognition is studied in the second part of the thesis. Compared to the still image based recognition methods, the video based methods share the merits of spatial temporal coherence among image sequences and overcomplete training samples. We propose a framework for the task of face recognition in real-world noisy videos based on 3 D deformable face tracking, which can directly estimate face pose for a view-based face recognition scheme. Meanwhile, the precise non-rigid tracking provides well-aligned face samples for the subsequent recognizer. At the recognition stage, three types of feature descriptors, including Regularized LDA, LE and sparse representation, are exploited. Extensive experiments conducted on the real world videos demonstrate that the proposed recognition framework can achieve the state-of-the art recognition results, even with the usage of a simple classifier. Three dimensional face tracking is a crucial task for many applications in computer vision. Problem like face recognition, facial expression analysis and animation, are more likely to be solved by if the geometry and appearance properties are available through a 3 D face tracker.

40|$|This is an Author's Accepted Manuscript of {{an article}} {{published}} in the International Journal of Computer Integrated Manufacturing, available online at: [URL] present two methods for process planning of 2. 5 D machined parts. The first method is based on feature recognition from a 3 D model. We embedded the shape and the machining method of two generic classes of machining features in a set of OPS 5 rules to form a machining feature recognizer. When successfully recognizing a machining feature, machining instructions, in terms of the tool entrance <b>face,</b> <b>drive</b> <b>face</b> and part face, for cutting the machining feature will be generated and further processed to produce NC codes. The second method is based on learning the shape and the machining method of the machining feature. When a machining feature cannot be recognized by the former feature recognizer, the user can use the machining feature as a positive training example to instruct the system about the tool entrance <b>face,</b> <b>drive</b> <b>face</b> and part face of the machining feature. The system then builds a new rule, using the boundary shape of the unrecognized machining feature as the rule's matching condition and the acquired machining instruction as the rule's action. The new rule can be used subsequently for process planning of machining features that have shapes similar to the memorized one...|$|R
