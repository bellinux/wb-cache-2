500|$|Reflecting on the band's hiatus in a 2011 interview, Kinney {{told that}} Staley wasn't {{the only one}} battling addiction. [...] "He was the focal point, like singers are. So they’d single him out. But the truth was, {{it was pretty much}} everybody. I {{definitely}} had my hand firmly on the wheel going off the cliff. And the reason we pulled back – you know when you stop when you have two #1 records, it’s not really the greatest career move – but we did that because we love each other and we didn’t want to die in public. And I know for a fact <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> <b>that</b> if we were to continue that I wouldn’t be on the phone right now talking to you. I wouldn’t have made it. I just wouldn’t have." ...|$|E

500|$|Agnes and {{her sister}} were virgins of Rome {{in the time of}} the Emperor Constantine, though all figures are shown in {{contemporary}} 14th-century dress. The story begins {{on the inside of the}} bowl, which has a round medallion showing St Agnes kneeling before a bearded figure, representing her teacher, wearing a chaperon. She holds a book inscribed Miserere mei Deus sancte ("Have pity on me, Holy God"), while a banderole says In corde meo abscondi eloquia tua ut non peccem tibi ("Thy words have I hid <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> <b>that</b> I might not sin against thee". [...] ). [...] The top of the cover continues the story up to Agnes' martyrdom in five scenes, shown with a continuous groundline from which small rocks rise up to demarcate the scenes; on the base trees perform this function. Sunrays radiate from the centre of the cover above all the scenes; the red enamel which once filled these is nearly all lost.|$|E

2500|$|Regarding {{agreeing to}} play at Live 8, he said: [...] "There {{was more than one}} reason, firstly to support the cause. The second one is the energy-consuming and uncomfortable {{relationship}} between Roger and me that I was carrying along <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>heart.</b> <b>That</b> is why we wanted to perform and to leave the trash behind. Thirdly, I might have regretted it if I declined." [...] On 20 February 2006, Gilmour commented again on Pink Floyd's future when he was interviewed by Billboard.com, stating, [...] "Who knows? I have no plans at all to do that. My plans are to do my concerts and put my solo record out." ...|$|E

2500|$|Concurrently, Weizmann devoted {{himself to}} the {{establishment}} of a scientific institute for basic research in the vicinity of his sprawling estate, in the town of Rehovot. Weizmann saw great promise in science as a means to bring peace and prosperity to the area. As stated in his own words : [...] "I trust and feel sure <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> <b>that</b> science will bring to this land both peace and a renewal of its youth, creating here the springs of a new spiritual and material life. [...] I speak of both science for its own sake and science as a means to an end." [...] His efforts led in 1934 {{to the creation of the}} Daniel Sieff Research Institute, which was financially supported by an endowment by Israel Sieff in memory of his late son. Weizmann actively conducted research in the laboratories of this institute, primarily in the field of organic chemistry. [...] He offered the post of director of the institute to Nobel Prize laureate Fritz Haber, but took over the directorship himself after Haber's death en route to Palestine.|$|E
2500|$|In an October 15, 2008 {{interview}} with Us Weekly, Richard gave further insight into O'Day's dismissal from Danity Kane. [...] " [...] {{did not like}} [...] image...where her image was going for the group," [...] she said. [...] "It wasn't a personal thing." [...] Richard explained that O'Day's increasingly [...] "sexy look" [...] was alienating young fans. Referring specifically to O'Day's topless pictures for Complex magazine just a month before, Richard stated, [...] "We had just did a signing with Dollhouse Teen, which is for 13, 14-year-old young girls... So we can't do that one day {{and then the next}} day do an obnoxious cover.... wants the fans, and he says he can't do that if we can continue to go in the direction that we were going." [...] Richard further relayed, [...] " [...] told me specifically that [...] is no longer in Danity Kane and Danity Kane will move forward without her." [...] When asked if Combs would seek [...] "replacements" [...] for O'Day and Woods, Richard stated, [...] "He has not said anything per that. But I think <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> <b>that</b> he is gonna do another show." ...|$|E
2500|$|The character's arrival was {{announced}} by the press in November 1998. She was one of Executive Producer Matthew Robinson's introductions, and {{was described as a}} [...] "home-wrecking blonde". According to actress Lucy Benjamin who played Lisa, the scriptwriters had doubts about casting her in the role: [...] "I just knew <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> <b>that</b> I'd {{be able to do it}} well. And I desperately wanted the security of a regular income. But after the audition they kept me hanging on for such a long time. They tortured me by saying yes then saying no. It's the only job I've ever cried about when I thought I didn't have it." [...] Benjamin said that she was overjoyed when she was eventually given the part. In 2010, Matthew Robinson discussed Lisa's introduction with Walford Web, suggesting that Lisa and several other new characters introduced were an attempt to fill in character gaps in the soap resulting from a large number of axings. Lisa was conceptualised as a [...] "totty" [...] contingent. He indicated that the casting of Benjamin had been awkward as BBC controller of drama, Mal Young, was hesitant about her hiring. He eventually relented and, according to Robinson, admitted after seeing her in the role that [...] "she was, after all, a great asset to the show".|$|E
