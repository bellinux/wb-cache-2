5|$|The {{disastrous}} {{effects of}} the Smoot–Hawley tariff proved difficult for Herbert Hoover's 1932 re-election campaign. Franklin D. Roosevelt became the 32nd U.S. president and the Democratic Party worked to reverse trade protectionism in favor of trade liberalization. As an alternative to cutting tariffs across all imports, Democrats advocated for trade reciprocity. The U.S. Congress passed the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act in 1934, aimed at restoring global trade and reducing unemployment. The legislation expressly authorized President Roosevelt to negotiate bilateral trade agreements and reduce tariffs considerably. If a country agreed to cut tariffs on certain commodities, the U.S. would institute corresponding cuts to promote trade between the two nations. Between 1934 and 1947, the U.S. negotiated 29 such agreements and the average tariff rate decreased by approximately one third during this same period. The legislation contained an important most-favored-nation clause, through which tariffs were equalized to all countries, such that trade agreements would not result in preferential or discriminatory tariff rates with certain countries on any particular import, due to the difficulties and inefficiencies associated with <b>differential</b> <b>tariff</b> rates. The clause effectively generalized tariff reductions from bilateral trade agreements, ultimately reducing worldwide tariff rates.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- Open {{access is}} an {{essential}} feature in the deregulated power system. It permits all the generators to transmit power into the system. Depending upon the transmission network parameters, generator responses to the variation in loads differ from each other. To know these responses is important from various aspects such as for determination of nodal prices which will be needed in charging <b>differential</b> <b>tariffs</b> and also in congestion management. By considering the load flow changes due to change in load at a bus, electricity tracing is applied to compute the generator participation factors.

40|$|We {{evaluate}} empirically {{the impact}} of the dramatic 1991 trade liberalization in India on the industry wage structure. The empirical strategy uses variation in industry wage premiums and trade policy across industries and over time. In contrast to earlier studies on developing countries, we find a strong, negative, and robust relationship between changes in trade policy and changes in industry wage premiums over time. The results are consistent with liberalization-induced productivity increases at the firm level, which get passed on to industry wages. Since tariff reductions were proportionately larger in sectors that employ a larger share of unskilled workers, the increase in wage premiums in these sectors implies that unskilled workers experienced an increase in their relative incomes. Thus, our findings suggest that trade liberalization has led to decreased wage inequality in India.

40|$|Thesis (MDF) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2014. The recent {{transformation}} in the Ugandan energy sector {{has led to a}} significant surge in private electricity generation companies in the country. These companies have a heterogeneous capital structure and they tend to charge different tariff rates for the electricity generated. While the capital structure might have an important role to play in <b>differential</b> <b>tariff</b> setting, it is not clear to what extent it influences the tariff structure of electricity generation projects. Thus, the objective {{of this study was to}} examine the effect of capital structure on the tariff of electricity generation projects in Uganda after controlling for other factors such as operation and maintenance costs, technology used for generation, project development costs, and installed capacity of generation plants on the generation tariffs. Using cross-sectional data from 29 companies as at September 2014, a bootstrap linear regression analysis was used for estimation. The results of the study indicated that the higher the debt portion in the capital structure, the lower the generation tariff. However, the impact of debt in the capital structure was not statistically significant. What stood out is that renewable technologies have a much lower generating tariff than non-renewable technologies...|$|E

The South African government took a position to install electronic tolling collection systems in urban centres to address some of the issues. This study uses the extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT 2) to investigate factors that influence the adoption of electronic tolling tags, a critical component of the entire system. Opinions were gathered through online surveys from South African drivers. Results of the quantitative structured equation model reveal that social influence, effort expectancy, price value, performance expectancy and hedonic motivation are the key factors that influence adoption.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{engineering}} economics of interventions to reduce consumer inconvenience due to unreliable electricity supply in rural India. The work introduces and applies {{a novel approach}} to estimate interruption costs as loss in consumer surplus due to restricted consumption of electricity services. Chapter 2 reports an assessment that compares grid extension with distributed generation (DG) alternatives, based on the subsidies they will necessitate, and costs of service interruptions that are appropriate in the rural Indian context. Despite the inclusion of interruption costs, standalone DG {{does not appear to}} be competitive with grid extension at distances of less than 17 km. However, backing up unreliable grid service with local DG plants is attractive when reliability is very poor, even in previously electrified villages. Introduction of energy efficient lighting changes these economics, and the threshold for acceptable grid unreliability significantly reduces. Chapter 3 analyzes supply rostering (alternatively, “load shedding”) in metropolitan, small town and rural feeders in and around Bangalore city. The inequity in load shedding is analyzed through transfers due to <b>differential</b> <b>tariffs</b> between the urban and rural residential consumers, and the relief provided to BESCOM, through avoided procurement of additional supply from generators, because rural and small town feeders are load shed higher than Bangalore city. The values of the load shedding transfers are estimated to be in the range of Rs. 120 - 380 /consumer-year from the rural consumers, and Rs. 220 - 370 /consumer-year from the small town consumers. The metropolitan consumers are found to be net beneficiaries. The viability of using smart meters to provide current limited but uninterrupted supply is investigated as one alternative to outright blackouts. Chapter 4 develops a broader theoretical framework that can be used to model consumer demand for electricity services with unreliable supply and adaptation. Demand for energy ‘services’ is modeled by incorporating time of use, duration and deferability. Supply reliability is disaggregated into its constituent dimensions– mean and variance of supply availability in times of high demand, and supply predictability, and their respective impacts on consumer welfare are discussed. Primary data collected from Karnataka inform the discussion, especially with backup adoption. New consumer-oriented reliability indices are proposed...|$|R
40|$|Demand for {{electrical}} power is increasing everyday. Along {{with the increase}} in power demand, the characteristics of the loads are also changing. From being high power consuming, simple, robust loads, today loads are more efficient, {{but at the same time}} more sensitive. The performance and life of these highly sensitive loads depend a lot on the quality of power supplied to them. Power quality is any deviation of the voltage or current waveform from its normal sinusoidal waveshape. These disturbances include, but are not limited to, sag, undervoltage, interruption, swell, overvoltage, transients, harmonics, voltage flicker and any other distortions to the sinusoidal waveform. Occurrence of one or more of such disturbances is called a power quality event. Automatic classification of these disturbances is important for quick determination of the causes and to characterize possible impacts of the disturbances. Modern microprocessor based protective relays have numerous integrated functions that allow them to provide information on power quality events. It is proposed to utilize the existing numerical relays to analyze the quality of power at any point in the power system. The numerical relays can be programmed to capture the oscillographic waveform or any disturbance on the analogue signal or change of state of the digital signals and store it in the form of Common Format For Transient Data Exchange (COMTRADE) format. These records are then transferred to a central monitoring workstation for off-line analysis. This thesis describes a technique to automate the classification and analysis of the power quality events using relay recorded data. The technique uses voltage duration and magnitude (as specified in the IEEE Std. 1159 - 1995, IEEE Recommended Practice for Monitoring Electric Power Quality) of three phases to detect and classify the events. The classified results are then presented in a user-friendly graphical form. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is used to estimate the fundamental frequency and harmonic components in power systems. The graphical user interface of the power quality analysis tool is developed using Microsoft Visual C++ IDE and the algorithms are programmed in C++. The proposed technique was tested using data obtained by simulating different power system disturbances as well as on the data recorded by relays. The algorithms were able to classify the power quality events accurately. In the future, this facility will: enhance the real time monitoring of power quality and provide statistical analysis of available power quality data. From the utility viewpoint, it would allow them to monitor power quality in a cost effective manner and assist in preventive and predictive maintenance besides helping them to fix <b>differential</b> <b>tariff</b> based on the quality of the delivered power. It may also turn out to be a smart tool for them to penalize the consumer polluting the power quality...|$|E
40|$|Protection {{policy was}} {{established}} in 1877 after the fiasco of the 20 year period of progressive liberalisation policy, forwarded by the then Minister of the Treasury Michał Rejtern. In 1877, when deciding on customs, Russian Treasury used fiscalism, but {{the success of this}} particular solution caused a shift to protective and prohibitive policy. Russians wanted an independence from import, at the same time developing production, output of resources and agriculture used for the industry in the Russian Empire. After the change of the economical doctrine in 1877, the Kingdom of Poland’s market became attractive to the foreign capital investments. The investments, however, took place only in those sectors of economy which were included in the Russian government’s protective policy. The instruments of protective policy, such as customs and <b>differential</b> <b>tariffs</b> caused an increase of investments in many branches, contributing to theirs development. The development in the chemical industry, heavy industry and even in some of the branches of agriculture was especially dynamic. The protective policy was more favourable to the heavy industry in southern Russia than to the great ironworks in Kingdom of Poland. This, however, was related to the fact that iron ore layers in Krivoy Rog were common and had significant quantity of iron while layers in Częstochowskie were too small to suffice even for the needs of the ironworks of Sosnowiec – Częstochowa industrial district, whereas Świetokrzyskie layers had too low content of iron and contained many impurities. Additionally, Russia did not develop heavy industry in the Ural Basin, either. Without the protective policy, however, the rapid development of the heavy industry branches (metallurgy, mining and metal machine industry) would have been impossible in the Kingdom of Poland. The extension of protective policy into the cotton industry resulted in imposing of high tariffs on cotton from the southern states of USA and Egypt. The enterprises from Kingdom of Poland were forced to buy cotton from central Asia and Transcaucasus. It increased the costs of textile industry; the export to the peripheral markets of Russian Empire, however, {{would not have been possible}} in that scale without the tariffs and the development of the textile branch in Kingdom of Poland might not have been as significant as it was.
