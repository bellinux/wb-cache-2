Receipts are considered credit transactions while payments are considered debit transactions. The {{balance of payments}} {{is a function of}} three components: transactions involving export or import of goods and services form the current account, transactions involving purchase or sale of financial assets form the financial account, and transactions involving unconventional transfers of wealth form the capital account. The current account summarizes three variables: the trade balance, net <b>factor</b> <b>income</b> from abroad, and net unilateral transfers. The financial account summarizes the value of exports versus imports of assets, and the capital account summarizes the value of asset transfers received net of transfers given. The capital account also includes the official reserve account, which summarizes central banks' purchases and sales of domestic currency, foreign exchange, gold, and SDRs for purposes of maintaining or utilizing bank reserves.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} the e¤ect of {{a resource}} discovery {{on an open}} economy with endogenous directed technical change. Technical progress depends on entrepreneurs who produce (or adopt) technology, and endogenously choose which sector to operate in. The static e¤ect of a resource discovery is de- industrialization and a rise in non-resource <b>factor</b> <b>incomes,</b> as in standard trade theory. Dynamically, the "brain drain" of entrepreneurs into the re- source sector may exacerbate the de-industrialization over time, but if the discovery is not su¢ ciently large then it leads to temporarily lower growth in non-resource <b>factor</b> <b>incomes,</b> which are lower {{in the long run}} than without the discovery.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} the e¤ect of endogenous directed technical {{change in}} a resource-rich economy, embedding a version of Acemoglu’s model of directed technical {{change in a}} three-by-three trade theory model. Technical progress depends on entrepreneurs who either produce or adopt technology, and who endogenously choose which sector to operate in. The static e¤ect of a resource discovery is de-industrialization and a rise in non-resource <b>factor</b> <b>incomes,</b> as in standard trade theory. The dynamic e¤ect is to exacerbate the deindustrialization over time, but unless the discovery is large enough it leads to lower growth in non-resource <b>factor</b> <b>incomes,</b> which {{in the long run}} are lower than {{in the absence of the}} resource discovery. Thus if natural resources are owned by the government and other factors are owned by the private sector, then real private sector income may grow more slowly in a resourcerich economy than a resource-poor economy. 1...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effects of {{absentee}} ownership of immobile factors on environmental policy of a jurisdiction in a federation. An increase in emissions in a jurisdiction increases <b>factor</b> <b>incomes,</b> {{but part of the}} increased <b>factor</b> <b>incomes</b> goes to absentee owners while only the residents of the jurisdiction bear the full disutility. In addition, the increase in emissions in a jurisdiction attracts capital and decreases capital in other jurisdictions, reducing the incomes that the residents of the jurisdiction earn from owning immobile factors in other jurisdictions. Absentee ownership thus reduces the marginal benefit of an increase in emissions while it leaves the marginal cost unaffected from the jurisdiction’s perspective. As a consequence, absentee ownership makes environmental policy of a jurisdiction too stringent relative to the efficient level. The paper also considers {{the effects of}} absentee ownership on environmental policy when goods trade is allowed.

The theoretical and methodological section describes the current situation of this issue not only in the Czech Republic, together with a reflection on the causes of differences in income and the precaution taken mainly in the Czech Republic. In the practical part there are tested two hypotheses related with income disparities and gender (sex). Central values of incomes were processed broken down by gender and selected factors. Also absolute and relative frequencies in data were analysed and were created two models which examine the dependence of <b>income</b> on selected <b>factors.</b> <b>Incomes</b> in selected countries were compared as supplement. Results are achieved by statistical methods. Output of this work is to assess the income gap between men and women based on available data and to verify hypotheses...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the structure and}} construction of a social accounting matrix (SAM) for Pakistan for 2001 - 02. A SAM is an internally consistent extended set of national accounts that disaggregates value-added in each production activity into payments to various factors (e. g., land, labour, capital), and disaggregates household incomes and expenditures according to various household types. Because this Pakistan SAM is designed for analysis of the links between growth and rural poverty, agricultural activities, agricultural factors of production, and rural household accounts are more disaggregated than are those for urban activities and households. Rural household groups in the SAM are split according to three regions (Punjab, Sindh, and Other Pakistan) to capture the large differences {{in the structure of}} agricultural production and incomes across Pakistan. On average, household incomes in the SAM are 2. 1 times greater than household expenditures in the HIES Survey, reflecting the apparent substantial under-reporting of expenditures (particularly on services) and informal sector incomes in the HIES and other household surveys. Agricultural <b>factor</b> <b>incomes</b> as calculated in the SAM account for only 23 percent of total <b>factor</b> <b>incomes</b> in Pakistan, but 60 percent of total <b>factor</b> <b>incomes</b> for agricultural households. 91 percent of agricultural incomes derive from land, water, own-farm labour, or livestock; earnings of hired labour and (nonlivestock) agricultural capital account for only 9 percent of agricultural incomes. Incomes of large- and medium-farm rural households, calculated using land area cultivated, data from the Agricultural Census, and other data, are significantly higher than indicated in household surveys. ...|$|R

40|$|As {{a result}} of {{advancing}} globalization and economic activities that go beyond national borders, gross domestic product (GDP) and gross national product (GNP) are becoming dissociated.

As a first step in understanding globalization, the idea of risk diversification (or risk sharing) can be useful.
