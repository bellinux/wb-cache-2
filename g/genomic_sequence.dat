5|$|The {{concept of}} a gene {{continues}} to be refined as new phenomena are discovered. For example, regulatory regions of a gene can be far removed from its coding regions, and coding regions can be split into several exons. Some viruses store their genome in RNA instead of DNA and some gene products are functional non-coding RNAs. Therefore, a broad, modern working definition of a gene is any discrete locus of heritable, <b>genomic</b> <b>sequence</b> which affect an organism's traits by being expressed as a functional product or by regulation of gene expression.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{sequence}} {{data from}} genomic and metagenomic projects are essentially the same, but <b>genomic</b> <b>sequence</b> data offers higher coverage while metagenomic data is usually highly non-redundant. Furthermore, {{the increased use}} of second-generation sequencing technologies with short read lengths means that much of future metagenomic data will be error-prone. Taken in combination, these factors make the assembly of metagenomic sequence reads into genomes difficult and unreliable. Misassemblies are caused by the presence of repetitive DNA sequences that make assembly especially difficult because of the difference in the relative abundance of species present in the sample. Misassemblies can also involve the combination of sequences from more than one species into chimeric contigs.|$|E

40|$|The {{accuracy}} of immunodetection by dual parameter flow cytometry (FCM), polymerase chain reaction-mediated single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) and <b>genomic</b> <b>sequencing</b> to detect p 53 mutations were compared. Analysis {{by the last}} two techniques was restricted to exons 5 - 8. Initially, 110 breast tumours were screened for p 53 expression by FCM. Seventy (64 %) of tumours were immunopositive. Fifteen highly immunopositive and 15 completely immunonegative tumours were selected for further analysis by PCR-SSCP and <b>genomic</b> <b>sequencing.</b> Eleven out of 15 immunopositive tumours {{were found to have}} mutation by PCR-SSCP. <b>Genomic</b> <b>sequencing</b> confirmed the presence of mutation in 10 of these 11 immunopositive tumours. Therefore, four immunopositive tumours failed to show mutation by SSCP and five by <b>genomic</b> <b>sequencing.</b> Of the 15 immunonegative tumours, one showed mutation by both PCR-SSCP and <b>genomic</b> <b>sequencing</b> and one tumour has undergone deletion of the p 53 gene. Overall, immunoreactivity correlated with both PCR-SSCP and <b>genomic</b> <b>sequencing</b> in 80 % of cases (24 / 30), and there was 96. 5 % (28 / 29) concordance between PCR-SSCP and <b>genomic</b> <b>sequencing.</b> We conclude that there is good concordance between mutations detected by PCR-SSCP and <b>genomic</b> <b>sequencing,</b> but immunochemical detection of p 53 overexpression is not an absolute indicator of p 53 gene mutation...|$|R

25|$|To infer HGT events, {{which may}} not {{necessarily}} result in phenotypic changes, most contemporary methods are based on analyses of <b>genomic</b> <b>sequence</b> data.

25|$|The {{sequencing}} of individual genomes further unveiled levels of genetic complexity {{that had not}} been appreciated before. Personal genomics helped reveal the significant level of diversity in the human genome attributed not only to SNPs but structural variations as well. However, the application of such knowledge to the treatment of disease and in the medical field is only in its very beginnings. Exome sequencing has become increasingly popular as a tool to aid in diagnosis of genetic disease because the exome contributes only 1% of the <b>genomic</b> <b>sequence</b> but accounts for roughly 85% of mutations that contribute significantly to disease.|$|E

25|$|As noted above, {{there are}} many {{different}} kinds of DNA sequence variation, ranging from complete extra or missing chromosomes down to single nucleotide changes. It is generally presumed that much naturally occurring genetic variation in human populations is phenotypically neutral, i.e. has little or no detectable effect on the physiology of the individual (although there may be fractional differences in fitness defined over evolutionary time frames). Genetic disorders can be caused by any or all known types of sequence variation. To molecularly characterize a new genetic disorder, it is necessary to establish a causal link between a particular <b>genomic</b> <b>sequence</b> variant and the clinical disease under investigation. Such studies constitute the realm of human molecular genetics.|$|E

25|$|With {{the advent}} of the Human Genome and International HapMap Project, it has become {{feasible}} to explore subtle genetic influences on many common disease conditions such as diabetes, asthma, migraine, schizophrenia, etc. Although some causal links have been made between <b>genomic</b> <b>sequence</b> variants in particular genes and some of these diseases, often with much publicity in the general media, these are usually not considered to be genetic disorders per se as their causes are complex, involving many different genetic and environmental factors. Thus there may be disagreement in particular cases whether a specific medical condition should be termed a genetic disorder. The categorized table below provides the prevalence as well as the genes or chromosomes associated with some human genetic disorders.|$|E
25|$|The entire <b>genomic</b> <b>sequence</b> of SNV has {{subsequently}} {{been determined}} by using RNA extracted from autopsy material {{as well as}} RNA extracted from cell culture-adapted virus. The L RNA is 6562 nucleotides (nt) in length; the M RNA is 3696 nt long; and the S RNA is 2059 to 2060 nt long. When the prototype sequence (NMH15) of SNV detected in tissues from an HPS case was compared with the sequence of the SNV isolate (NMR11; isolated in Vero E6 cells from Peromyscus maniculatus trapped in the residence of the same case), only 16 nucleotide changes were found, and none of these changes resulted in alterations in amino acid sequences of viral proteins. It had been assumed that {{in the process of}} adaptation to cell culture, selection of SNV variants which grow optimally in cell culture would occur, and selected variants would differ genetically from the parental virus. Though NMH10 and NMR11 are identical in protein sequence, nucleotide substitutions in nontranslated regions of the genome could be responsible for altered viral phenotypes, as could changes in protein glycosylation or virus membrane components.|$|E
25|$|Molecular cloning {{refers to}} the process of making {{multiple}} molecules. Cloning is commonly used to amplify DNA fragments containing whole genes, {{but it can also be}} used to amplify any DNA sequence such as promoters, non-coding sequences and randomly fragmented DNA. It is used in a wide array of biological experiments and practical applications ranging from genetic fingerprinting to large scale protein production. Occasionally, the term cloning is misleadingly used to refer to the identification of the chromosomal location of a gene associated with a particular phenotype of interest, such as in positional cloning. In practice, localization of the gene to a chromosome or genomic region does not necessarily enable one to isolate or amplify the relevant <b>genomic</b> <b>sequence.</b> To amplify any DNA sequence in a living organism, that sequence must be linked to an origin of replication, which is a sequence of DNA capable of directing the propagation of itself and any linked sequence. However, a number of other features are needed, and a variety of specialised cloning vectors (small piece of DNA into which a foreign DNA fragment can be inserted) exist that allow protein production, affinity tagging, single stranded RNA or DNA production and a host of other molecular biology tools.|$|E

[...] Laccaria bicolor is lacking enzymes involved in the degradation of plant cell wall components (cellulose, hemicellulose, pectins and pectates), preventing the symbiont from degrading host cells during the root colonisation.
