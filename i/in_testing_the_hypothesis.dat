50|$|A {{statistical}} significance test {{is intended to}} test a hypothesis. If the hypothesis summarizes a set of data, there is no value <b>in</b> <b>testing</b> <b>the</b> <b>hypothesis</b> on that set of data. Example: If a study of last year's weather reports indicates that rain in a region falls primarily on weekends, it is only valid to test that null hypothesis on weather reports from any other year. Testing hypotheses suggested by the data is circular reasoning that proves nothing; It is a special limitation on {{the choice of the}} null hypothesis.|$|E
50|$|The {{treatment}} options for imatinib resistant or intolerant CML patients may include {{strategies such as}} increasing the dose of imatinib {{or the use of}} second-generation drugs. Escalation of imatinib-doses has shown to overcome some cases of primary resistance to imatinib, such as Bcr-Abl duplication, but the response is usually short acting. In the case of resistance or intolerance, it could be helpful to test for Bcr-Abl mutations to direct the choice of second line treatment as the variable options have different function profile against the different mechanisms of resistance. Second-generation drugs offer improved potency and a greater likelihood of success in resistant patients. There is also a growing interest <b>in</b> <b>testing</b> <b>the</b> <b>hypothesis</b> that administration of multiple Abl kinase inhibitors in early phase patients could be used to delay or prevent the emergence of drug resistant clones. The combination of two agents targeting different pathways involved in CML may significantly improve response rates and potentially increase survival.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Evidence for the ingroup {{advantage}} hypothesis {{in recognizing}} emotions comes from studies using {{specific types of}} posed expressions. A proposed source of this advantage has been culturally-specific ways of expressing emotions, known as cultural dialects (El-fenbein et al. Emotion 7 (1) : 131 – 146, 2007). But to date, no study has used spontaneously produced expressions as stimuli <b>in</b> <b>testing</b> <b>the</b> <b>hypothesis.</b> We do so here.

If NE plays an etiological role in cancers of a number of organs, then taking a single pharmaceutical drug (such as clonidine, prazosin, or propranolol) that weakens NE signaling systemically, may simultaneously prevent or treat many different types of cancer, and this may represent a breakthrough in pharmaceutical prevention and possibly treatment of cancer...|$|E

The study showed that money is a motivator at work; both the symbolic and instrumentality meaning of money revealed its influence to motivate, energize and direct employment decision and its important role in an organization’s ability to attract and retain qualified, high-performance workers. A major limitation of the study is that, due to financial constraints, it was conducted in only few organizations in one region.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The debt-resource-hypothesis {{suggests}} that high indebtedness leads to increased natural resource exploitation {{as well as}} more unsustainable patterns of resource use. Countries with high debt burdens supposedly increase their extraction of fossil fuels and mineral resources as well as their production of so-called cash crops in order to service their debt obligations. In spite of its popularity, there have been few attempts to systematically test the hypothesis. Existing analyses refer to deforestation only and come to mixed results. This study fills a gap <b>in</b> <b>testing</b> <b>the</b> <b>hypothesis</b> more comprehensively for 23 natural resources and cash crops. It uses first differencing, period-specific time dummies, and a lagged dependent variable tomitigate omitted variable bias.
