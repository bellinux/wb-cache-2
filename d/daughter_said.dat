25|$|Mallory's <b>daughter</b> <b>said</b> that Mallory {{carried a}} {{photograph}} of his wife on his person {{with the intention of}} leaving it on the summit. This photo was not found on Mallory's body. Given the excellent preservation of the body, its garments and other items including documents in his wallet, this points to the possibility that he may have reached the summit and deposited the photo there. On the other hand, Wang (who is known to have taken Mallory's ice-axe) might also have taken the photograph for identification purposes, and no one who has subsequently reached the summit has reported seeing any evidence of the photograph, or any other trace of their presence there.|$|E

2500|$|During the {{remainder}} of the 1970s, Velikovsky devoted a great deal of his time and energy to rebutting his critics in academia, and he continued to tour North America and Europe to deliver lectures on his ideas. By that time, the elderly Velikovsky suffered from diabetes and intermittent depression, which his <b>daughter</b> <b>said</b> may have been exacerbated by the academic establishment's continuing rejection of his work. [...] He died in 1979.|$|E

5000|$|Speaking {{after the}} conviction, Mills-Westley's <b>daughters</b> <b>said</b> {{in a joint}} {{statement}} that their mother had [...] "become known as the lady who was beheaded in Tenerife, {{but the truth is}} she was our mum, mentor and best friend, a highly gifted and selfless person." [...] They described her murder as [...] "preventable and needless" [...] and said there had been a [...] "catalogue of failings" [...] in relation to the handling of Deyanov as a mentally unstable man.|$|R
2500|$|Sutton {{committed}} suicide by {{carbon monoxide poisoning}} on March 16, 2009, apparently to avoid a federal prison term due to begin a few days later. His wife Pam, whom he had married about two years before his death, returned home from running errands and discovered her husband in his green Ford Fairmont (which was still running) {{at the rear of}} their property in Parrottsville, Tennessee.

2500|$|Messoud Ould Boulkheir, the President of the National Assembly, said on August 10 that {{he still}} {{recognized}} Abdallahi as President and rejected {{the idea of a}} new election held under the junta. However, 67 of the 95 deputies in the National Assembly released a statement supporting the coup and describing it as [...] "the logical and indisputable result of President Sidi Ould Cheikh Abdallahi's behaviour to stall the republic's institutions". Meanwhile, Abdallahi's <b>daughter</b> <b>said</b> that the military had been involving itself in politics {{for two and a half}} months, and the PNDD-ADIL announced on August 10 that the junta had allowed it to reopen its offices.|$|E
2500|$|The last {{survivor}} of the Ludlow Massacre, Mary Benich-McCleary, died of a stroke {{at the age of}} 94 on June 28, 2007. She was 18 months old when the massacre occurred. [...] McCleary's parents and her two brothers narrowly escaped death when the conductor of the train that brought the militia to the tent colony stopped the train to shield the family and others trying to flee, but Mary had been left behind. A 16-year-old boy heard her screams, gathered her up into his coat and then ran into the woods. Mary and the boy were found several days later, still hiding.

50|$|Stogner {{claimed that}} the statute violates the ex post facto law and due process clauses by retroactively invoking laws that were not {{in place at the}} time of the alleged offenses. At the time that the crimes were {{allegedly}} committed, the statute of limitations was three years. The victims, his two <b>daughters,</b> <b>said</b> that they had not reported sooner because they were in fear of their father. The applicable California law had been revised in 1996, extending the statute of limitations retroactively.|$|R

2500|$|Allyson {{was born}} Eleanor Geisman, nicknamed [...] "Ella", in the Bronx, New York City. She was the {{daughter}} of Clara (née Provost) and Robert Geisman. She had a brother, Henry, who was two years older. She said she had been raised as a Roman Catholic, but a discrepancy exists relating to her early life, and her studio biography was often the source of the confusion. Her paternal grandparents, Harry Geisman and Anna Hafner, were immigrants from Germany although Allyson claimed her last name was originally [...] "Van Geisman", and was of Dutch origin. Studio biographies listed her as [...] "Jan Allyson" [...] born to French-English parents. Upon her death, her <b>daughter</b> <b>said</b> Allyson was born [...] "Eleanor Geisman to a French mother and Dutch father." ...|$|E
2500|$|Russian fans {{gathered}} outside the U.S. embassy in Moscow to mourn. One told Russia's Novosti newspaper, [...] "This is so difficult!

2500|$|It {{was said}} that those {{ancestors}} were on the Long Walk with their daughter, who was pregnant and about to give birth [...] the daughter got tired and weak and couldn't {{keep up with the}} others or go further because of her condition. So my ancestors asked the Army to hold up for a while and to let the woman give birth, but the soldiers wouldn't do it. They forced my people to move on, saying that they were getting behind the others. The soldier told the parents that they had to leave their daughters behind. [...] "Your daughter is not going to survive, anyway; sooner or later she is going to die," [...] they said in their own language. [...] "Go ahead," [...] the <b>daughter</b> <b>said</b> to her parents, [...] "things might come out all right with me," [...] But the poor thing was mistaken, my grandparents used to say. Not long after they had moved on, they heard a gunshot from where they had been a short time ago.|$|E
