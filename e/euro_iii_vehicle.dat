40|$|The use {{of modern}} {{vehicles}} {{may contribute to}} limiting the adverse impact of urban transport on the environment. Evaluation of options for choosing new means of transport {{in terms of economic}} and ecological benefits allows for the identification of the most advantageous variants. The solution is to consider replacing a bus compliant with a Euro III norm (base variant) with a bus compliant with Euro VI (option 1) or with an electric bus (option 2). The evaluation of the solutions was based on the calculated parameters: a monetary value reflecting the energy cost of the analyzed buses and the ecological effect of the reduced emissions from the Euro VI bus and the electric bus compared with the <b>Euro</b> <b>III</b> <b>vehicle.</b> The ecological effect resulting from the use of the electric bus was determined taking into account emissions from fossil fuels (coal, natural gas) and biomass. The method of cost analysis was used to evaluate the solution of replacing older buses with new ones (with different types of propulsion). It is based on calculating the unit cost of achieving the ecological effect of the solution...|$|E

40|$|European {{regulation}} for Euro 5 / 6 {{light duty}} emissions introduced the {{particle number concentration}} measurement of non-volatile particles with electrical mobility diameter > 23 nm. The volatile phase is removed by using a heated dilution stage (150 °C) and a heated tube (at 300 - 400 °C). We investigated experimentally the volatile removal efficiency of the specific protocol by conducting measurements with two Euro 3 diesel light duty vehicles, a Euro 2 moped, and a <b>Euro</b> <b>III</b> heavy duty <b>vehicle</b> with the system¿s heaters on and off. The particle number distributions were measured with a Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS) and a Fast Mobility Particle Sizer (FMPS). An Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (AMS) was used to identify the non-refractory chemical composition of the particles. A Multi-Angle Absorption Photometer (MAAP) {{was used to measure}} the black carbon concentration. The results showed that the condensed material on the accumulation mode (i. e. particles in the range of 50 - 500 nm) was efficiently removed (50 - 90 %). The (volatile) nucleation mode was also completely evaporated or was decreased to sizes < 23 nm; thus these particles wouldn¿t be counted from the particle counter, indicating the robustness of the protocol.
