It finished the war in Trieste, and remained there to counter the presence of Yugoslav partisans that <b>had</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> city. After {{the withdrawal of the}} partisans several weeks later, the battalion moved to Florence while its long-serving personnel began returning to New Zealand. Not required for service in the Pacific theatre of operations, the battalion was disestablished in late 1945.|$|E

Germany was a three-time winner but had not won the tournament in 24 years. Brazil was in the semi-finals {{for the first time since}} 2002, from which they emerged victorious and subsequently won the tournament against Germany; while Germany was in a record-breaking fourth consecutive semi-final. Both teams <b>had</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> tournament among the favourites to win, with Germany ranked 2nd and Brazil ranked 3rd in the FIFA World Rankings.|$|E
5|$|By November 1944, the First Canadian Army <b>had</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> Nijmegen Salient {{which was}} being held {{for use in the}} {{development}} of future offensives.

The First Canadian Army launched no major offensive operations from November 1944 to January 1945; the longest hiatus the Canadians had enjoyed since landing on the Normandy beaches the previous June.|$|E

Once opponents <b>have</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> auction the chances of game and slam both diminish so different bidding sequences are generally used in this situation.|$|R

5|$|Endeavour then resumed her voyage westward {{along the}} coast, picking {{a path through}} {{intermittent}} shoals and reefs {{with the help of}} the pinnace, which was rowed ahead to test the water depth. By 26 August she was out of sight of land, and <b>had</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> open waters of the Torres Strait between Australia and New Guinea, earlier navigated by Luis Váez de Torres in 1606. To keep Endeavours voyages and discoveries secret, Cook confiscated the log books and journals of all on board and ordered them to remain silent about where they had been.|$|E
5|$|Gordon, who <b>had</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> {{race with}} the points lead, {{extended}} it to 358 points over Mark Martin; nobody would challenge Gordon over {{the remainder of}} the season, and he would go on to win his third Winston Cup Series championship; he was the youngest driver to accomplish the feat. The race took two hours, forty-six minutes, and two seconds to complete, and the margin of victory was 0.176 seconds.|$|E

5|$|In 1945, SBC {{acquired}} the Basler Handelsbank (Commercial Bank of Basel), {{which was one}} of the largest banks in Switzerland, but became insolvent by the end of the war. SBC remained among the Swiss government's leading underwriters of debt in the post-war years. SBC, which <b>had</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> 1950s with 31 branch offices in Switzerland and three abroad, more than doubled its assets from the end of the war to CHF 4billion by the end of the 1950s and doubled assets again in the mid-1960s, exceeding CHF 10billion by 1965.|$|E
5|$|In the primary, Tydings faced {{a strong}} {{challenge}} from Congressman Paul Sarbanes, who <b>had</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> race several months earlier. This head start gave Sarbanes a considerable organizational and monetary advantage, {{and he had}} already secured influential endorsements. To fend off Sarbanes, Tydings hoped his name recognition and charisma on television would compensate for Sarbanes' other advantages. He also worked to relabel himself as more fiscally conservative than Sarbanes, since both candidates were seen as liberal.|$|E

Team Canada <b>had</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> tournament as the defending gold medal champions from the 2002 Winter Olympics, but were eliminated facing Russia in the quarter-finals and finished in seventh place.|$|E

5|$|Polling {{conducted}} between late December 2012 to mid-January 2013 by Civic Science {{found that}} a race between Luke Ravenstahl and Bill Peduto would be within single digit percentage points. The polling firm, however, emphasized that the poll {{was not intended to}} provide two-way race numbers and that the polling (which was completed on January 16) did not include Michael Lamb, who <b>had</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> race the next day. According to the poll, blue-collar primary voters were more apt to support Ravenstahl while white-collar primary voters were more apt to support Peduto.|$|E

5|$|The West Side Boys were unstable, {{possibly}} due to prolonged use of cannabis and cocaine, {{and their}} behaviour {{during the crisis}} was erratic. After their release, the five soldiers described an incident in which Kallay, dissatisfied with their explanation, conducted a mock execution in which he threatened to shoot the soldiers unless they told him why they <b>had</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> West Side Boys' territory. The gang's drug habits also posed {{a problem for the}} British negotiators as the cannabis caused them to forget previous discussions and the cocaine made them distrustful.|$|E

5|$|The {{decision}} to form two groups, Belle Amie and One Direction, from soloists {{at the end}} of the bootcamp stage was branded unfair by some of the other groups, as neither <b>had</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> competition as groups. The controversy deepened after Cowell put through both Belle Amie and One Direction and picked just one of the original applicants. Cowell defended the decision, saying that the existing groups were not good enough and other groups such as The Wanted and the Spice Girls were created similarly.|$|E
