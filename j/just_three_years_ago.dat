6000|$|Thank you, {{my dearest}} Miss Mitford: It is great comfort {{to know that}} you are better, and that the cholera does not {{approach}} your neighbourhood. My brothers and sisters have gone to Worthing for a few weeks; and though my father (dearest Papa!) is not persuadeable, I fear, into joining them, yet it is something to know that the horrible pestilence is abating in London. Oh, it has made me so anxious: I have caught with such a frightened haste at the newspaper to read the 'returns,' leaving even such subjects as Rome and the President's letter to quite the last, as if they were indifferent, or, at most, bits of Mrs. Manning's murder. By the way and talking of murder, how do you account for the crown of wickedness which England bears just now {{over the heads of the}} nations, in murders of all kinds, by poison, by pistol, by knife? In this poor Tuscany, which has not brains enough to govern itself, as you observe, and as really I can't deny, there have been two murders (properly so called) since we came, <b>just</b> <b>three</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> one from jealousy and one from revenge (respectable motives compared to the advantages of the burying societies!), and the horror on all sides was great, as if the crime were some rare prodigy, which, indeed, it is in this country. We have no punishment of death here, observe! The people are gentle, courteous, refined, and tenderhearted. What Balzac would call 'femmelette.' All Tuscany is 'Lucien' himself. The leaning to the artistic nature without the strength of genius implies demoralisation in most cases, and it is this which makes your 'good for nothing poets and poetesses,' about which I love so to battle with you. Genius, I maintain always, you know, is a purifying power and goes with high moral capacities. Well, and so you invite us home to civilisation and 'the [...] "Times" [...] newspaper.' We mean to go next spring, and shall certainly do so unless something happen to catch us and keep us in a net. But always something does happen: and I have so often built upon seeing England, and been precipitated from the fourth storey, that I have learnt to think warily now. I hunger and thirst for the sight of some faces; must I not long, do you think, to see your face? And then, I shall be properly proud to show my child to those who loved me before him. He is beginning to understand everything--chiefly in Italian, of course, as his nurse talks in her sleep, I fancy, and can't be silent a second in the day--and when told to 'dare un bacio a questo povero Flush,' he mixes his little face with Flush's ears in a moment.... You would wonder to see Flush just now. He suffered this summer from the climate somewhat as usual, though not nearly as much as usual; and having been insulted oftener than once by a supposition of 'mange,' Robert wouldn't bear it any longer (he is as fond of Flush as I am), and, taking a pair of scissors, clipped him all over into the likeness of a lion, much to his advantage in both health and appearance. In the winter he is always quite well; but the heat and the fleas together are too much in the summer. The affection between baby and him is not equal, baby's love being far the stronger. He, on the other hand, looks down upon baby. What bad news you tell me of our French writers! What! Is it possible that Dumas even is struck dumb by the revolution? His first works are so incomparably the worst that I can't admit your theory of the 'first runnings.' So of Balzac. So of Sue! George Sand is probably writing 'banners' for the 'Reds,' which, considering the state of parties in France, does not really give me a higher opinion of her intelligence or virtue. Ledru Rollin's[190] confidante and councillor can't occupy an honorable position, and I am sorry, for her sake and ours. When we go to Florence we must try to get the 'Portraits' and Lamartine's autobiography, which I still more long to see. So, two women were in love with him, were they? That must be a comfort to look back upon, now, when nobody will have him. I see by extracts from his newspaper in Galignani that he can't be accused of temporising with the Socialists any longer, whatever other charge may be brought against him: and if, as he says, it was he who made the French republic, he is by no means irreproachable, having made a bad and false thing. The President's letter about Rome[191] has delighted us. A letter worth writing and reading! We read it first in the Italian papers (long before it was printed in Paris), and the amusing thing was that where he speaks of the 'hostile influences' (of the cardinals) they had misprinted it 'orribili influenze,' which must have turned still colder the blood in the veins of Absolutist readers. The misprint was not corrected until long after--more than a week, I think. The Pope is just a pope; and, since you give George Sand credit for having known it, I am the more vexed that Blackwood (under 'orribili influenze') did not publish the poem I wrote two years ago,[192] in the full glare and burning of the Pope-enthusiasm, which Robert and I never caught for a moment. Then, I might have passed a little for a prophetess as well as George Sand! Only, to confess a truth, the same poem would have proved how fairly I was taken in by our Tuscan Grand Duke. Oh, the traitor! ...|$|E

In his brown good-looking face the hazel eyes, which in these three God-deserted years had acquired a sort of startled gloom, stared out like a dog's, rather prominent, seeing only the thoughts within him--thoughts and images swirling round and round in a dark whirlpool, drawing his whole being deeper and deeper. He was unconscious of all the summer hum and rustle--the cooing of the dove up in that willow tree, the winged enamelled fairies floating past, the chirr of the cicadas, that little brown lizard among the pebbles, almost within reach, seeming {{to listen to the}} beating of summer's heart so motionless it lay; unconscious, as though in verity he were again deep in some stifling trench, with German shells whining over him, and the smell of muck and blood making foetid the air. He was in the mood which curses God and dies; for he was devout--a Catholic, and still went to Mass. And God had betrayed the earth, and Jean Liotard. All the enormities he had seen in his two years at the front--the mouthless mangled faces, the human ribs whence rats would steal; the frenzied tortured horses, with leg or quarter rent away, still living; the rotted farms, the dazed and hopeless peasants; his innumerable suffering comrades; the desert of no-man's land; and all the thunder and moaning of war; and the reek and the freezing of war; and the driving--the callous perpetual driving, by some great Force which shovelled warm human hearts and bodies, warm human hopes and loves by the million into the furnace; and over all, dark sky without a break, without a gleam of blue, or lift anywhere--all this enclosed him, lying in the golden heat, so that not a glimmer of life or hope could get at him. Back into it all again! Back into it, he who had been through forty times the hell that the [...] "majors" [...] ever endured, five hundred times the hell ever glimpsed at by those députés, safe with their fat salaries, and their gabble about victory and the lost provinces, {{and the future of the}} world--the Canaille! Let them allow the soldiers, whose lives they spent like water--"les camarades" [...] on both sides--poor devils who bled, and froze, and starved, and sweated--let them suffer these to make the peace! Ah! What a peace that would be--its first condition, all the sacred politicians and pressmen hanging in rows in every country; the mouth fighters, the pen fighters, the fighters with other men's blood! Those comfortable citizens would never rest till there was not a young man with whole limbs left in France! Had he not killed enough Boches, that they might leave him and his tired heart in peace? He thought of his first charge; of how queer and soft that Boche body felt when his bayonet went through; and another, and another. Ah! he had [...] "joliment" [...] done his duty that day! And something wrenched at his ribs. They were only Boches, but their wives and children, their mothers--faces questioning, faces pleading for them--pleading with whom? Ah! Not with him! Who was he that had taken those lives, and others since, but a poor devil without a life himself, without the right to breathe or move except to the orders of a Force which had no mind, which had no heart, had nothing but a blind will to go on, it knew not why. If only he survived--it was not possible--but if only he survived, and with his millions of comrades could come back and hold the reckoning! Some scare-the-crows then would waggle in the wind. The butterflies would perch on a few mouths empty at last; the flies enjoy a few silent tongues! Then slowly his fierce unreasoning rancour vanished into a mere awful pity for himself. Was a fellow never again to look at the sky, and the good soil, the fruit, the wheat, without this dreadful black cloud above him, never again make love among the trees, or saunter down a lighted boulevard, or sit before a café, never again attend Mass, without this black dog of disgust and dread sitting on his shoulders, riding him to death? Angels of pity! Was there never to be an end? One was going mad under it--yes, mad! And the face of his mother came before him, as he had seen her last, <b>just</b> <b>three</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> when he left his home in the now invaded country, to join his regiment--his mother who, with all his family, was in the power of the Boche. He had gone gaily, and she had stood like stone, her hand held over her eyes, in the sunlight, watching him while the train ran out. Usually the thought of the cursed Boches holding in their heavy hands all that was dear to him, was enough to sweep his soul to a clear, definite hate, which made all this nightmare of war seem natural, and even right; but now it was not enough--he had [...] "cafard." [...] He turned on his back. The sky above the mountains might have been black for all the joy its blue gave him. The butterflies, those drifting flakes of joy, passed unseen. He was thinking: No rest, no end, except by walking over bodies, dead, mangled bodies of poor devils like himself, poor hunted devils, who wanted nothing but never to lift a hand in combat again so long as they lived, who wanted--as he wanted--nothing but laughter and love and rest! Quelle vie! A carnival of leaping demonry! A dream--unutterably bad! [...] "And when I go back to it all," [...] he thought, [...] "I shall go all shaven and smart, and wave my hand as if I were going to a wedding, as we all do. Vive la France! Ah! what mockery! Can't a poor devil have a dreamless sleep!" [...] He closed his eyes, but the sun struck hot on them through the lids, and he turned over on his face again, and looked longingly at the river--they said it was deep in mid-stream; it still ran fast there! What was that down by the water? Was he really mad? And he uttered a queer laugh. There was his black dog--the black dog off his shoulders, the black dog which rode him, yea, which had become his very self, just going to wade in! And he called out: ...|$|E

Topology {{optimization}} {{of fluid}} dynamical systems {{is still in}} its infancy, with its first academic realizations dating back to as late as <b>three</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> In this paper, we present two approaches to fluid dynamic topology optimization that are based on potential flows and adjoint states, respectively. Special emphasis is paid to the computation of topological sensitivities with discrete adjoints and its versatility with respect to changes of the cost function: After providing the proof of concept of a discrete adjoint-based methodology for the optimization of dissipated power, we compute sensitivities with respect to equal mass flow through different outlets, flow uniformity and also angular momentum of the flow in the outlet plane. 1 TOPOLOGY OPTIMIZATION IN FLUID DYNAMICS In structure mechanics, topology optimization is a well-established concept for design optimization with respect to tension or stiffness [1].

Yet could there be more to it than that? Today, we 2 ̆ 7 ll speak to two women who have smashed the boardroom 2 ̆ 7 s glass ceiling and who have lived to tell the tale.   Guests Anthea McIntyreSenior Policy Advisor and Legal Counsel, Australian Institite of Company Directors Andrea StainesCompany director Wendy McCarthyCompany director Further Information Australian Institute of Company Directors Tomorrow 2 ̆ 7 s Boards: Creating Balanced and Effective Boards    ...|$|E
40|$|Or {{is it more}} a case of {{the declining}} left? Jennifer Curtin looks at the {{evidence}} from Saturday 2 ̆ 7 s poll The National government’s triumphant win on Saturday, and Labour’s corresponding loss, has broken at least three records, and the pundits are still counting. First, National has won sufficient seats to govern in its own right, a rare event in any proportional representation system, and a first in New Zealand’s comparatively short history of mixed-member proportional voting, or MMP. Even Germany, where MMP has been a feature since 1949, has only once experienced a majority government (in 1957). Interestingly, the result in New Zealand was achieved by a party that <b>just</b> <b>three</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> held a government-initiated referendum on whether New Zealand should keep MMP or return to first past the post. Some of National’s most ardent supporters actively campaigned for what they called a “Vote for Change. ” There was no vote for change, but clearly National needn’t have bothered. The second record involves National’s winning margin of 48 per cent of the vote, which was larger than their vote share in both 2008 and 2011. This {{is the first time that}} a third-term government has increased its margin in almost ninety years, and the increase is underpinned partly by the significant inroads National has made in the Auckland and Christchurch city electorates that used to be Labour’s heartland. Third, Labour’s vote share of 24. 4 per cent is its worst result since 1922. Even when Helen Clark was defeated after three terms in office, Labour’s party vote was 10 percentage points higher than it was on Saturday. Read the full article>   Photo: chrisjtse/Flick...|$|E
40|$|<b>Just</b> <b>three</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> Congress enacted {{controversial}} {{amendments to}} the Bankruptcy Code. The proponents claimed that the changes would drive the 2 ̆ 2 can pay 2 ̆ 2 debtors (of which there were supposedly many) from the bankruptcy courts with tough new income-based eligibility requirements. And indeed, after {{the enactment of the}} amendments, the number of people filing for bankruptcy plunged. In this Article - the initial report of the 2007 Consumer Bankruptcy Project - the authors analyze the first national, random sample of post-amendments bankruptcy filers. Contrary to the advocates 2 ̆ 7 claim that high-income filers would be driven from the system and, by implication, that those remaining would have more modest incomes, the data show no change in the income levels of bankruptcy filers after the amendments. These findings thus cast doubt on the suggestion that those purged from the bankruptcy courts - approximately 800, 000 in 2007 alone based on trend extrapolation - were high-income deadbeats; they instead appear to have been ordinary American families in serious financial distress. The data also show that debtors filing for bankruptcy in 2007 have even greater debt loads than their counterparts from 2001, a development that seems to track a national trend of increasing consumer debt. The findings thus align with at least two predictions of some legal scholars. The first is that the bankruptcy reform bill was not aimed at high-income abusers but was instead a general assault on all debtors, regardless of their financial circumstances. The second is that debtors are waiting longer - and incurring more debt - before ultimately seeking bankruptcy relief, consistent with the so-called 2 ̆ 2 sweat box 2 ̆ 2 theory of credit card lending...|$|E
