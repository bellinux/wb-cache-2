5000|$|In the {{automotive}} industry, injection-molded polycarbonate can produce very smooth surfaces {{that make it}} well-suited for sputter deposition or evaporation deposition of aluminium {{without the need for}} a base-coat. <b>Decorative</b> <b>bezels</b> and optical reflectors are commonly made of polycarbonate.Due to its low weight and high impact resistance, polycarbonate is the dominant material for making automotive headlamp lenses. However, automotive headlamps require outer surface coatings because of its low scratch resistance and susceptibility to ultraviolet degradation (yellowing).The use of polycarbonate in automotive applications is limited to low stress applications. Stress from fasteners, plastic welding and molding render polycarbonate susceptible to stress corrosion cracking when it comes in contact with certain accelerants such as salt water and plastisol.It can be laminated to make bullet-proof [...] "glass", although [...] "bullet-resistant" [...] is more accurate for the thinner windows, such as are used in bullet-resistant windows in automobiles. The thicker barriers of transparent plastic used in teller's windows and barriers in banks are also polycarbonate.|$|R
