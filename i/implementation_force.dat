5|$|Cross {{served his}} {{first of three}} tours in the Balkans, {{attached}} to the <b>Implementation</b> <b>Force</b> (IFOR), in 1995–1996. His second was in 1997, with the Stabilisation Force (SFOR), where he commanded 101 Logistic Brigade, and his third in 1999 with the Kosovo Force (KFOR). During his tour with KFOR, {{he was responsible for}} co-ordinating multinational troops and civilian agencies in establishing refugee camps {{in the aftermath of the}} Kosovo War. He was later appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for his service with KFOR. Cross was promoted to major general (two-star rank in NATO terms) in 2000 and served as Director General, Defence Supply Chain until 2002, when he became involved in planning for the forthcoming invasion of Iraq. He was the most senior British officer involved in the planning and in the Coalition Provisional Authority.|$|E
5|$|Jackson {{attained}} general officer {{status with}} promotion to acting major general in May 1992, after holding only one post as a brigadier; in peacetime, senior officers are normally {{expected to have}} held two posts before promotion. He was appointed Director General Personal Services (Army) at the Ministry of Defence, reporting to the Adjutant General. He was granted the substantive rank of major general in June 1992, with his promotion backdated to October 1991. After two years at the MoD, Jackson took command of the 3rd Mechanised Division in April 1994. During the Yugoslav Wars in 1995, Jackson had been due to succeed Rupert Smith as commander of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR), which would have entailed early promotion to lieutenant general (three-star rank) and a blue beret, signifying UN command. As {{a result of the}} Dayton Agreement, however, UNPROFOR became the NATO-led <b>Implementation</b> <b>Force</b> (IFOR), and Jackson remained a major general (two-star rank), commanding the 3rd Division and troops from several other countries who made up Multinational Division South-West. Jackson retained command of the 3rd Division until July 1996 and went on to serve briefly in a staff post as the Army's Director General of Development and Doctrine. He was appointed Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in November 1996.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Staff College, Camberley, Dannatt {{took the}} Higher Command and Staff Course (HCSC), {{after which he}} was {{promoted}} to colonel on 31 December 1991, backdated to 30 June 1991, and tasked with the running of the HCSC, as well as updating the British Military Doctrine {{in the light of the}} end of the Cold War. He also drafted the campaign plan for Lieutenant General (later General Sir) Mike Rose's command of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in the Balkans. Dannatt was promoted to brigadier on 31 December 1993, backdated to 30 June 1993, and took command of 4th Armoured Brigade, based in Germany. He spent 1994 commanding the brigade and overseeing training and, in 1995, was posted to Bosnia along with his headquarters staff, leaving the rest of the brigade in Germany and taking command of separate units already deployed in Bosnia. He commanded UNPROFOR's Sector South West, composed of troops from multiple nations, while also serving as Commander of British Forces (COMBRITFOR), responsible for overseeing operations of all British troops in Bosnia. After the signing of the Dayton Agreement in November 1995, UNPROFOR became the NATO-led <b>Implementation</b> <b>Force</b> and Dannatt's brigade was incorporated into a multi-national division commanded by Mike Jackson. Dannatt was later appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for his service in the Balkans. Handing over 4th Armoured Brigade to David Richards, Dannatt was appointed Director, Defence Programme Staff at the MoD in 1996 and was responsible for part of the implementation of the Strategic Defence Review, produced by the Labour government that had come to power in 1997.|$|E

He returned to the Balkans with the ARRC during the Kosovo War, during which he famously refused to obey an order from American General Wesley Clark, his immediate superior in the NATO chain of command, to block the runways of Pristina Airport and isolate the Russian contingent that was positioned there. He reportedly told Clark, [...] "I'm not going to start the Third World War for you". The incident attracted controversy, particularly in the United States, and earned Jackson the nickname [...] "Macho Jacko" [...] in the British tabloid press.

40|$|Abstract. PVM (the current version 3. 4) {{as well as}} many current MPI <b>implementations</b> <b>force</b> {{application}} programmers to use active polling (also {{known as}} busy waiting) in larger parallel programs. This serious problem is related to thread-unsafety of these communication libraries. While the MPI specification is very careful in this respect, the implementations are not. We present a new mechanism of interruptable blocking receive which makes PVM and MPI quasi-thread-safe. This mechanism does not require any modifications to the existing semantics of PVM or MPI (we only extend the interfaces with two new functions) and allows writing multi-threaded programs without active polling. Then we sketch how the interrupt mechanism can be hidden in the implementations of PVM and MPI, making both PVM and MPI completely threadsafe without active polling. Results of our experiments promise a significant speedup for all larger communication-intensive parallel applications...|$|R

The 320th Engineer Company deployed their topographic surveying platoon the following year. The 130th Engineer Brigade was tasked with building an assault bridge over the Sava River. Despite severe flooding conditions around the river and international pressure against such a structure, the brigade sent its units to begin work on the bridge. In December 1995, the 502nd Engineer Company deployed to Zupanja, Croatia and placed the historic ribbon bridge over the river. This bridge, at [...] was the longest assault floating bridge in military history. The company operated 24-hours a day for three months crossing critical traffic in support of Task Force Eagle and NATO's <b>Implementation</b> <b>Force.</b> The company also assisted {{in the construction of}} a second bridge over the Sava River in Brčko-Gunja. The 502nd Engineer Company redeployed in May 1996, with a rafting section remaining at Slavonski Brod to support the force restructuring of Task Force Eagle. The 130th Engineer Brigade would go on to construct seven fixed bridges in support of the operation. During the deployment, the brigade was also tasked with creating and maintaining maps and overlays of the area of operations. It would produce over 300,000 such maps.
