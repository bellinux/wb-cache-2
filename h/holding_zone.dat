The number of annual visitors to the Capitol has tripled from 1,000,000 in 1970 to nearly 3,000,000 as of recent times, and it has become difficult to deal with the congestion caused by such crowds. In the past, visitors were required to line up on the Capitol's east stairs, sometimes stretching all the way to 1st Street East. This wait could last hours and no protection was offered against inclement weather. Tickets were not timed and were on a first-come, first-served basis.|$|E
40|$|Concentration of {{zooplankton}} in a <b>holding</b> <b>zone</b> {{near the}} shore during onshore winds {{may be explained}} hypothetically by the built-in behaviourial responses of planktonic organ-isms (particularly crustacean larvae) to landwash vibrations. These responses initiate verti-cal or other migrations which take advantage of compensatory outward currents and keep the plankton from drifting ashore. Lagoon or estuary entrances change the “noise ” pattern and the plankton (especially penaeid shrimp or crab larvae) enter the estuary at the deep-est part of such channels with inward tidal flows. Key words: Currents, winds, zooplankton. that those without such defences against drifting ashore did not survive. Those that have survived apparently can sense the nearness of the shore or surf zone and have a pattern of behaviour such as migrating downward {{to take advantage of}} outward going currents to take them away from the shore...|$|E

CMAS tried unsuccessfully to hold another World Underwater Games event in 2009 after a successful event in 2007. These were intended to be multi-disciplinary events thereby grouping UWH with other CMAS-represented sports including fin swimming and underwater rugby. The 1st World Games were held in Bari, Italy in 2007 while the 2nd was scheduled for Tunisia in 2009 but was cancelled and re-scheduled as an UWH-only event held in Kranj, Slovenia during August 2009. It was billed as a World Championship but only one non-European country competed (South Africa); France won the Open division while Great Britain took the Women's title.

If such a point is lost, the player will be unable to call in reinforcements until it is re-secured. They will lose the game if they possess no units with which to capture a deployment zone.

The UK <b>holds</b> Protected <b>Zone</b> status against this pest and, as a result, B. tabaci entering on plant material is subjected to a policy of eradication. There has recently been a shift from Middle East-Asia Minor 1 to the more chemical resistant Mediterranean species entering the UK. Predatory mites (Amblyseius swirskii, Transeius montdorensis and Typhlodromalus limonicus) were screened for their impact upon various lifestages of B. tabaci Mediterranean species. Approximately 30 % of eggs were fed upon by A. swirskii following a 5 day period. Feeding rates slightly decreased for all mite species when feeding on first instar life-stages (27 %, 24 %, 16 % respectively) and significantly decreased when feeding on second instars (8. 5 %, 8. 5 %, 8. 7 % respectively). Combining the two mite species (A. swirskii and T. montdorensis) increased mortality of Bemisia eggs to 36 %.

40|$|The sweetpotato {{whitefly}} Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) is a pest {{of global}} importance on both outdoor and glasshouse crops. To date, B. tabaci has not become {{established in the}} UK. The UK <b>holds</b> Protected <b>Zone</b> status against this pest and, as a result, B. tabaci entering on plant material is subjected to a policy of eradication. Mediterranean species is now the most prevalent Bemisia species entering the UK. Increasing neonicotinoid resistance is becoming increasingly widespread and problematic with this species. As a result, this continues to pose problems for eradication strategies. The current study investigates the efficacy of Tri-Tek (a petroleum horticultural oil awaiting UK registration) and the fungus Beauveria bassiana to act as control agents against Mediterranean species in UK glasshouses. Tri-Tek provided 100 % egg mortality compared to 74 % for B. bassiana. When tested against second instar larvae, mortalities of 69 % and 65 % respectively were achieved.
