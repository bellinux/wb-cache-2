500|$|... "742617000027" [...] is the intro {{track to}} the album. It {{contains}} some guitar scratches and abstract sound {{samples from the}} sampler Craig Jones. Some of the dialogue was reportedly taken from a Charles Manson documentary. The dialogue is [...] "The whole thing, I think it's sick." [...] In an interview shortly after the album was released, Joey Jordison claimed the voice is Corey Taylor's, sped up. 742617000027 was the barcode number on their 1996 self-released album Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat. All of the band members wear that number on their jumpsuits. [...] "Wait and Bleed" [...] is {{about a man who}} keeps having repetitive black and white dreams about laying in a bathtub full of his own blood with his wrists slit. One day, he wakes up and sees that his dream has become a reality. However, he doesn't want to believe it and he tries to fall back asleep again. Chris Fehn said that [...] "Surfacing" [...] "basically encompasses everything. Kind of encompasses the attitude of the band and the attitude of how we feel about life: Don't judge me. Everything that you think that you know about the world, and about Slipknot, and about your own life, might not be the case. So I think it's just openmindedness and just be cool." [...] Paul Gray said about the meaning behind [...] "Surfacing" [...] chorus: [...] "Basically, we dedicate it to the kids as their new national anthem. It's our way of saying don't worry about everybody else. Just worry about yourself. Don't worry about the people judging and the people coming <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>you</b> and all the fake crap. Stick to what you believe in." [...] "Spit It Out" [...] was written in response to some individuals who worked at a local radio station in Des Moines, Iowa, where Slipknot is from. These individuals worked hard to keep Slipknot off the air. [...] "Prosthetics" [...] was inspired by the 1965 film The Collector, which is about a butterfly collector who chose to collect humans, too.|$|E
2500|$|Indeed, {{the fourth}} dispute asserts that {{judgment}} {{is coming in}} the form of a messenger who [...] "is like refiner's fire and like fullers' soap [...] [...] [...]" [...] (3:2). Following this, the prophet provides another example of wrongdoing in the fifth dispute – that is, failing to offer full tithes. In this discussion, Malachi has Yahweh request the people to [...] "Bring the full tithe [...] [...] [...] [...] see if I will not open the windows of heaven for you and pour <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>you</b> an overflowing blessing" [...] (3:10). This request offers the opportunity for the people to amend their ways. It also stresses that keeping the Lord's statutes will not only allow the people to avoid God's wrath, but will also lead to God's blessing. In the sixth dispute, the people of Israel illustrate the extent of their disillusionment. Malachi has them say [...] "'It is vain to serve God [...] [...] [...] Now we count the arrogant happy; evildoers not only prosper, but when they put God to the test they escape'" [...] (3:14–15). Once again, Malachi has Yahweh assure the people that the wicked will be punished and the faithful will be rewarded.|$|E
