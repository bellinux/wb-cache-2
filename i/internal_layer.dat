25|$|The {{chemical}} structure of charcoal in terra preta soils {{is characterized by}} poly-condensed aromatic groups, that provide prolonged biological and chemical stability against microbial degradation; it also provides, after partial oxidation, the highest nutrient retention. Low temperature charcoal (but not that from grasses or high cellulose materials) has an <b>internal</b> <b>layer</b> of biological petroleum condensates that the bacteria consume, and is similar to cellulose in its effects on microbial growth. Charring at high temperature loses that layer and brings little increase in soil fertility. The formation of condensed aromatic structures depends on the method of manufacture of charcoal. The slow oxidation of charcoal creates carboxylic groups; these increase the cations' exchange capacity of the soil. The nucleus of black carbon particles produced by the biomass remains aromatic even after thousands of years and presents the spectral characteristics of fresh charcoal. Around that nucleus and {{on the surface of}} the black carbon particles, there are higher proportions of forms of carboxylic and phenolic carbons spatially and structurally distinct from the particle's nucleus. Analysis of the groups of molecules provides evidences both for the oxidation of the black carbon particle itself, as well as for the adsorption of non-black carbon.|$|E
500|$|Members of the {{two houses}} met in a conference {{committee}} on September 19 in a session described by onlookers as [...] "fairly hot and heavy".

[...] The obverses of the three coins would not change, but would bear the double date 1776–1976. [...] By {{the terms of the}} statute, all coins minted to be issued after July 4, 1975 and before January 1, 1977 would bear the Bicentennial dates and designs. [...] Congress directed the Mint to strike 45,000,000 silver clad coins (that is, 15,000,000 sets), and the Mint received the requested authority to strike coins at West Point. [...] Circulation quarters, half dollars and dollars would continue to be of copper nickel bonded to an <b>internal</b> <b>layer</b> of copper, that is, copper nickel clad. [...] The modified bill passed both houses of Congress on October 4, 1973, and the bill was signed into law by President Richard Nixon on October 18. [...] Hatfield's measure, along with similar legislation from other senators, was reintroduced in 1975, but died in committee, as did legislation seeking a Bicentennial two-cent piece and a bill seeking a coin honoring Abigail Adams and Susan B. Anthony. [...] The extra production at West Point was key to overcoming a shortage of cents in 1974, and permitted the Mint greater flexibility as it geared up to strike the Bicentennial pieces.|$|E

This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} <b>internal</b> <b>layering</b> across Pine Island Glacier, West Antarctica, as measured from airborne-radar data acquired during a {{survey conducted by the}} British Antarctic Survey and the University of Texas in the 2004 / 05 season. <b>Internal</b> <b>layering</b> is classified according to type (continuous/discontinuous/missing) and the results compared with InSAR velocities. Several areas exhibit disruption of <b>internal</b> <b>layers</b> that is most likely caused by large basal shear stresses. Signs of changes in flow were identified in a few inter-tributary areas, but overall the layering classification and distribution of layers indicate that only minor changes in ice-flow regime have taken place.

Echoes from the bedrock, which represent the basal topography, were also measured even at places where the ice sheet on it was thicker than 3500 m.

40|$|New {{experimental}} research is presented {{on the characteristics}} of interfaces and <b>internal</b> shear <b>layers</b> that are present in a turbulent boundary layer (TBL). The turbulent/non-turbulent (T/NT) interface at the outer boundary of the TBL shows the presence of a finite jump in streamwise velocity and is characterised by a thin shear layer. It appears that similar layers of high shear occur also within the TBL which separate regions of almost uniform momentum. It turns out that they exhibit similar characteristics as the external T/NT interface. Furthermore, the spatial growth rate of the TBL, that is derived from theoretical analysis, can be correctly predicted from a momentum balance near the external T/NT interface. Similarly, the entrainment velocities for the average <b>internal</b> <b>layers</b> have been determined. Results indicate that <b>internal</b> <b>layers</b> move slower {{in the vicinity of the}} wall, whereas they move faster than the large scale boundary layer growth rate in the outer region of the TBL.

To improve understanding of how ice stream dynamics there evolved through the Holocene, we interrogate radio echo sounding (RES) data from across the catchments of Institute and Möller Ice Streams (IIS and MIS), focusing especially {{on the use of}} <b>internal</b> <b>layering</b> to investigate ice-flow change. As an important component of this work, we investigate the influence that the orientation of the RES acquisition track with respect to ice flow exerts on <b>internal</b> <b>layering</b> and find that this influence is minimal unless a RES flight track parallels ice flow. We also investigate potential changes to <b>internal</b> <b>layering</b> characteristics with depth to search for important temporal transitions in ice-flow regime. Our findings suggest that ice in northern IIS, draining the Ellsworth Subglacial Highlands, has retained its present ice-flow configuration throughout the Holocene. This contrasts with less topographically constrained ice in southern IIS and much of MIS, whose <b>internal</b> <b>layering</b> evinces spatial changes to the configuration of ice flow over the past ∼ 10, 000 years. Our findings confirm Siegert et al.
