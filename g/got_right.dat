Another plan the band had was to pay entirely for mastering and manufacturing, and to then find a distributor. The band took meetings with various label heads, including with Brett Gurewitz, former Bad Religion guitarist and head of Epitaph Records, where the band was signed from 2003 to 2008.

2500|$|With [...] "Somethings Weird," [...] Eisenstein played Wildrick {{the song}} and [...] "we <b>got</b> <b>right</b> to work". Wildrick felt the song [...] "represents an {{awakening}} within a relationship". According to Collier, [...] "Punishment" [...] was [...] "a [...] song, and I feel he always writes sad tunes." [...] Hrycenko found [...] "Not the First a challenge" [...] to [...] "get good enough with all the transitions that I felt confident tracking". He called it [...] "pretty heavy, and the little roll on the ride in the bridge is super tight". According to Eisenstein, the group used to call [...] "Headstone" [...] the [...] "H20 Song" [...] as they considered it [...] "super manly, fast and punk". Eisenstein composed the guitar riff in a hotel in Arizona, and wrote the lyrics {{in the back of}} the group's van. The group had forgotten about [...] "Spunn" [...] until Jimmy Dunn, a friend of the band, reminded them about it. Dunn had a copy of Eisenstein's demo of the song, which he dug out for the group. According to Hrycenko [...] "Picture Perfect" [...] went through 10 different names because of the lyric about a car. Wildrick claimed that [...] "Night Feelings" [...] bridge shows that Bruzzese and Eisenstein are fans of 311. According to Collier, people who heard the album's final track, [...] "Atlas," [...] called it [...] "a wild card of a song for this album". He felt the song did not have the same vibe as the rest of the songs on the album.|$|E
