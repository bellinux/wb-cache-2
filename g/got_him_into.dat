He set up the kit in his bedroom and his parents gave him certain times to practice. Then his father <b>got</b> <b>him</b> <b>into</b> the Post Office Workers Band, which played orchestral melodies with percussion, along with marching band standards. He {{attended}} Scoil Colmcille, Marlborough Street, Dublin. He took the exams for Chanel College and St. Paul's, two Catholic schools his father wanted his son to attend. After the accidental death of Larry's younger sister in 1973, his father gave up the idea of pushing his son into those schools and sent Larry to Mount Temple Comprehensive School, the first interdenominational school in Ireland.|$|E
25|$|Boris' Anglophobia <b>got</b> <b>him</b> <b>into</b> trouble {{during the}} War. In June 1916, {{he was having}} supper at {{military}} headquarters while drunk, and {{in the presence of}} several officers of the British Military mission, he lambasted Great Britain. His behavior was so insulting that the British Ambassador made a formal protest, and Boris was forced by the Emperor to apologize.|$|E

He was assigned to the U.S.O. in the South Pacific to entertain the troops. He was a clever, wisecracking master of ceremonies whose impersonations of officers nearly <b>got</b> <b>him</b> <b>into</b> trouble.|$|E

Thereafter Bachchan started supporting the Samajwadi Party, the political party to which Amar Singh belonged. Furthermore, Jaya Bachchan joined the Samajwadi party and represented the party as an MP in the Rajya Sabha. Bachchan has continued to do favours for the Samajwadi party, including appearing in advertisements and political campaigns. These activities have recently <b>got</b> <b>him</b> <b>into</b> trouble in the Indian courts for false claims after a previous incident of submission of legal papers by him, stating that he is a farmer.|$|E
25|$|Tom van Vollenhoven the brush-cut wing who {{appeared}} on the scene in 1955, was the kind of player who captured the imagination every time he touched the ball. His try for the Light Blues against the Junior Springboks in 1955, when he beat one player after another in spectacular a zigzag run of almost 80 metres, is still lauded as the try of all tries. This <b>got</b> <b>him</b> <b>into</b> the Springbok side against the 1955 British Lions of Robin Thomson and in the second test scored a hat trick of tries. He would probably {{have been one of the}} greatest heroes if he had not gone off to play professional rugby league in England so early in his career.|$|E
25|$|At {{the age of}} 17, Oda {{submitted}} {{his work}} Wanted! and won several awards, including {{second place in the}} coveted Tezuka Award.

At the age of 19, he began working as an assistant to Nobuhiro Watsuki on Rurouni Kenshin, before winning the Hop Step Award for new artists. Watsuki credits Oda for helping create the character Honjō Kamatari who appears in Rurouni Kenshin.|$|E

25|$|Natural talent {{combined}} with aggression and passion made Qadir {{one of the}} most successful spinners of his era. He had a distinct run-up, bounding in to the crease, and a great variety of deliveries: there was the orthodox leg-break, the topspinner, two googlies and the flipper. He was unique for bowling leg spin at a time when it was not only rare but considered obsolete, and he kept the torch alight for a generation of leg spinners. His fervent appeals made him a great favourite with the spectators but sometimes <b>got</b> <b>him</b> <b>into</b> trouble with umpires. Qadir played 67 Test matches during 1977–90 and took 236 wickets, with an average of 32.80, including 15 five-wicket hauls. His best bowling performance was against England at the Gaddafi Stadium, Lahore in 1987. He also scored 1,029 runs including three fifties.|$|E
25|$|Hoad won {{his first}} Italian Championships on the clay courts of the Foro Italico in Rome in early May when he outplayed Sven Davidson in {{straight}} sets. At the French Championships Hoad survived a five-set scare against Robert Abdesselam {{in the third round}} to reach the final which he won against Sven Davidson in straight sets to claim his second consecutive title at a Grand Slam event. Unknown to the public Hoad had stayed up the night previous to the final, invited by a Russian diplomat, and was drunk when he came home. An intensive workout by Rod Laver <b>got</b> <b>him</b> <b>into</b> a state that allowed him to play the final. In May Hoad won the International Golden Ball tournament in Wiesbaden, West Germany after a straight-sets victory in the final over Art Larsen but in the Trofeo Conde de Godó in Barcelona he lost in the quarterfinal to Bob Howe. As a preparation for Wimbledon Hoad elected to play the singles event at the Northern Championships in Manchester instead of the Queen's Club Championships. He reached the final but had to bow for 34-year old Jaroslav Drobný who won the deciding set 7–5. Hoad was seeded first for the Wimbledon Championships and was the pre-tournament favorite. He lost two sets along the way to reach the final, in which he faced Rosewall. In the first all-Australian final since 1922 Hoad was victorious in four sets to gain his first Wimbledon and third successive Grand Slam championship title. Hoad also won the doubles title with Rosewall, their third Wimbledon title, outclassing Orlando Sirola and Nicola Pietrangeli in the final in straight sets. Following his Wimbledon title he entered the Midlands tournament and was beaten in the semifinal by Mike Davies. In August Hoad won the singles title at the German Championships, held on the clay courts at Hamburg, after a four-set defeat of Orlando Sirola in the final.|$|E
500|$|When Gareth David-Lloyd {{was cast}} in the role, the {{character}} was renamed Ianto Jones. This {{was inspired by the}} character of Yanto Jones, also played by David-Lloyd, in Russell T Davies's 2004 comedy-drama Mine All Mine. Ianto shares the surname [...] "Jones" [...] with Doctor Who characters Martha Jones and family as well as Harriet Jones, Torchwood character Eugene Jones ("Random Shoes"), and Stuart Allen Jones in Davies's earlier Queer as Folk; Davies states that reusing names (such as Tyler, Smith, Harper, Harkness and Jones) allows him to get a grip of the character on the blank page. In developing the character's attire, costume designer Ray Holman comments: [...] "Ianto has a very distinct look but his suits actually vary quite a lot. He started off with some nice but boring Marks and Spencers suits in series one, which were top-end fitted ones but always very sober. Towards the end of series one, I also <b>got</b> <b>him</b> <b>into</b> a waistcoat, and everyone thought that looked really good.|$|E

500|$|Although Lundgren {{has never}} competed as a {{professional}} bodybuilder, he has been closely associated with bodybuilding and fitness since his role as Drago in the mid-1980s. Bodybuilding.com said, [...] "Looking like {{a man in his}} 30s rather than his 50s, Lundgren is the poster boy of precise nutrition, supplementation and exercise application that he has practiced for over 35 years." [...] In an interview with them, he claimed to often train up to six days a week, usually one-hour sessions completed in the morning, saying that [...] "it's just one hour a day, and then you can enjoy the other 23 hours". Although he had begun lifting weights as a teenager, he cites co-star Sylvester Stallone as the man who <b>got</b> <b>him</b> <b>into</b> serious bodybuilding for a period in the 1980s after he arrived in the U.S. Stallone had a lasting influence on his fitness regime and diet, ensuring that he ate a much higher percentage of protein and split his food intake between five or six smaller meals a day. Lundgren has professed never to have been [...] "super strong", saying that, [...] "I'm too tall and my arms are long. I think back then [...] I was working with around 300 pounds on the bench and squat." ...|$|E
500|$|A video {{confession}} {{which was}} released {{at the same}} time and broadcast on China Central Television confirmed his identity. In the 10-minute exclusive video, a tearful Gui expressed his remorse over a killing charge that he had absconded from a decade earlier. He said that his return to mainland China and his surrender were [...] "my personal choice and had nothing to do with anyone else. I should shoulder my responsibility and I don't want any individual or institutions to interfere, or viciously hype up my return". Gui also said, [...] "Although I have Swedish citizenship, I truly feel that I am still Chinese — my roots are in China. So I hope Sweden can respect my personal choice, respect my rights and privacy of my personal choice and allow me to resolve my own problems". Criminal investigations on other charges were said to be in progress. It was only on 19 January, when fellow Swedish citizen Peter Dahlin, cofounder of an NGO providing legal training for local lawyers in China, appeared on television, confessing to having violated Chinese law and [...] "caused harm to the Chinese government [...] hurt the feelings of the Chinese people", that it came to international attention that Gui had also confessed on television; Dahlin was subsequently deported. Reporters Without Borders condemned China's forced confessions, and urged the EU to sanction CCTV and Xinhua for [...] "knowingly peddling lies and statements presumably obtained under duress". Lee Bo's letter to his wife on 17 January said that he had voluntarily gone to the mainland to assist Chinese law enforcement in an investigation that involved Gui. He denounced Gui as [...] "a morally unacceptable person" [...] who had <b>got</b> <b>him</b> <b>into</b> trouble with the authorities.|$|E
500|$|One of Blow's {{goals for}} The Witness {{was to explore}} the types of non-verbal {{communication}} {{that can be achieved}} by the medium of video games, an exploration he felt to be important to understanding them as an art form. The name The Witness is derived from core gameplay aspect of making the player perceptive of the surroundings to discover meaning and solutions to the puzzles without verbal communication, a similar approach taken by Myst (1993). Blow attributes much of The Witnesss design to Myst, a game that <b>got</b> <b>him</b> <b>into</b> video game development. One aspect of Myst that Blow desired to correct was the nature of [...] "pixel hunting" [...] in some of its puzzles; the player would have to click on various parts of the virtual machinery without knowing what the end result was until sometime later in the puzzle. Within The Witness, Blow created a unifying mechanic for all the puzzles to avoid this confusion, using the maze panels as this mechanic. While the interaction mechanics are the same for all these mazes, the rules and behavior described by the game's symbolic language that limit or result from the interactions form the core of the puzzles in the game. The island was divided into sections so that all the information the player needed to understand the specific behavior of puzzles in that section would be in one general location, a means to [...] " [...] down a lot of ambiguity that used to exist in adventure games". Puzzles within the game were designed to be meaningful {{within the context of the}} game, rather than to be simply a puzzle to be solved, and further aimed to be different from any other puzzle within the game.|$|E

50|$|After Tyson's {{dominating}} {{victory over}} Frank Bruno five months prior, negotiations {{for a potential}} bout with Carl Williams began, and on June 15, 1989, the fight was made official. Four years earlier, Williams had challenged then-IBF Heavyweight champion Larry Holmes for the title, only to narrowly lose by unanimous decision. Prior to his fight with Tyson, Williams had won his previous five fights, including a victory over former champion Trevor Berbick which <b>got</b> <b>him</b> back <b>into</b> contention.|$|R

50|$|Tyson {{would follow}} his victory with a no contest against Orlin Norris (due to Tyson {{injuring}} Norris after the bell) and easy wins over Julius Francis and Lou Savarese that <b>got</b> <b>him</b> back <b>into</b> contention.
