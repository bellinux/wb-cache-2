This study was specially designed to assess physical and chemical properties of water quality of Keenjhar Lake, Thatta, Sindh, Pakistan. This field study can be helpful to the state how the fresh water reservoir is being polluted now days become bed water resource and drinking water supply for 20 million people in Karachi metropolitan city, Pakistan.
