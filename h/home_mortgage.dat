5|$|It {{appeared}} {{as though the}} government might seize Lincoln for being insolvent. The investigation was, however, taking a long time. Keating was asking that Lincoln be given a lenient judgment by the FHLBB, {{so that it could}} limit its high risk investments and get into the safe (at the time) <b>home</b> <b>mortgage</b> business, thus allowing the business to survive. A letter from audit firm Arthur Young & Co. bolstered Keating's case that the government investigation was taking a long time. Keating now wanted the five senators to intervene with the FHLBB on his behalf.|$|E
25|$|The current {{federal income}} tax law allows {{individuals}} to deduct the <b>home</b> <b>mortgage</b> interest costs from taxable income (unless the taxpayer {{is subject to the}} Alternative Minimum Tax). <b>Home</b> <b>mortgage</b> interest {{is one of the few}} personal expenditures that is treated in this manner. Someone paying a 25% income tax rate would receive $250 back from the government for $1,000 expended in <b>home</b> <b>mortgage</b> interest. While there is no deduction for payroll taxes and most do not itemize the income tax deduction for full benefit, this preferential treatment of mortgage interest encourages households to spend relatively more of their income on housing than would otherwise be the case.|$|E

40|$|Financial {{innovation}} {{is widely believed}} {{to be at least}} partly responsible for the recent financial crisis. There are also empirical and theoretical arguments that support the view that changes in financial markets {{played a role in the}} "great moderation". If both are true, then the price for reducing the likelihood of another crisis, e. g., through new regulation, could be giving up another episode of sustained growth and low volatility. However, this paper questions empirical evidence supporting the view that innovation in consumer credit and <b>home</b> <b>mortgages</b> reduced cyclical variations of key economic variables. We find that especially the behavior of aggregate <b>home</b> <b>mortgages</b> changed less during the great moderation than is typically believed. Although aggregate <b>home</b> <b>mortgages</b> declined during monetary tightenings, both before and during the great moderation, we find strong substitutions in the ownership of <b>home</b> <b>mortgages</b> during such episodes. That is, monetary tightenings became episodes during which financial institutions other than banks increased their holdings in mortgages. One can question the desirability of such strong substitutions of ownerships during economic downturns...|$|R

Counting his wife, there were eight living heirs at the time Stradivari wrote the draft. Zambelli was left with her clothing, half of her jewelry, bed linens and {{household}} items. Antonio declared she would become the responsibility of his two eldest sons. As for Annnunciata Caterina, Antonio left her jewelry, income on loans, clothing and linens. Paolo, the youngest child, was to get six finished violins as well as some household effects and cash. Three other children who had joined religious orders were left with their share of inheritance. Maria, a nun, would get an annuity, Alessandro, a priest, would get fixed income on a <b>home</b> <b>mortgage</b> loan and Giuseppe, another priest would get some income on half a share from a pastry shop. There were also annual payments to his two sons of 150 and 300 lire each, 170 lire for Annunciata as well as 100 for Francesca. To put this into perspective, six violins were valued at approximately 1,000 lire.|$|E

500|$|A {{week after}} the audit results were released, Kentucky's Executive Branch Ethics Commission {{reported}} that Farmer was the only constitutional officer who had failed to file a required disclosure of his 2011 finances by the required April 16 deadline. Farmer's attorney said the omission was [...] "simply a matter of oversight on Richie's part given with [...] what all has been going on." [...] Days later, First National Bank of Manchester filed a foreclosure suit against Farmer, alleging that no payments had been made on his $300,000 <b>home</b> <b>mortgage</b> since January 2012. Under terms of his pending divorce, Farmer was solely responsible for the mortgage on the house. The divorce was finalized in July, and on September 24, 2012, the house was sold at auction after Farmer was not successful in selling it himself. Earlier that week, a judge denied Farmer's request to reduce his child support payments, which were based on his salary as agriculture commissioner. Farmer, {{who had not been}} employed since leaving office in January 2012, told the court that the investigation into his tenure as agriculture commissioner had made it difficult to find employment. The judge found that Farmer was [...] "voluntarily underemployed", although he suspended the child support payments for the months of September and October 2012 in light of Farmer's recovery from an August 30 hip replacement surgery. On November 9, 2012, the Lexington Herald-Leader reported that Farmer had found employment at a car dealership in Manchester.|$|E

A letter from audit firm Arthur Young & Co. bolstered Keating's case that the government investigation was taking a long time.

The two had a heated, contentious meeting in which McCain said he had not spent years in North Vietnamese prisoner-of-war camps to have his courage or integrity questioned; the friendship ended and they would not speak again. In April 1987, the group of senators met twice with FHLBB members who were investigating American Continental Corporation and Lincoln, in an attempt to end the investigation. Meanwhile, Keating filed a lawsuit against the FHLBB, saying it had leaked confidential information about Lincoln. The outgoing head of the FHLBB in Washington deferred judgment and the new head was more sympathetic to Keating. In May 1988, the FHLBB agreed to an unprecedented memorandum of understanding giving Lincoln a clean slate and forgiveness for any violations up to that point. (In 1991, the senators would be rebuked to various degrees by the Senate Ethics Committee, with Cranston receiving the harshest verdict and Glenn and McCain the least. McCain later testified against Keating in a civil lawsuit brought by Lincoln bondholders, while the other four refused to testify.) ...|$|E
