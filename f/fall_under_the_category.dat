[...] This has been recognized at least since the early nineteenth century. [...] However, it is only recently that arable farmers have begun to consider these beetles in their crop rotations. [...] This renewed interest in the role of beetles in crop rotations is due to many factors; some of which are: the decreased value of crops and pressure from environmental groups to decrease the use of pesticides and other farming practices that are detrimental to the environment. [...] Most of the more recently adopted farming practices (e.g. selective insecticides and augmenting non-crop habitat) will affect the population of ground beetles, but not immediately. [...] Pest management effects will not be noticeable until more extensive measures are implemented.|$|E
