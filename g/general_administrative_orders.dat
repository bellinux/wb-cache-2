5000|$|In the Dutch {{constitutional}} system {{there is not}} only formal law; also other general governmental regulations are recognised, binding the citizen; the overarching concept is called [...] "material law". These other regulations are the [...] "other prescripts" [...] mentioned in the heading of §1. Only the most important subcategory of these is explicitly mentioned in the constitution, in Article 89: the Algemene maatregelen van bestuur, [...] "General Administrative Orders". To avoid doctrinal strive over what orders exactly are covered by this concept, a consensus has developed that a strict formal definition can be applied: all general orders made by Royal Decree (Subarticle 1) that have been submitted to the Council of Ministers and to the Council of State and have been published by the Staatsblad, are <b>General</b> <b>Administrative</b> <b>Orders.</b> Since the Second World War a doctrinal consensus has gradually developed that all general Royal Decrees have to conform to these conditions to be valid and that earlier practices to issue general Royal Decrees without meeting these three formalities — such Decrees, general or otherwise, are called [...] "minor Royal Decrees" [...] — can no longer result in regulations with binding force towards the citizen. Since 1889 the constitution determines that all prescripts with a penal character have {{to be based on}} formal law and that this law imposes the penalty (Subarticles 2 and 4). This includes the Royal Decrees and thus the <b>General</b> <b>Administrative</b> <b>Orders.</b> A doctrinal consensus has developed, however, that all <b>General</b> <b>Administrative</b> <b>Orders,</b> not just those with penal content, have to be based on formal law to be valid, with the competence to regulate delegated by such law.|$|E
50|$|The Governor of Curaçao is the {{representative}} on Curaçao of the Dutch {{head of state}} (King Willem-Alexander). The governor's duties are twofold: he represents and guards the general interests of the Kingdom and {{is head of the}} government of Curaçao. He is accountable to the government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. As the head of the government, the Governor is immune. The Governor exercises the executive power under the responsibility of the ministers, who are responsible to the Estates of Curaçao. The Governor does not have political responsibilities and {{is not part of the}} cabinet. During the formation of a cabinet the governor plays an important role. The governor is appointed by the King for a period of six years. This period can be prolonged for one more term of six years. The governor is supported by his secretariat the cabinet of the governor, and is advised by the Council of Advice (Raad van Advies), consisting of at least 5 members, appointed by the governor, advising him on the drafts of state ordinances, state decrees, kingdom acts and <b>general</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>orders.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Jones also {{authored}} An Oppressive Cook County Courtroom. [...] “Our nation's perennial {{allegiance to}} the idea that courts are public so that justice may be discussed and criticized in public has such strong appeal to the personal ethos of American culture that even the nation's highest court {{is open to the public}} and permits note-taking. So should Cook County officials have discretion to ban citizens from taking notes during public court proceedings?” Jones asked. In response, Chief Judge of the Circuit Court of Cook County issued <b>General</b> <b>Administrative</b> <b>Order</b> No 2014-06, which flatly rebuked the practice and prohibited judges from instituting general bans on courtroom note-taking for the first time in the Cook County history. The Chicago Tribune would subsequently publish, Judge Sullivan, Take Notes: A Law Professor Schools a Cook County Judge in the First Amendment, identifying Jones’s work as the catalyst for the new regulation and robust improvements in Cook County courtroom procedures.|$|R
40|$|Abstract niet beschikbaarBij the {{industry}} some sticking points {{are set in}} the current draft <b>General</b> <b>Administrative</b> <b>Order</b> on Building materials dd/ 26 / 9 / 91 (oBB). These are: insufficient balance between re-use and soil protection {{it appears that the}} standard values from the draft are unofficially in charge. As a result the application of a number of building materials are decreasing which are allowed at this moment the standard values of leaching are based on a short experience with the leaching test in the laboratory. The advices concerning the standard values for composition didn't come to an unanimous opinion. The directorate asked the National Institute for Public health and Environmental Protection (RIVM) : to give a list of building materials which could be applied according to the draft standard values of the oBB. To give an evaluation and explanation of the calculations for the standard values. To give the consequences of the evaluated standard values for the re- use of building materials.

40|$|In this {{literature}} survey {{to assess the}} accumulation of micropollutants in activities regulated by <b>General</b> <b>Administrative</b> <b>Order</b> (GAO) of the Dutch Soil Protection Act, seven GAOs were considered. The main aim was to determine {{by means of a}} critical load approach if the annual accumulation of micropollutants from activities regulated by the GAOs would cause exceedance of the Dutch target value within a 100 -year period. A secundary aim was to evaluate this critical load approach, as described and used in earlier RIVM studies. In this approach, the actual annual loads to soil (kg. ha- 1. yr- 1) from activities mentioned above are compared with critical loads for micropollutants. Critical loads are calculated using a model called SOACAS and represent the annual loads which will prevent the target value for soil being exceeded for a defined time period. The annual input of micropollutants is compared with these critical loads. To avoid accumulation of micropollutants in groundwater, a critical load is introduced to protect the soil water. In conclusion, additional policy measures will have to be generated to avoid accumulation of micropollutants exceeding Dutch target values for soil and groundwater. Sharp emission reduction is especially necessary for copper and zinc from pig manure. Recommendations considered for advanced research, monitoring and policy have been proposed for each of the GAOs...|$|R
40|$|The lack of {{landfill}} {{capacity for}} {{waste in the}} Netherlands has prompted a Dutch government policy strongly recommending the re-use of (bulky) waste in building and road construction works. To minimize pollution, secondary raw materials have to meet the standards for inorganic leaching and organic composition as set down in the <b>General</b> <b>Administrative</b> <b>Order</b> on Construction Materials (Soil and Surface Waters Protection) in the Netherlands. The RIVM has investigated the impact this <b>Administrative</b> <b>Order</b> {{will have on the}} applicability of potential secondary raw materials and products manufactured from these materials. The granular waste materials studied consist of various types of demolition wastes, bottom ash from municipal waste incinerators and powdered coal-fired power installations, phosphorus slag, steel slag, polluted dredging sludge, jet grit, different kinds of casting sand, mining stone and iron-containing sludge from drinking-water purification. Products studied were various types of cement concrete, asphalt cement and road-base materials. Whenever possible three or even more samples of the same waste were taken at different locations. The chemical composition and leaching behaviour were measured after pretreatment of the samples, the latter according to the standard leaching tests for the Netherlands, i. e. a column test for the granulates and a diffusion test for the products. When compared with the standards of the Order, the results for the granulate samples showed inconsistency in leaching and composition behaviour, i. e. some of the samples met the standards of the Order and so can be suitably applied as building materials, while others of the same granulate did not and so cannot be applied. The products showed fairly good consistency in their composition and leaching behaviour. With a few exceptions, all products from wastes were found suitable for application...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} reuse {{contaminated}} subbase material from a road in Limburg, a civil engineering and environmental investigation was conducted. The {{aim of this}} investigation program was to determine which additive mixed with the sampled subbase material produces satisfactory civil engineering and environmental results. Specimen were made from representative samples of this material together with different percentages of cement (4 - 7 - 10 and 12 %), 20 % of geosta, this being a mixture of 60 % cement and 40 % of geosta-E, {{which was supposed to}} be a promising immobilisation agent and finally a mixture of 3 % of cement and 3 % of bitumen emulsion (EMC). The civil engineering pre-investigation showed that specimen made with at least 7 % of cement meet the required compressive strength of 5 N/mm 2 after 28 days of curing. The specimen made with 20 % of geosta did not meet the required compressive strength. Specimen made with 7 % and 12 % of cement, 20 % of geosta and EMC were subjected to an environmental investigation which specifically examined the leaching behaviour of arsenic, copper, lead and zinc and the composition of mineral oil and polycyclo aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH's). This environmental investigation showed that the specimen with cement only meet the norms of category 1 as stipulated in the Dutch <b>General</b> <b>Administrative</b> <b>Order</b> on Building Materials. The others meet the norms of category 2. The overall conclusion of this investigation is that the stabilisation of the sampled contaminated subbase with 7 % of cement satisfactorially meets civil engineering and environmental requirements...|$|R
40|$|The {{technical}} {{background to}} supporting the policy decisions on allocating phosphate-saturated soils and tackling the problems which these soils cause are presented here. Since 1987 the Dutch government has taken several steps to diminishing {{the problem of}} phosphate-saturated soils. New legislation will become available in 1998 for regulating the use of nutrients. The Ministries of Agriculture, Nature Management and Fisheries (LNV) and of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment (VROM) are planning to issue a <b>general</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>order</b> (GAO) to regulate phosphate use on phosphate-saturated soils. Several choices {{have to be made}} beforehand (1) Should the GAO cover the total agricultural area or should it be limited to, for example, the areas with known high historical loads? (2) What method should be used to identify phosphate-saturated soils? (3) Should management of all phosphate-saturated soils be restricted by the GAO or only the most polluted ones? (4) What level of net phosphorus export from the fields for which the GAO prescribes management restrictions should be implemented? Alternative answers to each of these questions have been formulated, with the pro's and cons for each given. Answers {{from the perspective of the}} GAO regulating farm management pertain to the national scale. The alternatives described can also be used for regulation limited to selected areas, such as those for nature conservation. In this case, methods described here can be used to select fields within the selected areas. In conclusion, several suggestions for future research are given, such as focusing on the effects in the long and medium term of soil phosphorus depletion on both agriculture and the environment. Although there are still questions to be answered, it has been made clear that the phosphorus status of most soils in the Netherlands at the moment is unnecessarily high from both the agricultural (plant production) and the environmental viewpoints...|$|R
