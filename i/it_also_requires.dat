5|$|According to the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP), {{children}} who exhibit signs of reactive attachment disorder need a comprehensive psychiatric assessment and individualized treatment plan. The signs or symptoms of RAD {{may also be}} found in other psychiatric disorders and AACAP advises against giving a child this label or diagnosis without a comprehensive evaluation. Their practice parameter states that the assessment of reactive attachment disorder requires evidence directly obtained from serial observations of the child interacting with his or her primary caregivers and history (as available) of the child’s patterns of attachment behavior with these caregivers. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>requires</b> observations of the child’s behavior with unfamiliar adults and a comprehensive history of the child’s early caregiving environment including, for example, pediatricians, teachers, or caseworkers. In the US, initial evaluations may be conducted by psychologists, psychiatrists, Licensed Marriage and Family Therapists, Licensed Professional Counselors, specialist Licensed Clinical Social Workers or psychiatric nurses.|$|E
5|$|Although Steinitz's play changed abruptly, he {{said had}} been {{thinking}} along such lines for some years: Some of the games which I saw Paulsen play during the London Congress of 1862 gave a still stronger start to the modification of my own opinions, which has since developed, and I began to recognize that Chess genius {{is not confined to}} the more or less deep and brilliant finishing strokes after the original balance of power and position has been overthrown, but that <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>requires</b> the exercise of still more extraordinary powers, though perhaps of a different kind to maintain that balance or respectively to disturb it at the proper time in one's own favor.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>requires</b> honour to one's stepparents or {{an older}} sibling who is raising one, and one's teachers, though {{one has a}} greater {{obligation}} to honor a parent than a grandparent.|$|E

25|$|This species {{requires}} specific {{climatic conditions}} (cold winter, sunny summer). <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>requires</b> wide open spaces (with {{a cover of}} shrubs less than 5%) and a large surface of lawns (at least 50%). The presence of the host plant for the caterpillars is critical.|$|E
50|$|The Dawes Severalty Act of 1887 {{required}} {{allotment of}} communal lands on reservations to individual households to force assimilation of tribes. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>required</b> Indian children to attend English-language boarding schools.|$|R

50|$|The Continuing Resolution {{approved}} by Congress on October 16, 2013, zeroed all construction funding and prohibited starting construction. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>required</b> that all funding necessary to complete construction {{be in place}} before construction begins.|$|R
25|$|The Kakutani {{fixed point}} theorem generalizes the Brouwer fixed-point theorem in a {{different}} direction: it stays in Rn, but considers upper hemi-continuous correspondences (functions that assign to each point of the set {{a subset of the}} set). <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>requires</b> compactness and convexity of the set.|$|E
25|$|The Privacy Rule gives {{individuals}} {{the right}} to request that a covered entity correct any inaccurate PHI. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>requires</b> covered entities to take reasonable steps to ensure the confidentiality of communications with individuals.

25|$|Because the Edman {{degradation}} {{proceeds from}} the N-terminus of the protein, it will not work if the N-terminus has been chemically modified (e.g. by acetylation or formation of Pyroglutamic acid). Edman degradation is generally not useful to determine the positions of disulfide bridges. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>requires</b> peptide amounts of 1 picomole or above for discernible results, making it less sensitive than mass spectrometry.|$|E
50|$|North Fork's {{construction}} entailed {{the building}} of the 1.9-mile-long North Fork Fish Ladder, one of the longest in the world. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>required</b> a complex system to provide for downstream fish passage around the dam.|$|R
5000|$|The {{introduction}} of the cavity magnetron caused a revolution in radar design, generating large amounts of power from a compact and easy-to-build device. However, <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>required</b> several additional developments {{before it could be}} used.|$|R

25|$|The Stargate Atlantis series finale {{demonstrates}} the wormhole drive, essentially taking the Stargate concept and applying {{it to an}} interstellar vessel. The drive allows Atlantis {{to move from the}} edge of the Milky Way galaxy to Earth in moments, similar to a Stargate, but uses a tremendous amount of power. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>requires</b> precise calculation to successfully arrive at the target destination without destroying the ship.|$|E
25|$|Title IV {{consists}} of nine sections. It describes enhanced reporting requirements for financial transactions, including off-balance-sheet transactions, pro-forma figures and stock transactions of corporate officers.

25|$|Buildings {{account for}} around 40% of EU energy {{requirements}} {{and have been}} the focus of several initiatives. From 4 January 2006, the 2002 Directive on the energy performance of buildings requires member states to ensure that new buildings, as well as large existing building undergoing refurbishment, meet certain minimum energy requirements. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>requires</b> that all buildings should undergo 'energy certification' prior to sale, and that boilers and air conditioning equipment should be regularly inspected.|$|E
25|$|Development {{within and}} around the reserve poses {{a problem for the}} {{conservation}} plans. The construction of the Patuca II hydroelectric plant in the Patuca river highlights the elements of the debate. A hydroelectric plant does more than affect the waterway where it is built. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>requires</b> infrastructure that disturbs the environment around it. A lot of the reserve does not have developed roadways or power. A hydroelectric facility would require development throughout the reserve.|$|E
25|$|This option {{allows the}} {{operating}} system to boot on real hardware. The data is sent via a local area network (LAN) to the client machine. This requires two computers: one as the client machine (on which the OS is booted) and one as the server (usually the development machine). <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>requires</b> a network connecting the two computers, a client machine with a network card, and a Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) that can PXE boot. , debugging over a network is unsupported.|$|E

25|$|The {{electricity}} {{industry was}} restructured by the , which unbundled the vertically integrated electricity supply utilities {{in each state}} of India into a transmission utility, {{and a number of}} generating and distribution utilities. Electricity Regulatory Commissions in each state set tariffs for electricity sales. The Act also enables open access on the transmission system, allowing any consumer (with a load of greater than 1 MW) to buy electricity from any generator. Significantly, <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>requires</b> each Regulatory Commission to specify the minimum percentage of electricity that each distribution utility must source from renewable energy sources.|$|E
25|$|Sweet sorghum {{is another}} {{potential}} source of ethanol, and is suitable for growing in dryland conditions. The International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) is investigating the possibility of growing sorgham {{as a source of}} fuel, food, and animal feed in arid parts of Asia and Africa. Sweet sorghum has one-third the water requirement of sugarcane over the same time period. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>requires</b> about 22% less water than corn (also known as maize). The world’s first sweet sorghum ethanol distillery began commercial production in 2007 in Andhra Pradesh, India.|$|E
25|$|One {{objection}} {{that has}} been made to this theory is that it is too complex. While it accounts for many possible sentences, <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>requires</b> introducing new rules and constraints, and treats bound variable pronouns differently from other types of pronouns. Proponents of this objection, such as linguist Tanya Reinhart, argue that the difference between bound variable pronouns and pronouns of other kinds should be a semantic rather than a syntactic difference. They propose that a syntactic theory that requires less rules would be a more preferable theory.|$|E
5000|$|The Act made {{ventilation}} {{mandatory in}} mines {{so as to}} limit the levels of methane in the air. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>required</b> mine walls to be [...] "dusted" [...] with a limestone to limit the levels of coal dust.|$|R
