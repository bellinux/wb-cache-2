5|$|Rhythm game or rhythm {{action is}} a genre of music-themed action video game that {{challenges}} a player's sense of rhythm. Games in the genre typically focus on <b>dance</b> <b>or</b> the simulated performance of musical instruments, and require players to press buttons in a sequence dictated on the screen. Doing so causes the game's protagonist or avatar to <b>dance</b> <b>or</b> to play their instrument correctly, which increases the player's score. Many rhythm games include multiplayer modes in which players compete for the highest score or cooperate as a simulated musical ensemble. While conventional control pads {{may be used as}} input devices, rhythm games often feature novel game controllers that emulate musical instruments. Certain dance-based games require the player to physically dance on a mat, with pressure-sensitive pads acting as the input device.|$|E
5|$|Krishna's {{childhood}} {{illustrates the}} Hindu concept of lila, playing {{for fun and}} enjoyment and not for sport or gain. His interaction with the gopis at the rasa <b>dance</b> <b>or</b> Rasa-lila is an example. Krishna plays his flute and the gopis come immediately, from whatever they were doing, to {{the banks of the}} Yamuna River, and join him in singing and dancing. Even those who could not physically be there join him through meditation. He is the spiritual essence and the love-eternal in existence, the gopis metaphorically represent the prakṛti matter and the impermanent body.|$|E
5|$|In January 1994, the National Arts Council (NAC) stopped funding unscripted {{performance}} art following a controversial performance by Josef Ng that {{was regarded as}} obscene by {{many members of the}} public. From that time, Tang and other {{performance art}}ists mostly practised their art abroad, although some performances were presented in Singapore as <b>dance</b> <b>or</b> theatre. For his originality and influence in performance art in Southeast Asia, among other things, Tang won the Arts and Culture Prize in 1999 at the 10th Fukuoka Asian Culture Prizes. The NAC eventually reversed its no-funding rule on performance art in September 2003. Tang was one of four artists who represented Singapore at the 2007 Venice Biennale. Tang's work is part of the collection of the Singapore Art Museum, Queensland Art Gallery and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum.|$|E

5|$|Since {{dance is}} already an art form, “weapon dance as art” may seem redundant; yet, “art” is used here {{to mean the}} re-creation, say, of a folk weapon dance in a more {{professional}} staged venue, such as a ballet, or when an Australian, Native American, or African troupe of professional musicians and dancers present a reenactment on stage of a weapon <b>dance,</b> <b>or</b> when the use of weapons is introduced in stylized dance enactments of fighting. For example, recent ballets such as the New York City Ballet’s version of Romeo and Juliet (to the music of Sergei Prokofiev) employ highly choreographed sword-fight/dance sequences.|$|E
5|$|The {{power of}} stories to {{entertain}} {{is evident in}} one of the most famous ones—Scheherazade—a story in the Persian professional storytelling tradition, of a woman who saves her own life by telling stories. The connections between the different types of entertainment are shown by the way that stories like this inspire a retelling in another medium, such as music, film or games. For example, composers Rimsky-Korsakov, Ravel and Szymanowski have each been inspired by the Scheherazade story and turned it into an orchestral work; director Pasolini made a film adaptation; and there is an innovative video game based on the tale. Stories may be told wordlessly, in music, <b>dance</b> <b>or</b> puppetry for example, such as in the Javanese tradition of wayang, in which the performance is accompanied by a gamelan orchestra or the similarly traditional Punch and Judy show.|$|E
5|$|Bound for Glory IV {{took place}} on October 12, 2008 at the Sears Centre in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, where it {{featured}} eight professional wrestling matches. The maximum capacity of the Sears Centre is about 11,800, however, only 5,000 were in attendance for the event. All four of TNA's active championships {{at the time were}} defended at the event. The main event featured Sting defeating TNA World Heavyweight Champion Samoa Joe to become the new champion. Another featured match was Jeff Jarrett versus Kurt Angle with Mick Foley as the Special Guest Enforcer, which Jarrett won. Other matches on the card included a Four-Way Tag Team Monster's Ball match for the TNA World Tag Team Championship with Steve McMichael as the Special Guest Referee, which was won by Beer Money, Inc. (Robert Roode and James Storm), who were accompanied by Jacqueline, over the teams of Abyss and Matt Morgan, Brother Ray and Brother Devon—known as Team 3D—and The Latin American Xchange (Homicide and Hernandez); a match involving three competitors, also known as a 3-Way <b>Dance</b> <b>or</b> a Three Way match, resulting in Booker T defeating Christian Cage and A.J. Styles; and Sheik Abdul Bashir defeating Consequences Creed to retain the TNA X Division Championship.|$|E

5|$|By 1770, Sabrina {{began to}} {{question}} Day's techniques and {{to complain about the}} chores she had to perform. In December, the propriety of Day's arrangement with Sabrina was questioned by the local community, especially Anna Seward. Edgeworth joined Day for Christmas at Stowe, and convinced him that his experiment had been unsuccessful. He also persuaded Day that Sabrina was too old to live with him without a chaperone. Day appeared to accept Edgeworth's point of view, as he paid for Sabrina to attend Sutton Coldfield boarding school in Warwickshire early in 1771. She remained at the boarding school for three years, including weekends and holidays, with infrequent visits from Day. The school normally focused on preparing high society daughters for marriage, with subjects such as needlework and the arts. Day stipulated that she was to be taught academic subjects but should not <b>dance</b> <b>or</b> learn music.|$|E
5|$|Dearly Stars {{is a life}} {{simulation}} game {{in which}} the player assumes the role of one of three pop idols at a time: Ai Hidaka, Eri Mizutani or Ryō Akizuki. An idol's statistics are divided into three categories: vocal, dance and visual image. As these increase, an idol's overall image level will also increase. The game is largely divided into two modes: a story mode which encompasses normal gameplay, and a separate stage mode for performing songs outside of the story mode. At the start of every in-game week on Monday, the player is shown current popularity trends in vocal, dance and visual image ranked first, second and third in popularity. This gives the player a guide on how to gain popularity by augmenting an idol's statistics via the choice of song they will perform and what costumes they wear during an audition. Also on Monday, the player is first given the option to choose which costume and accessories to wear for performances, and to choose one of the available songs. Each costume, accessory and song have either a vocal, <b>dance</b> <b>or</b> visual attribute. The player can also modify the choreography and camera positioning used during performances at this time.|$|E

25|$|Vinyl is {{a better}} choice for other types of <b>dance</b> <b>or</b> more general {{community}} use. The requirements for different types of dance are different but the differences can mostly be accommodated by changes in the dance surface.

Ballroom dancing requires less traction than Scottish country dancing.|$|E

25|$|A sprung {{floor with}} a hard surface {{provides}} protection from serious injuries rather than minor injuries. A fall can still cause bruises. A soft performance surface {{on the other hand}} can provide protection from minor injuries but not serious injuries. Providing sufficient protection from serious injury for adults using a thick performance surface alone would render it unsuitable for most <b>dance</b> <b>or</b> sport. This is because a performance surface is point elastic whereas area elasticity as provided by a sprung floor is mainly preferred.|$|E
