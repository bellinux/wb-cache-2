As a string reverberates its length changes slightly as its edge touches the bridge, promoting the creation of overtones and giving the sound its distinctive tone. The maintenance of this specific tone by shaping the bridge is called jawari. Many musicians rely on instrument makers to adjust this.|$|E
25|$|Phosphine can {{be absorbed}} into the body by inhalation. Direct contact with {{phosphine}} liquid – although unlikely to occur – may cause frostbite, like other cryogenic liquids. The main target organ of phosphine gas is the respiratory tract. According to the 2009 U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) pocket guide, and U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulation, the 8 hour average respiratory exposure should not exceed 0.3 ppm. NIOSH recommends that the short term respiratory exposure to phosphine gas should not exceed 1ppm. The Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health level is 50ppm. Overexposure to phosphine gas causes nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, thirst, chest tightness, dyspnea (breathing difficulty), muscle pain, chills, stupor or syncope, and pulmonary edema. Phosphine {{has been reported to}} have the odor of decaying fish or garlic at concentrations below 0.3 ppm. The smell is normally restricted to laboratory areas or phosphine processing since the smell comes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> phosphine is extracted from the environment. However, it may occur elsewhere, such as in industrial waste landfills. Exposure to higher concentrations may cause olfactory fatigue.|$|E

Frank Provo of GameSpot criticized the game for its dull minigames and purely cosmetic Crash license, citing that [...] "apart <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> characters look {{and the way the}} Nitro boxes explode, [...] there isn't a whole lot that's Crash-like about Crash Boom Bang!". Nintendo Power recommended the game only to die-hard Crash fans and advised others to wait for Crash's next outing. Lesley Smith of Eurogamer criticized the game for a number or reasons, including bad stylus recognition, boring gameplay, terrible graphics and rigged, repetitive mini-games. IGN's review {{was one of the most}} scathing, dubbing Crash Boom Bang! [...] "a terrible, terrible game with poor organization" [...] and [...] "easily one of the worst games on the system". More middling reviews have come in from Official Nintendo Magazine, who felt the game was hampered by dodgy controls and a testing user interface, and Pocket Gamer's Jon Jordan, who dismissed the game's collection of minigames as [...] "distinctly average and oddly passionless".

It was used for the band to record Broken, an extended play (EP) that was the first release distributed by Nothing Records and reached the top 10 on the Billboard 200. In the liner notes, Reznor credited the 1991 Nine Inch Nails touring band as an influence on the EP's sound.

The inspiration for the harder sound came <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> live band played during concerts such as Lollapalooza.

500|$|Titan {{is likely}} {{differentiated}} into several layers with a [...] rocky center surrounded by several layers composed of different crystalline forms of ice.

[...] The Cassini probe discovered the evidence for the layered structure {{in the form of}} natural extremely-low-frequency radio waves in Titan's atmosphere.

500|$|In 2005 David Crane {{published}} a new Scott biography {{in which he}} comes to the conclusion that Scott is possibly the only figure in polar history except Lawrence Oates [...] "so wholly obscured by legend". According to Barczewski, he goes some way towards an assessment of Scott [...] "free from the baggage of earlier interpretations". What has happened to Scott's reputation, Crane argues, derives <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> world has changed since the [...] "hopeless heroism and obscene waste" [...] of the First World War. At the time of Scott's death, people clutched at the proof he gave that the qualities that once made Britain great were not extinct, but with the knowledge what lay only two years ahead, the ideals of duty, self-sacrifice, discipline, patriotism and hierarchy associated with his tragedy take on a different and more sinister colouring. Crane's main achievement, according to Barczewski, is the restoration of Scott's humanity, [...] "far more effectively than either Fiennes's stridency or Solomon's scientific data."

He later compared the ode with Wordsworth's [...] "Ode to Duty" [...] to declare that [...] "The Ode: Intimations, by contrast, rich in phrases that have entered the language and provided titles for other people's books, is Wordsworth's greatest achievement in rhythm and cadence. Together with Tintern Abbey it has always commanded attention as Wordsworth's strongest meditative poem and Wordsworth indicated his assessment of it by ensuring through the layout and printing of his volumes that the Ode stood apart." [...] In 1986, Marjorie Levinson searched for a political basis in many of Wordsworth's poems and argued that the ode, along with [...] "Michael", Peele Castle, and Tintern Abbey, are [...] "incontestably among the poet's greatest works". Susan Wolfson, in the same year, claimed that [...] "the force of the last lines arises <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> language in which the poet expresses a resolution of grief at the same time renders a metaphor that implies that grief has not been resolved so much as repressed and buried.

[...] After performing a Freudian-based analysis of the ode, William Galperin, in 1989, argues that [...] "Criticism, in short, cannot accept responsibility for The Excursions failings any more than it is likely to attribute the success of the 'Intimations Ode' to the satisfaction it offers in seeing a sense of entitlement, or self-worth, defended rather than challenged." ...|$|E
