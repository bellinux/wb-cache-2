40|$|Injection molding is a cyclic process, which {{consists}} of three stages: injection, packing-holding and cooling. To ensure the quality of molded parts, {{it is essential to}} control the key process variables for each phase. The literature review and industry experience suggest that <b>injection</b> <b>velocity</b> is the key variable to be controlled in the injection phase and nozzle pressure is the key variable to be controlled in the packing-holding phase. Experimental analysis confirms that the <b>injection</b> <b>velocity</b> and the packing pressure are non-linear and time-varying, which makes them difficult to be effectively controlled with a simple traditional controller. This research project shows that a fixed-parameters PI controller fails to effectively control the <b>injection</b> <b>velocity</b> during the injection phase. An adaptive self-tuning regulator (STR) is consequently designed based on a discrete-time dynamic model. It shows better performance than that of the PI controller. Techniques, such as the anti-windup estimation, adaptive feed-forward control and cycle-to-cycle adaptation, are incorporated to enhance the stability and response of the adaptive control system.
