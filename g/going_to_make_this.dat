Of the collaboration, Carey said [...] "He's angry with me because he thinks that I didn't allow him to do his mix, but really it's okay.

I mean, it is so dark, {{how are you going to}} handle this?" [...] Carter replied saying that Frank was a hero because he was able to [...] "stand-up" [...] against all of this. Henriksen was also worried about the dark [...] "feel" [...] of the show, saying that all shows needs some glimpse of light at the end of the tunnel. According to Carter [...] "The yellow house" [...] was the light, which Henriksen later agreed upon.|$|E

500|$|When {{designing}} {{the game from}} an artistic viewpoint, the team took various pieces of work as inspiration. Robert Polidori's photographs of Lower Ninth Ward following Hurricane Katrina were used as a reference point when {{designing the}} flooded areas of Pittsburgh. [...] " [...] did these amazingly beautiful, horrific photos... it's not just decay and rot and post-apocalyptic grey, it's a human world that we're playing with when we portray this destruction," [...] said Straley. The concept of post-apocalyptic environments was considered a [...] "starting point" [...] for the artists. The art team also strived to achieve realism within every piece of art. Straley explained that the artists [...] "would be like, I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>this</b> the most awesome fucking wall ever," [...] in terms of creating attractive environments. The art department were forced to fight for things that they wished to include, due to the high demand during development. Ultimately, the team settled on a balance between simplicity and detail; while Straley and Druckmann preferred the former, the art team preferred the latter. The artistic composition of the game's locations was also a feature strongly focused on, in order to evoke varying emotions from players. In the final weeks of development, roles from the art department were undertaken by {{other members of the}} team; for example, Straley hand-arranged the texts on the game's training screens, a task that lead artist Nate Wells found unusual. [...] "I have never even heard of a game director doing that! That's like... an intern task," [...] Wells said.|$|E
500|$|Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack Dawson: Cameron said {{he needed}} the cast to {{feel as though they}} were really on the Titanic, to relive its liveliness, and [...] "to take that energy and give it to Jack, [...] an artist who is able to have his heart soar". Jack is portrayed as an itinerant, poor orphan from Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, who has toured {{numerous}} places in the world, including Paris. He wins two tickets onto the RMS Titanic in a poker game and travels as a third-class passenger with his friend Fabrizio. He is attracted to Rose at first sight and meets her when she contemplates throwing herself off the stern of the ship. Her fiance's [...] "reward", an invitation to dine with them the next evening, enables Jack to mix with the first-class passengers for a night. When casting the role, various established actors, including Matthew McConaughey, Chris O'Donnell, Billy Crudup, and Stephen Dorff, were considered, but Cameron felt that a few of the actors were too old for the part of a 20-year-old. Tom Cruise was interested in portraying the character, but his asking price was too much for the studio to consider. Cameron considered Jared Leto for the role, but Leto refused to audition. DiCaprio, 21 years old at the time, was brought to Cameron's attention by casting director Mali Finn. Initially, {{he did not want to}} portray the character and refused to read his first romantic scene on the set (see below). Cameron said, [...] "He read it once, then started goofing around, and I could never get him to focus on it again. But for one split second, a shaft of light came down from the heavens and lit up the forest." [...] Cameron strongly believed in DiCaprio's acting ability and told him, [...] "Look, I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>this</b> guy brooding and neurotic. I'm not going to give him a tic and a limp and all the things you want." [...] Cameron rather envisioned the character as a James Stewart type. Although Jack Dawson was a fictional character, in Fairview Cemetery in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where 121 victims are buried, there is a grave labeled [...] "J. Dawson". The real J. Dawson was Joseph Dawson, who shoveled coal in the bowels of the ship. [...] "It wasn't until after the movie came out that we found out that there was a J. Dawson gravestone," [...] said the film's producer, Jon Landau, in an interview.|$|E

2500|$|Oberman {{described}} {{her work as}} [...] "A kind of Three Sisters via Woody Allen", reflecting the humour she saw in Chekhov's story. She expanded upon this personal connection in an article for The Guardian: [...] "Chekhov wrote about a world I recognised from my childhood – where intense pain is covered by bravura and humour, and where intense longing is masked by self-deprecation and wit. There was the same obsession with death, the same fierce familial loyalty, the same tendency toward melodrama – {{as well as a}} great passion for food." [...] After returning from Moscow, Oberman continued to work on her reinterpretation for the next 15 years, but lacked the confidence to take her project further.
