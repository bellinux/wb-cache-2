Both groups of foals and adult horses responded to the vaccine with a significant increase in vaccine-specific IgGa and IgG(T) concentrations. In contrast, only adult horses and 3 -month-old foals mounted significant vaccine-specific total IgG, IgGb, and IgM responses. Vaccine-specific concentrations of IgM and IgG(T) were significantly different between all groups, with the highest concentrations occurring in adult horses, followed by 3 -month-old foals and, finally, 3 -day-old foals. Only the adult horses mounted significant vaccine-specific lymphoproliferative responses. Baseline gamma interferon (IFN-) and interleukin- 4 (IL- 4) concentrations were significantly lower in 3 -day-old foals than in adult horses. Vaccination resulted in a significant decrease in IFN- concentrations in adult horses and a significant decrease in IL- 4 concentrations in 3 -day-old foals. After vaccination, the ratio of IFN-/IL- 4 in both groups of foals was significantly higher than that in adult horses.

Faecal shedding, changes in body weight, presence of local reactions and clinical symptoms, were evaluated. Serological assays for humoral and cell mediated immune response were determined by agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) and nitric oxide test (NO) respectively. A total of 76 serum samples, 52 faecal samples and 20 tissue samples were collected at different intervals during the study period. ZN staining; AGID test and nitric oxide test were employed for analysis of samples. Results: A total of 38 samples (37 faecal and 1 tissue sample) and 18 serum samples were recorded as positive by ZN staining and AGID test respectively from all four groups of mice. Significant decrease in faecal shedding of organisms was observed in Group I mice vaccinated with saponin <b>adjuvanted</b> <b>vaccine</b> in comparison to Group II.

Strategies to optimise responses to vaccination in the elderly include using an <b>adjuvanted</b> <b>vaccine</b> or using an intradermal vaccination route. The immunogenicity of an intradermal {{seasonal influenza}} vaccine was {{compared with that of}} an <b>adjuvanted</b> <b>vaccine</b> in the elderly. Methods Elderly volunteers (age ≥ 65 years) were randomised to receive a single dose of trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine: either a split-virion vaccine containing 15 μg haemagglutinin [HA]/strain/ 0. 1 -ml dose administered intradermally, or a subunit vaccine (15 μg HA/strain/ 0. 5 -ml dose) adjuvanted with MF 59 C. 1 and administered intramuscularly. Blood samples were taken before and 21 ± 3 days post-vaccination. Anti-HA antibody titres were assessed using haemagglutination inhibition (HI) and single radial haemolysis (SRH) methods. We aimed to show that the intradermal vaccine was non-inferior to the <b>adjuvanted</b> <b>vaccine.</b> Results A total of 795 participants were enrolled (intradermal vaccine n = 398; <b>adjuvanted</b> <b>vaccine</b> n = 397). Non-inferiority of the intradermal vaccine was demonstrated for the A/H 1 N 1 and B strains, but not for the A/H 3 N 2 strain (upper bound of the 95 % CI = 1. 53) using the HI method, and for all three strains by the SRH method. A post-hoc analysis of covariance to adjust for baseline antibody titres demonstrated the non-inferiority of the intradermal vaccine by HI and SRH methods for all three strains. Both vaccines were, in general, well tolerated; the incidence of injection-site reactions was higher for the intradermal (70. 1 %) than the <b>adjuvanted</b> <b>vaccine</b> (33. 8 %) but these reactions were mild and of short duration. Conclusions The immunogenicity and safety of the intradermal seasonal influenza vaccine in the elderly was comparable with that of the <b>adjuvanted</b> <b>vaccine.</b> Intradermal vaccination to target the immune properties of the skin appears to be an appropriate strategy to address the challenge of declining immune responses in the elderly.

We conducted a multicenter clinical trial to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of H 1 N 1 vaccine (Green Cross Co.) in young adults (18 to 64 years) and the elderly (> 65 years) using a two-dose regimen, with the doses administered 21 days apart. Three different regimens of hemagglutinin antigen were comparatively analyzed: 3. 75 g (MF 59 adjuvanted) versus 7. 5 g (MF 59 adjuvanted) versus 15 g (nonadjuvanted) in young adults and 3. 75 g (MF 59 adju-vanted) versus 7. 5 g (MF 59 adjuvanted) in the elderly. In young adults, all three vaccine regimens met the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (EMA) criteria after the first dose. In the elderly, on day 21 after the first dose, the rates of seroprotection and seroconversion were significantly higher for the 7. 5 -g dose of MF 59 <b>adjuvanted</b> <b>vaccine</b> than for the 3. 75 -g dose (58. 0 % versus 44. 3 % [P 0. 03] and 53. 7 % versus 37. 2 % [P < 0. 01], respectively).

40|$|Introduction In 2009 {{there was}} a {{pandemic}} of a new influenza virus: 2009 A (H 1 N 1) influenza virus. Pregnant women in the Netherlands were vaccinated against this virus with an <b>adjuvanted</b> <b>vaccine.</b> <b>Adjuvants</b> have proinflammatory properties that could theoretically induce preeclampsia in pregnant women. The safety of <b>adjuvanted</b> <b>vaccines</b> during pregnancy has not been tested in clinical trials. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the safety of <b>adjuvanted</b> <b>vaccines</b> during pregnancy by looking at the pregnancy outcome preeclampsia. The research question is: "Are pregnant women with preeclampsia more often vaccinated against 2009 A (H 1 N 1) influenza with an <b>adjuvanted</b> <b>vaccine</b> compared to pregnant women without preeclampsia?" Methods This was a retrospective case-control study. The study participants had all given birth in the UMCG and were pregnant at the time the vaccination took place: they gave birth after November 8, 2009 and were aterm before November 19, 2010. The women in the patient group were diagnosed with preeclampsia or HELLP during pregnancy. The women in the control group had had a normal pregnancy. Of the patient and control group demographic data, medical history, obstetric data, neonate data and data about vaccination were collected. In this study we examined the outcome variable preeclampsia/HELLP and the determinant vaccinated with 2009 A (H 1 N 1) influenza vaccination. Results There was no significant difference (p< 0. 05) between the patient and control group regarding the percentage vaccinated against 2009 A (H 1 N 1) influenza virus (p= 0. 611). Our study showed that within the preeclampsiagroup a higher percentage of patients with late preeclampsia/HELLP had been vaccinated, compared to women with early preeclampsia/HELLP. After correction for confounders it showed that 2009 A (H 1 N 1) influenza vaccination had no significant influence to preeclampsia/HELLP (p= 0. 644; odds ratio 1. 228; 95 % confidence interval 0. 514 - 2. 930) Conclusion In conclusion, pregnant women with preeclampsia were not more often vaccinated against 2009 A (H 1 N 1) influenza virus with an <b>adjuvanted</b> <b>vaccine</b> than pregnant women without preeclamspia. Within the preeclampsiapatientgroup there are indications that patients with late preeclampsia are more often vaccinated against 2009 A (H 1 N 1) influenza virus than patients with early preeclampsia. A study with a larger population could look into this specifically because this is a possible indication that a <b>vaccine</b> with an <b>adjuvant</b> that is given from the second trimester of pregnancy could have a potential effect on the pregnancy outcome preeclampsia. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe have {{established}} that the efficacy of a heterologous poxvirus vectored HIV vaccine, fowlpox virus (FPV) -HIV gag/pol prime followed by attenuated vaccinia virus (VV) -HIV gag/pol booster immunisation, is strongly influenced by the cytokine milieu at the priming vaccination site, with endogenous IL- 13 detrimental {{to the quality of}} the HIV specific CD 8 + T cell response induced. We have now developed a novel HIV vaccine that co-expresses a C-terminal deletion mutant of the mouse IL- 4, deleted for the essential tyrosine (Y 119) required for signalling. In our vaccine system, the mutant IL- 4 C 118 can bind to IL- 4 type I and II receptors with high affinity, and transiently prevent the signalling of both IL- 4 and IL- 13 at the vaccination site. When this IL- 4 C 118 <b>adjuvanted</b> <b>vaccine</b> was used in an intranasal rFPV/intramuscular rVV prime-boost immunisation strategy, greatly enhanced mucosal/systemic HIV specific CD 8 + T cells with higher functional avidity, expressing IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL- 2 and greater protective efficacy were detected. Surprisingly, the IL- 4 C 118 <b>adjuvanted</b> <b>vaccines</b> also induced robust long-lived HIV gag-specific serum antibody responses, specifically IgG 1 and IgG 2 a. The p 55 -gag IgG 2 a responses induced were of a higher magnitude relative to the IL- 13 Rα 2 <b>adjuvant</b> <b>vaccine.</b> More interestingly, our recently tested IL- 13 Rα 2 <b>adjuvanted</b> <b>vaccine</b> which only inhibited IL- 13 activity, even though induced excellent high avidity HIV-specific CD 8 + T cells, had a detrimental impact on the induction of gag-specific IgG 2 a antibody immunity. Our observations suggest that (i) IL- 4 cell-signalling in the absence of IL- 13 retarded gag-specific antibody isotype class switching, or (ii) IL- 13 Rα 2 signalling was involved in inducing good gag-specific B cell immunity. Thus, we believe our novel IL- 4 R antagonist adjuvant strategy offers great promise not only for HIV- 1 vaccines, but also against a range of chronic infections where sustained high quality mucosal and systemic T and B cell immunity are required for protection...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{determine}} which factors correlate directly with response to vaccination in such a group of subjects with non-protective HI antibody titers before vaccination. Two vaccines were used, a subunit virus <b>vaccine</b> <b>adjuvanted</b> with MF 59 and a split virus vaccine. The analysis indicated that immunization with <b>vaccine</b> <b>adjuvanted</b> with MF 59 was an independent variable for immune response against A/H 3 N 2 (OR: 3. 51; 95 % CI: 1. 81 - 6. 79) and B (OR: 2. 31; 95 % CI: 1. 37 - 3. 89). The results suggest that antibody response to vaccine is satisfactory in elderly people previously lacking a protective antibody titer, and that the <b>adjuvanted</b> <b>vaccine</b> reveals a better immunogenicity...|$|R
40|$|Leptospira borgpetersenii serovar hardjo is {{the most}} common cause of bovine {{leptospirosis}} and also causes zoonotic infections of humans. A protective killed vaccine against serovar hardjo was shown to induce strong antigen-specific proliferative responses by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from vaccinated cattle by 2 months after the first dose of vaccine. This response was absent from nonvaccinated control cattle. The mean response peaked by 2 months after completion of the two-dose vaccination regimen, and substantial proliferation was measured in in vitro cultures throughout the 7 months of the study period. Variations in magnitude of the response occurred among the vaccinated animals, but by 7 months postvaccination there was a substantial antigen-specific response with PBMC from all vaccinated animals. Up to one-third of the PBMC from vaccinated animals produced gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) after 7 days in culture with antigen, as ascertained by flow cytometric analysis, and significant levels of IFN-gamma were measured in culture supernatants by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Two-color immunofluorescence revealed that one-third of the IFN-gamma-producing cells were gammadelta T cells, with the remaining cells being CD 4 (+) T cells. The significance of this study is the very potent Th 1 -type immune response induced and sustained following vaccination with a <b>killed</b> bacterial <b>vaccine</b> <b>adjuvanted</b> with aluminum hydroxide and the involvement of gammadelta T cells in the response. Moreover, induction of this Th 1 -type cellular immune response is associated with the protection afforded by the bovine leptospiral vaccine against L. borgpetersenii serovar hardjo...|$|R

40|$|The recent {{introduction}} of oil-in-water emulsions as adjuvants in several pandemic vaccines, {{such as the}} H 1 N 1 vaccine, has challenged regulatory authorities to establish their safety in the general population, {{as well as in}} specific populations. Pregnant women were advised to be a target group for H 1 N 1 vaccination owing to the risk of this group developing serious complications with this infection. However, the addition of adjuvants to the H 1 N 1 vaccine has initiated a discussion on the safety of <b>adjuvanted</b> <b>vaccines</b> in this special population. Changes in the maternal immune system are essential for acceptance of the fetus and for development of the placenta. The potential effects on pregnancy of interfering with this uniquely adapted immune balance through the induction of proinflammatory reactions such as those induced by <b>adjuvanted</b> <b>vaccines</b> have only been studied rarely. Here, we review the available information and discuss how vaccination may interfere with pregnancy, fetal development and pregnancy outcomes...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{propensity}} for influenza viruses to mutate and recombine makes them both a familiar threat and a prototype emerging infectious disease. Emerging {{evidence suggests that}} the use of MF 59 -adjuvanted vaccines in older adults and young children enhances protection against influenza infection and reduces adverse influenza-attributable outcomes compared to unadjuvanted vaccines. The health and economic impact of such vaccines in the Canadian population are uncertain. METHODS: We constructed an age-structured compartmental model simulating the transmission of influenza in the Canadian population over a ten-year period. We compared projected health outcomes (quality-adjusted life years (QALY) lost), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for three strategies: (i) current use of unadjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccine; (ii) use of MF 59 -adjuvanted influenza vaccine adults ≥ 65 in the Canadian population, and (iii) <b>adjuvanted</b> <b>vaccine</b> used in both older adults and children aged < 6. RESULTS: In the base case analysis, use of <b>adjuvanted</b> <b>vaccine</b> in older adults was highly cost-effective (ICER = $ 2111 /QALY gained), but such a program was "dominated" by a program that extended the use of <b>adjuvanted</b> <b>vaccine</b> to include young children (ICER = $ 1612 /QALY). Results were similar whether or not a universal influenza immunization program was used in other age groups; projections were robust in the face of wide-ranging sensitivity analyses. INTERPRETATION: Based on the best available data, it is projected that replacement of traditional trivalent influenza vaccines with MF 59 -adjuvanted vaccines would confer substantial benefits to vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, and would be economically attractive relative to other widely-used preventive interventions...|$|R
40|$|We {{previously}} described that immunopotentiators, CVCVA 5, increased {{the efficacy of}} H 5 and H 9 subtype avian influenza vaccines in chickens, ducks, and geese. In this study, we further investigated {{the effects of the}} CVCVA 5 for improving the efficacy of other univalent or multivalent inactivated vaccines. The immune response administrated with half-dose of monovalent vaccine plus CVCVA 5 were higher than those of one dose of monovalent vaccine without immunopotentiators as measured by levels of antibodies from serum, tears and bronchoalveolar lavage fluids, and cytokines of IFNγ and IL- 4 from serum. Vaccines included the univalent vaccine of Newcastle Disease virus (ND), Egg Drop Syndrome virus (EDS), Infectious Bronchitis virus (IB), and Infectious Bursal Disease virus (IBD). The CVCVA 5 also improved the immune response of both ND and IBD vaccines with less dosage. The sterile protective immunity was monitored with one- or a half-dose of <b>adjuvanted</b> ND <b>vaccine</b> or one dose of <b>adjuvanted</b> IBD <b>vaccine,</b> respectively. The improved immune efficacy was observed in a half-dose of <b>adjuvanted</b> bivalent <b>vaccines</b> compared to one dose of vaccines without CVCVA 5 as measured by the antibody levels, including bivalent vaccine of ND-H 9, ND-IB, and ND-IBD. The CVCVA 5 also boosted the immune efficacy of the tetravalent vaccine (ND-IB-EDS-H 9). A half-dose of <b>adjuvanted</b> commercial <b>vaccine</b> or 75 % antigen-sparing <b>adjuvanted</b> <b>vaccine</b> elicited similar antibody levels to those of one dose non-adjuvanted commercial vaccines. The CVCVA 5 improved the effect of a booster vaccination as measured by the antibody levels against H 5 or H 9 virus antigens, in which chickens primed with the <b>adjuvanted</b> ND-IB <b>vaccines</b> given a booster with H 5 –H 9 bivalent vaccines without CVCVA 5 using 5 -day intervals. The inflammatory response may contribute to these additional effects by increasing the levels of IFNγ and IL- 4 after the injection of the <b>adjuvanted</b> ND-IB <b>vaccines.</b> Results indicated that the CVCVA 5 improved the serum and mucosal antibody levels, cytokine levels of the chickens given the univalent vaccine, and also improved serum antibody titers in bivalent and tetravalent vaccines. This has a potential as an improve vaccine...|$|R
40|$|In spring 2013, human infections {{with a novel}} avian {{influenza}} A (H 7 N 9) virus were reported in China. The number of cases has increased with over 200 mortalities reported to date. However, there is currently no vaccine available for the H 7 subtype of influenza A virus. Virus-specific cellular immune responses {{play a critical role}} in virus clearance during influenza infection. In this study, we undertook a side-by-side evaluation of two different adjuvants, Salmonella typhimurium flagellin (fliC) and polyethyleneimine (PEI), through intraperitoneal administration to assess their effects on the immunogenicity of the recombinant HA 1 - 2 subunit vaccine of H 7 N 9 influenza. The fusion protein HA 1 - 2 -fliC and HA 1 - 2 combined with PEI could induce significantly higher HA 1 - 2 -specific IgG and hemagglutination inhibition titers than HA 1 - 2 alone at 12 days post-boost, with superior HA 1 - 2 specific IgG titers in the HA 1 - 2 -fliC group compared with the PEI adjuvanted group. The PEI <b>adjuvanted</b> <b>vaccine</b> induced higher IgG 1 /IgG 2 a ratio and significantly increased numbers of IFN-γ- and IL- 4 -producing cells than HA 1 - 2 alone, suggesting a mixed Th 1 /Th 2 -type cellular immune response with a Th 2 bias. Meanwhile, the HA 1 - 2 -fliC induced higher IgG 2 a and IgG 1 levels, which is indicative of a mixed Th 1 /Th 2 -type profile. Consistent with this, significant levels, and equal numbers, of IFN-γ- and IL- 4 -producing cells were detected after HA 1 - 2 -fliC vaccination. Moreover, the marked increase in CD 69 expression and the proliferative index with the HA 1 - 2 -fliC and PEI <b>adjuvanted</b> <b>vaccines</b> indicated that both <b>adjuvanted</b> <b>vaccine</b> candidates effectively induced antigen-specific cellular immune responses. Taken together, our findings indicate that the two <b>adjuvanted</b> <b>vaccine</b> candidates elicit effective and HA 1 - 2 -specific humoral and cellular immune responses, offering significant promise for the development of a successful recombinant HA 1 - 2 subunit vaccine for H 7 N 9 influenza...|$|R

40|$|A highly efficacious {{vaccine is}} {{required}} to counteract a threat of an avian influenza pandemic. Increasing the potency of vaccines by adjuvation is essential not only to overcome generally low immunogenicity of pandemic strains, but also to allow dose sparing and as such to make it feasible to satisfy huge global production demands. In this study we evaluated the ability of four distinct adjuvants to further increase immune responses to a virosomal adjuvanted avian H 9 N 2 influenza vaccine in mice. Currently registered adjuvants aluminium phosphate, aluminium hydroxide and MF 59, {{as well as a}} novel promising adjuvant MATRIX-M were included in the study. Our results demonstrate that all adjuvants significantly increased the H 9 N 2 haemagglutinin (HA) inhibition and ELISA antibody titers induced with the virosomal <b>adjuvanted</b> <b>vaccine.</b> The <b>adjuvants</b> exhibited different effect on the isotype of virus specific antibodies, with MATRIX-M inducing the most pronounced skewing to IgG 2 a, i. e. towards Th 1 type of response. While the virosomal <b>adjuvanted</b> pandemic influenza <b>vaccine</b> efficiently induced CD 4 (+) T-cell response, with no further increase upon adjuvation, the CD 8 (+) T-cell responses induced with virosomal <b>adjuvanted</b> <b>vaccine</b> could be significantly improved upon additional adjuvation with MATRIX-M or MF 59. All adjuvants demonstrated a dose sparing effect, i. e. in combination with the virosomal <b>adjuvanted</b> pandemic influenza <b>vaccine</b> they increased immune responses to comparable level independent of the tested vaccine dose. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that immune responses to a virosomal <b>adjuvanted</b> pandemic influenza <b>vaccine</b> can be further enhanced by add-on adjuvants, with MATRIX-M being overall the most potent adjuvant in combination with virosomes, followed by MF 59 and finally aluminium-based adjuvant...|$|R
