Traditionally, it has been hypothesized that the digits lost were the two outermost digits, i.e. digits IV V), in a process known as Lateral Digit Reduction (LDR).|$|E

60|$|And to Shefford's amaze and admiration, she {{virtually}} {{walked up}} that almost perpendicular wall by slipping her <b>hands</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> rope and stepping {{as she pulled}} herself up.
