30|$|In {{carrying}} out the demands {{of higher education in}} view of information technology, an <b>e-Meeting</b> system is strongly requested rather than a typical learning management system (LMS) [7, 8]. An effective <b>e-Meeting</b> system requires primary features like online slide presentation, online annotation, chat messaging and video conferencing system. Although {{there are a lot of}} similar systems, but it is very rare to find an all-in-one system that really answer the need to support <b>e-Meeting</b> for higher education.|$|E

40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis examines different attributes of large scale group communication {{systems such as}} scalability, security and mobility by studying two different prototype systems - mIR (multicast Interactive Radio) and MES (Mobile <b>E-meeting</b> Services). mIR is a system for large scale real-time music distribution, designed as an interactive radio system for the Internet. MES {{is a collection of}} tools for improving the use of <b>e-meeting</b> and video conferencing tools in a mobile environment. The mIR prototype has been used to study scalability and security. Scalability in mIR concerns how to support as many users as possible without degrading the experience. This is achieved using IP multicast together with algorithms that limits the bandwidth usage regardless of the number of users. The work on security have focused on copy prevention through digital watermarking. By adding a unique watermark, i. e. a fingerprint, to each media copy a pirated copy {{can be traced back to}} a specific user, which can act as a deterrent. The thesis shows how we can combine the different goals of fingerprinting and IP-multicast while still maintaining the scalability features of multicast. Many issues need to be considered if e-meetings and video conferencing will become widespread and popular. Scalability and security, discussed in the first part of the thesis are two examples, and the second part of the thesis tries to address a third issue: mobility. In particular we are interested in enabling access to an <b>e-meeting</b> in a mobile environment, where we often have difficult conditions such as bad network connections, the user only have access to the Internet through a web browser or the available devices are small and limited. In many cases it is currently impossible to participate in an <b>e-meeting</b> when you're not in the office. The prototype system developed in the second part of the thesis aims to enable participation from any location and device that have some sort of Internet connection. We try to achieve this by allowing a mobile user to access an <b>e-meeting</b> session from a web browser or from a Java enabled mobile phone. Further, the system makes it possible to review missed events in an <b>e-meeting</b> as it is likely that there are many times where no Internet connection at all is available. The general style of work has been prototype driven with a goal of creating usable prototypes - i. e. the prototypes should be easy to deploy and it should be possible to use and test the prototypes daily. Most the prototypes described in this thesis have indeed been deployed and have seen daily use. Godkänd; 2005; 20061004 (ysko) </p...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{highlights}} the computational power of swarming models (i. e., stigmergic mechanisms) to build collaborative support systems for complex cognitive {{tasks such as}} facilitation of group decision processes (GDP) in <b>e-meetings.</b> Unlike traditional approaches that minimize the cognitive complexity by incorporating the facilitation knowledge into the system, stigmergic coordination mechanisms minimize the complexity by providing the system with emergent functionalities that are shaped by the environment itself through the possibility to structure {{it in terms of}} high-level cognitive artefacts. This is illustrated by conducting a socio-simulation experiment for an envisioned collaborative software tool that acts as a stigmergic environment for modelling the GDP. The results show superior results when the users are allowed to increase the representational complexity of a GDP model with cognitive artefacts that support guidance and action in the conceptual problem space...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the problems of}} how to design scalable, robust, and distributed real-time media applications for the Internet. An agent based framework for solving this problem is presented. The framework promotes several important design requirements such as modularity and reusability of software modules, remote management of applications, adaptiveness, robustness, accessibility, symmetry {{and the most important}} scalability. The issue of scalability is examined on several levels including data-distribution, different end-user platforms, scalability of real-time media flows, bandwidth adaption and scalability of sessions. The design of the framework is based on the important concept of IP-multicast, which allows for scalable distribution of data on the Internet. How this decision has influenced the design of the framework is examined in the thesis. The design of the framework have been verified by building a reference implementation in Java and building a number of high-level end-user applications for real-time <b>e-meetings,</b> e-learning (net-based learning) and social awareness via the e-corridor.

40|$|In {{the modern}} world where many {{companies}} and groups are distributed {{there is a strong}} need for tools that support distributed work, yet very few companies actually use more than phones and email for their daily collaborative work. If they need to meet physically, they travel long distances wasting resources in the form of time, money on travel, pollution from their transports and mostly they are not available for interaction with their other colleagues. The latter creates stress for both the traveler and the persons in her/his organization that need to interact with the traveler to get their work done as smoothly as possible. At the same time the need for distributed work increases with the possibility for having work forces distributed over large geographical areas. Employees work more from their home and on the road today than they did just a decade ago and personal experience show that allowing employees to work in a more relaxed environment as their home minimizes stress symptoms, and increases life quality. One such support tool is <b>e-meetings</b> where users can interact in real-time using high-quality audio, video, text chat, shared whiteboard, shared applications and co-web browsing.

40|$|A {{preliminary}} {{study of the}} use of net-based meetings in learning across Sweden was carried out on behalf of the Swedish Net University Agency in co-operation with Sunet (Swedish University Computer Network). The goal {{of this study was to}} record, from a user perspective, the best practices in the area of net-based meetings from Sweden s universities and colleges. The {{preliminary study}} was undertaken during 2005 as a co-operation between The Centre for Distance-spanning technology at Luleå University of Technology (coordinator), Mid Sweden University, Umeå University and University of Trollhättan/Uddevalla. The starting point for the preliminary study was that existing learning management systems, often used by e. g. higher education, only support asynchronous communication. With today s computers and available broadband access it is much easier to provide support for real-time, synchronous communication. Each student can sit at home using her own computer and communicate over the Internet in real-time with teachers and other students. Until recently synchronous-tools for learning were not commonly used in higher education in Sweden, but there are good examples to be found. The preliminary study started with a questionnaire that was sent out to universities and colleges across Sweden. 124 replies were received and from these replies a number of teachers were chosen to be interviewed to gain a deeper insight into their use of net-based meetings in learning. It resulted in 13 interviews submitted to Sunet s service www. meetings. sunet. se, for management, updating and further development. The Sunet service for net-based meetings is focused on getting personnel and students who are connected to Sunet to use the net for meetings. Some examples of best-practices are: Without <b>E-meetings</b> we couldn't have held "remote labs" A complete teacher training course through distance learning English for the manufacturing industry Best-practice in details [URL] The preliminary study also resulted in the suggestion of four different development areas to increase the usage of net-based meetings for educational purposes: o Disseminate information on the usage of net-based meetings, o Stimulate the development of more good examples, o Establish a network of experts/interest within the Swedish Net University Agency and o Evaluate student-experience a workshop, to be arranged by the Swedish Net University Agency together with SUNET and the Swedish society for e-competence (REK) among others. [URL] To summarize the study, we see that net-based meetings as a phenomenon driven by early adopters are becoming more and more used by the early and late majority 1. This should mean that we only have seen the beginning of many innovative and useful ways {{of the use of}} net-based meetings in higher education. We believe it is an absolute necessity to cooperate at both national and international level to better understand technology-supported learning and to strengthen the development of new methods and technical solutions to be used in higher education...|$|R

30|$|In this paper, the {{development}} of a shared virtual presentation board (VPB) for real-time <b>e-Meeting</b> on the Web-based e-Learning System (WebELS) platform is introduced. WebELS is a general-purpose e-Learning system to support flexibility and globalization of higher education in science and technology. In WebELS, the Meeting module consists of online presentation and video conference system, and the combination of both allows the creation of a so-called virtual room for <b>e-Meeting</b> applications where participants convene via the Internet. Online presentation features synchronized slide control between the presenter and the listeners for slide changing, scrolling, zooming, cursor positioning, and playback control for video embedded on the slide. It also features online annotation that allows the presenter to write using a pen function on the slide display panel. The system has video conferencing function that provides an audio-video communication among the meeting participants. This paper discusses briefly the video conference system, and focuses on online presentation based on slide-based synchronization and {{the development}} of VPB. VPB is a shared object that resides on the server that is updated every time the presenter client makes mouse events and is periodically accessed by client system in order that listener’s presentation viewer synchronized with that of the presenter.|$|E

In a {{world of}} {{ubiquitous}} media resources, such as cameras, displays, microphones, provided by {{a wide variety of}} multimedia systems, {{there is a need for}} automatic resource selection which seamlessly utilizes the best available communication tool from a user perspective. This paper therefore presents an algorithm which uses context-awareness to support automatic media resource selection. The algorithm takes advantage of an abstract classification of privacy, quality, and cost in order to compare media resources to user’s preferences. As a proof of concept implementation, the algorithm has been incorporated into an <b>e-meeting</b> application called Marratech. ...|$|E
30|$|The {{advantage}} of screen sharing technique is that presenter can show various applications on his desktop {{and be seen}} by other participants. In view of <b>e-Meeting</b> however, presenter {{have to be careful}} that sensitive information is not displayed as it can be visible to other meeting participants. Another drawback of screen-sharing technology is the reduced graphic quality that small text cannot be easily read or small objects cannot be easily recognized. Screen sharing technique works well in broadband, but may not operate well in narrowband as it utilizes greater bandwidth for transmitting of encoded pixel data of screen image. Bandwidth demand gets very high if {{there is a lot of}} pixel change at a short time, such as when scrolling a window or showing animated presentation may take several seconds to completely display the image at remote site. Another major drawback of screen sharing is that it requires advanced network address translation (NAT), firewall and router configuration such as port forwarding in order for the connection to go through. Other systems are also limited to peer-to-peer connection, and does not support multi-user. Since it is not a web-based system, it is necessary to download and install the software before screen sharing can start up. Some screen sharing systems have an integrated support to Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) or teleconferencing (telephone) to realize an <b>e-Meeting.</b> But others do not have and users have to use other VoIP system.|$|E

30|$|With VPB concept {{implemented}} on a content-based meeting system {{such as the}} WebELS Meeting, high-quality <b>e-Meeting</b> {{performance can}} be achieved. Meetings proceedings would not be interrupted by necessary on-the-fly uploading of content for presentation, since content must be pre-uploaded before a virtual meeting room is created. Because of this, the system is also suitable for distributing live presentation of the conference proceedings to remote viewers. Moreover, slide images are pre-downloaded on the users’ local computer, thus there is no blurry and distorted slide presentation images. Online presentation can be attained smoothly because slide synchronization delay is minimized due to minimal VPB data that is shared between users and the server. More online presentation features are showcased, such as slide synchronization, cursor synchronization, freehand annotation function, zooming function, and embedded video playback. Moreover, the system works well in narrowband Internet {{as well as in}} a cloud environment.|$|E
