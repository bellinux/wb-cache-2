5|$|Current {{research}} suggests that the primary method of infection in animals is through ingestion. It <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> prions may be deposited in the environment through the remains of dead animals and via urine, saliva, and other body fluids.

5000|$|It has <b>been</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> {{if someone}} <b>is</b> {{deficient}} in vitamin B12 and folic acid, the vitamin B12 deficiency {{must be treated}} first. However, modern research says ″Although it <b>was</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> folic acid might exacerbate vitamin B12 deficiency and its symptoms, it is probably not the case″.

5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> {{the total}} amount of iridium in the planet Earth is much higher than that {{observed}} in crustal rocks, but as with other platinum-group metals, the high density and tendency of iridium to bond with iron caused most iridium to descend below the crust when the planet was young and still molten.|$|E
5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> the toy spaniels that {{eventually}} became the King Charles Spaniel {{originated in the}} Far East, primarily Japan. They may share a common ancestry with the Pekingese and Japanese Chin. Toy spaniels were given as gifts to European royalty.|$|E

50|$|Through the Middle Ages another {{cause of}} {{dramatic}} symptoms could be found: possession.

5|$|The exact {{prevalence}} of obesity hypoventilation syndrome is unknown, and it <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> many people with symptoms of OHS have not been diagnosed.

5|$|A steel corset in the Stibbert Museum, Florence, Italy, is {{dated to}} the mid-16th century, and {{thought to be}} similar to the metal stays {{recorded}} as having been made by a corazzaio mastro (master armour-maker) for Eleanor of Toledo and delivered to her on 28 February 1549. However, as Eleanor's wardrobe records do not list any boned or stiffened corsets, it <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> her steel bodice was designed for medical or therapeutic reasons rather than worn as a fashionable garment.|$|E
5|$|After the Norman Conquest of 1066, {{the manor}} of Clevedon was {{granted by the}} King to Matthew de Mortagne, who in turn granted it to his sub-tenant, Hildebert. It <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> Sir John was a {{descendant}} of either Matthew or Hildebert. Perhaps because of {{the distance to the}} parish church, the manor house included a chapel dedicated, in the 1320s, to Saint Peter. The house has undergone considerable change since it was built, almost every century seeing structural alterations, but it still retains many features of a mediaeval manor house.|$|E
