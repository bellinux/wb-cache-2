40|$|Abstracts: This paper {{discusses}} {{the development of}} local loop unbundling in telecommunications markets throughout the European Union. It elaborates on the regulatory framework in Europe and {{provides an overview of}} recent experiences in Europe. Different types of unbundling, allowing for different types of entry and services provided by entrants, are discussed. This paper also explores the challenges for policy and regulation that arise because of unbundling and recent, related technological developments in the markets for <b>fixed</b> <b>voice</b> <b>telephony</b> and broadband internet access, particularly the emergence of packet-switched telephony such as VoIP...|$|E
40|$|In {{this first}} report the {{committee}} recommends major changes to telecommunications policy and legislation to ensure ongoing equitable access to broadband, mobile and <b>fixed</b> <b>voice</b> <b>telephony</b> and payphones across the country, and particularly {{for individuals and}} businesses in regional, rural and remote parts of Australia. The existing legislative and regulatory arrangements for universal service are increasingly strained by the importance of mobile telephony and broadband services, the privatisation of Telstra, and the ongoing development of a competitive telecommunications market. With the significant changes likely to occur from the Australian government?s proposed National Broadband Network (NBN) there is now an opportunity to revolutionise the availability and quality of telecommunications services in this country, including all of regional Australia. The committee?s proposals {{are based on the}} belief that competitive markets are best able to deliver telecommunications services. Government interventions should be limited to where this is necessary to ensure service availability...|$|E
40|$|The {{telecommunications}} industry {{is the key}} {{industry of the future}} and, not surprisingly, governments, researchers and investors alike are paying it significant attention. In recent decades the {{telecommunications industry}} has been characterised by changes in every aspect of the sector. These changes have already transformed the way people work and live, and will also influence people's lives in the future (BLONSKI, 2002, pp. 1 - 2). Changes seen in the telecommunications industry include technology advances, as well as changes to market structure. As for technology changes, we should stress the importance of digitalisation, which has led to the launch of new products and convergence between information technologies and telecommunications. On the other hand, the monopoly structure involving one telephone company has been transformed into a structure of different, competing companies. All of these changes have been accompanied by legislative and regulatory developments and the expansion of independent national regulatory agencies (CAVE et al., 2002, p. 3). Slovenia has embarked on the path to liberalising the telecommunications market, including the gradual introduction of related new legislation. In Slovenia the liberalisation of telecommunications started relatively late compared to other EU countries. The monopoly over <b>fixed</b> <b>voice</b> <b>telephony</b> was formally abolished at the beginning of 2001. Furthermore, an independent regulator (ATRP 1) was established {{in the second half of}} 2001. This paper consequently aims to analyse the (de) regulation and liberalisation of telecommunications in Slovenia and its This paper is based on the first report of the project "Monitoring the effects of regulation i...|$|E
40|$|We {{estimate}} own-price elasticities for <b>fixed</b> network <b>voice</b> <b>telephony</b> {{access and}} (national) calls services for private users and cross-price elasticities to mobile using time series data from 2002 - 2007 from the Austrian market. Using instrumental variable estimates and {{taking into account}} the possibility of cointegration we find that access is inelastic while calls are elastic. We conclude that the retail market for national calls of private users can probably be deregulated due to sufficient competitive pressure from mobile. Access-substitution on the other hand {{does not seem to be}} strong enough to justify de-regulation. Keywords...|$|R
50|$|Since the {{fixed-line}} {{voice communication}} monopoly ended on January 1, 2003, several companies entered {{the market for}} <b>fixed</b> <b>voice</b> communication services: Aeronavigācijas serviss, Baltcom TV, Beta Telecom, Latvenergo Tehniskais Centrs, OPTRON, Rigatta, Telecentrs, Telenets, Telekom Baltija and CSC Telecom. These <b>voice</b> <b>telephony</b> providers provide services for cheaper foreign calls, {{as well as local}} calls. The telecom regulator SPRK tries to provide a competitive environment so that new operators can compete with Lattelecom which owns most of the last-mile connections.|$|R
40|$|<b>Voice</b> <b>telephony</b> is the {{predominant}} service on today’s cellular mobile networks, {{in terms of}} number of customers, revenues and network usage. However, {{it is difficult to}} predict how long this will be the case given the rising demand for new Internet multimedia services. It is therefore essential that 3 rd generation (3 G) mobile networks support a <b>voice</b> <b>telephony</b> service, but also that these networks are also capable of providing Internet multimedia services using the same technology. This paper provides an overview of how <b>voice</b> <b>telephony</b> is provided in the initial phase of the universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS). It then describes how this is expected to evolve in later phases — so that <b>voice</b> <b>telephony</b> becomes one {{of a large number of}} multimedia services provided from a common Internet protocol-based mobile network. 1...|$|R

5000|$|In {{order to}} use Broadband Internet {{services}} simultaneously with <b>voice</b> <b>telephony,</b> {{it is necessary}} to use a DSL filter. This is a low pass filter in line with the phone outlet. This prevents high frequency data noise from affecting the lower frequency voice bandwidth and it also prevents the low impedance of the connected phone from attenuating or modulating the high speed DSL data Path. Enough bandwidth is retained for <b>voice</b> <b>telephony</b> and the majority is used for high speed data.|$|R

40|$|The last 30 {{years have}} seen huge {{technological}} and commercial developments {{in the field of}} telecommunications. The main product of the telecommunications industry has until recently been <b>voice</b> <b>telephony.</b> With the growth of data and multimedia services in the last decade the role of <b>voice</b> <b>telephony</b> is changing. In recent years telecommunications manufacturers have begun producing and marketing a new network concept for voice services entitled Next Generation Networks (NGN). These networks are based on packet switching technology as opposed to the circuit switching technology traditionally used in <b>voice</b> <b>telephony.</b> And telecom carriers like BT are replacing their Circuit switch based PSTN equipments by packet switching based Next Generation Networks products. Therefore in this study analysis and observation have been done of that process of migration from PSTN to IP/MPLS. Only BT has fully in progress for this migration through their 21 Century Network Project up till now and layout their plan for broadband dial tone to every customer till 2009.
