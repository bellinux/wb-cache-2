WeBOC has proved itself as a dependable and established product of international standing. As compared to previous system (One Customs - processing on computer along with manual processing on hard copies), WeBOC provides an opportunity to file <b>Goods</b> <b>Declaration</b> on line after attaching scanned documents, if required. The system calculates the quantum of duty and taxes on the spot and generates a message to the filer to deposit the same, which can be paid online (through Personal Deposit account facility).|$|E

The Layout Key facilitates the exchange of information between the various parties involved in a commercial transaction and is {{used as the basis}} for many key trade documents such as the European Union’s Single Administrative Document (SAD); FIATA’s Freight Forwarding Instruction; UNECE’s Dangerous Goods Declaration; and the World Customs Organization (WCO) <b>Goods</b> <b>Declaration</b> for Export. Use of the UN Layout Key is specifically recommended in the WCO’s Revised Kyoto Convention.

50|$|The {{conceptualization}} {{of a new}} home grown system was started few years back by the department. The new software was named e-Customs. The basic modules of GD filing, examination, clearance and associated jobs were tested. Two customs clearing agents were selected who volunteered to file some <b>Goods</b> <b>Declarations</b> (GD) through the new system. At that time machine number was allocated on filing of GD. Some processes were completed manually, as well. Besides testing the system, actual clearance was made on hard copy of GD after manual checking.|$|R

They are surveilled by video and temporary checks.|$|R
50|$|The {{paperless}} {{computer system}} has substantially curtailed processing period which has in turn reduced {{cost of doing}} business. This has not only simplified a number of procedures, but also brought transparency (less interaction with the customs staff) and certainly more revenues for the exchequer. Needless to mention that in the redundant system each bill of entry (<b>goods</b> <b>declaration)</b> for imports required 34 signatures & 62 verifications. Furthermore, multiple copies and numerous mandatory documents were required to be attached with the GD. All these documents were carried from desk to desk by the importer. For shipping lines various documents had to be submitted to many customs offices. Several customs offices {{were involved in the}} process {{depending on the type of}} GD i.e., imports, temporary imports, exports, warehousing, baggage etc.|$|E
5000|$|... 2) The International Convention on the Simplification and Harmonization of Customs {{procedures}} (revised Kyoto Convention or RKC) {{was originally}} adopted in 1974 and was subsequently revised in 1999; the revised Kyoto Convention came into force in 2006. The RKC comprises several key governing principles: transparency and predictability of customs controls; standardization and simplification of the <b>goods</b> <b>declaration</b> and supporting documents; simplified procedures for authorized persons; maximum {{use of information}} technology; minimum necessary customs control to ensure compliance with regulations; use of risk management and audit based controls; coordinated interventions with other border agencies; and {{a partnership with the}} trade. It promotes trade facilitation and effective controls through its legal provisions that detail the application of simple yet efficient procedures and also contains new and obligatory rules for its application. The WCO revised Kyoto Convention is sometimes confused with the Kyoto Protocol, which is a protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC or FCCC).|$|E
5000|$|Federal Board of Revenue (previously Central Board of Revenue) {{established}} a company for automation, namely Systems Limited in 1988. Processing was completed on IBM system-34 machine. There were standalone systems in every Collectorate. <b>Goods</b> <b>Declaration</b> (then called B/E - bill of entry) was submitted and a machine number was allocated manually. For this purpose a register was maintained. Data, regarding value {{was used to}} be given by the computer operator {{in the form of}} an assessment sheet (at this stage some customs brokers managed to get values of their choice as values could be maneuvered by the computer operator). The print out of the sheet was attached with the bill of entry (B/E) and sent to the group in routine. After completion of B/E and out of customs charge, manual feeding in the computer system was done by KPOs of Computer Bureau through batch processing. [...] In December, 1992 computer processing (online processing) of bill of entries was started in Appraisement Collectorate. Between 1992 and 1999 feeding of hard copies of B/Es in the computer was done by the KPOs of import section. A running number was allocated to B/Es by the computer, which was manually affixed on the B/E. Assessment was used to be made in the relevant groups and simultaneously entry was recorded in the computer. The system automatically calculated duty. A batch of eight bills of entry was forwarded to the bank with a summary. The bank verified that summary with pay orders which they received. Account section was responsible to make consignments out of customs charge after satisfying that all the taxes and duties are paid in the national exchequer.|$|E

40|$|Business {{views on}} the most {{important}} barriers to trade facilitation are taken from two region-wide surveys in 2006 covering the ASEAN priority integration sectors, namely: agro-based, fisheries, automotive, electronics, e-ASEAN, healthcare, rubber, textile and apparel, wood-based, air travel, tourism, and logistics. The data were reassembled into (1) border procedures, (2) individual barriers, (3) broad categories of barriers, and the results ranked in terms of incidence and significance. Border procedures such as unofficial facilitation fees, tedious <b>goods</b> <b>declaration,</b> poor information on procedures, difficult release of goods, and complex refund and appeals process were the most widespread and serious. Logistics businesses were similarly affected by lengthy documentation, burdensome inspection, varying goods nomenclature, facilitation fees, poor regional coordination, and inefficient clearance. Across all types of barriers, for the goods sector, Customs procedures and their manner of implementation were prevalent, while quantity control measures, official and unofficial fees, and technical standards were significant. For the services sector, the operator's licensing requirement was the most common and severe, while high excise taxes, user fees, lengthy visa procedures, and market limits were further impediments. Logistics operators confirmed the singular importance of Customs procedures particularly time consuming documentation, followed by foreign ownership and transport-specific limitations. Time and monetary costs of complying were substantial.

50|$|Hirsch {{states that}} current Republicans focus solely on {{rights of the}} individual, quite {{divorced}} from their responsibilities as citizens and from {{the rights of others}} and the common <b>good.</b> Since the <b>Declaration</b> states {{that all men are created}} equal and all have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, the system can only work if one says that each person has this liberty so long as it does not harm others or impinge on the rights of others. This last proposition is in fact the basis for all government laws and regulation, whether of individuals or corporations.|$|R
50|$|On 27 December 2013, at the {{conclusion}} of a five-day religious seminar (Nadwo) hosted by the Al-Minhaj Islamic organization at the Haji Ali Mosque in Garowe, 15 prominent local Islamic scholars signed a 21-point declaration on the upcoming 2014 Puntland elections. The agreement was intended to inform prospective holders of public office about their duties and the trust conferred upon them as civil servants. Among other things, it reminded the presidential contenders that they should campaign responsibly, avoid making unrealistic or false promises, uphold Puntland's previous agreements, policies and legislations that did not contravene Islamic principles, acknowledge the election result, and aim to work in the public interest. The scholars also encouraged the Titled Elders (Issimo) to work together in accordance with their acknowledged role as an authority in Puntland, and urged the public toward piety and unity. Additionally, the declaration reminded the Vetting Committee members of their public duties, and called on the would be legislators to work for the greater <b>good.</b> The <b>declaration</b> concluded by highlighting the responsibilities that would be expected of the new leaders in the Puntland government.|$|R
60|$|He, therefore, first {{requesting}} Mr Pancks {{to remember}} his voluntary declaration that his proprietor had {{no part in}} the disclosure, and that his own intentions were <b>good</b> (two <b>declarations</b> which that coaly little gentleman with the greatest ardour repeated), openly told him that as to the Dorrit lineage or former place of habitation, he had no information to communicate, and that {{his knowledge of the}} family did not extend beyond the fact that it appeared to be now reduced to five members; namely, to two brothers, of whom one was single, and one a widower with three children. The ages of the whole family he made known to Mr Pancks, as nearly as he could guess at them; and finally he described to him the position of the Father of the Marshalsea, and the course of time and events through which he had become invested with that character. To all this, Mr Pancks, snorting and blowing in a more and more portentous manner as he became more interested, listened with great attention; appearing to derive the most agreeable sensations from the painfullest parts of the narrative, and particularly to be quite charmed by the account of William Dorrit's long imprisonment.|$|R
6000|$|It is thus {{seen that}} the assault upon and {{reduction}} of Fort Sumter was in no sense a matter of self-defense {{on the part of}} the assailants. They well knew that the garrison in the fort could by no possibility commit aggression upon them. They knew--they were expressly notified--that the giving of bread to the few brave and hungry men of the garrison was all which would on that occasion be attempted, unless themselves, by resisting so much, should provoke more. They knew that this government desired to keep the garrison in the fort, not to assail them, but merely to maintain visible possession, and thus to preserve the Union from actual and immediate dissolution--trusting, as hereinbefore stated, to time, discussion, and the ballot-box for final adjustment; and they assailed and reduced the fort for precisely the reverse object--to drive out the visible authority of the Federal Union, and thus force it to immediate dissolution. That this was their object the executive well understood; and having said to them in the inaugural address, [...] "You can have no conflict without being yourselves the aggressors," [...] he took pains not only to keep this <b>declaration</b> <b>good,</b> but also to keep the case so free from the power of ingenious sophistry that the world should not be able to misunderstand it. By the affair at Fort Sumter, with its surrounding circumstances, that point was reached. Then and thereby the assailants of the government began the conflict of arms, without a gun in sight or in expectancy to return their fire, save only the few in the fort sent to that harbor years before for their own protection, and still ready to give that protection in whatever was lawful. In this act, discarding all else, they have forced upon the country the distinct issue, [...] "immediate dissolution or blood." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{leader is}} a very {{different}} stamp of person. He stands well abreast of his contemporaries, and just half a pace in front of them; and he has power to persuade even the inertia of humanity into taking that one half-step in advance he himself has already made bold to adventure. His post is honoured, respected, remunerated. But the prophet gets no thanks, and perhaps does mankind no benefit. He sees too quick. And there can be very little good indeed in so seeing. If one of us had been an astronomer, and had discovered the laws of Kepler, Newton, and Laplace in the thirteenth century, I think he would have been wise to keep the discovery to himself for a few hundred years or so. Otherwise, he would have been burned for his trouble. Galileo, long after, tried part of the experiment a decade or so too soon, and got no good by it. But in moral and social matters the danger is far graver. I would say to every aspiring youth who sees some political or economical or ethical truth quite clearly: [...] "Keep it dark! Don't mention it! Nobody will listen to you; and you, who are probably a person of superior insight and higher moral aims than the mass, will only destroy your own influence for <b>good</b> by premature <b>declarations.</b> The world will very likely come round of itself to your views in the end; but if you tell them too soon, you will suffer for it in person, and will very likely do nothing to help on the revolution in thought that you contemplate. For thought that is too abruptly ahead of the mass never influences humanity." ...|$|R
60|$|Evolution in geology leads up {{naturally}} to {{evolution in the}} science of life. If the world itself grew, why not also the animals and plants that inhabit it? Already in the eager active eighteenth century this obvious idea had struck in the germ {{a large number of}} zoologists and botanists, and in the hands of Lamarck and Erasmus Darwin it took form as a distinct and elaborate system of organic evolution. Buffon had been the first to hint at the truth; but Buffon was an eminently respectable nobleman in the dubious days of the tottering monarchy, and he did not care personally for the Bastille, viewed as a place of permanent residence. In Louis Quinze's France, indeed, as things then went, a man who offended the orthodoxy of the Sorbonne was prone to find himself shortly ensconced in free quarters, and kept there for the term of his natural existence without expense to his heirs or executors. So Buffon did not venture to say outright that he thought all animals and plants were descended one from the other with slight modifications; that would have been wicked, and the Sorbonne would have proved its wickedness to him in a most conclusive fashion by promptly getting him imprisoned or silenced. It is so easy to confute your opponent when you are a hundred strong and he is one weak unit. Buffon merely said, therefore, that if we didn't know the contrary to be the case by sure warrant, we might easily have concluded (so fallible is our reason) that animals always varied slightly, and that such variations, indefinitely accumulated, would suffice to account for almost any amount of ultimate difference. A donkey might thus have grown into a horse, and a bird might have developed from a primitive lizard. Only we know it was quite otherwise! A quiet hint from Buffon was as <b>good</b> as a <b>declaration</b> from many less knowing or suggestive people. All over Europe, the wise took Buffon's hint for what he meant it; and the unwise blandly passed it by as a mere passing little foolish vagary of that great ironical writer and thinker.|$|R
