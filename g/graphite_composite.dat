Effect of the processing parameters on the wear resistance and the compression strength of the composites were studied. Three compaction pressures (150, 250, and 350 MPa) and three sintering temperatures (900, 950, and 1000 oC) were applied. Lead or zinc with 0. 5, 1, and 1. 5 wt. % of was mixed with (copper/ 2. 5 or 5 wt. % <b>graphite</b> <b>composites)</b> which give good values of hardness, compressive strength and wear resistance. The wear testing was carried out using a pin-on-disc wear tester. Vickers hardness measurements were used to investigate the hardness of the products. For copper <b>graphite</b> <b>composites,</b> increase of compaction pressure and sintering temperature increased the relative density of both green and sintered parts which increases the mechanical properties. At low graphite contents (0 to 5 wt %) the copper particles were coherent. So, the wear resistance increases. and with increasing amount of graphite, particles of graphite work as insulation to the particles of copper, so the mechanical properties and wear resistance were reduced. Improvement in the mechanical properties and wear resistance was observed when adding 0. 5, 1, 1. 5 wt % of lead or zinc to copper- graphite (cu+ 2. 5 or 5 wt% <b>graphite)</b> <b>composites.</b> 1...|$|R
