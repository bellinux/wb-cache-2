5|$|Although {{hostilities}} {{existed between}} the Mam and the K'iche' of Q'umarkaj after the rebellion of the Kaqchikel people against their K'iche' allies, {{the arrival of the}} Spanish conquistadors shifted the political landscape. Conquistador Pedro de Alvarado <b>described</b> <b>how</b> the Mam king Kayb'il B'alam was received with great honour in Q'umarkaj.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{electric}} and magnetic field formulation {{there are four}} equations. The two inhomogeneous equations <b>describe</b> <b>how</b> the fields vary in space due to sources. Gauss's law <b>describes</b> <b>how</b> electric fields emanate from electric charges. Gauss's law for magnetism describes magnetic fields as closed field lines not due to magnetic monopoles. The two homogeneous equations <b>describe</b> <b>how</b> the fields [...] "circulate" [...] around their respective sources. Ampère's law with Maxwell's addition <b>describes</b> <b>how</b> the magnetic field [...] "circulates" [...] around electric currents and time varying electric fields, while Faraday's law <b>describes</b> <b>how</b> {{the electric}} field [...] "circulates" [...] around time varying magnetic fields.|$|R

5|$|Another {{controversy}} {{arose from}} the film when the Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball teams of the late 1980s with Kendall Gill and Stephen Bardo {{claimed to be the}} originators of baggy shorts in basketball. All of the Wolverines {{who took part in the}} production of the film <b>described</b> <b>how</b> they felt they originated the baggy shorts as a result of Rose's request. Even rapper Ice Cube described his recollection of them as the originators.|$|E
5|$|Flemish {{metallurgist}} and alchemist P. M. de Respour {{reported that}} he had extracted metallic zinc from zinc oxide in 1668. By the start of the 18th century, Étienne François Geoffroy <b>described</b> <b>how</b> zinc oxide condenses as yellow crystals on bars of iron placed above zinc ore that is being smelted. In Britain, John Lane is said to have carried out experiments to smelt zinc, probably at Landore, prior to his bankruptcy in 1726.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, Leonid Plyushch {{published}} his book Na Karnavale Istorii (At History's Сarnival) {{in which he}} <b>described</b> <b>how</b> he and other dissidents were committed to psychiatric hospitals.

5|$|In 1996, Dan Collison interviewed Port Chicago sailors for WBEZ radio's PRI-distributed program, This American Life. The men <b>described</b> <b>how</b> {{they were}} {{initially}} trained for action on ships and were disappointed {{when they were}} not assigned to ocean-going ships. Collison interspersed interviews with contemporary news reports about the explosion.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Alexander Shatravka {{published}} his book Pobeg iz Raya (Escape from Paradise) {{in which he}} <b>described</b> <b>how</b> he and his companions were caught after they illegally crossed the border between Finland and the Soviet Union {{to escape from the}} latter country and, as a result, were confined to Soviet psychiatric hospitals and prisons. In his book, he also described methods of brutal treatment of prisoners in the institutions.|$|E
5|$|In May 1996, Tan Ooi Boon, a {{reporter}} from The Straits Times who covered Martin's case from start to finish, wrote {{a book on the}} case, titled Body Parts: A British Serial Killer in Singapore.

30|$|Outline. Section 2 first <b>describes</b> <b>how</b> the {{framework}} {{is used to}} model user-centred privacy-aware systems that leverage pseudonymization, before <b>describing</b> <b>how</b> potential pseudonymization risks are identified in Section 3. Section 4 reports how {{the framework}} carries out data utility analysis. Section 5 <b>describes</b> <b>how</b> the framework is applied following privacy-by-design practice, and the framework is evaluated in Section 6. Section 7 describes related work, and Section 8 provides a conclusion and indicates areas of future work.|$|R

5|$|Marilyn Waring <b>described</b> <b>how</b> the {{exclusion}} of non-market activities in the national accounting systems relied on the deliberate choice and {{the design of the}} international standard of national accounts that explicitly excluded non-market activities. In some countries, such as Norway, which had included unpaid household work in the GDP {{in the first half of}} the 20th century, it was left out in 1950 for reasons of compatibility with the new international standard.|$|E
5|$|Once Allied {{troops were}} on the ground, some German units used the Rommelspargel for defense, by cutting them down and using the logs to {{reinforce}} impromptu positions. Sturmmann Karl Vasold of the 12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend <b>described</b> <b>how</b> his unit dug in under fire in a tank trench and foxholes on the road from Buron to Villons-les-Buissons, and used cut-down Rommelspargel poles to cover their positions and protect them from enemy fire.|$|E
5|$|The Pipil used wooden weapons {{with stone}} blades. Their weapons {{included}} long spears, atlatls (spear-throwers), arrows, and the macana (a wooden sword with inset obsidian blades {{similar to the}} Aztec macahuitl). These weapons proved inferior to elements of Spanish warfare such as steel, the horse and firearms. The Spanish <b>described</b> <b>how</b> the natives of El Salvador wore thick cotton armour, described as three fingers thick, that extended down {{to their feet and}} significantly encumbered them.|$|E
50|$|This section, from pages 130-136, <b>describes</b> <b>how</b> a spellcaster {{character}} can recharge an item which uses charges, such as wands, rods, staves, and some rings. It <b>describes</b> <b>how</b> {{this process is}} completed and what is required, both for wizard items and priest items.|$|R
50|$|Stress {{relaxation}} <b>describes</b> <b>how</b> polymers relieve stress {{under constant}} strain. Because they are viscoelastic, polymers {{behave in a}} nonlinear, non-Hookean fashion. This nonlinearity is described by both stress relaxation and a phenomenon known as creep, which <b>describes</b> <b>how</b> polymers strain under constant stress.|$|R

We go on to present two sample transport applications which utilise our technique and suggest areas for future work...|$|R
5|$|Accounts of snaring and {{destroying}} the beast are rare, {{as it is}} not {{generally considered to be}} a threat. In 1819 John MacCulloch, a noted geologist, <b>described</b> <b>how</b> inhabitants around the areas of Loch Awe and Loch Rannoch tried to capture a water bull by shackling a sheep to an oak tree as an enticement, but the tackle was not strong enough. Another story describes a farmer and his two sons hunting a water bull. The farmer's musket was filled with silver sixpence coins as the beast can only be killed with silver.|$|E
5|$|Family {{and family}} history also plays an {{important}} role in the poem. Eliot found information on his family from Sketch of the Eliot Family, which <b>described</b> <b>how</b> Eliot's family lived in East Coker for 200 years. When Andrew Eliott left, he disrupted the family history. Similarly, Eliot broke from his own family when he travelled away from his family, a family that he saw was declining. Within the poem, Eliot emphasizes the need for a journey and the need for inward change.|$|E
5|$|Official {{documents}} {{support the}} allegation of interference by the 610 Office. In 2009, two separate documents from Jilin province and Liaoning Province <b>described</b> <b>how</b> legal cases against Falun Gong practitioners {{must be approved}} and/or audited by the 610 Office. The 610 Office's organizational proximity to the CPC's Political and Judicial Committee better enables it to exercise influence with the Supreme People's Court and Ministry of Justice, both at the central level and with their counterparts at local levels.|$|E

5|$|Production of {{the film}} began shortly after the {{television}} series finishing its original broadcasting on Japanese channels, although pre-production started during the show's run in March 2004. The film's production was led by director Seiji Mizushima, who also had directed the series as well. Mizushima allowed a camera crew and interviewers into the show's conference room at the Bones studios where he <b>described</b> <b>how</b> production went, as seen in a special feature on the DVD release {{of the film}}. The conference room was filled with every cut and drawing created for the show and movie, but it was eventually cleared out {{to make room for}} other projects.|$|E
5|$|Roger Friedman, a gossip {{reporter}} for Fox News—a channel also owned by Fox's parent company News Corporation—was fired for writing {{a review of}} the film using the leaked copy he downloaded from the Internet.
