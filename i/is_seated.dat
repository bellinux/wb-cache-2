5|$|If {{the trial}} judge erroneously permits the {{striking}} of a juror under Batson, and the error is preserved, the only remedy is automatic reversal. If {{the trial judge}} erroneously prevents the striking of a juror under Batson, and the juror <b>is</b> <b>seated,</b> the Constitution permits a jurisdiction to utilize harmless error analysis. The race of the defendant is irrelevant to a Batson claim. Batson also permits the prosecutor to challenge defense peremptory strikes ("reverse Batson"). And, Batson applies equally to race and gender.|$|E

Johnny declares the monarchy to be dissolved and announces that Patusan will operate as a democracy. His reason for doing this is for the people to finally be free of rule, good or evil.|$|E

5|$|Sir John Tenniel drew {{a famous}} {{illustration}} of Alice meeting a caterpillar for Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland, c. 1865. The caterpillar <b>is</b> <b>seated</b> on a toadstool and is smoking a hookah; the image {{can be read}} as showing either the forelegs of the larva, or as suggesting a face with protruding nose and chin. Eric Carle's children's book The Very Hungry Caterpillar portrays the larva as an extraordinarily hungry animal, while also teaching children how to count (to five) and the days of the week.|$|E

5|$|The {{audience}} <b>is</b> <b>seated</b> {{in front}} of the stage, to {{the left side of the}} stage, and in the corner front-left of stage; these are in order of decreasing desirability. While the metsuke-bashira pillar obstructs the view of the stage, the actors are primarily at the corners, not the center, and thus the two aisles are located where the views of the two main actors would be obscured, ensuring a generally clear view regardless of seating.|$|E

5|$|Two iconographical {{forms of}} Varaha are popular. Yajna Varaha - {{denoting}} Yajna (sacrifice) - <b>is</b> <b>seated</b> on a lion-throne and flanked by his consorts Bhudevi and Lakshmi. As Pralaya Varaha - indicative of lifting the earth {{from the stage}} of the pralaya (the dissolution of the universe), he is depicted only with Bhudevi. Varaha may be depicted with Lakshmi alone too. In such sculptures, he may be depicted identical to Vishnu in terms of iconography with Vishnu's attributes; the boar head identifying the icon as Varaha. Lakshmi may be seated on his thigh in such portrayals.|$|E
5|$|Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) <b>is</b> <b>seated</b> in a {{chair in}} Assistant Director Walter Skinner's office, where he is shown a video from the morgue.

Suddenly, Agent Gene Crane comes to Doggett and tells him {{that there is a}} person—Knowle Rohrer—who wants to see him, about issues {{concerning}} Miles and Scully. This leaves Fox Mulder and Skinner to interrogate Krycek. Rohrer fabricates a story to Doggett that Miles is part of a Military Project to create a super soldier and that Scully had a chip put {{in the back of her}} neck during her abduction to make her pregnant with the first organic version of a super soldier.|$|E

5|$|Geastrum triplex may be {{confused}} with G.saccatum or G.fimbriatum, as the rays do not always crack around the perimeter to form a bowl under the spore case. However, it is larger than either of these species. The combination of characteristics which distinguish G.triplex from other earthstars include the lack of debris adhering to the outer surfaces, the saucer-like base in which the spore case <b>is</b> <b>seated,</b> the relatively large size, the fibrillose peristome and the paler area surrounding the peristome separating it {{from the rest of}} the endoperidium. Unlike some other Geastrum species, the rays of G.triplex are not hygroscopic: they do not open and close in response to changes in humidity.|$|E

They leave as Jennings and Shelly arrive; Hank <b>is</b> <b>seated</b> at another table and pulls Jennings aside to ask to start working in order to regain her trust. Meanwhile, using a {{photograph}} from Renault's home and the clues from Cooper's dream, the investigators find a log cabin in the woods that {{they believe to be}} the scene of the murder; on the floor Cooper finds a fragment of a One Eyed Jacks casino chip that matches the piece found in Laura's stomach, and Truman finds Waldo, the caged myna bird.|$|E
5|$|Many of the stelae that K'inich Yo'nal Ahk I erected became prototypes for monuments {{raised by}} his successors. The first stela raised, Stela 25, is the king's inaugural monument, and it {{established}} the precedent for the niche style. This type of stela features the newly installed king in a small hollow and seated on an intricately decorated scaffold, being symbolically lifted into the air. On Stela 25, K'inich Yo'nal Ahk I <b>is</b> <b>seated</b> on a jaguar cushion, reached by a ladder covered in bloody footprints, symbolizing sacrifice. The cushion itself is raised on a reed effigy. The king is covered by a canopy that is symbolic of the sky; crowning the sky is a great celestial bird, an avian version of the Maya god Itzamna.|$|E

5|$|Symphony in White, No. 3 shows Heffernan {{reclining}} on a {{sofa with}} her head rested on her hand, while Jones <b>is</b> <b>seated</b> on the floor, leaning against the sofa.

The fan is an oriental element, and {{an expression of the}} artistic trend known as Japonisme which was then prevalent in European art. At the time, Whistler was greatly influenced by his friend and colleague Albert Joseph Moore.

5|$|The Buddhist {{version of}} the Bhasmasura tale {{continues}} with Shiva (Ishvara) asking the female-Vishnu, who <b>is</b> <b>seated</b> on a swing, to marry him. She asks Shiva to get the permission of his wife Umayangana to take her home. Shiva returns with Umayangana's consent to find the female-Vishnu pregnant, who sends him back to get permission to bring a pregnant woman home. When he returns, a child is born and female-Vishnu is pregnant again. She requests Shiva to seek approval to bring a pregnant woman with a child home. This happens six more times. Finally, Shiva brings Umayangana with him to witness the miraculous woman. Vishnu then returns to his male form. Umayangana embraces the six youngest children merging them into the six-headed Skanda, while the eldest, named Aiyanayaka ("eldest brother") remains intact. Aiyanayaka is identified with Aiyanar.|$|E

Shiva is depicted with four arms, holding his attributes: the damaru (drum), the aksamala (chain of beads) and the trishul (trident) in three arms.
