60|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> latter deferentially as {{he stood}} looking out of window.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{figure of}} our {{commander}} in the boat ahead, and took courage.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{paper with}} open pleasure, {{but the other}} checked me as I began to speak.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> across <b>at</b> <b>the</b> girl. She was {{watching}} her uncle with distressed face.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> around <b>at</b> <b>the</b> little army of {{servants}} moving noiselessly {{about on}} all sides.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> appealingly <b>at</b> <b>the</b> judge. He was adamant. 'Answer as counsel directs you, witness,' he said, sternly.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly {{a thought}} struck me. <b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> clock in my study. It wanted {{ten minutes of}} twelve.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> serene face looking upward, {{and thought}} it was the stars that made it seem so noble.|$|E
60|$|As {{the drag}} drew {{up in the}} {{enclosure}} near the grand stand <b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> card to see the entries.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> it. <b>The</b> warrant now {{stipulated that}} Madame la Vicomtesse de Lavedan should bear her husband company in his exile.|$|R
60|$|I {{looked up}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> big stone {{buildings}} before us. My father was behind those walls. <b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> Kate. <b>The</b> poor girl was in tears.|$|R
60|$|I brush ahead heedlessly, {{knowing that}} caution here only wastes time, {{and study the}} fresh trail where the quarry jumped away in alarm. Straight down the wind it goes. Cunning old buck! He {{has no idea what}} Bluejay's alarm was about, but a warning, whether of crow or jay or tainted wind or {{snapping}} twig, is never lost on the wood folk. Now as he bounds along, cleaving the woods like a living bolt, yet stopping short every hundred yards or so to whirl and listen and sort the messages that the wood wires bring to him, he is perfectly sure of himself and his little flock, knowing that if danger follow down wind, his own nose will tell him all about it. <b>I</b> <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sun; only another hour of light, and I am six miles from home. <b>I</b> <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> jay, flitting about restlessly in a mixture of mischief and curiosity, whistling his too-loo-loo loudly as a sign to the fleeing game that I am right here and that he sees me. Then I take up the back trail, planning another day.|$|R
6000|$|I was {{conscious}} of an inexpressible relief and of the profoundest interest. <b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> great portrait. [...] "Mr Bowater?" [...] I repeated.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{clock and}} jumped up. It {{was very much}} later than I had thought. She gave me her hands a little wistfully.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> house, straw-thatched and commodious, at {{the large}} stable, and {{at the large}} array of fields I knew must belong with the place.|$|E
6000|$|... “Clear enough,” <b>I</b> answered, <b>glancing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{sunshine}} which streamed {{down the}} open companion-way. “Fair westerly breeze, {{with a promise}} of stiffening, if Louis predicts correctly.” ...|$|R
60|$|I {{thought this}} was queer. <b>I</b> had <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Want column of a Newville {{newspaper}} and had noted that moulders were wanted in several places.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then prepare {{yourself}} for a disappointment, my friend," [...] <b>I</b> advised, <b>glancing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> clock. [...] "They left for Paris by the nine o'clock train this morning." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{piece of}} paper and felt my face glow crimson. 'Oh, Lady Georgina,' I cried; 'you misunderstand. You forget that I am a lady.' ...|$|E
60|$|Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> newspaper; {{sometimes}} I {{looked out}} at the pleasant Southern garden, where the fountain flashed and fell among weeping willows, and laurels, orange-trees, and myrtles.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> hastily clad clergyman, {{with the}} {{formally}} dressed lodger seated beside him, and was amused at the surprise which Holmes's simple deduction {{had brought to}} their faces.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Cullen and <b>I</b> both <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> clock <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{other end}} of the room. It was twenty minutes to twelve. The detective looked back with a smile.|$|R
60|$|The letter rustled {{slightly}} in her hand. <b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> down <b>at</b> <b>the</b> flimsy blackened pages whose very handwriting seemed cabalistic, incomprehensible {{to the experience}} of Western Europe.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> down <b>at</b> <b>the</b> new patent leathers which I was wearing. [...] "How on earth--" [...] I began, but Holmes {{answered}} my question {{before it was}} asked.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> great New York detective and {{saw that}} a look of intense chagrin had come upon his {{clear-cut}} features. Failure in the slightest point always galled Shamrock Jolnes.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> thermometer. It {{registered}} 110 degrees. While we {{were talking}} the mighty iron mole had bored its way over a mile into the rock of the earth's crust.|$|E
60|$|Outside I {{could hear}} them calling for me. <b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> clock. It was {{within a few minutes}} of the time fixed for our departure. Mr. Bundercombe nodded to me.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> anxiously <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Vicomtesse, well {{knowing how}} wilful {{he was when}} aroused. Admiration was in her eyes, seeing that he was heedless of his own danger.|$|R
6000|$|... "Seldom {{that one}} {{experiences}} a calm so perfect," [...] said <b>I,</b> <b>glancing</b> upward <b>at</b> <b>the</b> slowly-rising smoke. [...] "Don't {{you think it}} is the proverbial calm before the storm?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> again <b>at</b> <b>the</b> tray. There were no fresh French rolls-- only {{slices of}} stale graham bread from yesterday, the most detestable of bread {{so far as}} I was concerned.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> part of {{the paper}} indicated. It {{announced}} a new mission to the Chinese, and heading the subscription list stood the name, [...] "Mr. John Burridge, one hundred guineas." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'He {{handed it}} over, and I {{took it to}} the lamplight. The {{handwriting}} seemed unfamiliar to me; but when <b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> last page, I saw that it was signed [...] "Irene." [...] I read it through hastily.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> mantelpiece. [...] "I see {{you have}} a {{photograph}} of Miss Sissie Montague," [...] I broke in casually, taking it down and examining it. [...] "WITH an autograph, too. 'Reggie, from Sissie.' You are a friend of hers?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> round. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> further end of {{the chamber}} was a heavy curtain that hid a little place built in the {{thickness}} of the wall which I used for the storage of rolls and instruments.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why did {{you want}} to go to the coach-house so early?" [...] <b>I</b> exclaimed, <b>glancing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> wide-open door and empty interior. [...] "I had an awful job to get that man in there last night, and now you've let him go." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, he said nothing. <b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> him—he's just <b>the</b> same, brick colour—stolid. Mind that stone—it rocks. I'm glad you've got strong boots on." ...|$|R
