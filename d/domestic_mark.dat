40|$|Contemporary {{immigration}} to the United States is seldom associated with the traumas of poverty in the specialized literature. This is not due {{to the absence of}} objective indicators of poverty, such as low incomes, among recent immigrants, but to the low incidence of those social pathologies commonly associated with the <b>domestic</b> "underclass" (<b>Marks</b> 1991). Instead, the areas where the foreign born concentrate are characterized by a different set of social traits including the widespread use of languages other than English, great diversity in terms of both national origins and socioeconomic backgrounds, the large and semiopen presence of unauthorized aliens, and the rise of ethnic business enclaves. The research literature on immigration has focused on these and related topics in contrast to those that most concern students of domestic poverty. Indeed when the two literatures come together, it {{is in the form of}} comparisons that point to the relative progress of immigrants relative to native-born minorities despite initial disadvantages, such as lack of English knowledge and unfamiliarity with the host culture. These comparisons are notable because immigrants must often endure conditions every bit as harsh, if not worse than the domestic poor. The difference is that immigrants' poverty is embedded in a social context that makes it appear less hopeless and more transitory than the kind afflicting the native born. We review some of the reasons for this contrast below following an overview of the magnitude and characteristics of contemporary immigration...|$|R

60|$|The vulgar {{and obvious}} {{criticism}} {{on all this}} is that it is utopian, that such households do not generally exist, because neither masters nor servants possess the qualities needed to maintain these relations of unbroken order and friendliness. Perhaps not; and masters and servants will be more and more removed from the possession of such qualities, and their relations further distant from such order and friendliness, if writers cease to press the beauty and serviceableness of a domesticity that is at present only possible in a few rare cases, or to insist on the ugliness, the waste of peace, the deterioration of character, that are the results of our present system. Undoubtedly it is much easier for Rousseau to draw his picture of semi-patriarchal felicity, than {{for the rest of us}} to realise it. It was his function to press ideals of sweeter life on his contemporaries, and they may be counted fortunate in having a writer who could fulfil this function with Rousseau's peculiar force of masterly persuasion. His scornful diatribes against the domestic police of great houses, and the essential inhumanity of the ordinary household relations, are both excellent and of permanent interest. There is the full breath of a new humaneness in them. They were the right way of attacking the decrepitude of feudal luxury and insolence, and its imitation among the great farmers-general. This criticism of the conditions of <b>domestic</b> service <b>marks</b> a beginning of true democracy, as distinguished from the mere pulverisation of aristocracy. It rests on the claim of the common people to an equal consideration, as equally useful and equally capable of virtue and vice; and it implies the essential priority of social over political reform.|$|R

Bite the hands that feed you engages some of the ironies of contemporary material culture's uneasy relationship with the natural world in a pair of intertwined apocalyptic scenarios, Horsemen and Wild dogs. Wild dogs is the trio of bronze dogs. <b>Domestic</b> animals <b>mark</b> our evolving relationship with our concepts of the natural, just as ornament involves natural forms reduced and stylized. A dog or a horse could be considered a stylized gesture toward a wild animal, in a world where even the truly wild animals require our careful management. The dogs stand in for the natural world as it is today, compromised, poisoned and possibly dying, but still showing teeth. Horsemen is the group of four busts set on top of concrete pedestals; they are less renderings of the Horsemen of the Biblical apocalypse than my own idea of the retribution humanity seems determined to provoke from nature. Where ornament can speak to us of gardens, these things are more like jungles; systems spinning out of human control, becoming something else. In this way we continually create our own horsemen, our own apocalypses...|$|R
50|$|Dramatic {{works have}} nearly always {{contained}} {{a sense of}} domestic drama within its fundamental plot line. Even in the early ages of Greek drama, {{there has been a}} sense of ordinary people's struggles with their lives (though this cannot be classified as domestic drama due to the incorporation of the Greek gods interfering with the common people and the enabling of the common people to have “godlike” attributes). Medieval theatre tended to express religious themes within their shows with miracles and the creation of morality plays, in which the shows were used as religious allegories. Though not yet emphasizing the ordinary lives, the development of dramatic works is slowly working towards more realistic plot lines, one of the essential elements in <b>domestic</b> drama.Renaissance theatre <b>marks</b> the arrival of pastoral drama, drama referring to the relationships of the rustics. Though this describes the events of 'ordinary people', the shows tended to stretch realism, focussed mainly on the romantic relationships of the rustics, and were decorated with an emphasis on the comedic aspect of theater. Pastoral drama was considered to be more successful than the traditional comedies and tragedies, enforcing the further development into domestic drama.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. In recent years, {{international}} nongovernment organizations (NGOs) {{and transnational}} networks involved in knowledge creation have become key civil-society actors in Southeast Asia. How and why has such form of transnational activism expanded {{significantly in the}} region? The author suggests {{that this type of}} activism is a response to socioeconomic and political processes associated with globalization, as well {{as a consequence of the}} relative and limited political liberalization that has characterized some Southeast Asian countries. The specific combination of these two factors is peculiar to the region since contemporary transnational activism in Western Europe and North America takes place within open democracies with well-established civil-society organizations. Moreover, trade liberalization and other global economic processes have not <b>marked</b> <b>domestic</b> dynamics as rapidly and suddenly as the economic boom of the 1980 s and, eventually, the 1997 financial crisis did in certain Southeast Asian countries. To explore this argument, the paper traces the genealogy and analyzes the objectives and activities of four transnational activist organizations. Common to the four organizations is the central place of discourse and knowledge production and its linkages to mobilization, network building and constituency building, and a growing awareness that they are confronted with common challenges and share common targets...|$|R

The macroscopic scenario is presented and aspects such as <b>domestic</b> and foreign <b>marked</b> potentials, barriers, technology needs and the strategies required to boost the small wind turbine sector are presented. NAL’s wind turbine development program, since its establishment in 1959, has been presented and different machines developed at NAL. Finally, NAL’s vision of developing a 500 W class stand alone horizontal axis wind turbine for battery charging is explained. This project would aim at utilizing NAL’s experience and expertise in aerospace domain to develop an indigenous wind turbine system. A variant of this can be considered for urban and military application also. The basic strategy is explained. The report ends with a note committing the realization of a 500 W wind turbine system, whose development would be consumer as well as market driven. The report gives a strategic description of the project and no technical issues have been included. However, subsequently, as NAL progresses along its predefined strategy of developing 500 W wind turbine under the 11 th Five Year Plan, the technical and design reports of all the aspects like rotor aerodynamic and structural design, drive-train, generator, tower and controller would be brought up...|$|R
40|$|While {{setting out}} to cover a series of {{prominent}} tropes and shifts that characterize the cinematic portrayal of Polish labor migrants after 1989, this paper looks into the function of domestic settings {{in some of the}} migration narratives involved. On the one hand, the prominent position of domestic spaces closely intertwines with the typical kind of jobs migrant workers from Poland tend to perform within the host society (construction work in the case of Polish males, domestic services in the case of their female counterparts). On the other hand, the recurring house motif seems to allow for a variety of metaphorical and allegorical readings, most notably {{in the sense that the}} house becomes the most direct spatial embodiment of the sociopolitical environment these migrant workers end up in. In a similar vein, the house-related labor performed by the protagonists (cleaning and construction services) seems to be highly indicative of the regenerative potential they represent vis-à-vis the ailing host society. What is more, the way the migrant characters behave within these local settings and are allowed to move between exterior and interior spaces seems to give expression to the various challenges and anxieties faced by Europe in the wake of the fall of Communism and subsequent European integration. In most cases, the ascending and progressive trajectory these vigorous newcomers follow within the <b>domestic</b> space <b>marks</b> their evolution from being useless outsiders (troublemakers) to becoming useful insiders (problem solvers). Apart from analyzing the house motif as one of the prominent tropes in post- 1989 migration narratives, this paper also brings into view the close relationship between domestic settings and the shifted position of Polish migrants within the European Union’s sociocultural space. As some of the most recent films seem to attest, Polish characters are gradually climbing up the social ladder within “Fortress Europe”, getting rid of their label of prototypical labour immigrants, whereas the empty space is taken up by immigrants from outside the Schengen zone. As such, the way these films envision the relation between migrants and domestic settings seems to point to the existence of specific ethnic hierarchies in the cinematic portrayal of immigrants from the former Soviet sphere of influence. status: accepte...|$|R
50|$|The 1998-99 {{season was}} {{undoubtedly}} {{one of the}} best seasons in Olympiacos history. They won the 1998-99 Greek Championship quite convincingly, with ten points difference from AEK and 11 from third-placed Panathinaikos, and also celebrated the domestic double, bringing home the 1998-99 Greek Cup after a convincing 2-0 win against arch-rivals Panathinaikos in the final (Mavrogenidis 54', Ofori-Quaye 90'), {{despite the fact that they}} played for more than 60 minutes in the game with ten players. In European competitions, they entered the 1998-99 UEFA Champions League group stage, being drawn in a group with Ajax, Porto and Croatia Zagreb. They won the group and qualified to the quarter-finals, gathering 11 points with 3 home wins against Ajax (1-0), Porto (2-1) and Croatia Zagreb (2-0) and two away draws in Porto (2-2) and Zagreb (1-1). In the quarter-finals of the competition, they faced Juventus, with the first leg in Turin. Juventus took a 2-0 lead, but Olympiacos scored a crucial away goal in the 90th minute of the game with a penalty by Andreas Niniadis, a goal that caused the 10.000 Olympiacos fans who travelled to Italy to erupt into joyous ecstasy. In the second leg in Athens, Olympiacos totally donimated the match, and scored the goal that put them in the driving seat in the 12th minute of the game, when Siniša Gogić's powerful header found the back of the net after Grigoris Georgatos's superb cross. They also missed an outstanding chance to double the lead, when Giorgos Amanatidis' powerful header from short distance was saved by Michelangelo Rampulla. Olympiacos kept the ticket to the semi-finals in his hands until the 85th minute, when Juventus, who hadn't produced any chances in the game, equalised the score after a crucial mistake by Dimitris Eleftheropoulos, who had been the team's hero in all the previous games. Despite the big disappointment from the way the qualification to the semi-finals was lost, the presence of the team in the Champions League quarter-finals, their best-ever European campaign, combined with the <b>domestic</b> double, <b>marked</b> a very successful season for the club, arguably the best in their long history.|$|R
40|$|Cape Verde petrel (Pterodroma feae) is {{currently}} considered near threatened, but {{little is known}} about its population size, breeding biology and on land threats, jeopardizing its management and conservation. To improve this situation, we captured, marked and recaptured (CMR) birds using mist-nets over 10 years; measured and sexed them; monitored up to 14 burrows, deployed GPS devices on breeders and analyzed activity data of geolocators retrieved from breeders in Fogo (Cape Verde). We set cat traps over the colony and investigated their domestic/feral origin by <b>marking</b> <b>domestic</b> cats from a nearby village with transponders, by deploying GPS devices on domestic cats and by performing stable isotope analyses of fur of the trapped and domestic cats. The population of Fogo was estimated to be 293 birds, including immatures (95 % CI: 233 - 254, CMR modelling). Based on geolocator activity data and nest monitoring we determined the breeding phenology of this species and we found biometric differences between sexes. While monitoring breeding performance, we verified a still ongoing cat predation and human harvesting. Overall, data gathered from trapped cats without transponder, cats GPS trips and the distinct isotopic values between domestic and trapped cats suggest cats visiting the colony are of feral origin. GPS tracks from breeders showed birds left and returned to the colony using the sector NE of the islands, where high level of public lights should be avoided specially during the fledging period. Main threats for the Cape Verde petrel in the remaining breeding islands are currently unknown but likely to be similar to Fogo, calling for an urgent assessment of population trends and the control of main threats in all Cape Verde Islands and uplisting its conservation status...|$|R
40|$|Feral swine {{are defined}} as free roaming animals of the genus Sus that are not being held under {{domestic}} management or confinement. Swine have spread from Europe and Russia to habitats around the world via human introduction. Currently, feral swine populations are established on every continent except Antarctica. Unlike other large mammal invaders, swine have a high reproductive capacity and are omnivorous, which allows for a quick assimilation into most habitats. Once a breeding population is established in an area, the population can quickly increase and negatively impact the ecosystem. A successful invasion of feral swine is difficult, and sometimes impossible, to reverse. A feral swine pest risk assessment for Oregon, released in 2004, designated feral swine as a very high-risk species due to high potential for establishment, environmental and economic impacts, and disease transmission to wildlife, livestock and humans. Economic impacts on ecosystems and disease transmission to wildlife are difficult to assess, but restoration of ecosystems and losses to agriculture and livestock have been estimated to exceed US$ 800 million in the United States each year. Environmental impacts include facilitation of noxious weed invasions, shifts in dominant plant species, reduction of forest regeneration, and soil erosion. Facilitation of noxious weeds and erosion due to feral swine rooting are documented in Oregon. Feral swine in Oregon have not been implicated in disease transmission to humans, but the recent E. coli outbreak from spinach grown on a California farm that caused three deaths has been genetically traced to feral swine excrement deposited in spinach fields. The feral swine population in Oregon is currently small and dispersed. Few disturbances have been documented but state and federal biologists report regular occurrence of disturbances due to feral swine. Actions to prevent the effects of an invasion fall into three categories: management, control or eradication. Of the three categories, only eradication efforts have successfully slowed or reversed the effects of swine invasions. Case studies from California, Australia, Hawaii, the Galapagos Islands and the Channel Islands {{off the coast of}} California show that management and control efforts, while effective in the short term, have not successfully kept small feral swine populations from increasing to levels that are unmanageable and uncontrollable. A four-year feral swine eradication plan is proposed. The Plan includes recommended legislative changes to facilitate eradication, outreach and education, population assessment, rapid response, and eradication elements. A 0. 5 FTE position is required at the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife to implement the plan. Eradication of feral swine in Oregon is estimated to require a four-year, $ 1. 29 million effort. Follow-up control of new releases and escapes will require a maintenance effort estimated at less than $ 50, 000 per year (excluding contingency funds for emergency response). These costs are small relative to the value of the $ 3. 6 billion Oregon agriculture and livestock industries and the investment Oregon has made in riparian restoration efforts. Sustained control of feral swine in Oregon will require a longterm commitment that will include annual <b>domestic</b> swine <b>marking,</b> education, and monitoring...|$|R
40|$|Very {{little has}} been written on {{sexuality}} in architectural scholarship. Sexuality & Space (Princeton Architectural Press, 1992) contains the proceedings of an eponymous 1990 conference at Princeton University, and was both {{the first and last}} book-length publication dedicated to a comprehensive discourse on sexual identity within the discipline of architecture. While symposium organizer and proceedings editor Beatriz Colomina writes in the proceedings' introduction that the occasion's effort to "raise the question of 'Sexuality and Space'" was but "one small event" in an ongoing discourse, that discourse failed to materialize. To the extent that feminist theorists conspicuously ignored in architectural discourse and practice are addressed by Sexuality & Space, the "interdisciplinary exchange in which theories of sexuality are reread in architectural terms and architecture is reread in sexual terms," by its essays, asserts the very silence that its inquiry ostensibly alleviated. By carefully examining the constative impact of literary style within the publication Sexuality & Space-that is, by looking at how the use of language, therein, impacts that document's inscription of its intellectual and historical context-I have come {{to a better understanding of}} how that publication was both the beginning and end of the conversation it sought to inaugurate. "Notes on Sexuality and Space" investigates three related essays from that publication: Laura Mulvey's "Pandora: Topographies of the Mask and Curiosity," Beatriz Colomina's "The Split Wall: <b>Domestic</b> Voyeurism," and <b>Mark</b> Wigley's "Untitled: The Housing of Gender. " Each investigated essay has been given a corresponding chapter. My method has been close reading, or the sustained interpretation of brief passages of text. Paying close attention to individual words, syntax, and the order in which ideas unfold as they are read, I have developed a comprehensive narrative of how these three essays, together, both instantiate and negate a shared discourse. To these ends, this thesis raises serious questions about what it means to have historiography after silence, and what it means to re-open an already closed discourse. by Samuel Ray Jacobson.

60|$|Having {{alluded to}} the subject of reversion, I may here refer to a {{statement}} often made by naturalists--namely, that our domestic varieties, when run wild, gradually but invariably revert in character to their aboriginal stocks. Hence {{it has been argued that}} no deductions can be drawn from domestic races to species in a state of nature. I have in vain endeavoured to discover on what decisive facts the above statement has so often and so boldly been made. There would be great difficulty in proving its truth: we may safely conclude that very many of the most strongly <b>marked</b> <b>domestic</b> varieties could not possibly live in a wild state. In many cases we do not know what the aboriginal stock was, and so could not tell whether or not nearly perfect reversion had ensued. It would be necessary, in order to prevent the effects of intercrossing, that only a single variety should be turned loose in its new home. Nevertheless, as our varieties certainly do occasionally revert in some of their characters to ancestral forms, it seems to me not improbable that if we could succeed in naturalising, or were to cultivate, during many generations, the several races, for instance, of the cabbage, in very poor soil--in which case, however, some effect would have to be attributed to the DEFINITE action of the poor soil--that they would, to a large extent, or even wholly, revert to the wild aboriginal stock. Whether or not the experiment would succeed is not of great importance for our line of argument; for by the experiment itself the conditions of life are changed. If it could be shown that our domestic varieties manifested a strong tendency to reversion--that is, to lose their acquired characters, while kept under the same conditions and while kept in a considerable body, so that free intercrossing might check, by blending together, any slight deviations in their structure, in such case, I grant that we could deduce nothing from domestic varieties in regard to species. But there is not a shadow of evidence in favour of this view: to assert that we could not breed our cart and race-horses, long and short-horned cattle, and poultry of various breeds, and esculent vegetables, for an unlimited number of generations, would be opposed to all experience.|$|R
40|$|The Manusmṛti or Laws of Manu is {{the most}} {{important}} and earliest metrical dharmaśāstra. According to Patrick Olivelle, this work was composed {{during the time of the}} Kuṣāṇa Empire. Manusmṛti has divine origin – the Indian god of creation, Brahman, proclaimed it to his son Manu, the progenitor of mankind, and Manu ordered his son Bhṛgu to proclaim it to the people. The exposition was subdivided into twelve chapters which regarding to the structure, can be divided into four parts – (1) creation of the world, (2) sources of dharma, (3) the dharma of the four social classes, (4) law of karma, rebirth, and final liberation. The most important is the third part (cāturvarṇasya dharmaḥ: 2. 25 – 11. 266). That is the main topic of this paper. The most precise insight into the fabric of ancient Indian society can be provided by an analysis of the regulations concerning the four varṇas – Brahmins (the priests), Kṣatriyas (the warrior class), Vaiśyas (production class) and Śūdras (class of those who serves others). Within the Laws of Manu, 38, 6 percent of the text is dedicated to Brahmins, and 36 percent to the Kṣatriyas. Along with the varṇas, the āśrama system plays a very important role. This system refers to the four distinct and legitimate periods of life or ways of leading religious life. In the first period of life a person is called brahmacārin, a celibate student, in the second gṛhastha, a married householder, in the third and fourth vānaprastha, a forest hermit, and saṃnyāsin, a world renouncer. It is important to notice that the varṇa system regulates the hierarchy in society and the āśrama system regulates the proper flow of life. Within the āśrama sytem an important role is played by the saṃskāras, sacraments, complex <b>domestic</b> rituals which <b>mark</b> the entry into any particular period of life. The Laws of Manu is written by Brahmins probably during the Kuṣāṇa period. Due to this fact, one can speculate about the social and political environment of the author(s) and the motivations for the composition of this work. The main goal for the author(s) was to protect the rights and privileges of the brahmanical class. After the period of the Maurya Empire and their ruler Aśoka – a Buddhist who founded "the kingdom of dharma" – Brahmins wanted to re-establish the old alliance between the political power and their religious role. This alliance would benefit both the Brahmins and the Kṣatriyas; the kings and Brahmins would have again the privileged position within the society. However, the Laws of Manu has occupied the most prominent position among the Indian law books, the dharmaśāstras. Therefore the influence of the Manusmṛti had spread far outside India and its text was widely studied and commented upon for many centuries...|$|R
6000|$|If {{she herself}} had now avoided any such sacrifice, and had made herself, during the time at her disposal, quite inordinately fresh and quite {{positively}} smart, this had probably added, while she waited and waited, to that very tension of spirit {{in which she was}} afterwards to find the image of her having crouched. She did her best, quite intensely, by herself, to banish any such appearance; she couldn't help it if she couldn't read her pale novel--ah, that, par exemple, was beyond her! but she could at least sit by the lamp with the book, sit there with her newest frock, worn for the first time, sticking out, all round her, quite stiff and grand; even perhaps a little too stiff and too grand for a familiar and <b>domestic</b> frock, yet <b>marked</b> none the less, this time, she ventured to hope, by incontestable intrinsic merit. She had glanced repeatedly at the clock, but she had refused herself the weak indulgence of walking up and down, though the act of doing so, she knew, would make her feel, on the polished floor, with the rustle and the [...] "hang," [...] still more beautifully bedecked. The difficulty was that it would also make her feel herself still more sharply in a state; which was exactly what she proposed not to do. The only drops of her anxiety had been when her thought strayed complacently, with her eyes, to the front of her gown, which was in a manner a refuge, a beguilement, especially when she was able to fix it long enough to wonder if it would at last really satisfy Charlotte. She had ever been, in respect to her clothes, rather timorous and uncertain; for the last year, above all, she had lived in the light of Charlotte's possible and rather inscrutable judgment of them. Charlotte's own were simply the most charming and interesting that any woman had ever put on; {{there was a kind of}} poetic justice in her being at last able, in this particular, thanks to means, thanks quite to omnipotence, freely to exercise her genius. But Maggie would have described herself as, in these connections, constantly and intimately [...] "torn"; conscious on one side of the impossibility of copying her companion and conscious on the other of the impossibility of sounding her, independently, to the bottom. Yes, it was one of the things she should go down to her grave without having known--how Charlotte, after all had been said, really thought her stepdaughter looked under any supposedly ingenious personal experiment. She had always been lovely about the stepdaughter's material braveries--had done, for her, the very best with them; but there had ever fitfully danced at the back of Maggie's head the suspicion that these expressions were mercies, not judgments, embodying no absolute, but only a relative, frankness. Hadn't Charlotte, with so perfect a critical vision, if the truth were known, given her up as hopeless--hopeless by a serious standard, and thereby invented for her a different and inferior one, in which, as the only thing to be done, she patiently and soothingly abetted her? Hadn't she, in other words, assented in secret despair, perhaps even in secret irritation, to her being ridiculous?--so that the best now possible was to wonder, once in a great while, whether one mightn't give her the surprise of something a little less out of the true note than usual. Something of this kind was the question that Maggie, while the absentees still delayed, asked of the appearance she was endeavouring to present; but with the result, repeatedly again, that it only went and lost itself in the thick air that had begun more and more to hang, for our young woman, over her accumulations of the unanswered. They were THERE, these accumulations; they were like a roomful of confused objects, never as yet [...] "sorted," [...] which for some time now she had been passing and re-passing, along the corridor of her life. She passed it when she could without opening the door; then, on occasion, she turned the key to throw in a fresh contribution. So it was that she had been getting things out of the way. They rejoined the rest of the confusion; it was as if they found their place, by some instinct of affinity, in the heap. They knew, in short, where to go; and when she, at present, by a mental act, once more pushed the door open, she had practically a sense of method and experience. What she should never know about Charlotte's thought--she tossed THAT in. It would find itself in company, and she might at last have been standing there long enough to see it fall into its corner. The sight moreover would doubtless have made her stare, had her attention been more free-- the sight of the mass of vain things, congruous, incongruous, that awaited every addition. It made her in fact, with a vague gasp, turn away, and what had further determined this was the final sharp extinction of the inward scene by the outward. The quite different door had opened and her husband was there.|$|R
