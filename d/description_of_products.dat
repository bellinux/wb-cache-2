The article discusses metrics of the mental map, as well as substantiates the possibility of applying conservation laws to psychology. It is shown {{that it is possible to}} reach an adequate representation of research object in the humanities, equivalent to that of natural sciences in terms of accuracy.

40|$|International audienceProducts {{and virtual}} humans are {{commonly}} described using 3 D models of their components and anatomical entities, respectively.

Here, {{the purpose is to}} identify similarities and differences between existing ontology based descriptions of products and virtual humans. From this analysis, it is shown how compatible descriptions can be obtained and how a common framework can be derived where products and virtual humans can be both incorporated for various applications involving 3 D models. The proposed framework contains an ontology based <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>products</b> and virtual humans enabling the access to 3 D models while accessing high level semantic information through the use of inference mechanisms.

40|$|Abstract: Knowledge based {{recommender}} {{systems can}} overcome {{the shortcomings of}} the traditional ones. To realize knowledge based recommender systems user requirements and resources on web such as information, products and services need to be described as knowledge uniformly. This paper explores the semantic <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>products</b> and the automatic acquisition of product knowledge from heterogeneous databases. The product is modeled as a duple and is defined as an ontology using OWL. To acquire product knowledge from heterogeneous databases, we adopt the method of schema mapping and OWL transferring template. The database schema is mapped to XML schema to which {{the content of the}} XML documents generated from the data in the databases must conform. The XML documents are further transferred to OWL documents by the OWL transferring template. The generated OWL documents are the semantic descriptions of product instances and can be provided as input to reasoner such as Racer to conduct ontology based reasoning or rule based reasoning. An example of product knowledge acquisition process is given in this paper...|$|E

40|$|This study {{approaches}} {{the question of}} whether on-line shopping preferences differ from a gender perspective. Data is collected by the means of an on-line survey (n= 170) in which male and female on-line shoppers rank the importance of various features that have an impact on their shopping experience. The results show no gender differences at the construct level. However, when comparing the ranking of individual features some statistically significant differences exist. Males, for example, rank accurate <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>products</b> and fair pricing significantly more important than females. Females on the other hand consider return labels significantly more important than their male counterparts. The implications for research are twofold. First, the study provides additional insights into on-line shopping preferences from a gender perspective. Second, the study demonstrates that significant differences might not show on the construct level but only when features are individually compared with each other. The implication for practice is to help businesses enhance their on-line shopping platforms to better consider the particular needs of male and female on-line shoppers...|$|E
