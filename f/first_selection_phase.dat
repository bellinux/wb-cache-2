40|$|ABSTRACT: The <b>first</b> <b>phase</b> <b>selection</b> and the <b>phase</b> forma-tion {{sequence}} between {{metal and}} silicon (Si) couples are indispensably significant to microelectronics. With increasing scaling of device dimension to nano regime, established thermodynamic and kinetic models in bulk and thin film fail to apply in 1 -D nanostructures. Herein, we present an unique size-dependent first phase formation sequence in 1 -D nano-structures, with Ni−Si {{as the model}} system. Interfacial-limited phase which forms the last in thin film, NiSi 2, appears as the dominant first phase at 300 − 800 °C due to the elimination of continuous grain boundaries in 1 -D silicides. On the other hand, θ-Ni 2 Si, the most competitive diffusion-limited phase takes over NiSi 2 and wins out as the first phase in small diameter nanowires at 800 °C. Kinetic parameters extracted from in situ transmission electron microscope studies and a modified kinetic growth competition model quantitatively explain this observation. An estimated critical diameter from the model agrees reasonably well with observations...|$|R

40|$|The overproduce-and-choose sttategy is {{a static}} {{classifier}} ensemble selection approach, which {{is divided into}} overproduction and <b>selection</b> <b>phases.</b> This thesis focuses on the <b>selection</b> <b>phase,</b> which is the challenge in overproduce-and-choose strategy. When this phase is implemented as an optimization process, the search criterion and the search algorithm are the two major topics involved. In this thesis, we concentrate in optimization processes conducted using genetic algorithms guided by both single- and multi-objective functions. We first focus on finding the best search criterion. Various search criteria are investigated, such as diversity, the error rate and ensemble size. Error rate and diversity measures are directly compared in the single-objective optimization approach. Diversity measures are combined with the error rate and with ensemble size, in pairs of objective functions, to guide the multi-optimization approach. Experimental results are presented and discussed. Thereafter, we show that besides focusing {{on the characteristics of}} the decision profiles of ensemble members, the control of overfitting at the <b>selection</b> <b>phase</b> of overproduce-and-choose strategy must also be taken into account. We show how overfitting can be detected at the <b>selection</b> <b>phase</b> and present three strategies to control overfitting. These strategies are tailored for the classifier ensemble selection problcm and compared. This comparison allows us to show that a global validation strategy should be applied to control overfitting in optimization processes involving a classifier ensembles selection task. Furthermore, this study has helped us establish that this global validation strategy {{can be used as a}} tool to measure the relationship between diversity and classification performance when diversity measures are employed as single-objective functions. Finally, the main contribution of this thesis is a proposed dynamic overproduce-and-choose strategy. While the static overproduce-and-choose selection strategy has traditionally focused on finding the most accurate subset of classifiers during the <b>selection</b> <b>phase,</b> and using it to predict the class of all the test samples, our dynamic overproduce-and- choose strategy allows the selection of the most confident subset of classifiers to label each test sample individually. Our method combines optimization and dynamic selection in a two-level <b>selection</b> <b>phase.</b> The optimization level is intended to generate a population of highly accurate classifier ensembles, while the dynamic selection level applies measures of confidence in order to select the ensemble with the highest degree of confidence in the current decision. Three different confidence measures are presented and compared. Our method outperforms classical static and dynamic selection strategies...|$|R
40|$|The <b>phase</b> <b>selection</b> is an {{important}} of a SAT Solver based on conflict-driven DPLL. This paper presents a new <b>phase</b> <b>selection</b> strategy, in which the weight of each literal {{is defined as the}} sum of its implied-literals static weights. The implied literals of each literal is computed dynamically during the search. Therefore, it is call a dynamic <b>phase</b> <b>selection</b> strategy. In general, computing dynamically a weight is time-consuming. Hence, so far no SAT solver applies successfully a dynamic <b>phase</b> <b>selection.</b> Since the implied literal of our strategy conforms to that of the search process, the usual two watched-literals scheme can be applied here. Thus, the cost of our dynamic <b>phase</b> <b>selection</b> is very low.

40|$|A {{common and}} {{practical}} paradigm in cooperative communication systems {{is the use}} of a dynamically selected `best' relay to decode and forward information from a source to a destination. Such systems use two phases - a relay <b>selection</b> <b>phase,</b> in which the system uses transmission time and energy to select the best relay, and a data transmission phase, in which it uses the spatial diversity benefits of selection to transmit data. In this paper, we derive closed-form expressions for the overall throughput and energy consumption, and study the time and energy trade-off between the selection and data transmission phases. To this end, we analyze a baseline non-adaptive system and several adaptive systems that adapt the <b>selection</b> <b>phase,</b> relay transmission power, or transmission time. Our results show that while selection yields significant benefits, the <b>selection</b> <b>phase's</b> time and energy overhead can be significant. In fact, at the optimal point, the selection can be far from perfect, and depends on the number of relays and the mode of adaptation. The results also provide guidelines about the optimal system operating point for different modes of adaptation. The analysis also sheds new insights on the fast splitting-based algorithm considered in this paper for relay selection...|$|R
30|$|If the {{successful}} helpers support a {{high data rate}} and have data packets to send (i.e., a helper with priority 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, or 10), the packet piggyback mechanism can be used. However, {{it is vital that}} only a single best helper wins during the helper <b>selection</b> <b>phase.</b> As shown in Figure  5, to achieve this, every successful helper needs to send a help-to-send (HTS) packet to the sender at a data rate R SH {{at the end of the}} helper <b>selection</b> <b>phase.</b> If the sender successfully receives and decodes the HTS packet, this indicates that only one helper has won during the helper <b>selection</b> <b>phase,</b> and the packet piggyback mechanism can be used. The information of the packet piggyback mechanism and the total transmission time for the entire data packet transmission are designated in the data packet transmitted by the sender at a data rate R SH. After the helper receives the data packet from the sender, it relays the data packet to the recipient of the sender at a data rate R HD and then transmits its own data packet to its recipient. The recipients of the sender and helper reply in turn with an ACK packet to their respective senders.|$|R
