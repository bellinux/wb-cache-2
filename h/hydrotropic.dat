25|$|Philodendrons {{have both}} aerial and {{subterranean}} roots. The aerial roots occur in many {{shapes and sizes}} and originate {{from most of the}} plant's nodes or occasionally from an internode. The size and number of aerial roots per node depends on the presence of a suitable substrate for the roots to attach themselves. Aerial roots serve two primary purposes. They allow the philodendron to attach itself to a tree or other plant, and they allow it to collect water and nutrients. As such, the roots are divided morphologically into these two categories. Aerial roots used for attaching to trees tend to be shorter, more numerous, and sometimes have a layer of root hairs attached; those used for collecting water and nutrients tend to be thicker and longer. These feeder roots tend to attach flush with the substrate to which the philodendron is attached, and make their way directly downwards in search of soil. In general, feeder roots tend to show both positive <b>hydrotropic</b> and negative heliotropic behaviors. Characteristic of roots in philodendrons is the presence of a sclerotic hypodermis, which are cylindrical tubes inside the epidermis that can be one to five cells long. The cells that line the sclerotic hypodermis are elongated and tend to be hardened. Underneath the epidermis is a unique layer of cells in a pattern of long cells followed by short cells.|$|E

50|$|Potassium humate is the {{potassium}} salt of humic acid. It is manufactured commercially by alkaline extraction of brown coal (lignite) Leonardite {{to be used}} mainly as a soil conditioner. The extraction is performed in water {{with the addition of}} potassium hydroxide (KOH), sequestering agents and <b>hydrotropic</b> surfactants. Heat is used to increase the solubility of humic acids and hence more potassium humate can be extracted. The resulting liquid is dried to produce the amorphous crystalline like product which can then be added as a granule to fertiliser. The potassium humate granules by way of chemical extraction lose their hydrophobic properties and are now soluble. Depending on the source material product quality varies. High quality oxidised lignite (brown coal), usually referred to as leonardite, is the best source material for extraction of large quantities of potassium humate. The less oxidised the coal the less potassium humate extracted. Sources low in ash produce the best quality. Less oxidised brown coal contains a higher proportion of the insoluble humin fraction and along with peat which is lower in humic acid content and usually high in ash content requires separation by filtration or centrifugation to remove ash, humin. Peat is also high in non humified organic matter that needs to be reduced to produce a high quality product. The benefit of peat is that it is usually 2-3 times higher in fulvic acid content, which are the low molecular weight fractions of humic acid that are high in oxygen containing functional groups and soluble at a low pH of <1. Fulvic acids have a higher cation exchange capacity and therefore have a higher chemical interaction with fertilisers and are able to form soluble chelates of trace metals.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study is to develop a good {{solubilization}} vehicle for various poorly soluble drugs via <b>hydrotropic</b> solubilization. To achieve this goal, we discovered a new hydrotrope, DMBA and it showed more than 1000 -fold solubility enhancement of 13 poorly soluble compounds which have a broad range of hydrophobicity. A new <b>hydrotropic</b> polymer micelle, PEG-b-PVBODMBA containing DMBA as a hydrophobic core showed higher probucol loading content, higher solubility enhancement of various poorly soluble drugs, and higher physical stability in blood plasma than the previous <b>hydrotropic</b> polymer micelle, PEG-b-PVBODENA. Structural analysis and SIMCA multivariate analysis suggest that the number of aromatic rings may be the most effective property to the <b>hydrotropic</b> solubilization. And this characteristic of hydrotropes as a solubilizer is more effective when it existed as micelles in water after polymerization due to highly localized <b>hydrotropic</b> concentration inside of hydrophobic core of micelles.

However, <b>hydrotropic</b> response of the EGTA-treated roots was re-covered only when EGTA was replaced by a 10 mM calci-um (CaClj) solution prior to hydrostimulation. A calcium channel blocker, lanthanum (LaCl 3), also inhibited hydro-tropic curvature of ageotropum roots, whereas the hydro-tropic response was affected by neither nifedipine nor vera-pamil. Application of calcium ionophore, A 23187, resulted in a significant promotion of <b>hydrotropic</b> curvature.

Then different combinations of 2, 3 and 4 <b>hydrotropic</b> agents in different ratios were used to determine solubility, so that total concentration of <b>hydrotropic</b> agents was always 40 %. Highest solubility was obtained in solution of urea+sodium benzoate+sodium citrate at optimum ratio of 15 : 20 : 5. This optimized combination was utilized in preparing solid dispersions by common solvent technique using distilled water as solvent. Solid dispersions were evaluated for flow properties, XRD, DSC, SEM and were also compressed to form tablets. Dissolution studies of conventional and prepared tablets were done using USP Type II apparatus. It was concluded that the concept of mixed <b>hydrotropic</b> solid dispersion is novel, safe and cost-effective technique for enhancing bioavailability of poorly water-soluble drugs by dissolving drug in nonionized form. The magical enhancement in solubility of furosemide is clear indication of its potential to be used in future for other poorly water-soluble drugs in which low bioavailability is major concern...|$|E
30|$|The {{type and}} amount of salt play a {{significant}} role in developing viscoelastic solutions. The Clâˆ’ ions shrink the double layer and screen electrostatic repulsion around each head group, allowing surfactant molecules to aggregate and gradually transform into various micellar structures. To attain viscoelasticity, a higher concentration is required if using a weak, nonbinding salt, such as NaCl, since this type of salt shields the surface of the micelles unlike strong <b>hydrotropic</b> salts, for instance sodium salicylate and sodium tosylate, that penetrate into the micellar structure initiating viscoelasticity at lower salt concentrations (Trickett and Eastoe 2008; Hoffmann 1994; Calabrese et al. 2015). To define, <b>hydrotropic</b> salts are amphiphilic compounds that cannot form aggregates, like micelles, yet can solubilize organic compounds in water (Hill et al. 2014).|$|E

The effect of sodium salicylate (NaSal) on the assembly formation and transition of this cationic gemini surfactant solution was studied. Addition of NaSal induced rich aggregate morphologies in the C 12 C 2 C 12 (Et) system. The microstructures and rheological responses resulting from the addition of NaSal were studied systematically to explore the interaction between gemini surfactants and <b>hydrotropic</b> salts. The rich aggregation behavior {{can be attributed to}} the special molecular structure of the gemini surfactant and the appropriate interaction between the surfactant and NaSal. The study of gemini surfactant and <b>hydrotropic</b> salt interaction brings promise for applications in materials synthesis as soft templates...|$|E
40|$|Quantitative {{estimation}} of poorly water-soluble drugs involves use of organic solvents. Major drawbacks of organic solvents include high cost, volatility and toxicity. In the present investigation, <b>hydrotropic</b> solubilization is employed {{to enhance the}} aqueous solubilities of poorly water-soluble drugs metronidazole and miconazole nitrate in two-component pharmaceutical formulations for simultaneous spectrophotometric determination. Three novel, simple, accurate, sensitive and economical procedures employed are simultaneous equation method, absorbance ratio method, and dual wavelength method. All methods utilize solution containing 40 % urea and 10 % sodium benzoateas, <b>hydrotropic</b> solubilizing agent. The solubility of drugs increases more than 14 times in mixed <b>hydrotropic</b> solution as compared to solubility in distilled water. In the solution containing 40 % urea and 10 % sodium benzoate, metronidazole and miconazole nitrate show maximum absorbance at a wavelength of about 325 & 285 nm respectively and isobestic point is observed at 296 nm. The results of analysis have been validated statistically and by recovery studies. Parameters such as linearity, precision, accuracy, specificity and robustness were studied {{as reported in the}} International Conference on Harmonization guidelines. So this method can be successfully employed in the routine analysis of metronidazole and miconazole nitrate in bulk drug and dosage forms like ovules and gel...|$|E
40|$|Received on 15 - 08 - 2010 Accepted on 30 - 07 - 2010 Based on a {{large number}} of {{experiments}} on solubilization of poorly water-soluble drugs, the author is of the opinion that hydrotropy is another type of cosolvency and all water-soluble substances whether liquids, solids, or gases may act as solubilizers for poorly water-soluble drugs. In the present investigation, <b>hydrotropic</b> solution of sodium tartarate (2 M) was employed as solubilizing agent to solubilize the poorly water-soluble drug cefixime from fine powder of its tablet dosage form for spectrophotometric determination in ultraviolet region. Cefixime exhibits maximum absorbance at 288 nm and follows Beerâ€™s law in concentration range of 5 - 30 mcg/ml. Results of analysis were validated statistically and by recovery studies. The proposed method is new, simple, safe, environmentally friendly, accurate and cost-effective and can be successfully employed in routine to analyze cefixime tablets. <b>Hydrotropic</b> agent and commonly used tablet additives did not interfere in analysis. Just like cefixime as model drug, other poorly water-soluble drugs may be studied for the enhancement effect in solubility in <b>hydrotropic</b> solution of 2 M sodium tartarate for spectrophotometric analysis at a wavelength above 288 nm precluding the use of organic solvents (green chemistry...|$|E
40|$|Surface {{chemistry}} {{is of great}} importance in plant biomass engineering and applications. The surface chemical composition of biomass which includes lignin, carbohydrates and extractives influences its interactions with chemical agents, such as pulp processing/papermaking chemicals, or enzymes for different purposes. In this thesis, {{the changes in the}} surface chemical composition of lignocellulosic biomass after physical modification for the improvement of resulting paper properties and chemical treatment for the enhancement of enzymatic hydrolysis were investigated. Low consistency (LC) refining was used as physical treatment of bleached softwood and hardwood pulp samples, and the surface chemistry of refined samples was investigated. The refined pulp was analysed as whole pulp while the fines-free fibre samples were characterized separately. The fines produced in LCrefining contributed to an enlarged surface specific area as well as the change of surface coverage by lignin and extractives, as investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The surface coverage by lignin of the whole pulp decreased after refining while the surface coverage by extractives increased both for pine and eucalyptus. In the case of pine, the removal of fines resulted in reduction of the surface coverage by extractives, while the surface coverage by lignin increased on fibre sample (without fines). In the case of eucalyptus, the surface coverage by lignin of fibre samples decreased after the removal of fines. In addition, the surface distribution of carbohydrates, lignin and extractives of pine and eucalyptus samples was determined by Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). LC-refining increased the amounts of pentose, hexose and extractives on the surface of pine samples. ToF-SIMS also gave clear evidence about xylan deposition and reduction of surface lignin distribution on the fibre of eucalyptus. However, the changes in the surface chemical composition during the physical treatment has led to an increase in the adsorption of fluorescent whitening agents (FWAs) on fibres due to a combination of electro-static forces, specific surface area of fibres and hydrophobic interactions. Various physicochemical pretreatments were conducted on wood and non-wood biomass for enhancing enzymatic hydrolysis of polysaccharides, and the surface chemistry of the pretreated and enzymatically hydrolysed samples was investigated by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), XPS and ToF-SIMS. A hydrotrope was used as a relatively novel pretreatment technology both in the case of wood and non-wood biomass. For comparison, ionic liquid and hydrothermal pretreatments were applied on softwood and hardwood as well. Thus, XPS analysis showed that the surface lignin was more efficiently removed by <b>hydrotropic</b> pretreatment compared to ionic liquid or hydrothermal pretreatments. SEM analysis also found that already at room temperature the ionic liquid pretreatments were more effective in swelling the fibres compared with <b>hydrotropic</b> pretreatment at elevated temperatures. The enzymatic hydrolysis yield of hardwood was enhanced due to the decrease in surface coverage of lignin, which was induced by <b>hydrotropic</b> treatment. However, <b>hydrotropic</b> pretreatment was not appropriate for softwood because of the predominance of guaiacyl lignin structure in this material. In addition, the reduction of surface lignin and xylan during pretreatment and subsequent increase in cellulose hydrolysis by enzyme could be observed from ToF-SIMS results. The characterisation of the non-wood biomass (e. g. sugarcane bagasse and common reed) treated by <b>hydrotropic</b> method, alkaline and alkaline hydrogen peroxide pretreatments were carried out by XPS and ToF-SIMS. According to the results, the action for the removal of the surface lignin of non-wood biomass by <b>hydrotropic</b> pretreatment was more significant compared to alkaline and alkaline hydrogen peroxide pretreatments, although a higher total amount of lignin could be removed by alkaline and alkaline hydrogen peroxide pretreatment. Furthermore, xylan could be remarkably more efficiently removed by <b>hydrotropic</b> method. Therefore, the glucan yield achieved from <b>hydrotropic</b> treated sample was higher than that from samples treated with alkaline or alkaline hydrogen peroxide. Through the use of ToF-SIMS, the distribution and localization of lignin and carbohydrates on the surface of ignocelluloses during pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis could be detected, and xylan degradation during enzymatic hydrolysis could also be assessed. Thus, based on the results from XPS and ToF-SIMS, the mechanism of the <b>hydrotropic</b> pretreatment in improving the accessibility of enzymes to fibre and further ameliorating of the enzymatic saccharification could be better elucidated...|$|E
