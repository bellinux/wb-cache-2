2500|$|A show insider {{said that}} Lynsey's {{departure}} [...] "has {{got to be}} soap's best kept secret" [...] as people were unaware Hassan was due to leave. To prevent details of her exit surfacing, Hassan postponed her leaving party with the cast until her last episodes had aired. Hassan {{said that she was}} often asked if she planned to stay with the serial and although she already knew she was leaving she had to [...] "play along with things" [...] and keep her exit a secret to maintain the [...] "big shock factor" [...] she wanted. The actress had previously misled the press, telling a reporter from What's on TV that she was happy to stay at Hollyoaks for the foreseeable future. In May, when questioned by an OK! columnist whether she planned to stay with the serial, Hassan had replied that when her contract ran out in August she would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> happens.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, yes, certainly," [...] said Septimus. But Septimus did {{not quite}} {{understand}} why it was that they should <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> {{the young man was}} about.|$|E
6000|$|... "Too bad! Too bad!" [...] {{he muttered}} to himself. [...] "If ol' Granny Fox isn't {{smart enough to}} get Reddy enough to eat, Ah'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> we-alls can do. Ah cert'nly will." ...|$|E
60|$|At last Jerry {{could stand}} it no longer. He just <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> was going on. He {{slipped into the}} water and swam over to where the water was muddiest. Just as he got there up came Paddy.|$|R
2500|$|Mamata Banerjee, {{the chief}} {{minister}} of West Bengal {{and the leader}} of the Trinamool Congress, announced her opposition to retail reform, claiming [...] "Some people might support it, but I do not support it. You see America is America … and India is India. One <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> one’s capacity is".|$|R
60|$|We {{have now}} {{disposed}} of the Short Parliament. We <b>have</b> next <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> memorable things were {{done by the}} Long one.|$|R
6000|$|... "First off we {{must tell}} Jip," [...] Seth replied promptly. [...] "To-morrow mornin' you an' Bill will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> {{can be done}} with Sam. It won't do to let him keep on the way he was goin' before we sent him off." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hello! There's a nice {{big piece}} of bark over there that {{looks as if it}} ought to have a dozen fat beetles under it. It's great fun to pull over pieces of bark and see fat beetles run all ways at once. I'll just <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> is under that piece." ...|$|E
50|$|We first <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> has not {{happened}} in these two years {{and then we will}} determine if he’s a hero or not. Iran must determine if his claims about being kidnapped were correct or not.|$|E
6000|$|... "After a piece," [...] Drummond resumed, [...] "I got his figure {{against the}} sky, and reckoned, because he looked short, he was wading in a pool. Felt I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> {{he was looking}} for, but knew I couldn't get near him along the bank. There are patches of gravel among the rocks, and the brush grows pretty thick where it gets {{the light at the}} edge of a wood." ...|$|R
5000|$|I asked Paul Simon if {{they were}} still {{charging}} the $1,250 we paid them to play and {{he said they were}} getting about four times that much then. Then I asked him why he hadn't pulled out, and he said he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> a city named Saginaw looked like. Apparently, he liked it; he wrote 'America' while he was here, including that line about taking four days to hitchhike from Saginaw.|$|R
60|$|The spot reached, the Frenchman gazed {{around with}} evident dismay. Probably he <b>had</b> {{expected}} <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> been {{left of the}} pack-train still there.|$|R
5000|$|... "Everybody’s clear that, {{currently}} at least, Turkey is {{moving away from}} a European perspective,” European Commissioner Johannes Hahn, who oversees EU membership bids, said in May 2017. [...] "The focus of our relationship {{has to be something}} else. We <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> could be done in the future, {{to see if we can}} restart some kind of cooperation." ...|$|E
5000|$|... [...] Foreign {{minister}} Per Stig Møller {{denounced the}} coup, calling it [...] "banana republic-like, {{that the military}} seizes power while the PM {{is out of the}} country. But it's not over yet, there's no conclusion yet. Thaksin has a lot of support outside Bangkok. So we'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> happens when he returns home. I just hope it does not end in violence. I hope that democracy will be re-established in Thailand." ...|$|E
5000|$|During an {{interview}} for her experience at the show, Aslanidou had reported that when she got the proposition she had fear of appearing on the television. She also said about teaching the contestants that it's partly hard as it's not easy as you have to pass experiences, values and ideals that she also got from bigger artists. [...] "Each child has different needs ... you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> the needs to listen so they can stand out", she reportedly said.|$|E
6000|$|... 'And so you {{actually}} despatched my Lord to eat humble pie in my name. You might <b>have</b> waited <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> I {{thought of the}} process.' ...|$|R
60|$|So, {{when he read}} Dolly's card, {{being by}} nature suspicious, he felt sure the child <b>had</b> called <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> she {{could get out of}} him.|$|R
60|$|Augusta {{took the}} document, and <b>having</b> looked <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> it was, shivered {{as she did}} so. It brought the whole thing back so painfully to her mind.|$|R
5000|$|I {{did a great}} lap, but it was {{not enough}} to be on pole position. Today, we lacked a bit of speed {{compared}} to our main rivals but the race is very long and, over a distance, we know we can be very competitive and therefore we are capable of fighting for the win ... Then, we will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> the various strategy choices are and obviously, how the weather evolves. If it was to rain, the race could be turned into a lottery. Felipe Massa, following the third qualifying session.|$|E
5000|$|In September 2008, Burns was in {{line for}} a crack at the vacant Commonwealth title, a belt which had been given up by Londoner Kevin Mitchell. The {{challenge}} took place at the York Hall in Bethnal Green and saw Burns outpoint the Ghanaian Osumana Akaba over 12 rounds. The fight, which was taken with only weeks notice after the original main event on the card was cancelled, propelled Burns into the championship frame. Speaking of his future ambitions Burns said; [...] "There is only one fight I want at the moment. That fight would be the current British champion Kevin Mitchell. He recently has been injured, and won't be back until December so we'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> happens".|$|E
5000|$|Demonstrations of {{all sorts}} occur on a regular bases - less than common in the region. The laws {{regulating}} rallies and demonstrations predate the reforms; a bill {{for a new one}} has not yet been passed by parliament. As is the case with press freedom, a general liberal practise without the necessary legal foundation can be assessed. Normally neither the government nor the security forces interfere with demonstrations - unless feeling threatened. This lack of legal certainty is obviously wanted: ‘You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> we practice, not what is written in laws. Our practise is very liberal. One also has to see in which part of the world we’re living’ says the then head of the central informatics organisation and now minister of the royal court, Sheikh Mohammed bin Atiyatallah Al Khalifa.|$|E
6000|$|... "And mine," [...] he acknowledged. [...] "We <b>have</b> now <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> {{will become}} of a fat and prosperous country with a semi-obsolete fleet and a comic opera army." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, I {{believe she}} is quite right,' he said. 'She says {{you ought to}} {{undertake}} nothing till yon <b>have</b> <b>had</b> time <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> leisure you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> give us.' ...|$|R
60|$|In {{a minute}} or two Aunt Matilda made her {{appearance}} at the door. She had heard the barking and the screaming, and <b>had</b> come <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> was the matter.|$|R
5000|$|... "After losing {{half the}} morning with a {{hydraulic}} problem, we were {{not sure what to}} expect in qualifying, as I did not have time to run new tyres in the morning. It turned out that the car was well set-up for qualifying. I do not expect to see a repeat of Canada tomorrow, as our tyres are very good and consistent here. I think we have the better tyre for the weekend, but we will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> happens. I am not ruling out McLaren, because we have seen them struggle in qualifying before and then they are strong in the race. We developed the car well in the morning and during qualifying we made a further set-up change in between the runs and that made me quicker." [...] Michael Schumacher, following the qualifying session.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{original}} theatrical release, after the monster-killing climax, there's another by-the-pool-party scene (same pool {{as seen in}} the beginning of the film, but is supposed to be another party) in which Maggie Cheung's character (kind of) makes up with Dr. Yuen. Then, we cut to {{the original}} party-scene that starts off the movie with Dr. Yuen, Wisely, Ni Kuang (the real author of the two pulp-novel series) and a bunch of beautiful girls. As the author finishes telling the movie's story to the girls, one of them asks if he has another adventure story to tell. The author replies, [...] "Well, we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> exciting adventures Dr. Yuen and Wisely are going to have." [...] The two main characters come into frame, toast and finish their drink. Freeze-frame, then comes the end-title music and credits.|$|E

5000|$|In the Michel Government {{formed in}} October 2014, she became Minister of Social Affairs and Health. When taking the oath, she {{described}} the portfolio as [...] "her dream". Critics have said {{that she does not}} set the right example as Health Minister due to her obesity, and she has answered that [...] "I know I'm not a model but you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what's</b> inside, not the packaging." [...] In the position, she was involved in coordinating the Belgian response to the Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa.|$|R

60|$|I kind of dodged, and the boot-jack {{broke the}} looking-glass. I could <b>have</b> waited <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> became {{of the other}} {{missiles}} if I <b>had</b> wanted <b>to,</b> but I took no interest in such things.|$|R
5000|$|He {{went on to}} {{describe}} his role {{as president of the}} Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue, saying, [...] "you have to remember that interreligious dialogue is not dialogue between religions. It's dialogue between believers. It's not a theological, philosophical exercise. First you have to accept {{that we live in a}} world that's plural: culture, religion, education, scientific research. Every human being has a religious dimension. Between believers we try first of all to know each other. And the first thing you have to do is to proclaim your faith because you can not build that dialogue on ambiguity. When we are understood, we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> separates us and what unites us and to put those commonalities at the service of society. Dialogue is not for the consumption of the community. It's at the service of society. And remember that man doesn't live only on bread. There are spiritual dimensions. Believers have a special role to play in the public dialogue".|$|E
5000|$|... "Our Mayor {{opened a}} can of worms, who knows why?

5000|$|On 18 August 2005, {{officials}} of the FLP and the National Federation Party (NFP) held what they described as a [...] "courtesy call". Preferential voting was among the topics discussed, but no serious negotiations were entered into, with both parties indicating that {{such a move would}} be premature. Several major news services reported in early September, however, that the two parties were close to reaching a deal. Comments by FLP officials led credence to these rumours, but on 7 September, the NFP President, Raman Pratap Singh, denied that any such agreement was imminent, stating that the NFP had held no talks with FLP officials on any cooperative arrangements. NFP secretary Pramod Rae thought likewise: [...] "We are open to discussion," [...] he said. [...] "But at this stage there is nothing. We will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> their party policies are, if they are similar then we will share preferences." [...] On 3 October, however, Rae said that although a final decision had not been made, sentiment within the NFP was leaning towards contesting the 2006 election alone, rather than aligning itself with either the FLP or the ruling SDL.|$|E
6000|$|... "The other fellow would seize it now," [...] Carlyon {{said with}} eagerness. [...] "If I {{could get the}} money, I'd <b>have</b> time <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> could be done, and {{something}} might turn up. Will you introduce me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{continued}} Mr. Trigger, [...] "that {{being the}} case, {{of course we}} <b>have</b> got <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> will be our best plan of action. I suppose, Sir Thomas, you are not altogether indifferent about the money." ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe premise {{from which}} we started our study implies that the best impact of {{teaching}} {{is represented by the}} involvement of the main sensory systems. Thus, the person who learns <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> he learns (maps, graphics), <b>has</b> <b>to</b> hear what he learns (the teacher's voice) and <b>has</b> <b>to</b> experiment what he learns (by practice). Our point of view is that the favourite sensory system determines the learning style. In order to be efficient, education should represent a multisensory experience because what motivates learning is feeling in a good mood. A challenge that we will develop in the following lines...|$|R
