5|$|In 1932, Bethe {{accepted}} an appointment {{as an assistant}} professor at the University of Tübingen, where Hans Geiger was the professor of experimental physics. One of the first laws passed by the new National Socialist government was the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service. Due to his Jewish background, Bethe was dismissed from his job at the University, which was a government post. Geiger refused to help, but Sommerfeld immediately gave Bethe back his fellowship at Munich. Sommerfeld spent much of the summer term of 1933 finding places <b>for</b> <b>Jewish</b> students and colleagues.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1929, Krichell {{discovered}} Hank Greenberg while on a scouting trip in Massachusetts. Krichell believed Greenberg {{would be the next}} Lou Gehrig. Krichell offered Greenberg a $10,000 contract ($ in 2010) on the spot based on his potential and knowing the Yankees were looking <b>for</b> <b>Jewish</b> players to increase their Jewish fanbase. Greenberg discussed the deal with his father but declined it because he knew his opportunities would be limited by the presence of Gehrig as first baseman.

5|$|Jewish {{feminism}} {{is a movement}} that seeks to improve the religious, legal, and social status of women within Judaism and to open up new opportunities for religious experience and leadership <b>for</b> <b>Jewish</b> women. The main issues for early Jewish feminists in these movements were the exclusion from the all-male prayer group or minyan, the exemption from positive time-bound mitzvot, and women's inability to function as witnesses and to initiate divorce. Many Jewish women have become leaders of feminist movements throughout their history.|$|E

When Truman was six, his parents moved to Independence, so he could attend the Presbyterian Church Sunday School. Truman did not attend a traditional school until he was eight. While living in Independence, {{he served as a}} Shabbos goy <b>for</b> <b>Jewish</b> neighbors, doing tasks for them on Shabbat that their tradition prevented them doing on that day.|$|E

5|$|The Hotel Metropole was {{transformed}} into Gestapo headquarters in Vienna in April 1938. With a staff of 900 (80 percent of whom were recruited from the Austrian police), {{it was the largest}} Gestapo office outside Berlin. An estimated 50,000 people were interrogated or tortured there. The Gestapo in Vienna was headed by Franz Josef Huber, who also served as chief of the Central Agency <b>for</b> <b>Jewish</b> Emigration in Vienna. Although its de facto leaders were Adolf Eichmann and later Alois Brunner, Huber was nevertheless responsible for the mass deportation of Austrian Jews.|$|E
5|$|After an {{unremarkable}} school career, Eichmann briefly {{worked for}} his father's mining company in Austria, {{where the family}} had moved in 1914. He worked as a travelling oil salesman beginning in 1927, and joined both the Nazi Party and the SS in 1932. After returning to Germany in 1933, he joined the Sicherheitsdienst (SD; Security Service), where he was appointed {{head of the department}} responsible <b>for</b> <b>Jewish</b> affairs—especially emigration, which the Nazis encouraged through violence and economic pressure. After the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, Eichmann and his staff arranged for Jews to be concentrated in ghettos in major cities with the expectation that they would be transported either farther east or overseas. Eichmann drew up plans for a Jewish reservation, first at Nisko in south-east Poland and later in Madagascar, but neither of these plans were ever carried out.|$|E
5|$|After the Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel on 14 May 1948 Haifa {{became the}} gateway <b>for</b> <b>Jewish</b> {{immigration}} into Israel. During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, the neighborhoods of Haifa were sometimes contested. After the war, Jewish immigrants were settled in new neighborhoods, among them Kiryat Hayim, Ramot Remez, Ramat Shaul, Kiryat Sprinzak, and Kiryat Eliezer. Bnei Zion Hospital (formerly Rothschild Hospital) and the Central Synagogue in Hadar Hacarmel date from this period. In 1953, {{a master plan}} was created for transportation and the future architectural layout. In 1959, a group of Sephardi and Mizrahi Jews, mostly Moroccan Jews, rioted in Wadi Salib, claiming the state was discriminating against them. Their demand for “bread and work” was directed at the state institutions and what they viewed as an Ashkenazi elite in the Labor Party and the Histadrut.|$|E

5|$|In 1938, Eichmann {{was posted}} to Vienna to help organise Jewish {{emigration}} from Austria, which {{had just been}} integrated into the Reich through the Anschluss. Jewish community organisations were placed under supervision of the SD and tasked with encouraging and facilitating Jewish emigration. Funding came from money seized from other Jewish people and organisations, as well as donations from overseas, which were placed under SD control. Eichmann was promoted to SS-Obersturmführer (first lieutenant) in July 1938, and appointed to the Central Agency <b>for</b> <b>Jewish</b> Emigration in Vienna, created in August. By {{the time he left}} Vienna in May 1939, nearly 100,000 Jews had left Austria legally, and many more had been smuggled out to Palestine and elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|In February 1942, the Home Army Operational Command's Office of Information and Propaganda {{set up a}} Section <b>for</b> <b>Jewish</b> Affairs, {{directed}} by Henryk Woliński. This section collected data about {{the situation of the}} Jewish population, drafted reports, and sent information to London. It also centralized contacts between Polish and Jewish military organizations. The Home Army also supported the Relief Council for Jews in Poland (codenamed Żegota) as well as the formation of organizations of Jewish resistance under Nazi rule in Poland. One Home Army member, Witold Pilecki, was the only person to volunteer to be imprisoned at Auschwitz. The information that he gathered proved crucial in convincing the Western Allies about the fate of the Jewish population. In 1942 the Home Army sent Jan Karski on a secret mission to personally carry the first eyewitness accounts of the Holocaust to the mostly disbelieving Winston Churchill and Franklin Roosevelt. Before leaving, Karski visited the Warsaw Ghetto and a Nazi concentration camp.|$|E
5|$|The word kosher is {{also part}} of some common product names. Sometimes it is used as an {{abbreviation}} of koshering, meaning the process for making something kosher; for example, kosher salt is a form of salt with irregularly shaped crystals, making it particularly suitable for preparing meat according to the rules of kashrut, because the increased surface area of the crystals absorbs blood more effectively. At other times it is used as a synonym <b>for</b> <b>Jewish</b> tradition; for example, a kosher dill pickle is simply a pickle made in the traditional manner of Jewish New York City pickle makers, using a generous addition of garlic to the brine, and is not necessarily compliant with the traditional Jewish food laws.|$|E

5|$|Within {{three weeks}} of the liberation of Mauthausen, Wiesenthal had {{prepared}} a list of around a hundred names of suspected Nazi war criminals—mostly guards, camp commandants, {{and members of the}} Gestapo—and presented it to a War Crimes office of the American Counterintelligence Corps at Mauthausen. He worked as an interpreter, accompanying officers who were carrying out arrests, though he was still very frail. When Austria was partitioned in July 1945, Mauthausen fell into the Soviet-occupied zone, so the American War Crimes Office was moved to Linz. Wiesenthal went with them, and was housed in a displaced persons camp. He served as vice-chairman of the area's Jewish Central Committee, an organisation that attempted to arrange basic care <b>for</b> <b>Jewish</b> refugees and tried to help people gather information about their missing family members.|$|E
5|$|After a posting in Prague {{to assist}} in setting up an {{emigration}} office there, Eichmann was transferred to Berlin in October 1939 to command the Central Office <b>for</b> <b>Jewish</b> Emigration for the entire Reich under Heinrich Müller, head of the Gestapo. He was immediately assigned to organise the deportation of 70,000 to 80,000 Jews from Ostrava district in Moravia and Katowice district in the recently annexed portion of Poland. On his own initiative, Eichmann also laid plans to deport Jews from Vienna. Under the Nisko Plan, Eichmann chose Nisko as the location for a new transit camp where Jews would be temporarily housed before being deported elsewhere. In {{the last week of}} October 1939, 4,700 Jews were sent to the area by train and were essentially left to fend for themselves in an open meadow with no water and little food. Barracks were planned but never completed. Many of the deportees were driven by the SS into Soviet-occupied territory and others were eventually placed in a nearby labour camp. The operation soon was called off, partly because Hitler decided the required trains were better used for military purposes for the time being. Meanwhile, as part of Hitler's long-range resettlement plans, hundreds of thousands of ethnic Germans were being transported into the annexed territories, and ethnic Poles and Jews were being moved further east, particularly into the General Government.|$|E
