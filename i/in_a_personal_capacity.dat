40|$|With over $ 200 {{million in}} annual {{spending}} by American organizations on diversity training, diversity conferences are increasingly becoming vehicles for information exchange and discussion on best practices in terms of diversity issues. Despite the substantial allocation to diversity training and diversity programs, there remains <b>a</b> gap <b>in</b> identifying where theoretical groundings fit in the dynamic of diversity, {{and particularly in the}} development and implementation of diversity training. This case study was an investigation into the roles theoretical groundings played in diversity training, particularly during the design, development and implementation of a university diversity conference. Using a mixed methods approach, the research compared and contrasted theoretical groundings that diversity practitioners valued <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> and professional <b>capacity</b> with the proposals they submitted to present at a diversity conference. Contexts from multiple perspectives – the university itself, the socio-cultural milieu of the university, the region and the country, and <b>a</b> dichotomy between <b>personal</b> and professional beliefs held significant influence on this diversity conference, and what types of sessions were accepted and presented at the event. This study affirmed that diversity consists of numerous layers, and involves many actors – practitioners, organizations, participants and researchers. This myriad of components and elements corresponds to different implications for different points of view, but focuses on how the role of theoretical groundings in diversity training bridges the gap between the theory and practice. i...|$|R
40|$|M. Ed. The {{primary purpose}} of this enquiry was to {{discover}} {{whether or not a}} relation exists between how school counselors’ in training, enrolled <b>in</b> <b>an</b> Honours programme relates to the proposed theoretical model of counselor development by Skovholt and Ronnestad (1992). The three-stage model assumes that counselors, who engage with a registered educational counselor training programme, progressively move through the incremental stages transitioning towards personal and professional development. A second purpose was to address the paucity of research, specifically in the context of South Africa, addressing the personal and professional development literature of registered counselors <b>in</b> training. <b>A</b> qualitative research methodology was used to collect data, which was derived from 3 purposefully-spaced semi-structured interviews with 5 participants across their training year. Categories were identified through the process of open coding, resulting in the emergence of 3 themes – namely: the beginning school counselor, the practicing school counselor and the emerging helping professional - emphasising the process of school counselor development. It is evident from this study that a relation exists between that of the proposed theoretical model and the honours school counselor training programme in which the participants were involved. It is recommended that the honours school counselor training programme offered by the Department of Educational Psychology at the University of Johannesburg be refined, by acknowledging Skovholt and Ronnestad’s (1992) theoretical model, which emphasises the processes of counselor development. By documenting the training experiences of the participants <b>in</b> <b>a</b> school counselor programme, insight has been gained into the processes underway for <b>a</b> school counselor <b>in</b> training, as they develop <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> and professional <b>capacity...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present Bioethics, {{particularly}} its educational aspect, as a way to promote moral and democratic competencies, thus improving <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> <b>capacity</b> to face not only bioethical issues but also broader ethical, moral and even political problems. We believe that we should invest educative efforts on the affective and cognitive aspects of moral behavior if we want to promote the capacity to make moral judgments and act according to them. In pluralistic democratic societies, it is necessary to also promote the capacity to speak up and listen to arguments as a means to deal with moral problems. Any Bioethics which does not also include an educational action is prone to lose most of its significance. We propose that Bioethics should be led to an educational turn, focusing on the construction of an educative toolbox composed of interventional and evaluative instruments...|$|R

In this paper we use socio-cultural theory and Foucault to explain how pupils´ independency is transformed into something else in their work. Our results derive from analyses of filmed sessions and entries in the pupils´ logbooks. Our findings demonstrate that the pupils´ definitions of independence {{differ from those of}} the course plan in several aspects: i) the use of certain resources is not considered to show lack of independence, ii) doing things yourself is considered being most independent and iii) to follow instructions, even if this means violating your unique personal thought, is considered a prerequisite for passing/getting good grades and as such a necessary adaption to the school context, sooner than a sign of dependency. Consequently we argue that pupil independency should be regarded as a phenomenon chiseled out within a community of practice rather than <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> <b>capacity...</b>|$|R
