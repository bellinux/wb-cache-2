Darkness came on shortly after six o'clock, and the sultry weather {{began to look}} ominous, with a huge, angry, black nimbus discharging itself into the glassy livid sea northwards. I suggested landing, but Lángobúmo was positive that the storm had passed westwards, and he objected, with some reason, that in the outer gloom the boat might be dashed to pieces. As we had not even a stone for an anchor, the plea proved, valid. We guided ourselves, by the fitful flashes of forked and sheet lightning combined, towards a ghostly point, whose deeper blackness silhouetted it against the shades. Suddenly the boat's head was turned inland; a huge breaker, foaming along our gunwales, drove us forwards like the <b>downwards</b> <b>motion</b> of a [...] "swing-swong," [...] and, before we knew where we were, an ugly little bar had been crossed {{on the top of}} the curling scud. We could see the forest on both sides, but there was not light enough to trace the river line; I told Hotaloya to tumble out; [...] "Plenty shark here, mas'r," [...] was the only answer. We lost nearly half an hour of most valuable time in pottering and groping before all had landed.|$|E

40|$|Cloud {{droplet size}} {{distributions}} (CDSDs), which {{are related to}} cloud albedo and lifetime, are usually broader in warm clouds than predicted from adiabatic parcel calculations. We investigate a mechanism for the CDSD broadening using a Lagrangian bin-microphysics cloud parcel model that considers the condensational growth of cloud droplets formed on polydisperse, sub-micrometer aerosols in an adiabatic cloud parcel that undergoes vertical oscillations, such as those due to cloud circulations or turbulence. Results show that the CDSD can be broadened during condensational growth {{as a result of}} Ostwald ripening amplified by droplet deactivation and reactivation, which is consistent with Korolev (1995). The relative roles of the solute effect, curvature effect, deactivation and reactivation on CDSD broadening are investigated. Deactivation of smaller cloud droplets, which is due to the combination of curvature and solute effects in the downdraft region, enhances the growth of larger cloud droplets and thus contributes particles to the larger size end of the CDSD. Droplet reactivation, which occurs in the updraft region, contributes particles to the smaller size end of the CDSD. In addition, we find that growth of the largest cloud droplets strongly depends on the residence time of cloud droplet in the cloud rather than the magnitude of local variability in the supersaturation fluctuation. This is because the environmental saturation ratio is strongly buffered by smaller cloud droplets. Two necessary conditions for this CDSD broadening, which generally occur in the atmosphere, are: (1) droplets form on polydisperse aerosols of varying hygroscopicity and (2) the cloud parcel experiences upwards and <b>downwards</b> <b>motions.</b> Therefore we expect that this mechanism for CDSD broadening is possible in real clouds. Our results also suggest {{it is important to consider}} both curvature and solute effects before and after cloud droplet activation in a cloud model. The importance of this mechanism compared with other mechanisms on cloud properties should be investigated through in-situ measurements and 3 -D dynamic models...|$|R

40|$|AbstractFlow {{separation}} {{control over}} a three-dimensional contour bump using jet in a Mach 1. 9 supersonic free-stream has been experimentally investigated using a transonic/supersonic wind tunnel. Jet total pressure {{in the range of}} 0 – 4 bar was blowing at the valley of the contour bump. Schlieren photography, surface oil flow visualisation and particle image velocimetry measurements were employed for flow visualisation and diagnostics. Experimental results show that blowing jet at the valley of the contour bump can hinder the formation and distort the spanwise vortices. The blowing jet can also reduce the extent of flow separation appears downstream of the bump crest. It was observed that this approach of flow control is more effective when high jet total pressure is employed. It is believed that a pressure gradient is generated {{as a result of the}} interaction between the flow downstream of the bump crest and the jet induced shock leads to the <b>downwards</b> flow <b>motion</b> around the bump valley...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} fully nonlinear two-dimensional numerical {{calculations of}} the free-surface deformations of initially calm water {{caused by the}} forced motion of totally or partially submerged horizontal circular cylinders. The paper considers the following. (i) Totally submerged cylinders moving with constant velocity in vertical, hori-zontal or combined motions. Results are compared with the small-time asymptotic solution obtained by Tyvand & Miloh in 1995. Their results, which are taken to third-order (which is when gravity terms rst appear in the expansions), are in ex-cellent agreement with the numerical calculations for small times; beyond this only the numerical method gives accurate results until the free surface breaks or the cylin-der emerges from the free surface. Breaking can occur during exit due to strongly negative pressures arising on the cylinder surface, or during the <b>downwards</b> <b>motion</b> causing a free-surface depression which closes up rapidly, forming splashes. Down-wards motion is also shown to give rise to high-frequency waves in some cases. (ii) The free-surface deformations, pressures and forces acting on a cylinder in vertical or oblique forced motion during engulfment when it submerges from being initially half-submerged. The initial stages, when the cylinder still pierces the free surface, specify the initial conditions for a separate program for a completely sub-merged body, thereby allowing complete engulfment to be studied. The free surface closes up violently {{over the top of}} the cylinder resulting in jet flow, which, while dicult to handle numerically, has been shown to be insignicant for the bulk flow and the cylinder pressures and forces. 1...|$|E
40|$|We report {{results of}} long {{timescale}} adaptive kinetic Monte Carlo simulations aimed at identifying possible molecular reordering processes on both proton-disordered and ordered (Fletcher) basal plane (0001) surfaces of hexagonal ice. The simulations {{are based on}} a force field for flexible molecules and span a time interval of up to 50 μs at a temperature of 100 K, which represents a lower bound to the temperature range of Earth's atmosphere. Additional calculations using both density functional theory and an ab initio based polarizable potential function are performed to test and refine the force field predictions. Several distinct processes are found to occur readily even at this low temperature, including concerted reorientation (flipping) of neighboring surface molecules, which changes the pattern of dangling H-atoms, and the formation of interstitial defects by the <b>downwards</b> <b>motion</b> of upper-bilayer molecules. On the proton-disordered surface, one major surface roughening process is observed that significantly disrupts the crystalline structure. Despite much longer simulation time, such roughening processes are not observed on the highly ordered Fletcher surface which is energetically more stable because of smaller repulsive interaction between neighboring dangling H-atoms. However, a more localized process takes place on the Fletcher surface involving a surface molecule transiently leaving its lattice site. The flipping process provides a facile pathway of increasing proton-order and stabilizing the surface, supporting a predominantly Fletcher-like ordering of low-temperature ice surfaces, but our simulations also show that proton- disordered patches on the surface may induce significant local reconstructions. Further, a subset of the molecules on the Fletcher surface are susceptible to forming interstitial defects. Comment: 27 pages, 7 figure...|$|E

40|$|Gravity wave {{effects in}} the nocturnal thermospheric F-region domain are seldom {{detected}} in the intertropical region by optical (airglow) techniques, especially during geomagnetically quiet times, {{in part because the}} low inclination of the magnetic field, as opposed to the case of the mid-latitude region, does not favor significant vertical excursions of ionospheric plasma in response to meridional winds. Such difficulty in detecting gravity wave signatures in the F-region by means of optical techniques tends to increase in the absence of geomagnetic storms {{because of the lack of}} strong forcing mechanisms necessary to generate high intensity gravity waves. The purpose of this work is to show that during the quiet day of 9 August 1999, the Terminator may have been a source region of wave-like disturbances in the nocturnal F-region at the low-latitude station Cachoeira Paulista (22 ° 412 ̆ 7 S; 45 ° 00 W, dip 30 °). A digital all-sky OI 630 nm imager system located at that station has shown propagating wave-like spatial structures in the airglow intensity near the Terminator. This observation supports a previous study on the evidence of the presence of gravity waves during the post-sunset period at the same location by means of a scanning photometer system (1997, Sobral, J. Atmos. Terr. Phys. 59, 1611 – 1623). The absence of range-type spread-F as monitored by a local digisonde and the absence of radio wave scintillation as monitored by a local GPS receiver, excludes the hypothesis that the wave-like airglow structures are associated with the occurrence of the ionospheric plasma bubbles. <b>Downwards</b> <b>motion</b> of the iso-density real height contours at 22. 0 ms− 1 and 33. 1 ms− 1 are observed.

40|$|The {{effect of}} thick carpet on the {{accuracy}} of bathroom scales was investigated using two analogue scales and two digital strain gauge scales. A mass range of 0 Kg – 104 Kg was used. Loading history {{was found to have}} a significant effect on analogue scales, and the experiments were designed with this in mind. The mean spring constant of a Hanson analogue scale system was found to be 12. 13 ± 0. 30 KNm- 1; this compares with a value of 36. 52 ± 1. 34 KNm- 1 for a Hanson strain gauge system. Of the soft surfaces studied, only thick carpet (10 - 12 %) and foam (8 - 10 %) caused greater than 2 % increase in analogue scale readings. These surfaces did not cause a substantial effect when placed only under the corners of the scale. Supporting the base of the scale on a hard surface caused a 13 % increase in readings; by contrast, tilting the scale and moving the centre of mass on the scale had very little effect. Deflection of the base of the Hanson analogue scale was studied across the mass range using a DTI. The most deflection was found at the rear of the scale, for both analogue (− 2. 896 ± 0. 021 mm) and digital (− 0. 752 ± 0. 012 mm). Deflection of the scale base was found to be principally due to stress incurred from supporting the weight at the corners of the scale. Readings on a hard surface with the base supported showed no excess deflection of the test plate compared to hard surface readings. Since little movement of the test spring was found, it was concluded that there must be no substantial change in moment of the lever system when the base is supported.

40|$|We {{carried out}} a study of {{seismicity}} and ground deformation occurred on Mount Etna volcano {{after the end of}} 2002 - 2003 eruption and before the onset of 2004 - 2005 eruption, recorded by the permanent local seismic network run by Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia - Sezione di Catania and by geodetic surveys carried out in July 2003 and July 2004 on the GPS network. We provide a description of seismicity rate and main seismic swarms which occurred during the investigated period. Mostly of the earthquakes are clustered in two main clusters located on the north-eastern (E-W aligned and above the sea level) and south-eastern (NW-SE aligned and from 3 to 8 Km below the sea level) sectors of the volcano. To better understand the kinematic processes of the volcano, 3 D relocation were used to compute fault plane solutions and a selected dataset was inverted to determine stress and strain tensors. The focal solutions on the north-eastern sector show clear left-lateral kinematics along an E-W fault plane, in good agreement with the Pernicana fault kinematics. Focal solutions on the south-eastern sector show a main left-lateral kinematics along a NW-SE fault plane evidencing a roughly E-W oriented compression coupled with a N-S extension. Surface ground deformation affecting Mt Etna and measured by GPS surveys highlights a marked inflation during the same period, mainly visible on the western and upper sectors of the volcano; on the contrary, its eastern side shows an exceptionally strong seawards and <b>downwards</b> <b>motion</b> with displacements ranging from 5 up to 10 cm along the coastline. The 2 D geodetic strain tensor distribution was calculated on a 1. 5 km spaced grid, in order to detail the strain axes orientation above the entire GPS network. The results of the 2 D geodetic strain calculation evidenced the very strong extension (mainly along an- ENE-WSW axis) of the summit area that was already considered as the cause of the 2004 - 2005 eruption; this main ENE-WSW extension continues throughout the eastern flank, but here coupled with a WNW-ESE contraction, meaning a right-lateral shear along a NW-SE oriented fault plane. The opposite deformation of the eastern sector of the volcano, as measured by seismicity and ground deformation has to be interpreted by considering the different depths of the two signals. Seismic activity along the NW-SE alignment is, in fact, located between 3 and 8 km b. s. l. and it is then affected by the very strong additional E-W compression induced by the inflating source located by inverting GPS data just westwards and at the same depth. Ground deformation measured by GPS at the surface, on the contrary, is mainly affected by the shallower dynamics of the eastern flank, fastly moving towards East that produces an opposite (extension) E-W strain. It is also meaningful, confirming the decoupling between the surface and deep strain, that all the seismicity of the south-eastern sector lies beneath the sliding plane already modeled by geodetic data for the same time interval and for the 2004 - 2006 period and also beneath the deeper one previously modeled during the 1993 - 1998 period when the eastern flank velocity was much slower...|$|E

40|$|Many {{creatures in}} nature have evolved {{the ability to}} fly and some seem to do so {{effortlessly}} with captivating movement. The flight characteristics of these natural fliers have greatly fascinated biologists and engineers {{for a long time}} that to this day researchers continue to actively work in this field of science with the aim of one day developing a Flapping Wing Micro Aerial Vehicle (FWMAV) which can replicate the flight of nature's creatures. These types of autonomous robotic vehicles can fulfil tasks which are not suitable for manned vehicles especially when risks to human safety are present. Flight techniques such as control, stability and manoeuvrability are flight characteristics which an FWMAV must possess if such a device is employed for various rescue missions. With this in mind symmetrical and asymmetrical wing motions are studied experimentally in the current research programme in such a way that the methodology employed for this type of flight can be implemented into future FWMAVs. In summary, the research performed during the course of this project produced innovative results in the form of the creation of two micro air vehicles with a thorough explanation of the development process and examination under experimental tests. Various parameters were analysed during the experimental tests such as force, moment, power and wing position measurements. The tests were performed on both models, one of which has the functionality to perform asymmetrical flapping and successfully generate moments about two different axes. A unique wing motion which favoured the upward vertical force production was investigated under various scenarios. The wings keep a fixed angle of attack during the <b>downwards</b> flapping <b>motion</b> and are allowed to passively rotate during the upstroke motion. Computational simulations were performed to investigate the hovering fluid dynamics, forces, moments and power required for various chordwise rotational positions and durations of wing rotation. This investigation aided in understanding the full effects of altering these parameters under hovering conditions for a rectangular wing. The valuable results found from this research program provide a better insight into various topics involving micro air vehicles in addition to developing future flight worthy insect inspired vehicles...|$|R

The empirical part of the study involved 338 students from seven different groups.

In addition. data was collected from a sub-sample. by means of computer games using a screen 'object' obeying Newtonian Mechanics. in a frictional and a non-frictional 'environment'. under the control of the subject. Difficulties in interpreting the last kind of data led to the main study being focussed on the results of the questionnaire. Some results from the computer games are however presented. They are mainly concerned with students' performance when playing in a frictional versus non-frictional 'environment'. Results suggest a better students' performance when playing in a frictional 'environment'. Results obtained with the questionnaire concern: [a) differences between situations in patterns of expected directions. among students of the same group and between groups. Generally the results suggest the existence of common patterns among the students of the same group and systematic differences between patterns of groups with an increase in exposure to physics teaching. namely the attribution of new force directions [e. g. vertical and <b>downwards.</b> opposite to <b>motion).</b> despite the persistence of primitive ideas [e. g. a force along the motion); [b] names given to the different kinds of forces in various directions. Results include a difficulty found in naming forces which existed before teaching. They also give information about how scientific terms are assimilated. Interpretations of the results. mainly taken from a theory of Common Sense Reasoning about motions proposed by Ogborn (1985). seem to give them a reasonable explanation. Although requiring further investigation. this gives some support to claim that students' intuitive ideas about dynamics should be regarded [jJ as deriving from a rather general and coherent set of ideas. [ij] as less formalized in terms of the scientific world view and [iii] as having their origin mainly in actions on the world. ...|$|R
