In an executive job we are dangerous, unless we are aware of our limitations and take meas-ures to stop Our everlasting disposition to think, to listen, to-not act. I made up my mind long ago, when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> into <b>my</b> <b>first</b> executive job, to open my mind for a while, hear everybody who came to me with advice, information-what you will-then, some day, the day when my mind felt like deciding, to shut it up and act.

" 1 Most library executives will be thankful {{that they do not have}} to decide whether or not to take their country into war, but they will recognize the problem. Librarianship is a learned profession, and the library executive is, or should be, well educated and well read. He has an obligation to his patrons and to his staff to be continually building on his cultural background. He should belong to the intellectual elite of his community. At the same time his chief role is to be a man of action, who makes decisions and who gets things done. There are few executives today, in public libraries at least, who profess to great scholarship. Those with advanced degrees in subject fields appear to be rare. Most librarians, however, whether they are heads or not, make a habit of extensive reading, and although this may be on a broad rather than a specialized base the result is a substantial accumulation of knowledge. The library executive, therefore, should be and usually is an example in his community, of the thoughtful, well-informed citizen. Does the necessity for learning impair his ability to execute?

He only took me up in his arms and spoke to me--very kindly, as I afterward heard, for him--but he terrified me, nevertheless. Perhaps I was frightened at his great stature, his swarthy complexion, and his thick black hair and mustache, as other children might have been; perhaps the mere sight of him had some strange influence on me which I could not then understand and cannot now explain. However it was, I used to dream of him long after he had gone away, and to fancy that he was stealing on me to catch me up in his arms whenever I was left in the dark. The servants who took care of me found this out, and used to threaten me with my Uncle Stephen whenever I was perverse and difficult to manage. As I grew up, I still retained my vague dread and abhorrence of our absent relative.

40|$|Abstract. We sketch the {{outlines}} of Gian Carlo Rota’s interaction with the ideas that Hermann Grassmann developed in his Ausdehnungslehre[13, 15] of 1844 and 1862, as adapted and explained by Giuseppe Peano in 1888. This leads us past what Gian Carlo variously called Grassmann-Cayley algebra and Peano spaces to the Whitney algebra of a matroid, and finally to {{a resolution of the}} question “What, really, was Grassmann’s regressive product?”. This final question is the subject of ongoing joint work with Andrea Brini, Francesco Regonati, and William Schmitt. 1. Almost ten years later We are gathered today in order to renew and deepen our recollection {{of the ways in which}} our paths intersected that of Gian Carlo Rota. We do this in poignant sadness, but with a bitter-sweet touch: we are pleased to have this opportunity to meet and to discuss his life and work, since we know how Gian Carlo transformed us through his friendship and his love of mathematics. We will deal only with the most elementary of geometric questions; how to represent pieces of space of various dimensions, in their relation to one another. It’s a simple story, but one that extends over a period of some 160 years. We’ll start and finish with Hermann Grassmann’s project, but the trail will lead us by Giuseppe Peano, Hassler Whitney, to Gian Carlo Rota and his colleagues. Before I start, let me pause for a moment to recall a late afternoon at the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei, in 1973, on the eve of another talk I was petrified to give, when Gian Carlo decided to teach me how to talk, so I wouldn’t make a fool of myself the following day. The procedure was for me to start my talk, with an audience of one, and he would interrupt whenever there was a problem. We were in that otherwise empty conference hall for over two hours, and <b>I</b> never <b>got</b> past <b>my</b> <b>first</b> paragraph. It was terrifying, but it at least got me through the <b>first</b> battle with <b>my</b> fears and apprehensions, disguised as they usually are by timidity, self-effacement, and other forms of apologetic behavior. 2.

And the people I passed on the road were almost as quaint and picturesque in their way as the hills and the villages--the men in red-lined jackets; the women in black petticoats, short-waisted green bodices, and broad-brimmed straw hats with black-and-crimson pompons. But on the steepest gradient, just before reaching Hornberg, <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> nibble--strange to say, from two German students; they wore Heidelberg caps, and were toiling up the incline with short, broken wind; I put on a spurt with the Manitou, and passed them easily.

Filled with this bright idea, I dismounted near the summit, and pretended to be engaged in lubricating my bearings; though as a matter of fact the Manitou runs in a bath of oil, self-feeding, and needs no looking after. Presently, my two Heidelbergers straggled up--hot, dusty, panting. Woman-like, I pretended to take no notice. One of them drew near and cast an eye on the Manitou.|$|E
