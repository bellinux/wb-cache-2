The eruption occurred at 16:31 and was the 500th eruption of the year.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{volcanism}} in the Cascades, lasting from 7 to 2 mya, produced largely basaltic and basaltic andesite-based material (up to 50percent). On {{the eastern}} side of the High Cascades, however, volcanoes erupted dacite, andesite, and rhyolite. These materials made up several types of eruptions: lava flows, domes, and pyroclastic flows. In the most recent volcanic activity, andesite, basalt, and rhyolite have been <b>erupted</b> <b>from</b> High Cascades volcanoes, particularly the Three Sisters, Broken Top, Mount Hood, Mount Jefferson, and Crater Lake.|$|E
5|$|The {{differences}} between these two deposits can {{be accounted for by}} a few factors, including time of eruption and placement. The material inside the caldera must be younger and <b>erupted</b> <b>from</b> a pool of magma that had larger crystals. Its extensive erosion {{can be explained by the}} presence of hydrothermal vents, and its high levels of lithics probably originate from either being exposed to the rocks after they were erupted, lying adjacent to them while they underwent subsidence, or is a result of long, slow formation. Any of these reasons would also effectively account for the poor mixing of the lavas.|$|E

5|$|Flight 1 {{crashed into}} Pumpkin Patch Channel, Jamaica Bay, at 10:08:49, while angled at 78 degrees {{and on a}} {{magnetic}} heading of 300 degrees. Passengers aboard a Mohawk Airlines plane bound for Albany that took off immediately after Flight 1 watched the plane plunge into the bay. The jet exploded upon impact, a geyser of brackish water and black smoke <b>erupted</b> <b>from</b> the site, and the scattered debris and fuel caught fire. Long Island residents described hearing explosions which shook the foundations of nearby houses, though {{no one on the}} ground is known to have witnessed the plane hitting the swamp. However, a few men at Naval Air Station New York / Floyd Bennett Field saw the massive geyser of water rising above the hangars, and one guard—at his post on a bridge that the plane flew over—saw the plane roll over.|$|E
5|$|In 1771, the Tây Sơn {{rebellion}} <b>erupted</b> <b>from</b> Bình Định Province. In 1777, {{the last}} of the Nguyễn lords was deposed and killed. His nephew Nguyen Phuc Anh was the most senior member of the Nguyễn family to have survived the Tây Sơn victory and conquest of Saigon in 1777. Nguyễn Ánh fled to Hà Tiên in the far south of the country, where he met Pigneau de Behaine, a French priest who became his adviser and played a large part in his rise to power. Over the next few decades, there were continuous attacks and counterattacks by both sides and Saigon changed hands frequently. Eventually, Nguyễn Ánh was forced him into exile. The Tây Sơn regularly raided the rice growing areas of the south during the harvesting season, confiscating the Nguyễns' supply of food.|$|E
5|$|Kawachi {{rejoined the}} First Squadron after her refit {{commanded}} by Captain Yoshimoto Masaki and entered Tokuyama Bay {{on the evening}} of 11 July 1918. The following morning torpedo target practice was cancelled due to rough seas and the battleship remained at anchor {{for the rest of the}} day. That afternoon a loud explosion was heard at 15:51 in the vicinity of the starboard forward main-gun turret and large quantities of smoke <b>erupted</b> <b>from</b> the turret and between the first and second funnels. Two minutes later, she began to list to starboard and capsized at 15:55, only four minutes after the explosion. Over a thousand men were aboard Kawachi at the time of the explosion and over 600 were killed, with 433 survivors.|$|E

5|$|Private William Hudson (Bill Paxton) is the Colonial Marines' comedian and comtech expert.

Hudson despairs and panics until Ripley and Newt reassure him, enabling him to regain his composure. He fights to the end in the colony's operation room, where the survivors of the party make their final stand, and is pulled through a floor grate by an Alien while providing cover fire. In Aliens: Colonial Marines, Hudson's corpse was discovered in the sewers with a large hole in his chest, revealing that Hudson was impregnated by a Facehugger after he was dragged beneath the grates and later died when a chestburster <b>erupted</b> <b>from</b> his chest.|$|E
5|$|The Mauna Ulu {{eruption}} of Kīlauea began on May 24, 1969, and ended on July 22, 1974. At the time, Mauna Ulu {{was the longest}} flank {{eruption of}} any Hawaiian volcano in recorded history. The eruption created a new vent, covered a large area of land with lava, and added new land to the island. The eruption started as a fissure between two pit craters, Āloi and Alae, where the Mauna Ulu shield would eventually form. Both pāhoehoe and aā lava <b>erupted</b> <b>from</b> the volcano. Early on, fountains of lava burst {{out as much as}} 540meters (1772ft) high. In early 1973, an earthquake occurred that caused Kīlauea to briefly stop erupting near the original Mauna Ulu site and instead erupt near the craters Pauahi and Hiiaka.|$|E
5|$|The mafic shield-building stage {{began with}} the {{eruption}} of thin mafic lava flows on an eroded surface. Successive eruptions sent lava pouring in all directions from central vents, forming a broad, gently sloping volcano of flat, domical shape, with a profile much {{like that of a}} warrior's shield. Alkali basalts and ankaramites were the primary lavas produced during this stage of activity which, due to their low silica content, were able to travel great distances away from their source. These lavas also <b>erupted</b> <b>from</b> vents on the flanks of the volcano. Blocky 'a'a and ropy pāhoehoe flows characterized the fluid and effusive nature of volcanism at Level Mountain during the mafic shield-building stage.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} pillow lava and pillow breccia {{deposits}} are exposed throughout the Chilcotin Group. Pyroclastic fall deposits, composed of lapilli, were <b>erupted</b> <b>from</b> volcanoes in the Pemberton Belt and are overlain by subsequent basaltic lava flows. Lava flows from volcanism between 16and 14million years ago outcrop {{adjacent to the}} margins of the current lava plateau, which consists largely of basalts that were erupted between 10and 6.0million years ago. More recent lava flows are exposed in cliffs along the Fraser Canyon. These were erupted between 3.0and 1.0million years ago and the volcanic vents they were <b>erupted</b> <b>from</b> have not been discovered.|$|E

25|$|In {{northern}} British Columbia, {{remnants of}} a shield volcano are found throughout the western Cassiar Mountains.

25|$|The {{northern}} segment {{consists of}} one large volcanic complex, the Mount Meager massif, {{and a group}} of basaltic and andesitic volcanoes known as the Bridge River Cones. Mount Meager is composed of at least four overlapping stratovolcanoes that become progressively younger from south to north. These were formed in the last 2.2million years, with the latest eruption having been about 2,350years ago. The mafic, intermediate and felsic volcanic rocks comprising Meager were <b>erupted</b> <b>from</b> at least eight volcanic vents.|$|E
25|$|The {{anhydrous}} mineral form {{of sodium}} carbonate is quite rare and called natrite. Sodium carbonate also erupts from Ol Doinyo Lengai, Tanzania's unique volcano, {{and it is}} presumed to have <b>erupted</b> <b>from</b> other volcanoes in the past, but due to these minerals' instability at the earth's surface, {{are likely to be}} eroded. All three mineralogical forms of sodium carbonate, as well as trona, trisodium hydrogendicarbonate dihydrate, are also known from ultra-alkaline pegmatitic rocks, that occur for example in the Kola Peninsula in Russia.|$|E
25|$|Also in the Pliocene, basaltic flows <b>erupted</b> <b>from</b> vents and {{fissures}} in {{the southern}} part of the park. These and later flows covered increasingly large areas and built a lava plateau. In the later Pliocene and into the Pleistocene, these basaltic flows were covered by successive thick and fluid flows of andesite lava, which geologists call the Juniper lavas and the Twin Lakes lavas. The Twin Lakes lava is black, porphyritic and has abundant xenocrysts of quartz (see Cinder Cone).|$|E
