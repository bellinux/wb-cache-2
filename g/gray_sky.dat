60|$|Behind them, the leadys {{had come}} out and were {{standing}} silently, watching, too. The <b>gray</b> <b>sky</b> turned to white and the hills appeared more clearly. Light spread across the valley floor, moving toward them.|$|E
60|$|Against {{the pale}} <b>gray</b> <b>sky</b> Blandings Castle stood {{out like a}} mountain. It was a noble pile, of Early Tudor building. Its history is {{recorded}} in England's history books and Viollet-le-Duc has written of its architecture. It dominated the surrounding country.|$|E
50|$|Breaking Up <b>Gray</b> <b>Skies</b> is {{the debut}} album from singer Zayra Alvarez. Her surname {{does not appear}} on the cover for the release.|$|R
60|$|They {{were on a}} hill, {{overlooking}} the vast bowl of a valley. Dimly, against the <b>graying</b> <b>sky,</b> the outline of mountains were forming, becoming tangible.|$|R

60|$|Of course {{orders were}} given to ascend immediately, {{and at the same}} time a minor search-light was {{directed}} upward through the deck skylight. To the horror of the observers, ice could plainly be seen stretching above them like an irregular, <b>gray</b> <b>sky.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Farewell, beloved child! the bright, eternal doors {{have closed}} after thee; {{we shall see}} thy sweet face no more. O, woe for them who watched thy {{entrance}} into heaven, when they shall wake and find only the cold <b>gray</b> <b>sky</b> of daily life, and thou gone forever!" ...|$|E
60|$|And {{above the}} rushing roaring sound! {{the thunder of}} falling ceilings; the red light within some {{familiar}} windows; the <b>gray</b> <b>sky</b> reflected in others, till, after a few uncertain flickers, the glow awoke in them also. Then arose the whiter gusts of vapour, when water, hissing and boiling, contended with fire.|$|E
60|$|Am not I cross? But these <b>gray</b> <b>skies</b> {{are mere}} poison to my thoughts, and I {{have been writing}} such letters, that I don't think {{many of my friends}} are likely to speak to me again.|$|R
50|$|The {{music video}} for Last Angel {{was shot in}} Seoul, South Korea. The theme in the video carried an apocalyptic-theme, most notably due to the song being the theme for Japan's release of Resident Evil: Extinction. This is shown by the <b>graying</b> <b>sky</b> in the video's opening.|$|R
5000|$|For Sketch No. 1, [...] "Jubilee", No cool gray tones for me!Give me {{the warmest}} red and green,A cornet and a tambourine,To paint my Jubilee!For when pale flutes and oboes play,To sadness I become a prey;Give me the violets and the May,But no <b>gray</b> <b>skies</b> for me.|$|R
6000|$|It was {{a desolate}} November morning, raw and gloomy, but the <b>gray</b> <b>sky</b> and the patient, bare-limbed elms were curiously {{medicinal}} to my sore heart. In some strange way they comforted me. Snow {{was in the}} air and father mechanically weather-wise, said, without thinking of the bitter irony of his words--"Regular Thanksgiving weather." ...|$|E
60|$|At {{five hundred}} feet {{altitude}} {{he was not}} yet entirely above the fog. Land was blotted out. Above him, <b>gray</b> <b>sky</b> and thin writhing filaments of vapor. Beneath him, only the fog-bank, erupting here and there like the unfolding of great white flowers as warm currents of air burst up through the mist-blanket.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps {{you may be}} {{interested}} in the following account from my sister of her visual peculiarities: 'When I think of Wednesday I see a kind of oval flat wash of yellow emerald green; for Tuesday, a <b>gray</b> <b>sky</b> colour; for Thursday, a brown-red irregular polygon; and a dull yellow smudge for Friday.'" ...|$|E

60|$|It was {{an autumn}} twilight, {{with a cool}} wind, <b>gray</b> <b>sky,</b> and sad, barren slopes. The fertile valley seemed half {{obscured}} in melancholy haze, and over toward the dim hills beyond night had already fallen. No stars, no moon, no afterglow of sunset illumined the grayness that in this hour seemed prophetic of Lenore's future.|$|E
60|$|It was in {{the gray}} of the dawning, and the master took the pupil {{by the hand and}} led him up the rickety stairs to the roof of the house, where nothing was to be seen but <b>gray</b> <b>sky,</b> high roofs, and chimney stacks from which the smoke rose {{straight}} into the still air.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Oh, {{where has}} thou been, my daughter? [...] Oh, where hast thou been this day [...] Daughter, my daughter?' [...] 'Oh, I {{have been to}} the river's side, [...] Where the waters lie all gray and wide, [...] And the <b>gray</b> <b>sky</b> broods o'er the leaden tide, [...] And the shrill wind sighs a straining.' ...|$|E
50|$|Solar {{water heating}} systems are popular in China, where basic models start at around 1,500 yuan (US$235), around 80% {{less than in}} Western {{countries}} for a given collector size. At least 30 million Chinese households have one. The popularity is due to efficient evacuated tubes that allow the heaters to function even under <b>gray</b> <b>skies</b> and at temperatures well below freezing.|$|R
50|$|Mr. Lee-Smith's {{paintings}} {{usually have}} spare settings suggestive of theater stages or bleak urban or seaside landscapes. Walls stretch out under <b>gray</b> <b>skies.</b> Men and women, as lithe as dancers, seem frozen in place. Most {{are dressed in}} street clothes; some wear exotic masks. Children frequently appear, as do props reminiscent of circuses. The work has an air of mystery associated with the paintings of Giorgio de Chirico and Edward Hopper.|$|R
40|$|Missourians will {{remember}} {{the summer of}} 2012 as hot and dry, browning grass and brittle leaves all too visible in the landscape. Gardeners report lackluster tomatoes, farmers anticipate disappointing yields. We've watched <b>gray</b> <b>skies,</b> hoping for rain that rarely falls. But according to some researchers, these conditions might actually be a new normal. Evidence suggests that parts of the United States are positioned for a "megadrought," {{an extended period of}} time with minimal rainfall...|$|R
6000|$|<b>Gray</b> <b>sky,</b> sea gray as mossy stones on graves;-- [...] Anon comes April in her jollity; And dancing {{down the}} bleak vales 'tween the waves, [...] Makes them green glades {{for all her}} flowers and me. [...] The gulls turn thrushes, charmed are sea and sky [...] By magic of my thought, and know not why.|$|E
60|$|He saw {{the little}} squad of {{soldiers}} before him. He saw the cold, gray wall behind, and, above, the cold, <b>gray</b> <b>sky</b> of early dawn. The dismal men leaning upon their shadowy guns seemed unearthly specters in the weird {{light of the}} hour that is neither God's day nor devil's night. With difficulty two of them dragged Leopold to his feet.|$|E
60|$|Winter {{had set in}} {{with unusual}} rigor. The <b>gray</b> <b>sky</b> was barred with leaden cloud; the pines, which looked strangely ragged and somber, stood out with harsh {{distinctness}} against the first thin snow; and the river flowed, a dark-colored riband, through a clean-cut channel in the ice. A nipping wind blew down the gorge, and now and then light flakes of snow fell.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, several clubs {{serve the}} Greater Seattle area {{including}} Lake Bronson Family Nudist Club, Lake Associates Recreation Club (LARC) near Mt Vernon, Fraternity Snoqualmie (now Tiger Mountain Family Nudist Park) {{on the side}} of Tiger Mountain near Issaquah. Fraternity Snoqualmie at Park Forestia is the home of the Bare Buns Fun Run West and Nudestock. Additionally, the Sun Lovers Under <b>Gray</b> <b>Skies</b> (SLUGS) is a non-landed naturist travel & events club located in the Puget Sound area.|$|R
50|$|I'll {{always be}} {{slightly}} {{out of sync with}} my contemporaries. I've never felt fully American - despite valiant attempts, I cannot bring myself to enjoy pro football or shopping malls. At the same time, I'm certainly not European. Instead I'm something in between, a perennial expatriate, a refugee from the <b>gray</b> <b>skys</b> over France, from the screech of the train coming into the Gare St. Lazare, from the wind blowing cold off Mount Olympus through the cracks around our bathroom window.|$|R
5000|$|Notable for its period {{detail and}} [...] Giuseppe Rotunno’s {{accomplished}} faux-daguerreotype cinematography, {{the film is}} not so much a call to action as to recollection—both a historical monument and a taboo-breaking depiction of a specific moment. Throughout, Rotunno’s black-and-white cinematography makes evocative use of flat lighting and <b>gray</b> <b>skies</b> to accentuate the sense of soot and smoke. (Because little was left of nineteenth-century Turin, the movie was actually shot in the nearby Piedmontese cities of Cuneo, Fossano, and Savigliano, with the vast factory interior filmed in Zagreb, Yugoslavia.) ...|$|R
60|$|The {{schooner}} lay to with backed fore-staysail tumbling wildly on a dim, gray sea. Half a {{mile away}} the ice ran back into a dingy haze, {{and there was a}} low, <b>gray</b> <b>sky</b> to weather. Now and then a fine sprinkle of snow slid across the water before a nipping breeze. As Wyllard glanced to windward Dampier strode up to him.|$|E
60|$|The {{river was}} up. In the chill gray light {{she could see}} the ice rubbing softly against the very crest of the bank; it even topped it in places, and the huge cakes worked inshore many feet. A hundred yards out the white field merged into the dim dawn and the <b>gray</b> <b>sky.</b> Subdued splits and splutters whispered from out the obscureness, and a gentle {{grinding}} could be heard.|$|E
60|$|Uncle Alec was dubious {{about our}} going that day. He looked abroad {{on the general}} dourness of gray earth and gray air and <b>gray</b> <b>sky,</b> and said a storm was brewing. But Cousin Mattie had been sent word that we were coming, {{and she did not}} like to be disappointed, so he let us go, warning us to stay with Cousin Mattie all night if the storm came on while we were there.|$|E
60|$|Vane nodded. He {{knew the}} sad <b>gray</b> <b>skies</b> {{of his native}} land, when its lonely heights are blurred by driving snow-cloud or scourged by bitter rain for weeks together, though now and then they tower serenely into the blue heavens, steeped in {{ethereal}} splendor. Once more it struck him that in their latter aspect his companion resembled them. Made finely, of warm flesh and blood, she was yet ethereal too. There was something aloof and intangible about her that seemed {{in harmony with the}} hills among which she was born.|$|R
6000|$|A vacant sameness <b>grays</b> the <b>sky,</b> [...] A {{moisture}} gathers on each knop [...] Of the bramble, rounding to a drop, [...] That greets the goer-by With {{the cold}} listless lustre {{of a dead}} man's eye.|$|R
50|$|His most mature works, {{characterized}} by a smooth brushstroke and a robust and vibrant style, are early twentieth-century: he appreciated sad autumn atmospheres, <b>gray</b> <b>skies,</b> and cold windy days, which he portrayed with dim and melancholic tones. In 1901 he composed Donna a passeggio, in 1903 Paesaggio paludoso, in 1906 Via Libertà and Donna che raccoglie i fiori, in 1908 Scogli a riva, in 1910 Alberi a riva, Barche, Marina con scogli. Organized by Edoardo Alfano he held a large personal exhibition in 1910 in Palermo where thirty-six of his works were presented. In 1911 {{he was awarded the}} gold medal at the National Exhibition of Rome for the picture Ultime foglie (Il viale della Libertà in una giornata di pioggia) of 1906.|$|R
