5|$|Coastal plants {{begin to}} flower at around {{five years from}} seed, but plants in the Stirling Range take much longer to mature. In one Stirling Range population, only 15% of plants had flowered after eight years. Flowering time is highly variable, but in general it occurs between March and August, with a peak around June. More flowers open during the <b>day</b> <b>than</b> at night.|$|E
5|$|Overall, {{the average}} smoker consumes 12.4 {{cigarettes}} per day, with this figure rising slightly to 15 per day when just male smokers are considered. The average smoker starts smoking at aged 23 {{and the percentage}} of the population that smokes increases with age until the 55–64 age group, after which it declines. On average urban smokers tend to smoke more cigarettes per <b>day</b> <b>than</b> rural farmers.|$|E
5|$|The jaguar {{is often}} {{described}} as nocturnal, but is more specifically crepuscular (peak activity around dawn and dusk). Both sexes hunt, but males travel farther each <b>day</b> <b>than</b> females, befitting their larger territories. The jaguar may hunt during the day if game is available and is a relatively energetic feline, spending as much as 50–60 percent of its time active. The jaguar's elusive nature and the inaccessibility of much of its preferred habitat make it a difficult animal to sight, let alone study.|$|E

5|$|Flowering {{begins in}} February {{and is usually}} {{finished}} {{by the end of}} June. The species has an unusually low rate of flowering: even at the peak of its flowering season, it averages less than seven inflorescences per plant flowering at any one time. Individual flowers open sequentially from bottom to top within each inflorescence, the rate varying with the time of day: more flowers open during the <b>day</b> <b>than</b> at night, with a peak rate of around two to three florets per hour during the first few hours of daylight, when honeyeater foraging is also at its peak.|$|E
5|$|Georgia's kicking {{game had}} {{a far more}} active <b>day</b> <b>than</b> its offense. Punter Gordon Ely-Kelso booted sevenpunts and kicker Brandon Coutu nailed threefieldgoals. The field goals, kicked from 39,51,and28yards away and two extra points made Coutu Georgia's leading scorer in the game, earning 11points. Ely-Kelso netted 264yards in punts, an average of 37.7yards per kick. Though not long, the punts were high enough {{in the air to}} allow Georgia's special teams to get downfield and prevent long punt returns. Only two of Ely-Kelso's punts were {{returned}} by Tech kick returner Eddie Royal, and one return was for negative yardage.|$|E
5|$|To {{save money}} for the production, Bay reduced his usual fee by 30%. He planned an 83-day {{shooting}} schedule, maintaining the required pace by doing more camera set-ups per <b>day</b> <b>than</b> usual. Bay chose to shoot the film in the United States instead of Australia or Canada, allowing him {{to work with a}} crew he was familiar with, and who understood his work ethic. A pre-shoot took place on April 19, 2006 and principal photography began three days later at Holloman Air Force Base, which stood in for Qatar. To film the Scorponok sequence at White Sands Missile Range, a sweep was performed to remove unexploded ordnance before building of a village set could begin; ironically, the village would be blown up. The scene was broken down for the Air battle managers flying aboard the AWACS aircraft, who improvised dialogue {{as if it were an}} actual battle.|$|E

5|$|BART {{ridership}} {{has grown}} rapidly since 2010, mirroring strong {{economic growth in}} the Bay Area. In 2015, the system was carrying approximately 100,000 more passengers each <b>day</b> <b>than</b> it had five years earlier. High gasoline prices also contributed to growth, pushing ridership to record levels during 2012, with the system recording five record ridership days in September and October 2012. During the fiscal year ending June 30, 2017, BART recorded an average weekday ridership of 423,395, the second-highest in its history, but a 2.3% drop from 2016. Ridership growth began to slow in late 2016, and dropped by 1.7% in October 2016 from the prior year. The line to the San Francisco International Airport lost riders, while ride-sharing services such as Uber and Lyft grew by a factor of almost six or nearly 500% at the airport during 2014–2016. BART planners believe that competition from Uber and Lyft is reducing overall ridership growth and BART's share of SFO airport transit. Some see the decline in transit use in large U.S. cities as part of a national trend, linked to changes in commute patterns, the fall in gasoline prices since 2014, and competition from the private sector in the form of ride-sharing services.|$|E

This is presumably due to the need for a higher intake to achieve a comparable desired effect, not that the gene led to a disposition for greater incentive of habituation.|$|E

The airport is one of the busiest in Massachusetts and often logs more take-offs and {{landings}} on a summer <b>day</b> <b>than</b> Boston's Logan Airport. This is due in part to the large number of private planes used by wealthy summer inhabitants, and in part to the 10-seat Cessna 402s used by several commercial air carriers to serve the island community.|$|E
40|$|Although smoking {{cigarettes}} and drinking alcohol are highly correlated, {{little research has}} {{examined the effects of}} smoking on alcohol abusers 2 ̆ 7 posttreatment functioning. Alcohol abusers (N = 155) were classified {{on the basis of their}} pretreatment smoking status as: nonsmoker, ex-smoker, low dependent smoker (first cigarette of the day 3 ̆e 10 minutes after waking), and high dependent smoker (first cigarette of the day 3 ̆c or = 10 minutes after waking).
