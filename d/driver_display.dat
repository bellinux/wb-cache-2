50|$|The McLaren 720S {{features}} twin-hinged dihedral {{doors and}} many design features from the McLaren F1. The headlights hide air vents that funnel incoming air to two small radiators {{in front of}} the wheels. The doors feature air channels which directs air to the engine.The rear of the car features thin LED lights similar to those on the McLaren P1, and two round exhaust pipes. The design was inspired by the great white shark, and features a teardrop-shaped cockpit.The 720S produces 50% more downforce than the 650S.The interior of the car includes a folding <b>driver</b> <b>display</b> and carbon fiber accents.The McLaren 720S weighs just 1283 kg dry, making it the lightest in its class.|$|E
5000|$|Despite the {{increased}} use of aluminum and other light weight materials, the overall weight of the car remains {{the same as that of}} the previous generation (C6). The C7 Corvette offers a seven-speed manual transmission made by Tremec that implements active rev matching. The Corvette also provides a driver mode selector with five settings: Weather, Eco, Tour, Sport, and Track mode. The C7 hood and side vents and inlets assist in cooling and aerodynamic stability. The interior features a <b>driver</b> <b>display</b> that allows the driver to select from several modes with up to 69 different sources of information, ranging from an interactive performance timer to a tire tread temperature display. [...] Two seat options are available: a sporty touring seat for every day use, and a competition sport seat for track driving with pass-throughs for a racing harness.|$|E

50|$|Due to the {{influence}} tire pressure has on vehicle safety and efficiency, tire-pressure monitoring (TPM) was first adopted by the European market as an optional feature for luxury passenger vehicles in the 1980s. Some claim the efficiency gains are negligible. The first passenger vehicle to adopt TPM was the Porsche 959 in 1986, using a hollow spoke wheel system developed by PSK. In 1996 Renault used the Michelin PAX system for the Scenic and in 1999 the PSA Peugeot Citroën decided to adopt TPM as a standard feature on the Peugeot 607. The following year (2000), Renault launched the Laguna II, the first high volume mid-size passenger vehicle {{in the world to}} be equipped with TPM as a standard feature. In the United States, TPM was introduced by General Motors for the 1991 model year for the Corvette in conjunction with Goodyear run-flat tires. The system uses sensors in the wheels and a <b>driver</b> <b>display</b> which can show tire pressure at any wheel, plus warnings for both high and low pressure. It has been standard on Corvettes ever since.|$|E
30|$|OBDCS {{comprises}} a vehicle-on-board controller {{and several}} train borne equipment, such as global system for mobile communications-railway trans-receiver antenna, RFID reader, speedometer, accelerator, braking unit, <b>driver</b> <b>display</b> screen, train integrity monitor, etc. Train borne equipment collects the relevant information, such as train number, speed, location identifier, direction, etc., and periodically {{send it to}} their respective ZC. Location identifier is the location reference read by train borne RFID reader through track side RFID tags.|$|E
40|$|As a task {{traditionally}} {{reliant on}} external sources of information, integration of European railway initiatives will change traditional British train driving by migrating a new signalling standard for exclusive use inside the cab. On-board computer systems and driver-interfaces will instruct throttle changes for speed and braking points under a supervisory automated braking system. However, {{it is unclear}} what effects such a fundamental transformation in human-machine expertise and automatising of goal setting activity is likely to have on driver control. The present study used a blues-skies approach and process control analogy to investigate performance under automatic (closed loop) and driver goal set (open loop) operations in ATREIDES (Adaptive Train-Research Enhanced Information Display and Environment Simulator). Eighteen postgraduate participants, all with engineering backgrounds, were trained before performing a short train journey under tracking, predictive or basic <b>driver</b> <b>display</b> modes. The results showed that performance under automatic goal setting was more optimal, required fewer safety interventions, and considered subjectively easier than driver goal set modes. However, modes were equally demanding on objective measures, suggesting supervisory automation and overt tracking did not reduce cognitive effort. The findings are discussed in relation to characteristics of control activity with implications of future changes to the UK train driving task...|$|E

40|$|The {{security}} challenges being {{encountered in}} many places today require electronic means of controlling access to secured premises {{in addition to the}} available security personnel. Various technologies were used in different forms to solve these challenges. The Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Based Access Control Security system with GSM technology presented in this work helps to prevent unauthorized access to controlled environments (secured premises). This is achieved mainly {{through the use of a}} Radio Frequency Identification System with operating frequency of 125 KHz, Microcontroller programmed to send control signals, DC motor, relay, buzzer, Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) and GSM/GPRS Modem. Once the RFID tag which contains the user’s unique information is scan by the RFID reader and confirmed match with the information stored in the microcontroller, the microcontroller is instructed to turn ON the DC motor through L 293 D <b>driver,</b> <b>display</b> “USER NUMBER and CARD NUMBER” on the LCD and activates the GSM/GPRS modem to send SMS alert “AUTHORIZED, valid RFID card shown, User is allowed to enter, user number” to security personnel. Else, the DC Motor remained OFF, LCD displays “READ RFID CARD NOT VALID”, buzzer turns ON for about 5 seconds and GSM/GPRS modem activated to send “ UNAUTHORIZED, invalid RFID card is used to access the security system” to the security personnel. The electronic circuit was implemented, the codes for microcontroller were written in assembly language, debugged and compiled using the KEIL Micro vision 4 integrated development environment. The resultant Hex files were programmed into the memories of the microcontrollers with the aid of a universal programmer. Hardware simulation was carried out using the Proteus Virtual System Modelling (VSM) version 8. 0. An importation implication of this paper is that the system is cheaper to maintain and more efficient in comparison with a manually operated type or key lock system. The RFID based access control system can be useful in providing security for homes, organizations, and automobile terminals to increase the level of securit...|$|E
