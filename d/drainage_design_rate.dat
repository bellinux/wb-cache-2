40|$|A {{stochastic}} {{optimization model}} for urban <b>drainage</b> <b>design</b> (SODD) was proposed {{in this study}} to help analyze the tradeoff between investment and acceptable flood damage in urban <b>drainage</b> <b>designs</b> considering effects of both uncertainty and climate change. The simulation model (i. e.

The results from a case study showed that the deterministic optimization was computationally efficient with no randomness encountered in hydrological simulation, although its solution was hardly reliable in achieving the target for flood mitigation. The stochastic version, on the other hand, could offer richer information on system reliability and help managers make a more robust decision. The results also revealed that the rainfall extremes under the impact of climate change could significantly affect system investment.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to estimate the influence of roots on the drainage facilities associated with the levees along the middle Rio Grande (MRG), and to suggest an appropriate <b>drainage</b> <b>design.</b> This study consists of three research elements: (1) GIS-based analysis in estimating root distribution along levees, (2) a bench-top experiment, and (3) evaluating a <b>drainage</b> <b>designs</b> using a numerical model. First, tree crown sizes were measured on GIS-based aerial photography to estimate root distributions. The results were compared with vegetation maps that were created based on field observations. The GIS-based measurements and field measurements showed similar values if the site was covered with a simple vegetation community. Simple canopy shapes improved the precision of the measurements. However, the GIS-based measurement was not accurate for a site with complex vegetation coverage. The bench-top experiment was conducted {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} two types of geosynthetics as root barriers. A geotextile and a geocomposite were tested in v clear columns filled with soil and/or gravel to simulate six different <b>drainage</b> <b>designs.</b> Two New Mexican plants, Rio Grande cottonwood (Populus deltoides ssp. wislizeni) and coyote willow (Salix exigua), were selected, and planted in columns. The results showed roots of both species could penetrate through the geotextile and geocomposite. Also, root growth was not affected by the types of root barriers nor drainage material. For the last study element, HYDRUS- 2 D was applied to understand the soil water movement in the levee. The typical toe drain and the geocomposite edge drain were considered, and the models were run under the ambient condition (unsaturated) and the flood condition (saturated). As a result, the functions of both <b>drainage</b> <b>designs</b> were close to identical under the ambient condition since it did not result in drainage. In contrast, under the flood condition, the geocomposite edge drain could remove excess water more efficiently than the conventional toe drain. Civil EngineeringMastersUniversity of New Mexico.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a {{comparative study of}} two different <b>drainage</b> <b>designs</b> in a 10, 930 -ha new town development of The Woodlands, Texas. Open surface drainage by shallow grassed swales {{was used in the}} first two subdivisions that were developed with ecological approaches. Open surface drainage mimics the natural flow regime and is regarded to mitigate development impacts on watershed. In other later subdivisions, the <b>drainage</b> <b>design</b> shifted back to a conventional stormwater drainage system, that is, curb and gutter, drop inlet, and underground piping, known to concentrate stormwater and lead to downstream flooding. The objective {{of this study is to}} compare The Woodlands’ two drainage systems on their correlation with downstream floods. Two sub-watersheds within The Woodlands that used different <b>drainage</b> <b>designs</b> were compared. U. S. Geological Survey stream data from the gauge station at the outlet of each sub-watershed were used for analysis. Geographic Information System was used to quantify the development conditions. Correlation analysis was performed using measured precipitation and streamflow data. Results show that open drainage watershed generated less storm runoff than the conventional drainage watershed, given the similar impervious area in both watersheds. Furthermore, the open surface drainage watershed responded to rainfall in a way similar to its predevelopment natural forest conditions, indicating effective flood mitigation post development. In contrast, in the conventional drainage watershed, the precipitation–streamflow correlations increased enormously after development.

While drainage requirements of different crops are difficult to define quantiatively, adequate drainage can probably be provided by designing for a given water table recession rate. The method used was to measure the rate of water table recession and drain outflow after cessation of a considerable amount of rainfall. Based on these measurements, soil parameters were determined and nine drainage equations were tested in simulating water table recession against actual field data of two drained experimental sites, located in Soja city west of Okayama prefecture, Japan, having drain spacing of 10 and 8. 5 m for a period of two years.

The improved ditch design procedure involves finding the optimum ditch alignment that provides the minimum soil excavation for given track conditions while discharging the water away from the track to the designated outlets. A software program was developed for this purpose. Following these procedures can improve the effectiveness of ditching and undercutting operations and potentially can cut long-term maintenance costs. ^ A subballast drainage approach was developed based on keeping the subballast drained since saturated subballast subjected to cyclic traffic loads will deform and may even liquefy. An analytical model was developed and laboratory flume experiments were performed for this purpose. Variables considered in the design approach include rainfall intensity, hydraulic conductivity of the subballast, subballast layer thickness, length of subballast drainage path, and slope of the subballast/subgrade interface. Design examples show potential subballast saturation can be reduced by shortening the subballast drainage path with longitudinal collectors or by using a clean subballast material such as a mixture of coarse sand and gravel. ^ <b>Drainage</b> <b>designs</b> for three problem sites are presented in the form of case studies as application examples.
