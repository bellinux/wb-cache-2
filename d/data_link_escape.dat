Once this command has been accepted, most modems will respond with <b>Data</b> <b>Link</b> <b>Escape</b> (DLE) {{messages}} instead of or in addition to normal modem responses.

50|$|This type {{of event}} is signalled with a DLE message, {{which is a}} single-{{character}} message preceded by a <b>Data</b> <b>Link</b> <b>Escape</b> code. DLE is a character sent from the modem to the computer whose definition is unrelated to either command or data mode, and which uses a specific ASCII code (0x10) which never occurs in any AT commands or responses, {{so that it can}} be isolated from the command/response stream on that merit alone. In these modes, whenever a DLE (0x10) is sent, the character following it has a special non-command and non-data meaning. For example, a DLE followed by the number 2 means the caller pressed the number 2 on his telephone keypad. This could happen in either command or data mode so long as the phone line is in use by the modem and someone is on the other end of the line.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} problem of <b>data</b> <b>link</b> in the NAT under a {{technology}} transition framework of value creation, capture, and delivery. Creating value through a new technology, such as <b>data</b> <b>link,</b> refers to designing competitive value propositions for stakeholders. Capturing value means recovering an investment in a technology through the value it creates. Delivering value refers to developing policies and business strategies to enable value capture. Realization of these concepts is necessary to guarantee technology transition. Data was gathered from {{a survey of the}} two major stakeholder groups in the NAT, commercial operators and ANSPs. The survey covered five major research areas: 1) Perceived operational and coordination inefficiencies; 2) Opportunities to improve service; 3) Current and projected <b>data</b> <b>link</b> equipage and infrastructure in the NAT; 4) Value distribution of <b>data</b> <b>link</b> costs and benefits; and 5) Potential policy strategies to encourage <b>data</b> <b>link</b> adoption. The study found that <b>data</b> <b>link</b> creates value for stakeholders through an understanding of the evolution of technology and stakeholder needs. Fuel penalties associated with flying suboptimal flight levels and routes is the largest inefficiency in the NAT. <b>Data</b> <b>link,</b> particularly through the FANS system, is seen as the enabling technology to improve efficiency of operations. Reducing separation is the <b>data</b> <b>link</b> application most valued by stakeholders. (cont.) Coordination and harmonization issues threaten to limit the value created. <b>Data</b> <b>link</b> diffusion (airborne equipage and ground infrastructure) is not always guaranteed as a result of value created due to improvements in technical performance. Value capture is limited due to unbalances in the distribution of <b>data</b> <b>link</b> costs and benefits. So far, <b>data</b> <b>link</b> operational benefits have been significant but have not yet translated into economic benefits given that such applications have not been implemented in the NAT. Delivering value from <b>data</b> <b>link</b> is more than balancing costs and benefits. Uncertainty in a number of issues needs resolution before the value created through <b>data</b> <b>link</b> could be fully captured and delivered. A combination of operational, financial and regulatory schemes may be necessary to leverage costs and benefits and ensure successful <b>data</b> <b>link</b> value delivery to all stakeholders. by Norma Viviana Campos.
