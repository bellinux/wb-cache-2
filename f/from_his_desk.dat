5|$|After {{travelling}} to Istanbul, Bond {{heads into}} the city to meet with station head Ali Kerim Bey, tailed by Bulgarian secret agents working for the Russians. They are in turn tailed by Grant, who kills one of them after Bond is taken back to his hotel, stealing their car and dumping it outside the Soviet Consulate in order to provoke hostilities between British and Soviet Intelligence. In response, the Soviets bomb Kerim's office with a limpet mine - but Kerim is away <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>desk</b> for a tryst with his mistress. He and Bond then investigate the attack by spying on a Soviet consulate meeting through a periscope installed in the underground aqueducts beneath Istanbul. Thus, they learn that the Soviet agent Krilenku {{is responsible for the}} bombing. Kerim Bey declares it unwise to stay in the city under such circumstances and takes Bond to a rural gypsy settlement. However, Krilenku learns of this and promptly attacks a Gypsy feast (where Bond and Kerim are honoured guests) with a band of hired Bulgarian fighters. Much to Bond's confusion, he is saved from an enemy fighter during the attack by a distant sniper shot from Grant. The following night, Bond and Kerim Bey track Krilenku down to his hideout, where Kerim Bey kills him with Bond's rifle.|$|E
25|$|Calling no witnesses, Roark {{addresses}} the court {{on his own}} behalf. He makes a long and eloquent speech defending his right to offer his own work on his own terms.

He coldly presents him with a contract to design the Wynand Building, to be the greatest structure of all time, with complete freedom to build it however Roark sees fit. As soon as Roark leaves, Wynand pulls out a pistol <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>desk</b> drawer and kills himself.|$|E
25|$|The {{clock in}} the {{building}} tower was originally mechanical in nature, and kept accurate time via gravity. A cable was wrapped around a drum, and a large weight attached {{to the end of}} the cable. As the cable unwound due to the force of gravity, the clock hands turned. The cable was rewound once or twice a day. On October 10, 1956, the weight came loose from the cable and plunged through two floors (narrowly avoiding killing a man, who had just gotten up <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>desk).</b> The mechanical clock was later replaced with an electric one.|$|E

25|$|In September 2002, Roark {{and three}} former NSA officials, William Binney, J.

She also attempted to contact William Rehnquist, the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court at the time. In addition, Roark {{made an effort to}} inform Vice President Dick Cheney's legal counsel David Addington, who had been a Republican staff colleague of hers on the committee in the 1980s.

Giuliani (2002), Sotomayor dissented {{from her}} colleagues' {{ruling that the}} New York Police Department could {{terminate}} <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>desk</b> job an employee who sent racist materials through the mail. Sotomayor argued that the First Amendment protected speech by the employee [...] "away from the office, on [...] own time", even if that speech was [...] "offensive, hateful, and insulting", and that therefore the employee's First Amendment claim {{should have gone to}} trial rather than being dismissed on summary judgment.|$|E
