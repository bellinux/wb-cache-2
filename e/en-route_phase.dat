Pilots used flight deck tools to avoid convective weather and space behind a lead aircraft during an arrival into Louisville International airport. Three conflict avoidance management concepts were studied: pilot, controller or automation primarily responsible. A modified Air Traffic Workload Input Technique (ATWIT) metric showed highest workload during the approach phase of flight and lowest during the <b>en-route</b> <b>phase</b> of flight (before deviating for weather). In general, the modified ATWIT {{was shown to}} be a valid and reliable workload measure, providing more detailed information than post-run subjective workload metrics. The trend across multiple workload metrics revealed lowest workload when pilots had both conflict alerting and responsibility of the three concepts, while all objective and subjective measures showed highest workload when pilots had no conflict alerting or responsibility. This suggests that pilot workload was not tied primarily to responsibility for resolving conflicts, but to gaining and/or maintaining situation awareness when conflict alerting is unavailable...|$|E

40|$|Compared {{with common}} airliners, High/Medium Altitude Long Endurance (HALE/MALE) RPAS are lighter and have larger wingspan.

30|$|However, these {{requirements}} have mainly been proposed to support aeronautical operations (ranging from <b>en-route</b> <b>phase</b> to approach operation with vertical guidance, called APV II). In fact, continuity requirements were introduced {{for the first}} time in aviation in the late 1960 s to define precise approach requirements for a radio navigation system, called the Instrument Landing System (ILS). The purpose was to describe the quality of service during a most critical phase of operation (e.g. 15  s for the precise approach phase of an aeroplane before landing, duration in which service interruption is dangerous). Continuity requirement was derived by means of a risk allocation from the Target Level of Safety (TLS), whereas TLS results from statistical analysis of historical accident data of aeroplanes for a given period. In 1993, the ICAO’s Air Navigation Commission requested All Weather Operations Panel (AWOP) to examine the possibility of extending the Required Navigation Performance (RNP) concept, which was originally intended for en-route operations, to include approach, landing and departure operations. At that time, it was proposed to use the accuracy, integrity, continuity, and availability quality criteria that were later retained for GNSS.|$|E

At 3 -minute intervals in the scenario, pilots and controllers were probed on their workload or situation awareness. We employed one of three concepts of operation that distributed separation responsibility across human controllers, pilots, and automation to measure changes in operator situation awareness and workload. We found that when pilots were responsible for separation, they had higher levels of awareness, but not necessarily higher levels of workload. When controllers are responsible and actively engaged, they showed higher workload levels compared to pilots and changes in awareness that were dependent on sector characteristics...|$|E
40|$|The United States National Airspace System (NAS) network {{performance}} is currently measured {{using a variety}} of metrics based on delay. Developments in the fields of wireless communication, manufacturing and other modes of transportation like road, freight, etc. have explored various metrics that complement the delay metric. In this work, we develop a throughput concept for both the terminal and <b>en-route</b> <b>phases</b> of flight inspired by studies in the above areas and explore the applications of throughput metrics for the en-route airspace of the NAS. These metrics {{can be applied to the}} NAS performance at each hierarchical level—the sector, center, regional and national and will consist of multiple layers of networks with the bottom level comprising the traffic pattern modelled as a network of individual sectors acting as nodes. This hierarchical approach is especially suited for executive level decision making as it gives an overall picture of not just the inefficiencies but also the aspects where the NAS has performed well in a given situation from which specific information about the effects of a policy change on the NAS performance at each level can be determined. These metrics are further validated with real traffic data using the Future Air Traffic Management Concepts Evaluation Tool (FACET) for three en-route sectors and an Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC). ^ Further, this work proposes a framework to compute the minimum makespan and the capacity of a runway system in any configuration. Towards this, an algorithm for optimal arrival and departure flight sequencing is proposed. The proposed algorithm is based on a branch-and-bound technique and allows for the efficient computation of the best runway assignment and sequencing of arrival and departure operations that minimize the makespan at a given airport. The lower and upper bounds of the cost of each branch for the best first search in the branch-and-bound algorithm are computed based on the minimum separation standards between arrival and departure operations set by the Federal Aviation Administration. The optimal objective value is mathematically proved to lie between these bounds and the algorithm uses these bounds to efficiently find promising branches and discard all others and terminate with atleast one sequence with the minimal makespan. The proposed algorithm is analyzed and validated through real traffic operations data at the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta international airport. ...|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 84 - 87). Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. According to the U. S. Department of Transportation, Bureau of Transportation Statistics, nearly 200 million person-trips over 100 miles one-way were taken by airplane in 1995, a 186 percent increase since 1977 (Bureau of Transportation Statistics, 1998). As the popularity of air travel continues to increase, the number of trips to and from the airport will inevitably rise also. Passengers will need accurate information about all modes on a total trip basis. This includes the modes of access to and from the airport in addition to the long distance segment of the trip (Sverdrup & Parcel Consultants, Inc., et al., 1996). The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the specific information needs of departing air travelers with regard to the pre-trip and <b>en-route</b> <b>phases</b> of their trip to the airport. Based on the results of this research, effective plans for providing supplementary information in support of ground-side travel can be developed by local, state, and national agencies. To gain an understanding of air passenger information needs, personal interviews were conducted with 216 passengers at George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston, Texas. One major finding from this research was that in general, passengers are content with the existing types of real-time travel information that are available. Specifically, the survey results showed that passengers currently use and would prefer to have access to flight information including, confirmed schedules, flight delays, and gate assignments. It was also found that most passengers would prefer to receive travel information earlier in their trip (i. e., before beginning their trip). This could possibly be so that they have the information earlier in their decision-making process and thus would have adequate time to evaluate their options. Finally, based on the survey results, air passengers indicated they would prefer to use e-mail, pagers, telephones, and the Internet when making future travel information inquiries. In particular, business travelers were found to have a higher affinity toward e-mail and pagers, while younger travelers simply preferred newer technologies to receive travel information. As a result, these population categories are prime targets for marketing of information services. Overall, each of these findings was similar to and backed up the results from previous studies...|$|R
40|$|A task {{overload}} condition {{often leads}} to high stress for an operator, causing performance degradation and possibly disastrous consequences. Just as dangerous, with automated flight systems, an operator may experience a task underload condition (during the <b>en-route</b> flight <b>phase,</b> for example), becoming easily bored and finding it difficult to maintain sustained attention. When an unexpected event occurs, either internal or external to the automated system, the disengaged operator may neglect, misunderstand, or respond slowly/inappropriately to the situation. In this paper, we discuss an approach for Operator Functional State (OFS) monitoring in a typical aviation environment. A systematic ground truth finding procedure has been designed based on subjective evaluations, performance measures, and strong physiological indicators. The derived OFS ground truth is continuous in time compared to a very sparse estimation of OFS based on an expert review or subjective evaluations. It can capture the variations of OFS during a mission to better guide through the training process of the OFS assessment model. Furthermore, an OFS assessment model framework based on advanced machine learning techniques was designed and the systematic approach was then verified and validated with experimental data collected in a high fidelity Boeing 737 simulator.

The tool will be tested in the simulated terminal area of Los Angeles International Airport, in a Human-in-the-loop experiment to identify controller procedures and information requirements. The simulation will include comparisons of T-TSAFE with NASA's version of Conflict Alert. Also, some other variables such as altitude entry by the controller, which improve T-TSAFE's predictions for conflict detection, will be tested. T-TSAFE integrates features of current conflict detection tools such as Automated Terminal Proximity Alert used to alleviate compression errors in the final approach phase.

The model describes both the strategic phase associated to the planning of the flight trajectories and the tactical modifications occurring in the <b>en-route</b> <b>phase.</b> An implementation of the model is available as an open-source software and is freely accessible by any user. More specifically, different procedures related to business trajectories and free-routing are tested and we illustrate the capabilities of the model on an airspace which implements these concepts. After performing numerical simulations with the model, we show that in a free-routing scenario the controllers perform less operations but the conflicts are dispersed over a larger portion of the airspace. This can potentially increase the complexity of conflict detection and resolution for controllers. In order to investigate this specific aspect, we consider some metrics used to measure traffic complexity. We first show that in non-free-routing situations our simulator deals with complexity in a way similar to what humans would do. This allows us to be confident that the results of our numerical simulations relative to the free-routing can reasonably forecast how human controllers would behave in this new situation. Specifically, our numerical simulations show that most of the complexity metrics decrease with free-routing, while the few metrics which increase are all linked to the flight level changes. This is a non-trivial result since intuitively the complexity should increase with free-routing because of problematic geometries and more dispersed conflicts over the airspace...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAir {{flows in}} the {{troposphere}} {{have a major}} impact on air traffic safety and operations. By air flows, several phenomena can be distinguished with different spatial and temporal characteristic scales: the mean wind itself, its rapid fluctuations, called turbulence, and wake vortices which are structured motions generated by each aircraft. At low altitudes, during take-off or landing phases, distance separations between aircrafts that limit today airport capacities were set up forty years ago to prevent the rik of wake vortices encounters in worst conditions. These out of date distance separations must be optimized since strength and lifetime of wake vortices vary a lot with weather conditions, like winds and turbulence. At high altitudes, during <b>en-route</b> flight <b>phase,</b> wake vortices as well as clear air turbulence can have a dramatic impact on aircraft safety. In this study, the way to measure wind, turbulence and wake vortices with new remote sensing techniques, 1. 5 micron Coherent Doppler LIDAR, X-Band RADAR, and UV direct detection LIDAR, is detailed for ground-based or airborne applications.

Consequently, each user {{will be able to}} independently conduct an integrity check for their estimated position. This research seeks to enhance the Advanced Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (ARAIM), described in [Ene 2009], as an alternate way to bring airplanes within 200 ft (60 m) of the ground even in poor visibility conditions, and at terrain-constrained airports. In traditional aviation, ground equipment {{plays a major role in}} providing assistance to aircraft for maintaining the desired trajectory during both terminal and <b>en-route</b> <b>phases</b> of flight. However, ground navigational aids owned by the national aviation administrations involve large costs which scale with the total number of airports and the overall air traffic capacity. These operational costs can be reduced by equipping airplanes with GNSS-enabled instrumentation. The integrity requirement of having at most one failure to bound the user position errors over 10 ^- 7 approaches is seen here as the most stringent operational constraint. If the ARAIM algorithm includes an existing fault in the integrity calculation, for which a significantly lower prior probability is assumed, the risk of Hazardously Misleading Information (HMI) being passed onto the aviation user may become higher than the value stated in the integrity requirement. Previously developed fault detection methods for ARAIM in [Ene at al 2007] were validated for removing single faults from each snapshot measurement, but the riskiest conditions may actually ensue from developing multiple-satellite faults. The current paper proposes additional detection criteria for isolating potentially faulty satellites, whose range measurements will then be excluded from the position solution for a longer term, until the health of their signals is reevaluated. Then, a procedure is proposed for the reinclusion of a previously removed ranging source, based either on an autonomous health check or on trusted new external information (e. g. an ISM update). Finally, the proposed fault isolation and reinclusion methods will be implemented within the Multiple Hypothesis Solution Separation (MHSS) ARAIM algorithm framework and validated by running tests under different faulted and fault-free scenarios. The purpose of this work is to propose an enhancement to the ARAIM algorithm, which will help further protect the user against single and multiple potential faults that could invalidate a static set of algorithmic assumptions. This technique will help increase the potential latency period of an external Integrity Support Message (ISM), effectively lowering the constraints on the ground monitoring network and helping reduce its required setup and maintenance costs. Computer simulations and real-time measurements will be used to demonstrate the ability of the new method to increase the robustness of ARAIM to satellite fault latency, while maintaining the previously demonstrated levels of performance, corresponding to the ICAO requirements for LPV- 200 approaches...|$|R
40|$|To our knowledge, {{there has}} been no {{published}} analysis of bird strike data specific to helicopters. Our objective was to conduct a comparative analysis of strike reports involving helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft from the Federal Aviation Administration’s Wildlife Strike Database. From 1990 - 2005, 370 (0. 6 %) of the 64, 734 reported bird strikes to civil aircraft involved helicopters. Of the 370 reported bird strikes involving helicopters, 186 (50 %) indicated damage and 67 (18 %) indicated substantial damage. In contrast, only 15 % of bird strikes with fixed-wing aircraft resulted in damage and 4 % resulted in substantial damage. Whereas helicopters accounted for only 0. 6 % of all bird strikes, helicopters accounted for 13 % (2) of the 16 aircraft destroyed and 24 % (34) of the 141 injuries caused by bird strikes. For helicopters, 63 % of bird strikes and 77 % of damaging strikes occurred during the <b>en-route</b> <b>phase</b> of flight compared to only 2 % and 7 %, respectively, for fixed-wing aircraft. The much higher en-route strike rate for helicopters is related to the lower height at which helicopters typically fly compared to fixed-wing aircraft. For helicopters, about 52 % of strikes occurred from 501 - 2, 000 feet AGL compared to 14 % for fixed-wing aircraft. This is a height zone frequently used by many bird species, especially gulls, waterfowl, raptors and vultures, the species most commonly struck by helicopters. For helicopters, 97 % of strikes causing damage occurred at an indicated airspeed of more than 60 knots. Windshields represented 41 % of helicopter components reported as damaged by bird strikes compared to only 6 % for fixed-wing aircraft. The disproportionate number of windshields damaged and resulting human injuries indicates that improvements are needed in windshield design and strength for helicopters...|$|E
40|$|Major {{airports}} in Europe experience {{a number of}} arrivals close to the maximum of their capacity throughout the day. Multiple aircraft arrive {{at the airport in}} a short time window and often have to be delayed in the airspace surrounding the airport before they are cleared to land. A higher fuel burn and costs for the airlines is the result, but it also has a negative effect on the environment in terms of additional pollution and noise. The Cross-border Arrival Management (XMAN) project, {{which is part of the}} Single European Sky program, tries to reduce the negative effects of delay in the proximity of airports. The main idea is to shift the necessary delay in the Terminal Manoeuvring Area (TMA) or holding towards the cruise flight phase by reducing the speed of aircraft. If an aircraft is inbound for an airport and the expected arrival time is too close to the arrival time of a leading aircraft, the trailing aircraft can be asked to slow down such that it arrives at the airport when the runway is available. The speed reduction or gaining additional flight time is referred to as ‘delay absorption’. Although the shift of delay absorption from the TMA to the <b>en-route</b> <b>phase</b> shows promising results for fuel consumption and reduced emissions, the question rises whether this En-Route Delay Absorption (ERDA) can also have a negative impact on the runway efficiency. If aircraft are delayed too much in an earlier flight phase due to e. g. inaccuracy of the expected arrival times, so called gaps appear in the landing sequence. As a result, the total number of aircraft that actually landed per time period decreases. The idea is that in order to maintain an optimal runway throughput, some expected delay should be left in the TMA for the approach controller to absorb. In that case, the approach controller can fine-tune a tight landing sequence without any gaps that would result in an underused runway when the demand for landings is high. This phenomenon is defined as Runway Pressure. The main goal of this research project is to investigate the effect on the runway throughput when the expected delay is absorbed in the <b>en-route</b> <b>phase.</b> To achieve this goal, different fast time simulations are performed with a model of both Schiphol and Charles de Gaulle airport. The amount of expected delay that needs to be absorbed in an earlier flight phase is calculated in analogy with the working principles of the inbound planning system of both Schiphol and Charles de Gaulle airport. The expected arrival time at the runway is given for an aircraft and compared with the expected arrival time and minimum required separation time of the previous aircraft in the inbound planning. If the trailing aircraft is expected to arrive too soon at the runway, it has to be delayed prior to passing the Initial Approach Fix (IAF). How the aircraft is delayed, is not researched in this project. However, a maximum of five minutes delay absorption in an earlier flight phase is set, based on previous research on this topic. One simulation scenario consists of a period of two hours where the amount of demand for arrivals changes throughout the inbound peak. The demand exceeds the maximum runway capacity for a certain period of time in each arrival peak. The landing sequence order does not change. A comparison is made between scenarios with the same amount of demand throughout the inbound peak, but with all aircraft either experience En-Route Delay Absorption or not. The outcome of the simulations is the average amount of delay in the ? per 20 minutes and the amount of landings per rolling hour. A rolling hour consists of three consecutive time periods of 20 minutes. Based on the simulation outcomes, it can be concluded that ERDA can result in a small decrease of runway throughput, with a maximum of one aircraft per rolling hour. However, a decrease does not always occur. By the end of the inbound peak, the actual landing time of an aircraft with ERDA is between 30 and 90 seconds later than the same aircraft with no ERDA. So the inbound peak is extended in time and shifted backwards with approximately one extra landing when ERDA is applied. The benefit is that aircraft have to spend up to four minutes less in the TMA. An important parameter that determines the runway throughput, is the inter-arrival separation. This separation between different aircraft wake vortex categories is translated from distance to a time based separation. The same time interval at the threshold is used for the interval times between aircraft passing the IAF. The required passing time at the IAF can be calculated by one average flight time for each aircraft category, where a distinction has to be made between the flight time of jet and turboprop engine aircraft. If the total flight time in the TMA between aircraft categories deviates more than one minute, it can be necessary to use different approach paths to the final approach fix for each aircraft category, in order to maintain safety and a sufficient runway throughput. It is important that the calculations of the inter-arrival times at the threshold and IAF are as accurate as possible. If the inter-arrival time for each aircraft is wrongly increased by five to ten seconds, the throughput decreases with two landings per hour. It is meaningful to take this into account when a dynamic time based separation for the threshold is calculated and compensated for strong headwinds. The definition of runway pressure suggests that there is a minimum amount of delay that should be left for the approach controller to absorb, in order to guarantee sufficient runway throughput. From the results of this research, it can be concluded that there will always be a minimum amount of delay that needs to be absorbed in the TMA to optimize the landing sequence. However, the minimum amount of delay in the TMA is a consequence of the difference in flight time between aircraft types and the accuracy of the actual time passing the IAF. If the inter-arrival times at the IAF are set correctly, a minimum amount of delay is not required to maintain sufficient runway throughput. Although a minimum amount of delay in the TMA is not required to maintain runway throughput, not all delay can always be absorbed in earlier flight phases. Therefore, it is recommended to investigate the effect on the workload of air traffic controllers and the delay absorption capacity of the different airspace sectors along the route. If the expected delay is divided and absorbed in the different flight phases along the trajectory towards the airport, the arrival process is easier to manage for all controllers involved.

40|$|The {{popularity}} of Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) {{is growing at}} an increasing rate {{as an alternative to}} manned aviation for different purposes and applications. So far, most of their operations have been of military character, but the demand for civil and commercial applications is growing exponentially. RPAS have been allowed to operate in segregated airspace by restricting other users from entering the volume associated to the operation of the RPAS. This temporary solution based on accommodating their operations on a case-by-case basis is not feasible on the long-term. Moreover, the latest forecast carried out by SESAR Joint Undertaking (SJU) reveals that by 2050 RPAS will represent 20 % of the fleet. The available airspace is a scarce resource and is already saturated, which means that additional unmanned operations would not be possible simultaneously. Integration in non-segregated airspace is the only manner in which the full benefits and capabilities of RPAS will be achieved, while maintaining the same levels of safety and efficiency as manned aviation. In order to achieve a safe, efficient and transparent integration, a common regulatory framework and new technologies are currently under investigation. However, neither operational nor performance standards of RPAS integration have been addressed properly. For that reason, this project is focused on the development of a methodology to determine minimum operational and performance requirements by assessing the impact of RPAS operations on the Air Traffic Management (ATM) Network. The scope is limited to the <b>en-route</b> <b>phase</b> as a starting point since none of the flight phases have been analysed yet. This project is carried out in collaboration with EUROCONTROL. RPAS are well known for presenting a wide range of performance characteristics, especially in terms of cruise speed and rate of climb. Thus, two different unmanned performance models have been chosen from the available performance models in the EUROCONTROL database: RP 01 (MQ- 9), which presents a similar performance to commercial aviation aircraft, and RP 02 (RQ 4 A), which is considered a low-performance RPAS in terms of cruise speed and rate of climb. Building on a base scenario in the Paris Control Terminal Area (CTA),Monte Carlo simulations of the air traffic have been performed in order to randomly vary the main input variable: the set of en-route flights that is substituted by unmanned aircraft. Two different scenarios have been analysed separately in order to establish the requirements: one for same-performance RPAS, and the other for low-performance RPAS. In order to assess the impact, three different Key Performance Areas (KPAs) have been selected: capacity, efficiency and safety. These KPAs are in turn characterized by their corresponding Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), namely sector capacity, sector overload, flight time efficiency, flight path efficiency and number of potential conflicts. Based on an analysis of the current occupancy of the flight levels, operational requirements are defined in terms of altitude segregation. RPAS are not allowed to operate in the most occupied flight levels (FL) : from FL 300 to FL 400. Therefore, depending on their operation and performance characteristics (i. e. ceiling), they will adapt their cruise FL to operate below FL 300 or above FL 400. The optimal value of performance requirements for same-performance RPAS {{has been found to be}} a minimum cruise speed of 390 kts, while for low-performance RPAS this minimum cruise speed is of 280 kts. Additionally, for low-performance RPAS, it is found that the rate of climb of 1, 000 fpm results in the best performing case when changes in FL are required. The results show that the values of the key performance indicators for the base scenario are difficult to reach when RPAS are sharing the airspace. However, the establishment of minimum operational and performance requirements contributes to a significant reduction of the negative impact that the integration of RPAS operations implies. The development of this methodology and its application to the characteristics of each airspace sector will contribute to the full integration of RPAS in non-segregated airspace...|$|E
