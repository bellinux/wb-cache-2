5|$|Millwall {{moved to}} a new stadium, named The Den, in New Cross, South London in 1910. The club had {{previously}} occupied four different grounds in the 25 years since their formation in East London; limited <b>expansion</b> <b>space</b> on the Isle of Dogs meant The Lions had to move to boost support and attendances. The estimated cost of The Den was £10,000. The first match played at the new ground was on 22 October 1910 against reigning Southern League champions Brighton & Hove Albion, who won 1–0.|$|E

The economic strength of Croydon dates back mainly to Croydon Airport which was {{a major factor in the}} development of Croydon as a business centre. Once London's main airport for all international flights to and from the capital, it was closed on 30 September 1959 due to the lack of <b>expansion</b> <b>space</b> needed for an airport to serve the growing city. It is now a Grade II listed building and tourist attraction. Croydon Council and its predecessor Croydon Corporation unsuccessfully applied for city status in 1954, 2000, 2002 and 2012. The area is currently going through a large regeneration project called Croydon Vision 2020 which is predicted to attract more businesses and tourists to the area as well as backing Croydon's bid to become London's Third City (after 'The City' and Westminster). Croydon is mostly urban, though there are large suburban and rural uplands towards the south of the borough. Since 2003, Croydon has been certified as a Fairtrade borough by the Fairtrade Foundation. It was the first London Borough to have Fairtrade status which is awarded on certain criteria.|$|E
500|$|On 17 September 1906, in a Western League game, Millwall player Alf Dean was hurled {{against a}} metal {{advertising}} board by West Ham's Len Jarvis. Others were stretchered off following heavy tackles. The East Ham Echo reported: [...] "From {{the very first}} kick of the ball it was seen likely to be some trouble, but the storm burst when Dean and Jarvis came into collision (Millwall had two players sent off during the match). This aroused considerable excitement among the spectators. The crowds on the bank having caught the fever, free fights were plentiful." [...] In 1910 Millwall decided to drop Athletic from their name and move out of East London. With limited <b>expansion</b> <b>space</b> on the Isle of Dogs, the club wanted to boost support and attendances. It moved four miles to The Den, in New Cross, South London. The last East London derby between the teams was at Millwall's North Greenwich ground on 24 September 1910; West Ham won 2–0 with goals from Danny Shea and Fred Blackburn. Four months later, Millwall travelled to Upton Park as a South London team for the first time. The game ended in a 2–2 draw. On 9 March 1912, 28,400 supporters saw West Ham's first visit to The Den. The Lions won the game 5–1, with their Welsh international striker Wally Davis scoring a hat-trick.|$|E

40|$|A straight-forward {{interpretation}} of standard Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmologies is that objects move apart {{due to the}} <b>expansion</b> of <b>space,</b> and that sufficiently distant galaxies must be receding at velocities exceeding the speed of light. Recently, however, {{it has been suggested}} that a simple transformation into conformal coordinates can remove superluminal recession velocities, and hence the concept of the <b>expansion</b> of <b>space</b> should be abandoned. This work demonstrates that such conformal transformations do not eliminate superluminal recession velocities for open or flat matter-only FRLW cosmologies, and all possess superluminal expansion. Hence, the attack on the concept of the <b>expansion</b> of <b>space</b> based on this is poorly founded. This work concludes by emphasizing that the <b>expansion</b> of <b>space</b> is perfectly valid in the general relativistic framework, however, asking the question of whether space really expands is a futile exercise.
