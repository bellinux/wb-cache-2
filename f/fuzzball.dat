25|$|<b>Fuzzball</b> routers {{were the}} first modern routers on the Internet. They were DEC LSI-11 {{computers}} loaded with router software. First conceptualized by its inventor, David L. Mills, <b>fuzzball</b> routers evolved as a virtual machine supporting the DEC RT-11 operating system and early developmental versions of the TCP/IP protocol and applications suite. Prototype versions of popular Internet tools, including Telnet, FTP, DNS, EGP and SMTP were first implemented and tested on <b>fuzzball</b> routers.|$|E
25|$|Mills was the {{chairman}} of the Gateway Algorithms and Data Structures Task Force (GADS) and the first chairman of the Internet Architecture Task Force. He invented the Network Time Protocol (1981), the DEC LSI-11 based <b>fuzzball</b> router that was used for the 56 kbit/s NSFNET (1985), the Exterior Gateway Protocol (1984), and inspired the author of ping (1983). He is an emeritus professor at the University of Delaware.|$|E

40|$|We {{construct}} {{the first family}} of microstate geometries of near-extremal black holes, by placing metastable supertubes inside certain scaling supersymmetric smooth microstate geometries. These <b>fuzzballs</b> differ from the classical black hole solution macroscopically at the horizon scale, and for certain probes the fluctuations between various <b>fuzzballs</b> will be visible as thermal noise {{far away from the}} horizon. We discuss whether these <b>fuzzballs</b> appear to infalling observers as <b>fuzzballs</b> of fuzz or as <b>fuzzballs</b> of fire. The existence of these solutions suggests that the singularity of non-extremal black holes is resolved {{all the way to the}} outer horizon and this "backwards in time" singularity resolution can shed light on the resolution of spacelike cosmological singularities.

Outdoor <b>fuzzball</b> can be played either on paved school playgrounds (typically marked off for kickball) or on a {{baseball}} or softball field. Serious players will also use a cigarette lighter or a blowtorch to burn the felt off of the ball, thereby making it much faster when pitched. Bats may consist of broom handles, baseball bats, corkball bats, or official <b>fuzzball</b> bats, such as those made by Markwort Sporting Goods of St. Louis, Missouri. Markwort also makes an official <b>fuzzball</b> for use in games.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Fuzzball</b> is a bat-and-ball street game {{related to}} baseball, usually {{formed as a}} pick-up game, and played in various areas of the United States (especially St. Louis, but also in Chicago where it is called [...] "strikeout", Florida, and South Carolina). The {{equipment}} consists of a bat and a tennis ball that has had its outer layer burned or worn off. The rules come from baseball and are modified to fit the situation, i.e. whether it is played indoors or outside. <b>Fuzzball</b> can be played by as few as two players; outside of leagues in St. Louis, the Bevo Area <b>Fuzzball</b> League and the St. Louis Metro <b>Fuzzball</b> League, it exists as a pickup game, which has been successfully transplanted to [...] "players leagues" [...] which play a quasi-legal, quasi-outlaw version in Philadelphia and Northern California (San Jose and Santa Cruz, specifically). There are also fully official organized leagues for indoor <b>fuzzball</b> in St. Louis. Interest in the game was waning, however, {{at the turn of}} the century: by 2004, most serious players were in their 40's, with a decreasing number of new players becoming interested. Many St. Louis locals consider <b>fuzzball</b> to be a minor league training ground for future corkball players.|$|E

40|$|This work {{explores the}} role of {{thermodynamic}} fluctuations in the two parameter giant and superstar configurations characterized by an ensemble of arbitrary liquid droplets or irregular shaped <b>fuzzballs.</b> Our analysis illustrates that the chemical and state-space geometric descriptions exhibit an intriguing set of exact pair correction functions and the global correlation lengths. The first principle of statistical mechanics shows that the possible canonical fluctuations may precisely be ascertained without any approximation. Interestingly, our intrinsic geometric study exemplifies that there exist exact fluctuating 1 / 2 -BPS statistical configurations which involve an ensemble of microstates describing the liquid droplets or <b>fuzzballs.</b> The Gaussian fluctuations over an equilibrium chemical and state-space configurations accomplish a well-defined, non-degenerate, curved and regular intrinsic Riemannian manifolds for all physically admissible domains of black hole parameters. An explicit computation demonstrates that the underlying chemical correlations involve ordinary summations, whilst the state-space correlations may simply be depicted by standard polygamma functions. Our construction ascribes definite stability character to the canonical energy fluctuations and to the counting entropy associated with an arbitrary choice of excited boxes from an ensemble of ample boxes constituting a variety of Young tableaux.

40|$|When a shell collapses {{through its}} horizon, semiclassical physics {{suggests}} that information cannot escape from this horizon. One might hope that nonperturbative quantum gravity effects will change this situation {{and avoid the}} `information paradox'. We note that string theory has provided a set of states over which the wavefunction of the shell can spread, and {{that the number of}} these states is large enough that such a spreading would significantly modify the classically expected evolution. In this article we perform a simple estimate of the spreading time, showing that it is much shorter than the Hawking evaporation time for the hole. Thus information can emerge from the hole through the relaxation of the shell state into a linear combination of <b>fuzzballs.</b> Comment: 6 pages, Latex (Essay awarded honorable mention in the Gravity Research Foundation essay competition 2009...|$|R

40|$|It is {{conventionally}} {{believed that}} if a ball of matter of mass M has a radius close to 2 GM then it must collapse to a black hole. But string theory microstates (<b>fuzzballs)</b> have no horizon or singularity, {{and they do not}} collapse. We consider two simple examples from classical gravity to illustrate how this violation of our intuition happens. In each case the `matter' arises from an extra compact dimension, but the topology of this extra dimension is not trivial. The pressure and density of this matter diverge at various points, but this is only an artifact of dimensional reduction; thus we bypass results like Buchadahl's theorem. Such microstates give the entropy of black holes, so these topologically nontrivial constructions dominate the state space of quantum gravity.

40|$|The {{black hole}} {{information}} paradox has caused enormous confusion over four decades. But in recent years, the theorem of quantum strong-subaddditivity has sorted out the possible resolutions into three sharp categories: (A) No new physics at r≫ l_p; this necessarily implies remnants/information loss. A realization of remnants {{is given by}} a baby Universe attached near r∼ 0. (B) Violation of the `no-hair' theorem by nontrivial effects at the horizon r∼ M. This possibility is realized by <b>fuzzballs</b> in string theory, and gives unitary evaporation. (C) Having the vacuum at the horizon, but requiring that Hawking quanta at r∼ M^ 3 be somehow identified with degrees of freedom inside the black hole. A model for this `extreme nonlocality' is realized by conjecturing that wormholes connect the radiation quanta to the hole.

We have analyzed the state-space geometry in the case of various extremal and non-extremal black branes arising from the string theories, multi-centered black brane configurations, small black holes with fractional branes, fuzzy rings in the set up of Mathur’s <b>fuzzballs</b> and subensemble theory, as well as that the black brane foams from the considerations of bubbling black brane solutions in the M-theory.

40|$|Abstract: It is {{generally}} {{believed that the}} eternal AdS black hole is dual to two confor-mal field theories with compact spatial sections that are together in a thermofield double state. We argue that this proposal is incorrect, and by extension so are the “entangle-ment=geometry ” proposal of Van Raamsdonk and “ER=EPR ” proposal of Maldacena and Susskind. We show that in the bulk there is an interaction needed between {{the two halves of}} the Hilbert space for connectivity across the horizon; however, there is no such interaction between the CFTs. This rules out the possibility of the dual to the CFTs being the eternal AdS black hole. We argue the correct dual “geometries ” resemble the exterior of the black hole outside the stretched horizon but cap off before the global horizon. This disallows the possibility of a shared future (and past) wedge where Alice falling from one side can meet Bob falling from the other. We expect that in the UV complete theory the aforementioned caps will be <b>fuzzballs.</b> ar X i...|$|R
40|$|This {{work can}} be {{summarized}} as trying to understand aspects of black holes, gravity, and geometry, {{in the context of}} supergravity and string theory in high-energy theoretical physics. The two parts of this thesis have been written with entirely different audiences in mind. The first part consists of chapters 1, 2, 3 and is composed of a self-contained laymen's introduction to my research. The second part of this thesis, consisting of chapters 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 contains the main part of this thesis, and is therefore written in a scientific manner. Chapter 4 introduces black holes in general and the various concepts of the subsequent chapters; it also describes how the research presented in those chapters fits into the bigger picture regarding the study of black holes. Following the introductory chapter 4, chapter 5 discusses my research on the concept of exotic branes; chapter 6 deals with my contributions to the study of higher derivatives in gravitational theories; and chapter 7 details my contributions to multi-centered configurations, especially in the context of <b>fuzzballs.</b> Chapter 8 summarizes the main results of the previous three chapters and provides an outlook on possible interesting future directions of research in these subjects...|$|R
