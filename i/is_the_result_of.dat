5|$|Ionic {{compounds}} containing hydrogen ions (H+) {{are classified}} as acids, and those containing electropositive cations and basic anions ions hydroxide (OH−) or oxide (O2−) {{are classified as}} bases. Other ionic compounds are known as salts and can be formed by acid–base reactions. If the compound <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> a reaction between a strong acid and a weak base, {{the result is an}} acidic salt. If it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> a reaction between a strong base and a weak acid, the result is a basic salt. If it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> a reaction between a strong acid and a strong base, the result is a neutral salt. Weak acids reacted with weak bases can produce ionic compounds with both the conjugate base ion and conjugate acid ion, such as ammonium acetate.|$|E

5|$|Although some {{radio waves}} are emitted {{directly}} by astronomical objects, {{a product of}} thermal emission, most of the radio emission that is observed <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> synchrotron radiation, which is produced when electrons orbit magnetic fields. Additionally, a number of spectral lines produced by interstellar gas, notably the hydrogen spectral line at 21cm, are observable at radio wavelengths.|$|E
5|$|Ancient Christian {{tradition}} {{says that}} Christianity reached {{the shores of}} Kerala in AD 52 {{with the arrival of}} Thomas the Apostle, one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus Christ. Saint Thomas Christians include Syro-Malabar Catholic, Syro-Malankara Catholic, Malankara Orthodox Syrian, Jacobite Syrian, Marthoma Syrian, the Syrian Anglicans in the CSI and several Pentecostal and evangelical denominations. The origin of the Latin Catholic Christians in Kerala <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> the missionary endeavours of the Portuguese Padroado in the 16th century.|$|E

5|$|Brane {{cosmology}} models, {{in which}} inflation {{is due to}} the movement of branes in string theory; the pre-Big Bang model; the ekpyrotic model, in which the Big Bang <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> a collision between branes; and the cyclic model, a variant of the ekpyrotic model in which collisions occur periodically. In the latter model the Big Bang was preceded by a Big Crunch and the universe cycles from one process to the other.|$|E
5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, Newton's law of universal gravitation had been accepted for more than two hundred years as a valid description of the gravitational force between masses. In Newton's model, gravity <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> an attractive force between massive objects. Although even Newton was troubled by the unknown nature of that force, the basic framework was extremely successful at describing motion.|$|E

5|$|COPD {{is a type}} of obstructive {{lung disease}} in which chronic incompletely {{reversible}} poor airflow (airflow limitation) and inability to breathe out fully (air trapping) exist. The poor airflow <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> breakdown of lung tissue (known as emphysema) and small airways disease (known as obstructive bronchiolitis). The relative contributions of these two factors vary between people. Severe destruction of small airways can lead to the formation of large air pockets—known as bullae—that replace lung tissue. This form of disease is called bullous emphysema.|$|E
5|$|Eland herds are {{accompanied}} by a loud clicking sound that has been subject to considerable speculation. It is believed that {{the weight of the}} animal causes the two halves of its hooves to splay apart, and the clicking <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> the hoof snapping together when the animal raises its leg. The sound carries some distance from a herd, and may be a form of communication.|$|E
5|$|Endometrial {{cancer is}} a cancer that arises from the {{endometrium}} (the lining of the uterus or womb). It <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> the abnormal growth of cells that {{have the ability to}} invade or spread {{to other parts of the}} body. The first sign is most often vaginal bleeding not associated with a menstrual period. Other symptoms include pain with urination, pain during sexual intercourse, or pelvic pain. Endometrial cancer occurs most commonly after menopause.|$|E
25|$|It is {{alternatively}} hypothesised that cattle mutilations <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> two unrelated deviant phenomena. The bulk <b>of</b> mutilations <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> predation {{and other}} natural processes, and those with anomalies that cannot be explained in this way <b>are</b> <b>the</b> work of humans who derive pleasure or sexual stimulation from mutilating animals.|$|R
25|$|Phylogenetic {{analysis}} shows that modern dog mDNA haplotypes resolve into four monophyletic clades with strong statistical support, and {{these have been}} designated by researchers as clades A-D. Other studies that included a wider sample of specimens have reported two rare East Asian clades E-F with weaker statistical support. In 2009, a study found that haplogroups A, B and C included 98% of dogs and are found universally distributed across Eurasia, indicating that they <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> a single domestication event, and that haplogroups D, E, and F were rare and appeared to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> regional hybridization with local wolves post-domestication. Haplogroups A and B contained subclades that appeared to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> hybridization with wolves post-domestication, because each haplotype within each <b>of</b> these subclades <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> a female wolf/male dog pairing.|$|R

5|$|Famine {{is shaped}} by {{generally}} two theories. The first is FAD, Food Availability Decline. This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> a drought, a war, or some other drastic change to the agricultural system. This is the natural cause for famine. The other theory deals primarily with the population’s ability to access or become entitled to food. In this case, food power makes itself known on a small scale, as opposing political forces in Sudan compete for the votes of the people by instigating or encouraging the famine.|$|E

5|$|He {{showed that}} {{coloured}} light {{does not change}} its properties by separating out a coloured beam and shining it on various objects, and that regardless of whether reflected, scattered, or transmitted, the light remains the same colour.

This is known as Newton's theory of colour.|$|E
