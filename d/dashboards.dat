40|$|The Social Research Network Sites (SRNS) is {{an online}} {{platform}} used by researchers for research related activities. Due to {{huge amounts of}} information in the current SRNS, sometimes this information overwhelms the researchers. A research-related <b>dashboard</b> information model is proposed to minimize the information overflow in the SRNS and it provides awareness on research-related information. The analysis on the relevance of having a <b>dashboard</b> has been done, and the results shows {{that it is a}} significant tool in assisting the researcher needs on monitoring their own research performance, monitoring research trends and alerting them with upcoming events. The proposed <b>dashboard</b> items that are possible {{to be included in the}} <b>dashboard</b> information model are identified based on analysis from literature studies and by review on the current SRNS. A survey was conducted in order to validate the <b>dashboard</b> items. Based on the result of factor analysis, the <b>dashboard</b> items can be grouped into three which are publication impact, publication achievements and alert on upcoming events. From the three group of the <b>dashboard</b> items, the <b>dashboard</b> information model is developed that has three <b>dashboard</b> components which are researcher performance (M 1), impact of researcher publication (M 2) and research events alert (M 3). Then, we design a mock-up prototyping which represent the <b>dashboard</b> information model. The mock-up prototyping has been used for the <b>dashboard</b> information model verification purpose through interview with selected researchers. The result from the interview has shown that the researchers accepted and intended to use the mock-up prototyping that representing the <b>dashboard</b> information model. A few suggestions for enhancement of the <b>dashboard</b> items to be included in the <b>dashboard</b> information model have been received from the feedbacks. The <b>dashboard</b> information model that has been established is useful to be embedded in SRNS in order to aware the researchers on the research-related information. The embedded of the <b>dashboard</b> information model in the SRNS can attract more users to use the SRNS. The developers of SRNS can utilize the <b>dashboard</b> information model as a guideline in developing a better SRNS for the researchers...|$|R

40|$|The {{implementation}} of the Business Intelligence (BI) <b>dashboard</b> in the manufacturing organizations has shown an upward trend.

The <b>dashboard</b> used in those manufacturing organizations has its own characteristics to serve its purpose. This paper will review the previous literatures related to the {{implementation of}} <b>dashboard</b> in the manufacturing organizations and to find out the common characteristics that serve the manufacturing organizations’ needs, as well as the type of <b>dashboard</b> that is commonly used. The review shows that the characteristics of <b>dashboard</b> needed by most of the manufacturing organizations have to be in real-time, include historical and future data (if possible) and include colorful graphs and charts for better visual. The operational <b>dashboard</b> is the most commonly used in the manufacturing industry. With the <b>dashboard</b> features discussed, hopefully it could built up confidence for future study on the characteristics to consider during the development of the <b>dashboard</b> for usage in a manufacturing organization...|$|R

25|$|The {{interior}} of The new Panorama Elite {{was to the}} usual high standard that everyone had come to expect from a leading coachbuilder like Plaxton. It made more use of laminate than before but this was tastefully specified & well balanced. The interior skirt panels, racks and front cabinet made extensive use of this easily worked & easy to maintain material. The analogue clock in the front dome was flanked either side by small square controllable air vents. The dashboard was improved and made use of a panel of rocker switches {{in front of the}} driver with each switch designation lighting for night time operation. Previous <b>dashboards</b> hid the switches in places inaccessible whilst moving. Ventilation was again improved though using the same design of moulded air output & light assembly as {{the final version of the}} Panorama I.

25|$|Common market health {{measures}} such as GDP and GNP {{have been used as}} a measure of successful policy. On average richer nations tend to be happier than poorer nations, but this effect seems to diminish with wealth. This has been {{explained by the fact that}} the dependency is not linear but logarithmic, i.e., the same percentual increase in the GNP produces the same increase in happiness for wealthy countries as for poor countries. Increasingly, academic economists and international economic organisations are arguing for and developing multi-dimensional <b>dashboards</b> which combine subjective and objective indicators to provide a more direct and explicit assessment of human wellbeing. Work by Paul Anand and colleagues helps to highlight the fact that there many different contributors to adult wellbeing, that happiness judgement reflect, in part, the presence of salient constraints, and that fairness, autonomy, community and engagement are key aspects of happiness and wellbeing throughout the life course.|$|E

By analyzing a large amount of computation resulted from the fact that traditional Hough transform uses divergent mapping methods, paper puts forward the methods of improving the convergence of the mapping and conducts parameter space mapping, which effectively reduces the amount of computation. After that, combining with the actual picture of a bus <b>dashboard,</b> automatic detection experiment was carried out for the proposed algorithm.
