Ritter and Baehr (1) described renal arteriolar sclerosis in congenital polycystic disease of the kidney and remarked upon a preliminary period of arterial hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy and <b>hyposthenuria</b> that usually precedes the terminal uremia in that disease.

40|$|Objective: Bardet-Biedl {{syndrome}} (BBS) {{is a rare}} {{genetic disorder}} whose clinical features include renal abnormalities, which ranges from renal malformations to renal failure. Polyuria and iso-hyposthenuria are common renal dysfunctions in BBS patients even {{in the presence of}} normal GFR. The mechanism underlying this defect is unknown and no genotype-phenotype correlation has yet been reported. Here we report four BBS patients showing different renal phenotypes: one had polyuria with <b>hyposthenuria</b> associated with mutation of BBS 10, while three patients with normal urine concentrating ability had mutations in BBS 1. Methods: We measured aquaporin 2 (AQP 2) urinary excretions in BBS patients and studied the possible role of BBS 1 and BBS 10 on AQP 2 trafficking in a mouse cortical collecting duct cell line. Results: We found that the BBS 1 -mutated patients showed a significant increase of water channel AQP 2 urine excretion in antidiuresis. In contrast, the BBS 10 -mutated patient showed no difference in AQP 2 excretion in antidiuresis and after an acute water load. In mouse kidney cortical collecting duct MCD 4 cells, knockdown of BBS 10, but not of BBS 1, prevented the forskolin-dependent trafficking of AQP 2 to the apical membrane, and induced the mis-trafficking to the basolateral membrane. Interestingly, BBS 10 knockdown was associated with a dramatic reduction of tubulin acetylation without loss of cell polarity. Conclusions: Therefore, the effect of BBS 10 knockdown in vitro is consistent with the <b>hyposthenuria</b> observed in the patient with mutation of BBS 10. This correlation between renal phenotype and genotype indicates that BBS 10, but not BBS 1, might control the trafficking of AQP 2 and therefore {{plays a key role in}} the renal concentrating mechanism...|$|E

40|$|A {{review of}} the {{literature}} on sickle cell trait was completed by Sears in 1978. Since that time, several papers have been published concerning the possible health risks of sickle cell trait. Data presented from these studies show that there is no association with sickle cell trait and overall survival, overall mortality, overall morbidity, frequency and length of hospitalization, short-term survival of renal transplant recipient, and inheritance of glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase. Association with sickle cell trait is very likely in the following: splenic infarction at high altitudes (over 10, 000 feet), in unpressurized airplane flight and mountain climbing, bacteriuria and pyelonephritis in pregnancy, <b>hyposthenuria,</b> hematuria, and delayed resolution of anterior chamber hyphema. Although these conditions have a statistical significant association with sickle cell trait, they occur quite infrequently. Thus, when they are observed, other causes should be sought before attributing them to sickle cell trait.

40|$|Observations are {{presented}} on two {{patients with chronic}} compulsive polydipsia who showed a relative defect in renal concentrating capacity. After excluding all possible metabolic and renal causes of <b>hyposthenuria</b> and after obtaining normal kidney biopsies, both patients were studied in metabolic balance on a constant diet under the following conditions: (a) dehydration (loss of 3 - 5 % body weight), (b) water loading and response to hypertonic saline, and (c) water loading and response to intravenous vasopressin (Pitressin). Throughout these studies the following parameters were observed: plasma and urine osmolality, glomerular filtration rate (inulin), renal plasma flow (P. A. H.), osmolar clearance and clearance of free water. In both patients the concentration defect {{was not related to}} variations in glomerular filtration rate or osmotic load. There was no correlation between the degree of hypoosmolality and the renal concentrating defect.

40|$|Case summary A 10 -month-old {{neutered}} male {{domestic shorthair}} cat {{presented with a}} 4 month history of polyuria and polydipsia. After a thorough diagnostic work-up the only abnormal findings were <b>hyposthenuria</b> and an elevated random plasma osmolality level. Trial therapy with the oral and ophthalmic forms of desmopressin failed to concentrate urine. A modified water deprivation test confirmed the ability to concentrate urine above a urine specific gravity (USG) of 1. 035. After transitioning the cat to a higher sodium diet and instituting several enrichment changes to the cat’s environment, average water consumption and urine output levels decreased to almost normal levels and USG increased from 1. 006 to 1. 022.

Gaslyte analysis revealed severe hypernatremia (195. 1 mmol/L) and a mixed acid-base disturbance. Based on these results, as well as specific clinical signs that developed during hospitalization (polyuria and <b>hyposthenuria),</b> trauma-induced central diabetes insipidus was suspected. Parenteral treatment with desmopressin acetate (dDAVP) via subcutaneous injection was initiated at a dose of 4 mcg once a day, which improved his clinical signs and thereby confirmed our diagnosis. After four days, parenteral treatment was stopped in favor of beginning topical treatment with dDAVP (0. 01 % nasal solution). One drop, or 1. 5 - 4 mcg, was instilled into the conjunctival sac twice a day. The patient was released {{to the care of}} his owner following improvement of his hydration and neurologic status.

40|$|Amphotericin B (AMB), either {{alone or}} {{incorporated}} into small unilamellar vesicles of pure dipalmitoylphos-phatidyl choline (DPPC SUV-AMB), was administered intravenously to male Sprague-Dawley rats once daily for 5 days. Either 1. 5 or 3. 5 mg of AMB or DPPC SUV-AMB per kg was given, since these concentrations corresponded, respectively, {{to the lowest}} nephrotoxic dose and the sublethal dose of AMB in our model. Tubular functions were evaluated daily, and AMB concentrations in plasma, urine, and tissues were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. AMB at both doses induced tubular toxicity, <b>hyposthenuria</b> being the earliest symptom. DPPC SUV-AMB at 1. 5 mg/kg/day was atoxic, but the tubular alterations induced by 3. 5 mg of DPPC SUV-AMB per kg {{were similar to those}} observed with 3. 5 mg of AMB per kg, except that the ability to concentrate urine was partly restored 72 h after the last infusion. Incorporating AMB into DPPC SUV did not influence the pharmacokinetics of the drug. Using this lipidic AMB formulation, we thus observed a beneficial effect toward limiting the renal tubular toxicity of repeated low doses of AMB but, unexpectedly, not that of high doses. These results indicate that tubular renal functions and electrolyte serum values should be closely monitored in patients treated with AMB liposomal formulations, especially high-dose regimens.

40|$|Rhabdomyolysis is a {{potentially}} lethal syndrome result-ing from the lysis of muscle fibers with leakage of po-tentially toxic cellular contents into the systemic circula-tion.

Common etiological risk factors are di-verse including alcohol abuse, recent soft tissue compres-sion or trauma, seizure activity, drug abuse, hypothermia, sepsis, metabolic derangements, gangrene, connective tis-sue disorders, inherited myopathies, and burns. Rhabdomy-olysis was first associated with hyponatremia secondary to psychogenic polydipsia (PP) in 1979. 1 Since then, only 27 such cases have been described. 2 - 17 The final common path-way of rhabdomyolysis {{has been described as}} a distur-bance in the calcium homeostasis of the myocyte leading to cell breakdown and enzyme leakage to occur. 12, 13 PP has a prevalence varying between 6. 2 % and 20 % in the severely psychiatrically disabled population, with se-vere hyponatremia developing in almost one-fourth of these patients.

40|$|Response of {{cortical}} {{collecting ducts}} from remnant kidneys to arginine vasopressin. Chronic renal failure {{is associated with}} impaired urine concentration. Previous {{studies have demonstrated that}} cortical collecting ducts (CCD) from uremic rabbits (with remnant kidneys) have an impaired response to arginine vasopressin (AVP). To determine whether this defect is an early, integral component of compensatory renal growth by the remnant kidney, we studied the response of CCD derived from rabbits one week after 75 % nephrectomy. At one week, hypertrophy and adaptation in sodium transport are fully developed, but azotemia and interstitial fibrosis are absent. The animals with remnant kidneys failed to respond normally to water deprivation and dDAVP (maximum urine osmolality 738 ± 29. 1 mOsm/kg compared to 1378 ± 207 in sham operated). However, in isolated, perfused CCD from remnant kidneys, AVP stimulated hydraulic water permeability to the same extent as in normal CCD or CCD from sham operated animals. AVP-induced cAMP generation per mm tubule length was significantly higher in the CCD from remnant kidneys (137. 4 ± 14. 5 fmol/mm) than in the control group (82. 4 ± 11. 9 fmol/mm), but not different when expressed per µ% protein. These studies demonstrate that one week after reduction in renal mass there is no defect in the response of CCD to AVP, suggesting that the mechanisms responsible for the <b>hyposthenuria</b> after loss of renal mass are not related to any intrinsic cellular changes that occur in CCD early during compensatory renal growth...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Nephrogenic {{diabetes}} insipidus {{is characterized by}} a lack of response in the distal nephron to the antidiuretic hormone arginine vasopressin. Manifestations include polyuria, polydipsia, <b>hyposthenuria,</b> recurrent episodes of dehydration and fever and growth failure. Most cases are caused by mutations in the AVPR 2 gene. The mutant receptors are trapped intracellularly. METHOD: We studied five boys using clinical, laboratory and molecular data. The mean age at diagnosis was 14. 6 months (range 6 to 24) and 12. 2 years (7. 8 to 19) after the follow-up period. The mean period of follow-up was 132. 2 ± 50. 9 months. RESULTS: The geometric means of the z-scores of weight and stature were - 4. 5 and - 3. 6, respectively, at diagnosis. At the last medical appointment, the z-scores of weight and stature were - 0. 3 and - 0. 9, respectively. Three patients were diagnosed with ureterohydronephrosis and exhibited increased post-void urine volume. Mutations in the AVPR 2 gene were found in all patients, and the carrier status was confirmed in four of five cases. Two unrelated children presented identical mutations (S 167 L) in arginine vasopressin R 2. Two of the patients had a mutation that has already been described in other Brazilian families (R 337 X), and one patient showed a de novo mutation (Y 128 D) in arginine vasopressin R 2, since his mother's molecular analysis was normal. The recurrence risk for this family was significantly reduced. CONCLUSION: This study reports the clinical and laboratory characterization of Nephrogenic {{diabetes insipidus}} and reiterates the importance of the genetic basis that underlies the disease diagnosis and genetic counseling...|$|E

This is an {{open access}} article {{distributed}} under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. Diabetes Insipidus (DI) is either due to deficient secretion of arginine vasopressin (central) or to tubular unresponsiveness (nephrogenic). Drug induced DI is a well-known entity with an extensive list of medications. Polyuria is generally defined as urine output exceeding 3 liters per day in adults. It is crucial to identify the cause of diabetes insipidus and to implement therapy {{as early as possible}} to prevent the electrolyte disturbances and the associated mortality and morbidity. It is very rare to have an idiosyncratic effect after a short use of a medication, and physicians should be aware of such a complication to avoid volume depletion. The diagnosis of diabetes insipidus is very challenging because it relies on laboratory values, urine output, and the physical examination of the patient. A high clinical suspicion of diabetes insipidus should be enough to initiate treatment. The complications related to DI are mostly related to the electrolyte imbalance that can affect the normal physiology of different organ systems. 1. Background Though it is a rare disorder, diabetes insipidus was first described in the 18 th century [1]. Diabetes insipidus (DI) is either due to deficient secretion of arginine vasopressin (AVP), also known as antidiuretic hormone (ADH) by the pituitary gland (central diabetes insipidus) or due to renal tubular unresponsiveness to AVP (nephrogenic DI). This leads to polyuria, polydipsia with <b>hyposthenuria,</b> causing dehydration and hypernatremia if the patient is deprived of water [2]...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY In {{a patient}} with {{juvenile}} nephronophthisis, sector retinitis pigmentosa was found as an extrarenal manifestation, establishing a hitherto undescribed variety of retinal degeneration occurring in this disorder. The retinal function {{in this case was}} identical with that in the classic type of sector retinitis pigmentosa, namely, subnormal ERG amplitudes but normal cone and rod implicit times. The range of the retinal findings and their autosomal recessive transmission are discussed. Paucity of information makes it difficult to elucidate the basic genetic defect operating in this condition. Juvenile nephronophthisis (Fanconi et al., 1951) and medullary cystic disease (Smith and Graham, 1945) are hereditary conditions characterised clinically by failure to thrive, anaemia, <b>hyposthenuria,</b> and salt craving, followed by early uraemia. The consensus of most observers is that these diseases are identical, and owing to their clinical and pathological simi-larities they have been grouped together (Mongeau and Worthen, 1967). The presence of extrarenal manifestations in juvenile nephronophthisis is obvious (Mainzer et al., 1970; Boichis et al., 1973), and the most frequent allied condition is tapeto-retinal degeneration (Senior et al., 1961). There is ample evidence of such an association in familial cases, and it appears to be due to a pleiotropic effect of the gene involved and not a coincidence of symptoms. A common genetic background for the renal and retinal disor-ders has been postulated and autosomal recessive inheritance invoked. We report here a new case ofjuvenile nephronoph-thisis which involved a type of retinal degeneration not yet reported in connection with this complex renal disorder.

40|$|A {{defect in}} urine concentrating ability occurs in {{individuals}} with sickle cell trait (HbAS). This {{may result from}} intracellular polymerization of sickle hemoglobin (HbS) in erythrocytes, leading to microvascular occlusion, in the vasa recta of the renal medulla. To test {{the hypothesis that the}} severity of the concentrating defect is related to the percentage of sickle hemoglobin present in erythrocytes, urinary concentrating ability was examined after overnight water deprivation, and intranasal desmopressin acetate (dDAVP) in 27 individuals with HbAS. The HbAS individuals were separated into those who had a normal alpha-globin genotype (alpha alpha/alpha alpha), and those who were either heterozygous (-alpha/alpha alpha) or homozygous (-alpha/-alpha) for gene-deletion alpha-thalassemia, because alpha-thalassemia modulates the HbS concentration in HbAS. The urinary concentrating ability was less in the alpha alpha/alpha alpha genotype than in the -alpha/alpha alpha or -alpha/-alpha genotypes (P less than 0. 05). After dDAVP, the urine osmolality was greater in patients with the -alpha/-alpha genotype than with the -alpha/alpha alpha genotype (882 +/- 37 vs. 672 +/- 38 mOsm/kg H 2 O) (P less than 0. 05); patients with the -alpha/alpha alpha genotype had greater concentrating ability than individuals with a normal alpha-globin gene arrangement. There was an inverse linear correlation between urinary osmolality after dDAVP and the percentage HbS in all patients studied (r = - 0. 654; P less than 0. 05). A linear correlation also existed for urine concentrating ability and the calculated polymerization tendencies for an oxygen saturation of 0. 4 and O (r = - 0. 62 and 0. 69, respectively). We conclude that the severity of <b>hyposthenuria</b> in HbAS is heterogeneous. It is determined by the amount of HbS polymer, that in turn is dependent upon the percentage HbS, which is itself related to the alpha-globin genotype...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{earliest}} manifestations of potassium depletion is {{a reduction in the}} ability of the kidneys to elaborate a concentrated urine. ' This defect has been shown to result at least in part from a decrease in the concentration of sodium in the interstitial fluids of the renal medulla and papilla. 9 The disturbance in renal concentrating ability may exist without impairment of glomerular filtration rate; renal extraction of para-aminohippurate' 0 and the ability of the kidneys to excrete a highly acid urine, however, are frequently deficient. ' The present experiments have explored the ability of potassium-deficient animals to excrete a dilute urine in response to a water load. In contrast to certain other diseases of the kidney accompanied by <b>hyposthenuria,</b> the kidneys of potassium-depleted animals appear to dilute the urine normally. Studies of urinary dilution and concentration in two patients with severe potassium deficiency are also reported. METHODS Twenty-one white male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 170 - 220 grams were divided into experimental and control groups. Ten rats comprised the experimental group and were depleted of potassium by diet and desoxycorticosterone (DCA). Eleven rats served as controls and were fed a normal diet throughout the experiment. Both groups were studied concomitantly. Following an initial seven days of normal diet, both groups were subjected to a water-loading test. Water equal to 5 per cent of body weight was given in a single dose by gastric intubation and the animal placed in a metabolic cage. During the next two to three hours, urine was collected in three consecutive aliquots of at least 2. 5 ml. and the osmolality of each sample determined with the Fiske osmometer.

40|$|Background and Objective: Cystinosis {{is a rare}} {{autosomal}} recessive disorder caused by accumulation of cystine in different organs. Infantile cystinosis characterized by Fanconi syndrome and growth retardation leading to renal failure. The aim {{of the study was}} to evaluate the clinical and laboratory findings of cystinotic patients attending at Mofid, Labafinejad hospitals (in Tehran) and Abuzar children’s hospital (in Ahvaz), Iran. Subjects and Methods: During 1995 - 2010, all children with cystinosis hospitalized at the above three centers were enrolled. Patients with the following criteria were considered as cases of cystinosis: i) signs and symptoms of Fanconi syndrome ii) Presence of cystine crystals in cornea using slit lamp. Results: Of all the subjeces, 44 children fulfilled the criteria of nephropathic cystinosis. There were 24 (54. 05 %) females and 20 (45. 5 %) males. Among them, 21 (47. 7 %) cases were Arabs. The mean age of onset of symptoms was 8 (range 3 - 18) months. The mean age at the initial presentation of chronic renal failure was 3 years. The most common clinical features in the patients were growth retardation (100 %), presence of cystine crystal in cornea(100 %), rickets(86 %) and polyuria-polydipsia (83 %). The commonest laboratory data were glucosuria (100 %), renal tubular acidosis (97 %), proteinuria (88. 5 %) and <b>hyposthenuria</b> (82 %). Sixteen (36. 3 %) of the 44 patients received kidney transplant, of which 7 (43. 7 %) patients rejected their grafts. Finally, 13 (29. 5 %) of them were relatively good on medical treatment, 8 (18. 1 %) died, 2 (4. 5 %) on waiting list of kidney transplant and 21 (47. 7 %) missed follow up. Conclusion: Although cystinosis is a rare disease in the world, it seems to be a relatively common hereditary disease with unfavorable prognosis in Iranian Arabs.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decades {{experimental}} and clinical studies have provided considerable new {{insight into the}} pathogenesis of pyelonephritis and clinical scarring. The role of bacterial virulence and host defense factors has been recognized including {{a greater understanding of}} the importance of the acute inflammation response associated with both reflux and nonreflux pyelonephritis in the etiology of irreversible renal scarring. The late clinical sequelae of renal scarring are well recognized including hypertension, <b>hyposthenuria,</b> proteinuria eclampsia in pregnancy and in most severe cases chronic renal insufficiency. It is this potential for significant morbidity from Urinary Tract Infections (UTI) in childhood that has led to the current emphasis on early and accurate diagnosis, prompt antibiotic treatment and early evaluation of the urinary tract of infants and young children with documented infections. Accurate diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis (APN) on the basis of classic signs and symptoms is often difficult, particularly in neonates and infants. The great value of DMSA scan in distinguishing pyelonephritis from lower UTI has been recognized and it is now considered the reference method for the diagnosis of renal involvement. However, it is an expensive examination that is not readily available in all centers and it also exposes the patient to radiation. Several studies have attempted to correlate clinical and laboratory parameters with the site of UTI but the results have been conflicting. The clinical parameters and inflammatory markers that primarily have been used as indexes for the differentiation of lower for upper UTI include fever, age, grade of reflux, leucocyte and/or neutrophil count, C- reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, Nacetyl- b-glucosamidinidase, b 2 -microglobulin and procalcitonin. In the present study our aim was to determine the variables that might allow identification of infants at risk for renal lesions after their first time UTI. We focused on infants since this age group presents a high frequency of UTIs and has not been adequately studied in the past. Our prospective study was conducted in 343 infants (boys: 193, girls: 150) younger than 12 months (median age 3 months) with first time urinary tract infection. The following variables were correlated with the DMSA scan findings: gender, age and other epidemiologic parameters, family history of UTI or urinary tract disease, body temperature, symptoms, WBC and percentage of polymorphonuclear cells, CRP level, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, bacteriologic data, urinalysis data, blood culture results, therapeutic delay time, duration and route of treatment, use of prophylactic antibiotics, number of recurrences, ultrasound findings, presence and grade of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and urine 149 b 2 -microglobulin, a 1 microglobulin, albumin values. For statistical analysis Fisher’s exact test, chi-square test, non parametric Mann Whitney test, Pearson correlation and multiple regression analysis were used. A p-value ? 0. 05 was considered significant. Nearly half of the infants with a first episode of UTI (50. 7 %) developed APN and 52 % of them developed a renal scar. Age and gender was found to be associated with acute cortical defects as older girls presented a greater frequency of APN. No correlation of age or gender was detected with the presence of permanent renal damage. The presence and the level of fever was related only to APN whereas inflammatation indexes were associated with abnormal DMSA scan during the acute phase of infection but not during follow-up. Urinary b 2 -microglobulin, a 1 microglobulin and albumin were not accurate indexes for the localization of infectious process. ...|$|E
