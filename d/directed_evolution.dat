5|$|Artificial {{selection}} is the intentional selection of traits {{in a population}} of organisms. This {{has been used for}} thousands of years in the domestication of plants and animals. More recently, such selection has become a vital part of genetic engineering, with selectable markers such as antibiotic resistance genes being used to manipulate DNA. Proteins with valuable properties have evolved by repeated rounds of mutation and selection (for example modified enzymes and new antibodies) in a process called <b>directed</b> <b>evolution.</b>|$|E
5|$|Their surface carries {{specific}} tools {{designed to}} cross the barriers of their host cells. The {{size and shape of}} viruses, and the number and nature of the functional groups on their surface, is precisely defined. As such, viruses are commonly used in materials science as scaffolds for covalently linked surface modifications. A particular quality of viruses is that they can be tailored by <b>directed</b> <b>evolution.</b> The powerful techniques developed by life sciences are becoming the basis of engineering approaches towards nanomaterials, opening a wide range of applications far beyond biology and medicine.|$|E
5|$|There {{were serious}} {{scientific}} {{objections to the}} process of natural selection as the key mechanism of evolution, including Karl von Nägeli's insistence that a trivial characteristic with no adaptive advantage could not be developed by selection. Darwin conceded that these could be linked to adaptive characteristics. His estimate that the age of the Earth allowed gradual evolution was disputed by William Thomson (later awarded the title Lord Kelvin), who calculated that it had cooled in less than 100 million years. Darwin accepted blending inheritance, but Fleeming Jenkin calculated that as it mixed traits, natural selection could not accumulate useful traits. Darwin tried to meet these objections in the 5th edition. Mivart supported <b>directed</b> <b>evolution,</b> and compiled scientific and religious objections to natural selection. In response, Darwin made considerable changes to the sixth edition. The problems of the age of the Earth and heredity were only resolved in the 20th century.|$|E

25|$|A {{restriction}} of <b>directed</b> <b>evolution</b> {{is that a}} high-throughput assay is {{required in order to}} measure the effects {{of a large number of}} different random mutations.

25|$|The {{study of}} natural {{evolution}} is traditionally based on extant organisms and their genes. However, research is fundamentally {{limited by the}} lack of fossils (and particularly the lack of ancient DNA sequences) and incomplete knowledge of ancient environmental conditions. <b>Directed</b> <b>evolution</b> investigates evolution in a controlled system of genes for individual enzymes, ribozymes and replicators (similar to experimental evolution of eukaryotes, prokaryotes and viruses).|$|E

25|$|Combined, 'semi-rational' {{approaches}} are being investigated {{to address the}} limitations of both rational design and <b>directed</b> <b>evolution.</b> Beneficial mutations are rare, so large numbers of random mutants have to be screened to find improved variants. 'Focussed libraries' concentrate on randomising regions thought to be richer in beneficial mutations for the mutagenesis step of DE. A focussed library contains fewer variants than a traditional random mutagenesis library and so does not require such high-throughput screening.|$|E
25|$|The {{first step}} in {{performing}} a cycle of <b>directed</b> <b>evolution</b> is the generation of a library of variant genes. The sequence space for random sequence is vast (10130 possible sequences for a 100 amino acid protein) and extremely sparsely populated by functional proteins. Neither experimental, nor natural evolution can ever get close to sampling so many sequences. Of course, natural evolution samples variant sequences close to functional protein sequences and this is imitated in DE by mutagenising an already functional gene.|$|E
25|$|<b>Directed</b> <b>{{evolution}}</b> is a mimic of {{the natural}} evolution cycle in a laboratory setting. Evolution requires three things to happen: variation between replicators, that the variation causes fitness differences upon which selection acts, and that this variation is heritable. In DE, a single gene is evolved by iterative rounds of mutagenesis, selection or screening, and amplification. Rounds of these steps are typically repeated, using the best variant from one round as the template for the next to achieve stepwise improvements.|$|E

25|$|However, TEV {{protease}} {{does have}} limitations as a biochemical tool. It {{is prone to}} deactivation by self-cleavage (autolysis), though this can be abolished through a single S219V mutation in the internal cleavage site. The protease expressed alone is also poorly soluble, however several {{attempts have been made}} to improve its solubility through <b>directed</b> <b>evolution</b> and computational design. It has also been shown that expression can be improved by fusion to maltose binding protein (MBP) which acts a solubility enhancing partner.|$|E
25|$|The {{structural}} homology {{described above}} {{indicates that the}} PA clan members are descended from a common ancestor of the same fold. Although PA clan proteases share a common ancestor some families use serine as the nucleophile in their catalytic triad whilst others use cysteine. The catalytic triad {{is a set of}} three residues that together perform nucleophilic catalysis and are therefore a vital component of the enzyme active site. This is therefore an extreme example of divergent enzyme evolution since during evolutionary history, the core catalytic residue of the enzyme has switched. In addition to their structural similarity, <b>directed</b> <b>evolution</b> {{has been shown to be}} able to convert a cysteine protease into an active serine protease. All cellular PA clan proteases are serine proteases, however there are both serine and cysteine protease families of viral proteases.|$|E

50|$|Castle's {{was perhaps}} the first attempt made in the {{scientific}} literature to <b>direct</b> <b>evolution</b> by artificial selection of a trait with continuous underlying variation, however the practice had previously been widely employed {{in the development of}} agriculture to obtain livestock or plants with favorable features from populations that show quantitative variation in traits like body size or grain yield.|$|R
500|$|The term orthogenesis was {{introduced}} by Wilhelm Haacke in 1893 and popularized by Theodor Eimer five years later. Proponents of orthogenesis had rejected the theory of natural selection as the organizing mechanism in evolution for a rectilinear model of <b>directed</b> <b>evolution.</b> With {{the emergence of the}} modern synthesis, in which genetics was integrated with evolution, orthogenesis and other alternatives to Darwinism were largely abandoned by biologists, but the notion that evolution represents progress is still widely shared. The evolutionary biologist Ernst Mayr made the term effectively taboo in the journal Nature in 1948, by stating that it implied [...] "some supernatural force". The American paleontologist George Gaylord Simpson (1953) attacked orthogenesis, linking it with vitalism by describing it as [...] "the mysterious inner force". Modern supporters include E. O. Wilson and Simon Conway Morris, while museum displays and textbook illustrations continue to give the impression of progress in evolution.|$|E
500|$|Shortly afterwards, Wallace {{became a}} spiritualist. At {{about the same}} time, he began to {{maintain}} that natural selection cannot account for mathematical, artistic, or musical genius, as well as metaphysical musings, and wit and humour. He eventually said that something in [...] "the unseen universe of Spirit" [...] had interceded {{at least three times}} in history. The first was the creation of life from inorganic matter. The second was the introduction of consciousness in the higher animals. And the third was the generation of the higher mental faculties in humankind. He also believed that the [...] of the universe was the development of the human spirit. These views greatly disturbed Darwin, who argued that spiritual appeals were not necessary and that sexual selection could easily explain apparently non-adaptive mental phenomena. While some historians have concluded that Wallace's belief that natural selection was insufficient to explain the development of consciousness and the human mind was directly caused by his adoption of spiritualism, other Wallace scholars have disagreed, and some maintain that Wallace never believed natural selection applied to those areas. Reaction to Wallace's ideas on this topic among leading naturalists at the time varied. Charles Lyell endorsed Wallace's views on human evolution rather than Darwin's. Wallace's belief that human consciousness could not be entirely a product of purely material causes was shared by a number of prominent intellectuals in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. However, many, including Huxley, Hooker, and Darwin himself, were critical of Wallace. As the historian of science Michael Shermer has stated, Wallace's views in this area were at odds with two major tenets of the emerging Darwinian philosophy, which were that evolution was not teleological (purpose driven) and that it was not anthropocentric (human-centred). Much later in his life Wallace returned to these themes, that evolution suggested that the universe might have a purpose and that certain aspects of living organisms might not be explainable in terms of purely materialistic processes, in a 1909 magazine article entitled The World of Life, which he later expanded into a book of the same name; a work that Shermer said anticipated some ideas about design in nature and <b>directed</b> <b>evolution</b> that would arise from various religious traditions throughout the 20th century.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Directed</b> <b>evolution</b> (DE, [...] "gelenkte Evolution") is {{a method}} used in protein {{engineering}} that mimics the process of natural selection to evolve proteins or nucleic acids toward a user-defined goal. It consists of subjecting a gene to iterative rounds of mutagenesis (creating a library of variants), selection (expressing the variants and isolating members with the desired function), and amplification (generating a template for the next round). It can be performed in vivo (in living cells), or in vitro (free in solution or microdroplet). <b>Directed</b> <b>evolution</b> is used both for protein engineering {{as an alternative to}} rationally designing modified proteins, as well as studies of fundamental evolutionary principles in a controlled, laboratory environment.|$|E
40|$|Evolvable Hardware (EHW) {{has been}} {{proposed}} as a new technique to design complex systems. Often, complex systems {{turn out to be}} very difficult to evolve. The problem is that a general strategy is too difficult for the evolution process to discover directly. This paper proposes a new approach that performs incremental evolution in two directions: from complex system to sub-systems and from subsystems back to complex system. In this approach, incremental evolution gradually decomposes a complex problem into some sub-tasks. In a second step, we gradually make the tasks more challenging and general. Our approach automatically discovers the sub-tasks, their sequence as well as circuit layout dimensions. Our method is tested in a digital circuit domain and compared to <b>direct</b> <b>evolution.</b> We show that our bidirectional incremental approach can handle more complex, harder tasks and evolve them more effectively, then <b>direct</b> <b>evolution.</b> 1.
