5|$|On July 3, {{international}} leaders begin ordering individual counterattacks. Their aviation forces {{attack the}} saucers positioned above {{the ruins of}} the cities, but the saucers are protected by force fields. Each saucer launches a swarm of attack fighters, each with its own shield as well, which wipe out the human fighter squadrons. Captain Steven Hiller, a pilot with the USMC squadron VMFA-314 based out of Marine Corps Air Station El Toro, survives by luring his attacker to the enclosed spaces of the Grand Canyon and sacrificing his plane, forcing the alien to crash-land. He subdues the injured alien pilot and flags down a convoy of refugees, hitching a ride with former combat pilot Russell Casse. They transport the unconscious alien to Area 51, where Thomas' group <b>has</b> <b>landed.</b> Through Secretary of Defense Albert Nimzicki, they learn that a faction of the government has been involved in a UFO conspiracy since 1947, when one of the invaders' attack fighters crashed in Roswell.

5|$|Warren Davis, a {{programmer}} hired {{to work on}} the action game Protector, noticed Lee's ideas, and asked if he could use them to practice programming randomness and gravity as game mechanic. Thus, he added balls that bounced from the pyramid's top to bottom. Because Davis was still learning how to program game mechanics, he wanted to keep the design simple. He also felt games with complex control schemes were frustrating and wanted something that could be played with one hand. To accomplish this, Davis removed the shooting and changed the objective to saving the protagonist from danger. As Davis worked on the game one night, Gottlieb's vice president of engineering, Ron Waxman, noticed him and suggested to change the color of the cubes after the game's character <b>has</b> <b>landed</b> on them. Davis implemented a unique control scheme; a four-way joystick was rotated 45° to match the directions of Q*bert's jumping. Staff members at Gottlieb urged for a more conventional orientation, but Davis stuck to his decision. Davis remembered to have started programming in April 1982, but the project was only put on schedule as an actual product several months later.|$|E

Together with Midshipman Frame, he uses {{the heat from the}} entry into the Earth's atmosphere to restart the ship's auxiliary engines. The ship stabilises and narrowly avoids a collision with Buckingham Palace. The Doctor then realizes that Astrid was wearing a teleport bracelet when she fell into the engine. In an emergency, the teleport bracelets were programmed to hold a person's molecular pattern in stasis until it can be recovered. The Doctor frantically attempts to retrieve Astrid's pattern, but the machine is too badly damaged. The Doctor reluctantly allows the ghostly remains of Astrid's atoms to dissipate into space. As the surviving passengers wait for rescue, the Doctor and Mr. Copper, who would otherwise be sent to prison for committing fraud {{in order to get a}} job with the company, teleport to Earth and find that the TARDIS <b>has</b> <b>landed</b> unharmed in an snowy field, thrown from the ship after the collision. Mr. Copper is left to live on Earth with a credit card preloaded with £1,000,000, thanks to the Doctor.|$|E

25|$|For {{the process}} of {{pollination}} to be successful, a pollen grain produced by the anther, the male part of a flower, must be transferred to a stigma, the female part of the flower, of a plant of the same species. The process is rather different in angiosperms (flowering plants) from what it is in gymnosperms (other seed plants). In angiosperms, after the pollen grain <b>has</b> <b>landed</b> on the stigma, it creates a pollen tube which grows down the style until it reaches the ovary. Sperm cells from the pollen grain then move along the pollen tube, enter the egg cell through the micropyle and fertilise it, resulting {{in the production of}} a seed.|$|E
