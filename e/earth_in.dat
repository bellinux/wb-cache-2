5|$|Lutetium {{occurs on}} the <b>Earth</b> <b>in</b> form of two isotopes: lutetium-175 and lutetium-176. Out of these two, only {{the former is}} stable, making the element monoisotopic.

5|$|Many comets and asteroids {{collided}} with <b>Earth</b> <b>in</b> its early stages. Many scientists think that comets bombarding the young Earth about 4 {{billion years ago}} brought the vast quantities of water that now fill the Earth's oceans, {{or at least a}} significant portion of it. Others have cast doubt on this idea. The detection of organic molecules, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, in significant quantities in comets has led to speculation that comets or meteorites may have brought the precursors of life—or even life itself—to <b>Earth.</b> <b>In</b> 2013 it was suggested that impacts between rocky and icy surfaces, such as comets, had the potential to create the amino acids that make up proteins through shock synthesis. In 2015, scientists found significant amounts of molecular oxygen in the outgassings of comet 67P, suggesting that the molecule may occur more often than had been thought, and thus less an indicator of life as has been supposed.|$|E
