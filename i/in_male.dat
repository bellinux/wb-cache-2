40|$|Objective: Toanalyze the {{clinical}} efficacy of quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine (QHPV) in preventing human papillomavirus (HPV) related diseases <b>in</b> <b>males</b> and {{to evaluate the}} potential epidemiological impact of the vaccine <b>in</b> <b>males.</b> Methods: All published studies were searched using specified keywords via EMBASE, PubMed, Cochrane Library and ClinicalTrials. gov to review systematically the efficacy of QHPV <b>in</b> <b>males.</b> Studies that modeled the impact of QHPV <b>in</b> <b>males</b> were also searched using specified keywords from PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Library to evaluate the vaccine impact on males. Results: A total of 5 studies were selected for the systematic review of QHPV efficacy <b>in</b> <b>males.</b> Observed efficacy of QHPV in preventing genital warts(GW) due to HPV types 6 and 11 <b>in</b> <b>males</b> {{is found to be}} statistically significant. Efficacies of QHPV in preventing anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN), HPV-related cancers <b>in</b> <b>males</b> are yet to be confirmed. A total of 9 studies were selected for the review of modeled impact of QHPV vaccination <b>in</b> <b>males.</b> QHPV vaccination <b>in</b> girls is predicted to reduce the incidence of HPV infections and GW <b>in</b> <b>males.</b> Inclusion of <b>males</b> <b>in</b> the vaccination program could only produce limited additional benefit if vaccination coverage of girls is high. Discussion: Analysis and implications of clinical efficacy of QHPV <b>in</b> <b>males</b> are discussed. The approved indications of QHPV vaccine in various countries were not fully substantiated by clinical evidence. Factors affecting the epidemiological impact of QHPV <b>in</b> <b>males</b> were also discussed. Questionable efficacy of QHPV <b>in</b> <b>males</b> casts doubt on the vaccine’s impact. Conclusion: Clinical efficacy of QHPV <b>in</b> <b>males</b> is basically unclear, except against GW. Impact of the vaccine <b>in</b> <b>males</b> is greatly limited by its efficacy. More research should be conducted in order to obtain a clearer picture on the efficacy and impact of QHPV <b>in</b> <b>males.</b> published_or_final_versionPublic HealthMasterMaster of Public Healt...|$|R

5|$|Studies {{have sought}} to find the precise {{function}} of Mups in pheromone communication. Mup proteins {{have been shown to}} promote puberty and accelerate the estrus cycle in female mice, inducing the Vandenbergh and Whitten effects. However, in both cases the Mups had to be presented to the female dissolved <b>in</b> <b>male</b> urine, indicating that the protein requires some urinary context to function. In 2007 Mups normally found <b>in</b> <b>male</b> mouse urine were made in transgenic bacteria, and therefore created devoid of the chemicals they normally bind. These Mups were shown to be sufficient to promote aggressive behaviour in males, {{even in the absence of}} urine. In addition, Mups made in bacteria were found to activate olfactory sensory neurons in the vomeronasal organ (VNO), a subsystem of the nose known to detect pheromones via specific sensory receptors, of mice and rats. Together, this demonstrated that Mup proteins can act as pheromones themselves, independent of their ligands.|$|E

However, Mastotermitidae termites have multiflagellate sperm with limited motility. The genitals in females are also simplified. Unlike in other termites, Mastotermitidae females have an ovipositor, a feature strikingly similar to that in female cockroaches.|$|E

5|$|Urinary {{proteins}} {{were first}} reported in rodents in 1932, during studies by Thomas Addis into {{the cause of}} proteinuria. They are potent human allergens, and are largely responsible {{for a number of}} animal allergies, including to cats, horses and rodents. Their endogenous function within an animal is unknown, but may involve regulating energy expenditure. However, as secreted proteins they play multiple roles in chemical communication between animals, functioning as pheromone transporters and stabilizers in rodents and pigs. Mups can also act as protein pheromones themselves. They have been demonstrated to promote aggression <b>in</b> <b>male</b> mice, and one specific Mup protein found <b>in</b> <b>male</b> mouse urine is sexually attractive to female mice. Mups can also function as signals between different species: mice display an instinctive fear response on the detection of Mups derived from predators such as cats and rats.|$|E

5|$|Lesbianism, or the {{suggestion}} of it, began early in filmmaking. The same constructs of how lesbians were portrayed—or for what reasons—as what had appeared in literature were placed on women in the films. Women challenging their feminine roles was a device more easily accepted than men challenging masculine ones. Actresses appeared as men <b>in</b> <b>male</b> roles because of plot devices as early as 1914 in A Florida Enchantment featuring Edith Storey. In Morocco (1930) Marlene Dietrich kisses another woman on the lips, and Katharine Hepburn plays a man in Christopher Strong in 1933 and again in Sylvia Scarlett (1936). Hollywood films followed the same trend set by audiences who flocked to Harlem to see edgy shows that suggested bisexuality.|$|E
5|$|Male {{grasshoppers}} {{spend much}} of the day stridulating, singing more actively under optimal conditions and being more subdued when conditions are adverse; females also stridulate, but their efforts are insignificant when compared to the males. Late-stage male nymphs can sometimes be seen making stridulatory movements, although they lack the equipment to make sounds, demonstrating the importance of this behavioural trait. The songs are a means of communication; the male stridulation seems to express reproductive maturity, the desire for social cohesion and individual well-being. Social cohesion becomes necessary among grasshoppers because of their ability to jump or fly large distances, and the song can serve to limit dispersal and guide others to favourable habitat. The generalised song can vary in phraseology and intensity, and is modified {{in the presence of a}} rival male, and changes again to a courtship song when a female is nearby. <b>In</b> <b>male</b> grasshoppers of the family Pneumoridae, the enlarged abdomen amplifies stridulation.|$|E
