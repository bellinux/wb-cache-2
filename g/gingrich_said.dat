25|$|In 2012 {{there were}} 13 state {{contests}} before Super Tuesday, seven caucuses and 5 primaries. Missouri had a nonbinding straw poll {{in the form}} of a primary. Santorum spent months in Iowa, traveling to all 99 counties and holding some 381 town hall meetings. This one state campaign succeeded when he tied with Romney in the Iowa Caucuses on January 3. This first in the nation caucus propelled him into a national campaign while it ended Michele Bachmann's campaign. On the night of the caucuses, Romney was reported the winner of Iowa by only eight votes over Santorum, but after the results were certified, Santorum was declared the winner, beating Romney by 34 votes, despite the results from 8 districts being lost. Newt <b>Gingrich</b> <b>said</b> after Iowa that his positive campaign had been a weakness, and had allowed his rivals to gain the upper hand through negative attacks paid by super PACs supporting them.|$|E
500|$|According to L. H. Carter, Gingrich's {{campaign}} treasurer, <b>Gingrich</b> <b>said</b> of {{his first}} wife: [...] "She's not young enough or pretty enough to be {{the wife of the}} President. And besides, she has cancer." [...] Gingrich has denied saying it. His supporters dismiss Carter as a disgruntled former aide who was miffed at not being asked to accompany Gingrich to Washington.|$|E
500|$|Asked {{about the}} {{allegations}} {{at the beginning}} of the televised South Carolina primary debate, <b>Gingrich</b> <b>said</b> the story was false and told moderator John King that making an ex-wife a significant question in a presidential campaign was [...] "close to despicable." [...] Gingrich received a standing ovation for parlaying a personal scandal into an attack on what he perceived as biased media.|$|E
25|$|<b>Gingrich</b> has <b>said</b> that {{if elected}} president, he would defy Supreme Court rulings that he opposed, citing the 2008 {{decision}} in Boumediene v. Bush as an example. <b>Gingrich</b> also <b>said</b> that if president, he might ignore a Supreme Court ruling recognizing {{a constitutional right}} to same-sex marriage.|$|R
2500|$|Senator John E. Sununu (R) of New Hampshire said, after Lott's {{election}} as Senate Minority Whip, [...] "He understands the rules. He's a strong negotiator." [...] Former House Speaker Newt <b>Gingrich</b> (R) <b>said</b> he's [...] "the smartest legislative politician I've ever met." ...|$|R
5000|$|In December 2011, when Gingrich {{achieved}} frontrunner {{status in}} the race, Santorum became increasingly critical {{of him and his}} speakership. Santorum <b>said</b> <b>Gingrich's</b> Contract with America was not practical and aside from welfare reform, it fell short of its goals. Santorum <b>said</b> <b>Gingrich's</b> Contract with America was overrated and took too much credit from the Gang of Six, of which he was a part, which exposed congressional banking corruption in 1994. Santorum also gained the confidence of several evangelical religious leaders and Sarah Palin for his [...] "ideological consistency".|$|R
500|$|Gingrich {{was widely}} lampooned for {{implying}} that the government shutdown {{was a result of}} his personal grievances, including a widely shared editorial cartoon depicting him as a baby throwing a tantrum. Democratic leaders, including Chuck Schumer, took the opportunity to attack Gingrich's motives for the budget standoff. In 1998, <b>Gingrich</b> <b>said</b> that these comments were his [...] "single most avoidable mistake" [...] as Speaker.|$|E
500|$|Regarding the situation, <b>Gingrich</b> <b>said</b> in January 1997, [...] "I did {{not manage}} the effort {{intensely}} enough to thoroughly direct or review information being {{submitted to the}} committee on my behalf. In my name and over my signature, inaccurate, incomplete and unreliable statements {{were given to the}} committee, but I did not intend to mislead the committee... I brought down on the people's house a controversy which could weaken the faith people have in their government." ...|$|E
500|$|However, {{insisting that}} he had [...] "pretty strongly" [...] {{considered}} running, on September 29 spokesman Rick Tyler said that Gingrich would not seek the presidency in 2008 {{because he could not}} continue to serve as chairman of American Solutions if he did so. Citing campaign finance law restrictions (the McCain-Feingold campaign law would have forced him to leave his American Solutions political organization if he declared his candidacy), <b>Gingrich</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I wasn't prepared to abandon American Solutions, even to explore whether a campaign was realistic." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{previous}} day, Sheldon Adelson had <b>said</b> <b>Gingrich</b> {{appeared to}} be [...] "at {{the end of the}} line" [...] because [...] "mathematically, he can’t get anywhere near the numbers, and it’s unlikely to be a brokered convention." ...|$|R
5000|$|On February 13, National Reviews editors <b>said</b> <b>Gingrich</b> should {{drop out}} and endorse Santorum {{if he wanted}} to stop Romney. [...] Gingrich noted that there had been calls for him to drop out in the past but he had {{subsequently}} bounced back in the polls.|$|R
2500|$|Mitt Romney and Newt <b>Gingrich</b> both <b>said</b> {{they would}} {{consider}} military action to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon, a stance Ron Paul and Herman Cain disagreed with. Cain, Gingrich, Perry, Romney and Rick Santorum all supported sanctions against Iran, with only Paul and Huntsman opposing them. Cain and Bachmann supported {{the use of}} waterboarding whereas Paul and Huntsman opposed it, saying it was torture. Huntsman also called for American soldiers {{to be removed from}} Afghanistan, saying [...] "this nation has achieved its key objectives." ...|$|R
500|$|Describing {{his views}} as a {{possible}} candidate during an appearance on On the Record with Greta Van Susteren in March 2009, <b>Gingrich</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I am very sad {{that a number of}} Republicans do not understand that this country is sick of earmarks. [...] are sick of politicians taking care of themselves. They are sick of their money being spent {{in a way that is}} absolutely indefensible... I think you're going to see a steady increase in the number of incumbents who have opponents because the American taxpayers are increasingly fed up." ...|$|E
500|$|Between 2001 and 2010, Gingrich {{consulted}} for Freddie Mac, a government-sponsored secondary {{home mortgage}} company, which {{was concerned about}} new regulations under consideration by Congress. Regarding payments of $1.6 million for the consulting, <b>Gingrich</b> <b>said</b> that [...] "Freddie Mac paid Gingrich Group, which {{has a number of}} employees and a number of offices, a consulting fee, just like you would pay any other consulting firm." [...] In January 2012, he said that he could not make public his contract with Freddie Mac, even though the company gave permission, until his business partners in the Center for Health Transformation also agreed to that.|$|E
500|$|Discussing {{the impact}} of the {{government}} shutdown on the Republican Party, Gingrich later commented that, [...] "Everybody in Washington thinks that was a big mistake. They're exactly wrong. There had been no reelected Republican majority since 1928. Part of the reason we got reelected... is our base thought we were serious. And they thought we were serious because when it came to a show-down, we didn't flinch." [...] In a 2011 op-ed in The Washington Post, <b>Gingrich</b> <b>said</b> that the government shutdown led to the balanced-budget deal in 1997 and the first four consecutive balanced budgets since the 1920s, as well as the first re-election of a Republican majority since 1928.|$|E
2500|$|As an {{alternative}} to federal bailouts, Gingrich advocates revising federal law to allow states to voluntarily declare bankruptcy. In a Los Angeles Times opinion article co-written with former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, Gingrich argued such a provision would allow states to reorganize their finances and free them from contractual obligations, specifically with government employee unions. In the op-ed, Gingrich wrote that many government employee pension systems are [...] "bloated, broken and underfunded" [...] and are [...] "perhaps the most significant hurdles for many states trying to restore fiscal health." [...] However, <b>Gingrich</b> also <b>said</b> the new laws must respect {{the sovereignty of the}} citizens of a state, as well as limit judicial power over the bankruptcy process.|$|R
5000|$|Perceived to be {{criticism}} of the Republican Party's plan to reform Medicare for the 2012 United States federal budget, the comments were met with backlash from the GOP and various political pundits. Sarah Palin, former Governor of Alaska and the 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee, defended the former Speaker of the House on the Fox News Channel show Hannity, stating Gingrich {{was a victim of}} gotcha journalism and that his apology was forced by the [...] "lamestream media". <b>Gingrich</b> later <b>said</b> on CBS News's Face the Nation that he was not referring to Ryan but to a general principle [...] "that neither party should impose on the American people something that they are deeply opposed to." ...|$|R
5000|$|Some {{prominent}} conservatives praised Trump. Newt Gingrich {{described him}} as the latest incarnation of the Reagan Revolution, and had said that his election would be [...] "very healthy for America". In the aftermath of Trump's statements regarding the Khan's, <b>Gingrich</b> later <b>said</b> that Trump was making himself a less acceptable candidate for the presidency than Hillary Clinton, but that [...] "Trump is vastly better than Hillary as President". Rush Limbaugh, while clearly favoring Ted Cruz, relished {{the degree to which}} Trump exposed the conservative establishment as an elitist self-interested clique. Sean Hannity was an unapologetic advocate for Trump and endorsed him. David Horowitz praised Trump for courage and for rejecting political correctness, and he attacked [...] "Never Trump" [...] Republicans as reckless and blind.|$|R
500|$|In 1998, Republicans {{lost five}} {{seats in the}} House—the worst midterm {{performance}} in 64 years by a party not holding the presidency. Gingrich, who won his reelection, was held largely responsible for Republican losses in the House. His private polls had given his fellow Republican Congress the impression that pushing the Lewinsky scandal would damage Clinton's popularity and result in the party winning a net total of six to thirty seats in the US House of Representatives in this election. The day after the election, a Republican caucus ready to rebel against him prompted his resignation of the speakership. He also announced his intended and eventual full departure from the House in January 1999. When relinquishing the speakership, <b>Gingrich</b> <b>said</b> he was [...] "not willing to preside over people who are cannibals," [...] and claimed that leaving the House would keep him from overshadowing his successor.|$|E
500|$|In 2003, {{he founded}} the Center for Health Transformation. Gingrich {{supported}} the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, creating the Medicare Part D federal prescription drugs benefit program. Some conservatives have criticized him for favoring the plan, due to its cost. However, Gingrich has remained a supporter, stating in a 2011 interview {{that it was a}} necessary modernization of Medicare, which was created before pharmaceutical drugs became standard in medical care. He has said that the increase in cost from medication must be seen as preventive, leading to reduced need for medical procedures. In a May 15, 2011, interview on Meet the Press, Gingrich repeated his long-held belief that [...] "all of us have a responsibility to pay—help pay for health care", and suggested this could be implemented by either a mandate to obtain health insurance or a requirement to post a bond ensuring coverage. In the same interview <b>Gingrich</b> <b>said</b> [...] "I don't think right-wing social engineering is any more desirable than left-wing social engineering. I don't think imposing radical change from the right or the left is a very good way for a free society to operate." [...] This comment caused backlash within the Republican Party.|$|E
2500|$|In an April 2009 {{television}} appearance, {{when asked}} whether waterboarding was torture, <b>Gingrich</b> <b>said</b> that the question was [...] "debatable" [...] and that [...] "I honestly don't know" [...] the answer. Gingrich stated that however the practice was characterized, waterboarding was [...] "something we shouldn't do" [...] but then stated that there are [...] "very rare circumstances where extreme measures" [...] should be used. In a May 2009 interview, <b>Gingrich</b> <b>said</b> that [...] "waterboarding is not torture" [...] and defended the use of [...] "specific enhanced interrogation techniques in specific circumstances against very high-level terrorists." ...|$|E
2500|$|In early 2011, Gingrich {{called for}} the {{promotion}} of democracy around the world, saying that the US should be encouraging countries to renounce dictatorial forms of government. Gingrich has stated he believes that the U.S. should push the message that [...] "America stands for freedom". Gingrich specifically mentioned Egypt, Russia, China, and Cuba as places the United States should be applying pressure. As part of the promotion of democracy, <b>Gingrich</b> has <b>said</b> that he wants to re-think the current model of foreign aid. He says the focus of reform should be on shifting funding and responsibility away from governments and into NGOs. Gingrich has previously argued that government-to-government foreign aid programs are detrimental to the promotion of democracy since they [...] "prop up" [...] repressive governments and allow them to retain control.|$|R
50|$|On {{the evening}} of March 27, 2012, the Gingrich {{campaign}} announced it was cutting {{a third of the}} staff and replacing campaign manager Michael Krull with his deputy, Vince Haley. Patrick Millsaps remained as the Chief of Staff. The campaign also <b>said</b> <b>Gingrich</b> would have more exposure on the Internet, and that his travel costs would be reduced. Strategic goals would be to present Gingrich as the most capable prospective adversary to President Obama, and to go after delegates in anticipation of a brokered convention.|$|R
5000|$|An {{anonymous}} {{former member}} of <b>Gingrich's</b> campaign staff <b>said</b> about 80% of the followers were inactive or invalid accounts, and that the campaign paid an Internet service to add followers. Gingrich's spokesman rejected the allegations as false and said his inclusion in the Suggested User List was [...] "responsible for a large, but indeterminable amount of followers". ABC News identified two other [...] "suggested" [...] users, Gavin Newsom with 1.3 million, and John McCain with 1.7 million followers, suggesting {{it was not an}} anomaly.|$|R
2500|$|In {{his book}} To Save America: Stopping Obama's Secular-Socialist Machine, <b>Gingrich</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "The secular socialist machine {{represents}} {{as great a}} threat to America as Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union once did." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gingrich {{has been}} very {{critical}} of Obama's handling {{of the crisis in}} Egypt, and has warned of the possibility that Egypt might [...] "go the way of Iran". <b>Gingrich</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I think this is a period of tremendous challenge and is a sign of the general failure of our strategy of not dealing with radical Islamists and not being honest and aggressive of what's going on around the world." [...] Gingrich also said that the Obama administration had failed to take the Middle East seriously and that Obama's 2009 speech in Cairo designed to improve relations with the Muslim world was a mistake. <b>Gingrich</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "The president went to Cairo and gave his famous speech in which he explained that we should all be friends together because we're all the same people doing the same things and there are no differences between us. Well, I {{think there are a lot}} of differences between the Muslim Brotherhood and the rest of us." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, Gingrich {{accepted}} {{an invitation from}} Al Gore to appear with Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in a commercial produced by one of Gore's climate advocacy organizations. In the ad, Gingrich stated that he and Pelosi [...] "agree our country must take action to address climate change". In 2011, <b>Gingrich</b> <b>said</b> his appearance in the ad was [...] "the dumbest single thing I've done".|$|E
5000|$|Romney's attacks {{intensified}} on <b>Gingrich,</b> as he <b>said</b> {{he was too}} [...] "zany" [...] and [...] "unreliable" [...] in {{his personal}} temperament to be President. Gingrich pointed out that Romney had made money from [...] "bankrupting companies and laying off employees", a reference to Romney's business practices as head of Bain Capital. A New York Times story featured Gingrich's record on health care, finding that he supported bailout monies that funded electronic health records, and often sided with Democrats such as Tom Daschle and Hillary Clinton on Medicare's expansion for prescription drug benefits.|$|R
5000|$|Walsh won the Republican {{nomination}} for Illinois' 9th congressional district and faced longtime Democratic liberal incumbent Sidney R. Yates, who was 87 years old, {{in the general}} election. Walsh campaigned by riding his bicycle through the district. He engaged in self-admitted [...] "outrageous" [...] stunts during the campaign which included paying the doorman at Yates' Chicago apartment building $1,000 for being {{the first person to}} spot Yates in his district, and throwing a birthday party for Yates that included a cake decorated with 87 candles. Walsh denied he was trying to play the [...] "age card". Yates responded that his own age was not a factor, and that Walsh was too young and inexperienced for the job. Yates also commented that the district was too liberal for Walsh, and tried to tie Walsh to the conservative Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich. In response, Walsh distanced himself from <b>Gingrich</b> and <b>said</b> he considered himself a [...] "moderate Republican"; he also ran as a pro-choice candidate in the liberal-leaning district. Yates defeated Walsh 63%-37%.|$|R
2500|$|Ron Paul and Jon Huntsman {{were given}} more {{opportunities}} to speak than in previous debates, with Paul clashing with Herman Cain and Rick Santorum over Iran and with Newt Gingrich over the PATRIOT Act. Mitt Romney and Rick Perry united over their opposition to $1 trillion of defence cuts but <b>Gingrich</b> and Huntsman <b>said</b> nothing should {{be taken off the}} table. Herman Cain was widely regarded to be a [...] "loser", with [...] "nothing of interest or insight to add on national security, and it showed". The debate itself was again criticised for there being no questions on the Eurozone and for China only being mentioned in passing.|$|R
2500|$|In May 2011, {{following}} {{an appearance on}} Meet the Press, Gingrich was criticized by some conservatives for using the phrase [...] "right-wing social engineering" [...] in apparent reference to Rep. Paul Ryan's voucher system plan for Medicare. In later statements, <b>Gingrich</b> <b>said</b> he was speaking to a general principle that major reforms require {{the support of the}} American people, and offered support for Ryan's efforts to promote reform.|$|E
2500|$|In 2010, Adelson donated $1 {{million to}} American Solutions for Winning the Future, a {{political}} action committee (PAC) supporting Republican former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich. In December 2011, during Gingrich's bid for the U.S. presidency, Adelson spoke favorably of controversial remarks Gingrich had made about Palestinians, saying [...] "read the history of those who call themselves Palestinians, and you will hear why <b>Gingrich</b> <b>said</b> recently that the Palestinians are an invented people." ...|$|E
2500|$|On May 2, 2012, Newt Gingrich [...] "mothballed" [...] his {{campaign}} {{saying that a}} second term of president Obama would be disastrous. Gingrich mentioned Republican front-runner Mitt Romney during his press speech, but did not endorse him. [...] He intended to officially endorse Mr. Romney at a [...] "to-be-scheduled event" [...] featuring both Republican leaders. [...] "Today I am suspending the campaign, but suspending the campaign does not mean suspending citizenship," [...] <b>Gingrich</b> <b>said,</b> with his wife Callista at his side.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the summer}} of 2005, he {{authored}} Surrounded by Idiots: Fighting Liberal Lunacy in America (2005, William Morrow; [...] ), which became a New York Times bestseller (#27 on the extended bestseller list). The Times reviewed the book writing, [...] "You might disagree with the man's politics, but dang, you gotta love a guy who slaughters a steer live on the radio just to annoy the ideologues at People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, then gives the meat to the poor. Checkmate. Fans of Gallagher will love the book, and even those liberal loons might enjoy reading it just to play Spot the Inconsistencies." [...] On his radio show, he announced he was writing a book called 50 Things Liberals Love to Hate which was released August 28, 2012. The book was reviewed by former Speaker Newt <b>Gingrich,</b> who <b>said</b> of the book that it, [...] "is smart, funny, and uses satire and wit to take apart the left. If Jon Stewart had writers who were conservative, they’d write a book like this." [...] On September 10, 2012 Gallagher gave a reading of his new book at the Richard Nixon Presidential Library.|$|R
25|$|The U.S. Space Shuttle {{program was}} officially retired {{shortly before the}} 2012 presidential primary {{campaign}} began in earnest. During the primary campaign, rival Republican candidate Newt Gingrich promised that if elected he would work to reinvigorate the nation's space program with a goal of establishing a permanent colony on the moon within a decade and seeking to have humans travel to Mars in the near future. Commenting on <b>Gingrich's</b> proposals, Romney <b>said</b> that before committing to any particular space program, he would take advice from experts in the field. He expressed doubt that a moonbase would be a practical goal if the costs were {{on the order of}} $550 billion. He received the endorsement of Michael D. Griffin and Eric C. Anderson, among others.|$|R
2500|$|Gingrich also {{decried the}} {{proposed}} Islamic center {{as a symbol}} of Muslim [...] "triumphalism", and said that building the center near the site of the 9/11 attacks [...] "would be like putting a Nazi sign next to the Holocaust Museum". Commenting on what <b>Gingrich</b> <b>said,</b> The Economist claimed that [...] "Like Mr bin Laden, Mr Gingrich is apparently still relitigating the victories and defeats of religious wars fought in Europe and the Middle East centuries ago. He should rejoin the modern world, before he does real harm." ...|$|E
