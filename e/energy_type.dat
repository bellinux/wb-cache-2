40|$|Despite {{the intense}} efforts {{that have been}} devoted to the {{development}} of scoring functions for protein-ligand docking, they are still limited in their ability to identify the correct binding pose of a ligand within a protein binding site. A deeper understanding of the intricacies of scoring functions is therefore essential in order to develop these effectively. The aim of the work described in this thesis is to analyse the individual interaction <b>energy</b> <b>types</b> which form the individual components of a force field-based scoring function. To do this, & protein-ligand docking algorithm that is based on multiobjective optimisation has been developed. Multiobjective optimisation allows for the optimisation of several objectives simultaneously and this has been applied to the individual interaction <b>energy</b> <b>types</b> of the GRID scoring function. Traditionally these interaction <b>energy</b> <b>types</b> are summed together and the total energy is used to guide the search. By using individual <b>energy</b> <b>types</b> during optimisation, their roles can be better understood. The interaction <b>energy</b> <b>types</b> that have been used here are the electrostatic and hydrogen bond interactions combined, and van der Waals interactions. The algorithm is first tested on two datasets containing twenty complexes. The results show that the different interaction <b>energy</b> <b>types</b> have varying influences when it comes to successfully docking certain complexes, and {{that it is important to}} fmd the right balance of interaction <b>energy</b> <b>types</b> so as to find correct solutions. Ofthe twenty complexes, the algorithm found correct solutions for fifteen. To improve the performance of the algorithm, a few enhancements were introduced. This includes a simplex minimisation process with a Lamarckian element. The algorithm was retested on the twenty complexes, and the newer version was found to outperform the original version, finding correct solutions for seventeen of the twenty complexes. To extensively study the capabilities of the algorithm, it was tested on varied datasets, including the FlexX dataset. The algoritlun's performance was also compared to a single-objective docking tool, Q-fit. The comparison betw en the multiobjective and single-objective methodologies revealed that single-objective methods can sometimes fail at finding correct docked solutions because they are unable to correctly balance the interaction <b>energy</b> <b>types</b> comprising a scoring function. The study also showed that a multiobjective optimisation method can reveal the reasons why a given docking algorithm may fail at fmding a correct solution. Finally, the algorithm was extended to incorporate desolvation energy as a third objective. Though these results are preliminary, they revealed some interesting relationships between the different objectives. ...|$|R

Iran is {{the land}} of miraculous <b>energy</b> <b>types</b> {{including}} wide range of renewable <b>types</b> of <b>energy.</b> In spite of these potentials however, little use has so far been made of these <b>energy</b> <b>types</b> mainly due to unfamiliarity and lack of scientific and technological dominance, and also the absence of necessary funds for conducting respective projects and plans. The most important reason behind this negligence is the lack of an independent and comprehensive law for clean energies, which serves as a firm support for development and usage of new <b>energy</b> <b>types</b> while possessing adequate implementation guarantee. Once formulated, the law becomes indispensable and is expected to remove and eliminate all the existing defects in the society and help improve the international policies and programs aimed at the global sustainable development using clean energies.

50|$|All {{technology}} uses {{energy to}} transform the material into a desirable object or uses some form of mechanics combined with another form to make something better. The cheaper energy is, the wider the class of technologies that are considered economic. This is why technological history {{can be seen as}} a succession of ages defined by <b>energy</b> <b>type</b> i.e. human, animal, water, peat, coal, and oil. The Romans used water power, and watermills were common throughout the Empire, especially to the end of the 1st century AD. They were used for cereals milling, sawing timber and crushing ore. They exploited wood and coal for heating. There were huge reserves of wood, peat and coal in the Roman Empire, but they were all in the wrong place. Wood could be floated down rivers to the major urban centres but otherwise it was a very poor fuel, being heavy for its caloric value. If this was improved by being processed into charcoal, it was bulky. Nor was wood ever available in any concentration. Diocletian's Price Edict can give us a glimpse of the economics of transporting wood. The maximum price of a wagon load of 1,200 lbs of wood was 150 d.(denari). The maximum freight charge per mile for the same wagon load was 20 d. per mile. Room heating was normally better done by charcoal braziers than hypocausts. But hypocausts did allow them to exploit any poor-quality smoky fuels like straw, vine prunings and small wood locally available. Hypocausts also allowed them to generate a humid heat for their baths.|$|E
