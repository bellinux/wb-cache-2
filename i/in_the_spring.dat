50|$|In spring-bead based network model, <b>the</b> <b>springs</b> {{and beads}} {{are used as}} {{components}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> crosslinked network. <b>Springs</b> are cross-linked to represent mechanical behavior of the material and bridge molecular dynamics (MD) model and finite element (FE) model. The beads represent material mass of cluster bonds. Each spring is used to represent a cluster of polymer chains, instead of part of a single polymer chain. This simplification allows to bridge different models at multiple length scales and improves the simulation efficiency significantly. At each iteration step <b>in</b> <b>the</b> simulation, forces <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>springs</b> are applied to the nodes {{at the center of}} the beads, and the equilibrated nodal displacements throughout the system are calculated. Different from the traditional FE method for obtaining stress and strain, the spring-bead model provides the displacements of the nodes and forces <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>springs.</b> <b>The</b> equivalent strain and strain energy of spring-bead based network model can be defined and calculated using the displacements of nodes and <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> characteristics.
