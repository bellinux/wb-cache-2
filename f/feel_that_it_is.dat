5|$|Becky tells Steve {{that she}} is {{pregnant}} and he later discovers that Becky has already told Claire and Steve tells his mother, Liz. Unfortunately Becky miscarries twice, although she was unaware of her 2nd pregnancy, and medical tests reveal an abnormality of the womb, meaning she is unable to carry a child full-term, making Becky decide {{that she wants to}} adopt. During the process, Steve needs a reference from Amy's mother, Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford), who promptly uses it to cause trouble, making Becky threaten, in return, that Tracy will never see Amy again. Unfortunately Becky and Steve are refused the right to adopt because her estranged half-sister Kylie gave a bad reference and the fact that Social Services <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> too soon after her miscarriages. She confronts Kylie, but the sisters eventually reconcile and Becky helps Kylie reclaim custody of her son, Max. Becky becomes very attached to Max, whilst Kylie becomes more irresponsible. Kylie announces plans to move to Cyprus with her new boyfriend and Becky begs her to reconsider, so Kylie offers to sell Max to her and Steve for £20,000, which they agree to. On the night of the tram crash, Kylie returns and demands more money, so Becky steals £5,000 from the ruins of Dev Alahan's (Jimmi Harkishin) corner shop, to pay Kylie off. Tracy is released from prison and the two start feuding again, particularly after Tracy discovers Max's sale and agrees to keep quiet in exchange for Amy. When Tracy is brutally attacked, Becky is arrested for the incident until Claire admits she was responsible but Becky admits looting Dev's shop, Sunita Alahan (Shobna Gulati) is furious but does not report her. When Liz finds out she makes life hard for Becky. Becky gets drunk and attacks Kylie and forces Liz out of the pub. Jim McDonald (Charles Lawson) offers to buy the Rovers— with the money Becky and Steve decide {{to start a new life}} abroad and steal Amy. Jim's attempts to rob a bank fail and they are forced to cancel their plans. Steve calls Social Services to check on Max and they take him into care. Becky believes Tracy made the call and smashes her front room up with a sledge-hammer. Before she can hit Tracy, Steve confesses. Becky walks out on Steve and goes off the rails once more.|$|E

Access to the village by car can only be gained by using roads which are at some point single track, which gives visitors the <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> more remote than it is, and which makes it quieter than the villages closer to the A25. The position, {{in one of the}} most uniformly forested parts of the Greensand Ridge, provides a variety of trees on varying terrain.|$|E
25|$|Often, bear {{viewing and}} bear hunting are {{considered}} incompatible. Even if the bear population is healthy and bear hunting is sustainable, ethical questions arise especially if hunting occurs near viewing areas and either during or {{soon after the}} viewing season. Many <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not fair to encourage bears {{to be close to}} people during the summer, only to allow them to be shot in the fall. The Kodiak bear plan recognized bear hunting as a legitimate, traditional, and biologically justifiable activity. It recommended that agencies find ways to make bear hunting and bear viewing compatible on the archipelago.|$|E

25|$|Hence, {{from the}} sixth year of {{schooling}} onwards, instruction {{should be in}} European learning, with English as the medium of instruction. This would create a class of anglicised Indians who would serve as cultural intermediaries between the British and the Indians; the creation of such a class was necessary before any reform of vernacular education:I <b>feel...</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> impossible for us, with our limited means, to attempt to educate {{the body of the}} people. We must at present do our best to form a class who may be interpreters between us and the millions whom we govern, – a class of persons Indian in blood and colour, but English in tastes, in opinions, in morals and in intellect. To that class we may leave it to refine the vernacular dialects of the country, to enrich those dialects with terms of science borrowed from the Western nomenclature, and to render them by degrees fit vehicles for conveying knowledge to the great mass of the population.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{large and}} vocal group of Koreans (consisting {{of a number of}} animal welfare groups) who are against the {{practice}} of eating dogs. Popular television shows like 'I Love Pet' have documented, in 2011 for instance, the continued illegal sale of dog meat and slaughtering of dogs in suburban areas. The program also televised illegal dog farms and slaughterhouses, showing the unsanitary and horrific conditions of caged dogs, several of which were visibly sick with severe eye infections and malnutrition. However, despite this growing awareness, there remain some in Korea that do not eat or enjoy the meat, but do <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> the right of others to do so, along with a smaller but still vocal group of pro-dog cuisine people who want to popularize the consumption of dog in Korea {{and the rest of the}} world. A group of pro-dog meat individuals attempted to promote and publicize the consumption of dog meat worldwide during the run-up to the 2002 FIFA World Cup, co-hosted by Japan and South Korea, which prompted retaliation from animal rights campaigners and prominent figures such as Brigitte Bardot to denounce the practice. Opponents of dog meat consumption in South Korea are critical of the eating of dog meat, as some dogs are beaten, burnt or hanged to make their meat more tender.|$|E

He said, [...] "I <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> now necessary to leave Rage because our decision-making process has completely failed. It is no longer meeting the aspirations of all four of us collectively as a band, and from my perspective, has undermined our artistic and political ideal." [...] "There was so much squabbling over everything", explained Morello, [...] "and I mean everything. We would even have fist fights over whether our T-shirts should be mauve or camouflaged! It was ridiculous. We were patently political, internally combustible. It was ugly for a long time".|$|E
500|$|Talpade, who {{previously}} featured {{as the title}} character of Kukunoor's Iqbal (2005), observed the bahuroopiyas in Rajasthan and incorporated their dialect, accent, and their body language for his character. About Kukunoor, he said that, [...] "though one tends to go overboard as an actor most of the times, the way he handles the character as a director, Nagesh makes you <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> very simple for you to delineate the character." [...] Through his character of a bahuroopiya, Talpade was required to perform mimicry. While {{he was good at}} mimicry in college, it was during the filming of Iqbal, Kukunoor noted this talent of his and thus Dor came into Talpade's hands.

500|$|In later years, Fellini {{explained}} that from [...] "a sentimental point of view," [...] he was [...] "most attached" [...] to La Strada: [...] "Above all, because I <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> my most representative film, {{the one that}} is the most autobiographical; for both personal and sentimental reasons, because it is the film that I had the greatest trouble in realizing and that gave me the most difficulty {{when it came time to}} find a producer." [...] Of all the imaginary beings he had brought to the screen, Fellini felt closest to the three principals of La Strada, [...] "especially Zampanò." [...] Anthony Quinn found working for Fellini invaluable: [...] "He drove me mercilessly, making me do scene after scene over and over again until he got what he wanted. I learned more about film acting in three months with Fellini than I'd learned in all the movies I'd made before then." [...] Long afterwards, in 1990, Quinn sent a note to the director and his co-star: [...] "The two of you are the highest point in my life -- Antonio." ...|$|E

Vasu becomes mad, and, resorts to avenge his loss. At the time of his arrest he gives Krishnamoorthy a warning that he would kill him and his family.

500|$|On May 7, 2013, Lambesis {{was arrested}} in Oceanside, California, US after {{allegedly}} hiring an undercover detective to kill his estranged wife. The report {{was made by the}} San Diego County Sheriff's Department, leaving the future of the band uncertain. On the following day, the band released a statement in which they said: [...] "The legal process is taking its course and we have no more information than you do. There are many unanswered questions, and the situation will become clearer in the coming days and weeks. We'll keep you informed as best we can." [...] They also stated that their thoughts were [...] "with Tim, his family, and with everyone else affected by this terrible situation." [...] Eight days later, the band cancelled their mid-2013 tour with Killswitch Engage, stating that [...] "we <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> best for the band to be off the road while the current situation gets sorted". During the month of his initial arrest, Lambesis pleaded [...] "not guilty" [...] and his lawyer stated: [...] "His thought processes were devastatingly affected by his steroid use."

500|$|Verbal {{report is}} widely {{considered}} to be the most reliable indicator of consciousness, but it raises a number of issues. [...] For one thing, if verbal reports are treated as observations, akin to observations in other branches of science, then the possibility arises that they may contain errors—but it is difficult {{to make sense of the}} idea that subjects could be wrong about their own experiences, and even more difficult to see how such an error could be detected. [...] Daniel Dennett has argued for an approach he calls heterophenomenology, which means treating verbal reports as stories that may or may not be true, but his ideas about how to do this have not been widely adopted. [...] Another issue with verbal report as a criterion is that it restricts the field of study to humans who have language: [...] this approach cannot be used to study consciousness in other species, pre-linguistic children, or people with types of brain damage that impair language. [...] As a third issue, philosophers who dispute the validity of the Turing test may <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> possible, at least in principle, for verbal report to be dissociated from consciousness entirely: [...] a philosophical zombie may give detailed verbal reports of awareness in the absence of any genuine awareness.|$|E
500|$|Định {{believed}} that Tự Đức would eventually realise his error and reward the insurgents. Historians <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> likely that Gian and Tự Đức saw Định's continued resistance as a misguided attempt {{to help the}} monarchy. In their written confrontation after {{the signing of the}} treaty, Gian did not accuse Định of being a rebel, but of excessive devotion to the emperor, which while admirable in principle, was hindering their current strategy. [...] "Monarchical loyalty is a noble quality", Gian had told the recalcitrant guerrilla leader, but [...] "t must have a limit. One cannot exceed this limit and still be faithful and pious. Too much is just as bad as not enough; when a snake begins to have legs, it is no longer a snake..." [...] Tự Đức also appeared to view Định's continued resistance as a misguided manifestation of loyalty. Although the southern insurgents' disobedience provided the French with a pretext for further aggression, thereby hindering Tự Đức's plans for regaining the lost territory, the emperor never accused them of rebelling against royal authority. Instead, he continued to refer to them as [...] "righteous recruits" [...] motivated by [...] "indignation" [...] at the actions of the Westerners.|$|E

The idea of the song came to Muñiz after he started to say phrases [...] "like when you think about your girlfriend" [...] accompanied by a piano and an electric guitar. In an interview, the singer stated, [...] "I <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a very Californian song [...] because it is a more proactive and current pop, and the fact that Alexandra Stan recorded a part of the song moved me a lot". On another occasion, he added, [...] "We wanted to do a song with which you can tell a person that you miss her, that you are always thinking about her and longing to be with her. This was the idea of the track". Stan and Muñiz were linked by producer Gabriel Huiban, who previously worked with the latter. [...] "Siempre Tú" [...] was released worldwide on 21 April 2017 through Warner Music Mexico.

500|$|Following Happy Endings, she {{starred in}} the 2006 films Trust the Man, Stranger than Fiction, Monster House, World Trade Center, and Sherrybaby.

The film was critically and financially unsuccessful. Ethan Alter of Premiere felt that the performances by Gyllenhaal and Duchovny were [...] "much more at ease" [...] and concluded with [...] "that's probably because they're [...] played these characters many times before". In Stranger than Fiction, Gyllenhaal played a love interest of Harold Crick, played by Will Ferrell. Her performance in the film received favorable reviews; Mike Straka of Fox News wrote: [...] "Gyllenhaal has never been sexier in any film before and her interplay with Ferrell will propel her to more A-list films, leaving her indie-darling days behind, no doubt." [...] She voiced Elizabeth [...] "Zee" [...] in the computer animated horror film Monster House. Gyllenhaal played Allison Jimeno, the wife of Port Authority officer Will Jimeno, in Oliver Stone's World Trade Center, based on the September 11 attacks in New York City. She regarded this as [...] "one of the films she most enjoyed making". The film received favorable reviews and proved to be an international success, earning US$162million worldwide.|$|E

The Raw Story states, [...] "Whether [...] describes a traditional or even common lesbian act remains up for debate." [...] Some sources, however, such as Shere Hite's 1976 and 1981 research, show that women may enjoy performing the scissoring position with other women because it is a variation of vulva-to-vulva contact or can allow for maximum vulva-to-vulva contact and therefore an elevated level of intimacy.|$|E
