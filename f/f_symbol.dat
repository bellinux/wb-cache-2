40|$|Matrix variate {{distributions}} are {{are used}} to quantify uncertainty in the mass, stiffness and damping matrices. The proposed approach {{is based on the}} so called Wishart random matrices. The probability density function of the system matri-ces are derived using the maximum entropy method. It is assumed that the mean of the system matrices are known. A new optimal Wishart distribution is pro-posed to model the random system matrices. The optimal Wishart distribution is such that the mean of the matrix and its inverse produce minimum deviations from their deterministic values. The method proposed here gives a simple non-parametric approach for uncertainty quantification and propagation for complex aerospace structural systems. The new method is illustrated using two examples.

40|$|Literature can {{be defined}} as a work or an art {{activity}} which has a correlation with expression and creation. In other words, literary works such as drama, poem, poetry, novel, etc expose humanâ€™s expression of life and people may choose one of them to express their feeling, imagination and creation. The writer chooses Dan Brownâ€™s novel, "The Da Vinci Code" as the topic of this thesis. This novel is categorized as the mystery or detective novel, because this novel is full of secrets and mystery which tried to be revealed by Robert Langdon to find out the truth about The Priory of Sionâ€™s secrets. The writer of this thesis formulated three problems which are aimed at finding out The Priory of Sionâ€™s dogmas, the reason of The Priory of Sion protected itâ€™s dogmas, and the way of The Priory of Sion protected itâ€™s dogmas. This study used descriptive qualitative research because it explained the data descriptively that is taken from the statement of the problems. The writer used objective approach because this study much concerned with the object in this case "The Da Vinci Code" novel. The result of the study shows that: (1) There are three dogmas of The Priory of Sion. (a) Jesus was a mortal prophet, (b) Jesus had a family (Jesusâ€™s wife and descendants), and (c) Jesus gave The Churchâ€™s authority to Mary Magdalene. (2) There is one reason of why The Priory of Sion protect itâ€™s secret that is because the secret is in danger. (3) There are thirteen ways of The Priory of Sion protect itâ€™s secret, they are (a) made a false clue, (b) anagram, (c) monogram, (d) cryptex, (e) poem, (<b>f)</b> <b>symbol.</b> In symbol, there are seven kinds of symbols used by The Priory of Sion. They are: (a) virtuvrian man, (b) pentacle, (c) fleur de lis, (d) rose, (e) rose line, (f) blade and chalice, (g) holy grail. The last is (g) move the location of holy grail...|$|E

This is obtained from the standard spin- 1 / 2 conjugate free-field representation by bosonization. Because of the mixed statistics, some of these conjugate pairs are of the βγ type-similar to the superghosts appearing in Neveu-Schwarz-Ramond strings.
