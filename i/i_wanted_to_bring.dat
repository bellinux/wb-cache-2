500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Rock with U" [...] {{was directed by}} Saam Farahmand and choreographed by Gil Duldulao. It premiered on Access Granted on March 5, 2008. Jackson described Farahmand as an excited, passionated and creative person. He {{wanted to make the}} video as a long take video, like the music video for previous single [...] "Feedback", which he also directed. According to the singer, the makeup looks and fashion of the video were a [...] "futuristic version of the Blitz Kids from the 80's". Dulduao commented [...] "I just wanted sort of bring Janet into the visionary style she's had in the past and <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> to like, video, and bring it back". He also mentioned that it took him at least {{a day and a half}} to finish its choreography.|$|E
500|$|After Minaj was {{announced}} as the opening act in April 2011, she said on Ryan Seacrest's radio show {{she was looking}} forward to creating [...] "a new, a bigger, a brighter, a more spectacular show." [...] She stated that as much as her set was about the music, she wanted to put more theater on stage, saying, [...] "my goal [...] to truly put on a show and incorporate theater and dance." [...] The hair and make-up was done by Marco Berardini, who was inspired by European women such as Brigitte Bardot. [...] "It's the epitome of a strong woman. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> out that strength and sexiness for all the girls on tour", he said. He applied Spears with makeup and designed it to [...] "be a little bit neutral so that it could work with anything." [...] As for the hair, it was changed at every show to fit the vibe of the city. For example, at the Uniondale show on August 2, 2011, Spears sported wavy hair, inspired by Sarah Jessica Parker and the street style of New York women.|$|E

500|$|Liverpool manager Benítez was {{confident}} that victory in the match would provide his side with a boost ahead of their opening match of the 2006–07 Premier League with Sheffield United: [...] "This {{will give us a}} lot of confidence I am sure, to play one of the best sides in the world and to beat them, this should give us more confidence going into what will be an interesting season." [...] He also defended his decision to players such as Gerrard and Alonso on the bench: [...] "It was my idea to start with the players that had the most fitness and have played the most minutes. Then <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> the other players on towards the end. It worked and it showed that we have a great squad – better than last season." [...] Crouch, scorer of the winning goal, was also confident the result would boost the Liverpool squad: [...] "There is a bit of rivalry between the sides and it is great to get an early one over them. Make no bones about it, this is a big game to win and it certainly could give us a psychological edge this season." ...|$|E
500|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{directed}} by David LaChapelle, who previously directed the music videos for [...] "Dirrty" [...] (2002) and [...] "Can't Hold Us Down" [...] (2003). He explained to MTV News that the video's concept, [...] "There's all kinds of connotations to the word 'stripped.' I wanted to strip it down to one take. Just her and this incredible voice. And really not have anything {{that is going to}} overshadow that. She's trying to grow as an artist and along the way she's taking all kinds of risks {{and a lot of times}} people let those things overshadow her ability and her talent. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> it all back as a sort of bookend to this album". The video begins with a close-up scene of Aguilera and zooms out to her wearing a slip and sitting in an abandoned prop room. In one continuous black and white shot, Aguilera walks through several rooms, exits the building, and finally lays on a light box. The video was filmed at a deserted theater in downtown Los Angeles. It was inspired by neorealist works. The video was nominated for three 2004 MTV Video Music Awards: Best Female Video, Viewer's Choice, and Best Cinematography.|$|E

Andy was writing 11 minute musical epics and I couldn't even begin to see how I'd write lyrics for something like that. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> in other musical styles, to bring in violins for instance.

2500|$|On 19 January 2009, Bellamy {{completed}} his move to Manchester City on a four-and-a-half-year deal {{for an undisclosed}} fee believed to be around £14 million On signing for the club his new manager Mark Hughes stated, [...] "I'm sure Craig will be excellent for us, I think people will soon see why <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> him to the club.

[...] This took his career total of transfers to £47m. Bellamy became the second major signing by Manchester City of the transfer window after Wayne Bridge from Chelsea.|$|E
2500|$|Nolan {{compared}} Interstellar to The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948), as a {{film about}} human nature. He also sought to emulate films like Steven Spielberg's Jaws (1975) and Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977). He stated: [...] "When you say you're making a family film, it has all these pejorative connotations that it'll be somehow soft. But when I was a kid, these were family films in the best sense, and they were as edgy and incisive and challenging as anything else on the blockbuster spectrum. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> that back in some way." [...] He also cited the space drama The Right Stuff (1983) as an example to follow and screened it for the crew before production. To emulate that film, he sought to capture reflection on the Interstellar astronauts' visors. For further inspiration grounded in real-world space travel, the director also invited former astronaut Marsha Ivins to the set. Nolan and his crew studied the IMAX NASA documentaries of filmmaker Toni Myers for visual reference of spacefaring missions, and sought to emulate the look of their use of IMAX cameras in the enclosed spaces of a spacecraft interior.|$|E

2500|$|Originally {{expected}} for a March 2006 release, the album had two title changes and three unofficial releases until its official release the following year. Initially {{scheduled for a}} July 11, 2006 release, the album's original draft, entitled My Story, was eventually shelved {{in favor of a}} revamped version with a different vibe. Although manager Matthew Knowles initially insisted that the decision to push the release date from July 2006 was because more time would be needed to properly set up the project, Rowland later admitted that she had been unsatisfied with the album's direction, and thus, she asked to rework with a stable of new record producers on the project. Speaking of the delay and the original track listing, she told Billboard: [...] "it was basically a list of songs that I put together about the past three years of my life, with love and relationships", and added: [...] "And I remember listening to the record, and I was just like, 'I don't want this to be too deep to where, you know, [...] lose people.' And the record was too full of midtempos and ballads, so <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> it up a little bit." ...|$|E
