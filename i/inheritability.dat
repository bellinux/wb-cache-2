She chose ViaGen, an animal genetics corporation based in Austin, Texas, to perform the cloning procedure for $150,000. James registered the resulting colt born in 2006 with the American DNA Registry under the name Clayton, who is an identical genetic match to Scamper. James chose a surrogate mare to be the dam of the colt and receive the cloned embryo. At age two, James started Clayton as a breeding stallion. She offered his services to the public at a fee of $4,000. Clayton sired healthy progeny, many of whom have inherited Scamper's genetics. Of special note, the AQHA does not register cloned horses; however, breed registration is not required to compete in barrel racing or other PRCA and WPRA sanctioned rodeo events.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} {{of this article was}} to estimate the genetic variability and selection gain in the characters related with fruits in assai palms, 68 progenies collected in populations from Afuá city and planted in Amapá state were evaluated. The experiment was conducted in random blocks with two replications and four useful plants per plot. The following characters were evaluated: fruit longitudinal diameter (DLF), the fruit greatest transversal diameter (DTMA), the smallest fruit diameter (DTME); mass from one hundred fruits (P 100) and, in bunches: total fruit mass (PTC). There are differences between progenies, denoting the possibility of selection gains. In general, the <b>inheritabilities</b> were medium or high for the characters, but always lower for PTC. The coefficient CVg/CVe was favorable in DTMA and DTME and unfavorable to PTC; the correlations between characters were positive and significant, the selection gain was 16. 65 % for PTC and from - 1. 29 % to - 7. 60 % in the other characters; the selected progenies were able to associate the desired values in the evaluated characters. The obtained conclusions were that there is high environmental contribution in the phenotypic manifestation of the progenies once the fruit metric dimensions had lower environmental effects and higher genetic effect; there is possibility of genetic gains which are important to breeding programs of this species using the characters simultaneously, although the values had been low, mainly due to the positive correlation presence, where there is preference for reduced fruit size with productivity increase...|$|R
40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} genetic variation of twins in the archipelago of the Azores (Portugal), {{in the areas}} of physical activity and health-related physical fi tness. Based on a sample of 64 twin pairs, aged 12 to 40 years, from 8 of the 9 islands, we evaluated (1) levels of physical activity based on the Baecke questionnaire, and (2) health-related physical fitness values, as provided by the Fitnessgram test battery. Standard statistical procedures were used for these analyses, as well as <b>inheritabilities</b> estimates (h 2). All calculation were performed on SPSS 10 and SYSTAT 10. Results revealed moderate to high h 2 estim ates for physical activity, between 23. 4 % and 77 %. A similar picture was observed in the marker test for physical fitness; between 30 % and 80 %. We may conclude that moderate to high genetic differences between subjects are responsible for the heterogeneity of observed values in physical activity and physical fitness. It should also be mentioned that environmental factors are also important, opening an important window for physical and sports education, as well as for other environmental factors. RESUMO Este estudo tem como propósitos estudar aspectos da variação genética nos níveis de actividade física e aptidão física associada à saúde de gémeos do arquipélago dos Açores (Portugal). Com base numa amostra de 64 pares de gémeos dos 12 aos 40 anos pertencentes às 8 das 9 ilhas, foram avaliados (1) os níveis de actividade física com base no questionário de Baecke, (2) e os valores da aptidão física referenciados pela saúde providenciados pela bateria Fitnessgram. Os procedimentos estatísticos utilizados foram os usuais neste tipo de análises, bem como foram calculadas as estimativas de heritabilidade (h 2). Todos os cálculos foram efectuados nos programas SPSS 10 e Systat 10. Os resultados mostraram estimativas de h 2 moderadas a elevadas para os níveis de actividade física, entre 23. 4 % e 77 %. Um quadro algo semelhante de resultados ocorreu para os diferentes testes marcadores da aptidão física - entre 30 % e 80 %. As conclusões remetem-nos para diferenças genéticas moderadas a elevadas entre sujeitos e que são responsáveis pela heterogeneidade nos valores de actividade física e aptidão física.

50|$|These tumors, {{papillary}} {{tumors in}} this case, have no known predisposing genetic characteristics, {{as stated by}} Dr. Janss when I interviewed her.

However, technically speaking, there is genetics involved, just not in the sense of <b>inheritability.</b> The tumor cells may differ in their structure and function, but they all have normal function, which is directed by the deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA. There are meant to be certain cells in a specific area, for the pineal region these are ependymal cells, and the cells divide into millions. As these cells divide, their genetic material is being copied. In a tumor, there is a collection of mutations that are typos in the genetic material, which disrupts the function of the normal cell. Therefore, the cells differentiate from what they were meant to be. If the abnormal cells continue to grow, divide, and produce more abnormal cells, the mass of abnormal cells may eventually become a tumor.|$|E

30|$|One of {{the most}} {{challenging}} issues that restrict the biomass/waste-based nanocarbons in supercapacitor application is the poor structural <b>inheritability</b> during the activating process. Herein, we prepare a class of activated carbon fibers by carefully selecting waste cotton glove (CG) as the precursor, which mainly consists of cellulose fibers that can be transformed to carbon along with good <b>inheritability</b> of their fiber morphology upon activation. As prepared, the CG-based activated carbon fiber (CGACF) demonstrates a surface area of 1435  m 2  g− 1 contributed by micropores of 1.3  nm and small mesopores of 2.7  nm, while the fiber morphology can be well inherited from the CG with 3 D interconnected frameworks created on the fiber surface. This hierarchically porous structure and well-retained fiber-like skeleton can simultaneously minimize the diffusion/transfer resistance of the electrolyte and electron, respectively, and maximize the surface area utilization for charge accumulation. Consequently, CGACF presents a higher specific capacitance of 218  F g− 1 and an excellent high-rate performance as compared to commercial activated carbon.|$|E

What we intend to focus on in this paper is the <b>inheritability</b> or intergenerational transmission of environmental factors. This essentially amounts to the <b>inheritability</b> of phenotypic changes resulting from environmental factors, though these changes may in fact only become manifest in later generations. What we wish to argue is that this amounts to what is, in a certain sense, the transmission of experiences of past-generations via the body (i. e., via epigenetic influence on phenotypic development) onto future offspring.

30|$|Hitherto, {{with the}} {{decreasing}} availability of fossil-based PCMs, activated PCMs (APCMs) derived from biomass/waste materials of coconut shells and woods {{are still the}} commercial choice for supercapacitor electrodes because of their high performance-cost ratio and simple preparation process [20 – 24]. Numerous efforts have also been devoted to exploring novel biomass/waste-based APCMs for further improving their supercapacitive performance, such as cigarette filter, cigarette ash, tea leaves, human hair, and fish scale [25 – 28] Nevertheless, although a relatively large surface area can be obtained for electric double-layer formation during the activating process, such APCMs are usually lack of meso/macroporosity for electrolyte diffusion/transfer owing to the bulk nanostructure of the biomass/waste precursors and/or the poor structural <b>inheritability</b> during the activating process. This relatively low electrolyte diffusion/transfer efficiency usually results in low surface area utilization, particularly under high current densities. For example, Wang et al. prepared a kind of chicken feather-based APCMs by KOH activation. It possessed a low capacitance retention of 55 % as the current density was increased from 1 to 10  A g− 1 owing to its micropore-dominant structure [29]. Another class of willow leaf-based APCMs was obtained by Liu et al. through ZnCl 2 activation. It also displayed a poor capacitance retention of 70 % while increasing the current density from 1 to 5  A g− 1, because its original nanostructure was completely destroyed during the activating process [30]. Thus, carefully selecting a suitable biomass/waste precursor with developed nanostructure and good structural <b>inheritability</b> during the activating process is highly recommended but remains challenging.|$|E

Exploiting these ideas, we develop a declarative semantics of behavioral inheritance and overriding without having to resort to non-monotonic reasoning. Conflict resolution in our framework can be achieved both via specification and by detection. The possibility of specification-based conflict resolution through withdrawal allows users to state inheritance preference. We present a formal account of the semantics of our language by defining a model theory, proof theory and a fixpoint theory. We also show that the different characterizations of our language are equivalent...|$|E
40|$|Three crosses between 3 cultivat ed (G. max) and 2 aphid {{resistant}} wild soybean (G. soja) {{lines were}} made to study the inheritance of resistance and segregation patterns in F 2 generation with artificial inoculation technique s. The aphid resistance of F 2 plants showed continuous mono-peek distributions which are inclined towards the susceptible parents. Most F 2 plants were susceptible or highly susceptible. Only about 7. 2 to 10. 2 % of the F 2 plants were resistant to soybean aphid. The segregations in 2 out of 3 crosses studied fitted the hyp othesis that there are 2 independent gene pairs controlling the aphid resistant character of the wild soybean lines (P > 0. 50). The segregation of the other cross also tended to fit the 2 major gene model. These {{results indicated that the}} aphid resistance of the wild parents might be controlled by 2 independent recessive genes and some other minor genes. Supposing that the aphid resistant character was quantitatively inherited, the overall <b>inheritability</b> estimated from the variances of parents and F 2 populations was between 85. 5 % and 97. 0 %. Despite of the high <b>inheritability</b> of aphid resistance, it is recommended that the selection of resistance should be postponed to later generations such as F 3 or F 4, because the scarcity of resistant genes may be recessively inherited, and the number of backcrosses made in each cycle of selection should be limited to avoid the resistant genes being lost.

In our model, the incidence of dynastic management depends on the severity of asset-market imperfections, on the economy's saving rate, and on the degree of <b>inheritability</b> of talent across generations. We therefore introduce novel channels through which financial-market failures and saving rates affect aggregate total factor productivity.

30|$|Becker and Tomes (1979, (1986) have {{developed}} very relevant theoretical models of intergenerational earnings mobility where genetic transmission of abilities {{plays a key}} role. They assumed that children’s earnings are correlated with their parents’ both via the genetic <b>inheritability</b> of abilities and via spending on education by altruistic parents. Thus, children’s innate abilities are correlated, but not perfectly, with those of their parents and the total labor compensation to each worker will be an increasing function of his human capital, which is in turn an increasing function of ability and investment in education. One implication {{of the fact that}} abilities are enhanced by parents’ investments in their children’s education is that both inherited abilities and earnings regress toward the mean but, because of the effect of parental investment in children, earnings are more intergenerationally persistent than genetically inherited abilities.|$|E
