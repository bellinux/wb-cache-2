40|$|Most of the SMA {{graduates}} in Indonesia cannot speak English fairly well, {{although they have}} learned it since they were at SMP. It happens because the teaching of speaking does not get the same attention as that of teaching of grammar and reading. The teaching of speaking gets less time than the teaching of grammar and reading since the objcective of teaching English to SMA students stresses more on reading than on speaking. Furthermore, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>teach</b> speaking, they only give dialogues as the materials to the students {{and ask them to}} perform the dialogues through memorization. Everything the students say is all concerned with the written dialogues. The students, here, focus their minds on memorization, not on how to express their thoughts. In memorization, they are afraid of making mistakes that can ruin the whole memory. This can cause the students to be reluctant to participate in a speaking class. As a result, the speaking skill is insufficiently mastered by most of the students. Due to the above reason, <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> are supposed to choose the appropriate materials that provide opportunities for the students to express their thoughts well. So that, the students can really learn their lessons. One of the techniques which is suitable for teaching speaking is telling stories because this technique enables the students to express their feelings, ideas thoughts, etc. There are many stories to tell and <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> are supposed to choose the easiest ones which the students know well. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> students know a story well, it will facilitate them to tell the story. The stories which fulfill such requirements are personal stories. They can easily tell about their everyday’s life, families, friends, schools, pets, hobbies, and so on. In this study, the writer takes the stories which could be conducted to the first year of SMA students. Finally, the writer hopes that this technique may be used <b>the</b> English <b>teachers</b> in order to develop their students’ speaking skill and to achieve one of the objectives of learning English, that is, to able to speak in English...|$|R

30|$|What is {{the effect}} of class size on student achievement?) due to methodological {{considerations}} and data limitations. Under the best conditions, even when using methods that focus on making causal claims, answers to most researchers’ questions are qualified and limited in scope. The need to qualify findings and/or limit their scope can be attributed to measurement problems, selection bias, and the lack of ability to control for all relevant variables. When, and if, we are able to attend to the majority of these threats, especially with ILSA data, resulting claims are often limited in scope and not often suitable to address larger policy-focused questions. For example, simply creating a policy that mandates closer alignment to TIMSS will probably not improve test scores <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> do not <b>teach</b> <b>the</b> material or <b>if</b> <b>the</b> curriculum becomes too vast to be covered in 1  year. The necessarily narrow focus of most research aimed at causal inferences, especially with ILSA data, unfortunately creates a landscape where learning and achievement are presented as a highly simplified problem. In other words, findings that are overly narrow and do not account for the known complexity of our educational systems can misguide policymakers by ignoring complex interactions just {{as much as they can}} inform them about educational systems.|$|R
40|$|Reading {{comprehension}} is {{the most}} important skill a Dutch secondary school student has to acquire in order to pass final examinations for the foreign languages. However, the importance of reading comprehension is not reflected in the curriculum. Even though exam classes and also pre-exam classes practice reading comprehension so often that most students have had it with reading {{at the time of the}} exams, reading is not very important in the junior curriculum. The junior students have to learn to communicate their feelings, thoughts and values, and they have to know how to order something or how to complain. There is no doubt that being able to communicate in the foreign language is important, but fact is that students need to have a very good command of the written form of English if they want to go to tertiary education. In the Netherlands, the government has tried to bridge the gap between secondary and tertiary education. In 1998, the “Tweede Fase,” an upper grade curriculum for HAVO and VWO, designed to better prepare students for tertiary education, was introduced. However, students now have to take exams in more subjects, preventing them from going deeper into the subject matter, and they are not obliged to read as many books as before the implementation of the Tweede Fase. There still seems to be a discrepancy between the curriculum, as reflected by the eindtermen of the Tweede Fase, and the final exams and thus between secondary and tertiary education. Students have to learn to read, write, speak and listen, but are only tested in reading comprehension. Also, they are not prepared for the amount of reading that needs to be done in tertiary education. This discrepancy could be overcome by a slight change in, or addition to, the current curriculum. Studies show that extensive reading can increase students’ motivation, because extensive reading proves to students that reading does not have to be difficult and can indeed be fun. Extensive reading provides rich input in a country where English is a foreign language and thus not used on a daily basis. Extensive reading also provides more input, because students have more contact with the foreign language than when they only listen to <b>the</b> <b>teacher,</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> even <b>teaches</b> in English to begin with, use English in class during speaking exercises or watch television. That is why there should be more focus on extensive reading in secondary education, because extensive reading can prepare students for the examinations less painfully than reading comprehension tasks and students will become more proficient in the foreign language...|$|R

The purposes of this study are to know <b>the</b> <b>teacher’s</b> strategy in giving motivation to the students in pre-teaching, while-teaching, and post teaching activities at MA Al-Ishlah Pondok Pesantren Lamongan. In the present study, the writer used descriptive qualitative research. The subject of this study was the second year English teacher at MA Al-Ishlah. The instruments used to collect the data were observation and interview.

And the researcher also found that <b>the</b> English <b>teacher</b> used other strategies to motivate their learner that were not proposed in the theory.

São histórias contadas pelas próprias professoras, por meio de depoimentos, e contextualizadas no seu presente pelas observações de aulas de leitura, pretendendo com isso verificar pelas histórias de leitura dessas professoras se aquele que forma leitores na escola é leitor. Através dos depoimentos as professoras falam da trajetória de leitura percorrida por elas desde a infância até o momento em que foram convidadas a falar sobre esta trajetória. Falam também da escola e do descontentamento com a profissão. Se por um lado os depoimentos mostraram o envolvimento das professoras com a escrita ao longo de sua vida, por outro as aulas complementam os depoimentos mostrando esse envolvimento com a leitura também sob o ponto de vista profissional, ou seja, enquanto aquele que pretende formar leitores. 	Ao lado dos depoimentos das professoras foram colocados outros: o de pessoas que escreveram e publicaram suas histórias de leitura - escritores-leitores que muito contribuíram para minha própria história e que mostram em seus relatos como se tornaram e permaneceram leitores -' o meu, enquanto história de quem conviveu com muitas das situações apresentadas pelas professoras e que hoje se considera leitora. As condições de leitura apresentadas pelos escritores-leitores, o posicionamento dos autores citados nesta pesquisa sobre o que sejam a leitura e as condições de ser leitor vão de encontro à situação apresentada pelas professoras sujeitos desta pesquisa. As circunstâncias de vida e de trajetória de leitura apresentadas por elas; a forma como concebem a leitura e como conduzem suas aulas; a falta de acesso ao livro e/ ou similares e de tempo para utilizá-los, atualmente, constituem elementos que me levaram a entender que muitas destas professoras estão situadas na categoria de não-leitores.
