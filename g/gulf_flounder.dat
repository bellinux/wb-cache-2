50|$|<b>Gulf</b> <b>flounder</b> {{appear to}} prefer {{the ocean floor}} and {{camouflage}} against areas to stealthily strike their prey. This demersal species occurs in shallow depths within estuaries and coastal environments; it is most commonly found on the continental shelf at depths of 18-92 m, but has been collected to about 130 m.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Gulf</b> Stream <b>flounder</b> (Citharichthys arctifrons) is {{a species}} of fish {{belonging}} to the family Paralichthyidae native to waters off eastern North America.|$|R
50|$|Three similarly-sized {{species of}} Citharichthys {{have been found}} and {{are similar to the}} bay whiff. The <b>Gulf</b> Stream <b>flounder,</b> C. arctifrons; the sand whiff, C. arenaceus; and the spotted whiff, C. macrops.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Gulf</b> Stream <b>flounder</b> is a lefteyed {{flatfish}} whose {{mouth that}} lies about adjacent to its eyes. The {{defining characteristic of}} the <b>Gulf</b> Stream <b>flounder</b> is its large scales, which number about 40 on its lateral line. The left pectoral fin is noticeably longer than the right side pectoral fin. The pelvic fins are of equal size in female members of the species, but the right fin is larger in males. The fish is brown on the visible side of its body, and white on its blind side. It is colored dark brown on the upper side of its body, and a brownish white on {{the lower part of}} its body.|$|R
50|$|Female R. leporina {{are known}} for their high fecundity, but this can {{increase}} or decrease depending on the size and health of the female. Larger females have shown to produce more eggs than smaller females, which is shown in Coleman’s monitoring of 676 female R. leporina in the Hauraki <b>gulf.</b> <b>Flounder</b> that were 45 cm in length released up to 1.25 million eggs, while smaller females that were only 30 cm, released around 250,000 eggs.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Gulf</b> <b>flounder</b> is a {{flatfish}} that swims on its side. Their {{two eyes}} look upward when swimming. They have sharp teeth, two eyes on one side, {{and have a}} white side. Paralichthys albigutta is widely distributed in the western North Atlantic. Adults are found {{in a variety of}} habitats, but generally prefer hard, sandy bottoms; juveniles settle in high salinity seagrass beds. Longevity is 7-10 years and females reach maturity between 1-2 years. It is commercially and recreationally exploited. The center of abundance of Paralichthys albigutta in the Gulf of Mexico is along the northeastern coast of Florida. West of the Mississippi River delta, it occurs in very low numbers. It appears to naturally occur in low abundance in seagrass beds. It is common in museum collections (660 lots). Many species of fishes, including P. albigutta, have experienced declines in abundance in the Northern Gulf of Mexico from 1970-2000; although Fodrie et al. (2010), attributed this at least in part to the effects of global rises in sea temperature, there are also a number of other factors (e.g., bycatch in trawl fisheries, increased recreational landings: T. Munroe pers. comm. 2015) that may contribute to these declines. Gill netting has been implicated in the decline of flounder stocks in North Carolina due to targeting of non-reproductive juveniles; however, the population-level effects of this method of harvest on P. albigutta are unknown ...|$|E
40|$|Since January 2002, 23 {{cases of}} Puffer Fish Poisoning (PFP) were {{reported}} in four states due to saxitoxin (Quilliam et al., 2002) traced back to southern puffer fish (Sphoeroides nephelus) originating from the northern Indian River Lagoon (IRL) on Florida’s east coast (Bodager 2002). Saxitoxin was previously unknown in Florida marine waters (Landsberg et al., 2002). Because puffer fish were involved in PFP we have now routinely screened> 400 southern, 40 checkered (S. testudineus), and 40 bandtail puffer fish (S. dorsalis) for saxitoxins (STXs) statewide using the Ridascreen ‚ STX ELISA kits (Usleber et al., 1991). Since April 2002 selected biota from the IRL have also been tested for STX distribution and prevalence within the food web. The geographical hot spot for STXs in the IRL is in the north from Titusville south to Melbourne. Approximately 18. 1 % of samples (n = 791) were below the detection limit of 1 µg STXeq/ 100 g tissue, 27. 4 % were below 80 µg STXeq/ 100 g tissue, {{while the majority of}} samples, 54. 5 % contained moderate to high levels of STX in a range of tissues. Except for southern puffer fish, the muscle, skin, and mucus of which contain up to 5865. 5 µg STXeq/ 100 g tissue, STXs are present but below regulatory levels in the muscle of checkered puffer fish, Atlantic spadefish (Chaetodipterus faber), striped burrfish (Chilomycterus schoepfi), and porcupine fish (Diodon hystrix).

50|$|The {{geographic}} {{location of the}} New Zealand sand flounder determines its spawning period. In the north, it has a long spawning period from March to December. In the south, spawning largely occurs in the spring. A study in the Hauraki <b>Gulf</b> found sand <b>flounder</b> lay between 100,000 and 500,000 eggs when spawning. The variation {{in the number of}} eggs laid was attributed to the difference in size of the female laying the eggs.|$|R
40|$|In the 1990 s, {{important}} {{fish populations}} along U. S. coastlines, including mid-Atlantic summer <b>flounder,</b> <b>Gulf</b> of Mexico red snapper, and Pacific coast lingcod, were so depleted {{that the government}} categorized them as overfished. In 1996 and in 2006, Congress significantly strengthened the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the primary law governing our nation's ocean fish. The revisions included timelines for rebuilding depleted fish populations and science-based annual catch limits to prevent overfishing. Thanks to the Magnuson-Stevens Act, a cornerstone {{in one of the}} world's best fishery management systems, our nation's ocean fish are recovering from a history of overfishing...|$|R
50|$|They are {{a common}} sport fish that can be readily caught with dead fish (such as mullet), live bait, or even {{artificial}} or frozen baits such as shrimp or clams. A common way of catching this flounder is by spearfishing or jigging. The recreational daily bag limit for this species is 10 and the minimum size is 12 inches (established in 1996). Commercial fishermen are permitted to take up to 50 lbs of flounder species as by-catch per trip. The Gulf States Marine Fisheries Commission is currently conducting stock assessments for <b>gulf</b> and southern <b>flounder</b> populations in the Gulf of Mexico, which will inform {{the development of a}} fishery management plan. This species is commercially and recreationally exploited as a foodfish. It is caught using trawl, gill net, gig, hook-and-line, and trammel net. As with P. lethostigma, this species is harvested using gill nets in estuaries.|$|R
