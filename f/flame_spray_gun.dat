40|$|A novel flame spray collar {{called the}} Coanda Assisted Spray Manipulation collar (CSM) {{has been tested}} for use on the Sulzer Metco 5 P II {{combustion}} <b>flame</b> <b>spray</b> <b>gun.</b> A comparison study of the stock nozzle and the CSM has been performed by evaluating the porosity, surface roughness, microhardness, tensile strength and microscopy of normal and off-normal sprayed NiAl deposits. The use of the CSM collar resulted in the need to position the sprayed coupons closer to the gun, which in turn affected the particle impact energy and particle temperatures of the NiAl powder. For the CSM, porosities had a larger scatterband, surface roughness was comparably the same, microhardness was lower, and tensile strength was higher. The microscopy analysis revealed a greater presence of unmelted particles and steeper intersplat boundaries for the CSM. For both processes, the porosity and surface roughness increased and the microhardness decreased as the spray angle decreased...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Al 2 O 3 -Al 2 Cu 3 {{multiphase}} coatings {{were prepared}} {{on the surface}} of steel by reactive flame spray. The binding strength, microhardness and abrasion quality of the coatings were measured and analyzed. The influence of the agglomerate size on the properties of the coatings was emphatically studied to choose suitable size range for Al-CuO reactive system. The results showed that coatings prepared by using – 150 ∼+ 250 meshes agglomerates exhibited good mechanical properties. Based on the conventional thermal spray method, researchers have successfully put forward reactive spray technology and developed several corresponding methods including reactive arc spray, reactive plasma spray, and thermally explosive spray and so on. By these methods coatings such as Ti-C, Ti-B, Mo-Si system etc. were fabricated [1]. Reactive spray is different from conventional thermal spray in its purposeful use of SHS reactions during the spraying process to form dense coatings with low energy consumption and cheap reactive materials [2]. In this work metallic ceramic multiphase coatings of Al 2 Cu 3 O 2 were fabricated {{on the surface of}} steel by reactive flame spray. Al-CuO agglomerated powders were sprayed using a converted acetylene-oxygen <b>flame</b> <b>spray</b> <b>gun.</b> Effects {{of the size of the}} agglomerates on mechanical properties of the coatings were discussed. Al powders (purity of 99. 8 %) and analytically pure CuO were agglomerated in a solution of phenolic resin and dried at 100 - 120 ºC and then sieved. The agglomerated powders were sprayed on steel targets of 50 × 50 mm 2 and thickness of 6 mm. The top surface had been cleaned and sanded to remove grease and corrosion layer.

40|$|The {{controlled}} {{deposition of}} a {{catalytically active material}} on a support, resulting in defined particle sizes and shapes, as well as control over the specific surface area of the active material and the support are usually limited when applying conventional catalyst preparation techniques. <b>Flame</b> <b>spray</b> pyrolysis offers the potential to overcome this limitation and is tested for the preparation of Fischer-Tropsch catalysts. Conventional single <b>flame</b> <b>spray</b> pyrolysis and, for the first time, double <b>flame</b> <b>spray</b> pyrolysis are compared for the synthesis of alumina supported cobalt catalysts. In the latter process the metal oxide precursors are combusted individually in two opposing nozzles. The key parameter for defining the final material composition is the intersection distance of the flames, which was systematically varied. The Fischer-Tropsch performance of the Co-based catalysts was studied in a fixed bed reactor at 230 C and 20 bar. The catalytic results are discussed o n the basis of structural characterization of the different catalysts by XRD, BET, TPR, UV-vis and TEM/EF-TEM.

40|$|AbstractMaterial {{consumption}} and {{dry film thickness}} are the two main indicators for identifying the efficiency of spray coating process. Using a proper spray condition, less material consumption could be obtained as per a given dry film thickness. This paper presents the influences of supplying- air pressure, spray time and nozzle size of <b>spray</b> <b>gun</b> on the weight of material used per shot and the dry film thickness obtained. A high- volume-low-pressure type <b>spray</b> <b>gun</b> was used to atomize and deliver a liquid solution of Teflon depositing on a flat work surface. The experimental results showed that low spray time, large nozzle size and low spray pressure {{were responsible for the}} increased material {{consumption and}} dry film thickness. The optimization was performed, where the material consumption was minimized and the dry film thickness was set within a specified standard. Based on the geometric interaction between the <b>spray</b> <b>gun</b> and work-piece, a spray coating model in this application, which is considered unique was also developed and discussed in this paper. Moreover, this paper demonstrates a determination of the coefficient of spray coating process (k) through a relationship between coating thickness and material consumption using data obtained from the experiment. As a result, a relationship among the dry film thickness and positions of the <b>spray</b> <b>gun</b> was established and {{it can be used to}} predict the coating thickness. In conclusion, the optimal conditions in the spray coating process was determined to minimize material consumption whereas the developed spray coating model predicts the coating thickness related to the position of the <b>spray</b> <b>gun.</b> This model will substantially reduce <b>spray</b> <b>gun</b> setup time during production in order to obtain required dry film thickness...|$|R
