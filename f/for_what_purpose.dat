25|$|Since his {{childhood}} Haridas Baba had accepted disciplined life as essential in spiritual progress. He became a monk and adopted silence {{as a way}} of seeking inner peace. For health reasons, and to eliminate digestive problems he had with his liver, he chose to drink a glass of milk once or twice a day instead of taking solid food. Since the early days of his association with Neem Karoli he encountered several obstacles in his observance of silence, or eating habits. During one Kumbha Mela, he was obligated by Neem Karoli to break those monastic rules for the reason of following the house rules as having higher but whimsical priority ("What is this rule? <b>For</b> <b>what</b> <b>purpose</b> is it made?").|$|E
25|$|Every {{municipality}} {{is required}} to maintain a publicly accessible zoning map indicating what parcels of property within the municipality may be used <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>purpose.</b> This map must be updated at least every five years. Every municipality is required by state law to have a zoning administrator who oversees the local government's regulatory scheme, and is generally the party responsible for bringing legal actions against zoning violators. Each municipality is also required to have a board of zoning appeals empowered to grant variances and settle boundary disputes. The standard for granting of variances is that the party requesting the variance faces an unnecessary hardship unique to that party, but that adjacent property will not suffer a substantial detriment, and {{the character of the}} district will not be changed. The board may also grant special use permits allowing a property owner to use a property for a purpose that is neither specifically permitted nor specifically prohibited within a particular zoning area, and such permits may be conditioned on the property owner making concessions such as improving roads leading into the property, providing street lighting in the area, or setting aside a certain amount of land for public use. The board of zoning appeals may be appealed to the local Circuit Court if such an appeal is filed within 30 days of the zoning board decision, and from there decisions may be appealed directly to the Virginia Supreme Court.|$|E
500|$|How {{the work}} was {{obtained}} and <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>purpose</b> is also a factor. If {{the work was}} obtained illegally or unethically, the dealing {{is less likely to}} be [...] "fair" [...] than if it was legitimately acquired. Similarly, if the motives of the dealing are negative, the fairness will be impugned. As in Hyde Park, the court must [...] "judge the fairness by the objective standard of whether a fair minded and honest person would have dealt with the copyright work in the manner" [...] in question. Consequences are also a factor; if, as in Hubbard v Vosper, the parties to the case are competitors and infringing on the work acts as an alternative to purchasing the original, this will limit the fairness of the dealing. Occasionally the courts will also consider whether the purpose of the infringement could have been achieved in a less intrusive way, as in Hyde Park.|$|E

Various reasons, such as an attempt by Rome to control the incense trade, have been suggested but never proven. Juba II, former king of Mauretania, accompanied Gaius to the east. In order to prepare Gaius for his encounter with the Arabs, Juba wrote him a treatise. According to Pliny, the young prince made it as far as the Gulf of Aqaba. It is certain that this expedition happened before his time in Armenia, and, referencing Gaius' cenotaph in Pisa, it is almost certain to have taken place during his consulship.|$|E
