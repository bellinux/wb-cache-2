40|$|Neuropathic pain (NP) of head or face {{commonly}} {{consists of}} trigeminal neuralgia, glossopharyngeal neuralgia, occipital neuralgia, and postherpetic neuralgia, {{which is often}} reported as having lancinating, burning or lightning pain and {{is often associated with}} the appearance of abnormal sensory signs such as spontaneous pain, allodynia or hyperalgesia. Migraine is a common primary headache, characterized by usually throbbing pain, often unilateral in distribution and often associated with nausea, vomiting, photophobia, phonophobia, osmophobia and aggravation after physical activities. Chronic daily headache (CDH) is defined as a primary headache which occurs at least 15 <b>d</b> <b>per</b> <b>month</b> and more than 3 months, including chronic migraine, chronic tension-type headache, and new daily persistent headache, et al. The pathogenesis of these two types of headache can be explained partially by "central sensitization", which is also important to the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the masseter inhibitory reflex (MIR) and its eventual changes {{in patients with}} episodic tension-type headache (TTH). Methods: MIR was studied in 21 patients with episodic TTH and 30 healthy subjects, with age and sex matched to the study cohort. Median age of patients was 17. 0 years (ranged 16 ~ 49 years), median duration of disease 12 months (1 ~ 5 years), and median frequency of headache 7. 5 <b>d</b> <b>per</b> <b>month.</b> Results: The second period of suppression (S 2) of MIR was reduced in intensity and duration in 10 % of controls and 66. 7 % (confidence interval (CI) = 45. 3 %~ 85 %; P< 0. 05) of patients with episodic TTH (χ 					 2 = 74. 9; P< 0. 001). In 3 (14. 3 %) of patients with episodic TTH, S 2 was completely absent. No significant correlation between the duration of disease and headache frequency was found. Conclusion: Our results confirm the link between episodic TTH and reduction or absence of S 2. Teenage patients with episodic TTH may exhibit marked pathological changes in S 2 in contrast to older individuals...|$|E

40|$|Irritable bowel {{syndrome}} (IBS) is {{a common}} functional gastrointestinal disorder. According to the Rome III criteria, IBS is defined as recurrent abdominal pain or discomfort for at least 3 <b>d</b> <b>per</b> <b>month</b> during the previous 3 mo associated with {{two or more of}} the following symptoms: improvement with defecation, onset associated with a change in the frequency of stool and/or onset associated with a change in form or appearance of stool. There is growing evidence regarding the genetic contribution in IBS, however the precise etiology of IBS is still unknown. The evaluation of the genetic influence is based on twin studies, familial aggregation and genetic epidemiological investigations. Most studies showed a concordance for IBS significantly greater in monozygotic than in dizygotic twins. The majority of the studies have shown that familial aggregation may represent exposures to a similar environment, as well as the influence of genetic factors. Whereas no specific gene has been identified in association with IBS, recent studies have noticed the importance of polymorphisms in the promoter region of the serotonin reuptake transporter gene, G-protein beta 3 subunit gene (C 825 T), cholecystokinin receptor (CCKAR gene 779 T>C), and high-producer tumor necrosis factor genotype. Further studies are necessary to determine how genetic factors influence the clinical manifestations and therapeutical response in IBS patients...|$|E
40|$|Aim: This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the effects of vitamin D intake on COPD exacerbation and FEV 1 in the patients with severe and very severe COPD. Methods: This double blind placebo control randomized clinical trial study {{was done in the}} Ashayer university hospital in Khorramabad in 2012. Eighty eight patients with severe and very severe COPD were randomly selected from those who recoursed to the internal medicine clinic of Ashayer hospital. They were randomly allocated to case and placebo group. The patients received routine treatment for COPD. Along with the routine treatment, placebo group received 100, 000 IU of oral vitamin <b>D</b> <b>per</b> <b>month,</b> for 6 months. Data was analyzed using SPSS computer software, paired t-test, independent t-test, non parametric t-test and Pearson correlation coefficients. Results: In each group, there were 44 patients. After the intervention, there were significant differences in FEV 1 and the number of COPD exacerbation between the case and control group patients. Also, after the study, in the case group, FEV 1 was increased and the number of COPD exacerbation was decreased significantly. Conclusion: Vitamin D intake decreased COPD exacerbation and improved FEV 1 in the patients with severe and very severe COPD. It is suggested that baseline serum vitamin D levels will recorded in similar studies and the effect of vitamin D intake will evaluated regarding the baseline serum vitamin D levels...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: This {{prospective}} study investigated characteristics of fit {{and performance of}} silicone contact lenses under conditions of permanent wear in cases of aphakia after congenital cataract. METHODS: Seventeen aphakic children (8 eyes unilateral, 18 eyes bilateral) were fitted with silicone contact lenses on an empirical basis {{without the use of}} keratometry. The lenses were worn on a permanent basis, with a routine replacement every 3 months. The follow up was 6 years, with evaluation lens parameters, fitting characteristics, lens condition, replacement rate, wearing time, complications, and visual acuity. RESULTS: The back optical zone radius (BOZR) remained stable at 7. 50 mm, up to the age of 1. 5 years old. At the age of 4 years, almost all eyes needed a BOZR of 7. 90 mm. Mean +/- SD contact lens power was + 25. 47 diopter (D) +/- 4. 0 (range + 32. 00 D - + 20. 00 D) at 3 months of age, and + 17. 94 D +/- 3. 8 (range + 29. 00 D - + 15. 00 D) at 3 years of age. This represents an average decrease of 0. 23 <b>D</b> <b>per</b> <b>month.</b> The power decrease in unilateral cases was significantly lower (P 20 / 40) in 1 eye. Lens usage over a total period of 90 wearing years was 5. 6 lenses/eye/year, including the regular exchange every 3 months. No serious complications occurred. A positive correlation (r = 0. 89) was found between age and deposit buildup. With the need for permanent wear reduced, therefore, 73 % of the eyes were refitted with high-water content soft lenses or high gas-permeable (HGP) lenses, when the patients ranged in age from 4 to 6 years old. CONCLUSIONS: The procedure for fitting silicone lenses in aphakic children is feasible in an easy and logical way without keratometry. Permanent wear with a low complication rate is possible up to the age of 3. with a lens usage (including a 3 -month regular exchange) of 5. 6 lenses/eye/year. From the age of 3, deposit formation is the determining factor for refitting with high-water content soft or HGP lense...|$|E
