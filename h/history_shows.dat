5|$|Hayes is {{an inmate}} of the Connecticut Department of Correction. His {{criminal}} <b>history</b> <b>shows</b> him sentenced {{for his first}} offense {{at the age of}} 16. Subsequent to sentencing for the Petit murders, and up until August 16, 2016 (when he was transferred to a correctional facility in Pennsylvania as part of an interstate corrections compact), he was incarcerated in the Northern Correctional Institution, which houses the state's death row for men, in Somers, Connecticut. The method of execution employed by Connecticut was lethal injection, and the state execution chamber was located in the Osborn Correctional Institution in Somers. This sentence became an automatic life sentence when Connecticut abolished the death penalty in 2015.|$|E

5|$|Like Wollstonecraft's first novel, , The Wrongs of Woman {{is heavily}} autobiographical; the two novels even repeat {{many of the}} same biographical details. After being {{abandoned}} by her lover and the father of her child, Gilbert Imlay (the model for Darnford), Wollstonecraft attempted to commit suicide. Her despair over these events is written into the book as well as many other experiences from the mid-1790s. Moreover, Maria Venables's family <b>history</b> <b>shows</b> clear similarities to Wollstonecraft's own. Like Maria, Wollstonecraft had a mother who favored an elder brother and she also devotedly cared for that mother during her dying days, only to be pushed away during the final moments of her life. Wollstonecraft also looked after her sisters like Maria does, albeit without the help of a wealthy uncle. Perhaps most strikingly, Wollstonecraft's sister Eliza left her husband, at Wollstonecraft's prodding, much as Maria leaves hers. As Kelly explains, autobiography is common in Jacobin novels. Philosophical novels were expected to be autobiographical; audiences believed that the philosophizing novelists would draw on their own experiences in order to illustrate their abstract principles.|$|E
5|$|Nuclear {{power and}} fossil fuels are subsidized by many governments, and wind power {{and other forms}} of {{renewable}} energy are also often subsidized. For example, a 2009 study by the Environmental Law Institute assessed the size and structure of U.S. energy subsidies over the 2002–2008 period. The study estimated that subsidies to fossil-fuel based sources amounted to approximately $72 billion over this period and subsidies to renewable fuel sources totalled $29 billion. In the United States, the federal government has paid US$74billion for energy subsidies to support R for nuclear power ($50 billion) and fossil fuels ($24 billion) from 1973 to 2003. During this same time frame, renewable energy technologies and energy efficiency received a total of US$26billion. It has been suggested that a subsidy shift would help {{to level the playing field}} and support growing energy sectors, namely solar power, wind power, and biofuels. <b>History</b> <b>shows</b> that no energy sector was developed without subsidies.|$|E

25|$|The fungi were {{originally}} treated as plants. For {{a short period}} Linnaeus had classified them in the taxon Vermes in Animalia, but later placed them back in Plantae.

25|$|From October 1933 to June 1935, the {{committee}} of six looked into many options. They covered Brazil, British Guiana, Niger, however, all failed. A further {{suggestion that the}} British Red Cross might send a relief party to Mosul was also objected to, apparently {{on the grounds that}} this would discourage the activities of the Iraqi Crescent, which has not carried out any relief work among the Assyrians. In September 1935, the plan of settling of some of the Assyrians in the Khabour and Ghab areas in Syria was approved. <b>History</b> <b>shows</b> that the plan was never followed up so it too has failed.|$|E
25|$|It {{turned out}} however that Siam {{was not his}} {{greatest}} adversary. It was the remote mountainous states like Lan Xang, Mohnyin and Mogaung whose guerrilla warfare gave him constant trouble. Many of his men died from starvation and disease while fruitlessly searching for elusive bands of rebels, year after year. (The death toll must have been significant since it {{made it to the}} chronicles.) He was fortunate that a charismatic guerrilla leader like Setthathirath died. In the end, his military might alone could not bring lasting peace. He needed competent local rulers, who commanded respect of the local populace, to rule the lands on his behalf. <b>History</b> <b>shows</b> that he used the political solution instead to maintain peace.|$|E
25|$|To further sketch psychiatry's <b>history</b> <b>shows</b> a {{departure}} from structural neuropathology, relying more upon ideology (Sabshin, 1990). A {{good example of this}} is Tourette syndrome, which Ferenczi (1921), although never having seen a patient with Tourette syndrome, suggested was the symbolic expression of masturbation caused by sexual repression. However, starting with the efficacy of neuroleptic drugs in attenuating symptoms (Shapiro, Shapiro and Wayne, 1973) the syndrome has gained pathophysiological support (e.g. Singer, 1997) and is hypothesized to have a genetic basis too, based on its high inheritability (Robertson, 2000). This trend can be seen for many hitherto traditionally psychiatric disorders (see table) and is argued to support reuniting neurology and psychiatry because both are dealing with disorders of the same system.|$|E

25|$|Although rather {{informal}} and small scale, {{the early days}} of Japanese hip-hop provide the history for the emergence of the cultural movement. Early hip-hop was not led by corporate interests, but rather was largely ignored by large record companies and performance venues. In this respect, Japanese hip-hop offers a representation of cultural globalization, as it expanded despite criticism on the part of record companies and major media outlets. The <b>history</b> <b>shows</b> that certain kinds of cultural exchange are not initiated through cultural understanding, but instead from some interaction that can incite a desire to learn, to participate, and to contribute individuality. In Japan, this motivation to represent individuality was breakdancing, {{which was one of the}} leading edges of hip-hop at the time.|$|E
25|$|While he {{may have}} courted Mons for he {{depended}} on Lower Burma's manpower and maritime wealth to fund his wars, <b>history</b> <b>shows</b> he truly trusted his ethnic Mon inner circle to his gruesome death. He needed and prized loyal local lords for governing since {{he spent much of}} his reign (1534–1549) on military campaigns. Local lords in turn were loyal to him, not to the highly devolved central administration. Not surprisingly, the kingdom he had built up purely through military conquests fell apart right after his death. Indeed, the much greater empire of Bayinnaung, which too was built on sheer military conquests, would see the same fate within the decade following the conqueror's death in 1581. The weak decentralized administration era would continue until the early 17th century when Restored Toungoo kings first introduced administrative reforms to centralize power.|$|E
25|$|Anawrahta's first acts as king were to {{organize}} his kingdom. He graded every town and village {{according to the}} levy it could raise. He made great efforts to turn the arid parched lands of central Burma into a rice granary. He constructed the irrigation system, which is still used in Upper Burma today. He repaired the Meiktila Lake, and successfully built four weirs and canals (Kinda, Nga Laingzin, Pyaungbya, Kume) on the Panlaung river, and three weirs (Nwadet, Kunhse, Nga Pyaung) on the Zawgyi. (He also tried to control the Myitnge river but failed despite all his efforts. The work lasted three years {{and there were many}} casualties from fever.) He peopled the newly developed areas with villages, which under royal officers served the canals. The region, known as Ledwin (lit. the rice country) became the granary, the economic key of the north country. <b>History</b> <b>shows</b> that one who gained control of Kyaukse became kingmaker in Upper Burma.|$|E
