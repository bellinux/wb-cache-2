25|$|The Great Depression harmed <b>Kuwait's</b> economy, {{starting}} in the late 1920s. International trading was one of <b>Kuwait's</b> main sources of income before oil. Kuwaiti merchants were mostly intermediary merchants. As {{a result of the}} decline of European demand for goods from India and Africa, <b>Kuwait's</b> economy suffered. The decline in international trade resulted in an increase in gold smuggling by Kuwaiti ships to India. Some Kuwaiti merchant families became rich from this smuggling. <b>Kuwait's</b> pearl industry also collapsed {{as a result of the}} worldwide economic depression. At its height, <b>Kuwait's</b> pearl industry had led the world's luxury market, regularly sending out between 750 and 800 ships to meet the European elite's desire for pearls. During the economic depression, luxuries like pearls were in little demand. The Japanese invention of cultured pearls also contributed to the collapse of <b>Kuwait's</b> pearl industry.|$|R

In a modernizing city built on a very specific regime of labor migration and modernist/nationalist city planning that strategically censor the city’s duality, migrant worker’s spatial practices in <b>Kuwait’s</b> public space subvert their explicit exclusionary nature, injecting a brief public vision of communities rendered invisible by the official plan of the contemporary state...|$|R

5|$|On 2 August 1990, the Iraqi Army invaded and {{occupied}} the neighboring state of <b>Kuwait.</b> The invasion, which followed the inconclusive Iran–Iraq War and {{three decades of}} political conflict with <b>Kuwait,</b> offered Saddam Hussein the opportunity to distract political dissent at home and add Kuwait's oil resources to Iraq's own, a boon {{in a time of}} declining petroleum prices.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{the finding}} of {{additional}} specimens in <b>Kuwait,</b> the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) assessed the smoothtooth blacktip shark as Vulnerable based on its presumed small range and population. Despite {{the discovery of a}} second subpopulation off <b>Kuwait,</b> this species likely still warrants a Vulnerable assessment (or higher) because the waters around the Arabian Peninsula are subject to heavy fishing pressure and habitat degradation. Gillnet and other fisheries off <b>Kuwait</b> are known to take the smoothtooth blacktip shark as bycatch, while intensive Yemeni and Somalian shark fisheries operate in the Gulf of Aden. The status of the Yemen subpopulation is uncertain because no further specimens have been recorded since the original over a century ago.|$|E

5|$|Al-Kateb v Godwin, was a {{decision}} of the High Court of Australia, which ruled on 6 August 2004 that the indefinite detention of a stateless person was lawful.

The Commonwealth Minister for Immigration's decision to refuse the application was upheld by the Refugee Review Tribunal and the Federal Court. In 2002, Al-Kateb declared that he wished to return to <b>Kuwait</b> or Gaza.
