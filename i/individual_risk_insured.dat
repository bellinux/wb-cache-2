40|$|Existing {{credibility}} {{models have}} mostly allowed for {{one source of}} claim dependence only, that across time for an <b>individual</b> <b>insured</b> <b>risk</b> {{or a group of}} homogeneous <b>insured</b> <b>risks.</b> Numerous circumstances demonstrate that this may be inadequate and insufficient. In this dissertation, we developed a two-level common effects model, based loosely on the Bayesian model, which allows for two possible sources of dependence, that across time for the same <b>individual</b> <b>risk</b> and that between risks. For the case of Normal common effects, we are able to derive explicit formulas for the credibility premium. This takes the intuitive form of a weighted average between the <b>individual</b> <b>risk's</b> claims experience, the group's claims experience and the prior mean. We also consider the use of copulas, a tool widely used in other areas of work involving dependence, in constructing credibility premiums. Specifically, we utilise copulas to model the dependence across time for an <b>individual</b> <b>risk</b> or group of homogeneous risks. We develop the construction with several well-known families of copulas and are able to derive explicit formulas for their respective conditional expectations. Whilst some recent work has been done on constructing credibility models with copulas, explicit formulas for the conditional expectations have rarely been made available. Finally, we calibrate these copula credibility models using a real data set. This data set relates to the claims experience of workers' compensation insurance by occupation over a 7 -year period for a particular state in the United States. Our results show that for each occupation, claims dependence across time is indeed present. Amongst the copulas considered in our empirical analysis, the Cook-Johnson copula model is found to be the best fit for the data set used. The calibrated copula models are then used for prediction of the next period's claims. We found that the Cook-Johnson copula model gives superior predictions. Furthermore, this calibration exercise allowed us to uncover the importance of examining the nature of the data and comparing it with the characteristics of the copulas we are calibrating to...|$|R
40|$|The {{insurance}} industry {{needs to be}} regulated to protect policyholders. This is the main objective of the Solvency II directive – the new insurance regulations for the European Economic Area. In short, it requires insurance companies to act responsibly with the money they have been entrusted with. It is estimated that implementing Solvency II will cost 2 - 3 billion Euro. It {{has the potential to}} change a lot in the way insurance companies operate, and these changes will hopefully benefit not just policyholders but also the insurance companies in the long run. In this report we outline the main points of the directive and the reasoning behind them. The report is mostly a joint effort, with Sandra focusing on the parts about capital requirements and Oskar on the parts about supervision. 1 Why do we need insurance regulation? Insurance {{is an important part of}} the economy as it is a key part of the transfer of risk in society. By pooling a large number of risks and estimating the total losses of the group, an insurer transfers <b>individual</b> <b>risks</b> to the <b>insured</b> group as a whole. This is useful for individuals as well as businesses...|$|R
40|$|Shiller (2003) {{and others}} have argued for the {{creation}} of financial instruments that allow <b>individuals</b> to <b>insure</b> <b>risks</b> associated with their lifetime labor income. In this paper, we argue that while the purpose of such assets is to smooth consumption across states of nature, one must also consider the assets' effects on households' ability to smooth consumption over time. We show that consumers in a realistically calibrated life-cycle model would generally prefer income-linked loans (with a rate positively correlated with income shocks) to an income-hedging instrument (a limited liability asset whose returns correlate negatively with income shocks) even though the assets offer identical opportunities to smooth consumption across states. While for some parameterizations of our model the welfare gains from the presence of income-linked assets can be substantial (above 1 % of certainty-equivalent consumption), the assets we consider can only mitigate a relatively small part of the welfare costs of labor income risk over the life cycle. ...|$|R
40|$|Shiller (2003) {{and others}} have argued for the {{creation}} of financial instruments that allow <b>individuals</b> to <b>insure</b> <b>risks</b> associated with their lifetime labor income. In this paper, we analyze two such instruments {{in the context of a}} realistic life-cycle model of household portfolio choice. The instruments we consider are an income-hedging instrument (a limited liability asset whose returns correlate negatively with income shocks) and income-linked loans (with a rate positively correlated with income shocks). We find that income-linked loans would generally be more useful to households, as they have a lower (opportunity) cost. While for some parameterizations of our model the welfare gains from the presence of income-linked assets can be substantial (above 1 % of certainty-equivalent consumption), the assets we consider can only mitigate a relatively small part of the welfare costs of labor income risk over the life cycle.

In addition, robust examples of both existence and non-existence of asymmetric equilibria in Malinvaud's original formulation (with “pure” <b>individual</b> <b>risks)</b> are given...|$|R

But the risks incurred or carried by individual people, companies, insurance policies, or credit agreements {{can be just}} as devastating as macroevents such as share-price fluctuations. A comprehensive introduction, The Econometrics of <b>Individual</b> <b>Risk</b> is the first book to provide a complete econometric methodology for quantifying and managing this underappreciated but important variety of risk. The book presents a course in the econometric theory of <b>individual</b> <b>risk</b> illustrated by empirical examples. And, unlike other texts, it is focused entirely on solving the actual <b>individual</b> <b>risk</b> problems businesses confront today. Christian Gourieroux and Joann Jasiak emphasize the microeconometric aspect of risk analysis by extensively discussing practical problems such as retail credit scoring, credit card transaction dynamics, and profit maximization in promotional mailing. They address regulatory issues in sections on computing the minimum capital reserve for coverage of potential losses, and on the credit-risk measure CreditVar.
