5|$|The video {{begins as}} the protagonist parks {{her car and}} cries {{following}} an argument she has had with her lover. She then leaves the car, walks towards the sea, and lets down her hair. Flashbacks of {{the woman and her}} lover on the beach are shown. With teary eyes, she heads into the sea as waves break the shore. Back in the car, she imagines her lover holding her hands. The video transitions into color, as Beyoncé's character appears on the beach in a green dress and holds a rose without its petals, which she later restores. The video then flashes back to black-and-white memories of the woman resting her <b>head</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> lover's shoulder. She eventually realizes that she must set her relationship back on the right track. In the end, she drives off with a smile.|$|E
25|$|Tarleton, Christian, master, foundered on 28 November 1788 off St David's <b>Head</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> {{way from}} Liverpool to Africa. Her crew was saved. The Liverpool Registry records her {{as having been}} lost {{off the coast of}} Wales, and gives a date of 26 May 1789, but this date may {{represent}} a declaration rather than the date of the actual loss.|$|E
25|$|In 14 AD, her son Lü Yu (呂育), who {{had served}} in the {{government}} of Haiqu County, was executed by the county magistrate for a minor offence. To avenge his death, Mother Lü plotted a rebellion, using her wealth to recruit poor peasants and purchase weapons and supplies. She soon raised an army of several thousand people from a populace that had already been dissatisfied with the government. Mother Lü assumed the title of General and led her rebel force to storm the capital of Haiqu County. After capturing the county magistrate, she beheaded him and sacrificed his <b>head</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> son's tomb.|$|E

60|$|When day broke, indeed, the topsails {{of three}} of the Spanish ships could be seen on the horizon; but in two or three hours these sank out of sight, and the Swan was <b>headed</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> course west.|$|R
50|$|The Seagull's Laughter (Mávahlátur) is a 2001 Icelandic film {{directed}} by Ágúst Guðmundsson. It stars Ugla Egilsdóttir as Agga, an orphaned pre-teen distrusting of her cousin Freyja, played by Margrét Vilhjálmsdóttir, who turns <b>heads</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> return from America, {{no longer the}} chubby teen that the Icelandic townspeople remember.|$|R
25|$|The {{predecessor}} of {{the medieval}} bestiary, compiled in Late Antiquity and known as Physiologus (Φυσιολόγος), popularized an elaborate allegory in which a unicorn, trapped by a maiden (representing the Virgin Mary), stood for the Incarnation. As soon as the unicorn sees her, it lays its <b>head</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> lap and falls asleep. This became a basic emblematic tag that underlies medieval notions of the unicorn, justifying its appearance in every form of religious art. Interpretations of the unicorn myth focus on the medieval lore of beguiled lovers, whereas some religious writers interpret the unicorn and its death as the Passion of Christ. The myths refer to a beast with one horn {{that can only be}} tamed by a virgin; subsequently, some writers translated this into an allegory for Christ's relationship with the Virgin Mary.|$|E
25|$|However, in 1882 R. Mowat {{published}} an inscription in which Fortuna is called daughter of Jupiter, raising new questions and opening new perspectives in {{the theology of}} Latin gods. Dumézil has elaborated an interpretative theory according to which this aporia would be an intrinsic, fundamental feature of Indoeuropean deities of the primordial and sovereign level, as it finds a parallel in Vedic religion. The contradiction would put Fortuna both at the origin of time and into its ensuing diachronic process: it is the comparison offered by Vedic deity Aditi, the Not-Bound or Enemy of Bondage, that shows {{that there is no}} question of choosing one of the two apparent options: as the mother of the Aditya she has the same type of relationship with one of his sons, Dakṣa, the minor sovereign who represents the Creative Energy, being at the same time his mother and daughter, as is true for the whole group of sovereign gods to which she belongs. Moreover, Aditi is thus one of the heirs (along with Savitr) of the opening god of the Indoiranians, as she is represented with her <b>head</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> two sides, with the two faces looking opposite directions. The mother of the sovereign gods has thence two solidal but distinct modalities of duplicity, i.e. of having two foreheads and a double position in the genealogy. Angelo Brelich has interpreted this theology as the basic opposition between the primordial absence of order (chaos) and the organisation of the cosmos.|$|E
500|$|The {{reporter}} {{added that}} the head was hollow, and that when a lighted candle with a small crucible of water above it was placed inside {{the back of the}} head, steam was emitted from the horns while the red glass eyes glowed. Valiente saw the <b>head</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> meeting with Howard, describing it as [...] "a very impressive carving, having a crude strength and power which make it a remarkable work of primitive art." ...|$|E

5000|$|In the 1930s, {{when the}} RMS Mauretania was <b>heading</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> last voyage to the breaker's yard at Rosyth, the town council of Amble sent a {{telegram}} {{to the ship}} saying [...] "still the finest ship on the seas". The Mauretania replied with greetings [...] "to the last and kindliest port in England".|$|R

500|$|Opening {{with the}} {{disclaimer}} [...] "No mythological creatures were harmed {{in the making}} of this video", Kesha appears sitting next to two unicorns pouring champagne while having a conversation on how she was elected to the parliament of Uzbekistan, [...] "So I grabbed the bear by the throat and I looked him right in the eyes, and I said, 'Bear, you have till the count of zero to put some pants on and apologize to the president.'" [...] The music begins and Kesha makes eyes at James Van Der Beek. After the eye contact Kesha grabs one of the unicorns and kisses him then removes her bra and throws it across the room, Van Der Beek then does the same with his bra, puzzling Kesha as to why he was wearing a bra. The music fades in the background as the two then {{make their way to the}} center of the dance floor and exchange words ("Well, well, well. If it isn’t James Van Der Douche.", [...] "I don't appreciate you slander-Beeking my name, Ke dollar sign ha.") before engaging in a gun fight. They begin shooting lasers at one another, killing multiple unicorns. Van Der Beek gets hit in the shoulder and falls. Kesha steps on his arm to stop him from reaching for his gun, as he begs for mercy, which Kesha denies. At the end of the video, it is revealed that Kesha killed Van Der Beek and that she has mounted his <b>head</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> wall with the plaque reading, [...] "James Van Der Dead", as she sits with two unicorns laughing. She then frowns at the camera and it switches to Van Der Beek one more time before the screen goes black.|$|E
2500|$|Butler died {{outside of}} her home in Lake Forest Park, Washington, on February 24, 2006, aged 58. Contemporary news {{accounts}} were inconsistent as {{to the cause of}} her death, with some reporting that she suffered a fatal stroke, while others indicated that she died of head injuries after falling and striking her <b>head</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> walkway. [...] Another suggestion, backed by Locus magazine, is that a stroke caused the fall and hence the head injuries.|$|E
2500|$|Lady Isabel {{hears the}} horn of an elf-knight and wishes she had the horn and the knight [...] "to sleep in my bosom". He {{immediately}} appears and asks {{her to go to}} the greenwood. They ride there, and he tells her that he has killed seven kings daughters there and she is to be the eighth. She suggests that he put his <b>head</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> knee [...] "that we may hae some rest before that I die". She puts him to sleep with a [...] "small charm" [...] and after tying him up with his own belt she kills him with his own dagger.|$|E

60|$|This {{new member}} of the {{household}} was renamed Elizabeth Carvel, though they called her Bess, and of a course she was greatly petted and spoiled, and ruled all those about her. As she grew from childhood to womanhood her beauty became talked about, and afterwards, when Mistress Carvel went to the Assembly, a dozen young sparks would crowd about the door of her coach, and older and more serious men lost their <b>heads</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> account.|$|R
60|$|At {{those words}} the pen dropped from her fingers. <b>Her</b> <b>head</b> nodded <b>on</b> <b>her</b> breast. She roused {{herself with a}} start. Sleep was the enemy she dreaded: sleep brought dreams.|$|R
