User can control camera’s {{functions such as}} pan, tilt, and shutter using hand gesture. The preview of camera and GUIs are shown on a large display. We developed two interaction techniques. First one is a <b>hover</b> <b>button</b> that triggers camera’s shutter. Second one is cross motion interface that controls pan and tilt. In this paper, we explain algorithms in detailed manner and show the preliminary experiment for evaluating speed and accuracy of our implementation. Finally, we discuss promising applications using proposed technique...|$|E
5000|$|Since the Windows 95 Desktop Update, the Quick Launch bar {{featured}} Show desktop {{as one of}} its default shortcuts, which automatically minimizes all opened applications. On Windows 7, {{a dedicated}} Show desktop button was placed {{to the right of the}} notification area. With the [...] "Peek" [...] option enabled, <b>hovering</b> over the <b>button</b> hides all opened windows to expose the desktop (leaving outlines of them on-screen).|$|R
25|$|For all Windows Vista Premium Ready PCs, {{when using}} Alt+Tab to switch between open windows, {{a preview of}} each open window appears instead of just the program icon. In addition, Windows Flip 3D enables users to flip through a {{cascading}} stack of their open windows using the mouse scroll wheel, much like Apple's Cover Flow. Windows can be stacked and rotated in 3D to provide views {{of all of them}} simultaneously. (The keyboard shortcuts are +, which makes Flip 3D disappear after releasing, ++, which keeps Flip 3D visible after releasing, and ++ to flip through open windows backwards). The window buttons on the taskbar show a thumbnail image of the window, when the mouse <b>hovers</b> over the <b>button.</b>|$|R
5000|$|With the {{introduction}} of Google Instant, the functionality of the button behaves differently. Currently, the [...] "I'm Feeling Lucky" [...] button changes based on the user's settings and what webpage users are at. If Google Instant is turned off, the button will work as it previously did or, if the search box is empty, redirect to the Google Doodles gallery. If Google Instant is turned on and a user <b>hovers</b> over the <b>button,</b> the button text will spin and land on a phrase that starts with [...] "I'm feeling" [...] (e.g. [...] "I'm feeling hungry" [...] or [...] "I'm feeling smart"). Each phrase links to a Google page related to the associated phrase.|$|R
25|$|The taskbar {{has seen}} the biggest visual changes, where the old Quick Launch toolbar has been {{replaced}} {{with the ability to}} pin applications to taskbar. Buttons for pinned applications are integrated with the task buttons. These buttons also enable Jump Lists to allow easy access to common tasks. The revamped taskbar also allows the reordering of taskbar buttons. To the far right of the system clock is a small rectangular button that serves as the Show desktop icon. By default, <b>hovering</b> over this <b>button</b> makes all visible windows transparent for {{a quick look at the}} desktop. In touch-enabled displays such as touch screens, tablet PCs, etc., this button is slightly (8 pixels) wider in order to accommodate being pressed by a finger. Clicking this button minimizes all windows, and clicking it a second time restores them.|$|R
