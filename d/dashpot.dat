When a polymeric material is subjected to an abrupt force, the response can be modeled using the Kelvin-Voigt model. In this model, the material is represented by a Hookean spring and a Newtonian <b>dashpot</b> in parallel. The creep strain is given by the following convolution integral: ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>dashpot</b> timer is a fluid time-on-timer {{that can}} be used in {{definite}} time motor acceleration starters and controllers. A <b>dashpot</b> timer is a container, a piston, and a shaft. The <b>dashpot</b> timer functions when a magnetic field forces a piston to move within a cylinder when the coil is energized. The movement of the piston is limited by fluid passing through an orifice on the piston. The amount of fluid passing through the orifice is controlled by a throttle value, which determines the delay. If the fluid used to move the piston is air it is actually known as a pneumatic <b>dashpot.</b> If the fluid is oil, it is known as a hydraulic <b>dashpot.</b> Another kind of <b>dashpot</b> timer is the mercury displacement timer, this model uses mercury to contact electrodes.|$|E
50|$|Two {{common types}} of <b>dashpots</b> exist - linear and rotary. Linear <b>dashpots</b> are {{generally}} specified by stroke (amount of linear displacement) and damping coefficient (force per velocity). Rotary <b>dashpots</b> will have damping coefficients in torque per angular velocity.|$|R
50|$|<b>Dashpots</b> {{are used}} to form models of {{materials}} that exhibit viscoelastic behavior, such as muscle tissue. Maxwell and Kelvin-Voigt models of viscoelasticity use springs and <b>dashpots</b> in series and parallel circuits respectively. Models containing <b>dashpots</b> add a viscous, time dependent, element to the behavior of solids allowing complex behaviors like creep and stress relaxation to be modeled.|$|R

50|$|Most <b>dashpot</b> timers {{are used}} in sequential, {{automatic}} control applications where the completion of one operation causes the start of another process. Common applications include automatic milling machines, periodic lubrication, animated shop-window displays, staged start-up of pumps, automatic presses, and industrial washing machines. <b>Dashpot</b> timers are also used in motors, blowers, lighting, and control valves {{as well as in}} banking, retail, irrigation, and general industrial applications. Common problems with <b>dashpot</b> timers were variations in temperature, the entrance of dirt and other matter into the <b>dashpot</b> system, and general wear and tear of the system.|$|E
50|$|The {{inlet valves}} are pulled open with an eccentric-driven pawl; when the pawl trips, the rapid closure is damped using a <b>dashpot.</b> In many engines, the same <b>dashpot</b> {{acts as a}} vacuum spring to pull the valves closed, but Corliss's early engines were slow enough {{that it was the}} weight of the <b>dashpot</b> piston and rod that closed the valve.|$|E
50|$|Dashpots {{frequently}} use {{a one-way}} mechanical bypass to permit fast unrestricted motion {{in one direction}} and slow motion using the <b>dashpot</b> in the opposite direction. This permits, for example, a door to be opened quickly without added resistance, but then to close slowly using the <b>dashpot.</b> For hydraulic dashpots this unrestricted motion is accomplished using a one-way check-valve that allows fluid to bypass the <b>dashpot</b> fluid constriction. Non-hydraulic dashpots may use a ratcheting gear to permit free motion in one direction.|$|E
40|$|A matrix {{formulation}} {{to study}} the coupled response of rigid foundations modelled by springs and <b>dashpots</b> is presented. Springs and <b>dashpots</b> orientation can be any possible, thus a general solution is determined. Response in terms of displacements and rotations is determined from a matrix system in the complex field. The physics of the problem presented here has been extensively studied and {{a broad range of}} useful formulas to determine springs and <b>dashpots</b> properties in soil–structure interaction is available, however it has also been identified that there are some limitations on coupling various degrees of freedom in the available formulations. Then, the novelty of the approach presented comes from the matrix manipulation that leads to an expression that provides a closer approximation to the real phenomenon, because all degrees of freedom can be coupled. This approach may allow to the analyst finding a coupled response including the cases when either springs or <b>dashpots</b> are not orthogonally oriented. In an example {{at the end of this}} study, the influence of one of the involved parameters in the soil–structure analysis is pointed out...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Founded on {{the energy}} storing {{characteristics}} of microstructure during irreversible deformation, a viscoplastic constitutive model with no yielding surface introduced was developed for single crystals by adopting a spring-dashpot mechanical system. Both plastic <b>dashpots</b> reflecting the material time-independent responses and Newtonian <b>dashpots</b> mirroring the material time-dependent viscous responses were introduced to describe the viscoplasticity of slip systems. The single crystal constitutive model was established based on the thermodynamics of internal variables and the theory of absolute reaction rate. By implementing the KBW self-consistent theory, a polycrystal viscoplastic constitutive model was formed. The numerical analysis in corresponding algorithm was significantly simplified as no searching process for the activation of the slip systems and slip directions was required. The numerical simulation of creep-plasticity behaviors demonstrated excellent agreement with the corresponding experimental data...|$|R
