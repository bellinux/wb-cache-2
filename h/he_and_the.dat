5|$|A {{formidable}} French squadron {{under the}} command of Rear-Admiral Charles-Alexandre Léon Durand Linois had left Toulon bound for Cadiz to collect reinforcements for Napoleon's army in Egypt. On 3July they sighted and chased Speedy, and Cochrane ordered the guns, boats, and provisions thrown overboard to lighten the ship. The French caught up nonetheless, and after narrowly avoiding the broadside of Desaix, Cochrane struck his colours. He was taken aboard Desaix, where her captain, Christy-Pallière, recognised Cochrane's accomplishments by refusing to accept his sword. Cochrane was taken along with the fleet and watched the Battle of Algeciras Bay from Desaix. <b>He</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> crew of Speedy were later exchanged after the battle. On returning to Gibraltar he was court-martialled for the loss of his ship, and honourably acquitted.|$|E

5|$|According to the city's {{metropolitan}} bishop, Symeon (in office 1416/17–1429), both <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Despot Andronikos sent repeated {{pleas for}} aid to Constantinople, but the imperial government was short {{of resources and}} preoccupied with its own problems. At long last, a single unnamed commander {{was sent to the}} city, but he brought neither men nor money with him. The commander proposed setting up a common fund of the citizens to support the defence, but this proposal met with vehement opposition, particularly from the wealthy aristocrats, who would naturally have born the brunt of the cost. The common people however also proved unwilling to contribute, and rioted in favour of an accommodation with the Ottomans, when the news spread that they had offered a peaceful settlement, provided that the Despot Andronikos left the city.|$|E

While visiting her daughter, in summer 1988, she developed pneumonia {{and spent most of}} the autumn and winter bedridden. Finally, she called Otto, in early March 1989, and told him she was dying. <b>He</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> rest of the family travelled to her bedside and took turns keeping her company until she died {{in the early hours of}} 14 March 1989. She was 96 years old, and was the last surviving child of Robert, Duke of Parma from both his marriages.|$|E
5|$|After he {{was told}} that the Dutch had {{followed}} him, Tiku ordered most of his followers to return to Tondon while he and a group of fifteen, including his two wives, continued south. They first arrived at Ambeso, but the fortress fell several days later, at which time they evacuated to Alla'. This fortress fell at the end of March 1907 and Tiku began to work his way back to Tondon through the forest. <b>He</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> other leaders, Buginese and Torajan alike, were chased by Dutch troops. The other leaders capitulated to the Dutch and were sentenced to either three years in a prison in Makassar or exile to Buton. Tiku, meanwhile, stayed hidden in the forests.|$|E

5|$|After the {{departure}} of Bligh's launch, Christian turned Bounty eastward {{in search of a}} remote haven on which <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> mutineers could settle. He had in mind the island of Tubuai, 300miles south of Tahiti, partly mapped by Cook. Christian intended to pick up women, male servants and livestock from Tahiti, to help establish the settlement. As Bounty sailed slowly towards Tubuai, Bligh's launch, overcoming many dangers and hardships, made its way steadily towards civilisation and reached Coupang (now Kupang), on Timor, on 14 June 1789. Here Bligh gave his first report of the mutiny, while awaiting a ship to take him back to England.|$|E

5|$|Alex Weldon {{was hired}} to be {{supervisor}} of special effects for the film. Weldon was planning on retiring after 42years of effects work, but his wife urged him to take on Star Trek because she thought {{he did not have}} enough to do. When Weldon was hired, many of the effects had already been started or completed by Rugg; it was up to Weldon to complete more complex and higher-budgeted effects for the motion picture. The first step of preparation involved analyzing the script in the number, duration, and type of effects. Before costs could be determined and Weldon could shop for necessary items, <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> other members of the special effects team worked out all possibilities for pulling off the effects in a convincing manner.|$|E

5|$|Although Lenin was {{influenced}} by agrarian-socialist Pëtr Tkachëvi, <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Social-Democrats clashed with the Socialist–Revolutionary Party (SR), who were inspired by the defunct People's Freedom Party. Advocating a Narodnik agrarian-socialist platform, the SR emphasised the revolutionary role of the peasant, who in 1881 numbered 75 million, {{in contrast to the}} 1 million urban proletariat in Russia. In contrast, the Marxists believed that the peasant class' primary motivation was to own their land, and that they were capitalists; instead, they saw the proletariat as the revolutionary force to advance socialism.|$|E

This infuriates the Bunnokee medicine man, whose feather headdress business has declined as a result. <b>He</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Chief of the Bunnokees conspire to eradicate the economic threat, launching war against Popol.
