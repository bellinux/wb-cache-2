25|$|When {{the angels}} heard Lilith's words, they insisted she go back. But she swore {{to them by}} the name of the living and eternal God: 'Whenever <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> or your names or your forms in an amulet, I will have no power over that infant.' She also agreed to have one hundred of her {{children}} die every day. Accordingly, every day one hundred demons perish, and for the same reason, we write the angels' names on the amulets of young children. When Lilith sees their names, she remembers her oath, and the child recovers.|$|E

500|$|About five {{ambulances}} reached Pearl Roundabout, {{where they}} were confronted by police and army forces; three drivers and nine paramedics were attacked. One of the injured drivers claimed that police had clubbed him and that a senior officer had told him: [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> again, I’ll kill you." [...] Another ambulance driver, who was unharmed, said that police removed injured protesters from his vehicle by force and a military officer– whom he {{believed to be a}} Saudi, based on his Arabic dialect– held a gun to his head and warned him to drive away or be shot. One ambulance was reportedly confiscated by police, who then took it to an unknown location after beating its driver and other paramedics, who had to walk back to the SMC.|$|E
500|$|... "Slim Slow Slider" [...] is {{the only}} song on the album to not have string overdubs and {{according}} to John Payne, Morrison had not played it live before. [...] Like [...] in the song [...] "T.B. Sheets", the singer tells of watching a young girl die, but in [...] "Slim Slow Slider" [...] the girl seems bent on her own self-destruction: [...] "I know you're dying, baby/I know you know it too." [...] The song ends abruptly with the words, [...] "Every time <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>you,</b> I just don't know what to do."

500|$|The episode's director, Mark Kirkland, said {{he enjoyed}} {{directing}} the episode because the characters' emotions throughout it are [...] "very human and real". He believed many viewers watching the episode would recognize the emotions from experiences {{in their own}} lives, and would feel sympathy for the characters. The idea of Homer annoying {{the people at the}} movie theater was based on an experience Groening had with a friend of his when he was younger. They were sitting by themselves in a movie theater and two [...] "annoying" [...] women sat down right in front of them. Groening's friend told the women to move and they did. One of the women then turned to Groening and his friend and said, [...] "Now are you satisfied?", to which Groening's friend replied: [...] "I won't be satisfied until <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> burn in hell." ...|$|E
500|$|The same {{search for}} direct intuition and {{understanding}} {{can be seen}} with Vivekananda. Not satisfied with his knowledge of philosophy, Narendra came to [...] "the question which marked the real beginning of his intellectual quest for God." [...] He asked several prominent Calcutta residents if they had come [...] "face to face with God", but none of their answers satisfied him. At this time, Narendra met Debendranath Tagore (the leader of Brahmo Samaj) {{and asked if he}} had seen God. Instead of answering his question, Tagore said [...] "My boy, you have the Yogis eyes." [...] According to Banhatti, it was Ramakrishna who really answered Narendra's question, by saying [...] "Yes, I see Him as <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>you,</b> only in an infinitely intenser sense." [...] Nevertheless, Vivekananda was more influenced by the Brahmo Samaj's and its new ideas, than by Ramakrishna. It was Sen's influence who brought Vivekananda fully into contact with western esotericism, and it was also via Sen that he met Ramakrishna.|$|E
500|$|Roshan was {{not seen}} on screen again until 2006, with three new releases, {{including}} a cameo {{at the end}} of the year in the romance <b>I</b> <b>See</b> <b>You.</b> He co-starred with Naseeruddin Shah and Priyanka Chopra in his father's superhero production Krrish. A follow-up to his family's production Koi... Mil Gaya, it saw him play dual roles—the title superhero and his character from the original film. Before production, Roshan traveled to China to train with Tony Ching for the cable work that would be needed to make his character fly. He sustained several injuries during production. For example, he tore the hamstring in his right leg and broke his thumb and toe. Krrish was a box office success and became the second-highest-grossing Bollywood film of 2006 with a worldwide revenue of [...] It garnered him Best Actor awards at the 2007 Screen and the International Indian Film Academy Awards. Ronnie Scheib of Variety considered Roshan a prime asset of the film, noting that he [...] "pulls off the pic's wilder absurdities with considerable panache".|$|E

500|$|... "Reunion" [...] is a noirish ballad that {{features}} reactive emotions by the narrators. Smith approached its recording {{as he would}} remixing a song, working with a demo of bass, guitar, and vocal parts at his own studio and incorporating house and techno elements. Midway, [...] "Reunion" [...] develops a refrain of [...] "did <b>I</b> ... <b>see</b> <b>you</b> ... see me ... in a new light?", and pulsating steel drums lead to a somber, rhythmic dance section. Its pulsating beat transitions into [...] "Sunset", a song about the pain shared by estranged ex-lovers. The song's muted beat adds tension to the narrative, which Calvert interprets to be [...] "the couple's final farewell – the beat serves to denote the passing of time." [...] "Sunset" [...] also has a subtle UK garage beat, funky house elements, and {{was inspired by the}} music from Smith's DJing gigs; Croft cited it as [...] "an example of the idea of a kind of song we're all really into, which is heartbreaking dance music". Consequence of Sound's Harley Brown views that [...] "Reunion" [...] and [...] "Sunset" [...] make up a congruous mix at [...] "the heart of the album", as Smith [...] "indie-streams these house varieties ... slowing down and alienating beats from their context so they’re even more universal, unobscured by their dance floor origins.|$|E
500|$|Cherry {{offered the}} role of Bree Van de Kamp, a [...] "perfect homemaker" [...] {{reminiscent}} of The Stepford Wives, to Dana Delany three times. Delany rejected the role, as it was too similar to her character on Pasadena, but would later join the series in its fourth season as Katherine Mayfair. Marcia Cross was later cast as Bree. Roma Downey, Jeri Ryan, and Stacey Travis were also considered for the role, while Nicollette Sheridan auditioned for the part and was cast as neighborhood tramp Edie Britt instead. On her audition, Sheridan recalled, [...] "At {{the end of the}} reading, the director looked at me and said, 'No, no, <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> as Edie.' I said, 'Oh, I see, I come in a housewife and mother of two and leave the slut.'" [...] The Edie character was originally intended to be a small role, but it was expanded once Sheridan was cast. Felicity Huffman was cast as Lynette Scavo, a frustrated stay-at-home mother of four, after talking about her own experiences as a mother during her audition. Cherry called Huffman's casting [...] "very lucky," [...] commenting that [...] "within fifteen minutes she had the part." [...] Alex Kingston read for {{the role of}} Lynette, and has since alleged that she was denied the role for being too heavy. The role of series narrator Mary Alice Young was given to Sheryl Lee. Cross originally auditioned for the role before being cast as Bree instead. Jeanne Tripplehorn and Heather Locklear also auditioned for leading roles.|$|E

2500|$|Rampal {{established}} his own production company Chasing Ganesha Films {{with his wife}} Mehr Jesia. The first movie under that banner <b>I</b> <b>See</b> <b>You</b> was Rampal's last release of 2006. He played a lead role opposite newcomer Vipasha Agarwal. The movie was shot entirely in London, England. Like his past movies, <b>I</b> <b>See</b> <b>You</b> was also a failure {{at the box office}} and received poor reviews. However, Rampal earned critical acclaim for his work. Taran Adarsh wrote: [...] "I See You rests on Arjun's shoulders. Arjun is efficient in a role that doesn't really demand histrionics. He has proved his credentials in the past and his performance in this film is at par with his earlier works. He works best in the dramatic portions." ...|$|E

In addition to recording, she also made her feature-film debut in Hard Country, although she did have small roles in Jeremiah Johnson (1972) and the television miniseries The Rebels (1979).|$|E
