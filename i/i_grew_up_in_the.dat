2500|$|When {{asked about}} his {{motivation}}s, Ringer responded [...] "Honestly, my number-one motivation is my family". While talking about his attitude and upbringing, Ringer mentioned, [...] "A lot of that just comes from my upbringing. I have a tremendous mother and father, <b>I</b> <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> church, I have a very religious family. I’m not all about myself just because I know if it wasn’t for God, I wouldn’t {{be able to go}} out there and compete anyway. So I never look at it as a selfish thing—I never want all the attention or want it to be about me, because I never want to get in to a situation where God has to humble me. I know for a fact that I am not doing it by myself; it is because of Him that I can compete over and over again. That’s basically how I grew up. I was blessed and fortunate to have a family like I have." ...|$|E

He had no children, and received me into his family as his own child, treating me with the kindness and affection of a father; and <b>I</b> <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> belief that he really was such. A few years afterward, his wife {{gave birth to a}} daughter, but his tenderness toward me continued undiminished. I thus grew up with Xarisa, for so the infant daughter of the Alcayde was called, as her own brother, and thought the growing passion which I felt for her, was mere fraternal affection. I beheld her charms unfolding, as it were, leaf by leaf, like the morning rose, each moment disclosing fresh beauty and sweetness.|$|E

Body and soul I am sick for the want of God and the knowledge of God. I {{did not know what}} was the matter with me, why my life had become so disordered and confused that my very appetites and habits are all astray. But I am perishing for God as a waterless man upon a raft perishes for drink, and there is nothing but madness if I touch the seas about me. Not only in my thoughts but in my under thoughts and in my nerves and bones and arteries I have need of God. You see <b>I</b> <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> delusion that I knew God, I did not know that I was unprovisioned and unprovided against the tests and strains and hardships of life. I thought that I was secure and safe. I was told that we men--who were apes not {{a quarter of a million}} years ago, who still have hair upon our arms and ape's teeth in our jaws--had come to the full and perfect knowledge of God. It was all put into a creed. Not a word of it was to be altered, not a sentence was to be doubted any more. They made me a teacher of this creed. They seemed to explain it to me. And when I came to look into it, when my need came and I turned to my creed, it was old and shrivelled up, it was the patched-up speculations of vanished Greeks and Egyptians, it was a mummy of ancient disputes, old and dry, that fell to dust as I unwrapped it. And I was dressed up in the dress of old dead times and put before an altar of forgotten sacrifices, and I went through ceremonies as old as the first seedtime; and suddenly I knew clearly that God was not there, God was not in my Creed, not in my cathedral, not in my ceremonies, nowhere in my life. And at the same time I knew, I knew as I had never known before, that certainly there was God." ...|$|E
