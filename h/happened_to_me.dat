5|$|As I {{look back}} on it today, I see the whole picture very differently. It's true that I hated missing out on Sexton. And the first few months, I was miserable at Everett. But being bused to Everett {{turned out to be one}} of the best things that ever <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> It got me out of my own little world and taught me how to {{understand}} white people, how to communicate and deal with them.|$|E
5|$|After the war, of course, {{the roads}} were all bad. There were cobbles from the moment you left Paris, or Senlis where we started in those days. There'd be {{stretches}} of surfaced roads and often there'd be a cycle path or a pavement and sometimes a thin stretch of something smoother. But you never knew where was best to ride and you were for ever switching about. You could jump your bike up on to a pavement but that got harder the more tired you got. Then you'd get your front wheel up but not your back wheel. That <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> And then you'd go sprawling, of course, and you could bring other riders down. Or they'd fall off and bring you down with them. And the cycle paths were often just compressed cinders, which got soft {{in the rain and}} got churned up by so many riders using them and then you got stuck and you lost your balance. And come what may, you got covered in coal dust and other muck. No, it's all changed and you can't compare then and now.|$|E

I got to choose the music, but this time around it was, like, I'd sit down and think: 'What <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> yesterday? What <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> today?' and just write. It was very therapeutic, in a way. And easy – I was shocked at {{how easy it was}} to be honest about {{yourself}} and things that affect you. It is a dance record, but I wanted it to be serious. I wanted to talk about serious things, but do it in a not-so-serious way, with music that makes you want to get up and dance.|$|E

Yates describes Salinger as [...] "a man who used language as if it were pure energy beautifully controlled, and who {{knew exactly what he was}} doing in every silence as well as in every word." [...] Gordon Lish's O.

500|$|Author Patrick Croskery {{described}} Animals as {{a unique}} blend of the [...] "powerful sounds and suggestive themes" [...] of Dark Side with The Wall portrayal of artistic alienation. He drew a parallel between the album's political themes and that of Orwell's Animal Farm. Animals begins with a thought experiment, which asks: [...] "If you didn't care what <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> And I didn't care for you", then develops a beast fable based on anthropomorphised characters using music to reflect the individual states of mind of each. The lyrics ultimately {{paint a picture of}} dystopia, the inevitable result of a world devoid of empathy and compassion, answering the question posed in the opening lines.|$|E

[...] He has put his addiction problems down to [...] "boredom". He also said that [...] "I'm {{not one of these}} people who can have one drink and stop. I want another and another and another." [...] His drink problems began after he developed a gambling habit in 2007. His addiction to betting on horse racing cost him £3,000 a month, and left him asking friends and family for money.|$|E

500|$|In early February {{the marquis}} arrived back unannounced {{at his house}} in Rio de Janeiro, much to the {{surprise}} of his wife. The Viscount of Inhaúma also returned home shortly afterwards, but with his health so compromised that he died a few weeks later. Upon learning of Inhaúma's death, Caxias said: [...] "and the same would have had <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> had I not resolved {{to get out of that}} hell." [...] PedroII was greatly disappointed in Caxias, but he was also very aware that the marquis was the person most responsible for the great successes during the war, accomplishments that had come at the cost of years of sacrifice and personal bravery. The Emperor called the marquis to the Imperial Palace, the Paço de São Cristóvão, on 21 February 1869 for a reconciliation.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Just Like Heaven" [...] was {{directed}} by Tim Pope, who had directed all of the band's previous videos since 1982's [...] "Let's Go to Bed". The video was filmed in England's Pinewood Studios in October 1987. Set on a cliff overlooking a sea, the video recreates many of the memories detailed in the song's lyrics. When a fanzine asked Smith what the song was about, {{he said it was}} inspired by [...] "something that <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> a long time ago—see the video!" [...] While Smith had claimed for years that the video was shot at the same place that inspired the song, he later admitted that the bulk of it was filmed in a studio, utilising footage of the water and cliffs of Beachy Head taken for the band's 1985 video for [...] "Close to Me".|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} played only once and {{received}} minor treatments afterwards, {{with the addition}} of a cello part in the introduction and some editing, which included removing a verse to reduce the song's length. Eno was outraged that U2 wanted to shorten the song, and he was adamant that the band not alter the original track too much, saying, [...] "These fucking guys, they're supposed to be so spiritual—they don't spot a miracle when it hits them in the face. Nothing like that ever <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> in the studio in my whole life." [...] The band's original concept for No Line on the Horizon was to create an album of future hymns—songs that would be played forever. According to Eno and Lanois, [...] "Moment of Surrender" [...] is the closest the band came to reaching that concept.|$|E

[...] Love asked Bjelland to start a band with her as a guitarist, and the two moved to San Francisco in June 1985, where they {{recruited}} bassist Jennifer Finch and drummer Janis Tanaka. According to Bjelland, [...] " [...] didn't play an instrument at the time" [...] aside from keyboards, so Bjelland would transcribe Love's musical ideas on guitar for her. The group played several house shows and recorded one 4-track demo before disbanding in late 1985. After Pagan Babies, Love moved to Minneapolis, where Bjelland had formed the group Babes in Toyland, and briefly worked as a concert promoter before returning to California.|$|E
