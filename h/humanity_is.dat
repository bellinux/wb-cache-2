5|$|The Bahá'í {{writings}} {{emphasize the}} essential equality of human beings, and {{the abolition of}} prejudice. <b>Humanity</b> <b>is</b> seen as essentially one, though highly varied; its diversity of race and culture are seen as worthy of appreciation and acceptance. Doctrines of racism, nationalism, caste, social class, and gender-based hierarchy are seen as artificial impediments to unity. The Bahá'í teachings state that the unification of <b>humanity</b> <b>is</b> the paramount issue in the religious and political conditions of the present world.|$|E

5|$|The poem {{discusses}} {{time and}} disorder within nature {{that is the}} result of humanity following only science and not the divine. Leaders are described as materialistic and unable to understand reality. The only way for mankind to find salvation is through pursuing the divine by looking inwards and realizing that <b>humanity</b> <b>is</b> interconnected.

5|$|Christologically Maximus {{insisted on}} a strict dyophysitism, which {{can be seen as}} a {{corollary}} of the emphasis on theosis. In terms of salvation, <b>humanity</b> <b>is</b> intended to be fully united with God. This is possible for Maximus because God was first fully united with humanity in the incarnation. If Christ did not become fully human (if, for example, he only had a divine and not a human will), then salvation was no longer possible, as humanity could not become fully divine.|$|E
5|$|Even in {{the absence}} of close contact between {{humanity}} and extraterrestrials, high-information messages from an extraterrestrial civilization to humanity have the potential to cause a great cultural shock. Sociologist Donald Tarter has conjectured that knowledge of extraterrestrial culture and theology has the potential to compromise human allegiance to existing organizational structures and institutions. The cultural shock of meeting an extraterrestrial civilization may be spread over decades or even centuries if an extraterrestrial message to <b>humanity</b> <b>is</b> extremely difficult to decipher.|$|E

5|$|Michael Weyland's {{ambiguous}} <b>humanity</b> <b>is</b> {{a subject}} of debate for viewers and critics, and speculation exists {{that he is an}} android more sophisticated than Bishop. In Cinema of Simulation: Hyperreal Hollywood in the Long 1990s, Randy Laist interprets this ambiguity as indicative of a theme of the Alien franchise: what matters is a character's actions, not its species. Michael Weyland is a duplicitous character, and it is irrelevant whether he is a human or an android.|$|E
5|$|The {{ending of}} Redemption varies {{depending}} upon on {{the quantity of}} humanity Christof has retained during the game. If the quantity is great, Christof reconciles with Anezka and turns her into a vampire, sparing her from death. If his <b>humanity</b> <b>is</b> moderate, he surrenders to Vukodlak and becomes a ghoul; Vukodlak betrays Christof and forces him to murder Anezka. A lesser quantity of humanity results in Christof killing Vukodlak by drinking his blood. Greatly empowered, Christof forsakes his humanity, murders Anezka, and revels in his new power.|$|E

5|$|The {{potential}} {{changes from}} extraterrestrial contact could vary greatly in magnitude and type, {{based on the}} extraterrestrial civilization's level of technological advancement, degree of benevolence or malevolence, and level of mutual comprehension between itself and humanity.

The Shogun writes an unequal contract with aliens which allows the aliens to enter the country and places a ban on carrying swords in public.

5|$|John Calvin, a sixteenth-century French theologian and {{principal}} {{figure in the}} development of Calvinism, was influenced by Augustine's works. Unlike Augustine, Calvin was willing to accept that God is responsible for evil and suffering; however, he maintained that God cannot be indicted for it. Calvin continued the Augustinian approach that sin {{is the result of the}} fall of man, and argued that the human mind, will, and affections are corrupted by sin. He believed that only the grace of God is sufficient to provide humans with ongoing ethical guidance, arguing that reason is blinded by humans' sinful nature. Calvin proposed that <b>humanity</b> <b>is</b> predestined, divided into the elect and the reprobate: the elect are those who God has chosen to save and are the only ones who will be saved.|$|E

5|$|Raëlians {{believe that}} {{humanity}} {{would be able}} to create life on other planets only if <b>humanity</b> <b>is</b> peaceful enough to stop war. In that case, humanity could travel the distances between stars and create life on another planet. Progress in terraforming, molecular biology, and cloning would enable these teams to create continents and life from scratch. Progress in social engineering would ensure that this creation would {{have a better chance of}} both surviving and having the potential to understand its creators. Research on how civilization would occur on another planet would allow scientists to decide what traces of their origin should be left behind so that their role in life creation would someday be revealed. The progress achieved by the science teams would ultimately sustain a perpetual chain of life.|$|E
5|$|Rewrite story {{revolves}} around the protagonist Kotarou Tennouji, a male high school student living in Kazamatsuri, and the story begins on October 3, 2010 on the Moon.

The club members spend fun, peaceful times together uncovering the supernatural mysteries of Kazamatsuri. During this time, Kotarou falls in love with each of them in separate plot lines determined by the choices the player makes. These plot lines represent various timelines in which the conflict between Gaia and Guardian occurs, although it is hinted that <b>humanity</b> <b>is</b> inevitably destroyed in every timeline.|$|E

5|$|The Puppet Master {{explains}} to Kusanagi {{that he was}} created by Section 6. While wandering various networks, he became sentient and began to contemplate his existence. Deciding the essence of <b>humanity</b> <b>is</b> reproduction and mortality, he wants to exist within a physical brain that will eventually die. As he could not escape Section 6's network, he had to download himself into a cybernetic body. Having interacted with Kusanagi (without her knowledge), he believes she is also questioning her humanity, {{and they have a}} lot in common. He proposes merging their ghosts, in return, Kusanagi would gain all of his capabilities. Kusanagi agrees to the merge.|$|E
5|$|The main {{character}} of Redemption is French crusader Christof Romuald, a once-proud, religious church knight who {{is transformed into}} a Brujah vampire. With his religious faith destroyed, Christof is forced to reassess his understanding of good and evil as he acclimates to his new life. Christof's anchor to <b>humanity</b> <b>is</b> the nun Anezka, a human with a pure soul who loves Chrisof even after his transformation. As a member of the Brujah under Ecaterina the Wise, Christof allies with Wilhem Streicher, the Gangrel Erik, and the Cappadocian Serena during his journeys through 12th century Prague. Other characters in this era include the slaver Count Orsi, the Tremere Etrius, and the Ventrue Prince Brandl.|$|E
5|$|Feeling {{the need}} to seek out truth creates a {{separation}} between {{the mind of a}} poet and the mind of a philosopher. The poem reconciles the two by allowing the pursuer of truth to reflect on his time of simply enjoying nature and God's presence. However, the philosopher aspect is dominant and the individual must {{go out and try to}} help humanity. Nature can be soothing, but the narrator must reject the Edenic quality of nature because such a state is not yet appropriate. The Edenic imagery figures into many of Coleridge's poems and is reinforced with the image of myrtle trees and takes on many forms within his poetry. In Reflections, to dwell in an Edenic state is a paradise in which the narrator leaves voluntarily because he cannot ignore the problems of the world like a coward. Instead, the individual is compelled to join with humanity and even the lowest form of benefiting <b>humanity</b> <b>is</b> superior to doing nothing at all.|$|E
