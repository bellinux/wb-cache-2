5|$|A third, more {{graphical}} way {{of describing}} a 2-satisfiability instance is as an <b>implication</b> graph. An <b>implication</b> graph is a directed graph {{in which there}} is one vertex per variable or negated variable, and an edge connecting one vertex to another whenever the corresponding variables are related by an <b>implication</b> in the implicative normal form of the instance. An <b>implication</b> graph must be a skew-symmetric graph, meaning that it has a symmetry that takes each variable to its negation and reverses the orientations of all of the edges.|$|E

This knowledge representation is especially useful {{when it is}} not possible to list all specified objects. Attribute exploration is a tool of formal concept analysis that supports the acquisition of this knowledge. For a specified context this interactive procedure determines a miminal list of valid <b>implications</b> between attributes of this context together with a list of objects which are counterexamples for all <b>implications</b> not valid in the context. This paper describes how the exploration can be modified such that it determines a mimimal set of <b>implications</b> that fills the gap between previously given <b>implications</b> (called background <b>implications)</b> and all valid <b>implications.</b> The list of <b>implications</b> can be simplified further if exceptions are allowed for the <b>implications...</b>|$|R

5|$|Instances of the 2-satisfiability problem are {{typically}} expressed as Boolean formulas {{of a special}} type, called conjunctive normal form (2-CNF) or Krom formulas. Alternatively, they may be expressed as a special type of directed graph, the <b>implication</b> graph, which expresses the variables of an instance and their negations as vertices in a graph, and constraints on pairs of variables as directed edges. Both {{of these kinds of}} inputs may be solved in linear time, either by a method based on backtracking or by using the strongly connected components of the <b>implication</b> graph.|$|E

40|$|Recently, Vemuri and Jayaram (2012) have {{proposed}} a novel generating method of fuzzy <b>implications,</b> called the ⊛⊛-composition. Further, they have also proposed Mutual Exchangeability (ME), a generalization of the Exchange Principle (EP) {{to a pair of}} fuzzy <b>implications</b> and have shown that (ME) plays {{a central role in the}} preservation of basic properties, functional equations and families of fuzzy <b>implications</b> w. r. t. the ⊛⊛-composition (Vemuri and Jayaram, 2014). Due to the important role played by (ME), in this work, we investigate the pairs (I,J) (I,J) of fuzzy <b>implications</b> that satisfy (ME). Towards this, we show first that there exist pairs (I,J) (I,J) of fuzzy <b>implications</b> that satisfy (ME) and determine some necessary conditions on such fuzzy <b>implications.</b> Following this, for a given I∈II∈I, we find the set JIJI of all fuzzy <b>implications</b> J such that the pair (I,J) (I,J) satisfies (ME). Keeping in view the variety of fuzzy <b>implications</b> and the complexity of the functional equation (ME), we restrict our investigations to four important families of fuzzy <b>implications,</b> namely, (S,N) (S,N) -, R-, f- and g -implications. Further, we discuss a generalization of the Cauchy multiplicative equation, whose solutions help us in obtaining the set JIJI for some families of fuzzy <b>implications...</b>|$|R

5|$|As it was, Heilmann's {{conclusion}} was so persuasive that it forestalled further {{debate on the}} subject {{even in the face}} of additional conflicting evidence. In 1936, paleontologist Charles Lewis Camp described a new theropod from the Jurassic of North America, Segisaurus. Like Oviraptor, Segisaurus had an unmistakable clavicle, but unlike Oviraptor, it was also plainly identified as being such in the paper that described it. Despite this, the <b>implication</b> of a wishbone-bearing dinosaur was blatantly ignored until much later, and for many years the state of dinosaur research stagnated, possibly due to the effects of the Depression and World War II.|$|E

Whether he expects his audience to believe him varies from version to version; in Raspe's original 1785 text, he simply narrates his stories without further comment, but in the later extended versions he is insistent that he is telling the truth.

Another suggestion is that the heaviness was caused by the weight of fully armoured hoplite marines. The Allies may have had extra marines on board if their ships were less maneuverable, since boarding would then be the main tactic available to them (at the cost of making the ships even heavier). Indeed, Herodotus refers to the Greeks capturing ships, rather than sinking them.|$|E
