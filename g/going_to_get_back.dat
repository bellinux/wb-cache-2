500|$|Risk, {{released}} in August 1999, {{was a critical}} and commercial failure and led to backlash from many longtime fans. Although its two predecessors incorporated rock elements alongside a more traditional heavy metal sound, Risk was virtually devoid of metal. About the band's musical direction, Dave Mustaine said: [...] "We hit the nadir of our career with Risk, and I vowed after that we were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> to our roots. It took {{a little bit of}} time to do that." [...] Despite this, Risk was certified gold in the United States. The album's lead single, [...] "Crush 'Em", appeared on the soundtrack for [...] and was used as an entrance theme for NHL hockey games and professional wrestling events.|$|E

[...] "In the summer, we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> and start a new record. We want to bring out a record nearly every year, every year and a half," [...] Niall Horan said, revealing they were arranging [...] "meetings and stuff with different writers and producers."

I won't feature on the tracks though".|$|E

The trio had collaboratively helmed One Direction's previous hits, [...] "What Makes You Beautiful" [...] and [...] "One Thing". In early 2012, the group confirmed a follow-up release for their debut album, Up All Night (2011), was in development.

We want to bring out a record nearly every year, every year and a half," [...] member Niall Horan said, revealing they were arranging [...] "meetings and stuff with different writers and producers."

500|$|In 2010, Jacqui {{embarked}} on a [...] "surprise" [...] relationship with Rhys Ashworth (Andrew Moss). Moss first hinted at their romance months prior stating: [...] "I think Rhys is going {{to fall in love}} again. It's a character already in the village. It's quite surprising. It's a character who's been here for a while." [...] The relationship proved popular with viewers; during an interview with Digital Spy, Cooper spoke of her original lack of optimism towards the pairing, stating: [...] "When the relationship first started, we didn't know how they were going to gel and how it was going to work, because people were such fans of Jacqui and Tony. Some people still ask me if those two are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> together, but people are really taken with Rhys and Jacqui." [...] Cooper believes it's her own working relationship with Moss that helps make the pairing a success stating: [...] "It's a nice collaboration and we try to make it funny, emotional, hard-hitting, three-dimensional and as interesting for the audience as possible." [...] She also adopted a [...] "couple name" [...] for the pair titled [...] "Ja-Rhys".|$|E
500|$|In November 2014, Disney Animation {{commenced}} a 16-month upgrade of the Roy E. Disney Animation Building, {{in order}} to fix what Catmull had called its [...] "dungeon-like" [...] interior. For example, the interior was so cramped {{that it could not}} easily accommodate [...] "town hall" [...] meetings with all employees in attendance. [...] Disney did not disclose the renovation's cost, but Lasseter revealed that [...] "he whole center of the second floor will have an atrium that will go up two stories we want to make this building so beautiful that it's worthy of the artistic talent that's there." [...] In addition, it was revealed that the large sorcerer's hat would become the building's main entrance. Lasseter stated, [...] "There will be a gorgeous stairway that goes up into the hat, it's a really great symbol like you're entering the building through the magic of Mickey Mouse's hat." [...] Due to the renovation, the studio's employees were temporarily moved from Burbank into the closest available Disney-controlled studio space– the DisneyToon Studios building in the industrial park in Glendale and the old Imagineering warehouse in North Hollywood under the western approach to Bob Hope Airport (the Tujunga Building). Director Don Hall analogized the studio's relocation to the end of The Empire Strikes Back, where [...] "you know they're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> together." [...] The renovation was completed in October 2016.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Hetty. [...] "Larry {{never did}} {{anything}} mean in his life. But you don't understand, Flo. He didn't know it was there, and it might have dropped out on the prairie, while, even if he found it, how is he <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it <b>back</b> <b>to</b> me?

2500|$|Alistair Cooke wrote, [...] "He [...] had {{one last}} hour of glory. He offered {{to fly to}} Korea and {{entertain}} the troops hemmed in on the United Nations precarious August bridgehead. The troops yelled for his appearance. He went down on his knee again and sang 'Mammy', and the troops wept and cheered. When he was asked what Korea was like he warmly answered, 'I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> my income tax returns and see if I paid enough.'" [...] Jack Benny, who went to Korea the following year, noted that an amphitheater in Korea where troops were entertained, was named the [...] "Al Jolson Bowl." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It isn't my secret," [...] she answered, [...] "and besides, it's a {{dangerous}} one. Whoever has the paper which was stolen through my carelessness, and which I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> try and <b>get</b> <b>back,</b> goes every moment {{in danger of}} his life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, then, you'd {{better get}} out and go home," [...] said Scott. [...] "I don't so much mind their taking us to Savannah, for they can't make us pay if we haven't any money.

5000|$|In 1940, {{he enlisted}} in the United States Marine Corps, {{spending}} four years overseas during World War II. [...] Wistert later recalled that he was often confused with his brother Al Wistert who played both college and professional football. In 1982, he told an interviewer that an officer approached him in 1944, [...] "shook my hand and said 'I saw you play in Philly and at Michigan.'" [...] When Wistert explained {{that it was his}} younger brother Albert who had played football, the officer [...] "wiped off his handshake, turned on his heels and walked away."

6000|$|There was {{a little}} hum of approbation, and a man stood up. [...] "I guess that's the platform," [...] he said.

6000|$|From The Children's Record.

I thought I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> home, now, but that [...] was an error.

6000|$|I {{came near}} letting this go without telling you of one curious {{incident}} {{of the affair}} between the captain and his men. Before the men returned to the ship they came with their spokesman {{to say good-bye to}} Aristides and me, and he remarked casually that it was just as well, maybe, to be going back, because, for one thing, they would know then whether it was real or not. I asked him what he meant, and he said, [...] "Well, you know, some of the mates think it's a dream here, or it's {{too good to be true}}. As far forth as I go, I'd be willing to have it a dream that I didn't ever have to wake up from. It ain't any too good to be true for me. Anyway, I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> somehow, and give it another chance to be a fact." [...] Wasn't that charming? It had a real touch of poetry in it, but it was prose that followed. I couldn't help asking him whether there had been nothing to mar the pleasure of their stay in Altruria, and he answered: [...] "Well, I don't know as you could rightly say mar; it hadn't ought to have. You see, it was like this. You see, some of the mates wanted to lay off and have a regular bange, but that don't seem to be the idea here. After we had been ashore a day or two they set us to work at different jobs, or wanted to. The mates didn't take hold very lively, and some of 'em didn't take hold a bit. But after that went on a couple of days, there wa'n't any breakfast one morning, and come noontime there wa'n't any dinner, and as far forth as they could make out they had to go to bed without supper. Then they called a halt, and tackled one of your head men here that could speak some English. He didn't answer them right off the reel, but he got out his English Testament and he read 'em a verse that said, 'For even when we were with you this we commanded you, that if any one would not work neither should he eat.' That kind of fetched 'em, and after that there wa'n't any sojerin', well not to speak of. They saw he meant business. I guess it did more than any one thing to make 'em think they wa'n't dreamin'." ...|$|E

"Then {{there is}} some one else," [...] she declared, [...] "who knows {{everything}}--some one else, my man," [...] she added, leaning {{across the table and}} shaking her head with a sudden fierceness, [...] "who can step into the witness box and tell the truth about you.

But the critter belonged to nobody until it was killed, and when Sparrer knocked it over every hair on that black hide belonged to him and to no one else. The cunning redskin made up that yarn to tempt Sparrer, and there wasn't a particle of truth in it. Now the question is, what are we <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> Sparrer's property?

5000|$|The {{new state}} {{line at the}} end of the Toledo War was {{established}} at approximately the 41°44’ north latitude line just north of the mouth of the Maumee River. This gave the river and the city of Toledo to the state of Ohio, but it also created an unintended consequence for a specific area of Michigan. The state line also cut through the smaller Ottawa River and inadvertently cut off a small section of Monroe County, creating an exclave known as the “Lost Peninsula” (...) [...] The few Michigan residents that live on the small peninsula must travel south into Lucas County, Ohio on a 10-minute drive before <b>going</b> north <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the rest of Michigan.

After Burrows had been hit into the boards by Nashville forward Jerred Smithson during a game on December 8, 2009, Auger assessed Smithson with a five-minute major and a game misconduct. However, the league later rescinded because it was believed Burrows had embellished injury.
