She vibrated like a jet of electric, firm fluid in response. Yet she did not feel beautiful. All the time, {{she felt she was}} not beautiful to him, only exciting.

So far, the commercial fibres have been reduced to microns in diameter, but it seems difficult to further reduce the fibre fineness to submicrons using conventional fibre-making techniques. Electrospinning is a promising technique to produce continuous fibres with diameters on nanometre scales. This technique involves stretching a polymer fluid under a strong electric field into fine filaments, which are deposited randomly on the electrode collector forming a nonwoven nanofibre mat in most cases. Despite considerable efforts in exploring the applications of electrospun nanofibres in non-fibrous fields [1], very limited work has been conducted on using this material to process mechanically robust nanofibre yarns [2, 3]...|$|R

5000|$|According to the Yogis, {{there are}} two nerve {{currents}} in the spinal column, called Pingalâ and Idâ, and a hollow canal called Sushumnâ running through the spinal cord. At {{the lower end of}} the hollow canal is what the Yogis call the [...] "Lotus of the Kundalini". They describe it as triangular in form in which, in the symbolical language of the Yogis, there is a power called the Kundalini, coiled up. When that Kundalini awakes, it tries to force a passage through this hollow canal, and as it rises step by step, as it were, layer after layer of the mind becomes open and all the different visions and wonderful powers come to the Yogi. When it reaches the brain, the Yogi is perfectly detached from the body and mind; the soul finds itself free. We know that the spinal cord is composed in a peculiar manner. If we take the figure eight horizontally (∞) {{there are two}} parts which are connected in the middle. Suppose you add eight after eight, piled one on top of the other, that will represent the spinal cord. The left is the Ida, the right Pingala, and that hollow canal which runs through the centre of the spinal cord is the Sushumna. Where the spinal cord ends in some of the lumbar vertebrae, a <b>fine</b> <b>fibre</b> issues downwards, and the canal runs up even within that fibre, only much finer. The canal is closed at the lower end, which is situated near what is called the sacral plexus, which, according to modern physiology, is triangular in form. The different plexuses that have their centres in the spinal canal can very well stand for the different [...] "lotuses" [...] of the Yogi.|$|E
5000|$|Like babblers, {{these birds}} are usually seen {{in small groups}} of five to fifteen, {{especially}} in the non-breeding season. They are usually found inside bushes, emerging {{up to the top}} of a stem and then diving back into cover to forage. They feed mainly on insects but take berries (Lantana and Salvadora) as well as nectar. When capturing insects, they may hold them down with their feet. The group constantly produces a series of cheeping or churring calls. During the breeding season, mainly the southwest monsoon (June to August) but sometimes during the receding monsoon, the song is a strong whistling twee-twee-ta-whit-chu, often delivered from a prominent perch. The colour of the inside of the mouth is said to turn from orange-brown to black during the breeding season. They appear to nest cooperatively, the nest being a deep cone made with grass and lined with <b>fine</b> <b>fibre.</b> The nest is wedged between upright stems, the vertical stems being incorporated into the wall of the nest. The outside of the nest is well covered in cobwebs. The usual clutch is four but varies from three to five. The eggs are pinkish white with chestnut-red patches. Both parents take part in incubation and feeding the young. The eggs hatch after about 15-16 days and the young birds fledge after about 13 days. Adult birds have been seen feigning injury presumably to detract predators. Birds roost communally in the centre of a bush, all facing in the same direction and sitting side by side. Members of a group will preen each other. In an apparent territorial display, a pair of birds were found to sing while facing another singing pair and they all simultaneously bobbed their heads while perching on legs held straight to appear tall. Shikras may sometimes attempt to prey on these birds.|$|E

This study aimed {{to quantify the}} production, fibre attributes and dehairing processing of bison fibre produced from bison grazed in north-eastern Victoria. Three age/sex classes were sampled (n = 16) at seven body positions in spring. The fibre growing area was measured. Fibre was tested for diameter distribution, clean washing yield, proportion of fine fibres < 36 µm and <b>fine</b> <b>fibre</b> length, and processed by cashmere dehairing. Bison were 12 years of age, liveweights 160450 kg and had mean fibre growing area of 1. 4 m 2. They produced an average 1184 g (range 5301640 g) of <b>fine</b> <b>fibre</b> with mean fibre diameter 18. 5 µm, clean washing yield 76. 5 %, wax content 9. 8 %, suint content 14. 5 %, clean <b>fine</b> <b>fibre</b> yield 56. 4 %, <b>fine</b> <b>fibre</b> length 37 mm and fibre curvature was 93 /mm. Mid-side fibre had a crimp frequency of 6. 5 /cm and mean resistance to compression of 6. 6 kPa. Fibre had a tenacity of 8. 7 cN/tex and an extension of 39. 3 %. Restricted maximum likelihood mixed model analysis showed age/sex class and sampling site significantly affected all fibre attributes. Finer and longer fibre was produced in anterior sites and in younger bison. Fibre curvature declined 5. 3 °/mm for each 1 -µm increase in mean fibre diameter. Dehaired fibre had a mean fibre diameter of 17. 8 µm and mid-length of 28 mm, suitable for woollen spinning.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an investigation into the <b>fine</b> <b>fibre</b> production from domestic and wild Argentine South American Camelids (ASAC), carried out within a cooperation programme between the Argentine Republic and European Union, started in 1992 and financed by European Commission,- DG 1 -, Economic Cooperation Program. The programme has been planned for the following main reasons: the great potential for development of ASAC <b>fine</b> <b>fibre</b> production and genetic resources, the opportunity for the poorest land resources (Puna) to develop alternative livestock production systems, the existence of Argentine projects in the same field (PROMECAD- PROgrama MEjora CAmelidos Domestico- and INTA research activity- Instituto Nacional de Tecnología Agropecuaria-), the current low volume of fibre production due to the reduced number of animals reared in Argentina (150, 000 heads), the low product valorisation, the lack of marketing knowledge, and the low technological level of fibre processing. The main objectives of the programme have been: 1) to set up a methodology for the genetic improvement of ASAC and for the optimal management of fibre production; 2) to analyse the international market for camelid fibres and to identify new trading opportunities, 3) to study technical, economic and financial problems associated with the commercial exploitation of camelid fibres. Among the benefits resulting from this project, there has been an improvement in the level of cooperation between public and private operators {{for the development of the}} sector and the opportunity for the economic valorisation of ASAC fibres, while new possibilities for the commercial cooperation between Europe and Argentina have been identified.
