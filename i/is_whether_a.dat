5|$|One {{issue that}} has arisen <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> Singaporean who votes {{in a foreign country}} where the right to vote is not {{exclusive}} to nationals of that country is disqualified from voting in a Singapore election. For instance, the United Kingdom permits citizens of Commonwealth countries, including Singapore, who are resident in the UK and have leave to remain there (or do not require such leave) to register to vote in general elections and local government elections. When queried, the Elections Department stated that since suffrage in the UK is not exclusive to British citizens, Singaporeans who vote there are still eligible to vote in Singapore. However, this interpretation of the PEA has not been tested in court.|$|E
25|$|The main design {{question}} when deciding between a {{one and a}} half or two fluid LFTR <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> more complicated reprocessing or a more demanding structural barrier will be easier to solve.|$|E
25|$|The main {{question}} Justice Felix Frankfurter considers {{in his opinion}} <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> conviction by a state court that arises out of use of evidence {{that would not have}} been admitted in a federal court of law denies the defendant due process of law guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.|$|E

25|$|Another retired Senator of the College of Justice, Lord Coulsfield, gave an {{interview}} on BBC Scotland's Sunday Live Programme, stating that 'The real issue here <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> decision of the magnitude that Lord Clarke had to take should always be taken by a single judge'.|$|E
25|$|The SCJA {{does not}} contain any {{provisions}} {{similar to the ones}} referred to above that apply to Supreme Court judges. Nonetheless, at common law a judge can be disqualified from hearing or deciding a case {{if he or she is}} actually biased against a party, or appears to biased. The test for apparent bias <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> reasonable and fair-minded person sitting in court and knowing all the relevant facts would have a reasonable suspicion that a fair trial for the litigant is not possible.|$|E
25|$|The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union article 102 {{contains}} the prohibition on monopolies abusing a dominant position. As {{well as a}} general ban, it prohibits specific practices including price discrimination and exclusive dealing. It enables legislation to be adopted on mergers between firms (the current regulation is the Regulation 139/2004/EC). The general test <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> concentration (i.e. merger or acquisition) with a community dimension (i.e. affects a number of EU member states) might significantly impede effective competition.|$|E
50|$|The {{issue before}} the Court <b>was</b> <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> fair use defense was {{available}} where {{the materials used}} were obtained in bad faith.|$|R
5000|$|The {{ultimate}} issue <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>an</b> inference of discrimination is more probable {{from the evidence}} than the actual explanations offered by the respondent.|$|R
50|$|The {{issue before}} the Court <b>was</b> <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> fair use existed where the purported {{infringer}} published a public figure’s unpublished {{work on an}} important public event.|$|R
25|$|The most {{important}} two questions about geographical names <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> name should {{be written in}} one word, with hyphens, or in separate words, and which elements should be written uppercase and lowercase. Different written forms may refer to different entities, e.g. Sáros-patak lit. ‘muddy river’ refers to a river, but Sárospatak refers to a city (because rivers’ names are written with a hyphen, but city names are written as one word). This field {{is considered one of}} the most complex parts of Hungarian orthography, so a separate volume was published about it, and a separate board (Földrajzinév-bizottság) working in the Ministry of Agriculture is entitled to give statements. It consists of experts in linguistics, education, transportation, hidrology, natural protection, public administration, ethnic minorities, foreign relations, and other fields.|$|E
25|$|Philosophy is {{sometimes}} {{described as a}} life of reason, with normal human reason pursued in a more consistent and dedicated way than usual. Two categories of problem concerning reason have long been discussed by philosophers concerning reason, essentially being reasonings about reasoning itself as a human aim, or philosophizing about philosophizing. The first question is concerning whether we can be confident that reason can achieve knowledge of truth better than other ways of trying to achieve such knowledge. The other question <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> life of reason, a life that aims to be guided by reason, {{can be expected to}} achieve a happy life more so than other ways of life (whether such a life of reason results in knowledge or not).|$|E
500|$|No taxonomic {{distinction}} is made between locust and grasshopper species; {{the basis for}} the definition <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> species forms swarms under intermittently suitable conditions. In English, the term [...] "locust" [...] is used for grasshopper species that change morphologically and behaviourally on crowding, forming swarms that develop from bands of immature stages called hoppers.|$|E

50|$|The House of Lords {{held that}} the only thing that mattered <b>was</b> <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> {{reasonable}} person could have relied on the conduct that looked like an assurance.|$|R
30|$|Another {{key control}} {{variable}} <b>was</b> <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> {{child from the}} household receives childcare services or not, as individuals who use the services personally may assess the accessibility differently.|$|R
500|$|Locusts {{are certain}} species of short-horned {{grasshoppers}} {{in the family}} Acrididae that have a swarming phase. These insects are usually solitary, but under certain circumstances, become more abundant and change their behaviour and habits, becoming gregarious. [...] No taxonomic distinction is made between locust and grasshopper species; {{the basis for the}} definition <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> species forms swarms under intermittently suitable conditions.|$|E
500|$|A major {{difference}} in hunting performance <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> dog is hot-nosed, meaning it will skip an older scent {{to follow a}} fresher one, or cold-nosed, meaning it will follow an older scent. Of the six coonhound breeds, the hot-nosed Treeing Walker Coonhound is the most popular. Some hunters also use Louisiana Catahoula Leopard Dogs, although this breed is not a hound but a cur.|$|E
500|$|A {{threshold}} test {{considered by}} courts applying Section 116 <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> belief seeking constitutional protection is a [...] "religion". [...] The leading {{authority on the}} question is the 1983 judgment of the High Court in Church of the New Faith v Commissioner for Pay-Roll Tax (Vic). [...] The court found that Scientology was a religion, despite some justices commenting that its practices were [...] "impenetrably obscure". In reaching this finding, the court argued that the definition of religion needed to be flexible but should recognise {{the need to be}} sceptical of disingenous claims of religious practice. [...] Justices Anthony Mason and Gerard Brennan held: ...|$|E
25|$|At issue <b>was</b> <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> union {{breaches}} its duty of fair representation by {{negotiating a}} union security clause that uses statutory language without articulating the Court's interpretation of that language.|$|R
50|$|The central {{question}} the Federal Court addressed in Bowers v. Baystate <b>was</b> <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> shrink wrap license that forbids reverse engineering was preempted by federal Copyright law which expressly permits reverse engineering.|$|R
50|$|The {{issue before}} the Supreme Court <b>was</b> <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> {{judgment}} issued by a Court in Florida could be enforced in Ontario, {{and whether the}} defendant could seek refuge under section 7 of the Charter.|$|R
500|$|One {{threshold}} {{question in}} the Fourth Amendment jurisprudence <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> [...] "search" [...] has occurred. Initial Fourth Amendment case law hinged on [...] a citizen's property rights—that is, when the government physically intrudes on [...] "persons, houses, papers, or effects" [...] {{for the purpose of}} obtaining information, a [...] "search" [...] within the original meaning of the Fourth Amendment has occurred. Early 20th-century Court decisions, such as Olmstead v. United States (1928), held that Fourth Amendment rights applied in cases of physical intrusion, but not to other forms of police surveillance (e.g., wiretaps). In Silverman v. United States (1961), the Court stated of the amendment that [...] "at the very core stands the right of a man to retreat into his own home and there be free from unreasonable governmental intrusion." ...|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> major {{distinction}} <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>an</b> object's lifetime <b>is</b> deterministic or non-deterministic. This {{varies by}} language, and within language {{varies with the}} memory allocation of an object; recall that object lifetime is distinct from variable lifetime.|$|R
2500|$|The {{only thing}} I care about <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> monkey {{will turn out}} a {{property}} I can publish. [...] I don't have any love for them. Never have. [...] I don't really like animals. I despise cats. I hate dogs. How could you like monkeys? ...|$|E
2500|$|... he {{issue in}} this case - {{and we do not}} {{understand}} either appellees or the Court to contend otherwise - <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> State may put an individual to a choice between his business and his religion. The Court today holds that it may. But I dissent, believing that such a law prohibits the free exercise of religion.|$|E
2500|$|Phylogenetic {{classification}} traditionally {{relies on}} inheritance of the lexicon, especially of [...] "core" [...] terms, {{and of the}} grammar structure. However, in creoles, the core lexicon often has mixed origin, and the grammar is largely original. For these reasons, the issue of which language is {{the parent of a}} creole—that <b>is,</b> <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> language should be classified as a [...] "Portuguese creole" [...] or [...] "English creole", etc.—often has no definitive answer, and can become the topic of long-lasting controversies, where social prejudices and political considerations may interfere with scientific discussion.|$|E
50|$|Note: Probably the {{essential}} {{point for the}} public <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>an</b> organisation lists a therapist in their public directory of registered, practising hypnotherapists or not - rather than <b>whether</b> the grade <b>is</b> Licentiate, Affiliate, Accredited etc.|$|R
50|$|A {{controversy}} erupted {{over the}} {{plans of the}} new museum and <b>whether</b> it <b>was</b> appropriate to build it on the archaeological site in Makrygianni neighborhood. Another concern <b>was</b> <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> large modern building would fit well into the landscape.|$|R
