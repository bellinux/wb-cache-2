5|$|Another {{transitional}} {{feature of}} Dimetrodon is a ridge <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> jaw called the reflected lamina. The reflected lamina is {{found on the}} articular bone, which connects to the quadrate bone of the skull to form the jaw joint. In later mammal ancestors, the articular and quadrate separated from the jaw joint while the articular developed into the malleus bone of the middle ear. The reflected lamina became part of a ring called the tympanic annulus that supports the ear drum in all living mammals.|$|E

5|$|Stephen Travers {{heard the}} gunmen rummaging <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> minibus, where {{he kept his}} guitar.

The gunman turned him round, punched him in the back and pushed him on the shoulder back into the line-up.|$|E
5|$|The {{boys were}} found in their beds in their own room (formerly Sheila's room). They {{appeared}} to have been shot while in bed.

Nicholas had been shot three times, all contact or close-proximity shots.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} contest pitted Bobby Roode, who {{was accompanied}} by Coach D'Amore, against Ron Killings. The duration of the match was 9 minutes and 53 seconds. Konnan interfered in the bout distracting Killings, which allowed Roode to sneak up behind Killings and hit him <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> head with Roode's signature Northern Lariat maneuver.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} between Bad News Brown and Ken Patera. Before the bell rang, however, Brown {{attacked}} Patera, who retaliated by performing a clothesline from the corner. Patera then slipped {{both of his}} arms underneath Brown's armpits and locked {{his hands behind his}} neck, using a submission move known as a full nelson. At the end of the match, Brown defeated Patera by striking him <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> head with his finishing move, the Ghetto Blaster.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} 2-way design {{consisted of}} two 150-4C bass drivers with 4-inch coils, and two H5038P-100 elliptical horns. The 5038s are essentially midrange drivers that start rolling off at 15kHz. In 1960, after feedback from foreign distributors, the Paragon {{was made into a}} 3-way loudspeaker by adding two 075 ring radiators (tweeters) mounted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cabinet and aimed at the central 'sweet spot'. Bass–mid crossover was at 500Hz and mid–treble frequencies crossed over at 7kHz.|$|E

5|$|The {{scenes in}} Calgary were {{actually}} shot <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Universal Studios lot in Los Angeles.

5|$|A Czech woman went to Heydrich's aid and flagged down a {{delivery}} van. He was first {{placed in the}} driver's cab, but complained the van's movement was causing him pain. He was placed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> van, on his stomach, and taken {{to the emergency room}} at Bulovka Hospital. He had suffered severe injuries to his left side, with major damage to his diaphragm, spleen, and one of his lungs. He also had a fractured rib. A doctor, Slanina, packed the chest wound, while another doctor, Walter Diek, tried unsuccessfully to remove the splinters. He immediately decided to operate. This was carried out by Diek, Slanina, and Hohlbaum. Heydrich was given several blood transfusions. A splenectomy was performed. The chest wound, left lung, and diaphragm were all debrided and the wounds closed.|$|E
5|$|After being marched {{two miles}} north-west {{of the city}} centre, the victims {{encountered}} a barbed wire barrier and numerous Ukrainian police and German troops. Thirty or forty people at a time were told to leave their possessions and were escorted through a narrow passageway lined with soldiers brandishing clubs. Anyone who tried to escape was beaten. Soon the victims reached an open area, where {{they were forced to}} strip, and then were herded down into the ravine. People were forced to lie down in rows on top of the bodies of other victims, and they were shot <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> head or the neck by members of the execution squads.|$|E

5|$|Before {{an attack}} on Moscow could begin, {{operations}} in Kiev needed to be finished. Half of Army Group Center had swung to the south <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kiev position, while Army Group South moved to the north from its Dniepr bridgehead. The encirclement of Soviet forces in Kiev was achieved on 16 September. A battle ensued in which the Soviets were hammered with tanks, artillery, and aerial bombardment. After ten days of vicious fighting, the Germans claimed 665,000 Soviet soldiers captured, although the real figure is probably around 220,000 prisoners. Soviet losses were 452,720 men, 3,867 artillery pieces and mortars from 43 divisions of the 5th, 21st, 26th, and 37th Soviet Armies. Despite the exhaustion and losses facing some German units (upwards of 75 percent of their men) from the intense fighting, the massive defeat of the Soviets at Kiev and the Red Army losses {{during the first three}} months of the assault contributed to the German assumption that Operation Typhoon (the attack on Moscow) could still succeed.|$|E
5|$|During 2002, The Hurricane won the WWF Hardcore Championship at WrestleMania X8, but Molly betrayed him, {{hitting him}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{head with a}} frying pan, and {{defeating}} him for the championship. Helms was later drafted to the SmackDown! brand following the brand extension, and he won the Cruiserweight Championship from Tajiri and Billy Kidman in a triple threat match. He lost it to Jamie Noble at King of the Ring. Later in 2002, he was traded to Raw, won the World Tag Team Championship with Kane, and held them for around a month in an alliance known as Hurri-Kane.|$|E
5|$|Five months later, Wendy is on {{a subway}} train with her roommate Laura {{and her friend}} Sean. When she sees more omens she begins to get off, but sees Julie {{entering}} the car and decides to stay. Wendy notices Kevin sitting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> car. The train derails, and everyone aboard shortly dies; Julie is hit by a stray wheel, and Kevin is crushed between the train and the tunnel wall. Wendy survives the crash, but is hit by another train. This {{turns out to be}} another premonition, and they attempt to stop the train. The screen goes black, followed by the sound of screeching metal.|$|E

5|$|Homologues {{of most of}} {{the bones}} of temnospondyls are also seen in other early tetrapods, aside from a few bones in the skull, such as interfrontals, internasals, and interparietals, that have {{developed}} in some temnospondyl taxa. Most temnospondyls have tabular horns in the backs of their skulls, rounded projections of bone separated {{from the rest of the}} skull by indentations called otic notches; in some temnospondyls, such as Zatrachys, they are pointed and very prominent. Among the most distinguishing features of temnospondyls are the interpterygoid vacuities, two large holes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> palate. Another pair of holes, choanae, are present in front of these vacuities, and connect the nasal passage with the mouth. Temnospondyls often have teeth on their palates, as well as in their jaws. Some of these teeth are so large, they are referred to as tusks. In some temnospondyls, such as Nigerpeton, tusks in the lower jaw pierce the palate and emerge through openings in the top of the skull.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} episode, Big Boo and Doggett's {{friendship}} continues to develop. Seeing that Doggett bears strong {{feelings of guilt}} relating to the six abortions that she has had, Big Boo makes reference to the book Freakonomics, which suggests that crime rates in the 1990s fell because of Roe v. Wade. Following Lorna Morello (played by Yael Stone) being relieved of her duty of driving the prison van, the role is given to Doggett. She comes into contact {{with one of the}} new correctional officers called Charlie Coates (played by James McMenamin). Coates is initially friendly towards Doggett. Despite relationships between prison staff and prisoners being forbidden, Coates kisses Doggett, against her will, after feeding some ducks. Following another outing, Coates gets in trouble with his boss Joe Caputo (played by Nick Sandow) for being late for count and is placed on probation. Doggett apologises for having caused him trouble, and he rapes her <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prison van.|$|E
5|$|Neville {{once again}} {{attempts}} to administer a potential cure to the infected {{woman in his}} laboratory, but the next night, a group of Darkseekers, who had followed Anna and Neville back the night before, attacks the house. Neville, Anna, and Ethan retreat into the basement laboratory, sealing themselves in with the female Darkseeker on which Neville has been experimenting. Discovering that the last treatment was successful, Neville tries to assess the situation as the alpha male deliberately rams himself against a glass door to break in. Neville draws a vial of blood from the woman he cured and gives it to Anna, before shutting her and Ethan inside a coal chute <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lab. He then takes a grenade and kills the Darkseekers {{at the cost of}} his own life, saving the cure. The next day, before dusk, Anna and Ethan discover that her theory is right as they arrive at the survivors camp in Vermont. They are greeted by some military officers and other survivors and Anna is shown handing the cure to a man.|$|E
