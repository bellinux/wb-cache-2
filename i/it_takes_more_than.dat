5|$|In 1899 William Henry Pickering {{discovered}} Phoebe, {{a highly}} irregular satellite {{that does not}} rotate synchronously with Saturn as the larger moons do. Phoebe was the first such satellite found and <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a year to orbit Saturn in a retrograde orbit.

5|$|The Capobiancos {{argued that}} <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> mere biology {{to invoke the}} {{provisions}} of the ICWA, and under South Carolina law, a father must not only reside with the mother for the six-month period preceding the birth of the child but also contribute to pregnancy-related expenses in order to have paternity rights. However, the Court determined that the ICWA does not defer to state law, and the trial court properly determined that the ICWA grants Indian fathers greater rights than state law.|$|E

500|$|Claudia Puig of USA Today gave a {{negative}} review, {{stating that the}} film [...] "is trying for a new image. But <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> an awkward title attempting to sound cool to overcome its mundane plot and silly dialogue." [...] Michael Ordona of the Los Angeles Times wrote that [...] "despite the doll-like cartoonishness of the human figures, the filmmakers seem to expect us to take this animated romp seriously. Too seriously." [...] Wesley Morris of the Boston Globe called the film [...] "a junk-food pastry. The plot is the wrapper. The action is the oily sponge cake. And the message—family, family, family—is the processed cream filling." ...|$|E
500|$|The Voigt-Kampff {{machine is}} a fictional {{interrogation}} tool, originating from the novel. The Voigt-Kampff is a polygraph-like machine used by blade runners {{to determine whether}} an individual is a replicant. It measures bodily functions such as respiration, blush response, heart rate and eye movement {{in response to questions}} dealing with empathy. (Tyrell states: [...] "Capillary dilation of the so-called blush response? Fluctuation of the pupil? Involuntary dilation of the iris?") In the film two replicants take the test, Leon and Rachael, and Deckard tells Tyrell that it usually takes 20 to 30 cross-referenced questions to distinguish a replicant; in contrast with the book, where it is stated it only takes [...] "six or seven" [...] questions to make a determination. In the film <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one hundred questions to determine that Rachael is a replicant.|$|E

500|$|This rockfowl builds its nest {{onto the}} sides of rocks, {{normally}} in caves, where nests are built both by the entrance and deep within, or on nearly vertical cliff faces, which can be either bare or have some vegetation, though never woody branches, near the nest. Nests need to be built under an overhang {{to protect it from}} water, and the rock surface normally slopes forward slightly. The nests are almost always found near water, which can be in the form of either streams or forest pools. These streams, particularly those located {{at the base of a}} nesting cliff, help keep predators away from the nests. Nests on rock surfaces are normally built [...] above the ground. In addition to the rock face nests, there is a record of a nest being constructed on the buttress root of a Piptadeniastrum tree above a small stream. Two nests were even built onto a concrete bridge in Gabon's Lopé National Park. The male and female rockfowl work equally on the nest's construction, and it can take two to three months to build one, though in some extreme cases <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a year. The nest itself is a half-cup constructed of dry mud with grass fibres and dead leaves mixed in, often with the plant matter sticking out of the nest's walls. It is either built onto the rock surface or, in some cases, is built more like a retaining wall across the opening of a small rock fissure. Nests are built at least away [...] from each other, and in some cases up to [...] The nest is normally [...] thick, though the nest is uneven in its construction and one nest was [...] thick. It is about [...] wide and [...] long and weighs about [...] However, nest sizes do have a large degree of variability. After the mud dries, it becomes a very hard structure. The inside of the nest is lined with rootlets and thin strips of grass.|$|E
500|$|Despite other R-rated horror films having {{centered}} around teenagers, {{some such as}} Scream having been successful, Bock said the second reason Jennifer's Body under-performed {{at the box office}} is the R-rating, which he described as a [...] "killer" [...] for the film. He said the film is set in high school and [...] "sounds like the perfect package for teens" [...] but that [...] "the R rating banned many teens from the theaters" [...] and the studio was left with [...] "an R-rated film marketed to whom, exactly?" [...] Nicole Sperling of Entertainment Weekly felt that it was a slow and disappointing weekend for the box office in general; 3D animated film Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs was steep competition, and with low box office performances by the Matt Damon film The Informant! and Jennifer Aniston film Love Happens, she concluded that this may support [...] "the current hypothesis floating around Hollywood, that movie stars no longer matter" [...] and that <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a name to open a film. S.T. VanAirsdale of Movieline echoed Sperling's sentiment about the weekend, as [...] "some of the stinkiest high-profile openings in recent memory". He concluded five reasons for Jennifer's Bodys underperformance at the box office. The first, he said, is the distributor. [...] "20th Century Fox's genre wing, Fox Atomic, had Jennifer's Body in the can by the time the mother ship shut it down last spring", he said. [...] "Instead of offloading the film to Fox Searchlight, which nimbly maneuvered Diablo Cody's previous brainchild Juno to awards-season lucre in 2007, a decision was somehow reached to fill a gap in Big Fox's early fall slate with a gory" [...] and [...] "post-feminist horror romp starring Megan Fox and Amanda Seyfried". VanAirsdale classified this as a [...] "ig mistake" [...] and that [...] "ou'd {{have to go back to}} The Devil Wears Prada to find an example of a Fox release that worked without a genuine male lead; you’d probably have to go back to Aliens to find a genre example of such that they pulled off successfully." [...] He named the second reason as the marketing, stating that the film was not well-marketed (whether by billboards, transit posters, lobby standees, or other promotional venues), even in New York.|$|E

2500|$|On October 14, 1912, while {{campaigning in}} Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Roosevelt {{was shot by}} a saloonkeeper named John Flammang Schrank. The bullet lodged in his chest after {{penetrating}} his steel eyeglass case and passing through a thick (50 pages) single-folded copy of the speech titled [...] "", which he was carrying in his jacket. Roosevelt, as an experienced hunter and anatomist, correctly concluded that since he was not coughing blood, the bullet had not reached his lung, and he declined suggestions {{to go to the}} hospital immediately. Instead, he delivered his [...] with blood seeping into his shirt. He spoke for 90 minutes before completing his speech and accepting medical attention. His opening comments to the gathered crowd were, [...] "Ladies and gentlemen, I don't know whether you fully understand that I have just been shot, but <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> that to kill a Bull Moose." [...] Afterwards, probes and an x-ray showed that the bullet had lodged in Roosevelt's chest muscle, but did not penetrate the pleura. Doctors concluded that it would be less dangerous to leave it in place than to attempt to remove it, and Roosevelt carried the bullet with him for the rest of his life.|$|E
