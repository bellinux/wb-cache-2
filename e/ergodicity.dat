25|$|A Bernoulli {{shift is}} ergodic. More generally, <b>ergodicity</b> {{of the shift}} {{transformation}} associated with a sequence of i.i.d. random variables and some more general stationary processes follows from Kolmogorov's zero–one law.|$|E
25|$|Any time-invariant {{operations}} also preserves AEP, stationarity and <b>ergodicity</b> {{and we may}} easily turn {{a stationary}} process to non-stationary without losing AEP by nulling out {{a finite number of}} time samples in the process.|$|E
25|$|The {{concepts}} of <b>ergodicity</b> and the ergodic hypothesis {{are central to}} applications of ergodic theory. The underlying idea is that for certain systems the time average of their properties {{is equal to the}} average over the entire space. Applications of ergodic theory to other parts of mathematics usually involve establishing <b>ergodicity</b> properties for systems of special kind. In geometry, methods of ergodic theory have been used to study the geodesic flow on Riemannian manifolds, starting with the results of Eberhard Hopf for Riemann surfaces of negative curvature. Markov chains form a common context for applications in probability theory. Ergodic theory has fruitful connections with harmonic analysis, Lie theory (representation theory, lattices in algebraic groups), and number theory (the theory of diophantine approximations, L-functions).|$|E
25|$|A first {{approach}} for analyzing cellular networks {{is to consider}} the typical user, who can be assumed to be located anywhere on the plane. Under the assumption of point process <b>ergodicity</b> (satisfied when using homogeneous Poisson processes), {{the results for the}} typical user correspond to user averages. The coverage probability of the typical user is then interpreted as the proportion of network users who can connect to the cellular network.|$|E
25|$|Many other {{physical}} {{systems can be}} modeled as sets of coupled oscillators. The motions of such oscillators can be decomposed into normal modes, like the vibrational modes of a piano string or the resonances of an organ pipe. On the other hand, equipartition often breaks down for such systems, {{because there is no}} exchange of energy between the normal modes. In an extreme situation, the modes are independent and so their energies are independently conserved. This shows that some sort of mixing of energies, formally called <b>ergodicity,</b> is important for the law of equipartition to hold.|$|E
25|$|Another way <b>ergodicity</b> can {{be broken}} is by the {{existence}} of nonlinear soliton symmetries. In 1953, Fermi, Pasta, Ulam and Tsingou conducted computer simulations of a vibrating string that included a non-linear term (quadratic in one test, cubic in another, and a piecewise linear approximation to a cubic in a third). They found that {{the behavior of the}} system was quite different from what intuition based on equipartition would have led them to expect. Instead of the energies in the modes becoming equally shared, the system exhibited a very complicated quasi-periodic behavior. This puzzling result was eventually explained by Kruskal and Zabusky in 1965 in a paper which, by connecting the simulated system to the Korteweg–de Vries equation {{led to the development of}} soliton mathematics.|$|E
25|$|A {{commonly}} cited counter-example where {{energy is}} not shared among its various forms and where equipartition {{does not hold}} in the microcanonical ensemble is a system of coupled harmonic oscillators. If the system is isolated {{from the rest of}} the world, the energy in each normal mode is constant; energy is not transferred from one mode to another. Hence, equipartition does not hold for such a system; the amount of energy in each normal mode is fixed at its initial value. If sufficiently strong nonlinear terms are present in the energy function, energy may be transferred between the normal modes, leading to <b>ergodicity</b> and rendering the law of equipartition valid. However, the Kolmogorov–Arnold–Moser theorem states that energy will not be exchanged unless the nonlinear perturbations are strong enough; if they are too small, the energy will remain trapped in at least some of the modes.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>ergodicity</b> of the {{geodesic}} flow on compact Riemann {{surfaces of}} variable negative curvature and on compact manifolds of constant negative curvature of any dimension was proved by Eberhard Hopf in 1939, although special cases had been studied earlier: see for example, Hadamard's billiards (1898) and Artin billiard (1924). The relation between geodesic flows on Riemann surfaces and one-parameter subgroups on SL(2, R) {{was described in}} 1952 by S. V. Fomin and I. M. Gelfand. The article on Anosov flows {{provides an example of}} ergodic flows on SL(2, R) and on Riemann surfaces of negative curvature. [...] Much of the development described there generalizes to hyperbolic manifolds, since they can be viewed as quotients of the hyperbolic space by the action of a lattice in the semisimple Lie group SO(n,1). <b>Ergodicity</b> of the geodesic flow on Riemannian symmetric spaces was demonstrated by F. I. Mautner in 1957. In 1967 D. V. Anosov and Ya. G. Sinai proved <b>ergodicity</b> of the geodesic flow on compact manifolds of variable negative sectional curvature. A simple criterion for the <b>ergodicity</b> of a homogeneous flow on a homogeneous space of a semisimple Lie group was given by Calvin C. Moore in 1966.

2500|$|<b>Ergodicity</b> of a {{continuous}} dynamical system means that its trajectories [...] "spread around" [...] the phase space. A {{system with a}} compact phase space which has a non-constant first integral cannot be ergodic. This applies, in particular, to Hamiltonian systems with a first integral I functionally independent from the Hamilton function H and a compact level set X = {(p,q): H(p,q) = E} of constant energy. Liouville's theorem implies {{the existence of a}} finite invariant measure on X, but the dynamics of the system is constrained to the level sets of I on X, hence the system possesses invariant sets of positive but less than full measure. A property of continuous dynamical systems that is the opposite of <b>ergodicity</b> is complete integrability.|$|E
2500|$|Any {{process that}} generates {{successive}} messages {{can be considered}} a source of information. [...] A memoryless source is one in which each message is an independent identically distributed random variable, whereas the properties of <b>ergodicity</b> and stationarity impose less restrictive constraints. [...] All such sources are stochastic. [...] These terms are well studied in their own right outside information theory.|$|E
2500|$|When {{implementing}} the algorithm, one {{must ensure that}} g(μ, ν) is selected such that <b>ergodicity</b> is met. In thermal equilibrium a system's energy only fluctuates within a small range. This is the motivation behind the concept of single-spin-flip dynamics, which states that in each transition, we will only change one of the spin sites on the lattice. [...] Furthermore, by using single- spin-flip dynamics, one can get from any state to any other state by flipping each site that differs between the two states one at a time.|$|E
