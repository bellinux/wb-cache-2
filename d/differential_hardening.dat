25|$|At this stage, {{it is only}} {{slightly}} curved or may have no curve at all. The katanas gentle curvature is attained by a process of <b>differential</b> <b>hardening</b> or differential quenching: the smith coats the blade with several layers of a wet clay slurry, which is a special concoction unique to each sword maker, but generally composed of clay, water and any or none of ash, grinding stone powder, or rust. This process is called tsuchioki. The edge of the blade is coated with a thinner layer than the sides and spine of the sword, heated, and then quenched in water (few sword makers use oil to quench the blade). The slurry causes only the blade's edge to be hardened and also causes the blade to curve due to the difference in densities of the micro-structures in the steel. When steel with a carbon content of 0.7% is heated beyond 750°C, it enters the austenite phase. When austenite is cooled very suddenly by quenching in water, the structure changes into martensite, {{which is a very}} hard form of steel. When austenite is allowed to cool slowly, its structure changes into a mixture of ferrite and pearlite which is softer than martensite.

40|$|AbstractA {{servo-controlled}} multiaxial {{tube expansion}} testing machine {{was used to}} measure the multiaxial plastic deformation behavior of a cold rolled IF steel sheet for a range of strain from initial yield to fracture. The testing machine is capable of applying arbitrary principal stress or strain paths to a tubular specimen using an electrical, closed-loop servo-control system for an axial force and an internal pressure. Tubular specimens with an inner diameter of 44. 6 mm were fabricated from a cold rolled interstitial-free steel sheet with a thickness of 0. 7 mm by roller bending and laser welding. Many linear stress paths in the first quadrant of stress space were applied to the tubular specimens to measure the forming limit curve and forming limit stress curve of the as-received sheet sample, in addition to the contours of plastic work and the directions of the plastic strain rates. It was found that the shapes of the measured work contours changed with increasing plastic work.

50|$|Modern {{versions}} of <b>differential</b> <b>hardening</b> were developed when sources of rapidly heating the metal were devised, {{such as an}} oxy-acetylene torch or induction heating.

50|$|<b>Differential</b> <b>hardening</b> is {{a method}} used in heat {{treating}} swords and knives to increase the hardness of the edge without making the whole blade brittle. To achieve this, the edge is cooled faster than the spine by adding a heat insulator to the spine before quenching. Clay or another material is used for insulation. To prevent cracking and loss of surface carbon, quenching is usually performed before beveling, shaping, and sharpening the edge. It can also be achieved by carefully pouring water (perhaps already heated) onto {{the edge of a}} blade {{as is the case with}} the manufacture of some kukri. <b>Differential</b> <b>hardening</b> technology originated in China and later spread to Korea and Japan. This technique is mainly used in the Chinese jian and the katana, the traditional Japanese sword, and the khukuri, the traditional Nepalese knife. Most blades made with this technique have visible temper lines. This method is sometimes called differential tempering, but this term more accurately refers to a different technique, which originated with the broadswords of Europe.|$|E
50|$|<b>Differential</b> <b>hardening</b> {{will produce}} two {{different}} zones of hardness, which respond differently to grinding, sharpening, and polishing. The back and {{center of the}} blade will grind away much quicker than the edge, so the polisher will need to carefully control {{the angle of the}} edge, which will affect the geometry of the blade. An inexperienced polisher can quickly ruin a blade by applying too much pressure to the softened areas, rapidly altering the blade's shape without much change to the hardened zone.|$|E

50|$|Differential {{tempering}} is {{a method}} of providing different amounts of temper to {{different parts of the}} steel. The method is often used in bladesmithing, for making knives and swords, to provide a very hard edge while softening the spine or center of the blade. This increased the toughness while maintaining a very hard, sharp, impact-resistant edge, helping to prevent breakage. This technique was more often found in Europe, as opposed to the <b>differential</b> <b>hardening</b> techniques more common in Asia, such as in Japanese swordsmithing.|$|E
50|$|Differential {{tempering}} (also called graded tempering, selective tempering {{or local}} tempering) is the inverse of <b>differential</b> <b>hardening,</b> to ultimately produce similar results. Differential tempering begins by taking steel {{that has been}} uniformly quenched and hardened, and then heating it in localized areas to reduce the hardness. The process is often used in blacksmithing for tempering cutting instruments, softening the back, shaft, or spine, but simultaneously tempering the edge to a very high hardness. The process was very common in ancient Europe, for making tools, but soon was applied to knives and swords as well.|$|E
50|$|Some {{techniques}} allow {{different areas}} of a single object to receive different heat treatments. This is called <b>differential</b> <b>hardening.</b> It is common in high quality knives and swords. The Chinese jian {{is one of the}} earliest known examples of this, and the Japanese katana may be the most widely known. The Nepalese Khukuri is another example. This technique uses an insulating layer, like layers of clay, to cover the areas that are to remain soft. The areas to be hardened are left exposed, allowing only certain parts of the steel to fully harden when quenched.|$|E
50|$|<b>Differential</b> <b>hardening</b> (also called {{differential}} quenching, selective quenching, selective hardening, {{or local}} hardening) is {{most commonly used}} in bladesmithing to increase the toughness of a blade while keeping very high hardness and strength at the edge. This helps to make the blade very resistant to breaking, by making the spine very soft and bendable, but allows greater hardness at the edge than would be possible if the blade was uniformly quenched and tempered. This helps to create a tough blade that will maintain a very sharp, wear-resistant edge, even during rough use such as found in combat.|$|E
50|$|Differential heat {{treatment}} (also called selective {{heat treatment}} or local heat treatment) {{is a technique}} used during heat treating to harden or soften certain areas of a steel object, creating a difference in hardness between these areas. There are many techniques for creating a difference in properties, but most {{can be defined as}} either <b>differential</b> <b>hardening</b> or differential tempering. These were common heat treating techniques used historically in Europe and Asia, with possibly the most widely known example being from Japanese swordsmithing. Some modern varieties were developed in the twentieth century as metallurgical knowledge and technology rapidly increased.|$|E
50|$|The sword smiths of China {{are often}} {{credited}} with the forging technologies that traveled to Korea and Japan to allow sword smiths there to create such weapons as the katana.These technologies include folding, inserted alloys, and <b>differential</b> <b>hardening</b> of the edge.

50|$|Although <b>differential</b> <b>hardening</b> {{produces}} {{a very hard}} edge, it also leaves {{the rest of the}} sword rather soft, which can make it prone to bending under heavy loads, such as parrying a hard blow. It can also make the edge more susceptible to chipping or cracking. Swords of this type can usually only be resharpened a few times before reaching the softer metal underneath the edge. However, if properly protected and maintained, these blades can usually hold an edge for long periods of time, even after slicing through bone and flesh, or heavily matted bamboo to simulate cutting through body parts, as is in iaido.|$|E
50|$|These discoveries soon led to {{the carbon}} print, gum bichromate, and other {{photographic}} printing processes based on <b>differential</b> <b>hardening.</b> Typically, after exposure, the unhardened portion was rinsed away with warm water, leaving a thin relief that either contained a pigment included during manufacture or was subsequently stained with a dye.

5000|$|Unlike with <b>{{differential}}</b> <b>hardening,</b> in differential tempering {{there is}} no distinct boundary between the harder and softer metals, but the change from hard to soft is very gradual, forming a continuum, or [...] "grade" [...] (gradient), of hardness. However, higher heating temperatures cause the colors to spread less, creating a much steeper grade, while lower temperatures can make the change more gradual, using a smaller portion of the entire continuum. The tempering colors only represent {{a fraction of the}} entire grade, because the metal turns grey above 650 F, making it difficult to judge the temperature, but the hardness will continue to decrease as the temperature rises.|$|E
5000|$|Differential heat {{treatment}} {{is a method}} used to alter the properties of various parts of a steel object differently, producing areas that are harder or softer than others. This creates greater toughness in {{the parts of the}} object where it is needed, such as the tang or spine of a sword, but produces greater hardness at the edge or other areas where greater impact resistance, wear resistance, and strength is needed. Differential {{heat treatment}} can often make certain areas harder than could be allowed if the steel was uniformly treated, or [...] "through treated". There are several techniques used to differentially heat treat steel, but they can usually be divided into <b>differential</b> <b>hardening</b> and differential tempering methods.|$|E

50|$|<b>Differential</b> <b>hardening</b> {{consists}} of either two methods. It can involve heating the metal evenly to a red-hot temperature and then cooling it at different rates, turning {{part of the}} object into very hard martensite while the rest cools slower and becomes softer pearlite. It may also consist of heating {{only a part of}} the object very quickly to red-hot and then rapidly cooling (quenching), turning only part of it into hard martensite but leaving the rest unchanged. Conversely, differential tempering methods consist of heating the object evenly to red-hot and then quenching the entire object, turning the whole thing into martensite. The object is then heated to a much lower temperature to soften it (tempering), but is only heated in a localized area, softening only a part of it.|$|E
50|$|Japanese sword makers {{developed}} the secret technique of <b>differential</b> <b>hardening</b> by covering their sword blades in different thicknesses of clay. The thinner clay allowed the heated metal to cool faster when quenched. Also, the thinner metal {{of the edge}} cooled faster than the spine. The faster cooled metal had a finer crystal structure which along with being harder also allowed polishing the blade to reveal the pattern between the fast and slow cooled steel. As well, {{the different types of}} steel had different densities which led to the blade, straight or almost straight blade before quenching, to becoming curved. For this reason it was necessary when quenching to plunge the blade straight into the quenching fluid as a blade that went in at a different angle could curve to the side and be rendered utterly useless. European sword makers produced similar results using differential tempering.|$|E
50|$|Differential {{tempering}} can be {{made more}} difficult by {{the shape of the}} blade. When tempering a double-edged sword with a taper along its length, the tip may reach the proper temperature before the shank does. The smith may need to control the temperature by using methods like pouring water along certain parts of the edge, or cooling it with ice, causing the proper temperature to reach the entire edge at the same time. In this way, although it is less time-consuming than <b>differential</b> <b>hardening</b> with clay, once the process starts the smith must be vigilant, carefully guiding the heat. This leaves little room for error, and mistakes in shaping the hardened zone cannot easily be corrected. This is made even more difficult if the knife or sword has a curve, an odd shape, or a sharply tapered tip. Swords tempered in this manner, especially double-edged swords, will generally need to be rather wide, allowing room for a gradient to form. However differential tempering does not alter the blade's shape.|$|E
50|$|Eventually, {{this process}} was applied to swords and knives, to produce {{mechanical}} effects that were similar to <b>differential</b> <b>hardening,</b> but with some important differences. To differentially temper a blade, it is first quenched to harden the entire blade evenly. The blade is then heated in a localized area, allowing the heat to flow toward the edge. With single-edged blades, the blade may be tempered with fire or a torch. The blade is heated along the spine and tang only, allowing the heat to conduct to the edge. The heat {{will need to be}} applied evenly, allowing the colors to spread evenly across the blade. However, with double-edged blades, the heat source will usually need to be more precisely localized because the heat must be applied evenly along the center of the blade, allowing it to conduct to both edges. Often, a red or yellow-hot bar is used to supply the heat, placing it along the center of the blade, typically fitted into a fuller. Modern gas torches often have the ability to produce very precise flames. To prevent too much heat loss in the blade, it may be preheated, partially insulated, or sandwiched between two red-hot bars. When the proper color reaches the edge, it is immersed in water to stop the process.|$|E
50|$|Having {{a single}} edge {{provides}} certain advantages; one {{being that the}} rest of the sword can be used to reinforce and support the edge. The Japanese style of sword-making takes full advantage of this. When forging is complete, the steel is not quenched in the conventional European fashion (i.e.: uniformly throughout the blade). Steel’s exact flex and strength vary dramatically with heat treating. If steel cools quickly it becomes martensite, which is very hard but brittle. Slower and it becomes pearlite, which bends easily and does not hold an edge. To maximize both the cutting edge and the resilience of the sword spine, a technique of differential heat-treatment is used. In this specific process, referred to as <b>differential</b> <b>hardening</b> or differential quenching, the sword is painted with layers of clay before heating, providing a thin layer or none at all on the edge of the sword, ensuring quick cooling to maximize the hardening for the edge. A thicker layer of clay is applied to the rest of the blade, causing slower cooling. This creates softer, more resilient steel, allowing the blade to absorb shock without breaking. This process is sometimes erroneously called differential tempering but this is actually an entirely different form of heat treatment.|$|E
5000|$|Due to {{the quality}} of metal found in Japan, Japanese bladesmithing became an {{extremely}} rigid, precise process, involving folding and forge-welding the steel many times over to create a laminated blade. By the time of the Kamakura period (1185-1333 AD), Japan was under the rule of a military class and repelling Mongol invasions. This became known as the [...] "Golden era" [...] of Japanese bladesmithing under Emperor Toba II, who became a bladesmith himself. [...] After adbicating, Toba II summoned Japan's finest bladesmiths around him in an effort to develop the perfect sword. [...] It was determined that a sword had to be hard in order to maintain a sharp cutting edge, yet hard steel is brittle and can shatter under the stress of a heavy blow. [...] Swordsmiths in Japan found the solution by wrapping a softer low-carbon steel core such as wrought iron, in a jacket of high-carbon steel and then hardening the edge. [...] However, under heavy usage, the edge would be more prone to chipping than its European counterparts, which were typically designed to deal with heavier armor than Japanese blades. [...] This was answered by allowing projections of softer steel known as ashi to form in the hardened cutting edge during <b>differential</b> <b>hardening</b> of the blade.|$|E
50|$|Typically blades {{are made}} from a {{material}} that is about as hard, though usually harder, than the material to be cut. Insufficiently hard blades {{will be unable to}} cut a material or will wear away quickly as hardness is related to a material's ability to resist abrasion. However, blades must also be tough enough to resist the dynamic load of impact and as a general rule the harder a blade the less tough (the more brittle) a material. For example, a steel axehead is much harder than the wood it is intended to cut and is sufficiently tough to resist the impact resulting when swung against a tree while a ceramic kitchen knife, harder than steel, is very brittle (has low toughness) and can easily shatter if dropped onto the floor or twisted while inside the food it is cutting or carelessly stored under other kitchen utensils. This creates a tension between the intended use of the blade, the material it is to be made from, and any manufacturing processes (such as heat treatment in the case of steel blades that will affect a blade's hardness and toughness. A balance must be found between the sharpness and how well it can last. Methods that can circumvent this include <b>differential</b> <b>hardening.</b> This method yields an edge that can hold its sharpness as well as a body that is tough.|$|E
50|$|At this stage, {{it is only}} {{slightly}} curved or may have no curve at all.

40|$|An {{essential}} {{aspect of}} materials modelling {{in the field}} of metal plasticity is hardening. The classical assumption of isotropic hardening in metal plasticity models is often too simplified to describe actual material behaviour. This paper focuses on the non-isotropic hardening termed <b>differential</b> <b>hardening</b> that is experimentally observed in many commercially available steel sheet materials. Crystal plasticity theory is used to study for a number of single-phase steels the <b>differential</b> <b>hardening</b> effect between uniaxial and equibiaxial loading conditions. We consider both the iso-strain assumption in polycrystal plasticity (Taylor model), and plasticity modelling with heterogeneous strain distribution across the polycrystal (Alamel model). In the latter case, the restriction of stress equilibrium along grain boundaries in selected locations throughout the microstructure dictates the nature and degree of the strain heterogeneity. In view of the potential wide applicability of the modelling approach, it has been chosen to keep the strain hardening law very simple, with only 3 fitting parameters. By doing so, differences in critical resolved shear stress (CRSS) between individual slip systems within a grain cannot be taken into account. Nevertheless, the results show significant improvement in <b>differential</b> <b>hardening</b> prediction by polycrystal plasticity modelling featuring strain heterogeneity over the microstructure, in comparison to results obtained with an iso-strain assumption. The accuracy improvement originates from the loading-dependent response in strain heterogeneity for textured steel materials.
