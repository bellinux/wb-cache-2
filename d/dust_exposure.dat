40|$|Abstract Background To {{evaluate}} pulmonary {{function and}} respiratory symptoms in workers {{engaged in the}} early manufacturing processes of tea and to identify the associated factors, we conducted a study in a tea production area in Taiwan. Methods We recruited tea workers who engaged in the early manufacturing process in the Mountain Ali area in Taiwan and a comparison group of local office workers who were matched for age, gender, and smoking habits. We performed questionnaire interviews, pulmonary function tests, skin prick tests, and measurement of specific IgE for tea on the participants and assessed tea <b>dust</b> <b>exposures</b> in the tea factories. Results The 91 participating tea workers had higher prevalence of respiratory symptoms than the comparison group (32 participants). Among tea workers, ball-rolling workers had the highest prevalence of symptoms and the highest <b>exposures</b> of inhalable <b>dusts.</b> At baseline, tea workers had similar pulmonary functions as the comparison group, but {{compared to the other}} tea workers ball-rolling workers had a lower ratio of the 1 -second forced expiratory volume to forced vital capacity (FEV 1 /FVC) and a lower maximal mid-expiratory flow rate expressed as% of the predicted value [...] MMF (%pred). A total of 58 tea workers participated in the on-site investigation and the cross-shift lung function measurements. We found ball-rolling yielded the highest inhalable dust level, panning yielded the highest respirable dust level, and withering yielded the lowest levels of both dusts. Ball-rolling also yielded the highest coarse fraction (defined as inhalable dusts minus respirable <b>dusts),</b> which represented <b>exposures</b> from nose to tracheobronchial tract. During the shift, we observed significant declines in pulmonary function, especially in ball-rolling workers. Multiple regressions showed that age, height, work tasks, coarse fraction, and number of months working in tea manufacturing each year were independent predictors of certain pulmonary function parameters in tea workers. Conclusions Tea workers engaged in early manufacturing processes of tea have higher prevalence of respiratory symptoms and pulmonary function impairment, which might be related to tea <b>dust</b> <b>exposures,</b> especially the coarse fraction. </p...|$|R

This involves complying with OSHA and MSHA regulations regarding silica exposure, performing air monitoring at the worksite, maintaining engineering controls, substituting less hazardous materials for silica for abrasive blasting operations, and supplying vacuums with high efficiency particulate air filters. Strategies to improve worker health include training them about the health effects of silica, establishing a written respirator program, providing medical evaluations for employees potentially exposed to silica, reporting all silicosis cases to state health departments and the MSHA and recording cases on OSHA logs, and posting warning signs to identify work areas where respirable silica is present. Actions that workers can take to protect themselves include cooperating with their employers to prevent silicosis at the worksite, use of engineering controls installed by the employer for reducing silica dust levels, minimizing <b>dust</b> <b>exposures</b> by following good work and housekeeping practices, wearing, maintaining, and correctly using approved particulate respirators when engineering controls alone cannot reduce silica exposures below permissible levels, using positive pressure abrasive blasting respirators if and when sandblasting is performed, participating in all air monitoring, medical surveillance, and training programs, and talking with the employer, employee representative, or union if concerned about the presence of dust in the workplace.

40|$|ObjectivesWorkers who {{fabricate}} stone countertops using {{hand tools}} {{are at risk}} of silicosis from overexposure to respirable crystalline silica. This study explored the efficacy of simple engineering controls {{that can be used for}} dust suppression during use of hand tools by stone countertop fabricators. MethodsControlled experiments were conducted to measure whether wet methods and on-tool local exhaust ventilation (LEV) reduced respirable <b>dust</b> <b>exposures</b> during use of various powered hand tools on quartz-rich engineered stone. Respirable dust samples collected during edge grinding with a diamond cup wheel and a silicon carbide abrasive wheel were analyzed gravimetrically as well as by x-ray diffraction to determine silica content. A personal optical aerosol monitor was used simultaneously with the respirable dust samples and also for rapid assessment of controls for polishing, blade cutting, and core drilling. ResultsOn-tool LEV and sheet-flow-wetting were effective in reducing exposures, especially when used in combination. Sheet-flow-wetting with LEV reduced geometric mean exposures by as much as 95 %. However, typical water-spray-wetting on a grinding cup was less effective when combined with LEV than without LEV. Mean silica content of respirable dust samples from grinding operations was 53 %, and respirable mass and silica mass were very highly correlated (r = 0. 980). Optical concentration measures were moderately well correlated with gravimetric measures (r = 0. 817), but on average the optical measures during a single trial using the factory calibration were only one-fifth the simultaneous gravimetric measures. ConclusionsSheet-flow-wetting combined with on-tool LEV is an effective engineering control for reducing respirable <b>dust</b> <b>exposures</b> during engineered stone edge grinding and blade cutting. On the other hand, addition of LEV to some water-spray-wetted tools may reduce the effectiveness of the wet method.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2014 Nail salon {{technicians}} {{are potentially}} {{exposed to a}} wide variety of hazardous chemicals including acrylates and solvents in the form of dusts or vapors. Nail salon exposures have been evaluated by a small number of studies and the potential adverse health outcomes have been identified. According to the conducted studies, the possible health outcomes may include respiratory, neurological, and musculoskeletal disorders. The main routes of exposure are considered as inhalation and skin contact while the proximity of the technicians' breathing zone to the chemicals and dust during nail treatments is a reason for concern. Local exhaust ventilation systems can minimize inhalation exposures in nail salons, though few studies have investigated the efficiency of these systems in reducing the exposures. The goals of this study were one; to evaluate four local exhaust ventilation (LEV) systems to determine their effectiveness at eliminating vapors and dust from the breathing zone of nail salon technicians and their clients and two; to assess the overall efficiency of the systems in an isolated static exposure chamber. Four commercially available LEV systems were evaluated for their capture efficiency. For this purpose, acetone vapor and acrylic nail dust were generated at finger level using realistic work activities in a lab setting and exposures measured in the technician's breathing zone using real-time air monitoring. The dust was generated by grinding acrylic nails using a standard salon tool and typical position and duration for the work. The technician's breathing zone <b>dust</b> <b>exposures</b> were measured in real-time using a Thermo PDR- 1500. To assess the solvent capture efficiency, a bowl containing acetone was placed on the table for 10 minutes to simulate the exposure during the acrylic nail removal process. Also, the nails were wiped with an acetone-saturated cotton ball. A MiniRAE 2000 photoionization detector was used to measure the acetone exposure during this process. Each scenario was measured with and without the LEV systems to compare the exposures. To assess the overall efficiency of the systems, acetone decay was measured over time using each system and the "no control" scenario. The Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR) was calculated for each system. Without controls, the average acetone exposure was between 50 and 330 ppm. The different LEV systems were able to decrease the average exposure by at least 77 % and these reductions were statistically significant (p-value< 0. 001). Without controls, the average <b>dust</b> <b>exposures</b> ranged between 10 and 13 ìg/m 3. The different LEV systems were also able to reduce the <b>dust</b> <b>exposures</b> by 67 - 90 % (p-value< 0. 001). The LEV systems can significantly minimize the workers' and most likely their clients' exposures to particles and organic vapors in nail salons. The ability of the systems to reduce technician's exposures during real use will depend on the systems' usability and filter capacity...|$|R
