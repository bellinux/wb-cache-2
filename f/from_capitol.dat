5|$|Weston moved <b>from</b> <b>Capitol</b> to Columbia Records and, in 1950, Stafford {{followed}} suit. Content {{and very}} comfortable working with him, Stafford {{had had a}} clause inserted in her contract with Capitol stating that if Weston left that label, she would automatically be released from her obligations to them. When that happened, Capitol wanted Stafford to record eight more songs before December 15, 1950, and {{she found herself in}} the unusual situation of simultaneously working for two competing record companies, an instance that was very rare in an industry where musicians were seen as assets. In 1954, Stafford became the second artist after Bing Crosby to sell 25 million records for Columbia. She was presented with a diamond-studded disc to mark the occasion.|$|E
25|$|After Mongrel (1970) {{failed to}} live up to the success of Ramblin' Gamblin' Man (1969), The System dissipated. For a short period of time {{following}} the breakup, Seger had ambitions to be a one-man act. In 1971, Seger released his first solo album, the all-acoustic Brand New Morning. The album was a commercial failure and led to Seger's departure <b>from</b> <b>Capitol</b> Records.|$|E

To further this goal, the industrial structures along the riverfront behind it were demolished.|$|E

25|$|Following that, Guest and Mathieson got {{permission}} <b>from</b> <b>Capitol</b> Records {{to create}} a vehicle for Klaatu's songs. They wrote and directed a half-hour television special they titled Happy New Year Planet Earth, hoping that it would get yearly broadcasts {{as an alternative to}} Christmas specials. New Year's Eve was Mathieson's birthday. Again the group Klaatu was photographed and rotoscoped, with an astronaut wraparound created to connect the six Klaatu songs. Although the project was completed, Guest and Mathieson were dropped by their Canadian film investment group and wound up financing it themselves. They never released it.|$|E

In November 2012, an expanded edition of Kisses on the Bottom, subtitled Complete Kisses, was released exclusively on the iTunes store.

One of the bonus tracks, [...] "The Christmas Song (Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire)", was released as a red vinyl single Christmas Kisses and peaked at number 25 on Billboard's Adult Contemporary chart. The track was also featured in a different mix without strings, on the 2012 Christmas compilation album Holidays Rule.|$|E

500|$|In spring 1995, the Foo Fighters {{embarked}} {{on their first}} ever United States tour supporting Mike Watt along with fellow tour newbies Hovercraft, whose line-up included Vedder at the time. As well as performing with their own bands, Grohl and Vedder each picked up a role {{as a member of}} Watt's backing band throughout the tour, supplying drums and guitar respectively. On May 1995, radio stations KROQ-FM and KNDD started playing some tracks of the then-unreleased album before receiving a cease-and-desist <b>from</b> <b>Capitol.</b> That June, [...] "Exhausted" [...] and [...] "This Is a Call" [...] were sent to college and modern rock radio stations. One week later, [...] "This Is a Call" [...] became the band's first commercial single.|$|E

People tuned into the show by accessing iTunes on their PCs or Macintosh computers. The live performance was later released, as Paul McCartney's Live Kisses, directed by Jonas Åkerlund, airing on PBS' Great Performances in September 2012. The performance was released on DVD and Blu-ray on 13 November 2012. In an interview with Billboard, McCartney said that he didn't rule out the possibility of a tour of the album with the musicians who played on it: [...] "We haven't really talked about it yet. People have plenty of ideas and suggestions. I'd like to see how it goes live, just how much we enjoy it. If we all enjoy it, then we've got to think about taking it out." ...|$|E
500|$|On 16 May, Epstein {{responded to}} a request <b>from</b> <b>Capitol</b> Records, EMI's North American counterpart, to supply three new songs for an {{upcoming}} US release, titled Yesterday and Today. Issued on 20 June, this album combined tracks that Capitol had omitted from the Beatles' previous US releases with songs that the band had originally issued on non-album singles. From the six completed recordings for Revolver, Martin selected three Lennon-written songs, since the sessions had favoured his compositions thus far. Keen to limit the interruption to recording that multiple television appearances would create, the Beatles spent two days making promotional films for the [...] "Paperback Writer" [...] single. The first set of clips was filmed at EMI Studio 1 on 19 May by Michael Lindsay-Hogg, director of the popular TV show Ready Steady Go! The following day, the group shot further clips for the two songs in the grounds of Chiswick House, in west London.|$|E
500|$|In early 1964, Wilson {{began his}} {{breakaway}} from beach-themed music. That November, Melody Maker reported that Love {{and the group}} wanted to look beyond surf rock and avoid {{living in the past}} or resting on the band's laurels. When Wilson resigned from touring in order to focus on songwriting and producing, the rest of the band assumed that he would continue making music that their audiences expected of them. [...] Although The Beach Boys Today! and Summer Days (And Summer Nights!!) (both released in 1965) were more sophisticated and elaborate than previous albums, they were still within the realm of acceptability for the band, producing a reasonable level of record sales and chart activity. This was not the case for the next two album projects recorded over 1966 and 1967, where Wilson's bandmates were not entirely supportive of his new creative ambitions. Wilson was also encumbered by pressure <b>from</b> <b>Capitol</b> Records and the group's fanbase. While the band's contemporaries grew more intellectually aware, Capitol continued to bill the Beach Boys as [...] "America’s Top Surfin' Group!", expecting Wilson to write more surfing material for the yearly summer markets, despite his growing disinterest.|$|E

2500|$|Cuccurullo and keyboardist Nick Rhodes {{continued}} to hold Duran Duran together during the band's lean times in the 1990s. [...] The covers album Thank You (1995) {{was an attempt to}} keep the peace among band members who had increasing trouble writing music together. [...] Medazzaland (1997) and Pop Trash (2000)—written after the departure of bassist John Taylor and Duran Duran's separation <b>from</b> <b>Capitol</b> Records—featured mostly new Cuccurullo/Rhodes songs and reworked TV Mania material, but failed to dent the charts even though the band sold out multiple nights in most cities on the 2000/2001 tour.|$|E

At this stage, Ronstadt began working with producer and boyfriend John Boylan. She said, [...] "As soon as I started working with John Boylan, I started co-producing myself. I was always a part of my productions. But I always needed a producer who would carry out my whims."

2500|$|Van Peebles {{turned down}} a large money offer from a record label that wanted him to perform his lyrics over samples of older recordings. Van Peebles said, [...] "That's not what I do! The {{structures}} of my songs are more complicated and subtle than jingles or nursery rhymes, with music which helps carry the story along. The words aren't just shouted over some loop which repeats itself." [...] Van Peebles later received an offer <b>from</b> <b>Capitol</b> Records and told the label [...] "Here's the deal: Send money, and leave me alone. I'll send the tape. That's it. Just go away, and let the doorknob hit you where the good Lord split you."

2500|$|In the United States, Capitol Records printed {{approximately}} 750,000 {{copies of}} Yesterday and Today {{with the same}} photograph as [...] "Paperback Writer". They were assembled in Capitol's four US plants situated in different cities: Los Angeles, California; Scranton, Pennsylvania; Winchester, Virginia; and Jacksonville, Illinois. Numbers designating where the covers originated were printed near the RIAA symbol on the back; for example, stereo copies from the Los Angeles plant are designated [...] "5" [...] and mono Los Angeles copies are marked [...] "6". Mono copies outnumbered stereo copies by about ten to one, making the stereo copies far more rare and valuable to collectors. A {{small fraction of the}} original covers were shipped to disc jockeys and reviewers as advance copies. Reaction was immediate, as Capitol received complaints from some dealers. The record was immediately recalled under orders <b>from</b> <b>Capitol</b> parent company EMI chairman Sir Joseph Lockwood and all copies were ordered shipped back to the record label, leading to its rarity and popularity among collectors.|$|E
2500|$|EMI and Brian Epstein finally {{convinced}} American label Capitol Records, {{a subsidiary}} of EMI, that the Beatles could make an impact in the US, leading {{to the release of}} [...] "I Want to Hold Your Hand" [...] with [...] "I Saw Her Standing There" [...] on the B-side as a single on 26 December 1963. Capitol had previously resisted issuing Beatle recordings in the US. This resulted in the relatively modest Vee-Jay and Swan labels releasing the group's earlier Parlophone counterparts in the US. Seizing the opportunity, Epstein demanded US$40,000 <b>from</b> <b>Capitol</b> to promote the single (the most the Beatles had ever previously spent on an advertising campaign was US$5,000). The single had actually been intended for release in mid-January 1964, coinciding with the planned appearance of the Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Show. However, a 14-year-old fan of the Beatles, Marsha Albert, was determined to get hold of the single earlier. Later she said: ...|$|E
