Considering the speed perspective, the M-84AS moves at 75 km/h on road while the T-90 moves at 60 km/h on road with off road speeds varying according to terrain. The armor on the T-90 is somewhat superior with thicker composites, NBC protection as well as having the option of Active Protection System and KMT mine sweeping systems.

The score banner was changed to match the layout adopted by the network's football coverage {{at the start of}} the 2004 season, but using the abbreviations of the teams playing instead of their logos. Team abbreviations were shown this time in electronic eggcrate lettering in the team's main color, the shaded area above the score banner was removed, and the scores were shown in white text in black parallelograms. Whenever team-specific information was displayed in the banner such as a scored run or an out, the abbreviation would morph into the team logo with the scored run being displayed; the team who would score a run would have its abbreviation morph into its logo and a [...] "strobe light" [...] would flash over the black parallelogram as the score changes. When a home run was displayed in the banner, a split [...] "strobe light" [...] would flash a few times across the banner with the words [...] "HOME RUN (team)" [...] in the team's color then zooming in to the center from both left and right angles, accompanied by two distorted electric buzzes followed by a futuristic computer sounder. This marked the first time that a home run was displayed in the banner.

When it was removed, the banner became <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> beam of light spanning the top of the screen, which would disappear very quickly.|$|E
40|$|SEADS 3. 0, the Sectoral Energy/Employment Analysis and Data System, is a {{revision}} and upgrading of SEADS–PC, a software package {{designed for the}} analysis of policy that could be described by modifying final demands of consumer, businesses, or governments (Roop, et al., 1995). If a question can be formulated so that implications can be translated into changes in final demands for goods and services, then SEADS 3. 0 provides <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> and easy tool to assess preliminary impacts. And SEADS 3. 0 should be considered <b>just</b> that: <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> and easy way to get preliminary results. Often a thorough answer, even to such a simple question as, “What would be the effect on U. S. energy use and employment if the Federal Government doubled R&D expenditures?” requires a more sophisticated analytical framework than the input-output structure embedded in SEADS 3. 0. This tool uses a static, input-output model to assess the impacts of changes in final demands on first industry output, then employment and energy use. The employment and energy impacts are derived by multiplying the industry outputs (derived from the changed final demands) by industry-specific energy and employment coefficients. The tool also allows for the specification of regional or state employment impacts, though this option is not available for energy impacts...|$|R
