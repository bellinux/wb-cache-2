5|$|The {{two main}} {{parts of the}} wreck of Titanic present a {{striking}} contrast. Although fourteen survivors testified that the ship had broken apart as she sank, this testimony was discounted by the official inquiries, and it was supposed that the ship had sunk intact. It {{is now clear that}} the stresses on Titanic caused the ship to split apart between the second and third funnels at or <b>just</b> <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface.</b>|$|E
5|$|In March 2011 an {{assessment}} of the Greyfriars site began to identify where the monastery had stood, and which land might be available for excavation. A desk-based assessment was conducted to determine the archaeological viability of the site, followed by a survey in August 2011 using ground-penetrating radar (GPR). The GPR results were inconclusive; no clear building remains could be identified owing to a layer of disturbed ground and demolition debris <b>just</b> <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface.</b> The survey was useful in finding modern utilities crossing the site, such as pipes and cables.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from their}} blue colour, the mythical creatures {{look much like}} humans, and {{are about the same}} size. They have the power to create storms, but when the weather is fine they float {{sleeping}} on or <b>just</b> <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> of the water. The blue men swim with their torsos raised out of the sea, twisting and diving as porpoises do. They are able to speak, and when a group approaches a ship its chief may shout two lines of poetry to the master of the vessel and challenge him to complete the verse. If the skipper fails in that task then the blue men will attempt to overturn the ship and capsize it.|$|E

5|$|The adult {{stage of}} a caddisfly may only survive for a few weeks; many species do not feed as adults and die soon after breeding, but some species are known to feed on nectar. The winged insects are nocturnal and provide food for night-flying birds, bats, small mammals, {{amphibians}} and arthropods. The larval stage lasts much longer, often for one or more years, and has a bigger impact on the environment. They form {{an important part of}} the diet of fish such as the trout. The fish acquire them by two means, either plucking them off vegetation or the stream-bed as the larvae move about, or during the daily behavioural drift; this drift happens during the night for many species of aquatic larvae, or around midday for some cased caddisfly species, and may result from population pressures or be a dispersal device. The larvae may drift in great numbers either close to the bottom, in mid-water or <b>just</b> <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface.</b> The fish swallow them whole, case and all.|$|E
5|$|Willaumez {{made no move}} to {{challenge}} Stopford or Gambier, although he had successfully united with the Rochefort squadron of three ships of the line, two frigates and an armed storeship, the captured British fourth rate ship Calcutta, commanded by Commodore Gilbert-Amable Faure. Together the French fleet, now numbering 11 ships of the line, withdrew from the relatively open Basque Roads anchorage into the narrow channel under the batteries of the Île-d'Aix known as the Aix Roads. These waters offered greater protection from the British fleet, but were also extremely hazardous; on 26 February, as the French manoeuvred into the shallower waters of their new anchorage the 74-gun Jean-Bart grounded on the Palles Shoal off Île Madame, and was wrecked. The channel in which Willaumez chose to position his fleet formed a strong defensive position: an assailant had to cross the open Basque Roads and advance past the long and dangerous Boyart Shoal hidden <b>just</b> <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface.</b> On entering the channel, an attacking force would then come under fire from fortified gun batteries on Île-d'Aix before finally encountering the French fleet. The anchorage had been successfully attacked before, such as during the Raid on Rochefort in 1757, but more recent efforts in 1803, and 1807 had ended in failure.|$|E

25|$|These fakes are {{detected}} by gemologists using {{a number of}} tests, relying primarily on non-destructive, close examination of surface structure under magnification; a featureless, pale blue background peppered by flecks or spots of whitish material is the typical surface appearance of natural turquoise, while manufactured imitations will appear radically different in both colour (usually a uniform dark blue) and texture (usually granular or sugary). Glass and plastic will have a much greater translucency, with bubbles or flow lines often visible <b>just</b> <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface.</b> Staining between grain boundaries may be visible in dyed imitations.|$|E
25|$|A {{few days}} after mating, a female lays her fertilized eggs on or <b>just</b> <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> of the ground. The eggs hatch {{three to four weeks}} later, and the larvae feed {{until the end of the}} summer. The larvae are {{commonly}} called glowworms (not to be confused with the distinct beetle family Phengodidae or the fly genus Arachnocampa.) Lampyrid larvae have simple eyes. The term glowworm is also used for both adults and larvae of species such as Lampyris noctiluca, the common European glowworm, in which only the nonflying adult females glow brightly and the flying males glow only weakly and intermittently.|$|E
25|$|The Morris water {{navigation}} task is {{a classic}} test for studying spatial learning and memory in rats and was first developed in 1981 by Richard G. Morris for whom the test is named. The subject is placed in a round tank of translucent water with walls that are too high for it to climb out and water that is too deep for it to stand in. Additionally, {{the walls of the}} tank are decorated with visual cues to serve as reference points. The rat must swim around the pool until by chance it discovers <b>just</b> <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> the hidden platform onto which it can climb.|$|E

25|$|Lift {{bags are}} used to bring the load up in stages: a long chain or sling is used to connect the load to a lift bag <b>just</b> <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface,</b> which is filled to break out the load and lift it until the bag reaches the surface, then a second bag is used to bring the load up further. This {{procedure}} continues until the load has been raised sufficiently. Advantages of this method are a more controlled lift, the facility to use a larger capacity for initial breakout without risk of a runaway. Disadvantages include the requirement for divers to work {{on or near the}} lifting gear when under load.|$|E
25|$|Very {{little is}} known about the process of {{quarrying}} the stone and transporting it to the sites of the circles. One exception is at Vestra Fiold in Orkney, where Colin Richards led an excavation that determined that the stones used for the Orcadian stone circles were cut from a horizontal seam of bedrock that was located <b>just</b> <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface.</b> These had been eased over a large pit and supported on stone trestles, after which wooden rollers and a sled were likely positioned underneath, allowing the megalith to be moved. One of these stones, which weighed over 10 tonnes, had been left in its original position poised on stone supports, to be discovered by the archaeological excavators.|$|E
25|$|Vertically mounted {{tubes of}} up to 1-metre {{diameter}} extending from just above {{the base of a}} deep concrete tank to <b>just</b> <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> of the sewage liquor. A typical shaft might be 10 metres high. At the surface end, the tube is formed into a cone with helical vanes attached to the inner surface. When the tube is rotated, the vanes spin liquor {{up and out of the}} cones drawing new sewage liquor from the base of the tank. In many works, each cone is located in a separate cell that can be isolated from the remaining cells if required for maintenance. Some works may have two cones to a cell and some large works may have 4 cones per cell.|$|E
50|$|Bats {{with this}} {{foraging}} style pluck insects off <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> {{of a body}} of water. Piscivores employ the same flight style to catch fish <b>just</b> <b>below</b> <b>the</b> water's <b>surface.</b> Trawling bats travel at slower speeds, {{which means that they}} require low wing loading.|$|R

25|$|Excavations in 2007–2014 in Area 15 of the Gault Site {{specifically}} targeted {{an occupation}} predating Clovis, evidence {{of which had}} been seen in two test units dug in 2002 and 2007. The excavation of a large block of Area 15 (48 square meters) penetrated 3.5 meters from the surface to bedrock through culture-bearing alluvial fill eventually exposing 12 square meters at bedrock. Unexpectedly, part of this area had escaped the looting and collecting and had intact archaeology <b>just</b> <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface.</b> Physical and cultural stratigraphic evidence as well as luminescence dating are consistent in showing a coherent sequence of lithic material evidencing this older occupation followed by Clovis, Late PaleoIndian, Early Archaic, and Middle/Late Archaic occupations over an apparent span of more than 16,000 calendar years.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two types}} of {{underground}} dams: a sub-surface and a sand-storage dam. A sub-surface dam is built across an aquifer or drainage route from an impervious layer (such as solid bedrock) up to <b>just</b> <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface.</b> They can be constructed of a variety of materials to include bricks, stones, concrete, steel or PVC. Once built, the water stored behind the dam raises the water table and is then extracted with wells. A sand-storage dam is a weir built in stages across a stream or wadi. It must be strong, as floods will wash over its crest. Over time, sand accumulates in layers behind the dam, which helps store water and, most importantly, prevent evaporation. The stored water can be extracted with a well, through the dam body, or by means of a drain pipe.|$|E
