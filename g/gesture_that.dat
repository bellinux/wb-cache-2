5|$|Burrows was {{the closest}} friend on the Canucks to former {{teammate}} Luc Bourdon, {{who died in a}} motorcycle accident in May 2008. In the hockey season following his death, Burrows occasionally celebrated goals with a bow-and-arrow mime, a <b>gesture</b> <b>that</b> Bourdon himself did after scoring during his junior career. He and his wife (girlfriend at the time) remained close to Bourdon's girlfriend, Charlene Ward.|$|E
5|$|Following this success, Jackson {{began to}} direct several {{personal}} insults at Silva, a <b>gesture</b> <b>that</b> infuriated the champion. Silva {{was in the}} midst of what would be a 17-fight unbeaten streak. He captured the championship from Sakuraba at Pride 17, and defeated him a total of three times. Jackson continued his negative comments towards the champion, and directed his latest insult at Silva's training camp at the time, the Chute Boxe Academy.|$|E
5|$|The Borobudur reliefs {{also pay}} close {{attention}} to Indian aesthetic discipline, such as pose and <b>gesture</b> <b>that</b> contain certain meanings and aesthetic value. The reliefs of noblemen, and noble women, kings, or divine beings such as apsaras, taras and boddhisattvas are usually portrayed in tribhanga pose, the three-bend pose on neck, hips, and knee, with one leg resting and one upholding the body weight. This position is considered as the most graceful pose, such as the figure of Surasundari holding a lotus.|$|E

5|$|After {{thirteen}} months, poverty forced Johnson {{to leave}} Oxford {{without taking a}} degree, and he returned to Lichfield. During his last weeks at Oxford, Jorden left Pembroke, and Johnson was given William Adams as a tutor in his place. He enjoyed Adams as a tutor, but by December, Johnson was already a quarter behind in his student fees, and {{he was forced to}} return home. He left behind many of the books that his father had previously lent him, both because he could not afford the expense of transporting all of them and as a symbolic <b>gesture</b> <b>that</b> he hoped to return to the school soon.|$|E
5|$|All {{seven of}} Angelou's {{installments}} {{of her life}} story are {{in the tradition of}} African-American autobiography. Starting with I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, Angelou challenges the usual structure of the autobiography by critiquing, changing, and expanding the genre. Angelou said in 1989 that she is the only serious writer to choose autobiography to express herself, but she reports not one person's story, but the collective's. Scholar Selwyn R. Cudjoe writes that Angelou is representative of the convention in African-American autobiography as a public <b>gesture</b> <b>that</b> speaks for an entire group of people. Her use of devices common in fictional writing, such as dialog, characterization and thematic development, has led some reviewers to categorize her books as autobiographical fiction.|$|E
5|$|In {{the smaller}} painting, Mary averts {{her eyes and}} folds her hands in a <b>gesture</b> <b>that</b> symbolised {{submission}} to God's will. Mary is not submissive, however, in the larger piece. The girl, interrupted in her reading by this unexpected messenger, puts a finger in her bible to mark the place and raises her hand in a formal gesture of greeting or surprise. This calm young woman appears to accept her role as the Mother of God, not with resignation but with confidence. In this painting, the young Leonardo presents the humanist face of the Virgin Mary, recognising humanity's role in God's incarnation.|$|E

During the ceremony, Katniss delivers an impromptu, heartfelt speech expressing her feelings toward Rue and also Thresh, who spared her life. When she finishes, an old man whistles the tune that Rue used in the arena to tell Katniss that she was safe. Everyone else salutes Katniss, using the same <b>gesture</b> <b>that</b> {{she used to say}} farewell to Rue. To Katniss's horror, the old man is quickly executed before her eyes.|$|E
5|$|Vithoba {{is shown}} {{standing}} arms-akimbo on the brick thrown by the devotee Pundalik. He wears {{a necklace of}} tulsi-beads, embedded with the legendary kaustubha gem, and makara-kundala (fish-shaped earrings) that the poet-saint Tukaram relates to the iconography of Vishnu. Pandharpur's Vithoba holds a shankha (conch) {{in his left hand}} and a chakra (discus) or lotus flower in his right, all of which are symbols traditionally associated with Vishnu. Some images depict Vithoba's right hand making a <b>gesture</b> <b>that</b> has been traditionally misunderstood as a blessing; no gesture of blessing is present in the Pandharpur image. Though usually depicted two-armed, four-armed representations of the deity also exist.|$|E
5|$|The Megans are {{determined}} to put humanity and the Enterprise crew on trial for what humans did to their people during the Salem witch-trials as well as Lucien for bringing them here. Kirk comes out in support of Lucien's life and says that killing him would make the Megans just like humans. Lucien's punishment is to be condemned into limbo for eternity for bringing humans into the Megans' world. While Kirk states that humanity has progressed infinitely since 1691, the Megans ignore his words. At {{the end of the}} trial, Kirk offers his life to save Lucien's and the Megans are so impressed by the captain's <b>gesture</b> <b>that</b> they spare Lucien, and tell the Enterprise that they would welcome future human visits to their planet. They also return the Enterprise to its proper universe, while Lucien is revealed to be Lucifer.|$|E

25|$|It is {{difficult}} to sign Auslan fluently while speaking English, as the word order is different, and there is often no direct sign-to-word equivalence. However, mouthing of an English word together with a sign may serve to clarify when one sign may have several English equivalents. In some cases the mouth <b>gesture</b> <b>that</b> accompanies a sign may not reflect the equivalent translation in English (e.g. a sign meaning 'thick' may {{be accompanied by a}} mouthed 'fahth').|$|E

25|$|This {{proposed}} {{amendment was}} intended to give Congress the right to enact statutes criminalizing the burning or other desecration of the United States flag in a public protest. Proponents of legislation to proscribe flag burning argue that burning the flag is a very offensive <b>gesture</b> <b>that</b> deserves to be outlawed. Opponents maintain that giving Congress such power would essentially limit the principle of freedom of speech, enshrined in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and symbolized by the flag itself.|$|E
25|$|To some Westerners (Italians and Spaniards are notable exceptions) it {{may seem}} as if the maneki-neko is waving rather than beckoning. This {{is due to the}} {{difference}} in gestures and body language recognized by some Westerners and the Japanese. The Japanese beckoning gesture is made by holding up the hand, palm down, and repeatedly folding the fingers down and back, thus the cat's appearance. Some maneki-neko made specifically for some Western markets will have the cat's paw facing upwards, in a beckoning <b>gesture</b> <b>that</b> is more familiar to most Westerners.|$|E

His right hand is raised and his finger extended to point towards the lamb, a <b>gesture</b> <b>that</b> implies that he is reciting the Agnus Dei. John the Evangelist holds a chalice, a reference to the early medieval tradition that he had ability with cures; he could drink poison from a cup without ill effects.|$|E

25|$|The {{first phase}} of the feminist {{movement}} is considered to have taken place between (1923‚Äì1939). The Egyptian Feminist Union (EFU) was founded by the former leader of the women's committee in the Wafd party, Hoda Shaarawi. This led to her participation in an international Feminist Conference in Rome and upon her return, along with Nabawiyya Musa and Ceza Nabarwi, Shaarawi caused outrage in the <b>gesture</b> <b>that</b> she made against the Egyptian authorities and traditions by throwing her veil into the sea.
