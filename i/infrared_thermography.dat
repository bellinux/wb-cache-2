25|$|Pro-authenticity {{journals}} {{have declared}} this hypothesis to be unsound, stating that X-ray fluorescence examination, {{as well as}} <b>infrared</b> <b>thermography,</b> did not reveal any pigment. It was also found that 25 different solvents, among them water, do not reduce or sponge out the image. The Shroud Center of Colorado argues that paint pigments came from painted copies that were overlaid by artists during the Middle Ages in order to validate them as accurate copies of the Shroud. The non-paint origin has been further examined by Fourier transform of the image: common paintings show a directionality that is absent from the Turin Shroud. However, analyzing fragments of the shroud brought to the US, McCrone and others observed the presence of pigments, of types commonly used in medieval paints, on the shroud.|$|E
