25|$|One {{study found}} that during {{atomization}} biodiesel and its blends produced droplets were greater in diameter than the droplets produced by traditional petrodiesel. The smaller droplets were attributed to the lower viscosity and surface tension of traditional petrol. It was found that droplets at {{the periphery of the}} spray pattern were larger in diameter than the droplets at the center this was attributed to the faster pressure drop {{at the edge of the}} spray pattern; there was a proportional relationship between the droplet size and the distance from the injector tip. It was found that B100 had the greatest spray penetration, this was attributed to the greater density of B100. Having a greater droplet size can lead to; inefficiencies in the combustion, increased emissions, and decreased horse power. In another study it was found that there is a short <b>injection</b> <b>delay</b> when injecting biodiesel. This <b>injection</b> <b>delay</b> was attributed to the greater viscosity of Biodiesel. It was noted that the higher viscosity and the greater cetane rating of biodiesel over traditional petrodiesel lead to poor atomization, as well as mixture penetration with air during the ignition delay period. Another study noted that this ignition delay may aid in a decrease of NOx emission.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to investigate the effects of fuel properties on the spray characteristics of a common-rail type marine diesel injector. Spray characteristics are highly influential in determining engine performance and emission characteristics in direct-injection engine systems containing marine diesel engines. Thus, the relationship between the physical properties of HFO fuel and its spray characteristics is investigated via an analysis of HFO and spray experiments. Data from physical property measurements (e. g., fuel density, dynamic viscosity, and surface tension) are used to derive empirical equations between fuel temperatures and physical properties, and the results follow the common tendencies of temperature-property curves for general liquid substances. In spray experiments, injection quantity measurements, injection rate profiles, and spray visualization were conducted under various injection pressures, energizing durations, and ambient pressures. The test temperatures of HFO were set from the results of physical property measurements. Experimental data reveal that spray characteristics are affected by fuel properties in terms of <b>injection</b> <b>delays,</b> <b>injection</b> profiles, and spray development speed. The injection quantity increased proportionally with fuel densities and the onset of <b>injection</b> was <b>delayed</b> with increased dynamic viscosity.

40|$|Water-assisted {{injection}} molding (WAIM) {{is one of}} the latest techniques to produce hollow or partly hollow plastic parts. With advantages like a faster cycle time, flexibility in design, less warpage and shrinkage and a better surface finish, WAIM overcomes its better known competitor gas assisted {{injection molding}} (GAIM). However, the molding window and the process control become more difficult so that the tooling and the mold process design will be more complicated. In that way the experience of the conventional molding process is no longer sufficient. This study investigates the influence of the melt and process parameters on the product quality of water-assisted injection molded tubes, using a design of experiments. This DOE is carried out with two different melts (PP and HDPE) and five process parameters (water hold time, water <b>injection</b> <b>delay</b> time, flow rate, mold and melt temperature) that vary at three levels. The residual wall thickness and the part weight will serve as response functions to determine the part quality combined with a visual inspection of the part surface.

The technique is designed to work with an operational diesel engine having readily accessible glow-plug ports. The optical adapter designed for use through the glow-plug port is used as both the transmitting port for the excitation signal and the receiving port for the fluorescence signal. The prototype system was installed on a Detroit Diesel 3 – 53 two-stroke diesel engine. The beginning of the injection cycle is measured by a proximity probe set to detect injector compression {{to the point where the}} injector chamber is sealed. The actual entry of fuel into the cylinder is measured using laser induced fluorescence of an organic laser dye seeded fuel, excited by a 532 -nm laser. The time/crank angle delay from the start of fuel compression to fuel entry into the cylinder can then be correlated to bulk modulus and cetane number. The combustion event can also be detected using the same optics and its timing correlated with known fuel properties. Lieutenant, United States Nav...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Plasmodium and Schistosoma {{are two of}} {{the most}} common parasites in {{tropical}} areas. Deregulation of the immune response to Plasmodium falciparum, characterized by a Th 1 response, leads to cerebral malaria (CM), while a Th 2 response accompanies chronic schistosomiasis. Methods The development of CM was examined in mice with concomitant Schistosoma mansoni and Plasmodium berghei ANKA infections. The effect of S. mansoni egg antigen injection on disease development and survival was also determined. Cytokine serum levels were estimated using ELISA. Statistical analysis was performed using t-test. Results The results demonstrate that concomitant S. mansoni and P. berghei ANKA infection leads to a reduction in CM. This effect is dependent on infection schedule and infecting cercariae number, and is correlated with a Th 2 response. Schistosomal egg antigen <b>injection</b> <b>delays</b> the death of Plasmodium-infected mice, indicating immune involvement. Conclusions This research supports previous claims of a protective effect of helminth infection on CM development. The presence of multiple parasitic infections in patients from endemic areas should therefore be carefully noted in clinical trials, and in the development of standard treatment protocols for malaria.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This {{report was}} carried out to study {{experimentally}} the water-assisted injection molding process of glass fiber-reinforced polyamide- 6 (Nylon- 6) composites. Experiments were carried out on an 80 ton injection molding machine equipped with a lab scale water injection system, which included a water pump, a water injection pin, a pressure accumulator, a water tank equipped with a temperature regulator, and a control circuit. The materials used were Nylon and 30 % glass fiber-filled Nylon composites. A spiral mold cavity was used to mold the composites. After molding, the lengths of water penetration in molded parts were measured. The effects of different processing parameters on the lengths of water penetration were determined: melt temperature, mold temperature, melt-filling speed, short-shot size, water pressure, water temperature, water hold, and water <b>injection</b> <b>delay</b> time. Mechanical property tests were performed on the water-assisted injection molded parts. X-ray diffraction was also employed to identify the structural parameters of the materials. In addition, the in-mold temperature distribution of the polymeric materials during the cooling process was measured.

Nevertheless, its effects on the tensile properties of molded materials were relatively limited.

A prominent clinical feature of ALS is muscle weakness due to dysfunction, denervation and degeneration of motoneurons (MNs). While MN degeneration is a late stage event in the ALS mouse model, muscle denervation occurs significantly earlier in the disease. Strategies to prevent this early denervation may improve quality of life by maintaining muscle control and slowing disease progression. The precise cause of MN dysfunction and denervation is not known, but several mechanisms have been proposed that involve potentially toxic intra- and extracellular changes. Many cells confront these changes by mounting a stress response that includes increased expression of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp 70).
