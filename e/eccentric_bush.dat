40|$|Previous {{modelling}} and {{numerical simulation}} {{has determined that}} potential exists to improve the low load efficiency of spark ignition engines {{through the application of}} variable compression ratio (VCR) in conjunction with other engine control technology. A large proportion of the potential efficiency gains can be achieved using a stepped change in compression ratio. One mechanism that can achieve this is an <b>eccentric</b> <b>bush</b> (eccentric) operated in the big-end of the connecting-rod. The natural dynamics associated with the motion of the crankshaft and connecting rod can potentially move the eccentric in the required manner. The present work aims to identify whether this is a practical means to shift the position of the eccentric. Matlab simulations of the dynamic performance of the eccentric in various simulated engine operating conditions have been performed. An experimental eccentric was also operated in a motored engine to: (1) assess its performance, and (2) compare with, and validate the modelling. Further comparisons with commercial dynamics analysis software tools are also presented. The results show that when operated within limited bounds of engine speed and oil viscosity, the eccentric can be moved in the required manner by the dynamics of the engine component motion. For application as a practical mechanism, the eccentric suffers from a very high sensitivity to its bearing surfaces friction regimes. The mixed friction which results from low speed or high bearing loads prevents the required rotation of the eccentric. In a practical sense, the motion of the eccentric does not provide the consistency over the operating range of an internal combustion engine to employ it as a VCR technology...|$|E

50|$|The III {{is powered}} by an aluminium-alloy V12 engine of 447inÂ³ (7.32L), having a bore of 3.25 inches (82.5 mm) and a stroke of 4.5 inches (114.3 mm). It is a pushrod engine with {{overhead}} valves operated by a single camshaft in the valley between the cylinder banks. Early cars had hydraulic tappets or, rather, a unique system of eccentric bushings in each individual rocker that was actuated by a small hydraulic piston; the <b>eccentric</b> <b>bushing</b> ensuring zero valve-lash at the rocker/valve interface. This system was changed to solid adjustable tappets in 1938. The Phantom III is unusual for its twin ignition systems, with two distributors, two coils and 24 spark plugs. Petrol is provided by a twin SU electric pump. Wire wheels are fitted as standard, but many cars carry Ace wheel discs which were fitted to improve cosmetics and to reduce the time taken to clean the wire wheels after use.|$|R
