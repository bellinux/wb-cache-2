The study presents the feasibility of using CMOS technology for design and characterisation of radio front-ends at W-band (75 - 110 GHz). The design of active and passive components, such as transmission lines and transistor layout, are discussed in more detail for this purpose. The designed circuit components in this work, for instance phase shifters and amplifiers, are used to realise a phased-array transmitter front-end. Design of the phase shifter and amplifier is carried out with a 1 -V supply in 28 nm CMOS. The phase shifter is a differential vector-sum phase shifter with two control voltages realised in the 0. 552 mm 2 die area. When the control voltages are changed, a 90 ° phase resolution is generated which is suitable for an array having four antenna elements. After a suitable phase shift is generated by the phase shifter, the amplifier is used for signal amplification which has a reasonable noise figure as a <b>differential</b> <b>buffer</b> amplifier. The die size of the amplifier is 0. 36 mm 2. In order to manufacture the phased-array transmitter front-end, all passives such as the DC and 50 -Ω signal lines and pads, embedded resistors, waveguide transition and antenna-array are fabricated by low temperature co-fired ceramic (LTCC) technology.

Several receiver architectures [1, 2 & 3] based on the principle of correlation has been proposed, with Quadrature Downconversion Auto-Correlation Receiver (QDAcR) [3] being one of them. This thesis work builds up further on the generalized QDAcR model of [3], starting with an advanced time domain analysis of principle of Downconversion in QDAcR and exploring the dependency of QDAcR on downconverter related stochastic perturbations such as phase noise, jitter and amplitude perturbations. The use of Stationary Stochastic Process Theory, Fokker-Planck Equation and Floquet’s Theory resulted in a simplified equation, incorporating the effect of stochastic perturbations; this equation of prominence, further can be extrapolated to perturbation analysis of Zero (low) – IF receivers. A complete system modeling of QDAcR downconverter resulted in vital specifications for the QDAcR downconverter being the requirement of a 5. 6 GHz quadrature voltage controlled oscillator (QVCO) with a minimum phase noise of - 90 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset and with a maximum permissible phase error of 4 degrees. This relaxed nature of specifications has opened a plethora of trade-offs.

40|$|The Time Projection Chamber (TPC) {{signal readout}} of the ALICE {{detector}} is being upgraded {{to accommodate the}} higher collision rates and -energies during LHC Run 3 in 2018. Due to the increased collision rates, the TPC drift time of about 100 μs will be 5 times longer than the average time between interactions, rendering the presently employed gating of the TPC wire-chambers insufficient. Therefore, a Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) based system will be replacing the wire-chambers. In addition, the front-end electronics {{need to be replaced}} to match the new readout chamber technology and increased data rates. This will be done by the new SAMPA chip which combines the functionality of the previous PASA (PreAmplifier ShAper) and ALTRO (ALICE TPC ReadOut) chips currently used as front-end electronics. The focus of this work has been twofold: (1) Characterizing a SAMPA Chip 1 analog prototype for use in the upgraded ALICE TPC signal readout. (2) Construct and characterize a GEM detector prototype for use with the SAMPA Chip 1. A fully <b>differential</b> <b>buffer</b> has been designed and mounted on the Chip 1 carrier board for ADC readout capabilities. The buffer performed well and the ADC readout was successful. The power consumption of the SAMPA Chip 1 failed to reach the requirement of 6 mW per channel, achieving no better than ~ 9 mW per channel at the nominal supply voltage. Results from the gain and pulse shape stability showed linear gain and a stable pulse shape, with some deviations for low and high input charges as a result of poor signal-to-noise ratio and the amplifier saturating, respectively. The crosstalk measurement showed scattered results, but none of the carrier boards achieved the requirement of less than 0. 2 %. The best crosstalk results averaged ~ 0. 3 %, while the worst exceeded 1 %. Simulated noise for the SAMPA Chip 1 doesn’t fulfill the requirement of 385 ENC at 12 pF capacitance. When corrected for stray capacitances on the carrier boards, the measured noise coincided to some extent with the simulated values. The high noise levels seem to originate from the inside the SAMPA ASIC. A GEM detector has been designed and produced in close collaboration with the group stationed at the Wigner Research Institute in Budapest, Hungary. Testing of the GEM detector has been done at the Wigner Institute using both Fe- 55 and Sr- 90 radioactive sources, measuring the energy resolution of the detector and calibrating its gain. The gain was set to ~ 2000 and the energy resolution was measured to be ~ 8 %, which is below the 12 % requirement.

40|$|Successive {{structural}} changes of bacteriophage l upon heating were characterized with quantitative experimental methods. In the commonly used Tris-Mg <b>buffer,</b> <b>differential</b> scanning calorimetry measurements first {{established that the}} protein capsid of l phage melts at 87 uC and its genomic DNA melts at 91 uC. Interestingly, prior to the capsid melting, lDNA was found to escape out of the capsid and subject to DNase digestion above* 68 uC, as concluded from light scattering, UV absorption, and electron microscopy studies. Further investigations indicated distinct temperature-dependent behaviors of the three phage proteins. Around 68 uC, disruption of the tail first occurs and leads to the escape of l DNA; above the capsid melting temperature of 87 uC, the auxiliary protein gpD of the phage head remains soluble in solution and resists centrifugal sedimentation, whereas the major capsid protein gpE is easily precipitated and likely exists as aggregates...|$|R
