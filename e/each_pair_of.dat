5|$|Noisy {{binary search}} {{algorithms}} solve {{the case where}} the algorithm cannot reliably compare elements of the array. For <b>each</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> elements, {{there is a certain}} probability that the algorithm makes the wrong comparison. Noisy binary search can find the correct position of the target with a given probability that controls the reliability of the yielded position. The noisy binary search problem can be considered as a case of the Rényi-Ulam game, which Alfréd Rényi introduced in 1961.|$|E

Phase errors in the encoded bits generated by the imperfection is reduced by either concatenation of the decoherence free subspace with 3 -qubit quantum error correcting code that corrects only phase errors or concatenation of the decoherence free subspace with 2 -qubit quantum error detecting code that detects only phase errors and quantum Zeno effect again...|$|R

5|$|Built in 1897, it {{is a rare}} {{surviving}} {{example of}} a late Victorian orangery in the Classical style, constructed from ashlar and red brick. It has a seven-bay east/west plan with central entrances and three bays north/south, topped by a fully glazed ironwork hipped-roof. An entablature with protruding horizontal geison sits above Ionic half-column supports and corner pilasters. The centre entrance bay on the west front towards the kitchen garden breaks forward as a portico, with pairs of giant engaged columns and broken pediment with a small oculus. Between <b>each</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> columns are large round-headed windows with Gibbs surrounds and keystones.|$|E
5|$|<b>Each</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> antennas was {{connected}} to a motorized switch that rapidly switched between the pairs, a technique known as lobe switching. Both signals were then sent to a cathode ray tube (CRT) for display, {{with one of them}} passing through a voltage inverter. If the target was to the left, the display would show a longer blip on the left than the right. When the target was dead ahead, the blips would be equal length. There was an inherently limited accuracy to such a solution, about five degrees but it was a practical solution in terms of limiting the antenna sizes.|$|E

5|$|Gender roles, {{especially}} {{the figure of}} the ideal woman, are central to La Cousine Bette. The four leading female characters (Bette, Valérie, Adeline, and Hortense) embody stereotypically feminine traits. <b>Each</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> women revolves around a man, and they compete for his attention: Valérie and Adeline for Baron Hulot; Bette and Hortense for Wenceslas Steinbock. Balzac's study of masculinity is limited to the insatiable lust of Hulot and the weak-willed inconstancy of Steinbock, with the occasional appearance of Victorin as a sturdy patriarch in his father's absence.|$|E
5|$|In a real vector space, a {{non-empty}} setQ {{is defined}} to be convex if, for <b>each</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> its points, every {{point on the}} line segment that joins them is a subset ofQ. For example, a solid disk is convex but a circle is not, {{because it does not}} contain a line segment joining its points; the non-convex set of three integers{0,1,2} is contained in the interval, which is convex. For example, a solid cube is convex; however, anything that is hollow or dented, for example, a crescent shape, is non-convex. The emptyset is convex, either by definition or vacuously, depending on the author.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to completeness of injury, {{the location of}} damage on the spinal cord influences how much sexual function is retained or regained after injury. Injuries can occur in the cervical (neck), thoracic (back), lumbar (lower back), or sacral (pelvic) levels. Between <b>each</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> vertebrae, spinal nerves branch off of the spinal cord and carry information to and from specific parts of the body. The location of injury to the spinal cord maps to the body, and the area of skin innervated by a specific spinal nerve, is called a dermatome. All dermatomes {{below the level of}} injury to the spinal cord may lose sensation.|$|E

5|$|Like other nodosaurids, Sauropelta {{was covered}} in armor formed from bony masses {{embedded}} in the skin (osteoderms). The discovery of a skeleton with the body armor preserved in situ allowed Carpenter and other scientists to accurately describe this protection. Two parallel rows of domed scutes ran down {{the top of the}} neck, along the anteroposterior axis (front to back). On the upper surface of the back and tail, the skin {{was covered in}} small, bony nodules (ossicles), which separated larger conical scutes arranged in parallel rows along the mediolateral axis (side to side). Over the hips, the ossicles and larger domed plates were interlocked very tightly to form a structure called a sacral shield. This shield is also found in ankylosaurs like Polacanthus and Antarctopelta. Large, pointed spines lined the sides of the neck, increasing in size towards the shoulders, and then decreasing in size again {{along the side of the}} body until they stopped just before the hips. Behind the hips, flat triangular plates lined the tail on both sides, pointing laterally (outwards) and decreasing in size towards the end of the tail. Carpenter originally described the cervical (neck) spines and caudal plates as belonging to a single row on each side, although more recently he and Jim Kirkland reconstructed them in two parallel rows on each side, one above the other. The upper row of cervical spines pointed backwards and upwards (posterodorsally), while the lower row pointed backwards and outwards (posterolaterally). The bases of <b>each</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> cervical spines and <b>each</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> caudal plates were fused together, greatly restricting mobility in both the neck and upper tail.|$|E
5|$|Plastromancy: The {{earliest}} use of turtle shells {{comes from}} the archaeological site in Jiahu site. The shells, containing small pebbles of various size, colour and quantity, were drilled with small holes, suggesting that <b>each</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> them was tied together originally. Similar finds have also {{been found in the}} Dawenkou burial sites of about 4000–3000 BC, as well as in Henan, Sichuan, Jiangsu and Shaanxi. The turtle-shell shakers for the most part are made of the shell of land turtles, identified as Cuora flavomarginata. Archaeologists believe that these shells were used either as rattles in ceremonial dances, shamantic healing tools or ritual paraphernalia for divinational purposes.|$|E
5|$|Similar {{applications}} of 2-satisfiability {{have been made}} for other geometric placement problems. In graph drawing, if the vertex locations are fixed and each edge must be drawn as a circular arc with one of two possible locations (for instance as an arc diagram), then the problem of choosing which arc to use for each edge {{in order to avoid}} crossings is a 2-satisfiability problem with a variable for each edge and a constraint for <b>each</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> placements that would lead to a crossing. However, in this case it is possible to speed up the solution, compared to an algorithm that builds and then searches an explicit representation of the implication graph, by searching the graph implicitly.|$|E

5|$|At Euston, major {{reconstruction}} {{works were}} undertaken {{to incorporate the}} new Victoria line platforms so that cross-platform interchanges could be provided with the Northern line's Bank branch—the former C route to King's Cross and Bank. Unlike the former CCE platforms, which were in separate tunnels with side platforms, the Bank branch tracks served an island platform in a single large tunnel. These platforms suffered from dangerous overcrowding at peak times. To provide cross-platform interchange, a new section of tunnel was constructed for northbound Bank branch trains, which were diverted to a new platform south of the original alignment. The redundant northbound track bed in the station tunnel was filled in to form a wider southbound platform. The new Victoria line platforms were excavated between and parallel to the original and the new Bank branch tunnels. <b>Each</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> platforms was linked via a concourse served by escalators.|$|E
5|$|Important rituals {{such as the}} {{dedication}} of major building projects or the enthronement of a new ruler required a human offering. The sacrifice of an enemy king was the most prized offering, and such a sacrifice involved decapitation of the captive ruler in a ritual reenactment of the decapitation of the Maya maize god by the Maya death gods. In AD 738, the vassal king K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat of Quiriguá captured his overlord, Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil of Copán {{and a few days}} later he ritually decapitated him; The decapitation of an enemy king may have been performed as part of a ritual ballgame reenacting the victory of the Maya Hero Twins over the gods of the underworld. Sacrifice by decapitation is depicted in Classic period Maya art, and sometimes took place after the victim was tortured, being variously beaten, scalped, burnt or disembowelled. The Hero Twins myth recounted in the Popol Vuh relates how one of <b>each</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> twins was decapitated by their ballgame opponents.|$|E
5|$|The angles made by <b>each</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> arcs at {{the corners}} of a Reuleaux {{triangle}} are all equal to 120°. This is the sharpest possible angle at any vertex of any curve of constant width. Additionally, among the curves of constant width, the Reuleaux triangle is the one with both the largest and the smallest inscribed equilateral triangles. The largest equilateral triangle inscribed in a Reuleaux triangle is the one connecting its three corners, and the smallest one is the one connecting the three midpoints of its sides. The subset of the Reuleaux triangle consisting of points belonging to three or more diameters is the interior of the larger of these two triangles; it has a larger area than the set of three-diameter points of any other curve of constant width.|$|E

5|$|The two {{roots of}} any {{quadratic}} equation {{may be of}} three possible types: two different real numbers, two identical real numbers (i.e., a degenerate double root), or a pair of complex conjugate roots. The first case corresponds to the usual situation; <b>each</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> roots corresponds {{to a pair of}} solutions that are related by circle inversion, as described below (Figure6). In the second case, both roots are identical, corresponding to a solution circle that transforms into itself under inversion. In this case, one of the given circles is itself a solution to the Apollonius problem, and the number of distinct solutions is reduced by one. The third case of complex conjugate radii does not correspond to a geometrically possible solution for Apollonius' problem, since a solution circle cannot have an imaginary radius; therefore, the number of solutions is reduced by two. Interestingly, Apollonius' problem cannot have seven solutions, although it may have any other number of solutions from zero to eight.|$|E
5|$|According to Cockerell, {{the side}} of the façade that is to the south of the central door is the more sacred and the scheme is divided accordingly. The lowest range of niches each {{contained}} a standing figure, of which all but four figures on the west front, two on each side, have been destroyed. More have survived on the northern and eastern sides of the north tower. Cockerell speculates that those to the south of the portal represented prophets and patriarchs of the Old Testament while those to the north represented early missionaries to Britain, of which Augustine of Canterbury, St Birinus, and Benedict Biscop are identifiable by their attributes. In the second zone, above <b>each</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> standing figures, is a quatrefoil containing a half-length angel in relief, some of which have survived. Between the gables of the niches are quatrefoils that contain a series of narratives from the Bible, with the Old Testament stories to the south, above the prophets and patriarchs, and those from the New Testament to the north. A horizontal course runs around the west front dividing the architectural storeys at this point.|$|E
5|$|Later that night, Hancock is shot {{twice in}} the chest and wounded when he foils a liquor store robbery. After being hospitalized, Mary enters and {{explains}} that as <b>each</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> immortals pair up, they begin to lose their powers and live out the remainder of their lives as ordinary humans, growing old and eventually dying. She then begins to point out various scars that Hancock has acquired over the centuries, the result of his normally heroic nature. She also explains that Hancock was savagely attacked in an alley 80 years prior, which caused his amnesia. In each instance, Mary chose to leave him in order for him to regain his powers and recover from his injuries. However, upon discovering he had no memory, Mary couldn't handle it and left. The conversation is interrupted when the hospital is raided by Red Parker, and two men that Hancock had humiliated during his incarceration. Mary is caught in the cross-fire and is mortally wounded. Hancock is able to stop and kill the two men but suffers additional injuries in the process. When Red attempts to finish Hancock off, Ray comes to the rescue and kills the bank robber with a fire axe. With Mary dying, Hancock flees the hospital so their parting will allow her to heal with her own powers. He makes several clumsy leaps away from the hospital, each of longer distance and duration as his powers slowly return, until he finally is able to fly off into the night. He later takes up residence in New York City. Ray is seen walking with Mary and their son discussing historical events such as the reign of Attila the Hun in a jovial manner. In gratitude to Ray, Hancock has painted Ray's All-Heart logo on the moon and calls the spokesperson to look up to view the worldwide advertisement.|$|E
