By 1958 the corporation was specializing in three areas of production: book papers, business papers and school supply papers. The Allied book paper lines then included grades from the thinnest bible paper to heavy book paper for novels. Business papers include forms, mimeo, duplication and <b>offset</b> <b>for</b> <b>reproduction</b> machines, bond, carbon insets and special coated papers for electrostatic office copiers. School supply papers include notebook filler, construction and drawing paper, pads, envelopes and reproduction and typing papers. Also in early 1957 Allied announced they would build a large new pulp mill {{on the north side of}} Cork St in Kalamazoo but this addition never occurred. Bryant Mills A and B continued to be used to de-ink waste paper for use as stock in the Kalamazoo paper mills. This use of recycled paper would cause huge problems for the corporation in future years. Included in the recycled paper was carbonless copy paper manufactured by the National Cash Register (NCR) Company and this paper contained toxic polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).|$|R

40|$|SummaryIntroductionSecuring femoral offset {{should in}} theory improve hip {{stability}} and abductor muscles moment arms. As problems arise mainly {{in case of}} originally increased offset (> 40 mm), a range of extra-offset stems is available; the exact impact in terms of fixation, however, is not known. HypothesisExtra-offset stems should more reliably reestablish original femoral offsets exceeding 40 mm than standard femoral components, limiting instability risk without possible adverse effect on fixation. ObjectiveTo compare the ability of five commonly available femoral stem designs to restitute offset exceeding 40 mm, and to assess function and cement fixation at a minimum 6 years’ follow-up in a stem conceived to reproduce such offset. Patients and methodsA continuous series of 74 total hip replacements (THR) in hips with increased (> 40 mm) femoral offset was studied. All underwent preoperative X-ray templating on Imagika™ software to assess <b>offset</b> <b>reproduction</b> by five models of stem: four standard, and one Lubinus SP 2 ™ extra-offset stem. A retrospective clinical and X-ray {{study was conducted with}} a minimum 6 years’ follow-up on the Lubinus SP 2 ™ 117 ° stems used to try to reproduce offset in the 74 THRs. ResultsApart from the increased (> 40 mm) offset, the cervicodiaphyseal angle was consistently 5 mm femoral offset reduction in 50 – 83 % of cases, versus only 25 % with the Lubinus SP 2 ™ 117 °). All 74 hips received Lubinus SP 2 ™ 117 ° stems: at a mean 78 months FU (range, 70 – 94 mo), their mean Postel-Merle d’Aubigné score was 17 ± 1. 8 (range, 13 – 18). Five of the 74 THRs underwent surgical revision: three cases of loosening, in which the stem was replaced, and two of instability, without change of stem. Loosening was not related to <b>offset</b> <b>reproduction</b> quality; two of the three cases were due to initial cementing defect, and the third occurred in a femur with previous history of two osteotomies. There were four cases of dislocation (5. 4 %: two primary, which were not operated on, and two recurrent, managed by acetabular revision), despite good reproduction of the preoperative offset in three of the four cases. Mean 7 -year implant survivorship was 95. 1 % (± 4. 8). Discussion and conclusionThe anatomic form of the Lubinus™ SP 2 117 ° should in theory provide a uniform cement mantle. Survivorship, however, is less good than <b>for</b> regular <b>offset</b> versions (126 ° or 135 °). On the other hand, it does reproduce anatomy in case of > 40 mm offset, providing extra offset of more than 51 mm. The slightly shorter survivorship requires more long-term surveillance.
