50|$|In {{the first}} place, the Vígszínház {{needed to have}} {{financial}} independence {{in order to develop}} its own performances as it pleased and tweak them as it liked. The scales of the Vígszínház were profitable and the theatre's management decided to sink their bank loans in better measure as well. Gábor Faludi smartly attempted to spread his ever increasing funds into various ventures, and his personal tragedy was that while his name amongst the citizenry constantly grew, he decided to push the prosperity of the Vígszínház into the midst of war profiteers. Faludi as a shrewd businessman decided in the last peaceful year to invest his earnings into four percent korona stock investment, which he even placed into a deposit until 1917. Now the lighting war strategy in which they shut down all the theatres, truly endangered the Vígszínház. Faludi immediately took strategic steps to cut his spending, and asked the leasing committee of the theatre for a moderation of the twenty thousand korona rental fee, at the same time decreasing the salary of his actors by sixty percent. Only Gyula Hegedűs dared to object, probably because he had been offered a position at the National Theatre, while the others agreed to part with more than half their normal salaries. The Vígszínház returned to its original rental fee, and working together with the actors debts it managed to balance its financial situation. The quick <b>financial</b> <b>intervention</b> was so urgent because during the first month of the World War they changed the entire scheme of the theatre's repertoire.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} real impact of {{financial}} interventions on enterprise development {{in two of}} Nigeria’s states. These states were chosen because of the huge presence of development agencies attempting to grow enterprises, and their importance in the Nation’s economy. The following time series data of critical importance {{to the success of}} enterprise development programme were collected: enterprises created, employment generated, taxes receivable by governments, and shareholders wealth. The key independent variable, <b>financial</b> <b>intervention</b> was disintegrated into private equity fund, debt fund and grants. Four multiple regression models were specified, representing each of the four dependent variables identified. The first, enterprises created, established the outreach impact of <b>financial</b> <b>intervention</b> on enterprise development.

In this regard, <b>financial</b> <b>intervention</b> in the training system should be examined carefully considering the favorable effects on one hand and its possible problems on the other. ...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} several decades, states have used {{international}} asset freezes with increasing frequency as a mechanism for promoting human rights abroad. Yet the international law governing this mechanism, which I refer to as ‘humanitarian financial intervention’, remains fragmented. This article offers the first systematic legal analysis of humanitarian <b>financial</b> <b>intervention.</b> It identifies six humanitarian purposes that states may pursue through asset freezes: preserving foreign assets from misappropriation, incapacitating foreign states or foreign nationals, coercing foreign states or foreign nationals to forsake abusive practices, compensating victims, ameliorating humanitarian crises through humanitarian aid or postconflict reconstruction, and punishing human rights violators. Whether intervening states may pursue these objectives in any given context depends upon the interplay between several international legal regimes, including international investment law, collective-security agreements such as the UN Charter, the customary law of countermeasures, the law of armed conflict, and customary law governing the enforcement of judicial decisions. By disentangling the various international legal regimes that govern humanitarian <b>financial</b> <b>intervention,</b> this article furnishes a preliminary road map for evaluating the legality of past, present, and future financial interventions – including asset freezes directed against the Qaddafi regime during the 2011 Libyan Revolution...|$|E

Seventeen papers reporting on 16 studies on smoking cessation (n = 10), attendance for vaccination or screening (n = 5), and physical activity (n = 1) were included. In meta-analyses, the average effect of incentive interventions was greater than control for short-term (≤ six months) smoking cessation (relative risk (95 % confidence intervals) : 2. 48 (1. 77 to 3. 46); long-term (>six months) smoking cessation (1. 50 (1. 05 to 2. 14)); attendance for vaccination or screening (1. 92 (1. 46 to 2. 53)); and for all behaviours combined (1. 62 (1. 38 to 1. 91)). There was not convincing evidence that effects were different between different groups of behaviours.

40|$|Background In China, {{there is}} {{significant}} disparity in maternal health between urban and rural areas. “Structural Hinders to and Promoters of Good Maternal Care in Rural China” (CHIMACA) is an international Co-operation project under the 6 th European Union Research and Development Framework Programme ([URL] This research project included searching and testing of appropriate interventions to alleviate financial access to and quality of maternal care {{in the specific context}} of rural China. This report describes the designs of community-based interventions in the study sites and evaluates the process of implementing the interventions using qualitative data. Study areas and method One province in central (Anhui) and two in western China (Chongqing and Shaanxi) were selected, representing relatively less developed areas of China. The interventions were implemented in two counties in Anhui and Shaanxi and one county in Chongqing between 2007 and 2008. The qualitative study was conducted in 2009 in each county to evaluate the implementation of the interventions. The methods included key informant interviews with local policy makers, in depth interviews and focus group discussions with township health managers, New Co-operative Medical System (NCMS) managers, healthcare providers and women who used maternal health services. Design of interventions The design of interventions varied in each province. In general, townships of the selected counties were allocated into one of the 4 intervention or control groups: a <b>financial</b> <b>intervention</b> in antenatal and postnatal care (only in Anhui and Shaanxi); training of healthcare providers on health education at township or village levels; training of healthcare providers on clinical skills at township level; and control group (current practice). Townships were paired by certain criteria and these pairs were randomly allocated to the groups. Findings The qualitative study showed that some local policy makers, health managers and healthcare providers thought that the <b>financial</b> <b>intervention</b> had somewhat improved the use of maternal health care and the quality of care, especially antenatal care. Some thought that the intervention had no effect due to the small amount of the subsidy and short intervention period, and contributed only little to the financial protection of women. Women did not fully understand the <b>financial</b> <b>intervention</b> for antenatal and postnatal care (content of care covered by the subsidy and the amount and procedure of reimbursement). All interviewed women said that the <b>financial</b> <b>intervention</b> did not influence their decisions about use of maternal healthcare. Most local policy makers and health managers as well as some Maternal and Child Health (MCH) workers, village doctors and family planning workers thought that the health education training was useful. The training improved the participants´ knowledge of maternal health care and communication skills and strengthened their sense of responsibility in service provision. Hence, healthcare providers´ attitudes, content and quality of care was improved. However, in Chongqing some village doctors did not want to provide health education because they did not receive any financial compensation for conducting this activity. Generally, women were satisfied with the services and information received from doctors. In Shaanxi, some women were more likely to receive maternal health care information from doctors (township or county doctors) rather than village doctors, and thought that village doctors had little knowledge about maternal health care. Many doctors indicated that their knowledge of antenatal, delivery and postnatal care was refreshed and their capacity to manage complications was improved by clinical skill training. Some managers also felt that after training doctors were more enthusiastic in providing maternal healthcare. However, it was difficult to get women's views due to limited sample size of women who had received care from the trained staff. Conclusion Although there were mixed views {{about the impact of the}} <b>financial</b> <b>intervention</b> on maternal health care utilisation, it was generally perceived to have only little contribution due to the small amount of the subsidy. Most respondents perceived that knowledge, skills and work attitudes were improved by health education and clinical skills training, but the intervention effects varied by province...|$|E
