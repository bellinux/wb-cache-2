500|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Ragtime was his first film in 20 years, Cagney was {{immediately}} at ease: Flubbed lines and miscues were committed by his co-stars, often simply through sheer awe. Howard Rollins, who received a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for his performance, said, [...] "I was frightened to meet Mr. Cagney. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> to die {{in front of the}} camera. He said 'Just die!' It worked. Who would know more about dying than him?" [...] Cagney also repeated the advice he had given to Pamela Tiffin, Joan Leslie, and Lemmon. As filming progressed, Cagney's sciatica worsened, but he finished the nine-week filming, and reportedly stayed on the set after completing his scenes to help the other actors with their dialogue.|$|E
500|$|The {{first year}} Lightning Bar stood as a {{breeding}} stallion his stud fee, the amount charged to breed a mare to him, was $250 (approximately $ as of [...] ) but only nine mares were bred to him. The next year, he bred 11mares, but in 1956, he bred 102 mares at $500 (approximately $ as of [...] ) each. One of Pollard's attempts to advertise his stallion involved letting {{one of his}} ranch hands take the horse to a local jackpot roping. Pollard assumed that the hand would just ride Lightning Bar around and show him off, but he later discovered that more was involved. Pollard said later that [...] "I should have been suspicious when he (the ranch hand) returned with Lightning Bar that afternoon, with a sheepish grin on his face. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> the horse was received and he said 'The stud did good and I won the jackpot!' After congratulating him, I asked which rope horse he had used. He replied, 'The stud.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Smith, poor fellow, {{has died}} of wounds. I passed {{him on his}} way down – though hit in seven places, his courage was wonderful. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> he felt & he said with a smile [...] "There is some lead in me which ought not to be there & I am afraid I have done in your tunic. I am awfully sorry".|$|E

6000|$|Elbowing my {{way forward}} to go below, as I had threatened, I saw the crew tumble {{to the deck}} on either hand like ten-pins. They were frozen stiff.

6000|$|May 31.--James H. Williams, aged 21, 3d Virginia cavalry.-About as mark'd {{a case of}} {{a strong}} man brought low by a {{complication}} of diseases, (laryngitis, fever, debility and diarrhoea,) as I have ever seen--has superb physique, remains swarthy yet, and flushed and red with fever-is altogether flighty--flesh of his great breast and arms tremulous, and pulse pounding away with treble quickness--lies {{a good deal of the}} time in a partial sleep, but with low muttering and groans--a sleep in which there is no rest. Powerful as he is, and so young, he will not be able to stand many more days of the strain and sapping heat of yesterday and to-day. His throat is in a bad way, tongue and lips parch'd. When <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> he feels, he is able just to articulate, [...] "I feel pretty bad yet, old man," [...] and looks at me with his great bright eyes. Father, John Williams, Millensport, Ohio.|$|R

6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> one day <b>how</b> old he was. [...] "Olee?"

60|$|It was {{ten o'clock}} when I went out. Many of the shops were shut, {{and the town}} was dull. When I came to Omer and Joram's, I found the {{shutters}} up, but the shop door standing open.

60|$|HOPE. Yes, {{and he told}} me it was the Lord Jesus, that dwelleth on {{the right}} hand of the Most High.

60|$|On {{the morning}} after my return to the camp Piet Retief {{appeared}} there with his five or six companions. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> he had got on with Dingaan.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> he contrived. [...] "I {{dress in}} the bath-room as a rule," [...] he replied; [...] "I keep {{most of my}} things there. Of course the old boy doesn't know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes." [...] He hoisted {{it on to}} the vehicle, {{which was}} a sort of car, and then I got in; before he shut me up, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> far it was to Thornfield.|$|E

6000|$|Everything in {{this monster}} city {{interests}} me, and I cannot keep from talking, {{even at the}} risk of being instructive. People here seem always to express distances by parables. To a stranger it is just a little confusing to be so parabolic--so to speak. I collar a citizen, and I think I am going to get some valuable information out of <b>him.</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> far it is to Birmingham, and he says it is twenty-one shillings and sixpence. Now we know that doesn't help a man who is trying to learn. I find myself down-town somewhere, and I want to get some sort of idea where I am--being usually lost when alone--and I stop a citizen and say: [...] "How far is it to Charing Cross?" [...] "Shilling fare in a cab," [...] and off he goes. I suppose if <b>I</b> were to <b>ask</b> a Londoner how far it, is from the sublime to the ridiculous, he would try to express it in coin. But I am trespassing upon your time with these geological statistics and historical reflections. I will not longer keep you from your orgies. 'Tis a real pleasure for me to be here, and I thank you for it. The name of the Savage Club is associated in my mind with the kindly interest and the friendly offices which you lavished upon an old friend of mine who came among you a stranger, and you opened your English hearts to him and gave him welcome and a home--Artemus Ward. Asking that you will join me, I give you his memory.|$|R
60|$|It was {{not until}} the year 1854 that my {{literary}} path was opened up. At that time I was a partner in the late publishing firm of Thomas Constable and Company of Edinburgh. Happening one day to meet with the late William Nelson, publisher, <b>I</b> was <b>asked</b> by <b>him</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> should like the idea of taking to literature as a profession. My answer I forget. It must have been vague, for I had never thought of the subject at all.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was shocked}} at his {{suggested}} argument, and walked by his side for a while without speaking. At last, feeling curious on the subject, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> his various love affairs were progressing.|$|E
60|$|Returning on the poop I {{approached}} Gambril. His face, {{set with}} hollow {{shadows in the}} light, looked awful, finally silenced. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> he felt, but hardly expected an answer. Therefore, I was astonished at his comparative loquacity.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> {{he got on}} with Mrs. Tenbruggen. As {{badly as}} possible, it appeared. [...] "She takes liberties with my neck; she {{interrupts}} me in my reading; and she does me no good. I shall end, Philip, in applying a medical rubbing to Mrs. Tenbruggen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Boys,' says he, 'I {{know you}} are all right or I wouldn't confide in you. I wrote to them rascals again just for fun. They {{answered}} {{and told me to}} come on to Chicago. They said telegraph to J. Smith when I would start. When I get there I'm to wait on a certain street corner till a man in a gray suit comes along and drops a newspaper in front of me. Then <b>I</b> am to <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> the water is, and he knows it's me and I know it's him.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Now I {{must turn}} to my more {{personal}} affairs. After all, {{it is impossible}} for a man to satisfy his soul, if he has anything of the sort about him which in the remotest degree answers to that description, with the husks of wealth, luxury and indolence, supplemented by occasional theological and other arguments between his friends; Becoming profoundly convinced of this truth, I searched round for something to do and, like Noah's dove on the waste of waters, found nothing. Then <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> Bickley and Bastin for their opinions as to my best future course. Bickley proved a barren draw. He rubbed his nose and feebly suggested that I might go in for [...] "research work," [...] which, of course, only represented his own ambitions. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> indignantly <b>how</b> <b>I</b> could do such a thing without any scientific qualifications whatever. He admitted the difficulty, but replied that I might endow others who had the qualifications.|$|R
6000|$|Here {{is a case}} of {{a soldier}} I found among the crowded cots in the Patent-office. He likes to have some one to talk to, and we will listen to him. He got badly hit in his leg and side at Fredericksburgh that eventful Saturday, 13th of December. He lay the {{succeeding}} two days and nights helpless on the field, between the city and those grim terraces of batteries; his company and regiment had been compell'd to leave him to his fate. To make matters worse, it happen'd he lay with his head slightly down hill, and could not help himself. At the end of some fifty hours he was brought off, with other wounded, under a flag of truce. <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> the rebels treated him as he lay during those two days and nights within reach of them--whether they came to him--whether they abused him? He answers that several of the rebels, soldiers and others, came to him at one time and another. A couple of them, who were together, spoke roughly and sarcastically, but nothing worse. One middle-aged man, however, who seem'd to be moving around the field, among the dead and wounded, for benevolent purposes, came to him in a way he will never forget; treated our soldier kindly, bound up his wounds, cheer'd him, gave him a couple of biscuits and a drink of whiskey and water; <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> if he could eat some beef. This good secesh, however, did not change our soldier's position, for it might have caused the blood to burst from the wounds, clotted and stagnated. Our soldier is from Pennsylvania; has had a pretty severe time; the wounds proved to be bad ones. But he retains a good heart, and is at present on the gain. (It is not uncommon for the men to remain on the field this way, one, two, or even four or five days.) ...|$|R
60|$|My {{opinion of}} our own {{supporters}} went lower every day, and my opinion of the Liberal voters higher, till it so happened that I went one day to {{an old friend of}} mine who was working on the Liberal side. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> he liked it.|$|E
6000|$|BEFORE {{the doctor}} left me one evening, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> much longer I {{was likely to}} live. He answered: [...] "It's not easy to say; you may die before I {{can get back to}} you in the morning, or you may live {{to the end of the}} month." ...|$|E
60|$|Pointing {{into the}} bay {{he said that it}} was the way to various lakes which he knew. Only solemn bear-haunted {{mountains}} with their great wooded slopes were visible. The Indian said that he had been along there several times. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> he guided himself in the woods.|$|E
6000|$|Well, {{to take my}} brother's {{money would}} delay his promotion, and I {{naturally}} did not draw on him, though I own I was tempted; nor, knowing my dear General Lambert's small means, did I care to impoverish <b>him</b> by <b>asking</b> for supplies. These simple acts of forbearance my worthy brewer must choose to consider as instances of exalted virtue. And what does my gentleman do but write privately to my brother in America, lauding {{me and my wife}} as the most admirable of human beings, and call upon Madame de Bernstein, who never told me of his visit indeed, but who, I perceived, about this time treated us with singular respect and gentleness, that surprised me in one whom I could not but consider as selfish and worldly. In after days <b>I</b> remember <b>asking</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> he had gained admission to the Baroness? He laughed: [...] "De Baroness!" [...] says he. [...] "I knew de Baron when he was a walet at Munich, and I was a brewer-apprentice." [...] I think our family had best not be too curious about our uncle the Baron.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will say}} so indeed {{when you hear}} the end, Quatermain. My {{bereavement}} and the sleeplessness which it caused prayed upon me so much, for now that the child was dead my wife was everything to me, that, I will tell you the truth, my brain became affected and like Job I cursed God in my heart and determined to die. Indeed I should have died by my own hand, {{had it not been for}} Savage. I had procured the laudanum and loaded the pistol with which I proposed to shoot myself immediately after it was swallowed so that there might be no mistake. One night only a couple of months or so ago, Quatermain, I sat in my study at Ragnall, with the doors locked as I thought, writing a few final letters before I did the deed. The last of them was just finished about twelve when hearing a noise, I looked up and saw Savage standing before me. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> angrily <b>how</b> he came there (I suppose he must have had another key to one of the other doors) and what he wanted.

6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> then <b>how</b> {{it came to}} {{pass that}} those people who had so shut {{themselves}} up in the ships had not laid in sufficient stores of all things necessary. He said some of them had; but, on the other hand, some did not come on board till they were frightened into it, and till it was too dangerous {{for them to go}} to the proper people to lay in quantities of things; and that he waited on two ships, which he showed me, that had laid in little or nothing but biscuit bread[172] and ship beer, and that he had bought everything else almost for them. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> if there were any more ships that had separated themselves as those had done. He told me yes; all the way up from the point, right against Greenwich, to within the shores of Limehouse and Redriff, all the ships that could have room rid[173] two and two {{in the middle of the}} stream, and that some of them had several families on board. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> if the distemper had not reached them. He said he believed it had not, except two or three ships, whose people had not been so watchful as to keep the seamen from going on shore as others had been; and he said it was a very fine sight to see how the ships lay up the Pool.[174] ...|$|R
