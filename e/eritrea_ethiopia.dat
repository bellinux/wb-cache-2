25|$|Because {{the terms}} 'Muslim world' and 'Islamic world' are disputed, since no country is {{homogeneously}} Muslim, {{and there is}} no way to determine at what point a Muslim minority in a country is to be considered 'significant' enough, there is no consensus on how to define the Muslim world geographically. The only rule of thumb for inclusion which has some support, is that countries need to have a Muslim population of more than 50%. Jones (2005) defines a 'large minority' as being between 30% and 50%; thus, there were nine countries with a 'large Muslim minority' in 2000, namely Bosnia and Herzegovina, <b>Eritrea,</b> <b>Ethiopia,</b> Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Kazakhstan, Macedonia, Nigeria, and Tanzania.|$|E

25|$|The post-apartheid {{period has}} been marked by {{numerous}} outbreaks of xenophobic attacks against foreign migrants and asylum seekers from various conflict zones in Africa. An academic study conducted in 2006, found that South Africans showed levels of xenophobia greater {{than anywhere else in the}} world. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) found that competition over jobs, business opportunities, public services and housing gave rise to tension among refugees, asylum seekers, migrants and host communities, identified as a main cause of the xenophobic violence. South Africa received more than 207,000 individual asylum applications in 2008 and a further 222,300 in 2009, representing nearly a four-fold rise in both years over the levels seen in 2007. These refugees and asylum seekers originated mainly from Zimbabwe, Burundi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, <b>Eritrea,</b> <b>Ethiopia</b> and Somalia.|$|E

50|$|The South Arabic {{alphabet}} used in <b>Eritrea,</b> Djibouti, <b>Ethiopia</b> and Yemen {{beginning in}} the 8th century BC, in all three locations, later evolved into the Ge'ez alphabet.

25|$|In the 1920s the Italian {{colonial power}} in Eritrea started the first {{attempts}} {{to found a}} separate Eritrean Orthodox Church. Until then the Orthodox Church in Eritrea was practically part of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, with a strong link to Aksum in Tigray as the traditional centre of the Church structure. This was, however, against {{the interest of the}} colonizer: Eritrea as a separate colony was supposed to have a church independent from the neighbor's influence, in order to be fully integrated into the colonial system. The separate Eritrean Church was short-lived. When it was still not fully established, the Italians invaded Ethiopia in 1935, and then formed a unified territory, Africa Orientale Italiana, encompassing <b>Eritrea,</b> <b>Ethiopia</b> and Italian Somalia. Eritrea was unified with the northern Ethiopian province of Tigray, and both Orthodox Churches unified. This unification remained valid even after the defeat of the Italians and their loss of the whole territory in 1941.|$|E
25|$|Tigrinya {{is closely}} related to Amharic and Tigre, another Afroasiatic {{language}} spoken by the Tigre people as well as many Beja. Tigrinya and Tigre although close are not mutually intelligible, and while Tigrinya has traditionally been written using the same Ge'ez alphabet (fidel) as Amharic, Tigre has been transcribed mainly using the Arabic script. Attempts by the Eritrean government to have Tigre written using the Ge'ez script has met with some resistance from the predominantly Muslim Tigre people who associate Ge'ez with the Orthodox Church and would prefer the Arabic or the more neutral Latin alphabet. It has also met with the linguistic difficulty of the Ge'ez script being a syllabic system which does not distinguish long vowels from short ones. While this works well for writing Tigrinya or Amharic, which do not rely on vowel length in words, it does complicate writing Tigre, where vowel length sometimes distinguishes one word and its meaning from another. The Ge'ez script evolved from the Epigraphic South Arabian script, whose first inscriptions are from the 8th century BC in <b>Eritrea,</b> <b>Ethiopia</b> and Yemen.|$|E
