25|$|Spontaneous {{fluctuations}} in global climate might explain past variability. It {{is very difficult}} to know what the true level of variability from only internal causes might be since other forcings, as noted above, exist whose magnitude may not be known either. One approach to evaluating internal variability is to use long integrations of coupled ocean-atmosphere global climate models. They have the advantage that the <b>external</b> <b>forcing</b> is known to be zero, but the disadvantage is that they may not fully reflect reality. The variations may result from chaos-driven changes in the oceans, the atmosphere, or interactions between the two. Two studies have concluded that the demonstrated inherent variability is not great enough to account for the Little Ice Age.|$|E
25|$|An abrupt {{climate change}} {{occurs when the}} climate system is forced to {{transition}} to a new climate state {{at a rate that}} is determined by the climate system energy-balance, and which is more rapid than the rate of change of the <b>external</b> <b>forcing.</b> Past events include the end of the Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse, Younger Dryas, Dansgaard-Oeschger events, Heinrich events and possibly also the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum. The term is also used within the context of global warming to describe sudden climate change that is detectable over the time-scale of a human lifetime. One proposed reason for the observed abrupt climate change is that feedback loops within the climate system both enhance small perturbations and cause a variety of stable states.|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of an external field acting differently {{on the two}} constituents of a binary colloidal mixture performing Brownian dynamics is investigated by computer simulations and a simple theory. In our model, half of the particles (A particles) are pulled by an <b>external</b> <b>force</b> F (A) while the other half (B particles) are pulled by an <b>external</b> <b>force</b> F (B). If F (A) and F (B) are parallel and the field-free state is a mixed fluid, previous simulations (Dzubiella J et al 2002 Phys. Rev. E 65 021402) have shown a nonequilibrium pattern formation involving lanes of A or B particles only, which are sliding {{against each other in}} the direction of the <b>external</b> <b>forces.</b> In this paper, we generalize the situation both to nonparallel <b>external</b> <b>forces</b> and to field-free crystalline states. For nonparallel forces, lane formation is also observed but with an orientation tilted with respect to the <b>external</b> <b>forces.</b> If the field-free state is crystalline, a continuous increase of the parallel <b>external</b> <b>forces</b> yields a novel re-entrant freezing behaviour: the crystal first melts mechanically via the <b>external</b> <b>force</b> and then recrystallizes into demixed crystalline lanes sliding against each other. 1...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} heterogeneous diffusion processes with the power-law {{dependence of the}} diffusion coefficient on the position and investigate the influence of <b>external</b> <b>forces</b> on the resulting anomalous diffusion. The heterogeneous diffusion processes can yield subdiffusion as well as superdiffusion, depending {{on the behavior of}} the diffusion coefficient. We assume that not only the diffusion coefficient but also the <b>external</b> <b>force</b> has a power-law dependence on the position. We obtain analytic expressions for the transition probability in two cases: when the power-law exponent in the <b>external</b> <b>force</b> is equal to 2 eta- 1, where 2 eta is the power-law exponent in the dependence of the diffusion coefficient on the position, and when the <b>external</b> <b>force</b> has a linear dependence on the position. We found that the power-law exponent in the dependence of the mean square displacement on time does not depend on the <b>external</b> <b>force,</b> this force changes only the anomalous diffusion coefficient. In addition, the <b>external</b> <b>force</b> having the power-law exponent different from 2 eta- 1 limits the time interval where the anomalous diffusion occurs. We expect that the results obtained in this paper may be relevant for a more complete understanding of anomalous diffusion processes...|$|R
