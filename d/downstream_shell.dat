40|$|There are {{considered}} the results of stress-strain state analysis of polymer diaphragm {{in the body of}} the 50 m high earthfill cofferdam of Gibe III dam. The diaphragm is made of polyvinylchloride (PVC) geomembrane and has a zigzag location. Computations were conducted with the finite element method. A thin geomembrane was modeled by rod-shaped finite elements. Computations showed that the diaphragm made of geomembrane is a sufficiently safe seepage-control element: there are small tensile stresses on its individual sections. The geomembrane damage may occur in it only in the part anchored to the upstream shell. Considerable tensile stresses appear in anchors which are comparable with the geomembrane tensile strength. If the geomembrane is made of PVC, there will be a margin of safety.

40|$|Abstract: Dam {{embankments}} {{are complex}} geotechnical structures. In {{design of the}} earth dams, the finite element method (FEM) is very often used. The FEM is used in analysis of expected displacements, strains, and stresses of the structure caused by changeable loading or boundary conditions. Deformation of an embankment dam starts occurring during {{the construction of the}} dam. These deformations are caused by the increase of effective stresses during the construction of the consecutive layers of earth material and also by the effects of creep of material. In this study, Alavian earth dam was selected for stress-strain analysis using Geo-Studio software. The settlements from the single layer embankment simulations were compared with the settlements calculated for 3, 7, 10 and 15 soil layers considered in construction processes. Results showed that maximum displacement in single layer dam has happened in the crest of the dam. Increase in embankment layers, resulted in the maximum displacement creation {{in the middle of the}} <b>downstream</b> <b>shell.</b> The simulation layers for the construction have little effect on the stresses in the dam; however, that may cause a significant effect on the deformations of the dam.

40|$|The {{permeability}} of the rockmass is {{an important}} parameter for a dam. Mostly, an underground sealing is required to reduce seepage, which originates from a high permeability to an admissible amount. Further purposes of an underground sealing are to obtain sufficient stability against piping and to limit the uplift under the downstream located shell. The success of an underground sealing depends on geological conditions and technical parameters. These relations were investigated for the Bigge dam which presents an excellently documented example. The data of Lugeon tests and groutings are correlated by means of statistical measures with the geological conditions. Furthermore the long-term stability of the grout curtain is checked by {{an evaluation of the}} seepage records since impounding. At the Bigg dam, completed in 1965, the underground sealing consists of a concrete sealing up to 10 - 15 m depth in the upper weathering and disintegrated zone of the rockmass. At the bottom of the concrete sealing the accessible control gallery is integrated. From this gallery the grout curtain was drilled into the bedrock up to a maximum depth of 85 m below ground level. The results of the investigations can be summarised as follows: - By the concrete sealing in the upper section the total grouting work was considerably reduced and an optimum sealing in the critical weathering and disintegration zone was obtained. - According to the concrete sealing of the upper weathering and disintegrated zone of the rockmass the solid take of the grout curtain came to an average values of only 30 kg per running meter of borehole with extreme variations between the different sections of the grout curtain (max. in the A-row about 3800 kg/m). The water take in the Lugeon tests decreased from 4 Lugeon in the A-row (max. about 60 Lugeon), before grouting, up to 0. 45 Lugeon in the control borings, after grouting. This means a reduction of 89 %. - The average seepage through the grout curtain comes only to 4. 28 l/s. - The hydrostatic pressure in the foundation was completely lowered below the <b>downstream</b> <b>shell,</b> or it was reduced to 6 % of the upstream head, respectively. - The results indicate that effectiveness of the grout curtain was completely preserved during the 30 years of operation. The seepage is about 16 % lower than at the time of impounding in 1965. Due to these favourable results of the inspection, longer intervals of monitoring and a {{reduction in the number of}} measuring points of the current extensive monitoring system can be recommended. In addition, supplementary sealing is not necessary. (orig.)

40|$|The {{analysis}} of dam behaviour {{is an important}} issue within engineering practice.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} radiation-regulated gas {{accretion}} onto black holes (BHs) from galactic scales emphasizing {{the role of}} thermal and radiation pressure in limiting gas supply to the BH. Assuming quasi-spherical symmetry, we explore how the gas accretion depends on free parameters such as radiative efficiency, BH mass, ambient gas density/temperature, and the spectral index of the radiation. Our numerical simulations show an oscillatory behavior of the accretion rate, and thus the luminosity from the BH. We present {{a model for the}} feedback loop and provide analytical relationships for the average/maximum accretion rate and the period of the accretion bursts. The thermal structure inside the str sphere is a key factor for the regulation process, while with increasing ambient gas density and mass of BHs eventually the accretion rate becomes limited by radiation pressure. The period of the luminosity bursts is proportional to the average size of the ionized hot bubble, but we discover that there are two distinct modes of oscillations with very different duty cycles that are governed by different depletion processes of the gas inside the ionized bubble. We also study how angular momentum of the gas affects the accretion process. In {{the second part of the}} thesis, we study the growth rate and luminosity of BHs in motion with respect to their surrounding medium. Contrary to the case without radiation feedback, we find that the accretion rate increases with increasing BH velocity, v, reaching a maximum value at v ~ 20 - 30 km/s, before decreasing as v^{- 3 }. The increase of the accretion rate with v is produced by the formation of a D-type (density) ionization front (I-front) preceded by a standing bow-shock that reduces the downstream gas velocity to nearly sub-sonic values. Interestingly, there is a range of densities and velocities in which the dense <b>shell</b> <b>downstream</b> of the bow-shock is unstable; its central part is destroyed and reformed intermittingly, producing a periodic accretion rate with peak values about 10 times the mean. This effect can significantly increase the detectability of accreting intermediate mass BHs from the interstellar medium (ISM) in nearby galaxies. We find that the maximum accretion rate for a moving BH is larger than that of a stationary BH of the same mass, accreting from the same medium, if the medium temperature is T< 10 ^ 4 K. This result could have an important impact on our understanding of the growth of seed BHs in the multi-phase medium of the first galaxies and for building and early X-ray background that may affect the formation of the first galaxies and the reionization process...|$|R
