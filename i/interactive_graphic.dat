40|$|Abstract <b>Interactive</b> <b>graphics</b> {{provide a}} very {{important}} tool that facilitates the process of exploratory data and model analysis which is a crucial step in real-world applied statistics. Only a very limited set of software exists that provides truly <b>interactive</b> <b>graphics</b> for data analysis, partially {{because it is not}} easy to implement. Very often specialized software is created to offer graphics for a particular problem, but many fundamental plots are omitted since it is not considered new research. In this paper we discuss a general framework that allows to create <b>interactive</b> <b>graphics</b> software on a sound foundation that offers consistent user interface, fast prototyping of new plots and extensibility to support interactive models. In addition, we also discuss one implementation of the general framework: iPlots eXtreme- next-generation <b>interactive</b> <b>graphics</b> for analysis of large data in R. It provides most fundamental plot types and allows new interactive plots to be created. The implementation raises <b>interactive</b> <b>graphics</b> performance to an entirely new level. We will discuss briefly several methods that allowed us to achieve this goal and illustrate the use of advanced programmability features in conjunction with R.

40|$|An <b>interactive</b> <b>graphics</b> system using {{closed circuit}} {{television}} (CCTV) cameras for remote verification and maintenance of a geometric world model database has been demonstrated in GE's telerobotics testbed. The database provides geometric models and locations of objects viewed by CCTV cameras and manipulated by telerobots. To update the database, an operator uses the <b>interactive</b> <b>graphics</b> system to superimpose a wireframe line drawing of an object with known dimensions on a live video scene containing that object. The methodology used is multipoint positioning to easily superimpose a wireframe graphic on the CCTV image of an object in the work scene. An enhanced version of GE's <b>interactive</b> <b>graphics</b> system will provide the object designation function for the operator control station of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's telerobot demonstration system...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{appraisal}} of current progress towards supporting <b>interactive</b> <b>graphics</b> {{within the framework}} of a general-purpose programming paradigm based upon definitions. It considers how the use of definitive principles relates to other work, why it appears promising, and what progress has been made towards the resolution of technical difficulties. It re-examines potential for applications of definitive principles in <b>interactive</b> <b>graphics</b> in the light of more recently developed ideas about dealing with control issues and dynamically changing relationships in a definitive programming framework. It also takes account of new research into notations for graphics that makes use of geometrical constructions. As a subsidiary theme, the paper contrasts the support for reference and representation of geometric relationships in various kinds of <b>interactive</b> <b>graphics</b> systems...|$|R

40|$|<b>Interactive</b> <b>graphics</b> is {{a useful}} {{communication}} tool and new software tools make it easier than ever. However, few people {{know how to use}} <b>interactive</b> <b>graphics</b> properly and the new tools just allow them to build bad programs more quickly. This paper describes the start of a pattern language for using <b>interactive</b> <b>graphics</b> to communicate complex topics. It is based on our experience in education, but should also be helpful for modelling, news sites, and museums. The paper describes the structure of the pattern language, lists the 99 patterns that have been found so far, and gives brief descriptions of 16 patterns and detailed descriptions of 3. 1 Context for <b>interactive</b> information <b>graphics</b> (<b>Interactive)</b> visualization helps people to analyze, understand and communicate models, concepts and data [SM 00].

There are many applications for such <b>interactive</b> <b>graphics</b> to present information, including news websites, edutainment kiosks in museums, self-paced learning courses and interactive whiteboards. According to the Multimedia Principle [MM 99], there is evidence that the use of multimedia (that is, words and pictures) can improve learning. Dynamic and interactive pictures can be even more effective. Causal relationships can be directly and unequivocally perceived. Sequences of object or data movements can be captured.
