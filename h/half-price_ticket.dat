5|$|The Square {{has been}} the home for TKTS (originally known as the Official London <b>Half-Price</b> Theatre <b>Ticket</b> Booth), since 1980. Tickets for theatre {{performances}} taking place around the West End that day and during the week are sold from the booth at a significant discount. The popularity of the booth {{has given rise to}} other booths and stores around the Square that advertise <b>half-price</b> <b>tickets</b> for West End shows. The Official London Theatre Guide recommends avoiding these booths as they are not official and do not contain the Society of Ticket Agents & Retailers (STAR) logo.|$|R
5000|$|Originally titled [...] "Garage Band," [...] Gettin' the Band Back Together was {{developed}} through a four-year improvisational rehearsal process by Ken Davenport and the Grundleshotz. [...] It premiered at the George Street Playhouse on September 24, 2013, starring Alison Fraser and Mitchell Jarvis. The production {{was directed by}} John Rando and choreographed by Kelly Devine. Residents of Sayreville, New Jersey, the musical's setting and Jon Bon Jovi's hometown, were offered <b>half-price</b> <b>tickets</b> to the production's final preview performance on October 3, and first responders and emergency workers from Sayreville were offered complimentary tickets.|$|R

5000|$|October {{began with}} a 2-1 defeat at Cardiff City. Lita neatly touched Elliotts free kick home, but Cardiffs goals came from {{defensive}} errors: Packwood played them onside for the first, and failure {{to deal with a}} corner allowed Mark Hudson to score the winner. New loanee James Hurst made his debut as a second-half substitute. Courtesy of <b>half-price</b> <b>ticket</b> offers, more than 18,000 saw Birmingham lose 1-0 to Huddersfield Town; Žigić was sent off for a high tackle and Mitch Hancox made his competitive debut as substitute for the injured Davies. Clark accused the players of failing to take responsibility, making it clear that he was [...] "not sitting in the dressing room telling them not to tackle, to pussyfoot around, telling them to mis-place passes. They cant just hide behind me all the time, theyve got to come out fighting." [...] Butland produced what he described as the best performance of his career and Ravel Morrison, selected {{for the first time since}} August after problems with his attitude to training led Clark to consider terminating his loan, was influential as Birmingham narrowly failed to beat league leaders Leicester City. Away to Millwall, Birmingham went 3-0 down in a seven-minute spell in the first half, two of the three scored by former loanee Chris Wood, before Marlon King scored the first hat-trick of his senior career to secure the draw. On his 40th birthday, Lee Clark selected the same starting eleven away at Leeds United, where Lita scored the only goal of the game from 30 yd.|$|E
50|$|Classical and Opera venues in San Francisco {{include the}} San Francisco Symphony, the San Francisco Opera and the San Francisco Ballet. They all {{perform at the}} San Francisco War Memorial and Performing Arts Center. San Francisco's Ballet and Opera {{are some of the}} oldest {{continuing}} performing arts companies in the United States. San Francisco is the birthplace and home city of the vocal ensemble Chanticleer. The city is also home to the American Conservatory Theater, also known as A.C.T., which has been routinely staging original productions since its arrival in San Francisco in 1967. Additionally, the New Conservatory Theatre Center (NCTC) is known for being an intimate theater that routinely stages original productions by the local, national, and international LGBT community. Hundreds of smaller, alternative theatres also attract {{a significant portion of the}} audience given their historical role in the San Francisco performing arts culture. The oldest of these are Intersection for the Arts, founded in 1965, and the Magic Theatre, founded in 1967. A major player in the promotion of theater in the Bay Area is Theatre Bay Area (or TBA). A non profit organization, Theatre Bay Area has members from more than 365 Bay Area theatre and dance companies, is the publisher of Callboard Magazine, and runs San Francisco's <b>Half-Priced</b> <b>Ticket</b> Booth.|$|R
60|$|Covered with dust, gasping {{with the}} fatigue of a three hours' run beside the procession, but fresh at heart {{as in the}} beginning, they arrived with it on the Commons, where the tent-wagons were already drawn up, and the ring was made, and mighty men were driving the iron-headed tent-stakes, and {{stretching}} the ropes of the great skeleton of the pavilion which they {{were just going to}} clothe with canvas. The boys were not allowed to come anywhere near, except three or four who got leave to fetch water from a neighboring well, and thought themselves richly paid with <b>half-price</b> <b>tickets.</b> The other boys were proud to pass a word with them as they went by with their brimming buckets; fellows who had money to go in would have been glad to carry water just for the glory of coming close to the circus men. They stood about in twos and threes, and lay upon the grass in groups debating whether a tan-bark ring was better than a saw-dust ring; there were different opinions. They came as near the wagons as they dared, and looked at the circus horses munching hay from the tail-boards, just like common horses. The wagons were left standing outside of the tent; but when it was up, the horses were taken into the dressing-room, and then the boys, with many a backward look at the wide spread of canvas, and the flags and streamers floating over it from the centre-pole (the centre-pole was revered almost like a distinguished personage), ran home to dinner so as to get back good and early, and be among the first to go in.|$|R
50|$|A gangster whose {{office is}} located above the Bondage Horse theater troupe. He becomes a regular {{patron of the}} troupe after they sell him <b>tickets</b> <b>half-price</b> to their show one time {{to make up for}} the noise they made while practicing. Later on, he asks Suekichi to hold on to a handgun that the police are looking for. He even hides out at Suekichi's apartment, and Aya paints his skin so that he resembles Freddy. During this time, he works for Bondage Horse for a brief period of time, using scare tactics to sell tickets for their show.|$|R
6000|$|I do {{not really}} know how boys live through the wonder and the glory of such a sight. Once there were two chariots--one held the band in red-and-blue uniforms, and was drawn by {{eighteen}} piebald horses; {{and the other was}} drawn by a troop of Shetland ponies, and carried in a vast mythical sea-shell little boys in spangled tights and little girls in the gauze skirts and wings of fairies. There was not a flaw in this splendor to the young eyes that gloated on it, and that followed it in rapture through every turn and winding of its course in the Boy's Town; nor in the magnificence of the actors and actresses, who came riding two by two in their circus-dresses after the chariots, and looking some haughty and contemptuous, and others quiet and even bored, as if it were nothing to be part of such a procession. The boys tried to make them out by the pictures and names on the bills: which was Rivers, the bare-back rider, and which was O'Dale, the champion tumbler; which was the India-rubber man, which the ring-master, which the clown. Covered with dust, gasping with the fatigue of a three hours' run beside the procession, but fresh at heart as in the beginning, they arrived with it on the Commons, where the tent-wagons were already drawn up, and the ring was made, and mighty men were driving the iron-headed tent-stakes, and stretching the ropes of the great skeleton of the pavilion which they were just going to clothe with canvas. The boys were not allowed to come anywhere near, except three or four who got leave to fetch water from a neighboring well, and thought themselves richly paid with <b>half-price</b> <b>tickets.</b> The other boys were proud to pass a word with them as they went by with their brimming buckets; fellows who had money to go in would have been glad to carry water just for the glory of coming close to the circus-men. They stood about in twos and threes, and lay upon the grass in groups debating whether a tan-bark ring was better than a sawdust ring; there were different opinions. They came as near the wagons as they dared, and looked at the circus-horses munching hay from the tail-boards, just like common horses. The wagons were left standing outside of the tent; but when it was up, the horses were taken into the dressing-room, and then the boys, with many a backward look at the wide spread of canvas, and the flags and streamers floating over it from the centre-pole (the centre-pole was revered almost like a distinguished personage), ran home to dinner so as to get back good and early, and be among the first to go in. All round, before the circus doors were open, the doorkeepers of the side-shows were inviting people to come in and see the giants and fat woman and boa-constrictors, and there were stands for peanuts and candy and lemonade; the vendors cried, [...] "Ice-cold lemonade, from fifteen hundred miles under ground! Walk up, roll up, tumble up, any way to get up!" [...] The boys thought this brilliant drolling, but they had no time to listen after the doors were open, and they had no money to spend on side-shows or dainties, anyway. Inside the tent, they found it dark and cool, and their hearts thumped in their throats with the wild joy of being there; they recognized one another with amaze, as if they had not met for years, and the excitement kept growing, as other fellows came in. It was lots of fun, too, watching the country-jakes, as the boys called the farmer-folk, and seeing how green they looked, and how some of them tried to act smart with the circus-men that came round with oranges to sell. But the great thing was to see whether fellows that {{said they were going to}} hook in really got in. The boys held it to be a high and creditable thing to hook into a show of any kind, but hooking into a circus was something that a fellow ought to be held in special honor for doing. He ran great risks, and if he escaped the vigilance of the massive circus-man who patrolled the outside of the tent with a cowhide and a bulldog, perhaps he merited the fame he was sure to win.|$|R
