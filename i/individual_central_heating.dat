5000|$|The {{main feature}} of the area is the Logie housing estate, built between 1919 and 1920 and {{designed}} by James Thompson. The estate was the first public housing estate built in Scotland after the First World War. It {{was one of the}} first in Europe to have a district heating scheme, supplied by a boilerhouse that also provided a public wash-house for the surrounding area. Poor insulation of the supply pipes meant that the snow on the pavements melted.The housing consists mostly of three-room (living room and two bedrooms, plus kitchen and bathroom) and two-room (living room and one bedroom, kitchen and bathroom) in blocks of four flats, two upper and two lower, each with its own front door of the type described in England as a [...] "maisonette". As well as communal drying greens, the houses each have a small allotment, although many of these have now been grassed over. The district heating scheme was closed in the late 1970s and <b>individual</b> <b>central</b> <b>heating</b> installed in each house.|$|E
40|$|The study {{deals with}} the {{possibilities}} of district heat supply using the realistic example of the KRB Gundremmingen boiling-water reactor. In its final construction this nuclear power plant is layed out to produce a total power output of 2870 MW$_{gross}$ with comprising blocks A, Band C; block A of a capacity of 250 MW has been operating since 1967. The area to be supplied {{is located in the}} Federal State of Bavaria, situated to the right and left of the Danube river, and comprises the districts of Dillingen and Günzburg. It involves 8 placesi the total number of population amounts to 55, 000. Maximum straight-line distances from the nuclear power station are around 10 km in north-east direction, and around 15 km in southwest direction. The following was made use of to calculate the heat demand for the area considered:a statistical questionnaire to determine the annual heat consumption and the connection data for residential buildings, official buildings, commercial buildings and industrial plants to be filled in by the various communities; town-maps; the Bavarian Municipal Statistics of 1970 with the results of a building and dwelling census taken on October 25, 1968, results of a non-agricultural workplace census taken on May 27, 1970, and results of a population census taken on May 27, 1970, as weil as a final local inspection. The results show that some places indicate characters that are in favour of district heat supply. However, the heat price is adversely affected by the narrow road configuration in the ancient town centers, the low consumption of heat resulting from the small number of inhabitants, as weil as the large distances from the power station. The advanced projection of blocks B and C does no longer permit a thermodynamically meaningful extraction of heat from the power station, so that the advantage of cheap nuclear heat thus is partly lost again. Added to this is the fact that, due to the activity in the direct-cycle unit of the boilingwater reactor, the heat exchangers for district heat extraction fall into the controlled area, thus eventually impeding the licensing procedure. According to the calculations and estimated carried out, the heat price for residential heating expected at present are above those of <b>individual</b> <b>central</b> <b>heating</b> plants...|$|E

30|$|Energy {{systems are}} {{inherently}} complex, large socio-technical systems, {{in that they}} consist of large number of actors, interacting through networks under changing infrastructures and institutional structures, aiming to provide services including warmth, power and lighting to users (Bale et al., 2015). In industrialised countries such as the UK, these services are largely provided by centralised systems for the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity and the transmission and distribution of gas. In order to achieve a transition to low carbon energy systems, there has been interest in exploring the potential for greater local provision of energy services, through local power generation and heat networks (Foxon, 2013; RTP Engine Room, 2015; Bush et al., 2014). As part of the iBUILD project, the authors undertook case studies of two disruptive energy technologies to examine the range of values that these may create {{and the potential for}} alternative business models that actors could apply to appropriate these values. Firstly, smart grids at the local distribution level, which could challenge the dominance of the centralised electricity system model, and, secondly, heat networks that provide an alternative to <b>individual</b> gas <b>central</b> <b>heating,</b> in particular in urban areas where they can offer efficient, low carbon heating services. In each case, we set out to understand the incumbent business models and value capture opportunities in provision of this infrastructure and associated services, and the new ways of capturing/delivering social and environmental values that new business models for infrastructure investment and service delivery could offer, in relation to new disruptive technologies and wider social objectives.|$|R

50|$|When a solar water <b>heating</b> and hot-water <b>central</b> <b>heating</b> {{system are}} used together, solar heat will either be {{concentrated}} in a pre-heating tank that feeds {{into the tank}} <b>heated</b> by the <b>central</b> <b>heating,</b> or the solar heat exchanger will replace the lower heating element and the upper element will remain to provide for supplemental heat. However, the primary need for <b>central</b> <b>heating</b> is at night and in winter when solar gain is lower. Therefore, solar water heating for washing and bathing is often a better application than <b>central</b> <b>heating</b> because supply and demand are better matched. In many climates, a solar hot water system can provide up to 85% of domestic hot water energy. This can include domestic non-electric concentrating solar thermal systems. In many northern European countries, combined hot water and space heating systems (solar combisystems) are used to provide 15 to 25% of home heating energy. When combined with storage, large scale solar heating can provide 50-97% of annual heat consumption for district heating.|$|R
