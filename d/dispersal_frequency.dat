40|$|In {{experimental}} metacommunities with marine benthic microalgae, {{we tested}} whether heat stress changes effects of connectivity and habitat heterogeneity on metacommunity structure and functioning, by manipulating a simulated heat wave, <b>dispersal</b> <b>frequency</b> {{and a light}} intensity gradient. We found that all measures of mean local and regional diversity and community biomass significantly declined after the heat wave and {{showed no sign of}} recovery. Additionally, dispersal decreased diversity and increased dominance in both the heat stressed and control communities. Together the heat wave and high <b>dispersal</b> <b>frequency</b> induced a dominance shift by spreading a temperature tolerant but low yielding species from its source patches with low light intensity across the metacommunity, an effect that increased with time. Although different species became dominant at high <b>dispersal</b> <b>frequency</b> with and without the heat wave, the shift towards a temperature tolerant species was not sufficient to maintain total community biomass. Thus, short-term disturbance may cause longer-term loss of ecosystem function due to dominance shifts in the composition of communities.

40|$|Dispersal and {{disturbance}} {{are major}} factors regulating {{the number of}} coexisting species. However, the relationship between species diversity and ecosystem processes has mainly been analysed for communities closed to dispersal, i. e. without looking at the mechanisms of coexistence. I experimentally investigated how initial local diversity, dispersal and disturbance rates affect local diversity and biomass production in metacommunities with marine benthic microalgae and in natural rock pool assemblages. Final local species richness and local biomass production were strongly influenced by <b>dispersal</b> <b>frequency</b> and by disturbance but not by initial local diversity (chapters 1 and 2). Both final local richness and final local biomass showed a hump-shaped pattern with increasing <b>dispersal</b> <b>frequency</b> and also with increasing suucessional time, with a maximum at intermediate dispersal frequencies and successional time. Consequently, final local biomass increased linearly with increasing final richness. In the rockpools system, diversity effects occurred {{in the absence of}} dispersal and depended on two effective grazers in the community (chapter 3).

40|$|Climate change forces {{many species}} to migrate. Empirical {{small-scale}} data on migration and colonization in the Arctic are scarce. Retreating glaciers provide new territory for cold-adapted plant species, but the genetic consequences depend on <b>dispersal</b> distances and <b>frequencies.</b> We estimated local, regional, and long-distance <b>dispersal</b> <b>frequencies,</b> {{as well as}} their effect on levels of genetic diversity, in diploid and tetraploid individuals of Saxifraga oppositifolia. Samples were collected in four aged moraines in each of three glacier forelands, in surrounding areas and reference populations in the Arctic archipelago Svalbard. These samples were analyzed for neutral amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs, n = 707) and ploidy levels (n = 30). Genetic clustering and ploidy analyses revealed two distinct genetic groups representing diploids and tetraploids, with few intermediate triploids. The groups were intermixed in most sampled populations. No differences in genetic diversity were found between tetraploids and diploids, or between established and glacier foreland populations. Seeds were dispersed over local, regional, and long distances, with the highest proportions of seeds originating from close sources. A minimum of 4 – 15 founding individuals from several source populations had initially established in each glacier foreland. Our data suggest that S. oppositifolia can rapidly colonize new deglaciated areas without losing genetic diversity. Thus, glacier forelands can be alternative habitats for cold-adapted vascular plants tracking their climatic niche. Our data show no difference in colonization success between diploid and tetraploid individuals...|$|R
40|$|We used a {{spatially}} explicit dispersal simulation {{to generate}} movement frequencies and distances for comparison with real <b>dispersal</b> <b>frequencies</b> {{collected in the}} field from two habitat-specific, sedentary bird species. The relationship between these two data sets allowed us to (1) test {{the hypothesis that the}} study species used corridor routes during dispersal; (2) measure the degree of reliance on corridor continuity; (3) estimate the rate of dispersal mortality with respect to distance traveled, and (4) give examples of how the model can be used to assess habitat connectivity with respect to similarly behaved species. We found that Blue-breasted Fairy-wrens and White-browed Babblers both used corridor routes during dispersal. Blue-breasted Fairy-wrens were inhibited by gaps greater than about 60 m, whereas White-browed Babblers crossed gaps of at least 270 m wide. For each species, the rate of dispersal mortality per unit distance traveled was about the same. Because we have effectively partitioned the risk of dispersal mortality from the chance of outside dispersal, and because our mortality estimates are model dependent but landscape independent, they can be transported to other landscapes on which simulations have been run and, therefore, can be used in population viability assessment of unstudied or hypothetical animal populations...|$|R
40|$|The last {{remains of}} native laurel {{forest in the}} Azores are highly {{threatened}} by the spread of invasive plants. Because landslides are very frequent in these islands, conservation of native laurel forest requires knowledge of the patterns of bird-dispersed seed rain into forest gaps. We monitored 78 seed traps over 1 year to investigate (1) the role of perches in attracting avian dispersers into gaps, (2) temporal patterns in the dispersal of exotic and native seeds, (3) how seed rain affects vegetation establishment in gaps at different distances from the native forest and (4) whether the caloric content of fruits could explain the number of seeds dispersed. Perches were highly effective in concentrating avian seed dispersal. While some native fruits are produced all year-round, most exotic plants set fruits during the main peak of the native fruit production (August–November). Most seeds recovered from the traps were native, and native seed rain inside the native forest was higher than in gaps. However, deposition of exotic seeds was not affected by distance from native forest. Seed <b>dispersal</b> <b>frequencies</b> monitored by seed traps and by faecal analysis were correlated with each other, but not with fruit caloric content, suggesting that other factors are more important that the nutritional value in predicting avian fruit choice. Forest restoration activities should take into consideration that seed dispersal decreases sharply beyond 100 m from native forest and the attractive potential of perches to direct natural seed dispersal into forest gaps...|$|R
40|$|Inland {{aquatic organisms}} almost ubiquitously display {{a pattern of}} marked provincialism {{characterized}} by substantial population differentiation and genealogical discontinuities. This {{is the result of}} strong priority effects and local adaptation following dispersal and colonization of new habitats. We present a case that defies this biogeographic paradigm. We have investigated the phylogeography of the fairy shrimp Streptocephalus torvicornis across its circum-Mediterranean and Eurasian distribution. Based on three independent datasets, namely sequence variation at 12 S and 16 S rRNA, cyst morphology and male second antenna characters, we discern a pattern of extensive genetic and morphological homogeneity pointing to unhindered gene flow and widespread connectivity among populations. These intriguing findings may provisionally be explained by (i) a high <b>dispersal</b> <b>frequency</b> overwhelming the ability of a population to maintain resource monopolization, (ii) an outbreeding vigour opportunity offered to secondary immigrants, (iii) an ecological equivalence of genotypes generating long-term immigration–extinction equilibria and buffering genetic diversity over spatial scales, (iv) enhanced bird-mediated dispersal in open habitats as opposed to ponds surrounded by forests or shrub, or (v) a shallow population history with little time for substantial genetic differentiation...|$|E
40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that patterns of sex-biased dispersal {{are related to}} social mating system in mammals and birds has gained widespread acceptance over the past 30 years. However, two major complications have obscured {{the relationship between these}} two behaviors: 1) <b>dispersal</b> <b>frequency</b> and dispersal distance, which measure different aspects of the dispersal process, have often been confounded, and 2) the relationship between mating system and sex-biased dispersal in these vertebrate groups has not been examined using modern phylogenetic comparative methods. Here, we present a phylogenetic analysis of the relationship between mating system and sex-biased dispersal in mammals and birds. Results indicate that the evolution of female-biased dispersal in mammals may be more likely on monogamous branches of the phylogeny, and that females may disperse farther than males in socially monogamous mammalian species. However, we found no support for a relationship between social mating system and sex-biased dispersal in birds when the effects of phylogeny are taken into consideration. We caution that although there are larger-scale behavioral differences in mating system and sex-biased dispersal between mammals and birds, mating system and sex-biased dispersal are far from perfectly associated within these taxa...|$|E
40|$|Pro-social punishment, whereby cooperators punish defectors, {{is often}} {{suggested}} {{as a mechanism}} that maintains cooperation in large human groups. Importantly, models that support this idea have to date only allowed defectors to be the target of punishment. However, recent empirical work has demonstrated the existence of anti-social punishment in public goods games. That is, individuals that defect {{have been found to}} also punish cooperators. Some recent theoretical studies have found that such anti-social punishment can prevent the evolution of pro-social punishment and cooperation. However, the evolution of anti-social punishment in group-structured populations has not been formally addressed. Previous work has informally argued that group-structure must favour pro-social punishment. Here we formally investigate how two demographic factors, group size and <b>dispersal</b> <b>frequency,</b> affect selection pressures on pro- and anti-social punishment. Contrary to the suggestions of previous work, we find that anti-social punishment can prevent the evolution of pro-social punishment and cooperation under a range of group structures. Given that anti-social punishment has now been found in all studied extant human cultures, the claims of previous models showing the co-evolution of pro-social punishment and cooperation in group-structured populations should be re-evaluated.

40|$|Our {{knowledge}} of the distance and directions that reef fish larvae disperse each generation has been transformed over the last 15 years. New discoveries from a diversity of approaches, including chemical tagging of larvae, genetic parentage analysis, population-level genetic analyses, otolith chemical signatures, and biophysical modeling, have all indicated {{a higher proportion of}} larvae settle closer to home than previously thought. The relative <b>dispersal</b> <b>frequencies</b> appear to decline with distance from source, and while average dispersal distances may be small, dispersal kernels are likely to have a long tail. Levels of self-recruitment increase with isolation or entrapment, while hydrodynamic forcing will stretch the dispersal tail in large oceanic systems. Species that differ in pelagic larval durations (PLDs) have broadly overlapping dispersal kernels, although species with longer PLDs and pelagic eggs can disperse further. The emerging picture suggests reef fish populations have an innate resilience to local disturbances and that local management can achieve both biodiversity conservation and fisheries objectives. Parentage analysis appears to be the most promising approach for describing full dispersal kernels, validating other genetic approaches, and biophysical and spatially explicit demographic models. Emphasis must be placed on identifying and protecting key subpopulations for meta population persistence in the face of increasing human pressures. The task of establishing where coral reef fish larvae go in that brief period between spawning and settlement to the reef was once considered impossible. Yet for all organisms, the link between generations is fundamental to understanding how populations persist, how species adapt to their environment, and how they are affected by human actions. Prior to the 1990 s and in the first book on the ecology of coral reef fishes [2230], reef fish populations were assumed to be "open", connected by larval dispersal over long distances driven by oceanic flows. At the time, the evidence seemed convincing. It was known that the pelagic larval duration (PLD) could last for weeks [1443, 2571] and in that time currents could transport larvae across oceans [1411]...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. ? 1. Dispersal {{plays an}} {{integral}} {{role in determining}} spatial population structure and, consequently, the long-term survival of many species. Theoretical studies indicate that dispersal increases with population density and decreasing habitat stability. In the case of monophagous insect herbivores, the stability of host-plant populations may influence their spatial population structure. 2. The tallgrass prairie in Iowa, U. S. A. is highly fragmented and most prairie insects face a landscape with fewer habitat patches and smaller host-plant populations than 150 years ago, potentially making dispersal between patches difficult. Some herbivores, however, use native plant species with weedy characteristics that have increased in abundance because of disturbances. 3. Mark?recapture data and presence?absence surveys were used to examine dispersal and spatial population structure of two monophagous beetles with host plants that exhibit different population stability and have responded differently to fragmentation of tallgrass prairie. 4. Chrysochus auratus Fabricius exhibits a patchy population structure and has relatively large <b>dispersal</b> distances and <b>frequencies.</b> Its host plant is variable locally in time and space, but is more abundant than 150 years ago. The other species, Anomoea laticlavia Forster, exhibits a metapopulation or non-equilibrium population structure and has relatively small <b>dispersal</b> distances and <b>frequencies.</b> Its host-plant populations are stable in time and space. 5. The results indicate that dispersal ability of monophagous beetles reflects the life-history dynamics of their host plants, but the spatial population structure exhibited today is strongly influenced by how the host plants {{have responded to the}} fragmentation process over both time and space...|$|R
40|$|We {{identified}} a {{site on the}} Toyohira River in Sapporo, Hokkaido, where the area of mid-channel trees is expanding. This identification was done based on aerial-photograph-based drawings indicating changes in tree height and area of mid-channel trees between 1972 (the year before improvement work, when channel trees were few) and 1995 and 2003 (years after the work was complete). Based on a cross-sectional plan of the side, we examined changes in the riverbed topography and height difference between 185 -day water level and maximum riverbed height in the low-water channel for each year. Furthermore, in the present topography, we estimated the age of seedlings along a measurement line on the bare part of sandbars distributed with seedlings, and determined inundation frequency {{during the period of}} seed <b>dispersal,</b> inundation <b>frequency</b> during the period of tree growth, maximum annual non-dimensional tractive force, and change in tree height between 2002 and 2004 when seedlings began to establish themselves. Then we conducted factor analysis on seedling habitats and environment. We found that inundation frequency during the period of seed dispersal affects the establishment of the seedlings. This suggests that adjustment of the flow volume in the period may control the establishment of seedlings...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. — Phylogenetic {{congruence}} {{is governed}} by various macroevolutionary events, including cospeciation, host switch-ing, sorting, duplication, and failure to speciate. The relative frequency of these events {{may be influenced by}} factors that govern the distribution and abundance of the interacting groups; i. e., ecological factors. If so, {{it may be possible to}} predict the degree of phylogenetic congruence between two groups from information about their ecology. Unfortunately, adequate comparative ecological data are not available for many of the systems that have been subjected to cophylogenetic analysis. An exception is provided by chewing lice (Insecta: Phthiraptera), which parasitize birds and mammals. For a few genera of these lice, enough data have now been published to begin exploring the relationship between ecology and congruence. In general, there is a correspondence between important ecological factors and the degree of phylogenetic congruence. Careful comparison of these genera suggests that dispersal is a more fundamental barrier to host switching among related hosts than is establishment. Transfer experiments show that host-specific lice can survive and reproduce on novel hosts that are similar in size to the native host as long as the lice can disperse to these hosts. To date, studies of parasite dispersal have been mainly inferential. A better understanding of the role of dispersal will require more direct data on <b>dispersal</b> <b>frequency</b> and distances.

40|$|The {{management}} of population size and genetic diversity in fragmented landscapes {{is the central}} issue in conservation biology. Functional connectivity between remnant habitat patches affects these parameters. However, the functional connectivity for genetic diversity would be characterised by a greater spatial scale than population size even within the same habitat network. The reason for this difference is that while <b>dispersal</b> <b>frequency</b> generally decreases with increasing distance, only a few immigrants may effectively contribute to gene flow, whereas {{a certain number of}} dispersers may be required to influence population abundance. Here, we investigated the effects of habitat network structures on population abundance and genetic diversity of the ninespine stickleback, Pungitius pungitius, in remnant wetland ponds in northern Japan. We tested (i) whether both population abundance and genetic diversity are positively related not only to habitat size but also to connectivity and (ii) whether the dispersal effect extends to greater spatial scales in genetic diversity than in population size. We employed a graph theoretical index to measure the degree of pond connectivity. This index can evaluate the connectivity threshold distance above which individuals cannot disperse and clarify the difference in the spatial scale of effective dispersal between population abundance and genetic diversity. Pond connectivity significantly affected the spatial variation of both population abundance and genetic diversity. In contrast, pond size was related only to population abundance. As we predicted, the connectivity threshold distance for genetic diversity was more than two times greater than that for population abundance (12. 5 km versus 5 km, respectively). Our findings indicate that the landscape managers should consider various spatial scales as a conservation unit for the {{management of}} a habitat network in accordance with the conservation targets that they establish. We also found that small artificial agricultural ditches and streams may play important roles in sustaining the population networks of wetland organisms...|$|E
40|$|The source-sink {{model of}} {{population}} dynamics predicts that density drives emigration of subordinate animals to habitats offering lower competition for resources. Several authors have suggested {{use of this}} model as a potential framework for conservation of exploited carnivores when precise enumeration is unfeasible. Dispersal is a critical behavioural mechanism for management based on this model, {{yet there is a}} lack of knowledge on the habitat and social conditions that motivate carnivore emigration and settlement. The cougar Puma concolor is a widely distributed and heavily exploited carnivore, indigenous to the western hemisphere. We evaluated patterns in cougar dispersal behaviour from two sites in Utah, differing in terms of management and the level of natural and anthropogenic habitat fragmentation. We used our results to evaluate three predictions with respect to cougar dispersal behaviour: 1) natal population density and maternal reproductive status prompt emigration, 2) movement of dispersing cougars is shaped by habitat configuration and permeability, and 3) dispersers preferentially settle in areas of high habitat quality and low conspecific density. We documented the emigration of 62 individuals and measured movement variables, including sex and site-specific frequency, distance, seasonality, direction and the habitat quality and harvest rates characterizing areas where immigrants settled. Although males and females exhibited pronounced differences in <b>dispersal</b> <b>frequency,</b> we found few differences in distance traveled, season of departure and direction moved. Dispersal occurred most frequently during spring, coinciding with the estrus pulse. Natural and anthropogenic obstacles modified landscape permeability, and therefore dispersal distances were shorter in fragmented habitats than in contiguous ones. Relative to males, females dispersed into habitats of lower productivity with higher mean annual harvest rates. Patterns in male settlement suggested habitat selection based on mating opportunities, whereas female settlement was predicated on avoiding conspecifics. Cougars in this Great Basin ecosystem largely conformed to source-sink predictions. Results can be used to parameterize source-sink models based on animal behaviour and landscape permeability to conserve exploited carnivores, under conditions of population expansion or recolonization of habitats where Allee effects are a limiting factor...|$|E

40|$|International audienceA Markovian {{extinction}} {{model that}} takes into account age structure of local populations allows consideration of the effects of demography and successional dynamics on the evolution of migration. Analytical expressions for the evolutionarily stable (ES) rates of dispersal are given for cases in which newly recolonized sites attain carrying capacity within a single season. Using a low-fecundity numerical model, we find that an increase of the level of site saturation increases the dispersal rate. Ecological successions and unequal local extinction rates between newly colonized sites and established populations strongly affect the ES <b>dispersal</b> rate. The <b>frequency</b> of genetic modifiers that enhance the rate of dispersal evolves negative correlations with deme age, with high-migration genotypes predominant among colonizers while progressively declining in frequency as a deme ages. This suggests that between-deme selection (colonization) favors migrants while within-deme selection favors low dispersers, which allows the coexistence of types with different dispersal rates. Because of the interaction between the two levels of selection, the relation between the ES dispersal rate and the deme maximal lifetime is nonmonotone. We suggest that life-history traits other than dispersal might also experience antagonistic selective forces at the between- and within-deme levels...|$|R

A pollen analytical study {{has been carried out}} on the 40 surface moss samples from the Taillefer massif (central French Alps). The sampling points are distributed along the altitudinal transect on the western slope of the massif, between 350 and 2600 m a. s. l. in altitude. Such a selection of the sites enables to detect the key pollen taxa that characterise each vegetation belt. It also contributes to the palaeoecological studies that have been carried out by many researchers in that region. The pollen spectra were treated by principal component analysis and classified into some easily recognized groups such as i) the spectra from hilly belt characterized by Quercus robur type (tp., hereafter), Carpinus, Corylus and Castanea pollen, ii) the spectra from lower subalpine belt characterized by Picea, and iii) those from alpine belt characterized by Minuartia, Paronychia. and Sagina. On the contrary, the pollen spectra from montane belt and upper subalpine belt do not form distinct groups. Regarding each taxon, Quercus pollen does not necessarily characterize the oak forest for it is present throughout the transect, always showing around 5 - 10 % of relative frequency. The values of Castanea and of Carpinus, higher than 10 % are good indicators of the hilly belt. Fagus pollen is well dispersed and recognized in the spectra from all the belts, but its value in the beech forest is only slightly higher than in other places. Picea pollen is also present over the wide altitudinal range. However, its relative frequency is never more than 30 - 50 % except in the pure spruce forest.

40|$|Population {{persistence}} {{is largely}} {{affected by the}} spatial structure of habitat, <b>dispersal</b> <b>frequency,</b> and distance. These factors are apparently important for the species that frequently migrate over habitat patches. Dispersal may {{play a crucial role}} even in population persistence of the species with low potential of migrations. In this thesis, mechanisms of population persistence were studied for the species that is expected to disperse scarcely, an amphipod Incisocalliope symbioticus (Gamo and Shinpo), in Oura Bay, Izu Peninsula, Japan. The amphipod has habitat specificity to the gorgonian octocoral Melithaea flabellifera (Kukenthal), and the distribution of the gorgonian is limited to the undersurface of large overhanging rock. There are five dense M. flabellifera patches, in Oura Bay, comprising of 390 - 1800 colonies. Each patch is more than 100 m apart from others. Thus, in Oura Bay, the habitat of I. symbioticus is discontinuously distributed over three spatial levels : a gorgonian colony (Level 1); a patch as a group of colonies (Level 2); Oura Bay, as a group of five patches (Level 3). Temporal patterns in the density and the rate of local extinction were compared among the three spatial levels. Level 1 is too small to persist local population of Incisocalliope symbioticus, bacause the density in isolated experimental populations decreased in most months. At Level 2, seasonal changes in the amphipod densities were partly asynchronous among the patches, but the densities were low in the autumn at all the patches. Furthermore, a local extinction resulted from habitat loss was observed at the smallest patch in September 2001. Another local extinction, which occurred at the largest patch in October 2000, may be due to demographic stochasticity. No extinction at Level 3 occurred. In conclusion, Level 2 was identified as the smallest unit of breeding aggregation valuable for population persistence (local population), judging from changing patterns of the dnsity and immigration frequency (see below). Immigration frequency of Incisocalliope symbioticus per one week was measured for the three spatial scales (short distance : < 0. 2 m; middle : 8 m; long : 70 m). Dispersal of I. symbioticus was frequent for the short distance, but scarce for the middle and long distance. Proportion of females and larger individuals increased with distance. Apparent increases of the middle and the long distance immigrants occurred mainly in the summer related to typhoon events. Furthermore, population growth by immigrants was measured over the long distance. The densities after 3. 0 and 4. 5 months increased to the same level as that in the autumn in the natural populations. The natural population dynamics is simulated by using seasonal changes in the value of demographic parameters, obtained in field rearing experiments. The simulated effects of immigration on an established population were so large at lower density (< 20 /g dry weight of gorgonian) that the effects are thought to be enough to prevent from local extinction caused by demographic stochasticity. The density of I. symbioticus populations often went down to less than 20. Furthermore, population growth by immigrants was simulated based on the demographic parameters, and the frequency and the compositon of immigrants. Observed population growth was readily simulated. Finally, differences of population growth with various compositions of immigrants were examined. Population growth rate by immigrants with observed age distribution was larger than that with stable age distribution and much larger than that only with newly born juveniles. Present study empirically showed how a marine invertebrate population is spatially structured and maintained, and that dispersal {{plays an important role in}} population persistence even in a species without obvious dispersal phase. Per capita influence of dispersers for population persistence is much larger in species that adults disperse like Incisocallope symbioticus than in species that young disperse, because the former can immediately start reproduction but the latter may be scarcely survived till maturation.

Still, we lack {{an understanding of the}} potential variation in the sign and strength of such interactions in relation to variations in the spatial and temporal ecological context. Here, we evaluated spatial (three sites) and temporal (two fruiting seasons) local variation in the sign (seed predation versus <b>dispersal)</b> and strength (<b>frequency</b> and quantity) of the interactions among six frugivorous mammals and a community of Mediterranean fleshy-fruited shrubs. We examined mammal faecal samples and quantified frequency of seed occurrence, number of seeds per faecal sample, seed species diversity and quality of seed treatment (i. e. percentage of undamaged seeds). The frequency of seed occurrence and number of seeds per faecal sample strongly varied among dispersers, sites, seasons and fruit species. For instance, fox Vulpes vulpes faeces showed between 6 and 40 times more seeds than wild boar Sus scrofa faeces in seasons or sites in which Rubus and Juniperus seeds were dominant. However, in seasons or sites dominated by Corema seeds, wild boar faeces contained up to seven times more seeds than fox faeces. Mammalian carnivores (fox and badger, Meles meles) treated seeds gently, acting mostly as dispersers, whereas deer (Cervus elaphus and Dama dama) acted mainly as seed predators. Interestingly, rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus acted as either mostly seed disperser or seed predator depending on the plant species.

It {{is widely}} {{recognized}} that community characteristics and genetic structure of island biotas {{are determined by}} a interplay between contemporary and historical physi cal factors and by differences in ecological traits among species. Nevertheless, the mechanisms shaping island biotas are not yet well understood mostly, {{because of a lack}} of studies comparing eco-evolutionary fingerprints over entire taxonomic groups. In the last years, our research group integrated data about community structure (richness, frequency and nestedness), genetic differentiation (based on mitochondrial DNA) and species traits (degree of generalism, dispersal ability and climatic preferences) of butterfly communities occurring over the western Mediterranean region, a key biodiversity hot-spot located at the interface between two continents. An outstanding result emerging from these studies is the evidence that biogeographic dynamics can change butterfly communities in short time frames (thousands or hundreds of years), generating unexpected contrasts between insular and mainland populations. Understanding which ecological factors promote and reduce species colonization and survival is thus crucial in order to preserve such a patterned and peculiar insular biodiversity. Our integrated approach recently allowed us to tie apart and compare the relative relevance of several species traits in explaining species occurrence and genetic diversification in two butterfly-rich and highly diverse areas (Tuscan Archipelago and South Italy). We here show that climatic preferences play a dominant influence, with species living in drier climate showing high genetic structure and those preferring cooler and wetter climate facing the highest extinction risk. This suggests that environmental changes might selectively erase different fractions of the existing island diversity. Our approach provides an example of how series of comprehensive analyses on a wide area and la rge taxonomic groups can test rarely assessed biogeographic principles like the links of genetic structure with <b>dispersal</b> tendency and <b>frequency</b> on islands, or the relative effects of contemporary and historical determinants on island populations. The challenge of integrating community ecology and phylogeographic approaches can also provide the baseline information for developing conservation strategies that maximize biodiversity at both the species and intraspecific genetic levels.

40|$|Oak (Quercus) is a {{dominant}} {{component of the}} forest canopy in many deciduous forests of the eastern United States. In the past century, a pattern of anthropogenic fire suppression throughout the eastern United States has created conditions that favor more shade-tolerant tree species {{at the expense of}} oak regeneration. Loss of oak as dominant canopy component would have a powerful impact on forest ecosystems; oak acorns are a keystone food resource for greater than 50 species of mammals and birds in these forests, due to their ubiquity and nutritional content. In response, forest managers have developed and applied silvicultural techniques, including timber harvesting, to emulate forest disturbance and regenerate oak. Timber harvesting can impact key trophic interactions with animals during early oak life history, thus potentially impacting the oak regeneration process indirectly; however, these impacts are not well understood. To address this research gap, I examined the effects of clearcut and shelterwood harvesting approaches on key early life history parameters involved in acorn predation, dispersal, seedling survival, and seedling growth for black oak (Q. velutina) and white oak (Q. alba) in southern Indiana. I found that the initial phase of shelterwood harvesting (midstory removal) resulted in increased acorn dispersal and reduced survival but that these changes were dependent on dispersal agent and acorn species. At the seedling life stage, growth was highest but survival was lowest (for black oak) in clearcut openings. The lower survival in clearcuts was likely due to drought during two consecutive growing seasons. Herbivory by white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) impacted seedling growth but not survival; rates of browsing were low throughout the study. With this field data, I developed an individual-based, spatially-explicit simulation model of early oak life history connecting early life history parameters with consequences for oak regeneration. Simulation results indicated that the observed differences in acorn predation and dispersal parameters in shelterwoods had a small, but significant, negative impact on accumulation of oak seedlings (3 ̆c 1. 4 m height) in the period following harvest. However, this effect was not carried through to density of oak saplings (? 1. 4 m). Greater disturbance {{in the second and third}} phases of the shelterwood harvest may result in stronger impacts on seed predation and <b>dispersal.</b> Increasing the <b>frequency</b> of drought years in the simulation model had a powerful negative effect on both oak seedlings and saplings, and the effect increased with intensity of harvest disturbance. The impact of drought is concerning given predictions that climate change will bring more frequent drought to the Midwestern United States; the ultimate impacts on oak regeneration success are unclear since drought may affect oak competitors even more strongly. The simulation model I developed is a flexible tool that could be used to examine a wide range of animal impacts on early oak life history and project their impacts on oak regeneration success. ...|$|R
