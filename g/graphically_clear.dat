The cross is 3.24 metres high and 1.94 metres wide; the figure of Christ is 2.09 metres tall and has an arm span of 2.09 metres. The torso, which {{was made in the}} 14th century, was carved by an unknown artist from walnut wood; from a single trunk of at least 48 centimetres in diameter. The sculptor used oak wood for the arms, and the two beams of the cross. The present smooth surface was originally embellished with wounds and veins made of filler and had a more sculpted appearance as well as being painted. The head appears rather small in proportion today, because it no longer has any of the original hair, which was made of tow and glue. Holes have been bored in the left breast and head in order to attach various relics, including a true cross relic. Hence, from quite early on, the Coesfeld Cross was believed to possess miraculous properties and was the destination of many pilgrimages. A cross is still {{at the heart of the}} tradition today. For the various festivals known as Kreuztrachten, streets and houses along the route of the procession are decorated with flags and pennants, not dissimilar to the custom in other Roman Catholic regions.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Location {{information}} {{is a set}} of data describing an individual geographical location. This information can be used in many ways to provide information and entertainment services to the user who has the require devices and resources to operate such services. However, different challenges are reported in terms o availability and homogeneity. These challenges are mainly focused on the integration, standardization, security and privacy of the various GIS resources that helps to show essential but exhaustive information into a simple, clear and possibly user-friendly interface. Therefore, a simple but complete interface should provide all GIS functionalities, identified by <b>graphically</b> <b>clear</b> and easily understandable symbols, icons or texts. This paper intends to apply the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) to re-manage the GIS resources and provide a distributed, dynamic, and reliable service system that can meet information and service requirements of many different users over the internet...|$|E

The fluid system chosen is the liquid sessile droplet to show the importance in single crystal growth, the spray drying and cooling of metal, and the advance droplet radiators of the space stations radiators. A cross sectional representation of a hemispherical liquid droplet under ideal conditions is used to show internal fluid motion. A direct simulation of buoyancy-dominant convection and surface tension-dominant convection is <b>graphically</b> displayed. The <b>clear</b> differences between two mechanisms of fluid transport, thermocapillary convection, and bouncy dominant convection is illustrated...|$|R
40|$|Heap {{exploits}} {{are one of}} {{the most}} advanced, complex and frequent types of attack. Over the years, many effective techniques have been developed to mitigate them, such as data execution prevention, address space layout randomization and canaries. However, if both knowledge and control of the memory allocation are available, heap spraying and other attacks are still feasible. This paper presents HAIT, a memory profiler that records critical operations on the heap and shows them <b>graphically</b> in a <b>clear</b> and comprehensible format. A prototype was implemented on top of Triton, a framework for dynamic binary analysis. The experimental evaluation demonstrates that HAIT can help identifying the essential information needed to carry out heap exploits, providing valuable knowledge for an effective attack...|$|R

Building Information Modeling (BIM) {{is a process that}} is used to resolve these problems by simulating physical space and expressing design intent <b>graphically,</b> providing a <b>clearer</b> image of design conflicts or constructability issues so that they are resolved before construction begins. Productivity rates increase as BIM practices are implemented because rework and idle time are reduced for laborers. Case studies of projects utilizing BIM indicate field productivity gains from 5 to 40 %, depending on how the process is managed. Although the amount of savings is guarded closely by those who measure and track the changes in their productivity rates and unknown to many contractors, there are indicators that reveal increased productivity. Key indicators of increased productivity are RFI reduction, amount of rework, schedule compliance, and change orders due to plan conflicts. Each of these affect the various stakeholders of a project to different degrees but the overall effect is a net savings for the owner ranging from a few percent for competitive bid projects t...|$|R
40|$|Motivation. Summarizing and {{displaying}} {{the information contained}} in a set of aligned sequences is an important aid to identifying patterns within the sequences. A variety of for-ms of consensus sequences have been used previously to provide this information. However, these methods cart cause a loss of information ol introduce ambiguities into the consensus sequence, and some graphical approaches may become difficult to interpret due to visual distortion. Results: We have developed a method to present a more precise and <b>graphically</b> <b>clear</b> view of a consensus sequence by using an approach based on defining the major components at each position in a sequence set. The major-components are given in an ordered list and their frequencies are shown as histograms which can be colour coded to reflect conservative groupings. Minor components, a one-line character-based consensus sequence and information statistics can also be presented. As well as identifying the dominant sources of variation and conservation in the sequence set, the method also enables similarities and differences between subgroups of a sequence set to be readily assessed...|$|E
40|$|Value chain deconstruction and {{reconfiguration}} {{into new}} value constellations {{is a phenomenon}} impacting many industry sectors. An important strategic issue therefore is the creation and analysis of new networked business models that cut {{across a variety of}} enterprise and market actors. In this paper we take up this issue from a design perspective, and consider the construction of networked business models for the emerging case of distributed power generation in the utility industry. We elucidate the role of regulation here: feasibility of new business models in this industry sector appears to be critically dependent on the nature of future regulations even in a so-called `deregulated' open competitive market. We discuss how our value network modeling approach provides benefits already in a non-quantitative analysis in that (1) it offers a capability to map out new business ideas <b>graphically</b> in a <b>clear</b> and communicable fashion, (2) it clarifies the position of the individual stakeholders in innovative value constellations, and (3) it gives some qualitative directions where critical points and possible opportunities for new business models are to be expected...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine two aspects of the {{self-employment}} adjustment of immigrant groups in the UK. First, how the probability of self-employment for males changes with time since migration relative to the native population and second, how the probability of self-employment for males differs between immigrants and the UK-born within ethnic groups. Design/methodology/approach – Limited dependent variable regression models are estimated using data from the UK Labour Force Survey collected between 2001 and 2005. The results are presented <b>graphically</b> to make <b>clear</b> the differences between ethnic groups. Findings – The predicted self-employment probability of “Asian” immigrants increases faster than that of natives over the lifecycle while that of “Black” groups declines. Furthermore, the observed lower propensity of UK-born members of certain ethnic groups to be in self-employment is largely explained by differences in human capital. Practical implications – High rates of self-employment amongst some ethnic groups in the UK are unlikely to be a transitory phenomenon. Originality/value – While previous work on the UK has examined patterns of self-employment between groups and over time, the paper looks for the first time at how adjustment within groups takes place over the life cycle and across nativity status.

40|$|The {{statistical}} analysis of literary style {{is the part of}} stylometry that compares measurable characteristics in a text that are rarely controlled by the author, with those in other texts. When the goal is to settle authorship questions, these characteristics should relate to the author’s style and not to the genre, epoch or editor, and they should be such that their variation between authors is larger than the variation within comparable texts from the same author. For an overview of the literature on stylometry and some of the techniques involved, see for example Mosteller and Wallace (1964, 82), Herdan (1964), Morton (1978), Holmes (1985), Oakes (1998) or Lebart, Salem and Berry (1998). Tirant lo Blanc, a chivalry book, is the main work in catalan literature and it was hailed to be “the best book {{of its kind in the}} world” by Cervantes in Don Quixote. Considered by writters like Vargas Llosa or Damaso Alonso to be the first modern novel in Europe, it has been translated several times into Spanish, Italian and French, with modern English translations by Rosenthal (1996) and La Fontaine (1993). The main body of this book was written between 1460 and 1465, but it was not printed until 1490. There is an intense and long lasting debate around its authorship sprouting from its first edition, where its introduction states that the whole book is the work of Martorell (1413 ?- 1468), while at the end it is stated that the last one fourth of the book is by Galba (?- 1490), after the death of Martorell. Some of the authors that support the theory of single authorship are Riquer (1990), Chiner (1993) and Badia (1993), while some of those supporting the double authorship are Riquer (1947), Coromines (1956) and Ferrando (1995). For an overview of this debate, see Riquer (1990). Neither of the two candidate authors left any text comparable to the one under study, and therefore discriminant analysis can not be used to help classify chapters by author. By using sample texts encompassing about ten percent of the book, and looking at word length and at the use of 44 conjunctions, prepositions and articles, Ginebra and Cabos (1998) detect heterogeneities that might indicate the existence of two authors. By analyzing the diversity of the vocabulary, Riba and Ginebra (2000) estimates that stylistic boundary to be near chapter 383. Following the lead of the extensive literature, this paper looks into word length, the use of the most frequent words and into the use of vowels in each chapter of the book. Given that the features selected are categorical, that leads to three contingency tables of ordered rows and therefore to three sequences of multinomial observations. Section 2 explores these sequences <b>graphically,</b> observing a <b>clear</b> shift in their distribution. Section 3 describes the problem of the estimation of a suden change-point in those sequences, in the following sections we propose various ways to estimate change-points in multinomial sequences; the method in section 4 involves fitting models for polytomous data, the one in Section 5 fits gamma models onto the sequence of Chi-square distances between each row profiles and the average profile, the one in Section 6 fits models onto the sequence of values taken by the first component of the correspondence analysis as well as onto sequences of other summary measures like the average word length. In Section 7 we fit models onto the marginal binomial sequences to identify the features that distinguish the chapters before and after that boundary.
