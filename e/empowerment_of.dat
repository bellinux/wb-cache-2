Women traditionally had less access to financial alternatives of ordinary credit lines and incomes. They were seen to have an inequitable share of power in household decision making. Yunus and others have found that lending to women generates considerable secondary effects, including <b>empowerment</b> <b>of</b> a marginalised segment of society (Yunus and Jolis 1998), who share betterment of income with their children, unlike many men. Yunus claims that in 2004, women still have difficulty getting loans; they comprise less than 1 percent of borrowers from commercial banks (Yunus 2004). The interest rates charged by microfinance institutes including Grameen Bank is high compared to that of traditional banks; Grameen's interest (reducing balance basis) on its main credit product is about 20%.|$|E

By exploring narratives of Cañari indigenous women in the Ecuadorian Andes, this thesis considers the meaning <b>of</b> <b>empowerment,</b> as evolved and theorised by the West, in relation to an indigenous context. It employs an exploratory, interpretevist and phenomenological approach to understanding the everyday lived experience of individuals and how they engage with the world around them. It seeks to understand the processes that indigenous women might go through in order to become empowered, considers any potential factors that might influence processes <b>of</b> <b>empowerment</b> for indigenous women, in addition to observing the possible outcomes <b>of</b> <b>empowerment</b> in both their individual lives and for the wider community.

The analysis illustrates that three main conflicts are evident when comparing the different actors' representations <b>of</b> <b>empowerment.</b> These are related to critical thinking, the conflicting individual and collective perspectives, and if the problem of disempowerment is caused by past or present structures. These conflicts in the three actors' representations <b>of</b> <b>empowerment</b> can cause bias and delay or possible failure in the policy implementation <b>of</b> black <b>empowerment,</b> yet all actors agreed on the goal <b>of</b> <b>empowerment</b> to be self-determination...|$|R
