At the massive marble table on antique Roman bases, at odds with Gregory's reputation for asceticism, John the Deacon tells that an angel joined the twelve poor men who gathered at the table to partake of Gregory's beneficence.

The newspaper stories soon bring the curious to pack his theater, and Ziegfeld introduces eight new performers to back her.

Flo sends Anna flowers and jewelry and a note saying [...] "you were magnificent my wife", and she agrees to marry him, flaunting her new diamonds to her fellow performers.|$|E

Biden answered the question remarking that anyone who has known him knew of this commitment to civil rights and race relations.

He also started deejaying, {{breaking into a}} friend's home while he was away for the weekend to practice on his turntables and eventually going on to practice freestyle deejaying <b>every</b> <b>day</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> whole summer. Goldstein started using crack cocaine {{by the age of}} 20. He said that consuming the drug and deejaying were [...] "about all he did" [...] {{for the next four years}} of his life. He would often disappear from friends and family for days at a time. In 1997, he attempted suicide; the gun jammed in his mouth as he pulled the trigger. Shortly afterwards, a friend encouraged Goldstein to become sober. He began attending Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings, avoided his friends who still took drugs, and dedicated himself to working as a DJ. Goldstein relapsed after 90 days though subsequently restarted and completed the program. People who complete the AA program are encouraged to sponsor other addicts through the recovery process; Goldstein became a sponsor for several people.|$|E

They met when Kelly was interviewed on her Sunday Arts ABC radio program. Kelly wrote [...] "You're 39, You're Beautiful and You're Mine" [...] for Prior who was already 40 by the time he finished. Prior has played clarinet and provided backing vocals on some of Kelly's songs, {{as well as with the}} Stardust Five. She has performed live with Kelly on several occasions including clarinet on six tracks of his A – Z Recordings boxed set. In his memoir, Kelly credited Prior with inspiring him to give up his long-term heroin addiction, [...] "I got lucky, I met a woman who said: 'It's me or it'. She gave me the number of a counsellor ... I thought about 'it' <b>every</b> <b>day</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long time. Less now".

JANAM {{grew out of}} the Indian People's Theatre Association (IPTA) and was {{associated}} with the Communist Party of India (Marxist), with which he was actively involved in the 1970s. When Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was accused of rigging the elections, he produced a street play, Kursi, Kursi, Kursi (Chair, Chair, Chair), as a reaction to the controversy. The play narrates the story of a king whose throne moves with him when he attempts to give it up in favour of an elected representative. The play was performed <b>every</b> <b>day</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> week, at the Boat Club Lawns in New Delhi, then a hub of political activity. It proved to be a turning point for JANAM.|$|E

2500|$|Rajneesh {{developed}} other active meditation techniques, {{such as the}} Kundalini [...] "shaking" [...] {{meditation and}} the Nadabrahma [...] "humming" [...] meditation, which are less animated, although they also include physical activity {{of one sort or}} another. His later [...] "meditative therapies" [...] require sessions for several days, OSHO Mystic Rose comprising three hours of laughing <b>every</b> <b>day</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> week, three hours of weeping each day for a second week, and a third week with three hours of silent meditation. These processes of [...] "witnessing" [...] enable a [...] "jump into awareness". Rajneesh believed such cathartic methods were necessary, since it was difficult for modern people to just sit and enter meditation. Once the methods had provided a glimpse of meditation people would be able to use other methods without difficulty.|$|E

In 1130 a synod held at Carrión dealt with the claims of Cluny to the monastery of Cornellana, disputes which had arisen from Suero and Enderquina's reversal of a prior grant. This grant had been one of the larges Cluny had received in Spain, and they argued to the Papal legate Uberto Lanfranchi at Carrión that in 1128 they had been [...] "unjustly despoiled". The synod appears to have sided with Cluny, for Humbert sent a letter to Peter the Venerable, the abbot of Cluny, claiming that Suero and Alfonso VII were simply slow to comply. Cluny was still laying claim to Cornellana over 160 years later.|$|E

Trump added, [...] "Growing up no one knew him", a claim ranked Pants-on-Fire by Politifact. Later, Trump appeared on The View repeating several times that [...] "I want him [...] to show his birth certificate." [...] He speculated that [...] "there [...] something on that birth certificate that [...] doesn’t like", a comment which host Whoopi Goldberg described as [...] "the biggest pile of dog mess I’ve heard in ages." [...] On the March 30, 2011, edition of CNN Newsroom, anchor Suzanne Malveaux commented on Trump's statements, pointing out that she had made a documentary for which she had gone to Hawaii and spoken with people who knew Obama as a child. In an NBC TV interview broadcast on April 7, 2011, Trump said he would not let go of the issue, because he was not satisfied that Obama had proved his citizenship. After Trump began making his views public, he was contacted by Joseph Farah of WorldNetDaily, who was reportedly on the phone with Trump <b>every</b> <b>day</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> week, providing Trump with a [...] "birther primer", answers to questions, and advice.
