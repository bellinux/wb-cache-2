To investigate their associations with the clinical, pathological and biological parameters, univariate statistical {{analyses were performed}} using the Pearson’s chi-square test or the Fisher’s exact test, when applicable, for categorical variables, and using the Kruskal-Wallis test or the Student’s t test for continuous variables. Survival times were measured from the date of the diagnosis of bladder cancer to the event date (or to the last available follow-up, <b>if</b> <b>not</b> <b>applicable).</b> Overall survival rates (with event defined as death from any cause) were estimated according to the Kaplan-Meier method and presented with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). Patients alive were censored at the date of the last follow-up. The median follow-up was estimated according to the « reverse Kaplan-Meier method » and presented with 95 % CIs. Survival curves were drawn and the log-rank test was performed to assess differences between groups. Multivariate analyses were carried out using Cox proportional hazards regressions with a stepwise selection procedure to investigate known prognostic factors. Hazards Ratios (HR) with 95 % CIs show the risk of experiencing the event (death from any cause) during the follow-up period.

Utilising the syntactic power of graph representation, we define a relational string-graph matching algorithm {{that seeks to}} perform these tasks simultaneously. By matching the relations between vertices, where vertices represent high-level primitives, the relational string-graph is able to overcome the noisy and inconsistent nature of the vertices themselves. For each possible relation correspondence between two graphs, we calculate the rotation, translation, and scale parameters required to transform a relation into its counterpart. We plot these parameters in 4 D space and use Gaussian mixture models and the expectation-maximisation algorithm to estimate the underlying parameters.

3000|$|A control {{condition}} C is defined over a finite set P {{of rules and}} specifies a set SEM(C) of derivations. Typical {{control condition}}s are regular expressions over P. The regular expressions have the form r for some rule r or e;e' or e|e' or e^* where e and e' are regular expressions themselves. The satisfaction of a control condition {{in the form of}} a regular expression is defined as follows. A direct derivation applying r satisfies r. A derivation satisfies e;e' if an initial section of the derivation satisfies e and the rest e'. It satisfies e|e' if it satisfies e or e'. It satisfies e^* if it satisfies e^n for some n ∈ N where e^ 0 =λ and e^(n+ 1)=e^n;e. A derivation of length 0 satisfies λ. Alternatively to e^*, e! is used. A derivation satisfies e! if it satisfies e^n, but not e^(n+ 1), i.e., e is followed as long as possible. We use also priority conditions of the form r < r' requiring that r can only be applied <b>if</b> r' is <b>not</b> <b>applicable.</b> Moreover, control conditions can be combined by logical operations of which we use the conjunction and with the obvious meaning: C & C' are satisfied if C and C' are satisfied.

40|$|Celiac Disease (CD) is a {{polygenic}} trait, and HLA genes explain {{less than}} half of the genetic variation. Through large GWAs more than 40 associated non-HLA genes were identified, but they give a small contribution to the heritability of the disease. The aim of this study is to improve the estimate of the CD risk in siblings, by adding to HLA a small set of non-HLA genes. One-hundred fifty-seven Italian families with a confirmed CD case and at least one other sib and both parents were recruited. Among 249 sibs, 29 developed CD in a 6 year follow-up period. All individuals were typed for HLA and 10 SNPs in non-HLA genes: CCR 1 /CCR 3 (rs 6441961), IL 12 A/SCHIP 1 and IL 12 A (rs 17810546 and rs 9811792), TAGAP (rs 1738074), RGS 1 (rs 2816316), LPP (rs 1464510), OLIG 3 (rs 2327832), REL (rs 842647), IL 2 /IL 21 (rs 6822844), SH 2 B 3 (rs 3184504). Three associated SNPs (in LPP, REL, and RGS 1 genes) were identified through the Transmission Disequilibrium Test and a Bayesian approach was used to assign a score (BS) to each detected HLA+SNPs genotype combination. We then classified CD sibs as at low or at high risk if their BS was respectively < or ≥ median BS value within each HLA risk group. A larger number (72 %) of CD sibs showed a BS ≥ the median value and had a more than two fold higher OR than CD sibs with a BS value < the median (O. R =  2. 53, p =  0. 047). Our HLA+SNPs genotype classification, showed both a higher predictive negative value (95 % vs 91 %) and diagnostic sensitivity (79 % vs 45 %) than the HLA only. In conclusion, the estimate of the CD risk by HLA+SNPs approach, even <b>if</b> <b>not</b> <b>applicable</b> to prevention, could be a precious tool to improve the prediction of the disease in a cohort of first degree relatives, particularly in the low HLA risk groups...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe demand {{regulation}} for airport infrastructures is managed, {{depending on}} the location within the world, typically by slot allocation schemes. Slot allocation for the biggest part of the relevant airports is organized {{in accordance with the}} IATA Worldwide Slot Guidelines, IATA-WSG. In Europe, Regulation 95 / 93 including its amendments as local rule with relation to IATA-WSG builds the basis for airport slot allocation. Key element of the slot allocation according to this principle is the fragmentation of the declared capacity into time niches, better known as airport slots. A weak spot with this is the usage of the capacity estimation which has to cover a full scheduling season. Those having been allocated a slot are allowed {{to make use of the}} airport infrastructure in general. Demanding airlines without a slot for this airport may request spontaneously a free slot, if available. <b>If</b> <b>not</b> <b>applicable,</b> additional demand's requests are waived. This system limits the serviced demand and assures thereby a reliable level of service at service process stations, e. g. the runway, apron, or terminal. From a strategic point of view this capped demand may cause economic losses due to waived additional airport charges also in situations with capacity well above the average expected value, which was used to calculate the official declared capacity. A second problem with resource usage efficiency arises instead of conservative calculations regarding the available capacity by the variance in resource usage by slot holding airlines. Delayed use of infrastructure may cause excessive demand in later time frames, instead the slot allocation and its levelling effect. Knock-on delays affect the following turnarounds and may destabilize network-wide connections. Especially for the resilience of door-to-door managed networks, process stability is a key ingredient for success. Arrival and departure deviations in aviation may preclude sustainable co-modality by its variability. Both primary as well as secondary delays may jeopardize connections between different or same modes of transportation, and the affected passenger may be stranded at least at the mode's transfer point. By introducing an incentive to avoid primary delays and by foreclosing the propagation of secondary delays within networks, an increase in level of service like process stability or punctuality is realizable. The research topic was to evaluate possibilities to increase resource usage efficiency by changing the methods of slot allocation. Therefore, a priority-based system was created and verified by a simplified microscopic simulation model. Priorities were allocated in advance, representing different categories of resource availability estimation. A second extension to the system was given by a performance-based component. The preselected priority was allocated to the demanding aircraft with up-/downgrades depending on its own punctuality. Despite the increased data exchange volume needed to realize this resource allocation scheme in reality, benefits in resource efficiency and turnaround stability are clearly observable. Different priorities in scheduling are an incentive to schedule with different levels of availability of infrastructures already during strategic planning, whereas the vehicle-oriented performance-based prioritization in operations is suitable to avoid any secondary delay propagation and to increase the system's fairness...|$|E

30|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to compare pain perception during and after surgery between abdominal hysterectomy (AH), laparoscopic hysterectomy (LH), and vaginal hysterectomy (VH). The secondary {{objective of this}} study is to investigate whether pain indicators during surgery predict pain perception and demand for analgesics postoperatively. Prospective observational analysis of intraoperative nociceptive state (by means of pulse transit time; PTT), heart rate, and stress hormone levels (adrenalin and noradrenalin) were correlated with postoperative pain scores and stress hormone levels and demand for postoperative analgesics such as morphine. Intraoperative PTT levels and perioperative and postoperative stress hormone levels did not differ significantly between AH, LH, and VH. During the first hours postoperatively, LH patients showed insignificant lower pain scores, compared to AH and VH. One day postoperatively, LH patients reported significantly lower pain scores. High intraoperative stress hormone levels predicted a significant higher demand for morphine postoperatively, accompanied with significant higher pain scores. No differences were found with respect to intraoperative pain indicators well as pain perception during the first hours after surgery between AH, LH, and VH. <b>If</b> VH is <b>not</b> <b>applicable,</b> LH proves to be advantageous over AH with respect to a faster decline in pain scores.|$|R

The aim of the present report was to review and compare the performance of PET/CT {{with some of the}} conventional imaging modalities in detection of breast cancer recurrence. Methods: A literature search was performed in PubMed, Europe PMC and ScienceDirect databases with no search restriction for the date of publication but the search was limited to papers published in English. Results: Twenty-two studies including a total of 1378 patients with prior breast cancer and clinical suspicion of recurrence that assessed the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of PET/CT and other conventional imaging methods in followed up by treated breast cancer and presented the results in systematic review format.
