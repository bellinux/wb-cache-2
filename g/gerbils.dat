5|$|The least weasel feeds {{predominantly}} on mouse-like rodents, including mice, hamsters, <b>gerbils</b> and others. It {{usually does}} not attack adult hamsters and rats. Frogs, fish, small birds and bird eggs are rarely eaten. It {{can deal with}} adult pikas and <b>gerbils,</b> but usually cannot overcome brown rats and sousliks. Exceptional cases are known of least weasels killing prey far larger than themselves, such as capercaillie, hazel hen and hares. In England, a favoured prey item is the field vole (Microtus agrestis). These have fluctuations in population size, and in years of abundance may form up to 54% of the weasel's diet. In years of scarcity, birds form {{a greater proportion of}} the diet and female least weasels may fail to breed.|$|E
5|$|Rodents {{including}} guinea pigs, mice, rats, hamsters, <b>gerbils,</b> chinchillas, degus and chipmunks make convenient pets {{able to live}} {{in small}} spaces, each species with its own qualities. Most are normally kept in cages of suitable sizes and have varied requirements for space and social interaction. If handled from a young age, they are usually docile and do not bite. Guinea pigs have a long lifespan and need a large cage. Rats also need plenty of space and can become very tame, can learn tricks and seem to enjoy human companionship. Mice are short-lived but take up very little space. Hamsters are solitary but tend to be nocturnal. They have interesting behaviors, but unless handled regularly they may be defensive. <b>Gerbils</b> are not usually aggressive, rarely bite and are sociable animals that enjoy the company of humans and their own kind.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the {{colonization}} of the world's continents by rodents is complex. The movements of the large superfamily Muroidea (including hamsters, <b>gerbils,</b> true mice and rats) may have involved up to seven colonizations of Africa, five of North America, four of Southeast Asia, two of South America and up to ten of Eurasia.|$|E
50|$|The Somalia <b>gerbil</b> is one {{of eight}} very similar species of <b>gerbil</b> native to northeastern Africa, the others being Berbera <b>gerbil</b> (G. acticola), Brockman's <b>gerbil</b> (G. brockmani), {{cushioned}} <b>gerbil</b> (G. pulvinatus), Harwood's <b>gerbil</b> (Dipodillus harwoodi), least <b>gerbil</b> G. pusillus, Somalian <b>gerbil</b> Dipodillus somalicus and Waters's <b>gerbil</b> (G. watersi). The Somalia <b>gerbil</b> can be distinguished from the others by the hairy soles to its hind feet. The head-and-body length is about 98 mm and the tail 135 mm. The mass is about 38 g.|$|R
50|$|The dune hairy-footed <b>gerbil</b> or Namib dune <b>gerbil,</b> Gerbillurus tytonis, is {{a species}} of <b>gerbil</b> found only in Namibia. Its natural habitat is {{temperate}} desert.|$|R
50|$|The Namib brush-tailed <b>gerbil</b> or Setzer's hairy-footed <b>gerbil</b> (Gerbillurus setzeri), is {{a species}} of <b>gerbil</b> in Angola and Namibia. Its natural {{habitats}} are hot deserts and temperate desert.|$|R
5|$|Allergic symptoms, {{including}} rhinitis, conjunctivitis, and asthma, {{have been}} documented in laboratory animal workers who {{come into contact with}} guinea pigs. Allergic reactions following direct exposure to guinea pigs in domestic settings have also been reported. Two major guinea pig allergens, Cav p I and Cav p II, have been identified in guinea pig fluids (urine and saliva) and guinea pig dander. People who are allergic to guinea pigs are usually allergic to hamsters and <b>gerbils,</b> as well. Allergy shots can successfully treat an allergy to guinea pigs, although treatment can take up to 18 months.|$|E
5|$|Species can be arboreal, fossorial (burrowing), or semiaquatic. Well-known rodents include mice, rats, squirrels, prairie dogs, porcupines, beavers, guinea pigs, hamsters, <b>gerbils</b> and capybaras. Other {{animals such as}} rabbits, hares, and pikas, whose incisors also grow continually, {{were once}} {{included}} with them, but are now considered {{to be in a}} separate order, the Lagomorpha. Nonetheless, Rodentia and Lagomorpha are sister groups, sharing a most recent common ancestor and forming the clade of Glires.|$|E
5|$|In the Caucasus and Transcaucasia, golden jackals {{primarily}} hunt hares and mouse-like rodents, {{and also}} pheasants, francolins, ducks, coots, moorhens, and passerines. Vegetable matter eaten by jackals {{in these areas}} includes fruits, such as pears, hawthorn, dogwood, and the cones of common medlars. The jackal is implicated {{in the destruction of}} grape, watermelon, muskmelon, and nut crops. Near the Vakhsh River, their spring diet consists almost exclusively of plant bulbs and the roots of wild sugar cane, while during winter they feed on wild stony olives. Around the edges of the Karakum Desert, jackals feed on <b>gerbils,</b> lizards, snakes, fish, muskrats, the fruits of wild stony olives, mulberry, dried apricots, watermelons, muskmelons, tomatoes, and grapes.|$|E

5|$|Guinea pigs do not {{generally}} thrive when housed with other species. Housing of guinea pigs with other rodents such as <b>gerbils</b> and hamsters may increase instances of respiratory and other infections, and such rodents may act aggressively toward the guinea pig. Larger animals may regard guinea pigs as prey, though some (such as dogs) {{can be trained}} to accept them. Opinion is divided over the cohousing of guinea pigs and domestic rabbits. Some published sources say that guinea pigs and rabbits complement each other well when sharing a cage. However, as lagomorphs, rabbits have different nutritional requirements, so the two species cannot be fed the same food. Rabbits may also harbor diseases (such as respiratory infections from Bordetella and Pasteurella), to which guinea pigs are susceptible. Even the dwarf rabbit is much stronger than the guinea pig and may cause intentional or inadvertent injury.|$|E
5|$|The {{golden jackal}} often hunts alone, and {{sometimes}} in pairs, but rarely hunts in a pack. When hunting alone, it trots around an area and occasionally stops to sniff and listen. Once prey is located, the jackal conceals itself, quickly approaches its prey and then pounces on it. Single jackals hunt rodents, hares, and birds. They hunt rodents in grass by locating them with their hearing before leaping {{into the air and}} pouncing on them. In India, they can dig Indian <b>gerbils</b> out from their burrows, and they can hunt young, old, and infirm ungulates up to 4â€“5 times their body weight. Jackals search for hiding blackbuck calves throughout the day during the calving period. The peak times for their searches are the early morning and the late evening. When hunting in pairs or packs, jackals run parallel to their prey and overtake it in unison. When hunting aquatic rodents or birds, they will run along both sides of narrow rivers or streams and drive their prey from one jackal to another.|$|E
5|$|Typically diurnal, {{the jungle}} cat hunts {{throughout}} the day. Solitary in nature, jungle cats do not interact appreciably {{except in the}} mating season. The only prominent interaction is the mother-kitten bond. Territories are maintained by urine spraying and scent marking. The cat is primarily a carnivore, and prefers small mammals (<b>gerbils,</b> hares and rodents) and birds. It hunts by stalking its prey, followed by a sprint or a leap; the sharp ears help in pinpointing the location of prey. Both sexes become sexually mature {{by the time they}} are a year old; females enter oestrus from January to March. Mating behaviour is similar to that in the domestic cat: the male pursues the female in oestrus, seizes her by {{the nape of her neck}} and mounts her. Gestation lasts nearly two months. Births take place between December and June, though this might vary geographically. Kittens begin to catch their own prey at around six months and leave the mother after eight or nine months.|$|E

5|$|In the U.S., {{the numbers}} of rats and mice used is {{estimated}} to be from 11 million to between 20 and 100 million a year. Other rodents commonly used are guinea pigs, hamsters, and <b>gerbils.</b> Mice are the most commonly used vertebrate species because of their size, low cost, ease of handling, and fast reproduction rate. Mice are widely considered to be the best model of inherited human disease and share 99% of their genes with humans. With the advent of genetic engineering technology, genetically modified mice can be generated to order and can provide models for a range of human diseases. Rats are also widely used for physiology, toxicology and cancer research, but genetic manipulation is much harder in rats than in mice, which limits the use of these rodents in basic science. Over 500,000 fish and 10,000 amphibians were used in the UK in 2016. The main species used is the zebrafish, Danio rerio, which are translucent during their embryonic stage, and the African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis. Over 20,000 rabbits were used for animal testing in the UK in 2004. Albino rabbits are used in eye irritancy tests (Draize test) because rabbits have less tear flow than other animals, and the lack of eye pigment in albinos make the effects easier to visualize. The numbers of rabbits used for this purpose has fallen substantially over the past two decades, in 1996, there were 3,693 procedures on rabbits for eye irritation in the UK, in 2016 this number was just 128. Rabbits are also frequently used for the production of polyclonal antibodies.|$|E
25|$|The {{several reasons}} for the {{popularity}} of <b>gerbils</b> as household pets include: The animals are typically not aggressive, and they rarely bite unprovoked or without stress. They are small and easy to handle, since they are sociable creatures that enjoy the company of humans and other <b>gerbils.</b> <b>Gerbils</b> also have adapted their kidneys to produce a minimum of waste to conserve body fluids, which makes them very clean with little odor.|$|E

25|$|Memory {{capabilities}} decline with age, {{evident in}} human degenerative {{diseases such as}} Alzheimer's disease, which is accompanied by an accumulation of oxidative damage. Current studies demonstrate that the accumulation of ROS can decrease an organism's fitness because oxidative damage is a contributor to senescence. In particular, the accumulation of oxidative damage may lead to cognitive dysfunction, as demonstrated in a study in which old rats were given mitochondrial metabolites and then given cognitive tests. Results showed that the rats performed better after receiving the metabolites, suggesting that the metabolites reduced oxidative damage and improved mitochondrial function. Accumulating oxidative damage can then affect the efficiency of mitochondria and further increase the rate of ROS production. The accumulation of oxidative damage {{and its implications for}} aging depends on the particular tissue type where the damage is occurring. Additional experimental results suggest that oxidative damage is responsible for age-related decline in brain functioning. Older <b>gerbils</b> were found to have higher levels of oxidized protein in comparison to younger <b>gerbils.</b> Treatment of old and young mice with a spin trapping compound caused a decrease in the level of oxidized proteins in older <b>gerbils</b> but did not have an effect on younger <b>gerbils.</b> In addition, older <b>gerbils</b> performed cognitive tasks better during treatment but ceased functional capacity when treatment was discontinued, causing oxidized protein levels to increase. This led researchers to conclude that oxidation of cellular proteins is potentially important for brain function.|$|E
