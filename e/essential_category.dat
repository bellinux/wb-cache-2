5000|$|Because van der Leeuw, like Kristensen, appropriates Otto’s {{concept of}} das Heilige in {{defining}} the <b>essential</b> <b>category</b> of religion, the transcendence becoming revealed in all human understanding can be further described as sacred — an overpowering “wholly other,” which becomes revealed in astonishing moments of dreadful awe (Scheu) and wonderful fascination. Van der Leeuw argues that this concept of religious dread is also present in Kierkegaard’s work on Angst and in Heidegger’s statement that “what arouses dread is ‘being in the world’ itself”. Moreover, van der Leeuw recognizes that, although dreadful, Being-in-the-world is fundamentally characterized as [...] (Sorge), the existential structure whereby Dasein is concerned with meaningful relationships in the world alongside other beings.|$|E
50|$|The {{history of}} {{emotions}} {{has become an}} increasingly popular topic recently, with some scholars arguing {{that it is an}} <b>essential</b> <b>category</b> of analysis, not unlike class, race, or gender. Historians, like other social scientists, assume that emotions, feelings and their expressions are regulated in different ways by both different cultures and different historical times, and the constructivist school of history claims even that some sentiments and meta-emotions, for example Schadenfreude, are learnt and not only regulated by culture. Historians of emotion trace and analyse the changing norms and rules of feeling, while examining emotional regimes, codes, and lexicons from social, cultural, or political history perspectives. Others focus on the history of medicine, science, or psychology. What somebody can and may feel (and show) in a given situation, towards certain people or things, depends on social norms and rules; thus historically variable and open to change. Several research centers have opened {{in the past few years}} in Germany, England, Spain, Sweden, and Australia.|$|E

40|$|Background. In psychoanalytic psychotherapy, the {{transference}} analysis {{takes the}} central {{position of the}} work. The work in the extratransference sphere and experience in a professional practice with extratransference interventions have not been reported much in the literature. Extratransference sphere includes less transferring relation to a psychotherapist, transference to other objects, or may refer to the external reality rather than the psychic reality or fantasy. Case report. We pointed out extratransference interventions. We demonstrated an application of a genetic interpretation and reconstruction, too, which could restore and establish the connections between {{the past and the}} present, {{in order to understand the}} influences of the current reality and the past, and helping us, further, to resolve the infantile conflicts. Conclusion. Interpretation of extratransference situations takes an important part of an analytical work and it is an <b>essential</b> <b>category</b> of the interpretation. Analytic understanding should include transference and extratransference spheres, fantasy and reality, past and present. Working with neurotic patterns and character resistance needs an optimal choice of intervention in the given moment of the analytic process.

The Vitek system provided an <b>essential</b> <b>category</b> correlation of 89. 4 % for enteric bacteria and 97. 0 % for P. aeruginosa. Vitek MICs agreed within 1 twofold dilutional increment for 86. 3 % of the enteric bacteria tested and for 96. 2 % of the P. aeruginosa isolates.

We propose the Moldable Inspector, a novel inspector model that enables developers to adapt the inspection workflow to suit their immediate needs by making the inspection context explicit, providing multiple interchangeable domain-specific views for each object, and supporting a workflow that groups together multiple levels of connected objects. We show that the Moldable Inspector can address multiple kinds of development needs involving a wide range of objects...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to examine {{representations}} of masculinity {{in the activities of}} a local professional wrestling promotion. After briefly outlining what professional wrestling is, the study draws on a body on feminist and intersectional theory which critiques the notion of gender as a binary and <b>essential</b> <b>category.</b> The material comprises 10 recorded shows and oth- er material published on Sthlm Wrestling’s website between 2010 and 2013, and is analyzed using a qualitative methodology derived from cultural studies. The thesis argues that there are many different types of masculinities in the narrative, which are constructed in relation to different power hierarchies such as ethnicity, class, sex and sexuality. The few female wrestlers are marginalized, but not sexualized as in the U. S. context. The heels (rule-breakers) are found on the borders of social and cultural categories, and there is an explicit SM-narrative present. ...|$|E

40|$|Returning to a {{question}} raised by M. V.

These assumptions let “the family” stand automatically for a husband, wife, and their children. “Heteronormativity” is not a synonym for heterosexual privilege, but rather names tacit conceptions about what is socially normal, conceptions that make it possible to think of heterosexuals or homosexuals as <b>essential</b> <b>categories</b> of people. Critique of heteronormativity makes visible a pattern of state repression that makes proper citizens by opposing them to improper ones, a process that simultaneously shapes gender, sexuality, citizenship, and race. Such critique opens the opportunity to better understand gender, integrate scholarship on lesbians and gays, link gender analysis more directly to racializing processes, and reopen the category of heterosexuality.
