40|$|Teacher {{mobility}} is {{a process}} with old routes in the history, but its importance was emphasized {{only in the past}} 25 years, once education sector of member states became an important subject on European agenda. The interest for teacher mobility and as a result the great support provided emerged along with establishment of main priorities of European Union among which raising awareness of member states citizens about <b>EU</b> <b>citizenships</b> became a primary goal. In this order Lifelong Learning Programme Comenius was especially designed for the education area to offer the framework to schools‘ actors for participation in international mobility activities. Theoretical framework regarding mobility ―as a process of change affecting modes of behaviour or trajectories of individuals or social groups‖ was enriched concomitantly. Besides the positive achievements on the path of teacher mobility developments, there were met obstacles and limits discussed in the specialized literature on education and teacher mobility. On the other hand precise estimates on teacher mobility in Estonia comprising researches on affects and teachers‘ approach towards mobility are lacking. This research was carried out to identify the main factors affecting the decision making process of teachers from Estonian schools from Ida-Virumaa and Harjumaa to participate in international mobility activities in the frame of Comenius programme. Furthermore policy recommendations were made based on the findings in the study in order to decrease the negative impact of the identified factors on teachers‘ approach towards international mobility...|$|R

40|$|Two main {{ideas have}} {{inspired}} the present paper. First, since {{the birth of}} the European Communities EU migration policy has been influenced by the long-lasting dichotomy between “State EU-citizen” versus “non-EU national”. In the period 1999 - 2000 the Tampere Conclusions and the Nice Charter gave new zest to Brussels-driven migration policy of non-EU nationals. The bunch of rights of non-EU migrants was then extended during the recent years by relevant EC Directives, so that its gap with the set of <b>EU</b> <b>citizenship’s</b> special rights has been reduced. Second, in the institutional EU structure there is no regional (nor local, in the broad sense) decision-making process concerning non-EU nationals. Indeed, in the field of EU migration policy, from {{the birth of the}} three European Communities, decision-making has been shaped as an inter-State process, eventually transferred from European capitals to Brussels (EU Executive) and Strasbourg (European Parliament). The concept of the Westphalian States (having priority relations with “their” citizens and inhabitants) therefore remains deeply in-rooted in the establishment of main EU actions and programmes related to migrants, where regional and local powers have a subordinate role of policy-takers. This role is limited to implementing EU mainstream decisions taken in Brussels and Strasbourg. Moreover, in the present Lisbon Treaty only State-centered bodies as National Parliaments have a word to say towards EU legislative proposals, but regional assemblies and the Committee of Regions can still intervene in their advisory capacity under the new Subsidiarity Protocol. The Lisbon Subsidiarity acknowledges the importance of Regions. This can help develop the role of regional and local powers in the EU migration policies. A source of concern is that statistics on EU migrations are mainly collected and processed on a national State-scale, neglecting the local dimension of migration inside each concerned Member State and therefore jeopardizing the paramount importance of migrations phenomena at regional and local level. Scarce perception of solidarity among European municipalities, (for instance the well-known North-South geographic racism or the hidden conflict between East and West migrations in Europe) is another point this paper highlights. This lack of solidarity would hamper the possible implementation of the “EU constitutional patriotism” preached by Habermas into the regional and municipal dimension of migrations. In the worst economic scenario, degenerative regionalism and localism could lead to a policy of intolerance and xenophobia arising from local (regional or municipal) stakeholders against any kind of migration, disregarding the EU or non-EU nationality of migrants...|$|R
40|$|The {{question}} {{in this article}} is how citizenship is reinvented and recontextualized in a newly founded European Union after the launching of Union Citizenship. What kind of conceptions of citizenship are produced in this new and evolving organization?

I will analyze conceptual similarities (continuities) and differences (discontinuities) between these documents and previous conceptualizations in various contexts, including citizenship discussions in the history of integration since the 1970 s as well as theories of democracy and nation-states.

40|$|The {{formulation}} of Union citizenship has concentrated on rights since the 1970 s. In the Maastricht and subsequent <b>EU</b> treaties, Union <b>citizenship</b> is defined through rights. Against this background, discussion on {{rights in the}} <b>EU</b> documents on <b>citizenship</b> analysed {{in this article is}} surprisingly scarce. The research material consists of 15 documents produced by EU institutions in 2003 – 2007 as part of three programmes on citizenship. In the documents, the discussion on rights focuses on mobility instead of other aspects of rights. Electoral rights and fundamental rights are discussed a little, but in general, the minuscule discussion on rights is dominated by discussions on freedom of mobility, which appears {{to be the most important}} right of the Union citizen. Union citizenship is understood above all as citizenship of a mobile person and as a status guaranteeing freedom of movement. Conception of free movement as the core of citizens’ rights keep up the citizenship discussions in the history of integration. Freedom for mobility lies also in the core of the area of freedom, security and justice – an area construct discussed in the documents. Both Union citizenship and the area of freedom, security and justice are innovations, through which EU can use power in the nation states’ traditional fields of action: border control and citizenship. The central position given to the freedom of mobility and its connection with the economy as well as understanding citizenship rather as a status than practice link the Union citizenship formulated in the rights discussions to the liberalist tradition. Discussions on freedom of mobility imply both promoting and regulating mobility as well as crossing and drawing borders. In this kind of discussions on rights, Union citizenship appears as a category with which people and mobility as well as the entire integration can be governed. These discussions do not promote citizenship as political agency...|$|R
40|$|From the Introduction. The Treaty on European Union, {{also known}} as the Treaty of Maastricht or the Maastricht Treaty, created the European Union (EU) from the {{existing}} European Economic Community (EEC.) It was signed by the member states on February 7, 1992, and entered into force on November 1, 1993. 1 Among its many innovations was the creation of European citizenship, which would be granted to any person who was a citizen of an <b>EU</b> member state. <b>Citizenship,</b> however, is intertwined with immigration, which the Treaty also attempted to address. Policy on visas, immigration and asylum was originally placed under Pillar 3 of the EU, which dealt with Justice and Home Affairs. In 1997, however, the Amsterdam Treaty moved these policies from Pillar 3 to Pillar 1, signaling “a shift toward more supranational decision-making in this area,” as opposed to the intergovernmental method of Pillars 2 and 3. ...|$|R
40|$|Same-sex couples’ rights when {{it comes}} to {{marriage}} can be best advanced through equal enjoyment of citizenship status. Protections through the concept of private life will be of limited effect in this context. Comparison of the jurisprudence of the European Union (EU) and the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) demonstrates the contrasting approaches to the treatment of same-sex couples and highlights the preferable path. Both systems have traditionally had restrictive roles in the legal protections offered to gays and same-sex couples. Differences in treatment remain {{despite the fact that the}} two systems have started to converge and offer more generous protections. The European Court of Human Rights has led the way in the protection of rights for gays and same-sex couples. The <b>EU</b> concept of <b>citizenship</b> together with a closer interplay with the ECHR may offer the greater support for those who favour same-sex marriage...|$|R

30|$|In the {{dimension}} of international political objectives, Turkey’s bid {{to become a member}} of the EU is comparable to Mexico’s interest in NAFTA, with several major differences. Turkey is trying to accede to an advanced level of regional integration; both the conditions of accession are more demanding, and a possible future membership would have more serious economic and political implications. When accession is high in Turkish political agenda, emigrants might have invaluable influence on the attitude of current members whose approval is indispensable, and in particular Germany, the biggest member of the EU (Østergaard-Nielsen, 2003 d,e). Furthermore, EU membership has direct implications for citizenship; if Turkish emigrants in Germany were classified as EU citizens, they would be subject to privileged treatment for dual citizenship without the requirement of renouncing their existing nationality. In other words, the effect of Turkey’s accession to the <b>EU</b> on plural <b>citizenship</b> would be equivalent to convincing Germany to amend her nationality law.|$|R

40|$|Since the mid- 1990 s, {{automatic}} citizenship {{for children}} {{born in the}} Republic {{has been a source}} of growing debate against a backdrop of increasing immigration and the peace process. In June 2004, the debate culminated in a referendum, opening the way to a constitutional amendment that attaches residence qualifications to the hitherto unfettered entitlement to citizenship available through ius soli. Arguments for the amendment were couched in terms of a threat posed by Third World women having babies in Ireland to obtain residence, and a putative obligation to the <b>EU</b> to harmonise <b>citizenship</b> laws. This article explores how pregnant foreign women’s bodies became a site of perplexity about the borders of the twenty-first century Irish nation. It is therefore suggested that neither the ‘racial state’ theories nor feminist theories of the nation-state account fully for this. On closer inspection, the seemingly sui generis case of the Irish referendum is therefore fruitful in that it demands further reflection in terms of bridging gaps in the existing theory...|$|R
