5|$|Murder on the Orient Express is {{the first}} game in the Agatha Christie series to feature Hercule Poirot, Christie's most popular and famous detective. David Suchet, whose {{portrayal}} of Poirot achieved fame through the popular television series Agatha Christie's Poirot, was hired to provide Poirot's voice. His performance was generally met with praise. Some have criticized the game for not allowing the player to actually control Poirot; the developers explained this choice by saying that adventure gamers who make mistakes throughout the game <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>reflect</b> the genius of Poirot, but are better represented by amateur sleuth Antoinette Marceau.|$|E
5|$|The ratings also <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>reflect</b> state-specific {{population}} conditions. For instance, for the Texas horned lizard, much {{of eastern}} Texas {{has lost the}} animal. Nevertheless, based on healthy populations {{in other parts of}} the West, especially New Mexico, the IUCN rates the animal Least Concern. For the timber rattlesnake (West Virginia), the IUCN notes the animal as losing range in many parts of the northeastern U.S., but because the animal is numerous in the southern Appalachians, it is also Least Concern.|$|E

Since the European Central Bank plans to redesign the notes every seven or eight years after each issue, a second series of banknotes is already in preparation. New production and anti-counterfeiting techniques will be employed on the new notes, but the design will be of the same theme and colours identical of the current series; bridges and arches. However, they would still be recognisable as a new series.|$|E

Thus, the change in R-square will reflect the percent of variance explained by the variable added to the model.
