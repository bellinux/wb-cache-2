2500|$|One {{characteristic}} of major sociological importance distinguishing Quebec French from European French is the relatively {{greater number of}} borrowings from English, especially in the informal spoken language. In contrast, Quebecers show a stronger aversion {{to the use of}} anglicisms in formal contexts than do European francophones, largely because of what the influence of English on their language is held to reveal about the historically superior position of anglophones in Canadian society. According to Cajolet-Laganière and Martel, out of 4,216 [...] "criticized borrowings from English" [...] in Quebec French {{that they were able to}} identify, some 93% have [...] "extremely low frequency" [...] and 60% are obsolete.

40|$|Sialic acids {{present on}} luminal {{surfaces}} of vascular endothelium {{were determined by}} perfusing neuraminidase free of proteolytic activity through carotid arteries, iliac arteries and jugular veins of anaesthetized rabbits and guinea-pigs and through human umbilical veins. Total sialic acids released in I h from arteries and veins, determined fluorimetrically, were 24 - 51 X 10 (6) molecules/micron 2 endothelial surface; this was more, by up to two orders of magnitude, than sialic acids releasable by neuraminidase from other types of cells, i. e. from 0. 15 X 10 (6) for human erythrocytes to 15 X 10 (6) for human platelets. Sialic acids therefore provide <b>extraordinarily</b> high <b>negative</b> charge densities on vascular surfaces exposed to the flowing blood. As all circulating cells are also negatively charged, strong electrostatic repulsion must exist between them and normal vessel walls. These observations can therefore account for the general property of non-adherence of circulating cells in normal blood vessels of which the so-called 'non-thrombogenicity', meaning the non-adherence of platelets to normal vascular endothelium, is one example. It is suggested that a major biological function of these <b>extraordinarily</b> high <b>negative</b> charge concentrations is the mutual repulsion between endothelial surfaces and blood cells which promotes their unimpeded circulation...|$|R
40|$|The {{volume of}} {{ordinary}} materials decreases {{in response to}} a pressure increase exerted by a surrounding gas or liquid, i. e., the material volume compressibility is positive. Recently, poroelastic metamaterial architectures have been suggested theoretically that allow for an unusual negative effective static volume compressibility—which appears to be forbidden for reasons of energy conservation at first sight. The challenge in the three-dimensional (3 D) fabrication of these blueprints lies in the necessary many hollow 3 D crosses sealed by thin membranes, which we realize in this work by using 3 D laser microlithography combined with a serendipitous mechanism. By using optical-microscopy cross-correlation analysis, we determine an <b>extraordinarily</b> large <b>negative</b> metamaterial effective volume compressibility of κ_{eff}=- 0. 8 %[*][*]bar^{- 1 }=- 80 [*][*]GPa^{- 1 } under pressure control...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Adaptive {{cruise control}} (ACC), a {{technology}} that allows for automated car following, is becoming increasingly prevalent. Previous surveys have shown that drivers generally regard ACC as pleasant but {{that they have to}} intervene when the ACC reaches its operational limits. The former research has been mostly concerned with specific car brands and does not fully reflect the diversity of ACC types in traffic today. The objective of the present research was to establish the determinants of pleasure in using ACC. Methods: A 55 -item online questionnaire was completed by Dutch users of diverse ACC systems. Results: Respondents (N = 182) rated their ACC highly, with a mean score of 8. 0 on a scale from 1 (<b>extraordinarily</b> <b>negative)</b> to 10 (extraordinarily positive) and were most pleased with ACC on high-speed roads and in low-density traffic. Moreover, the findings point to specific operational limits such as associated with cut-in situations. Pleasure was greater for the types of ACC that are able to decelerate to a full stop, according to 48 % of our sample. An analysis of the free-response items indicated that respondents who were displeased with ACC mentioned its occasional clumsiness and the dangerous situations it may evoke, whereas those who were pleased with ACC valued the complementarity of human and machine and emphasized the roles of responsibility and experience in using ACC. Conclusion: Pleasure in using ACC is a function of both technological advances and human factors. </p...|$|E

50|$|Chief Designer Wiet Huidekoper {{started with}} a clean sheet of paper for the T92/10 and {{following}} extensive windtunnel development with scale models, achieving <b>extraordinarily</b> high down-force (<b>negative</b> lift) figures combined with modest drag giving the car a very high L/D ("lift-to-drag") ratio. The car had a much smaller windscreen and cock-pit roof section than Lola's previous Group-C designs. The new car had two large air intakes on the nose, which provided the air for the engine cooling and to cool the brakes. These sat much farther back than on the previous Lola designs {{in order to improve}} aerodynamics and to increase cooling. This made for a small flat nose which gave the Lola T92/10 its distinctive and elegant look. An engine inlet would be added to the roof of the car given that the T92/10s would be normally aspirated. The sculpted sidepods were a departure from the norm. The rear would also be radically different from the previous Lola designed Nissan Group-C car, supporting a tall wing instead of the single element wing that had been previously used.|$|R
40|$|The role of {{liquidity}} in asset {{pricing model}} has {{attracted much attention}} in recent financial studies; however there is a paucity of literature with respect to liquidity risk and asset pricing in the direct housing market. The housing market is characterized by costly searching, inelastic supply and short-sale constraints. It is expected that the housing market should incur more significant illiquid effects, since {{it is much more}} illiquid than stock market. Motivated by this intuition, this thesis aims to explore 1) whether and to what extent liquidity can explain variations in over-time/crosssectional housing returns; and 2) whether liquidity factor plays a role in explaining the second moment (i. e. volatility) of housing price. We employ the panel regression and Fama-MacBeth two-stage procedure to investigate over-time and cross-sectional relations between liquidity and housing return. Liquidity asset pricing theory suggests that assets with lower degree of liquidity offer higher expected returns. Consistent with this prediction, the panel regression results suggest that housing return is a decreasing function of liquidity in previous year, while it is positively relative to contemporary liquidity shocks. For the cross-sectional asset pricing tests, housing estate specific betas are estimated using rolling time-series regressions of a three-factor asset pricing model. We investigate the proposition that housing estates with greater return sensitivity to market liquidity earns higher expected return. Using a disaggregate dataset of 55 popular housing estates, we find (1) both market liquidity beta and housing estate specific liquidity risk are significantly priced in the cross-sectional housing estate returns, implying that cross-sectional differences in estate premium partially represent the liquidity premium. (2) The market beta, sentiment beta and market liquidity beta explain 14. 36 % of variations in cross-sectional estate returns. The results are robust across different specifications. (3) Investors are less willing to bear liquidity risk during the down markets, which shed new light on the positive price-volume correlation. These findings complement the cross-sectional liquidity-return relationship in the financial literature. Measuring housing price volatility is fundamental {{to the study of the}} dynamics of housing price risk. We investigate the effects of liquidity on housing price volatility in different housing classes (classified by size of the housing unit according to the Rating and Valuation Department’s definitions). Housing price volatility is measured as the conditional variance of a GARCH model under the Adaptive Expectations framework. We reveal that volatility transmits from small housing units to large housing units, which indirectly supports the trade-up effect in previous literature. Besides, the starter and high-end housing classes are <b>extraordinarily</b> sensitive to <b>negative</b> and positive liquidity shocks respectively. Consistent with the friction search theory, we find that the pricing errors are alleviated as the trading volume increases, since the valuated price tends to be more accurate as more information arrives. Lastly, the variance decomposition and impulse response results imply that the positive liquidity shock accounts for a large proportion of variations in housing volatility. published_or_final_versionReal Estate and ConstructionDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis seeks {{to explore the}} socio-political economy of antiretroviral treatment (ART) as an HIV prevention strategy in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and, specifically, in Mozambique. We begin {{with a look at}} the social construction of HIV in SSA as a ‘sexually transmitted disease’ despite its very low transmission efficiency through heterosexual sex. This inordinate focus on sexual transmission in SSA to the exclusion of other routes of transmission (i. e. : blood-borne transmission) not only allows new infections to continue to occur in areas that do not receive attention, but also has both fed and been fed by a political and social climate that paints an <b>extraordinarily</b> <b>negative</b> picture of those who are infected with HIV. Alternatives to the ineffective and misguided sexual behavior prevention paradigm are introduced to conclude Chapter 1. Chapter 2 then explores, in depth, the most efficacious form of HIV prevention currently in existence: antiretroviral treatment (ART) for infected persons. ART for an infected partner is 96 % effective at preventing transmission of HIV to an uninfected partner. Due to this startlingly high efficacy and recent increases in coverage, we may be preventing more new cases of HIV annually through ART than through the use of condoms and abstinence combined in Mozambique. The financial implications of a paradigmatic shift to explicitly considering ART as a prevention strategy are discussed, particularly as they relate to PEPFAR's very specific regulations for the allocation of funds. As PEPFAR funding constitutes over 95 % of Mozambique's HIV-specific funding, these regulations and earmarks have created deep path dependence and whittled away at national and local ownership of policy. The third chapter of this thesis then focuses on Mozambique's severe human resources for health constraints and current efforts in health systems strengthening. These strategies include task shifting and human resources scale-up, issues which, while being general to the health system, are also inordinately important for continued ART scale-up. The fourth and final chapter contains the case study in Maputo, Mozambique. This qualitative study attempts to examine the effects of the sexual behavior prevention paradigm on people living with HIV and receiving ART. As these patients are our best hope for halting the HIV epidemic, it will be important for us to view our decades-old prevention messages from their point of view and understand how these messages may also affect their adherence as well as their willingness to be tested initially and to enroll in treatment. The interviews were carried out with patients, guardians of pediatric patients and clinicians at two health facilities in Maputo. Analysis of these interviews supports the hypothesis that traditional prevention messages found in public health campaigns, the media and in health facilities themselves, may be creating and exacerbating stigma that discourages people living with HIV to be tested and treated...|$|E
