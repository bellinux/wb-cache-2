5|$|The {{house on}} Hadley Common was a citadel of riotous insolvency—not just at Christmas but every weekend. There {{was a great}} sense of {{in-depth}} back-up, a cellar, a barrel of malt whisky, a walk-in larder: proof against snowstorm or shutdown. I think it was that Christmas morning , that all four Amises, with breakfast trays on their laps, watched Journey to the Centre of the Earth—then the visit to the pub, then the day-long, the week-long lunch. And with Kingsley the hub of all humour and high spirits, like an engine of comedy... I felt so secure in that house—and, clearly, so insecure elsewhere—that I always experienced a caress of apprehension as <b>I</b> <b>climbed</b> into the car on Sunday night, any Sunday night, and headed back to the motorway and Monday, to the flat or the flatlet, the street, the job, the tramp dread, the outside world.|$|E

500|$|.....as soon as I got out <b>I</b> <b>climbed</b> on to {{the railing}} and threw myself out to the wire-netting, a {{distance}} of between 20 and 30 feet. The idea in my mind was [...] "one big tragedy may save many others". I realised that my best means of carrying out my purpose was the iron staircase. When a good moment came, quite deliberately I walked upstairs and threw myself from the top, as I meant, {{on to the}} iron staircase. If I had been successful I should undoubtedly have been killed, {{as it was a}} clear drop of 30 to 40 feet. But I caught {{on the edge of the}} netting. I then threw myself forward on my head with all my might.|$|E

500|$|Fossett's {{interest}} in adventure began early. As a Boy Scout, {{he grew up}} climbing the mountains of California, beginning with the San Jacinto Mountains. [...] "When I was 12 years old <b>I</b> <b>climbed</b> my first mountain, and I just kept going, taking on more diverse and grander projects." [...] Fossett {{said that he did}} not have a natural gift for athletics or team sports, so he focused on activities that required persistence and endurance. His father, an Eagle Scout, encouraged Fossett to pursue these types of adventures and encouraged him to become involved with the Boy Scouts early. He became an active member of Troop 170 in Orange, California. At age 13, Fossett earned the Boy Scouts' highest rank of Eagle Scout. He was a Vigil Honor member of the Order of the Arrow, the Boy Scouts' honor society, where he served as lodge chief. He also worked as a Ranger at Philmont Scout Ranch in New Mexico during the summer of 1961. Fossett said in 2006 that Scouting was the most important activity of his youth.|$|E
2500|$|In 1925, he {{completed}} 53 climbs in the Sierra Nevada, and told Francis Farquhar that [...] "I sometimes think <b>I</b> <b>climbed</b> enough peaks {{this summer to}} render me a candidate for a padded cell—at least some people look at the matter in that way. [...] However, I {{get a lot of}} enjoyment from this rather strenuous form of diversion." [...] In 1926, he climbed in Yellowstone National Park, Grand Teton National Park, the Beartooth Mountains and Absaroka Range of Montana, and the Sawtooth Range of Idaho. [...] He made several additional first ascents in California that year.|$|E

"On the {{afternoon}} of October 19, 1899, <b>I</b> <b>climbed</b> a tall cherry tree and, armed with a saw which I still have, and a hatchet, started to trim the dead limbs from the cherry tree. It {{was one of the}} quiet, colorful afternoons of sheer beauty which we have in October in New England, and as I looked towards the fields at the east, I imagined how wonderful it would be to make some device which had even the possibility of ascending to Mars. I was a different boy when I descended the tree from when I ascended for existence at last seemed very purposive." [...] (Written later, in an autobiographical sketch) ...|$|E

The lyrics are taken from [...] "Cord of Life", but are sung in the key of B, making them more upbeat:And you and <b>I</b> <b>climb,</b> crossing {{the shapes of the}} morning.And you and I reach over the sun for the river.And you and <b>I</b> <b>climb,</b> clearer, towards the movement.And you and I called over valleys of endless seas.|$|R

2500|$|In 1936, MacNeish {{started his}} {{university}} career at Colgate College (now Colgate University) {{and participated in}} several archaeological field schools in New York and Arizona where he learned important excavation skills that he would later modify to create his own excavation techniques. [...] Of this time, MacNeish writes: “My energy was boundless: I dug, I hiked, <b>I</b> <b>climbed</b> cliffs, I learned, I went to dances, I mixed cement by hand, I caught rattlesnakes, I packed mules. [...] Most important, I did and talked archaeology morning, noon, and night – and loved every moment of it”. [...] He continued {{to be influenced by}} Dr. Kidder, and refined his field archaeology methods under George Brainerd, eventually forming his personal excavation technique La Perre.|$|E
2500|$|On Friday the Ninth of June in {{the present}} year, Mr. and Mrs. Boffin (in their {{manuscript}} dress of receiving Mr. and Mrs. Lammle at breakfast) were on the South-Eastern Railway with me, in a terribly destructive accident. When I had done what I could to help others, <b>I</b> <b>climbed</b> back into my carriage—nearly turned over a viaduct, and caught aslant upon the turn—to extricate the worthy couple. They were much soiled, but otherwise unhurt. [...] I remember with devout thankfulness that I can never be much nearer parting company with my readers for ever than I was then, until there shall be written against my life, the two words with which I have this day closed this book:—THE END.|$|E
2500|$|... 1225's blueprints, {{saved from}} {{oblivion}} and {{donated to the}} MSURRC by Hank Truer, were the prototype for the locomotive image, and its sounds {{were used in the}} 2004 film The Polar Express. The film was based on the Caldecott Medal winning book of the same name. The children's book was written and illustrated by Chris Van Allsburg, who grew up in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and as a child attended every home football game at Michigan State, next to which this engine was on static display. He recalls playing on this engine many times as a child saying, [...] "I remember that train on campus,...I can't believe it's the same train! <b>I</b> <b>climbed</b> on that train. I actually stood on it." [...] Appropriately enough, the locomotive's road number is the date of Christmas, 12/25.|$|E

2500|$|... …I was {{standing}} upstairs when I heard {{some sort of}} growing noise, then I saw the corrugated turbine cover rise and stand on end. Then I saw the rotor rising from underneath it. It was spinning. I could not believe my eyes. It rose about three meters. Rocks and pieces of metal went flying, we started to dodge them… At that point the corrugated cover was nearly at roof level, and the roof itself had been destroyed… I made a mental calculation: the water is rising, 380 cubic meters per second, so I took to my heels {{and ran for the}} № 10 turbine. I thought that I wouldn't make it, <b>I</b> <b>climbed</b> higher, stopped, looked down, and saw everything getting destroyed, water coming in, people trying to swim… I thought: someone must urgently shut the gates to stop the water, manually… Manually, because there was no power, none of the protection systems had worked… ...|$|E

50|$|Schrofen terrain {{requires}} {{at least}} sure-footedness and {{is typical of}} grade <b>I</b> <b>climbing</b> routes. In wet weather schrofen can become very dangerous because of the increased risk of slipping, particularly in the descent. In addition, the risk of falling in schrofen terrain is often underestimated.|$|R
