40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Intractable {{epilepsy}} is a well-recognized complication follow-ing head trauma, {{and many}} factors have been implicated in its pathogenesis. This study was performed to determine the severity of tissue damage after severe head injury as assessed with magnetization transfer (MT) MR imaging {{and the relationship of}} this damage with seizure intractability. METHODS: Forty-four patients, 13 without seizures (disease controls) and 31 with seizures, underwent T 1 -weighted MT MR imaging 1 – 10 years after head trauma. Phase-corrected gradient-echo (GRE) imaging was also performed in all patients to look for the presence of hemosiderin. All patients were evaluated for the presence of an MT abnormality beyond an abnormality seen on T 2 -weighted images, an MT abnormality within a T 2 abnormality, and hemosiderin deposition. RESULTS: Patients with an MT abnormality beyond a T 2 abnormality had a significantly higher intractability of seizures compared with those with an MT abnormality within a T 2 abnormality (P <. 05). In addition, the mere presence of <b>hemosiderin</b> <b>deposit</b> was not associated with seizure intractability; however, gliosis around the hemosiderin as seen on T 1 -weighted MT images was associated with seizure intractability...|$|R
50|$|The brain {{swelling}} {{is likely}} {{a result of}} vasogenic edema, the penetration of the blood-brain barrier by fluids. This process has been observed in MRI studies. Hypoxia increases extracellular fluid, which passes through the vasogenic endothelium in the brain. The leaking {{may be caused by}} increased pressure, or it may be caused by inflammation that makes the endothelium vulnerable to leaking. An MRI study found microhemorrhages in the corpus callosum of HACE patients, and hypoxia may also cause microvascular permeability. It has been hypothesized that vascular endothelial growth factor may cause the vascular permeability at the root of HACE. MRI scans of patients with HACE showed increased T2 in the corpus callosum, although grey matter was unchanged. This demonstrated that the blood-brain barrier was broken by cerebral blood vessels, thus interfering with white matter metabolism. Another study looked at the brains of HACE sufferers several months after their recovery; it showed <b>hemosiderin</b> <b>deposits</b> in the corpus callosum, evidence of vascular permeability.|$|E
40|$|We {{compared}} {{the frequencies of}} signs of old intracerebral hemorrhages on brain magnetic resonance imaging scans in 66 patients with ischemic stroke, 69 with myocardial infarction, and 86 with peripheral arterial disease (a total of 221 patients). Magnetic resonance imaging scans were independently assessed by two investigators without knowledge of clinical or laboratory data. In 31 patients (14 %) we found local cerebral <b>hemosiderin</b> <b>deposits.</b> In 24 patients they were clinically silent. <b>Hemosiderin</b> <b>deposits</b> were significantly more frequent in patients with ischemic stroke (26 %) than in patients with myocardial infarction (4 %) or peripheral arterial disease (13 %). <b>Hemosiderin</b> <b>deposits</b> were associated with cerebral white matter lesions (odds ratio, 5. 3; 95 % confidence interval, 2. 5 - 12. 4). The odds ratios were higher in patients with severe cerebral white matter lesions. Our findings {{support the hypothesis that}} cerebral vessels of patients with ischemic stroke are more prone to rupture than those of patients with other manifestations of atherosclerotic disease, which may explain the higher incidence of intracerebral hemorrhages when these patients are treated with oral anticoagulants.

40|$|AbstractPurposeLow-grade neuroepithelial {{tumors are}} {{frequent}} neuropathological findings {{in patients with}} pharmacoresistant epilepsies. Little is known regarding epileptogenic mechanisms in this group of neoplasms with gangliogliomas (GG) as the most common entity. Presence of <b>hemosiderin</b> <b>deposits</b> in GG points to impairment of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Therefore, we hypothesized a potential role of BBB dysfunction and astrocytic albumin uptake as potential epileptogenic factor in GG. MethodsPrussian blue staining and fluorescent double-immunohistochemistry with antibodies against albumin, GFAP, CD 34 and GLUT- 1 were used to analyze <b>hemosiderin</b> <b>deposits</b> and astroglial albumin accumulation in tumor and adjacent pre-existing brain tissue of GG (n= 10) and several control groups, i. e. dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors (DNT; n= 5), focal cortical dysplasia with balloon cells (FCD IIb; n= 10), astrocytomas WHO grade II (n= 5) and clear renal cell carcinoma brain metastases (RCCM, n= 6). ResultsOur results revealed strong <b>hemosiderin</b> <b>deposits</b> in GG. Intriguingly, we noted substantial albumin uptake exclusively in neoplastic glial cell components of GG and DNT, whereas no significant albumin was present in perilesional reactive astrocytes. Strikingly, {{we did not observe}} substantial albumin uptake in further controls. ConclusionGlial albumin uptake was restricted to long-term epilepsy associated, vasculature-containing tumors. Intratumoural BBB dysfunction in concert with subsequent accumulation of albumin by neoplastic glial cell elements represent a new putatively epileptogenic mechanism for long-term epilepsy-associated tumors...|$|E

The carp displayed extensive thinness of the back after feeding for a seven month period and underwent a moribund condition accompanying the thin body after twelve months. Diseased fish histopathologically exhibited myopathy of the systemic skeletal musculature, ceroid and hemosiderin deposition and chronic nephritis which was extensive especially in moribund cases The myopathy was characterized by various kinds of alterations of muscle fibers and in the moribund cases, most of the muscle fibers were lost, accompanying a compensative production of fibrous tissue. Ceroid and <b>hemosiderin</b> were <b>deposited</b> within macrophages accumulating in the altered musculature, the spleen, the renal hematopoietic tissue and around pancreatic acini.

40|$|Low-frequency low-field {{magnetic}} susceptibility measurements {{were made on}} four samples of mammalian tissue iron oxide deposits. The samples comprised: (1) horse spleen ferritin; (2) dugong liver hemosiderin; (3) thalassemic human spleen ferritin; and (4) crude thalassemic human spleen hemosiderin. These samples were chosen because Mössbauer spectroscopic measurements on the samples indicated that they exemplified the variation in magnetic and mineral structure found in mammalian tissue iron oxide deposits. The AC-magnetic susceptometry yielded information on the magnetization kinetics of the four samples indicating samples 1, 2, and 3 to be superparamagnetic with values of around 1011 s− 1 for the pre-exponential frequency factor in the Néel–Arrhenius equation and values for characteristic magnetic anisotropy energy barriers in the range 250 – 400 K. Sample 4 was indicated to be paramagnetic at all temperatures above 1. 3 K. The AC-magnetic susceptometry data also indicated a larger magnetic anisotropy energy distribution in the dugong liver sample compared with samples 1 and 3 in agreement with previous Mössbauer spectroscopic data on these samples. At temperatures below 200 K, samples 1 – 3 exhibited Curie–Weiss law behavior, indicating weak particle–particle interactions tending to favor antiparallel alignment of the particle magnetic moments. These interactions were strongest for the dugong liver hemosiderin, possibly reflecting the smaller separation between mineral particles in this sample. This is the first magnetic susceptometry study of <b>hemosiderin</b> iron <b>deposits</b> and demonstrates that the AC-magnetic susceptometry technique is a fast and informative method of studying such tissue iron oxide deposits...|$|R

BACKGROUND: Unexplained cerebellar ataxia, pyramidal syndrome, and hearing loss are observed {{in some patients}} with TTR-related amyloidoses. METHODS: We performed clinical, radiologic, and pathologic examinations of three family members with TTR-related (Ala 36 Pro) amyloidosis. RESULTS: The patient was a 69 -year-old woman with vitreal amyloid deposits, progressive sensorineural deafness, cerebellar ataxia, pyramidal syndrome, and recurrent transient neurologic symptoms. Cranial MRI showed symmetric thin rims of low signal intensity in T 2 - and T 2 *-weighted images in the cortex of the sylvian fissures, of the cerebellar hemispheres and vermis, and in the quadrigeminal plate consistent with superficial siderosis of the CNS. Her older daughter had vitreal amyloid deposits, acute Brown-Sequard syndrome at C 4, acute sensorineural deafness, and recurrent transient neurologic symptoms. Cranial MRI at age 48 revealed a rim of low signal intensity in T 2 - and T 2 *-weighted images in the superior vermis folia and the right sylvian cortex. In addition, two small <b>hemosiderin</b> <b>deposits</b> were seen in the left parietal cortex. Lumbar puncture yielded colorless CSF with increased ferritin content and was followed by fourth ventricle hemorrhage.
