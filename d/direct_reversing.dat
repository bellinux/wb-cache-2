Previously, {{as with other}} outboard brands and Mercury's smaller models, exhaust exited from a chute {{at the rear of}} the cavitation plate above the propeller. Thru-hub exhaust was claimed to be more efficient by omitting the added drag of an exhaust chute, and using the low pressure area necessarily created by the gear housing and propeller moving through the water to assist in exhaust evacuation. Over the next several years, thru-hub exhaust became a standard feature of all Mercury models, and later was adopted near industry-wide for both outboards and stern-drives.|$|E

5000|$|The first V-type engine (a {{two-cylinder}} V twin) {{was built}} in 1889 by Daimler, to a design by Wilhelm Maybach. By 1903 V8 engines were being produced for motor boat racing by the Société Antoinette to designs by Léon Levavasseur, building on experience gained with in-line four-cylinder engines. In 1904, the Putney Motor Works completed a new V12 marine racing engine—the first V12 engine produced for any purpose. Known as the [...] "Craig-Dörwald" [...] engine after Putney's founding partners, the engine mounted pairs of L-head cylinders at a 90 degree included angle on an aluminium crankcase, using the same cylinder pairs that powered the company's standard two-cylinder car. A single camshaft mounted in the central V operated the valves directly. As in many marine engines, the camshaft could be slid longitudinally to engage {{a second set of}} cams, giving valve timing that reversed the engine's rotation to achieve astern propulsion. [...] "Starting is by pumping a charge into each cylinder and switching on the trembler coils. A sliding camshaft gave <b>direct</b> <b>reversing.</b> The camshaft has fluted webs and main bearings in graduated thickness from the largest at the flywheel end." [...] Displacing 1120 cuin L (bore and stroke of 4.875 x 5 in), the engine weighed 950 lbs kg and developed [...] Little is known of the engine's achievements in the 40-foot hull for which it was intended, while using the engine to power heavy freight vehicles was not realized.

Working with data from U.
