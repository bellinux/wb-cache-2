40|$|Doignon and Falmagne have {{developed}} the concept <b>of</b> the <b>fringe</b> <b>of</b> a knowledge state based upon the neighborhood of knowledge states. This concept is useful for probabilistic assessment of knowledge and for the suggestion of training problems in an intelligent tutoring system. In this paper, a generalized definition <b>of</b> the <b>fringe</b> <b>of</b> knowledge states is introduced. An efficient procedure is presented which computes the <b>fringe</b> <b>of</b> knowledge states using {{the basis of a}} knowledge space. In a simulation study, this procedure is compared with the approach described by Doignon and Falmagne. ...|$|R

5|$|Coal {{measures}} {{occur on}} the western and the eastern <b>fringes</b> <b>of</b> the Peak District, and evidence of past workings can be found from Glossop down to The Roaches, and from Stocksbridge to Baslow. The Coal measures on the eastern <b>fringes</b> <b>of</b> the Peak District form the South Yorkshire Coalfield while the Coal measures on the western fringes form the Lancashire Coalfield. Mining started in medieval times and was at its most productive in the 18th and early 19th centuries, in some cases continuing into the early 20th century. The earliest mining took place at and close to outcrops and miners eventually followed the seams deeper underground as the beds dipped beneath hillsides. At Goyt's Moss and Axe Edge, deep seams were worked and steam engines raised the coal and dewatered the mines. Coal from the eastern mines was used in lead smelting, and coal from the western mines for lime burning.|$|E
5|$|Dhikala is a {{well-known}} destination {{in the park and}} situated at the <b>fringes</b> <b>of</b> Patli Dun valley. There is a rest house, which was built hundred of years ago. Kanda ridge forms the backdrop, and from Dhikala, one can enjoy the spectacular natural beauty of the valley.|$|E
5|$|American Patriots {{reacted to}} {{news of the}} battle with optimism. Especially after Burgoyne's Indian screen left him, small groups of local Patriots began to emerge to harass the <b>fringes</b> <b>of</b> British positions.

5|$|Extremely Severe Cyclonic Storm Nilofar was, at the time, the third-strongest cyclone in the Arabian Sea. In late October 2014, {{it reached}} peak maximum {{sustained}} winds estimated between 205km/h (125mph) and 215km/h (130mph). The India Meteorological Department (IMD) named it Nilofar; the name {{refers to the}} water lily, and was suggested by Pakistan. The western <b>fringes</b> <b>of</b> the storm caused flash flooding in northeastern Oman, killing four people.|$|E
5|$|Foxes can {{be found}} only at the <b>fringes</b> <b>of</b> jackal territory. Red foxes and golden jackals share similar diets, with the jackal being three times bigger than the red fox. The red fox will avoid close {{proximity}} with jackals, and fox populations decrease where jackals are abundant. Striped hyenas prey on golden jackals, and three jackal carcasses were found in one hyena den.|$|E
5|$|In 1803, Young's {{interference}} experiment {{played a}} major role in the general acceptance of the wave theory of light. If white light is used in Young's experiment, the result is a white central band of constructive interference corresponding to equal path length from the two slits, surrounded by a symmetrical pattern of colored <b>fringes</b> <b>of</b> diminishing intensity. In addition to continuous electromagnetic radiation, Young's experiment has been performed with individual photons, with electrons, and with buckyball molecules large enough to be seen under an electron microscope.|$|E

5|$|Off {{the coast}} of Los Cabos in Baja California Sur, large swells capsized a fishing boat with seven people aboard on August25. Four were able to swim back to shore while the other three {{remained}} missing and were later presumed dead. Strong rain bands along the outer <b>fringes</b> <b>of</b> Hurricane Marie brought heavy rain to parts of the state. Landslides blocked several roads near Los Cabos while gusty winds downed trees and power lines. Owing to the dangerous conditions, all schools Los Cabos were closed on August25.|$|E

After passing Headline Road (County Road44), the route divides a forest and then enters an agricultural area before coming upon the community of St. Andrews West. It crosses the Raisin River and continues north through a mix of farmland and forests.|$|E
5|$|Situated on {{the western}} <b>fringes</b> <b>of</b> the Pacific Ring of Fire, the Philippines {{experiences}} frequent seismic and volcanic activity.

The last major earthquake was the 1990 Luzon earthquake.|$|E

5|$|The 2004 Indian Ocean {{earthquake}} was an undersea, megathrust {{earthquake that}} occurred on 26 December 2004, with an epicentre off {{the west coast}} of Sumatra, Indonesia, triggering a series of devastating tsunamis along coastal <b>fringes</b> <b>of</b> the Indian Ocean. Nagapattinam district was the most affected part of Tamil Nadu, accounting for 6,064 off the 8,009 casualties in the state. Sirkazhi remained mostly unaffected by the tsunami, but the groundwater quality deteriorated where aquifers were close to the water bodies. There was heavy salt water intrusion inland.|$|E
5|$|A {{new plan}} was {{put forward by}} West Sussex County Council in 1961. This {{proposed}} new neighbourhoods at Broadfield and Bewbush, both of which extended outside the administrative area of the then Urban District Council. Detailed plans were made for Broadfield in the late 1960s; by the early 1970s building work had begun. Further expansion at Bewbush was begun in 1974, although development there was slow. The two neighbourhoods were both larger than the original nine: together, their proposed population was 23,000. Work also {{took place in the}} area now known as Ifield West on the western <b>fringes</b> <b>of</b> the town.|$|E
