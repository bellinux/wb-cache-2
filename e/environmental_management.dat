The two documents build on the Australian <b>environmental</b> water <b>management</b> report 2010 to form a suite of resources. The Australian environmental water management: 2012 review (PDF 3. 6 MB) describes progress in <b>environmental</b> water <b>management</b> for each jurisdiction. It sets out an overview of <b>environmental</b> water <b>management</b> practices, the legislative framework and policies and responsible agencies for each of the framework criteria. A brief summary of the review and a roadmap for improvement are included. The Australian environmental water management: framework criteria (PDF 3. 7 MB) presents the framework which is made up of five elements and 27 criteria that characterise successful <b>environmental</b> water <b>management</b> practice.

Executive summary The Australian <b>environmental</b> water <b>management</b> review 2014 (this report) {{is the third}} {{in a series of}} reports prepared by the National Water Commission (the Commission) aimed at promoting improved practice in the <b>management</b> of <b>environmental</b> water in Australia. This report is an assessment of ongoing {{performance in}} achieving the integrated <b>environmental</b> water <b>management</b> outcomes of the National Water Initiative (NWI). The first report in this series, the Australian <b>environmental</b> water <b>management</b> report 2010, provided a consolidated directory of <b>environmental</b> water <b>management</b> arrangements in each jurisdiction. Building on this baseline report, the Australian environmental water management: review 2012 assessed the adequacy of <b>environmental</b> water <b>management</b> practices in each jurisdiction under the elements of planning, implementation, monitoring and reporting, evaluation and improvement, and governance. This report reviews progress made in each jurisdiction since the 2012 report – under the same five elements – using a desktop analysis of publicly available information to January 2014. It also includes case studies that provide examples of good practice, such as establishing targeted monitoring programs and improving confidence in the ecological objectives of environmental water provisions (commonly identified as needing further improvement) ...|$|R

5|$|Conventional {{real estate}} {{development}} and urban planning activities are subject to conflicting interests and positional bargaining. The integrative negotiation approach emphasises mutual gains. The approach has been applied in land use planning and <b>environmental</b> <b>management,</b> but has not {{been used as a}} coordinated approach to {{real estate development}}, city design, and urban planning. Urban design management involves reordering the chain of events in the production of the built environment according to the principles of integrative negotiation. Such negotiation can be used in urban development and planning activities to reach more efficient agreements. This leads to integrative developments and more sustainable ways to produce the built environment.|$|E

The paper was aim at ascertaining the extent to which implantation of environment cost management has impacted on the oil and gas industries in Nigeria. Using multiple regression analytical technique, " data from the central bank of Nigeria (CBN) and Environmental Impact Assessment Agency were obtained. Findings revealed that there exist a significant relationship between the parameters that influence <b>environmental</b> cost <b>management</b> and output of oil and gas produced in Nigeria. Also, it was discovered that there are no established standards in Nigeria guiding <b>environmental</b> cost <b>management</b> in the oil and gas industries in Nigeria. Again there is a lacuna in external reporting of environmental cost data in Nigeria. It was concluded that the extent of <b>environmental</b> cost <b>management</b> in the oil and gas industries is at its rudimentary stage.

5|$|Waste {{management}} including sewage treatment, the linked {{processes of}} deforestation and soil degradation, {{and climate change}} or global warming are the major environmental problems in Nigeria. Waste management presents problems in a mega city like Lagos and other major Nigerian cities which are linked with economic development, population growth and the inability of municipal councils to manage the resulting rise in industrial and domestic waste. This huge waste management problem is also attributable to unsustainable <b>environmental</b> <b>management</b> lifestyles of Kubwa Community in the Federal Capital Territory, where there are habits of indiscriminate disposal of waste, dumping of waste along or into the canals, sewerage systems that are channels for water flows, etc.|$|E
5|$|Although {{from the}} outset of the oil boom there were efforts at {{conservation}} and protection of the environment, they generally enjoyed little success. Because of the ease of finding oil in the early decades, wells were often not fully developed before prospectors began looking for more productive wells. The wildcatters not only wasted the valuable resource, but created avoidable environmental contamination with the numerous oil strikes. The rush to extract oil frequently led to the construction of poor storage facilities where leaks were common and water pollution became a serious issue. After heavy logging during the 19th century, the clearing of fields for oil exploration and the demand for lumber to be used in new construction destroyed most of the remaining forest lands in the state. Later <b>environmental</b> <b>management</b> efforts helped restore some of the forest lands but they remain a shadow of what they were before statehood.|$|E
