40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} manufacturing exports and <b>imports</b> <b>of</b> capital goods in Thailand using monthly data from January 2000 to July 2011. The results from bounds testing for cointegration show that there exists long-run equilibrium relationship between exports and <b>imports</b> <b>of</b> capital goods in manufacturing sector. In addition, the positive relationship between the growth rate <b>of</b> <b>imports</b> <b>of</b> capital goods and {{the growth rate of}} manufacturing exports is observed. The results support the notion that foreign capital is essential in the process of industrialization, and thus economic growth. A decline in <b>imports</b> <b>of</b> capital goods will reduce manufacturing exports and impedes economic growth in the future. It is also likely that exports of manufactured products are the main source of foreign exchanges to finance <b>imports</b> <b>of</b> capital goods which cannot be produced in the country due to comparative disadvantage. ...|$|R
40|$|Aminoacyl tRNA synthetases play {{a central}} role in protein {{synthesis}} by charging tRNAs with amino acids. Yeast mitochondrial lysyl tRNA synthetase (Msk 1), in addition to the aminoacylation of mitochondrial tRNA, also functions as a chaperone to facilitate the <b>import</b> <b>of</b> cytosolic lysyl tRNA. In this report, we show that human mitochondrial Kars (lysyl tRNA synthetase) can complement the growth defect associated with the loss of yeast Msk 1 and can additionally facilitate the in vitro <b>import</b> <b>of</b> tRNA into mitochondria. Surprisingly, the <b>import</b> <b>of</b> lysyl tRNA can occur independent of Msk 1 in vivo.

This differentiation of varieties according to their quality enables to provide new evidence regarding the collapse of world trade during the recent crisis.

For <b>import</b> <b>of</b> short ssDNA, VirD 2 was sufficient, whereas <b>import</b> <b>of</b> long ssDNA additionally required VirE 2. A VirD 2 mutant lacking its C-terminal NLS was unable to mediate <b>import</b> <b>of</b> the T-DNA complexes into nuclei. Although free VirE 2 molecules were imported into nuclei, once bound to ssDNA they were not imported, implying that when complexed to DNA, the NLSs of VirE 2 are not exposed and thus do not function. RecA, another ssDNA binding protein, could substitute for VirE 2 in the nuclear <b>import</b> <b>of</b> T-DNA but not in earlier events of T-DNA transfer to plant cells. We propose that VirD 2 directs the T-DNA complex to the nuclear pore, whereas both proteins mediate its passage through the pore. Therefore, by binding to ssDNA, VirE 2 may shape the T-DNA complex such that it is accepted for translocation into the nucleus...|$|R
