25|$|Scott Styris conceded 56 {{runs with}} the ball for Middlesex Crusaders in this National League game, but his four wickets near the <b>end</b> <b>cut</b> short Glamorgan's chase to bring Middlesex to victory. The Crusaders had been {{inserted}} by Glamorgan Dragons captain Robert Croft, against a Dragons side whose National League season had seen their best performances, as both Championship, Twenty20 and C had seen them finish below ninth. After Ed Smith departed for 6, fifties from Paul Weekes and Owais Shah sent Middlesex to 133 for 1. Dean Cosker took two quick wickets, but 37 off 27 balls from left-hander Ed Joyce helped Middlesex {{to a total of}} 239 for 5. Peter Trego then removed both openers, before Alex Wharf took him for runs (ending with 40 off 20 balls), and Trego ended with one maiden over, two wickets, and 31 runs off three overs. Wharf was eventually caught by Smith, but David Hemp, Dan Cherry and Richard Grant all added more than 30 in stands with Mike Powell, and at 219 for 5, Glamorgan needed 21 for the last five wickets. Styris had the last laugh, however, taking three wickets in the late overs and bowling Glamorgan out with eight balls remaining in their quota to leave Powell stranded on 83 not out.|$|E
60|$|I {{determined}} to endow my darling boy Bryan with a property, {{and to this}} <b>end</b> <b>cut</b> down twelve thousand pounds' worth of timber on Lady Lyndon's Yorkshire and Irish estates: at which proceeding Bullingdon's guardian, Tiptoff, cried out, as usual, and swore I {{had no right to}} touch a stick of the trees; but down they went; and I commissioned my mother to repurchase the ancient lands of Ballybarry and Barryogue, which had once formed part of the immense possessions of my house. These she bought back with excellent prudence and extreme joy; for her heart was gladdened at the idea that a son was born to my name, and with the notion of my magnificent fortunes.|$|E

60|$|In {{the room}} from which this cheerful blaze proceeded, he beheld a girl seated on a willow chair, and busily {{occupied}} {{by the light of}} the fire, which was ample and of wood. With a bill-hook in one hand and a leather glove, much too large for her, on the other, she was making spars, such as are used by thatchers, with great rapidity. She wore a leather apron for this purpose, which was also much too large for her figure. On her left hand lay a bundle of the straight, smooth sticks called spar-gads--the raw material of her manufacture; on her right, a heap of chips and ends--the refuse--with which the fire was maintained; in front, a pile of the finished articles. To produce them she took up each gad, looked critically at it from end to <b>end,</b> <b>cut</b> it to length, split it into four, and sharpened each of the quarters with dexterous blows, which brought it to a triangular point precisely resembling that of a bayonet.|$|E
6000|$|... 'What prizes {{the town}} and the tower? Only what the pine-tree yields; Sinew that subdued the fields; The wild-eyed boy, who in the woods Chants his hymn to hills and floods, Whom the city's {{poisoning}} spleen Made not pale, or fat, or lean; Whom the rain and the wind purgeth, Whom the dawn and the day-star urgeth, In whose cheek the rose-leaf blusheth, In whose feet the lion rusheth, Iron arms, and iron mould, That know not fear, fatigue, or cold. I give my rafters to his boat, My billets to his boiler's throat, And I will swim the ancient sea To float my child to victory, And grant to dwellers with the pine Dominion o'er the palm and vine. Who leaves the pine-tree, leaves his friend, Unnerves his strength, invites his <b>end.</b> <b>Cut</b> a bough from my parent stem, And dip it in thy porcelain vase; A little while each russet gem Will swell and rise with wonted grace; But when it seeks enlarged supplies, The orphan of the forest dies. Whoso walks in solitude And inhabiteth the wood, Choosing light, wave, rock and bird, Before the money-loving herd, Into that forester shall pass, From these companions, power and grace. Clean shall he be, without, within, From the old adhering sin, All ill dissolving in the light Of his triumphant piercing sight: Not vain, sour, nor frivolous; Not mad, athirst, nor garrulous; Grave, chaste, contented, though retired, And of all other men desired. On him the light of star and moon Shall fall with purer radiance down; All constellations of the sky Shed their virtue through his eye. Him Nature giveth for defence His formidable innocence; The mounting sap, the shells, the sea, All spheres, all stones, his helpers be; He shall meet the speeding year, Without wailing, without fear; He shall be happy in his love, Like to like shall joyful prove; He shall be happy whilst he wooes, Muse-born, a daughter of the Muse. But if with gold she bind her hair, And deck her breast with diamond, Take off thine eyes, thy heart forbear, Though thou lie alone on the ground.|$|E

Generally the deeper the water the more complicated thesampling process becomes. For sampling the meiofauna on hard substrates, phytal and epizooic environments, the only practical methodology is to cut or scrape off a known area of substrate and place it in a plastic bag.|$|E
