25|$|Adoption of the nixtamalization process did not {{accompany}} the grain to Europe and beyond, {{perhaps because the}} Europeans already had more efficient milling processes for <b>hulling</b> grain mechanically. Without alkaline processing, maize is a much less beneficial foodstuff, and malnutrition struck many areas where it became a dominant food crop. In the nineteenth century, pellagra epidemics were recorded in France, Italy, and Egypt, and kwashiorkor hit parts of Africa where maize had become a dietary staple.|$|E
25|$|After cooking, the {{alkaline}} liquid (known as nejayote), containing dissolved hull, starch, {{and other}} corn matter, is decanted and discarded (or sometimes used for making amate bark paper). The kernels are washed thoroughly of remaining nejayote, {{which has an}} unpleasant flavor. The pericarp is then removed, leaving the endosperm of the grain {{with or without the}} germ, depending on the process. This <b>hulling</b> is performed by hand, in traditional or very small-scale preparation, or mechanically, in larger scale or industrial production.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} {{process for}} use in industrial settings has been developed known as enzymatic nixtamalization which uses protease enzymes to accelerate the changes that occur in traditional nixtamalization. In this process, corn or corn meal is first partially hydrated in hot water, so that enzymes can penetrate the grain, then soaked briefly (for approximately 30 minutes) at 50°–60°C in an alkaline solution containing protease enzymes. A secondary enzymatic digestion may follow to further dissolve the pericarp. The resulting nixtamal is ground {{with little or no}} washing or <b>hulling.</b>|$|E
40|$|Bounding <b>hull,</b> such as convex <b>hull,</b> concave <b>hull,</b> alpha shapes etc. has vast {{applications}} {{in different areas}} especially in computational geometry. Alpha shape and concave <b>hull</b> are generalizations of convex <b>hull.</b> Unlike the convex <b>hull,</b> they construct non-convex enclosure {{on a set of}} points. In this paper, we introduce another generalization of convex <b>hull,</b> named alpha-concave <b>hull,</b> and compare this concept with convex <b>hull</b> and alpha shape. We show that the alpha-concave <b>hull</b> is also a generalization of an NP-complete problem named min-area TSP. We prove that computing the alpha-concave <b>hull</b> is NP-hard on a set of points...|$|R
50|$|The double <b>hull</b> of a {{submarine}} {{is different from}} a ship's double <b>hull.</b> The external <b>hull,</b> which actually forms the shape of submarine, is called the outer <b>hull,</b> casing or light <b>hull.</b> This term is especially appropriate for Russian submarine construction, where the light <b>hull</b> is usually made of steel that is only 2 to 4 millimetres thick, as {{it has the same}} pressure on both sides. The light <b>hull</b> can be used to mount equipment, which if attached directly to the pressure <b>hull</b> could cause unnecessary stress. The double <b>hull</b> approach also saves space inside the pressure <b>hull,</b> as the ring stiffeners and longitudinals can be located between the <b>hulls.</b> These measures help minimise the size of the pressure <b>hull,</b> which is much heavier than the light <b>hull.</b> Also, in case the submarine is damaged, the light <b>hull</b> takes some of the damage and does not compromise the vessel's integrity, as long as the pressure <b>hull</b> is intact.|$|R
30|$|When {{computing}} the convex <b>hull</b> in S. G. Akl’s algorithm, {{the upper}} <b>hull</b> {{and the lower}} <b>hull</b> are separated calculated by finding the unique edges; and then the desired final convex <b>hull</b> is the merging of the upper <b>hull</b> and the lower <b>hull.</b>|$|R
25|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, Egypt under Muhammad Ali began {{a program of}} state-sponsored industrialization, quick to adopt steam engine technology, and {{manufacturing}} boilers for installation {{in a number of}} industries, including ironworks, textile manufacturing, paper mills, and <b>hulling</b> mills. While {{there was a lack of}} coal deposits in Egypt, Muhammad Ali Pasha's prospectors searched for coal deposits in Egypt while importing coal from overseas at similar prices to what imported coal cost in France, until the 1830s when Egypt gained access to coal sources in Lebanon with its yearly coal output of 4,000 tons. Economic historian Jean Batou argues that Egypt had the necessary economic conditions for rapid industrialization in the early 19th century, and for the adoption of oil as a potential energy source for its steam engines later in the 19th century.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} a Middle-Eastern country that had an {{advanced}} economy in the early 19th century was Ottoman Egypt, which had a highly productive industrial manufacturing sector, and per-capita income that was comparable to leading Western European countries such as France and {{higher than that of}} Japan and Eastern Europe. Other parts of the Ottoman Empire, particularly Syria and southeastern Anatolia, also had a highly productive manufacturing sector that was evolving in the 19th century. In 1819, Egypt under Muhammad Ali began programs of state-sponsored industrialization, which included setting up factories for weapons production, an iron foundry, large-scale cotton cultivation, mills for ginning, spinning and weaving of cotton, and enterprises for agricultural processing. By the early 1830s, Egypt had 30 cotton mills, employing about 30,000 workers. In the early 19th century, Egypt had the world's fifth most productive cotton industry, {{in terms of the number}} of spindles per capita. The industry was initially driven by machinery that relied on traditional energy sources, such as animal power, water wheels, and windmills, which were also the principle energy sources in Western Europe up until around 1870. While steam power had been experimented with in Ottoman Egypt by engineer Taqi ad-Din Muhammad ibn Ma'ruf in 1551, when he invented a steam jack driven by a rudimentary steam turbine, it was under Muhammad Ali of Egypt in the early 19th century that steam engines were introduced to Egyptian industrial manufacturing. Boilers were manufactured and installed in Egyptian industries such as ironworks, textile manufacturing, paper mills, and <b>hulling</b> mills. Compared to Western Europe, Egypt also had superior agriculture and an efficient transport network through the Nile. Economic historian Jean Batou argues that the necessary economic conditions for rapid industrialization existed in Egypt during the 1820s–1830s.|$|E

50|$|Modern {{submarines}} and submersibles, {{as well as}} {{the oldest}} ones, usually have a single <b>hull.</b> Large submarines generally have an additional <b>hull</b> or <b>hull</b> sections outside.

60|$|The strange {{ship had}} run aground within {{half a mile}} of {{the spot where the}} twelve-pounder was planted, and that gun now opened on her with great effect.

A forge happened to be in the Anne, to make some repairs to her iron work, and this forge, a small one it was true, was taken ashore, and an attempt was made to heat some shot in it. The shot had been put into the forge an hour or two before, but a fair trial was not made until the whole apparatus was landed. For the next hour the efforts of both sides were unremitted. One of the brigs went to the assistance of the admiral, while the other endeavoured to silence the gun, which was too securely placed, however, to mind her broadsides. One shot <b>hulling</b> her, soon drove her to leeward; after which, all the attention of the pirates was bestowed on their ship.|$|E

60|$|Finding it {{was likely}} to overblow, we took in our sprit-sail, and stood by to hand the fore-sail; but making foul weather, we looked the guns were all fast, and handed the mizen. The ship lay very broad off, so we thought it better {{spooning}} before the sea, than trying or <b>hulling.</b> We reefed the fore-sail and set him, and hauled aft the fore-sheet; the helm was hard a-weather. The ship wore bravely. We belayed the fore down-haul; but the sail was split, and we hauled down the yard, and got the sail into the ship, and unbound all the things clear of it. It was a very fierce storm; the sea broke strange and dangerous. We hauled off upon the laniard of the whip-staff, and helped {{the man at the}} helm. We would not get down our topmast, but let all stand, because she scudded before the sea very well, and we knew that the top-mast being aloft, the ship was the wholesomer, and made better way through the sea, seeing we had sea-room. When the storm was over, we set fore-sail and main-sail, and brought the ship to. Then we set the mizen, main-top-sail, and the fore-top-sail.
