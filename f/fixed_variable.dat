40|$|A highly {{desirable}} characteristic of methods for solving 0 - 1 mixed-integer programs {{is that they}} should be capable of producing high-quality solutions quickly. We introduce restrict-and-relax search, a branch-and-bound algorithm that explores the solution space not only by <b>fixing</b> <b>variables</b> (restricting), but also by freeing, or unfixing, previously <b>fixed</b> <b>variables</b> (relaxing). Starting from a restricted 0 - 1 mixed-integer program, the branch-and-bound algorithm may, at any node of the search tree, selectively relax, or unfix, previously <b>fixed</b> <b>variables,</b> restrict, or <b>fix,</b> additional <b>variables,</b> or unfix and <b>fix</b> <b>variables</b> at the same time using dual or structural information (problem-specific information). This process yields a dynamic search that is likely to find high-quality feasible solutions more quickly than a traditional search and that is also capable of proving optimality. A proof-of-concept computational study demonstrates its potential. A straightforward generic implementation in SYMPHONY, an open source solver for mixed-integer programs, is shown to generate high-quality solutions for many MIPLIB instances as well as for large-scale multicommodity fixed-charge network flow instances much more quickly than SYMPHONY itself...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn a {{previous}} work {{we proposed a}} <b>variable</b> <b>fixing</b> heuristics for the 0 - 1 Multidimensional knapsack problem (01 MDK). This approach uses fractional optima calculated in hyperplanes which contain the binary optimum. This algorithm obtained best lower bounds on the OR-Library benchmarks. Although it is very attractive in terms of results, this method does not prove the optimality of the solutions found and may <b>fix</b> <b>variables</b> to a non-optimal value. In this paper, we propose an implicit enumeration based on a reduced costs analysis which tends to <b>fix</b> non-basic <b>variables</b> to their exact values. The combination of two specific constraint propagations based on reduced costs and an efficient enumeration framework enable us to <b>fix</b> <b>variables</b> {{on the one hand}} and to prune significantly the search tree on the other hand. Experimentally, our work provides two main contributions: (1) we obtain several new optimal solutions on hard instances of the OR-Library and (2) we reduce the bounds of the number of items at the optimum on several harder instances...|$|R

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Order 636 directly changed the economics of gas storage nationwide. Pipelines have been required to {open_quotes}unbundle{close_quotes} their various services so that pipeline users can select only what they need from among the transportation, storage, balancing and the other traditional pipeline services. At the same time, the shift from Modified <b>Fixed</b> <b>Variable</b> (MFV) rate design to Straight <b>Fixed</b> <b>Variable</b> (SFV) rate design has increased the costs of pipeline capacity relative to underground storage and other supply options. Finally, the ability of parties that have contracted for pipeline and storage services to resell their surplus capacities created by Order 636 gives potential gas users more flexibility in assembling combinations of gas delivery services to create reliable gas deliverability. In response to Order 636, the last two years have seen an explosion in proposals for gas storage projects. This paper describes the market for natural gas storage...|$|E
40|$|The {{process of}} {{eliciting}} a representative probability distribution from a judge {{is fundamental to}} decision making under uncertainty. This work summarizes several aspects of eliciting continuous probability distributions. Through experimentation involving 103 judges the method of assessing single variable distributions by <b>fixed</b> <b>variable</b> or fixed probability method is compared. Slight, but consistent, superiority is shown by the <b>fixed</b> <b>variable</b> method. The use of iso-probability contours, a novel methodology for assessing joint probability distributions, is tested through experimentation. The ability of this method to assess a judges belief about the correlation of two variables is characterized. Further recommendations {{for the use of}} iso-probability contours are provided. The variable weighting function is introduced. This novel tool is designed to represent a subjects true belief about a continuous probability distribution as explained by cumulative prospect theory. Operating similarly to the probability weighting function, the variable weighting function allows an assessor to gain a judges belief about a specific variable value without requiring multiple assessments. Functional form of the variable weighting function is explored and relevant parameter values are provided...|$|E

30|$|Parameters in the {{traditional}} NPV model {{are assumed to be}} <b>fixed</b> <b>variables.</b> Therefore, the assumptions in {{the traditional}} NPV model are rigid, and they cannot reflect the uncertain factors embedded in the projects. However, parameters in the probabilistic models are divided into <b>fixed</b> <b>variables</b> and stochastic variables, and the Monte Carlo Simulation method is applied to simulate the stochastic parameters. The impacts of stochastic variables on the values of international OG projects are studied, therefore the probabilistic model can overcome the inherent defects of the traditional NPV model. The Monte Carlo Simulation method can comprehensively measure and analyze the stochastic characters of risk factors of international OG projects, therefore it is proper to apply the Monte Carlo Simulation method to measure the impacts of uncertain factors (Falconett and Nagasaka 2010; Montes et al. 2011; Welkenhuysen et al. 2017).|$|R
