5|$|Of {{the entire}} {{volcanic}} field, the southern portion {{has the most}} known volcanoes. <b>Here,</b> <b>at</b> least 11of them are situated {{on top of a}} long narrow mountain ridge and in adjacent river valleys. The central portion contains at least five volcanoes situated at the Powder Mountain Icefield. To the north, two volcanoes form a sparse area of volcanism. Many of these volcanoes were formed between 0.01and 1.6million years ago, some of which show evidence of volcanic activity in the last 10,000years.|$|E

They also located the tomb of Ramesses the Great, but it was badly looted. It was here that Champollion first received news of Young's campaign to vindicate himself as the decipherer of the hieroglyphs and to discredit Champollion's decipherments. He received this news {{only a few days}} after Young's death in London.|$|E

5|$|The West Sacramento Freeway {{begins on}} Interstate 80 at exit 81 (West Capitol Avenue), {{the east end}} of the Yolo Causeway. It soon splits, with I-80 exiting to bypass Sacramento to the north and Interstate 80 Business (legislatively U.S. Route 50) {{continuing}} east via exit 82 towards downtown. After one interchange, at Harbor Boulevard (exit 1/1B), the freeway splits again, with Bus. 80 turning abruptly southeast over the Pioneer Memorial Bridge to avoid downtown Sacramento. State Route 275 begins <b>here,</b> <b>at</b> exit 3 of Bus. 80, with full access to and from the intersecting Jefferson Boulevard (State Route 84).|$|E

5|$|This wall is {{visited by}} all our {{brothers}} on every feast and festival; {{and the large}} space at its foot is often so densely filled up, that all cannot perform their devotions <b>here</b> <b>at</b> the same time.

No one is molested in these visits by the Mahomedans, as {{we have a very}} old firman from the Sultan of Constantinople that the approach shall not be denied to us, though the Porte obtains for this privilege a special tax, which is, however, quite insignificant.|$|E
5|$|In 1153 the Jin emperor Wanyan Liang {{moved the}} empire's capital from Huining Prefecture in {{northern}} Manchuria (south of present-day Harbin) to Zhongdu (now Beijing). Four {{years later in}} 1157 he razed Beijing, including the nobles’ residences, and moved the Jin's southern capital from Beijing to Kaifeng. It was <b>here</b> <b>at</b> the former seat of the Song dynasty that he began a large project of reconstruction (since the siege against it in 1127). For much of his reign there was peace between Jin and Song, while both states upheld an uninterrupted flow of commercial trade between each other. While amassing tribute from the Southern Song, the Jin dynasty also imported large amounts of tea, rice, sugar, and books from the Southern Song. However, Wanyan Liang reopened the Jin dynasty's armed conflict with the Song by the 1160s.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, Lancastrian {{forces were}} {{regrouping}} in Yorkshire and raiding York's and Salisbury's estates and tenants. Thomas Neville accompanied {{them when they}} marched out of London on 2 December 1460 to restore a semblance of order to the region; they arrived at York's Sandal Castle on 21 of the month. It is possible that a Christmas Truce was arranged; in any case, nine days later, York, his son Edmund, Earl of Rutland, Salisbury, Thomas, {{and many of their}} closest retainers led a sortie in strength to attack a Lancastrian army gathered near the castle. <b>Here,</b> <b>at</b> the Battle of Wakefield, they went down to a crushing defeat, and Thomas died in combat, his father was subsequently executed, and their heads were displayed above the gates of York.|$|E

5|$|Knights Hill {{starts in}} the north at West Norwood in the Norwood Triangle one-way system, and runs through a council ward also named as Knight's Hill. It ends in the south at a {{junction}} with the A214 at Crown Lane and Crown Dale. Knights Hill becomes Beulah Hill <b>here</b> <b>at</b> Crown Point. To the north, south of Knight's Hill {{is the part of}} the Crystal Palace area with no name home to a large parade of competing large super markets along the A215 Norwood Road including Tesco, Cooperative, Iceland and (by Summer 2009) Sainsbury (ex Woolworth's site). West Norwood railway station is on this road. Knights Hill contains the Knights Hill Nature Reserve, one of the last remaining vestiges of the Great North Wood which once covered the area.|$|E
5|$|Once {{atop the}} hill, it {{continues}} due northwest to its next junction, the underdeveloped crossing of US20. <b>Here</b> <b>at</b> least some Buffalo-bound traffic will turn west. Eventually acquiring the name Ellicott Street, NY63 crosses sparsely populated {{parts of the}} towns of Bethany and Batavia {{on its way to}} the city of Batavia. The route passes under the Depew, Lancaster and Western Railroad and the CSX Transportation-owned Rochester Subdivision rail line on its way into downtown, where it intersects the two major eastwest trunk routes in this corridor, NY5 and NY33. It overlaps with both roads for several blocks along Main Street, with NY33 splitting off at Oak Street. This junction is also where NY63 meets the north–south NY98, which connects to the Thruway just north of the city.|$|E
5|$|The Kansas Turnpike then leaves Lawrence {{and bends}} to the {{northeast}} before leaving Douglas County and entering Leavenworth. It overpasses Mud Creek before passing under K-32. Northeast of <b>here</b> <b>at</b> mile 209, the Lawrence Service Area {{is located in the}} median. Afterward, the turnpike has a diamond interchange with 222nd Street, which is signed as Leavenworth County Road 1, at Exit 212 (Tonganoxie/Eudora). The highway then travels northeast and passes through it eastern terminal toll booth. This is the final toll booth on the route travelling east and all vehicles must pay their final toll before continuing. The turnpike then enters Bonner Springs. It crosses Wolf Creek before leaving Leavenworth County and entering Wyandotte County. In Bonner Springs, the turnpike intersects K-7, westbound US-24, westbound US-40, and the southern terminus of US-73 at Exit 224 (Bonner Springs, formerly Exit 223) with a trumpet interchange. The mileposts on the route switch to match those of I-70 after this interchange.|$|E

5|$|The first {{church on}} {{this site was}} {{established}} by Cwyllog, a female saint, in the 6th century, although the exact date is unknown. She {{was one of the}} daughters of St Caw, a king in northern Britain who lost his lands and sought safety with his family in Anglesey, where the ruler Maelgwn Gwynedd gave him land. There was a church <b>here</b> <b>at</b> the time of the Norwich Taxation in 1254, and the present walls may date from around 1200. In the 13th century, the church was {{under the control of the}} Augustinian canons of the priory at Penmon, on the east of Anglesey, with the priory gaining the income from the tithes paid to the church. The priory gradually diminished in size and importance, and in 1522 the prior and two canons (the entire community, at that stage) affixed their signature to the lease of Llangywllog church to Richard Bulkeley (a member of a prominent family from the Anglesey town of Beaumaris) for the period of 100 years at an annual rent of £1.|$|E
5|$|The turnpike {{continues}} east along I-70 {{and crosses}} Tecumseh Creek. The Topeka Service Area {{is located on}} the north side of the road east of <b>here</b> <b>at</b> mile 188. It is accessed by ramps on the right side of the highway in both directions. Just east of the service area, the turnpike enters Douglas County while passing over US-40 without an interchange. The route then curves to the southeast and runs roughly parallel to US-40. A series of curves takes the turnpike farther east as it reaches Exit 197 (Lecompton), a folded diamond interchange with the western terminus of K-10. After this, the highway continues farther east and enters the city of Lawrence, where it shares a diamond interchange with McDonald Drive at Exit 202 (West Lawrence). McDonald Drive leads to US-59 south of the turnpike. East of here, the highway bends east-northeasterly, crosses the Kansas River, and then intersects US-40 and US-59, which run concurrently, at Exit 204 (East Lawrence).|$|E
