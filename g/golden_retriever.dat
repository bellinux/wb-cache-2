5|$|Type I is more {{widespread}} in Doberman Pinscher, but is as {{common in the}} Shetland Sheepdog as the Scottish Terrier.

5|$|In {{both the}} United Kingdom and the United States, there are well over {{twice as many}} Labradors {{registered}} as the next most popular breed. If the comparison is limited to dog breeds of a similar size, then there are around 3–5 times as many Labradors registered in both countries as the next most popular breeds, the German Shepherd Dog and <b>Golden</b> <b>Retriever.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Let me {{tell you}} the story about Susan and Dave and how they bought this dog. I first should preface that the Fords had had two {{previous}} <b>golden</b> <b>retrievers.</b> One lived 13 years and died, and then another one died a year ago in August after 9 years. So we are fairly partial, I would say, to <b>golden</b> <b>retrievers.</b>|$|R

5|$|In the field, the AWS is less exuberant {{than the}} English Springer Spaniel, {{but it is}} as skilled in {{retrieval}} as Labrador or <b>Golden</b> <b>Retriever.</b> It is versatile regardless {{of the type of}} terrain, and in the water it is not the fastest swimmer but has a high level of endurance. The breed is also good at agility and flyball, with the first of the breed receiving a flyball championship title in 1993.|$|E
5|$|Labrador Retrievers {{have proven}} {{to have a high}} success rate at {{becoming}} guide dogs. A study was recently done on how well four different breeds (Labrador Retriever, <b>Golden</b> <b>Retriever,</b> Labrador Retriever/Golden Retriever Mix, and German Shepherds) trained to become guide dogs. In this experiment, German Shepherds had the highest chance of not completing it. Labrador Retrievers and Labrador Retriever/Golden Retriever Mix had the highest success rate. However, German Shepherds and Golden Retrievers had a higher success rate after going through longer training than the training required for Labrador Retrievers.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} a variety of campaigns in other states to select a state dog. Georgia was {{undecided}} over choosing a state dog in 1991, with {{an attempt to make}} the <b>Golden</b> <b>Retriever</b> the official dog failing after a vote in the Georgia State Senate; an opposing campaign promoted the Bulldog, the mascot of the University of Georgia. The campaign to make the Siberian Husky the Washington state dog failed in the Washington House of Representatives in 2004.|$|E

5|$|Welsh Springers can be {{prone to}} entropion, which is a {{disorder}} that affects the eyelids. The condition causes them to curl inwards, pressing the eyelashes against {{the surface of the}} eye itself and causing them to scratch it. This can lead to irritation and damage to the cornea. In most cases it only affects the lower eyelid on one or both eyes, but in some cases the upper eyelid can be affected as well. Symptoms can include tearing, squinting, the rubbing of the eyes, thick discharge from the eyes and rolling of the eyelid along with wetness on the hairs next to the eyelids. There is no medical treatment for entropion, and surgical correction may be necessary depending on the severity of the case. This condition may be present soon after birth, or later in life as a secondary condition to other eye related diseases or infections. Other breeds also affected by the condition include the Chow Chow, Great Dane, <b>Golden</b> <b>Retriever</b> and the English Springer Spaniel.|$|E
25|$|Breeds {{that are}} {{commonly}} affected include Boxer, Scottish Terrier, Basset Hound, Airedale Terrier, Chow Chow, German Shepherd, Poodle, St. Bernard, Bulldog, Beagle, Rottweiler and <b>Golden</b> <b>Retriever.</b> The <b>Golden</b> <b>Retriever</b> is especially susceptible to developing lymphoma, with a lifetime risk of 1:8.|$|E
25|$|The Honourable Archie Marjoribanks took a <b>Golden</b> <b>Retriever</b> to Canada in 1881, and {{registered}} 'Lady' with the AKC in 1894. These {{are the first}} records of the breed in these two countries. The breed was first registered in Canada in 1927, and the <b>Golden</b> <b>Retriever</b> Club of Ontario (GRCO) was formed in 1958. The cofounders of the GRCO were Cliff Drysdale, an Englishman who had brought over an English Golden, and Jutta Baker, daughter-in-law of Louis Baker, who owned Northland Kennels. The GCRO in later years expanded to become the <b>Golden</b> <b>Retriever</b> Club of Canada.|$|E

25|$|Other {{characteristics}} {{related to}} their hunting heritage are a size suited for scrambling {{in and out of}} boats and an inordinate love for water. <b>Golden</b> <b>Retrievers</b> are exceptionally trainable—due to their intelligence, athleticism and desire to please their handlers—and excel in obedience trials. They are also very competitive in agility and other performance events. Harsh training methods are unnecessary, as <b>Golden</b> <b>Retrievers</b> often respond very well to positive and upbeat training styles.|$|R

25|$|The <b>Golden</b> <b>Retriever</b> is a large, {{strongly}} built breed with a dense, water-repellant wavy coat. As a {{dog with}} origins in pedigree breeding, {{and due to}} its widespread historical popularity, some regional variations have emerged in the breed; therefore, the three subtypes of the <b>Golden</b> <b>Retriever</b> reflect the typical variations in dimensions and coat. However, all Golden Retrievers are blonde, yellow, or gold in colour and all subtypes are susceptible to the same health problems.|$|E

25|$|Malignant {{histiocytosis}} (histiocytic sarcoma) is {{an aggressive}} cancer found primarily in certain breeds including the Bernese Mountain Dog, rottweiler, <b>golden</b> <b>retriever</b> and flat coated retriever.

25|$|<b>Golden</b> <b>Retrievers</b> {{are known}} to have genetic {{disorders}} and other diseases. Hip dysplasia is common in the breed; when buying a puppy, the pedigree should be known and be examined by the OFA or by PennHIP for hip disease. Obesity is also common in the breed because <b>Golden</b> <b>Retrievers</b> love to eat. Puppies should eat about three cups of food a day and adults three to five cups, depending on the food and how active the dog is.|$|R

40|$|The role an individual’s genetic {{background}} plays on phenotype and biological behavior of sporadic tumors remains incompletely understood. We showed previously that lymphomas from <b>Golden</b> <b>Retrievers</b> harbor defined, recurrent chromosomal aberrations that occur less frequently in lymphomas from other dog breeds, suggesting spontaneous canine tumors provide suitable models to define how heritable traits influence cancer genotypes. Here, we report a complementary approach using gene expression profiling in a naturally occurring endothelial sarcoma of dogs (hemangiosarcoma). Naturally occurring hemangiosarcomas of <b>Golden</b> <b>Retrievers</b> clustered separately {{from those of}} non-Golden Retrievers, with contributions from transcription factors, survival factors, and from pro-inflammatory and angiogenic genes, and which were exclusively present in hemangiosarcoma and not in other tumors or normal cells (i. e., they were not due simply to variation in these genes among breeds). Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor 1 (VEGFR 1) was among genes preferentially enriched within known pathways derived from gene set enrichment analysis when characterizing tumors from <b>Golden</b> <b>Retrievers</b> versus other breeds. Heightened VEGFR 1 expression in these tumors also was apparent at the protein level and targeted inhibition of VEGFR 1 increased proliferation of hemangiosarcoma cells derived from tumors of <b>Golden</b> <b>Retrievers,</b> but not from other breeds. Our results suggest heritable factors mold gene expression phenotypes...|$|R
