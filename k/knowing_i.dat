500|$|Blender asked Bowie in 2002 {{whether he}} still {{believed}} his public declaration was his biggest mistake. After a long pause, he said, [...] "I don't {{think it was}} a mistake in Europe, but it was a lot tougher in America. I had no problem with people <b>knowing</b> <b>I</b> was bisexual. But I had no inclination to hold any banners nor be a representative of any group of people." [...] Bowie said {{he wanted to be a}} songwriter and performer rather than a headline for his bisexuality, and in [...] "puritanical" [...] America, [...] "I think it stood in the way of so much I wanted to do".|$|E
500|$|Georges Méliès as Professor Barbenfouillis. Méliès, a {{pioneering}} French film-maker and magician now {{generally regarded as}} {{the first person to}} recognize the potential of narrative film, had already achieved considerable success with his film versions of Cinderella (1899) and Joan of Arc (1900). His extensive involvement in all of his films as director, producer, writer, designer, technician, publicist, editor, and often actor makes him one of the first cinematic auteurs. Speaking about his work late in life, Méliès commented: [...] "The greatest difficulty in realising my own ideas forced me to sometimes play the leading role in my films... I was a star without <b>knowing</b> <b>I</b> was one, since the term did not yet exist." [...] All told, Méliès took an acting role in at least 300 of his 520 films.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of shooting, Jack Nicholson had {{appeared}} in two films, and had worked with Roger Corman as the lead in The Cry Baby Killer. According to Nicholson, [...] "I went in to the shoot <b>knowing</b> <b>I</b> {{had to be very}} quirky because Roger originally hadn't wanted me. In other words, I couldn't play it straight. So I just did a lot of weird shit that I thought would make it funny." [...] According to Dick Miller, all of the dialogue between his character and Mel Welles was ad-libbed. During a scene in which writer Charles B. Griffith played a robber, Griffith remembers that [...] "When [...] and I forgot my lines, I improvised a little, but then I was the writer. I was allowed to." [...] However, Welles states that [...] "Absolutely none of it was ad-libbed [...] every word in Little Shop was written by Chuck Griffith, and I did ninety-eight pages of dialogue in two days." ...|$|E

500|$|Richie had {{recorded}} two melodies for [...] "We Are the World", which Jackson took, adding music and {{words to the}} song in the same day. Jackson stated, [...] "I love working quickly. I went ahead without even Lionel <b>knowing,</b> <b>I</b> couldn't wait. I went in and came out the same night with the song completed—drums, piano, strings, and words to the chorus." [...] Jackson then presented his demo to Richie and Jones, who were both shocked; they did not expect the pop star to see {{the structure of the}} song so quickly. The next meetings between Jackson and Richie were unfruitful; the pair did not produce any additional vocals and got no work done. It was not until the night of January 21, 1985, that Richie and Jackson completed the lyrics and melody of [...] "We Are the World" [...] within two and a half hours, one night before the song's first recording session.|$|E
500|$|In the {{preliminary}} {{round of the}} 200-meter butterfly, Tarwater turned in the fastest time, acknowledging that nerves {{played a role in}} his fast swim. In the semi-finals, he achieved a new personal best of 1:54.72 and finished with the second-fastest time, just seven-tenths of a second slower than Phelps. [...] "It felt great, but there's still no celebrating for me," [...] he said about the swim. In the finals, Tarwater was exactly tied with Phelps and on world-record pace through the first 50 meters. He stayed near Phelps for 150 meters before fading on the last 50. In the last 25 meters, he was passed by Gil Stovall, who beat his personal best by a second and a half, to finish third. Tarwater also swam a new personal best – 1:54.46 – but it was not good enough to make the Olympic team, missing out by six-tenths of a second. After the race, he briefly considered retiring before deciding to finish the meet. [...] "I don't know what the future is going to bring, but I didn't want to go out <b>knowing</b> <b>I</b> didn't get back up," [...] he said. He finished eighth in the 100-meter butterfly; earlier, he failed to make the finals in the freestyle events.|$|E
500|$|Duvall was {{the only}} American actor {{nominated}} for the Best Actor Oscar; his competition were Britons Michael Caine (who had co-starred with Duvall in the 1976 The Eagle Has Landed), Tom Conti, Tom Courtenay and Albert Finney. During an interview before the Oscar ceremony, Duvall offended some Britons by complaining about [...] "the Limey syndrome," [...] claiming [...] "the attitude {{with a lot of}} people in Hollywood is that what they do in England is somehow better than what we do here." [...] Duvall, who was presented with the Oscar by country music star Dolly Parton, said of winning the award, [...] "It was a nice feeling, <b>knowing</b> <b>I</b> was the home-crowd favorite." [...] In a New York Times profile of Duvall that appeared six years after Tender Mercies release, Nan C. Robertson wrote that despite four previous Academy Award nominations, [...] "it was not until he won as Best Actor in 1983 ... that moviegoers woke up in droves to this great natural resource. The reason was that they rarely recognized Mr. Duvall from one part to another, so effortlessly did he vanish into each celluloid persona." [...] Foote, who was so certain he would not win the Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar for To Kill a Mockingbird he had not attended the 1963 ceremony, made sure he was present to collect his award for Best Original Screenplay. The critical success of the film allowed Foote to exercise considerable control over his future film projects, including final veto power over major decisions; when such power was denied, Foote would simply refuse to do the film.|$|E

2500|$|Partly {{to fulfill}} this need, he formed Roubini Global Economics, an {{economic}} consultancy for financial analysis. In describing {{the purpose of}} RGE Monitor, he said, [...] "the world is my home, so everything about society and culture—no matter how —is worth <b>knowing.</b> <b>I</b> am an information junkie and created RGE Monitor to collect information about what’s happening around the world." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Norwich sacked manager Nigel Worthington, Roberts {{applied for}} the manager's job. [...] "I tried to go for it... <b>knowing</b> <b>I</b> wasn't {{going to get it}} but I'd never really been for an {{interview}} and I thought if I did it would stand me in good stead. But I never got a response from the club and that really disappointed me. A week after Peter Grant got the job I got a letter through the post saying 'We won't be considering you this time'.

According to Weeks, Of course, Jimmy lost money once the drug dealers were removed from the streets in the summer raid, but he always had other business going on. <b>Knowing</b> <b>I</b> had to build something on the side, I had concentrated on my shylocking and gambling businesses. The drug business had been good while it lasted. But our major involvement in it was over." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rowling cites Jane Austen as her {{favourite}} {{author and}} a major influence. Rowling has said: [...] "My attitude to Jane Austen is accurately summed up by that wonderful line from Cold Comfort Farm: 'One of the disadvantages of almost universal education was that {{all kinds of people}} gained a familiarity with one's favourite books. It gave one a curious feeling; like seeing a drunken stranger wrapped in one's dressing gown.'" [...] The Harry Potter series is known for its twist endings, and Rowling has stated that, [...] "I have never set up a surprise ending in a Harry Potter book without <b>knowing</b> <b>I</b> can never, and will never, do it anywhere near as well as Austen did in Emma." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rock {{musician}} David Bowie famously {{declared himself}} bisexual {{in an interview}} with Melody Maker in January 1972, a move coinciding with the first shots in his campaign for stardom as Ziggy Stardust. In a September 1976 interview with Playboy, Bowie said, [...] "It's true—I am a bisexual. But I can't deny that I've used that fact very well. I suppose it's {{the best thing that ever}} happened to me." [...] In a 1983 interview, he said it was [...] "the biggest mistake I ever made", elaborating in 2002 he explained [...] "I don't think it was a mistake in Europe, but it was a lot tougher in America. I had no problem with people <b>knowing</b> <b>I</b> was bisexual. But I had no inclination to hold any banners or be a representative of any group of people. I knew what I wanted to be, which was a songwriter and a performer [...] America is a very puritanical place, and I think it stood in the way of so much I wanted to do." ...|$|E
2500|$|Theisen placed {{second at}} the Canadian Track and Field Championships {{and went on}} to finish {{eleventh}} in the heptathlon at the 2012 London Olympics. A score of 6376 points at the 2013 Hypo Meeting was enough to win the high-profile event ahead of Tatyana Chernova, and she formed a rare Canadian combined events double alongside the men's winner Damian Warner. The 2013 World Championships in Athletics was a wide open event in the heptathlon in that two of the world's best competitors in Chernova and Jessica Ennis-Hill both missed the competition as a result of injuries. Despite putting up a personal best 6,530 points, she had to settle for silver, just 56 points behind eventual World Champion Hanna Melnichenko. After Gotzis, this was the second major competition in a row where the Canadian men and women multi-eventers had a double medal meeting after Warner won bronze at the world championships; however, a double gold for the power couple of Eaton and Eaton-Theisen was narrowly missed. She commented on her achievement saying [...] "I'm at peace getting silver <b>knowing</b> <b>I</b> gave it 110 per cent. Ashton and I talked about both being on the podium here. I watched Ashton {{the last couple of years}} winning his medals and could only imagine what that actually felt like." [...] In her last outing that year, she was third at the Decastar meet in France.|$|E
