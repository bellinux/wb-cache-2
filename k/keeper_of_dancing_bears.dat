50|$|As {{part of its}} {{project to}} {{eradicate}} the erstwhile practice <b>of</b> <b>dancing</b> <b>bears</b> in India, Wildlife SOS runs a simultaneous rehabilitation program for the Qalandar (Kalandar) tribals, for whom the bears provided a source of livelihood. The program, started in 2001, includes incentives for the bear-owners, {{in the form of}} sustainable livelihood alternatives. Wildlife SOS may provide seed funds for ventures or assist in the purchase of shops, handcarts, bicycles, cycle-rickshaws, auto-rickshaws or something that could support an alternative career for the individual, as well as providing training for alternative jobs as drivers, small scale poultry or goat farmers, metallurgy or gem-cutting and stone polishing for costume jewelry. Rehabilitated tribals form nearly 50% of the workforce at Wildlife SOS’ rescue centres.|$|R

5000|$|The {{dance was}} rough and clumsy. During the dance, the dancers would yell out: [...] "It's a Bear!" [...] The genuine Grizzly Bear step was in correct {{imitation}} of the movements <b>of</b> a <b>dancing</b> <b>bear,</b> moving or <b>dancing</b> to the side. A very heavy step to the side with a decided bending of {{the upper part of}} the body from one side to the other, a decidedly ungraceful and undignified movement when performed as a dance.|$|R

[...] Not so the wise, from superstition free, [...] Who find small pleasure in the bended knee; [...] Quick to discriminate 'twixt good and bad, [...] And willing in the king to find the cad-- [...] No reason seen why genius and conceit, [...] The power to dazzle {{and the will to}} cheat, [...] The love of daring and the love of gin, [...] Should not dwell, peaceful, in a single skin.

5000|$|Garcia {{the bear}} was {{released}} in January 1996 and retired in May 1997. He is a tie-dyed bear {{that seems to be}} a tribute to Jerry Garcia of The Grateful Dead, designed by Nicholas Scarborough. A group <b>of</b> differently colored <b>dancing</b> <b>bears,</b> originally artwork from the back of an album cover, was one of the band's many iconic images. The guitarist and the bear share a birthday, but the bear was supposedly [...] "born" [...] the date that Jerry died (August 9, 1995). The fast retirement for this Beanie Baby was due to an alleged lawsuit that the Garcia family filed against the Ty company, claiming that the name [...] "Garcia" [...] was used without permission from the family. In cooperation with the lawsuit, Garcia was retired and a similar bear named Peace was released. Peace has a peace sign, while Garcia does not.|$|R
5000|$|Musically, Sly is {{generally}} considered as being fairly eclectic, especially in the first act, where the tragedy has not yet begun to unfold. The act is essentially quite gay, many people revelling and arguing in a London tavern. Its highlight is actually a [...] "set number": Sly's song <b>of</b> the <b>dancing</b> <b>bear,</b> a theme that recurs throughout the opera. There are reminiscences of Kurt Weill, Wolf-Ferrari's earlier comedies and many other composers, including Leoncavallo. But, as the second act unfolds, some of the verismo aspects begin to become paramount, especially in the musical writing of the first duet between Sly and Dolly. Beginning at the point {{at the end of}} Act II where Sly realizes that it has been a game, the opera is pure verismo, especially in Sly's highly dramatic [...] "No, io non sono un buffone", to the end where Sly, having just slashed his wrists, finds out that he had killed himself too soon (shades of Roméo et Juliette), and that Dolly truly loves him. While this is not made clear in the libretto, it is safe to assume that the joke ends up badly for all concerned: Sly dies, Dolly loses her beloved, and the Earl will undoubtedly lose his mistress, although {{there can be little doubt}} that he will find another one.|$|R
