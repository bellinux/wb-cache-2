5|$|Another legend {{tells of}} the digging of the church into the ground after the Ottoman conquest of Bulgaria (14th–15th centuries), so that the Ottomans would not desecrate it. According to that story, the church was buried and <b>forgotten</b> <b>about</b> by the villagers until the mid-19th century, when a local coincidentally rediscovered it while tying his donkey to a nearby cherry tree. A {{different}} version places the cherry tree {{on top of the}} hill under which the church stood. Reportedly, that cherry tree was struck by a thunderbolt, which enabled the villagers to reach the buried gate through the now-hollow trunk. The church was reconsecrated soon thereafter and dedicated to the 4th-century military saint Demetrius of Thessaloniki.|$|E
5|$|Boas Munyonga {{represented}} Zambia in men's judo. He qualified {{by being}} awarded an additional {{place in the}} additional places category for the African continent by the International Judo Federation. He participated in the men's middleweight class, which includes athletes under 90 kilograms in weight. Munyonga was Zambia's oldest athlete at the London Olympic Games, at age 31, and was taking part in his first Olympic Games. He {{said that he would}} do his best in the event. Munyonga faced Takahiro Nakai of Japan on 31 July in the round of 32. When the ball rang to signal the start of the match, Munyonga held Nakai by the leg and placed him onto the corners of the mat. The primary umpire signalled the boxers to face each other and disqualified Munyonga and declared Nakai the match's winner. Munyonga stated that he regretted the move and that he had <b>forgotten</b> <b>about</b> a rule which stated the leg was not allowed to be held by another competitor.|$|E
5|$|At the palace, Charming {{struggles with}} his {{feelings}} for Snow. The King (Alan Dale) commands him to forget her because the marriage to Abigail is worth great wealth to the kingdom. Charming sends a letter by carrier pigeon to Snow begging {{her to come}} and see him so they can be together. The letter reaches her just before she can take the potion. Snow makes it to the palace but she is seized by the guards and thrown into the dungeon. There she meets a dwarf named Grumpy (Lee Arenberg), who was falsely imprisoned for stealing a diamond that he wanted to give to his girlfriend. Another dwarf, Stealthy (Geoff Gustafson), shows up to rescue Grumpy, who asks Stealthy to free Snow as well. The guards kill Stealthy as they try to escape and try to recapture Grumpy. Snow threatens to burn down the palace unless they let Grumpy go and take her in his place. The King tells Snow he will not let her interfere with the wedding. She must tell Charming she does not love him, or the King will kill him. Snow obeys because she loves Charming too much to let him die, but both are left heartbroken. Snow leaves and is soon joined by Grumpy and six other dwarfs, who offer her a place to stay. She considers the potion but Grumpy warns her that those feelings however painful, are part of her. Charming calls off the wedding to look for Snow and the dwarves hear about it from Red Riding Hood. Grumpy joyfully tells Snow the good news, but she has <b>forgotten</b> <b>about</b> Charming. The pain was too great to bear and she drank the potion.|$|E

5|$|Dick Rubin {{handled the}} film's props, {{and set up}} a {{makeshift}} office in the corner of stage 9 throughout production. Rubin's philosophy as property master was that nearly every actor or extra ought to have something in their hands. As such, Rubin devised and fabricated about 350 props for the film, 55 of which were used in the San Francisco tram scene alone. Many of the props were updated designs of items previously seen in the television series, such as phasers and handheld communicators. The only prop that remained from the original television series was Uhura's wireless earpiece, which Nichols specifically requested {{on the first day of}} shooting (and all the production crew save those who had worked on the television show had <b>forgotten</b> <b>about).</b> The new phaser was entirely self-contained, with its own circuitry, batteries, and four blinking lights. The prop came with a hefty $4000 price tag; to save money, the lights were dropped, reducing the size of the phaser by a third. A total of 15 of the devices were made for the film. The communicators were radically altered, as by the 1970s the micro-miniaturization of electronics convinced Roddenberry that the bulky handheld devices of the television series were no longer believable. A wrist-based design was decided upon, with the provision that it look far different from the watch Dick Tracy had been using for decades previous. Two hundred communicators were fashioned, but only a few were the $3500 top models, used for close-ups of the device in action. Most of the props were made from plastic, as Rubin thought that in the future man-made materials would be used almost exclusively.|$|E

25|$|To this remark, the Buddha {{tells them}} that the Brahmins have indeed <b>forgotten</b> <b>about</b> their past if they said such things. The {{fact is that the}} women in the Brahmin caste can get pregnant, give birth, and take care of their children. But the Brahmins still say that they are born from the Mouth of the God Brahma and other (castes) are born from Brahma's feet. Thus, the Brahmin's words are untrue.

25|$|In modern cricket, the {{two lines}} usually aimed for by fast bowlers is the {{so-called}} corridor of uncertainty, the area just outside the batsman's off stump, or actually on the stumps. It is difficult for the batsman to tell whether or not such a ball is likely to strike their wicket, and thus to know whether to attack, defend or leave the ball. This technique was historically known as off theory (contrast leg theory), but it is now so routine that it is rarely given a name at all, or <b>forgotten</b> <b>about</b> completely. Of course, variation in line is also important and deliveries aimed at the leg stump can also serve a purpose.|$|E

Having recovered her memories, Homura forces herself {{to complete the}} witch transformation {{at the cost of}} having her soul destroyed, to protect Madoka from the Incubators. At that moment Sayaka and a new girl named Nagisa Momoe, whose witch form is actually Charlotte—the witch that killed Mami—lead Madoka and the others in breaking the barrier to reach Homura's real body. Madoka recovers her memories and power as the Law of Cycles and reaches for Homura, but the latter releases the curse in her Soul Gem which she reveals is not one of despair, but love. With this power, retaining her human form, Homura suppresses Madoka's powers while transcending into what she considers to be a demon.|$|E
25|$|The {{story of}} Caritoux's {{victory in the}} 1984 Vuelta a España is quite {{extraordinary}} in that he won a Grand Tour as a second year professional which is quite unusual. However, even more unusual is that, one week before the start, neither Caritoux or his team had any intention of actually riding the race. At that time the Vuelta started {{in the second half}} of April and the Skil manager Jean de Gribaldy had made a promise at the start of the year to the Vuelta organisers that his team would be on the start line. A promise he had <b>forgotten</b> <b>about</b> but the organisers had not, de Gribaldy was threatened with a £50,000 fine if the team did not ride, he had to scrape together a squad for the Vuelta at the last minute, this included the holidaying Caritoux, who was told to get to Geneva and then fly to Jerez de la Frontera in the south of Spain where the Vuelta was starting.|$|E
25|$|Although {{chewing gum}} {{can be traced}} back to civilizations around the world, the {{modernization}} and commercialization of this product mainly took place in the United States. The American Indians chewed resin made from the sap of spruce trees. The New England settlers picked up this practice, and in 1848, John B. Curtis developed and sold the first commercial chewing gum called The State of Maine Pure Spruce Gum. In this way, the industrializing West, having <b>forgotten</b> <b>about</b> tree gums, rediscovered chewing gum through the First Americans. Around 1850 a gum made from paraffin wax, which is a petroleum product, was developed and soon exceeded the spruce gum in popularity. To sweeten these early gums the chewer would often make use of a plate of powdered sugar, which they would repeatedly dip the gum into to maintain sweetness. William Semple filed an early patent on chewing gum, patent number 98,304, on December 28, 1869.|$|E
