5000|$|The {{immediate}} impounding of {{an apparently}} uninsured vehicle replaces the former method {{of dealing with}} insurance spot-checks where drivers were issued with an HORT/1 (so-called because the order was form number 1 issued by the Home Office Road Traffic dept). This 'ticket' was an order requiring that within seven days, from midnight of the date of issue, the driver concerned was to take a valid <b>insurance</b> <b>certificate</b> (and usually other driving documents as well) to a police station of the driver's choice. Failure to produce an <b>insurance</b> <b>certificate</b> was, and still is, an offence. The HORT/1 was commonly known - even by the issuing authorities when dealing with the public - as a [...] "Producer". As these are seldom issued now and the MID relied upon to indicate the presence of insurance or not, {{it is incumbent upon}} the insurance industry to accurately and swiftly update the MID with current policy details and insurers that fail to do so can be penalised by their regulating body.|$|R
