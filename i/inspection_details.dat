40|$|Port {{state control}} (PSC) {{inspection}} {{is the most}} important mechanism to ensure world marine safety. Existing PSC risk assessment systems estimate the risk of each candidate ship on the target factors, which is recorded in the inspection database, to help the port authorities identify ships at high risks. The performance of these systems is difficult to be improved due to the limited available factors. This paper presents an improved risk assessment system, which is strengthened by web mining technique. This system employs profile-based wrapper to extract <b>inspection</b> <b>details</b> from inspection report web pages and adopts a template-matching-based method to extract new target features from deficiency details. By incorporating new target features, the risk assessment system based on Support Vector Machine is improved. Experimental results have shown that the new system improves the risk assessment accuracy effectively. Department of ComputingRefereed conference pape...|$|E
40|$|The data {{acquisition}} system for a Eurisys segmented Clover germanium detector is described with special emphasis placed on the system architecture and exp erimental results. The CAMAC-based module consists of four high-resolution quasitriangular shaping amplifiers with accompanying timing filter amplifiers and constant-fraction discriminator circuits. Both time and energy signals are digitized for the four high resolution channels. Three shaping amplifiers process the side channel signals which are digitized with a 12 -bit converter. Signals from an 8 -channel BGO card included for Compton suppression are used to veto a clean germanium signal in the trigger logic board. Threshold voltages as well as logic commands in the unit are controlled via a CAMAC interface chip, and readout is accomplished via a front panel FERABUS readout architecture. Both analog and digital signals are multiplexed to the front panel for <b>inspection.</b> <b>Details</b> of the design and experimental results are presented. I...|$|E

40|$|Objective, accurate, {{and fast}} {{assessment}} of damage to buildings after an earthquake is crucial for timely remediation of material losses and safety of occupants of buildings. Currently, visual inspection of buildings for damage and manual identification of damage severity are the primary evaluation methods. However, visual inspections {{have a number of}} shortcomings. In different research studies, visual observations and inspector judgment have been shown to differ amongst different inspectors in terms of thoroughness and reliability of <b>inspection,</b> <b>details</b> included in inspection reports, and results of the damage assessment. Automatic damage assessment could help in evaluating damaged buildings by reducing the dependency on subjective data collection and evaluation of the damage observations. Laser scanning is a promising tool for field data collection for post-earthquake damage assessment as laser scanners are able to produce accurate and dense 3 D measurements of the environment. Laser scan data can be processed to extract damage indicators. Identifying the damage severity requires the damage indicators be related to the building components in 3 D space, as well as the structural configuration of the building, details of the reinforcement, and actual material properties. A Building Information Model (BIM) within which a structural system and damage are represented can serve as the underlying information source for damage assessment and post-earthquake seismic performance evaluation. However, further research is required for utilizing laser scan data and as-is BIMs generated from laser scan data for storing and reasoning about damaged buildings. In order to address the challenges and needs stated above, (1) the unique characteristics of laser scan data, which can potentially limit the reliability of the scanner data for crack identification under certain scenarios were investigated; (2) the information requirements for representing and reasoning about damage conditions were formalized; (3) a representation schema for damaged conditions was developed; and (4) reasoning mechanisms were studied for identifying the damage modes and severities of components using the identified damage parameters and structural properties. The research methods involved experiments to identify the characteristics of laser scanners for damage detection, investigation of damage assessment guidelines, and investigation and analysis of Building Information Modeling standards. The results of the investigation on damage assessment standards were used for identifying the information requirements for the representation of damage and for developing the representation schema. Validation studies include: (1) validation of the information requirements by an analysis to quantify the sensitivity of damage assessment to the identified damage parameters; (2) validation of generality of the representation schema to masonry components; (3) validation of the reasoning mechanisms with a user study. The contributions include: (1) characterization of two laser scanner for detecting earthquake induced cracks; (2) identification of information requirements for visual assessment of earthquake damage on reinforced concrete shear walls; (3) a schema for representing the earthquake damage for supporting the visual assessment; and (4) approach for identifying the damage mode and severity of reinforced concrete walls...|$|E

40|$|Our {{objective}} was to evaluate the diagnosis of swine cysticercosis by examining "ante mortem" (inspection of the tongue), "post mortem" (<b>inspection</b> and <b>detailed</b> necropsy) and ELISA for research in serum of antibodies (Ab-ELISA) and antigens (Ag-ELISA). Seven (7) pigs were experimentally infected orally with eggs of Taenia solium and another 10 were naturally infected. In the pigs experimentally infected, inspection of the tongue was negative in all animals, in the routine <b>inspection</b> <b>detailed</b> necropsy and cysticercis were identified in all of them. In pigs with heavy natural infection, inspection of the tongue identified cysticerci in two (20 %), while at inspection with necropsy the parasites were identified in large quantities in all animals. In ELISA for antibody search (Ab-ELISA) TS- 14 recombinant protein was used, and in search for antigen (Ag-ELISA) a monoclonal antibody against this protein. In animals experimentally infected, blood was collected weekly for 140 days. The Ab-ELISA identified an increase in titers of antibody to cysticerci 21 days after infection, {{and at the end}} of the experimental period six animals (86 %) were positive to the test. The search for circulating antigens (Ag-ELISA) was positive in two pigs 28 to 91 days after infection. All naturally infected pigs were positive for Ag-ELISA and Ab-ELISA. The search for antibodies and antigens by ELISA in serum from 30 pigs of a local farm and without history of cysticercosis was negative. Thus, the use of TS- 14 antigen in ELISA test (Ab-ELISA) can be useful for the diagnosis of cysticercosis in pigs with low infection...|$|R

40|$|This report {{inventories}} {{the surface}} distribution of silicic tuffs in Nye, Esmeralda, and Lincoln Counties, NV, {{based on a}} review of available literature. The inventory was taken to provide a data base in evaluating tuff sites for the disposal of high-level nuclear waste. Silicic ash-flow tuffs that are about 11 to 34 million years (my) old are widespread in these counties. These rocks are locally deformed by right-lateral movement along Walker Lane and the Las Vegas Shear Zone, and left-lateral movement along a zone from near the Nevada Test Site (NTS) to the Utah border, and are commonly offset by steeply dipping normal faults. The normal faults that bound horsts, grabens, and tilted-fault blocks of the Basin-and-Range Province began to form 30 my ago; some are still active. Tuff distribution is discussed on a regional basis. Tuff thicknesses and alterations, structural complexity, and proximity to recent faulting, recent volcanism, and mineral resources are discussed for each area.
