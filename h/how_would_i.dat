Since he started accompanying Cao Cao on his military campaigns, he has often helped Cao devise and develop strategic plans. Many people, including his family members and relatives, hardly knew what was on his mind or what he had said. The Wei Shu recorded that Xin Tao (辛韜), a maternal cousin of Xun You, once asked Xun You on why he urged Cao Cao to attack Ji Province. Xun You replied, [...] "Since Zuozhi has come on behalf of Yuan Tan to surrender, it's expected that the Imperial Army will go there to pacify the area. <b>How</b> <b>would</b> <b>I</b> know why?" [...] Xin Tao and others did not dare to ask Xun You again about state and military affairs after that.|$|E
