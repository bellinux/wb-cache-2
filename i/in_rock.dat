5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the riot, federal troops were deployed <b>in</b> <b>Rock</b> Springs. They escorted the surviving Chinese miners, most of whom had fled to Evanston, Wyoming, back to Rock Springs a week after the riot. Reaction came swiftly from the era's publications. <b>In</b> <b>Rock</b> Springs, the local newspaper endorsed the outcome of the riot, while in other Wyoming newspapers, support for the riot was limited to sympathy for the causes of the white miners. The massacre <b>in</b> <b>Rock</b> Springs touched off a wave of anti-Chinese violence, especially in the Puget Sound area of Washington Territory.|$|E

5|$|The Chinese at Rock Springs {{were aware}} of the {{animosity}} and rising racial tension with white miners, but had not taken any precautions, as no prior events indicated there would be any race riots. Underlying the outbreak of violence were racism and resentment of the policies of the Union Pacific Coal Department. Until 1875, the mines <b>in</b> <b>Rock</b> Springs were worked by whites; in that year, a strike occurred, and the strikers were replaced with Chinese strikebreakers less than two weeks after the strike began. The company resumed mining with 50 white miners and 150 Chinese miners in its employ. As more Chinese arrived <b>in</b> <b>Rock</b> Springs, bitterness from the white miners increased. At the time of the massacre, there were about 150 white miners and 331 Chinese miners <b>in</b> <b>Rock</b> Springs.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} <b>in</b> <b>Rock</b> Springs was stabilized {{as early}} as September 15, when Warren first requested the removal of federal troops, but the mines at Rock Springs remained closed for a time. On September 30, 1885, white miners, mostly Finnish immigrants {{who were members of}} the Knights of Labor, walked out of mines in Carbon County, Wyoming, in protest of the company's continued use of Chinese miners. <b>In</b> <b>Rock</b> Springs, the white miners were not back at work in late September, because the company still used Chinese labor. Rock Springs steadily became quieter, and, on October 5, 1885, emergency troops, except for two companies, were removed. However, the temporary posts of Camp Medicine Butte, established in Evanston, and of Camp Pilot Butte, <b>in</b> <b>Rock</b> Springs, remained long after the riot. Camp Pilot Butte closed in 1899 after the onset of the Spanish–American War.|$|E

5|$|Wyoming's {{territorial}} Governor Francis E. Warren visited Rock Springs on September 3, 1885, the {{day after}} the riot, to make a personal assessment. After his trip to Rock Springs, Warren traveled to Evanston, where he sent telegrams to U.S. President Grover Cleveland appealing for federal troops. Back <b>in</b> <b>Rock</b> Springs, the riot had calmed, but the situation was still unstable. Two companies of the United States Army's 7th Infantry arrived on September 5, 1885. One company, under the command of a Lieutenant Colonel Anderson, was stationed in Evanston, Wyoming; the other, under a Colonel Chipman, was stationed <b>in</b> <b>Rock</b> Springs. At Camp Murray, Utah Territory, Colonel Alexander McDowell McCook was ordered to augment the garrison sent to Wyoming with six more companies.|$|E

5|$|Although most Chinese {{workers in}} 1880 were {{employed}} in the coal mines around Wyoming and Sweetwater County, the Chinese <b>in</b> <b>Rock</b> Springs worked mostly in occupations outside of mining. In addition to Chinese laborers and miners, a professional gambler, a priest, a cook, and a barber resided in the city. In Green River, Wyoming, there was a Chinese doctor. Chinese servants and waiters found work in Green River and in Fort Washakie. In Atlantic City, Miner's Delight, and Red Canyon, Wyoming, Chinese gold miners were employed.

5|$|By 3:30p.m. the {{massacre}} was well under way. A {{group of women}} <b>in</b> <b>Rock</b> Springs had gathered at the plank bridge, where they stood and cheered on the rampage. Two of the women reportedly fired shots at the Chinese. As the riot wore on into the night, the Chinese miners scattered into the hills, lying in the grass to hide. Between four and nine p.m., rioters {{set fire to the}} camp houses belonging to the coal company. By nine p.m., all but one Chinese camp house was burned completely. In all, 79 Chinese homes were destroyed by fire. Damage to Chinese-owned property was estimated at around $147,000.|$|E
5|$|Due to a miscommunication, the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia (MPDC) {{failed to}} follow its own search {{parameters}} <b>in</b> <b>Rock</b> Creek Park, leaving Levy's body to decompose for a year. Furthermore, the MPDC had been informed, and soon dismissed, that Ingmar Guandique, already arrested for attacking women <b>in</b> <b>Rock</b> Creek Park, had confessed to attacking Levy. The MPDC instead put {{much of its}} focus on the revelation that Levy {{was having an affair}} with Congressman Gary Condit, a married Democrat then serving his fifth term representing California's 18th congressional district, and a senior member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Condit had an overwhelming alibi (he was in meetings with the Vice President), was never named as a suspect by police and was eventually cleared of any involvement in the disappearance. However, due to the cloud of suspicion raised by the intense media focus on the missing intern and the later revelation of the affair, Condit lost his bid for re-election in 2002.|$|E
