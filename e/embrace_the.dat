More generally, the classical grammatico-historical method is prevalent, which provides a basis for some openness to alternative approaches to understanding the scriptures.|$|E

5|$|Critics had a mixed {{reaction}} to the episode, with many characterising it as somewhat weaker than others in the series, with the change in tone dividing commentators.

5|$|Matthias {{established}} a professional army (the Black Army of Hungary), reformed {{the administration of}} justice, reduced {{the power of the}} barons, and promoted the careers of talented individuals chosen for their abilities rather than their social statuses. Matthias patronized art and science; his royal library, the Bibliotheca Corviniana, was one of the largest collections of books in Europe. With his patronage, Hungary became the first country to <b>embrace</b> <b>the</b> Renaissance from Italy. As Matthias the Just, the monarch who wandered among his subjects in disguise, he remains a popular hero of Hungarian folk tales.|$|E

5|$|William De Morgan {{was unwilling}} to {{compromise}} on quality or <b>embrace</b> <b>the</b> trend towards mass production, and by this time his work was significantly more expensive than similar works by other designers. Consequently, his ceramics business was becoming increasingly unviable financially. In 1906 his first novel, Joseph Vance, was published and became a great success, prompting DeMorgan to close the ceramics business in 1907 to concentrate on writing. Mary Watts attempted to replicate DeMorgan's tile designs at Watts's pottery in Compton {{but was unable to}} do so, and investigated other tile manufacturers.|$|E
5|$|After a brief stay in Europe, Atangana {{returned}} to his homeland in Cameroon, which by then was a League of Nations mandate territory under {{the administration of the}} French Third Republic. The French doubted his loyalties at first, but Atangana served them with the same ardour he had shown the Germans and regained his post as paramount chief. During the remainder of his life, he oversaw the Westernisation of his subjects and the improvement of his domains despite the erosion of his powers due to French policies and unrest among his people. He never advocated resistance to the European powers, preferring to <b>embrace</b> <b>the</b> European as a means of personal enrichment and in the service of African interests. After his death in 1943, Atangana was largely forgotten. However, since Cameroon's independence in 1960, Cameroonian scholars have rediscovered his story.|$|E
5|$|Burton {{points out}} that many {{conservative}} critics and magazines (John Simon, James Bowman, the World Report) initially either criticized the film or praised it only for its non-political elements. Only after {{the popularity of the}} film was well-established did conservatives <b>embrace</b> <b>the</b> film as an affirmation of traditional values. Burton implies the liberal-left could have prevented the conservatives from claiming rights to the film, had it chosen to vocalize elements of the film such as its criticism of military values. Instead, the liberal-left focused on what the film omitted, such as the feminist and civil rights movements.|$|E

5|$|Producer Yoshinori Kitase and {{director}} Motomu Toriyama have {{explained that the}} objective in mind when designing Final Fantasy X-2 was to <b>embrace</b> <b>the</b> concept of change as the game's theme and establish a more upbeat atmosphere than its predecessor. The reuse of the engine and locations from the original game meant that the team could {{spend most of their}} time focusing on the gameplay systems and plot. To portray the drastic change in Spira, the developers excluded summons, redesigned towns, and included vehicles. The low-flying vehicles were added to allow the player quicker access and mobility to the areas that were already available in the previous title.|$|E
5|$|Shedding one's clothes, Kutzer observes, is {{a symbol}} of {{shedding}} the social self and its constraints to then <b>embrace</b> <b>the</b> freedom of the animal self, but Lucie, who sets off for an adventure after shedding her pinafore and handkerchiefs, fails to embrace her animal self and learns nothing new about herself. True, she learns something about the animal world – hens shed their stockings and robins their red vests – but Lucie began her adventure as a well-behaved, proper young Victorian child and remains so at tale's end, taking delight in the goffered pinafore and the laundered handkerchiefs that confine and define such a child. Having not learned something new about herself, Lucie's success as a literary heroine is moot.|$|E

Stricken with grief, the vicar heads off to reclaim his wayward daughter. At the end of the marriage ceremony the farmer receives his payment, and the squire and Olivia <b>embrace.</b> <b>The</b> vicar arrives shortly afterwards, but after failing to persuade his daughter to return home with him leaves in despair. Olivia learns later that the marriage was a sham, but continues to live in Thornhill's house until he offers her as a prostitute to an acquaintance of his. Olivia flees in a rage and returns home, where she is reunited with her family. Thornhill, now out for revenge, has the vicar arrested and thrown into jail for unpaid debts.|$|E

However, Jaws kills the shark and escapes. Bond and Amasova flee in an escape pod as Atlantis is sunk. Amasova reminds Bond {{that she has}} vowed to kill him as she picks up Bond's gun. Then, she admits to having forgiven him and the two <b>embrace.</b> <b>The</b> Royal Navy recovers the pod and the two spies are seen in an intimate embrace through its port window, much to the bemusement of their superiors on the ship.|$|E
5|$|Their {{painting}} styles {{evolved from}} the formal Neoclassical approach of the Royal Academy in Copenhagen to <b>embrace</b> <b>the</b> evolving European trends in Realism and Impressionism, including the plein air approach adopted by the Barbizon School. The artists were especially attracted by the opportunities for painting en plein air, focusing on {{the activities of the}} local fishermen and their modest cottages. In the absence of any rules within the colony, the painters freely developed their individual styles. Nevertheless, one of the interests they shared was to paint scenes of their own social gatherings, whether playing cards, celebrating or simply eating together.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of this growth, on 9 April 2006 the OCC began to include {{download}} sales alongside physical sales when compiling the UK Albums Chart. That same day, the OCC also launched a dedicated weekly chart based solely on sales of album downloads in the UK. Approximately 64,000 albums were downloaded during the week of the chart's launch, of which just under 2,000 were of This New Day by the British band <b>Embrace,</b> <b>the</b> chart's first number one. By the end of 2006 nearly 2.8million album downloads had been purchased, which comprised 1.8% of the total album sales. The following year the UK's online music revenue grew to , which made the nation Europe's largest consumer of online music. By the end of decade over 25million albums had been downloaded and the market comprised 12.5% of total album sales. Following Embrace, a further 99 artists topped the chart; fifteen did so with two albums. Including original soundtracks and compilations, a total of 121 albums reached number one during the 2000s. , the UK Album Download Chart continues to be published each week by the OCC.|$|E
5|$|In May 1941 the {{majority}} of Layforce were sent as reinforcements to the Battle of Crete. Almost {{as soon as they}} landed it was decided that they could not be employed in an offensive role and would instead be used to cover the withdrawal route towards the south. They were ill-equipped for this type of operation, as they were lacking in indirect fire support weapons such as mortars or artillery; they were armed mainly with rifles and a few Bren light machine guns. By 31 May the evacuation was drawing to a close and the commandos, running low on ammunition, rations, and water, fell back towards Sphakia. In the end, {{the vast majority of the}} commandos were left behind on the island, becoming prisoners of war. About 600 of the 800 commandos that had been sent to Crete were listed as killed, missing, or wounded; only 179 commandos managed to get off the island. In April 1941 men from No. 7 Commando took part in the Bardia raid, but by late July 1941 Layforce had been severely reduced in strength. Reinforcements were unlikely given the circumstances. The operational difficulties that had been exposed during the Bardia raid, combined with the inability of the high command to fully <b>embrace</b> <b>the</b> Commando concept, had largely served to make the force ineffective. The decision was made to disband Layforce.|$|E
