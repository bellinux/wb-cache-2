2500|$|Typically each kiln took {{around a}} day to load, three days to fire, two days to cool and {{a day to}} unload. The degree of burning was {{controlled}} {{by trial and error}} from batch to batch by varying the amount of fuel used. There were large temperature differences between the center of a charge and the material close to the wall, so a mixture of under-burned, well-burned and <b>dead-burned</b> lime was normally produced. [...] Typical fuel efficiency was low and the job was labour-intensive, with a loading gang and an unloading gang who would work the kilns in rotation through the week. The heat was intense and the smoke considerable, making this a very dangerous occupation.|$|E

50|$|Calcining at {{different}} temperatures produces magnesium oxide of different reactivity. High temperatures 1500 - 2000 °C diminish the available surface area and produces <b>dead-burned</b> (often called dead burnt) magnesia, an unreactive form {{used as a}} refractory. Calcining temperatures 1000 - 1500 °C produce hard-burned magnesia, which has limited reactivity and calcining at lower temperature, (700-1000 °C) produces light-burned magnesia, a reactive form, also known as caustic calcined magnesia. Although some decomposition of the carbonate to oxide occurs at temperatures below 700 °C, the resulting materials appears to reabsorpb carbon dioxide from the air.|$|E
50|$|Lime is {{commonly}} {{available in the}} United States as Type S hydrated mason's lime (ASTM C 207). However, this lime product {{is intended to be}} added to Portland cement to improve workability and for several other reasons. Type S lime is not reliable as a sole cement because some manufacturers fire the lime above 1,100 °C which begins to cause vitrification of impurities in the lime. This over-burned lime is sometimes called <b>dead-burned</b> because lime fired at these temperatures loses reactivity leading to poor or no bond strength and will not hold up to freeze-thaw weather cycles.|$|E

5000|$|Only lump stone {{could be}} used, because the charge needed to [...] "breathe" [...] during firing. This also limited {{the size of}} kilns and {{explains}} why kilns were all much the same size. Above a certain diameter, the half-burned charge {{would be likely to}} collapse under its own weight, extinguishing the fire. So kilns always made 25-30 tonnes of lime in a batch. Typically the kiln took a day to load, three days to fire, two days to cool and a day to unload, so a one-week turnaround was normal. The degree of burning was controlled by trial and error from batch to batch by varying the amount of fuel used. Because there were large temperature differences between the center of the charge and the material close to the wall, a mixture of underburned (i.e. high loss on ignition), well-burned and <b>dead-burned</b> lime was normally produced. Typical fuel efficiency was low, with 0.5 tonnes or more of coal being used per tonne of finished lime (15 MJ/kg).|$|E
5000|$|Rotary kilns {{started to}} be used for lime {{manufacture}} {{at the start of the}} 20th century and now account for a large proportion of new installations if energy costs are less important. The early use of simple rotary kilns had the advantages that a much wider range of limestone size could be used, from fines upwards, and undesirable elements such as sulfur can be removed. On the other hand, fuel consumption was relatively high because of poor heat exchange compared with shaft kilns, leading to excessive heat loss in exhaust gases. Old fashioned [...] "long" [...] rotary kilns operate at 7 to 10 MJ/kg. Modern installations partially overcome this disadvantage by adding a preheater, which has the same good solids/gas contact as a shaft kiln, but fuel consumption is still somewhat higher, typically in range of 4.5 to 6 MJ/kg. In the design shown, a circle of shafts (typically 8-15) is arranged around the kiln riser duct. Hot limestone is discharged from the shafts in sequence, by the action of a hydraulic [...] "pusher plate". Kilns of 1000 tonnes per day output are typical. The rotary kiln is the most flexible of any lime kilns able to produce soft, medium, or hard burned as well as <b>dead-burned</b> lime or dolime.|$|E
40|$|Leaching of {{particulate}} <b>dead-burned</b> magnesite with {{hydrochloric acid}} at 45 °C was investigated with special {{regard to the}} effectof acid concentration (from 0. 1 M to 4. 8 M) on the rate of chemical dissolution of magnesium, calcium and iron.

40|$|A novel {{two-stage}} {{froth flotation}} {{process for the}} recovery of pure magnesite from low grade ores is described. The process consists of a first-stage, magnesite flotation step where a rougher magnesite concentrate is floated with amine collectors. The first-stage froth concentrate is then repulped in fresh water, and quartenary ammonium salt and fuel oil are added to float the remaining impurities. The results from laboratory batch tests show that a high-grade magnesite concentrate assaying 0. 99 - 0. 20 % SiO// 2 and 2. 84 - 0. 46 % CaO can be produced. Regulation of the variables controlling magnesite froth flotation also allows the variation of the ratio %CaO:%SiO// 2, between the acceptable limits 0. 32 to 5. 79. This ratio {{is important to the}} quality of <b>dead-burned</b> magnesite...|$|E
40|$|Since 1980 's, many mines {{have been}} closed and {{abandoned}} due to the exhaustion of deposits and declining prices of international mineral resources. Because {{of the lack of}} post management for these abandoned mines, Farm land and rivers were contaminated with heavy metal ions and sludge. We studied on the solidification/stabilization of heavy metal ions, chromium ions and lead ions, using magnesia-phosphate cement. Magnesia binders were used calcined-magnesia and <b>dead-burned</b> magnesia. Test specimens were prepared by mixing magnesia binder with chromium ions and lead ions and activators. We analyzed the hydrates by reaction between magnesia-phosphate cement and each heavy metal ions by XRD and SEM-EDAX, and analyzed the content of heavy metal ions in the eruption water from the specimens for the solidification and stabilization of heavy metal ions by ICP. The results was shown that calcined magnesi...|$|E
40|$|Investment {{opportunities}} {{exist in}} British Columbia to develop refractory mineral deposits and to produce energy-intensive, value-added products derived from these minerals. Mgnesite, silica, olivine, kyanite, andalusite, shale, pyrophyllite, graphite, dolomite, and brucite {{occur in the}} province. Magnesite and silica are produced in relatively large quantities from mines in the southeast region of the province. Abundant and relatively inexpensive energy, especially hydroelectricity, is available within the province. This is a key ingredient {{for the production of}} highly-priced, energy-intensive, value-added products. Silicon carbide, metallurgical and chemical grade silicon, magnesium metal, ferrosilicon, glass, synthetic and insulating mineral fibres are some of the large tonnage products that should be considered. Other relatively large tonnage products of interest are caustic magnesia, <b>dead-burned</b> magnesia, magnesium hydroxide and sodium silicate. British Columbia has a well developed transportation and industrial infrastructure and number of deep water ports. These are an attractive features for companies interested in producing energy-intensive products using imported raw materials. With ready acces...|$|E
40|$|High alumina {{refractory}} castables {{based on the}} Al 2 O 3 -MgO-CaO diagram ternary system were prepared using tabular alumina, white electrofused corundum, calcined alumina, synthetic spinel, <b>dead-burned</b> magnesia, dolomite, and calcium aluminate cement as starting raw materials. Two kinds of slags with 9. 02 and 4. 14 CaO/SiO 2 ratios were studied for slag resistance by means of crucible tests. The corrosion thickness increases with increase in magnesia content in all the designed compositions. The slag penetration decreases with increases in spinel content. Taking into account these results a refractory castable composition for its positioning into a steelmaking ladle was chosen. Microstructural studies by SEM of samples taken from the slag line and wall in a steelmaking ladle were carried out. The correct amount of spinel required for practical applications {{was determined by the}} Al 2 O 3 -MgO-CaO-SiO 2 diagram quaternary system. A detailed model of the attack mechanisms is proposed.
