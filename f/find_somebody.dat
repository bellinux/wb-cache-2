In late 2004, on the island, they debate whether to defect to the rival faction of {{survivors}} led by John Locke (Terry O'Quinn). Intercut throughout the episode, {{a series of}} off-island scenes show Sun about to give birth and Jin experiencing a series of difficulties {{in his efforts to}} reach the hospital with a gift of a stuffed panda. The ending shows that Jin's and Sun's scenes do not focus on the same birth; Jin's scenes are flashbacks to events before the plane crash, while Sun's are flashforwards to sometime after she escapes the island. A subplot follows Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) and Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick) on board the Kahana, where they learn more about the freighter's mission and <b>find</b> <b>somebody</b> they once knew.|$|E

500|$|Founder Ted Frank {{has said}} that [...] "the whole reason I started this is {{because there is a}} high {{probability}} of district courts rubber-stamping settlements. I think these are very bad settlements that the [...] will provide guidance for when judges should or shouldn’t approve settlements.” He has also said [...] "the class action landscape has long included some “professional settlement objectors” who target large cases in hopes of extracting a percentage of the attorney fees as a reward. But that doesn’t solve the problem. The niche isn’t being filled unless you <b>find</b> <b>somebody</b> crazy like me who is willing to spend dozens of hours of his own time and hundreds of dollars of his own money to make a claim he can’t benefit from." [...] Frank said in an objection in a case at the Court of the United States District Court Northern District of Ohio of the CCAF, [...] "while the Center focuses on bringing objections to unfair class action settlements, it makes no effort to engage in quid pro quo settlements to extort attorneys, and has never settled an objection. The Center analyses complaints from consumers aggrieved by class actions settlement notices to determine whether a settlement is objectionable under the law because it favors attorneys over class members." ...|$|E
500|$|The song {{opens with}} the group harmonising [...] "Sha la la la" [...] over pianos.

[...] Fuse writer Jeff Benjamin described the song as being reminiscent of 1960s girl group The Ronettes but with a more modern feel for 2015 radio, highlighting the line [...] "They try to romance me but you got that nasty and that's what I want" [...] as an example. Digital Spy writer Lewis Corner thought that the line [...] "He might got the biggest ca-aa-ar" [...] does not fool listeners into thinking that [...] "they're not actually talking about his Fiat 500." [...] Several music critics compared the song to recordings from the Motown era in the 1950s and 1960s, with Andy Gill of The Independent likening it to material composed by Shadow Morton. Emilee Lindner of MTV News likened the production to material composed by Phil Spector. The Christmas mix version features added church bells and jingles.|$|E

When Leslie grows concerned they are rushing into their marriage, Ron insists it is not her place to say what works for them, and offers the advice: [...] "Leslie I got married twice, both times I was a lot older than those two and both marriages ended in divorce...and a burning effigy. Who's to say what works? You <b>find</b> <b>somebody</b> you like, and you roll the dice, its all anyone can do." [...] At which point Leslie Knope replies [...] "Wait, weren't you married 3 times?"

[...] In [...] "Eagleton," [...] Leslie discovers Ron's birthday, which he previously kept secret, and he fearfully suspects Leslie is planning an extravagant party for him. However, her surprise party for Ron is instead a quiet, private one more appropriate for Ron's personality: an evening alone with a steak, scotch, and copies of his favorite movies.|$|E

Zevon oversaw music for the short-lived revival of the NBC series Route 66 (1993), contributing that show's main title theme, [...] "If You Won't Leave Me I'll <b>Find</b> <b>Somebody</b> Who Will".

My people wander around my study until the novel is done. It’s one reason I’m {{very careful not to}} write about people I don’t like. If I <b>find</b> <b>somebody</b> creeping in that I’m not really fond of, I usually take him out.” [...] Pollitt had even earlier noted how Tyler’s characters seem to take on {{a life of their own}} that she doesn’t seem to totally control: “Her complex, crotchety inventions surprise us, but one senses they surprise her too.” ...|$|E

2500|$|His {{relationship}} with then UKIP party leader Nigel Farage {{was full of}} [...] "animosity" [...] and [...] "tension", and he called for Farage to step down as party leader on several occasions. Farage has also called Carswell [...] "irrelevant", in response to them supporting different campaigns to leave the European Union in the 2016 referendum. In response to Carswell calling for the party leader's resignation, Farage said that Carswell should [...] "put up or shut up", further saying that [...] "either he's {{going to have to}} accept that [...] or do something different". After Farage's resignation as UKIP leader following the EU referendum, Carswell tweeted a [...] "sunshades smiley emoji", which some parts of the media described as showing the [...] "uneasy relationship" [...] between the two men, Carswell later said to the BBC that [...] "I tweet smiley faces all the time, I'm very optimistic". He also said that while Farage had [...] "played a role" [...] in the referendum, the resignation was [...] "a huge opportunity" [...] for the party. This happened a week after Farage suggested that Carswell could be kicked out of the party, saying that [...] "We <b>find</b> <b>somebody</b> inside our party who doesn't agree with anything the party stands for, it's a very odd state of affairs".|$|E
2500|$|As Secretary, Cisneros {{attacked}} head on fair housing policies. [...] “Fair housing,” he told Guy Gugliotta of the Washington Post, “is so {{vital that}} we cannot accomplish {{any of the}} other goals without it.” [...] He unveiled a plan for HUD to provide $70 million in housing vouchers enabling low-income Americans to rent living space in the communities of their choice, an idea that brought Cisneros criticism in affluent circles in his native Texas and elsewhere. [...] When it came to justice in home loans, Cisneros, through his agency, stood firm to lenders by letting them know that HUD would no longer tolerate unfairly denying minorities access to home loans, and aggressively penalized lenders who broke fair lending laws. [...] The department also made it easier for alleged victims of fair housing to file complaints. During Cisneros's four-year term, the agency's decisions in favor of victims of housing discrimination resulted in the awarding of a total of $80 million in damages, compared with $13 million in the previous four years. Cisneros greatly eased the bureaucracy to deal with fair housing issues much swifter. [...] "The train started to run on time," [...] with complaints being heard much faster, said John Relman of the Washington Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs. [...] "It's hard to <b>find</b> <b>somebody</b> in that position who could be more supportive of fair housing than Henry Cisneros." ...|$|E

Collins added [...] "Never mind who shot JR. The big question now is: who pushed PR?

[...] Matt Bayliss of The Express admitted that he was not afraid to say [...] "teatime telly has never looked so good".

[...] The Daily Mail's soap critic Jaci Stephen stated [...] "Who pushed Paul Robinson? It's a cliff-hanger on Friday, as Mr Nasty's wicked ways catch up with him. It's not quite a storyline of the epic proportion of Who Killed JR? from the days of Dallas, but back in Erinsborough, there are just as many suspects." ...|$|E
