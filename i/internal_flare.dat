5000|$|Wide angle lens - a lens that reproduces {{perspective}} that generally looks [...] "wider" [...] than a normal lens. The problem {{posed by the}} design of wide-angle lenses is to bring to an accurate focus light from a wide area without causing <b>internal</b> <b>flare.</b> Wide-angle lenses therefore {{tend to have more}} elements than a normal lens to help refract the light sufficiently and still minimise aberrations whilst adding light-trapping baffles between each lens element.|$|E

The result was seen as disappointing, and caused <b>internal</b> divisions to <b>flare</b> up, with former Federal Leader Bob Brown calling upon Senator Lee Rhiannon to resign, citing the [...] "need for renewal".|$|R
5000|$|Anglurah Agung {{belonged to}} a {{hereditary}} line of chief ministers in the Balinese kingdom, the Agung family, which claimed descent from the ancient kings of Kediri on Java. He {{was the son of}} Gusti Agung Kalanganyar, and was adopted as an infant by his uncle Gusti Agung Kedung, whom he succeeded as minister. He is also known by the names Gusti Agung Di Made or Gusti Agung Maruti. He governed {{in the age of the}} Gelgel king Dalem Di Made. Certain Balinese texts indicate that he was involved in warfare on Lombok in 1645; this island was a bone of contention between Bali and the Makassar kingdom of South Sulawesi. After the death of a Balinese king in 1651, <b>internal</b> wars <b>flared</b> up on Bali. Eventually Anglurah Agung usurped power in Gelgel, and is documented as ruler from 1665. According to Balinese sources he took command at a point when the old king had lost his grip on state affairs and was deserted by his grandees; [...] "Kyayi (Anglurah) Agung's statemanship had captured the hearts of many people with his sweet voice and fine words". He briefly entertained contacts with the Dutch East Indies Company (Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie or VOC) in 1665-1667. Balinese historiography holds a negative view of Anglurah Agung and portrays him as a power-hungry usurper.|$|R
