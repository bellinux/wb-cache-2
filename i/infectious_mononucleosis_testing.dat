Among the tests for EBV-specific antibodies the sensitivity was good, with only small differences between the different assays. However, there was a greater variation in specificity, which varied between 100 % (Enzygnost) and 86 % (Biotest).

40|$|SYNOPSIS One hundred <b>infectious</b> <b>mononucleosis</b> and {{the same}} number of non-infectious mono-nucleosis sera were studied to {{evaluate}} the sensitivity and specificity of horse erythrocytes in the diagnosis of <b>infectious</b> <b>mononucleosis.</b> Titres of horse agglutinins in <b>infectious</b> <b>mononucleosis</b> sera ranged from 28 to 7, 168 with a geometric mean of 550, whereas the corresponding sheep agglutinin titres ranged from less than 7 to 3, 584, with a geometric mean of 126. Horse agglutinin titres of non-infectious mononucleosis sera ranged from less than 7 to 896, with a geometric mean of 59. <b>Infectious</b> <b>mononucleosis</b> sera <b>tested</b> with horse erythrocytes before and after absorption with guinea pig kidney and beef erythrocytes showed patterns different from those of non-infectious mononucleosis sera, even when sheep agglutinin titres were too low for satisfactory evaluation. After absorption with guinea pig kidney, horse agglutinin titres of <b>infectious</b> <b>mononucleosis</b> sera were uniformly higher than in the corresponding serum absorbed with beef erythrocytes. This was not the case for non-infectious mononucleosis sera. Results confirm our previously expressed view that horse erythrocytes are preferable to sheep erythrocytes in the serological diagnosis of <b>infectious</b> <b>mononucleosis.</b> In a previous study of 27 <b>infectious</b> <b>mononucleosis</b> and 26 non-infectious mononucleosis sera, we found that horse erythrocytes are highly specific for diagnosis if sera are tested before and after absorp-tion with guinea pig kidney and beef erythrocytes (Lee, Davidsohn, and Slaby, 1968).

The remaining 27 cases had serological evidence of prior infection (presence of viral-capsid IgG and EBV nuclear antibodies and absence of IgM).

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of hepatitis {{in the absence}} of jaundice in <b>infectious</b> <b>mononucleosis</b> has recently been emphasized. In 1946 Cohn and Lidman (1) published results of serial liver function studies carried out on 15 successive hospitalized patients with proved <b>infectious</b> <b>mononucleosis</b> in which there was neither clinical nor laboratory evidence of jaundice. All cases showed evidence of hepatic dysfunction as shown by abnormalities in more than 1 test. Carter and Maclagan (2) have stud-ied 19 cases of <b>infectious</b> <b>mononucleosis</b> only one of which was jaundiced, and found elevated values for the thymol turbidity test in the serum of 58 per cent and a positive serum colloidal gold re-action in 95 per cent. Since no serial study of the cephalin-cholesterol flocculation test in the serum of non-jaundiced in-fectious mononucleosis cases had been published, it was thought of interest to compare the results of this test in such serum with those of other meas-ures of liver function. MATERIALS AND METHODS Serial determination of liver function tests were made on 19 consecutive cases of <b>infectious</b> <b>mononucleosis</b> with-out jaundice, 13 of which were hospitalized and 6 of which were ambulatory. 2 Determination of sheep RBC agglutination was based on the method of Stuart (3) and agglutination in a final serum dilution of 1 : 160 or higher was considered significant. By this criteria, all except 2 cases had elevated heterophile antibody titers: one of these, at 1 : 80, showed guinea pig kidney and beef RBC absorption characteristics of the <b>infectious</b> <b>mononucleosis</b> antibody, and the other had a blood picture and a clinical course typical of <b>infectious</b> <b>mononucleosis.</b> Cephalin-cholesterol flocculation <b>tests</b> were done by the technique of Hanger (4) and a reaction of 2 + or more in 24 hours was considered abnormal.

40|$|A direct {{enzyme-linked}} immunosorbent assay {{was developed}} for the measurement of immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody to cytomegalovirus (CMV). Wells of microtiter plates were coated with anti-human IgM. Each patient's serum was added at a dilution of 1 : 100, and IgM from the serum was allowed to react with anti-human IgM. The amount of CMV-specific IgM antibody bound was determined by measuring the intensity of color change after the addition of peroxidase-labeled CMV antigen and substrate. Nuclei of infected cells served as an antigen source. CMV IgM could be detected only in IgM fractions of sera from patients with a recent CMV infection. Rheumatoid factor did not cause false-positive results. No cross-reactions were observed when paired sera from 22 patients with herpes simplex or varicella and single sera from 12 patients with suspected <b>infectious</b> <b>mononucleosis</b> were <b>tested</b> by the direct {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}}. Each of 17 patients with a seroconversion for CMV antibody showed CMV-specific IgM antibody. In six of these patients the antibody was detected in the initial serum.

40|$|Peripheral lymphoid cells, from 12 {{cases of}} acute <b>infectious</b> <b>mononucleosis</b> (IM), were <b>tested</b> in a micro chromium- 51 release assay for {{cytotoxic}} activity against {{a variety of}} cell lines that {{did or did not}} carry the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome. Unfractionated lymphocytes from these patients were cytotoxic to both types of cell lines, as were lymphocytes from healthy individuals. If, however, lymphocytes bearing complement receptors were removed, the residual IM lymphocyte fraction was specifically cytotoxic for EBV-genome-carrying cell lines. The residual lymphocyte fraction in normal donors had no such effect. Heterophile-positive IM is caused by EBV, and these results indicate that, during the acute phase of this disease, patients harbor killer cells, probably T cells, which specifically kill EBV-genome-carrying B cells in vitro. No such specificity for EBV-genome-psitive target cells was found in normal lymphocytes stimulated in vitro with autologous EBV-genome-positive lymphoblastoid cells. Such stimulated cells were highly cytotoxic to both genome-positive and negative lines after removal of complement receptor-positive lymphocytes...|$|R

The LCA of twenty-four sera from {{patients with}} systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) was also tested against the same panels of cells. The percentage of acute phase lymphocytes killed by sera from patients with IM or SLE was significantly less (P less than 0. 001 and P less than 0. 05 respectively) than the percentage of normal or convalescent cells killed by the same sera. This reduction could not be explained by lymphocyte donor variation as the same donors {{were used in the}} acute and convalescent phases of IM.

The proportion of CD 4 + CD 25 high T cells in blood from <b>infectious</b> <b>mononucleosis</b> patients was significantly lower than in seropositive donors (P[*]=[*] 0. 05). Using the FOXP 3 marker for T reg the same frequency and extra-follicular distribution of T reg was noted in <b>infectious</b> <b>mononucleosis</b> and control tonsils.
