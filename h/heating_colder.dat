40|$|The {{changes of}} thiobarbituric acid-reactive-substances (TBARS), ascorbic acid (AsA), and {{glutathione}} (GSH) contents, and the Ca(2 +) homeostasis in heat acclimated grape (Vitis vinifera L. cv. Jingxiu) leaves under cold stress, or in cold-acclimated grape leaves under heat stress, were investigated. Under <b>cold</b> (<b>heat)</b> stress, TBARS content in <b>heat</b> (<b>cold)</b> acclimated leaves {{was less than}} that in the control, showing that the <b>heat</b> (<b>cold)</b> acclimation could alleviate the damage of cell membrane caused by <b>cold</b> (<b>heat)</b> stress. The contents of GSH and AsA in <b>heat</b> (<b>cold)</b> acclimated leaves under <b>cold</b> (<b>heat)</b> stress were higher {{than those in the}} control. The deposits of calcium antimonite, an indicator for Ca(2 +) localization, were observed within the vacuoles, intercellular spaces in the control leaves of young grape plants grown under normal temperature. After <b>heat</b> or <b>cold</b> acclimation, the amount of cytosolic Ca(2 +) was more, but Ca(2 +) in vacuoles and intercellular spaces in mesophyll cells less than that in the control. The cytosolic Ca(2 +) were pumped back to vacuoles and intercellular spaces in <b>heat</b> acclimated-cells under <b>cold</b> stress, or in <b>cold</b> acclimated-cells under <b>heat</b> stress, both of which did not cause the chloroplast structure to be destroyed. In contrast, a large amount of cytosolic Ca(2 +) in the control mesophyll cells of grape, which was directly laid under <b>heat</b> or <b>cold</b> stress, appeared in intracellular spaces, and the chloroplast structure was destroyed. These results suggest that Ca(2 +) homeostasis is very important in grape mesophyll cells during the process of cross-adaptation of plants to temperature stresses. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

40|$|Abstract Background In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} mechanisms that may underlie the sensitization of trigeminal spinal subnucleus caudalis (Vc; the medullary dorsal horn) and upper cervical spinal cord (C 1 -C 2) nociceptive neurons to <b>heat,</b> <b>cold</b> and mechanical stimuli following topical capsaicin {{treatment of the}} facial skin, nocifensive behaviors as well as phosphorylation of extracellular regulated-kinase (pERK) in Vc and C 1 -C 2 neurons were studied in rats. Results Compared to vehicle application, capsaicin application to the lateral facial skin produced 1 hour later a flare in the skin, and also induced significantly greater nocifensive behaviors to <b>heat,</b> <b>cold</b> or mechanical stimulus of the lateral facial skin. The intrathecal (i. t.) injection of the MEK inhibitor PD 98059 markedly attenuated the nocifensive behaviors to these stimuli in capsaicin-treated rats. Moreover, the number of pERK-like immunoreactive (pERK-LI) cells in Vc and C 1 -C 2 was significantly larger following the <b>heat,</b> <b>cold</b> and mechanical stimuli in capsaicin-treated rats compared with vehicle-treated rats. The number of pERK-LI cells gradually increased following progressive increases in the heat or mechanical stimulus intensity and following progressive decrease in the cold stimulus. The ERK phosphorylation in Vc and C 1 -C 2 neurons was strongly inhibited after subcutaneous injection of the capsaicin antagonist capsazepine in capsaicin-treated rats. Conclusion The present findings revealed that capsaicin treatment of the lateral facial skin causes an enhancement of ERK phosphorylation in Vc and C 1 -C 2 neurons as well as induces nocifensive behavior to <b>heat,</b> <b>cold</b> and mechanical simulation of the capsaicin-treated skin. The findings suggest that TRPV 1 receptor mechanisms in rat facial skin influence nociceptive responses to noxious cutaneous thermal and mechanical stimuli by inducing neuroplastic changes in Vc and C 1 -C 2 neurons that involve in the MAP kinase cascade. </p...|$|R
