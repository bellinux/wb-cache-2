40|$|Few finance {{theories}} {{consider the}} influence of "skewness" (or large and asymmetric but unlikely outcomes) on financial choice. We investigated the impact of skewed <b>gambles</b> on subjects' neural activity, self-reported affective responses, and subsequent preferences using {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (FMRI). Neurally, skewed <b>gambles</b> elicited more anterior insula activation than symmetric <b>gambles</b> equated for expected value and variance, and positively skewed <b>gambles</b> also specifically elicited more nucleus accumbens (NAcc) activation than negatively skewed <b>gambles.</b> Affectively, positively skewed <b>gambles</b> elicited more positive arousal and negatively skewed <b>gambles</b> elicited more negative arousal than symmetric <b>gambles</b> equated for expected value and variance. Subjects also preferred positively skewed <b>gambles</b> more, but negatively skewed <b>gambles</b> less than symmetric <b>gambles</b> of equal expected value. Individual differences in both NAcc activity and positive arousal predicted preferences for positively skewed <b>gambles.</b> These findings support an anticipatory affect account in which statistical properties of <b>gambles</b> [...] including skewness [...] can influence neural activity, affective responses, and ultimately, choice...|$|R

5|$|The {{end of the}} war {{drastically}} reduced military investment in the island.

50|$|Since {{the prizes}} {{are exactly the}} same, it follows that you will prefer <b>Gamble</b> A to <b>Gamble</b> B {{if and only if}} you believe that drawing a red ball is more likely than drawing a black ball (according to {{expected}} utility theory). Also, there would be no clear preference between the choices if you thought that a red ball was as likely as a black ball. Similarly it follows that you will prefer <b>Gamble</b> C to <b>Gamble</b> D if, and only if, you believe that drawing a red or yellow ball is more likely than drawing a black or yellow ball. It might seem intuitive that, if drawing a red ball is more likely than drawing a black ball, then drawing a red or yellow ball is also more likely than drawing a black or yellow ball. So, supposing you prefer <b>Gamble</b> A to <b>Gamble</b> B, it follows that you will also prefer <b>Gamble</b> C to <b>Gamble</b> D. And, supposing instead that you prefer <b>Gamble</b> B to <b>Gamble</b> A, it follows that you will also prefer <b>Gamble</b> D to <b>Gamble</b> C.|$|R

5|$|In the United States, the {{legality}} of DFS has been determined on a state-by-state basis based on local <b>gambling</b> laws and other rulings.

A number of state attorneys general have issued opinions concluding that DFS {{is a form of}} illegal <b>gambling,</b> while the state of Nevada declared that DFS games must be licensed as a sports pool. The New York State ruling, which resulted from an investigation of DFS services after it was alleged that employees working for DraftKings and FanDuel had used inside information to win cash prizes from each other, spawned retaliatory lawsuits from the companies which alleged that the rulings were the result of a misinterpretation of the nature of their services. The state has since joined other states, such as Massachusetts and Virginia, in choosing to legalize and regulate DFS rather than prohibit it.|$|E
