40|$|Extraction {{of chicken}} {{reticulocyte}} chromatin with 2. 0 M NaCl removed 96 % of chromosomal protein and yields two DNA components after dialysis and high-speed centrifugation. The bulk of chromosomal DNA (ca. 99 %) is rendered free of protein, {{and is thus}} soluble in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8. 0. The other component (ca. 1 %) displays a high protein/DNA ratio, and is insoluble in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8. 0. These DNAs can be separated {{on the basis of}} their solubilities. Analysis of the reassociation kinetics with total chicken DNA of these DNAs reveals marked differences. Whereas total DNA and the soluble component (DNA-S) have rapidly reassociating components, the <b>insoluble</b> <b>component</b> (DNA-P) is devoid of these components, and is therefore composed completely of unique sequence DNA. Cot 1 / 2 values indicate that DNA-S is substantially depleted of some DNA-P sequences.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To review recent {{evidence}} on dietary {{factors associated with}} diverticular disease (DD) with special emphasis on dietary fibre. QUALITY OF EVIDENCE: MEDLINE was searched from January 1966 to December 2001 for articles {{on the relationship between}} dietary and other lifestyle factors and DD. Most articles either focused on dietary intervention in treating symptomatic DD or were case-control studies with inherent limitations for studying diet-disease associations. Only one large prospective study of male health professionals in the United States assessed diet at baseline and before initial diagnosis of DD. MAIN MESSAGE: A diet high in fibre mainly from fruits and vegetables and low in total fat and red meat decreases risk of DD. Evidence indicates that the <b>insoluble</b> <b>component</b> of fibre is strongly associated with lower risk of DD; this association was particularly strong for cellulose. Caffeine and alcohol do not substantially increase risk of DD, nor does obesity, but higher levels of physical activity seem to reduce risk of DD.

In this study, we have examined the effect of β-catenin mutation (S 37 F) or APC loss on the proteasome sensitivity of additional subcellular β-catenin pools in melanoma cells. In contrast to detergent-soluble β-catenin, the detergent-insoluble protein remains proteasome-sensitive irrespective of S 37 F mutation or APC status. This <b>insoluble</b> <b>component</b> appears associated primarily with nuclear cytoskeletal elements. In addition, DNase I treatment solubilized a portion of detergent-insoluble β-catenin, suggesting that this fraction also contains chromatin-associated protein, and correlating with a proteasome-sensitive elevation in β-catenin-stimulated reporter activity. Since the detergent-insoluble nuclear component of β-catenin displays GSK- 3 β- and APC-independent proteasome sensitivity, distinct from the soluble nuclear and cytosolic pools of this protein, regulation of β-catenin proteasome sensitivity and the contribution of this process to β-catenin function may be more complex than previously appreciated...|$|E

The yield of HB-GAM is increased by 5 - to 10 -fold when 250 mM NaCl {{is added to}} the homogenization buffer, indicating that HB-GAM may exist as a complex with an <b>insoluble</b> <b>component</b> of the tissue. The complete amino acid sequence of the brain-derived HB-GAM was established by automated Edman degradation of the intact protein and chemically or enzymatically derived fragments. The mass of bovine HB-GAM as determined by plasma desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometry is 15, 291 mass units, which compares favorably with the calculated mass of 15, 289 based on the amino acid sequence. Therefore, HB-GAM has not undergone any major post-translational modifications other than cleavage of the signal peptide.

Full-length HB-GAM is not a mitogen for Balb/ 3 T 3 clone A 31, Balb MK, NRK, or human umbilical vein endothelial cells.

This study's main objective was to analyze the dietary fiber in fruit and vegetables IV and V range using specific analytical methodologies. Fruit and vegetable pulps (V range) were used, as well as minimally processed carrot (IV range) subjected to different pre-treatments : heat treatment, UV radiation, ripping and their combinations - followed or not by storage at 5 °C for 7 days. The pulps with pear base proved to be considerably richer in dietary fiber than the apple pulps.

Concerning minimally processed carrot, the immediate effect of applying singular or combined abiotic treatments on total dietary fiber content was not evident. However, the <b>insoluble</b> <b>component</b> increased considerably, probably due to the lignification process. Unlike, the content of soluble fiber registered a large decreased.
