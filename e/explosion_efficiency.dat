40|$|Based on the magnetorotational {{model of}} a {{supernova}} explosion with core collapse, we investigate the significant processes of neutrino heating of the supernova shock.

Moreover, the influence on them of a magnetic field is reduced to insignificant corrections.

40|$|Vapor explosions were {{produced}} by injecting small quantities {{of water into}} a container filled with molten sodium chloride. Minimum <b>explosion</b> <b>efficiencies,</b> as evaluated from reaction-impulse measurements, were relatively large. Subsurface movies showed that the explosions resulted from a two-step sequence: an initial bulk-mixing phase {{in which the two}} liquids intermix on a large scale, but remain locally separated by an insulating gas-vapor layer; and a second step, immediately following breakdown of the gas layer, during which the two liquids locally fragment, intermix, and pressurize very rapidly. The experimental results were compared with various mechanistic models that had been proposed to explain vapor explosions. Early models seemed inconsistent with the results. More recent theories suggest that vapor explosions may be caused by a nucleation limit or by dynamic mixing combined with high surface-heat-transfer rates. Both types of models are consistent with the results...|$|R

40|$|Abridged] One of {{the most}} {{promising}} approaches to clarify the nature of SN Ia progenitors consists in studying the delay time distribution (DTD) between the formation of the progenitor star and its explosion as a SN. We use recent observations of the evolution of the SN Ia rate with redshift, the dependence of the SN Ia rate on the colours of the parent galaxiex, and the enhancement of the SN Ia rate in radio-loud early-type galaxies to derive, {{for the first time on}} robust empirical grounds, the DTD. We find it to be bimodal, in that about 50 % of type Ia SNe (dubbed "prompt" SN Ia) explode soon after their stellar birth, in a time of the order of 10 ^ 8 years, while the remaining 50 % ("tardy" SN Ia) have a much broader distribution, well described by an exponential function with a decay time of about 3 Gyr. It appears that "prompt" SN Ia originate from stellar progenitors more massive than 5. 5 Msun, which have an <b>explosion</b> <b>efficiency</b> about 3 times higher than that of less massive progenitors. The bimodality of the DTD, coupled with the well established systematics in the properties of SN Ia, strongly support the existence of two classes of progenitors. Several theoretical models, based on both single- and double-degenerate schemes, can reproduce the evolution of SN Ia rate with redshift and the dependence on the colors of the hosts, while none can account for the enhancement of the SN Ia rates in radio-loud Ellipticals. Since the two classes of SNe dominate at different redshifts, the confident use of the SN Ia as "standardizable" candles in the local and in the distant universe requires a good understanding of the properties of the two classes...|$|E
40|$|Disruption and {{fragmentation}} of an asteroid using nuclear explosive devices (NEDs) {{is a highly}} complex yet a practical solution to mitigating the impact threat of asteroids with short warning time. A Hypervelocity Asteroid Intercept Vehicle (HAIV) concept, developed at the Asteroid Deflection Research Center (ADRC), consists of a primary vehicle that acts as kinetic impactor and a secondary vehicle that houses NEDs. The kinetic impactor (lead vehicle) strikes the asteroid creating a crater. The secondary vehicle will immediately enter the crater and detonate its nuclear payload creating a blast wave powerful enough to fragment the asteroid. The nuclear subsurface explosion modeling and hydrodynamic simulation has been a challenging research goal that paves the way an array of mission critical information. A mesh-free hydrodynamic simulation method, Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) was utilized to obtain both qualitative and quantitative solutions for <b>explosion</b> <b>efficiency.</b> Commercial fluid dynamics packages such as AUTODYN along with the in-house GPU accelerated SPH algorithms were used to validate and optimize high-energy explosion dynamics {{for a variety of}} test cases. Energy coupling from the NED to the target body was also examined to determine the effectiveness of nuclear subsurface explosions. Success of a disruption mission also depends on the survivability of the nuclear payload when the secondary vehicle approaches the newly formed crater at a velocity of 10 km/s or higher. The vehicle may come into contact with debris ejecting the crater which required the conceptual development of a Whipple shield. As the vehicle closes on the crater, its skin may also experience extreme temperatures due to heat radiated from the crater bottom. In order to address this thermal problem, a simple metallic thermal shield design was implemented utilizing a radiative heat transfer algorithm and nodal solutions obtained from hydrodynamic simulations...|$|E

40|$|The work {{provides}} a cause analysis for major industrial explosions and {{a review of}} the causes of combustive air-gas mixture generation in a production environment. It has been established that during operation of explosive production facilities, it is process equipment that, as a rule, creates explosive environment inside the floor area. A qualitative method for determination of a potential accident has been reviewed. Analysis of the nature of explosion effect on building structures and equipment has shown that exposions characterised by absence of equipment and building structure disintegration normally have a localized character. It has been identified that during explosions inside process equipment, the largest structural damage occurs in spots hit by equipment debris. Complete destruction of building structures and equipment is caused by explosions inside equipment containing large quantities of combustible products. It has been identified that most explosions are accompanied by partial or total destruction of building structures and equipment. Therefore, measures taken to protect equipment and buildings from <b>explosion</b> effects lack <b>efficiency...</b>|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{extended}} component importance measures (Birnbaum importance, RAW, RRW and Crit- icality importance) considering aleatory and epistemic uncertainties are introduced. The D-S theory {{which is}} considered to be a less restricted extension of probability theory is proposed as a framework for taking into account both aleatory and epistemic uncertainties. The epistemic uncertainty defined in this paper is the total lack of knowledge of the component state. The objective is to translate this epistemic uncertainty to the epistemic uncertainty of system state and to the epistemic uncertainty of importance measures of components. The Affine Arithmetic allows us to provide much tighter bounds in the computing process of interval bounds of importance measures avoiding the error <b>explosion</b> problem. The <b>efficiency</b> of the proposed measures is demonstrated using a bridge system with different types of reliability data (aleatory uncertainty, epistemic uncertainty and experts' judgments). The influence of the epistemic uncertainty on the components' rankings is described. Finally, a case study of a fire-detector system located in a production room is provided. A comparison between the proposed measures and the probabilistic importance measures using two-stage Monte Carlo simulations is also made...|$|R

Schieber, Dave Heller, Nicole Moodie; Rockhurst University, Kansas City, Missouri e-mail: SchieberM@hawks. rockhurst. edu Accelerometers are a {{tool that}} can be used to objectively measure frequency, duration, and {{intensity}} of a physical activity and exercise. An easily accessible tool such as an accelerometer could be beneficial to a widespread range of athletes. PURPOSE: This aim of the present study was to test the reliability of designated G-force measures obtained by a commercial accelerometer. METHODS: Fourteen competitive athletes (10 male, 4 female) volunteered to attend one anaerobic testing session. At the beginning of the session athletes completed a required warm-up consisting of a 5 minute jog, stretching of major muscle groups, and two progressive 50 yard sprints. After the warm-up the accelerometer was placed on the athletes’ back between the shoulder blades and anchored at two points with adhesive. Athletes then completed two 40 yard dashes with a 5 minute rest interval between trials. RESULTS: Data from the accelerometer unit was analyzed using software created by the unit developer. Based on the G-forces recorded by the accelerometer unit, the software created <b>explosion,</b> right-left symmetry, <b>efficiency,</b> and propulsion scores. Paired samples t-tests determined no significant differences between trial 1 -trial 2 scores for explosion [t(13) = 0. 186, p 3 ̆c 0. 05], right-left symmetry t(13) = 0. 181, p 3 ̆c 0. 05], efficiency [t(13) =- 1. 984, p 3 ̆c 0. 05], and propulsion [t(13) =- 1. 969, p 3 ̆c 0. 05].

40|$|Maar-diatreme volcanoes {{in their}} {{simplest}} form {{are thought to}} result primarily from discrete, subsurface phreatomagmatic explosions. Tephra ring deposits around maar craters are commonly interpreted {{in terms of a}} framework wherein explosions begin at shallow levels and migrate downward, ejecting progressively deeper-seated lithic clasts that contribute to the tephra rings. Additionally, variations in grain size of the deposits are sometimes inferred to record different degrees of fragmentation, which are in turn related to variations in magma-water ratios at the explosion sites. Recent detailed studies of diatremes and of maar tephra rings suggest a different conceptual model wherein explosions can happen at various vertical and lateral locations within a diatreme during its eruptive lifetime, rather than being limited to simple downward migration. Experiments, numerical modeling, and field data indicate that most explosions deeper than about 200 - 250. m will not vent to the surface, but instead contribute to mixing within the diatremes. Arrival of deep-seated lithics at the surface is related to this mixing process. Experiments also indicate that explosion phenomena can result in a range of emplacement mechanisms and grain sizes in tephra rings, {{even in the absence of}} variations in <b>explosion</b> mechanisms (fragmentation <b>efficiency).</b> Here we document the tephra ring of Stracciacappa maar (central Italy), and interpret its eruption and emplacement history in terms of evolving conceptual models along with a comparison to more traditional interpretations. Because most elements of both conceptual models are viable, the work points to an important need to develop criteria to distinguish between the various inferred mechanisms...|$|R
