500|$|The main cast {{includes}} Eddie Cibrian, who {{was cast}} as Nick Dalton, the central {{character in the}} series. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Cibrian stated that Dalton was a [...] "chameleon" [...] and very charismatic. He continued: [...] "On the facade, {{he seems to have}} it all. He's very successful. He's dating the head Playboy bunny. He's one of the first keyholders at the Playboy Club, but he has a very mysterious past." [...] Jeff Hephner was originally approached for the role after performing well in test auditions, but Hephner had no prior experience playing a television lead before, and the producers decided to let him go after the full cast table. Cibrian was cast just a few days before filming began. Amber Heard was approached by producers of the show to portray Bunny Maureen. Although the series premiere started with Nick helping Maureen out of a difficult situation, Heard said of the character, [...] "Don't underestimate that character and her intelligence, and the journey that she's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>to</b> really rise above that. [...] I think Maureen allows herself to be helped when she needs it, and by no means relies on any character, male or female, in this story, and never has." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I know, Dad! Sure! All right. I'll {{stick to}} it. Say! Gosh! Gee whiz! I {{forgot all about}} those kids I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>to</b> the chorus rehearsal. I'll have to duck!" ...|$|E
6000|$|This {{was what}} suited Francie, {{but she was}} {{nevertheless}} struck by Delia's rigour. [...] "I'm only <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> him <b>to</b> see Mr. Waterlow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All right, Old Hoss," [...] he said, cheerily, [...] "make cigar-lighters of it. What's the difference? I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> her <b>to</b> {{lunch at}} Claremont to-day." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "If Comrade Maloney," [...] he said, [...] "is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>to</b> singing during {{business}} hours, I fear {{this journal}} must put up its shutters. Concentrated thought {{will be out}} of the question." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot {{say that}} I have not missed {{him a good}} deal, miss, but, luckily, we have had other things to think about. We are giving up the farm; it is lonesome here in the winter, and I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>to</b> barge life again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is foolish, my dear," [...] {{answered}} Mr. Merrick, affectionately {{patting the}} hand she laid in his. [...] "The doctor says poor Denton cannot recover. If you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>to</b> heart all the sad incidents we encounter on this hospital ship, {{it will not}} only ruin your usefulness but destroy your happiness." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should be}} sorry for that," [...] {{answered}} the Caliph, [...] "and I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> steps <b>to</b> prevent it. Wait here till I return." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> you <b>to</b> headquarters. They would {{dispose of}} you there; but Numa {{can do it}} quite as effectively. Which do you prefer?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> me <b>to</b> the Park," [...] Miss Fancourt {{observed}} to Overt with elation {{as they passed}} along the corridor {{that led to the}} street.|$|R
6000|$|... "What is it? How can {{you have}} the courage to ask such a question, Toribia? Look at the {{confusion}} your pestilent fowls are creating amongst my papers--papers that concern the safety of the republic! Woman, what measures are you <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>to</b> stop this before I have your fowls all killed on the spot?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>to</b> the hills, he muttered," [...] as {{he set off}} {{along the}} track. He ran at a trot, and as he went, loaded both barrels of his gun. [...] "Very likely the villain will show fight," [...] he said to himself; [...] "I must take him by {{surprise}} if I can." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I expect {{we shall}} get some good {{pickings}} along the coast, directly it comes. We have been trading regularly, this last year; {{and we all}} of us want the chance of earning a bit of prize money. So I can tell you, we were very glad when we heard that we were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>to</b> that again, for a bit." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> you <b>to</b> our bungalows," [...] {{announced}} Dave. [...] "There {{you will}} have the pleasure of talking the matter over with Mr. Wadsworth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> him <b>to</b> the Outlook Hotel first," [...] {{answered}} Dick. [...] "But he is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do {{more than}} that, Tom-- if it is possible." ...|$|R
5000|$|On November 12, 1999 Fulani {{formally}} endorsed Buchanan, saying: [...] "We are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> integrate that peasant army of his. We are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> bring black folks, Latino folks, gay {{folks and}} liberal folks into that army...I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> Pat Buchanan <b>to</b> 125th Street in Harlem. We are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have lunch at Sylvia's. I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> him <b>to</b> speak at Reverend Sharpton's National Action Network." [...] Fulani became Buchanan's campaign co-chair.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is dreadful. I {{never saw}} {{anything}} like it. He {{is just for}} all the world like those young men we read of who do all manner of horrible things for love,--smothering themselves and their young women with charcoal, or throwing them into the Regent's Canal. I am constantly afraid of something happening. It was all because of Ayala that he got into that terrible row at the police court,--and then we were afraid he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>to</b> drink. He has given all that up now." ...|$|E
60|$|IT must a {{been close}} on to one o'clock {{when we got}} below the island at last, and the raft did seem to go mighty slow. If a boat was to come along we was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>to</b> the canoe and break for the Illinois shore; and it was well a boat didn't come, for we hadn't ever thought to put the gun in the canoe, or a fishing-line, or {{anything}} to eat. We was in ruther {{too much of a}} sweat to think of so many things. It warn't good judgment to put EVERYTHING on the raft.|$|E
60|$|Roy called twice, {{once in the}} afternoon, {{and again}} during the evening. He grew more likable upon longer acquaintance. This last visit he {{rendered}} Bo speechless by teasing her about another girl Carmichael was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>to</b> a dance. Bo's face showed that her vanity could not believe this statement, but that her intelligence of young men credited it with being possible. Roy evidently was as penetrating as he was kind. He made a dry, casual little remark about the snow never melting on the mountains during {{the latter part of}} March; and the look with which he accompanied this remark brought a blush to Helen's cheek.|$|E
50|$|The girl {{suggests}} <b>going</b> back <b>to</b> George, but Bobby refuses. Bobby {{tells her}} he's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> her <b>to</b> George's {{and leave her}} there while he gets himself together.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come along," [...] Kendricks suggested. [...] "We shan't get a {{table at}} all {{at the place where}} I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> you <b>to</b> dine, unless we are punctual." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Home!" [...] he {{ridiculed}} the notion. [...] "I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> you <b>to</b> {{the prettiest}} road you ever saw--around by French's Lower Falls. I only {{wish it was}} summer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He shouldn't go sending telegrams like this," [...] he said. [...] "You {{might have}} been ill for all I could tell. It spoiled my breakfast!" [...] For though, as a fact, it had not {{prevented}} his completing a hearty meal, he fancied that he felt hungry. [...] "When I was quartered at Halifax there was a fellow who never sent anything but telegrams. Telegraph Jo they called him. He commanded the old Bluebottles. You know the old Bluebottles? If Horace is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>to</b> {{this sort of thing}} he'd better see a specialist; it's almost certain to mean a breakdown. You're up about dresses, I see. When do you come to town? The season's getting on." ...|$|E
6000|$|Sir James was {{informed}} that same night that Dorothea was really quite set against marrying anybody at all, and was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>to</b> [...] "all sorts of plans," [...] just like what she used to have. Sir James made no remark. To his secret feeling there was something repulsive in a woman's second marriage, and no match would prevent him from feeling it a sort of desecration for Dorothea. He was aware {{that the world would}} regard such a sentiment as preposterous, especially in relation to a woman of one-and-twenty; the practice of [...] "the world" [...] being to treat of a young widow's second marriage as certain and probably near, and to smile with meaning if the widow acts accordingly. But if Dorothea did choose to espouse her solitude, he felt that the resolution would well become her.|$|E
60|$|When, afterward, public {{sentiment}} seemed inclined to condemn this terrible and inexcusable massacre, Richard defended himself {{by saying that}} he found on board the vessel a number of jars containing certain poisonous reptiles, which he alleged the Saracens were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>to</b> Acre, and there let them loose near the Crusaders' camp to bite the soldiers, and that men who could resort to so barbarous a mode of warfare as this deserved no quarter. However this may be, the poor Saracens received no quarter. It might be supposed that Richard deserved some credit for his humanity in saving the thirty-five. But his object in saving these was not to show mercy, but to gain ransom-money. These thirty-five were the emirs, or other officers of the Saracens, or persons who {{looked as if they}} might be rich or have rich friends. When they reached the shore, Richard fixed upon a certain sum of money for each of them, and allowed them to send word to their friends that if they would raise that money and send it to Richard, he would set them at liberty. A great proportion of them were thus afterward ransomed, and Richard realized from this source quite a large sum.|$|E
6000|$|Sally {{returned}} to him, {{ready to go}} out. She seemed {{to be afraid of}} him, when he approached her, and took her hand. [...] "Have I done anything wrong?" [...] she asked, in her childish way. [...] "Are you <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> me <b>to</b> some other Home?" [...] The tone and look with which she put the question burst through the restraints which Amelius had imposed on himself for her sake. [...] "My dear child!" [...] he said, [...] "can you bear a great surprise? I'm dying to tell you the truth--and I hardly dare do it." [...] He took her in his arms. She trembled piteously. Instead of answering him, she reiterated her question, [...] "Are you <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> me <b>to</b> some other Home?" [...] He could endure it no longer. [...] "This is the happiest day of your life, Sally!" [...] he cried; [...] "I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> you <b>to</b> your mother." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Elementary, Watson, elementary," [...] replied Bridge. [...] "We are {{captured}} by bandits, {{and they are}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> us <b>to</b> their delightful chief who will doubtless have us shot at sunrise." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bery few," [...] she said. [...] "It am tole only {{to men who}} are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>to</b> de hills, and who can't go farder, 'cause perhaps dey been flogged till dey {{too weak}} to travel many miles. Each man who is tole has to take a great oath dat he suah tell no one except anober slabe running away, or someone who hab to go to take food to him; dat is how I came to know. Jake had been tole when dey knew he going to run away. He tole his broder, my husband, cause he had been flogged so bad he could not go to de mountains. Den my husband tole me, 'cause {{he could not get}} away wid de food. I neber tell anyone till now, cause dere no {{occasion}} for it; slabes treated too well at our plantation to want to run away. But dere am no doubt dat dere am slabes in oder plantations dat know of him, but me no tink dey tell. In de first place dey take big oath, and dey suah to die ef dey break dat; in de next place, because dey no tell dem mulattoes, because some day perhaps dese will be oberseers again, and den de secret of de cave be no longer ob use." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That will be {{a matter}} of course. But, as I was saying--Let me see. Yes,--all that waiting will be {{intolerable}} to me. It is such a bore for a man when he has made up his mind on such a matter as marriage, not to make the change at once, especially when he is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>to</b> himself such a little angel as you are," [...] and as he spoke these loving words, his arm was again put round her waist; [...] "but--" [...] and then he stopped. He wanted to make her understand that this change of intention on his part was caused by the unexpected misconduct of her uncle. He desired that she should know exactly how the matter stood; that he had been led to suppose that her uncle would give her some small fortune, that he had been disappointed, and had a right to feel the disappointment keenly; and that in consequence of this blow to his expectations, he must put off his marriage. But he wished her also to understand {{at the same time that}} this did not in the least mar his love for her; that he did not join her at all in her uncle's fault. All this he was anxious to convey to her, but he did not know how to get it said in a manner that would not be offensive to her personally, and that should not appear to accuse himself of sordid motives. He had begun by declaring that he would tell her all; but sometimes it is not easy, that task of telling a person everything. There are things which will not get themselves told.|$|E
