5|$|Anxiety <b>disorder</b> {{and major}} {{depressive}} <b>disorder</b> {{are the most}} common conditions seen at the same time; comorbidity of these in persons with AS is estimated at 65%. Reports have associated AS with medical conditions such as aminoaciduria and ligamentous laxity, but these have been case reports or small studies and no factors have been associated with AS across studies. One study of males with AS found an increased rate of epilepsy and a high rate (51%) of nonverbal learning <b>disorder.</b> AS is associated with tics, Tourette syndrome, and bipolar <b>disorder,</b> and the repetitive behaviors of AS have many similarities with the symptoms of obsessive–compulsive <b>disorder</b> and obsessive–compulsive personality <b>disorder.</b> However many of these studies are based on clinical samples or lack standardized measures; nonetheless, comorbid conditions are relatively common.|$|E

5|$|If {{signs of}} {{disturbance}} are present {{for more than}} a month but less than six months, the diagnosis of schizophreniform <b>disorder</b> is applied. Psychotic symptoms lasting less than a month may be diagnosed as brief psychotic <b>disorder,</b> and various conditions may be classed as psychotic <b>disorder</b> not otherwise specified, while schizoaffective <b>disorder</b> is diagnosed if symptoms of mood <b>disorder</b> are substantially present alongside psychotic symptoms. If the psychotic symptoms are the direct physiological result of a general medical condition or a substance, then the diagnosis is one of a psychosis secondary to that condition. Schizophrenia is not diagnosed if symptoms of pervasive developmental <b>disorder</b> are present unless prominent delusions or hallucinations are also present.|$|E

She also alleged that Dr. Luke was partly the cause of Kesha's eating <b>disorder,</b> saying that Luke had allegedly told her to lose weight after he signed her, comparing the shape of her body to a refrigerator. Sebert asserted that this had caused Kesha's <b>disorder</b> to worsen. Kesha had completed her treatment on March 6, 2014, after spending two months in rehab.|$|E

Schizophrenia occurs along with obsessive-compulsive <b>disorder</b> (OCD) considerably more often than {{could be explained by}} chance, although {{it can be difficult to}} distinguish obsessions that occur in OCD from the delusions of schizophrenia. A few people withdrawing from benzodiazepines experience a severe withdrawal syndrome which may last a long time. It can resemble schizophrenia and be misdiagnosed as such.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1966 The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the number and type of {{physical}} <b>disorders</b> of two hundred educable mentally retarded students and two hundred normal intelligence students. The relationship of physical <b>disorders</b> to sex and age was also investigated. The descriptive survey method was chosen for the study. Data were collected by use of a tabulation record which listed 20 categories of broad general physical <b>disorders.</b> Each classification was calculated as to frequency in each student group. The sample for the educable mentally retarded group consisted of data obtained from the current physical examination record of 100 male students and 100 female students selected at random from Fairview Hospital and Training Center. There were 32 in the 7 to 12 year age group, 31 in the 13 to 15 year age group and 37 in the 16 to 18 year age group for each sex. The sample for the normal student group consisted of data obtained from the current Oregon Pupil Medical Record of 100 male students and 100 female students selected at random from three schools in the Salem Public School system. There were 32 in the 7 to 12 year age group of each sex, 31 in the 13 to 15 year age group of each sex and 37 io the 16 to 18 year age group of each sex. In agreement with other studies, the incidence of total <b>disorders</b> was higher in subnormals but an analysis of the data revealed the incidence was higher only in certain categories. These were nervous system <b>disorders,</b> musculo-skeIetal <b>disorders,</b> foot <b>disorders,</b> heart <b>disorders,</b> nose and throat <b>disorders,</b> eye <b>disorders,</b> gail <b>disorders,</b> mouth <b>disorders,</b> genital <b>disorders,</b> ear <b>disorders,</b> endocrine <b>disorders</b> and other <b>disorders.</b> In other categories there was no appreciable difference in incidence. These were tooth <b>disorders,</b> vision <b>disorders,</b> nutrition <b>disorders,</b> skin <b>disorders,</b> hearing <b>disorders,</b> lymph node <b>disorders,</b> abdomen <b>disorders</b> and lung <b>disorders.</b> The older age groups of both the educable mentally retarded students and normal students had a higher incidence of tooth, nutrition and skin <b>disorders.</b> The educable mentally retarded 7 to 12 year age male group had a higher incidence of genital <b>disorders.</b> In the remaining categories, no noticable progressive or regressive change was noted. The extent to which preventive and corrective services were available was important in the general incidence.

5|$|Alprazolam is {{effective}} in the relief of moderate to severe anxiety and panic attacks. However, {{it is not a}} first line treatment since the development of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Alprazolam is no longer recommended in Australia for the treatment of panic <b>disorder</b> due to concerns regarding tolerance, dependence, and abuse. Most evidence shows that the benefits of alprazolam in treating panic <b>disorder</b> last only 4 to 10 weeks.

5|$|Alprazolam, {{available}} {{under the}} trade name Xanax, is a potent, short-acting benzodiazepine anxiolytic—a minor tranquilizer. It {{is commonly used}} {{for the treatment of}} anxiety disorders, especially of panic <b>disorder,</b> but also in the treatment of generalized anxiety <b>disorder</b> (GAD) or social anxiety <b>disorder.</b> It was the 12th most prescribed medicine in the United States in 2010. Alprazolam, like other benzodiazepines, binds to specific sites on the GABAA receptor. It possesses anxiolytic, sedative, hypnotic, skeletal muscle relaxant, anticonvulsant, amnestic, and antidepressant properties. Alprazolam is available for oral administration as compressed tablets (CT) and extended-release capsules (XR).|$|E
5|$|Although {{there are}} {{a wide range of}} {{attachment}} difficulties within the styles which may result in emotional disturbance and increase the risk of later psychopathologies, particularly the disorganized style, none of the styles constitute a <b>disorder</b> in themselves and none equate to criteria for RAD as such. A <b>disorder</b> in the clinical sense is a condition requiring treatment, as opposed to risk factors for subsequent disorders. Reactive attachment <b>disorder</b> denotes a lack of typical attachment behaviors rather than an attachment style, however problematic that style may be, in that there is an unusual lack of discrimination between familiar and unfamiliar people in both forms of the <b>disorder.</b> Such discrimination does exist as a feature of the social behavior of children with atypical attachment styles. Both DSM-IV and ICD-10 depict the <b>disorder</b> in terms of socially aberrant behavior in general rather than focusing more specifically on attachment behaviors as such. DSM-IV emphasizes a failure to initiate or respond to social interactions across a range of relationships and ICD-10 similarly focuses on contradictory or ambivalent social responses that extend across social situations. The relationship between patterns of attachment in the Strange Situation and RAD is not yet clear.|$|E
