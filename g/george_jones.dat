5|$|After <b>George</b> <b>Jones</b> died in 1891, Charles Ransom Miller raised $1million {{dollars to}} buy the Times, along with other fellow editors at the newspaper, {{printing}} it under the New York Times Publishing Company. However, the newspaper was financially crippled by the Panic of 1893. By 1896, The New York Times had a circulation of less than 9,000, and was losing $1,000 a day when controlling interest in it was gained by Adolph Ochs, publisher of the Chattanooga Times for $75,000.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the war, the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal <b>George</b> <b>Jones,</b> {{proposed}} {{reducing the}} five extant mainland area commands (North-Western, North-Eastern, Eastern, Southern, and Western Areas) to three. One of these would have been Northern Area, covering Queensland and the Northern Territory. The Australian Government rejected the plan and the wartime area command boundaries essentially remained in place until supplanted in 1953–54 by a functional command-and-control system made up of Home (operational), Training, and Maintenance Commands.|$|E
5000|$|Allmusic's Chris Woodstra writes: <b>George</b> <b>Jones's</b> {{first solo}} outing for Epic in 1972 is a rough concept album built around his own {{optimism}} and joy about {{his marriage to}} Tammy Wynette, even though cracks were already beginning to show in their real-life relationship. Jones' voice sounds mature, settled, and smooth -- a perfect combination with Billy Sherrill's decidedly non-country, slick production style.|$|R
5000|$|Karlie Justus of Engine 145 gave [...] "Ain't Much Left of Lovin' You" [...] a thumbs-up, calling Montana's voice [...] "raspy" [...] and {{comparing}} the song's theme to <b>George</b> <b>Jones's</b> [...] "The Grand Tour." [...] Matt Bjorke of Roughstock rated it three-and-a-half stars out of five, {{saying that the}} song is a [...] "grow-on-you type" [...] but that it [...] "really feels like a genuine and proper introduction." ...|$|R
500|$|Also in 1993, Diffie was {{inducted}} into the Grand Ole Opry.

5|$|In May 1942, the Australian {{government}} appointed Air Vice Marshal <b>George</b> <b>Jones</b> as Chief of the Air Staff. He became {{responsible for}} matters other than operations, such as administration and training.

5|$|The Daily Advertiser, {{published}} Monday to Friday and {{its sister}} publication, the Weekend Advertiser, service Wagga {{and much of}} the surrounding region. The newspaper was established by two wealthy local pastoralists, Auber <b>George</b> <b>Jones</b> and Thomas Darlow and first printed on 10 December 1868 by editor Frank Hutchison, an Oxford graduate. Originally printed bi-weekly, by 1880 it was tri-weekly and finally became 'daily' on 31 December 1910. In 1962 the newspaper reduced in size from a broadsheet to a tabloid format.

5000|$|A Lady Named Smith {{contained}} eleven {{tracks of}} newly recorded material by Connie Smith. The album was recorded at the Columbia Recording Studio in Nashville, Tennessee in 1973. Smith primarily decided {{to switch to}} Columbia in order to record more Gospel material, therefore, Gospel songs were incorporated into her country music studio albums as well. A Lady Named Smith contained three Gospel songs: [...] "Jesus," [...] "Pass Me By (If You're Only Passing Through)," [...] and [...] "Let's All Go Down to the River." [...] The album included a cover version of <b>George</b> <b>Jones's</b> [...] "A Picture of Me (Without You)" [...] and a song co-written by Smith and Richey titled, [...] "You've Got Me (Right Where You Want Me)."

5|$|The Deputy Chief of the Air Staff at the {{outbreak}} of World War II, Bostock was considered a leading candidate for the position of Chief of the Air Staff in 1942 but was passed over in favour of Air Commodore <b>George</b> <b>Jones,</b> a friend of twenty years. Appointed Air Officer Commanding RAAF Command soon after, Bostock became involved in a bitter and long-running dispute with Jones {{over control of the}} Air Force in the South West Pacific. Following his retirement from the RAAF in 1946, he became a journalist and later a Federal Member of Parliament.|$|E
5|$|The ironic {{thing is}} that we grew up {{listening}} to primarily American music {{and fell in love with}} American music. I love country music. I grew up with <b>George</b> <b>Jones</b> and Charley Pride and Jim Reeves. All that stuff was playing in the house. That's what I wanted to seek out. That's what I wanted to play. Carol was into Tammy Wynette. Trev Warner is Kym's dad, and he was the first person to bring bluegrass music to Australia.|$|E
5|$|Walters {{left the}} RAAF on 16May 1962, after {{completing}} his posting at Headquarters Support Command. His pending retirement and succession by Air Vice Marshal Douglas Candy had been announced the previous November. Walters followed horse racing in private life.

His pall bearers included two former CASs, Air Marshals Sir Richard Williams and Sir <b>George</b> <b>Jones,</b> along with Air Vice Marshals Henry Wrigley, Joe Hewitt, Colin Hannah, and Douglas Candy.|$|E
5000|$|Got You on My Mind was {{recorded}} in three separate studio sessions between April 4 and April 11, 1960. This was one of Shepard's first albums not to be recorded {{on the west coast}} in California. Instead, sessions for the album were held at the Bradley Film and Recording Studio in Nashville, Tennessee. Ken Nelson, a renowned west coast country figure, produced Got You on My Mind and was a producer of Shepard's previous sessions on the Capitol label. Background musicians (personnel) for Got You on My Mind consisted of The Nashville A-Team. These musicians played on many Nashville recording sessions during the late 1950s and early 1960s, including many of Shepard's. Songs chosen for the album were a variety of new material and covers of songs by other music artists. Included in the record were cover versions of <b>George</b> <b>Jones's</b> [...] "Waltz of the Angels", Buck Owens' [...] "Under Your Spell Again", and the folk song [...] "Big Midnight Special".|$|R
50|$|Reitan {{created the}} leading role of the Roman Soldier in {{the world premiere of}} <b>George</b> Thaddeus <b>Jones's</b> Easter {{television}} opera Break of Day which was broadcast nationally on ABC on April 3, 1961.

In 1973 he was the soloist in the world premiere of Leroy Ostransky's Songs for Julia with the Seattle Symphony under conductor Milton Katim.|$|R
5000|$|Sometimes a Memory Ain't Enough {{was another}} Top 10 album for Lewis, peaking at number 6 on the Billboard country albums chart. Lewis gives {{committed}} performances, although producer Stan Kesler's growing penchant of sweetening the sound with strings and backing vocalists diluted {{some of the}} harder edges that were evident on Jerry Lee's earlier country albums like Another Place, Another Time and Touching Home. It kept Lewis competitive on the radio, however, and the Stan Kesler-penned title track rose to number 6. Although Lewis had released the rocking The Session...Recorded in London with Great Artists earlier in the year, one listen to his new LP revealed {{that he had not}} turned his back on his country audience. He gives a moving performance on <b>George</b> <b>Jones's</b> [...] "What My Woman Can't Do" [...] and covers fellow pianist Leon Russell's lonely lament [...] "My Cricket and Me." [...] The rollicking [...] "I'm Left, You're Right, She's Gone" [...] was released as a second single and but did not crack the Top 20.|$|R
5|$|When Air Chief Marshal Burnett {{completed}} his term in 1942, Williams was once more {{considered for the}} role of CAS. This was vetoed by Prime Minister John Curtin and the appointment unexpectedly went to acting Air Commodore <b>George</b> <b>Jones.</b> A mooted Inspector Generalship of the Air Force, which would have seen Williams reporting directly to the Minister for Air, also failed to materialise. Instead Williams was posted to Washington, D.C. as the RAAF's representative to the Combined Chiefs of Staff in the United States, and remained there {{until the end of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|Air Chief Marshal Burnett had {{recommended}} his deputy, Air Vice Marshal William Bostock, for CAS but in May 1942 the position went to acting Air Commodore <b>George</b> <b>Jones.</b> Bostock in turn became Air Officer Commanding RAAF Command, Australia's main operational organisation under SWPA. An ongoing conflict between Jones (now promoted air vice marshal) and Bostock led to moves in April 1943 {{to bring in}} an officer senior to both men to head the RAAF in a unified command structure, and Drummond was once more approached by the Australian Government. Drummond had indicated that {{he was happy to}} serve in Australia but the Air Ministry again refused to release him, having selected him for a posting to the Air Council as Air Member for Training.|$|E
5|$|Air Vice Marshal Joseph Eric (Joe) Hewitt, CBE (13 April 1901– 1November 1985) was {{a senior}} {{commander}} in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). A Royal Australian Navy officer who transferred permanently to the Air Force in 1928, he commanded No.101 (Fleet Cooperation) Flight in the early 1930s, and No.104 (Bomber) Squadron RAF on exchange in Britain shortly before World WarII. Appointed the RAAF's Assistant Chief of the Air Staff in 1941, Hewitt was posted the following year to Allied Air Forces Headquarters, South West Pacific Area, as Director of Intelligence. In 1943, he took command of No.9 Operational Group, the RAAF's main mobile strike force, but was controversially sacked by the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal <b>George</b> <b>Jones,</b> {{less than a year}} later over alleged morale and disciplinary issues.|$|E
500|$|Jones {{was married}} on October 16, 1749, to Margaret Strother Morton (1726–1822), {{the widow of}} George Morton and the {{daughter}} of William Strother and his wife Margaret Watts of King <b>George</b> County. <b>Jones's</b> wife lived to be 97, and was described by Waddell in his Annals of Augusta County, Virginia as [...] "a lady of eminent Christian character". Jones and his wife Margaret had three daughters, one son, and a child of unknown sex that died in infancy: Margaret Morton Jones Harvie, married to lawyer Colonel John Harvie of Albemarle County; Elizabeth Jones Lewis, married to merchant John Lewis of Fredericksburg (son of Fielding Lewis and his first wife Catharine Washington); Anna Gabriella Jones Hawkins, married to John Hawkins of Kentucky; and William Strother Jones (born March 21, 1756), married to Fanny Thornton of Fredericksburg.|$|R
5|$|Bostock {{married his}} Australian fiancée, Gwendolen Norton, in Southampton on 6March 1919. The couple had two daughters, one of whom, Gwendolen Joan, {{would serve as}} a cipher officer in the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force (WAAAF) during World War II. Bostock retired from the RAF and {{returned}} to civilian life in Australia that October. In September 1921, he joined the recently formed Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) and was commissioned a flying officer. He became a friend and mentor to Flying Officer (later Air Marshal Sir) <b>George</b> <b>Jones,</b> another World War I veteran, who had flown with the Australian Flying Corps and had joined the Air Force in March. By mid-1922 Bostock had been promoted to flight lieutenant.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, PCL Manager of the Year Steve Scarsone led the Sounds to a league-best 83–59 {{record and}} the American Conference Southern Division title, sending the team to the postseason {{for the first time}} since 2007. The Sounds lost the American Conference series versus the Oklahoma City Dodgers, three games to two, {{including}} a dramatic back-and-forth game seven. At First Tennessee Park, the Sounds added the Country Legends Race, similar to major league mascot races, such as the Sausage Race and Presidents Race, to its between-innings entertainment in 2016. In the middle of the fifth inning, people in oversized foam caricature costumes depicting country musicians Johnny Cash, <b>George</b> <b>Jones,</b> and Reba McEntire race around the warning track from center field, through the visiting bullpen, and to the home plate side of the first base dugout.|$|E
