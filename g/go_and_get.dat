25|$|The tackle is {{complete}} when the ball-carrier {{is brought to}} the ground; this is judged {{to be the case}} as soon as a knee touches the ground while being held by the opposition. The tackler is designated as any player that also goes to ground when making the tackle. If no player goes to ground when tackling a player, then there is no tackler. The tackler has to immediately let the tackled player <b>go</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> to their feet before attempting to compete for the ball. If they do not get to their feet, they must roll away from the tackled player. The player that is tackled must immediately play the ball by pushing, passing or placing it in any direction. If a player is involved in the tackle, but does not go to ground, they must also release the tackled player, allowing them the chance to play the ball. Only players on their feet, and supporting their own weight, may pick up the ball and any players on the ground must not prevent them from gaining possession. Except for the tackler (player who went to ground when making the tackle) and the tackled player, all other players must enter the tackle area from behind the ball. The tackle must not be dangerous. Dangerous tackles are ones that make contact with their opponent around their neck or head, with a locked elbow and extended arm ("stiff arm"), without using their arms ("shoulder charge"), when they are in the air, when they don't have the ball, or ones that drive or drop a players head or neck into the ground while their feet are in the air ("spear tackle"). Using a foot to trip a player is also illegal.|$|E

500|$|After the Beatles' {{return to}} London, George Harrison replied to a {{question}} about their long-term plans: [...] "We'll take a couple of weeks to recuperate before we <b>go</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> beaten up by the Americans."

A public apology eased tensions, but a miserable US tour in August that was marked by half-filled stadiums and subpar performances proved to be their last.

500|$|Author Mark Hertsgaard has {{commented that}} [...] "many of the song's lyrics do seem {{directed}} more at {{a grown man}} {{on the verge of}} a powerful new love, especially the lines 'you have found her now <b>go</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> her' and 'you're waiting for someone to perform with.'" [...] Music critic and author Tim Riley writes: [...] "If the song is about self-worth and self-consolation in the face of hardship, the vocal performance itself conveys much of the journey. He begins by singing to comfort someone else, finds himself weighing his own feelings in the process, and finally, in the repeated refrains that nurture his own approbation, he comes to believe in himself." ...|$|E

[...] as [...] "a pretty song, with a sinister monologue {{over the top of}} it"; Greenwood likened its lyrics to a Grimms' fairy tale.

500|$|... "Battlefield" [...] is a mid-tempo pop and R ballad. It also {{derives from}} the genres of pop rock and soft rock. The {{instrumentation}} of [...] "Battlefield" [...] consists of a bass, piano, drums, percussion and guitar. [...] "Battlefield" [...] is set in common time with a moderate tempo of 144 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of G major with Sparks' vocal range spanning from the note of A3 to C6. The song's lyrics revolve around [...] "a tumultuous relationship where neither side wants to compromise", as stated by Jocelyn Vena of MTV News. Nick Levine of Digital Spy noted that [...] "Battlefield" [...] {{is based on the}} [...] "love is war" [...] metaphor. During the chorus, Sparks sings: [...] "I never meant to start a war / You know, I never wanna hurt you / Don't even know what we're fighting for / Why does love always feel like a battlefield, a battlefield, a battlefield." [...] Its bridge features the line: [...] "I guess you'd better <b>go</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> your armour".|$|E

[...] or [...] "I have a problem, I will <b>go</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> a grant to cope with it!" [...] "I am homeless, the Government must house me!" [...] and so they are casting their problems on society and who is society? There is no such thing! There are individual men and women and there are families and no government can do anything except through people and people look to themselves first. It is our duty to look after ourselves and then also to help look after our neighbour and life is a reciprocal business and people have got the entitlements too much in mind without the obligations.|$|E
500|$|... "Triumphant (Get 'Em)" [...] is a midtempo R and hip hop ballad that [...] "mixes a soft {{beat with}} piano accompaniment." [...] Written during a {{difficult}} time in Carey's personal life, the song boasts inspirational lyrics of self-worth and achievement. The song begins with an introductory verse from Mill, followed by Ross on the second verse. Though [...] "cooing" [...] throughout the chorus, Carey's begins singing during the song's bridge and final crescendo, where she displays her whistle register. The track opens with Mill, whose verse quickly sums up {{the theme of the}} track: [...] "The only way {{to make it to the}} top is if you <b>go</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> it from the bottom ... I remember they said that it ain't my turn/ Just look at me now/ Try to hold me down, but I ain't gonna stop/ 'Cause I'm gonna climb to the mountaintop." [...] During the song's chorus, Carey sings of not being able to be torn down by others and [...] "staying triumphant", before continuing: [...] "Don't let 'em ever count you out/ Realize all things are possible/ In your heart who's the greatest/ Reach for the stars/ Be all that you are." ...|$|E

500|$|In November 2008, he {{was again}} sent out on loan, {{this time to}} Bournemouth, also in League Two, for one month. Simpson said: [...] "We have a big squad and I felt that the {{opportunity}} for Michael to <b>go</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> a month out on loan at Bournemouth would do him the world of good." [...] Symes made his debut for Bournemouth on 15 November, as they lost 3–0 to Accrington Stanley. He returned to Shrewsbury {{at the end of}} his month loan spell, in which he failed to score from five appearances. He was immediately recalled to the Shrewsbury squad and came on as a second-half substitute in a 1–0 defeat to league leaders Wycombe Wanderers the following weekend. Because of injury problems, Symes played only three more games, before he moved on loan, this time to Accrington Stanley, another League Two side. He made his Accrington debut the day following his transfer, helping them to a 2–1 victory at home to Exeter City. Symes scored with a headed goal to give Accrington a 1–0 victory against Grimsby Town, which proved to be the only goal he recorded in seven games for Accrington, before he returned to Shrewsbury Town at the end of the season. However, he was one of seven players released by Simpson after they lost the play-off final.|$|E

[...] Johnny Dee of Virgin Media wrote {{that it was}} one of the song's [...] "you cannot help but reach for any available nearby hairbrush and sing along to", despite calling the bridge a [...] "clunking pedestrian pace and corny advice". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine stated that [...] "Battlefield" [...] is as catchy as [...] "Halo" [...] and Leona Lewis' [...] "Bleeding Love" [...] (2007), and noted that the song's production was similar to Pat Benatar's [...] "We Belong" [...] (1984). This was echoed by Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian, who wrote that [...] "there's an inner Pat Benatar struggling to get out." [...] Nate Chinen of The New York Times stated that on [...] "Battlefield", Sparks' [...] "sounds vexed but in control, and undaunted by the copyright interests of Pat Benatar, who preferred her battlefield metaphors in declarative form", referring to Benatar's [...] "Love Is a Battlefield" [...] (1983). Joanna Hunkin of The New Zealand Herald noted that the song's lyrics were similar to Benatar's [...] "Love Is a Battlefield", and criticized Sparks for plagiarism and not crediting Benatar as an inspiration.|$|E

Another figure who had a powerful impact on Hanson's philosophy was the Indian poet and musician Rabindranath Tagore. Hanson's deep spirituality (he once considered becoming a missionary to India) played a notable part in his creative outlook. His appreciation of jazz is apparent in the sense of spontaneity and rhythmic fluidity that he strove to bring to his own pieces. He had a gift for improvisation and often composed directly at the keyboard.|$|E
