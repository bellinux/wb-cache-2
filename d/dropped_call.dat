40|$|Abstract — Of the {{numerous}} performance metrics applied to cellular telephone systems, probably none {{is more important}} for customer satisfaction than the system <b>drop</b> <b>call</b> rate. Customers are more sensitive to <b>call</b> <b>dropping</b> than to <b>call</b> blocking at initiation. Proper system design and operation involve keeping the <b>drop</b> <b>call</b> rate as low as possible. Call/packet dropping refers to the event described as the termination of calls in progress before either involved party intentionally ends the call. There are numerous <b>drop</b> <b>call</b> causes in cellular networks with majority of them occurring in the Um interfaces mainly {{due to lack of}} radio resources created by electromagnetic causes and user mobility (i. e. handover). Another important contributor of <b>drop</b> <b>call</b> rate is the traffic load in which, the call arrival rate and holding time play significant roles. <b>Drop</b> <b>call</b> probability is defined as the probability that a call is terminated due to one or all of the above-mentioned causes and is basically estimated from <b>drop</b> <b>call</b> rate by applying the Poisson probability distribution function. Dropcall probability {{has been the subject of}} several network performance studies and a major contributor to service optimization in established cellular networks. In this paper, we present an overview of drop-call probability factors in cellular networks. Moreover, some of the factors have been analyzed to study the trends in relation to an operative GSM network and the results are discussed. Index Terms — <b>drop</b> <b>call</b> probability, holding time, packet dropping, quality of service (QoS), traffic load. ...|$|R

Measuring the quality of calls for service WCDMA system can be done by looking at some network Quality of Service parameters. Low QoS value is caused by some disturbance that occurred on the network, one that is <b>drop</b> <b>call.</b> Analysis of the <b>drop</b> <b>call</b> can be done through observation of statistical data. In addition, to find out the actual situation of liver location <b>drop</b> <b>call</b> can be made through the analysis of drive test data.

50|$|Optimization is an {{important}} step in the life cycle of a wireless network. Drive testing {{is the first step in}} the process, with the goal of collecting measurement data as a function of location. Once the data has been collected over the desired RF coverage area, it is output to post-processing software. Engineers can use the collection and post-processing software to identify the causes of RF coverage or interference problems and determine how these problems can be solved. When the problems, causes and solutions have been identified, steps are performed to solve the problems. Network statistics are also {{an important}} step in analysis and troubleshooting of RF issues. Every node (BTS, BSC, MSC) has its own counters some of which are incremented/decremented on occurrence of different events e.g. a <b>dropped</b> <b>call</b> due to low signal strength.

40|$|Cellular {{technologies}} {{have become increasingly}} important in the developing world; infrastructure for mobile networks has expanded dramatically {{over the past two}} decades giving access to remote areas without previous phone service. Despite this expansion, relatively little is known about the correlates of the rollout of cellular phone networks or the performance of these networks. Since the rollout of cellular networks has been largely spearheaded by an active private sector in telecommunications, how demand-side and cost-side factors affect the timing of rollout and quality of network service is of particular interest. In this paper we use new data to estimate the correlates of cellular phone access and network performance across rural areas of Malawi. We compile a dataset which combines administrative data of the entire cellular network of Malawi with geographic and Census data to describe the rollout and the performance of the cellular network measured by the <b>dropped</b> <b>call</b> rate. We find that both demand-side and cost-side factors are important in determining the timing of network access, while demand-side factors appear most relevant for the <b>dropped</b> <b>call</b> rate, one metric of network quality. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of GSM network {{is measured in}} terms of KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) based on statistics generated from the network.
