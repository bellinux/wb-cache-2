50|$|Cement boards {{should not}} be {{confused}} with <b>gypsum</b> <b>core</b> backer boards. <b>Gypsum</b> <b>core</b> backer boards are affected by water and {{should not be}} used on wet exposure areas.|$|E
5000|$|Gypsum [...] "Firecode C". This {{board is}} similar in {{composition}} to Type X, except for more glass fibres and a form of vermiculite, used to reduce shrinkage. When exposed to high heat, the <b>gypsum</b> <b>core</b> shrinks but this additive expands {{at about the same}} rate, so the <b>gypsum</b> <b>core</b> is more stable in a fire, and remains in place even after the gypsum dries up.|$|E
5000|$|Typically water {{resistant}} cement board {{is composed of}} a treated <b>gypsum</b> <b>core</b> with a non organic fiber reinforced covering, either on one or both faces. This type of board requires fastidious sealing of all cut edges and penetrations to maintain the manufacturer's warranty for wet area installations. <b>Gypsum</b> <b>core</b> [...] "cement" [...] board panels are ideal for moist but not truly wet installations of tile and/or stone walls.|$|E
500|$|The queen's pyramid {{originally}} stood [...] {{high with}} a slope of 52°, {{similar to that}} of Userkaf's, with a base [...] long. The core of the pyramid was built with the same technique as the main pyramid and the cult pyramid, consisting of three horizontal layers of roughly hewn local limestone blocks and <b>gypsum</b> mortar. The <b>core</b> was undoubtedly covered with a fine Tura limestone outer casing, now removed. In fact, the pyramid was so extensively used as a stone quarry in later times that it is now barely distinguishable from the surroundings and its internal chambers are exposed.|$|R
50|$|The British {{building}} industry was initially slow {{to adopt the}} new product. Helped by a more modern plant, purchased in 1927, sales gradually increased and by 1932 the Company was able to float on the London Stock Exchange.The additional capital enabled BPB {{to build a new}} factory at Erith in 1934. The Erith plant had the capacity to manufacture the <b>gypsum</b> plaster (the <b>core</b> of the plasterboard product) and BPB began importing gypsum rock from Canada. This encouraged negotiations with other gypsum companies in Britain and a “breath-taking series of take-overs” followed in the next two years, making BPB the dominant force in the industry. In particular, these included the Gotham Company with plaster works in the north of England, and The Gypsum Mines Limited, with its large gypsum mine at Mountfield Sussex.|$|R
50|$|Type C gypsum panels provide {{even greater}} fire {{resistance}} than Type X. As with the Type X panels, {{the core of}} the Type C panels contains glass fibers, only in a much higher percent by weight. In addition to the greater amount of glass fiber, {{the core of the}} Type C panels also contains vermiculite, which acts as a shrinkage-compensating additive that expands when exposed to elevated temperatures of a fire. This expansion occurs at roughly the same temperature as the calcination of the <b>gypsum</b> in the <b>core.</b> It allows the core of the Type C panels to remain dimensionally stable in the presence of fire, which in turn allows the panels to remain in place {{for a longer period of}} time even after the combined water has been driven off.|$|R
50|$|Prior to 1912, {{gypsum board}} was {{manufactured}} {{with an open}} edge, leaving the <b>gypsum</b> <b>core</b> exposed on all four sides. In 1912, United States Gypsum acquired a patent covering both process and product claims on gypsum board with closed edges, the paper liner being folded over the exposed <b>gypsum</b> <b>core.</b> Closed-edge board was superior in quality to open-edge board, as it was cheaper to manufacture, did not break so easily in shipment, and was less subject to crumbling at the edges when nailed in place. Subsequently, United States Gypsum acquired {{a number of other}} patents relating to the process of making closed-edge board.|$|E
5000|$|There is a {{class of}} cement board {{strictly}} constructed of a Portland cement based core with glass fiber mat reinforcing at both faces. These panels can be immersed in water without any degradation (excluding freeze thaw cycles). These panels do not require the sealing of edges and penetrations to maintain their structural integrity. These Portland cement based products are smaller in size compared with the <b>gypsum</b> <b>core</b> based products. Typically they {{range in size from}} 30" [...] x 48" [...] to 36" [...] x 60". They are, as one would expect, considerably heavier than the <b>gypsum</b> <b>core</b> type panels.|$|E
50|$|Gypsum waste {{primarily}} {{consists of}} waste from gypsum boards. A gypsum board is {{a wall or}} ceiling panel made of a <b>gypsum</b> <b>core</b> with paper lining around it. Such boards are {{also referred to as}} plasterboards, drywall, wallboards and gyprock. Gypsum waste main also in some countries consist of gypsum blocks and plaster, among others.|$|E
40|$|Drying is an {{important}} unit operation in process industry. Results {{have suggested that the}} energy used for drying has increased from 12 % in 1978 to 18 % of the total energy used in 1990. A literature survey of previous studies regarding overall drying energy consumption has demonstrated that there is little continuity of methods and energy trends could not be established. In the ceramics, timber and paper industrial sectors specific energy consumption and energy trends have been investigated by auditing drying equipment. Ceramic products examined have included tableware, tiles, sanitaryware, electrical ceramics, plasterboard, refractories, bricks and abrasives. Data from industry has shown that drying energy has not varied significantly in the ceramics sector over the last decade, representing about 31 % of the total energy consumed. Information from the timber industry has established that radical changes have occurred over the last 20 years, both in terms of equipment and energy utilisation. The energy efficiency of hardwood drying has improved by 15 % since the 1970 s, although no significant savings have been realised for softwood. A survey estimating the energy efficiency and operating characteristics of 192 paper dryer sections has been conducted. Drying energy was found to increase to nearly 60 % of the total energy used in the early 1980 s, but has fallen over the last decade, representing 23 % of the total in 1993. These results have demonstrated that effective energy saving measures, such as improved pressing and heat recovery, have been successfully implemented since the 1970 s. Artificial neural networks have successfully been applied to model process characteristics of microwave and convective drying of paper coated gypsum cove. Parameters modelled have included product moisture loss, <b>core</b> <b>gypsum</b> temperature and quality factors relating to paper burning and bubbling defects. Evaluation of thermal and dielectric properties have highlighted gypsum's heat sensitive characteristics in convective and electromagnetic regimes. Modelling experimental data has shown that the networks were capable of simulating drying process characteristics to a high degree of accuracy. Product weight and temperature were predicted to within 0. 5 % and 5 C of the target data respectively. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the underlying properties of the data could be predicted through a high level of input noise...|$|R
50|$|Drywall's paper facings are edible to termites, {{which can}} eat the paper {{if they are}} infesting a wall cavity that is covered with drywall. This causes the painted surface to crumble to the touch, its paper backing {{material}} having been eaten. In addition to the necessity of patching the damaged surface and repainting, if enough of the paper has been eaten, the <b>gypsum</b> <b>core</b> can easily crack or crumble without it and the drywall must be removed and replaced.|$|E
50|$|Drywall {{is highly}} {{vulnerable}} to moisture {{due to the}} inherent properties of the materials that comprise it: gypsum, paper, and organic additives and binders. Gypsum will soften with exposure to moisture, and eventually turn to a gooey paste with prolonged immersion, such as during a flood. During such incidents, {{some or all of}} the drywall in an entire building may need to be removed and replaced. Furthermore, the paper facings and organic additives mixed with the <b>gypsum</b> <b>core</b> are food for mold.|$|E
50|$|As a tile backing board, {{cement board}} has better {{long-term}} performance than paper-faced <b>gypsum</b> <b>core</b> products {{because it will}} not mildew or physically break down in the continued presence of moisture or leaks. Cement board is not actually waterproof, but it is highly resistant to absorbing moisture and has excellent drying properties. In areas continually exposed to water spray (i.e. showers) a waterproofing barrier is usually recommended behind the boards or as a trowel-applied product to {{the face of the}} boards behind the finish system.|$|E
50|$|Gypsum waste can {{be turned}} into {{recycled}} gypsum by processing the gypsum waste {{in such a way that}} the contaminants are removed and the paper facing of the plasterboard is separated from the <b>gypsum</b> <b>core</b> through mechanical processes including grinding and sieving in specialised equipment. Gypsum waste such as gypsum blocks and plaster do not require the removal of paper, as they are not made with paper from the beginning.It is typical for the gypsum recyclers to accept up to 3 per cent of contamination from other materials. The professional recyclers are capable of handling gypsum waste with nails and screws, wall coverings etc.|$|E
50|$|Drywall is made {{primarily}} from gypsum (CaSO4•2H2O). As its chemical formula shows, gypsum contains chemically combined water (approximately 50% by volume). When gypsum panels {{are exposed to}} fire, heat is absorbed as {{a portion of the}} combined water is driven off as steam. This chemical process is called calcination. The thermal energy that converts the water to steam is thus diverted and absorbed, keeping {{the opposite side of the}} gypsum panels cool as long as there is crystalline water left to be converted into steam or until the gypsum panel is breached. In the case of regular gypsum board, as the crystalline water is driven off, the reduction of volume within the <b>gypsum</b> <b>core</b> causes large cracks to form, eventually causing the panel to fail due to loss of structural integrity. This is similar to the cracking that can be observed in a dry lake or river bed.|$|E
40|$|Fire safety {{design is}} {{important}} to eliminate the loss of property and lives during fire events. Gypsum plasterboard is widely used as a fire safety material in the building industry all over the world. It contains gypsum (CaSO 4. 2 H 2 O) and Calcium Carbonate (CaCO 3) and most importantly free and chemically bound water in its crystal structure. The dehydration of the gypsum and the decomposition of Calcium Carbonate absorb heat, which gives the gypsum plasterboard fire resistant qualities. Currently plasterboard manufacturers use additives such as vermiculite to overcome shrinkage of <b>gypsum</b> <b>core</b> and glass fibre to bridge shrinkage cracks and enhance the integrity of board during calcination and after the loss of paper facings in fires. Past research has also attempted to reduce the thermal conductivity of plasterboards using fillers. However, no research has been undertaken to enhance the specific heat of plasterboard and the points of dehydration using chemical additives and fillers. Hence detailed experimental studies of powdered samples of plasterboard mixed with chemical additives and fillers in varying proportions were conducted. These tests showed the enhancement of specific heat of plasterboard. Numerical models were also developed to investigate the thermal performance of enhanced plasterboards under standard fire conditions. The {{results showed that the}} use of these enhanced plasterboards in steel wall systems can significantly improve their fire performance. This paper presents the details of this research and the results {{that can be used to}} enhance the fire safety of steel wall systems commonly used in buildings...|$|E
