50|$|The {{common octopus}} is a poikilothermic, <b>eurythermic</b> ectotherm, {{meaning that it}} {{conforms}} to the ambient temperature. This implies {{that there is no}} real temperature gradient between the organism and its environment, the two are quickly equalized. If the octopus swims to a warmer locale, it will gain heat from the surrounding water, and if it swims to colder surroundings it will lose heat in a similar fashion.|$|E
50|$|Its natural {{habitats}} are rivers, swamps, freshwater lakes and marshes, temporary pools, floodplains and inland deltas. It can inhabit fairly cool (for its tropical range) water, with {{a temperature of}} 18 - 24 C, {{but of course it}} must be very <b>eurythermic</b> as the small pools and puddles it usually inhabits will heat up rapidly during the day and cool down just as rapidly in the night. The pH in its habitat has been measured at 8.2 (somewhat alkaline) and the water hardness at 6° dH (rather soft), but this may not be indicative of its preferences and tolerance as very little data exists. A small carnivore, it feeds on aquatic invertebrates, mainly insect larvae and crustaceans. Like its relatives it is semelparous and spawns in the dry season. The eggs are deposited in the substrate, and the parents then die, as the small waterbodies which they inhabit would mostly dry up anyway. The eggs are adapted to surviving the drying-up in diapause, and can even be entirely outside the water for a time, as long as the substrate is still moist. They hatch after 3-5 months.|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} we studied the {{bacterial}} community obtained from water samples collected in Kandalaksha Bay (White Sea), Russia {{in order to}} obtain information both at the ecological level and for possible future application in biotechnology. The study has been carried out both on cultivable strains, isolated by traditional methods, and on the total bacterial (Eubacteria) community by molecular methods. The isolates were preliminary investigated in order to understand their temperature preferences then their metabolic competences, including the production of extracellular enzyme activities, were tested for possible further biotechnological applications. Furthermore, a detailed taxonomical study was carried out both on cultivable and total bacterial population Strain isolation and preliminary tests Sea water was sampled in various areas of Kandalaksha Bay. The majority of samples were collected, at minimum tide level using sterile containers, in an intertidal zone pool and from the adjacent water surface. Others, from different offshore locations and depths (0. 5, 2. 5, 15, 70 m), were taken by scuba divers or boats using Niskin bottles. Water was filtered on membranes {{in order to obtain}} both bacteria pure cultures and DNA for molecular to studies. Pure cultures of isolates (ca. 500) were obtained by plate streak method. To discharge evident replicates of same isolates, preliminary tests were carried out considering strain morphological characteristics (shape, color and dimensions), Gram reaction and simple biochemical tests (catalase and oxidase production). This preliminary selection permitted to remove the majority of replicates and to keep 52 isolates. Taxonomical identification of isolates by 16 S rDNA 2 Bacterial genomic DNA was extracted from pure cultures and used for amplification of 16 S rDNA, to allows taxonomical identification of each isolate. Only 20 strains out of 52 (ca. 38 %), showing high identity (99 - 100 %) with a single known microorganism, were identified at species level. All other isolates were identified at the genus level only: for most of them, affiliation was not possible because 98 - 99 % of identity was recorded with various species of the same genus. Moreover 3 strains showed a very low percentage of identity (96 - 97 %). The majority of sequences were phylogenetically related to the genera Pseudomonas and Serratia that are well worldwide distributed. However, only a typical bacteria of cold marine environment Shewanella baltica (KB 30) have been revealed. When Blastn analyses supplied uncertain identification, sequences were aligned with highly similar 16 S in the Genbank and phylogenetic analysis was performed. To get a confident branch-length, three different trees, Pseudomonas, Serratia and a group containing all the other genera, were inferred. Basing on the results some of the strains were identified with certainty at species level while some others, due to the branch length or the external position, probably belonged to new species. For all other strains identification was possible at genus level only. In many cases this could be due to the scarce informative power of the gene target used to discern the relations below the genus level. Temperature growth profiles The optimal temperatures for growth of the various strains were tested in the range 0 - 45 °C on PCA plates (steps of 5 °C). Most of the strains (42 % ca.) showed the optimum at 30 °C. The lowest optimum was recorded at 15 °C for one strain only (KB 75), while the highest was at 40 °C (KB 22 and KB 49). Most of the strains (56 %) were able to growth at 0 °C while only 25 % grew at 45 °C. In addition, the majority were able to grow in a rather broad range of temperature. The majority of the isolates (42 %) seems to be psychrotrophics while no psychrophiles were detected. Almost all the strains could be considered as <b>eurythermics,</b> 3 indicating adaptation to frequent and wide temperature variations such as those of Kandalaksha Bay. Moreover, it was evident that many KB strains had wider ranges of growth if compared with same species described in literature; optima were also different. Extracellular enzyme activity The strains where submitted to plate screening for the production of various extracellular enzyme activities (amylase, cellulase, chitinase, pectinase, phosphatase, protease, urease, lipases), at their optimal temperature, in order to obtain metabolic information and to find new microorganisms for possible applications. Lipases, phosphatase and protease were common (ca. 54 % and 44 % of the isolates, respectively). Pectinase and amylase were present in about 32 % of the strains, while chitinase and urease were detected in a limited number of isolates (17 % both); cellulase was not detected. Organisms producing large halos of activity were considered as possible high producers and could be further investigated for biotechnological application. However, none of the isolates produced all the tested activities and a rather large number of strains (17 %) produced no activity at all. The results of the screening could be useful also at ecological level. In fact, the isolates producing a limited number of enzymes could be considered as specialized, while those with more diversified enzymatic competence, showing a higher eco-nutritional versatility, are probably advantaged in the harsh White Sea environment. Metabolic competences by BIOLOG system The BIOLOG system was used to test the metabolic competences of the strains by their ability to use different compounds as carbon sources. The system is able to detect the oxidation of 95 compounds (including sugars, fatty, organic amino and acids), used by microorganisms as sole carbon sources. In our case, amino acids were generally the preferred compounds: the most utilized carbon sources were L-Glutamic Acid and L-asparagine (96 % of strains). Also use of sugars was, as expected, rather common, being α-D-Glucose oxidized by ca. 92 %of strains. The information obtained by BIOLOG could be considered as an index 4 regarding the strain metabolic complexity. A small number of strain apparently showed a rather simple metabolism being using a limited number of carbon sources and only few showed a very diversified metabolic competence. However, the majority of the bacteria tested used about 30 - 50 compounds showing medium-high competence. In general, the strains able to use a wide array of carbon sources were also able to produce diversified extracellular enzyme patterns confirming their high eco-nutritional versatility. Study on the total bacterial (Eubacteria) community In order to have a complete overview of the bacterial community structure, by a cultivation-independent approach, total DNA was extracted from the filter-membranes. The bacteria biodiversity was studied by PCR-TGGE fingerprinting of partial 16 S-rRNA gene amplicons. TGGE band patterns were normalized, compared and clustered. showed The community structure was revealed by the cluster analysis of the fingerprints. Samples collected both from the intertidal zone and the nearby sea surface, grouped together (80 % similarity). Samples from open sea clearly clustered away. This was particularly evident for the sample collected at - 70 m, which branched away at only 40 % similarity. TGGE gel images allow the analysis of band patterns generated from the environmental samples representing the various species present in the community. A single species is identified by a single band and the relative abundance of a single species is determined by the band intensity. Among the KB samples, a total of 70 different banding positions (band classes) were detected. The average number of bands per sample was 26 with a maximum of 30 in the samples from open sea. Simpson's Diversity Index calculated for all the samples showed very high level of diversity. Based on the total number of bands in each TGGE pattern and the relative temperature gradient, range-weighted richness indexes (Rr) were calculated and indicated a very high community biodiversity. Relative bands intensities were also calculated and expressed as percentages of the total band intensity in each TGGE lane. To render a graphic representation of the bacterial communities evenness, Pareto-Lorenz distribution curves were drawn based on the intensities. 5 The functional community redundancy (response to perturbing environmental conditions) is evaluated by the Functional organization index (Fo) considering curves slope. Results showed a balanced community with medium Fo and a medium evenness. In other words, due to the elevated concentration of some species and the availability of many others, the community can potentially deal with environmental conditions changes thus preserving its functionality. Prominent TGGE bands were excised from the gel, re-amplified and sequenced, to obtain the identities of the community predominant populations. Sequences phylogenetic analysis, showed a great presence of α-proteobacteria (16 sequences out of 27) with some γ-proteobacteria and some actinobacteria too. Some cyanobacteria were revealed also. Among α -proteobacteria strains can be affiliated mainly to the genus Roseobacter and one sequence was related to Ruegeria. All γ-proteobacteria showed highly similarity with the species of Cobetia marina, while all the cyanobacteria were unknown. Taxonomic results obtained by the total community study were quite different from those gained by the pure cultures: the pure culture strains were completely different (genera and species) from those by 16 S rDNA analysis. This could be explained by the limits of TGGE technique. In fact, due to the bias introduced by the PCR reaction, this methodology can only detect bacteria representing at least 1 % of the total community. It is possible that some species, even if present in a very low percentage, had prevailed due to favorable culture conditions of the isolation procedures. However, it is known|$|R
40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIGlobal {{warming and}} {{biological}} invasions are important threats to biodiversity. Nonetheless, {{there is little}} information on how these factors influence performance or life-history traits of invasive and native species. 2. The effects of temperature on physiological and fitness traits of two invasive alien species (Harmonia axyridis and Hippodamia variegata) and one native species (Eriopis chilensis) of coccinellid were evaluated, testing a model of eurythermality. Eggs of all species were exposed to four temperature treatments (20, 24, 30 and 33 degrees C). In adult F- 2 we measured fecundity, locomotor performance, development time (total and per life stage), survival, and preferred body temperature in a thermal gradient. 3. It was found that H. axyridis had comparatively better performance at low temperatures (i. e. 20 degrees C), while the performance of H. variegata and E. chilensis did not change with temperature or was better at higher temperatures (30 degrees C). The standardised Levins index showed that all species are <b>eurythermic.</b> E. chilensis had a high niche overlap with the invasive alien ladybird species, rejecting the hypothesis of greater eurythermality of invasive species than native species. 4. Although there were differences in the temperature preferences and in the response of some physiological and life-history traits of ladybirds to temperature, both the native and invasive alien species are <b>eurythermic,</b> contrary to the prediction. The better performance of H. axyridis at lower temperatures may result in displacement of its current distribution, and thus not all invasive species will respond favourably to global warming.

40|$|The {{original}} aim of {{this study}} was to characterise some aspects of the thermophysiology of a terrestrial vertebrate ectotherm which is physiologically adapted to tolerate and to be active over a wide range of body temperatures including low temperatures. The intention was to investigate the physiological performances of a <b>eurythermic</b> lizard over as wide a temperature range as was biologically and technically practicable and at different levels of organisation (organismal, organ and tissue). The small <b>eurythermic</b> skink Leiolopisma zelandica was chosen because of its abundance locally. Preliminary experiments indicated that certain physiological responses of the intact animal could be determined over the range - 5 ° to 40 ° C. During the course of this investigation, information about the general biology and thermal relations of L. zelandica was also obtained, In addition, a large number of experiments were conducted at the temperature extremes of this species to explore physiological and behavioural responses to high and low temperatures. The bulk of the work on the thermophysiology of whole animals and tissues has been written up as two manuscripts in a style suitable for publication (Section 1, Papers A and B). A second section was erected to contain more thorough accounts of the biology, thermal relations and responses to temperature extremes of L. zelandica (Section 2, Parts A and B). Because most of the thermophysiological work was presented in the more concise format of a manuscript, it was necessary to elaborate in appendices on pertinent information regarding equipment and procedures. Data presented graphically in Papers A and B are tabulated in the final appendix. This approach to thesis presentation has necessitated some duplication of information within the thesis so that the Papers could be relatively autonomous. Since, at the time of thesis submission, Papers A and B have not been sent to editors, a compromise was made between the traditional form of a dissertation and the manuscript style. Consequently, a certain amount of redaction is anticipated...|$|E
30|$|An {{interesting}} concept {{emerging from}} the present work is that differences of AAC in fish eyes may {{provide insight into the}} different capacity of the animals to adapt to different environmental temperatures. In fact, several authors have defined zebrafish and sardine as eurythermics. Sardines are <b>eurythermic</b> and euryhaline clupeoids that generally inhabit waters with temperatures ranging from 8 to 24  °C and salinities from 30 to 38 psu (Haynes and Nichols 1994; Giannoulaki et al. 2005; Coombs et al. 2006; Petitgas et al. 2006; Stratoudakis et al. 2007; Bonanno et al. 2014). Zebrafish are freshwater fish; even if they are also tolerant {{to a wide range of}} salinities that technically extend to brackish conditions. Sawant et al. (2001) found that embryos, reared in salinities of up to 2 parts per thousand, displayed similar rates of survival and hatching in controlled environment at ∼ 0.3 ppt. They can tolerate a wide temperature range from 6 to 38 °C.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} total {{metabolic}} cost expenditures on {{the precision of}} behavioral thermoregulation was investigated for the purportedly <b>eurythermic</b> Northern Alligator lizard (Gerrhonotus coeruleus). An operant apparatus was designed to test metabolic output at different heat reinforcement magnitudes. The mean TB reflected in each trial was positively correlated {{to the length of}} reinforcement. The shuttle rate during each trial was inversely correlated to the length of reinforcement. The standard deviation and total metabolic costs did not vary significantly between trials undertaken at the same ambient temperature. Eurythermality in G. coeruleus is caused by fluctuations in preferred body temperature and not by fluctuations around this temperature. The metabolic cost of behavioral thermoregulation did not change with corresponding changes in reinforcement magnitude. This indicates that eurythermality is the recorded effect of lizards behaviorally regulating to different TB in a stenothermic manner, rather than of random TB fluctuations {{in a wide range of}} normal activity (the classical view of eurythermality) ...|$|E
40|$|Several {{species of}} Porphyra occurs in LIS (U. S. A.), however, little {{was known about}} their spatial and {{temporal}} occurrence, {{as well as many}} aspects of their ecophysiology. Hence, one site at Horse Shoe Beach, Cove Island Park, Stamford, CT was chosen to be monitored from January 1999 to May 2002. Samples of P. suborbiculata (Kjellm.), P. purpurea (Roth) C. Agardh, and P. leucosticta (Thuret in Le Jol.) as well as two strains of P. leucosticta i. e Type A and Type C (sensu Neefus et al. 2000) from LIS, were used in short-term nutrient-uptake experiments. Samples were taken at specific times during the experiments to analyze content for total C, total N, phycoerythrin, phycocyanin, phycoallocyanin, FAA and dry weight. Experiments were also performed to determine each types photosynthetic characteristics. ^ At the monitoring site, only three species of Porphyra species were found. The <b>eurythermic</b> Porphyra suborbiculata inhabited the upper midlittoral. The winter-species Porphyra leucosticta Type A was found in lower midlittoral and the infralittoral fringe as opposed to the other winter-species P. leucosticta Type C that was found in the midlittoral, with its peak in the middle to lower part. As for several other species at the site, the abundance of the Porphyra species was correlated to change in seawater and air temperature among years. ^ At 25 °C, P. suborbiculata reached a Pmax of almost 90 μmol O 2 ·g− 1 DW·min − 1. The efficiency coefficient (a) was twice as high in P. leucosticta Type A than in P. purpurea and P. suborbiculata and showed an increased with temperature only for P. suborbiculata. Porphyra leucosticta Type A showed signs of chronic photodamaged in temperatures above 15 °C at 1650 pmol photon-m− 2 ·s− 1. ^ During the uptake experiments, no differences in nitrate uptake-rates were found between stenothermic and <b>eurythermic</b> species of Porphyra. However, average initial uptake rates by Porphyra spp. were rather high (max V 0 - 1 h 30 mM = 73. 8 μmo 1 NO 3 ·g− 1 DW h − 1), demonstrating the ability to quickly absorb nitrate from the medium. FAA content in the summer-species Porphyra purpurea was much lower than for the winter-species and was the only species that showed an initiation of FAA synthesis during the short-term experiments. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{temperate}} {{regions of}} the northern hemisphere, where stream thermal regimes fluctuate seasonally and predictably, temperature has a role in niche segregation and maintenance of patterns of lotic diversity and distribution, as described by the ‘Thermal Equilibrium Hypothesis’. In Australia, the role of temperature in regulating patterns of diversity and distribution has been obscure, as seasonal variation in stream temperatures can be exceeded by stochastic fluctuation in flow. The thermal responses of five lotic Chironomidae (Diptera) species, contrasting in biogeographic (evolutionary) history, from warm tropical and cool temperate Australian populations, were investigated. All species, including postulated cool-stenotherms, showed broadly <b>eurythermic</b> developmental and morphological responses, and maintained both survivorship and oocyte production at elevated temperatures despite reductions in overall body size. There were subtle differences among species according to biogeographic affinity, with tolerances of Gondwanan species, which were narrower than those of cosmopolitan species, best characterised as ‘mesothermic’, {{but there was little}} divergence between populations. These results have implications for the understanding of diversity and distribution of Australian chironomids, and indicate that applicability of the Thermal Equilibrium Hypothesis to Australian lotic faunas may be limited...|$|E
40|$|The chaetognaths from 187 {{zooplankton}} samples {{collected from}} the Bahía Magdalena lagoon complex, Baja California Sur, México during March, June, July, August, September, November, and December 1982 were studied. Twelve species belonging to two genera were identified. Sagitta euneritica and S. enflata were the most abundant and most frequent species with maximum abundance in July (40, 000 org/ 100 m 3 and 6100 org/ 100 m 3 respectively). Sagitta pacifica, S. regularis and S. pseudoserratodentata were stenothermic (21 to 25 oC), whereas {{the rest of the}} species were <b>eurythermic</b> (15. 5 to 29. 5 oC). Sagitta euneritica contributed considerably to the zooplanktonic biomass, increasing the density in particular in Bahía Almejas. The analysis of the species assemblages (Morisita index) showed that S. pacifica and S. regularis interact more frequently in August when there is a change of the water masses that converge in this zone during summer, when the California Countercurrent predominates. The composition of taxa during winter is characterized by the dominance of S. euneritica. Entering the warm period, an abrupt change occurs in taxa composition of the three zones studied: channels, Bahía Magdalena, and Bahía Almejas.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of chironomid taxa and environmental datasets from 46 New Zealand lakes identified temperature (February mean air temperature) and lake production (chlorophyll a (Chl a)) {{as the main}} drivers of chironomid distribution. Temperature was the strongest driver of chironomid distribution and consequently produced the most robust inference models. We present two possible temperature transfer functions from this dataset. The most robust model (weighted averaging-partial least squares (WA-PLS), n = 36) {{was based on a}} dataset with the most productive (Chl a > 10 µg l− 1) lakes removed. This model produced a coefficient of determination (r^ 2 _ jack) of 0. 77, and a root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEPjack) of 1. 31 °C. The Chl a transfer function (partial least squares (PLS), n = 37) was far less reliable, with an r^ 2 _ jack of 0. 49 and an RMSEPjack of 0. 46 Log 10 µg l− 1. Both of these transfer functions could be improved by a revision of the taxonomy for the New Zealand chironomid taxa, particularly the genus Chironomus. The Chironomus morphotype was common in high altitude, cool, oligotrophic lakes and lowland, warm, eutrophic lakes. This could reflect the widespread distribution of one <b>eurythermic</b> species, or the collective distribution of a number of different Chironomus species with more limited tolerances. The Chl a transfer function could also be improved by inputting mean Chl a values into the inference model rather than the spot measurements that were available for this study...|$|E
30|$|Distinguishing {{the effect}} of water {{temperature}} on communities of streams benthos from other environmental variables (i.e., physical and chemical) is a challenging task. This is especially true if streams are of different size, depth, flow, and substrate types (Arai et al. 2015; Duggan et al. 2007; Phillips et al. 2015; Quinn and Hickey 1990; Statzner and Higler 1986). Headwater streams naturally control for many confounding factors as they have significantly lower or no anthropogenic impact and lower variation in flow regimes and water quality year around (Arai et al. 2015; Cummins 1974; Karr and Dudley 1981; Moore and Wondzell 2005; Richardson and Danehy 2007). Therefore, temperature {{plays a significant role}} for benthic invertebrates of headwater streams (Arai et al. 2015; Chang et al. 2012). For example, few <b>eurythermic</b> species are found in headwater streams in general (Haidekker and Hering 2008). Increasing a stream’s temperature can {{have a significant impact on}} physiology, ecology, and life history of organisms living in streams (Angilletta 2009; Sheldon and Tewksbury 2014 a, b). We are still at the preliminary stage of understanding of how temperature change shifts the communities in freshwaters as a whole and in long term. Moreover, consensus on how this change occurs varies perhaps due to differences in geographical regions, scale of the study and type of the freshwaters. In this study, data are only suggestive that temperature accounts for variation among community of benthos (i.e., based on the CA analysis species scores correlation with stream temperature, RDA and CCA analyses, DD, and temperature data).|$|E
40|$|Ongoing {{climate change}} is driving {{dramatic}} range shifts in diverse taxa worldwide, and species responses to global change {{are likely to be}} determined largely by population responses at geographical range margins. Here we investigate the metabolic and reproductive plasticity in response to water temperature and salinity variation of two populations of the <b>eurythermic</b> saline water bug Sigara selecta: one population located close to the northern edge of its distribution, in a relatively cold, thermally stable region (SE England – ‘marginal’), and one close to the range centre, in a warmer and more thermally variable Mediterranean climate (SE Spain – ‘core’). We compared metabolic and oviposition rates and egg size, following exposure to one of four different combinations of temperature (15 and 25 °C) and salinity (10 and 35 g L¯¹). Oviposition rate was significantly higher in the marginal population, although eggs laid were smaller overall. No significant differences in oxygen consumption rates were found between core and marginal populations, although the marginal population showed higher levels of plasticity in both metabolic and reproductive traits. Our results suggest that population-specific responses to environmental change are complex and may be mediated by differences in phenotypic plasticity. In S. selecta, the higher plasticity of the marginal population may facilitate both its persistence in current habitats and northward expansion with future climatic warming. The less plastic core population may be able to buffer current environmental variability with minor changes in metabolism and fecundity, but could be prone to extinction if temperature and salinity changes exceed physiological tolerance limits in the future...|$|E

The article is copyrighted by the US Government and published by Springer. It can be found at: [URL] thermal sensitivity of Arctic fish species is poorly understood, yet such data are a critical component of forecasting and understanding ecosystem impacts of climate change. In this study, we experimentally measured temperature-dependent growth and routine swim activity in the juvenile stage of two Arctic gadids (Arctic cod, Boreogadus saida and saffron cod, Eleginus gracilis) and two North Pacific gadids (walleye pollock, Gadus chalcogrammus and Pacific cod, Gadus macrocephalus) over a 6 -week growth period across five temperatures (0, 5, 9, 16 and 20 °C). Arctic cod demonstrated a cold-water, stenothermic response in that there was relatively high growth at 0 °C (0. 73 % day⁻¹), near-maximal growth at 5 °C (1. 35 % day⁻¹) and negative impacts on activity, growth and survival at 16 °C. In contrast, saffron cod demonstrated a warmer-water, <b>eurythermic</b> response, and temperature had a positive effect on growth and condition beyond 16 °C. However, despite these distinct thermal responses, walleye pollock and Pacific cod grew 2 – 3 times faster than Arctic gadids across a relatively broad temperature range above 5 °C. These results, coupled with possible northward expansion by both Pacific cod and walleye pollock, suggest Arctic cod are highly vulnerable to continued climate change in the Arctic, especially in coastal areas of the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas where temperatures already exceed 14 °C in the summer growth period...|$|E
40|$|Mitochondrial {{uncoupling}} protein 1 (UCP 1) {{is known}} to be crucial in thermoregulatory processes in various endothermic animals, and its homologues are widely distributed among vertebrates, invertebrates and plants. Mitochondria are essential in the adaptation of poikilothermic animals to changing environmental temperature. The increase in mitochondrial densities frequently observed in cold adapted ectotherms may contribute to higher energetic demands through mitochondrial maintenance costs and the intrinsic energy dissipation through proton leakage. To investigate whether uncoupling proteins are also involved in the thermal adaptation of ectothermic animals, we isolated and characterised the entire genes of UCP 2 for two closely related zoarcid fish species from Antarctic (Pachycara brachycephalum) and boreal (Zoarces viviparus) waters. We developed identical RNA probes for both species to compare UCP 2 mRNA expression levels at different acclimation temperatures and between muscle and liver tissues. In addition, Western Blot analysis was performed to examine thermal regulation of UCP 2 expression at the functional, ie. protein level. Zoarcid UCP 2 is a highly conserved 313 amino acid protein, belonging to the mitochondrial membrane carrier family. At both RNA and protein levels, UCP 2 expression increased considerably with acclimation temperatures above and below habitat temperatures in the two species, with the mRNA expression patterns being reflected on the protein level. Although the Antarctic eelpout P. brachycephalum, which occurs from the Antarctic Peninsula up into high Antarctic waters, is considered to be more stenothermic than its boreal <b>eurythermic</b> relative Z. viviparus, it appears to have kept the ability to regulate the expression of one of the central proteins involved in the energy metabolism at similar ratios. The functional implications of these findings for the thermal adaptation of zoarcids will be discussed in the context of global warming scenarios...|$|E
40|$|This paper reviews {{published}} geochronological data on glacier fluctuations {{and environmental}} changes in central Patagonia (44 ° S - 49 ° S) from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) {{through to the}} Holocene. Well-dated glacial chronologies from the southern mid-latitudes can inform on the synchronicity of glacial advances worldwide and provide insight on the drivers of southern hemisphere glaciations. In central Patagonia, two large outlet lobes of the former Patagonian Ice Sheet advanced in broad synchrony with the global LGM. In contrast {{to other parts of}} Patagonia, there is no convincing evidence for a more extensive local LGM advance during Marine Isotope Stage 3. Deglaciation initiated at ca. 19 ka, earlier than in other parts of Patagonia and regionally in the Southern Hemisphere, and rapid deglaciation saw ice margins retreat in places by at least 80 - 120 km within a few millennia. The Lateglacial glacier margins are poorly constrained, but an ice mass substantial enough to maintain a large regional proglacial lake must have persisted at this time. The timing of lake drainage and opening of the Río Baker drainage route to the Pacific Ocean is debated; the only directly dated shoreline suggests this occurred {{at the end of the}} Antarctic Cold Reversal at 12. 7 ka. Palaeoecological evidence for cooling during the Antarctic Cold Reversal or Younger Dryas remains equivocal, which may reflect both the <b>eurythermic</b> nature of Patagonian vegetation and shifting Southern Westerly Winds. Eastern outlet glaciers appear to have advanced or stabilised at the Lateglacial/Holocene transition when palaeoenvironmental records indicate warmer and drier conditions, but the reason for this is unclear.

40|$|Walking leg closer muscle neuromuscular {{parameters}} {{were recorded}} electrophysiologically from homothermally and heterothermally acclimated Carcinus maenas (<b>eurythermic)</b> and Cancer pagurus (stenothermic). Homothermal (and immobilised) crabs of both species were acclimated to either 8 C or 22 C, whereas heterothermally acclimated crabs were acclimated to 8 C and 22 C coincidentally, exposing the animal's {{central nervous system}} (CNS) to either the warm (22 C) or cold (8 C) acclimation temperature. Thus, heterothermal acclimation exposes the CNS/endocrine system and one set of walking legs at one acclimation temperature, the contralateral walking legs are acclimated to the other acclimation temperature. This allowed {{an investigation into the}} CNS influence on the attainment of acclimation by walking legs. Comparisons of acclimation responses of the neuromuscular function of isolated walking legs from the same animal were done with respect to the walking leg and CNS acclimation temperatures experienced. Animals were acclimated for two weeks, recordings were taken of excitatory junctional potentials (EJP) etc., from dactylopodite closer muscle fibres when stimulated by the tonic motor axon over an experimental temperature range (6 - 26 C). The acclimation responses in homothermally exposed crabs of both species resulted in partial (Precht, type III) responses in resting potential, single and double pulse stimulated excitatory junctional potential amplitudes, these were interpreted as responses that allowed the maintenance of muscle function in the new thermal condition. With respect to long term thermal acclimation other electrophysiological parameters gave equivocal compensatory responses. Capacity acclimation responses were more complete in C. pagurus than C. maenas. In heterothermally acclimated animals resting potentials and EJP amplitudes revealed partial acclimation responses in a compensatory manner. Acclimation of heterothermally acclimated C. maenas and C. pagurus was determined to be independent of a CNS influence, indicating thermal acclimation was in response to the local tissue acclimation temperature...|$|E
40|$|A palaeolimnological {{study of}} Lake Khall was {{undertaken}} to reconstruct impacts from five {{thousand years of}} climate change and human activity in the Ol'khon region of Lake Baikal. Taiga biome dominated regional landscapes, although significant compositional turnover occurred due {{to the expansion of}} <b>eurythermic</b> and drought resistant Scots pine. Climate during the mid-Holocene was wetter than the present, and Lake Khall was fresh, with abundant molluscs. By 4. 4 cal ka BP, sedimentary geochemistry indicated a gradual change in lake water chemistry with an increase in lake salinity up to the present day, most likely controlled by groundwater influences. Vegetation turnover rate was highest between 2. 75 and 2. 48 cal ka BP, with the onset of drier, more continental climate, which resulted in an influx of aeolian particles to the lake. This abrupt shift was coincident with ice rafted debris event (IRD- 2) in North Atlantic sediments and an attenuation of the East Asian summer monsoon. A second arid period occurred shortly afterwards (2. 12 – 1. 87 cal ka BP) which resulted in the decline in ostracod numbers, especially Candona sp. A rather more quiescent, warmer period followed, between 1. 9 and 0. 7 cal ka BP, with very little change in vegetation composition, and low amounts of detrital transfer from catchment to the lake. Peak reconstructed temperatures (and low amounts of annual precipitation) were concurrent with the Medieval Climate Anomaly. Between 0. 77 and 0. 45 cal ka BP, climate in the Ol'khon region became colder and wetter, although Lake Khall did not become fresher. Cold, wet conditions are seen at other sites around Lake Baikal, and therefore represent a regional response to the period concurrent with the Little Ice Age and IRD- 0. After AD 1845 the region warms, and Pediastrum appears in the lake in high abundances for the first time. This increase is ascribed to nutrient enrichment in the lake, linked to the rapid increase in regional pastoral farmin...|$|E
40|$|Aim: Our {{aim was to}} {{document}} geographical patterns of variation in the body-size structure of European lake fish assemblages along abiotic gradients, and any differences in fish assemblage structure. We hypothesized that patterns in the body-size structure of entire lake fish assemblages are primarily temperature driven and consistent with the dominant pattern of the temperature–size rule, which suggests a decrease in adult body size with increasing developmental temperature for many ectothermic species. Location: 356 European lakes. Methods: Variation in the body-size structure of fish assemblages was explored on a continental scale along gradients of temperature, morphometry, productivity and fish assemblage structure for 356 European lakes. The mean fish assemblage body-size and individual body-size distributions were selected as size metrics. Separate analyses were conducted for lakes located within five ecoregion subsets (Borealic Uplands/Tundra, FennoScandian Shield, Central Plains, Western Plains and Western Highlands) and for lakes with different functional fish classifications (cold-, cool- and warmwater fish assemblages). Results: Geographical patterns of variation in the body-size structure of European lake fish assemblages could be clearly discerned along a temperature gradient for both the continental dataset (356 lakes) and the smaller geographical (ecoregion) subsets. We found systematic changes in fish assemblage body-size structure across temperature gradients in correspondence with the dominant thermal fish guild. The majority of the lakes, mainly located in the warmer European lowlands, were dominated by <b>eurythermic</b> cool- and warmwater fish assemblages, with smaller sized individuals characterized by linear individual body-size distributions. Lakes located in colder regions and dominated by stenothermic coldwater salmonids with larger sized individuals were characterized by unimodal or bimodal size distributions. The mean body size of cold-, cool- and warmwater fish assemblages changed uniformly along the temperature gradient. Main conclusions: Patterns of variation in the body-size structure of European lake fish assemblages {{are consistent with the}} temperature–size rule. Temperature modifies fish assemblage size structure uniformly within the thermal fish guilds and in different ecoregions. Furthermore, our results indicate an increasing predictive power of temperature to explain variability in body-size structure when moving from warmer to colder geographical regions. ...|$|E
40|$|Euphausiids, {{particularly}} the Antarctic krill Euphausia superba, are {{a crucial part}} of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. As the major link between primary production and higher trophic levels, variation in euphausiid abundance has important implications for predators, nutrient cycling, and ecosystem functioning. Climate variability influences euphausiids through multiple pathways, including direct effects on growth and indirect effects on primary production. Increasing ocean temperatures, declining sea ice, and other effects of climate change are likely to negatively affect E. superba. In contrast, {{little is known about the}} potential impacts of climate change on Thysanoessa macrura, a euphausiid with an abundance that likely rivals that of E. superba. In this thesis, I explore multiple aspects underlying the spatial and temporal variability of Antarctic euphausiids. In Chapter 2, I use state-dependent life history theory and stochastic dynamic programming to challenge the traditional paradigm of E. superba as a passive drifter, and find that accounting for active behavior in this species has important implications for spatial distribution, growth, and survival. In Chapter 3, I use a data-driven approach to quantifying spatial and temporal E. superba abundances near the North Antarctic Peninsula. I find that fluctuations inabundance are tied to lagged indices of climate variability, and that abundance and measures of spatial aggregation are linked in some habitats and seasons. Finally, in Chapter 4, I use temperature-dependent growth models to explore how changing temperatures may differentially affect growth in E. superba and T. macrura. I find that as ocean temperatures increase, the biomass per recruit of the stenothermic E. superba is likely to decline over much of the temperature range in the Southwest Atlantic. In contrast, the <b>eurythermic</b> T. macrura is expected to have enhanced growth over much of this range, and increases in T. macrura biomass could potentially compensate for some loss of E. superba biomass. However, this biomass may not be energetically equivalent from the perspective of a euphausiid predator...|$|E

The strong impacts of the alien species and the water warming subsequent to the 2003 heat wave have been detected in the Lower Rhône and the Middle Rhône: the communities of the Middle Rhône gradually exhibit profiles closer to those of the communities of the Lower Rhône. The Upper Rhône was less colonized by alien species but was impaired by the global warming: its communities exhibited biological profiles closer to those of communities of further-downstream zones. In this site, the thermal discharges have led to a lower diversity of the communities and a higher occurrence of <b>eurythermic</b> species. Hence the benthic macrofauna of the Rhône River seems to have reacted quickly and strongly to environmental changes and to the arrival of invasive species. However numerous trait adaptations being common to Mediterranean and alien species, it seems complex to evaluate the respective weight of each of these potential sources of impairment. Predicting trends in invertebrate community composition is a complex objective because of the competition between native and/or invasive species in addition to man-induced environmental variation (flow, temperature). However, if biological invasion does not occur continuously but only based on specific events (especially hydroclimatology), we can legitimately believe that this drift will continue with the arrival of new Ponto-Caspian species via the Danube-Main Canal, their usual way to western and southern Europe. The common feature of these different species is that they are essentially predators or filterers, thermophilic and euryecic, and efficient functional competitors.

40|$|Aim  We used a {{combination}} of new and previously published palaeoecological data to test three hypotheses: (1) that wooded steppe persisted in the Great Hungarian Plain throughout the Holocene; (2) that wooded steppe and steppe were most extensive between c. 9900 and 8300 cal. yr bp (the ‘Boreal steppe’ period); and (3) that Southern Continental, Pontic and Eastern Sub-Mediterranean steppe species reached the region during the early Holocene via the ‘Lower Danube Corridor’. Location  Sarló-hát oxbow lake, Hungary and the Eastern European wooded steppe zone. Methods  Holocene sediments deposited in the Sarló-hát oxbow lake were subjected to pollen and microcharcoal analyses. Twelve radiocarbon age estimates were obtained to determine sediment chronology. In addition, previously published palaeoecological data from the Great Hungarian Plain were compiled, analysed and compared with previous studies in other regions of steppe and wooded steppe in eastern Europe. Results  Palynological data from two sediment cores extending to c. 11, 400 cal. yr bp indicate the persistent dominance of the landscape by temperate deciduous wooded steppe throughout the Holocene, although with varying canopy composition. Warm-continental steppe grasslands and saline tall-grass meadows developed on edaphically constrained areas, which remained steppe-dominated throughout the Holocene. The extent of steppe grasslands did not increase between 9900 and 8300 cal. yr bp. After c. 3100 cal. yr bp, anthropogenic activities {{led to the development}} of cultural steppe. Thermophilous steppe species of the Southern Continental, Pontic and Sub-Mediterranean floristic elements probably reached the Great Hungarian Plain principally via the Lower Danube Corridor during the late glacial interstadial and Holocene. <b>Eurythermic</b> members of these elements, however, probably survived the Last Glacial Maximum in favourable microsites, extending their ranges during the Holocene from these local sources. Main conclusions  Our results confirm the Holocene persistence of wooded steppe in the Great Hungarian Plain, disprove the ‘Boreal steppe’ theory, and suggest an Early Holocene period of greater vegetation openness between 11, 400 and 9900 cal. yr bp. Evidence for the post-glacial immigration of south-eastern steppe elements into the Carpathian Basin is equivocal: the last glacial/interglacial presence of several southern steppe species suggests that the Hungarian Plain hosted suitable habitats for them during warm and cold phases alike...|$|E

40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{revealed}} temperature-related patterns in recent bryozoans, {{both in the}} chemical composition of the skeleton and in the morphological characters of the colonies, but comparable studies on Palaeozoic bryozoans are lacking. In this paper a statistical analysis of the morphological differences is undertaken between congeneric species of some Ordovician bryozoans from warm- and cold-water settings. For this study ten <b>eurythermic</b> cosmopolitan bryozoan genera from the Upper Ordovician were selected from the Mediterranean, Avalonia, Baltic and Laurentia-Siberian provinces. These genera are: Ceramopora and Ceramoporella (Cystoporata); Diplotrypa, Eridotrypa, Hallopora, Heterotrypa, Monticulipora and Trematopora (Trepostomata); Graptodictya (Cryptostomata); and Kukersella (Cyclostomata). The study involved 154 samples belonging to 104 different species. Twenty-eight morphological characters were measured, although only 21 {{were used in the}} final statistical analysis. Univariate (t, F, Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Mann-Whitney tests), multivariate discriminant and multivariate ordination (Principal Coordinates, Principal Components, Correspondence, and Detrended Correspondence) analyses were performed on the data. For the univariate and multivariate discriminant analyses, the total set of samples was divided a priori into cold- and warm-water subsets based on palaeolatitude: samples from the Mediterranean province were attributed to the cold-water subset, whereas samples from Avalonia, Baltic and the Laurentian-Siberian provinces were included in the warm-water subset. For the multivariate ordination analysis no a priori grouping by water temperature was imposed, and the aim of these analyses was to test whether different samples were correctly arranged along a water temperature gradient. The univariate statistical analysis showed that there are clear morphological differences between cold- and warm-water species in six of the ten Late Ordovician bryozoan genera analysed in this study, although these differences are only evident for some of the characters used, and only when the analysis is performed on individual genera. The best characters to differentiate species by water temperature are those related {{to the size of the}} zooidal polymorphs, especially the diameters of the autozooecia, mesozooecia and exilazooecia. With the exception of one genus (Trematopora), cold-water species have larger zooids. The discriminant analysis was able to classify correctly as warm- or cold-water 100 % of the samples for two genera, slightly below 95 % for two other genera, and between 67 % and 90 % for the remaining six genera. Finally, the multivariate ordination analysis was able to separate species by palaeogeographical province in some genera, but these provinces were not correctly arranged along a palaeolatitudinal gradient using any of the methods used...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} into the relationship between environment and reproduction in the freshwater triclad species. By studying two populations occupying adjacent habitats, under varying conditions of temperature, flow rate and resource availability, the effects of habitat variability on the di ribution density, size structure and the levels of se>:ual and ase>:ual reproduction within each population were assessed. The population occupying a habitat which was characterised by its <b>eurythermic</b> temperature regime, high flow rates and complex macroinvertebrate community, occurred at low densities. Within this population, individuals were larger, on average, than in the adjacent population, and se>:ual reproduction occurred at high levels throughout the year, with asexual reproduction (by binary and multiple fission> also occurring throughout the yea, but at lower levels. The seasonal nature of this habitat was reflected within the popUlation of, which exhibited spring peaks in density, followed by summer peaks {{in the level of}} sexual reproduction. In contrast, the adjacent population occupied a habitat which was characterised by its stenothermic temperature regime, low flow rates and a less comple> macroinvertebrate community, and occurred at much higher densities. Within this population, individuals were smaller, on average, than in the adjacent population, and sexual reproduction was virtually absent, wi th asexual reproduction (by binary. and multiple fission) occurring throughout the year at appreciable levels. The lack of seasonality within this habitat was similarly reflected in the lack of any seasonal fluctuations in density, or level of (in this case ase>:ual) reproduction within the population. The level of food availability varied seasonally in both habitats, however, and was generally similar, in terms of biomass, in bath areas. A hypothesis was presented which of triclads within each habitat related the density to the total food availability, measured as stream drift. It was suggested that at low population densities, the relatively higher levels of net resource availability per i ndi vi dual favoured the occurrence of sexual reproduction, in contrast with situations of high population density, where the relatively lower levels of net resource availability per individual inhibited the occurrence of sexual reproduction, thus favouring asexual reproduction. This hypothesis was supported by the results of laboratory investigations in other studies, together with the evidence gained from field observations from this study, particularly the observation that in the low dem::. i ty population, seasonal cycles in the level of sexual reproduction were out of phase with seasonal cycles of a similar nature in the level of popUlation denSity. Further evidence, from the results of. a field manipulation experiment, was presented which supported the hypothesis. In an area of high popUlation denSity, density was reduced artificially, resulting in {{a significant increase in the}} level of sexual reproduction within the population. population, It was concluded that in the high density intense intraspecific competition for food resulted in a low net level of food availability per individual, which in turn inhibited the process of sexualisation in triclads from that area.
