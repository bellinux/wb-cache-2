5|$|Property {{changes since}} the {{original}} construction include the front terrace, entranceway and landscaping. The former front lawn and flower beds were paved over, {{and a new}} <b>driveway</b> was cut into the stone wall north of the original large stone arch over the first <b>driveway.</b>|$|E
5|$|A row {{of fifty}} Norway spruce trees lines the main <b>driveway</b> {{leading to the}} farm. These trees {{represent}} the fifty U.S. states, and were given to Eisenhower as birthday presents {{from each of the}} state Republican Party chairmen in 1955. The furthest one from the house was the tree representing Texas, and it was seen as a mark of Eisenhower's recovery {{that he was able to}} walk that far after his heart attack.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{the legal}} {{services}} rendered by Don Felipe to the impoverished, Agoncillo {{and her daughters}} observed every Thursday as a day of charity, when a queue of needy people seeking alms would form in the Agoncillo <b>driveway.</b> No one ever left their house empty-handed. Agoncillo would hand them a bag of rice {{in addition to the}} money she gave them. This practice lasted until the couple retired.|$|E
5|$|June 5, 2007— Tropical Storm Barry {{produces}} 3.91inches (99mm) {{of rain in}} New York City. The {{heavy rainfall}} leads to flooding in the Finger Lakes region of New York State, washing out roads and <b>driveways.</b> Roads and several <b>driveways</b> were washed out.|$|R
50|$|<b>Driveways</b> may be {{decorative}} in {{ways that}} public roads cannot, because of their lighter traffic and the willingness of owners to invest in their construction. <b>Driveways</b> are not resurfaced, snow blown or otherwise maintained by governments. They are generally designed {{to conform to the}} architecture of connected houses or other buildings.|$|R
50|$|In late 2012, ParkatmyHouse {{formed a}} {{partnership}} with Transport for London, SSE plc and chargepoint manufacturer, Chargemaster, to install free electric vehicle charge points on the <b>driveways</b> of property owners currently renting out their <b>driveways</b> using the website. Once installed, the charge points can be reserved online by third parties using the ParkatmyHouse website.|$|R
5|$|Bishop Short and {{his family}} moved into the house later in 1851, and resided there until Bishop's Court, North Adelaide, {{was ready to be}} {{occupied}} in 1856. During the same year, Sir Samuel Davenport purchased the house and land from Bishop Short and lived in 'The Lodge', a small cottage at the entrance to what became the <b>driveway</b> to Beaumont House, until Short vacated Claremont.|$|E
5|$|First class mourners {{entered through}} the <b>driveway</b> under the office {{building}} which turned sharply left to run beneath a glass canopy parallel to Westminster Bridge Road; this stretch was faced with glazed white brick and lined with palm and bay trees. The <b>driveway</b> ran past mortuaries and storerooms to the lifts and stairs to the platforms, and also to a secondary entrance on Newnham Terrace (off Hercules Road). Above the mortuaries and storerooms were the LNC's workshops. Lifts and an elaborate wrought-iron staircase led from the lower two floors to platform level on the second floor. This upper level housed a sumptuous oak-panelled Chapelle Ardente, intended for mourners unable to make the journey to Brookwood {{to pay their respects}} to the deceased. A short and wide pathway led to the first class platform, lined with waiting rooms and a ticket office; the first class platform was equipped with five separate waiting rooms to keep mourners from different funeral parties separate.|$|E
5|$|In late 2006, the Jamul Indian tribe {{prepared}} {{to construct a}} casino, but many expressed concerns {{about the amount of}} traffic that would now travel on SR 94. In 2007, Caltrans declared that the construction required a permit to connect to SR94 and to construct on the state right-of-way. At the end of the year, the tribe had started construction on the <b>driveway</b> to the casino, while Caltrans stated that it lacked the information needed to determine if the proposed traffic signal should be approved. In late 2009, the tribe filed a lawsuit against Caltrans over the inability to get approval to connect the <b>driveway</b> with the highway. The tribe made the claim that they were a sovereign nation and did not need the approval, but this was rejected by the court. Caltrans and the tribe came to an agreement in 2009, where the tribe would provide its own studies and pay for environmental mitigation.|$|E
50|$|Most expressways {{under the}} federal {{definition}} have speed limits of 45-55 mph (70-90 km/h) in urban areas and 55-70 mph (90-110 km/h) in rural areas. Urban expressways are usually free of private <b>driveways,</b> but occasional exceptions include direct <b>driveways</b> to gas stations and shopping malls at major intersections (which would never be allowed on a true freeway).|$|R

5|$|The new building, also {{designed}} by Cyril Bazett Tubbs, {{was designed for}} attractiveness and modernity to contrast with the traditional gloomy decor associated with the funeral industry. A narrow four-storey office building stood at 188 Westminster Bridge Road. The ground floor was taken up by a large arch leading to a waiting room, an office for general enquiries, and the long <b>driveway</b> leading to the station itself; above this were the LNC's offices and boardrooms.|$|E
5|$|The present château {{with its}} five conical towers and watchtower capped by slate roofs {{began to be}} built in the 15th century, and was altered and {{extended}} several times since then. A park was built in the 19th century through which a wide <b>driveway</b> brought visitors to the main building. This is based on a central square tower with a pyramidal roof.|$|E
5|$|Both Schlesselman and Cowart {{acknowledged}} {{that they would}} be killed {{as a result of the}} murders and insisted they were willing to die. Authorities said the pair planned to break into a gun shop to steal more weapons for their attack, and also bought nylon rope and ski masks at Walmart to use in a robbery or home invasion to fund the spree. Schlesselman and Cowart asked a friend to drive them to a house they planned to rob, but they cancelled the robbery after getting scared by a dog and two vehicles in the <b>driveway.</b>|$|E

5|$|Chris Brandkamp {{produced}} most of {{the ambient}} and incidental sounds in the game. To make sure the sounds fit, Brandkamp {{had to wait until}} the game's visuals were placed in context. Sound effects were drawn from unlikely sources; the noise of a fire in a boiler was created by driving slowly over stones in a <b>driveway,</b> because recordings of actual fire did not sound like fire burning. The chimes of a large clock tower were simulated using a wrench, then transposed to a lower pitch.|$|E
5|$|In {{its first}} {{operating}} year, a stable {{was built for}} the lodge, at the lodge's south <b>driveway</b> about 100 yards from Scarborough Road. In 1909 an addition was built (of 62 by 126 feet) and the entire structure became used for an automobile garage. The interior of the old stable was replaced. The east end held a commercial kitchen, dining room, and a billiard and smoking room. The west end held a repair shop. The {{front of the building}} held supply rooms, closets, and an office. The upstairs held bedrooms and bathrooms for the chauffeurs.|$|E
5|$|Kingsbury's Rock, {{the rock}} next to which Kingsbury died, stands {{within sight of}} where the 2/14th Battalion's {{headquarters}} had been established, and has been incorporated {{as part of the}} Isurava Memorial. His body now rests in the Bomana Cemetery, Port Moresby, and his Victoria Cross is on display at the Australian War Memorial, Canberra. The Melbourne suburb of Kingsbury was named in his honour, as was a rest area on the Remembrance <b>Driveway</b> and a street in the Canberra suburb of Gowrie. Kingsbury's story was featured in the History Channel production For Valour.|$|E

5|$|Mike {{arrives and}} realizes {{something}} is wrong after seeing the smashed car in the <b>driveway.</b> He enters the house, and James, mistaking him {{for one of the}} intruders, shoots him dead. Devastated, James remembers an old radio transmitter in the backyard shed. He leaves and encounters the blonde woman. When James tries to shoot her, the masked man knocks him unconscious. Kristen hears the shot and runs to the shed. She finds the radio, but the pin-up girl smashes it. Kristen rushes back to the house, where she is incapacitated by the masked man. Both James and Kristen are now unconscious.|$|E
5|$|On the way, the car {{gets stuck}} in the muddy <b>driveway</b> {{in the middle of}} farm country. Homer and Marge rush into the nearest barn to avoid a sudden storm. A farmer discovers the barn door is open and {{suspects}} trespassers. He enters the barn, nearly catching Homer and Marge, who are hiding in the hay loft, but leaves after failing to locate them. When the coast is clear, Homer and Marge have inspired sexual intercourse in the hay loft.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the private}} {{investigators}} was David Edgar, a retired detective inspector, hired {{on the recommendation of}} the head of Manchester's Serious Crime Squad. Edgar released an e-fit in August 2009 of a woman said to have asked two British men in Barcelona, Spain, shortly after the disappearance, whether they were there to deliver her new daughter. Other private initiatives included a Portuguese lawyer financing the search of a reservoir near Praia da Luz in February 2008, and the use of ground radar by a South African property developer, Stephen Birch, who said in 2012 that scans showed there were bones beneath the <b>driveway</b> of a house in Praia da Luz.|$|E

5|$|Originally, Entrance 2's {{escalator}} entrance was to {{be located}} inside the Yorkshire Towers apartment building at 305 East 86th Street, on {{the northeast corner of}} Second Avenue and 86th Street. In 2009, a Finding Of No Significant Impact by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) found this to be unfeasible, so the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) revised the plan to two separate sidewalk entrances in front of the building. During the planning process, it was determined that building a new entrance within the Yorkshire Towers would be too expensive and logistically unfeasible. The apartments directly above the entrance's location would have had to be structurally underpinned during construction, and the Food Emporium supermarket location would have had to close {{to make way for the}} new entrance. Of the three alternatives presented for moving the entrance, the MTA chose an alternative in which there would be two new escalator entrances on the north side of 86th Street, both flanking the semicircular <b>driveway</b> of Yorkshire Towers and facing away from the <b>driveway.</b> There was also a proposal to move the sidewalk escalator entrances to the south side of the street, as well as another proposal to build a new structure containing five elevators at the southeast corner of Second Avenue and 86th Street, in a manner similar to Entrance 3 of the adjacent 72nd Street station.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} is {{cast in the}} Classical Revival architectural style and contains elements common to that style. Stained glass, columns and a pediment are among the more noticeable features at a glance. The rear facade of the {{building is}} designed to resemble a temple and also features stained glass windows. A stone porte-cochere covers the rear <b>driveway.</b> Inside the building's third floor courtroom is more stained glass, {{in the form of}} a skylight. During the early 1980s a made for television movie had scenes filmed in the DeKalb County Courthouse's courtroom.|$|E
5|$|The {{church and}} {{cemetery}} are accessible through a gravel <b>driveway</b> to the north; to the west, {{a cluster of}} tall oak trees blocks access to the road. Capon Chapel is landscaped with boxwoods on its north and south sides, a single holly on its east side, and forsythias along its west side. The Capon Chapel property consists of the church structure (c. 1852), and its associated cemetery, which is enclosed partly by the historic wrought iron fence and partly by a chain link fence. A flagpole stands {{at the center of}} the cemetery's eastern perimeter.|$|E
