500|$|Kim Novak, {{who worked}} on Hitchcock's 1957 Vertigo, disputed Hedren's (and the film's) view of the director. Novak told The Daily Telegraph, [...] "I feel bad about all the stuff people are saying about him now, {{that he was a}} weird character. I did not find him to be weird at all. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> make a pass at anybody or act strange to anybody." [...] Louise Latham, who played Hedren's mother in Marnie, {{dismissed}} claims of Hitchcock's predatory nature in Broadcast magazine: [...] "I find some of the allegations hard to believe...I wasn't aware of her being hassled on the set." ...|$|E
500|$|Morrison {{returned}} to the A studios between June and August to record the remaining six tracks that featured on the album. For this second session Dahaud Shaar filled the role of engineer, though Shaar did not remember Morrison giving the job to him: [...] "Elliot {{thought he was going}} to be the co-producer, but then again <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> calling takes or asking people to change parts ... I didn't consider myself co-producer. Van would ask me questions and I would give him answers, but it was never a defined role." [...] Morrison felt unsatisfied with some of the final recordings, and notably reworked the song [...] "Street Choir" [...] shortly before studio work concluded.|$|E

500|$|By autumn 1974, Drake's weekly {{retainer}} from Island had ceased, and {{his illness}} meant {{he remained in}} contact {{with only a few}} close friends. He had tried {{to stay in touch with}} Sophia Ryde, whom he had first met in London in 1968. Ryde has been described by Drake's biographers as [...] "the nearest thing" [...] to a girlfriend in his life, but she now prefers the description [...] "best (girl) friend". In a 2005 interview, Ryde revealed that a week before he died, she had sought to end the relationship: [...] "I couldn't cope with it. I asked him for some time. And <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> again." [...] As with the relationship he had earlier shared with fellow folk musician Linda Thompson, Drake's relationship with Ryde was never consummated.|$|E
500|$|A {{journalist}} wrote, in {{the late}} 1890s, that Leno was [...] "probably the highest paid funny man in the world". In 1898, Leno, Herbert Campbell and Johnny Danvers formed a consortium to build the Granville Theatre in Fulham, which was demolished in 1971. Leno published an autobiography, Dan Leno: Hys Booke, in 1899, ghostwritten by T. C. Elder. Leno's biographer J. Hickory Wood commented: [...] "I can honestly say that <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> absolutely at rest. He was always doing something, and had {{something else to do}} afterwards; or he had just been somewhere, was going somewhere else, and had several other appointments to follow." [...] That year, Leno performed the role of [...] "waxi omo" [...] (a slang expression for a black-face performer) in the Doo-da-Day Minstrels, an act that included Danvers, Campbell, Bransby Williams, Joe Elvin and Eugene Stratton. [...] The troupe's only performance was at the London Pavilion on 29 May 1899 as part of a benefit. [...] Leno's song [...] "The Funny Little Nigger" [...] greatly amused the audience. His biographer Barry Anthony considered the performance to be [...] "more or less, the last gasp of black-face minstrelsy in Britain".|$|E

McCool, {{in his memoirs}} Cricket is a Game, wrote: [...] "Steve has as good a pair of wicket-keeping hands as I {{have seen in the}} business. If I had to choose between him and Godfrey Evans, I would go for him every time." [...] The fast-medium bowler Ken Biddulph, also from County Durham, called Stephenson a [...] "brilliant keeper: <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> have a bad day".|$|E

Suffice {{to say that it}} was violent effort, excitement, and hilarity. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> counted the leaps of the swordfish. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> clearly <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> after that first leap.

2500|$|Lane {{was born}} in Austin, Texas, in April 1928. [...] When he was three months old, he was {{abandoned}} by his birth parents, a prostitute and pimp. He was found, covered in newspapers, in a dumpster. Lane later recalled, [...] "My father was called Texas Slim. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> - I don't know if he's the one that told my mother to throw me away. A pimp told my mother I had to go. They {{put me in a}} trash can and took off. Some people heard me crying. They thought it was a cat." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1985 James Baldwin {{described}} {{the impact of}} Delaney on his life, saying he was [...] "the first living proof, for me, that a black man could be an artist. In a warmer time, a less blasphemous place, {{he would have been}} recognised as my Master and I as his Pupil. He became, for me, an example of courage and integrity, humility and passion. An absolute integrity: I saw him shaken many times and I lived to see him broken but <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> bow." [...] He further wrote, [...] "Perhaps I should not say, flatly, what I believe – that he is a great painter – among the very greatest; but I do know that great art can only be created out of love, and that no greater lover has ever held a brush." ...|$|E
5000|$|With {{the fall}} of the Manchu dynasty in 1912, several {{competitive}} forces battled to gain control of China. During the ensuing years, the Kiangyin Mission was regularly confronted with periods of turmoil prompted by the beginnings of the Republic of China, the dangerous warlord years, the resentment over many real and imagined oppressions by the West, the early years of Communism, the rising threat of Japan, and finally, the Sino-Japanese War itself. A fellow missionary later reflected on Moffett, “The strains and the stresses of the years cannot be fully understood or appreciated by any except those who experienced them. In all that time, <b>I</b> <b>never</b> once <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> lose his poise or seem to be confused.” ...|$|R

He recalled our little unpleasantness the night previous and said he did not believe there was cause for alarm, and was so impressed with the belief that he had not taken the precaution to throw out scouts in the direction the Sioux were reported to be. A few minutes later a buffalo scout signaled that buffaloes had been sighted in the distance, and Sky Chief rode off to engage in the hunt. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> again.

Now, this our poor fellow citizen, Oliver Proudfute, having been active in spreading these reports, as indeed his element lay in such gossipred, some words passed betwixt him and me on the subject; and, as I think, he left me with the purpose of visiting Henry Smith, for he broke off from the morrice dancers, promising, as it seems, to meet them, as your honour has said, at the sign of the Griffin, in order to conclude the evening.

Finding an ordnance train I obtained from the officer in charge a few wagons loaded with what I wanted, but he seemed in doubt as to our occupancy of the region across which I proposed to guide them.

We did so, when to my astonishment I saw the entire country in front swarming with Confederates; the very earth seemed to be moving toward us! They came on in thousands, and so rapidly that we had barely time to turn tail and gallop down the hill and away, leaving them in possession of the train, many of the wagons being upset by frantic efforts to put them about.

60|$|Nothing in England seeks you out, {{except the}} damp. Your impressions, {{you have to}} fight for them. What you see or hear seems of accident. The sort of people you have read of your whole life, and are most {{intimate}} with in fiction, you must surprise. They no more court observance than the birds in whose seasonable slaughter society from the King down delights. In fact, it is probable that, if you looked for both, you would find the gunner shyer than the gunned. The pheasant and the fox are bred to give pleasure by their chase; they are tenderly cared for and watched over and kept from harm at the hands of all who do not wish to kill them for the joy of killing, and they are not so elusive but they can be seen by easy chance. The pheasant especially has at times all but the boldness of the barnyard in his fearless port. Once from my passing train, I <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> {{standing in the middle of}} a ploughed field, erect, distinct, like a statue of himself, commemorative of the long ages in which his heroic death and martyr sufferance have formed the pride of princes and the peril of poachers. But <b>I</b> <b>never</b> once <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> shot, though almost as many gunners pursue him as there are pheasants in the land. This alone shows how shy the gunners are; and when once I saw the trail of a fox-hunt from the same coign of vantage without seeing the fox, I felt that I had almost indecently come upon the horse and hounds, and that the pink coats and the flowery spread of the dappled dogs over the field were mine by a kind of sneak as base as killing a fox to save my hens.|$|R
