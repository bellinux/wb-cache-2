50|$|A ring laser {{gyroscope}} (RLG) {{consists of a}} ring laser having two independent counter-propagating resonant modes over the same path; the <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>frequencies</b> is used to detect rotation. It operates {{on the principle of}} the Sagnac effect which shifts the nulls of the internal standing wave pattern in response to angular rotation. Interference between the counter-propagating beams, observed externally, results in motion of the standing wave pattern, and thus indicates rotation.|$|E
50|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{discovery}} of the laser, a seminal paper by Rosenthal appeared in 1962, which proposed what was later called a ring laser. While the ring laser shares with regular (linear) lasers features like extreme monochromaticity and high directivity, it differs in its inclusion of an area. With the ring laser, one could distinguish two beams in opposite directions. Rosenthal anticipated that the beam frequencies could be split by effects that affected the two beams in different ways. Although some may consider Macek et al. has built the first large ring laser (1 meter × 1 meter). The US patent office has decided the first ring laser was built under Sperry scientist, Chao Chen Wang, (see US Patent 3,382,758) based on the Sperry laboratory records. Wang showed that simply rotating it could generate a <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>frequencies</b> of the two beams (Sagnac). An industry focusing on smaller ring laser gyros emerged, with decimeter-sized ring lasers. Later it was found that any effect that affects the two beams in nonreciprocal fashion produces a frequency difference, as Rosenthal anticipated. Tools to analyze and construct rings were adapted from regular lasers, including methods to calculate the signal-to-noise ratio and to analyze beam characteristics. New phenomena unique to rings appeared, including lock-in, pulling, astigmatic beams, and special polarizations. Mirrors play a much greater role in ring lasers than in linear lasers, leading to the development of particularly high quality mirrors.|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate association between the polymorphisms in the causal genes for congenital cataract and ARC in a Chinese population. Meanwhile, we performed the replication study for previous identified risk genes for ARC. Methods: We recruited 212 sporadic Han Chinese patients with age-related cataracts (ARC) and 172 normal controls in this study. We analyzed 31 SNPs from 13 genes which mostly possible contributes the progress of ARC in a Chinese population, comprising 212 cataract patients and 172 controls. Polymorphism-spanning fragments were amplified by using the multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and genotyped using primer extension method in MassARRAY platform. Allelic and haplotypic <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>frequencies</b> were estimated using the SHEsis software platform. P-value was adjusted by the Bonferroni correction. Results: There was no <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>frequencies</b> of the genotype and allele of the all SNPs between the patients with ARC and the controls. In the haplotypic analysis, the haplotypes consisting of rs 7154572, rs 7150141 and rs 12432994 in Kinesin Light Chain 1 Gene (KLC 1) showed significant association with ARC (p = 0. 000878).

40|$|Acoustic {{perturbations}} in {{a parallel}} relativistic flow of an inviscid fluid are considered. The general expression for {{the frequency of the}} sound waves in a uniformly (with zero shear) moving medium is derived. It is shown that relativity evokes a <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>frequencies</b> of the sound-type perturbations propagating along and against the current. Besides, it is shown that the perturbations are not purely irrotational as they are in nonrelativistic case. For a non-uniformly (with nonzero shear) moving fluid a general set of equations, describing the evolution of the acoustic perturbations in relativistic sheared flows, is obtained and analysed when the temperature is nonrelativistic. It is shown that, like the nonrelativistic case, in the new system: (a) the excitation of vortical, transiently growing perturbations, and (b) the excitation of sound-type perturbations, extracting the kinetic energy of the background flow, are possible. It is demonstrated that the relativistic character of the motion significantly intensifies the efficiency of both these processes. Finally, the possible relevance of this study to processes in astrophysical shear flows is pointed out. ...|$|E

The effect of methylenetrathydrofolate reductase (GeneID: 4524) polymorphisms in migraine etiology and development has been a theme of great interest. Several populations were evaluated with contradictory results. In this case-control study, we investigated the effect of the C 677 T polymorphism in MTHFR, as a genetic risk factor for migraine, in the Portuguese population. We observed that, overall, there was no significant <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>frequencies</b> of MTHFR C 677 T genotypes or of the T-allele among the Portuguese migraineurs when compared to controls. There was also no association of migraine with aura with MTHFR genotypes or with the T-allele, in contrast with previous studies. Regarding the risk of the T-allele homozygote carriers, there was an equal probability to develop migraine with aura over migraine without aura in our patients. Thus, we conclude that the C 677 T MTHFR polymorphism, responsible for a reduction of the MTHFR activity in folate metabolism, is not a major genetic susceptibility factor for migraine in the Portuguese population...|$|E
