5|$|As I sifted the {{evidence}} this became {{less and less}} convincing to me until I concluded that the opposite was closer to the truth: that the Métis grievances were at least partly of their own making; {{that the government was}} on the verge of resolving them when the Rebellion broke out; That Riel's resort to arms could not be explained by the failure of constitutional agitation and that he received a surprisingly <b>fair</b> <b>trial.</b>|$|E
5|$|Samira Rajab, the country's Minister of State for Information (and Rajab's cousin twice over) {{declared}} that Rajab had enjoyed a <b>fair</b> <b>trial</b> with unrestricted access to legal assistance. She said that action {{had been taken}} against him because although claiming {{to be a human}} rights activist he had in fact been engaging in political activity, a justification similar to that offered by an officially-appointed MP for the trial of Bahrain health workers.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{before her}} {{scheduled}} Missouri trial date, Kinne's Missouri counsel {{filed a motion}} to change the venue of any eventual fourth trial {{in the death of}} James Kinne, claiming that news coverage of Kinne's cases had so prejudiced residents of Jackson County against her that it would be impossible for her to get a <b>fair</b> <b>trial</b> there.|$|E
5|$|The case {{received}} extensive {{attention in}} the Japanese media, especially in Okinawa, and the crime sparked a public debate over the U.S. military presence in Japan, the privileges of extraterritoriality, {{as well as the}} <b>fair</b> <b>trial</b> practices of Japanese legal system and the Japanese police. The case involved the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan and the U.S.–Japan Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA).|$|E
5|$|The court {{decided that}} it would be {{reasonably}} possible for a jury to convict Thomas based on the available evidence, so it then considered whether there were factors which would make a retrial unjust. Thomas' lawyer Lex Lasry argued that the delay in Thomas' prosecution (he was not arrested until seventeen months after he returned to Australia) and the extensive media coverage of the case meant it was unlikely Thomas would get a <b>fair</b> <b>trial,</b> and that a retrial would be an undue hardship on Thomas given that he has spent long periods in custody, mostly in solitary confinement, without conviction, which has led to him being diagnosed with depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. The court was of the opinion that a <b>fair</b> <b>trial</b> was not impossible in these circumstances, and although the other factors were considered, the court ultimately decided that the circumstances did not preclude a retrial.|$|E

5|$|In his High Court appeal Dietrich was {{represented}} by David Grace, QC. The main argument advanced on Dietrich's behalf was that his trial was a miscarriage of justice, since {{he did not have}} legal representation. He argued that he should have been provided with counsel at public expense, given the seriousness of the crime with which he was charged. Alternatively, he argued that the judge should have stayed or adjourned the trial until he was able to obtain counsel himself. His argument was based on the common law tradition that an accused is entitled to a <b>fair</b> <b>trial.</b>|$|E
5|$|Kasab's {{trial was}} delayed due to legal issues, as many Indian lawyers {{were unwilling to}} {{represent}} him. A Mumbai Bar Association passed a resolution proclaiming that none of its members would represent Kasab. However, the Chief Justice of India stated that Kasab needed a lawyer for a <b>fair</b> <b>trial.</b> A lawyer for Kasab was eventually found, but was replaced due to a conflict of interest. On 25 February 2009, Indian investigators filed an 11,000-page chargesheet, formally charging Kasab with murder, conspiracy, and waging war against India among other charges.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} {{was determined to}} give the soldiers a <b>fair</b> <b>trial</b> so {{there could be no}} grounds for retaliation from the British and so moderates would not be alienated from the Patriot cause. After several lawyers with Loyalist leanings refused to defend him, Preston sent a request to John Adams, pleading for him to work on the case. Adams, who was already a leading Patriot and who was contemplating a run for public office, agreed to help, in the interest of ensuring a <b>fair</b> <b>trial.</b> Adams was joined by Josiah Quincy II after the latter was assured that the Sons of Liberty would not oppose his appointment, and by Robert Auchmuty, a Loyalist. They were assisted by Sampson Salter Blowers, whose chief duty was to investigate the jury pool, and Paul Revere, who drew a detailed map of the bodies {{to be used in the}} trial of the British soldiers held responsible. Massachusetts Solicitor General Samuel Quincy and private attorney Robert Treat Paine, hired by the town of Boston, handled the prosecution. Preston was tried separately in late October 1770. He was acquitted after the jury was convinced that he had not ordered the troops to fire.|$|E

5|$|The {{majority}} in the High Court decided that {{although there was no}} right at common law to have publicly provided legal representation in all cases, in some cases representation is appropriate to ensure a <b>fair</b> <b>trial.</b> Although judges no longer have the power to appoint counsel for an accused, since that function has been largely taken over by legal aid agencies, a trial judge should use their power to adjourn a case if it is in the interests of fairness that an accused have representation, which would encourage the legal aid agencies to provide counsel.|$|E
5|$|After the Boston Massacre, Adams {{and other}} town leaders met with Bernard's {{successor}} Governor Thomas Hutchinson and with Colonel William Dalrymple, the army commander, {{to demand the}} withdrawal of the troops. The situation remained explosive, and so Dalrymple agreed to remove both regiments to Castle William. Adams wanted the soldiers to have a <b>fair</b> <b>trial,</b> because this would show that Boston was not controlled by a lawless mob, but was instead the victim of an unjust occupation. He convinced his cousins John Adams and Josiah Quincy to defend the soldiers, knowing that those Whigs would not slander Boston to gain an acquittal. However, Adams wrote essays condemning the outcome of the trials; he thought that the soldiers should have been convicted of murder.|$|E
5|$|After {{years in}} opposition, in 1849, Paraná was {{appointed}} by the national government as president of Pernambuco Province to investigate a Liberal rebellion {{that had taken place}} a year earlier, and seek a <b>fair</b> <b>trial</b> for the rebels. Blamed by his party colleagues for the years in opposition and having lost much of his influence within his own party, Paraná accepted the post, believing he could regain his place among his peers. With the nation internally pacified, he was sent to Uruguay in 1851 to forge an alliance with that country, and with the rebel Argentine provinces of Corrientes and Entre Ríos, against the Argentine Confederation. The alliance triumphed, and the Emperor elevated Paraná to the ranks of the titled nobility.|$|E

40|$|China revised its Criminal Procedure Law in 1996 {{adopting}} an adversarial-style trial {{model and}} granting remarkable procedural safeguards to the accused. Many have {{been tempted to}} conclude that this new law is capable of ensuring <b>fair</b> <b>trials</b> for criminal defendants and thus could improve China's record of human rights protection. This article will argue that, despite some progresses in formality, the new law has been poorly implemented and has failed to fulfill its promise of <b>fair</b> <b>trials.</b> This article will examine two high profile cases in detail to demonstrate how procedural safeguards prescribed by the new law are frequently manipulated by judges, either to pursue efficiency and convenience or to accommodate outside influences such as political concerns, public outrage, personal friendship, or even bribes. These manipulations have caused the essence of <b>fair</b> <b>trials</b> intended to be created by the 1996 law to be largely nonexistent in modern proceedings, {{while at the same}} time allowing interferers to freely produce wrongful verdicts and disproportionate sentences. The reality is that many of these problems are caused by institutional flaws in China's criminal justice system, particularly the absence of a responsible judiciary. However, instead of pinning hopes for reform on unrealistic constitutional changes, this article proposes a technical approach that focuses on restructuring the 1996 law to make criminal trials less vulnerable to manipulation and interference. This technical solution would help to ensure <b>fair</b> <b>trials</b> by relying on the procedure itself rather than on unreliable judges...|$|R

5|$|Declan McCullagh {{asserts that}} during the trial, the judge sealed the entire court file, forbade the defense from issuing subpoenas to witnesses, granted the {{prosecution}} significant latitude in making negative suggestions about Bell's character, and refused requests for a mistrial. McCullagh also asserts that he was subpoenaed by two Treasury Department agents {{to appear before the}} court, without being notified ahead of time as required by federal regulations regarding subpoenas involving the media. Following the conviction, Jim Bell renewed his attempts at firing his court-appointed lawyer, appealing his case to the Supreme Court, and filing civil lawsuits against those he alleges were involved in an orchestrated conspiracy to deny him a <b>fair</b> <b>trial</b> and an unbiased, court-appointed defense counsel; his targets included two judges, at least two prosecutors, and his former probation officers and defense attorneys.|$|E
5|$|Dietrich v The Queen, is an {{important}} legal case, stemming from an incident that took place on 17 December 1986, that was decided in the High Court of Australia on 13 November 1992. It concerned {{the nature of the}} right to a <b>fair</b> <b>trial,</b> and under what circumstances indigent defendants (defendants who cannot afford legal representation) should be provided with legal aid by the state. The case determined that although there is no absolute right to have publicly funded counsel, in most circumstances a judge should grant any request for an adjournment or stay when an accused is unrepresented. It is {{an important}} case in Australian criminal law, and also in Australian constitutional law, since it is one of many cases in which some members of the High Court have found implied human rights in the Australian Constitution.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{damaging}} leaks, {{which appeared}} to originate from conversations between McVeigh and his defense attorneys, emerged. They included a confession {{said to have been}} inadvertently included on a computer disk that was given to the press, which McVeigh believed seriously compromised his chances of getting a <b>fair</b> <b>trial.</b> A gag order was imposed during the trial, prohibiting attorneys on either side from commenting to the press on the evidence, proceedings, or opinions regarding the trial proceedings. The defense was allowed to enter into evidence six pages of a 517-page Justice Department report criticizing the FBI crime laboratory and David Williams, one of the agency's explosives experts, for reaching unscientific and biased conclusions. The report claimed that Williams had worked backward in the investigation rather than basing his determinations on forensic evidence.|$|E

5|$|The {{screening}} of Underbelly in Victoria {{was put into}} jeopardy after last-minute legal proceedings were instituted by the Director of Public Prosecutions, Jeremy Rapke, QC. Rapke secured an urgent viewing of the series, after which he decided to seek an injunction stopping its broadcast in Victoria. A Supreme Court judge called prosecutors and defence lawyers together after serious concerns were raised about whether the show could prejudice {{the jury in the}} trial of Evangelos Goussis, who had pleaded not guilty to the 2004 gangland killing of Lewis Moran. Although Goussis was not named in the series, there were concerns the show could hurt his chance of a <b>fair</b> <b>trial.</b>|$|E
5|$|According to Australian court documents, on 10 January 2006, the Šibenik County Court {{ordered that}} a warrant be issued for Vasiljković's arrest. The {{offences}} listed were two alleged war crimes against prisoners of war, and one alleged war crime against the civilian population. The latter {{are related to}} {{his role in the}} attack on Glina which caused civilian deaths and injuries. He was arrested in Australia in 2006, but as an Australian national, he appealed against extradition to Croatia claiming that he would not get a <b>fair</b> <b>trial</b> there. The appeal was granted by the Federal Court in 2009, and Vasiljković was released. However, the High Court of Australia overturned the decision and Vasiljković was arrested after a 43-day search for him by the police. Subsequently, Vasiljković appealed against his extradition citing other grounds. His extradition was approved by the Minister for Home Affairs Jason Clare in November 2012, however Vasiljković appealed that decision as well. In December 2014, the Federal Court upheld Clare's decision.|$|E
5|$|Following the Rising of the Priests in 1775, {{three of}} the rebellion's leaders were {{executed}} without receiving <b>fair</b> <b>trial.</b> The death penalty was signed by the Castellano under the orders of Grand Master Francisco Ximenes de Texada. Prior to judgement, some of the priests and clerics were locked up in the secretive prisons near the courtroom of the Castallania, some at the Castellania dungeons, and in other Valletta buildings. All those arrested were recorded on the Libro del Carcerati Della Magna Curia Castellania. Among them was Gaetano Mannarino, {{the leader of the}} rebellion. Some of them were condemned to death by strangulation in the dungeons of the Castellania. The whole process went against the conformity of the courts in Malta as the priests were not to be subjected to the Castellania but to the court of the Bishop. Ximenes died a natural death within weeks after the sentences, with some locals believing it was a divine providence for his merciless judgement against the clergy.|$|E
