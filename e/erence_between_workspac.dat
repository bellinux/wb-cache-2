40|$|Th e {{discovery}} in 1993 that apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype infl uenced {{the relative risk}} and age of onset of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) represented a paradigm shift that continues to advance our understanding of AD patho genesis. APOE e 4 accounts for {{at least half of}} all AD cases, and while phenotypic diff <b>erences</b> <b>between</b> APOE genetic subgroups are relatively modest, they nonetheless raise important practical questions for both researchers and clinicians. For trialists, how might APOE genotype infl uence therapeutic as well as adverse outcomes? For clinicians, at what point should APOE genotype infl uence patient management? To put these questions into perspective, let us recall some of the pheno-typic diff <b>erences</b> <b>between</b> APOE-related AD subgroups.

We also aimed to biochemically evaluate the healing eff ects of honey which had been collected from the Blacksea region fl ora on mucosal ulcers resulting in material loss. Th irty wistar rats (± g) were enrolled in this study. Excisional wounds were per-formed in all rats for animal oral mucosal ulcer model.

40|$|This paper aims {{to compare}} and {{contrast}} two types of model (logistic regression and decision tree induction) for the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome using four ordered classi cation categories. Initially, we present the classi cation performance results based on more than two covariates (multivariate case). Our results {{suggest that there is}} no signi cant di <b>erence</b> <b>between</b> the two methods. Further to this investigation, we present a detailed comparison of the structure of bivariate versions of the models. The rst surprising result of this analysis is that the classi cation accuracy of the bivariate models is slightly higher than that of the multivariate ones. In addition, the bivariate models lend themselves to graphical analysis, where the corresponding decision regions can easily be represented in the two-dimensional covariate space. This analysis reveals important structural di <b>erences</b> <b>between</b> the two models. 1...|$|R

Since PISA 2000, reading literacy has been a current topic of German educational policy and it has also been the interest of general public. After a short theoretical introduction, the paper focuses on analyzing the students’ results in reading literacy from 2000 to 2009, stressing the crosssections such as the diff <b>erence</b> <b>between</b> the students of good and poor performance, diff erences related to social origin or gender and diff <b>erences</b> <b>between</b> German students and immigrants.

40|$|Whispering is {{a common}} type of speech which is not often studied in speech technology. Perceptual and {{physiological}} studies show us that whispered speech is subtly di erent from phonated speech, and is surprisingly able to carry {{a tremendous amount of}} information. In this dissertation we con- sider the question: What makes whispering a good form of communication? We examine the di <b>erences</b> <b>between</b> normal phonated speech and whispered speech, and gauge the e ectiveness of state-of-the-art speech recognition al- gorithms at recognizing whisper. Our perceptual experiments add to the literature on the intelligibility of whispered speech. Comparisons with ASR results yield interesting insights into the di <b>erences</b> <b>between</b> the two systems. A method for building speech recognizers for whispered speech using lim- ited whispered speech data is proposed and evaluated. Our approach ef- fectively performs speaker-adaptation for whispered speech acoustic models without needing whispered speech from the target speaker. Results show im- provement over the standard speaker-independent models. Our work opens up additional avenues for research, which are outlined in the conclusions...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe have {{investigated}} the ontogeny of light-driven responses in mouse retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Using a large-scale, high-density multielectrode array, we recorded from hundreds to thousands of RGCs simultaneously at pan-retinal level, including dorsal and ventral locations. Responses to di erent contrasts not only revealed a complex developmental pro le for ON, OFF and ON-OFF responses, but also unveiled di <b>erences</b> <b>between</b> dorsal and ventral RGC responses. At eye-opening, dorsal RGCs of all types were more responsive to light, perhaps indicating an environmental priority to nest viewing for pre-weaning pups. The developmental pro le of ON and OFF responses exhibited antagonistic behaviour, with the strongest ON responses shortly after eye-opening, followed {{by an increase in}} the strength of OFF responses later on. Further, we found that with maturation receptive eld (RF) center sizes decrease, spike-triggered averaged responses to white noise become stronger, and centers become more circular while maintaining di <b>erences</b> <b>between</b> RGC types. We conclude that the maturation of retinal functionality is not spatially homogeneous, likely re ecting ecological requirements that favour earlier maturation of the dorsal retina...|$|R
