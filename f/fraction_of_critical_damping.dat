40|$|It {{is shown}} that the common {{response}} spectrum method for synchronous ground motion can be extended to make it applicable for earthquake response analyses of extended structures experiencing differential out-of-plane ground motion. A relative displacementspectrum for design of first-story columns SDC (T, TT, z, zT, t, d) is defined. In addition to the natural period of the out-of-plane response, T, and the corresponding <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>critical</b> <b>damping,</b> z, this spectrum also depends on the fundamental period of torsional vibrations, TT, and the corresponding <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>critical</b> <b>damping,</b> zT, on the ‘‘travel time,’’ t (of the waves in the soil over {{a distance of about}} one-half the length of the structure), and on a dimensionless factor d, describing the relative response of the first floor. The new spectrum, SDC, can be estimated by using the empirical scaling equations for relative displacement spectra, SD, and for peak ground velocity, vmax. For recorded strong-motion acceleration, and for symmetric buildings, the new spectrum can be computed from Duhamel’s integrals of two uncoupled equations for dynamics equilibrium describing translation and rotation of a two-degree-offreedom system. This representation is accurate when the energy of the strong-motion is carried by waves in the ground the wavelengths of which are one order of magnitude or more longer than the characteristic length of the structure...|$|E

40|$|A modal {{identification}} {{algorithm is}} developed, combining techniques from Second Order Blind Source Separation (SOBSS) and State Space Realization (SSR) theory. In this hybrid algorithm, {{a set of}} correlation matrices is generated using time-shifted, analytic data and assembled into several Hankel matrices. Dissimilar left and right matrices are found, which diagonalize the set of nonhermetian Hankel matrices. The complex-valued modal matrix is obtained from this decomposition. The modal responses, modal auto-correlation functions and discrete-time plant matrix (in state space modal form) are subsequently identified. System eigenvalues are computed from the plant matrix to obtain the natural frequencies and modal <b>fractions</b> <b>of</b> <b>critical</b> <b>damping.</b> Joint Approximate Diagonalization (JAD) of the Hankel matrices enables the under determined (more modes than sensors) problem to be effectively treated without restrictions {{on the number of}} sensors required. Because the analytic signal is used, the redundant complex conjugate pairs are eliminated, reducing the system order (number of modes) to be identified half. This enables smaller Hankel matrix sizes and reduced computational effort. The modal auto-correlation functions provide an expedient means of screening out spurious computational modes or modes corresponding to noise sources, eliminating the need for a consistency diagram. In addition, the {{reduction in the number of}} modes enables the modal responses to be identified when there are at least as many sensors as independent (not including conjugate pairs) modes. A further benefit of the algorithm is that identifica tion of dissimilar left and right diagonalizers preclude the need for windowing of the analytic data. The effectiveness of the new modal identification method is demonstrated using vibration data from a 6 DOF simulation, 4 -story building simulation and the Heritage court tower building. </p...|$|R

40|$|An {{approach}} is developed that simplifies calculation of the dynamic characteristics of a self-acting, gas-lubricated slider bearing system. This technique avoids a lengthy simultaneous solution of the equations of motion of the slider and the time-dependent Reynolds' equation, while providing additional design information that is otherwise unobtainable. The equilibrium pressure distribution in the gas film is obtained using the BunovGalerkin formulation of the finite element method. By considering small perturbations of the slider bearing system about equilibrium, two coupled, second-order partial differential equations are derived, which define the in-phase and out-of-phase perturbation pressures in the gas film. These perturbation pressures are integrated to obtain the frequency dependent, non-symmetrical stiffness and damping matrices for the slider bearing. Using the stiffness and damping properties of the gas bearing and slider support, the equations of motion for the entire slider bearing system are derived. The frequency dependence of the stiffness and damping matrices renders the eigenvalue problem nonlinear, and the eigensolutions are obtained iteratively using Brent's method. Because of the non-symmetrical stiffness and damping matrices, a similarity transformation based {{on the left and}} right modal matrices is used to decouple the equations of motion. This decoupling is approximate because of the frequency dependence of the stiffness and damping matrices, but the resulting damped natural frequencies are shown to be in excellent agreement with published experimental data. <b>Fractions</b> <b>of</b> <b>critical</b> <b>damping</b> obtained for several slider geometries also successfully predict observed instabilities. The mode shapes of slider oscillation, unobtainable with other methods, permit calculation of the center of rotation for the coupled, pitch-heave modes; this information can be used to determine the optimum location for the magnetic transducer. Closed-form solutions are obtained for the response to disk surface displacement, and for the response to a random force applied to the slider body. These forced-response solutions are useful in identifying the <b>critical</b> parameters <b>of</b> slider design. ...|$|R
40|$|Model {{calibration}} is {{a cornerstone}} of the finite element verification and validation procedure, in which {{the credibility of the}} model is substantiated by positive comparison with test data. The calibration problem, in which the minimum deviation between finite element model data and experimental data is searched for, is normally characterized as being a large scale optimization problem with many model parameters to solve for and with deviation metrics that are nonlinear in these parameters. The calibrated parameters need to be found by iterative procedures, starting from initial estimates. Sometimes these procedures get trapped in local deviation function minima and do not converge to the globally optimal calibration solution that is searched for. The reason for such traps is often the multi-modality of the problem which causes eigenmode crossover problems in the iterative variation of parameter settings. This work presents a calibration formulation which gives a smooth deviation metric with a large radius of convergence to the global minimum. A damping equalization method is suggested to avoid the mode correlation and mode pairing problems that need to be solved in many other model updating procedures. By this method, the modal damping of a test data model and the finite element model is set to be the same <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>critical</b> modal <b>damping.</b> Mode pairing for mapping of experimentally found damping to the finite element model is thus not needed. The method is combined with model reduction for efficiency and employs the Levenberg-Marquardt minimizer with randomized starts to achieve the calibration solution.
