50|$|Producer Herman Cohen {{was making}} Horrors of the Black Museum in England for AIP. James H. Nicholson from AIP {{requested}} a second film {{in order to}} make a double feature; it had to be made cheaply and in black and white. Cohen:I told him I'd see what I could come up with. I started thinking, 'What the hell can I do?", and I thought maybe I should do a comedy. So Aben Kandel and I wrote this picture... I got great publicity for using Richard Lyon in one of the leads—Louella Parsons gave us a headline story—because he was Bebe Daniels and Ben Lyon's son, who was acting in London. I met him and he needed a job badly, so we hired him. We knocked out that picture very, very fast; that's why the running time is so short, like sixty-five minutes. The director, Peter Graham Scott, was a film editor in London who always wanted to direct, and I needed somebody to do a fast job under my guidance. In fact, we started Headless Ghost as I was still <b>finishing</b> <b>Black</b> Museum, editing and cutting it. But I honestly don't recall too much else about this picture, it was so bad.The film was shot at the same studio as Horror of the Black Museum with some additional location work at an actual castle.|$|E
