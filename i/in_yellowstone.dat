5|$|Of {{the many}} {{decisions}} made by Captain Boutelle in managing the park, his approach to fisheries had significant and lasting impact. Boutelle was an avid angler and recognized the angling potential <b>in</b> <b>Yellowstone</b> waters. In 1889 he suggested the U.S. Fish Commission consider stocking many of the fish-less lakes and streams <b>in</b> <b>Yellowstone.</b>|$|E
5|$|At least 1,283 geysers have erupted <b>in</b> <b>Yellowstone</b> National Park, Wyoming, United States, and {{an average}} of 465 geysers are active there in a given year. A geyser's eruptive {{activity}} may change or cease due to ongoing mineral deposition within the geyser plumbing, exchange of functions with nearby hot springs, earthquake influences, and human intervention.|$|E
5|$|During World WarII, tourist travel fell sharply, {{staffing}} was cut, {{and many}} facilities fell into disrepair. By the 1950s, visitation increased tremendously <b>in</b> <b>Yellowstone</b> and other national parks. To accommodate the increased visitation, park officials implemented Mission66, {{an effort to}} modernize and expand park service facilities. Planned {{to be completed by}} 1966, in honor of the 50th anniversary of the founding of the National Park Service, Mission66 construction diverged from the traditional log cabin style with design features of a modern style. During the late 1980s, most construction styles <b>in</b> <b>Yellowstone</b> reverted to the more traditional designs. After the enormous forest fires of 1988 damaged much of Grant Village, structures there were rebuilt in the traditional style. The visitor center at Canyon Village, which opened in 2006, incorporates a more traditional design as well.|$|E
5|$|Thermus aquaticus is a {{bacterium}} found <b>in</b> the <b>Yellowstone</b> hot springs that produces an important enzyme (Taq polymerase) that is easily replicated {{in the lab}} and is useful in replicating DNA {{as part of the}} polymerase chain reaction (PCR) process. The retrieval of these bacteria can be achieved with no impact to the ecosystem. Other bacteria <b>in</b> the <b>Yellowstone</b> hot springs may also prove useful to scientists who are searching for cures for various diseases. In 2016, researchers from Uppsala University reported the discovery of a class of thermophiles, Hadesarchaea, <b>in</b> <b>Yellowstone's</b> Culex Basin. These organisms are capable of converting carbon monoxide and water to carbon dioxide and oxygen.|$|R

5|$|Eighteen {{species of}} fish live <b>in</b> <b>Yellowstone,</b> {{including}} the core range of the Yellowstone cutthroat trout—a fish highly sought by anglers. The Yellowstone cutthroat trout has faced several threats since the 1980s, including the suspected illegal introduction into Yellowstone Lake of lake trout, an invasive species which consume the smaller cutthroat trout. Although lake trout were established in Shoshone and Lewis lakes in the Snake River drainage from U.S. Government stocking operations in 1890, it was never officially introduced into the Yellowstone River drainage. The cutthroat trout has also faced an ongoing drought, {{as well as the}} accidental introduction of a parasite—whirling disease—which causes a terminal nervous system disease in younger fish. Since 2001, all native sport fish species caught <b>in</b> <b>Yellowstone</b> waterways are subject to a catch and release law. Yellowstone is also home to six species of reptiles, such as the painted turtle and Prairie rattlesnake, and four species of amphibians, including the Boreal Chorus Frog.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, {{after several}} years of public {{controversy}} regarding the forced reduction of the elk population <b>in</b> <b>Yellowstone,</b> United States Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall appointed an advisory board to collect scientific data to inform future wildlife management of the national parks. In a paper known as the Leopold Report, the committee observed that culling programs at other national parks had been ineffective, and recommended management of Yellowstone's elk population.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many species}} of the genus Suillus, S.brevipes is edible, and the {{mushroom}} is considered choice by some. The odor is mild, and the taste mild or slightly acidic.

The mushrooms are common in the diet of grizzly bears <b>in</b> <b>Yellowstone</b> National Park.|$|E

5|$|The adult bobcat has few predators {{other than}} humans, {{although}} it may be killed in interspecific conflict. Cougars and gray wolves can kill adult bobcats, a behavior repeatedly observed <b>in</b> <b>Yellowstone</b> National Park. Coyotes have killed adult bobcats and kittens. At least one confirmed observation of a bobcat and an American black bear (Ursus americanus) fighting over a carcass is confirmed.|$|E
5|$|Yellowstone {{forests are}} {{dominated}} by the lodgepole pine and are eventually replaced by other tree species after 80 to 100years as a forest matures. <b>In</b> <b>Yellowstone,</b> a very short growing season due to high altitude and relatively poor soils allows the lodgepole pine to reach ages approaching three hundred years before other trees such as Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir become established. The lodgepole pines found throughout the Yellowstone Plateau high country grow in uninterrupted dense stands averaging similar ages in various groupings. Though trees normally found in more mature forests do occur, they are not found in large stands as in other forests in the Rocky Mountains. By the 1980s much of the lodgepole pine forests <b>in</b> <b>Yellowstone</b> were between 200 and 250years old and approaching {{the end of their}} lifecycle.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the cavalry}} had been {{successful}} in protecting the park, by 1914 the average soldier was not cutout for the strenuous, diplomatic and tedious nature of the work, and {{the high level of}} training related to cavalry skills. World War I added further impetus to a transition back to civilian management, to relieve the army of a duty that could be performed by civilian rangers. In July 1914, the 1st Cavalry was withdrawn from Yellowstone and replaced with a composite unit of 200 cavalrymen from throughout the army, many of whom had served <b>in</b> <b>Yellowstone</b> previously.|$|E

5|$|Coat color {{ranges from}} almost pure white through various shades of blond, cream, and ochre to grays, browns, and blacks, with {{variation}} in fur color tending {{to increase in}} higher latitudes. Differences in coat color between sexes are largely absent, though females may have redder tones. Black-colored wolves in North America inherited the Kb allele responsible for melanism from past interbreeding with dogs, while the mutation {{was found to be}} naturally occurring in wolves from Iran. Black specimens are more common in North America than in Eurasia, with about half the wolves <b>in</b> <b>Yellowstone</b> National Park being black.|$|E
5|$|Human {{history of}} the Grand Teton region dates back at least 11,000years, when the first nomadic {{hunter-gatherer}} Paleo-Indians began migrating into the region during warmer months pursuing food and supplies. In the early 19thcentury, the first White explorers encountered the eastern Shoshone natives. Between 1810 and 1840, the region attracted fur trading companies that vied {{for control of the}} lucrative beaver pelt trade. U.S. Government expeditions to the region commenced in the mid-19thcentury as an offshoot of exploration <b>in</b> <b>Yellowstone,</b> with the first permanent white settlers in Jackson Hole arriving in the 1880s.|$|E
5|$|The Snake River Plain is a {{volcanic}} province {{that was created}} {{by a series of}} cataclysmic caldera-forming eruptions which started about 15 million years ago. A migrating hotspot thought to now exist under Yellowstone Caldera <b>in</b> <b>Yellowstone</b> National Park has been implicated. This hot spot was under the Craters of the Moon area some 10 to 11million years ago but 'moved' as the North American Plate migrated southwestward. Pressure from the hot spot heaves the land surface up, creating fault-block mountains. After the hot spot passes the pressure is released and the land subsides.|$|E

5|$|The {{recovery}} from the fires began almost immediately, with plants such as fireweed appearing {{in a matter of}} days after a fire had passed. While surrounding national forests did some replanting and even dispersed grass seed by airplane, the regeneration <b>in</b> <b>Yellowstone</b> was generally so complete that no replanting was even attempted. Though some small plants did not immediately reassume their pre-fire habitats, most did, and the vast majority of plants regrew from existing sprouts which survived the heat from the fires. There was a profusion of wildflowers in burned areas, especially between two and fiveyears after the fires.|$|E
5|$|There {{are dozens}} of species of {{flowering}} plants that have been identified, most of which bloom between the months of May and September. The Yellowstone sand verbena is a rare flowering plant found only <b>in</b> <b>Yellowstone.</b> It {{is closely related to}} species usually found in much warmer climates, making the sand verbena an enigma. The estimated 8,000 examples of this rare flowering plant all make their home in the sandy soils on the shores of Yellowstone Lake, well above the waterline.|$|E
5|$|After {{several years}} of public {{controversy}} regarding the forced reduction of the elk population <b>in</b> <b>Yellowstone</b> National Park, Udall appointed an advisory board to collect scientific data to inform future wildlife management of the national parks. The committee observed that culling programs at other national parks had been ineffective, and recommended different management of Yellowstone's elk population. In addressing the goals, policies, and methods of managing wildlife in the parks, the report suggested {{that in addition to}} protection, wildlife populations should be managed and regulated to prevent habitat degradation. Touching upon predator control, fire ecology, and other issues, the report suggested that the National Park Service (NPS) hire scientists to manage the parks using current scientific research.|$|E

5|$|Colder weather, {{bringing}} with it rain and snow on September 11 calmed the fires down substantially throughout the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Though the fires continued to burn {{well into the}} middle of November, they never again posed an immediate risk to life or property. Many fire crews were sent home, but additional manpower continued to arrive at Yellowstone to rehabilitate areas that had been affected by the firefighting efforts. Hundreds of miles of firelines, helicopter landing zones and fire camps needed to be restored to a more natural state, and thousands of hazardous dead trees needed to be cut down to protect roads and buildings. Finally, on November 18, all fires <b>in</b> <b>Yellowstone</b> were officially declared out.|$|E
5|$|For {{three months}} in 1985, 3,000 minor {{earthquakes}} were detected in the northwestern section of the park, during what {{has been referred to}} as an earthquake swarm, and has been attributed to minor subsidence of the Yellowstone caldera. Beginning on April 30, 2007, 16 small earthquakes with magnitudes up to 2.7 occurred in the Yellowstone Caldera for several days. These swarms of earthquakes are common, and there have been 70 such swarms between 1983 and 2008. In December 2008, over 250 earthquakes were measured over a four-day span under Yellowstone Lake, the largest measuring a magnitude of 3.9. In January 2010, more than 250 earthquakes were detected over a two-day period. Seismic activity <b>in</b> <b>Yellowstone</b> National Park continues and is reported hourly by the Earthquake Hazards Program of the U.S. Geological Survey.|$|E
5|$|Foresters and ecologists {{argue that}} large {{controlled}} burns <b>in</b> <b>Yellowstone</b> {{prior to the}} fires would not have greatly reduced the area that was consumed in 1988. Controlled burns would quickly become uncontrolled if {{they were allowed to}} burn with the intensity that many tree and plant communities need for proper regeneration. Consequently, natural fires, rather than controlled burns, are the park's primary maintenance tool. Since the late 1970s, some 300 natural fires have been allowed to burn themselves out. In rare circumstances, natural fires are supplemented by controlled burns that are deliberately started to remove dead timber under conditions which allow fire fighters an opportunity to carefully control where and how much wood fuel is consumed.|$|E
