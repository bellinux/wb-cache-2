25|$|In 1886, the {{department}} hired {{its first two}} black officers, Robert William Stewart and Roy Green.. The LAPD {{was one of the}} first two police departments in the country to hire an African-American woman officer, Georgia Ann Robinson in 1919. Despite this, {{the department}} was slow at integration. During the 1965 Watts riots, only 5 of the 205 police assigned to South Central Los Angeles were black, despite the fact that it was the largest black community in Los Angeles. Los Angeles' first black mayor Tom Bradley was an ex-police officer and quit the department after being unable to advance past the rank of lieutenant like other black police officers in the department. When Bradley was elected mayor in 1972, only 5% of LAPD officers were black and there was only one black captain in the department, Homer Broome. Broome would break down racial barriers on the force going on to become first black officer to obtain the rank of commander and the <b>first</b> <b>black</b> <b>to</b> command a police station, the Southwest Division which included historically black neighborhoods of South Central Los Angeles in 1975.|$|E

[...] He was the first university-trained African-American physician in the United States.

500|$|As {{a first-year}} student, Higginbotham {{worked as a}} {{research}} assistant to a professor, who arranged for him to attend the oral arguments in Sweatt v. Painter, which dealt with the admission of blacks to the University of Texas. Thurgood Marshall argued the case on behalf of Herman Sweatt, who had been denied admission to the University's Law School. Higginbotham would later describe the experience of seeing Marshall arguing: [...] "With controlled outrage, Marshall eloquently asserted the constitutional promise of equality for Sweatt, for all African Americans and, it seemed, for me personally." [...] When the Court ruled in Sweatt's favor, Higginbotham later wrote, {{he felt that he}} had [...] "witnessed the birth of racial justice in the Supreme Court." [...] Higginbotham received his LL.B. from Yale in 1952. In 1969, as the <b>first</b> <b>black</b> <b>to</b> become a trustee of Yale, he advocated opening the university's undergraduate program to women.|$|E
500|$|One summer, Bailey and Angelou made {{separate}} {{trips to}} visit their father in San Diego, in what Kirkus Reviews called [...] "a seriously ugly meeting". [...] Angelou did not get along with her stepmother. [...] During her visit, her father took Angelou to Mexico; he became so drunk, she had to drive him back across the border, {{even though she had}} never driven a car before. [...] When they returned to San Diego, Angelou's stepmother cut Angelou with a pair of scissors during an argument. [...] Angelou chose to live on the streets until her wound was healed. [...] When she returned to San Francisco, she decided she wanted a job as a streetcar conductor; at first, she was not hired because she was Black, but upon her mother's encouragement, she was persistent with the streetcar company until she became the <b>first</b> <b>Black</b> <b>to</b> work on the railway.

2500|$|The Bohemian Club {{did make}} a push in 1970 for blacks to join up. Some, like Ernest J. Gaines, the <b>first</b> <b>black</b> <b>to</b> be awarded a {{creative}} writing fellowship at Stanford University, declined to join because he was [...] "just sort of tired {{of being the first}} to go into things," [...] and he doubted he [...] "would have found people with whom he could discuss [...] Hemingway." [...] Cecil Poole, who was a black federal appeals judge, also would not join.|$|E
2500|$|Blacks enjoyed full {{fellowship}} in {{the church}} — holding priesthood office included — up until 1849 when Brigham Young, the prophet of the church at the time, issued a church-wide ban on blacks being {{able to have the}} priesthood. Young would then make the earliest known statement declaring a black priesthood ban, stating, [...] "The Lord had cursed Cain's seed with blackness and prohibited them the priesthood." [...] This decision may have been brought about by the actions of William McCary, an African American convert to the church who believed he was a prophet and claimed on various occasions to be Jesus and Adam, father of the human race. McCary was also known to perform sealings in his own house and was later excommunicated in 1847. Despite this banning of priesthood rights, many blacks were still able to hold church office and lead congregations. Joseph T. Ball, for example, was the leader of a Boston congregation, and supposedly the <b>first</b> <b>black</b> <b>to</b> do so. Abel himself also enjoyed opportunities for involvement {{in the church}} after this declaration. He completed three missions for the church: one in the 1830s, one in the 1840s, and the last in his local area in 1843. In addition, as the church moved out West, Mormons were exposed to a larger population of blacks and anti-black political attitudes continued to increase. Other influential black members include Black Pete, a member who came to Ohio and later became notorious for claiming to be a revelator. He was later disfellowshipped by Joseph Smith because of his false teachings. One Q. Walker Lewis from Lowell, Massachusetts also found himself a item of scrutiny during this period. Lewis was ordained an elder by William Smith, Joseph Smith Jr.'s younger brother. By 1847, his authority was challenged despite his being well-respected in the church community.|$|E
60|$|I {{made him}} as {{comfortable}} as possible, and despairing of learning anything from him in his present state, I let him sleep. Then I {{went out into the}} rain, very anxious, and dreading what he might have to tell me when he woke. I waded and jumped my way as near to the farm as I dared go, and Waster Lunny, seeing me, came to the water's edge. At this part the breadth of the flood was not forty yards, yet for a time our voices could no more cross its roar than one may send a snowball through a stone wall. I know not whether the river then quieted for a space, or if it was only that the ears grow used to dins as the eyes distinguish the objects in a room that is at <b>first</b> <b>black</b> <b>to</b> them; but after a little we were able to shout our remarks across, much as boys fling pebbles, many to fall into the water, but one occasionally to reach the other side. Waster Lunny would have talked of the flood, but I had not come here for that.|$|E
