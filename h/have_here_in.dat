500|$|Domestically, the Cold War {{was in the}} {{forefront}} of national consciousness. In February 1950, Senator Joseph McCarthy rose suddenly to national fame when he claimed [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> my hand a list" [...] of over 200 communists who were employed in the State Department. McCarthy made the claim in The Wheeling speech. In September 1950, the USCongress passed the McCarran Internal Security Act, which required communist organizations to register with the government, and formed the Subversive Activities Control Board to investigate persons suspected of engaging in subversive activities. High-profile hearings involving alleged communists included the 1950 conviction of Alger Hiss, the 1951 trial of the Rosenbergs, and the 1954 investigation of J. Robert Oppenheimer.|$|E
500|$|McCarthy {{experienced}} a meteoric rise in national profile on February 9, 1950, {{when he gave}} a Lincoln Day speech to the Republican Women's Club of Wheeling, West Virginia. His words in the speech are {{a matter of some}} debate, as no audio recording was saved. However, it is generally agreed that he produced a piece of paper that he claimed contained a list of known Communists working for the State Department. McCarthy is usually quoted to have said: [...] "The State Department is infested with communists. I <b>have</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> my hand a list of 205—a list of names that were made known to the Secretary of State as being members of the Communist Party and who nevertheless are still working and shaping policy in the State Department." ...|$|E

500|$|The Senators were {{particularly}} interested in how Bolshevism had united many disparate elements on the left, including anarchists and socialists of many types, [...] "providing a common platform for all these radical groups to stand on." [...] Senator Knute Nelson of Minnesota responded: [...] "Then they have really rendered a service to the various classes of progressives and reformers that we <b>have</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> this country." [...] Other witnesses described {{the horrors of the}} revolution in Russia and speculated on the consequences of a comparable revolution in the United States: the imposition of atheism, the seizure of newspapers, assaults on banks and the abolition of the insurance industry. The Senators heard various views of women in Russia, including claims that women were made the property of the state.|$|E
2500|$|Justice Kennedy also concurred, and {{proposed}} yet another test. [...] He {{wrote that he}} [...] "would apply a narrower test applicable only in the infrequent case, such as we <b>have</b> <b>here,</b> <b>in</b> which the two-step interrogation technique was used in a calculated way to undermine the Miranda warning." [...] If a two-step procedure was deliberately used, the subsequent statement would be inadmissible unless the police [...] "cured" [...] the problem by taking measures that would enable the suspect to distinguish the first interrogation from the second [...] "and appreciate that the interrogation has taken a new turn." [...] Kennedy suggested that a long break between the two interrogations would usually be sufficient, as would an explanation to the suspect that the first statement would probably be inadmissible in court.|$|E
