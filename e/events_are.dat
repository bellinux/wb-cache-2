5|$|Impact <b>events</b> <b>are</b> {{continually}} occurring on {{the lunar}} surface. The most common <b>events</b> <b>are</b> {{those associated with}} micrometeorites, as might be encountered during meteor showers.

Furthermore, impact clouds were detected following the crash of ESA's SMART-1 spacecraft, India's Moon Impact Probe and NASA's LCROSS. Impact events leave a visible scar on the surface, and these could be detected by analyzing before and after photos of sufficiently high resolution. No impact craters formed between the Clementine (global resolution 100 metre, selected areas 7-20 metre) and SMART-1 (resolution 50 metre) missions have been identified.|$|E

5|$|In general, La Niña <b>events</b> <b>are</b> {{associated}} with lower temperatures (particularly colder winters) in the Pampas. During winter, frosts are more common during La Niña events compared to El Niño events. This {{is due to a}} stronger southerly flow during La Niña events caused by a higher concentration of high pressure systems in the South Pacific and an increase in cyclonic activity (more low pressure systems) in the South Atlantic. This creates conditions that are favourable for bringing cold air from the south, particularly when there is a formation of a high pressure system over Patagonia ({{associated with}} the passage of a front) that is responsible for bringing cold air from the south. Thus, invasions of cold air from the south are more common during La Niña events. In contrast, warm spells in the Pampas and northern parts of the country are more intense and frequent during El Niño events. This is due to stronger westerly winds south of 40oS, leading to less frequent incursions of cold air from the south while enhancing winds from the north that bring in warm air. Although La Niña events lead to colder winters with more frequent incursions of cold air in both the north and central parts of the country, it leads to more frequent and intense warm spells in the last months of the year. In other regions, El Niño events lead to more frequent and intense warm spells in Northwest Argentina (during autumn), northeast Argentina (during spring) and central Argentina (during summer). Cold air anomalies arising from El Niño <b>events</b> <b>are</b> observed during spring and are the result of an increase in rainfall that lead to reductions in insolation. For the southern parts of the country, El Niño <b>events</b> <b>are</b> associated with more intense and frequent cold spells during the coldest months. In summer, El Niño <b>events</b> <b>are</b> associated with warmer summer temperatures in the southern parts of the country.|$|E
5|$|In principle, the {{simultaneous}} occurrence of a Solar eclipse and a transit {{of a planet}} is possible. But these <b>events</b> <b>are</b> extremely rare because of their short durations.

5|$|In the synoptics, the {{ministry}} of Jesus takes a single year, but in John it takes three, as evidenced by references to three Passovers. <b>Events</b> <b>are</b> not {{all in the same}} order: the date of the crucifixion is different, as is the time of Jesus' anointing in Bethany, and the cleansing of the temple occurs in the beginning of Jesus' ministry rather than near its end.|$|E
