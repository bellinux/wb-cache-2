5|$|Both {{species of}} Knoetschkesuchus {{have only two}} {{distinct}} types of teeth, uniquely among atoposaurids. Other atoposaurids <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> type of leaf-shaped teeth. The first type of teeth, found {{near the front of}} the jaw, are conical, slightly constricted at the base, and curved slightly inwards. A subtype is represented by the canine-like or pseudocaniniform teeth. They are the fourth and fifth maxillary teeth, and are enlarged (about twice the size of the other maxillary teeth), more pointed, and more constricted at the base. The second type of teeth, which constitutes the rest of the teeth, are shaped like thin lanceheads, with a wide base and a narrower tip; in K. guimarotae all of the tips are sharp, but in K. langenbergensis they gradually become blunter.|$|E

5|$|The {{microstructure}} of Gobioolithus eggshell has {{not been}} thoroughly studied, and heavy recrystallization of most specimens {{makes it difficult to}} examine the eggshell structure or pore system. The eggshell consists of two (or possibly three) structural layers. The inner layer, called the mammillary layer, is about half the thickness of the outer, or continuous, layer. On the outside, many specimens have a recrystallized outer layer. This could simply due to diagenesis or it could be a true external zone, which is a third layer present in most bird eggs but is rare in non-avian dinosaurs. However, a few specimens are unaffected by recrystallization. These do not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> layer, but this does not {{rule out the possibility that}} the eggshell originally had a three layers since the external layer can easily separate from the rest of the eggshell. These specimens also reveal an angusticanaliculate pore system, which means that the pores have a low density, and are long, narrow, and straight.|$|E
5|$|At the 2009 TGS event, it was {{revealed}} that Hope's silver hair was meant for Lightning, but when her hair color was decided as pink, Hope received the silver hair coloring instead. Hope's Academy uniform for XIII-2 was designed by Hideo Minaba. While he was portrayed as sensitive and vulnerable in XIII, for XIII-2, the game's director wished to portray Hope as a more mature, authoritative person. According to Toriyama, how Hope matured, as seen through Lightning's eyes, formed one of the main story themes for Lightning Returns. He was originally going to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> unique design for the game, but the team eventually decided to settle on his original teenage appearance. In a later interview, he said that while the character was much liked by the team, he felt that Hope lacked the heroic image that could make him a leading character. Watanabe later said that he felt Hope helped complete Lightning's character and enable her to grow as a person. Hope is voiced by Vincent Martella in English and Yūki Kaji in Japanese.|$|E

25|$|Next, the two plastid-dividing rings, or PD rings form. The inner plastid-dividing ring {{is located}} in the inner side of the {{chloroplast}}'s inner membrane, and is formed first. The outer plastid-dividing ring is found wrapped around the outer chloroplast membrane. It consists of filaments about 5 nanometers across, arranged in rows 6.4 nanometers apart, and shrinks to squeeze the chloroplast. This is when chloroplast constriction begins. In a few species like Cyanidioschyzon merolæ, chloroplasts <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> plastid-dividing ring located in the chloroplast's intermembrane space.|$|E

25|$|Hepburn met {{her second}} husband, Italian {{psychiatrist}} Andrea Dotti, on a Mediterranean cruise {{with friends in}} June 1968. She believed she would have more children and possibly stop working. They married on 18 January 1969; their son, Luca Dotti, was born on 8 February 1970. While pregnant with Luca in 1969, Hepburn was more careful, resting for months before delivering the baby via caesarean section. She wanted to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> child, but had another miscarriage in 1974. Dotti was unfaithful {{and she had a}} romantic relationship with actor Ben Gazzara during the filming of the 1979 movie Bloodline.

We would {{certainly}} not take a redshirt off Sherrod Harris at this point; it would be unfair for him because he has sat this year with the idea that he'll start the spring as a redshirt freshman. And then Mack (Brown) and I will sit down and discuss the possibility of an emergency situation as we've done in the past; one year Tony Jeffrey worked as quarterback for us because he had played quarterback in high school. So we'll sit down and look at some different options as to which way we would go. It would certainly be somebody that we think can run the offense and have a limited package for those guys. I don't think we'll need an emergency quarterback, but we'll certainly <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> guy ready.|$|E
25|$|Notches {{on top of}} the {{cassette}} shell indicate the type of tape. Type I cassettes have only write-protect notches, Type II have an additional pair next to the write protection ones, and Type IV (metal) <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> set near the middle of the top of {{the cassette}} shell. These allow later cassette decks to detect the tape type automatically and select the proper bias and equalization. Virtually all recent hi-fi systems (with cassette decks) lack this feature; only a small niche of cassette decks (hi-fi separates) have the tape type selector. Playing Type II and IV tapes on a player without detection will produce exaggerated treble, {{but it may not be}} noticeable because such devices typically have amplifiers that lack extended high-frequency output. Recording on these units, however, results in very low sound reproduction, and sometimes distortion and noise is heard. Also, these cheaper units cannot erase high bias or metal bias tapes. Attempting to do so will result in an incomplete erasure. This is due to the fact that the bias levels for high and metal position require greater levels.|$|E
25|$|Marcel Proulx {{resigned}} as Dion's Quebec lieutenant {{hours before the}} Harper government's throne speech, taking the fall for the three by-election losses. Dion first approached Montreal MPs Denis Coderre and Pablo Rodriguez to succeed Proulx, but they declined. That evening he named Senator Céline Hervieux-Payette to the vacant post. While the Party was divided {{on whether or not}} the government should be toppled on a confidence vote regarding the Throne Speech, Dion mentioned in a statement in the House of Commons on 17 October that the Liberals will support the Throne Speech but with major amendments including the Kyoto Protocol and the end of mission in Afghanistan by 2009 and had criticized the government on several aspects including the economy, seniors and child poverty, the crime policy, the Senate reform. The latter amendment proposal was rejected by the New Democratic Party who are favouring an immediate end to the mission. Dion explained the decision as that Canadians are not willing to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> election in just over three years. All Liberal members abstained from voting on the Throne Speech on 24 October 2007, which passed 126–79.|$|E

He further claimed {{that he did not know}} the mother, and she did not know him. The pop star added that in asking for a surrogate mother, he did not care how old she was or what race she was. It did, however, matter to him that she was intelligent, healthy, and had uncorrected eyesight.|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{after the end}} of the series. Keith DeCandido {{reviewed}} the episode for Tor.com in July 2011. He highlighted the appearance of Vincent Schiavelli, saying that he [...] "totally owns every scene he’s in". He thought that the situation which left La Forge in charge of the Enterprise was [...] "horribly contrived" [...] and said [...] "Picard doesn’t even give a good excuse for going down to the planet beyond the script calling for it". He gave the episode a score of six out of ten, summing up that it was a [...] "fun, enjoyable, diverting episode". Zack Handlen reviewed the episode in May 2010 for The A.V. Club. He criticised the episode, saying that there [...] "are all kinds of problems, the biggest being that the episode doesn't really <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> act, but the moral superiority of the crew is on full display, and it's frustrating." [...] He summed up the moral story played out in this episode, saying that [...] "On TOS, Kirk, Spock, and McCoy would've hashed out the appeal of an unbeatable weapon as well as its drawbacks. Here, we're all supposed to know that violence begets violence, and that's it." [...] He gave the episode a grade of C+.|$|E
500|$|On Riven Atrus meets Catherine, a local {{inhabitant}} and {{a brilliant}} student of Gehn's who shows promise in the Art of writing Ages, despite not being D'ni herself. Together they trap Gehn on Riven. Atrus' grandmother, Anna ("Ti'ana"), helps Catherine by writing the Age of Myst as an escape route while Atrus destroys every other linking book on Riven. [...] The linking book to Myst is {{dropped into a}} starry expanse known as the Star Fissure, where it is presumed lost (but later found by the Stranger, beginning the events of Myst). Catherine and Atrus start a family on Myst, raising their two sons, Sirrus and Achenar; however, both boys grow greedy and seek to strand their parents, trapping Atrus on K'veer (an island in the cavern near the main D'ni city) and luring Catherine to Riven, where she is captured by Gehn.
