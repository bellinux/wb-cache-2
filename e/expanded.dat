40|$|Abstract. In this paper, the {{influence}} of the types and addition dose of MgO <b>expanding</b> agent and the age of cement on expansion value and expansion performance of cement based material added with MgO <b>expanding</b> agent was systematically studied. The expansion characteristics of cement based material added with MgO <b>expanding</b> agent or calcium sulphoaluminate <b>expanding</b> agent were compared. The expansion of such material increases with the addition dose of MgO <b>expanding</b> agent and cement mortar age. During the test period, the expansion of cement based material increases continuously. The light-burned MgO <b>expanding</b> agent modified by CaO <b>expanding</b> agent is able to increase the 28 d expansion of such material effectively. The temperature of calcination for the heavy-burned MgO <b>expanding</b> agent is higher than that of light-burned one, thus the heavy-burned MgO <b>expanding</b> agent has a rather dense structure with slow hydration rate and gives a small expansion of the cement based material at early age, showing an obvious expansion delay. The calcium sulphoaluminate <b>expanding</b> agent gives most expansion of the material in the early 28 d and there is small expansion at middle and later age of the material...|$|R

40|$|WO 2003069002 A UPAB: 20030910 NOVELTY - Production of an {{expandable}} metal body comprises compacting {{a mixture}} containing {{at least one}} metal {{and at least one}} gas-splitting <b>expanding</b> agent to form a semi-finished product, in which the particles of the metal are tightly bound to one another and form a gas-tight seal for gas particles released from the gas <b>expanding</b> agent. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - A mixture of powdered or liquid metal and powdered or liquid metal-containing <b>expanding</b> agent intermediate material is treated with a liquid or gaseous non metal-containing <b>expanding</b> agent intermediate material. The non metal-containing <b>expanding</b> agent intermediate material is added to the metal-containing <b>expanding</b> agent intermediate material to form the <b>expanding</b> agent. Preferred Features: The non metal-containing <b>expanding</b> agent intermediate material is a hydrating agent and the <b>expanding</b> agent is a metal hydride. The hydrating agent is hydrogen gas or a gas mixture containing hydrogen. The reaction of the non metal-containing <b>expanding</b> agent intermediate material with the metal -containing <b>expanding</b> agent intermediate material is carried out at 300 - 700, preferably 400 - 600 deg.

The Maryland State Highway Administration (MDSHA) is upgrading the last remaining two-lane portions of US113 between Snow Hill and Berlin to a four-lane divided highway.

The Delaware Department of Transportation (DelDOT) plans to upgrade US113 to a freeway from Selbyville to Ellendale; a freeway bypass of Milford was cancelled in 2008 because of community opposition.|$|E
