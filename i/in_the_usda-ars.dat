40|$|ABSTRACT. In {{conservation}} tillage systems, belowground soil disruption should be maximized while aboveground disruption should be minimized. To assist {{in choosing the}} best shank for strip-tillage systems, comparisons among several shanks commonly used to provide in-row subsoiling prior to planting in conservation systems were made. A three-dimensional dynamometer measured draft, vertical, and side forces for the experiments, which were conducted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>USDA-ARS</b> National Soil Dynamics Laboratory soil bins in Auburn, Alabama. A portable tillage profiler measured both above- and belowground soil disruption. Two parameters, spoil resistance index and trench specific resistance, were developed from the data to assess draft force, aboveground soil disruption and belowground soil disruption. Based on these selection criteria, the two best shanks for {{conservation tillage}} systems were the Bigham Brothers Paratill shank and the Worksaver Terramax shank, {{both of which were}} bentleg shanks...|$|E

A network of microlysimeters was deployed at Kendall to measure daily soil evaporation (ED), and an empirical model was developed to predict ED based on soil moisture (θ) measured at 5 cm depth and average daily solar radiation (L). Results confirmed that total evapotranspiration over the growing season (ETS) was a function of season-long infiltration (IS) regardless of vegetation type, where ETS/IS was close to one. For years of similar precipitation patterns and ETS/IS, the contribution of evaporation E to ET for the growing season (ES/ETS) doubled with the invasion of E. lehmanniana.

Nine accessions were mixed for presence or absence of amylose. Twenty-four of the 28 accessions confirmed to be waxy by negative iodine staining for amylose had no detectable GBSS using sodium dodecyl-sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (wxa), and four were show to contain GBSS (wxb). Mean gelatinization onset, peak, and end temperatures were significantly lower for wild-type than either of the two waxy genotypes. Mean gelatinization onset temperature was slightly higher for waxy-GBSS+ genotypes than waxy-GBSS− genotypes.

To determine the mechanisms involved in the sorption process, herbicide-organoclay complexes were characterized by x-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). In general, the d 001 values of SAz-HDTMA and SAz-ODA organoclays expanded after herbicide saturation, indicating interlayer sorption of the herbicide. Also, FTIR spectroscopic studies suggested weak Hydrophobic interactions between these herbicides and the interlayer organic phase of the organoclays. However, H bonding between these herbicides and the monosubstituted amino group in SAz-ODA reinforced the strength of the hydrophobic interactions resulting in nonreadily reversible sorption on that organoclay.

This {{is especially true for}} management of reservoir storage and water releases during {{and at the end of}} the dry season when water demand is highest and streamflow supply is lowest. Anticipating streamflow amounts based on seasonal precipitation forecasts holds promise to estimate the probability of replenishment of depleted reservoir storage and helps identify best water supply management strategies related to anticipated streamflow and associated uncertainties. A study was conducted to evaluate the impact of hypothetical seasonal variations in precipitation on streamflow.

Test results of this study indicate that hypothetical precipitation forecasts that are drier than normal lead to streamflow responses that approach baseflow conditions on the watershed, while forecasts that are wetter than normal lead to higher streamflow value...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Measurement of soil {{compaction}} caused by vehicle loading {{is difficult and}} often subject to extreme variability. Two types of soil transducers were compared in an experiment conducted in a Norfolk sandy loam soil <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>USDA-ARS</b> National Soil Dynamics Laboratory’s (NSDL) soil bin facilities. Stress-state transducers (SSTs), electronic transducers developed at the NSDL for measuring six directional pressures and determining the stress state, were used for this experiment. Rubber bulbs connected by a rubber hose to a dial pressure gauge, which measure hydrostatic pressure, were also used in this experiment. Both transducers were buried at depths of 7. 5, 15, or 23 cm and were used to measure soil pressures caused by a 30. 5 L- 32 tire with dynamic loads of 19 or 37 kN. The SSTs were buried by inserting them into an excavated hole, while the rubber bulbs were inserted with a special tool designed to leave the soil surface and surrounding soil undisturbed. Peak values of mean normal stress (calculated from measurements of pressure) from the SSTs and hydrostatic pressure measured with the rubber bulbs {{were found to be}} affected by both loading and burial depth. Similar magnitudes and variation were observed for each transducer. Residual pressure, defined as the pressure remaining after loading was removed, was found to be affected by both loading and burial depth when measured with the rubber bulbs.

40|$|Microplitis croceipes, a nectar-feeding {{parasitoid}} wasp, {{was found}} to be able to associatively learn chemical cues using classical conditioning to food. The experiments on M. croceipes were performed and recorded with a Sony camcorder <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>USDA-ARS</b> Biological Control Laboratory at Tifton, GA, USA. The experimental videos in this study have shown that M. croceipes can respond to coffee odour when associated with food. The detection capabilities and behaviour of M. croceipes at different levels of coffee odour were studied. First, the data that related to trained M. croceipes behaviour were extracted from the experimental videos and stored in a Microsoft Excel database. The extracted data represented the behaviour of M. croceipes trained to 20 mg of coffee and then, subsequently, exposed to 5, 10, 20 and 40 mg of coffee. Secondly, indices were developed to uniquely characterise the behaviour of trained M. croceipes under these different coffee concentrations. Thirdly, a stochastic mathematical model and its parameters were developed to mimic and predict the responses of trained wasps when exposed to these four different levels of coffee odours. Finally, additional data analyses were performed to investigate the lateralisation and robustness of trained wasps’ conditioned responses. A hypothesis is proposed based on the experimental findings in this research. In summary, this thesis demonstrates the usefulness of mathematical models for interpreting experimental observations, gaining novel insights into the dynamic behaviour of these trained wasps, the development of hypotheses, as well as understanding the design principles of a simple model based on the behaviour of trained wasps...|$|E

40|$|Escherichia coli {{release from}} {{streambed}} sediments may substantially affect microbial water quality. Models of E. coli release and transport commonly use a single {{set of parameters}} for the whole stream or reservoir, yet {{little is known about}} the magnitude and sources of the variability of parameters of the streambed bacteria release. The objectives of this work were: (a) to obtain and compare parameters of streambed E. coli resuspension in three stream reaches with distinctly different bottom sediment textures, and (b) to see whether the modeling of streambed E. coli resuspension with reach-specific parameters could provide substantially better accuracy than modeling with a single set of parameters. Sediment particle size distributions and the streambed E. coli concentrations were measured along a first-order creek <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>USDA-ARS</b> OPE 3 experimental watershed in Maryland. Afterwards, 80 m 3 of water were released into the creek at a rate of 60 L per second in four equal allotments separated by 1 &# 8211; 3 min intervals. Flow rates and E. coli concentrations were monitored with automated samplers at the ends of the three reaches with a total length of 630 m. A high concentration of streambed E. coli (“hotspot”) resuspended within the first reach caused a pulse of high E. coli concentrations that propagated along the creek without substantial attenuation; inputs of sediment-borne E. coli from the next two reaches were relatively small. The E. coli transport model included one-dimensional Saint&# 8211;Venant and advective&# 8211;dispersive equations. The calibrated roughness coefficient values were comparable for the three reaches, whereas the critical stress and the entrainment rate differed among reaches by a half order and an order of magnitude, respectively. Overall, better accuracy was observed when the model contained reach-specific parameters. Additional research is needed to understand which and how sediment properties affect parameters of streambed E. coli release into the water column. clos...|$|E
40|$|Choptank’ (Reg. no. CV- 976, PI 639724) is a soft red {{winter wheat}} (Triticum aestivum L.) that was jointly {{developed}} and {{released by the}} Maryland Agricultural Experiment Station, Department of Natural Resource Sciences and Landscape Architecture, and the Virginia Agricultural Experiment Station in 2004. Choptank is named after Maryland’s longest scenic river, which flows 70 miles from {{the western part of}} Delaware through Maryland and into the Chesapeake Bay, on Maryland’s Eastern Shore. Choptank has performed well in Maryland, Virginia, and Delaware and provides growers with a high-yielding cultivar with short stature, excellent powdery mildew [caused by Blumeria graminis (DC.) E. O. Speer f. sp. tritici Em. Marchal] resistance and early heading date. Choptank was derived from the cross ‘Coker 9803 ’ (PI 548845) /‘Freedom’ (PI 562382) that was made in 1990 at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. The population was advanced from the F 2 to F 5 generation using a modified bulk breeding method. Wheat spikes were selected in Virginia from the population in each generation (F 2 –F 5) based on the absence of obvious disease, early maturity, short straw, and desirable head shape and size. Selected spikes were threshed in bulk and the seed was planted the following fall of each selection year. Spikes selected from the F 5 : 6 bulk block were threshed individually and planted in separate headrows in the fall of 1996 at Beltsville, MD. Choptank was derived as a bulk of one of these F 6 : 7 headrows selected in 1997 and assigned the breeding line designation MD 11 – 52. In addition to high grain yield, Choptank was {{selected on the basis of}} earliness of head emergence, short plant height, and resistance to powdery mildew. Choptank was evaluated in the Maryland Wheat Variety Test for 5 yr (from 2000 – 2004), in the Virginia and Delaware State Wheat Variety Tests for 3 yr, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>USDA-ARS</b> Uniform Eastern and Uniform Southern Soft Red Winter Wheat Nurseries in 2004. Coleoptiles of Choptank are white. Juvenile plants exhibit a semierect growth habit. Plant color at boot stage (Feekes growth stage 9 – 10) is blue green and a waxy bloom is present on the stem and flag leaf sheath. Anther color is yellow. Spikes are tapering, middense, and awnletted. Glumes are long and wide, with oblique shoulders and obtuse beaks. Kernels of Choptank are red, soft, and ovate with a crease of medium width and depth, rounded cheeks, and a long noncollared brush. Choptank carries the 1 BL. 1 RS wheat–rye chromosomal translocation. Head emergence of Choptank in Maryland is similar to that of ‘Sisson’ and 2 d earlier than Pioneer brand ‘ 25 R 37 ’. In Maryland, average plant height of Choptank (77. 5 cm) is 5 cm shorter than that of Sisson and 2 cm shorter than that of USG ‘ 3209 ’. Average straw strength (0. 0 lodging score) of Choptank in Maryland is similar to that of Sisson (0. 3) ...|$|E
40|$|Cougar (Reg. no. CV- 900, PI 613098) {{is a hard}} red {{winter wheat}} (Triticum aestivum L.) {{cultivar}} developed cooperatively by the Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station and the USDA-ARS and released in 2000. Cougar was selected from the cross NE 85707 / 2 ̆ 7 Thunderbird 2 ̆ 7 which was made in 1987. The pedigree of NE 85707 is ‘Warrior’* 5 /‘Agent’//‘Kavkaz’/ 4 /NE 63218 /‘Kenya 58 ’/ 3 /‘Newthatch’/ 2 * CTMH//‘Ponca’/* 2 ‘Cheyenne’. The pedigree of CTMH is Cheyenne-‘Tenmarq’-‘Mediterranean’-‘Hope’, where {{the order of the}} crosses is unknown. The pedigree of NE 63218 is believed to be CI 12500 //‘Red Chief’/Ponca/ 3 /Cheyenne. The pedigree of CI 12500 is ‘Nebraska No. 60 ’//Mediterranean/Hope. The F 1 to F 3 generations were advanced using the bulk breeding method. Cougar is an F 3 -derived line that was selected in the F 4 generation. Cougar was released primarily for its very long coleoptile (116 mm, similar to ‘Scout 66 ’) with exceptional straw strength (superior to ‘ 2137 ’ and ‘Wesley’), traits which have value in southern Nebraska. Cougar is an awned, white-glumed cultivar. Its field appearance is most similar to Thunderbird and ‘Big Dawg’. After heading, the canopy is open and upright. The flag leaf is erect and twisted at the boot stage. The foliage is green with a slight blue cast and a waxy bloom at anthesis. The leaves are glabrous. The spike is tapering in shape, moderately long to long, and middense. The glume is short and wide, and the glume shoulder is square. The beak is moderately short in length with an acuminate tip. The spike is usually erect to inclined at maturity. Kernels are red colored, hard textured, midlong, and elliptical to ovate in shape. The kernel has no collar, a midsize to large brush of medium length, rounded cheeks, midsize germ, and a midwide and shallow crease. Cougar was tested as NE 93496 in Nebraska yield nurseries starting in 1994, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>USDA-ARS</b> Southern Regional Performance Nursery in 1997 and 1998, and in Nebraska cultivar performance trials in 1998 and 1999. In 2 yr of testing in Nebraska cultivar performance trials, it has performed competitively in southeast, southcentral, and southwestern Nebraska, areas where historically Thunderbird also performed well. In this region (17 environments), Cougar had a yield of 4100 kg ha− 1, which was lower than Wesley (4700 kg ha− 1) and 2137 (4630 kg ha− 1) but superior to ‘Pronghorn’ (3820 kg ha− 1), the only other modern, long coleoptile wheat in the trial. Cougar was ranked 38 out of 45 lines tested in the Southern Regional Performance Nursery in 1997 (36 environments), and 42 out of 45 lines tested in 1998 (35 environments). The main advantages Cougar has when compared with most other available wheat cultivars, within its area of adaptation, is its long coleoptile, exceptional straw strength, good grain volume weight, and kernel size...|$|E
