5|$|In March 2016, it was {{announced}} that Sorkin would be adapting A Few <b>Good</b> <b>Men</b> for a live production on NBC, slated to air in 2018.|$|E
5|$|Sorkin wrote several {{drafts of}} the script for A Few <b>Good</b> <b>Men</b> in his Manhattan apartment, {{learning}} the craft from a book about screenplay format. He then spent several months at the Los Angeles offices of Castle Rock, working on the script with director Rob Reiner. William Goldman (who regularly worked under contract at Castle Rock) became his mentor and helped him to adapt his stageplay into a screenplay. The movie was directed by Reiner, starred Tom Cruise, Jack Nicholson, Demi Moore and Kevin Bacon, and was produced by Brown. A Few <b>Good</b> <b>Men</b> was released in 1992 and was a box office success.|$|E

5|$|Barrowman {{returned}} {{to the role of}} Billy Crocker in Trevor Nunn's 2003 West End revival of Anything Goes, and appeared in West End non-musical dramas, such as his role as Wyndham Brandon in Rope at the Minerva Theatre, Chichester in 1993, and he starred as Lieutenant Jack Ross opposite Rob Lowe in the 2005 production of A Few <b>Good</b> <b>Men.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Sorkin revised {{his play}} A Few <b>Good</b> <b>Men</b> for a revival at the London West End theatre, the Haymarket. The play {{opened at the}} Theatre Royal Haymarket {{in the fall of}} the same year and was {{directed}} by David Esbjornson, with Rob Lowe of The West Wing in the lead role.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Sorkin worked under {{contract}} for Castle Rock Entertainment, Inc. He wrote the scripts for A Few <b>Good</b> <b>Men,</b> Malice and The American President: The three films grossed about US$400million worldwide. While writing for Castle Rock he {{became friends with}} colleagues such as William Goldman and Rob Reiner and met his future wife Julia Bingham, {{who was one of}} Castle Rock's business affairs lawyers.|$|E

5|$|Sorkin got the {{inspiration}} {{to write his}} next play, a courtroom drama called A Few <b>Good</b> <b>Men,</b> from a phone conversation with his sister Deborah (who had graduated from Boston University Law School and {{signed up for a}} three-year stint with the U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General's Corps). Deborah told Sorkin {{that she was going to}} Guantanamo Bay to defend a group of Marines who came close to killing a fellow Marine in a hazing ordered by a superior officer. Sorkin took that information and wrote much of his story on cocktail napkins while bartending at the Palace Theatre. He and his roommates had purchased a Macintosh 512K so when he returned home he would empty his pockets of the cocktail napkins and type them into the computer, forming a basis from which he wrote many drafts for A Few <b>Good</b> <b>Men.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the {{nominations}} announcement on February 17, the combined gross of the five Best Picture nominees at the US box office was $252 million, with an average of $50.4 million per film. A Few <b>Good</b> <b>Men</b> was the highest earner among the Best Picture nominees with $120 million in domestic box office receipts. The film was followed by Unforgiven ($75.2 million), Scent of a Woman ($34.1 million), The Crying Game ($14 million), and finally Howards End ($8.7 million).|$|E
5|$|Brassey had {{considerable}} skill in choosing <b>good</b> <b>men</b> {{to work in}} this way and in delegating the work. Having taken on a contract at an agreed price {{he would make a}} suitable sum of money available to the agent to meet the costs. If the agent were able to fulfil the work at a lower cost he could keep the remainder of the money. If unforeseen problems arose and these were reasonable, Brassey would cover these additional costs. He used hundreds of such agents. At the peak of his career, for well over 20 years, Brassey was employing on average some 80,000 people in many countries in four continents.|$|E

5000|$|OCS {{adjectives}} {{can be in}} two forms: {{short and}} long, corresponding to indefinite and definite meaning respectively. The long form is generally used only attributively, whereas the short form is predicative in nature.

Only A Few <b>Good</b> <b>Men</b> (6th), Unforgiven (17th), Malcolm X (30th) and Scent of a Woman (38th) were nominated for directing, acting, screenwriting, or Best Picture.

5|$|Sorkin {{continued}} writing Making Movies and in 1990 it debuted Off-Broadway at the Promenade Theatre, {{produced by}} John A. McQuiggan, and again directed by Don Scardino. Meanwhile, David Brown was producing a few projects at TriStar Pictures {{and tried to}} interest them in making A Few <b>Good</b> <b>Men</b> into a film but his proposal was declined {{due to the lack}} of star actor involvement. Brown later got a call from Alan Horn at Castle Rock Entertainment who was anxious to make the film. Rob Reiner, a Castle Rock producing partner, opted to direct it.|$|E
5|$|St Vincent's gaze {{passed over}} {{every aspect of}} the Navy from the Sea Fencibles to the Navy Hospitals. The earl {{attempted}} to disband the Sea Fencibles claiming that they were needed only to quiet the fears of little old ladies and that <b>good</b> <b>men</b> passed their whole careers without hearing a shot fired. Doctor Baird, St Vincent's personal physician, was appointed to the Sick and Hurt Board as Inspector of all Hospitals.|$|E

5|$|Unlike the {{majority}} of Trollope's triangles, Mary is not called upon to judge between a good suitor and a bad one, but between two <b>good</b> <b>men.</b> Gilmore {{is presented as a}} sympathetic and admirable character; the reader learns far less about Captain Marrable's character, and is given no reason why Mary should prefer him to his rival. To Trollope, a woman does not necessarily fall in love because of a man's merits; and it is very wrong for a woman to marry where she does not love, regardless of her suitor's worthy qualities.|$|E
5|$|Yesterday, as my orderly {{was holding}} my horse, I asked {{him where he}} was from. He said he was from Hawaii! He {{proved to be a}} full-blood Kanaka, by the name of Kealoha, who came from the Islands last year. There is also another, by the name of Kaiwi, who lived near Judge Smith's, who left the Islands last July. I enjoyed seeing them very much and we had a good jabber in kanaka. Kealoha is a private in the 41st Regiment US Colored Troops, and Kaiwi is a Private in the 28th U.S.C.T., in the pioneer corps. Both are <b>good</b> <b>men</b> and seemed glad to have seen me.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Dalton felt {{jealous of}} boys {{for the freedom}} they enjoyed. They could travel alone without {{worrying}} about their reputation and were often bribed to attend school, while girls were, in her opinion, educated reluctantly. One of her teachers {{thought it would be}} wasteful for her to study algebra, as she already had sufficient education for a housewife. As a young woman, she felt that women lived on a higher moral level than men. She saw polygamy as a way to allow more women to marry the few <b>good</b> <b>men,</b> arguing that it gave more women the opportunity to marry. She also considered it ironic that prostitution was tolerated but polygamy was considered depraved.|$|E

5|$|In 1991, Demi Moore was {{a budding}} A-list film star {{who had been}} married to Bruce Willis since 1987.

Following the photo, she would earn $3 million for her 1992 role in A Few <b>Good</b> <b>Men</b> and $5 million apiece for roles in Indecent Proposal (1993), Disclosure (1994) and The Scarlet Letter (1995).|$|E
