5|$|Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) confides in Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) {{that she}} is {{intending}} to stay in Tallahassee. Ryan interprets this as an invitation {{to hook up with}} her, so he attempts to seduce her by taking her to the empty kitchen to help her make a waffle. They hide under a table when the chefs return. After Ryan compliments Erin, she suggests that they could become roommates in Florida and possibly start dating in six months <b>if</b> <b>things</b> <b>go</b> well between them. Not wanting that long timeline, he resorts to saying he loves Kelly.|$|E
5|$|Mulder goes {{to see the}} Shooter, despite Spender's objections. Mulder {{wants to}} give the Shooter {{immunity}} in exchange for testimony, which the Shooter refuses. Gibson proves his abilities {{to a group of}} clinicians while Scully and Fowley watch. The guard at the prison hands the Shooter a flattened Morley cigarette box that says he's a dead man. Scully visits the Lone Gunmen, wanting them to analyze the data from Gibson. She asks them who Diana is, and they tell her she worked closely with Mulder when he discovered the X-Files. The Smoking Man meets with Jeffrey in the FBI parking lot, but disappears when Mulder spots them talking. Scully and Mulder present to Skinner on Gibson, who displays extraordinary brain activities. Mulder believes that Gibson is the key to everything in the X-Files, and wants to make a deal with the Shooter. Diana and Skinner think this may result in adverse attention from the attorney general, and that the X-Files could be closed down <b>if</b> <b>things</b> <b>go</b> wrong, but Mulder dismisses that risk.|$|E
500|$|In a June 2017 {{interview}} with Ultimate Guitar, Gary Holt {{said that he}} is ready to contribute with the songwriting for the next album. When speaking to Revolver, King was asked if there were any plans in place for the band to begin working on the album, he said, [...] "Funny thing is, Repentless isn't even two years old yet, though it seems like it is. But from that session, there are six or eight songs that are recorded — some with vocals, some with leads, but all with keeper guitar, drums and bass. So when those songs get finished lyrically, if the lyrics don't change the songs, they'll be ready to be on the next record. So we already have more than half a record complete, if those songs make it." [...] He also gave conceivable consideration that it could be released next year, [...] "I'm certainly not gonna promise it, because every time I do, I make a liar of myself! [...] " [...] When asked about any plans or the timeline the band would like to release the album, King said, [...] "It depends on touring — getting time to rehearse, getting time to make up new stuff. We haven't even done Australia on this run yet at all. We're hitting Japan finally later this year. But <b>if</b> <b>things</b> <b>go</b> well, I'd like to record next year. But timelines change all the time." [...] In an October 2017 interview, Holt once again expressed his desire to contribute to the songwriting for the next Slayer album, saying, [...] "When that time comes and we are ready for the next album, if Kerry wants me to contribute, I've got riffs. I've got stuff right now that I've written that I am not using for Exodus, because it was kind of maybe just unintentional subconscious thing, like, 'It sounds a little too Slayer.'" ...|$|E

500|$|A {{fundamental}} {{characteristic of the}} aesthete is immediacy. In Either/Or, there are several levels of immediacy explored, ranging from unrefined to refined. Unrefined immediacy is characterized by immediate cravings for desire and satisfaction through enjoyments {{that do not require}} effort or personal cultivation (e.g. alcohol, drugs, casual sex, sloth, etc.) Refined immediacy is characterized by planning how best to enjoy life aesthetically. The [...] "theory" [...] of social prudence given in Crop Rotation is an example of refined immediacy. Instead of mindless hedonistic tendencies, enjoyments are contemplated and [...] "cultivated" [...] for maximum pleasure. However, both the refined and unrefined aesthetes still accept the fundamental given conditions of their life, and do not accept the responsibility to change it. <b>If</b> <b>things</b> <b>go</b> wrong, the aesthete simply blames existence, rather than one's self, assuming some unavoidable tragic consequence of human existence and thus claims life is meaningless. Kierkegaard spoke of immediacy this way in his sequel to Either/Or, Stages on Life's Way, [...] "The esthetic sphere is the sphere of immediacy, the ethical the sphere of requirement (and this requirement is so infinite that the individual always goes bankrupt), the religious the sphere of fulfillment, but, please note, not a fulfillment such as when one fills an alms box or a sack with gold, for repentance has specifically created a boundless space, and as a consequence the religious contradiction: simultaneously to be out on 70,000 fathoms of water and yet be joyful. Just as the ethical sphere is a passageway-which one nevertheless does not pass through once and for all-just as repentance is its expression, so repentance is the most dialectical. No wonder, then, that one fears it, for if one gives it a finger it takes the whole hand. Just as Jehovah in the Old Testament visits the iniquities of the fathers upon the children unto the latest generations, so repentance goes backward, continually presupposing the object of its investigation. In repentance there is the impulse of the motion, and therefore everything is reversed. This impulse signifies precisely the difference between the esthetic and the religious as the difference between the external and the internal." [...] Søren Kierkegaard, Stages on Life's Way, Hong translation, p. 476-477 ...|$|E
2500|$|They {{are capable}} of {{fighting}} with all their might {{to achieve their goals}} because, <b>if</b> <b>things</b> <b>go</b> wrong, their self-esteem will not be affected. [...] They can acknowledge their own mistakes precisely because their self-image is strong, and this acknowledgment will not impair or affect their self-image. They live with less fear of losing social prestige, and with more happiness and general well-being.|$|E
2500|$|System 3 is able {{to audit}} (via 3*) past {{performance}} so [...] "bad times" [...] for production {{can be compared to}} [...] "good times". <b>If</b> <b>things</b> <b>go</b> wrong and levels of risk increase the System 3 asks for help or puts it to colleagues for a remedy. This is the pain of an algedonic alert, which can be automatic when performance fails to achieve capability targets. The autonomic 3–2–1 homeostatic loop's problem is absorbed for solution within the autonomy of its metasystem. Development (the System 4 role of research and marketing) is asked for recommendations.|$|E

2500|$|Kat {{previously}} {{cheated on}} Alfie with Michael and Michael {{is the father}} of Kat's child Tommy. Kat chose to stay with Alfie, but Inside Soap said there seemed to be [...] "unfinished business" [...] between Kat and Michael. Michael has a baby with his new wife, millionaire businesswoman Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks), and the magazine wondered if Michael would turn to Kat <b>if</b> <b>things</b> <b>go</b> badly at their wedding. They also thought that Michael still has feelings for Kat, but wondered if he would actually cheat on Janine. They called him [...] "a nasty bit of work" [...] but thought that starting an affair when his newborn baby, Scarlett Moon, is ill in hospital would [...] "really take the biscuit." [...] They said the characters are drawn to each other and Kat hates Janine, but an affair would not be shocking enough as they have already had a relationship. Brooks is leaving the cast in 2012 for an extended break, so Soaplife said that something will happen to break Michael and Janine up, but thought an affair with Kat would be [...] "too much been-there-done-that to be equal to as big a reveal as 'Who Shot Phil?'." [...] They later said that Michael would not risk Janine's fortune by cheating. All About Soap thought Michael was the least likely suspect, as he has other things on his mind, although Kat [...] "shows a softer side" [...] to Michael when she gives him some baby clothes, but said that Kat hates Michael, [...] "which could prove a problem in the romance department." [...] They also said Michael [...] "has a first-class degree in lying." ...|$|E

60|$|For I {{know of no}} {{stronger}} {{proof of}} {{the truth of the}} book of Deuteronomy, and of the whole Pentateuch, than its ending so differently from what we should have expected, or indeed wished. <b>If</b> <b>things</b> <b>went</b> in this world, as they do in novels and fables, according to man's notion of what is right and good, then Moses and his history would have had a very different ending.|$|R
