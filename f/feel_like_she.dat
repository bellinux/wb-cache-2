Jon {{is described as}} having strong Stark features with a lean build, long face, dark brown hair and grey eyes.

Jon is the same age as Robb and enjoys a warm relationship with his siblings, particularly the tomboy Arya (who resembles Jon and like him does not <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> fits in). Ned treats Jon as much like his other children as propriety and his honor will allow. Still, as somewhat of an outsider, Jon has learned to be independent and to fend for himself when necessary. Jon idolizes his father, but is wounded by Ned's refusal to tell him about his mother. At the beginning of the story, Jon adopts the albino direwolf that he names Ghost.

She collaborated closely with Bale to build their characters and made off-screen suggestions to Russell, including for {{a scene in which}} she is aggressively kissed on the lips by her lover's wife (played by Lawrence). The experience was grueling for Adams, who later admitted that Russell had been too hard on her and had made her cry frequently; she said that she regretted bringing such a negative experience home to her daughter.

500|$|The {{song was}} added to the set list and {{performed}} live during the second European leg of The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour in February and March 2014.

Sonia Saraiya of Nerve ranked Jasmine fifth in her article [...] "Ranked: Disney Princesses From Least To Most Feminist". Saraiya praised her personality, likening her boldness, curiosity, and skepticism of marriage to that of Belle while commending her for [...] "falling for a completely inadequate 'street rat' and whisking him out of poverty, instead of the other way around." [...] However, Saraiya labeled Jasmine's use of sexuality her [...] "only power", criticizing her for sending a negative message to young girls. When questioned about whether or not Jasmine is a positive role model because [...] "all she wants to do is get married", Larkin defended her character, explaining, [...] "That's not true. Jasmine says to a generation of little kids about marriage that the law is wrong. She risks everything—her safety, her comfort, everything she knows—and goes out and finds a way to change the marriage law... Yeah, she's a good role model!' Really good! Whether it's connected or not, that person that the writers created that I got to portray, I'm so proud of her. And I <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> was ahead of her time."

500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for the remix of [...] "Up Out My Face" [...] {{was directed by}} Carey's husband, Nick Cannon.

Carey and Minaj play different characters, include Barbie dolls who escape from their boxes, sexy nurses in matching outfits, two women in a nail salon and two divas shopping. Carey's doll box has [...] "She sings" [...] written on the front, while Minaj's say [...] "She raps". Cannon makes a cameo appearance in the video, which Chris Ryan of MTV Buzzworthy thought was a reference to the 2002 film, Drumline. According to Anna Pickard of The Guardian, the escape from their packaging demonstrates a theme of being independent women and {{that they will not be}} restrained by men. Minaj spoke about the video in an interview for MTV News: [...] "A lot of times, more famous artists or more confident artists take from a younger artist but they’ll never include you in that. I <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> liked the whole doll thing and she wanted to do it with me. But she said that: She said, ’Everybody’s gonna say 'she’s doing Nicki.' But I told her, she’s always had a doll persona, like all that ’doll baby’ [...] So it goes perfect with Barbie and we had fun. That’s all that matters." ...|$|E
