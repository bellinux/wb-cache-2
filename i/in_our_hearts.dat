25|$|In 1973 Brel {{appeared}} in his ninth feature film, Le Far West, his second directorial effort. The film co-starred Gabriel Jabbour, Danielle Evenou, and Arlette Lindon. The story is about Jacques, a 40-year-old citizen of Brussels, who meets the fakir Abracadabra who, before dying, gives him a special power. Jacques meets Gabriel, a generous man, who dresses up as Davy Crockett, and who follows Jacques without asking questions. The two companions and other new friends set out to conquer the Far West, their childhood—just as Voltaire sought El Dorado, and Saint-Exupéry the unknown planet. The Far West they seek cannot be found, {{because it is an}} imaginary place, a piece of happiness buried <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>hearts.</b> The film was released on 15 May 1973.|$|E
25|$|We {{all knew}} <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>hearts</b> that Michael was disappointing. We {{felt that we}} had {{compensated}} adequately in making a fun, exciting, stylized world. You know, I was disappointed in one aspect: a voiceover from Tom’s sister that we had, which Walter later decided to cut. Um, {{there were a couple}} of things in the narrative that I felt went out that probably should have stayed in. At the same time, I was myself knocked out by what Walter and (cinematographer) Andy Laszlo and our editor were doing visually on the film. And I felt, as I watched the post-production process going on, I just saw the film getting better and better. More impressive. To the point where I thought it was going to do well. And I thought that we had done what we set out to do. Created the world that we set out to create.... It was a movie that was built to succeed. It’s funny. The movie screened very, very well. I remember, after the first screenings, people told me that I was going to be rich for life. There was tremendous love and confidence.|$|E

25|$|The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in an {{internal}} report by delegate George Burnier, stated the following in April 1920:There are two distinct military organizations in Hungary: the national army {{and a kind}} of civil guard which was formed when the communist régime fell. It is the latter which has been responsible for all the reprehensible acts committed. The Government managed to regain control of these organizations only a few weeks ago. They are now well-disciplined and collaborate with the municipal police forces.This deep hostility toward Communism would be the more lasting legacy of Kun's abortive revolution. It was a conviction shared by Horthy and his country's ruling class that would help drive Hungary into what might have been a fatal alliance with Adolf Hitler.The nation of the Hungarians loved and admired Budapest, which became its polluter in the last years. Here, {{on the banks of the}} Danube, I arraign her. This city has disowned her thousand years of tradition, she has dragged the Holy Crown and the national colours in the dust, she has clothed herself in red rags. The finest of the nation she threw into dungeons or drove into exile. She laid in ruin our property and wasted our wealth. Yet the nearer we approached to this city, the more rapidly did the ice <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>hearts</b> melt. We are now ready to forgive her.|$|E

The album features several bluegrass interpretations of classic country songs written by Bill Monroe, Lester Flatt, and Hank Williams. Jones co-wrote two songs with Johnny Mathis, the rollicking [...] "Jump In The Mississippi" [...] and the plaintive [...] "I'd Dreamed My Baby Came Home", while [...] "Will There Ever Be Another" [...] and [...] "I'll Be There To Welcome You Home" [...] were co-written by Montgomery.

Ben Patashnik from NME felt that [...] "Dance in the Dark", along with another song [...] "Monster", was [...] "slightly disposable". Michael Hubbard from MusicOMH complimented the song for its [...] "monumental chorus and some Madonna-esque spoken-word moments, including this shout out to a lost Royal: 'You will never fall apart Diana, you're still <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>hearts</b> / Never let you fall apart / Together we'll dance in the dark.'" ...|$|E
