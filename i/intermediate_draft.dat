25|$|When Wagner came {{to compose}} Siegfried, he made three {{significant}} alterations to his modus operandi. Firstly, he wrote (in ink and {{on at least}} three staves) a developed draft between the preliminary draft and the full score; this <b>intermediate</b> <b>draft</b> included most of the orchestral details of the final score; this procedure, Wagner hoped, would facilitate {{the writing of the}} full score, obviating the difficulties he had encountered during the composition of Die Walküre. Secondly, he composed one act at a time, carrying the composition of the music through all three stages from preliminary draft to full score (but not necessarily fair copy) for the first act before proceeding to the composition of the second act; this way he ensured that as little time as possible elapsed between the initial drafting of a passage and its final orchestration. Thirdly, he frequently worked on the various drafts at the same time, orchestrating the earlier scenes of an act while still drafting the later ones.|$|E

6000|$|... 'The corrupt {{state of}} the text has stimulated the {{ingenuity}} of numerous correctors, who have suggested many acute and convincing emendations, and some very specious ones which sustained scrutiny has proved untenable. It should be needless to remark that success has in general been proportionate to the facilities {{of access to the}} manuscripts, which have only of late become generally available. If Shelley is less fortunate than most modern poets in the purity of his text, he is more fortunate than many in the preservation of his manuscripts. These have not, as regards a fair proportion, been destroyed or dispersed at auctions, but were protected from either fate by their very character as confused memoranda. As such they remained in the possession of Shelley's widow, and passed from her to her son and daughter-in-law. After Sir Percy Shelley's death, Lady Shelley took the occasion of the erection of the monument to Shelley at University College, Oxford, to present [certain of] the manuscripts to the Bodleian Library, and verse and sculpture form an imperishable memorial of his connection with the University where his residence was so brief and troubled.' (Dr. Garnett proceeds:--'The most important of the Bodleian manuscripts is that of [...] "Prometheus Unbound", which, says Mr. Locock, has the appearance of being an <b>intermediate</b> <b>draft,</b> and also the first copy made. This should confer considerable authority on its variations from the accepted text, as this appears to have been printed from a copy not made by Shelley himself. [...] "My 'Prometheus'," [...] he writes to Ollier on September 6, 1819, [...] "is now being transcribed," [...] an expression which he would hardly have used if he had himself been the copyist. He wished the proofs to be sent to him in Italy for correction, but to this Ollier objected, and on May 14, 1820, Shelley signifies his acquiescence, adding, however, [...] "In this case I shall repose trust in your care respecting the correction of the press; Mr. Gisborne will revise it; he heard it recited, and will therefore more readily seize any error." [...] This confidence in the accuracy of Gisborne's verbal memory is touching! From a letter to Gisborne on May 26 following it appears that the offer to correct came from him, and that Shelley sent him [...] "two little papers of corrections and additions," [...] which were probably made use of, or the fact would have been made known. In the case of additions this may satisfactorily account for apparent omissions in the Bodleian manuscript. Gisborne, after all, did not prove fully up to the mark. [...] "It is to be regretted," [...] writes Shelley to Ollier on November 20, [...] "that the errors of the press are so numerous," [...] adding, [...] "I shall send you the list of errata in a day or two." [...] This was probably [...] "the list of errata written by Shelley himself," [...] from which Mrs. Shelley corrected the edition of 1839.') ...|$|E
25|$|Developed Draft (Orchesterskizze) – in {{the case}} of Siegfried (Acts I and II), the {{preliminary}} drafts were elaborated before Wagner proceeded to develop the full scores. In these <b>intermediate</b> <b>drafts,</b> he worked out all the orchestral details, including instrumental doublings. The developed drafts for the first two acts of Siegfried are in ink and are written on one vocal and two instrumental staves throughout.

5000|$|In 1940, screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz was {{a former}} Hearst {{journalist}} recuperating from a car accident, and was in between jobs. He had originally been hired by Welles to work on The Campbell Playhouse radio program and was available {{to work on the}} screenplay for Welles's film. The writer had only received two screenplay credits between 1935 and his work on Citizen Kane and needed the job, his reputation having plummeted after he descended into alcoholism in the late 1930s. In the 1970s and 1980s, there was a dispute amongst historians regarding whose idea it was to use William Randolph Hearst as the basis for Charles Foster Kane. For some time, Mankiewicz had wanted to write a screenplay about a public figure, perhaps a gangster, whose story would be told by the people that knew him. Welles claimed it was his idea to write about Hearst, while film critic Pauline Kael (in her widely publicised 1971 essay [...] "Raising Kane") and Welles's former business partner John Houseman claim that it was Mankiewicz's idea. Kael further claimed that Welles had written nothing of the original script, and did not deserve a co-writer credit. However, in 1985, film historian Robert Carringer showed that Kael had only reached her conclusion by comparing the first and last drafts of the Citizen Kane script, whereas Carringer examined every <b>intermediate</b> <b>draft</b> by Mankiewicz and Welles, and concluded that a co-writer credit was justified, with each man writing between 40% and 60% of the script. He additionally concluded that Houseman's claims to have contributed to the script were largely unfounded.|$|E
40|$|Existing {{models of}} the writing task from a {{cognitive}} viewpoint agree {{on the importance of}} draft revision in the overall process. This is generally assumed to focus on reviewing <b>intermediate</b> <b>drafts</b> in search for feedback on how to modify them to match the driving constraints. However, in literary creativity it is often the case that the feedback leads not to a revision of the current draft but to a redefinition of the constraints that are driving the process. This phenomenon is explicitly described in Sharples’ model of writing as a creative task. Yet existing computational models of literary creativity do not contemplate it. The present paper describes a computational model of the creative processes in literary creativity that contemplates the explicit representation of the constraints driving the process, and allows for the feedback from the validation to modify not just the ongoing draft but also the constraints that it is expected to satisfy. This allows the model to represent cases of serendipitous discovery of interesting features...|$|R

25|$|In January 1855 Wagner {{proceeded}} to compose the full score {{without bothering to}} write an <b>intermediate</b> instrumentation <b>draft</b> {{as he had done}} for Das Rheingold.

Consequently, some passages had to be composed again from scratch. Wagner, nevertheless, persevered with the task and the full score was finally completed on 20 March 1856. The fair copy was begun on 14 July 1855 in the Swiss resort of Seelisberg, where Wagner and his wife spent a month.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} some of {{the conscious}} cognitive processes that are inherent in equivalence formation commencing from the transfer of deixis and culminating {{in the experience of}} source-to-target and target-to-source indexicality. Its scope is interdisciplinary and the methodology is varied depending on the segment of analysis. It combines a process-oriented analysis with a product based assessment. The stance is also partly subjective because {{it is based on the}} personal experience of the translator-researcher of four translating operations. Besides, the structure of the thesis is modular since the main objective is to develop a holistic translation model founded on verbal behaviourism. This approach seeks to put the translator back at the centre of translation theory. All the deictic and indexical aspects of the source-to-target and target-to-source lexico-grammatical, semantico-pragmatic, textual, literary, poetic, discursive, political, ideological and socio-cultural movements are monitored in order to identify the intrinsic cognitive, psycholinguistic and sociolinguistic rules which govern the verbal behaviour of the translator. That is why the focus is on the translator’s parole though without any negligence of the influence of langue. As complex linguistic forms, deictic expressions and indexicalities are closely tracked and examined at different phases of the translating process commencing from the lexico-grammatical segment and moving to higher levels of textuality. The deictic projection of the translator-researcher is evaluated during the appropriation and manipulation of the deictic centre of the implied author. The aim is to unravel how the system-common and systemspecific forms preside over the cycle of equivalence formation starting from the source cue, moving to the <b>intermediate</b> <b>draft</b> versions and culminating in an actual target performance. Taking the standpoint of the anthropological linguist, nearformal correspondence is found to depend on intersystemic coincidence as to the similarities and differences between the content of the source form and the equivalent. Relativities of reading, translating and rewriting are identified as the places where the translator essentially exercises her/his creativity and fulfils her/his subjectivity in terms of competence and intuition. Based on decision theory, the verbal behaviour of the translator is defined in terms of the creation of a source-to-target deictic relationship during an indexical reaction to source cues. As equivalence emerges, it sets an interlinguistic precedence. This latter target form often develops into a socially motivated target icon thanks to the overt and covert intersubjective verbal cooperation between the members of a community of practice. The decision-making operation of the individual translator turns into an act of conscious and, sometimes, subconscious verbal reinforcement of established equivalents. It is also based on the elimination of some viable target options which either collapse from the final target performance during the rewriting phase or remain dormant in bilingual lexicographies. The encounter of the translator with different genres also divulges how bilingual competence, poetic attitude, literary prejudice, political affiliation, ideological conviction and sociocultural assumptions shape the mode of the intersubjective, intertextual, interliterary and intercultural dialogue that is eventually held between two universes of discourse. The target re-contextualisation and by implication the decontextualisation of the source ideological grounding are also explained in terms of the aspiration of the translator to adhere to a set of prevailing target linguistic, literary, poetic and socio-cultural norms. Thus target choice, be it informed or instinctive, grows to be a permanently negotiable verbal process among the active subjectivities of any given community of translators...|$|E

The anatomical bases were {{established for the}} morphometry of the navicular bone and its variations according to the category of horse, after corrections were made for front or rear limb, sex, weight, size and age. In ponies, navicular bone measurements were smallest for light ponies and regularly increased with body size, but in horses, navicular bone dimensions were smallest for the athletic halfbred, <b>intermediate</b> for <b>draft</b> horse, thoroughbreds and sedentary halfbreds and largest for heavy halfbreds. The athletic halfbred thus showed reduced bone dimensions when compared with other horse types. Navicular bones from 61 horses were studied histomorphometrically. Light horses and ponies possessed larger amounts of cancellous bone and less cortical bone. Draft horses and heavy ponies showed marked thickening of cortical bone with minimum intracortical porosity, {{and a decrease in}} marrow spaces associated with more trabecular bone. Two distinct zones were observed for the flexor surface cortex: an external zone composed mainly of poorly remodelled lamellar bone, disposed in a distoproximal oblique direction, and an internal zone composed mainly of secondary bone, with a lateromedial direction for haversian canals. Flexor cortex external zone tended to be smaller for heavy ponies than for the light ponies. It was the opposite for horses, with the largest amount of external zone registered for draft horses. In athletic horses, we observed an increase in the amount of cortical bone at the expense of cancellous bone which could be the result of reduced resorption and increased formation at the corticoendosteal junction. Cancellous bone was reduced for the athletic horses but the number of trabeculae and their specific surfaces were larger. Increased bone formation and reduced resorption could also account for these differences. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Sequencing {{pathogen}} genomes is costly, demanding careful {{allocation of}} limited sequencing resources. We built a computational Sequencing Analysis Pipeline (SAP) to guide decisions regarding {{the amount of}} genomic sequencing necessary to develop high-quality diagnostic DNA and protein signatures. SAP uses simulations to estimate the number of target genomes and close phylogenetic relatives (near neighbors or NNs) to sequence. We use SAP to assess whether draft data are sufficient or finished sequencing is required using Marburg and variola virus sequences. Simulations indicate that <b>intermediate</b> to high-quality <b>draft</b> with error rates of 10 − 3 – 10 − 5 (∼ 8 × coverage) of target organisms is suitable for DNA signature prediction. Low-quality draft with error rates of ∼ 1 % (3 × to 6 × coverage) of target isolates is inadequate for DNA signature prediction, although low-quality draft of NNs is sufficient, {{as long as the}} target genomes are of high quality. For protein signature prediction, sequencing errors in target genomes substantially reduce the detection of amino acid sequence conservation, even if the draft is of high quality. In summary, high-quality draft of target and low-quality draft of NNs appears to be a cost-effective investment for DNA signature prediction, but may lead to underestimation of predicted protein signatures...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} important, and less disputed, core {{features}} of fictional works {{is that they are}} endowed with (representational) content. And it is out of discussion that the creation of a work is a deliberate process that leads to the work, usually through a sequence of <b>intermediates</b> stages or <b>drafts.</b> Thus, it is only natural to think of fiction-making as a deliberate process leading to a certain content through a series of intermediate contents. Let us call this view the content-choice conception of fiction-making. In this book the content-choice conception is elaborated on the background of a precise view of time and agency, that of so-called stit theory (see e. g., Belnap et al. 2001). A number of formal theories of fiction-making are formulated, which correspond to different conceptions of fiction-making and to different families of fiction. As we shall see, the content-choice conception is deeply in- grained in the way we speak and reason about fiction, and it also plays a role in the classification of fictional works. Further- more, an adequate understanding of fiction-making helps to shed some light on a variety of intertwined linguistic and inferential phenomena. Perhaps more pointedly, it enables us to account for fiction-related fragments of language that are beyond the scope of traditional philosophical analyses of fictional discourse...|$|R
25|$|The {{composition}} of Das Rheingold occupied Wagner from 1 November 1853 to 26 September 1854. He began {{by developing a}} preliminary draft (Gesamtentwurf) of the entire work from his sketches. This 77-page draft, which was written in pencil and on two (sometimes three) staves, was completed by 14 January 1854. The following month (1 February) he proceeded to make a second complete draft. It seems that his first intention {{was to make a}} composition draft in ink, just as he had done for Lohengrin, but as such a draft of the opening Prelude – which consists of little more than an arpeggiated E♭ major triad – would have been to all intents and purposes a full score, he decided to skip the <b>intermediate</b> stage and <b>draft</b> the full score in ink right away. This he proceeded to do with the Prelude, significantly revising some of its details in the process. When, however, he reached the beginning of Scene 1, he found that the remainder of the opera required too much revision and elaboration to allow him to develop a full score without first making a second complete draft. He therefore abandoned the full score in ink and proceeded to develop instead an instrumentation draft in pencil, in which he worked out most of the vocal and orchestral details of the four remaining scenes. This Instrumentationsskizze, as Wagner himself styled it, was completed by 28 May 1854.|$|R
