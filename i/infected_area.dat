25|$|Treatment is {{typically}} with antibiotics taken by mouth, such as cephalexin, amoxicillin, or cloxacillin. In {{those who are}} seriously allergic to penicillin, erythromycin or clindamycin may be used. When methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is a concern, doxycycline or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole may, in addition, be recommended. Concern {{is related to the}} presence of pus or previous MRSA infections. Elevating the <b>infected</b> <b>area</b> may be useful, as may pain killers.|$|E

25|$|The valves of {{the heart}} do not receive any {{dedicated}} blood supply. As a result, defensive immune system mechanisms (such as white blood cells) cannot directly reach the valves via the bloodstream. If an organism (such as bacteria) attaches to a valve surface and forms a vegetation, the host's immune response is blunted. The lack of blood supply to the valves also has implications for treatment, since drugs also have difficulty reaching the <b>infected</b> <b>area.</b>|$|E
25|$|MRSA is an {{infection}} {{that has a}} resistance to certain antibiotics this is why MRSA is so dangerous and hard to treat. MRSA stands for Methicillin- resistant Staphylococcus, which {{is a form of}} a staph infection. Any athlete who develops a skin infection should be checked by doctor immediately. Also, one should resist from trying to give themselves self care. When getting MRSA treated for they tend to make an incision and drain the <b>infected</b> <b>area.</b> MRSA can become life-threatening if it reaches the blood stream it also can cause infections on surgical sites that can cause major implications, and can even cause an pneumonia.|$|E
25|$|Topical {{steroids and}} {{antibiotic}} ointments such as Neosporin {{have not only}} shown to be ineffective in treating dermatophytosis caused by Aphanoascus fulvescens, but have {{also been shown to}} enhance its fungal growth. Ringworm infections caused by A.fulvescens in animals have been successfully treated with anti-fungal drugs such as Tinactin, which contains tolnaftate as its active ingredient, and Grisactin, which contains griseofulvin as its active ingredient. However, topical treatment of human A.fulvescens infections with tolnaftate-containing drugs has been shown to worsen the lesions, causing further inflammation and increased sensitivity. Treatment with griseofulvin has proven somewhat effective in reducing lesion sizes and appears to have a dose-dependent effect. It should be noted however that while lesions continue to heal after increased griseofulvin administration, there is some residual scarring of the <b>infected</b> <b>area.</b> Currently, there is no documentation providing evidence of an anti-fungal treatment that is completely effective against human dermatophytosis caused by A.fulvescens.|$|E
50|$|There is no {{vaccine for}} SVD. Prevention {{measures}} {{are similar to}} those for foot-and-mouth disease: controlling animals imported from <b>infected</b> <b>areas,</b> and sanitary disposal of garbage from international aircraft and ships, and thorough cooking of garbage. Infected animals should be placed in strict quarantine. Eradication measures for the disease include quarantining <b>infected</b> <b>areas,</b> depopulation and disposal of infected and contact pigs, and cleaning and disinfectingcontaminated premises.|$|R

50|$|Black point (kernel smudge or just smudge) is a {{fungal disease}} that affects wheat, barley and rye. It {{is caused by}} various species of Alternaria, Fusarium, and Helminthosporium, and {{possibly}} other fungal genera. The fungus forms after the seeds have set but while they are still green and it is potentiated by high humidity. <b>Infected</b> <b>areas</b> are brown to black in color, and as the disease spreads the kernels may become shriveled. Occasionally the <b>infected</b> <b>areas</b> have a reddish tinge.|$|R
25|$|In Scania (Skåne), {{the plague}} arrived on 20 (O.S.)/ 30 November 1710, when an {{infected}} Västanå boatman {{returned home from}} the navy. Scania had not yet fully recovered from the Scanian War when its population was further weakened by a measles epidemic in 1706, a crop failure and the outbreak of smallpox in 1708–1709, an invasion of the Danish army in 1709, the expulsion of this army after the battle of Helsingborg, followed by conscriptions into the Swedish army and an outbreak of typhus in 1710. While Scania was protected from an infection from the north by a cordon sanitaire between it and Småland, the plague came by sea and made landfall not only in Västanå, but also in January 1711 in Domsten in Allerum parish, where the locals had ignored the ban on contact with their relatives and friends on the Danish side of the Sound, most notably in the <b>infected</b> <b>area</b> around Helsingør (Elsinore); the third {{starting point for the}} plague in Scania was Ystad, where on 19 June an infected soldier arrived from Swedish Pomerania. The plague remained in Scania until 1713, probably 1714.|$|E
500|$|The Board of Health {{was led by}} Chief Health Officer Walter R. Nursey. All matters {{regarding}} quarantine {{within the}} district were handled by Edmund A. Struthers. The board was established to confine and treat the smallpox epidemic in the territory, and had wide powers {{to carry out this}} mission. The Board of Health established vaccination programs among native populations in the District of Keewatin based on legislation that continued well after the Council was dissolved. [...] Mr Nursey was despatched by Governor Morris in February 1877 with a quarantine party to Lake Winnipeg to establish a northern quarantine and sanitary cordon between the City of Winnipeg and the <b>infected</b> <b>area.</b> This party was to regulate the traffic in fur as well. The party arrived at Dog Head outpost in May 1877, having travelled the winter months by foot. There were no supplies, money or instruction on arrival. The quarantine party returned to Winnipeg in July 1877 half starved.|$|E

40|$|Background: A {{molecular}} {{survey was}} conducted to investigate the presence of pathogenic Borrelia persica species caus­ing the tick borne relapsing fever (TBRF) in Takistan district Qazvin Province, western Iran. Methods: A number of 1021 s oft ticks were collected from 31 villages including previously reported infected and none-infected TBRF cases and individually examined {{for the presence of}} B. persica DNA by conventional PCR target­ing the 16 S rRNA. Results: A total of 1021 soft ticks of three species of Ornithodouros tholozani (120 : 11. 75 %), O. lahorensis (461 : 45. 15 %) and Argas persicus (440 : 43. 1 %) were collected and tested against Borrelia infection. Soft ticks were more preva­lent (67 %) in <b>infected</b> <b>areas</b> than none <b>infected</b> <b>areas.</b> The rate O. tholozani in <b>infected</b> <b>areas</b> was much greater (29 times) than none <b>infected</b> <b>areas.</b> Ninety seven percent of soft ticks in none <b>infected</b> <b>areas</b> were of O. tholozani. Six­teen (16. 7 %) ticks of tested (n= 95) O. tholozani were infected with B. persica. Three (1. 3 %) out of 205 soft ticks of O. lahorensis were positive for Borrelia sp., and no infection was observed in A. persicus. Taq I RFLP analysis and se­quence analysis of the positive PCR products showed the presence of B. persica. The RFLP analysis showed that the positive ticks of O. lahorensis were infected with unknown Borrelia species. Conclusion: This study showed that although there were no TBRF cases in Takisan, but still infected O. tholozani, the known vector of TBRF, presented in the region. Control measures needs to be fulfilled in Thakisan.   </p...|$|R

50|$|Diagnosis of Tinea Barbae will firstly include {{questions}} {{being asked}} from doctors about interactions with farm animals and lifestyle experiences.

To acquire causation of Tinea Barbae putting <b>infected</b> <b>area</b> under ultraviolet light can achieve this, as infection caused by animal and human contact will not show up as fluorescent under the ultraviolet light, compared to other causes of this disease.|$|E

5000|$|Collection: Skin, nail, or hair {{samples are}} {{collected}} from the <b>infected</b> <b>area</b> on the patient.

50|$|They are fungal {{diseases}} that can infect {{different parts of}} the host plants (i.e. leaves, stems, flowers) and usually create black spores called teliospores in the <b>infected</b> <b>area.</b> Teliospores produce sporidia, white smut, and can survive under harsh environmental conditions. Therefore, {{the most effective way to}} prevent the spread of this fungal disease is to remove and destroy the <b>infected</b> <b>area</b> of the plant. Fungicides can be used to control the spread of smut; however, they must be applied before symptoms appear to be effective.|$|E
