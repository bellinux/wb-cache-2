40|$|Planar {{structures}} cannot emit {{more heat}} by radiation than predicted by Stefan- Boltzmann’s law. However, when two reservoirs are connected by an <b>intermediate</b> <b>slab</b> which {{is placed in}} their near-field one can in principle observe a super-Planckian heat flux at separation distances larger than the thermal wavelength, if the evanescent contributions can be perfectly guided through the <b>intermediate</b> <b>slab.</b> In this case study we discuss in particular how the thermal near-field of the surface modes of two SiC reservoirs can be guided through an ideal dielectric, a perfect lens and a hyperbolic waveguide. A detailed study of the parameters {{needed in order to}} have a long-range guiding of thermal radiation shows which properties are ideally needed in order to observe a super-Planckian heat flux. In particular hyperbolic materials which are known for their large penetration depth of radiative heat fluxes are promising materials. This result opens the way to long distance transport of near-field thermal energy...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{value of}} {{prestress}} when manufacturing reinforced concrete structures {{is given in}} an arbitrary way within limits of maximum and minimum values that are recommended as normal values. While making calculations, {{it is necessary to}} ensure the implementation of a number of requirements that guarantee the operability of structures. Increasing prestress level leads to the upgrade of the cracking resistance and rigidity performance, {{and at the same time}} gives rise to the danger of destruction resulting from the concrete compression and destruction of bonds in a stress transfer zone from reinforcement to concrete at the manufacturing stage, as well as reduces the strength of a combined action of the bending moment and the transverse force near supporting structures. These problems become relevant during the production of hollow-core slabs in the process of formless molding as the installation of additional reinforcement in these slabs for increasing the bond strength near the supporting structures is impossible because of technological molding peculiarities. The need to optimize the value of prestess is conditioned by the occurrence of damages that appear at the manufacturing stage of <b>intermediate</b> hollow-core <b>slabs</b> of formless molding. The algorithm of optimization is introduced taking into account the ensuring of requirements of bond strength of reinforcement and concrete in the stress transfer zone, compression strength and cracking resistance...|$|R
40|$|Bedrock {{underlying}} the Slab iron oxide-copper-gold occurrence consists of fine-grained sedimentary rocks and schist of the Fairchild Lake Group (oldest {{unit of the}} Early Proterozoic Wernecke Supergroup), <b>intermediate</b> to mafic <b>Slab</b> volcanics, dioritic Bonnet Plume River Intrusions, and Early Proterozoic Wernecke Breccia that crosscuts all other units. The Wernecke Breccia was divided into two units: Type 1 and Type 2. Type 1 is limited in extent and consists of sedimentary and locally abundant massive magnetite clasts in a carbonate magnetite matrix. Type 2 cuts Type 1 and comprises sedimentary clasts in a micro-breccia matrix. Iron oxide-copper-gold mineralization is associated with Wernecke Breccia. It occurs disseminated in quartz-carbonate veins cutting metasomatized sedimentary rocks, as sulphide veins that cut Type 1 breccia, as sulphide clasts in Type 2 breccia, as well as disseminated in the matrix of Type 2 breccia, and finally as sulphide veinlets crosscutting Type 2 breccia...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{there were}} created many {{tests of the}} {{composite}} floor slabs with fibre concrete at ambient and at elevated temperature in real scales. Rectangular floor concrete slabs reinforced only by steel fibres and supported by steel beams were tested. One of the main purposes of those experiments was to create and evaluate new analytical model, which precisely predict fire resistance of the composite slabs. For this analytical model, there were introduced basic boundary conditions, which defined field of the utilization. At the elevated temperature, slabs were only partially protected. Only edge beams were protected by the floor <b>slabs.</b> <b>Intermediate</b> beams and fibre concrete slab were without protection. Suitable properties of the fibre concrete in fire were clearly demonstrated during the tests. There {{is important for the}} fire resistance of the floor slabs that material has a necessary tensile strength and ductility. The same mixture of the concrete, but with different kinds of fibres was used {{in the course of the}} tests. The fibres had different length, strength and amount. The material properties of the fibre concrete allow creating a different load bearing mechanism, which increase fire resistance of the floor slabs. Thanks to this mechanism, the fire resistance of the slab can reach 60 min and more. Experiments of determination of material properties were made. These tests were carried out at ambient and at elevated temperature...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} thermal Casimir effect between two thick slabs {{composed}} of plane-parallel layers of random dielectric materials interacting across an intervening homogeneous dielectric. It is {{found that the}} effective interaction at long distances is self averaging and its value is given by a that between non-random media with the effective dielectric tensor of the corresponding random media. The behavior at short distances becomes random (sample dependent) and {{is dominated by the}} local values of the dielectric constants proximal to each other across the homogeneous slab. These results are extended to the regime of <b>intermediate</b> <b>slab</b> separations by using perturbation theory for weak disorder and also by extensive numerical simulations for a number of systems where the dielectric function has a log-normal distribution.

The numerical modeling of the slab is performed with PC “Lira-SAPR 2013 ”. The paper describes finite elements used in calculations, {{the conditions of}} the slab reinforcement, concrete and wire rope reinforcement connections. The calculation results are shown as stress isofields in concrete and steel elements of the slab. The paper also estimates pre-stressed wire rope reinforcement efficiency when used in slab and beam floor. The authors compare stress and strain condition of typical monolith slab and beam floor with reinforcement bars and slab and beam floor with wire rope reinforcement while changing <b>intermediate</b> <b>slab</b> thickness. The results are presented as a finite element model of monolith slab and beam floor with pre-stressed wire rope reinforcement and with untensioned reinforcement...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} Casimir-Lifshitz {{force and the}} {{radiative}} heat transfer in a system consisting of three bodies held at three independent temperatures and immersed in a thermal environment, the whole system being in a stationary configuration out of thermal equilibrium. The theory we develop is valid for arbitrary bodies, i. e. for any set of temperatures, dielectric and geometrical properties, and describes each body by means of its scattering operators. For the three-body system we provide a closed-form unified expression of the radiative heat transfer and of the Casimir-Lifshitz force (both {{in and out of}} thermal equilibrium). This expression is thus first applied to the case of three planar parallel slabs. In this context we discuss the non-additivity of the force at thermal equilibrium, as well as the equilibrium temperature of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>slab</b> as a function of its position between two external slabs having different temperatures. Finally, we consider the force acting on an atom inside a planar cavity. We show that, differently from the equilibrium configuration, the absence of thermal equilibrium admits one or more positions of minima for the atomic potential. While the corresponding atomic potential depths are very small for typical ground state atoms, they may become particularly relevant for Rydberg atoms, becoming a promising tool to produce an atomic trap.

40|$|The {{volcanic}} complexes {{from the}} Eolian islands to the Campania/Roman regions and Tuscany further north, rest on lithospheric sectors which overlie the Adriatic continental lithosphere sinking along the Apennine-Maghrebian orogenic belt. Evidence for this {{stems from the}} melting, at mantle depth, of upper crustal material {{as evidenced by the}} widespread interaction of S-type and K-alkaline melts. The genesis of atypical magmas of the Roman Province (central-southern Italy) appears {{to be the result of}} an important block faulting and deep lithospheric rifting of the Apennine continental margin lying parallel and above relic sinking <b>slabs.</b> <b>Intermediate</b> and deep-focus earthquakes indicate that the lithospheric slab is still seismically active under the Eolian-Calabrian area and, sporadically, at the southern end of Campania. On the other end, in the Roman/Tuscan region, it seems to be almost inactive, few earthquakes having been located with hypocentral depths not exceeding 150 km. The existence of lithospheric slabs along the Tyrrhenian rim is supported by surface wave dispersion and scattering measurements as well as P-waves residuals, and is confirmed by the trend of long-wavelengths gravity anomalies, interpreted within the geometrical constraints imposed by aeromagnetic and seismic data. The analysis of the spectral content of seismic sources supports the existence of two zones of lithospheric shortening in correspondence of Tuscany and South Tyrrhenian sea which are separated by a tensional region extending from Latium to Calabry...|$|R
40|$|Subducting slabs {{provide the}} main driving force for plate motion and {{flow in the}} Earth's mantle, and geodynamic, seismic and geochemical studies offer insight into slab {{dynamics}} and subduction-induced flow. Most previous geodynamic studies treat subduction zones as either infinite in trench-parallel extent (that is, two-dimensional) or finite in width but fixed in space. Subduction zones and their associated slabs are, however, limited in lateral extent (250 - 7, 400 km) and their three-dimensional geometry evolves over time. Here we show that slab width controls two first-order features of plate tectonics-the curvature of subduction zones and their tendency to retreat backwards with time. Using three-dimensional numerical simulations of free subduction, we show that trench migration rate is inversely related to slab width and depends on proximity to a lateral slab edge. These {{results are consistent with}} retreat velocities observed globally, with maximum velocities (6 - 16 cm yr- 1) only observed close to slab edges (2, 000 km) retreat velocities are always slow (< 2. 0 cm yr- 1). Models with narrow slabs (≤ 1, 500 km) retreat fast and develop a curved geometry, concave towards the mantle wedge side. Models with <b>slabs</b> <b>intermediate</b> in width (∼ 2, 000 - 3, 000 km) are sublinear and retreat more slowly. Models with wide slabs (≥ 4, 000 km) are nearly stationary in the centre and develop a convex geometry, whereas trench retreat increases towards concave-shaped edges. Additionally, we identify periods (5 - 10 Myr) of slow trench advance at the centre of wide slabs. Such wide-slab behaviour may explain mountain building in the central Andes, as being a consequence of its tectonic setting, far from slab edges...|$|R
40|$|The {{correlation}} between segregation kinetics and the geometric and chemical structure of iron-rich Fe 1 −xAlx(100) surfaces was investigated for four samples with different bulk stoichiometries (x = 0. 03, 0. 15, 0. 30, 0. 47) using quantitative low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES). After being largely depleted of Al through preferential sputtering, the surfaces were annealed in a stepwise fashion. Auger signals {{as well as}} LEED patterns and intensity spectra were recorded for the transient phases which developed after each step, so monitoring the surfaces ’ return to equilibrium by means of aluminium segregation. They were used as fingerprints for comparison to the corresponding data of the equilibrium phases which had been analysed quantitatively in earlier investigations. It appears that transient phases of a sample with a certain bulk Al concentration can be identified with equilibrium phases of samples with lower bulk Al content. In other words, {{the structure of the}} surface slab accessible by means of LEED and AES is dictated by the actual <b>intermediate</b> <b>slab</b> stoichiometry in accordance with the bulk phase diagram and prevailing local quasi-equilibrium. The intermediate structures are metastable {{in the sense that the}} full equilibration of the crystal is kinetically limited by long-range mass transport from the bulk. In contrast, the top layer is always aluminium rich in accordance with the full equilibrium with the surface slab. So, the kinetics observed is dominated by the equilibration between the surface slab and the bulk, a feature possibly applying generally for stoichiometric equilibration in surfaces. 1...|$|E
