25|$|The Surubim was a low-winged {{monoplane}} with a retractable tailwheel undercarriage of all wooden construction with plywood skinning, using Brazilian Pine and Freijo, two indigenous woods.

25|$|The Be-103 {{features}} include an advanced, blended wing, swept at 22°, with -long <b>fixed</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> slats, trailing-link main landing gear, and three-bladed MT-12 reverse pitch propellers. Fuel {{is stored in}} the wet wings. The aircraft is built from aluminum-lithium alloy with titanium used in high-stress areas. A 30-parameter, five-hour flight data recorder, engine fire-detection systems and an ice detector are also standard, as are hydraulic brakes. However, unlike most modern aircraft, the Be-103 is not equipped with wing flaps.|$|E
25|$|The Sperrin {{employed}} a traditional straight wing, although the wing's <b>fixed</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> was slightly swept and featured curved fillets {{at the junction}} with the engine nacelles. The trailing edge had simple flaps inboard of the nacelles and large ailerons outboard; the outer flaps were to incorporate air brakes, but this was replaced with split-brakes prior to the first flight. Both the flaps and air brakes were primarily operated hydraulically, an independent system for emergency actuation was also present. Up to 6,170 imperial gallons of fuel could be housed {{in a total of}} 22 fuel tanks, 14 of these being contained within the wings and a further 8 within the fuselage; these tanks were pressurized to prevent collapse during fast dives and other manoeuvres. The wing was fixed to the fuselage at a mid-wing position, located between the bomb bay and fuselage fuel tanks.|$|E

2500|$|Development of the Pegazair {{started in}} 1985 by Serg Dufour of Mont-Saint-Michel, Quebec.

500|$|The Lavochkin OKB {{was ordered}} to design a fighter using a single Junkers Jumo 004B axial-flow {{turbojet}} in February 1945.

The wings of the all-metal aircraft had <b>fixed</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> and slotted flaps. The cockpit was well forward, giving the pilot good visibility, and he was protected by an armored headrest. The windscreen of the teardrop-shaped canopy was also armored.

50|$|In {{aircraft}} design and aerospace engineering, a high-lift device is a component or mechanism on an aircraft's wing {{that increases the}} amount of lift produced by the wing.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a numerical {{study on the}} self-induced flapping dynamics of an inverted flexible foil {{in the context of}} energy harvesting using piezoelectric elements. The inverted foil considered in this study is clamped at the trailing <b>edge</b> and the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> is free to oscillate. To simulate the nonlinear flap-ping dynamics of an inverted flexible foil, a high-order coupled fluid-structure solver based on the combined field with explicit interface (CFEI) has been developed. Additionally, a simplified piezoelectric model has been presented to determine the elec-tric energy that can be harvested through flapping. The coupled solver is validated over a flexible foil <b>fixed</b> at the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> and trailing edge free to oscillate. A systematic study on the flapping response of an inverted flexible foil has been performed {{for a wide range of}} non-dimensional bending rigidity for a fixed Reynolds number of 1000 and mass ratio of 0. 1. As a func-tion of decreasing bending rigidity, four flapping regimes have been observed: (i) fixed-point stable, (ii) inverted limit-cycle oscillations, (iii) deformed flapping and (iv) flipped flapping. The inverted limit-cycle oscillations are characterized by low-frequency large amplitude oscillations which generate O(103) times greater strain energy than a flexible foil <b>fixed</b> at the <b>leading</b> <b>edge,</b> which has a profound impact on the development of ocean current based energy harvesting devices. ∗Address all correspondence to this author. ...|$|R

40|$|In a 2003 test {{campaign}} in the DLR-VAG dynamic stall test stand unsteady pressure distributions during dynamic stall have been measured on a 2 D-wing model with OA 312 airfoil section.

In addition to the experiments numerical calculations have been carried out based on the solution of the unsteady 2 D-RANS-equations including a turbulence and transition model. In the present investigation it is shown that different physical flow phenomena can be identified which are triggering the on-set procedure of dynamic stall. Three different flow-scenarios have been studied in detail: 1) 	Free transition during dynamic stall, (M= 0. 2). 2) 	Fully turbulent flow, (M= 0. 2). 3) 	Flow at M= 0. 4, compressibility effects.

40|$|The {{motion of}} a {{two-dimensional}} flag at a time-dependent {{angle of incidence}} to an irrotational flow of an inviscid, incompressible fluid is examined. The flag is modelled as a thin, flexible, impermeable membrane of finite mass with bending stiffness. The flag is <b>fixed</b> at the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> where it {{is assumed to be}} either freely hinged or clamped with zero gradient. The angle of incidence to the outer flow is assumed to be small and thin aerofoil theory and simple beam theory are employed to obtain a partial singular integro-differential equation for the flag shape. Steady solutions to the problem are calculated analytically for various limiting cases and numerically for order one values of a non-dimensional parameter that measures the relative importance of outer flow momentum flux and flexural rigidity. For the unsteady problem, the stability of steady solutions depends only upon two non-dimensional parameters. Stability analysis is performed in order to identify the regions of instability. The resulting quadratic eigenvalue problem is solved numerically and the marginal stability curves for both the hinged and the clamped flags are constructed. These curves show that both stable and unstable solutions may exist for various values of the mass and flexural rigidity of the membrane and for both methods of attachment at the <b>leading</b> <b>edge.</b> In order to confirm the results of the linear stability analysis, the full unsteady flag equation is solved numerically using an explicit method. The numerical solutions agree with the predictions of the linear stability analysis and also identify the shapes that the flag adopts according to the magnitude of the flexural rigidity and mass...|$|R
