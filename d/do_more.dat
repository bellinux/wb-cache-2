5|$|Actors {{and crew}} used their iPhones to {{communicate}} and store information such as the script—that way, they looked like guests casually using their phones. The phones were also used to record sound, in addition to digital recorders taped to each actor's body that were left running all day. For day scenes, Moore felt comfortable risking {{only three or four}} takes of each scene, but found he could <b>do</b> <b>more</b> at night.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the Second World War Gielgud volunteered for active service, but was told that men of his age, thirty-five, would not be wanted for at least six months.

5|$|George's initial {{contract}} included eight to eleven episodes of recurring appearances, {{with the possibility}} of becoming a series regular. However, according to George's representative, she did not intend to <b>do</b> <b>more</b> than eight episodes. Harris was first planned to have a romance with Torres, but Rhimes eventually changed that after George started filming. She was initially written as a lesbian, but was revised as bisexual.|$|E

5|$|Johnson's primary {{interest}} lay {{in improving}} the state's mental and penal institutions. These improvements began under Governor Chandler, and while Johnson stated that the mental hospitals and prisons were in their best condition in forty years {{by the end of}} his term, he was disappointed that he was not able to <b>do</b> <b>more.</b> In light of the financial obligations brought about by World War II, he had to curb state construction.|$|E
5|$|The {{key role}} women have in farming is to {{maintain}} ownership of the main sources of production in rural areas. In traditional China, women {{were not allowed to}} own land or property. Land was inherited through the sons, and if there was no son in the family, it was taken by a close male relative. In less populated areas, women <b>do</b> <b>more</b> agricultural work than men because of shifting cultivation. In more populated areas, men <b>do</b> <b>more</b> work than women because extensive plough cultivation is used. Female involvement is high in the double-cropping rice area. Other types of work women perform in the countryside include pig and poultry rearing, spinning, weaving, basket-making, and other handicrafts. This type of work supplements agricultural income.|$|E

5|$|Voluntary markets, also {{referred}} to as green power markets, are driven by consumer preference. Voluntary markets allow a consumer to choose to <b>do</b> <b>more</b> than policy decisions require and reduce the environmental impact of their electricity use. Voluntary green power products must offer a significant benefit and value to buyers to be successful. Benefits may include zero or reduced greenhouse gas emissions, other pollution reductions or other environmental improvements on power stations.|$|E

When she returns home that night, he {{questions}} her about its whereabouts, and savagely beats her with {{a bar of soap}} in a sock.|$|E
5|$|Although Du Bois {{generally}} endorsed socialist principles, {{his politics}} were strictly pragmatic: in 1929, Du Bois endorsed Democrat Jimmy Walker {{for mayor of}} New York, rather than the socialist Norman Thomas, believing that Walker could <b>do</b> <b>more</b> immediate good for blacks, even though Thomas' platform was more consistent with Du Bois's views. Throughout the 1920s, Du Bois and the NAACP shifted support {{back and forth between}} the Republican Party and the Democratic Party, induced by promises from the candidates to fight lynchings, improve working conditions, or support voting rights in the South; invariably, the candidates failed to deliver on their promises.|$|E

5|$|Although {{increasing}} {{echelons of}} the scale correspond to stronger winds, the rankings are not absolute in terms of effects. Lower-category storms can inflict greater damage than higher-category storms, depending on factors such as local terrain, population density and total rainfall. For instance, a Category2 hurricane that strikes a major urban area will likely <b>do</b> <b>more</b> damage than a large Category5 hurricane that strikes a mostly rural region. In fact, tropical systems of less than hurricane strength can produce significant damage and human casualties, especially from flooding and landslides.|$|E
5|$|As the Philadelphia Council's newly hired field {{executive}} in 1915, one of Goodman's assignments was {{to serve as}} director of the council's summer camp at Treasure Island Scout Reservation on the Delaware River. He believed that the summer camp experience should <b>do</b> <b>more</b> than just teach proficiency in Scoutcraft skills; rather, the principles embodied in the Scout Oath and Scout Law should become realities in the lives of Scouts. Along with his assistant camp director, Carroll A. Edson, he started an experimental program to recognize those Scouts best exemplifying those traits as an example to their peers.|$|E
5|$|Bart {{attempts}} to reinspire Krusty by showing him old episodes of the show, but {{he picks up}} on the repetitive nature of his own jokes, and binge drinks in anger. He passes out and has a vision of himself in Jewish Heaven, where he meets Rodney Dangerfield. Rabbi Krustofski then appears and tells Krusty that Jews {{do not believe in}} Heaven, and thus he should <b>do</b> <b>more</b> to help others. An act of kindness does not seem to make him happier, but Bart takes Krusty to the synagogue, where Rabbi Krustofski's favorite Rabbi recites Krusty's jokes on religion. Krusty therefore deduces that his father did find him funny, and sees him again in Jewish Heaven, where Jesus turns Dangerfield's water into a Bloody Mary.|$|E

40|$|On {{the basis}} of the 1998 General Social Survey on Time Use, the {{relative}} participation in paid and unpaid work of partners in a household is classified into three types: complementary wherein one partner, usually the wife, <b>does</b> <b>more</b> unpaid work while the other partner <b>does</b> <b>more</b> paid work; double burden wherein one partner <b>does</b> <b>more</b> unpaid work while <b>doing</b> <b>more</b> or the same amount of paid work; and shared roles wherein both partners do about the same amount unpaid work. Couples who are cohabiting, and couples where both partners are working fulltime, have a higher likelihood of both shared roles and double burdens, compared to complementary roles. Shared roles are less common at older ages, with lower levels of education, and for those with higher religiosity. Double-burdens are more common when there are no children, also less common in rural areas, but more common in communities where there is a low proportion of immigrants...|$|R

5|$|By 1958, Lê Duẩn {{ranked second}} only to Hồ in the party hierarchy, {{although}} Trường Chinh remained powerful. Lê Duẩn was a party man and never held a post in the government. He made a brief, secret visit to South Vietnam in 1958, writing a report, The Path to Revolution in the South, in which he stated that the North Vietnamese had to <b>do</b> <b>more</b> to assist the southern fighters. The Central Committee decided to initiate the revolution in January 1959.|$|E
5|$|Ford reluctantly {{agreed to}} run for office in 1976, but first he had to counter a {{challenge}} for the Republican party nomination. Former Governor of California Ronald Reagan and the party's conservative wing faulted Ford for failing to <b>do</b> <b>more</b> in South Vietnam, for signing the Helsinki Accords, and for negotiating to cede the Panama Canal. (Negotiations for the canal continued under President Carter, who eventually signed the Torrijos–Carter Treaties.) Reagan launched his campaign in autumn of 1975 and won numerous primaries, including North Carolina, Texas, Indiana, and California, but failed to get a majority of delegates; Reagan withdrew from the race at the Republican Convention in Kansas City, Missouri. The conservative insurgency did lead to Ford dropping the more liberal Vice President Nelson Rockefeller in favor of U.S. Senator Bob Dole of Kansas.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, {{the band}} {{released}} its Island Records debut, The Artist in the Ambulance. The album's title is {{in reference to}} Burn Collector by Al Burian and is meant to reflect the band's desire to <b>do</b> <b>more</b> than make music and contribute to society through their charitable donations. A portion of the album's proceeds were this time donated to the Syrentha Savio Endowment, a financial aid organization for breast cancer patients. First pressings of the album were packaged in a digipak-style case with postcards containing lyrics and notes from the band.|$|E

The marriage did not produce any issue, though Ernest apparently fathered at least three illegitimate children in later years.|$|E
5|$|L'Orfeo is, in Redlich's analysis, {{the product}} of two musical epochs. It {{combines}} elements of the traditional madrigal style of the 16th century {{with those of the}} emerging Florentine mode, in particular the use of recitative and monodic singing as developed by the Camerata and their successors. In this new style, the text dominates the music; while sinfonias and instrumental ritornelli illustrate the action, the audience's attention is always drawn primarily to the words. The singers are required to <b>do</b> <b>more</b> than produce pleasant vocal sounds; they must represent their characters in depth and convey appropriate emotions.|$|E
5|$|Mulder confronts Skinner and The Smoking Man, {{believing that}} he and Scully were deceived into taking the case without knowing about the contagion.

The Smoking Man {{counters}} that public knowledge of the truth would create mass panic and <b>do</b> <b>more</b> harm than good. Mulder tries to take his case to Scully, but she agrees that exposing Pinck {{may result in a}} deadly hysteria. Paul becomes the only remaining proof of the company's crimes, but he takes a hostage and is killed by the Marshals before Mulder can convince him to divulge the contents of Torrance's package. The episode ends with Skinner warning Mulder to be more wary of the situations he will find himself in.|$|E
