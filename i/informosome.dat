40|$|After transcription, {{processing}} and transport to the cytoplasm the mRNA {{may become a}} subject of various factors which activate or repress its translation. This work aimed to determine the start time of translation of mRNAs stored in the egg or transcribed from the zygote genome. The polyribosome/ <b>informosomes</b> ratio served as a criterion of mRNA involvement in translation. Here we used cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation to study the distribution of Xwnt- 11, Xnot- 2, Xbra and Xgsc mRNAs between polyribosomes and <b>informosomes</b> in the eggs and early embryos of Xenopus laevis and Rana temporaria. Present results gave evidence that specific mRNAs which encode proteins participating in dorsoventral differentiation, follow individual dynamics of activation and inactivation...|$|R
40|$|In the {{cytoplasm}} of eucaryotic cells, mRNA {{is associated}} with proteins. These mRNA-protein complexes, termed messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) particles, are divided into two functional classes. The first class contains free (non-ribosome-associated) mRNPs which have been termed <b>informosomes</b> by others. The second class of mRNPs, those associated with polysomes, are actively engaged in protein synthesis and are termed polysomal mRNPs. The experiments described in this paper examined the proteins associated with polyribosomes in uninfected and herpes simplex virus type 1 -infected cells. The data indicate that after infection with herpes simplex virus type 1, specific changes occur in the proteins which normally are found associated with these polysomal mRNPs. These changes include both the appearance of new and possibly virus-specific proteins {{and the loss of}} normal host-specific proteins. The relationship of these changes to the patterns of protein synthesis in these cells is also discussed...|$|R
40|$|We have {{examined}} the relationship between the newly synthesized mRNA that enters polysomes in sea urchin embryos and the messengerlike RNA that enters the pool of ribosome-free ribonucleoprotein particles (free RNPs or <b>informosomes).</b> Although the RNA in the free RNPs turns over 25 % more rapidly than in the polysomes, labeling kinetics indicate that the RNA containing poly(A) [poly(A) (+) RNA] and the RNA not containing poly(A) [poly(A) (-) RNA] within each cytoplasmic compartment have very similar half-lives. The poly(A) (+) RNA from both free RNPs and polysomes binds ribosomes almost equally well in a reticulocyte lysate, and this binding is sensitive to inhibitors of initiation. The poly(A) (-) RNA from polysomes initiates as well as poly(A) (+) RNA; however, poly(A) (-) RNA from free RNPs is only half as efficient in binding to ribosomes, and by this criterion is only 50 % mRNA...|$|R
40|$|Till now the {{transcription}} factor Xvent- 2 {{has been studied}} in Xenopus embryos only by the mRNA testing. We use immunochemical methods for testing of the Xvent- 2 protein and gradient-centrifugation methods for estimation of activity of its mRNA. Our {{results show that the}} Xvent- 2 protein is present in eggs and early embryos. The Xvent- 2 mRNA is absent at any of these developmental stages. The majority of mRNA synthesized on the zygotic genome was stored in <b>informosomes,</b> while only its small part could be revealed in polysomes. The spatial patterning of the Xvent- 2 protein at different developmental stages did not entirely agree with that of its mRNA. These data indicate that the Xvent- 2 protein functioning in Xenopu embryos is regulated not only at {{the transcription}}, but at translation and posttranslation as well. We propose that the activation of translation on the masked Xvent- 2 mRNA may lead to blood differentiation and cell migration...|$|R
40|$|We {{provide a}} brief history of polyribosomes, ergosomes, prosomes, <b>informosomes,</b> {{maternal}} mRNA, stored mRNA, and RNP particles. Even though most published research focuses on total mRNA rather than polysomal mRNA and often assumes they are synonymous – i. e., if a functional mRNA is present, it must be translated – results from our laboratories comparing polysomal RNA and total mRNA in a range of “normal” issues show that some transcripts are almost totally absent from polysomes while others are almost entirely associated with polysomes. We describe a recent model from yeast showing various destinies for polysomal mRNA once it has been released from polysomes. The main points we want to emphasize are; a) when mRNA leaves polysomes to go to prosomes, P-bodies, stress granules, etc., it is not necessarily destined for degradation – it can be re-utilized; b) “normal” tissue, not just seeds and stressed tissue, contains functional non-polysomal mRNA; c) association of mRNA with different classes of polysomes affects their sub-cellular location and translatability; and d) drawbacks, misinterpretations, and false hopes arise from analysis of total mRNA rather than polysomal mRNA and from presuming that all polysomes are “created equal”...|$|R
