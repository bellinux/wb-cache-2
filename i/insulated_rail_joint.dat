When loaded wheels pass the gap, they induce an impact loading with the corresponding strains in the railhead edges exceeding the plastic limit significantly, which lead to metal flow across the gap thereby increasing the risk of short circuiting and impeding the proper functioning of the signalling and broken rail identification circuitries, of which the joints are a critical part. The performance of <b>insulated</b> <b>rail</b> <b>joints</b> under the passage of the wheel loading is complex due to the presence of a number of interacting components and hence is not well understood.

An extensive field test was, therefore, conducted on an in-service heavy haul corridor in Australia with the specific aim of understanding the effect of the track input on the response of the IRJs. Data on the wheelâ€“rail force, rail/joint-bar strain, sleeper acceleration and ballast pressure signa-tures in the time domain were determined from the experiment.

Unfortunately, IRJs exhibit several failure modes due to complex interaction between their components, the load spectra and the support conditions. A novel idea of simplifying {{the design of the}} IRJs consisting of only two pieces of <b>insulated</b> <b>rails</b> embedded into a concrete sleeper {{in such a way that}} the free ends of the rails at the gap attain stiffness commensurate to that of the current designs where the gapped rails are connected with two joint bars (also known as fishplates) one on each side of the rail web with the assembly resting on top of sleepers. The advantages of the new design are that it exhibits stability levels comparable to the current designs with fewer components and hence fewer failure modes. A multi-objective optimisation framework was used for the development of the new design that enables safe passage of train wheels across the gap between the rails embedded in concrete sleepers. Feasibility of the sleeper embedded gapped <b>insulated</b> <b>rails</b> under traffic loading is demonstrated through a dynamic analysis of a rail wheel rolling on top of a selected optimal design from the Pareto front.

40|$|Abstract: Adhesively bonded <b>insulated</b> <b>rail</b> <b>joints</b> {{are used}} to {{electrically}} isolate sections of track into discrete blocks to detect the positions of trains, and are sometimes useful in detecting rail breaks. Recent advances in high-strength rails allow {{for the use of}} higher-weight cars. With this increased axle loading of the freight lines, bonded <b>rail</b> <b>joints</b> are encountering early breakdown through either electrical or mechanical failure. Service lives as short as 12 â€“ 18 months have been reported on some rail lines, significantly lower than the lifetime of other railway components. The cost of replacing the joints has significantly increased the desire for a joint with improved durability. Commercially available bonded <b>rail</b> <b>joints</b> are typically double butt-strap joints consisting of two steel reinforcing joint bars, bonded to the rails with an epoxy adhesive that may contain a fibreglass or aramid cloth layer. This paper investigates a tapered bonded joint that was proposed to reduce the high stresses that can result in the more typical butt-strap joint configuration. The first type of analysis models the <b>rails</b> and <b>joint</b> bars as beams, and the adhesive and ground as distributed elastic springs. Approximate solutions are obtained {{with the use of the}} Rayleighâ€“Ritz method. The finite-element method is used in the second type of analysis.

Basedon theseanalyses, tapered insulated joints shouldpro-vide some advantages over conventional <b>insulated</b> <b>rail</b> <b>joints,</b> such as lower deflections, bending moments, and shear stresses in the adhesive...|$|R
40|$|Finite element {{analysis}} of the mechanical behaviour of <b>insulated</b> <b>rail</b> <b>joints</b> due to impact loadings Nirmal Kumar Mandal <b>Insulated</b> <b>rail</b> <b>joints</b> (IRJs) are safety-critical components in the signalling system of rail corridors. They are subjected to dynamic loads generated by heavy rolling-stock/track- system interactions and degrade faster than the other components of the rail track. Degraded IRJs diminish {{the reliability of the}} signalling system, thus posing a serious threat to the safety of rail operations. Therefore, there is a pressing need to closely examine the failure mechanisms of the end posts made of insulated material and inserted into the discontinuity in the rail at IRJs with a view to improving their service life, reliability and efficiency. Only a limited literature is available that examines different materials for IRJ end posts, and these primarily focus on contact pressure and contact stress distributions {{in the vicinity of the}} end post, disregarding the damage to the rail ends and end post materials.

IRJ failure can result from progressive defects, the propagation of which is influenced by residual stresses in the rail. Residual stresses change significantly during service due to the complex deformation and damage effects associated with wheel rolling, sliding and impact.
