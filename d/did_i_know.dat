500|$|Big Star {{returned}} in 1993 {{with a new}} line-up when guitarist Jon Auer and bassist Ken Stringfellow joined Chilton and Stephens. Auer and Stringfellow remained members of the Posies, founded by the pair in 1986. Stringfellow is also known for his work with R.E.M. and the Minus 5. Hummel elected not to participate. [...] First-era material dominated Big Star's performances, with the occasional addition of a song from the 2005 album In Space; Stringfellow recalled that during the 1990s, [...] "We were working out the set list {{and we went to}} this little cafe. Little <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> we'd be playing that set for the next ten years". The resurrected band made its debut at the 1993 University of Missouri spring music festival. A recording of the performance was issued on CD by Zoo Records as Columbia: Live at Missouri University. The concert was followed by tours of Europe and Japan, as well as an appearance on The Tonight Show.|$|E
500|$|Some have {{suggested}} that Plath had not intended to kill herself. That morning, she asked her downstairs neighbor, a Mr.Thomas, what time he would be leaving. She also left a note reading [...] "Call Dr.Horder," [...] including the doctor's phone number. Therefore, it is argued Plath turned on the gas {{at a time when}} Mr.Thomas {{would have been able to}} see the note. However, in her biography Giving Up: The Last Days of SylviaPlath, Plath's best friend, Jillian Becker wrote, [...] "According to Mr.Goodchild, a police officer attached to the coroner's office... had thrust her head far into the gas oven... had really meant to die." [...] Dr.Horder also believed her intention was clear. He stated that [...] "No one who saw the care with which the kitchen was prepared could have interpreted her action as anything but an irrational compulsion." [...] Plath had described the quality of her despair as [...] "owl's talons clenching my heart." [...] In his 1971 book on suicide, friend and critic Al Alvarez claimed that Plath's suicide was an unanswered cry for help, and spoke, in a BBC interview in March2000, about his failure to recognize Plath's depression, saying he regretted his inability to offer her emotional support: [...] "I failed her on that level. I was thirtyyears old and stupid. What <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> about chronic clinical depression? [...] She kind of needed someone to take care of her. And that was not something I could do." ...|$|E

2500|$|The famous Old English riddle Ic wæs be Sonde {{describes}} a conch: [...] "I was by sound, near seawall, at ocean-stream; I dwelt {{alone in my}} first resting place... Little <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that I, ere or since, ever should speak mouthless over mead-benches." [...] Another meaning given to this riddle [...] "Ic wæs be Sonde" [...] is that {{the sound of the}} conch corresponds to spiritualised sound as heard in higher realms. In the Hindu tradition, the conch shell is used in ceremony as the sound it makes is said to correspond with higher frequency universal sounds associated with music of the spheres.|$|E

2500|$|Alderman {{was injured}} in the first test of the 1982-83 Ashes. He had taken 1-84 in the first innings {{when there was a}} pitch invasion. Alderman was hit {{in the back of the}} head by a member of the crowd, Gary Donnison. Alderman recalled, [...] "he ran off, and I could see that there were no police in the {{vicinity}} so I attempted to apprehend him." [...] Alderman charged at Donnison and tackled him to the ground but fell on his shoulder and injured himself. [...] "I can't remember a lot of how I fell ... but I was immediately aware I was injured ... it was very painful indeed," [...] Alderman said. [...] "At the time I thought it would just pop back in - little <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that it would be a year before I could bowl in a competitive match again," [...] he said.

2500|$|... "At 12 noon on the {{eleventh}} {{day of the}} Fifth Month, my train from Hangchow arrived at the North Station Shanghai. In order to go quickly to the bank to send the money, I left my luggage at the depository and carried only a small bag with me. As soon as I {{came out of the}} train station, I saw a rather luxurious automobile and four Westerners standing by it. I did not realize that they were French, because in Shanghai there was a great mixture of Westerners and there were swarms of foreign visitors. It was quite common for cars to be used to pick up hotel guests. Little <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that this car was there to kidnap someone! When I had gone a few steps from the station, one of the Westerners {{came up to me and}} said in Mandarin: 'This car is very nice; please get in.' I politely refused, saying 'I do not need a car.' Suddenly, one of the Westerners behind the car with a great heave pushed me inside it, the engine accelerated and we were off like a shot. In no time we had already entered the French Concession. The car drew up to the waterfront, where a French warship was docked. I now became a prisoner on this warship." ...|$|E

2500|$|Nina Wadia has praised Womack and Wallace {{for their}} [...] "acting skills" [...] during the storyline. Wadia told The Sun: [...] "Sam and Jessie were amazing {{and it all}} got taken away from them because people made it out like a real baby had died. It's a soap. It's portraying fictional characters!" [...] Marc Elliott added: [...] "The storyline got whipped up into a massive frenzy. It's not {{representative}} in any way, shape or form of mothers {{who have lost their}} babies." [...] EastEnders actress Patsy Palmer has also praised the plot for its [...] "great acting". In an interview with Take It Easy, asked whether the show's bosses handled the storyline well, Palmer replied: [...] "I think they <b>did.</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> there's been loads of bad press, but something like that {{is always going to be}} sad to watch and it will upset people. But at the end of the day, it's a drama and it's not real. I think it got blown out of all proportion. Unfortunately, things like that do happen in real life. Babies get swapped and snatched in hospitals. I'm sure that any parent who has lost a child will find even talking about their experience very difficult, let alone watching it being acted out on television. Even my daughter got upset but she is only 9 so maybe I shouldn't have let her watch it. I just didn't realise it was going to be so heart-wrenching, which was down to the great acting." ...|$|E
