5|$|At the {{procession}} to George's lying in state in Westminster Hall {{part of the}} Imperial State Crown fell from {{on top of the}} coffin and landed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gutter</b> as the cortège turned into New Palace Yard. The new king, Edward VIII, saw it fall and wondered whether it was a bad omen for his new reign. As a mark of respect to their father, George's four surviving sons, Edward, Albert, Henry, and George, mounted the guard, known as the Vigil of the Princes, at the catafalque on the night before the funeral. The vigil was not repeated until the death of George's daughter-in-law, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, in 2002. George V was interred at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, on 28 January 1936. Edward abdicated before the year was out, leaving his brother Albert, Duke of York, to ascend the throne (taking the regnal name George VI).|$|E

25|$|La Nausée allows Sartre {{to explain}} his {{philosophy}} in simplified terms. Roquentin is the classic existentialist hero whose attempts to pierce the veil of perception lead him to a strange combination of disgust and wonder. For {{the first part of}} the novel, Roquentin has flashes of nausea that emanate from mundane objects. These flashes appear seemingly randomly, from staring at a crumpled piece of paper <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gutter</b> to picking up a rock on the beach. The feeling he perceives is pure disgust: a contempt so refined that it almost shatters his mind each time it occurs. As the novel progresses, the nausea appears more and more frequently, though he is still unsure of what it actually signifies. However, at the base of a chestnut tree in a park, he receives a piercingly clear vision of what the nausea actually is. Existence itself, the property of existence to be something rather than nothing was what was slowly driving him mad. He no longer sees objects as having qualities such as color or shape. Instead, all words are separated from the thing itself, and he is confronted with pure being.|$|E

Riley demands Silas admit to Jason and Seth that he murdered their mother and he is then arrested, however, he refuses to tell the police where Mercedes is. Silas tells Lynsey that she will have to play a game of chess in order to find Mercedes, but she refuses.

40|$|Effective roof {{drainage}} {{is necessary}} to protect buildings and their contents from rainfall damage. Regulatory documents exist {{to ensure that a}} building's roof drainage system is adequate for the anticipated rainfall events experienced during the life of the building. Empirical observations that inform international design guidelines are largely attributable to a small number of investigative studies with a limited range of roof drainage system configurations and flow conditions. This paper compares the observed hydraulic performance of a 600 mm wide, rectangular box gutter case study model under various flowrates to values predicted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Australian, US and European standards. The study measured the depth of water at various locations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> box <b>gutter</b> over a range of flowrates from 3 L/s to 20 L/s to determine whether <b>the</b> <b>gutter</b> depths recommended by the various design guidelines were adequate. Four different gutter slopes (1 : 200; 1 : 150; 1 : 100; and 1 : 40) were tested <b>in</b> <b>the</b> study. The results of the study indicated that the depth of flow <b>in</b> <b>the</b> box <b>gutter</b> was highly dependent on the inflow rate and <b>the</b> <b>gutter</b> slope. <b>The</b> results showed that <b>the</b> observed <b>gutter</b> water levels {{may or may not be}} considered adequate and safe, depending on the individual guideline applied. As regulatory documents aim to provide effective guidance, a deficit of box gutter depth is concerning while a surplus represents wasted resources.

40|$|The {{growing season}} for {{vegetable}} crops {{is limited by}} freezing temperatures in arid high elevation climates such as northern Utah. Logan, Utah (41. 73 N, 111. 83 W, 1382 m elevation) has a short, variable growing season with an average frost-free period of 135 days. Extending the growing season provides growers {{with an opportunity to}} extend revenue into a normally unproductive period and benefit from out-of-season price premiums. High tunnels have been used to effectively extend the growing season for numerous crops by providing cold temperature protection. However, limited high tunnel research has been performed in arid high elevation regions that experience extreme temperature fluctuations. The use of high tunnels was investigated in North Logan, Utah to extend the growing season for tomatoes and lettuce. In 2009 and 2010, supplemental heating under low tunnels within high tunnels was investigated to provide early season cold temperature protection for tomatoes. Sunbrite tomatoes were transplanted into four high tunnels over three planting dates. Tomatoes were subjected to supplemental heating treatments including soil warming cables alone or in conjunction with 40 -watt incandescent lights for air heating. The highest early season and overall yield was achieved with the 17 Mar. planting date. Early season yield was significantly less for the latest planting date (7 Apr.) compared to the 17 Mar. and 30 Mar. planting dates. Early season yield was significantly greater for treatment plots with soil plus air heating, and soil heating alone significantly improved total yield. The use of a vertical structure within a high tunnel was investigated to improve productivity for lettuce. Parris Island Cos lettuce was consecutively transplanted from spring 2008 to spring 2010 in a high tunnel at the same site. The vertical growing system allowed for 31 plants*m- 2 in south oriented gutters, and 45 plants*m- 2 in east/west oriented gutters compared to 25 plants*m- 2 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ground including space for maintenance. Root zone temperatures <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gutters</b> fluctuated widely <b>in</b> response to air temperatures, and super-optimal soil temperatures impeded growth. Productivity (g*m- 2) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gutters</b> was only significantly greater than productivity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ground soil during the spring and fall months when soil and air temperatures were not frequently below 0 °C or above 24 °C.
