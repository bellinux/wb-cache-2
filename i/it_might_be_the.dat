5|$|Gauri {{tried for}} several weeks to persuade Chrisye to commit to the concert, and {{following}} Chrisye's introduction to Erwin Gutawa, who was scheduled to handle the arrangements, Jay Subyakto succeeded in convincing him that <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> last chance to revive his career. Lacking the necessary funding, they approached RCTI in search of sponsorship but were refused, and laughingly told that they should try holding a concert at the National Monument. Undeterred, Chrisye, Subaktyo, and Gutawa put together a group of artists and began rehearsals. Around the time of RCTI's fourth anniversary, the television station relented and agreed to fund the concert {{as part of their}} celebrations; the thousands of tickets available sold out within a week.|$|E
5|$|In 1875, Elizabeth Johnson {{discovered}} {{the remains of}} a Pawnee village in Republic County, Kansas. She thought that <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> site of Pike's flag incident; but hearing of another village in Webster County, Nebraska, she dispatched her husband and another man to investigate this site. Because the surface had been altered by cultivation, they found little evidence of habitation, and Johnson was persuaded that the Republic County site was Pike's village. She prevented its being plowed on several occasions, and eventually purchased the land.|$|E
5|$|Refined cuisine {{could be}} moralized {{as a sign}} of either civilized {{progress}} or decadent decline. The early Imperial historian Tacitus contrasted the indulgent luxuries of the Roman table in his day with the simplicity of the Germanic diet of fresh wild meat, foraged fruit, and cheese, unadulterated by imported seasonings and elaborate sauces. Most often, because of the importance of landowning in Roman culture, produce—cereals, legumes, vegetables, and fruit—was considered a more civilized form of food than meat. The Mediterranean staples of bread, wine, and oil were sacralized by Roman Christianity, while Germanic meat consumption became a mark of paganism, as <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> product of animal sacrifice.|$|E

5|$|The {{employees}} pursue Michael, and {{he confesses}} that {{he created the}} rumors to conceal the one true rumor. Andy fears that <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> one about him. The employees urge Michael to tell them which one is true, but just as Michael is about to give in, Jim announces that Pam is actually pregnant to save Stanley. Michael denies it, but Pam shows her baby's ultrasound picture to prove it. Later, while Michael discusses her pregnancy with Jim and Pam in his office, Stanley's wife Teri returns Michael's call from earlier. He {{picks up the phone}} with the intention of making an excuse for his earlier call so as to not tip her off, but he accidentally calls her Cynthia twice before Jim hangs up the phone for him. Teri had already been suspicious of Stanley and Cynthia, so Michael calling her Cynthia is enough for her to figure out what is going on. Michael, feeling guilty, watches from his office window as Stanley attacks Michael's car with a tire iron in a fit of rage. At the end of the episode, the three interns discuss what they have learned at Dunder Mifflin, which they essentially reveal was nothing.|$|E
25|$|The {{first part}} of the name Skarstind is one of the Norwegian words for {{mountain}} pass, although it is impossible to say which pass has given its name to the mountain. <b>It</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> pass to the south or <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> pass between the summit itself and the pinnacle, Nåle. Nåle, the Needle, has got its name from the local word for pinnacle, which describes the shape of it.|$|E

Additionally, Aban is also the name of the eighth month of the year of the Zoroastrian calendar (Bundahishn 1a.23-24), {{as well as that of}} the Iranian calendar of 1925, which follows Zoroastrian month-naming conventions. <b>It</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> precursor of the holy month of Sha'aban in the Hijri calendar.|$|E
25|$|Finally, in late 1931, Szent-Györgyi gave Svirbely, {{formerly}} of King's lab, {{the last of}} his adrenal-derived hexuronic acid with the suggestion that <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> anti-scorbutic factor. By the spring of 1932, King's laboratory had proven this, but published the result without giving Szent-Györgyi credit for it, leading to a bitter dispute over priority claims (in reality it had taken a team effort by both groups, since Szent-Györgyi was unwilling to do the difficult and messy animal studies).|$|E
25|$|The film {{is notable}} for its avant-garde style, shot on stark high-contrast {{black-and-white}} film, using the spherical cinematographic process with allusions to French New Wave cinema. The striking black-and-white photography of the film's cinematographer, Stephen H. Burum, lies in two main sources: the films of Orson Welles and German cinema of the 1920s. When {{the film was}} in its pre-production phase, Coppola asked Burum how he wanted to film it and they agreed that <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> only chance they were ever {{going to have to}} make a black-and-white film.|$|E

25|$|Rape! 13th Hour was {{released}} theatrically in Japan on January 22, 1977. The film {{had not been}} released on video {{at the time of}} Yasuharu Hasebe's 1999 interview with Asian Cult Cinema. The director stated that <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> film's controversial nature which caused the studio to hold back its release. Once released on videotape, it became a popular item. It {{was released}} on DVD in Japan on September 21, 2007, as part of Geneon's ninth wave of Nikkatsu Roman porno series. This release employed a new master struck from the original negative, with scratches and flaws corrected. Extras included the original theatrical trailer and a four-page booklet. English subtitles were not included on this release.|$|E
25|$|As a girl, {{her last}} {{idea was to}} spend her life in India, even though <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> Scudder family tradition. As a child in India, she saw all too much famine, poverty and disease. After a Massachusetts seminary, Ida {{expected}} {{to get married and}} settle down in the U.S., but, in her early 20s, Ida Scudder went back to India to help her ailing mother at her mission bungalow at Tindivanam. Ida Scudder took her M.D. at Cornell University in 1899, then headed back to India, fortified with a $10,000 gift from a Manhattan banker. With the money, she started a tiny clinic for women at Vellore, 75 miles from Madras. In two years she treated 5,000 patients.|$|E
25|$|Many {{major events}} have {{occurred}} at Our Chalet and in Adelboden, {{such as the}} Quo Vadis Council of 1933 for national and international Guiding leaders, World Committee conferences, and International Training seminars. In 1934, the first International Brownie Training, for training leaders of young girls, {{was held at the}} Chalet and the eighth World Conference, for Guiding leaders, took place at the Hotel Regina in Adelboden. The first Round Table of Trainers, for training people who do training, was held at Our Chalet in 1935. In the late 1930s, an International Ranger Conference—for Guides involved in high adventure programs, a Round Table for Ranger Captains—for Ranger leaders, a Round Table for Brown Owls—for leaders of the young girls' Brownie program, and more Quo Vadis Councils were held. In 1938 the tenth World Conference was held in Adelboden. By the time the second Round Table of Trainers was held in the spring of 1939, people knew <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> last major international event for a while as the storm clouds of war were gathering. In August 1986, the first Helen Storrow Seminar was held. Each Helen Storrow Seminar focuses on a different theme, such as the rights and responsibilities of women or how women can fight HIV and AIDS.|$|E

500|$|For the {{remainder}} of the convention, delegates continued to try to conciliate the Clay supporters. A number of speeches were made in tribute to the Kentucky senator, and attendees roared with approval when a pre-written letter from Clay was read, expressing support for the nominee, whoever <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be.</b> <b>The</b> magnanimous tone of the letter contrasted with Clay's reaction when on December 8, the day after the convention closed, he became the first Whig presidential hopeful to learn the outcome: [...] "My [...] friends are not worth the powder and shot it would take to kill them." ...|$|E
