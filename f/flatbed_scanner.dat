40|$|A {{very simple}} method of making {{stereoscopic}} image pairs from small objects {{by means of}} <b>flatbed</b> <b>scanners</b> has been recently developed. Due to the non-parallel optics of modern <b>flatbed</b> <b>scanners</b> using CCD-elements, objects can be scanned with slightly different viewing angles by simply putting them on different lateral positions on the glass surface. As {{a consequence of the}} high resolution and the good optical properties of modern <b>flatbed</b> <b>scanners,</b> this method is particularly well suited for applications in quality control. After {{a brief description of the}} principle, a new low cost stereo / 3 D scanner based on this principle is presented. 1. THE PRINCIPLE OF STEREOSCOPIC SCANNING Due to their great depth of focus, which is in the order of a few centimeters, modern <b>flatbed</b> <b>scanners</b> can be used not only for scanning printed paper, but also for scanning three-dimensional objects. Since they use CCD-elements as light sensitive elements, which are much smaller than the glass surface, special o [...] ...|$|R
50|$|Flatbed {{scanners}} {{have been}} used as digital backs for large-format cameras to create high-resolution digital images of static subjects. A modified <b>flatbed</b> <b>scanner</b> has been used for documentation and quantification of thin layer chromatograms detected by fluorescence quenching on silica gel layers containing an ultraviolet (UV) indicator. 'ChromImage' is allegedly the first commercial <b>flatbed</b> <b>scanner</b> densitometer. It enables acquisition of TLC plate images and quantification of chromatograms by use of Galaxie-TLC software. Other than being turned into densitometers, flatbed scanners were also turned into colorimeters using different methods. Trichromatic Color Analyser is allegedly the first distributable system using a <b>flatbed</b> <b>scanner</b> as a tristimulus colorimetric device.|$|E

50|$|An {{alternative}} {{approach is to}} take a high-resolution photograph or scan of each side of the record and interpret the image of the grooves using computer software.

50|$|The high {{resolution}} of consumer level <b>flatbed</b> <b>scanners</b> allows taking stereoscopic images {{of objects that}} would otherwise be possible only through a stereo microscope, with similar limitations involving depth of field. The scanner, of course, does not feature adjustable focus, so the sharpest focus will always be closest to the glass.|$|R

50|$|Scanners differ {{significantly}} from digital camera in many areas. First, the optical resolution of a <b>flatbed</b> <b>scanner</b> can exceed 5000 pixels per inch (200 pixels per mm).

"A <b>flatbed</b> <b>scanner</b> {{is usually}} {{composed}} of a glass pane (or platen), under {{which there is a}} bright light (often xenon, LED or cold cathode fluorescent) which illuminates the pane, and a moving optical array in CCD scanning.

50|$|Contact image sensors (CIS) are image sensors used in <b>flatbed</b> <b>scanners</b> {{almost in}} {{direct contact with}} the object to be scanned. Charge-coupled devices (CCDs), often used for this application, use mirrors to bounce light to a {{stationary}} sensor. CISs are much smaller than CCDs, use typically a tenth as much power, and are particularly suitable for low power and portable applications, often powered over USB.|$|R
50|$|<b>Flatbed</b> <b>scanners</b> {{typically}} have a hinged cover {{that covers the}} bed, and reflects light back into the scan head. This cover is usually removed or propped open when scanning 3-D objects, to prevent damage or compression of the subject. Removal of the cover also allows the artist to use additional light sources positioned above the bed, {{which can be used}} to enhance the depth captured by the scanner.|$|R
50|$|Typical consumer-level <b>flatbed</b> <b>scanners</b> {{are capable}} of optical {{resolution}} ranging from 100 to 2400 SPI; high-end scanners may have an optical resolution of 4800 SPI or more. Many scanners use interpolation techniques to achieve a higher effective SPI rating, with some manufacturers offering nearly one million SPI, though the quality is primarily limited by the optical resolution; interpolated SPI does not provide additional pixels in the scanned image.|$|R

50|$|A {{barcode reader}} (or barcode scanner) is an {{electronic}} device that can read and output printed barcodes to a computer. Like a <b>flatbed</b> <b>scanner,</b> {{it consists of}} a light source, a lens and a light sensor translating optical impulses into electrical ones. Additionally, nearly all barcode readers contain decoder circuitry analyzing the barcode's image data provided by the sensor and sending the barcode's content to the scanner's output port.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Compressed sensing (CS) is an {{innovative}} technique allowing to represent signals {{through a small}} number of their linear projections. In this paper we address the application of CS to the scenario of progressive acquisition of 2 D visual signals in a line-by-line fashion. This is an important setting which encompasses diverse systems such as <b>flatbed</b> <b>scanners</b> and remote sensing imagers. The use of CS in such setting raises the problem of reconstructing a very high number of samples, as are contained in an image, from their linear projections. Conventional reconstruction algorithms, whose complexity is cubic in the number of samples, are computationally intractable. In this paper we develop an iterative reconstruction algorithm that reconstructs an image by iteratively estimating a row, and correlating adjacent rows by means of linear prediction. We develop suitable predictors and test the proposed algorithm in the context of <b>flatbed</b> <b>scanners</b> and remote sensing imaging systems. We show that this approach can significantly improve the results of separate reconstruction of each row, providing very good reconstruction quality with reasonable complexity...|$|R
5000|$|Drum {{scanners}} capture image {{information with}} photomultiplier tubes (PMT), {{rather than the}} charge-coupled device (CCD) arrays found in <b>flatbed</b> <b>scanners</b> and inexpensive film scanners. [...] "Reflective and transmissive originals are mounted on an acrylic cylinder, the scanner drum, which rotates at high speed while it passes the object being scanned in front of precision optics that deliver image information to the PMTs. Modern color drum scanners use three matched PMTs, which read red, blue, and green light, respectively. Light from the original artwork is split into separate red, blue, and green beams in the optical bench of the scanner with dichroic filters." [...] Photomultipliers offer superior dynamic range {{and for this reason}} drum scanners can extract more detail from very dark shadow areas of a transparency than <b>flatbed</b> <b>scanners</b> using CCD sensors. The smaller dynamic range of the CCD sensors, versus photomultiplier tubes, can lead to loss of shadow detail, especially when scanning very dense transparency film. While mechanics vary by manufacturer, most drum scanners pass light from halogen lamps though a focusing system to illuminate both reflective and transmissive originals.|$|R

50|$|Horizontal and {{vertical}} SPI ratings may differ {{for a given}} scanner; typical <b>flatbed</b> <b>scanners</b> use a horizontal array of sensors that are passed across the bed using an electric stepper motor. The density of the array of sensors determines the horizontal scanning resolution, while the minimum step size of the motor determines the vertical resolution. Similar characteristics are present in drum scanners, which continuously spin the item being scanned past the sensor array for numerous imaging passes.|$|R
