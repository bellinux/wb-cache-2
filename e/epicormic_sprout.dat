Seven separate stands were used with as many as six treatments per stand in coastal Humboldt County, California, USA. • <b>Epicormic</b> <b>sprout</b> development was affected by pruning severity but primarily at the most severe pruning treatments that removed all but the branches in the top 15 % of tree height. Less severe treatments produced sprouts but the number and size of these sprouts were comparable to unpruned trees. • Natural clonal patterns were also used to explore patterns of sprouting between genotypes. Linear mixed-effects models were developed to predict sprouting frequency as a function of pruning severity while accounting for the nested data structure (i. e., stem sections sampled nested within genotypes within treatments within sites). • Comparing variances attributed to each of these random effects indicated that at any level of pruning severity, differences in epicormic sprouting between genotypes and sites expressed soon after pruning had disappeared after six growing seasons. Epicormic branches were more common two years after pruning than six years indicating many branches were dying.

Six to nine years after treatment sprouts were very common with 232 of 236 trees producing sprouts and an average of 9 - 11 sprouts m- 1 of tree bole. The total numbers of sprouts were similar for the different pruning treatments but significantly more large sprouts (P = 0. 025) were produced in the 5. 2 m pruning lift.

40|$|ABSTRACTGuaricica (Vochysia bifalcata) is {{a native}} species of the coastal region of Paraná, Santa Catarina, SãoPaulo, Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais states, with great {{ecological}} importance due its ability to regenerate degraded areas. However, little information exists about its ability to sexual or asexual propagation. One ofthe causes of cuttings low rooting is the maturation of collected tissues. Thus, this study aimed to evaluatedifferent <b>epicormic</b> <b>sprout</b> sources (from stump and from bend of stem) {{and the application of}} indolebutyricacid (IBA) in rooting cuttings ofVochysia bifalcata. Two types of cuttings were used (of stump and of bendof stem) and were treated with two concentrations of IBA (0 and 1000 mg L- 1), and later, the cuttings werekept in a greenhouse for 60 days. Anatomical analysis of the base on each type of cuttings demonstrated thatthe presence of fibers in the cortical region of the stem cuttings of stump did not constitute an anatomicalbarrier to issue adventitious roots, because they had higher rooting capacity (81 %), a higher number ofroots per cuttings (8, 0) and increased root length (2, 0 cm) compared to those of bend of stem, that showedpoorer results as lower rooting percentage (31 %), lower number of roots per cutting (3, 3) and lower rootlength (0, 7 cm).

40|$|Property {{management}} {{is an important}} aspect in sustaining the Earth’s ecosystems. Anthropogenic changes to the planet have made conservation important in maintaining species abundance and diversity as well as limit damages to sensitive ecosystems. Invasive species have become a standard, consistent problem in managed ecosystems. Such species often invade into disturbed areas, which commonly {{are a result of}} restoration or other management activities. In dredging open water bodies at Eagle Marsh Nature Preserve (Allen County, IN), artificial mounds were constructed with the soil removed. This movement of soil created a disturbance which facilitated for the recruitment and colonization of invasive species. The {{purpose of this study was}} to quantify the effectiveness of transferring a native seed bank in a mesic prairie to the artificial mounds as a method of controlling invasive species. The native seed bank in the mesic prairie would be lost due to additional management. This study was conducted with greenhouse and field experimentation. Soil samples containing the seed bank were moved to a greenhouse to quantify plant emergence following different intact and mixed soil treatments. All emerging plant species were identified and counted. All treatment methods contained a high diversity of native species and a low diversity of invasive species with the exception of the seed bank soil mixed with soil from the mounds. The mound mixed soil contained a higher diversity of invasive species than other treatments. A plant survey of the mounds was conducted in July 2014. In October 2014, 960 m 2 of soil was transferred from the donor site to the mounds. A post-move survey conducted in July 2015 indicated the native species diversity increased while the diversity of invasive species decreased. Soil transfer as a management strategy was appropriate in this situation where a large native seed bank in a donor region existed. By moving soil from one location to another, we were able to promote native plant establishment and reduce invasive species emergence. While soil transfer is effective, other management strategies may not have the same results. Callery pear (Pyrus calleryana) is an invasive tree introduced to North America as an ornamental from southwest Asia. It easily invades disturbed areas, causing a disruption to mid- to late-successional species establishment. The purpose of this study was to assess Callery pear demographics in a managed prairie and quantify the effects of a prescribed fire management strategy on Callery pear density and recruitment. This study was conducted at Arrowhead Prairie (Allen County, IN), managed by Little River Wetlands Project (LRWP). Before 2009, Arrowhead Prairie was primarily used for agriculture. Following LRWP acquisition, the property has undergone active management including native plant seeding and prescribed fire. The prairie was divided into a north and south section using a historic ditch, with the south section burned in April 2014 and the north section burned in May 2015. Bare seeds, fruit, first-year seedlings, and second-year seedlings were also burned in a separate controlled experiment. Fire in both years top killed Callery pear individuals, with 100 % of surveyed trees producing epicormic shoots and 83 % producing more than one <b>epicormic</b> <b>sprout.</b> First-year seedlings exposed to the fire had a 3 % resprout rate while all seconds-year seedlings resprouted. In contrast, 13 % of individuals at Arrowhead Prairie had epicormic shoots without fire. Trees were significantly shorter post-burn than prior to the burn; however, root collar diameter was not different, suggesting that resources were used in primary growth. While fire did reduce stem height, it did increase the number of stems occurring within the burned section due to epicormic sprouting. Root stored reserves provided necessary energy to produce numerous sprouts by the majority of pear trees, although no trees produced flowers during the duration of the study. Plant age likely plays an important role in response to fire, with seeds and fruits succumbing. However, older seedlings may survive with increased epicormic shoot production. Multiple techniques combined with relevant studies allows for land managers to make appropriate decisions in terms of management. Although many of these techniques are not universal, a wide range of researched techniques provides multiple avenues of approach when managing a parcel of land. ...|$|E

Initial {{reports of the}} infestation of white fringetree by emerald ash borer occurred in southwestern Ohio and Chicago, IL. We examined white fringetrees at additional sites in Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, and Pennsylvania in Summer and Fall 2015 and Winter 2016 for emerald ash borer infestation. Our aim was to examine white fringetrees at {{a limited number of}} sites with emerald ash borer infestation and to relate tree size, crown dieback, <b>epicormic</b> <b>sprouting,</b> tree sex, and adjacency to ash or white fringetrees with the likelihood of beetle infestation. A higher proportion of infested trees exhibited <b>epicormic</b> <b>sprouting</b> and the likelihood that a tree was infested increased with increasing crown dieback, variables that may be both predictors and responses to attack. The proportion of trees infested with emerald ash borer increased with increasing tree size. Signs consistent with emerald ash borer infestation were found in 26 % of 178 white fringetrees, with at least one host infested at each site in all states. Infestation rates of white fringetrees increased with the density of white fringetrees at each site. The Chicago Botanic Garden site had a significantly lower infestation (3. 7 %) than other sites, which may be due to proactive management of ash. Overall, these data indicate white fringetree has been utilized by emerald ash borer throughout their overlapping ranges in the United States in ornamental settings likely due to ecological fitting...|$|R

30|$|As forests burn, the {{physiological}} responses of trees to stress or injury {{result from a}} combination of simultaneous processes, and fire behavior can vary from tree to tree. More frequent and robust indicators of the 1985 event suggest that fire severity and intensity affect tree responses. Post-fire measurements of char height, crown scorch, tree mortality, basal sprouting, and fire severity (e.g., Ramage et al. 2010, Lazzeri-Aerts and Russell 2014) coupled with increment cores collected several years later from standing redwoods could link growth and anatomical indicators to specific drivers. Although tree size may influence responsiveness to fire due to bark thickness (Sillett et al. 2015), <b>epicormic</b> <b>sprouting</b> (Abbott 1987), and ability to survive fire (Ramage et al. 2010, Douglas and Bendure 2012), no size-related trend in fire indicators is evident in this study of trees 93 cm f-DBH to 481 cm f-DBH. While individuals show varying degrees of radial growth and wood anatomy effects following the MW and LH events, sampling trees regardless of external signs of fire reliably capture tree-ring indicators when viewed in aggregate.|$|R
50|$|Research has {{indicated}} that each rehabilitation project should be different depending on each region's specific environmental status.

Fujioka et al. did a research study, which showed that mangrove communities could recover quickly after tsunami impacts but have a more difficult time recovering in highly disturbed areas where sand has accumulated and the composition of the sediments has greatly altered.

30|$|Tree rings {{provide useful}} {{information}} about fire in Sequoia sempervirens (D. Don) Endl. (hereafter, redwood) forests. Remnant charcoal on trunks is visual evidence of fire (Sawyer et al. 2000), and ring counts of fire scars on redwood stumps extend over 1200 years (Fritz 1931). Fire is ecologically important and redwood has fire-adapted traits (e.g., thick bark, basal and <b>epicormic</b> <b>sprouting),</b> but the {{temporal and spatial}} variability of this disturbance across the redwood region is complex. Published fire histories for these forests indicate {{a wide range of}} fire-return intervals, from > 100 yr to < 10 yr within sub-regions, with several factors influencing this high variability (Lorimer et al. 2009). The north-south and coastal-interior climate gradients (Jacobs et al. 1985, Stuart and Stephens 2006) shape regional-scale differences, while localized topography and fuels can contribute to landscape-level variability (e.g., Heyerdahl et al. 2001). Human disturbances also impact fire regimes in the redwood region and include Native American burning, Euro-American ranching and logging, and fire exclusion (Greenlee and Langheim 1990, Brown and Baxter 2003, Anderson 2005, Stuart and Stephens 2006). Fire histories for redwood forests are less articulated than many other forests in the western United States {{due in large part to}} difficulty crossdating redwoods’ annual rings (Fritz 1940).|$|R
50|$|The girth {{measurement}} {{is commonly}} taken by wrapping a Measuring tape (tape) around, {{and in the}} plane perpendicular to the axis of, the trunk, at the correct height. In spite of the apparent simplicity of wrapping a tape around a tree trunk at breast height, errors in this measurement are common. The most common error is mixing measurements of single trunk trees with those of multi-trunk trees and not distinguishing between the two. Even with single trunk trees irregular bumps and hollows are common. Some trees have low branches that split below breast height. Other trees have <b>epicormic</b> <b>sprouts,</b> suckers, or dead branches. Some tree trunks stand slanted at an angle rather than vertical. Girths of trees with these features may be measured by competing methods by different surveyors and result in differences.The basic guidelines {{for dealing with the}} above difficulties were developed by American Forests, and most of the guideline used by other tree measuring groups around the world are based upon American Forests guidelines. The Native Tree Society measurement guidelines also generally follow the American Forests prescription, with some additional elaborations.Many trees have burls bumps, and knots along their trunk. If these occur at the 4.5 feet girth measurement height, including them in the measurement would falsely inflate the girth measurement. The girth measurement should then be taken at the narrowest point below the odd growth and the height of the girth measurement noted. In some cases a girth taken just above the odd growth will be more representative of the actual girth of the tree. In these cases the measurement should be taken there and the height above the base of the tree noted.Some trees have branches at or lower than a height of 4.5 ft. Since the purpose of a girth measurement is to get a full measure of the tree’s trunk, measurements should be taken at the narrowest point below any significant branching. When taking a girth measurement at a non-standard height the height of that measurement above the base of the tree should be noted. <b>Epicormic</b> <b>sprouts,</b> suckers, and dead branches can be ignored. Some guidelines have suggested that if a tree branches below breast height, that the girth of the largest branch should be measured at breast height ignoring the other branches. However, if {{a good portion of the}} trunk volume or cross-sectional area has been split from the total by measuring above a significant branching, then this is not giving a full and fair measure of the trunk's girth. If the pith of the branch does not intersect the pith of the main trunk above ground level, it is not a branch but a separate trunk and this tree should be considered a multi-trunk tree.|$|R
30|$|A {{variety of}} species {{interface}} with coast redwood within the coastal mixed evergreen forest mosaic in the Santa Cruz Mountains, located in coastal central California, USA. Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii [Mirb.] Franco) {{is a common}} co-dominant and exhibits similar fire resistant properties as coast redwood, including thick insulating bark and high crown (Hermann and Lavender 1990). However, Douglas-fir has no ability for basal or <b>epicormic</b> <b>sprouting,</b> so that complete loss of foliage for an individual results in mortality without exception. The {{same is true for}} ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Lawson & C. Lawson) and knobcone pine (Pinus attenuata Lemmon). However, both pine species seed prolifically following fire, particularly knobcone pine—a true fire-dependent species with serotinous cones (Lanner 1999, Barbour 2007). Several hardwood species are associated with coast redwood forests in the southern range, including Pacific madrone (Arbutus menziesii Pursh); a variety of oak species, including California live oak (Quercus agrifolia Née), canyon live oak (Q. chrysolepis Liebm.), and interior live oak (Q. wislizeni A. DC.); tanoak (Notholithocarpus densiflorus Hook.); and California bay (Umbellularia californica [Hook & Arn.] Nutt.). These species present little above-ground fire resistance with relatively thin bark, but exhibit substantial post-fire sprouting ability. Other than coast redwood, California nutmeg (Torreya californica Torr.) is the only other sprouting conifer associated with the southern range of coast redwood forests. California nutmeg is a minor component of the forest mix, however, and has only modest sprouting ability.|$|R

Lichen thalli were identified and recorded in the field within each sampling interval. Voucher specimens for each species identified on a plot were collected. Vouchers were later examined in the lab using compound and dissecting microscopes, chemical spot test, and thin layer chromatography when appropriate. All vouchers were deposited in the New York Botanical Garden, Bronx, New York, USA. In addition to abundance (counts for a given species within a sampling height), cover was also visually estimated in the field for each lichen taxon recorded. Cover was placed into five groups as follows: 1 (1 % to 5 %), 2 (6 % to 25 %), 3 (26 % to 50 %), 4 (51 % to 75 %), and 5 (76 % to 100 %). An estimate of total lichen cover for each sampling interval was also made independent of those for the individual taxa. For the purposes of assessing growth form and reproductive mode, a table of all species found during the study was produced and these characters were scored for all taxa using existing references and standard literature.

40|$|Background/Question/Methods Emerald ash borer is an {{invasive}} Asian pest of ash {{species in}} North America. I recently discovered that emerald ash borer {{was capable of}} using white fringetree (Chionanthus virginicus L. (Oleaceae), a native North American species, as a larval host in the field. The {{full extent of the}} susceptibility of this species to EAB remains to be determined, as is the susceptibility of close relatives that are exposed to this beetle. Studies have revealed that Asian ashes, such as Manchurian ash, are more resistant to attack than are North American ashes. Like Manchurian ash, Chinese fringetree (Chionanthus retusus) has a native distribution that overlaps with EAB in Asia and it may prove to be more resistant to EAB than white fringetree due to its shared evolutionary history and possession of effective defense mechanisms. The degree of susceptibility of Chinese fringetrees to EAB attack relative to white fringetree has never been studied, nor has the comparative susceptibility of either host to other wood borers. I examined ornamental white and Chinese fringetrees planted in Spring Grove Cemetery and Arboretum in Cincinnati, Ohio for evidence of attack by EAB and lilac borer, a native wood borer. I also examined the performance of EAB larvae on these and related hosts in the laboratory. Results/Conclusions Nine of the 28 white fringetrees examined possessed one or more exit holes characteristic of EAB and also had feeding galleries characteristic of EAB larvae when examined further. Most of the trees were showing some branch dieback and <b>epicormic</b> <b>sprouting</b> as a result of borer attacks. Attacked trees were distributed fairly randomly across the cemetery and had significantly larger basal stem diameters than unattacked trees. Nineteen of 28 white fringetrees exhibited evidence of lilac borer attack, and attacked trees were again larger on average than unattacked trees. Eight of nine white fringetrees with EAB attack also had lilac borer attack. None of the 11 Chinese fringetrees examined showed evidence of attack by either EAB or lilac borer. In the laboratory, EAB larvae penetrated all species initially, but their survival and performance was significantly greater in white than in Chinese fringetree. White fringetree is proving to be an acceptable host to EAB across a wide geographic range in the field, but coevolved species, like Chinese fringetree appear to be resistant.

It was observed that branches pruned at 20 - 50 cm long produced more sprouts. Cuttings 50 cm long under shade registered more sprouts than those placed in the greenhouse. Stumps produced 60 % sprouts 5 - 37 cm long, varying from 7 - 59 single sprouts per stump. One year later, 50 % of top-pruned trees produced enough sprouts (> 5 cm long) to be harvested. It is concluded that branches pruned at 20 to 50 cm long, and basal stumps, were the most efficient sprout producers, especially with orthotropic growth. Meanwhile, long cuttings were not efficient due to high mortality and low sprout induction.

The aims of this thesis were to explore the ecological role of sprouting in selected South African biomes. In particular, to explore the biogeographic, community and individual level consequences of adopting sprouting as a life history strategy. The thesis is broadly divided into 4 sections. The first three dealing with the ecology of sprouting in forests, fynbos and savannas respectively; and the fourth undertakes to determine whether sprouting is considered in plant ecological strategy schemes. Chapter 1 and 2 deals {{with the role of}} sprouting in forests in relation to reseeding as key regeneration strategies in southern Cape forests. Sprouting has been largely been ignored as a regeneration strategy in favour of reseeding in southern African forests. I found that tall forests are dominated by reseeding species, while sprouting species dominate shorter canopied forests. The relative dominance of sprouters has an effect on forest canopy species richness: as sprouter abundance increases, with decreasing canopy height, canopy species richness decreases. Sprouters are able to retain their in situ position in the forests {{for longer periods of time}} than do reseeders, which reduces individual and species turnover, and hence canopy species richness. In Chapter 3 and 4, I explore Proteaceae Life History strategies in relation to fire. Sprouting ability and bark thickness are used as key traits in defining Proteaceae life history strategies. Five functional groups are described and are broadly divided into two categories resisters and non-resisters. Resisters include thick barked fire resisting and <b>epicormic</b> <b>sprouting</b> species and non-resisters basal sprouting and thin barked non-resistant species. Sprouting strategy and bark thickness were also found to influence plant architecture and hence individual and stand flammability. Non-resisting species tend to display a more ramified architecture, resulting in a more flammable state. Conversely, thick barked species tend to display a less ramified and therefore more fire resistance architecture. In Chapter 5 I explore how changes in disturbance regime affect Acacia life history strategies in Hluhluwe-Umfolozi Park, KwaZulu Natal, South Africa. Four functional groups are defined based on sprouting ability, bark thickness, seed mass, plant height and wood density. The functional groups are seen to reflect local disturbance regimes: Acacia species found in mesic, frequently burnt portions of the park sprout strongly as adults and/or are fire resistant, but are poorly defended against herbivory. Conversely, species found in more xeric portions, where fire frequency is lower, and herbivore densities higher, are fire-sensitive, well defended against herbivory and sprout weakly as adults. Chapter 6 addresses whether plant ecological strategy schemes take sprouting into account as a key life history strategy. Westoby's LHS scheme, which comprises specific leaf area (SLA), plant height and seed mass, is of the more practicable existing plant ecological strategy schemes. I show that the LHS scheme does not consistently identify sprouting across genera or families. In general, basal sprouters tended to be shorter than congeneric reseeders, but there were no consistent patterns for SLA or seed mass. The results suggest that sprouting ability is mostly orthogonal to other life history traits and should be therefore considered as a separate attribute.

40|$|Dormant {{axillary}} buds allow {{plants to}} repair minor damage to their canopies. In woody plants, these buds subsequently develop into epicormic structures that may allow vegetative recovery after major disturbances. They are an essential but little‐studied {{part of the}} persistence niche. We wondered what bud reserves {{were present in the}} leaf axils of northern Australian myrtaceous species, what levels of protection they have, and how this relates to the ecology of these species. Axillary buds of 21 species from 10 genera of northern Australian Myrtaceae were examined anatomically. All species possessed axillary buds in all axils examined, and accessory buds were recorded in 86 % of species. The species exhibited an extremely wide range of variation—from axillary buds that consisted of only an apical dome with no leaf primordia (Calytrix exstipulata) to axils with a complex array of accessory buds and meristems located beneath the axil surface (Corymbia and Eucalyptus). The axils of the Eucalyptus and Corymbia species had a greater number of and better protected axillary buds and meristems than the other species studied, including some of their closest relatives, Arillastrum, Allosyncarpia, and Stockwellia. All investigated species had an excellent meristem reserve for recovery of photosynthetic capacity after minor canopy damage and for developing <b>epicormic</b> structures for <b>sprouting</b> after more severe damage. The complex and well‐protected axillary bud or meristem structures of Corymbia and Eucalyptus may be {{an important component of the}} success of these genera in Australia...|$|R
5|$|Persoonia levis grows as a tall shrub {{to small}} tree, and can reach 5m (16ft) in height. The flaky soft bark is dark grey on the surface, while deeper layers are reddish in colour. Within the bark are <b>epicormic</b> buds, which <b>sprout</b> new growth after bushfire. The new growth is smooth to {{slightly}} hairy. The large green leaves measure 6 to 14cm (2.2–5.5in) in length, and 1.3 to 8cm (0.5–3.2in) in width, and are oblong or sickle-shaped (falcate). The asymmetrical shape helps distinguish the species from P.lanceolata. The bright green foliage, particularly of new growth, stands {{out against the}} more subdued tones of the surrounding vegetation and the stems, which are reddish in colour. The yellow flowers appear in summer and autumn (December to April), and peak over December to February. They are arranged on short axillary racemes along the branchlets. Each individual flower consists of a cylindrical perianth, consisting of tepals fused {{for most of their}} length, within which are both male and female parts. The central style is surrounded by the anther, which splits into four segments; these curl back and resemble a cross when viewed from above. They provide a landing area for insects attending to the stigma, which is located {{at the tip of the}} style. The smooth fleshy fruit, known as a drupe, is green and more or less round, measuring 1cm (0.4in) by 0.8cm (0.3in) in diameter. It contains two seeds, and has a spike at the end. The drupe is juicy but stringy when unripe, and the seeds and skin are inedible.|$|R
40|$|Background and Aims There is {{increasing}} evidence that suppressed bud burst and thus <b>epicormic</b> shoot emergence (<b>sprouting)</b> {{are controlled by}} water-carbohydrate supplies to entire trees and buds. This direct evidence is still lacking for oak. In other respects, recent studies focused on sessile oak, Quercus petraea, have confirmed the important constraints of <b>sprouting</b> by <b>epicormic</b> ontogeny. The main objective {{of this paper was}} thus to provide provisional confirmation of the water-carbohydrate control and direct evidence of the ontogenic constraints by bringing together results already published in separate studies on water status and distribution of carbohydrates, and on accompanying vegetation and epicormics, which also quantify epicormic ontogeny. Methods This paper analyses results gained from a sessile oak experiment in which part of the site was free from fairly tall, dense accompanying vegetation. This experiment was initially focused on stand water status and more recently on the carbohydrate distribution of dominant trees. External observations of the epicormic composition and internal observations with X-ray computer tomography were undertaken on 60 and six trees, respectively. Key Results Sprouting was more intense in the part of the stand free from accompanying vegetation and on upper trunk segments. A clear effect of epicormic ontogeny was demonstrated as well: the more epicormics a trunk segment bears, the more chances it had to bear sprouts. Conclusions These results indirectly infer water-carbohydrate control and show direct evidence of constraints by epicormic ontogeny. These results have far-reaching consequences related to the quantification of all functions fulfilled by any type of epicormic structure in any part of the tree...|$|R

30|$|Sudden {{changes in}} ring width in {{response}} to fire are well documented in the literature (Py et al. 2006, Lombardo et al. 2009, Swetnam et al. 2009, Margolis et al. 2011). A growth release (ring-width increase) {{may be attributed to}} reduced competition from damaged or killed neighboring trees that temporarily increased a tree’s resource availability (Hartesveldt 1964, Lombardo et al. 2009). Giant sequoia, the closest relative of redwood, has a comparatively well known fire history, including many instances of growth release after fire (Swetnam et al. 1991, Brown et al. 1992, Swetnam 1993). Fire severity mediates growth response, and some low-severity fires do not reduce competition or increase soil nutrients enough to promote radial growth, while high-severity fires can cause major foliage damage and delay growth increases (Mutch and Swetnam 1995). Fuel accumulation due to fire suppression can influence growth responses, but large post-fire releases exist in pre-Euro-settlement tree-rings for giant sequoia (Caprio et al. 1994, Mutch 1994) and redwood (Brown and Swetnam 1994). The most common growth response to fire that has been observed in about a dozen fire-scarred redwood stumps near Redwood National Park in northern California, USA (41 ° 24 ′N, 123 ° 59 ′W), is an abrupt growth increase ranging from two years to several decades (Brown and Swetnam 1994). Conversely, some redwoods produce narrow or micro rings one to two years after a fire, with this ring-width variation being unrelated to climate (Brown and Swetnam 1994, Carroll et al. 2014). Loss of leaf area due to foliage scorch, heat-induced cambial damage, or heavy investment in reiteration (i.e., <b>epicormic</b> branching, basal <b>sprouting)</b> and roots following fire may cause such growth suppression (Brown 1991, 2013; Swezy and Agee 1991; Brown and Swetnam 1994; Seifert et al. 2017).|$|R
40|$|Background and Aims European beech epicormics have {{received}} {{far less attention}} than epicormics of other species, especially sessile oak. However, previous work on beech has demonstrated {{that there is a}} negative effect of radial growth on trunk sprouting, while more recent investigations on sessile oak proved a strong positive influence of the presence of epicormics. The aims of this study were, first, to make a general quantification of the epicormics present along beech stems and, secondly, to test the effects of both radial growth and <b>epicormic</b> frequency on <b>sprouting.</b> Methods In order to test the effect of radial growth, ten forked individuals were sampled, with a dominant and a dominated fork of almost equal length for every individual. To test the effects of primary growth and epicormic frequency, on the last 17 annual shoots of each fork arm, the number of axillary buds, shoot length, ring width profiles, epicormic shoots and other epicormics were carefully recorded. Key Results The distribution of annual shoot length, radial growth profiles and parallel frequencies of all epicormics are presented. The latter frequencies were parallel to the annual shoot lengths, nearly equivalent for both arms of each tree, and radial growth profiles included very narrow rings in the lowest annual shoots and even missing rings in the dominated arms alone. The location of the latent buds and the epicormics was mainly at branch base, while epicormic shoots, bud clusters and spheroblasts were present mainly in the lowest annual shoots investigated. Using a zero-inflated mixed model, sprouting was shown to depend positively on epicormic frequency and negatively on radial growth. Conclusions Support for a trade-off between cambial activity and sprouting is put forward. Sprouting mainly depends on the frequency of epicormics. Between- and within-tree variability of the epicormic composition in a given species may thus have fundamental and applied implications. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
