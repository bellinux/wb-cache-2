40|$|Surface {{pressure}} measurements demonstrate that, {{over a wide}} range of pH, amiodarone forms a stable monolayer at the air-water interface. The area found to be occupied by an amiodarone molecule was compared with a theoretical prediction based on a conformational analysis, making it possible to assemble amphiphilic molecules. The <b>intrinsic</b> <b>ionization</b> constant of amiodarone in an aqueous environment pKi = 8. 7 +/- 0. 5 was evaluated from surface potential measurements. Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.

The degree of ionization of phenolic groups {{has also been}} determined spectrophometrically. From these data, <b>intrinsic</b> <b>ionization</b> constants (pK i) of all acidic and basic groups in the corticotropins, as well as values for the electrostatic parameter (w), have been estimated. The relationship of the amino acid sequence in the corticotropin molecule to the estimated values for pK i and w is discussed. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|<b>Intrinsic</b> <b>ionization</b> and {{complexation}} constants at an alumina/electrolyte interface {{were studied}} by the site binding model, while the sorption of alkali cations from aqueous solutions was {{interpreted by the}} triple-layer model. The surface properties of alumina were investigated by the potentiometric acid-base titration method. The point of zero charge (pHpzc) of alumina obtained by this method {{was found to be}} 7. 2. The obtained mean values of the intrinsic protonation and ionization constants of the surface hydroxyl groups and the intrinsic surface complexation constant, in different electrolytes, are pKinta 1 = 4. 4, pKinta 2 = 9. 6 and pKintM+ = 9. 5, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{concentration}} of nitrogen and phosphorous in SiC bulk material and epitaxial layers was investigated using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS). The advantage of TOF-SIMS of acquiring a complete mass spectrum {{in a single}} run was used to identify the most sensitive atomic ion or ionic cluster for the selected element to be monitored. For the investigation of N with its <b>intrinsic</b> low <b>ionization</b> yield {{the use of a}} Cs containing cluster ion is necessary. Selection of a CNCs 2 + cluster allows to reach a detection limit of about cN,min ≈ 5 ⋅ 1016 cm- 3. In the case of P the elemental ion was used. However, the adjacent mass of 30 SiH influences the P peak as well as its background and has to be suppressed. This can be achieved by limiting the residual gas re-adsorption during the measurement resulting in a detection limit of about cP,min ≈ 5 ⋅ 1015 cm- 3. These measurement parameters were used to investigate a single crystal SiC bulk sample grown by the modified Lely method with intentional P doping and an N doped epitaxial SiC layer sample...|$|R
30|$|To {{elucidate}} the adsorption effect, {{we also have}} measured the dark current and photocurrent of Er-CdS NR in lower vacuum. It is found that the dark current decreases, but the photocurrent ratios of the Er-CdS NR to the dark current are 350, 800, and 1500 under illuminations with torch light, weak table light, and strong table light, respectively (the pressure is 3 [*]×[*] 10 − 3  Torr), and the dark current (Additional file 1 : Figure S 1) has increased 2 ~ 6 times in vacuum (3 [*]×[*] 10 − 3  Torr) compared with that in air at room temperature. Combined with Fig.  3 b, {{it is found that}} the surface absorption and desorption [30 – 32] (have important influence on) do affect not only the dark current but also the photocurrent ratio of the Er-CdS NR. The PC mechanism of Er-CdS NR is governed by the adsorption of oxygen as well as <b>intrinsic</b> carriers and <b>ionization</b> dopants.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} moderate-resolution (~ 20 km/s) {{spectrum}} of the mini broad-absorption-line QSO PG 1351 + 64 between 915 - 1180 A, obtained with the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE). Additional spectra at longer wavelengths were also obtained with the HST and ground-based telescopes. Broad absorption is present on the blue wings of CIII 977, Ly-beta, OVI 1032, 1038, Ly-alpha, NV 1238, 1242, SiIV 1393, 1402, and CIV 1548, 1450. The absorption profile can be fitted with five components at velocities of ~ - 780, - 1049, - 1629, - 1833, and - 3054 km/s {{with respect to the}} emission-line redshift of z = 0. 088. All the absorption components cover a large fraction of the continuum source as well as the broad-line region. The OVI emission feature is very weak, and the OVI/Lyalpha flux ratio is 0. 08, one of the lowest among low-redshift active galaxies and QSOs. The UV continuum shows a significant change in slope near 1050 A in the restframe. The steeper continuum shortward of the Lyman limit extrapolates well to the observed weak X-ray flux level. The absorbers' properties {{are similar to those of}} high-redshift broad absorption-line QSOs. The derived total column density of the UV absorbers is on the order of 10 ^ 21 cm^- 2, unlikely to produce significant opacity above 1 keV in the X-ray. Unless there is a separate, high-ionization X-ray absorber, the QSO's weak X-ray flux may be <b>intrinsic.</b> The <b>ionization</b> level of the absorbing components is comparable to that anticipated in the broad-line region, therefore the absorbers may be related to broad-line clouds along the line of sight.

40|$|The <b>intrinsic</b> <b>ionization</b> {{energy of}} a base in DNA plays a {{critical}} role in determining the energies at which damage mechanisms may emerge. Here, a two-photon resonance-enhanced ionization scheme is presented that utilizes the 1 ππ* transition, localized on the DNA base, to elucidate the base-specific ionization in a deprotonated nucleotide. In contrast to previous reports, the scheme is insensitive to competing ionization channels arising from the sugar–phosphate backbone. Using this approach, we demonstrate that for all bases except guanine, the lowest electron detachment energy corresponds to detachment from the sugar–phosphate backbone and allows us to determine the lowest adiabatic ionization energy for the other three bases {{for the first time in}} an isolated nucleotide. ...|$|E
40|$|Amiodarone is {{a potent}} {{antianginal}} and antiarrhythmic drug which affects the lipid dynamics. The influence of amiodarone ionization on the lipid transition temperature and enthalpy associated to the liquid crystalline to gel state transition was studied in multilamellar vesicles (MLV) of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) by differential scanning measurements (DSC) at different pH. These data were correlated with the calculated number of charged amiodarone molecules inserted into the lipid vesicles. The procedure of calculation requires {{the knowledge of the}} <b>intrinsic</b> <b>ionization</b> constant of amiodarone and the area occupied per amiodarone molecule in the close packed state; it can be applied successfully to water insoluble amphiphilic molecules. Only the ionized form of amiodarone molecule destabilizes the lipid matrix organisation whereas no effect was observed with the uncharged form. This destabilizing effect could be explained in terms of a modification of the drug structure induced by its ionization state or in terms of its distribution in the lipid matrix, as an isolated molecule or assembled in clusters depending on its ionization state.

40|$|Among the {{candidates}} for generating turbulence in accretion discs in situations with low <b>intrinsic</b> <b>ionization</b> the vertical shear instability (VSI) {{has become an}} interesting candidate, as it relies purely on a vertical gradient in the angular velocity. Existing simulations have shown that α-values a few times 10 ^- 4 can be generated. The particle growth in the early planet formation phase {{is determined by the}} dynamics of dust particles. Here, we address in particular the efficiency of VSI-turbulence in concentrating particles in order to generate overdensities and low collision velocities. We perform 3 D numerical hydrodynamical simulations of accretion discs around young stars that include radiative transport and irradiation from the central star. The motion of particles within a size range of a fraction of mm up to several m is followed using standard drag formula. We confirm that under realistic conditions the VSI is able to generate turbulence in full 3 D protoplanetary discs. The irradiated disc shows turbulence within 10 to 60 au. The mean radial motion of the gas is such that it is directed inward near the midplane and outward in the surface layers. We find that large particles drift inward with the expected speed, while small particles can experience phases of outward drift. Additionally, the particles show bunching behaviour with overdensities reaching 5 times the average value, which is strongest for dimensionless stopping times around unity. Particles in a VSI-turbulent discs are concentrated in large scale turbulent eddies and show low relative speeds that allow for growing collisions. The reached overdensities will also allow for the onset streaming instabilities further enhancing particle growth. The outward drift for small particles at higher disk elevations allows for the transport of processed high temperature material in the Solar System to larger distances...|$|E
40|$|Intrinsic, {{extrinsic}} (transition {{metals and}} hydroxyl), and induced (color centers) absorption of multicomponent silicate glasses in UV, visible and near JR spectral regions are described. Parasitic effects influencing absorption measurements are discussed. Excitation to the intrinsic absorption band results in <b>intrinsic</b> luminescence and <b>ionization</b> followed by color center generation and phosphorescence. The thresholds of electron and hole mobility in glass network {{are found in}} the far UV region. The hole-centers generation as a criterion of substance ionization is proposed. A number of nonlinear mechanisms of glass ionization are discussed. Two-photon ionization was detected in alkaline-silicate glasses exposed to high-power laser radiation in nano- and picosecond regimes [...] Three-photon ionization was detected in lead-silicate glasses. No reliable data on multiphoton ionization (with number of photons more than 3) of glasses are found. Two- and three-photon cooperative self-multiplication of color centers was found in CuC 1 -doped glasses. Glass matrix ionization by spectral broadening of femtosecond JR pulses is described. Thermal and surface ionization of glass under intense irradiation by pulsed lasers is described. 1...|$|R
