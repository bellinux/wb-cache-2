5|$|In the United Kingdom a {{total of}} 4100ha were planted with bulbs, of which 3800ha were Narcissi, the UK's most {{important}} bulb crop, much of which is for export, making this the largest global production centre, {{about half of the}} total production area. While some of the production is for forcing, most is for <b>dry</b> <b>bulb</b> production. Bulb production and forcing occurs in the East, while production in the south west is mainly for outdoor flower production. The farm gate value was estimated at £10m in 2007.|$|E
25|$|The actual {{temperature}} in a drying kiln is the dry-bulb temperature (usually denoted by Tg), {{which is the}} temperature of a vapour-gas mixture determined by inserting a thermometer with a <b>dry</b> <b>bulb.</b> On the other hand, the wet-bulb temperature (TW) {{is defined as the}} temperature reached by a small amount of liquid evaporating in a large amount of an unsaturated air-vapour mixture. The temperature sensing element of this thermometer is kept moist with a porous fabric sleeve (cloth) usually put in a reservoir of clean water. A minimum air flow of 2m/s is needed to prevent a zone of stagnant damp air formation around the sleeve (Walker et al., 1993). Since air passes over the wet sleeve, water is evaporated and cools the wet-bulb thermometer. The difference between the dry-bulb and wet-bulb temperatures, the wet-bulb depression, is used to determine the relative humidity from a standard hygrometric chart (Walker et al., 1993). A higher difference between the dry-bulb and wet-bulb temperatures indicates a lower relative humidity. For example, if the dry-bulb temperature is 100°C and wet-bulb temperature 60°C, then the relative humidity is read as 17% from a hygrometric chart.|$|E
500|$|Tulips {{have been}} {{cultivated}} {{since at least}} the tenth century [...] in Persia. Tulip production has two main markets: cut flowers and bulb. The latter are used, in turn, to meet the demand for bulbs for parks, gardens and home use and, secondly, to provide the necessary bulbs for cut flower production. International trade in cut flowers has an approximate total value of 11 billion euros, which provides an indication of the economic importance of this activity. The main producer of tulip bulbs is the Netherlands, a country that accounts for 87% of the global cultivated area, with approximately 12,000 hectares. Other leading producers include Japan, France and Poland. Approximately ten other countries produce commercial tulips, largely for the domestic market. By contrast, the Netherlands is the leading international producer, to the extent of 4 billion bulbs per annum. Of these, 53% are used for the cut flower market and the remainder for the <b>dry</b> <b>bulb</b> market. Of the cut flowers, 57% are used for the domestic market in the Netherlands and the remainder exported.|$|E

One half was occupied by my bedstead, beneath which was stowed my box of clothes, while my books and writing materials were placed under the table. The barometer hung in the most out-of-the-way corner, and my other instruments all around. A small candle was burning in a glass shade, to keep the draught and insects from the light, and I had the comfort of seeing the knife, fork, and spoon laid on a white napkin, as I entered my snug little house, and flung myself on the elastic couch to ruminate on {{the proceedings of the}} day, and speculate on those of the morrow, while waiting for my meal, which usually consisted of stewed meat and rice, with biscuits and tea. My thermometers (wet and <b>dry</b> <b>bulb,</b> and minimum) hung under a temporary canopy made of thickly plaited bamboo and leaves close to the tent, and the cooking was performed by my servant under a tree.|$|E

40|$|A new alkaloid, {{belonging}} to the pretazettine group of Amaryllidaceae alkaloids, was isolated from <b>dried</b> <b>bulbs</b> of Narcissus jonquilla quail and named jonquailine. Its structure, including the absolute configuration, was elucidated using various NMR, ECD and ESI MS techniques. Initial biological evaluation revealed significant antiproliferative effects against glioblastoma, melanoma, uterine sarcoma and non-small-cell lung cancer cells displaying various forms of drug resistance, including resistance to apoptosis and multi-drug resistance. Jonquailine was also found to synergize with paclitaxel in its antiproliferative action against drug-resistant lung cancer cells. The results obtained compared with literature data also showed that the hydroxylation at C- 8 is an important feature for the anticancer activity but this seems unaffected by the stereochemistry or the acetalization of the lactol.
