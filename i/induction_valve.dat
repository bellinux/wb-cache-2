500|$|Triton {{departed}} New London on 16 February 1960 {{for what}} was announced as her shakedown cruise (pictured). [...] Triton set course to the south-east (134 degrees true). At dawn on 17 February, Triton performed her first morning star-sighting using the built-in sextant in her No. 1 periscope during the nightly ventilation of the shipboard atmosphere.

2500|$|On 12 May 1939, {{following}} a yard overhaul, Squalus {{began a series}} of test dives off Portsmouth, New Hampshire. After successfully completing 18 dives, she went down again off the Isles of Shoals on the morning of 23 May at [...] Failure of the main <b>induction</b> <b>valve</b> caused the flooding of the aft torpedo room, both engine rooms, and the crew's quarters, drowning 26 men immediately. Quick action by the crew prevented the other compartments from flooding. Squalus bottomed in [...] of water.|$|E
2500|$|At 22:00, as Ringgold and {{the cruiser}} [...] pushed {{ahead of the}} attack force, they picked up a radar contact. Word had been passed to watch for the submarine, but it was {{believed}} that she had moved westward that afternoon to rescue a downed flier, and that she would submerge once she encountered friendly forces. However, Nautilus being near a reef, did not submerge. Admiral Hill, anxious to avoid any encounters with possible Japanese patrols, gave the order to take the contact under fire. Ringgolds first salvo struck the base of the sub's conning tower. Although it ruptured her main <b>induction</b> <b>valve,</b> it did not explode. Nautilus submerged in [...] "dire circumstances", but was able to make it to Abemama and complete her mission.|$|E
50|$|The Cox line of {{reed valve}} engines {{designed}} prior to 1960 used a rear reed <b>valve</b> <b>induction</b> system. In the late 1950s they played around with rear rotary <b>valve</b> <b>induction</b> (as {{used in the}} RR1) before moving forward with front rotary <b>valve</b> <b>induction</b> for their Tee Dee and Medallion lines.|$|R
50|$|The 6B31 {{features}} an aluminum variable intake manifold {{that uses a}} resin-made 2-stage <b>Induction</b> Control <b>Valve</b> to provide the benefits of short and long intake tracts, automatically switching in response to engine speed. A flap inside the <b>Induction</b> Control <b>Valve</b> remains closed below 3,600 rpm, forcing the intake charge to take a longer route to the inlet valves. Over 3,600 rpm, the flap opens, providing a shorter tract to the valves to increase power. Positioning the EGR distribution inlet on the upper intake manifold, far from the throttle valve, improves real-world fuel consumption by lowering the temperature entering the EGR distribution passageway.|$|R
5000|$|Engine: Liquid cooled, two stroke, single cylinder, piston reed <b>valve</b> <b>induction.</b>|$|R
50|$|The base 164 {{engine was}} the 2.0 L Twin Spark I4 engine with two spark plugs per cylinder. Apart from that, this engine was also notable {{for having a}} {{two-stage}} valve timing system (before Honda's famous VTEC), and an <b>induction</b> <b>valve</b> blade-type system, aimed at improving low-end torque.|$|E

50|$|Normal {{procedure}} {{was to leave}} the main air <b>induction</b> <b>valve</b> open until the engines {{had a chance to}} come to a full stop, this operation being so timed as to occur just prior to complete submergence. In the case of S-5, however, the chief of the boat, Gunner's Mate Percy Fox, the man responsible for operating this valve, was momentarily distracted. Noticing the mistake, he grabbed the valve lever and jerked hard, causing the valve to jam open.|$|E
5000|$|Alfred Scott's first {{motorcycle}} {{was developed}} {{from his own}} [...] twin-cylinder engine design which he hand built and fitted to the steering head of a bicycle. These engines were used to power equipment such as lathes and light machinery and Scott {{had been involved in}} the manufacture of 'Premier' pedal cycles. He developed this prototype into a motorcycle and six were produced under contract by friends with a car company called Jowett in Bradford. Scott patented an early form of caliper brakes in 1897 (Patent GB 1626 of 1897), designed a fully triangulated frame, rotary <b>induction</b> <b>valves,</b> and used unit construction for his motorcycle engine.|$|R

50|$|The ship sailed from New York City on 25 February 1945, {{bound for}} Norfolk, Virginia. There it loaded 6,675 tons of {{aircraft}} bombs in its holds. With loading complete, it steamed for Bari, Italy on 9 March, but returned {{the same day}} to repair its condenser's main <b>induction</b> <b>valve.</b> The ship waited five days for the next Mediterranean-bound convoy, UGS-80. Upon arriving at Gibraltar, the Charles Henderson proceeded independently to Bari, via Augusta, Sicily, arriving 5 April.|$|E

Quick action by the crew prevented the other compartments from flooding. Squalus bottomed in 243 ft of water.|$|E
5000|$|Patterson {{lost his}} life aboard the Squalus on May 23, 1939 when the main <b>induction</b> <b>valve</b> failed to close off the Isles of Shoals. This caused the aft torpedo room, both engine rooms, and the crew's {{quarters}} to be flooded. He {{was one of}} 26 men to drown immediately, and the only officer {{to die in the}} accident. The rest of the surviving crew was rescued by the USS Falcon led by Lieutenant Commander Charles [...] "Swede" [...] Momsen and the Squalus was refloated where Patterson and his dead crewmates were recovered.|$|E
50|$|The Silver Hawk’s 592 cc {{design was}} a {{development}} of the Silver Arrow and shared a similar frame design and cycle parts, {{as well as the}} monoblock 26 degree V with a one-piece OHC head concept. The single bevel-gear overhead camshaft ran across the cylinder head and four bores with special air cooling housed two pairs of cylinders at 26 degrees to each other. A single carburettor fed all four <b>induction</b> <b>valves</b> through a cross shaped induction that produced an uneven feed. Coil and dynamo ignition was driven by skew gearing from the camshaft-drive vertical shaft. A dry-sump oil system was supplied from a steel tank {{at the base of the}} front-down tube, bolted to the engine's crankcase. The engine was flexible, however, and could be started by hand and run in top gear most of the time. This was an important factor for the hand operated gear change.|$|R
50|$|Starting in 1925, FIAT began {{preparing}} {{an engine}} and {{car for the}} new 1926 1.5 litre racing formula, adopted in both Europe and the USA. For the engine, designated the 'type 406', FIAT chose to mount two 750 cc six-cylinder banks {{side by side on}} a common aluminium crankcase, with their crankshafts geared to a common output shaft. A single Roots-type supercharger driven from the nose of the right-hand crankshaft delivered mixture to a pair of intake manifolds located between the cylinder blocks at 13 psi boost. The left-hand crankshaft drove the single water pump. A single shared centrally mounted camshaft, patented by Guido Fornaca, operated the <b>induction</b> <b>valves</b> which were on the inside of each cylinder bank; two camshafts mounted outboard drove the exhaust valves. Twin Bosch magnetos were driven from the tail of the central camshaft. The engine weighed 381 lbs, not excessive for the time. On test the unit delivered 187 bhp at 8,500 rpm at maximum boost.|$|R
50|$|The RD500LC (Race Developed 500CC Liquid Cooled motorcycle)uses a 50-degree, twin-crankshaft V4 engine layout. Linked Yamaha YPVS exhaust power valves are {{controlled}} by a single electronic unit and servo motor and are designed to give a broader power band. The engine also features intake reed valves unlike the YZR500 racer which used rotary disc <b>valve</b> <b>induction.</b> The reed <b>valves</b> use two different intake arrangements, the lower cylinders are fed through crankcase mounted reeds; the upper pair use cylinder barrel mounted reeds. The four Mikuni carburettors are side mounted in pairs and feed each cylinder through 90 degree intake manifold.The lower expansion chambers exit normally but the upper pipes cross over each other just behind the exhaust ports to maintain the correct tuned length.|$|R
50|$|At 18:50 in {{the evening}} of 26 August 1988, Pacocha was transiting on the surface with the forward torpedo room and bridge hatches {{as well as the}} main <b>induction</b> <b>valve</b> open. Forty-nine men were aboard, {{including}} the squadron commander, to conduct an operational readiness inspection. About half an hour after sunset, ten minutes from Pachocha’s expected arrival at the port of Callao, the 412-ton Japanese fishing trawler Kiowa Maru (also spelled Kyowa Maru and Hyowa Maru) rammed her in the aft port quarter. Kiowa Maru was equipped with an ice-breaker bow, with a sub-surface protrusion designed to penetrate and break apart what it struck. Pacocha sank quickly.|$|E
50|$|Albacore {{was again}} bombed by American {{aircraft}} on 10 November. This time, the submarine suffered considerable damage. All auxiliary power was knocked out, and the submarine was plunged into total darkness. The main <b>induction</b> <b>valve</b> went under water {{before it was}} shut, and it began filling up with water. Albacore plunged {{to a depth of}} 450 ft before her dive was checked. For the next two and one-half hours, she bounced between 30 ft and 400 ft while at various attitudes. She finally managed to return to the surface with her trim almost restored. The submarine re-submerged, and it was decided to continue the patrol while simultaneously making necessary repairs.|$|E
5000|$|She {{returned}} to Tarawa 18 November to obtain last-minute information on weather and surf conditions, landing hazards {{and the results}} of recent bombardments. At 21:59, 19 November, mistaking her as an enemy, the destroyer [...] fired at her, sending a five-inch (127 mm) shell through the conning tower, damaging the main <b>induction</b> <b>valve.</b> Diving as soon as the water depth permitted, the boat was rigged for depth charge and the damage control party went to work. Within two hours repairs were sufficient to allow Nautilus to continue with her primary mission: landing a 78-man scouting party, composed of 5th Amphibious Reconnaissance Company marines and an Australian scout, on Abemama.|$|E
50|$|The {{engine was}} {{advanced}} for its time, with features normally seen on race bikes: two-cylinder, two-stroke, air-cooled, oil injected, dual rotary valve. While other manufactures had utilised {{the advantages of}} rotary disc <b>valve</b> <b>induction</b> on small single-cylinder machines, only Kawasaki and Bridgestone produced twin-cylinder machines. Rotary disc <b>valve</b> <b>induction</b> ensures that the all the fuel charge is used and not partly lost (as in a piston ported engine). As a result, it produces more power, more torque at low revs and better response throughout the rev range. The engine's initial air supply began in an air filter canister below the seat and was drawn through a large plenum chamber just above the transmission and behind the cylinder head, then down into the internal passages leading to the carburetor housing feeding the carburetors.|$|R
5000|$|The {{engine for}} all KR-1 models was a two-cylinder, reed <b>valve</b> <b>induction</b> {{two-stroke}} motor of [...] (somewhat {{based on the}} previous Yamaha TZ/TZR configurations). The 180° firing parallel twin configuration featured a crank driven balance shaft. The power delivery was broadened {{with the use of}} the Kawasaki Integrated Powervalve System (K.I.P.S.) arrangement shared by other Kawasaki two-strokes.|$|R
2500|$|The KFM 107 is a {{conventional}} twin-cylinder engine {{that is very}} compact and light weight at only [...] in its 107s version. The engine features single capacitor discharge ignition, a single Tillotson butterfly-type carburetor, integral fuel pump, tuned exhaust system and reed <b>valve</b> <b>induction.</b> It was offered with 2:1 belt drive reduction system. Starting is electric starter or recoil starter.|$|R

5000|$|Authorized {{under the}} Fiscal Year 1936 {{provision}} of the Vinson-Trammell Act, two distinct, but very similar, designs were developed, to be built by three different constructors. The Electric Boat Company of Groton, Connecticut designed and built , , and [...] (SS-182 to 184). The Navy's lead submarine design entity, the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard of Kittery, Maine submitted a design for the Government group, which became [...] and [...] (SS-185 & 186). Using the Portsmouth plans and acting as a follow yard, the Mare Island Naval Shipyard of Vallejo, California built [...] The two designs differed in minor details such as {{the locations of the}} access hatches for the forward engine room and crew's quarters, the shape of the horizontal conning tower cylinder, and, most significantly, the closure of the main <b>induction</b> <b>valve.</b> This difference led to casualties in Snapper and Sturgeon, and to the loss of Squalus. Larger than the design of the Porpoise-class, the conning tower installed by Electric Boat had two concave spherical ends, The Portsmouth design had a concave end aft and a convex one forward. Portsmouth and Mare Island ran into production difficulties with their conning towers, discovering cracks that caused the cylinder to fail the required pressure test. The problem was successfully fixed, but the experience caused the government yards to adopt the double concave design for the next several years.|$|E
5000|$|On 11 March 1949 she was {{transferred}} to the 5th Submarine Flotilla reserve and entered drydock to be retrofitted with a snort mast (snorkel device)—a pneumatically raised and lowered steel tube which, when in the vertical position worked as an air induction/exhaust emission device which could be raised and lowered from the control room. Once vertical it was self-locking and drew air into the submarine at periscope depth, permitting the submarine to charge batteries and run diesels for propulsion below the surface, allowing the sub to remain underwater. At the point where the air intake entered the pressure hull of the submarine there was a bulbous casting—set about half a metre above the hull, this housed the main <b>induction</b> <b>valve.</b> This very important casing was totally concealed and protected by the free flooding hull. The snort mast on the Affray was designed for both air intake and exhaust vent; this was later changed so the snort mast was an air intake only and the exhaust was moved {{to the rear of the}} conning tower. The snort mast had a float valve that would close automatically if the submarine dropped below periscope depth. In December of that same year Affray was sent to the Mediterranean; it was recorded during deep dives in this sea that she began [...] "leaking like a sieve" [...] and that the Admiralty class diesels started leaking oil.|$|E
50|$|The 250 is a {{conventional}} single-cylinder engine that weighs only 13 lb. The engine features single- or optional dual-ignition, reed <b>valve</b> <b>induction,</b> free air cooling, tuned exhaust system, a slide venturi-type Bing carburetor, fuel pump, Nikasil cylinder coatings. The engine was offered with a gearbox reduction system {{that included a}} one-way clutch. Starting is electric starter with no provision for a recoil starter.|$|R
5000|$|The F-33 was {{intended}} to fill the niche previously occupied by the now out-of-production [...] Rotax 277. The F-33 uses free air cooling, dual capacitor discharge ignition and reed <b>valve</b> <b>induction,</b> with a single Bing 34mm slide or optional diaphragm type carburetor. The cylinder walls are electrochemically coated with Nikasil. Standard starting is recoil start. A belt reduction drive system, fuel injection, tuned exhaust and electric start are optional.|$|R
50|$|The SC 430 is {{a unique}} three {{cylinder}} radial engine that is very compact and lightweight at only 17 kg. The engine features single capacitor discharge ignition, a single Bing 49 diaphragm type carburetor and rotary <b>valve</b> <b>induction.</b> It is currently offered without a reduction drive, although when Zanzottera built it a 1.75:1 cog belt reduction drive was available. Starting is electric starter only and a recoil starter is not an option.|$|R
40|$|The basic {{requirements}} for range extender engines are low cost, compact dimensions, high specific power, good efficiency, low pollutant emission levels, excellent NVH behavior. For a power rate lower than 30 kW, {{it is very}} difficult to find an off-the-shelf engine meeting all the requirements listed above, so that a new generation of dedicated engines is under development. Following a preliminary theoretical work presented in 2012, the current paper reviews the design process and the first experimental tests carried out on a novel 2 -stroke GDI single-cylinder engine, rated at 30 kW at 4500 rpm, featuring a patented <b>induction</b> <b>valve</b> and a piston pump for scavenging. A prototype has been designed with the support of CFD simulations, then built and tested at the BRC laboratories, in Cherasco (Italy) ...|$|E
40|$|A very {{promising}} concept for small range extenders (peak power less than 40 kW) {{is represented by}} the 2 -stroke, direct injection spark ignition engine, with scavenging and exhaust ports controlled by the piston, and an external pump. The most important issue to be addressed on this type of engines is the compliance with stringent rules on pollutant emissions, which depends on combustion patterns {{and the quality of the}} scavenging process. The latter is generally hindered by the symmetry of ports timings, but this handicap can be canceled by adopting a patented rotary valve, controlling the flow through a set of auxiliary transfer ports, and using a piston pump for delivering air to the power cylinder and enhancing the balance of the crankshaft. The paper reviews the design of a virtual engine, rated at 35 kW at 5600 rpm, and developed according to the above mentioned concepts. Design has been driven by CFD simulation, using, whenever possible, experimentally calibrated numerical models, or experimental information derived from similar projects. Particular care has been devoted to characterize the scavenging process and the flow patterns within the cylinder and through the ports, analyzing the influence of the rotary <b>induction</b> <b>valve.</b> Engine performance parameters have been predicted by using a well-established commercial software (GT-Power, by Gamma Technologies), while CFD- 3 D analyses have been carried out by means of a customized version of the KIVA- 3 V code. The whole study is conceived as the basis for the construction of a physical prototype. The power target has been virtually achieved with a very light and compact engine (estimated weight without the close-coupled electric motor: 35 kg). A three-way catalyst allows the engine to comply with the most stringent emission regulations, without relevant penalizations on fuel efficiency. Furthermore, the engine can work with lean mixtures, achieving a minimum specific fuel consumption comparable to a current automotive Diesel engine (223 g/kWh). This excellent result is due to the low friction and pumping losses of the 2 -Stroke engine, as well as to the compactness of the combustion chamber and the capability to stratify the charge...|$|E
5000|$|In contrast, the Suzuki {{team were}} {{committed}} to two-stroke technology and their single cylinder RM62 machine featured rotary <b>valve</b> <b>induction</b> and an 8-speed transmission and produced about [...] at 12,000 rpm. Ernst Degner who had defected from the East German MZ team to Suzuki the previous year, brought with him the secrets of MZ’s two-stroke tuning success which undoubtedly helped him and the Suzuki team to secure the inaugural 50 cc World Championship.|$|R

5000|$|The TS185 {{is lighter}} than the 125 by a few pounds, and has nearly {{the power of the}} 250 but with a much more free revving motor. The 250 is [...] heavier than the 185. The larger TS series, 125 and over had piston port engines while the smaller TS series-90 and 100 had rotary <b>valve</b> <b>induction,</b> until the {{introduction}} of the ER series motors. With the only major redesign of the motors of this series, the new range shifted to a combined reed-valve and piston port type.|$|R
