500|$|When {{asked about}} the success of Frozen, {{director}} Chris Buck stated: [...] "We never expected anything like this. We just hoped {{to make a movie}} that did as well as Tangled! I hoped the audience would embrace it and respond to it, but there's no way we could have predicted this." [...] He cited a number of reasons for the film's popularity: [...] "There are characters that people relate to; the songs are so strong and memorable. We also have some flawed characters, which is what Jen and I like to do– we essentially create two imperfect princesses." [...] As Frozen approached the first anniversary of its release, Menzel mentioned the film's continuing popularity in an October 2014 interview: [...] "It’s just a remarkable thing. Usually you do a project and it has its moment. This <b>just</b> <b>feels</b> like it keeps going." ...|$|E
500|$|Palpatine's wardrobe, {{tailored}} by {{costume designer}} Trisha Biggar, {{played an important}} part {{in the development of the}} character throughout the films.

[...] In the next episode, McDiarmid remarked, [...] "To wear the costumes as the character I play is wonderfully empowering." [...] McDiarmid's favorite costume in Revenge of the Sith was a high-collared jacket that resembles snake or lizard skin. He stated that [...] "it <b>just</b> <b>feels</b> reptilian, which is exactly right for [...]" [...] According to Trisha Biggar, Palpatine's costumes proved the most daunting challenge. She said, [...] "His six costumes get progressively darker and more ornately decorated throughout the movie. He wears greys and browns, almost going to black, taking him toward the dark side." ...|$|E

500|$|Finding it {{difficult}} for hardcore gamers to fully enjoy Phantom Hourglass, Nintendo World Report claimed that the game's lack of alternative control schemes was a telling sign that Nintendo did not have The Legend of Zelda fans in mind when creating the game. They still described the game as [...] "decent", but felt that [...] "it’s also a game {{apart from the rest}} of the series. It <b>just</b> <b>feels</b> different, and I think it demonstrates that Nintendo is reluctant to sail into the murky waters beyond Wind Waker." [...] The American newspaper The New York Times enjoyed Phantom Hourglass for the most part, but complained about the timer in the Temple of the Ocean King as unnecessary and gimmicky, remarking that the game's dungeons are only [...] "fun to go through once, but none of them are fun enough to go through 20 times". They noted that the time spent traveling through dungeons [...] "removed all thoughts of it being perfect".|$|E
500|$|Germain Lussier of /Film {{wrote of}} the film, [...] "The whole thing <b>just</b> <b>feels</b> perfect or magical, a shining example of what cinema is all about", adding, [...] "The {{performances}} are mindblowing, the writing sharp, and the direction beautiful. It's a very special movie." [...] In Variety, critic Peter Debruge wrote, [...] "the stunning SXSW fest winner puts the recent Park City competition lineup to shame ... this compelling human drama finds fresh energy in the inspirational-teacher genre, constantly revealing new layers to its characters." [...] In a review for the Los Angeles Times, Kenneth Turan described Short Term 12 as [...] "a small wonder", [...] "a film of exceptional naturalness and empathy", and [...] "moving and intimate", offering particular praise to the film's honesty and plausibility. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian, on the other hand, criticized the film's credibility, describing it as [...] "well intentioned, but somehow inauthentic" [...] with a [...] "too-cute-to-be-true ending".|$|E
500|$|Most reviews {{compared}} {{the game with}} F-Zero X which was released a month earlier, with the general assumption that Nintendo's own futuristic racer offered more tracks and racing craft, but Wipeout 64 contained superior track design and atmosphere. GameSpot gave the game a lower score of 6.9 out of 10, stating that [...] "WipeOut 64 isn't horrible, it <b>just</b> <b>feels</b> like the developer's first effort for the system at times - which it is". [...] "Sayewonn" [...] of Gaming Age gave Wipeout 64 8 out of 10 stars, praising its new innovations, especially its analogue control, saying that [...] "adapting analogue controls was the biggest improvement racing games made and Wipeout 64 demonstrates that beautifully". Sayewonn {{also noted that the}} game still had a [...] "learning curve", saying that [...] "it’s not as brutal as the first game but definitely harder than the far easier XL". However, despite being complimentary of Wipeout 64, both GameSpot and Gaming Age recommended purchasing F-Zero X instead.|$|E

500|$|... "Kiss & Cry" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} [...] music critics. A reviewer from Selective Hearing was positive in their review, labeling it a [...] "very catchy track". They also selected {{it as one}} of the best track on the album. CD Journal reviewers noted the song's [...] "surprising introduction", and described the song as an [...] "impressive R tune with a heavy beat". [...] Tomoyuki Mori from Amazon was positive in his review, complimenting Utada's songwriting and production. He also praised the [...] "gorgeous atmospheric" [...] composition, and labelled it [...] "charming". Tetsuo Hiraga from Hot Express described the song as [...] "fun", and highlighted its composition as a strong factor to its overall delivery. However, Daniel Robson, who wrote for The Japan Times, felt its inclusion into Heart Station was disappointing as he quoted, [...] " [...] it’s followed by a run of five previous singles and a short, dull interlude track, which <b>just</b> <b>feels</b> so lazy." [...] He felt the inclusion, alongside other singles, made him question the value of the overall album.|$|E
500|$|Harley Carlson of MetalReview.com {{regarded}} Octavarium as [...] "successfully [...] the band's {{ability to}} craft emotive music," [...] although {{noted that it}} is [...] "unquestionably Dream Theater, yet there is something missing." [...] Vik Bansal of musicOMH praised [...] "Never Enough", [...] "Panic Attack" [...] and [...] "Sacrificed Sons", but dismissed [...] "The Root of All Evil" [...] as [...] "Dream Theater by the numbers". He criticized [...] "Octavarium" [...] as [...] "bloated", although noted that fans of the band's A Change of Seasons would enjoy it. He said that [...] "there's enough on the remainder of Octavarium to keep {{the rest of us}} interested and the prog rock haters whining dismissively". Writing for Exclaim!, Greg Pratt praised the album's artwork and production, but said that [...] "there’s nothing that blows any minds here, or even gives a mild bend; hell, a good chunk of this disc feels like basic radio rock from the local old-guy bar band". He noted that although there were some longer songs on the album, [...] "this <b>just</b> <b>feels</b> like 76 minutes of overdramatic rock, too heavy on the light and weak, and not enough time spent on just showing off".|$|E
500|$|... "Like a Virgin" [...] {{was written}} by Billy Steinberg and Tom Kelly. The idea for the song {{originated}} when Steinberg was living at his father's vineyards in the Coachella Valley, and driving a red pickup truck one day. In {{an interview with the}} Los Angeles Times, Steinberg explained that the song was not written for Madonna or any female singer but was inspired by his personal experiences. At that time Steinberg had just come out of an emotionally challenging relationship, and he had met someone new. That inspired the lyrics for [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] about how he coped with the difficult situation. When he took the song to Kelly, they decided {{that it would be a}} sensitive ballad, however they could not decide how the word [...] "virgin" [...] would fit in it. Steinberg elaborated: [...] "I wasn't just trying to get that racy word virgin in a lyric. I was saying ... that I may not really be a virgin— I've been battered romantically and emotionally like many people— but I'm starting a new relationship and it <b>just</b> <b>feels</b> so good, it's healing all the wounds and making me feel like I've never done this before, because it's so much deeper and more profound than anything I've ever felt." ...|$|E

500|$|Erin Martin of PopMatters {{said that}} [...] "When Love Takes Over" [...] had euphoric properties. Martin said {{the song was}} [...] "a classic, triumphant dance number, and Rowland's {{powerhouse}} vocals ensure that this song has anthemic potential for years to come. This song <b>just</b> <b>feels</b> good to listen to". She {{also noted that the}} song was central to the concept and [...] "love-spreading message [...] Guetta delivers on the album as a whole." [...] David Balls of Digital Spy agreed with the song's anthem credentials. [...] " [...] is further evidence that Rowland may no longer be resigned to living in Beyoncé [...] shadow. Fusing classic dance beats with a heady, emotionally charged vocal, it's a world away from the mid-tempo R numbers with which she started her solo career. In fact, this packs a punch from the very first listen, meaning it could well become one of the summer anthems of 2009." [...] However, Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times was less impressed than the other critics, simply noting the song as [...] "a cheesy synthpop makeover of Coldplay's 'Clocks'." [...] Wood did however state that it was among Guetta's best work and was an example of when the DJ is [...] "most commercial".|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} of the episode was not entirely favorable. Television columnist Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger commented {{that he had not}} really liked any of Elaine Stritch's appearances as Jack's mother on the series, writing that [...] "Jack's fear and loathing of his mother <b>just</b> <b>feels</b> claustrophobic and uncomfortable instead of funny, and I'm as eager to see the end of her visits as [...] usually is." [...] Sepinwall said that [...] "very little" [...] of [...] "Christmas Special" [...] worked. [...] "I {{want to be in the}} holiday spirit, but this is two Christmas duds in a row from 30 Rock, and we can't even blame the looming writers strike this time around." [...] IGN contributor Robert Canning believed the show could have delivered a Christmas episode, but noted that their attempt at it [...] "was a little less than satisfying. The ideas were there, but the rhythm of the episode was off." [...] Nonetheless, Canning said the episode was not terrible. He enjoyed all the plots except for Liz's, writing that it did not quite fit, and that [...] "the overall result of Liz's plot just wasn't all that funny." [...] In conclusion, Canning gave the episode a 7.8 out of 10 rating. Jeremy Medina for Paste found that there was nothing [...] "special" [...] about this episode. In his opinion, Liz should be featured in [...] "new and exciting plot line" [...] rather than helping Jack endure his troubles with his mother.|$|E
500|$|The {{format of}} the series also pays homage to Tales of the Unexpected, The Twilight Zone and Alfred Hitchcock Presents. Pemberton and Shearsmith {{returned}} to writing more macabre stories, according to the latter, as they [...] "always feel slightly unfulfilled if [...] write something that's purely comedic, it <b>just</b> <b>feels</b> too frivolous and light". During the filming of [...] "Sardines", Shearsmith professed excitement {{to be working on}} Inside No. 9, saying that [...] "being in the middle of filming a third series of Psychoville would be utterly depressing". Pemberton and Shearsmith aimed for a simpler experience than Psychoville, describing [...] "Sardines" [...] by saying the episode is [...] "just about some good actors in a wardrobe with a good story". As each episode of Inside No. 9 features new characters, the writers were able to attract actors who might have been unwilling to commit to an entire series. In addition to Pemberton and Shearsmith, [...] "Sardines" [...] starred Katherine Parkinson, Tim Key, Luke Pasqualino, Ophelia Lovibond, Anne Reid, Julian Rhind-Tutt, Anna Chancellor, Marc Wootton, Ben Willbond and Timothy West. West had previously starred in Tales of the Unexpected, and Shearsmith said that, due to this prior appearance, [...] "it was a great nod" [...] to have West in the episode. [...] "Sardines" [...] has more characters than any other episode of the first series, and these characters were written before casting took place. Pemberton recalls the fun he had in selecting a cast for the episode, aiming to bring together a very varied group of actors who would work well as a group.|$|E
