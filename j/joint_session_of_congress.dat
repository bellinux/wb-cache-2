In March 2009, Obama lifted a ban on using federal funds for stem cell research.|$|E

50|$|Also, {{in recent}} decades, newly inaugurated presidents {{have chosen to}} deliver speeches to <b>joint</b> <b>sessions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> {{in the early months}} of their presidencies, but have not officially {{considered}} them State of the Union addresses.|$|R
50|$|Much of the {{legislation}} dealt with by Congress is drafted at the initiative of the executive branch. The president may personally propose legislation in annual and special messages to Congress including the annual State of the Union address and <b>joint</b> <b>sessions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress.</b> If Congress has adjourned without acting on proposals, the president may call a special <b>session</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Congress.</b>|$|R

Two days later, in a nationally {{televised}} address to a <b>joint</b> <b>session</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress,</b> Clinton unveiled his economic plan. The plan focused on reducing the deficit rather than on cutting taxes for the middle class, which had been high on his campaign agenda.

This group—in particular, Democrats Max Baucus, Jeff Bingaman and Kent Conrad, along with Republicans Mike Enzi, Chuck Grassley and Olympia Snowe—met for more than 60 hours, and the principles that they discussed, in conjunction with the other committees, became the foundation of the Senate healthcare reform bill.|$|E
5|$|One of Breckinridge's final acts as {{vice-president}} was {{announcing the}} vote of the Electoral College to a <b>joint</b> <b>session</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> on February 13, 1861. Rumors abounded that he would tamper with the vote to prevent Lincoln's election. Knowing that some legislators planned to attend the session armed, Breckinridge asked Winfield Scott to post guards {{in and around the}} chambers. One legislator raised a point of order, requesting that the guards be ejected, but Breckinridge refused to sustain it; the electoral vote proceeded, and Breckinridge announced Lincoln's election as president. After Lincoln's arrival in Washington, D.C., on February 24, Breckinridge visited him at the Willard Hotel. After making a valedictory address on March 4, he swore in Hannibal Hamlin as his successor as vice president; Hamlin then swore in Breckinridge and the other incoming senators.|$|E
