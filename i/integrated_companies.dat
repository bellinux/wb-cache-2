25|$|It {{seems that}} around 1880 {{there was a}} change in {{manufacturing}} practice from companies with relatively homogeneous lines of products to horizontally <b>integrated</b> <b>companies</b> with unprecedented diversity in processes and products. Those companies (especially in metalworking) attempted to achieve success through economies of scope - the gains of jointly producing two or more products in one facility. The managers now needed information {{on the effect of}} product-mix decisions on overall profits and therefore needed accurate product-cost information. A variety of attempts to achieve this were unsuccessful due to the huge overhead of the information processing of the time. However, the burgeoning need for financial reporting after 1900 created unavoidable pressure for financial accounting of stock and the management need to cost manage products became overshadowed. In particular, it was the need for audited accounts that sealed the fate of managerial cost accounting. The dominance of financial reporting accounting over management accounting remains to this day with few exceptions, and the financial reporting definitions of 'cost' have distorted effective management 'cost' accounting since that time. This is particularly true of inventory.|$|E

30|$|When TPA is {{introduced}} in the LNG import market, the allocations of LNG trading volume between LI and LT are much different to the last two scenarios. In Scenario 3, the LNG imports of the <b>integrated</b> <b>company</b> (Scenario 3 —LI) are below 40 bcm, while the LNG import volume of LT is about 4 {{times more than the}} <b>integrated</b> <b>company.</b> On the other hand, in Scenario 4, the LNG import volume of LI is far more than the LT’s trading volume. Since the payment for LT renting LI’s LNG terminals is decided by market-clearing conditions, the player with stronger market power would benefit more in the negotiation of the rent. In Scenario 3, LI is only a sector of the <b>integrated</b> <b>company,</b> which means the <b>integrated</b> <b>company</b> can obtain its market share from domestic production. Therefore, the <b>integrated</b> <b>company</b> will use the LNG terminal less and lease the capacity to LT to obtain more profits. The results show that the <b>integrated</b> <b>company</b> gets a payment of 449.2 billion RMB from surplus regasification capacity leasing using its market power. In Scenario 4, LI is an independent company which has less power than the <b>integrated</b> <b>company</b> in Scenario 3. To keep its market share, LI will not lease out all of its regasification capacity; as a result, LI can only get a total rent of 123.6 billion RMB from LT.|$|R

50|$|In business, the {{difference}} between the sale price and the production cost of a product is the unit profit. In economics, the sum of the unit profit, the unit depreciation cost, and the unit labor cost is the unit value added. Summing value added per unit over all units sold is total value added. Total value added is equivalent to revenue less intermediate consumption. Value added is a higher portion of revenue for <b>integrated</b> <b>companies,</b> e.g., manufacturing companies, and a lower portion of revenue for less <b>integrated</b> <b>companies,</b> e.g., retail companies. Total value added is very closely approximated by compensation of employees plus earnings before taxes. The first component is a return to labor and the second component is a return to capital. In national accounts used in macroeconomics, it refers to the contribution of the factors of production, i.e., capital (e.g., land and capital goods) and labor, to raising the value of a product and corresponds to the incomes received by the owners of these factors. The national value added is shared between capital and labor (as the factors of production), and this sharing gives rise to issues of distribution.|$|E
30|$|Moreover, {{although}} the TPA is permitted in both Scenario 3 and Scenario 4, the allocations of LNG trading volume between LI and LT are significantly different. With TPA, the LNG imports of the <b>integrated</b> <b>company</b> are below 50 bcm, while the LNG import volume of LT is {{about four times}} more than the <b>integrated</b> <b>company.</b> When the two policies are both implemented simultaneously, the LNG import volume of LI is more than twice the LT’s trading volume. This dramatic difference is caused by the different market power of the leasers in the two scenarios. The total rent obtained by the leaser in Scenario 3 is 263.4 % more compared to Scenario 4.|$|R

This puts such companies at risk of underutilization of their manufacturing capacity when demand falls, which has frequently affected RFMD and impacted its profitability.

The largest independent GaAs foundry competitor, Taiwan-based WIN Semiconductor, has seen mixed results.|$|E
