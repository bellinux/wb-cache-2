500|$|Parasitoids {{are among}} the most widely used {{biological}} control agents. Commercially, {{there are two types of}} rearing systems: short-term <b>daily</b> <b>output</b> with high production of parasitoids per day, and long-term, low <b>daily</b> <b>output</b> systems. In most instances, production will need to be matched with the appropriate release dates when susceptible host species at a suitable phase of development will be available. Larger production facilities produce on a yearlong basis, whereas some facilities produce only seasonally. Rearing facilities are usually a significant distance from where the agents are to be used in the field, and transporting the parasitoids from the point of production to the point of use can pose problems. [...] Shipping conditions can be too hot, and even vibrations from planes or trucks can adversely affect parasitoids.|$|E

40|$|Summary: Frequency of semen {{collection}} {{was used to}} determine methods of stabilising epididymal sperm reserves in young boars in order to measure <b>daily</b> sperm <b>output</b> which then allows estimation of daily sperm production. By collecting from boars 3 times a week (Monday, Wednesday and Friday) most boars reached epididymal stabllisation within 4 weeks and the <b>daily</b> sperm <b>output</b> could be calculated from the following 6 collections. A more rapid method of measuring <b>daily</b> sperm <b>output</b> was achieved by collecting from boars 4 or 5 times during one day and daily for the following 4 days. <b>Daily</b> sperm <b>output</b> measured by this method was not found to be significantly different from the method requiring collections over a 6 ‐week period. Frequency of collection had a significant effect on semen characteristics. Collecting 3 times a week resulted in significantly greater volumes, sperm concentration, total number of sperm in the ejaculate and <b>daily</b> sperm <b>output</b> compared with collecting at intervals of 48 h. A collecting frequency of 48 h resulted in significantly greater volumes, sperm concentration and total number of sperm in the ejaculate but not <b>daily</b> sperm <b>output</b> when compared with collecting every 24 h.

The Jackson Mining Company operated the forge sporadically, and only until 1850. The Carp River post office closed in 1851.

The model, called AmmoBox, is tailored to depot container procedures and equipment resource constralnts. It provides data on <b>daily</b> container <b>output,</b> and container processing time. Hawthorne Army Depot is used to illustrate the process. The model approximates the depot's container capability, and the simulation results assist to determine the equipment augmentation needed to meet depot mobilization goals. Container enhancement projects are also evaluated with AmmoBox. The model-generated data reflect the impact of changes to depot procedures and infrastructure. These data on <b>daily</b> container <b>output</b> and container processing time are recommended for use in a more detailed decision support system for funding and prioritization of depot projects.

The secretion of IgA in urine by the breast fed infants was characteristic of the baby and was not related to the intake of IgA from breast milk. Lactoferrin concentrations were similar in the two groups at both ages. In addition to secretory IgA, two thirds of all samples contained proteins with alpha chain but no secretory component antigenic determinants. Breast feeding seems to increase the local production of secretory IgA into the urinary tract during early childhood, thus providing enhanced protection from infection...|$|R
