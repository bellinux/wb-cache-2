As for worldly circumstances, the most {{important}} items in a marriage contract are the persons themselves, and, as far as I am concerned, if I get a lady fair and wise I care for nothing further. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> beautiful, for all London owns it; <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> talented, for <b>I</b> have read your poetry and heard your romances; and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> politic and discreet--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't think I say it reproachfully, my child! <b>I</b> <b>know</b> it was {{not your}} fault; <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> to be pitied, and not blamed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{neither do}} I; but <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> ready {{to kick the}} trough over for them when the old man wanted us to bounce Lindau that time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{crowd at}} the depot. Did you shoot him, Mr. Fox? I can't hardly believe it true, {{although}} <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> mean enough to take my uncle's pears." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Eh--yes!" [...] and Miss Dunstable {{stopped in}} the grand path. [...] "I won't let you return with me, Mr Moffat, because <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> not coming in so soon." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'You {{were going}} to throw {{yourself}} into the river,'Ronald answered confidently; 'or at least you were debating about it in your own soul. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>were,</b> because a sure Guide tells me so.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is {{just the}} reason why you should have enjoyed it the more, instead of sitting down as you did, and being dull and unhappy. For <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> unhappy; I could see it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are going}} somewhere with Laurie, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>are.</b> <b>You</b> <b>were</b> {{whispering}} and laughing {{together on the}} sofa last night, and you stopped when I came in. Aren't you going with him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't {{understand}} you, Harry; {{why should}} there {{always be a}} quarrel between two brothers, between the husbands of two sisters? <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> mean to <b>be</b> kind, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> most kind, most generous; but why should <b>you</b> <b>be</b> so stern?' ...|$|R
60|$|Sir ANTHONY 'Tis a confounded lie!--I <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> in {{a passion}} in your heart; <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> <b>you</b> hypocritical young dog! but it won't do.|$|R
6000|$|He let poor Tink {{out of the}} drawer, and {{she flew}} about the nursery {{screaming}} with fury. 'You shouldn't say such things,' Peter retorted. 'Of course I'm very sorry, but how could <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> in the drawer?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, but {{you could}} not help that," [...] she said, piercingly. [...] "Blame can never rest upon you. You were only an--American soldier.... Oh, <b>I</b> <b>know!</b> <b>You</b> <b>were</b> magnificent.... But your duty that way is done. A higher duty awaits you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] Ruby answered, as {{she pressed}} my hand gently. [...] "It shall be settled on you, since <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> {{ready to give}} it up for my sake. And there shall be no more Aikin-Paynes {{henceforth}} and for ever." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Honest?" [...] echoed Rose, sadly, [...] "honest?--ah, Louis! <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> {{thinking}} disparagingly of Charles's convictions, {{when you}} speak so of his mother's." ...|$|R
6000|$|He let poor Tink {{out of the}} drawer, and {{she flew}} about the nursery {{screaming}} with fury. [...] "You shouldn't say such things," [...] Peter retorted. [...] "Of course I'm very sorry, but how could <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> in the drawer?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank God! I thank Him {{with all}} my heart and soul: and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> the first everywhere. Charles wrote but a word or too to Victorine, but he said you were the very first to set your foot in Saumur." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall {{think so}} if you now refuse--because of the misfortune which befell you--that which <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> most desirous of {{possessing}} before that accident. To tell you the truth, Mr. Finn, I wish Mr. Gresham had delayed his offer till the winter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{perfectly}} willing, Doctor, {{and have}} certainly {{no objection to}} trusting Isobel to your care. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> not likely to miss." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "If it wasn't illegal, I'd like to tie you and Ashe {{and that}} blackguard Adams up {{in a big}} sack, and drop you into the river. And I'd jump on the sack first. What {{do you mean by}} letting the team down like this? <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> at the bottom of it all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{the first}} place, I ask you. Secondly, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> going to dine with Frank Tregear, at the club. Thirdly, I {{want you to}} talk to me, and not to Miss Cass. And fourthly, you are an uncivil young--young,--young,--I should say cub if I dared, to tell me that you don't like dining with me any day of the week." ...|$|E
6000|$|Lucille Haldane laughed, {{and laid}} her hand lightly {{on my arm}} as the cars jolted. [...] "Then you {{certainly}} looked it; but I am not blaming you.

Why do you not at once eat them up and be done with them? Is not their flesh sweet? Is not their blood red? Are they not a dainty well fit for the banquet of Tu-Kila-Kila?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Have {{you read}} it, Mr. Boldwood?" [...] said Gabriel; [...] "if not, {{you had better}} do so. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> {{interested}} in Fanny Robin." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Thomas, I {{have some}} {{business}} {{to attend to}} to-night, {{in which you can}} help me if <b>you</b> choose. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> a good mechanic.' ...|$|R
