Heat induced enzymatic inactivation is {{an efficient way to}} preserve proteins and their modifications in biological samples but RNA quality, as measured by RIN value, has been a concern in such samples. Here, we investigate the effect of heat stabilization compared with standard snap freezing on RNA quality using two RNA extraction protocols, QiaZol with and without urea pre-solubilization, and two RNA quality measurements: RIN value, as defined by the Agilent Bioanalyzer, and an alternative qPCR based method. DNA extraction from <b>heat</b> <b>stabilized</b> brain samples was also examined. The snap frozen samples had RIN values about 1 unit higher than <b>heat</b> <b>stabilized</b> samples for the direct QiaZol extraction but equal with stabilized samples using urea pre-solubilization. qPCR based RNA quality measurement showed no difference in quality between snap frozen and heat inactivated samples. The probable explanation for this discrepancy is that the RIN value is an indirect measure based on rRNA, while the qPCR score is based on actual measurement of mRNA quality. The DNA yield from <b>heat</b> <b>stabilized</b> brain tissue samples was significantly increased, compared to the snap frozen tissue, without any effects on purity or quality. Hence, heat stabilization of tissues opens up the possibility for a two step preservation protocol, where proteins and their modifications can be preserved in the first heat based step, while in a second step, using standard RNA preservation strategies, mRNA be preserved. This collection strategy will enable biobanking of samples where the ultimate analysis is not determined without loss of sample quality...|$|E

Here we present different approaches to fabricate bottom-gate field-effect transistors on 25 μm <b>heat</b> <b>stabilized</b> polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) foil using photolithography and solution processing. The flexibility and dimensional instability of the substrate constituted the main challenge during manufacturing. We developed a novel method to handle the foils during processing by reversibly attaching them onto 6 inch Si wafers. The so-called foil-on-carrier assembly showed excellent flatness (about 1 μm) and good dimensional stability and tolerance towards the different processing steps up to 160 °C. Transistors were made either using an organic polymer or an inorganic oxide as gate dielectric material. Source and drain gold electrodes were patterned using standard photoresist patterning followed by wet etching, or by lift-off. The feature sizes in the transistors were downsized from 5 μm to sub-micrometer to improve the performance. In order to achieve structures with high resolution, all functional layers were patterned using a commercial wafer stepper (PAS 5500 / 100 D). The two dielectric materials used and the two ways of making the source-drain resulted in four different metal-insulator-metal (MIM) stacks.
