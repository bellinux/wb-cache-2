40|$|Twenty {{years of}} {{transformation}} processes involved {{a change of}} location for economic activities in post-communist Czech cities. Some sites lost their functional use while others were redeveloped or newly developed. Site-specific factors were crucially important for particular sites to succeed. Therefore, this paper explores associations between selected theoretically substantiated site-specific factors and four types of <b>development</b> <b>sites,</b> namely brown fields, stable sites, redeveloped sites and newly developed greenfield sites, in the Ostrava metropolitan area in the late 2000 s. The results indicate that ownership structure, transport accessibility and threat of environmental burden were statistically significant discriminating factors between the four types of <b>development</b> <b>sites.</b> Further insights into the associations were gained from decision rules induced by using the rough-set method. Typical combinations of site-specific factors that classified sites {{as one of the}} four types of <b>development</b> <b>sites</b> were revealed, creating a typology of <b>development</b> <b>sites</b> in the model area.

25|$|In 2009, a four-page {{regional}} press wraparound {{included several}} maps {{and images of}} a proposed development in New Barnet, and described the benefits the development would bring to the local area. The advert included a <b>development</b> <b>site</b> plan and map, which marked out the proposed Asda store, the existing Sainsbury store and the sites of the proposed, approved and existing Tesco stores. Because {{it was not clear}} that the marked-out area relating to the Asda store was for only the store floorspace, whereas the marked-out area relating to the Sainsburys store included store floorspace and additional buildings, and the marked-out area relating to the proposed Tesco area was not based on an approved plan, the ASA concluded the advertisement was misleading.|$|E

500|$|More {{than any}} other Midwestern state, Minnesota {{attracted}} engineers, especially in the computer industry, and became a center of technology after the war. [...] Engineering Research Associates was formed in 1946 to develop computers for the intelligence community. [...] It soon merged with Remington Rand, and later became Sperry Rand. [...] William Norris left Sperry in 1957 to form Control Data Corporation (CDC). [...] Cray Research was formed when Seymour Cray left CDC to form his own company. [...] Medical device maker Medtronic also was founded in the Twin Cities in 1949. Honeywell was a national player as well, until 1999 when it was bought out and its headquarters moved to New Jersey. [...] National firms, such as International Business Machines, operated large branch offices. IBM also operated a substantial manufacturing and <b>development</b> <b>site</b> in Rochester starting in 1956. [...] State government and powerful politicians such as Hubert Humphrey maintained a favorable climate. The University of Minnesota trained many computer specialists who decided {{to stay in the}} Minnesota rather than move to sunny California. [...] By the 1960s Minnesota thus became a successful precursor to Route 128 around Boston and Silicon Valley.|$|E
500|$|The Greater Manchester Film Festival was {{launched}} in 2012. It is an international film festival designed to capitalise on Greater Manchester's [...] "huge strengths in film and television, along with its growing media presence". MediaCityUK, a host venue of the Greater Manchester Film Festival, is a [...] mixed-use property <b>development</b> <b>site</b> at Salford Quays; its principal tenants are mass media organisations such as ITV Granada and the BBC. One of Greater Manchester's most lucrative and acclaimed television exports is Coronation Street, which is a televised soap opera set in Weatherfield, a fictional borough of Greater Manchester, inspired by life in Salford. Created by Tony Warren, Coronation Street was first broadcast on 9 December 1960, making it the world's longest-running TV soap opera in production. It has been filmed in Manchester at Granada Studios since its inception, but filming is now done at a new set at MediaCityUK. Launched in 2004 by the Guardian Media Group, Channel M is a television station that broadcast local news and content about Greater Manchester. It effectively closed in 2010.
