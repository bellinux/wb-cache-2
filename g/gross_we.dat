The idealness of the sections, especially horizontal section, was also analyzed. RESULTS: Out of the 228 cases, 44 scalp biopsies were classified histologically as cicatricial alopecias and the remaining 162 as noncicatricial alopecia. 22 cases were inconclusive owing to erroneous <b>grossing.</b> <b>We</b> found horizontal sections to be more useful in cases of noncicatricial alopecias, whereas vertical sections proved superior in cicatricial alopecias.

The sum is modded out by all diffeomorphisms on the world-sheet. This leaves a sum over disconnected classes of maps. We prove that the free energy gives a consistent result for all smooth maps of the torus into the torus which cover the target space $p$ times, where $p$ is prime, and conjecture that {{this is true for}} all coverings. Each class can also contain integrations over the positions of branch points and small handles which act as ``moduli'' on the surface.

40|$|In {{this work}} we study {{families}} of quadratic twists of abelian varieties with complex multiplication {{by means of}} the associated Hecke characters, focusing upon the special cases of elliptic curves and their Weil restrictions. Following <b>Gross,</b> <b>we</b> say that an elliptic curve E/F with complex multiplication is a Q-curve if it is isogenous to all its Galois conjugates over F. The Hecke character of an abelian variety A/F is an isogeny invariant and the Galois action is such that A is isogenous to its Galois conjugate A σ if and only if the corresponding Hecke character is fixed by σ. The quadratic twist of A by an extension L/F corresponds to multiplication of the associated Hecke characters. This leads us to investigate the Galois groups of families of quadratic extensions L/F with restricted ramification which are normal over a given subfield k of F.
