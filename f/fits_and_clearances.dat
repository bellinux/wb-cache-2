40|$|LecturePg. 129 - 143 From {{time to time}} {{vibration}} probes pick up high vibration at the coupling location on output shafts. Many times the coupling will then be removed {{and sent to the}} shop or to the manufacturer for inspection, repair, and rebalancing. In many of these cases, especially with dry couplings, however, the root cause is elsewhere [1]. The coupling vibration-and sometimes damage can be a symptom of other problems in the train. What these vibrations mean is addressed as related to the coupling and vibration signature. Is it the coupling, or is the rotor out of balance? Or, is there a problem with the fit between the two? What else could be wrong? Field cases are presented where suspected coupling problems turned out to be something entirely different. In one case, an axially vibrating coupling {{turned out to be the}} result of a resonance condition in the feedback loop in the controller of a variable frequency motor. This resonance caused a torsional vibration that showed up axially in the coupling. In another case, three different high performance disc and two different high performance gear couplings were installed before a vibration problem was traced to pipe strain induced misalignment. Other cases are presented, including some where the coupling actually was the problem. Moreover, coupling balancing is covered, especially as it relates to the overall rotor balance condition. How can you be assured that a coupling balanced at the factory will still be in balance when installed in the field? What is the importance of balancing tolerances and how significant are they when referenced to the out of balance due to <b>fits</b> <b>and</b> <b>clearances?</b> It is shown that the setup indication tolerances are a more significant contributor to overall coupling balance than actual balance machine unbalance tolerances. All of the cases presented involve dry couplings-ones that don't have lubricated gear teeth. On almost all new high performance turbomachinery applications, dry couplings have replaced the gear type, and one of the reasons for this is the general lack of coupling problems associated with the dry couplings (except for an occasional wind age problem). There are usually no wearing parts, and there are less clearances (like in gear tooth mesh), which can lead to significant unbalance and vibration in sensitive applications...|$|E

The analytical solutions for load-carrying capacity, recess pressure, flow rate, frictional torque, power loss and stiffness are derived {{for both the}} <b>fitted</b> <b>and</b> <b>clearance</b> type bearings with a capillary or an orifice restrictor. Their power loss and stiffness {{as a function of}} the equivalent radius of loads and the size of restrictors are illustrated. The optimum size of their restrictors is obtained. The effects of the seat angles, clearance-ratio and operating conditions on the bearing characteristics and the optimum size based on the minimum power loss are clarified...|$|R

A literature review was conducted on previous applications using airborne multispectral imaging for plant biosecurity purposes. A ready built platform was purchased and modified in order to <b>fit</b> <b>and</b> provide suitable <b>clearance</b> for a Tetracam Mini-MCA multispectral camera. The appropriate risk management documents were developed allowing the platform and the multi-spectral camera to be tested extensively. However, due to technical difficulties with the platform the Mini- MCA was not mounted to the platform. Once a suitable platform is developed, future extensions can be conducted into the suitability of the Mini-MCA for airborne surveillance of Australian crops...|$|R
40|$|This Brief {{describes}} {{a method of}} machining and assembly when the depth of corrugations far exceeds the width and conventional machining is not practical. The horn is divided into easily machined, individual rings with shoulders to control the depth. In this specific instance, each of the corrugations is identical in profile, and only differs in diameter and outer profile. The horn is segmented into rings that are cut with an interference fit (zero clearance with all machining errors biased toward contact). The interference faces can be cut with a reverse taper to increase the holding strength of the joint. The taper is a compromise between the interference <b>fit</b> <b>and</b> the <b>clearance</b> of the two faces during assembly. Each internal ring is dipped in liquid nitrogen, then nested in the previous, larger ring. The ring is rotated in the nest until {{the temperature of the}} two parts equalizes and the pieces lock together. The resulting assay is stable, strong, and has an internal finish that cannot be achieved through other methods...|$|R
40|$|Designing space {{suits and}} {{vehicles}} for the diverse human population present unique {{challenges for the}} methods of traditional anthropometry. Space suits are bulky and allow the operator to shift position within the suit and inhibit the ability to identify body landmarks. Limited suit sizing options also cause variability in <b>fit</b> <b>and</b> performance between similarly sized individuals. Space vehicles are restrictive in volume in both the <b>fit</b> <b>and</b> the ability to collect data. NASA's Anthropometric and Biomechanics Facility (ABF) has utilized 3 D scanning to shift from traditional linear anthropometry to explore and examine volumetric capabilities to provide anthropometric solutions for design. Overall, the key goals are to improve the human-system performance and develop new processes {{to aid in the}} design and evaluation of space systems. Four case studies are presented that illustrate the shift from purely linear analyses to an augmented volumetric toolset to predict and analyze the human within the space suit and vehicle. The first case study involves the calculation of maximal head volume to estimate total free volume in the helmet for proper air exchange. Traditional linear measurements resulted in an inaccurate representation of the head shape, yet limited data exists for the determination of a large head volume. Steps were first taken to identify and classify a maximum head volume and the resulting comparisons to the estimate are presented in this paper. This study illustrates the gap between linear components of anthropometry and the need for overall volume metrics in order to provide solutions. A second case study examines the overlay of the space suit scans and components onto scanned individuals to quantify <b>fit</b> <b>and</b> <b>clearance</b> to aid in sizing the suit to the individual. Restrictions in space suit size availability present unique challenges to optimally fit the individual within a limited sizing range while maintaining performance. Quantification of the <b>clearance</b> <b>and</b> <b>fit</b> between similarly sized individuals is critical in providing a greater understanding of the human body's function within the suit. The third case study presented in this paper explores the development of a conformal seat pan using scanning techniques, and details the challenges of volumetric analyses that were overcome in order to develop a universal seat pan that can be utilized across the entire user population. The final case study explores expanding volumetric capabilities through generation of boundary manikins. Boundary manikins are representative individuals from the population of interest that represent the extremes of the population spectrum. The ABF developed a technique to take three-dimensional scans of individuals and manipulate the scans to reflect the boundary manikins' anthropometry. In essence, this process generates a representative three-dimensional scan of an individual from anthropometry, using another individual's scanned image. The results from this process can be used in design process modeling and initial suit sizing work as a three dimensional, realistic example of individuals from the population, maintaining the variability between and correlation to the relevant dimensions of interest...|$|R
5000|$|Respirators {{are another}} form of PPE. Respirator filters with a NIOSH air {{filtration}} rating of N95 or P100 {{have been shown to}} be effective at capturing nanoparticles, although leakage between the respirator seal and the skin may be more significant, especially with half-mask respirators. Surgical masks are not effective against nanomaterials. Smaller nanoparticles of size 4-20 nm are captured more efficiently by filters than larger ones of size 30-100 nm, because Brownian motion results in the smaller particles being more likely to contact a filter fiber. [...] In the United States, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration requires <b>fit</b> testing <b>and</b> medical <b>clearance</b> for use of respirators, and the Environmental Protection Agency requires the use of full face respirators with N100 filters for multi-walled carbon nanotubes not embedded in a solid matrix, if exposure is not otherwise controlled.|$|R

5000|$|During {{the early}} {{development}} accuracy experts noted that perfectly concentric {{thickness of the}} cartridge neck were beneficial in lining up bullet to the bore - a feature mostly lacking in commercially available brass of the time. Most 6PPC chamber reamers are ground with a tight neck section that requires removing some case neck material ("turning the necks") to create a cartridge with a concentric <b>fit</b> <b>and</b> consistent neck-to-chamber <b>clearances</b> which contribute to the 6PPCs accuracy. While the SAAMI specification for neck thickness in a 6mm cartridge is usually [...]272 inches, {{it is common to}} see 6PPCs with [...]262, [...]268, or [...]269 custom neck sizes, hence modern factory ammunition is not commonly produced for the 6PPC as it would be dangerous to shoot in these custom chambers. To help clarify this, factory guns and ammunition are usually specified as the [...] "6PPC-USA" [...] cartridge which has a CIP/SAAMI specification. To the Note that a neck expanded, [...] "unturned" [...] (thickness of neck reduced) and loaded 220 Russian case neck will almost always be larger in diameter than the 6PPC rifle's chamber neck; if so, Method One does not apply—see Method Two. It is important to understand the characteristics of one's chamber before starting. Use of a [...] "chamber cast" [...] using Brownell's CERROSAFE® CHAMBER CASTING ALLOY or equivalent {{is a good way to}} accomplish this. Alternatively, one can use a manufacturer's print of the chamber (usually very hard to obtain, except for European manufacturers) or a print of the reamer used to cut the rifle chamber.|$|R

40|$|In all {{biological}} systems, protein {{amount is}} a function of the rate of production <b>and</b> <b>clearance.</b> The speed of a response to a disturbance in protein homeostasis is determined by turnover rate. Quantifying alterations in protein synthesis <b>and</b> <b>clearance</b> rates is vital to understanding disease pathogenesis (e. g., aging, inflammation). No methods currently exist for quantifying production <b>and</b> <b>clearance</b> rates of low-abundance (femtomole) proteins in vivo. We describe a novel, mass spectrometry–based method for quantitating low-abundance protein synthesis <b>and</b> <b>clearance</b> rates in vitro and in vivo in animals and humans. The utility of this method is demonstrated with amyloid-β (Aβ), an important low-abundance protein involved in Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis. We used in vivo stable isotope labeling, immunoprecipitation of Aβ from cerebrospinal fluid, and quantitative liquid chromatography electrospray-ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-tandem MS) to quantify human Aβ protein production <b>and</b> <b>clearance</b> rates. The method is sensitive and specific for stable isotope-labeled amino acid incorporation into CNS Aβ (± 1 % accuracy). This in vivo method can be used to identify pathophysiologic changes in protein metabolism and may serve as a biomarker for monitoring disease risk, progression, or response to novel therapeutic agents. The technique is adaptable to other macromolecules, such as carbohydrates or lipids...|$|R
