The World Bank's India program is interested in these developments and is considering how it should support the Government of India (GoI) objectives in these governance reforms. A wide range of support mechanisms is possible, including lending and analytical work, and focusing on national- or state-level activities and direct support for local governments or actions through specific sectors, such as the health sector. The study focused on five functional areas of decisions about health systems, strategic and operational planning, budgeting, <b>human</b> <b>resources,</b> <b>service</b> organization or delivery, and monitoring and evaluation. Prior studies in other countries and Indian states had found that decentralization of decisions, capacities and accountability varied considerably among these functional areas.

40|$|Background: Mental {{health system}} reform is {{urgently}} needed in Gaza {{to respond to}} increasing mental health consequences of conflict. Evidence from mental health systems {{research is needed to}} inform decision-making. We aimed to provide new knowledge on current mental health policy and legislation, and services and resource use, in Gaza to identify quality gaps and areas for urgent intervention. Methods: As part of a mixed methods study, we used the World Health Organization’s Assessment Instrument for Mental Health Systems Version 2 · 2 to collect data on mental health services and resources. Data collection was carried out in 2011, based on the year 2010. Results: Gaza’s mental health policy suggests some positive steps toward reform such as supporting deinstitutionalisation of mental health services. The {{decrease in the number of}} beds in the psychiatric hospital and the progressive transition of mental healthcare toward more community based care are indicative of deinstitutionalisation. However, mental health legislation in support of deinstitutionalisation in Gaza is lacking. The integration of mental health into primary healthcare and general hospitals has not been fully achieved. Mental health in Gaza is underfunded, human rights protection of service users is absent, and <b>human</b> <b>resources,</b> <b>service</b> user advocacy, and mental health training are limited. Conclusion: Priority needs to be given to human rights protection, mental health training, and investment in human and organisational resources. Legislation is needed to support policy and plan development. The ongoing political conflict and expected increase in need for mental health services demonstrates an urgent response is necessary...|$|E
