25|$|Laws {{regulating}} the discharge {{and treatment of}} sewage have led to dramatic nutrient reductions to surrounding ecosystems, but it is generally agreed that a policy regulating agricultural use of fertilizer and animal waste must be imposed. In Japan the amount of nitrogen produced by livestock is adequate to serve the fertilizer needs for the agriculture industry. Thus, it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>unreasonable</b> to command livestock owners to clean up animal waste—which when left stagnant will leach into ground water.|$|E
25|$|It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>unreasonable</b> {{but also}} not {{necessary}} to conclude that Marcellus was a practicing physician. In his dissertation, the intellectual historian of magic and medicine Lynn Thorndike pronounced him the “court physician” of Theodosius I, but the evidence is thin: Libanius, if referring to this Marcellus, praises his ability to cure a headache. The prevailing view is that Marcellus should be categorized as a medical writer and not a physician. A translator of the medical writings of Isidore of Seville characterizes Marcellus as a “medical amateur” and dismisses the De medicamentis as “nothing {{more than the usual}} ancient home remedies,” and the historian of botany Ernst Meyer seems to have considered him a dilettante.|$|E
500|$|While {{there is}} no set {{definition}} of what is or <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>unreasonable,</b> factors that {{are taken into account}} include any [...] "abnormal sensitivity" [...] of the claimant, the nature of the locality where the nuisance took place, the time and duration of the interference and the conduct of the defendant. [...] "Abnormal sensitivity" [...] is where the claimant's damaged property is particularly sensitive to damage by the defendant's actions. In Robinson v Kilvert, it was established that if the action of the defendant would not have caused damage were it not for this abnormal sensitivity, the defendant is not liable. However, if the damage was caused to abnormally sensitive property but would also have damaged non-sensitive property, the defendant is liable, as in McKinnon Industries v Walker. This was because it infringed on the [...] "right to ordinary enjoyment"; as a result, the claimant could claim for his more sensitive activities as well.|$|E

2500|$|To {{gain some}} {{geometric}} insights and clarification, {{we will start}} {{with a population of}} three values, x1, x2, x3. This defines a point P = (x1, x2, x3) in R3.

2500|$|Nonetheless, it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>unreasonable</b> {{to suggest}} that the {{generation}} who followed the preceptors of the Revolution succeeded partly because they could formulate straightforward responses to Marxist economic theory. The most famous of these was that of Böhm-Bawerk, Zum Abschluss des Marxschen Systems (1896),"On the Closure of the Marxist System"], Staatswiss. Arbeiten. Festgabe für K. Knies (1896). but the first was Wicksteed's [...] "The Marxian Theory of Value. Das Kapital: a criticism" [...] (1884, followed by [...] "The Jevonian criticism of Marx: a rejoinder" [...] in 1885). Initially {{there were only a few}} Marxist responses to marginalism, of which the most famous were Rudolf Hilferding's Böhm-Bawerks Marx-Kritik (1904) and Politicheskoy ekonomni rante (1914) by Никола́й Ива́нович Буха́рин (Nikolai Bukharin). However, over the course of the 20th century a considerable literature developed on the conflict between marginalism and the labour theory of value, with the work of the neo-Ricardian economist Piero Sraffa providing an important critique of marginalism.|$|E

2500|$|Liston in {{his studies}} {{concluded}} to much lower estimates. Documentation of historical finds and the excavation of [...] "Ariston", {{the most complete}} specimen ever from the Star Pit near Whittlesey, Peterborough, support Woodward's figures of between 9 and 10 metres (29.5 and 33 feet). With [...] "Ariston" [...] the pectoral fins are 1005 millimetres (39.6 inches) apart, indicating a narrow body of no excessive size, {{even though it was}} initially thought to have been 22 metres (72 feet) long. In 2007 Liston stated that most specimens indicated lengths between 7 and 12 metres (23 and 39 feet). A linear extrapolation from the gill basket would be flawed because the gills grow disproportionally in size, having to increase their surface allometrically to ensure the oxygen supply of a body increasing in volume to the third power. The growth ring structures within the remains of Leedsichthys have indicated that it would have taken 21 to 25 years to reach these lengths, and isolated elements from other specimens showed that a maximum size of just over [...] <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>unreasonable.</b> In 2013 a new study by Liston found most specimens to be between 17 and 31 years old.

2500|$|Oral {{tradition}} in the Spokane area may give an entirely different account of this child. This tradition holds that, {{in the fall of}} 1853, John Mullan met and married Mary Ann Finley (or [...] "Finlay"), granddaughter of Jaco Finlay. Her age is unclear; she was born in either 1834 or 1836, making her either 19 or 17 years of age {{at the time of her}} marriage. She was one-half Native American. On June 9, 1855, Mary Ann died giving birth to a son, whom she named Peter Mullan. Historian Glen Adams argues that Peter Mullan was not John Mullan's child. Rather, a full-blood Native American probably impregnated Mary Ann, and that Peter is the boy whom John Mullan raised for a time. (Whether there was a John Mullan III in addition to Peter Mullan is not resolved by Adams.) Mullan biographers Louis C. Coleman and Leo Rieman examined much of the same evidence, and came to the same conclusions as Adams. Historian Keith Petersen, however, argues that it is plausible that Mullan fathered Peter Mullan. He argues that there is confusion over whether the mother was Mary Ann Finley or another woman, Rose Laurant. Laurant was Salish, and she may have lived with the Bitterroot Salish in 1853 when John Mullan was in the same area. Limited evidence in the oral tradition confuses Finley with Laurant, Petersen believes, and he concludes (a) that Peter Mullan is not the same person as John Mullan III, and (b) it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>unreasonable</b> to believe that Peter Mullan was John Mullan's biological son.|$|E
