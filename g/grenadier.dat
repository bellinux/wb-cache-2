5|$|In {{the period}} from late 1944, more Eastern European {{formations}} were hurriedly raised by Berger's recruiters or converted from existing smaller units. These included the 25th Waffen <b>Grenadier</b> Division of the SS Hunyadi (1st Hungarian), 26th Waffen <b>Grenadier</b> Division of the SS (2nd Hungarian), 31st SS Volunteer <b>Grenadier</b> Division, {{and a number of}} smaller formations of brigade and regimental size. Several Cossack units were also transferred from the Wehrmacht. Even the Sonderkommando Dirlewanger was increased in size, taking on Russian prisoners of war to boost its numbers.|$|E
5|$|The next German {{attack was}} in force, using the 2nd Battalion 857th <b>Grenadier</b> Regiment, the 1st and 2nd Battalion's 858th <b>Grenadier</b> Regiment and several {{companies}} of the 744th <b>Grenadier</b> Regiment with tank and armoured car support. They attempted {{to force a}} gap in the British lines between the commandos and the 3rd Parachute Brigade to reach Ranville.|$|E
5|$|Browning was {{promoted}} to lieutenant-colonel on 1 February 1936, and was appointed commanding officer of the 2nd Battalion, <b>Grenadier</b> Guards. The battalion was deployed to Egypt in 1936 and returned in December 1937. His term as commander ended on 1 August 1939; he {{was removed from the}} <b>Grenadier</b> Guards' regimental list but remained on full pay. On 1 September, he {{was promoted}} to colonel, with his seniority backdated to 1 February 1939, and became Commandant of the Small Arms School.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{reorganisation}} of {{the army}} the 64th, like most regiments, found itself without its flank (<b>grenadier</b> and light infantry) companies which had been detached to form part of the 2nd <b>Grenadier</b> and 2nd Light Infantry Battalions respectively. All three battalions {{took part in the}} 1776 capture of New York and the 64th was engaged in the later Battle of Ridgefield.|$|E
5|$|Henry George Conroy (4 June 1817 – 5 October 1890), {{served with}} the <b>Grenadier</b> Guards, aide-de-camp to the {{commander}} of the forces in Ireland.|$|E
5|$|November 1779 {{saw all the}} {{companies}} of the regiment being transferred to the Southern theatre of operations. In April 1780 the 64th {{was part of the}} covering force besieging Charleston, while the <b>grenadier</b> and light companies formed part of the main siege force. After the capture of Charleston, the <b>grenadier</b> and light companies were withdrawn to New York and as Major-General Cornwallis began to advance on Virginia, the 64th remained in Carolina as guard troops. In 1781 the 64th were involved in the Battle of Eutaw Springs and a year later in one of the last actions of the war, the Battle of the Combahee River. The <b>grenadier</b> company was reunited with the 64th but the light company was among the units that surrendered with Cornwallis at Yorktown.|$|E
5|$|First Column, {{commanded}} by General of Brigade Prince Pyotr Ivanovich Bagration, included three battalions of infantry, three <b>grenadier</b> battalions, and three Jäger battalions, ten squadrons of Hussars.|$|E
5|$|In autumn 1944 the {{division}} absorbed the 2nd Jäger Brigade of the Croatian Home Guard, which created a third infantry regiment, the 385th (Croatian) <b>Grenadier</b> Regiment.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, {{numerous}} companies {{began to}} sell miniature figures specifically for Dungeons & Dragons and similar games. Licensed miniature manufacturers who produced official figures include <b>Grenadier</b> Miniatures (1980–1983), Citadel Miniatures (1984–1986), Ral Partha, and TSR itself. Most of these miniatures used the 25mm scale.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the troops}} {{assigned}} to the expedition, 350 were from <b>grenadier</b> companies drawn from the 4th (King's Own), 5th, 10th, 18th (Royal Irish), 23rd, 38th, 43rd, 47th, 52nd and 59th Regiments of Foot, and the 1st Battalion of His Majesty's Marine Forces. Protecting the <b>grenadier</b> companies were about 320 light infantry from the 4th, 5th, 10th, 23rd, 38th, 43rd, 47th, 52nd, and 59th Regiments, and the 1st Battalion of the Marines. Each company had its own lieutenant, {{but the majority of}} the captains commanding them were volunteers attached to them at the last minute, drawn from all the regiments stationed in Boston. This lack of familiarity between commander and company would cause problems during the battle.|$|E
5|$|The British regulars, around 700 {{infantry}}, {{were drawn}} from 11 of Gage's 13 occupying infantry regiments. Major Pitcairn commanded ten elite light infantry companies, and Lieutenant Colonel Benjamin Bernard commanded 11 <b>grenadier</b> companies, under the overall command of Lieutenant Colonel Smith.|$|E
5|$|The {{climax of}} the Battle of Tannenberg Line was the Soviet attack of 29 July. The shock units {{suppressed}} the German resistance on the Orphanage Hill, while the Soviet main forces suffered heavy casualties in the subsequent assault at the <b>Grenadier</b> Hill. The Soviet tanks encircled it and the Tower Hill, the westernmost one. Steiner, {{the commander of the}} III SS Panzer Corps, sent out the remaining seven tanks, which hit the surprised Soviet armour and forced them back. This enabled an improvised battle group led by Hauptsturmführer Paul Maitla to launch a counterattack which recaptured the <b>Grenadier</b> Hill. Of the 136,830 Soviets initiating the offensive on 25 July, a few thousand had remained fit for combat by 1 August. The Soviet tank regiments had been demolished.|$|E
5|$|Various Estonian troops, {{which used}} {{men who had}} deserted from the 20th Waffen <b>Grenadier</b> Division of the SS (1st Estonian), Omakaitse militia, border defence and {{auxiliary}} police battalions, had no general planning. However, their aim was to defend the independence of Estonia.|$|E
5|$|Before either Baltic legion could {{complete}} training, {{these developments}} were overtaken by heavy casualties {{suffered by the}} West European legions on the Eastern Front, and like the West European legions, {{it was decided to}} combine the Baltic legions into larger formations. This resulted in the Estnische SS-Freiwilligen Brigade, consisting of the Estonian Legion and elements of the 1st SS Infantry Brigade, and the Lettische SS-Freiwilligen Brigade, formed around the Latvian Legion and parts of the 2nd SS Infantry Brigade. The origins of many of the men of the two SS infantry brigades was Reich German or Volksdeutsche, so these two formations were never purely Baltic. Not long after the two new volunteer brigades had been formed and committed to battle, they were upgraded to divisional status, and a third Baltic division was authorised, using the manpower of the Latvian security battalions. To man and maintain these three new divisions, Himmler ordered the conscription of Estonian and Latvian men, and made all former Estonian Army officers and non-commissioned officers liable for service. By 1944, the Waffen-SS included the three divisions, namely; the 15th Waffen <b>Grenadier</b> Division of the SS (1st Latvian), the 19th Waffen <b>Grenadier</b> Division of the SS (2nd Latvian), and the 20th Waffen <b>Grenadier</b> Division of the SS (1st Estonian). The two Latvian divisions were later combined into the VI SS Army Corps (Latvian), and all three divisions fought the Soviet Red Army in defence of their homelands during 1944, and were encircled there or destroyed in subsequent fighting elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|By now the German 346th Infantry Division {{had reached}} the area from its base at Le Havre. Their first attack, by the 744th <b>Grenadier</b> Regiment, was against the 1stSpecial Service Brigade. Attacking in strength, they were near to {{breaking}} through the line when No. 3 Commando counter-attacked and drove them back.|$|E
5|$|During the interwar period, Piron {{returned}} to his studies at the academy. He remained in the Belgian Army, serving in {{the headquarters of the}} 2ndArmy Corps and later in the 1st <b>Grenadier</b> Regiment. Rising through the ranks to major, he served with the Regiment of Frontier Cyclists and later at the headquarters of the 5th Army Corps at the outbreak of the Phoney War.|$|E
5|$|Fleming's {{elder brother}} Peter (1907–1971) became a travel writer and married actress Celia Johnson. Peter {{served with the}} <b>Grenadier</b> Guards during the Second World War, was later {{commissioned}} under Colin Gubbins to help establish the Auxiliary Units, and became involved in behind-the-lines operations in Norway and Greece during the war.|$|E
5|$|The Duke of York's {{passion for}} all things naval and {{military}} rubbed off on young Churchill. Often accompanying the Duke inspecting the troops in the royal parks, {{it was not long}} before the boy had set his heart on becoming a soldier himself. On 14 September 1667 (O.S.), he obtained a commission as Ensign in the King's Own Company in the 1st Guards, later to become the <b>Grenadier</b> Guards.|$|E
5|$|The {{arrival of}} the Poles {{relieved}} {{the pressure on the}} British as the Germans were forced to send more forces south of the Rhine. Fearing an attack on {{the southern end of the}} road bridge or the Nijmegen road, a battalion of the 34th SS Volunteer <b>Grenadier</b> Division Landstorm Nederland, Machine Gun Battalion 47 and other Kampfgruppes headed across the river overnight.|$|E
5|$|The regulars found {{themselves}} {{trapped in a}} situation where they were both outnumbered and outmaneuvered. Lacking effective leadership and terrified at the superior numbers of the enemy, with their spirit broken, and likely not having experienced combat before, they abandoned their wounded, and fled to the safety of the approaching <b>grenadier</b> companies coming from the town center, isolating Captain Parsons and the companies searching for arms at Barrett's Farm.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{most of the}} regiment's life, the 52nd Foot wore {{traditional}} British Army red coats, with buff facings. During the American wars, {{the coat}} was long tailed, with buff facings, buff waistcoat and breeches. The <b>grenadier</b> company wore a bearskin hat with the King's Crest and the regimental number. Officers wore crimson sash, gorget and silver epaulettes.|$|E
5|$|A {{reconnaissance}} patrol from the 13th Parachute Battalion reported a large gathering of Germans in Bréville and suspected an attack was imminent. At 08:00 a massive artillery and mortar bombardment fell along the 1st Special Service Brigade lines, while the 857th <b>Grenadier</b> Regiment, which had {{gathered in the}} village, attacked No. 6 Commando. By 10:30, the attack on No. 6 Commando had been driven back, but to their left at Hauger No.4 Commandos had to win a hand-to-hand fight before the Germans withdrew. Twice more during the day the commandos were attacked unsuccessfully, from Sallenelles {{in the north and}} again from Bréville.|$|E
5|$|As Strachwitz had predicted, {{the rifle}} corps counterattacked on the {{following}} day. It was repelled by the 23rd East Prussian <b>Grenadier</b> Regiment which inflicted heavy casualties on the Soviets. Two small groups of tanks broke through {{the lines of the}} rifle corps on 28 March in several places, splitting the bridgehead in two. Fierce air combat followed, with 41 German dive bombers shot down. The west half of the bridgehead was destroyed by 31 March, with an estimated 6,000 Soviet casualties.|$|E
5|$|Between November 2009 and the British general {{election}} in May 2010, Dannatt {{served as a}} defence adviser to Conservative Party leader David Cameron. Dannatt resigned when Cameron's party formed a coalition government with the Liberal Democrats after the election produced a hung parliament, arguing that the Prime Minister should rely primarily {{on the advice of}} the incumbent service chiefs. Dannatt published an autobiography in 2010 and continues to be involved with a number of charities and organisations related to the armed forces. He is married with four children, one of whom served as an officer in the <b>Grenadier</b> Guards.|$|E
5|$|By 07:30, Davout {{had gained}} control of the three flèches. Prince Bagration quickly led a counterattack that threw the French out of the positions, only to have Marshal Michel Ney lead a charge by the 24thRegiment that retook them. Although not enamoured of Barclay, Bagration turned to him for aid, {{ignoring}} Kutuzov altogether; Barclay, to his credit, responded quickly, sending three guard regiments, eight <b>grenadier</b> battalions, and twenty-four 12-pounder cannon at their best pace to bolster Semyаnovskaya. Colonel Toll and Kutuzov moved the Guard Reserve units forward as early as 09:00 hours.|$|E
5|$|Dannatt met his wife, Philippa ("Pippa"; née Gurney) {{during his}} first year at Durham University in 1973. The couple became engaged, and married in March 1977, after which Pippa {{accompanied}} Dannatt on his return to Berlin. They had four children—three boys and one girl. Bertie, their second son, served with the <b>Grenadier</b> Guards—Pippa's father's regiment—in Iraq and Afghanistan, earning a mention in despatches and reaching the rank of captain before leaving the Army in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Educated at Eton College {{and then}} at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, Browning was {{commissioned}} as a second lieutenant into the <b>Grenadier</b> Guards in 1915. During the First World War, he fought on the Western Front, and was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for conspicuous gallantry during the Battle of Cambrai in November 1917. In September 1918, he became aide de camp to General Sir Henry Rawlinson. After the war, he competed in the bobsleigh at the 1928 Winter Olympics in St. Moritz, Switzerland, in which his team finished tenth. He married Daphne du Maurier in July 1932.|$|E
5|$|Elements of the {{division}} fought briefly against Soviet forces in southern Hungary in early October 1944 alongside the 31st SS Volunteer <b>Grenadier</b> Division. They were soon disengaged from the front line in Hungary and had begun a move to the German puppet state, the Independent State of Croatia, to join the 13th SS Division when the Bosnian Muslim soldiers of the Kama division mutinied on 17 October 1944. The cadre quickly regained control, but the mutiny resulted in {{the division}} being formally dissolved on 31 October 1944.|$|E
5|$|He {{was awarded}} the French Croix de Guerre on 14 December 1917, and {{mentioned}} in despatches on 23 May 1918. In September 1918, Browning became aide de camp to General Sir Henry Rawlinson, commander of the British Fourth Army, after which {{he returned to his}} regiment. He was promoted to the temporary rank of captain, and appointed adjutant of the 1st Battalion, <b>Grenadier</b> Guards, then part of the 3rd Guards Brigade of the Guards Division, in November 1918.|$|E
5|$|In 1777 {{all three}} units {{participated in the}} Philadelphia campaign, {{taking part in the}} Battle of Brandywine, the Battle of Paoli and the Battle of Germantown. Remaining in Philadelphia over the winter and into 1778, the 64th and 2nd <b>Grenadier</b> Battalion formed part of the rearguard when Lieutenant-General Clinton {{evacuated}} the city in June 1778. Returning to New York, the 64th took part in several small operations. The Light company took part in the skirmish that became known as the Baylor Massacre.|$|E
5|$|In 1810 {{the estate}} {{was sold to}} Richard Henry Cox, {{grandson}} of Richard Cox, founder of the travel company Cox & Kings. Cox & Co, as the company was then known, was formed after Richard Cox was appointed agent to the Foot Guards (later the <b>Grenadier</b> Guards), and provided banking services for many regiments of the British Army {{by the end of}} the 18th century. The mansion was completely rebuilt after it burnt down in 1844 and later received a Grade II listing.|$|E
5|$|Mehldau {{continued}} to expand beyond trio and solo playing. In {{the spring of}} 2005 he premiered a song cycle that he had written for classical music singer Renée Fleming. This association {{was based on a}} commission from Carnegie Hall; their 2006 recording contained music set to poems by Rainer Maria Rilke and Louise Bogan. Mehldau also collaborated with guitarist Pat Metheny from 2005 – they recorded two albums together that year, along with <b>Grenadier</b> and Ballard, and in 2007 went on a worldwide tour.|$|E
5|$|Mehldau studied {{music at}} The New School, and toured and {{recorded}} while still a student. He {{was a member}} of saxophonist Joshua Redman's Quartet with bassist Christian McBride and drummer Brian Blade in the mid-1990s, and has led his own trio since the early 1990s. His first long-term trio featured bassist Larry <b>Grenadier</b> and drummer Jorge Rossy; in 2005 Jeff Ballard replaced Rossy. These bands have released a dozen albums under the pianist's name.|$|E
5|$|Moving up from Chambois, the Polish 1st Armoured Division's {{reconnaissance}} regiment made {{an attempt}} to reach their comrades on Point 262N but was mistakenly fired upon by the ridge's defenders. The regiment withdrew after losing two Cromwell tanks. At 12:00 a Polish forward patrol from the ridge encountered the Canadian vanguard near Point 239. The Canadian <b>Grenadier</b> Guards reached the ridge just over an hour later, having fought {{for more than five}} hours and accounted for two Panthers, a Panzer IV, and two self-propelled guns along their route. By 14:00, {{with the arrival of the}} first supply convoy, the position was relieved.|$|E
5|$|The Faculty of Medicine {{remained}} the school's only functioning faculty until 1843 when the Faculty of Arts commenced {{teaching in the}} newly constructed Arts Building and East Wing (Dawson Hall). The university also historically has strong linkage with The Canadian <b>Grenadier</b> Guards, a military regiment in which James McGill served as the Lieutenant-Colonel. This title is marked upon the stone that stands before the Arts building, from where the Guards step off annually to commemorate Remembrance Day.|$|E
5|$|The final attack {{had cost}} the 12th Parachute Battalion 126 killed, and left its three rifle {{companies}} with only thirty-five men between them. The 12th Devonshire company had another thirty-six killed. Amongst the casualties, was every officer or warrant officer, who had either {{been killed or}} wounded. The German defenders from the 3rd Battalion 858th <b>Grenadier</b> Regiment, had numbered 564 men before the British assault, {{by the time the}} village had been captured there were only 146 of them left.|$|E
