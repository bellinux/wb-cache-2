5|$|British dishes include {{fish and}} chips, the Sunday roast, and bangers and mash. British cuisine has several {{national}} and regional varieties, including English, Scottish and Welsh cuisine, <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>has</b> developed its own regional or local dishes, {{many of which are}} geographically indicated foods such as Cheddar cheese, Cheshire cheese, the Yorkshire pudding, Arbroath Smokie, Cornish pasty and Welsh cakes.|$|E
5|$|Character {{development}} is a primary element of Oblivion. At {{the beginning of the}} game, players select one of many human or anthropomorphic races, <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>has</b> different natural abilities, and customize their character's appearance. A perpetual objective for players is to improve their character's skills, which are numerical representations of their ability in certain areas.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with the}} wire electrode, a {{shielding}} gas feeds through the welding gun, which shields the process from contaminants in the air. The {{process can be}} semi-automatic or automatic. A constant voltage, direct current power source is most commonly used with GMAW, but constant current systems, as well as alternating current, can be used. There are four primary methods of metal transfer in GMAW, called globular, short-circuiting, spray, and pulsed-spray, <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>has</b> distinct properties and corresponding advantages and limitations.|$|E
5|$|Another early {{example is}} the 1981 Atari 2600 game Haunted House. Gameplay is typical of future {{survival}} horror titles, as it emphasizes puzzle-solving and evasive action, rather than violence. The game uses monsters commonly featured in horror fiction, such as bats and ghosts, <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>has</b> unique behaviors. Gameplay also incorporates item collection and inventory management, along with areas that are inaccessible until the appropriate item is found. Because it has several features that have been seen in later survival horror games, some reviewers have retroactively classified this game as {{the first in the}} genre.|$|E

5|$|As Queen Mary 2 is {{too large}} to dock in many ports, {{passengers}} are ferried {{to and from the}} ship in tenders, which can be used as lifeboats in an emergency. These are stored while at sea in davits alongside the lifeboats. To transport passengers to shore the tenders pull up to one of four loading stations, <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>has</b> a large hull door that hydraulically opens outwards to form a boarding platform, complete with railings and decking.|$|E
5|$|For {{self-governance}} purposes, {{the city}} is divided into 17 boroughs, <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>has</b> its own mayor (starosta) and council. The number of councillors in each depends on the size and population of the borough. Each of the boroughs coincides with the city's 20 cadastral areas, except for two cases: Nové Mesto is further divided into the Nové Mesto and Vinohrady cadastral areas and Ružinov is divided into Ružinov, Nivy and Trnávka. Further unofficial division recognizes additional quarters and localities.|$|E
5|$|In {{computer}} science, 2-satisfiability, 2-SAT or just 2SAT is a computational {{problem of}} assigning values to variables, <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>has</b> two possible values, {{in order to}} satisfy a system of constraints on pairs of variables. It is a special case of the general Boolean satisfiability problem, which can involve constraints on more than two variables, and of constraint satisfaction problems, which can allow more than two choices for the value of each variable. But in contrast to those more general problems, which are NP-complete, 2-satisfiability can be solved in polynomial time.|$|E

5|$|Larval ticks hatch {{with six}} legs, {{acquiring}} {{the other two}} after a blood meal and molting into the nymph stage. In the nymphal and adult stages, ticks have eight legs, <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>has</b> seven segments and is tipped {{with a pair of}} claws. The legs are sometimes ornamented and usually bear sensory or tactile hairs. In addition to being used for locomotion, the tarsus of leg I contains a unique sensory structure, Haller's organ, which can detect odors and chemicals emanating from the host, as well as sensing changes in temperature and air currents. When not being used for walking, the legs remain tightly folded against the body.|$|E
5|$|The Haram Area (Noble Sanctuary) lies in {{the eastern}} part of the city; and through the bazaar of this (quarter) you enter the Area by a great and {{beautiful}} gateway (Dargah)... After passing this gateway, you have on the right two great colonnades (Riwaq), <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>has</b> nine-and-twenty marble pillars, whose capitals and bases are of colored marbles, and the joints are set in lead. Above the pillars rise arches, that are constructed, of masonry, without mortar or cement, and each arch is constructed of no more than five or six blocks of stone. These colonnades lead down to near the Maqsurah (enclosure).|$|E
5|$|The {{pipe organ}} is a musical {{instrument}} that produces sound by driving pressurized air (called wind) through organ pipes selected via a keyboard. Because each pipe produces a single pitch, the pipes are provided in sets called ranks, <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>has</b> a common timbre and volume throughout the keyboard compass. Most organs have multiple ranks of pipes of differing timbre, pitch, and volume that the player can employ singly or in combination {{through the use of}} controls called stops.|$|E

5|$|During the British Raj, Shiyali (present-day Sirkazhi) was the {{headquarters}} of a separate administrative division, or taluka. In 1972 the town was declared a third grade municipality, and was upgraded to a second grade municipality in 1980. The municipality has 24 wards, <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>has</b> an elected councillor. The functions of the municipality are devolved into six departments: general administration/personnel, engineering, revenue, public health, town planning and IT, which are controlled by a Municipal Commissioner, who is the supreme executive head. Legislative powers are vested in a body of 24 members, {{one for each of}} the 24 wards. The legislative body is headed by an elected chairperson, who is assisted by a deputy. On the revenue administration side, Sirkazhi is a taluka headquarters having three revenue villages: Kavilancheri, Sirkazhi and Thadalan.|$|E
5|$|Greater Manchester spans , which roughly {{covers the}} {{territory}} of the Greater Manchester Built-up Area, the second most populous urban area in the UK. It is landlocked and borders Cheshire (to the south-west and south), Derbyshire (to the south-east), West Yorkshire (to the north-east), Lancashire (to the north) and Merseyside (to the west). There is a mix of high-density urban areas, suburbs, semi-rural and rural locations in Greater Manchester, but land use is mostly urban — the product of concentric urbanisation and industrialisation which occurred mostly during the 19th century when the region flourished as the global centre of the cotton industry. It has a focused central business district, formed by Manchester city centre and the adjoining parts of Salford and Trafford, but Greater Manchester is also a polycentric county with ten metropolitan districts, <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>has</b> at least one major town centre and outlying suburbs.|$|E
5|$|Most {{bivalves}} are filter feeders, {{using their}} gills to capture particulate food such as phytoplankton from the water. The protobranchs feed {{in a different}} way, scraping detritus from the seabed, {{and this may be}} the original mode of feeding used by all bivalves before the gills became adapted for filter feeding. These primitive bivalves hold on to the substratum with a pair of tentacles {{at the edge of the}} mouth, <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>has</b> a single palp, or flap. The tentacles are covered in mucus, which traps the food, and cilia, which transport the particles back to the palps. These then sort the particles, rejecting those that are unsuitable or too large to digest, and conveying others to the mouth.|$|E

5|$|While the {{committees}} are established by formal Senate rules, {{there are a}} number of caucuses that exercise significant influence over the legislative process. The most powerful of these are the Democratic Caucus and the Republican Caucus, <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>has</b> a leader and a whip, referred to as a majority and minority leader and whip. As Democrats currently control a majority of seats in the Senate, their leader is referred to as the Majority Leader, and their caucus is able to influence legislation to a greater extent than the Republican caucus. The Majority Leader and Minority leader are responsible for managing their party's participation in debate on the floor. Party caucuses also raise and distribute campaign money to assist their candidates. The Legislative Black Caucus of Maryland and Women Legislators of Maryland, caucuses of African-American and female Senators respectively, also play prominent roles in the Senate.|$|E
5|$|During mating, {{the male}} redback {{attempts}} to copulate by inserting {{one of its}} palps into {{the one of the}} female's two spermathecae (sperm storage organs), <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>has</b> its own insemination orifice. It then tries and often succeeds in inserting the other palp into the female's second orifice. The redback spider is one of only two animals known where the male has been found to actively assist the female in sexual cannibalism. In the process of mating, the much smaller male somersaults to place his abdomen over the female's mouthparts. In about two of three cases, the female fully consumes the male while mating continues. Males which are not eaten die of their injuries soon after mating. Sacrifice during mating is thought to confer two advantages to the species. The first is the eating process allows {{for a longer period of}} copulation and thus fertilisation of more eggs. The second is females which have eaten a male are more likely to reject subsequent males. Although this prohibits future mating for the males, this is not a serious disadvantage, because the spiders are sufficiently sparse that less than 20% of males ever find a potential mate during their lifetimes, and in any case, the male is functionally sterile if he has used the contents of both of his palps in the first mating.|$|E
5|$|The game's plot {{describes}} {{a journey through}} a child's emotions and anxieties. After befriending the monster, the boy leaves Earth on the creature's back to look for life elsewhere in the galaxy. He hopes {{to find someone to}} relate to. The hollow planet Gravida's surface is patrolled by a creature that complains of stomach pains. This larger creature is followed by several tiny creatures, some of which ride on its back. One of these smaller inhabitants has fallen into the core of Gravida. Though it is isolated and lonely, the creature consoles itself that nobody can harm it. The planet Malaisus is composed of water, with a monster identical to the player's swimming around with a shoal of fish. The monster tells the player to leave. Planet Bibulon has two faces on opposite sides, one angry and one happy. A two-faced creature travels across the surface; one is happy and the other morose. Bibulon is orbited by four moons, <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>has</b> differing opinions on an unnamed man or boy. When players find the planet Debasa, they discover that it is surrounded by a green fog. Gravity is very intense within the fog. Four orbiting satellites produce the fog, which has trapped two boys. Earth shrinks slightly after each planet has been completed. After restoring color to all the surrounding planets, the game is completed by returning to Earth. The Earth has shrunk until it is only slightly larger than the monster; it is destroyed when the boy and his monster land. Both fly upwards and land on the moon, where the boy is free to craft a future of his choosing.|$|E
