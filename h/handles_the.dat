5|$|Handled {{the ball}} is Law 33 in the laws of cricket {{established}} by the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC).

A decision of not out must be reached if the batsman <b>handles</b> <b>the</b> ball to avoid incurring an injury. A bowler does not receive credit for the wicket when a batsman is dismissed in this fashion.|$|E

None of these extra details were made separately; the bronzes were all one piece. Igbo-Ukwu gave the evidence of an early bronze casting tradition in Nri.|$|E

5|$|Each 22-minute episode takes {{approximately}} {{a year to}} complete; three to four episodes are produced simultaneously. Storyboard artists depict scenes using SketchBook Pro. Adapting these boards to limited animation, studio DHX Media <b>handles</b> <b>the</b> designs, poses and key frames of movement for each character appearing in a given scene for an episode, as well as background art. DHX hands these assets to a separate studio, where the remaining animation is finished using Adobe Flash. The speed of production is throttled slightly by Blythe having two unique outfits per episode, according to director Joel Dickie. Supervising director Dallas Parker similarly explained that the variety of assets created for each episode challenged the process of Flash animation in reusing movements.|$|E

5|$|Glue binder {{was often}} used as an {{inexpensive}} alternative to oil. Many works using this medium were produced but few survive today because of the delicateness of the linen cloth and the solubility of the hide glue from which the binder was derived. Well known and relatively well preserved – though substantially damaged – examples include Matsys' Virgin and Child with Saints Barbara and Catherine (c.1415–25) and Bouts' Entombment (c.1440–55). The paint was generally applied with brushes or sometimes with thin sticks or brush <b>handles.</b> <b>The</b> artists often softened the contours of shadows with their fingers, at times to blot or reduce the glaze.|$|E
5|$|The Cook Islands are a {{collection}} of fifteen islands lying in the South Pacific Ocean that are governed under a single parliamentary entity. Some 10,000 people live in the dependency. The country is in a free association with New Zealand, who <b>handles</b> <b>the</b> nation's external affairs. The Cook Islands became self-governing in 1965. 23 years later, the Cook Islands sent their first delegation to the Olympics at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. Between 1988 and 2008, the Cook Islands sent delegations to all six Summer Olympic games. The size of the Cook Islander delegation was largest in 1988, when it reached seven athletes. The size of the nation's delegation has not risen past four since then as of the Beijing Olympics.|$|E
5|$|As of 1993, {{there were}} 40 timber-processing plants {{and a number}} of sawmills. Tawau Port is a major export and import gateway for timber {{especially}} from North Kalimantan. A barter trade has been formalised between East Kalimantan (now North Kalimantan) and Sabah with the creation of Tawau Barter Trade Association (BATS) in 1993. The association <b>handles</b> <b>the</b> cash-based trade of raw materials from Indonesia, but in recent years has focussed on timber industry. Other than timber, since British rule ended exports have traditionally been spices, cocoa and tobacco. Birds' nests are harvested at Baturong, Sengarung, Tepadung and Madai Caves by the Ida'an community. Tawau {{is one of the top}} cocoa producers in Malaysia, and the world together with Ivory Coast, Ghana and Indonesia. The town is the cocoa capital for both in Sabah and Malaysia. Cocoa production is mostly concentrated in the interior, north of the town, while palm oil production is concentrated along the roads to Merotai, Brantian, Semporna and Kunak. Both cocoa and palm oil are part of the large agriculture sector that has become the main income producer for the town.|$|E

5|$|On August 29, 2016 (August 29, 1997, {{being the}} date when Skynet becomes self-aware in the films), it was {{announced}} that the film would be digitally remastered in 3D to commemorate its 25th anniversary, with a worldwide re-release planned for summer 2017. The version to be remastered and rereleased in 3D was the original 137 minute theatrical cut, as the extended edition is not James Cameron's preferred version. Only one camera shot from the opening chase sequence was digitally altered to fix a minor continuity error which had bugged Cameron since the 1991 release. DMG Entertainment and Studiocanal worked together with Cameron to convert the film using the StereoD technology. The 3D version premiered on February 17, 2017, at the Berlin International Film Festival, with the theatrical re-release being scheduled for August 25, 2017. Similar to Cameron's Titanic 3D, Lightstorm Entertainment oversaw the work on the 3D version of Terminator 2, which took nearly a year to finish. The film was released by Distrib Films US which typically <b>handles</b> <b>the</b> release of French films. The studio released the film exclusively for one week in AMC Theatres nationwide, and said that it will expand depending on the film's performances in its first week.|$|E
5|$|Rogers {{recruits}} Barnes, Dum Dum Dugan, Gabe Jones, Jim Morita, James Montgomery Falsworth, and Jacques Dernier {{to attack}} other known Hydra bases. Stark outfits Rogers with advanced equipment, most notably a circular shield made of vibranium, a rare, nearly indestructible metal. Rogers {{and his team}} sabotage various Hydra operations. The team later assaults a train carrying Zola. Rogers and Jones succeed in capturing Zola, but Barnes falls from the train to his assumed death. Using information extracted from Zola, the final Hydra stronghold is located, and Rogers leads an attack to stop Schmidt from using {{weapons of mass destruction}} on major American cities. Rogers climbs aboard Schmidt's aircraft as it takes off, and during the subsequent fight the Tesseract's container is damaged. Schmidt physically <b>handles</b> <b>the</b> Tesseract, causing him to dissolve in a bright light. The Tesseract burns through the plane and is lost in the ocean. Seeing no way to land the plane without the risk of detonating its weapons, Rogers crashes it in the Arctic. Stark later recovers the Tesseract from the ocean floor but is unable to locate Rogers or the aircraft, presuming him dead.|$|E
