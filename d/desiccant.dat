5|$|An alloy {{of sodium}} and potassium, NaK is a liquid {{used as a}} heat-transfer medium and a <b>desiccant</b> for {{producing}} dry and air-free solvents. It {{can also be used}} in reactive distillation. The ternary alloy of 12% Na, 47% K and 41% Cs has the lowest melting point of −78°C of any metallic compound.|$|E
5|$|Another type of {{atmospheric}} water collector {{makes use of}} desiccants which adsorb atmospheric water at ambient temperature, this {{makes it possible to}} extract moisture even when the relative humidity is as low as 14 percent. Systems of this sort have proved to be very useful as emergency supplies of safe drinking water. For regeneration, the <b>desiccant</b> needs to be heated. In some designs regeneration energy is supplied by the sun; air is ventilated at night over a bed of desiccants that adsorb the water vapour. During the day, the premises are closed, the greenhouse effect increases the temperature, and, as in solar desalination pools, the water vapour is partially desorbed, condenses on a cold part and is collected.|$|E

50|$|The {{enthalpy}} {{exchange is}} accomplished {{through the use}} of <b>desiccants.</b> <b>Desiccants</b> transfer moisture through the process of adsorption which is predominately driven by the difference in the partial pressure of vapor within the opposing air-streams. Typical <b>desiccants</b> consist of silica gel, and molecular sieves.|$|R

25|$|Owing to its {{hygroscopic}} nature, aerogel feels dry {{and acts}} as a strong <b>desiccant.</b> People handling aerogel for extended periods should wear gloves to prevent the appearance of dry brittle spots on their skin.|$|E
25|$|When {{sold at the}} {{anhydrous}} {{state as}} a <b>desiccant</b> with a color-indicating agent under the name Drierite, it appears blue (anhydrous) or pink (hydrated) due to impregnation with cobalt(II) chloride, which functions as a moisture indicator.|$|E
25|$|PET {{can also}} be dried in {{compressed}} air resin dryers. Compressed air dryers do not reuse drying air. Dry, heated compressed air is circulated through the PET pellets as in the <b>desiccant</b> dryer, then released to the atmosphere.|$|E

25|$|Anhydrous calcium {{chloride}} {{is used as}} a <b>desiccant</b> for drying a wide variety of solvents since it is inexpensive and does not react with most nonaqueous solvents. Chloroform {{is an example of a}} solvent that can be effectively dried using {{calcium chloride}}.|$|E
25|$|Typically, spacers {{are filled}} with or contain <b>desiccant</b> to remove {{moisture}} trapped in the gas space during manufacturing, thereby lowering the dew point of the gas in that space, and preventing condensation from forming on surface #2 when the outside glass pane temperature falls.|$|E
50|$|Another form of {{electronic}} dry box technology utilizes multi-porous molecular sieve <b>desiccants</b> to adsorb moisture. This moisture and humidity control technology is renewable {{without having to}} replace <b>desiccants.</b> Many electronic dry box manufacturers have utilize or switch to this technology as there are less limitation than the Peltier cooler which is less effective in removing moisture in colder ambient temperatures.|$|R
5000|$|An {{alternative}} available technology uses liquid, or [...] "wet" [...] <b>desiccants</b> such as {{lithium chloride}} or lithium bromide to pull {{water from the}} air via hygroscopic processes. [...] A proposed similar technique combines the use of solid <b>desiccants,</b> such as silica gel and zeolite, with pressure condensation. Direct drinking quality water generating devices using sun light are also under development.|$|R
40|$|The {{chemical}} literature, very inconsistent on {{the subject}} of the drying of solvents, abounds with contradictory statements as to the efficiency of even the more common <b>desiccants.</b> The recent advent of a novel, highly sensitive method which utilizes a tritiated water tracer for the assay of solvent water content has enabled the first compre-hensive study to be made of the efficiency of various <b>desiccants</b> which pertains unambiguously to solvents. Ben-zene, 1, 4 -dioxane, and acetonitrile, chosen as model solvents, were wetted with known amounts of tritiated water and treated with a spectrum of <b>desiccants,</b> and the residual water contents were then assayed. The results range from the expected to the highly surprising. Some anomalous results, obtained for benzene and acetonitrile with acidic and basic <b>desiccants,</b> respectively, are discussed in terms of isotopic exchange reactions. The bench chemist is often confronted by the problem of the selection of <b>desiccants</b> for solvent drying, and although dry solvents are frequently required for use in both prepara-tive situations and in physicochemical studies, there is a paucity of real information in the literature. Some authors 2 are content to dismiss drying with statements such as “Fre-quently a liquid can be freed from water by shaking with...|$|R
25|$|A {{more extreme}} {{example is the}} {{azeotrope}} of 1.2% water with 98.8% diethyl ether. Ether holds {{the last bit of}} water so tenaciously that only a very powerful <b>desiccant</b> such as sodium metal added to the liquid phase can result in completely dry ether.|$|E
25|$|For a {{standard}} construction IG unit, condensation collects between {{the layers of}} glass when the perimeter seal has failed and when the <b>desiccant</b> has become saturated, and can generally only be eliminated by replacing the IGU. Seal failure and subsequent replacement results in {{a significant factor in}} the overall cost of owning IGUs.|$|E
25|$|Unless a <b>desiccant</b> is used {{which can}} destroy the peroxides, they will {{concentrate}} during distillation, {{due to their}} higher boiling point. When sufficient peroxides have formed, they can form a crystalline, shock-sensitive solid precipitate. Minor mechanical disturbances, such as scraping {{the inside of a}} vessel or the dislodging of a deposit, can set off a violent explosion.|$|E

40|$|Optically stimulated {{luminescence}} (OSL) {{was used}} to test different kinds of <b>desiccants</b> for their potential use in retrospective dosimetry. <b>Desiccants</b> are used for the purpose of absorbing liquids and {{can be found in a}} number of items which may be found in the immediate environment of a person, including hand bags, drug packages, and the vehicles of rescue service teams. Any material exhibiting OSL properties suitable for retrospective dosimetry is a useful addition to the existing dosimetry system available in emergency preparedness. Eleven kinds of <b>desiccants</b> were investigated in order to obtain an overview of the fundamental OSL properties necessary for retrospective dosimetry. Measurements were made using a Rise TL/OSL reader and irradiations were achieved with the Sr- 90 /Y- 90 source incorporated in the reader. Several of the <b>desiccants</b> exhibited promising properties as retrospective dosemeters. Some of the materials exhibited a strong as-received signal, i. e. without any laboratory irradiation, but the origin of this signal has not yet been established. The minimum detectable dose ranged from 8 to 450 mGy for ten of the materials and for one material (consisting of natural clay) the minimum detectable dose was 1. 8 Gy...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} to verify the ideal moment of application of <b>desiccants</b> on the soybeans crop, to obtain seeds with maximum physiological and sanitary quality. The cultivar IAC- 15 was sowed at the experimental area of FE/UNESP - Campus of Ilha Solteira, located in the district of Selvíria, State of Mato Grosso do Sul (20 ° 22 ′S, 51 ° 22 ′W at approximately 335 m of altitude). The experimental design was a randomized block, with treatments in a factorial scheme of 3 × 3 and 4 × 4 (dessicant x application time), in 1996 / 97 and 1997 / 98, respectively. The <b>desiccants</b> applied during the season agricultural year 1996 / 97 were: paraquat, diquat, paraquat+diquat mix at the doses 400; 300; 200 + 150 e 400 g a. i. ha - 1, respectively. In 1997 / 98 the same <b>desiccants</b> were used, at the same doses, with additional treatment application of ammonium glufosinate at the dose of 400 g a. i. ha - 1. The <b>desiccants</b> were applied three times in 1996 / 97 and four times in 1997 / 98 with 5 days intervals starting at the R 6 stage. According to the environmental conditions of this research the best desiccation time was when soybean plants had 80 % to 90 % of pods with yellow and brown coloration and seeds with 45 % to 60 % of water content. There were no effects of any of the <b>desiccants</b> tested in the physiological and sanitary potential required for commercialization of the seeds...|$|R
25|$|Sodium {{chloride}} {{is sometimes}} {{used as a}} cheap and safe <b>desiccant</b> because of its hygroscopic properties, making salting an effective method of food preservation historically; the salt draws water out of bacteria through osmotic pressure, keeping it from reproducing, {{a major source of}} food spoilage. Even though more effective desiccants are available, few are safe for humans to ingest.|$|E
25|$|Upon heating orthophosphoric acid, {{condensation}} of the phosphoric units can {{be induced}} by driving {{off the water}} formed from condensation. When one molecule of water has been removed for each two molecules of phosphoric acid, the result is pyrophosphoric acid (H4P2O7). When an average of one molecule of water per phosphoric unit has been driven off, the resulting substance is a glassy solid having an empirical formula of HPO3 and is called metaphosphoric acid. Metaphosphoric acid is a singly anhydrous version of orthophosphoic acid and is sometimes used as a water- or moisture-absorbing reagent. Further dehydrating is very difficult and can be accomplished only {{by means of an}} extremely strong <b>desiccant</b> (and not by heating alone). It produces phosphoric anhydride (phosphorus pentoxide), which has an empirical formula P2O5, although an actual molecule has a chemical formula of P4O10. Phosphoric anhydride is a solid, which is very strongly moisture-absorbing and is used as a <b>desiccant.</b>|$|E
25|$|An {{adhesive}} sealant (polyisobutylene) {{is applied}} to the face of the spacer on each side and the panes pressed against the spacer. If the unit is gas filled, two holes are drilled into the spacer of the assembled unit, lines are attached to draw out the air out of the space and replacing it (or leaving just vacuum) with the desired gas. The lines are then removed and holes sealed to contain the gas. The more modern technique is to use an online gas filler, which eliminates the need to drill holes in the spacer. The units are then sealed on the edge side using either polysulfide or silicone sealant or similar material to prevent humid outside air from entering the unit. The <b>desiccant</b> will remove traces of humidity from the air space so that no water appears on the inside faces (no condensation) of the glass panes facing the air space during cold weather. Some manufacturers have developed specific processes that combine the spacer and <b>desiccant</b> into a single step application system.|$|E
5000|$|In the laboratory, {{molecular}} sieves {{are used to}} dry solvent. [...] "Sieves" [...] {{have proven to be}} superior to traditional drying techniques, which often employ aggressive <b>desiccants.</b>|$|R

40|$|Comparison of the {{adsorption}} {{characteristics of}} the <b>desiccants</b> silica gel, alumina, and molecular sieves has shown that molecular sieves have by far the greatest capacity of the <b>desiccants</b> at the low partial pressures considered. Equilibrium data {{in the form of}} isotherms were established over the range of variables expected in the coolant circuit of a proposed Australian H. T. G. C. reactor. The mass transfer from the gas phase to molecular sieves is such that no correlation could be attempted for the adsorption zone height; the height proved to be too small...|$|R
25|$|Because of {{its high}} boiling point and {{affinity}} for water, ethylene glycol is a useful <b>desiccant.</b> Ethylene glycol is widely used to inhibit the formation of natural gas clathrates (hydrates) in long multiphase pipelines that convey natural gas from remote gas fields to a gas processing facility. Ethylene glycol can be recovered from the natural gas and reused as an inhibitor after purification treatment that removes water and inorganic salts.|$|E
25|$|Inside the dryer, hot dry air {{is pumped}} {{into the bottom of}} the hopper {{containing}} the resin so that it flows up through the pellets, removing moisture on its way. The hot wet air leaves the top of the hopper and is first run through an after-cooler, because it is easier to remove moisture from cold air than hot air. The resulting cool wet air is then passed through a <b>desiccant</b> bed. Finally, the cool dry air leaving the <b>desiccant</b> bed is re-heated in a process heater and sent back through the same processes in a closed loop. Typically, residual moisture levels in the resin must be less than 50 parts per million (parts of water per million parts of resin, by weight) before processing. Dryer residence time should not be shorter than about four hours. This is because drying the material in less than 4 hours would require a temperature above 160°C, at which level hydrolysis would begin inside the pellets before they could be dried out.|$|E
25|$|IGUs {{are often}} {{manufactured}} on a {{made to order}} basis on factory production lines, but standard units are also available. The width and height dimensions, {{the thickness of the}} glass panes and the type of glass for each pane as well as the overall thickness of the unit must be supplied to the manufacturer. On the assembly line, spacers of specific thicknesses are cut and assembled into the required overall width and height dimensions and filled with <b>desiccant.</b> On a parallel line, glass panes are cut to size and washed to be optically clear.|$|E
50|$|An {{atmospheric}} water generator (AWG) is {{a device that}} extracts water from humid ambient air. Water vapor in the air is condensed by cooling the air below its dew point, exposing the air to <b>desiccants,</b> or pressurizing the air. Unlike a dehumidifier, an AWG is designed to render the water potable. AWGs are useful where pure drinking water is difficult or impossible to obtain, because there is almost always {{a small amount of}} water in the air that can be extracted. The two primary techniques in use are cooling and <b>desiccants.</b>|$|R
