50|$|On January 11, 2014, the Athletic Department at Penn State {{announced}} {{the appointment of}} Franklin as the head football coach of the Penn State Nittany Lions. Penn State agreed to pay $1.5 million that Franklin owed Vanderbilt for early termination of his contract, Penn State disclosed this information January 24, 2014, according to USA TODAY Sports. He received a ten-year contract, which paid him $4.3 million for the 2014 season, including a $300,000 retention bonus payable if he was Penn State's coach on December 31, 2014. He has an annual <b>guaranteed</b> <b>pay</b> increase of $100,000 along with retention bonuses, plus performance incentives each year. During his first few press conferences, he has said how he wants Penn State to again be the most dominant school in recruiting in Pennsylvania. During the 2016 season, Penn State started the season 2-2, but Franklin rallied his team to win the next eight games, winning the Big Ten's East Division, followed by a victory over Wisconsin in the 2016 Big Ten Football Championship Game. For his team's turn around, Franklin was named the Dave McClain Coach of the Year in the Big Ten.|$|E

Much was made in the press that out of the top three teams throughout much of December and January (Kentucky, Virginia, and Duke), the Cavaliers had zero McDonald's All-Americans, whereas the Wildcats and Blue Devils had nine each. Other highlights included holding Rutgers, Harvard, and Georgia Tech to under thirty points each, and [...] "doubling up" [...] both Georgia Tech (57-28) and Wake Forest (70-34); the one other time that feat had been accomplished even just once in an ACC game was Duke over Clemson exactly 60 seasons earlier. The Harvard game was also notable for its fateful score, 76-27, and Virginia's limiting the Crimson (an NCAA Tournament team) to a single field goal in the first half, tying an NCAA record for the shot clock era. After the season, Bennett won a second Henry Iba Award as the nation's top coach from the United States Basketball Writers Association, joining Roy Williams as the only coaches to win the award at two different schools. Only John Wooden (7) has won it more than twice.

As they saw their hours cut, monetary livelihoods taken away from them, and no other jobs to tum to in such an economic downturn, Argentine workers mobilized and assembled together to take over their failing workplaces, and build it up themselves. They proved the potential of workers activism by transforming their previous work sites into ones without bosses-led by the community of workers, with <b>guaranteed</b> <b>pay</b> and treatment, and most importantly, with a guaranteed job {{at the end of}} each day. I explore the process of revolutionary social and political reconstruction spurred by a devastating economic collapse by looking at the takeover of businesses throughout Argentina, and the ways this process necessitated newly defining citizenship, the Argentine working class identity, and an imagined nation. I will argue that through this newfound Argentine national identity, direct participatory citizenship, and optimism for a better nation, such drastic reform became possible...|$|E

40|$|Growing {{interest}} in accessing talent on demands {{stems from the}} breakdown of long term employment relationships. As employers are no longer constrained to offer their workers employment stability, they can explore opportunities to better match their workforce to fluctuations in demand. In this paper, I argue that a disproportionate focus on {{changes in the way}} that employment relationships are governed can mask other constraints on employment flexibility. The need for firm specific and role specific knowledge was an important early driver of long term employment relationships. I argue that such specialized knowledge continues to favor long term relationships between firms and employees, {{even in the absence of}} explicit employment <b>guarantees.</b> <b>Paying</b> attention to how knowledge governs employment may explain why overall employment stability appears to have changed much less than the norms that govern employment relationship. I illustrate these arguments with a case study of IT workers in a large financial service institution. I show how inattention to constraints of knowledge undermined the organization’s attempts to use contractors to access talent on demand...|$|R
40|$|According to the National Committee on Pay Equity (2012), {{pay equity}} {{is a means}} of {{eliminating}} gender and race in the wage-setting system. It means that the criteria employers use to determine wages must be gender and race blind. In this paper, pay inequity, pay inequality, pay disparity, wage gap, and wage disparity, are used interchangeably. During World War I, large numbers of American women were employed in manufacturing industries while men employees served in the military. These women were <b>guaranteed</b> <b>pay</b> equity by the equal pay policy of the War Labor Board of 1918 which required employers to pay those women equal pay as men (AAUW, 2011). Also, during World War II, large numbers of women were employed in war industries. The National War Labor Board in 1942 asked employers to voluntarily pay these women the same rates paid to males. But none of these appeals bore fruit. Moreover, after the war, most of these women were pushed out of jobs (AAUW, 2011). Consequently, the first bill prohibiting pay discrimination against women called “Women’s Equal Pay Act of 1945 ” was introduced, but was not passed. Every year, bills were introduced but not passed and it was not until 1963 that John F. Kennedy signed the Equal Pay Act (EPA) which became effective on June 11, 1964. With this bill it was illegal to pay wome...|$|E
