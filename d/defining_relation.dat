Dehn proved that fundamental groups of closed orientable surfaces of genus at least two have word problem solvable by what is now called Dehn's algorithm. His proof involved drawing the Cayley graph of such a group in the hyperbolic plane and performing curvature estimates via the Gauss–Bonnet theorem for a closed loop in the Cayley graph to conclude that such a loop must contain a large portion (more than a half) of a <b>defining</b> <b>relation.</b>|$|E

50|$|An {{important}} {{characteristic of}} a fractional design is the <b>defining</b> <b>relation,</b> which gives the set of interaction columns equal in the design matrix to a column of plus signs, denoted by I. For the above example, since D = AB and E = AC, then ABD and ACE are both columns of plus signs, and consequently so is BDCE. In this case the <b>defining</b> <b>relation</b> of the fractional design is I = ABD = ACE = BCDE. The <b>defining</b> <b>relation</b> allows the alias pattern of the design to be determined.|$|E

Another problem is that one would often want to include order relations, formulas involving continuous functional calculus, and spectral data as relations. For that reason, we use a relatively roundabout way of <b>defining</b> C*-algebra <b>relations.</b> The basic motivation behind the following definitions {{is that we will}} <b>define</b> <b>relations</b> as the category of their representations.|$|R

50|$|An {{important}} {{property of}} a fractional design is its resolution or ability to separate main effects and low-order interactions from one another.

The most important fractional designs are those of resolution III, IV, and V: Resolutions below III are not useful and resolutions above V are wasteful in that the expanded experimentation has no practical benefit in most cases—the bulk of the additional effort goes into the estimation of very high-order interactions which rarely occur in practice.
