50|$|In operation, a {{rotating}} mass is accelerated by the motor, storing energy, then suddenly {{connected to the}} output shaft (the anvil), creating a high-torque impact. The hammer mechanism is designed such that after delivering the impact, the hammer is again allowed to spin freely, and does not stay locked. With this design, the only reaction force applied {{to the body of}} the tool is the motor accelerating the hammer, and thus the operator feels very little torque, even though a very high peak torque is delivered to the socket. (This is similar to a conventional hammer, where the user applies a small, constant force to swing the hammer, which generates a very large impulse when the hammer strikes an object.) The hammer design requires a certain minimum torque before the hammer is allowed to spin separately from the anvil, causing the tool to <b>stop</b> <b>hammering</b> and instead smoothly drive the fastener if only low torque is needed, rapidly installing/removing the fastener.|$|R
25|$|West Ham's {{return to}} European competition, in the 2006–07 UEFA Cup, was {{ultimately}} short-lived as they lost 4–0 over two {{legs in the}} first round proper to Italian club Palermo. This marked a major downturn in form leading to eight losses in succession in all competitions as of 24 October, including a shock 2–1 loss away to League 1 side Chesterfield in the third round of the Carling Cup. The <b>Hammers</b> finally <b>stopped</b> the record-breaking run on 29 October at home to Blackburn with a 2–1 win in the Premiership, with goals from Teddy Sheringham, who in the making became the oldest ever goalscorer in the Premier League, and Hayden Mullins getting the winner in the 79th minute. They made it two wins in a row when they beat Arsenal at Upton Park with Marlon Harewood getting an 89th-minute winner. The game was overshadowed by the arguments between Arsène Wenger and Alan Pardew in the manager dugouts, both having been later charged by the FA. On 21 November, the proposed takeover of West Ham by a consortium headed by Icelandic businessman Eggert Magnússon went through, fuelling speculation over Pardew's future. After just four games with Magnusson as the new chairman of West Ham, Pardew was sacked from the manager's role on 11 December, after a 4–0 drubbing at Bolton on the Saturday before. Pardew eventually found work again on 24 December 2006, at Charlton Athletic, ironically where Pardew's replacement Alan Curbishley had spent 15 years of his managerial career, building his reputation.|$|R
40|$|In total hip {{replacement}} (THR), the initial fixation of the femoral stem has a critical influence on its long term stability. Objective intra-operative assessment of primary stability is a challenge, surgeons having to rely mainly on their clinical experience. Excessive press-fitting {{of the stem}} can cause intra-operative fractures in up to 30 % of revision cases. In a previous study we demonstrated the feasibility and validity of a vibrational technique {{for the assessment of}} the femur-stem fixation in vitro. In this in vivo study the vibration analysis was applied for the per-operative assessment of stem fixation in 30 THR patients who obtained an intra-operatively manufactured, hydroxyapatite coated, cementless prosthesis. The surgeon inserted the stem through repetitive controlled hammer blows. After each blow, the frequency response function (FRF) of the stem-bone structure was measured directly on the prosthesis neck in the range 0 – 10 kHz. The <b>hammering</b> was <b>stopped</b> when the FRF graph did not change anymore. Extra blows would not improve the stability but would increase the fracture risk. In 26 out of 30 cases (86. 7 %), the correlation coefficient between the last two FRFs was above 0. 99 when the insertion was stopped. In four cases, when the surgeon decided to stop the insertion because of suspected bone fragility, the final correlation coefficient attained lower values. During the insertion of a cementless prosthesis, the changes of boundary conditions and implant stability between subsequent stages are reflected by the FRF evolution. The higher resonance frequencies are more sensitive to the stability change. The correlation between successive FRFs {{can be used as a}} criterion for the detection of the insertion endpoint. Moreover, the FRF analysis can be used to detect dangerous situations during surgery like stem blockage and fracture risk. This study should be completed and validated by a post-operative follow-up of the patients. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Global {{positioning}} system (GPS) with a triaxial accelerometer {{is widely used}} to monitor movements of athletes in games and training, and “body load” (BL) representing the accumulation of the rate of changes in three planes of movements is obtained to determine the training load of a session. Deceleration, change of directions and <b>stopping</b> require <b>eccentric</b> contractions of leg muscles, potentially causing muscle damage and affecting athletic performance. Thus, {{it is important to}} monitor eccentric loading in games and training. A variable known as “eccentric index” (EI) purports to be a better representation of eccentric loading than BL. However, it is not known whether BL or EI accurately represents eccentric loading. The present study compared BL and EI during a drill consisting of several movements requiring eccentric contractions of leg muscles (Study 1), and monitored BL and EI over four training sessions of football (soccer) together with changes in maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) strength of the knee extensors and muscle soreness of the thigh muscles before and after each training session (Study 2). In Study 1, 11 university students performed a drill consisting of 3 segments separated by 2 vertical jumps (segment 1 : 70 m, segment 2 : 50 m, segment 3 : 60 m) with several movements including half turns (approximately 45 °), 90 ° and 180 ° turns and a stop for a total distance of 180 m. All subjects performed the drill at 30 %, 60 % and 100 % of their perceived maximal velocity, 2 trials for each velocity with a 5 -min rest between trials. The same trials were repeated on two different days separated by at least 2 days. The time to complete the drill was measured by timing gates, and the time to complete each segment and entire distance, BL (GPSports, Australia) and EI (Athletic Data Innovations, Australia) of each segment were calculated from the GPS/accelerometer data using a specific software. One-way ANOVA compared the three velocities and three segments for the time, BL and EI, and a Pearson product-moment correlation was used to examine the relationships between them. The time to complete the drill was 102. 9 ± 15. 2 s for 30 %, 56. 3 ± 5. 6 s for 60 %, and 42. 6 ± 3. 1 s for maximum (100 %) velocity, with each significantly different from the others (p In Study 2, 6 state league level outfield football (soccer) players were monitored for 4 training sessions, each lasting for 90 - 120 minutes. BL and EI were calculated as per Study 1 and MVC strength and muscle soreness were assessed before and 1 day after each training session. BL and EI were similar across the 4 sessions; however a large variability in the EI was evident among the players. It was found that a high EI player had a high total mechanical work (total accumulation of changes of directions, accelerations and decelerations). No significant correlation was found between BL and EI, indicating that BL and EI showed different aspects of the movements. No significant changes in MVC strength and muscle soreness were observed after any training session, suggesting that muscle damage was not induced, because of the protective effect conferred by regular training. From the two studies, it was concluded that EI was a better marker to quantify eccentric load than BL, however it is still unclear how accurately EI represents actual muscle damage of leg muscles, which warrants further studie...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to develop mathematical simulation models for predicting the transient behaviour of strings and beams subjected to impacts. The developed models are applied to study {{the dynamics of the}} piano and the sitar. For simulating rigid point impacts on continuous systems, a new method is proposed based on the unit impulse response. The developed method allows one to relate modal velocities before and after impact, without requiring the integration of the system equations of motion during impact. The proposed method has been used to model the impact of a pinned-pinned beam with a rigid obstacle. Numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the inability of the collocation-based coefficient of restitution method to predict an accurate and energy-consistent response. The results using the unit-impulse-based coefficient of restitution method are also compared to those obtained with a penalty approach,with good agreement. A new moving boundary formulation is presented to simulate wrapping contacts in continuous systems impacting rigid distributed obstacles. The free vibration response of an ideal string impacting a distributed parabolic obstacle located at its boundary is analyzed to understand and simulate a sitar string. The portion of the string in contact with the obstacle is governed by a different partial differential equation (PDE) from the free portion represented by the classical string equation. These two PDEs and corresponding boundary conditions, along with the transversality condition that governs the dynamics of the moving boundary, are obtained using Hamilton's principle. A Galerkin approximation is used to convert them into a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations, with time-dependent mode-shapes as basis functions. The advantages and disadvantages of the proposed method are discussed in comparison to the penalty approach for simulating wrapping contacts. Finally, the model is used to investigate the mechanism behind the generation of the buzzing tone in a sitar. An alternate formulation using the penalty approach is also proposed, and the results are contrasted with those obtained using the moving boundary approach. A model for studying the interaction between a flexible beam and a string at a point including friction has also been developed. This model is used to study the interaction between a piano hammer and the string. A realistic model of the piano hammer-string interaction must treat both the action mechanism and the string. An elastic stiff string model is integrated with a dynamic model of a compliant piano action mechanism with a flexible hammer shank. Simulations have been used to compare the mechanism response for impact on an elastic string and a rigid <b>stop.</b> <b>Hammer</b> head scuffing along the string, as well as length of time in contact, were found to increase where an elastic string was used, while hammer shank vibration amplitude and peak contact force decreased. Introducing hammer-string friction decreases the duration of contact and reduces the extent of scuffing. Finally, significant differences in hammer and string motion were predicted for a highly flexible hammer shank. Initial contact time and location, length of contact period, peak contact force, hammer vibration amplitude, scuffing extent, and string spectral content were all influenced...|$|R
