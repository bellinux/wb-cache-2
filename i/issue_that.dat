5|$|Another <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> {{concerns}} {{women is}} {{the dress code}} expected of them. Islam requires {{both men and women}} to dress modestly; this concept is known as hijab and covers a wide interpretation of behavior and garments. There is mixed opinion among feminists over extremes of externally imposed control. Women from other religions are also expected to follow dress codes.|$|E

5|$|Ellen {{became a}} tourist {{attraction}} for the village, and her family made considerable money from visitors' donations. As the years progressed {{with no sign of}} Ellen's waking, speculation grew that her illness was either a hoax or caused by her mother, an <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> was never resolved. In late 1880, soon after her mother's death, Ellen awoke. She later married and had at least five children.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{publication}} of a 2016 interdepartmental report into the issue of mental health in the justice system, McEntee stated her belief that it is unacceptable to send people with mental health issues to prison, and that this is an <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> must be tackled by the government. She also believes the government should address concerns about the mental health of unemployed young people.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{firearms}} possession {{is not a}} politicized <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> {{would be}} debated during Czech elections.

30|$|The limited {{translation}} <b>issues</b> <b>that</b> arose during cognitive interviews {{may have}} resulted from the evidence-based cross-cultural translation and adaptation approach used in this study.

5|$|The {{production}} {{of renewable energy}} in Scotland is an <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> {{has come to the}} fore in technical, economic, and political terms during the opening years of the 21st century. The natural resource base for renewable energy is extraordinary by European, and even global standards, with the most important potential sources being wind, wave, and tide.|$|E
5|$|Another <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> {{strained}} the UN logistics {{system was}} the lack of a previously drafted resupply plan. Consumption rates differed among the various units {{and as a result of}} a lack of coordination, some UN units faced supply shortages when other units would request more material than they actually needed. In order to rectify this situation UN logisticians were forced to hastily create a plan as the need arose.|$|E
5|$|Brundage {{took the}} {{position}} that as the Germans had reported nondiscrimination to the IOC, and the IOC had accepted that report, US Olympic authorities were bound by that determination. Nevertheless, it became increasingly apparent that with the Nazi actions, no Jew was likely to secure {{a place on the}} German team. Brundage stated on this <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> as only 12Jews had ever represented Germany in the Olympics, it would hardly be surprising if none did in 1936.|$|E

5|$|Cornwall, {{represented}} by the Cornwall Commonwealth Games Association (CCGA), sent a bid {{for participation in the}} 2006 Commonwealth Games, however, their application was rejected by the CGF, who stated that the constitutional status of Cornwall was not an <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> should be resolved through this medium. However, in 2010, the CCGA sought to launch a legal challenge to the decision of the CGF, stating that the Cornish bid of 2006 fulfilled the entire criterion of the CGF, and by rejecting the bid, the CGF had violated their own code, failing to follow their own criteria for participation. The Cornwall team will therefore seek competition in the 2014 games.|$|E
5|$|Finally, the Court {{expressed}} {{the view that}} if free speech is to be favoured over the protection of reputation in applying a Reynolds-type defence, another <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> {{will have to be}} considered is what balance should be struck between the two competing interests. In this connection, Chan C.J. said that the court would have to decide whether freedom of expression is to be given preference over the protection of reputation, whether it is a fundamental right that trumps the protection of reputation unless it is shown that the defamatory statement was made maliciously, or whether it is co-equal with the protection of reputation.|$|E
5|$|Glenn {{chaired the}} Committee on Governmental Affairs from 1987 to 1995. It {{was in this}} role that he {{discovered}} a host of safety and environmental problems with the nation's nuclear weapons facilities. Glenn was {{made aware of the}} problem at the Fernald Feed Materials Production Center near Cincinnati, and soon found that it was an <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> occurred at several sites around the nation. Glenn requested investigations from the General Accounting Office of Congress and held several hearings on the issue. He spent the remainder of his Senate career acquiring funding to clean up the nuclear waste left at the facilities. He also sat on the Foreign Relations and Armed Services committees and the Special Committee on Aging.|$|E

5|$|In 2010, an Italian-led {{consortium}} {{announced they}} had sequenced the complete genome {{of the apple}} in collaboration with horticultural genomicists at Washington State University, using 'Golden Delicious'. It had about 57,000 genes, {{the highest number of}} any plant genome studied to date and more genes than the human genome (about 30,000). This new understanding of the apple genome will help scientists in identifying genes and gene variants that contribute to resistance to disease and drought, and other desirable characteristics. Understanding the genes behind these characteristics will allow scientists to perform more knowledgeable selective breeding. The genome sequence also provided proof that Malus sieversii was the wild ancestor of the domestic apple—an <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> had been long-debated in the scientific community.|$|E
5|$|In her interview, Swedish Detective Superintendent Kajsa Wahlberg {{describes}} purchasing sex from {{a prostitute}} as paying to masturbate into someone. The leader {{of an organization}} working to rescue girls from prostitution in Cambodia {{says that it is}} not the poorest parents who sell their children into sexual slavery but rather the parents who are looking to buy luxury goods. He therefore argues that sex trafficking is a spiritual and moral <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> cannot be solved by education or money. In another interview, a man purchasing sex in Thailand says that he believes the girls are happy to be working as prostitutes. Another interview features an American man who had been a sex tourist in Asia.|$|E
5|$|In the US Senate, however, {{a series}} of {{amendments}} exempted important issues from any sort of arbitration. Any <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> was not exempted would need a two thirds vote of the Senate before arbitration could begin. Virtually nothing {{was left of the}} original proposal, and the Senate in May 1897 voted 43 in favor to 26 opposed, three votes short of the two thirds majority needed. The Senate in the first place was jealous of its control over treaties, and secondly was susceptible to a certain deep-rooted Anglophobia.|$|E

5|$|Of {{concern to}} breeders is the {{condition}} known as uterine inertia, {{an inability to}} expel the foetus due to weak muscles.

Another <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> affects the breed is Pyruvate kinase deficiency, which leads to hemolytic anemia. Typical symptoms includes lethargy, diarrhea, lack of appetite, poor coat quality, weight loss and jaundice.|$|E
5|$|One <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> {{emerged from}} these studies {{was the problem}} of {{providing}} early warning to the SCD sites. The SCD's MSR radars provided detection at perhaps , which meant targets would appear on their radars only seconds before launches {{would have to be}} carried out. In a sneak attack scenario, there would not be enough time to receive command authority for the release of nuclear weapons. This meant the bases would require launch on warning authority, which was politically unacceptable.|$|E
