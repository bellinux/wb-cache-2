40|$|This {{project was}} {{inspired}} in a fundamental way by {{an interest in}} the function of Italian Renaissance portraiture. The essential question is concerned with the expanded functional range of portraiture within the context of early modern cross-cultural engagement between traditional foes. The dissertation casts a spotlight on the relationship between Italy and Ottoman Turkey, the most powerful and prominent of its contemporary Near Eastern counterparts. The first chapter explores the influence of the diplomatic culture particular to Venice on the artistic output [...] including drawings, a painted portrait and a portrait medal [...] resulting from the late fifteenth-century journey of the city's famous son Gentile Bellini to the Istanbul court of the Ottoman sultan Mehmed II (Mehmed the Conqueror). The representations of the Turkish ruler are discussed as objectively motivated, fact-focused diplomatic "documents" {{in the spirit of the}} singularly Venetian tradition of the relazione produced by diplomats of the city upon the completion of diplomatic missions. The second chapter explores the renowned portrait collection of the early sixteenth-century Comasque scholar Paolo Giovio. As part of his assiduously cultivated collection of images of "famous" men and women, Giovio unconventionally possessed portraits of both deceased and contemporary Near Eastern figures. Among these were eleven images of Ottoman sultans. Although the influence of traditional motivations for collecting portraits is in evidence, the collection as a whole can also be fruitfully explored as a reflection of the scholar's lifelong interest in history and its chronicling. The unconventional inclusion of Near Eastern and other foreign figures suggests his preoccupation with global interconnection. His carefully crafted textual treatment of the figures [...] he eventually composed brief eulogies to hang beneath each of the portraits [...] suggests the precariousness of attempting to handle neutrally the Near Eastern "other. " The images in conjunction with the text operate as an innovatively bold and frank commentary on contemporary history. A century separates Gentile's execution of Mehmed II's portrait and a series of portraits of the house of Osman produced by the workshop of another Venetian master, Paolo Veronese, through the <b>indirect</b> <b>commission</b> of the sultan Murad III (1574 - 1595) and his grand vizier Sokollu Mehmed Pasha. The inspiration for the third chapter, these fourteen portraits, produced, significantly, in the wake of the momentous Battle of Lepanto, are singular within the tradition of sultan portraiture for the degree to which the figures have been animated and humanized. Even allowing for the shift in stylistic trends from the end of the fifteenth to the end of the sixteenth century, I suggest that the psychological impact of the Battle of Lepanto and a specifically Venetian brand of civic self-consciousness played a heightened role in the formal solution adopted for the commission. "Veronese's" approach to the depiction of the Ottoman sultans shifted attention away from symbolic markers of difference, such as clothing, and focused attention instead on the corporeal reality and the psychological presence of the sultans, aspects highlighting the European potential of the figures and attesting to the reality of subtle rather than rigid boundaries in the definition of Europeans as categorically different from the Ottoman Turks [...] a subtle act of assimilation in a crucial moment in the history between Europe and Ottoman Turkey that ultimately exhibits once again the functional flexibility of portraiture. Considered in relation to each other, the three case studies demonstrate the subtle functional flexibility of portraiture within a context bridging diverse cultures. These various acts of representation demonstrate the culture of early modern European cooperativity through their common effort to understand a foreign culture by means of visual accommodation...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present new {{empirical}} evidence on global trends in equity-related transaction costs and trading volume, as well as to highlight recent research in international market microstructure. Design/methodology/approach – Estimates of brokerage <b>commissions,</b> <b>indirect</b> trading costs, and trading volume are obtained from a comprehensive institutional investor database. Quarterly data are used to compute trends in transaction costs and trading volume, as well as shifts in trading between mature and emerging markets. Findings – The results indicate a steady decline in brokerage commissions around the world but indirect trading costs appear to have reached a plateau. The fastest growth in trading volume can be found in the emerging markets of South America but the USA leads the way in terms of the steepest reductions in transaction costs. Research limitations/implications – The paper relies on one source of transaction cost estimates over a relatively short period (March 2005 -December 2007). Originality/value – The paper provides comprehensive and current empirical evidence on important trends in international market microstructure.

40|$|Several {{previous}} studies have pointed out {{the need for the}} use of a more robust statistical methodology in order {{to gain a better understanding}} of all forms of fraud. In this paper, we studied the aetiology of fraud proposed by Cressey (1973) by examining two models that incorporated rationalisation into causal relationships within a fraud commission model and hence of a fraud risk model. A sample of 122 Indonesian respondents, who had ever encountered any forms of fraud, was used to test two theory based structural equations models. Because of the poor fit of the two theoretical models to the data as shown by the SRMR index and because the path between rationalisation and commission of fraud was found to be non-significant, an exploratory research process was used to derive a further model. The outcome of this process was the introduction of additional paths into the second theoretical model. This model was tested using another sample of 122 respondents and produced a good fit to the data. Significant direct and <b>indirect</b> drivers of <b>commission</b> of fraud were identified and these extended the theory and introduced the consideration of a wider range of fraud risk factors for the global audit profession. Collusion was perceived to be the strongest direct influence on commission of fraud with a lesser effect arising from opportunity for fraud and a final direct influence arising from the avoidance of justice. In addition, organisational orientation was perceived to provide another indirect influence on the commission of fraud. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of these findings...|$|R
40|$|The aims of {{this thesis}} are {{to set out}} the ten audit outcome based {{scenarios}} and the research questions and auditing problems derived from the scenarios, to develop a wide fraud framework and two hypothesised models of fraud symptoms, and to examine the questions and problems using literature review studies and the models using structural equations modelling. This approach is {{in accordance with the}} direct call for the use of more advanced statistical methods by Michael 2 ̆ 6 Adler (1971), Steane 2 ̆ 6 Cockerell (2005), and Zahra et al. (2005). The thesis uses a range of references drawn from the fields of economics, finance, auditing, criminology, law, psychology, organisational behaviour and research methodology. It finds that the fraud risk factors listed in the International Standards on Auditing (ISA) 240, have only been drawn from the findings of Cressey (1950, 1973), and that later models proposed by Krambia-Kapardis (1999, 2001, 2002), for instance, have still not fully explained the aetiology of fraud and the complexity of all forms of fraud and corruption (Wells, 1997, 2005, 2007). Three additional fraud risk factors, namely collusion, justice avoidance, and organisational orientation, were included in an examination of two hypothesised models that incorporated rationalisation into causal relationships within a fraud commission model and hence of a pre-fraud risk management model. A half-sample of 122 Indonesian respondents, who had ever encountered fraud or corrupt practices, was used to test two theory based structural equations models. Because of the poor fit of the two models to the data as shown by the Standardized Root Mean Residual (SRMR) index and because the path between rationalisation and commission of fraud was found to be non-significant, an exploratory research process was used to derive a post-hoc model. The outcome of this process was the introduction of additional paths into the second model. The post-hoc model was tested using another half-sample of 122 respondents and produced a good fit to the data. Significant direct and <b>indirect</b> drivers of <b>commission</b> of fraud were identified and these extended the theory, introduced a wider range of fraud risk factors for consideration by the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), for instance, and called for both the establishment of an integrated mechanism by audit and justice institutions and more integrated curriculum. Collusion was perceived to be the strongest direct influence on commission of fraud with a lesser effect arising from opportunity for fraud and a final direct influence arising from the avoidance of justice. In addition, organisational orientation was perceived to provide another indirect influence on the fraud commission. The overall findings in regard to all of the research questions and problems, theoretical models, and the search for a more robust methodology have provided guidance for the expansion of the consideration of fraud risk factors and hence of fraud risk theories, for the more robust prescription to overcome the fraud symptoms, and for the stronger solution to resolve problems and failures, hence the eight recommendations that can be proffered. These should be taken into consideration by the accounting profession and auditing (self-) regulators (e. g., Indonesian Audit Board), fraud and auditing researchers, practitioners, fraud experts, criminologist, academia or authorities (e. g., Indonesian justice institutions). Key Words: Fraud risk factors, collusion, justice avoidance, organisational orientation, auditing standards setters, structural equations modelling.
