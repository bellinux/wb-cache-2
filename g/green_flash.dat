5|$|An optical phenomenon, {{known as}} a <b>green</b> <b>flash,</b> can {{sometimes}} be seen shortly after sunset or before sunrise. The flash is caused by light from the Sun just below the horizon being bent (usually through a temperature inversion) towards the observer. Light of shorter wavelengths (violet, blue, green) is bent more than that of longer wavelengths (yellow, orange, red) but the violet and blue light is scattered more, leaving light that is perceived as green.|$|E
5|$|The {{content is}} divided into 14 chapters. The first chapter serves as an {{introduction}} and considers the mythological and geological origin of night. The next 12 chapters are each titled after an hour starting with chapter 2's 6 pm and ending with chapter 13's 5 am. Chapter 2 discusses the transition into night, including sunsets, the <b>green</b> <b>flash,</b> the stages of twilight, as well as Olbers' paradox, and a definition of the size and speed of night. The 7 pm chapter deals with nature at night, how animals see and hear differently at night {{with a focus on}} bats, nighthawks, and nocturnal insects. The 8 pm chapter analyzes children's literature and bedtime stories. The 9 pm chapter discusses aspects of the city at night, including the evolution of nightclubs, street lights, and the impacts of light pollution. The 10 pm chapter discusses night festivals around the world and throughout history. The 11 pm chapter explains the circadian rhythm and the physiology of sleep and dreams.|$|E

The [...] wooden tower was erected in 1889 and {{replaced}} with a skeleton tower by 1919. The skeleton tower was further altered to an automatic gas light a few years prior to 1931.

2500|$|George Beamish is also {{credited}} with getting {{the green of}} Ireland represented in the kit currently worn by the British and Irish Lions. On the 1930 tour to New Zealand, {{of which he was}} a member, the tourists wore what was by then the standard blue jerseys. These themselves caused some controversy because the New Zealand side, by then already synonymous with the appellation [...] "All Blacks", had an all black kit that clashed with the Lions' blue. After much reluctance and debate, but having to defer to the rugby custom of accommodating guests, New Zealand agreed to change for the Tests and the All Blacks became the All Whites for the first time. Also on that tour, a delegation led by George Beamish expressed their displeasure at the fact that whilst the blue of Scotland, white of England and red of Wales were represented in the strip there was no green for Ireland. A <b>green</b> <b>flash</b> was added to the socks, which from 1938 became a green turnover and that has remained a feature of the strip ever since.|$|E

Deserts, oceans and ice shelves are probably the best places to observe mirages and therefore green flashes. It is easier not to miss a <b>green</b> <b>flash</b> during sunset than during sunrise. It is especially true regarding an inferior mirage <b>green</b> <b>flash,</b> when the timing should be just right to capture it at sunrise. I could see the sun glowing below the distant horizon. Then, for what seemed like at least a second, the <b>green</b> <b>flash</b> flooded the desert like an alien heliograph. A moment later, the skyline erupted with the instant magnificence of the sun, its sudden warmth. From the above observation {{it is clear that the}} author observed an inferior mirage <b>green</b> <b>flash,</b> when the much warmer surface of the desert with the help of the rising Sun was fighting the cool morning air, producing in the process a <b>green</b> <b>flash</b> - one of nature's great spectacles.|$|E

50|$|The {{intensity}} of the sky varies greatly over the day, and {{the primary cause of}} that intensity differs as well. When the sun is well above the horizon, direct scattering of sunlight (Rayleigh scattering) is the overwhelmingly dominant source of light. However, in twilight, the period of time between sunset and night and between night and sunrise, the situation is more complicated. <b>Green</b> <b>flashes</b> and <b>green</b> rays are optical phenomena that occur shortly after sunset or before sunrise, when a green spot is visible above the sun, usually for no more than a second or two, or it may resemble a green ray shooting up from the sunset point. <b>Green</b> <b>flashes</b> are a group of phenomena that stem from different causes, most of which occur when there is a temperature inversion (when the temperature increases with altitude rather than the normal decrease in temperature with altitude). <b>Green</b> <b>flashes</b> may be observed from any altitude (even from an aircraft). They are usually seen at an unobstructed horizon, such as over the ocean, but are also seen over cloud tops and mountain tops. <b>Green</b> <b>flashes</b> may also be observed at the horizon in association with the Moon and bright planets, including Venus and Jupiter.|$|R
