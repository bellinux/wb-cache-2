"'Well, my lad, I daresay {{the skipper}} will do that, but as we're {{bound for the}} coast of Chili from Hamburg, and ain't likely {{to be there for}} about five months, you've got, as I said, a long voyage before you. If the weather had been fine the skipper might have spoken some ship in the Channel, and put you on board, but before the gale's blown out we shall be {{hundreds}} of miles at sea. Even if it had been fine I don't suppose the skipper would have parted with you, especially if you told him the watch was asleep. He would not care next time he <b>entered</b> <b>an</b> English <b>port</b> <b>to</b> have <b>a</b> claim fixed on his ship for the vally of the smack.' ...|$|R
5|$|Replenishment ships, {{known as}} oilers in the United States and fleet tankers in Commonwealth countries, are ships {{that can provide}} oil {{products}} to naval vessels while on the move. This process, called underway replenishment, extends {{the length of time}} a naval vessel can stay at sea, as well as her effective range. Prior to underway replenishment, naval vessels had <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> <b>a</b> <b>port</b> or anchor <b>to</b> take on fuel. In addition to fuel, replenishment ships may also deliver water, ammunition, rations, stores and personnel.|$|R
5000|$|A {{roadstead}} {{can be an}} area of {{safe anchorage}} for ships waiting <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> <b>a</b> <b>port</b> (or <b>to</b> form <b>a</b> convoy); if sufficiently sheltered and convenient {{it can be used}} for transhipment (or transfer to and from shore by lighters) of goods and stores [...] or troops.In the days of sailing ships, some voyages could only easily be made with a change in wind direction, and ships would wait for a change of wind in a safe anchorage, such as the Downs or Yarmouth Roads. Daniel Defoe has Robinson Crusoe recall an early journey in the coastal trade: [...] "The sixth day of our being at sea we came into Yarmouth Roads; the wind having been contrary, and the weather calm, we had made but little way since the storm. Here we were obliged to come to an anchor, and here we lay, the wind continuing contrary, viz., at southwest, for seven or eight days, during which time a great many ships from Newcastle came into the same Roads..." ...|$|R
40|$|Port and harbour {{security}} {{became an}} issue of growing concern {{in the wake of}} the September 2001 (9 / 11) attacks on the US, the attacks on the naval destroyers USS The Sullivans and USS Cole while tied up in the Port of Aden in Yemen in 2000, and the French oil tanker Limberg in 2002. Prior to these attacks the main focus of port security was often directed at landside threats such as the theft of cargo from containers, warehouses, or ships berthed in port. Securing perimeter fencing to prevent thieves from accessing the port area including warehouses was often the main concern, particularly in <b>ports</b> adjacent <b>to</b> urban areas. Similarly, there is potential for undocumented migrants <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> <b>a</b> <b>port</b> and attempt <b>to</b> stow away on ships, in containers or in trucks parked in the port area...|$|R
5000|$|Mooring under a cliff to a buoy or by anchor, {{the ship}} would receive cargo down an apron chute or, later a wire chute. It usually took {{two days to}} load. All these ports were full of rocks both hidden and exposed. There were undertows and cross-rip {{currents}} and continual changing sandbars. The dog-hole operators obtained franchises to build and manage the chutes. When <b>a</b> ship <b>entered</b> <b>a</b> <b>port,</b> it moored <b>to</b> <b>a</b> buoy (often a log anchored to the bottom) and would be warped or winched into position for loading. A ship’s boat, crewed by three seamen and the second mate, carried the eight inch mooring lines to the buoy. The gravity chutes were troughs allowing cargo to be sent down a cliff to a ship. Besides bagged goods, the chutes were used to load other cargo, such as live hogs.|$|R
