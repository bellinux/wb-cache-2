40|$|In Canada, Crown {{prosecutors}} and the Attorney General {{are not always}} as fair as we expect when making charging decisions, and therefore victims could be personally aggrieved by unfair and unjust <b>decisions</b> <b>not</b> to prosecute. When this happens, victims have limited remedy to redress the unfairness and unjustness in order to uphold their interests in a criminal proceeding. Conversely, the European Union, United Kingdom, and the United State have taken steps to let victims challenge <b>decisions</b> <b>not</b> to prosecute to some extent. Drawing on experiences of the abovementioned jurisdictions, I propose a two-level process of review for <b>decisions</b> <b>not</b> to prosecute [...] Internal Review and Judicial Review [...] in Canada {{in order to provide}} victims a way to have problematic decisions reversed. This proposal can provide a direction or framework for future reform in this area in Canada...|$|R
5|$|MacMillan {{stayed out}} of the matter; he did not attend {{meetings}} of the TSO board and maintained a public silence through {{the spring and summer of}} 1952. According to TSO archivist Warren, MacMillan's correspondence indicates that he supported the board's <b>decision</b> <b>not</b> to rehire the six musicians.|$|E
5|$|Miller was {{unfit to}} bowl during the Second Test at Lord's. During England's first innings, Bradman threw Miller the ball, {{hoping that he}} would reverse his <b>decision</b> <b>not</b> to bowl. Miller refused and {{returned}} the ball, citing his back. Miller's action generated news headlines, with journalists believing that he had disobeyed Bradman.|$|E
5|$|Reasons for the <b>decision</b> <b>not</b> {{to publish}} the {{cartoons}} widely in the United Statesdespite that country's permissive free speech lawsincluded increased religious sensitivity, higher integration of Muslims into mainstream society, {{and a desire to}} be tactful considering the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.|$|E

5|$|The <b>decision</b> <b>not</b> {{to restart}} on-alert bomber {{missions}} {{was also a}} reflection of the strategic decline of manned nuclear weapon delivery in favor of unmanned delivery via ICBMs, which had already eclipsed the number of bombers in the United States by April 1964.|$|E
5|$|The {{tactical}} <b>decision</b> <b>not</b> {{to bring}} cannons forward {{was probably one}} of Abercrombie's most significant errors. The use of cannon against the French works would have cleared paths through the abatis and breached the breastworks.|$|E
5|$|Brown did {{not attend}} the opening {{ceremony}} of the 2008 Summer Olympics on 8 August 2008 in Beijing, and instead attended the closing ceremony on 24 August 2008. Brown had been under intense pressure from human rights campaigners {{to send a message to}} China, concerning the 2008 Tibetan unrest. His <b>decision</b> <b>not</b> to attend the opening ceremony was not an act of protest; the decision was made several weeks in advance of the Games.|$|E

5|$|By 2003, many Turks {{had come}} to see American foreign policy in the region as a threat. Matters were not helped by the {{election}} in 2002 of the Justice and Development Party (AKP). The election of the AKP led to an immediate increase in tensions with America, especially after the Parliament's <b>decision</b> <b>not</b> to send any Turkish troops to Iraq further eroded US-Turkish relations. 70% of the parliament members were Justice and Development Party members.|$|E
5|$|Following his <b>decision</b> <b>not</b> {{to run for}} {{re-election}} as mayor in 1893, three years later, McCauley sought to be Edmonton's representative in the North-West Territories Legislature. During his term as representative, he worked to upgrade Edmonton's school system, along with upgrading the town's trade industry. He served in this capacity until 1902, when he was defeated. During his time, McCauley kept his focus on his development of the school system, introducing a single tax bill intended to give schools boards power to adopt the tax.|$|E
5|$|For long afterwards, Grant and Buell quarreled over Grant's <b>decision</b> <b>not</b> {{to mount}} an {{immediate}} pursuit with another hour of daylight remaining. Grant cited the exhaustion of his troops, although the Confederates were certainly just as exhausted. Part of Grant's reluctance to act {{could have been the}} unusual command relationship he had with Buell. Although Grant was the senior officer and technically was in command of both armies, Buell made it quite clear throughout the two days that he was acting independently.|$|E

5|$|Ford seriously {{considered}} leaving the Senate and {{running for governor}} again in 1983 and 1991, but decided against it both times. In the 1983 contest, he would have faced sitting lieutenant governor Martha Layne Collins in the primary. Collins was a factional ally of Ford's, which influenced his decision. In 1991, Ford cited his seniority in the Senate and desire to become Democratic Senate whip as factors in his <b>decision</b> <b>not</b> to run for governor.|$|E

The protest, led by Black Lives Matter co-founder Alicia Garza, was organized in response to the grand jury <b>decision</b> <b>not</b> to indict Darren Wilson for the death of Mike Brown.|$|E

The namespace name is a character string which must adhere to the generic URI syntax. However, the name is generally {{not considered to be}} a URI, because the URI specification bases the <b>decision</b> <b>not</b> only on lexical components, but also on their intended use. A namespace name does not necessarily imply any of the semantics of URI schemes; for example, a namespace name beginning with http: may have no connotation {{to the use of the}} HTTP.|$|E

50|$|Opportunity {{cost of an}} {{activity}} (or goods) {{is equal to the}} best next alternative uses/forgone.Although opportunity cost can be hard to quantify, the effect of opportunity cost is universal and very real on the individual level.

5000|$|In a {{unanimous}} opinion authored by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, the Court dismissed the writ of certiorari {{for want of}} jurisdiction. Rehnquist wrote that the Florida Supreme Court's <b>decision</b> did <b>not</b> fit any of the categories where the Court [...] "treated state-court judgments as final for jurisdictional purposes although there were further proceedings {{to take place in}} the state court." [...] Thus, the Court concluded that the Florida Supreme Court's <b>decision</b> was <b>not</b> final. This was partly based on a doctrine from the Cox decision which decided that certain <b>decisions</b> were <b>not</b> 'final' when the trial proceedings had not been completed.|$|R
5|$|Keir Starmer, {{director}} of the CPS, announced on 24 May 2011 that a summons for manslaughter had been issued against Harwood. He said the CPS had reviewed its <b>decision</b> <b>not</b> to prosecute because new medical evidence had emerged during the inquest, and because the various medical accounts, including that of the first pathologist, had been tested during questioning. The trial opened on 18 June 2012. Harwood entered a plea of not guilty, and was acquitted on 19 July.|$|E
