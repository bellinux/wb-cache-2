25|$|The {{level of}} water in the steam separators, the {{percentage}} of steam in the reactor pressure tubes, the level at which the water begins to boil in the reactor core, the neutron flux and power distribution in the reactor, and the feedwater flow through the core have to be carefully controlled. The level {{of water in}} the steam separator is mainly controlled by the feedwater supply, with the <b>deaerator</b> tanks serving as a water reservoir.|$|E
25|$|The {{water is}} {{pressurized}} in two stages, and flows {{through a series}} of six or seven intermediate feed water heaters, heated up at each point with steam extracted from an appropriate duct on the turbines and gaining temperature at each stage. Typically, {{in the middle of this}} series of feedwater heaters, and before the second stage of pressurization, the condensate plus the makeup water flows through a <b>deaerator</b> that removes dissolved air from the water, further purifying and reducing its corrosiveness. The water may be dosed following this point with hydrazine, a chemical that removes the remaining oxygen in the water to below 5 parts per billion (ppb). It is also dosed with pH control agents such as ammonia or morpholine to keep the residual acidity low and thus non-corrosive.|$|E
2500|$|A {{thermal power}} station such as Tracy {{converts}} the energy contained in heavy fuel oil into heat, motion, and then into electrical energy. Burning fuel vaporize water and the steam expands to drive a turbine that spins the rotor of an alternator to generate electricity. Condensing water is then reused for another cycle. In the process, water is preheated six times, raising its temperature from [...] to , and goes through a <b>deaerator</b> and an economizer before entering the boiler at a temperature of , close to the boiling point under pressure.|$|E

25|$|The turbine {{consists}} of one high-pressure rotor and four low-pressure ones. Five low-pressure separators-preheaters {{are used to}} heat steam with fresh steam before being fed to {{the next stage of}} the turbine. The uncondensed steam is fed into a condenser, mixed with condensate from the separators, fed by the first-stage condensate pump to a chemical purifier, then by a second-stage condensate pump to four <b>deaerators</b> where dissolved and entrained gases are removed; <b>deaerators</b> also serve as storage tanks for feedwater.

2500|$|The {{performance}} of direct contact heat exchangers operating at typical OTEC boundary conditions {{is important to}} the Claude cycle. Many early Claude cycle designs used a surface condenser since their performance was well understood. However, direct contact condensers offer significant disadvantages. As cold water rises in the intake pipe, the pressure decreases to the point where gas begins to evolve. If a significant amount of gas comes out of solution, placing a gas trap before the direct contact heat exchangers may be justified. Experiments simulating conditions in the warm water intake pipe indicated about 30% of the dissolved gas evolves in the top [...] of the tube. The trade-off between [...] of the seawater and expulsion of non-condensable gases from the condenser is dependent on the gas evolution dynamics, <b>deaerator</b> efficiency, head loss, vent compressor efficiency and parasitic power. Experimental results indicate vertical spout condensers perform some 30% better than falling jet types.|$|E

5000|$|... ==Deaeration of feed water== Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide {{are removed}} from the feed water by deaeration. Deaeration can be {{accomplished}} by using <b>deaerators</b> heaters, vacuum <b>deaerators,</b> mechanical pumps, and steam-jet ejectors. In deaerating heaters steam sprays incoming feed water and carries away the dissolved gases. The <b>deaerators</b> also store hot feed water which is ready {{to be used in the}} boiler. This means of mechanical deaeration is also used with chemical oxygen scavenging agents to increase efficiency. (Sendelbach, p. 129) Deaerating heaters can be classified in to two groups. The two deaerating heaters are spray types and tray types. With tray type deaerating heaters the incoming water is sprayed into steam atmosphere in order to reach saturation temperature. When the saturation temperature is reached most of the oxygen and non-condensable gases are released. There are seals that prevent the recontamination of the water in the spray section. The water then falls to the storage tank below. The non-condensables and oxygen are then vented to the atmosphere. The components of the tray type deaerating heater are a shell, spray nozzles, direct contact vent condenser, tray stacks, and protective interchamber walls. The spray type deaerater is very similar to the tray type deaerater. The water is sprayed into a steam atmosphere and most of the oxygen and non-condensables are released to the steam. The water then falls to the steam scrubber where the slight pressure loss causes the water to flash a little bit which also helps with the removal of oxygen and non-condensables. The water then overflows to the storage tank. The gases are then vented to the atmosphere. With vacuum deaeration a vacuum is applied to the system and water is then brought to its saturation temperature. The water is sprayed in to the tank just like the spray and tray deaeraters. The oxygen and non-condensables are vented to the atmosphere.(Sendelbach, p. 130) ...|$|R

50|$|The typical tray-type <b>deaerator</b> in Figure 1 has a {{vertical}} domed deaeration section mounted above a horizontal boiler feedwater storage vessel. Boiler feedwater enters the vertical deaeration section above the perforated trays and flows downward through the perforations. Low-pressure deaeration steam enters below the perforated trays and flows upward through the perforations. Some designs use {{various types of}} packed bed, rather than perforated trays, to provide good contact and mixing between the steam and the boiler feed water.|$|E
5000|$|With oxygenated treatment, oxygen is {{injected}} into the feedwater to keep the oxygen level between 30-50 ppb. [...] "Common injection points are just after the condensate polisher and again at the <b>deaerator</b> outlet." [...] This forms a thicker protective layer of hematite (Fe2O3) {{on top of the}} magnetite. This is a denser, flatter film (vs. the undulation scale with OT) so that there is less resistance to water flow compared to AVT. [...] Also, OT reduces the risk of flow-accelerated corrosion.|$|E

This kind of heater will normally require a feed pump at both the feed inlet and outlet since the pressure in the heater is between the boiler pressure and the condenser pressure. A <b>deaerator</b> is a special case of the open feedwater heater which is specifically designed to remove non-condensable gases from the feedwater.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Spring nozzles {{are widely}} used in <b>deaerators.</b> The spray issued from a spring nozzle was studied numerically with an adapted volume of fluid method {{combined}} with a continuous surface force model to capture the gas–liquid interface dynamics. The present analysis focuses on {{the formation of a}} water film and the generation of droplets near the spring nozzle outlet. The numerical simulation results show that the water film breaks up to droplets at the location 20 ~ 25 cm from the nozzle exit vertically. The vortical structures are formed due to the interaction between the liquid film and the surrounding air, which leads to air recirculation and water film instability. When the inlet water velocity decreases from 5. 33 m/s to 4. 1 m/s, it results in a slightly reduced spray angle. But the vertical break up length is not obviously influenced. The water sheet disintegration is probably at the transition state between Rayleigh and first wind-induced breakup regimes...|$|R
