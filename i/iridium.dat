5|$|Very {{little is}} known about the {{toxicity}} of <b>iridium</b> compounds because they are used in very small amounts, but soluble salts, such as the <b>iridium</b> halides, could be hazardous due to elements other than <b>iridium</b> or due to <b>iridium</b> itself. However, most <b>iridium</b> compounds are insoluble, which makes absorption into the body difficult.|$|E
5|$|Another use {{concerns}} X-ray optics, especially X-ray telescopes. The mirrors of the Chandra X-ray Observatory are {{coated with}} a layer of <b>iridium</b> 60nm thick. <b>Iridium</b> proved to be the best choice for reflecting X-rays after nickel, gold, and platinum were also tested. The <b>iridium</b> layer, which had to be smooth to within a few atoms, was applied by depositing <b>iridium</b> vapor under high vacuum on a base layer of chromium.|$|E
5|$|Corrosion {{and heat}} {{resistance}} makes <b>iridium</b> an important alloying agent. Certain long-life aircraft engine parts {{are made of}} an <b>iridium</b> alloy, and an iridium–titanium alloy is used for deep-water pipes because of its corrosion resistance. <b>Iridium</b> is also used as a hardening agent in platinum alloys. The Vickers hardness of pure platinum is 56HV, whereas platinum with 50% of <b>iridium</b> can reach over 500HV.|$|E
5|$|In 1880, one John Holland of Cincinnati {{discovered}} {{the ability to}} melt and make castings of <b>iridium</b> by fusing the white-hot ore with phosphorus, and patented the process in the United States. He invoked the help of Dudley in {{getting rid of the}} phosphorus, who did so by repeated applications of lime at great heat. This was the first reported method of refining <b>iridium.</b> Dudley then found new applications for <b>iridium,</b> and formed the American <b>Iridium</b> Company with Holland. Dudley filed a patent on his method for <b>iridium</b> electroplating in 1887.|$|E
5|$|<b>Iridium</b> in bulk {{metallic}} form is not biologically {{important or}} hazardous to health {{due to its}} lack of reactivity with tissues; {{there are only about}} 20parts per trillion of <b>iridium</b> in human tissue. Like most metals, finely divided <b>iridium</b> powder can be hazardous to handle, as it is an irritant and may ignite in air.|$|E
5|$|<b>Iridium</b> is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Ir and atomic number 77. A very hard, brittle, silvery-white transition metal of the platinum group, <b>iridium</b> is generally credited {{with being the}} second densest element (after osmium). It {{is also the most}} corrosion-resistant metal, even at temperatures as high as 2000°C. Although only certain molten salts and halogens are corrosive to solid <b>iridium,</b> finely divided <b>iridium</b> dust is much more reactive and can be flammable.|$|E
5|$|<b>Iridium</b> {{is one of}} {{the nine}} least {{abundant}} stable elements in Earth's crust, having an average mass fraction of 0.001ppm in crustal rock; gold is 40 times more abundant, platinum is 10 times more abundant, and silver and mercury are 80 times more abundant. Tellurium is about as abundant as <b>iridium.</b> In contrast to its low abundance in crustal rock, <b>iridium</b> is relatively common in meteorites, with concentrations of 0.5ppm or more. The overall concentration of <b>iridium</b> on Earth is thought to be much higher than what is observed in crustal rocks, but because of the density and siderophilic ("iron-loving") character of <b>iridium,</b> it descended below the crust and into Earth's core when the planet was still molten.|$|E
5|$|<b>Iridium</b> was {{discovered}} in 1803 among insoluble impurities in natural platinum. Smithson Tennant, the primary discoverer, named <b>iridium</b> for the Greek goddess Iris, personification of the rainbow, because of the striking and diverse colors of its salts. <b>Iridium</b> {{is one of the}} rarest elements in Earth's crust, with annual production and consumption of only three tonnes. 191Ir and 193Ir are the only two naturally occurring isotopes of <b>iridium,</b> as well as the only stable isotopes; the latter is the more abundant of the two.|$|E
5|$|It {{is thought}} that {{the total amount of}} <b>iridium</b> in the planet Earth is much higher than that {{observed}} in crustal rocks, but as with other platinum-group metals, the high density and tendency of <b>iridium</b> to bond with iron caused most <b>iridium</b> to descend below the crust when the planet was young and still molten.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} <b>iridium</b> compounds in use are the salts and acids it forms with chlorine, though <b>iridium</b> also forms {{a number of}} organometallic compounds used in industrial catalysis, and in research. <b>Iridium</b> metal is employed when high corrosion resistance at high temperatures is needed, as in high-performance spark plugs, crucibles for recrystallization of semiconductors at high temperatures, and electrodes {{for the production of}} chlorine in the chloralkali process. <b>Iridium</b> radioisotopes are used in some radioisotope thermoelectric generators.|$|E
5|$|Enolate {{trapping}} {{with various}} electrophiles is decidedly less common. In one study, the Nazarov cyclization is {{paired with a}} Michael reaction using an <b>iridium</b> catalyst to initiate nucleophilic conjugate addition of the enolate to β-nitrostyrene. In this tandem reaction the <b>iridium</b> catalyst is required for both conversions: it acts as the Lewis acid in the Nazarov cyclization {{and in the next}} step the nitro group of nitrostyrene first coordinates to <b>iridium</b> in a ligand exchange with the carbonyl ester oxygen atom before the actual Michael addition takes place to the opposite face of the R-group.|$|E
5|$|<b>Iridium</b> forms {{a variety}} of {{complexes}} of fundamental interest in triplet harvesting.|$|E
5|$|<b>Iridium</b> {{has been}} used in the {{radioisotope}} thermoelectric generators of unmanned spacecraft such as the Voyager, Viking, Pioneer, Cassini, Galileo, and New Horizons. <b>Iridium</b> was chosen to encapsulate the plutonium-238 fuel in the generator because it can withstand the operating temperatures of up to 2000°C and for its great strength.|$|E
5|$|<b>Iridium</b> {{is found}} in meteorites in much higher {{abundance}} than in the Earth's crust. For this reason, the unusually high abundance of <b>iridium</b> in the clay layer at the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary {{gave rise to the}} Alvarez hypothesis that the impact of a massive extraterrestrial object caused the extinction of dinosaurs and many other species 66million years ago. Similarly, an <b>iridium</b> anomaly in core samples from the Pacific Ocean suggested the Eltanin impact of about 2.5 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|The Cretaceous–Paleogene {{boundary}} of 66 million years ago, marking the temporal {{border between the}} Cretaceous and Paleogene periods of geological time, was identified by a thin stratum of iridium-rich clay. A team led by Luis Alvarez proposed in 1980 an extraterrestrial origin for this <b>iridium,</b> attributing it to an asteroid or comet impact. Their theory, known as the Alvarez hypothesis, is now widely accepted to explain the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs. A large buried impact crater structure with an estimated age of about 66 million years was later identified under {{what is now the}} Yucatán Peninsula (the Chicxulub crater). Dewey M. McLean and others argue that the <b>iridium</b> may have been of volcanic origin instead, because Earth's core is rich in <b>iridium,</b> and active volcanoes such as Piton de la Fournaise, in the island of Réunion, are still releasing <b>iridium.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{demand for}} <b>iridium</b> surged from 2.5 tonnes in 2009 to 10.4 tonnes in 2010, {{mostly because of}} electronics-related {{applications}} that saw a rise from 0.2 to 6 tonnes – <b>iridium</b> crucibles are commonly used for growing large high-quality single crystals, demand for which has increased sharply. This increase in <b>iridium</b> consumption is predicted to saturate due to accumulating stocks of crucibles, as happened earlier in the 2000s. Other major applications include spark plugs that consumed 0.78 tonnes of <b>iridium</b> in 2007, electrodes for the chloralkali process (1.1 t in 2007) and chemical catalysts (0.75 t in 2007).|$|E
5|$|The main {{evidence}} of such an impact, besides the crater itself, is contained in {{a thin layer of}} clay present in the K–Pg boundary across the world. In the late 1970s, the Alvarezes and colleagues reported that it contained an abnormally high concentration of <b>iridium.</b> <b>Iridium</b> levels in this layer reached 6 parts per billion by weight or more compared to 0.4 for the Earth's crust as a whole; in comparison, meteorites can contain around 470 parts per billion of this element. It was hypothesized that the <b>iridium</b> was spread into the atmosphere when the impactor was vaporized and settled across the Earth's surface amongst other material thrown up by the impact, producing the layer of iridium-enriched clay. Similarly, an <b>iridium</b> anomaly in core samples from the Pacific Ocean suggested the Eltanin impact of about 2.5 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|These extreme {{difficulties}} in melting the metal limited {{the possibilities for}} handling <b>iridium.</b> John Isaac Hawkins was looking to obtain a fine and hard point for fountain pen nibs, and in 1834 managed to create an iridium-pointed gold pen. In 1880, John Holland and William Lofland Dudley were able to melt <b>iridium</b> by adding phosphorus and patented the process in the United States; British company Johnson Matthey later stated they had been using a similar process since 1837 and had already presented fused <b>iridium</b> {{at a number of}} World Fairs. The first use of an alloy of <b>iridium</b> with ruthenium in thermocouples was made by Otto Feussner in 1933. These allowed for the measurement of high temperatures in air up to 2000°C.|$|E
5|$|Devices {{that must}} {{withstand}} extremely high temperatures are often made from <b>iridium.</b> For example, high-temperature crucibles made of <b>iridium</b> {{are used in}} the Czochralski process to produce oxide single-crystals (such as sapphires) for use in computer memory devices and in solid state lasers. The crystals, such as gadolinium gallium garnet and yttrium gallium garnet, are grown by melting pre-sintered charges of mixed oxides under oxidizing conditions at temperatures up to 2100°C.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, {{a team of}} {{researchers}} consisting of Nobel Prize–winning physicist Luis Alvarez, his son geologist Walter Alvarez, and chemists Frank Asaro and Helen Michel discovered that sedimentary layers found all over the world at the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary contain a concentration of <b>iridium</b> many times greater than normal (30, 160, and 20 times in three sections originally studied). <b>Iridium</b> is extremely rare in Earth's crust because it is a siderophile element, and therefore, most of it traveled with the iron as it sank into Earth's core during planetary differentiation. As <b>iridium</b> remains abundant in most asteroids and comets, the Alvarez team suggested that an asteroid struck the Earth {{at the time of the}} K–Pg boundary. There were earlier speculations on the possibility of an impact event, but this was the first hard evidence of an impact.|$|E
5|$|In the {{periodic}} table, meitnerium is a d-block transactinide element. It {{is a member}} of the 7th period and is placed in the group 9 elements, although no chemical experiments have yet been carried out to confirm that it behaves as the heavier homologue to <b>iridium</b> in group 9 as the seventh member of the 6d series of transition metals. Meitnerium is calculated to have similar properties to its lighter homologues, cobalt, rhodium, and <b>iridium.</b>|$|E
5|$|Interstitial {{radium therapy}} was {{common in the}} 1930s. Gold seeds filled with radon were used as early as 1942 until at least 1958. Gold shells were {{selected}} by Gino Failla around 1920 to shield beta rays while passing gamma rays. Cobalt needles were also used briefly after world war II. Radon and cobalt were replaced by radioactive tantalum and gold, before <b>iridium</b> rose in prominence. First used in 1958, <b>iridium</b> is {{the most commonly used}} artificial source for brachytherapy today.|$|E
5|$|<b>Iridium</b> {{compounds}} {{are used}} as catalysts in the Cativa process for carbonylation of methanol to produce acetic acid.|$|E
5|$|<b>Iridium</b> {{is used in}} {{particle}} physics {{for the production of}} antiprotons, a form of antimatter. Antiprotons are made by shooting a high-intensity proton beam at a conversion target, which needs to be made from a very high density material. Although tungsten may be used instead, <b>iridium</b> has the advantage of better stability under the shock waves induced by the temperature rise due to the incident beam.|$|E
5|$|Osmium {{is found}} in nature as an uncombined element or in natural alloys; {{especially}} the iridium–osmium alloys, osmiridium (osmium rich), and iridosmium (<b>iridium</b> rich). In nickel and copper deposits, the platinum group metals occur as sulfides (i.e., (Pt,Pd)S)), tellurides (e.g., PtBiTe), antimonides (e.g., PdSb), and arsenides (e.g., PtAs2); in all these compounds platinum is exchanged by {{a small amount of}} <b>iridium</b> and osmium. As with all of the platinum group metals, osmium can be found naturally in alloys with nickel or copper.|$|E
5|$|Prediction of the {{probable}} chemical properties of meitnerium {{has not received}} much attention recently. Meitnerium {{is expected to be}} a noble metal. Based on the most stable oxidation states of the lighter group 9 elements, the most stable oxidation states of meitnerium are predicted to be the +6, +3, and +1 states, with the +3 state being the most stable in aqueous solutions. In comparison, rhodium and <b>iridium</b> show a maximum oxidation state of +6, while the most stable states are +4 and +3 for <b>iridium</b> and +3 for rhodium. The oxidation state +9, represented only by <b>iridium</b> in +, might be possible for its congener meitnerium in the nonafluoride (MtF9) and the + cation, although + is expected to be more stable than these meitnerium compounds. The tetrahalides of meitnerium have also been predicted to have similar stabilities to those of <b>iridium,</b> thus also allowing a stable +4 state. It is further expected that the maximum oxidation states of elements from bohrium (element 107) to darmstadtium (element 110) may be stable in the gas phase but not in aqueous solution.|$|E
5|$|The high melting point, {{hardness}} and {{corrosion resistance}} of <b>iridium</b> and its alloys determine {{most of its}} applications. <b>Iridium</b> and especially iridium–platinum alloys or osmium–iridium alloys have a low wear and are used, for example, for multi-pored spinnerets, through which a plastic polymer melt is extruded to form fibers, such as rayon. Osmium–iridium is used for compass bearings and for balances.|$|E
5|$|The {{measured}} {{density of}} <b>iridium</b> {{is only slightly}} lower (by about 0.12%) than that of osmium, the densest element known. Some ambiguity occurred regarding {{which of the two}} elements was denser, due to the small size of the difference in density and difficulties in measuring it accurately, but, with increased accuracy in factors used for calculating density X-ray crystallographic data yielded densities of 22.56g/cm3 for <b>iridium</b> and 22.59g/cm3 for osmium.|$|E
5|$|Their {{resistance}} to arc erosion makes <b>iridium</b> alloys ideal for electrical contacts for spark plugs, and iridium-based spark plugs are particularly used in aviation.|$|E
5|$|<b>Iridium</b> {{complexes}} {{are being}} investigated as catalysts for asymmetric hydrogenation. These catalysts {{have been used}} in the synthesis of natural products and able to hydrogenate certain difficult substrates, such as unfunctionalized alkenes, enantioselectively (generating only one of the two possible enantiomers).|$|E
5|$|<b>Iridium</b> {{is a good}} {{catalyst}} for the decomposition of hydrazine (into hot nitrogen and ammonia), and this is used in practice in low-thrust rocket engines; there are more details in the monopropellant rocket article.|$|E
5|$|Meitnerium is {{the seventh}} {{member of the}} 6d series of {{transition}} metals. Since element 112 (copernicium) {{has been shown to}} be a transition metal, it is expected that all the elements from 104 to 112 would continue a fourth transition metal series, with meitnerium as part of the platinum group metals. Calculations on its ionization potentials and atomic and ionic radii are similar to that of its lighter homologue <b>iridium,</b> thus implying that meitnerium's basic properties will resemble those of the other group 9 elements, cobalt, rhodium, and <b>iridium.</b>|$|E
5|$|The K-T {{boundary}} {{is associated}} with abnormally high amounts of <b>iridium,</b> an element which is rare in Earth's crust, but relatively common in asteroids and in Earth's core. This {{has been used as}} evidence that a meteorite impact caused the extinction of the dinosaurs (the Alvarez hypothesis). However, some paleontologists attribute the extinction event and the <b>iridium</b> anomaly to more gradual climatic change caused by the volcanic activity of the Deccan Traps. The Nanxiong Basin has special relevance to this discussion because it contains the K-T boundary. However, the position of boundary, as well as the duration of the extinction have been subject to debate. Zhao et al. (2002 and 2009) have postulated that there were at least two iridium-delivering events over a time period consistent with the Deccan Traps volcanism, correlated with a gradual decline in diversity and eventual disappearance of fossil eggs from the Nanxiong Basin. According to their interpretation, Macroolithus survived 250,000 years into the early Paleocene. However, Buck et al. (2004) disputed these claims, arguing that debris flows mixed and reworked the sediments near the boundary, causing a blurring of the <b>iridium</b> anomaly and the appearance of eggshell fragments on both sides.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of <b>iridium</b> is intertwined {{with that of}} platinum and the other metals of the platinum group. Native platinum used by ancient Ethiopians and by South American cultures always contained {{a small amount of}} the other platinum group metals, including <b>iridium.</b> Platinum reached Europe as platina ("silverette"), found in the 17th century by the Spanish conquerors in a region today known as the department of Chocó in Colombia. The discovery that this metal was not an alloy of known elements, but instead a distinct new element, did not occur until 1748.|$|E
5|$|Theoreticians have {{predicted}} the covalent radius of meitnerium to be 6 to 10pm {{larger than that}} of <b>iridium.</b> The atomic radius of meitnerium {{is expected to be}} around 128pm.|$|E
5|$|An alloy of 90% {{platinum}} and 10% <b>iridium</b> {{was used}} in 1889 to construct the International Prototype Metre and kilogram mass, kept by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures near Paris. The meter bar was replaced as {{the definition of the}} fundamental unit of length in 1960 by a line in the atomic spectrum of krypton, but the kilogram prototype is still the international standard of mass.|$|E
