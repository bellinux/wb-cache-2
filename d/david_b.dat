5|$|I. lakotaensis was {{described}} by <b>David</b> <b>B.</b> Weishampel and Philip R. Bjork in 1989. The only well-accepted North American species of Iguanodon, I. lakotaensis {{was described}} from a partial skull from the Barremian-age Lower Cretaceous Lakota Formation of South Dakota. Its assignment has been controversial. Some researchers suggest {{that it was more}} basal than I. bernissartensis, and related to Theiophytalia, but David Norman has suggested that it was a synonym of I. bernissartensis. Gregory S. Paul has since given the species its own genus, Dakotadon.|$|E

5|$|Parker {{also became}} active with the Democratic Party {{and was an}} early {{supporter}} of future New York governor and US President Grover Cleveland. He served as a delegate to the 1884 Democratic National Convention, at which Cleveland was named the party's presidential nominee; Cleveland went on to narrowly defeat Republican James G. Blaine in the fall election. During this time, Parker also became a protege of <b>David</b> <b>B.</b> Hill, managing Hill's 1884 gubernatorial campaign; Hill won in a landslide.|$|E
5|$|The Republicans campaigned {{heavily on}} the tariff issue, turning out {{protectionist}} voters in the important industrial states of the North. Further, the Democrats in New York were divided over the gubernatorial candidacy of <b>David</b> <b>B.</b> Hill, weakening Cleveland's support in that swing state. A letter from the British ambassador supporting Cleveland caused a scandal which cost Cleveland votes in New York.|$|E
5|$|When released, Raptor Red was {{generally}} praised: Bakker's anthropomorphism {{was seen as}} a unique and positive aspect of the book, and his writing was described as folksy and heartfelt. Criticisms of the novel included a perceived lack of characterization and average writing. Some scientists, such as paleontologist <b>David</b> <b>B.</b> Norman, took issue with the scientific theories portrayed in the novel, fearing that the public would accept them as fact, while Discovery Channel host Jay Ingram defended Bakker's creative decisions in an editorial.|$|E

5|$|At a {{press conference}} in September 1985, Rajneesh accused several of his {{followers}} of participation in this and other crimes, including an aborted plan in 1985 to assassinate a United States Attorney, and he asked State and Federal authorities to investigate. Oregon Attorney General <b>David</b> <b>B.</b> Frohnmayer set up an Interagency Task Force, composed of Oregon State Police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and executed search warrants in Rajneeshpuram. A sample of bacteria matching the contaminant that had sickened the town residents was found in a Rajneeshpuram medical laboratory. Two leading Rajneeshpuram officials were convicted on charges of attempted murder and served 29months of 20-year sentences in a minimum-security federal prison.|$|E
5|$|Boyd {{was born}} on 17 March 1944, in Taunton, Somerset, {{and was the first}} child to Colin Ian Langdon Boyd, and Diana Frances Boyd (née Drysdale). The Boyds moved to West Lothian, Scotland, where her brother, Colin, was born in 1946. They then moved to Guildford, Surrey, where her sister, Jenny Boyd, was born in 1947. Boyd's {{youngest}} sister, Paula, was born at a hospital in Nakuru, Kenya, in 1951; the Boyds lived in Nairobi from 1948 to 1953, after her father's discharge from the Royal Air Force. The family returned to England where Boyd gained two half brothers, <b>David</b> (<b>b.</b> 1954) and Robert Jr. (b. 1955).|$|E
5|$|Cleveland's {{trouble with}} the Senate {{hindered}} {{the success of his}} nominations to the Supreme Court in his second term. In 1893, after the death of Samuel Blatchford, Cleveland nominated William B. Hornblower to the Court. Hornblower, the head of a New York City law firm, was thought to be a qualified appointee, but his campaign against a New York machine politician had made Senator <b>David</b> <b>B.</b> Hill his enemy. Further, Cleveland had not consulted the Senators before naming his appointee, leaving many who were already opposed to Cleveland on other grounds even more aggrieved. The Senate rejected Hornblower's nomination on January 15, 1894, by a vote of 30 to 24.|$|E

5|$|In Kirkland's initial {{description}} of Eolambia, he considered {{it to be}} a member of the Hadrosauridae, as defined by <b>David</b> <b>B.</b> Weishampel, <b>David</b> <b>B.</b> Norman, and Dan Grigorescu in 1993. Weishampel and colleagues used seven unifying characteristics to define the Hadrosauridae: the upward expansion of the ascending process of the maxilla; the absence of the paraquadrate foramen, which separates the quadrate and quadratojugal; the location of the angular on the inner surface of the lower jaw; the absence of the surangular foramen on the surangular; the narrow teeth of the maxilla; the presence of three or more teeth in each dentary tooth position; and the reduction of the top margin of the scapular blade. The first, fifth, sixth, and seventh of these traits were recognized in Eolambia, with the rest being unknown due to missing material. Kirkland further assigned Eolambia to the Euhadrosauria, defined by Weishampel and colleagues to include the common ancestor of Hadrosaurinae (now the Saurolophinae) and Lambeosaurinae – the two primary branches of hadrosaurids – and all of its descendants. This assignment was based on five characteristics, all present in Eolambia: the presence of denticles on the premaxilla; the quadrate's narrow joint with the lower jaw; the narrow dentary teeth; the presence of a single edge, or carina, on each dentary tooth; and the angled deltopectoral crest on the humerus.|$|E

5|$|Research by Matthew Baron, <b>David</b> <b>B.</b> Norman, and Paul M. Barrett in 2017 {{suggested}} a radical revision of dinosaurian systematics. Phylogenetic analysis by Baron et al. recovered the Ornithischia as being {{closer to the}} Theropoda than the Sauropodomorpha, {{as opposed to the}} traditional union of theropods with sauropodomorphs. They resurrected the clade Ornithoscelida to refer to the group containing Ornithischia and Theropoda. Dinosauria itself was re-defined as the last common ancestor of Triceratops horridus, Passer domesticus, Diplodocus carnegii, and all of its descendants, to ensure that sauropods and kin remain included as dinosaurs.|$|E
