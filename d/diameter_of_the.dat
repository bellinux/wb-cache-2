5|$|The size of {{the welding}} torch nozzle depends {{on the amount of}} {{shielded}} area desired. The {{size of the}} gas nozzle depends upon the <b>diameter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> electrode, the joint configuration, and the availability of access to the joint by the welder. The inside <b>diameter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nozzle is preferably at least three times the <b>diameter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> electrode, but there are no hard rules. The welder judges the effectiveness of the shielding and increases the nozzle size to increase the area protected by the external gas shield as needed. The nozzle must be heat resistant and thus is normally made of alumina or a ceramic material, but fused quartz, a high purity glass, offers greater visibility. Devices can be inserted into the nozzle for special applications, such as gas lenses or valves to improve the control shielding gas flow to reduce turbulence and introduction of contaminated atmosphere into the shielded area. Hand switches to control welding current can be added to the manual GTAW torches.|$|E

5|$|The account {{published}} in Journal des sçavans {{was based on}} a report that Rømer read to the French Academy of Sciences in November 1676 (Cohen, 1940, p.346). When measured from Earth, the periods of moons orbiting a distant planet are shorter when the Earth is approaching the planet than when the Earth is receding from it. The distance travelled by light from the planet (or its moon) to Earth is shorter when the Earth is at the point in its orbit that is closest to its planet than when the Earth is at the farthest point in its orbit, the difference in distance being the <b>diameter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Earth's orbit around the Sun. The observed change in the moon's orbital period is caused by the difference {{in the time it takes}} light to traverse the shorter or longer distance. Rømer observed this effect for Jupiter's innermost moon Io and deduced that light takes 22 minutes to cross the <b>diameter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Earth's orbit.|$|E

5|$|A {{disturbance}} {{associated with}} the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) left the coast of West Africa on August 9, producing mid-level winds of 75mph (120km/h) in Dakar, Senegal.

The disturbance moved slowly westward over the Atlantic Ocean, developing into a tropical depression at 18:00 UTC on August12, around the 10th parallel north, an unusually southern latitude the cyclone would remain around throughout its lifetime. On August13, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Alma about 375mi (605km) east of Trinidad and Tobago, as indicated by a Hurricane Hunters flight reporting winds of 65mph (105km/h).

5|$|In 1614, German {{astronomer}} Johannes Kepler {{determined that}} {{a series of three}} conjunctions of the planets Jupiter and Saturn occurred in the year 7 BC. He argued (incorrectly) that a planetary conjunction could create a nova, which he linked to the Star of Bethlehem. Modern calculations show that there was a gap of nearly a degree (approximately twice a <b>diameter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> moon) between the planets, so these conjunctions were not visually impressive. An ancient almanac has been found in Babylon which covers the events of this period, but does not indicate that the conjunctions were of any special interest. In the 20th century, Prof. Karlis Kaufmanis, an astronomer, argued that this was an astronomical event where Jupiter and Saturn were in a triple conjunction in the constellation Pisces. Archaeologist and Assyriologist Simo Parpola has also suggested this explanation.|$|E
