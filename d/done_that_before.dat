5|$|The Aniplex {{producer}} of Angel Beats!, Hironori Toba, was interviewed in the November 2009 issue of Dengeki G's Magazine, where he commented that a 13-episode anime with about 21 minutes per episode {{was not enough}} to tell the whole story of Angel Beats! Maeda had envisioned. Therefore, the various additional media, such as the illustrated short stories and manga, contain some of the story that was unable to make it into the anime because of time constraints. Toba wanted fans of the series to be able to enjoy it to the fullest by exploring all of the media types. Maeda found it tiring to go back and forth between Osaka and Tokyo for business meetings {{when he was in the}} process of writing the script, and found it difficult to write an entire script by himself, since he had never <b>done</b> <b>that</b> <b>before</b> with any of the games he produced as a member of Key. It was only after the script was done that Maeda was able to work on the music, which he greatly enjoyed and never tired of it. Maeda composed about 15 songs for Girls Dead Monster and spent about two days each composing each song. He made sure to create songs for Girls Dead Monster that high school girls would compose, including the lyrics. Due to this, Maeda pointed out that the opening and ending theme songs for Angel Beats!, which Maeda also composed, sound like they were composed by a different person compared to the Girls Dead Monster songs.|$|E

But to me anyway — and obviously I wrote it so maybe I'm biased, but — it's not a sappy love song. ... We've never <b>done</b> <b>that</b> <b>before,</b> and honestly I don't {{have a whole lot}} of experience writing love songs, or anyways lyrics that are like this." ...|$|E
500|$|There {{was this}} one time where I {{had to take a}} blind lady across the street and I’d never <b>done</b> <b>that</b> <b>before.</b> I took her hand which is so {{obviously}} wrong! You don’t take a stranger’s hand! Like a 45-year-old woman! But once you take someone’s hand you can’t just let go because then you’re admitting your own awkwardness. I just held her hand {{and in the middle of}} the street she turns around and is like, ‘Do you mind if we don’t hold hands.’ ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I <b>did</b> <b>that</b> <b>before</b> I {{left the}} homestead. There's {{nobody in the}} picture like the fellow who drove with Mr. Grant, and {{he tells me he}} saw nobody else. Now I must be getting on." ...|$|R
500|$|On July 26, 2002, {{only a week}} or {{two before}} signing a record {{contract}} with Universal South Records, West had an injury to his left arm which threatened his musical career and guitar playing. He says, [...] "I locked myself out of my house. But I'd <b>done</b> <b>that</b> <b>before,</b> and I had a way of breaking in through a window. But this time, I had a really hard time getting the window open. I started pushing up on the window really hard and my hand broke through the glass. Blood starting spewing out of my left arm everywhere and I ran down my street screaming for help. After seeing so much blood, I went into shock and just blacked {{out in the middle of}} the street. The next thing I can remember is some construction workers praying over me in Spanish and then being taken to the hospital." [...] West was told that the chances were low of regaining the full use of his left arm, having come very close to severing a major artery. He recovered after the accident, however, and was able to continue playing guitar and record for his first studio album.|$|E
500|$|Vancouver won {{the first}} game of the series in Chicago 2–1 in double overtime, but fell behind in game two 3–1. During the game the Canucks felt that referee Bob Myers was making {{questionable}} calls against them. A series of events in the third period ignited tempers. First, Vancouver had a goal disallowed. Soon after, there was a perceived non-call against Chicago, followed by a fourth consecutive penalty called against the Canucks. Denis Savard scored on the power play to put the Black Hawks up 4–1. This enraged the Canucks' bench. Assistant coach Ron Smith yelled out [...] "We give up, we surrender, we give up." [...] Williams suggested to Neilson that he throw sticks onto the ice in protest. Neilson noted that he had <b>done</b> <b>that</b> <b>before,</b> and he had a better idea. He proceeded to take a white towel and place it on the end of a hockey stick holding it up in a mock surrender; some of the Canucks' players followed suit.Neilson was ejected from the game along with two players. Vancouver goaltender, Richard Brodeur later noted that although they lost the game the atmosphere in the dressing room was so positive it was as if they had won.|$|E
500|$|The song, {{which was}} the last one written for the album, was placed {{at the end of the}} album because it [...] "marks a new beginning" [...] for the band, {{which was the}} theme on the album and a theme in Lee's life. In the booklet of The Open Door, she stated that her long-time friend and husband, Josh Hartzler, was the main {{inspiration}} for the song. In the booklet she wrote, [...] "Josh, you are my muse. Nothing inspires me the way you do. Thank you for all my missing pieces. Thank you for your strength and love. Thank you for letting me see myself through your eyes, because only then could I know that I am good enough for you." [...] One of the band's previous singles, [...] "Bring Me to Life", was also written about Josh Hartzler. In an interview with VH1, Lee further revealed the inspiration behind the song, saying [...] "I had gone through a lot of difficult things during the writing of the whole album, and by the end of it, I had stepped away from those bad situations. That's really hard. You have to be really brave and strong about it. After doing that, I felt so amazing. For the first time I felt like I could write a song based on how good I felt. I have never <b>done</b> <b>that</b> <b>before</b> ever. During another interview with The Washington Post she stated: ...|$|E

2500|$|We {{took the}} prisoners {{to the high}} hills above Evin. They were blind-folded and their hands were tied. We got them off the minibus and had them sit on the ground. Then, Attarpour told them that, just as your friends have killed our comrades, we have decided to execute you—the brain behind those executions. Jazani and the others began protesting. I {{do not know whether}} it was Attarpour or Colonel Vaziri who first pulled out a machine gun and started {{shooting}} them. I do not remember whether I was the 4th or 5th person to whom they gave the machine gun. I had never <b>done</b> <b>that</b> <b>before.</b> At the end, Sa'di Jalil Esfahani [...] shot them in their heads [...]|$|E
2500|$|Dan Brown {{repeatedly}} {{said in his}} defense that history cannot be plagiarized and therefore the accusations of the two authors were false. Leigh stated, [...] "It's not that Dan Brown has lifted certain ideas because {{a number of people}} have <b>done</b> <b>that</b> <b>before.</b> It's rather that he's lifted the whole architecture – the whole jigsaw puzzle – and hung it on to the peg of a fictional thriller". Dan Brown has admitted some of the ideas taken from Baigent and Leigh's work were indispensable to the book but stated that there were many other sources also behind it. However, he claimed that neither he nor his wife had read Baigent and Leigh's book when he produced his original [...] "synopsis" [...] of the novel. Among Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh's arguments were that the given name of the character Sir Leigh Teabing's is the same of Richard Leigh's surname, and that [...] "Teabing" [...] is an anagram of [...] "Baigent".|$|E
2500|$|On August 8, 1996, the Los Angeles Daily News {{announced}} that Jon Seda and Edward James Olmos {{had joined the}} cast as Chris Perez and Abraham Quintanilla, respectively. After Lopez received the role, she decided to stay with Suzette at her home to study her character in the recordings and footage the family shared with her. Lopez felt that her [...] "spirit and [...] spirit were so similar" [...] which was echoed by the singer's family who found that Lopez mimicked similar personality traits of Selena. They believed that Lopez' body language, laugh, and how she talked were identical to that of Selena's. Lopez had constant dance rehearsals for the film and said how she would arrive at the studio {{late in the day}} after finishing filming for another role. The family often had the entire main cast of the film over for dinner and would notice how they would watch them in their interactions with each other and the way they ate. Edward James Olmos, who took the role as Abraham, was asked to gain [...] for the film. The cast found Olmos to be a father figure for them and often gave advice to the cast during filming. A.B., found Olmos' portrayal of his father to be convincing especially in the scene where Abraham was angered after finding out about Selena and Perez' relationship. Suzette discovered that Jackie Guerra, who played her in the film, constantly fixed her fitted and asked her family if she had <b>done</b> <b>that</b> <b>before</b> in which the family replied that she unknowingly does so. Band member Pete Astudillo, had to do a screen test of himself for the film and said how he had to improvised in several of his scenes since he had little dialogue in the film. American actor Jon Seda portrayed Chris Perez in the film and often spent time with Perez for character development. Seda said how he had spent time with Perez at the home he shared with Selena and found a price sticker in the bathroom with a scribbled letter that read [...] "Selena and Chris, I Love You" [...] and expressed on how that further inspired him to [...] "show the love they [...] had" [...] in the film. The biographical film focused on Selena's life rather than her death. Nava said, [...] "I don't want to attend to [...] ", while her death is treated [...] "at a distance".|$|E

6000|$|As for Miriam, she overflowed with delight. The ocean was grand, but Cobhurst was Cobhurst. [...] "There {{was nothing}} better about my trip than the {{opportunity}} {{it gave me}} of coming back to my home. I never <b>did</b> <b>that</b> <b>before,</b> you know, my children." ...|$|R
5000|$|What {{you want}} from life comes from other people. If {{you want to be}} admired, {{respected}} or loved, it will entirely come though other people. Never through material things.

6000|$|... "It {{came upon}} me little by little. I came {{to like the}} life here, with its ease and its leisure, and the people, with their good-nature and their happy smiling faces. I began to think. I'd never had time to <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>before.</b> I began to read." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, don't trouble {{your mind}} about that," [...] she said, with a laugh. [...] "I have {{finished}} it, but I have not read a word of the beginning.

6000|$|... "I {{mean that}} memory and {{association}} come <b>before</b> comprehension, so <b>that</b> one {{ought to know}} all good things--fa--with familiarity before one can understand, because understanding does not make one love.
