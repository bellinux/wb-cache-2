50|$|Mastitis, a {{potentially}} fatal inflammatory {{infection of the}} mammary glands, is a common health problem in dairy cows in the United States and causes great economic losses for the dairy industry each year due to reduced milk production in cows with mastitis. While the influence of contagious gram-positive bacteria (e.g. Staphylococcus and Streptococcus) - {{which used to be}} the primary cause for mastitis in dairy cows - has been significantly reduced in recent years, environmental pathogens such as coliform bacteria (e.g. E. coli) and noncontagious Streptococcus now play a larger role in the infection of dairy cows. This is cause for concern as environmental bacteria, noncontagious Streptococcus especially, are becoming increasingly resistant to antimicrobial <b>intramammary</b> therapy. McCowan et al. (2005) set out to determine if certain housing facilities, husbandry practices, and/or use of antimicrobial agents caused higher levels of resistant environmental bacteria. The researchers sampled the bulk tank milk of nearly 100 California dairies and conducted a face-to-face on-site questionnaire for approximately 50 of the dairies found to have at least 3 environmental bacteria isolates. McCowan et al. (2005) analyzed the results and found that not drying udders before attaching the milk units significantly increased chances of antimicrobial resistance, as did the use of some antimicrobial agents (ceftiofur, Sulfadimethoxine) for treatment of non-mastitis diseases. Surprisingly, no antimicrobial agents used to treat mastitis were found to cause increased resistance.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the relationships among daughter <b>intramammary</b> infections at first parturition and sire transmitting abilities for somatic cell score, udder type traits, productive life, and protein yield. Quarter milk samples from 958 daughters (in eight Pennsylvania herds and one Nebraska herd) of 182 Holstein sires were collected within a few days of first calving and cultured to determine <b>intramammary</b> infection status. A total of 446 cows had <b>intramammary</b> infections in 835 quarters at first parturition. Incidence of <b>intramammary</b> infections at first parturition and the proportion of quarters infected per cow were regressed on age at first calving, days in milk at sample collection, herd-season of calving (a classification variable), and sire transmitting abilities taken one at a time. Linear effects, non-linear effects, and odds ratios were estimated for sire transmitting abilities. Separate, preplanned analyses were conducted on data from one herd that gave all heifers an <b>intramammary</b> antibiotic infusion in each quarter 30 d prior to the expected calving date. Separate analyses were also conducted on dependent variables that considered <b>intramammary</b> infections at first parturition from: all organisms, coagulasenegative staphylococci, coliform species, streptococci other than Streptococcus agalactiae, and the most common environmental organisms (coliform species and streptococci other than Streptococcus agalactiae). Daughters of sires that transmit the lowest somatic cell score had the fewest <b>intramammary</b> infections at first parturition. Daughters of sires that transmit longer productive life, shorter teats, and closely spaced front teats had fewer <b>intramammary</b> infections at first parturition.

40|$|Risk {{factors for}} <b>intramammary</b> infections caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci, {{contagious}} major pathogens and environmental major pathogens in early lactating heifers were evaluated at the herd, heifer and quarter levels. In total, 764 quarters of 191 dairy heifers in 20 randomly selected farms in Flanders (Belgium) were sampled. Quarter milk {{samples were collected}} between 1 and 4 days in milk and between 5 and 8 days in milk for bacteriological culture. Data were analyzed using multivariable, multilevel logistic regression analysis. Higher average herd milk somatic cell count (> 200, 000 cells/mL), not having an effective fly control strategy, contact with lactating cows prior to calving and moderate to severe udder edema prior to calving increased the odds of <b>intramammary</b> infections caused by contagious major pathogens. Poor heifer hygiene and lack of mineral/vitamin supplementation prior to calving were risk factors for <b>intramammary</b> infection caused by environmental major pathogens. Teat apex colonization with coagulase-negative staphylococci prior to calving seemed to protect quarters against <b>intramammary</b> infections caused by major pathogens. Poor heifer hygiene before calving, a non-clipped udder and not practicing of teat dipping prior to calving increased the odds of <b>intramammary</b> infection with coagulase-negative staphylococci. Although management {{is important in the}} prevention and control of <b>intramammary</b> infections in early lactating heifers, most variation in the prevalence of <b>intramammary</b> infections resided at the heifer and quarter levels, indicating that the susceptibility for <b>intramammary</b> infections around calving is mainly determined by heifer and quarter characteristics...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the efficacy of <b>intramammary</b> immunization with UV-killed Escherichia coli ECC-Z on prevention of <b>intramammary</b> colonization after a challenge with a dose of the homologous E. coli ECC-Z live bacteria. A total of 10 cows were included in a study to evaluate the efficacy of <b>intramammary</b> immunization. All 10 cows received an <b>intramammary</b> immunization of 100 cfu of UV-killed E. coli ECC-Z bacteria into one hind quarter at the time of dry off. Approximately 2 wk before the anticipated calving date, both hind quarters of all cows were challenged with 100 cfu of live E. coli ECC-Z bacteria. Five of the cows were vaccinated parenterally with a commercial J 5 bacterin, and 5 cows served as controls with no parenteral vaccination. The cows were then followed over time and infection risk, clinical scores, somatic cell count, and milk production were observed over time. The results of these 10 cows showed partial protection of <b>intramammary</b> immunization on the outcome of a subsequent homologous <b>intramammary</b> challenge. Immunization resulted in a lower probability of infection, a lower bacteria count, lower somatic cell counts and milk conductivity, a lower clinical mastitis score, and increased milk production compared with unimmunized control quarters. Once the analysis was corrected for immunization, parenteral J 5 vaccination had no significant effect on any of the measured parameters. These results provide the first evidence that <b>intramammary</b> immunization may improve the outcome of an <b>intramammary</b> E. coli infection in late gestation and onset of mastitis immediately following parturition. Unlike systemic vaccination, which generally does not reduce the <b>intramammary</b> infection risk, the <b>intramammary</b> immunization did show a 5 -times reduced odds of an established <b>intramammary</b> infection after challenge. Cytokine profiles indicated a local return of proinflammatory response after challenge as the data showed a more pronounced increase in in IFN-γ with a subsequent negative feedback due to a spike in the level of IL- 10 in immunized quarters relative to nonimmunized quarters. Although these results are preliminary and obtained on only 10 cows, the results provide insight into the biological benefits of triggering mucosal immunity in the mammary gland...|$|E
40|$|Links on the Web 8 Mastitis in heifers {{is defined}} as <b>intramammary</b> {{bacterial}} infection (IMI) leading to temporary or permanent colonization of the mammary secretory tissues with bacteria. <b>Intramammary</b> infections can produce clinically visible disease (clinical mastitis) or no outwardly visible signs of disease associated with bacterial presence in the mammary tissues (subclinical mastitis). Clinical disease is manifest as hot swollen quarters with or without systemic signs of fever, depression and toxemia, and elevated SCC. Subclinical disease is detected as elevated SCC in milk from infected quarter or elevated composite SCC in milk across all 4 quarters. Prepartum <b>intramammary</b> infection in heifers {{may or may not}} result in loss of the quarter. However, early infections occurring as calves or at the time of breeding are certainly capable of producing a sustained reduction in <b>intramammary</b> secretory tissue that reduces lifetime productivity and profitability. <b>Intramammary</b> heifer infections can occur as early as 1 - 9 months of age and have been observed as early as 9 months before parturition (Boddie et al., 1985, Fox et al, 1995, 2009).

40|$|Objective. To compare four {{different}} dry cow treatments (DCT) and establish their effectiveness in reducing <b>intramammary</b> infections (IIM). Materials and methods. DCTs included systemic tylosin (12 g) alone or accompanied by cefapirine <b>intramammary</b> infusions and or an internal teat sealant. A {{total number of}} 278 cows {{at the end of}} lactation period were {{randomly assigned to one of}} 4 dry cow treatment groups: CESE Group (n= 89), <b>intramammary</b> cephapirin and teat sealant.

TYSE Group (n= 86), 12 g intramuscular tylosin and teat sealant; TY Group (n= 76) 12 g intramuscular tylosin only. Milk samples for culture were collected at dry-off and 1 and 2 weeks after calving. Somatic cell counts (SCC) were taken from Dairy Herd Improvement Association (DHI) tests at dry-off, and the first two test days after calving. Results. Bacteria cure rate for Gram-positive <b>intramammary</b> infections (IMI) for TYCESE group was 93. 6 %, CESE group 78. 9 %, TYSE group 88. 2 %, and TY group 78. 1 %.

First, a guideline to cost factors associated with mastitis was set, and a comprehensive literature review was conducted to evaluate literature estimates of the cost and cost-benefits of mastitis control. In another project, a data analysis was conducted to estimate production loss due to new subclinical mastitis in Dutch dairy herds. The estimates were used as input values to assist in developing a dynamic and stochastic bio-economic model of <b>intramammary</b> infection. The model simulated the major pathogens in the Netherlands using recent knowledge on the dynamics of pathogen-specific <b>intramammary</b> infection {{to calculate the cost}} of these infections. Two systematic meta-analysis reviews were conducted; the first quantified the preventive effect of dry period interventions against new <b>intramammary</b> infections. The second meta-analysis quantified the cure rate of existing <b>intramammary</b> infections at dry off using dry cow therapy. Subsequently, the bio-economic model was updated to include the dynamics of pathogen-specific <b>intramammary</b> infections in the dry period.

40|$|Eight {{different}} mastitis remedies {{were administered}} intracisternally on a rotational basis to the 48 quarters of 12 mastitis negative cows.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare the efficacy of an <b>intramammary</b> infusion, containing tilmicosin phosphate, to an infusion of a negative control <b>intramammary</b> placebo for preventing new <b>intramammary</b> infections (IMI) during the dry period. Cows were enrolled from 24 dairy herds from three geographical regions of Canada. Data from 248 cows and 938 bacteriologically negative quarters at drying-off are summarized. Overall, the rate of new IMI during the dry period was 16. 7 % of quarters. The new infection rates for quarters that received <b>intramammary</b> tilmicosin compared with the <b>intramammary</b> placebo were 14. 4 and 19. 4 %, respectively. The majority of new IMI was caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci (49 %) and environmental streptococcal organisms (26. 8 %). The probability for quarters to develop new IMI in the dry period was significantly increased when cows had higher milk production before drying-off (P = 0. 04), when cows had longer dry periods (P = 0. 02), and when dry cows were housed in tie-stall barns (P = 0. 002). Higher parity cows and those that had a linear score somatic cell count (SCC) above 4 on the last DHI test were also at increased risk for new IMI (P < 0. 10). Administration of <b>intramammary</b> tilmicosin appears to be an efficacious therapy for prevention of new IMI; however, there is currently no approved <b>intramammary</b> formulation of this product available. Use of blanket dry cow antibiotic therapy compared to selective dry cow therapy, as well as the importance of identifying risk factors and managing the environment of dry cows are discussed.
