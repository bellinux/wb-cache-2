50|$|Three weeks later, the Dutch {{presidency}} {{introduced a}} third {{version of the}} amendment proposal. This time Netherlands proposed, on top of EU Commission proposal, to ban self-loading firearms that have a magazine with more than 20 rounds attached, as well as ban such magazines themselves. According to Czech Ministry of <b>Interior</b> <b>Impact</b> Assessment {{it would make a}} total chaos in firearms categorization (i.e. a firearm would be B category when a 15 round magazine is inserted, and A category a second later after inserting a different, larger magazine) as well as vagueness, as it allowed also interpretation that all firearms that might potentially accept a larger than 20 rounds magazines might be themselves banned. The Impact Assessment further pointed out that millions of now legally owned standard capacity magazines could be expected to flow into the black market. Moreover, such firearms could be owned only for hunting and sporting purposes, having crippling effect in countries where self defense is prevailing reason for firearm possession, such as the Czech Republic. In order to appeal to some disagreeing countries (Finland, Lithuania, Estonia, Switzerland), the proposal now included special exemptions for firearms possessions by militia members.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Automotive {{interiors}} {{have long}} been a potentially injurious impact area to occupants during accidents, especially {{in the absence of}} adequate padding. The U. S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 201, Occupant Protection in <b>Interior</b> <b>Impact,</b> outlines test procedures and performance criteria in order to mitigate potentially injurious head impacts to interior surfaces. FMVSS 201 specifies a finite set of impact locations and applies to passenger vehicles of a specified year range and with a gross vehicle weight rating less than 10, 000 lb. In this paper, two head impact test methodologies are presented, a pendulum-test device and a Free Motion Headform (FMH) launching device, which allows for dynamic, repeatable impact evaluation of various vehicle interior surfaces and their impact attenuation abilities. The presented testing includes multiple series that evaluate the effect of differing vehicle upper interior padding on occupant head injury. One study in particular, analyzes a head impact to the side header of a heavy truck (not included in FMVSS 201) during a 90 degree rollover. Additionally, two other series of tests are presented which assess the injury reduction effect of side airbags to near side as well as far side occupants in a side impact scenario. Lastly, a forensic analysis is presented which evaluates two possible head impact locations experienced in a real world accident by analysis of the resulting interior compartment damage utilizing the FMH launching device test method. The data collected and presented includes accelerometer instrumentation and high speed video analysis. These studies demonstrate that adequate padding and airbags are very effective at mitigating head injury potential at impact speeds of 12 - 25 mph (19 - 40 kph) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{globally}} extensive smooth {{plains of}} Mercury {{are believed to}} be mostly volcanic in origin. Wide-spread effusive volcanism on Mercury is thought to have ended by ~ 3. 5 Ga due to secular cooling of the planet’s interior, and contraction of its lithosphere. As the planet cools and contracts, melt should be produced at a slower rate and in smaller volumes, so it will stall deeper and its escape routes will close. 3. 5 Ga corresponds roughly with the end of Mercury’s Calorian system. Smooth plains younger than this have been reported, but are restricted to the <b>interiors</b> of <b>impact</b> basins, such as Rachmaninoff. If widespread effusive volcanism on Mercury ceased in response to cooling and contraction during the Calorian, then Mansurian impact basins are good places to search for late-stage effusive volcanism. Effusive volcanism should be favoured in impact basins, because they remove overburden, promote uplift, temporarily reset the preexisting stress regime, propagate fractures and deposit heat. If cooling and contraction were the main factors that controlled the decline of widespread volcanism on Mercury, then post-impact volcanism should similarly become less voluminous throughout the Mansurian. Smaller basins should have less post-impact volcanism because they produce shallower pathways for melt. Post-impact volcanism should also become less common throughout the Mansurian as Mercury continues to cool. Considering these expectations, we are conducting a global survey of Mansurian impact basins to study how effusive volcanism on Mercury waned as a con-sequence of global cooling and contraction...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Melt {{generation}} and migration are important processes for {{the evolution of}} the Earth’s <b>interior</b> and <b>impact</b> the global convection of the mantle. While they {{have been the subject of}} numerous investigations, the typical time and length-scales of melt transport are vastly different from global mantle convection, which determines where melt is generated. This makes it difficult to study mantle convection and melt migration in a unified framework. The equations that describe coupled Stokes-Darcy flow have been derived a long time ago and they have been successfully implemented and applied in numerical models. However, modeling magma dynamics poses the challenge of highly non-linear and spatially variable material prop-erties, in particular the viscosity. In addition, previous models neglected the individual compressibilities of the solid and the fluid phase. However, experiments have shown that the melt density change from the depth of melt generation to the surface leads to a volume increase of up to 20 %. Considering these volume changes in both phases also ensures self-consistency of models that strive to link melt generation to processes in the deeper mantle, where the compressibility of the solid phase becomes more important. Here, we describe our extension of the finite element mantle convection code ASPECT that adds equations describing the behavior of silicate melt percolating through and interacting with a viscously deforming host rock. We use the original compressible formulation of the McKenzie equations, augmented by an equation for the conservation of energy. This approach includes both melt migration and melt generation with the accompanying latent heat effects. Ap-plying adaptive mesh refinement to this type of problems is particularly advantageous, as the resolution can be increased i...|$|R

In part because the composition and surface pressure of the Earth's atmosphere 4 x 10 (9) years ago are unknown, laboratory experiments on prebiological organic chemistry are at best suggestive; but we can test our understanding by looking more closely at the observed extraterrestrial organic chemistry. The present Account is restricted to atmospheric organic chemistry, primarily on the large moon of Saturn. Titan is a test of our understanding of the organic chemistry of planetary atmospheres. Its atmospheric bulk composition (N 2 /CH 4) is intermediate between the highly reducing (H 2 /He/CH 4 /NH 3 /H 2 O) atmospheres of the Jovian planets and the more oxidized (N 2 /CO 2 /H 2 O) atmospheres of the terrestrial planets Mars and Venus. It has long been recognized that Titan's organic chemistry may have some relevance to the events that led to the origin of life on Earth.

A 10 % (w/w) lysozyme solution {{was incorporated into}} 1 % (w/w) chitosan film-forming solution at ratios of 0, 10, 20 and 60 % (w/w). RESULTS: Storage time and coating had significant effects on Haugh unit, yolk index, weight loss, albumen pH, dry matter, relative whipping capacity (RWC) and albumen viscosity. Uncoated eggs had higher albumen pH and weight loss and lower albumen viscosity. All coated eggshells showed greater puncture strength than uncoated eggshells, resulting in extended shelf life. The 20 and 60 % lysozyme–chitosan coatings were more effective in maintaining the internal quality of eggs (e. g. pH, dry matter and RWC).
