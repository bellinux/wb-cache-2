5|$|Access to {{the temple}} was located in the {{south-east}} corner of the enclosure wall. The entrance led to an open courtyard that stretched from east to west. The ritual cleaning and preparation of the offerings took place <b>here.</b> <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> the extensive degradation suffered by the temple, reconstruction attempts are somewhat speculative. From the ruins, archaeologists propose that the temple comprised an open colonnade, possibly made of granite, a sacrificial chapel adjoining the pyramid side, three statue niches and a few magazine chambers. No traces of a cult pyramid were found onsite. In {{the halls of the}} temple were depictions of animal processions and offerings carriers moving towards the Shrine of the Queen.|$|E
5|$|Most bogs {{exist in}} glaciated areas, but Black Moshannon State Park {{is on the}} Allegheny Plateau. This area was not covered by glaciers during the last ice age. The bogs formed <b>here</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the beds of {{sandstone}} that lie flat, a short distance {{below the surface of}} the earth. The sandstone formations in the park do not absorb water very well, so any depression in them will collect water, as has happened here. The bogs extend the shores of the lake. Migratory shorebirds that visit here include greater and lesser yellowlegs, least sandpiper, solitary sandpiper, and the spotted sandpiper, which has been confirmed as using the IBA as a breeding grounds.|$|E

25|$|The {{southern}} edge of the Columbia Embayment is along a line from the Klamath Mountains on the Oregon coast to a point in the Blue Mountains just east of the Wallula Gap. Unlike the OWL, this line has little topographical expression, and aside from the Hite Fault System is not associated with any major fault systems. But mapping of gravitational anomalies shows a definite lineament, some 700nbsp&km (about 400 miles) long, called the Klamath-Blue Mountain Lineament (KBML). This lineament is of interest <b>here</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the possibility it was formerly conjugate with OWL, discussed in the next section.|$|E

25|$|Pike of Stickle is {{the site}} {{of one of the most}} {{important}} neolithic stone axe factories in Europe. The most prominent quarries are situated above the scree slopes on the steep southern face of the fell. The factory was set up <b>here</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> a vein of greenstone, a very hard volcanic rock, which comes to the surface around the head of the valley. Evidence of axe manufacture have been found in many areas of Great Langdale but it is the screes of Pike of Stickle which have yielded the most discoveries. There is a small cave at the top of the Stickle Stone Shoot near the summit of the fell which was part of the stone axe factory.|$|E
25|$|At that time, {{the city}} of Turin had a {{population}} of 117,000 inhabitants. It reflected the effects of industrialization and urbanization: numerous poor families lived in the slums of the city, having come from the countryside {{in search of a}} better life. In visiting the prisons, Don Bosco was disturbed to see so many boys from 12 to 18 years of age. He was determined to find a means to prevent them ending up <b>here.</b> <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> population growth and migration to the city, Bosco found the traditional methods of parish ministry inefficient. He decided it was necessary to try another form of apostolate, and he began to meet the boys where they worked and gathered in shops and market places. They were pavers, stone-cutters, masons, plasterers who came from far away places, he recalled in his brief Memoires.|$|E
25|$|In {{the tables}} below the {{possibilities}} of syllable nucleus of the next-to-last syllable and their accent is shown. The different sound of a next-to-last syllable makes no grammatical distinction, for example, words nóras – wish and kū́nas – body, are of the same declensional and accentuation patterns. But {{there are a few}} certain differences in the accentuation features of the nucleus sounds of the next-to-last syllable. Most of the vocals and diphthongs can have either of the accents: a start-firm or an end-firm. Short a, e sounds, when they are in a stem of a word and stressed, lengthen and have always an end-firm accent; i, u are short and there is no accentual differentiation in their stress. Mixed diphthongs a, e + l, m, n, r have the first element lengthened when stressed in a start-firm accent, when in i, u + l, m, n, r and a diphthong ui the first element remains short in the same case. The words having ą, ę in a pre-desinential syllable are not included <b>here</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the lack of declensional types. Some examples: rą̃stas 2 – balk, timber; žąsìs 4 – goose; ąsà 4 – handle; kę́sas 3 – hassock.|$|E

500|$|... "Wounding" [...] and [...] "causing grievous bodily harm" [...] {{are defined}} {{in the same way}} as they are in the crime of maliciously {{wounding}} or inflicting grievous bodily harm. Grievous bodily harm includes serious psychological trauma and serious infection; however, these are less controversial <b>here</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the inclusion of intent. Intent narrows the crime considerably, and the term [...] "inflict" [...] is not used. In form (3), intent can be simply decided in the case of a direct attack, or [...] "virtual certainty", with knowledge of the virtual certainty [...] the Woollin principle. In form (1), where an injury does not amount to grievous bodily harm, intent to cause grievous bodily harm (in the advancement of a different cause) must be shown. Practically, the [...] "virtual certainty" [...] clause cannot come into force, since grievous bodily harm was not actually caused, by definition. In forms (2) and (4), the concept of [...] "malice" [...] has a role to play that it does not in (1) and (3). The defendant must foresee the risk of wounding or grievous bodily harm, where the core intent is to resist arrest. The defendant cannot be reckless to the resisting of arrest, it must be an intention. Concerning the requirement to resist a lawful arrest, the defendant only lacks the required mens rea if he believes in facts which, if true, would make the arrest unlawful; not just that he believes the facts as they are make the arrest illegal [...] a mistake of fact suffices, a mistake of law does not.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{possible}} to transform a bridgedT section into a Lattice, or Xsection. [...] The Xsection {{is a kind of}} bridge circuit, but usually drawn as a lattice, hence the name.

[...] The component count increase arises out of the transformation process rather than the balance. [...] There is however, one common application for this topology, the lattice phase equaliser, which is also constant resistance and also invented by Zobel.
