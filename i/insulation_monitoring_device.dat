40|$|Insulated {{terrestrial}} power {{networks are}} used for reliable systems such as large production plants, hospital operating rooms and naval ships. The system is isolated from ground and a first fault, such as a short circuit between a phase and ground, will not result in disconnection of the power via residential current devices. The power system does however have to be monitored to measure the fault and correct it, before a second fault occurs. The disadvantage is the maximum capacitance to ground which is allowed because the detection of a first fault to ground is interfered by those capacitances. In modern electronic systems many power line filters are used, increasing capacitance to ground, which is posing a big constraint in the design. Several power <b>insulation</b> <b>monitoring</b> <b>devices</b> have been evaluated {{and the impact of}} power line filters has been analyzed to see how much capacitance to ground can be tolerated in practice without impairing the first fault detection...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{focuses on}} the safety {{requirements}} for the DC bus distribution systems up to 1500 VDC. High DC bus voltages are attractive for keeping the current and copper weight low. However, if the DC bus voltage exceeds 75 VDC, additional safety measures are required. Regulations require double protection measures. The first protection is mostly provided by proper electrical insulation. A second active protection system is also installed, this detects insulation failures and switches off the power supply. Often the residual current detector (RCD) is used which detects leakage current in earthed systems but is difficult to build for DC systems. Another active technique is to install a floating or unearthed system with an <b>insulation</b> resistance <b>monitoring</b> <b>device</b> (IMD). In this paper {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of both systems are compared. A simple IMD technique is presented together with fault simulations and EMC immunity test results.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this review was to identify and examine {{the literature on the}} association between medication adherence self-reported questionnaires (SRQs) and medication <b>monitoring</b> <b>devices.</b> The primary literature search was performed for 1980 - 2009 using PubMed, PubMed In Process and Non-Indexed, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process, PsycINFO (EBSCO), CINAHL (EBSCO), Ovid HealthStar, EMBASE (Elsevier) and Cochrane Databases and using the following search terms: 'patient compliance', 'medication adherence', 'treatment compliance', 'drug monitoring', 'drug therapy', 'electronic', 'digital', 'computer', 'monitor', 'monitoring', 'drug', 'drugs', 'pharmaceutical preparations', 'compliance' and 'medications'. We identified studies that included SRQs and electronic <b>monitoring</b> <b>devices</b> to measure adherence and focused on the SRQs that were found to be moderately to highly correlated with the <b>monitoring</b> <b>devices.</b> Of the 1679 citations found via the primary search, 41 full-text articles were reviewed for correlation between <b>monitoring</b> <b>devices</b> and SRQs. A majority (68 %) of articles reported high (27 %), moderate (29 %) or significant (12 %) correlation between <b>monitoring</b> <b>devices</b> (37 using Medication Event Monitoring System [MEMS] and four using other devices) and SRQs (11 identified and numerous other unnamed SRQs).

40|$|In {{networked}} systems, <b>monitoring</b> <b>devices</b> such as sensors {{are typically}} deployed to monitor various target locations. Targets are the {{points in the}} physical space at which events of some interest, such as random faults or attacks, can occur. Most often, these devices have limited energy supplies, and they can operate for a limited duration. As a result, energy-efficient monitoring of various target locations {{through a set of}} <b>monitoring</b> <b>devices</b> with limited energy supplies is a crucial problem in networked systems. In this paper, we study optimal scheduling of <b>monitoring</b> <b>devices</b> to maximize network coverage for detecting and isolating events on targets for a given network lifetime. The <b>monitoring</b> <b>devices</b> considered could remain active only for a fraction of the overall network lifetime. We formulate the problem of scheduling of <b>monitoring</b> <b>devices</b> as a graph labeling problem, which unlike other existing solutions, allows us to directly utilize the underlying network structure to explore the trade-off between coverage and network lifetime. In this direction, first we propose a greedy heuristic to solve the graph labeling problem, and then provide a game-theoretic solution to achieve near optimal graph labeling. Moreover, the proposed setup can be used to simultaneously solve the scheduling and placement of <b>monitoring</b> <b>devices,</b> which yields improved performance as compared to separately solving the placement and scheduling problems. Finally, we illustrate our results on various networks, including real-world water distribution networks...|$|R
