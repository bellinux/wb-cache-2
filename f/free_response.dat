5|$|Later Reformed theologians reacted against Barth's {{views on}} baptism by {{appealing}} to Calvin, the idea that baptism is a promise rather than an accomplished reality, {{and the idea of}} baptism as a replacement of circumcision. Scottish Reformed theologian T.F. Torrance emphasized the idea that baptism is God's word establishing the church, and that the individual's response comes after rather than before God's act in baptism. German Reformed liberation theologian Jürgen Moltmann, on the other hand, saw infant baptism as inappropriately associated with the national church. He saw baptism as properly a <b>free</b> <b>response</b> God's call to discipleship. Reformed churches have generally maintained the practice of infant baptism despite these critiques.|$|E
5|$|The exam {{is offered}} {{every year in}} May. Students are not {{expected}} to memorize any formulas; rather, a list of common statistical formulas related to descriptive statistics, probability, and inferential statistics is provided. Moreover, tables for the normal, Student's t and chi-squared distributions are given as well. Students are also expected to use graphing calculators with statistical capabilities. The exam is three hours long with ninety minutes allotted to complete each of its two sections: multiple choice and free-response. The multiple choice portion of the exam consists of forty questions with five possible answers each. The <b>free</b> <b>response</b> section contains six open-ended questions that are often long and divided into multiple parts. The first five of these questions may require twelve minutes each to answer and normally relate to one topic or category. The sixth question consists of a broad-ranging investigative task and may require approximately twenty-five minutes to answer.|$|E

25|$|The {{mathematics}} {{portion of}} the SAT {{is divided into two}} sections: Math Test – Calculator and Math Test – No Calculator. In total, the SAT math test is 80 minutes long and includes 58 questions: 45 multiple choice questions and 13 grid-in questions.

25|$|In 1930 the SAT {{was first}} split into the verbal and math sections, a {{structure}} that would continue through 2004. The verbal section of the 1930 test covered a more narrow range of content than its predecessors, examining only antonyms, double definitions (somewhat similar to sentence completions), and paragraph reading. In 1936, analogies were re-added. Between 1936 and 1946, students had between 80 and 115 minutes to answer 250 verbal questions (over a third of which were on antonyms). The mathematics test introduced in 1930 contained 100 <b>free</b> <b>response</b> questions to be answered in 80 minutes, and focused primarily on speed. From 1936 to 1941, like the 1928 and 1929 tests, the mathematics section was eliminated entirely. When the mathematics portion of the test was re-added in 1942, it consisted of multiple choice questions.|$|E

Mr. Gutermann-Seuss had truly, for the crisis, the putting down of his cards, a rare manner; he was perfect master of what not to say to such a personage as Mr. Verver while the particular importance that dispenses with chatter was diffused by his movements themselves, his repeated act of passage between a featureless mahogany meuble and a table so virtuously disinterested as to look fairly smug under a cotton cloth of faded maroon and indigo, all redolent of patriarchal teas. The Damascene tiles, successively, and oh so tenderly, unmuffled and revealed, lay there at last in their full harmony and their venerable splendour, but the tribute of appreciation and decision was, while the spectator considered, simplified to a point that but just failed of representing levity {{on the part of a}} man who had always acknowledged without shame, in such affairs, the intrinsic charm of what was called discussion. The infinitely ancient, the immemorial amethystine blue of the glaze, scarcely more meant to be breathed upon, it would seem, than the cheek of royalty--this property of the ordered and matched array had inevitably all its determination for him, but his submission was, perhaps for the first time in his life, of the quick mind alone, the process really itself, in its way, as fine as the perfection perceived and admired: every inch of the rest of him being given to the foreknowledge that an hour or two later he should have [...] "spoken." [...] The burning of his ships therefore waited too near to let him handle his opportunity with his usual firm and sentient fingers--waited somehow in the predominance of Charlotte's very person, in her being there exactly as she was, capable, as Mr. Gutermann-Seuss himself was capable, of the right felicity of silence, but with an embracing ease, through it all, that made deferred criticism as fragrant as some joy promised a lover by his mistress, or as a big bridal bouquet held patiently behind her. He couldn't otherwise have explained, surely, why he found himself thinking, to his enjoyment, of so many other matters than the felicity of his acquisition and the figure of his cheque, quite equally high; any more than why, later on, with their return to the room in which they had been received and the renewed encompassment of the tribe, he felt quite merged in the elated circle formed by the girl's <b>free</b> <b>response</b> to the collective caress of all the shining eyes, and by her genial acceptance of the heavy cake and port wine that, as she was afterwards to note, added to their transaction, for a finish, the touch of some mystic rite of old Jewry.|$|E
40|$|AbstractFractional order {{differentiation}} {{is generally}} considered {{as the basis of}} fractional calculus, but the real basis is in fact fractional order integration and particularly the fractional integrator, because definition and properties of fractional differentiation and of fractional differential systems rely essentially on fractional integration. We present the frequency distributed model of the fractional integrator and its finite dimension approximation. The simulation of FDSs, based on fractional integrators, leads to the definition of FDS internal state variables, which are the state variables of the fractional integrators, as a generalization of the integer order case. The initial condition problem has been an open problem {{for a long time in}} fractional calculus. We demonstrate that the frequency distributed model of the fractional integrator provides a solution to this problem through the knowledge of its internal state. Beyond the solution of this fundamental problem, mastery of the integrator internal state allows the analysis and prediction of fractional differential system transients. Moreover, the finite dimension approximation of the fractional integrator provides an efficient technique for practical simulation of FDSs and analysis of their transients, with a particular insight into the interpretation of initial conditions, as illustrated by numerical simulations. Laplace transform equations and initial conditions of the Caputo and the Riemann–Liouville derivatives are used to formulate the <b>free</b> <b>responses</b> of FDEs. Because usual equations are wrong, the corresponding <b>free</b> <b>responses</b> do not fit with real transients. We demonstrate that revised equations, including the initial state vector of the fractional integrator (used to perform differentiation) provide corrected <b>free</b> <b>responses</b> which match with real transients, as exhibited by numerical simulations...|$|R

The study has been conducted using a numerical model elaborated for the liquefaction of partially saturated soils together with a cyclic elastoplastic constitutive relation implemented in a finite element program. The numerical model and {{the analysis of the}} influence of soil saturation on the <b>free</b> field <b>response,</b> for different positions of the water table have been investigated respectively. The result shows that the soil saturation degree largely affects the <b>free</b> field <b>response</b> to cyclic loading, with a decrease in soil saturation leading to a decrease in the rate of generation of excess pore-water pressure, and consequently to a reduction in the liquefaction risk...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Free</b> <b>response,</b> usually {{referred}} to as essay, {{is a type of}} question used in tests in education, workplace, and government. Most <b>free</b> <b>response</b> questions ask or require the test-taker to state a belief, opinion, or write a short essay and support it with facts, examples, or other evidence. However, few tests solely rely on these types of problems, and tend to work in conjunction with other types, such as multiple choice. <b>Free</b> <b>response</b> questions generally test more than straight knowledge and ask for a [...] "big picture" [...] type of response (see example). Also, they usually allow the taker to choose an area in which they are familiar.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{investigates the}} {{behavior}} of piezoceramic sheet actuators under different types of excitation and mechanical loading. The research especially focuses on the application of these actuators {{to the development of}} smart rotor systems. The <b>free</b> strain <b>response</b> of the actuators under DC excitation is experimentally investigated along with the associated drift of the strain over time. Effect of tensile stress on the <b>free</b> strain <b>response</b> is examined. The magnitude and phase of the <b>free</b> strain <b>response</b> of the actuator under different excitation voltages and frequencies is measured, and a phenomenological model to predict this behavior is developed and validated. The power con-sumption of the free actuator and a pair of actuators surface bonded to a host structure is calculated by the impedance method and validated by measurement. Additionally, depoling of the actuators is dis-cussed, along with the feasibility of recovering performance by repoling in the event of accidental depoling...|$|R
40|$|THE ARTICLE INTRODUCES AN EMPIRICAL APPROACH to {{studying}} music’s extrinsic meanings, {{based on the}} idea of musical topos as a set of musical entities that is delimited and furnished with meaning by extramusical associations in a listener population. The proposed methodology involves <b>free,</b> associative <b>responses</b> as well as responses on semantic variables addressing the imagery. After deriving potential topical structures for a given musical domain from the quantitative results, the structures are substantiated by using them to guide a rule-based, qualitative analysis of the <b>free</b> <b>responses.</b> The approach allows a view to the topical organization of a musical domain in which the identity of each musical topos is fixed in extrinsic terms, by a set of semantic fields that is unique to the topos in question. An application of the approach to contemporary ‘‘motivational’’ production music yields an organization of such semantic fields into three topical categories—INTIMACY, POTENCY, and SPEED...|$|R
