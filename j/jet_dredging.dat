40|$|Abstract. Jet pump {{was widely}} used {{in the realm of}} water conservancy and aerospace. The trouble of lower {{efficiency}} on transfer restricted its rapid development and further application. A large number of experimental studies showed that its efficiency could be improved by pulsed jet, and pulsed jet generated in the device had higher impact on object. Based on massive literatures, generation ways of pulsed jet and study marches of excited pulsed jet were introduced briefly. At the same time, the progress in study and application of self-excited pulsed oscillation jet were focused on. Furthermore, in view of the domestic present situation of reservoir dredging, the next researches of <b>jet</b> <b>dredging</b> combination with artificial density-flow were prospected Foreword Because of jet’s enormous hitting energy, operations of dissection and crush can be accomplished easily. Jet technology was developed in recent 20 years and it had been {{widely used in}}. Jet pump [1] was a kind of mixed reaction device that energy and quality could be transmitted by jet’s spreading function, and developed into a high-tech industry, furthermore a new discipline of jet technology [2...|$|E

40|$|The {{stagnation}} pressure {{at a certain}} distance from the nozzle {{is important for the}} erosion/ cutting capacity of a submerged <b>jet</b> in <b>dredging.</b> The decay of the {{stagnation pressure}} with jet distance is well known in the case of non-cavitating jets. It is also known that cavitation causes the rate of decay to decrease. Under conditions of cavitation, a cone of bubbles forms around the jet, which decreases the momentum exchange between the jet and the ambient water and the associated entrainment. Despite the amount of research on cavitating jets, the literature does not provide a description for the entrainment {{in the case of a}} cavitating jet. Also, a useful description of the stagnation pressure decay of a cavitating jet is missing. To fill this lacuna, we carried out jet tests at various ambient pressures in both fresh and saline water. We present and analyse the results in this paper. Marine and Transport TechnologyMechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|The {{jet pump}} {{generally}} needs a long throat {{to mix the}} driving and induced fluids and transfer the momentum of driving fluid to induced fluid. Simultaneously the energy losses occur when the fluids flow through the long throat happened due to the friction loss occurs inside of the throat wall. Therefore, {{it is known that}} the throat length largely affects the jet pump efficiency. In this study, experimental studies are performed for a typical single nozzle jet pump using water as driving fluid and sand as the induced fluid. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the performance of <b>dredging</b> <b>jet</b> pump. The effects of the pump operating conditions and geometries on its performance were investigated. The experimental rig was constructed such a way it can be changing the mixing chamber length and diffuser angles. In this study three different mixing chamber length to mixing chamber diameter ratio of 6. 75, 7. 25 and 7. 86 are studied. And three different diffuser angles of 4 º, 5. 5 º and 7 º respectively with one suction nozzle of semi cone angle of 22 º. Also one type o...|$|R
