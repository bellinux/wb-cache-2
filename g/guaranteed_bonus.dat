Many public {{school districts are}} beginning to implement performance pay programs that provide teachers the opportunity to earn pay bonuses based on measures of teaching performance. Despite {{the growing number of}} districts offering these programs, we know little about their effects. Theory suggests that performance pay programs may provide an incentive for teachers to work harder (an effort effect). In addition, districts offering performance pay may attract teachers with higher average ability (a selection effect). Empirical work investigating the existence of these effects is mixed {{in the case of the}} effort effect and nonexistent in the case of the selection effect. This study is the first to attempt to empirically test for the existence of a teacher selection effect resulting from performance pay programs. I show that the existence of a selection effect may be revealed in differences in total pay and bonus probabilities between teachers who self-select into performance pay programs and teachers who are exogenously assigned. If self-selectors earn a higher expected total pay or are more likely to earn a bonus than an exogenously assigned teacher, I show that this implies that self-selectors are higher ability teachers on average. I test for this difference in cross-sectional data from the Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) and in longitudinal data from a single performance pay district in Minnesota. In each case, I fail to find evidence of a selection effect. In the cross-sectional analysis, I find that while self-selectors earn a higher expected total pay, they are also less likely to earn a performance bonus. In the longitudinal analysis, I find that teachers who joined a district in the few years prior to its adoption of performance pay are not measurably different from teachers who joined in the years after adoption. Post performance pay joiners are not measurably different in terms of their education, experience, or likelihood of earning a performance bonus. While I fail to find evidence of a selection effect, that should not be taken as proof that performance pay programs, in general, do not produce their advertised benefits. The SASS analysis relies on several strong assumptions that potentially undermine the credibility of the results. For the analysis of the performance pay district in Minnesota, this study’s inability to find evidence of a selection effect is likely a result of the district’s high relative base compensation and nearly <b>guaranteed</b> <b>bonus</b> award...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to develop more realistic long term asset models based on L´evy processes and discuss their applications to risk management of unitised with-profits policies. We investigate the behaviour of long-term returns of the UK total share return index by testing the common statistical properties for financial data, so-called “stylised facts”. We show that for the monthly U. K. share total return indices, the Gaussian return hypothesis is rejected in series of tests. The local distribution of the returns has higher kurtosis and heavier tails than the Gaussian. In addition, the returns series show significant nonlinear autocorrelation, extreme returns appear in clusters. The first long term asset model purposed in this thesis is the exponential L´evy model with non-Gaussian increment. We describe the Generalised Hyperbolic distributions with their subclasses. They are considered as candidate distributions for the increments of the driving L´evy processes. We estimate model parameters to the UK share gross total return index using two approaches, maximum likelihood (MLE) and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. Statistical and graphical goodness-of-fit tests demonstrate that these L´evy driven models give more accurate fits to the historical equity index returns data. For the liability model we consider long term participating life insurance products specifically unitised with-profits contracts. The payouts of unitised with-profits policies are simulated {{under a variety of}} asset models driven by L´evy processes. At first a basic model policy is considered with limited insurer operations and no risk controls. We look into various risk measures of the maturity loss for the insurer xiii and compare the statistical properties for different non-Gaussian increment L´evy models. It is found that the classical Gaussian model substantially underestimates the risk measures in unitised with-profits policies. The L´evy driven models which have semi-heavy tailed increments are aggregate to normal distributions in the long run. Then we consider different retrospective bonus mechanisms by varying the participating rate and the smoothing period. As a comparison we use a bonus earning power method with deterministic projected maturity asset share and 25 percent terminal bonus cushion. We study the joint distributions of the maturity asset shares and guarantees under these two bonus mechanism. With similar risk measures, there are larger expected maturity <b>guarantees</b> under <b>bonus</b> earning power method than retrospective bonus. Declaring bonuses on a more frequent basis is then tested, which has the desired effect of reducing the risk measures when declaring monthly bonuses using bonus earning power mechanism. We make observations on two different investment strategies, a diversified investment strategy and a hedging based investment strategy. The former method tries to reduce the variance of the invest return distribution while the hedging investment strategy, on the other hand, narrows the left tail of the maturity loss distribution by paying an extra amount of expenses. Finally, the L´evy models are extended by using GARCH(1, 1) -m type volatility. Both maximum likelihood estimators and Bayesian estimators using Markov Chain Monte Carlo are presented. The statistical tests on the devolatilised data show that the GARCH model reduces the non-linear autocorrelation in the conditional return processes and furthermore improve the fitting of the asset models. Also, multi-variable models are considered. Stochastic bridges driven by L´evy processes are constructed while the yearly returns follow the Wilkie model.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Risk Analysis)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2010 In {{recent years}} {{investment}} products {{have become more}} complex by providing investors with various <b>guarantees</b> and <b>bonus</b> options. This increase in complexity has provided an impetus for the investigation into integrated asset and liability management frameworks that could realistically address dynamic portfolio allocation in a risk-controlled way. This thesis presents two stochastic programming frameworks forthe asset and liability management of investment products with guarantees. The asset side of these products usually contains fixed income securities. For this reason we {{are concerned with the}} stochastic evolution of the shape of the term structure of interest rates (or yield curve) over time. Literature in the field of scenario generation for multi-period stochastic programs has stated that the generation of a set of scenarios, which represents the uncertainty in the evolution of these risk factors over time, {{is one of the most}} important and critical steps in the multi-stage stochastic programming approach. The first part of this thesis presents two methods for yield curve scenario generation. The first method uses a moment-matching approach and the second a simulation approach which takes the movement of macro-economic factors into account. In asset and liability management under uncertainty, using stochastic programming, it is sometimes necessary to take into account flexible risk management actions, for example the reinvestment of coupons or the payment of liabilities at time steps smaller than those at which portfolio rebalancing (or restructuring, i. e. changing the portfolio composition) takes place. The yield curve scenarios at these intermediate time points have to be path dependent. Firstly this thesis proposes a momentmatching approach to construct scenario trees with path dependent intermediate discrete yield curve outcomes sufficient for the pricing of fixed income securities. As part of the second approach we estimate an econometric model that fits the South African term structure of interest rates, using a Kalman filter approach. The proposed model includes four latent factors and three observable macro-economic factors (capacity utilisation, inflation and repo-rate). The goal is to capture the dynamic interactions between the macro-economy and the term structure. The resulting model can be used to generate interest rate scenario trees that are suitable for fixed income portfolio optimisation. An important input into our scenario generator is the investor's view on the future evolution of the repo-rate. In practice most financial institutions have views on the macro-economy. These views are produced by means of an economic scenario generator (ESG) or expert opinion. These ESG's only produce forecasts for macro-economic factors, for example the repo-rate and not a complete yield curve. The second part of this thesis introduces and solves two asset and liability problems. The first problem is the asset and liability management of minimum liquid asset portfolios found in the banking environment and the second problem is the asset and liability management of insurance products with minimum guarantees. We discuss the formulation and implementation of these mUlti-stage stochastic programming models and back-test both models on real market data. Maintaining liquid asset portfolios involves a high carry cost and is mandatory by law for some financial institutions. Taking this into account, a financial institution's aim is to manage a liquid asset portfolio in an "optimal" way, such that it keeps the minimum allowed liquid assets to comply with regulations. This thesis proposes a mUlti-stage dynamic stochastic programming model for liquid asset portfolio management. The model allows for portfolio rebalancing decisions over a multiperiod horizon, as well as for flexible risk management actions, such as reinvesting coupons at intermediate time steps. The second problem is the asset and liability management of insurance products with minimum guarantees. This thesis proposes a mUlti-stage dynamic stochastic programming model for the integrated asset and liability management of insurance products with guarantees that minimise the down-side risk of these products. We investigate with-profits guarantee funds by including regular bonus payments while keeping the optimisation problem linear. The main focus is the formulation and implementation of a multi-stage stochastic programming model Dynamic optimization is perceived to be too difficult. [...] It would be nice to have a generic 'sledge hammer' approach for attacking this sort of problem. 1 A. D. Smith (1996), p. 1085 Doctora...|$|R
