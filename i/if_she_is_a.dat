5|$|Above each stall, the occupant's heraldic {{devices are}} displayed. Perched on the {{pinnacle}} of a knight's stall is his helm, decorated with a mantling and topped by his crest. Under English heraldic law, women other than monarchs do not bear helms or crests; instead, the coronet appropriate to the dame's rank (<b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> peer or member of the Royal family) is used.|$|E
5|$|Each {{member of}} the Order, {{including}} the Sovereign, is allotted a stall in the Chapel, above which his or her heraldic devices are displayed. Perched on the pinnacle of a knight's stall is his helm, decorated with mantling and topped by his crest. If he is a peer, the coronet appropriate to his rank is placed beneath the helm. Under the laws of heraldry, women, other than monarchs, do not normally bear helms nor crests; instead, the coronet alone is used (<b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> peeress or princess). Lady Marion Fraser had a helm and crest included when she was granted arms; these are displayed above her stall {{in the same manner}} as for knights. Unlike other British Orders, the armorial banners of Knights and Ladies of the Thistle are not hung in the chapel, but instead in an adjacent part of St Giles High Kirk. The Thistle Chapel does, however, bear the arms of members living and deceased on stall plates. These enamelled plates are affixed to the back of the stall and display its occupant's name, arms, and date of admission into the Order.|$|E
5|$|In 1649, {{the town}} is witness to many witch burnings. In the church, the townspeople {{try to figure out}} whom to condemn next. People begin accusing others and soon they erupt into chaos, until Marge intervenes. She tries to talk sense into the townspeople, but Moe accuses her of being a witch. Quimby assures her that she is {{entitled}} to due process which means she will be thrown off a cliff with a broomstick; <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> witch she will be able to fly to safety, in which case the authorities expect her to report back for punishment. If she is not a witch, then she will fall to an honorable Christian death. After being shoved off the cliff, Marge flies up on the broomstick revealing that she really is a witch and vows to conquer the whole entire town. She returns to her sisters Patty and Selma. The sisters watch Ned and Maude Flanders talking about how the witches eat children, which gives them the notion to do just that. They knock on the Flanders' door and demand their sons, but before they leave, Maude offers the witches gingerbread men instead. The witches like these better than the children so they go to each house, getting goodies in exchange for not eating the children. As they fly off, the Sea Captain says that is how the tradition of Halloween and trick-or-treating started.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Will {{you allow}} me to offer you a little lunch?' he asked, hesitatingly, with {{something}} of Herbert's stately politeness. Even in this last extremity, Ronald felt instinctively what was due to Selah Briggs's natural sentiments of pride and delicacy. He must speak to her deferentially as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> lady, not give her alms as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> beggar.|$|R

500|$|Steve Leftridge from PopMatters {{considered}} the track {{to have a}} [...] "ho-hum" [...] melody. Its melody was compared to Britney Spears' [...] "Everytime" [...] (2003) and Evanescence's [...] "My Immortal" [...] (2003). During the chorus, Perry sings about holding out for a love that is [...] "cinematic and dramatic/With the perfect ending" [...] and later asks <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> [...] "stupid girl", according to Elysa Gardner from USA Today and an anonymous reviewer for Portrait Magazine. A reviewer for Portrait Magazine, considering {{it to be the}} slowest-paced song on Teenage Dream, said it juxtaposed well with the other tracks. [...] "It takes all the energy {{from the rest of the}} album, all the fast beating hearts and overwhelming feelings of love, and slows it all down to a song about looking for love instead," [...] they wrote.|$|E
500|$|The {{poster for}} [...] "Turn, Turn, Turn", created by Mike Del Mundo, depicts a maze forming the S.H.I.E.L.D. logo and show title, with a rat inside, hinting ominously at S.H.I.E.L.D.'s {{corruption}} {{and a possible}} traitor. The poster for [...] "Providence", created by Paolo Rivera, highlights the rise of Hydra by showing a melded Hydra and S.H.I.E.L.D. logo, and depicts the team divided by Coulson, Raina, and Ward. The poster for [...] "The Only Light in The Darkness", created by Pascal Campion, focuses on Coulson and his cellist lover, Audrey, while also hinting at the villain for the episode, Marcus Daniels. The poster for [...] "Nothing Personal", created by Stephanie Hans, [...] highlights Skye and Ward in a depiction of a moment from the episode, with Deathlok looming over them, and the S.H.I.E.L.D. logo in the background. The poster for [...] "Ragtag", created by Emma Ríos, depicts significant moments in Ward's life, as well as Fitz–Simmons in danger, and Skye looming behind the S.H.I.E.L.D. logo, as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> presence that Ward cannot seem to shake. The poster for [...] "Beginning of the End", created by Phantom City Creative, {{is reminiscent of the}} first official poster released, with differences including the characters' order and clothing, the poster's coloring, a broken S.H.I.E.L.D. logo over Hydra's, and Ward being tinted by Hydra.|$|E
500|$|A {{published}} synopsis in The Nickelodeon {{reads as}} follows, [...] "The night before Christmas, Alice, {{a child of}} wealth, after going through the usual form of hanging up her stocking, is put to bed by her maid. Alice falls asleep and dreams. Enter Santa Claus and Gnomes who tell Alice to follow her and they will show her part of their Funnyland. Alice follows the little people under the special protection of a policeman two foot high. The little party are seen trotting through beautiful glens and dales until they reach Funnyland. Santa Claus tells her that <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> good girl all the animals and toys here are hers; as Alice touches each one they come to life. The teddy bear steps out to dance with Alice. As Alice removes the cover from Doll's box the doll dances out, a little king gives a magical entertainment, a clown is very active and all the animals and dolls do some interesting act much to the surprise and delight of little Alice. At last, tired out, Alice falls asleep reclining upon the shoulders of Teddy bear. Then we see her again back in her own little bed. It is now Christmas morning. Her maid awakens and dresses her for the great event, takes her to the drawing room where she is welcomed by her parents to find that her dream has come true." [...] Originally the film was billed as being released for December 19, 1910 {{and then it was}} later claimed to be December 26, 1910. This release was attributed in an issue of The Nickelodeon. However, the film was not released on December 19 because an advertisement in Moving Picture World in January 1911 said that the release would be delayed for a [...] "few days". It is unknown, and unlikely, if the film actually was released because no other publications, ads or materials surrounding the Gnome Motion Picture Company followed.|$|E
