When rough lumber is reduced to dimensional lumber, a large electric motor or internal combustion engine will drive a thickness planer that removes a certain percentage of excess wood to create a uniform, smooth surface on all four sides of the board and in specialty woods, may also plane the cut edges.|$|E

2500|$|Different {{types of}} bench planes are {{designed}} to perform different tasks, with the name {{and size of the}} plane being defined by the use. [...] Bailey iron bench planes were designated by number respective to the length of the plane. [...] This has carried over through the type, regardless of manufacturer. [...] A No. 1 plane is but little more than five inches long. [...] A typical smoothing plane (approx. nineinches) is usually a No. 4, jack planes at about fourteeninches are No. 5, an eighteen inch foreplane will be a No. 6, and the <b>jointer</b> planes at twenty-two to twenty-four inches in length are No. 7 or 8 respectively. [...] A designation, such as No. 4½ indicates a plane of No. 4 length but slightly wider. A designation, such as 5-1/2 indicates the length of a No. 5 but slightly wider (actually, the width of a No. 6 or a No. 7), while a designation, such as 5-1/4 indicates the length of a No. 5 but slightly narrower (actually, the width of a No. 3). [...] "Bedrock" [...] versions of the above are simply 600 added to the base number (although no [...] "601" [...] was ever produced, such plane is indeed available from specialist dealers; 602 through 608, including all the fractionals, were made).|$|E

2500|$|European-style cabinet saws {{are often}} more complex and modern in design {{compared}} to American types. They often are equipped with a sliding table to make cross cuts easier and safer than {{by the use of}} an American style mitre gauge. Unless modified for the American market, European table saws are not equipped to allow the use of a stacked dado blade set (this is due to safety laws in European markets). Rip fences on European saws tend to be of lighter construction and less smooth in operation compared to American cabinet saws. European cabinet saws are often available in multi-purpose tool configurations that can offer <b>jointer,</b> planer, shaper or boring features. The blade arbor typically has a diameter of 30mm, though for the American market a [...] " [...] arbor is commonly available as an option. Note that American woodworkers are likely to use a stacked dado blade to cut dados (square sectioned grooves) where European woodworkers might use a shaper or other tool for this task. European cabinet saws often incorporate a riving knife to prevent kickback. Riving knives differ from American style splitters in that they rise and fall with the blade (splitters are fixed in place without regard for the height that the blade is adjusted to). Riving knives have since become commonplace on newer American-market tablesaws due to the Consumer Products Safety Commission and UL recommendation in the early to mid-2000s that American-market saws have riving knives (UL std. 987.) European cabinet saws often offer as an option a scoring blade, which is a second, smaller diameter blade mounted in front of the regular saw blade. The scoring blade helps reduce splintering in certain types of stock, especially laminated stock. As of 2015, European-style sliding cabinet saws have a small following in the U.S. They are either imported from European manufacturers such as Felder, Hammer, and Robland or sold directly by U.S. based-companies such as Grizzly Industrial.|$|E
50|$|The <b>jointer</b> plane (also {{known as}} the try plane or trying plane) {{is a type of}} hand plane used {{primarily}} to straighten the edges of boards in the operation known as jointing. A <b>jointer</b> plane may also be used to flatten the face of a board. Its long length is designed to 'ride over' the undulations of an uneven surface, skimming off the peaks, gradually creating a flat surface. In thicknessing or preparing rough stock, the <b>jointer</b> plane is usually preceded by the fore plane or jack plane and followed by the smoothing plane.|$|E

50|$|Thickness planers and <b>jointers</b> {{are often}} {{combined}} into one machine, {{with the work}} piece passing underneath the same rotating blade for thicknessing, but in the opposite direction. In the US {{this is called a}} planer-thicknesser or over-and-under.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>jointer</b> derives {{its name}} from its primary {{function}} of producing flat edges on boards prior to joining them edge-to-edge to produce wider boards.

50|$|Edge {{jointing}} or just jointing is {{the process}} of making the edge of a wooden board straight and true in preparation for subsequent operations, often ultimately leading to joining two or more components together. Traditionally, jointing was performed using a <b>jointer</b> plane. Modern techniques include the use of a <b>jointer</b> machine, a hand held router and straight edge, or a table-mounted router.|$|E
50|$|Generally speaking, spindle {{speeds and}} feed rates are less {{critical}} in woodworking than metalworking. Most woodworking machines including power saws such as circular saws and band saws, <b>jointers,</b> Thickness planers rotate {{at a fixed}} RPM. In those machines, cutting speed is regulated through the feed rate. The required feed rate can be extremely variable depending {{on the power of}} the motor, the hardness of the wood or other material being machined, and the sharpness of the cutting tool.|$|R
50|$|Fundamentally, a <b>jointer's</b> table {{arrangement}} is designed with two levels like a narrower thickness planer {{so that it}} consists of two long, narrow parallel tables in a row with a cutter head recessed between them, but with a side guide. This cutter head is typically driven by an electric induction motor. (Older machines were driven by belts from line shafts.) A moveable fence is normally set perpendicular to the tables, though some models may allow settings (adjustments) to various angles.|$|R

[...] and divested its woodworking product lines to focus on industrial machinery. In 1985, the 600 Group acquired parts of Clausing. The Clausing brand is still used today. The 600 Group, which had earlier also acquired the UK's Colchester and T.S. Harrison lathe brands (in 1954 and 1971, respectively), also recombined the branding to include the Clausing Colchester (North America only) and Colchester Harrison names.|$|R

40|$|Residential {{buildings}} are now better engineered to manage rainwater following the leaking building problem in New Zealand. The next {{challenge is to}} improve the weathertightness of medium-rise buildings which often use joint details widely applied on low-rise buildings but are subject to higher wind pressures and surface runoff rates. This study begins to address this challenge by measuring the water leakage performance limits of the following common flashings with static and dynamic rain and wind loads to see how their performance might be improved: (a) Horizontal H and Z <b>jointers</b> between direct fixed sheet claddings; (b) The window head flashing in a cavity wall; (c) A horizontal apron flashing at the junction between a roof and wall. At this stage, water penetration resistances have been measured but the data has not yet been discussed in the context of wind pressures and rain loads on mid-rise buildings. All of the joints were found to resist water leakage to pressures equivalent to the hydrostatic head of the upstand, so long as there were no air leakage paths through the joint. When vents were added, or openings were present that might arise due to construction tolerances, then the onset pressure for leakage was found to fall by as much as 50 %. Vents, of course, are essential for ventilation drying in rainscreen walls and even with vents present, the onset of leakage was at generally at least twice the 50 Pa wet wall test pressure applied in New Zealand. Opportunities were found to improve the way vented joints deal with runoff by enlarging the gap between the cladding and flashing. This prevented the outer joint volume from filling with water and occluding the vents. The apron flashing was found to cope better than a window head joint with runoff, because of the larger 35 mm vertical gap between the cladding and apron...|$|R
