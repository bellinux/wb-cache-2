5000|$|Some {{environmental}} {{groups such as}} Friends of the River have questioned {{the effectiveness of the}} Temperance <b>Flat</b> <b>project</b> on increasing surface water supplies in California, calling it [...] "an expensive and ineffective solution to the state's water needs". In addition, the placement of the Temperance Flat Dam at RM 274 would reduce the capacity of Millerton Lake by 75,000 acre feet, a capacity greater than 150 of California's current reservoirs.|$|E

50|$|In 1979, Noonan {{became the}} first {{scriptwriter}} to be awarded a Robert Burns Fellowship by the University of Otago. During this time he wrote two series which were cancelled before going into production, notably one based on Bill Pearson's novel Coal Flat. The cancellation was, in part, due to financial concerns, especially given that The Governor had proved controversial over its high production costs. Television New Zealand was approached again over the Coal <b>Flat</b> <b>project</b> in 2002, but funding was declined. Noonan later successfully adapted Roger Hall's stage play Glide Time into a long-running television comedy series, Gliding On.|$|E
50|$|Unfortunately for the USACE, Roosevelt's successor, Harry S. Truman, {{was also}} adamant that Pine Flat Dam be built for irrigation. Truman impounded the initial {{funds for the}} dam's {{construction}} and promised not to release it until the USACE and USBR could reach an agreement on the proportions of funding that would go to irrigation and flood control. To further complicate the situation, Truman insisted that the USBR negotiate the contracts for irrigation water from Pine Flat Dam with KRWA farmers. In a last-ditch effort to secure the Pine <b>Flat</b> <b>project,</b> the USBR revoked its acreage limit from {{the entirety of the}} Kings River service area and the Tulare Lake bed. After two years of legal battles, the share of project cost devoted to irrigation was settled at $14.25 million, {{less than half of the}} dam's $33.5 million price tag. On February 18, 1947, the president released the funds, finally allowing construction on Pine Flat Dam to begin.|$|E
40|$|Natural gas {{resources}} is {{abundant in the}} Ordos Basin, where six gas fields with more than 100 billion cubic meters of gas reserves have been successively developed and proved, including Jingbian, Yulin, Zizhou, Wushenqi, Sulige and Shenmu. This study aims to summarize the fruitful results and functional practices achieved in the huge gas province exploration, which will be regarded as guidance and reference for the further exploration and development in this basin. Based on the past five decades' successful exploration practices made by PetroChina Changqing Oilfield Company, we first comb the presentation of geological theories at different historical stages {{as well as the}} breakthrough in the course. Then, we analyze a complete set of adaptive techniques obtained from the long-time technological research and conclude historical experiences and effective measures in terms of broadening exploration ideas, such as the fluvial delta reservoir-forming theory, giant tight gas reservoir-forming theory, the idea of sediment source system in the southern basin, etc., and innovating technical and management mechanism, such as all-digit seismic prediction, fine logging evaluation for gas formations, stimulation of tight sand reservoirs, <b>flat</b> <b>project</b> and benchmarking management, and so on...|$|E
