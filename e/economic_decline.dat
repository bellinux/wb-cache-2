5|$|Aerospace, steel, ship building, retail, services, construction, medicine, and {{manufacturing}} are Mobile's major industries. After experiencing <b>economic</b> <b>decline</b> for several decades, Mobile's economy began to rebound {{in the late}} 1980s. Between 1993 and 2003 roughly 13,983 new jobs were created as 87 new companies were founded and 399 existing companies were expanded.|$|E
5|$|Despite the city's <b>economic</b> <b>decline,</b> it {{has benefited}} from a low cost of living, {{attracting}} immigrants and refugees from around the world. Among the new waves of immigrants are Muslim Bosnians and Buddhist Vietnamese. Further bolstering the city are its commercial, educational and cultural ties to the Capital District and Syracuse metropolitan areas.|$|E
5|$|In the 2000s, <b>economic</b> <b>decline</b> in {{the music}} {{industry}} dramatically reduced readership and advertising from Billboards traditional audience. Circulation declined from 40,000 in circulation in the 1990s to less than 17,000 by 2014. The publication's staff and ownership were also undergoing frequent changes.|$|E
50|$|Extensive {{education}} {{reforms were}} supposedly carried out and 'scientific development efforts' also supposedly made during his years. These supposed policies {{could not be}} sustained after 1965, and the economy collapsed {{and led to the}} <b>economic</b> <b>declines</b> which he was unable to control.|$|R

5|$|This first castle {{was used}} only briefly {{and seems to}} have been {{abandoned}} {{by the middle of the}} 12th century. The grain stores were destroyed by fire, but the reason for this is uncertain. By this period, the town of Lydford as a whole was also in serious <b>economic</b> <b>decline.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although Utica's {{population}} is predominantly European American, it has diversified since the 1990s. New immigrants and refugees have included Bosnians (displaced by the Bosnian War), Russians, Burmese, Vietnamese, and Latinos. More than 15 languages are spoken in the city. Utica {{has a low}} cost of living but its industrial and <b>economic</b> <b>decline</b> have posed difficulties for people {{trying to make a}} new start.|$|E
5|$|In the 1830s, the District's {{southern}} {{territory of}} Alexandria went into <b>economic</b> <b>decline</b> {{partly due to}} neglect by Congress. The city of Alexandria was a major market in the American slave trade, and pro-slavery residents feared that abolitionists in Congress would end slavery in the District, further depressing the economy. Alexandria's citizens petitioned Virginia {{to take back the}} land it had donated to form the District, through a process known as retrocession.|$|E
25|$|A global {{recession}} is recession that affects many {{countries around the}} world—that is, a period of global <b>economic</b> slowdown or <b>declining</b> <b>economic</b> output.|$|R
5000|$|Because the Event Group {{arranges}} many {{events for}} companies {{involved in the}} oil industry, its business is strongly affected by the Alberta economy; <b>economic</b> <b>declines</b> caused by the drop in oil prices in 2009 and in 2015 led to many events being cancelled those years. [...] The company also {{lost much of its}} Calgary business in 2013 because of disastrous flooding in the city.|$|R
25|$|Although mining {{provided}} much of {{the limited}} revenue Honduras generated for the Spanish crown, {{a majority of the}} inhabitants were engaged in agriculture. Attempts to promote agricultural exports had limited success, however, and most production remained on a subsistence level. If anything, the province became more rural during the 17th and 18th centuries. As a result of <b>economic</b> <b>declines</b> or foreign attacks, several town governments simply ceased to function during this period.|$|R
5|$|The feudalising of {{the society}} during the Angevin rule reduced royal wealth and treasury. The {{dependence}} of the Angevin on north Italian commerce and financing by Florentine bankers were the main factors {{which led to the}} decline of the Kingdom's economy. The continuation of the <b>economic</b> <b>decline</b> combined with the increased population and urbanization led to decrease of agrarian production.|$|E
5|$|The {{towns and}} cities along the lower basin of the river {{are some of the}} oldest in Florida, and their {{histories}} have centered on the river. Both Palatka and Green Cove Springs have been popular tourist destinations in the past. Several smaller locations along the river sprang up around ferry landings, but when rail lines and then Interstate highways were constructed closer to the Atlantic Coast, many of the towns experienced significant <b>economic</b> <b>decline,</b> and ferry landings were forgotten.|$|E
5|$|After {{the defeat}} of Austria-Hungary in World War I and the Treaty of Rapallo of 1920, Rijeka became an {{independent}} city-state known as the Free State of Fiume. That {{marked the beginning of}} the port's decline, as it lost a large portion of its major market, Hungary. Italy annexed Rijeka in 1924 by the Treaty of Rome, and the port became peripherally located, with no modern railway or road links to the rest of the country, further adding to the already obvious <b>economic</b> <b>decline.</b>|$|E

50|$|Singapore, at {{the time}} of British colony, was {{integrated}} into the world economy and suffered <b>economic</b> <b>declines</b> like other trading cities. However the people of Singapore were resilient in coping. Those who remained in the city used complex relationships among Chinese kinfolk; they shared food, housing, and clothing, and minimized the negative impacts. They spread work around, and provided an intelligence network to assist relatives in finding temporary employment. The safety valve of emigration to rural areas reduced the overall negative impact.|$|R
30|$|The cell-level {{analysis}} {{we provide}} has the weakness that we cannot control for individual fixed effects. However, {{we believe that}} our cell-level findings can nonetheless provide important insights. We have argued that treatment effects of unemployment duration could be themselves {{a function of the}} broader labor market context. In particular, it is possible to find negligible health effects of unemployment losses in “normal times” and large and persistent effects after sharp <b>economic</b> <b>declines.</b> In this way our results provide a possible explanation for labor market hysteresis following big declines.|$|R
5|$|Biden's {{father had}} been very well-off earlier in his life, but {{suffered}} several business reversals {{by the time his}} son was born. For several years, the family had to live with Biden's maternal grandparents, the Finnegans. When the Scranton area went into <b>economic</b> <b>decline</b> during the 1950s, Biden's father could not find enough work. In 1953, the Biden family moved to an apartment in Claymont, Delaware, where they lived for a few years before moving to a house in Wilmington, Delaware. Joe Biden Sr. was then more successful as a used car salesman, and the family's circumstances were middle class.|$|E
5|$|Deptford {{experienced}} <b>economic</b> <b>decline</b> in the 20th {{century with}} {{the closing of}} the docks, and the damage caused by the bombing during the Second World War - a V-2 rocket destroyed a Woolworths store (now New Cross Gate), killing 160 people. High unemployment caused some of the population to move away as the riverside industries closed down in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The local council have developed plans with private companies to regenerate the riverside area, and the town centre.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} half of the 18th century, Lima was {{adversely}} affected by the Bourbon Reforms as it lost its monopoly on overseas trade and the important mining region of Upper Peru was transferred to the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata. This <b>economic</b> <b>decline</b> made the city's elite dependent on royal and ecclesiastical appointment and thus, reluctant to advocate independence. In the 1810s, the city became a Royalist stronghold during the South American wars of independence led by a strong viceroy, José Fernando de Abascal y Sousa.|$|E
40|$|It {{has often}} been claimed that {{measures}} designed to stimulate capital formation {{at the national level}} will accelerate the decline of regions that are not growing. A number of simple models are employed to evaluate this claim, and it is found that the effect of national subsidies is ambiguous. Further, it is shown that on average the form of capital stimulus used in the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 will tend to help higher-tax regions, which tend to be those that have experienced relative <b>economic</b> <b>declines</b> in recent years...|$|R
30|$|Another form {{of working}} time {{flexibility}} is part-time work. As <b>economic</b> activity <b>declined</b> during the crisis, the working time of employed persons was reduced and full-time workers were given part-time work.|$|R
50|$|Sarg {{no longer}} innovated {{as much as}} {{competing}} puppet studios, and his <b>economic</b> fortunes <b>declined</b> as others gained a following; he both went into bankruptcy, and mounted his last production, in 1939.|$|R
5|$|Following {{the reunification}} of Jerusalem in 1967, the city {{embarked}} on significant expansion. Large commercial centers were opened in the new, outlying neighborhoods of Talpiot, Givat Shaul, and Malha, drawing customers {{away from the city}} center. Government offices began moving out as well, precipitating the <b>economic</b> <b>decline</b> of the Downtown Triangle in the 1970s. The clientele of the upscale European boutiques had also aged, and the neighborhoods adjacent to downtown became occupied by poor and Haredi Jews who did not patronize the Triangle. The elegant shops gave way to hummus restaurants, dollar stores, and money changers. The advent of television precipitated the closure of most of the Triangle's cinemas.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the reunification}} of Jerusalem in 1967, the city {{embarked}} on significant expansion. Large commercial centers were opened in the new, outlying neighborhoods of Talpiot, Givat Shaul, and Malha, weaning customers {{away from the city}} center. Government offices began moving out as well, precipitating the <b>economic</b> <b>decline</b> of the Downtown Triangle in the 1970s. The advent of television precipitated the closure of most of the Triangle's cinemas. The Zion Cinema closed in 1972 and was demolished. In its place, a high-rise building containing the Kikar Zion Hotel (on the upper floors) and a branch of Bank Hapoalim (on the lower floors) was erected.|$|E
5|$|From the 1st century AD onwards, Cassel {{developed}} into a key urban centre for the whole region with an extensive road network converging on the hill. Towards {{the end of the}} 3rd century, however, repeated invasions of Germanic tribes caused devastation throughout the region and at least 80% of settlements in the area are thought to have been abandoned, accompanied by a general <b>economic</b> <b>decline.</b> Cassel was fortified with a circuit of walls at around this time but suffered its own decline, which was reflected in its loss of status as a regional capital; Tournai took over as the capital of the newly constituted Civitas Turnacensium.|$|E
40|$|The dynamic {{network of}} {{relationships}} among corporations underlies cascading economic failures including {{the current economic}} crisis, and can be inferred from correlations in market value fluctuations. We analyze the time dependence of the network of correlations to reveal the changing relationships among the financial, technology, and basic materials sectors with rising and falling markets and resource constraints. The financial sector links otherwise weakly coupled economic sectors, particularly during <b>economic</b> <b>declines.</b> Such links increase economic risk {{and the extent of}} cascading failures. Our results suggest that firewalls between financial services for different sectors would reduce systemic risk without hampering economic growth. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} Taimei Town, {{which is}} located within the new industrial city of Shiranui, Ariake and Omuta". It will be clarified how the maintenance of industrial infrastructure of Taimei Town is connected with its regional development policy. What kind of regional development policies are necessary to enable industrial cities to become independent will also be discussed. Recently {{a lot of small}} and medium-sized local cities have been experiencing remarkable <b>economic</b> <b>declines</b> due to large population decreases and the aging of their populations. Through the use of its own local resources, Taimei Town has aimed to become self-reliant and its effective efforts at unique community building merit attention...|$|R
5|$|Hoover was {{defeated}} for re-election by Roosevelt in the 1932 presidential election. Roosevelt {{was convinced that}} federal activism was needed to reverse the country's <b>economic</b> <b>decline.</b> In his first hundred days in office, the Congress enacted at Roosevelt's request a series of bills designed to strengthen the banking system, including the Emergency Banking Act, the Glass–Steagall Act (which created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation), and the 1933 Banking Act. The Congress also passed the Agricultural Adjustment Act to stabilize the nation's agricultural industry.|$|E
5|$|In April 1941, Yugoslavia was {{occupied}} by Nazi Germany and Italy, the latter annexing or occupying the Croatian Littoral, although the armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces of World War II and the 1947 Treaty of Peace with Italy reversed wartime Italian territorial gains, awarding the entire region and adjacent territory to Yugoslavia and the Federal State of Croatia. After the fall of communism, Yugoslavia broke apart as Slovenia and Croatia declared independence in 1991. Although the region suffered an <b>economic</b> <b>decline</b> during the Croatian War of Independence, there was no fighting in the region.|$|E
5|$|In the 20th century Scotland {{made a major}} {{contribution}} to the British participation in {{the two world wars}} and suffered relative <b>economic</b> <b>decline,</b> which only began to be offset with the exploitation of North Sea Oil and Gas from the 1970s and the development of new technologies and service industries. This was mirrored by a growing sense of cultural and political distinctiveness, which {{towards the end of the}} century, culminated in the establishment of a separate Scottish Parliament within the confines of the United Kingdom.|$|E
40|$|Poverty {{remains the}} {{overriding}} social determinant for the neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), {{but over the}} last several decades, we have also seen how political destabilization or even outright conflict can hasten <b>economic</b> <b>declines</b> and promote a substantial uptick in NTD incidence and prevalence [1]. Recent examples include the emergence of Ebola virus infection in West Africa [2], visceral leishmaniasis and other NTDs in East Africa [3, 4], and cutaneous leishmaniasis in the Middle East and North Africa [5], as well as guerilla activities linked to the drug trade in Latin America [6]. Vector-borne (taken here to encompass diseases transmitted by arthropods or snails) and zoonotic NTDs have been disproportionately represented among these emerging or reemerging infections...|$|R
50|$|After {{experiencing}} GDP growth averaging {{nearly six}} {{percent a year}} in the late 1990s, <b>economic</b> growth <b>declined</b> considerably after 2001 {{as a result of a}} decline in the tourism industry following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, and damages caused by several hurricanes.|$|R
50|$|<b>Economic</b> {{opportunities}} <b>declined</b> at {{the turn}} of the 20th century, and the village was annexed by the city of Kingston in 1952. Portsmouth Village is home to Portsmouth Olympic Harbour, which held the yachting and boating events of the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal.|$|R
