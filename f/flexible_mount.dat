5|$|Further {{armament}} was {{to consist}} of a 128mm anti-tank gun of the type used in the Jagdtiger or Maus, two 15mm Mauser MG 151/15 autocannons, and eight 20mm Flak 38 anti-aircraft guns, probably with at least four {{of them as a}} Flakvierling quad mount. The 128mm anti-tank gun's precise location on the Ratte is a point of contention among historians, most believing {{that it would have been}} mounted within the primary turret, with some others thinking a smaller secondary turret at the rear of the Ratte more logical. Some concept drawings exist to suggest a <b>flexible</b> <b>mount</b> on the glacis plate. The tank was to be provided with a vehicle bay that could hold two BMW R12 motorcycles for scouting, and several smaller storage rooms, a compact infirmary area, and a self-contained lavatory system.|$|E
25|$|The Fairchild AT-21 was an American World War II {{specialized}} bomber crew trainer, {{intended to}} train crews {{in the use}} of power gun turrets or a gun on a <b>flexible</b> <b>mount,</b> as well as learn to function {{as a member of a}} crew. It had a brief career as a training aircraft before modified bombers took over this role.|$|E
25|$|Short of funds, Hawks {{decided not}} to rebuild the {{aircraft}} and sold {{the rights to the}} design, including engineering data to Tri-American Aviation, a concern that wanted to convert the design into a fast two-seat attack/observation aircraft. The aircraft was redesigned to include two machine guns in the wings and another machine gun mounted in a <b>flexible</b> <b>mount</b> in the new rear cockpit.|$|E

25|$|It {{made its}} maiden flight on 18 August 1911, flown by de Havilland. It was fitted with floats in April 1912, first flying {{in this form}} on 12 April 1912, but was underpowered and its engine was {{therefore}} replaced by a 70hp (52kW) Gnome, this allowed it to take off carrying a passenger while fitted with floats. Later in the year the F.E.2, refitted with a landplane undercarriage, was modified to carry a Maxim machine gun on a <b>flexible</b> <b>mount</b> in the nose.|$|E
25|$|Armament {{consisted}} of a single Madsen 23 mm cannon on a <b>flexible</b> <b>mount</b> in the nose, together with four 7.9mm FN-Browning machine guns {{in the side of}} the nacelle. It was intended that the cannon would be fixed during air-to-air combat, but that for ground strafing operations, the cannon would be released and aimed manually by the pilot, with an automatic stabilising system controlling the aircraft's ailerons and elevators to aid the pilot in keeping control of the aircraft while busy aiming and firing the cannon.|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} {{specially}} modified variants included a Boeing 247Y appropriated from United for Air Corps {{use as a}} test aircraft fitted with two machine guns in the nose. The same installation later was fitted to a 247Y owned by Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek; this aircraft also featured a Colt [...]50 caliber machine gun in a <b>flexible</b> <b>mount.</b> A 247D purchased by the British Royal Air Force became a test craft for new equipment, featuring a nonstandard nose, new powerplants and fixed landing gear.|$|E

2500|$|The ANF Les Mureaux 180C.2 first flew on 10 February 1935 with a [...] Hispano-Suiza 12Xbrs {{engine and}} a single fin and rudder. In April 1935 the 180 was {{modified}} with a Hispano-Suiza 12Xcrs motor-canon engine, it had 20mm cannon that fired through the propeller hub. The aircraft was also fitted with two wing-mounted 7.5mm machine guns. The observer also had a machine gun mounted on a <b>flexible</b> <b>mount</b> and the tail unit was changed to two vertical surfaces. It continued to be tested until April 1936 but the project was abandoned when the design {{was considered to be}} obsolete.|$|E
2500|$|The XSB2A-1's {{design was}} heavily {{based on the}} earlier Brewster SBA scout-bomber. Sharing the single-engined, mid-winged {{monoplane}} layout of the earlier aircraft, but was larger and had a more powerful engine. The XSB2A-1 was powered by a single Wright R-2600 engine which drove a three-bladed propeller. It was armed with two forward-firing 0.50 inch machine guns in the fuselage and two 0.30 machine guns in each wing. While the type was initially intended to have an enclosed gun turret, this was replaced with a <b>flexible</b> <b>mount</b> {{in the rear of}} the cockpit for another pair of 0.30 machine guns following initial flight testing. The aircraft could carry up to [...] of bombs in an internal bomb bay.|$|E
2500|$|The {{oil cooler}} was housed with the coolant {{radiator}} {{in a big}} airscoop {{on top of the}} engine cowling, closer to the cockpit than was the case on the Il-2. The gunner's position was enclosed in the armored shell, unlike that in the Il-2, and was equipped with a [...] Berezin UBK machine gun on a VU-8 <b>flexible</b> <b>mount.</b> Otherwise the gun armament was identical to the older aircraft with a pair of [...] VYa cannon with a total 300 rounds and a pair of [...] ShKAS machine guns with 1500 rounds in the wings. Optionally two [...] Nudelman-Suranov NS-37s could be installed instead of the VYa-23 cannon. The rear fuselage was lengthened by [...] to improve airflow and the landing gear was lengthened to accommodate the larger propeller. The landing gear nacelles were modified accordingly.|$|E

50|$|A {{change of}} fashion {{in the late}} 1920s led to a demand for gloss painted bodies and the fabric market disappeared. A system was {{developed}} using metal panels with a similar <b>flexible</b> <b>mounting</b> allowing movement between panels. It was used on coachbuilt bodies {{but it did not}} suit the demands of mass-production.|$|R
2500|$|During {{this time}} the {{squadron}} flew many types of aircraft. These aircraft included Douglas O-2 1926–1928; Curtiss A-3 Falcon 1928–1934; Curtiss A-12 Shrike 1934–1936 (including Curtis A-8s & O-19s during 1932–1936); and the Northrop A-17 1936–1940. The squadron participated in {{a great amount of}} work in connection with experiment, practice and development of aviation [...] in general and attack aviation in particular. It progressed from the DH-4B type aircraft to the A-12, which was the immediate forerunner of the Northrup A-17 and A-17A. At Fort Crockett the squadron began flying the Curtis A-3 Falcon in 1926. It boasted four forward-firing [...]30-caliber machine guns and another two on a <b>flexible</b> <b>mount</b> in the rear cockpit. Powered by a 430-horsepower engine, the Falcon could carry 200 pounds of bombs attached to wing racks. Although carrying a lighter bomb load, the A-3 proved better in the attack role than the DH-4. The A-3B replaced the A-3. In 1934 the aircraft would be used to carry mail.|$|E
2500|$|Seversky {{also built}} a two-seater, the 2PA. Evolved in {{parallel}} with the P-35, the 2PA was a two-seat fighter and fighter-bomber with a fundamentally similar airframe and offered with either a similar undercarriage {{to that of the}} single-seater as the 2PA-L (Land) or with an amphibious float undercarriage as the 2PA-A (Amphibian). Dubbed [...] "Convoy Fighter" [...] by the manufacturer, the 2PA was powered by a Wright R-1820-G2 or G3 Cyclone nine-cylinder radial engine, the former rated at 1,000hp for take-off and the latter at 875hp. Armament comprised two wing-mounted 7.62mm or 12.7mm Browning guns, one 7.62mm Browning on a <b>flexible</b> <b>mount</b> in the rear cockpit, plus two forward-firing fuselage-mounted 7.62mm or 12.7mm Browning guns. Provision was made for a bomb load of up to 227kg (500lb) on internal wing racks. One 2PA-A and one 2PA-L were procured by the Soviet Union in March 1938, one with conventional landing gear and one with floats, along with the manufacturing license, but it appears that the Soviets never put it into production. In what proved to be an unpopular move for Seversky, 20 2PA-B3s were sold to the Japanese Navy, which briefly employed them in the Second Sino-Japanese War as Navy Type S Two-Seat Fighter or A8V-1 (Allied codename [...] "Dick"). The Japanese were unimpressed with the aircraft and eventually relegated two of them to the Asahi Shimbun newspaper as [...] "hacks." [...] Sweden ordered 52 2PAs (Swedish designation B 6), able to carry 1,350lb (612kg) of bombs, but received only two prior to the U.S. embargo directed to combatants. The remaining 50 were appropriated by the USAAC, re-armed with 0.30in and 0.50in machine guns, and used as advanced trainers named AT-12 Guardsman.|$|E
