40|$|Hydroseeding may be {{applicable}} to restoration of brine spills as {{it is used to}} revegetate large areas cost effectively with little perturbation. To test whether seeds applied to brine-contaminated soil via hydroseeding will germinate and survive, and whether surface applied organic matter will enhance establishment of plants, a field experiment in LaSalle Parish, Louisiana was conducted. Forty- 29. 25 m- 2 plots were treated with mulch (recycled newsprint), seed (Festuca arundinacea, Panicum virgatum, Cynodon dactylon, Lolium perenne, and Trifolium repens), mulch and seed, water or no treatment. All plots received fertilizer and lime. After 22 weeks, vegetative cover was greater in plots receiving mulch and seed relative to plots with water only or no treatment. Number of shoots tended to respond similarly. Aboveground biomass did not differ between treatments. Thus organic matter and seed applied with a <b>hydroseeder</b> improved revegetation on a brine spill...|$|E
40|$|To {{control the}} {{formation}} of acid drainage at its source, the Bureau of Mines has investigated the role of iron-oxidizing bacteria in the oxidation of pyrite. In laboratory tests, {{it was determined that}} Thio-bacillus ferrooxidans could be controlled in coal refuse using anionic surfactants, with an associated decrease in acid production of about 75 pet. Based on these results, large-scale tests were conducted at an 8 -acre active coal refuse area in northern West Virginia and an 11 -acre inactive refuse pile in southern West Virginia. Acid production was decreased 60 to 95 pet for 4 to 5 months after application of 55 gal/ acre of 30 -pct sodium lauryl sulfate solution. To date, effluent surfactant concentrations have been extremely low. Either a <b>hydroseeder</b> or a road-watering truck can be used to apply the surfactant. Since the surfactant solution must reach the pyritic material to be effective, sites that have been reclaimed are generally not amenable to these procedures. A simple laboratory test is described that provides an estimate of adsorption potential; this can be used to calculate a safe application rate...|$|E
