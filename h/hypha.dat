5|$|The {{yellowish}} hyphae {{are between}} 15 and 13.5μm wide with {{a wall of}} variable thickness. There are clamp connections at the septa (the walls dividing individual <b>hypha</b> cells). The flesh in the cap is radial, and {{is made up of}} yellowish hyphae of between 2.4 and 20μm wide. The pileipellis, the outermost layer of hyphae, forms a cutis, and on older specimens (and on the small scales) forms a trichoderm.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanical}} pressure {{exerted by}} the appressorium is generated from physiological processes that increase intracellular turgor by producing osmolytes such as glycerol. Adaptations {{such as these}} are complemented by hydrolytic enzymes secreted into the environment to digest large organic molecules—such as polysaccharides, proteins, and lipids—into smaller molecules that may then be absorbed as nutrients. The vast majority of filamentous fungi grow in a polar fashion (extending in one direction) by elongation at the tip (apex) of the <b>hypha.</b> Other forms of fungal growth include intercalary extension (longitudinal expansion of hyphal compartments that are below the apex) {{as in the case}} of some endophytic fungi, or growth by volume expansion during the development of mushroom stipes and other large organs. Growth of fungi as multicellular structures consisting of somatic and reproductive cells—a feature independently evolved in animals and plants—has several functions, including the development of fruit bodies for dissemination of sexual spores (see above) and biofilms for substrate colonization and intercellular communication.|$|E
5|$|Most fungi grow as hyphae, {{which are}} cylindrical, thread-like {{structures}} 2–10µm {{in diameter and}} up to several centimeters in length. Hyphae grow at their tips (apices); new hyphae are typically formed by emergence of new tips along existing hyphae by a process called branching, or occasionally growing hyphal tips fork, giving rise to two parallel-growing hyphae. Hyphae also sometimes fuse when they come into contact, a process called hyphal fusion (or anastamosis). These growth processes {{lead to the development}} of a mycelium, an interconnected network of hyphae. Hyphae can be either septate or coenocytic. Septate hyphae are divided into compartments separated by cross walls (internal cell walls, called septa, that are formed at right angles to the cell wall giving the <b>hypha</b> its shape), with each compartment containing one or more nuclei; coenocytic hyphae are not compartmentalized. Septa have pores that allow cytoplasm, organelles, and sometimes nuclei to pass through; an example is the dolipore septum in fungi of the phylum Basidiomycota. Coenocytic hyphae are in essence multinucleate supercells.|$|E
5|$|The main {{structure}} of the fruit body consists primarily of an agglutination (mass) of interwoven skeletal <b>hyphae,</b> which are golden- to rust-brown. The <b>hyphae</b> are unbranched, forming long tubes 2 to 3.6μm in diameter, enveloping a lumen of variable thickness. There are also hyaline generative <b>hyphae.</b> These <b>hyphae</b> have thinner walls than the skeletal <b>hyphae,</b> and are also septate (possessing of septa), but are sometimes branched. They measure 2 to 3μm in diameter. The flesh, again, is primarily made up of skeletal <b>hyphae</b> with some generative <b>hyphae.</b> The thick-walled skeletal <b>hyphae</b> are a yellow-brown to rust brown, and are slightly less agglutinate. The <b>hyphae</b> in the flesh are a little smaller; the skeletal <b>hyphae</b> measure 1.8 to 3.4μm in diameter, while the generative <b>hyphae</b> measure 1.5 to 2.6μm in diameter.|$|R
50|$|From the fertilized ascogonium, dinucleate <b>hyphae</b> {{emerge in}} which each cell {{contains}} two nuclei. These <b>hyphae</b> are called ascogenous or fertile <b>hyphae.</b> They are supported by the vegetative mycelium containing uni- (or mono-) nucleate <b>hyphae,</b> which are sterile. The mycelium containing both sterile and fertile <b>hyphae</b> may grow into fruiting body, the ascocarp, which may contain millions of fertile <b>hyphae.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{branch of}} <b>hyphae</b> {{grows out of}} a {{vegetative}} <b>hyphae</b> eventually arching back to the parent <b>hyphae</b> and fuses with it to make a loop. This process repeats from any <b>hyphae</b> along any existing branches or a new parent <b>hyphae.</b> The nets are immediately adhesive, and <b>hyphae</b> in the loop have different organelles to trap nematodes which are not found in vegetative cells.|$|R
5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} in the scientific literature in 1928 as Collybia cirrhata var. cookei by the Italian mycologist Giacomo Bresadola. In a 1935 publication, Jean D. Arnold reported a series of cultural studies with monokaryon isolates (<b>hypha</b> having only a single haploid nucleus) of several Collybia species to determine their mating type. All attempts to produce hybrids between C.cirrhata var. cookei and C.cirrata or mycelial fusions between the two species failed. This sexual incompatibility indicated that the two taxa were separate species, and she raised the taxon from varietal to specific status, calling it Collybia cookei. The species has also been called Microcollybia cookei in a 1979 publication by Joanne Lennox, but the genus Microcollybia has since been folded into Collybia. Marcel Bon and Régis Courtecuisse considered the species a variety of Collybia tuberosa in a 1988 publication. A 2001 molecular analysis based on the ribosomal DNA sequences confirmed that C.cookei is phylogenetically related to C.tuberosa and C.cirrhata, and that the three species form a monophyletic group that comprise the genus Collybia.|$|E
25|$|In mycology, a stolon {{is defined}} as an {{occasionally}} septate <b>hypha,</b> which connects sporangiophores together. Root-like structures called rhizoids may appear on the stolon as well, anchoring the hyphae to the substrate. The stolon is commonly found in bread molds, and are seen as horizontally expanding across the mold.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} microscopic feature for identification of mushrooms is the spores. Their color, shape, size, attachment, ornamentation, and reaction to chemical tests often {{can be the}} crux of an identification. A spore often has a protrusion at one end, called an apiculus, which {{is the point of}} attachment to the basidium, termed the apical germ pore, from which the <b>hypha</b> emerges when the spore germinates.|$|E
50|$|There are {{multiple}} types of <b>hyphae</b> within L. hoffmannii. Ones to note are fine soft rot <b>hyphae,</b> T-branch <b>hyphae</b> and proboscis <b>hyphae.</b> T-branch <b>hyphae,</b> which penetrate the wood cell wall, arise from lumen-colonizing <b>hyphae.</b> During {{early stages of}} their development, T-branch <b>hyphae</b> contain few cellular organelles; later on in that development, the T-branch arms elongate, complexifying the internal organization of the <b>hyphae.</b> The tip of the T-branch is lacking in hyphal distortion, as well. Proboscis <b>hyphae,</b> when young, exhibit a similar ultrastructural organization and overall diameter to young T-branch <b>hyphae</b> upon emergence from the cone region of parent cavities. They are also fine (only 0.24 µm in diameter (0.34 µm diam including the fungal cell wall) with the tips showing an electron-dense zone. The occurrence of membrane configurations {{at the base of}} fine <b>hyphae</b> within proboscis <b>hyphae</b> has importance {{when it comes to the}} transport and release of extracellular lytic enzymes. Hyphal diameter is measured to be 0.87 to 1.82 µm.|$|R
50|$|The mycelium, which {{grows in}} the host tree, is heterothallic and tetrapolar. Lenzites warnieri has a trimitic trama, meaning a tissue {{comprising}} generative <b>hyphae,</b> binding <b>hyphae,</b> and skeletal <b>hyphae.</b> While the generative <b>hyphae</b> are responsible for growth, the hardened skeletal <b>hyphae</b> and the thick-walled binding <b>hyphae</b> maintain {{the stability of the}} fruit body and provide its corky consistency. The generative <b>hyphae</b> are thin-walled, hyaline, measure 2-3 µm in diameter and have a clamp connection. The binding <b>hyphae</b> are tough, spiral and heavily branched. They are 3-5 µm in diameter and pass over to the skeletal <b>hyphae</b> in the same size. They protrude distinctly into the fruit tissue, a characteristic that differentiates them from the sympatric L. betulinus.|$|R
50|$|The <b>hyphae</b> are Dimitic, {{composed}} of binding or skeletal <b>hyphae.</b> The skeletal <b>hyphae</b> is inflated and axial.|$|R
25|$|Sporidiobolus salmonicolor is a heterothallic species; two mating {{types are}} known. Induction {{of the sexual}} stage begins with {{anastomosis}} of compatible yeast cells to form dikaryotic hyphae with clamp connections. Hyphae have “simple” septal pores that allow continuity of the cytoplasm between cells. At the terminal end of the <b>hypha,</b> thick-walled, resting spores called teliospores form. These germinate to form a transversely-septate basidia that bears two large basidiospores.|$|E
500|$|S.scutellata has asci of {{approximately}} 300µm by 25µm in size, and releases elliptical spores measuring 18 to 19µm [...] by 10 to 12µm. The translucent (hyaline) ascospores have a rough exterior, (with very small warts) and contain small droplets of oil. They are white when present in large numbers, like a spore print. The paraphyses are cylindrical {{in shape and}} feature septa partitioning the <b>hypha</b> into distinct cells. Electron microscopy {{of the top of}} the ascus has revealed a roughly delimited operculum (a flap-like covering of the ascus) and ascostome (a pore in the apex of the ascus), and a subapical ring.|$|E
500|$|Amylostereaceae usually infest only dead or {{cut down}} conifer wood. Three species – A.areolatum, A.laevigatum and A.chailletii – may also {{establish}} a symbiosis with wood wasps (Siricidae), which beside freshly logged trees also infest living trees and infect them with fungi. Symbioses {{have been recorded}} with several species: Sirex noctilio, S.juvencus, S.nitobei, S.cyaneus, S.edwarsii, S.nitidus, and, in Japan, Urocerus antennatus and Xoanon matsumurae. Wasps of the genera Sirex and Urocerus store oidia (the <b>hypha</b> of fungi split up to spores) in special abdominal organs. The wood wasps infect trees by splashing a phytotoxic secretion below the bark {{and at the same}} time injecting fungal spores into the hole. The secretion weakens the tree and temporarily diminishes its immune system, whereby the fungus can spread along the xylem. The infection with Amylostereaceae fulfill two functions for the wasps: it provides the larvae food, because the white rot softens the wood; at the same time, the mycelia of the fungi serves as food for the larvae. After the larvae pupate, it absorbs the mycelia of the Amylostereaceae into its body to oviposit together with its eggs. The fungus benefits from the symbiosis as it spreads faster and more effectively than through airborne spores and furthermore does not need to develop fruit bodies. [...] A.ferreum is the only Amylosterum species that has not been associated with any woodwasps.|$|E
5000|$|Fungi {{that form}} [...] {{skeletal}} <b>hyphae</b> bound by generative <b>hyphae</b> {{are said to}} have sarcodimitic hyphal systems. A few fungi form fusiform skeletal <b>hyphae,</b> generative <b>hyphae,</b> and binding <b>hyphae,</b> and these {{are said to have}} sarcotrimitic hyphal systems. These terms were introduced as a later refinement by E. J. H. Corner in 1966.|$|R
50|$|Diacanthodes has a dimitic hyphal system, {{meaning it}} {{contains}} both generative <b>hyphae</b> and skeletal <b>hyphae.</b> The generative <b>hyphae</b> have clamp connections; the skeletal <b>hyphae</b> are thick-walled to solid, {{and have a}} weak dextrinoid reaction. The spores are broadly ellipsoid, ornamented, and dextrinoid.|$|R
25|$|There are {{two other}} types of <b>hyphae</b> that {{originate}} from the colonized host plant root. Once colonization has occurred, short-lived runner <b>hyphae</b> grow from the plant root into the soil. These are the <b>hyphae</b> that take up phosphorus and micronutrients, which are conferred to the plant. AM fungal <b>hyphae</b> have a high surface-to-volume ratio, making their absorptive ability {{greater than that of}} plant roots. AMF <b>hyphae</b> are also finer than roots and can enter into pores of the soil that are inaccessible to roots. The third type of AMF <b>hyphae</b> grows from the roots and colonizes other host plant roots. The three types of <b>hyphae</b> are morphologically distinct.|$|R
2500|$|Before infecting a {{nematode}} egg, P.lilacinum flattens {{against the}} egg surface and becomes closely [...] to it. P.lilacinum produces simple appressoria {{anywhere on the}} nematode egg shell either after a few hyphae grow along the egg surface, or after a network of hyphae form on the egg. The presence of appressoria appears {{to indicate that the}} egg is, or is about to be, infected. In either case, the appressorium appears the same, as a simple swelling {{at the end of a}} <b>hypha,</b> closely appressed to the eggshell. Adhesion between the appressorium and nematode egg surface must be strong enough to withstand the opposing force produced by the extending tip of a penetration <b>hypha.</b> When the <b>hypha</b> has penetrated the egg, it rapidly destroys the juvenile within, before growing out of the now empty egg shell to produce conidiophores and to grow towards adjacent eggs.|$|E
2500|$|Infection {{begins when}} conidia from nearby {{infected}} plants or those {{carried by the}} wind enter through the stomata by landing and developing a germ tube or <b>hypha.</b> [...] The conidia germinate optimally {{in the early morning}} and with a high relative humidity. The haustoria extend from the hyphae of the mycelium and systemically invade the rest of the plant, draining nutrients.|$|E
2500|$|Endomycorrhizas are {{variable}} {{and have been}} further classified as arbuscular, ericoid, arbutoid, monotropoid, and orchid mycorrhizas. [...] Arbuscular mycorrhizas, or AM (formerly known as vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizas, or VAM), are mycorrhizas whose hyphae enter into the plant cells, producing structures that are either balloon-like (vesicles) or dichotomously branching invaginations (arbuscules). The fungal hyphae do not in fact penetrate the protoplast (i.e. {{the interior of the}} cell), but invaginate the cell membrane. The structure of the arbuscules greatly increases the contact surface area between the <b>hypha</b> and the cell cytoplasm to facilitate the transfer of nutrients between them.|$|E

Arable fields with loamy sand, heathlands and city parks on sandy soils had the highest percentage of melanized <b>hyphae.</b> In addition to the frequency determinations, a microcosm study was performed on the role of melanized <b>hyphae</b> in two different ecosystems: an ex-arable field and a forest. Melanized <b>hyphae</b> appeared {{to be part of the}} active <b>hyphae</b> in the forest soil but not in the ex-arable soil. In conclusion, our results indicate that (1) melanized <b>hyphae</b> represent a large proportion of the total fungal biomass in soils and that (2) their function might differ between ecosystems. ...|$|R
60|$|After {{swarming}} {{about in}} this way in the moisture {{on the surface of}} a leaf or stem (which, film though it may be, is an ocean to such a fish) for half an hour, more or less, the movement of the zoospore becomes slower, and is limited to a slow turning upon its axis, without change of place. It then becomes quite quiet, the cilia disappear, it assumes a spherical form, and surrounds itself with a distinct, though delicate, membranous coat. A protuberance then grows out {{from one side of the}} sphere, and rapidly increasing in length, assumes the character of a <b>hypha.</b> The latter penetrates into the substance of the potato plant, either by entering a stomate, or by boring through the wall of an epidermic cell, and ramifies, as a mycelium, in the substance of the plant, destroying the tissues with which it comes in contact. As these processes of multiplication take place very rapidly, millions of spores are soon set free from a single infested plant; and, from their minuteness, they are readily transported by the gentlest breeze. Since, again, the zoospores set free from each spore, in virtue of their powers of locomotion, swiftly disperse themselves over the surface, it is no wonder that the infection, once started, soon spreads from field to field, and extends its ravages over a whole country.|$|E
50|$|As a <b>hypha</b> extends, septa may {{be formed}} behind the growing tip to {{partition}} each <b>hypha</b> into individual cells. Hyphae can branch through the bifurcation {{of a growing}} tip, or {{by the emergence of}} a new tip from an established <b>hypha.</b>|$|E
50|$|The sexual {{structures}} are {{formed in the}} fruiting layer of the ascocarp, the hymenium. At one end of ascogenous hyphae, characteristic U-shaped hooks develop, which curve back opposite to the growth direction of the hyphae. The two nuclei contained in the apical part of each <b>hypha</b> divide {{in such a way}} that the threads of their mitotic spindles run parallel, creating two pairs of genetically different nuclei. One daughter nucleus migrates close to the hook, while the other daughter nucleus locates to the basal part of the <b>hypha.</b> The formation of two parallel cross-walls then divides the <b>hypha</b> into three sections: one at the hook with one nucleus, one at the basal of the original <b>hypha</b> that contains one nucleus, and one that separates the U-shaped part, which contains the other two nuclei.|$|E
