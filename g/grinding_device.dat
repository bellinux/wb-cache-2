40|$|Attention, cette {{publication}} comporte un corrigendum. International audienceThe {{effect of}} dry milling processes {{on the surface}} properties of an attapulgite clay, also called palygorskite, was investigated by carrying out experiments with different types of <b>grinding</b> <b>devices.</b> Ground products were then characterized by size measurement, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, adsorption-desorption of N- 2 and inverse gas chromatography at infinite dilution (IGC-ID) as well as finite concentration conditions (IGC-PC). These analyses were performed to evaluate the changes in particle size distribution, morphology, crystallinity and surface properties of attapulgite powder, respectively. Among the tested dry <b>grinding</b> <b>devices,</b> <b>grinding</b> in an air jet mill (Alpine 50 AS) and a vibratory ball mill (Pulverisette 0) led to the most significant particle size reduction. SEM photomicrographs showed that a breakage of the fibrous structure took place during dry grinding. Moreover, long grinding in Pulverisette 0 resulted in the complete destruction of fibre morphology followed by agglomeration. XRD analysis showed that whatever the grinding process, the microstructure of the attapulgite was not affected. IGC confirmed that only grinding in Pulverisette 0 affected the surface properties notably. In this case, the most significant decreases were observed in the dispersive component of the surface energy (164 to 116 mJ/m(2)) and in the specific surface area obtained with the octane probe (114. 5 m(2) /g to 62. 6 m(2) /g) by IGC-ID and IGC-FC, respectively.

(1988) and was optimized for the analyses of halogenated volatile organic compounds (VOCs) having boiling points as low as - 128. °C (carbon tetrafluoride). The sample preconcentration cold trap consists of a U-shaped glass lined steel tube (GLT™), that is immersed into a small liquid nitrogen Dewar vessel for cooling. A rapid desorption step heats up the preconcentration tube in < 30 s from - 196 °C to 200 °C. The process is carried out by using a pressurized air stream to dissipate the liquid nitrogen followed by resistive heating of the trap.

40|$|The {{comminution}} and tuning {{of several}} structural parameters of materials is often accomplished following a top-down route by high energy grinding. The reduced {{size of the}} particles constituting the end product and the incorporation of defects cause modified materials properties and increased solid-state chemical reactivity. Among <b>grinding</b> <b>devices,</b> the planetary ball mill features high efficiency and versatility, being suitable for almost any kind of material, from metals and ceramics to organic compounds and pharmaceuticals. While its design and the working principle are rather simple, since grinding occurs by impacts between milling media (balls and jar) and mill charge, {{the characteristics of the}} end product strongly depend on a multitude of variables, determining balls trajectories and velocities and, in turn, the nature of impulsive forces exchanged during collisions. Numerical models can enourmously contribute to shed light on the process by providing the time evolution of kinematic and dynamic properties of milling media as well as quantities involved in contact events, permitting to understand the role of each milling variable and to design the characteristics of the end product.

40|$|Ball mills, i. e. {{rotating}} cylindrical drums {{filled with}} a feed material and metal balls, {{also known as the}} charge, are a major category of <b>grinding</b> <b>devices</b> in mineral processing and cement production. Since the grinding process is excessively energy-intensive and aggressive in terms of wear, a profiled and wear-resistant liner is installed in the mill to transfer energy to the grinding charge more efficiently and to protect the mill shell. Because of the harsh environment inside of the mill and the relatively long lifespan of its liner, the optimization of the liner by the classical way, i. e. experimental testing, is a difficult and slow process. In this thesis, a procedure for predicting the charge motion and the power draw of a ball mill based on the discrete element method (DEM) is calibrated and validated by means of photographs of the charge, and power draw measurements of a 1 : 5 -scale laboratory mill, which were kindly provided by the company Magotteaux International S. A.. This computational method essentially renders future experimental testing unnecessary with respect to these characteristics. Based on this first method, a generic process for predicting the wear distribution and the progressive shape evolution of liner surfaces is developed and validated by the wear profiles of the shell liner in the first chamber of a 5. 8 m diameter cement mill monitored during a decade by Magotteaux International S. A.. The energy dissipated by tangential damping defined by the linear spring-slider-damper DEM contact law was found to be the best fitting wear model with respect to the real wear data.

Nevertheless, detailed phenomena, like the creation of grooves in the liner, were for the first time numerically modeled in this thesis...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{progress}} in the miniaturization of electronic items introduces manufacturing challenges for achieving both better surface integrity and high throughput. Controlled thermal interaction processes physically vaporize the material for producing the miniature components but the poor surface and sub-surface characteristics introduce a niche for thermo-mechanical processes, particularly microgrinding. Prior microgrinding attempts have focussed on axi-symmetrical components of hard-brittle materials. For non-axi-symmetrical, high-aspect ratio miniature components, edge chipping was encountered. This paper reports a new grinding method that uses "high table reversal speeds" for reducing the "grit cut load" and hence facilitates the microgrinding process. An arrangement that functions {{on the principles of}} four bar linkage with a sliding and rotating pair was devised. This arrangement was designed to reciprocate between 300 - 1000 strokes/min for a stroke length of 10 - 70 turn. As a result the table feed rate range was increased from the conventional 300 - 20000 mm/min to 5000 - 55000 mm/min. Process characterization of the new grinding method was observed for hard-brittle materials. A physical model was developed which links the process parameters with appropriate boundary conditions and the model was verified experimentally. The experimental model was used to explain the mechanism of grinding while employing high table reversal speeds. Process characterization includes grinding force, grinding-ratio, grinding wheel topography, surface finish and SEM study. Also, the process was applied to produce mold-insert which in turn was used for molding the micro-mechanical cantilever sensor parts. Deep slots of size: 1. 2 x 0. 1 x 1. 5 mm with an aspect ratio of 15 was successfully produced with this method. The new <b>grinding</b> <b>device</b> and method promote microgrinding through integration to an existing grinder and therefore reduces the additional cost on the capital resources.

40|$|Recycling of {{elastomers}} {{in practice}} {{is fraught with}} a series of technological and economic hurdles. Here, the varietal separation is an absolute prerequisite for the utilisation of recycled materials in primary products. In the field of end-of-life products (e. g. tyres), where large quantities are accumulating, single-variety processing is not feasible, limiting the utilisation to secondary applications. Demand for such products, such as sports or safety mats however, is showing first signs of saturation, so new utilisation concepts must be found. In-house production residues on the other hand could be collected separately and returned to the initial mixture, but usually do not accumulate to sufficient amounts to be processed with the established recycling facilities economically. Furthermore, {{little is known about the}} interactions arising from the addition of recyclates to a rubber mixture, especially a scientific basis concerning the failure mechanisms of elastomers filled with recycled material is lacking. By the development of a new ambient <b>grinding</b> <b>device</b> ("Reaktruder"), which was specially designed for the recycling of small batches of varietal production residues, an efficient tool for refeeding recyclates into the initial mixture was provided, wherewith recycling rates of 20 % and more have already been realised in practice.

Finally, the status and perspectives of utilising elastomeric recycling materials in valuable secondary applications are delineated, whereby thermoplastic elastomeric compounds as an economic substitute for classic TPE materials are in the foreground...|$|E
40|$|There are {{numerous}} potential advantages of producing significant quantities of a monoclonal antibody (MAb) via transgenic tobacco plants over other heterologous production systems, thus {{paving the way}} for new prophylactic and therapeutic applications within global human and animal health. However, current information on the key processing factors for large scale production of antibodies from transgenic plants is limited. This thesis presents the issues involved in the production of monoclonal antibodies in transgenic tobacco plants with a specific focus on initial extraction and aids the design and characterisation of an optimal small-scale extraction process using ultrascale down and micromanipulation techniques based on large-scale principals, in addition to offering different harvesting and extraction strategies dependent upon the specific target subcellular or tissue compartment. One of the preliminary objectives of this project was to examine methods for the initial extraction of recombinant IgG 1 antibodies from the leaf tissue of transgenic tobacco. Three different transgenic plant lines were investigated with the intention of establishing the parameters for optimal extraction of MAbs that reside in the apoplasm (IgG), endoplasmic reticulum (IgG-HDEL), or are bound to the plasma membrane (mIgG). For each transgenic line, seven techniques for physical extraction were evaluated. For IgG that is secreted and accumulated in the apoplasm, dry freeze-thaw (the freezing of leaf discs at - 20 oC followed by room temperature thawing before buffer addition) was an appropriate technique for extraction of a high yield and a low release of native plant proteins from leaves in comparison to the other techniques investigated. In addition to lowering the downstream purification burden, the large-scale equipment involved in this step is likely to have a lower operating cost than a mechanical, energy-intensive <b>grinding</b> <b>device.</b> IgG-HDEL-expressing transgenic plants demonstrated an increase in IgG-HDEL yield with technique severity, demonstrating that harsher techniques such as dryfreeze- thaw followed by grinding were optimal.

40|$|Wastewater {{contains}} large solids {{and grit}} that {{can interfere with}} treatment processes or cause undue mechanical wear and increased maintenance on wastewater treatment equipment. To minimize potential problems, these materials require separate handling. Preliminary treatment removes these constituents from the influent wastewater. Preliminary treatment consists of screening, grit removal, septage handling, odor control, and flow equalization. This fact sheet discusses screening and grit removal. Screening Screening is the first unit operation used at wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Screening removes objects such as rags, paper, plastics, and metals to prevent damage and clogging of downstream equipment, piping, and appurtenances. Some modern wastewater treatment plants use both coarse screens and fine screens. Figure 1 depicts a typical bar screen (a type of coarse screen). Coarse Screens Coarse screens remove large solids, rags, and debris from wastewater, and typically have openings of 6 mm (0. 25 in) or larger. Types of coarse screens include mechanically and manually cleaned bar screens, including trash racks. Table 1 describes {{the various types of}} coarse screens. Fine Screens Fine screens are typically used to remove material that may create operation and maintenance problems in downstream processes, particularly in systems that lack primary treatment. Typical opening sizes for fine screens are 1. 5 to 6 mm (0. 06 to 0. 25 in). Very fine screens with openings of 0. 2 to 1. 5 mm (0. 01 to 0. 06 in) placed after coarse or fine screens can reduce suspended solids to levels near those achieved by primary clarification. Comminutors and Grinders Processing coarse solids reduces their size so they can be removed during downstream treatment operations, such as primary clarification, where both floating and settleable solids are removed. Comminuting and <b>grinding</b> <b>devices</b> are installed in the wastewater flow channel to grind and shred material up to 6 to 19 mm (0. 25 to 0. 75 in) in size. Comminutors consist of a rotating slotted cylinder through which wastewater flow passes. Solids that are too large to pass through the slots are cut by blades as the cylinder rotates, reducing their size until they pass through the slot openings...|$|R

Common examples of end effectors include welding devices (such as MIG-welding guns, spot-welders, etc.), spray guns and also <b>grinding</b> and deburring <b>devices</b> (such as pneumatic disk or belt grinders, burrs, etc.), and grippers (devices that can grasp an object, usually electromechanical or pneumatic). Another common means of picking up an object is by vacuum. End effectors are frequently highly complex, made to match the handled product and often capable of picking up an array of products at one time.

ABSTRACT: The {{necessity}} of applying materials with {{high degree of}} fineness in the contemporary technologies require used to modern technology in mechanical comminution of different substances, which will assure demanded particle size distribution of grinding product. The scientific performances are mostly aimed at the search for new work conditions of industrial <b>grinding</b> <b>devices,</b> which should guarantee parameters and fineness of grinding products and should decrease energy consuming of grinding and improve environmental protection. All the above seems to be met in the researches of granular materials grinding in the high-energetic fluidized bed. The fluidized jet grinding relies on keeping up a turbulent fluidization in the grinding chamber of mill, which {{is a result of}} collisions of air counter-fluxes. They make it possible to obtain high-energetic fluidized bed, which in turn ensures an effective comminution of tested granular material. The state of pulsatory fluidization is created in the certain surroundings of an axial zone of the fluidized bed. The state of fountain fluidization is created in the axial zone of the fluidized bed, which is characterised by carryover of grains in the zone of high velocities in the centre core of grinding chamber, then by gravitational falling of coarse fraction near walls and by carrying away of the small fraction by the flowing gas into the separation system. The theoretical basis and experimental results for the fluidized jet grinding of granular materials are presented in the paper. The researches were performed on a laboratory fluidized bed opposed jet mill. The experiment contained grinding tests of selected narrow size fraction of limestone in turbulent fluidized layer conditions. The aim of researches was to explain the influence of the values of rotational speed of flow classifier rotor on the efficiency of mill and the particle size distribution of grinding product. The determined masses and particle size distribution of grinding products make it possible to estimate the quality and the efficiency of the carried out fluidized jet grinding tests.
