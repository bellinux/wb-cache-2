40|$|Abstract: In {{the present}} work, the {{computational}} fluid dynamics (CFD) technique was used to predict the fire dynamics in a big three-story building. Important aspects of fire dynamics were investigated such as smoke propagation and temperature distribution. The study aims to decrease the fire hazards by computationally predicting the expected smoke movement in real-life conditions. Consequently, early evacuation plans can be established to save human lives by proper estimation of the smoke direction and density. Also, temperature rise has a potential effect on the safety of both humans and structures. Different factors were considered such as fire location, doors, and <b>emergency</b> <b>openings.</b> Important findings and notable conclusions are recorded...|$|R

During that time, the region was experiencing extremely strong winds and low relative humidity, which fanned the fire and created an extremely rapid moving crown fire. Many neighborhoods were evacuated immediately, giving only very short warning to residents, sometimes as short as 5 minutes. In addition to the strong winds, the fire was also fuelled by unusually dry conditions in the Sierra Nevada (U.S.). A study concluded that snow pack was 29% of average in 2007.After an hour of burning, soot began to fall from the sky around the Tahoe Keys area.

5000|$|Developmentalism {{is often}} accused {{by the left}} (though {{not only by the}} left) of having an {{ideology}} of neocolonialism at its root. Developmentalist strategies use a Eurocentric viewpoint of development, a viewpoint that often {{goes hand in hand with}} the implication that non-European societies are underdeveloped. As such, it gives way for the perpetuation of Western dominance over such underdeveloped nations, in a neocolonialist fashion. Developed nations such as the United States have been accused of seizing opportunities of disaster for their own benefit in what is known as [...] "disaster capitalism.” Disaster capitalism, a term used by Naomi Klein, describes the process in which situations of financial crisis are used in order to force an <b>emergency</b> <b>opening</b> of the free market in order to regain economic stability. This happened in the examples of Argentina, Chile, Bolivia, and post-Katrina New Orleans, among others. Developmentalist ideas also portray the Western ideal of development and democracy as an evolutionary course of history. In Eric Wolf’s book, Europe and the People without History, Wolf shows, through a long history of examples, that the Western world is only one of many visions of the world, and to view it as the pinnacle of a linear world evolutionary chain would be inaccurate. [...] Developmentalist strategies often implicate that history is on a unilateral path of evolution towards development, and that cultural derivations have little implication in the final product.|$|E

30|$|Flooding {{is common}} in the region which depends on climate, {{seasonality}} and other local factors. Five major flood events were reported since 1979, and the flood event of 2006 was devastating. Major flood events are reportedly caused due to monsoon-induced rainfall events (the peak flood is observed during August) (Agnihotri and Patel 2008) {{as well as by}} the <b>emergency</b> <b>opening</b> of the Ukai dam. The various factors which contribute to the flooding of Tapi River are the increase in population and allied factors such as built-up area increase, silting up of riverbed and embankment construction. Though the Ukai dam in the region was constructed with an additional aim to prevent floods, major floods during years 1998, 2004 and 2006 occurred due to the <b>emergency</b> <b>opening</b> of the dam when its capacity is overthrown (Joshi et al. 2012). The Khadi floods also pose a flooding threat (e.g. 2004, 2005 and 2007) in addition to the flooding of the Tapi River. Surat was selected as one of the pilot cities in the Asian cities climate resilience network in 2008. The major flood events also increase the risk of vector-borne disease in the region (Bhat et al. 2013). Jariwala and Samtani (2012) detailed the natural and anthropogenic cause of the flood in the southern part of Surat city, where the storm water is discharged through Mindhola River and its tributaries. Some of the anthropogenic factors listed are land reclamation on the bank of creeks, construction of bridges and suspended solids/non-degradable substances in city effluents. Natural reasons include precipitation pattern, catchment topography, bed gradients and the cross-sectional area available for flow. The peak flood is estimated from hydrological and catchment data using rational formula, and accordingly tributary cross sections were designed to contain the estimated peak flood. Jariwala and Samtani (2012) proposed the modification in the channel section of the most vulnerable stretches (Mithi and Kankara), so that it can contain peak flood waters. Joshi et al. (2012) had done urban flood mapping using geospatial techniques at Surat city. They used the Geo-Coded Indian Remote Sensing (IRS- 1 D) satellite image of April 2005 and Topo-Sheets at 1 : 50, 000 scales collected from office of Survey of India and generated flood inundation map for the West Zone area of Surat City for different flood water levels. It was found that the inundation will start at water level above 4.0  m in the low-lying area in the West Zone area of Surat. The study also showed that the 95.38 % area will be inundated when water level will rise at 12.0 -m level.|$|E
40|$|Application of {{advanced}} controllers in horticultural practice requires detailed models. Even highly sophisticated models require regular {{attention from the}} user due to changing circumstances like plant growth, changing material properties and modifications in greenhouse design and layout. Moreover, their calibration is data demanding and laborious. This study explores the suitability of the extended Kalman filter (EKF) for automatic, on-line estimation and adaptation of parameters in a physics-based greenhouse model. The method was tested with measured data recorded {{over a period of}} 1 year, and with a model that describes the air temperature and moisture content in the Watergy greenhouse. In order to keep the parameters estimation problem tractable, and to improve the local accuracy of the parameters, separate EKFs are applied to sub-systems, using observation data at the sub-system boundaries. The filter adequately adjusts parameter values, thus significantly improving the model fit as compared to simulations with no-varying parameters. It appears that the filter is robust with respect to sudden changes in the system; when a disturbance occurs, such as pruning of plants or <b>emergency</b> <b>opening</b> of the windows, the EKF changes the parameter values accordingly. The result suggests that the extended Kalman filter is, indeed, a suitable method to provide the required automatic adaptation to time-varying phenomena when modeling is impractica...|$|E

As {{a result of}} the New Years Eve/Day storm of 2005 / 2006, the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) had to close to all traffic the Russian River Bridge, a two-lane conventional highway east of Geyserville due to significant structural damage. This Bridge, constructed in 1932, is a 973. 5 -foot-long steel pony truss bridge located on State Highway 128 and connects the Counties of Sonoma and Napa. Pier 2 of the Bridge was damaged during Russian River storm flows approaching 60, 000 cubic feet per second (CFS). This damage consisted of the through and through cracking of the pier cap and web wall of Pier 2, the rotation of the pier in the downstream direction, and the dropping of the pony trusses approximately 9 inches.

In order to demolish the existing bridge a construction trestle, capable of supporting a 250 -ton crane, had to be con¬structed across the Russian River. This crane would be utilized to construct the trestle from land, demolish the damaged pony truss bridge, and construct the new bridge. The 50 ’-wide trestle was supported on 24 ” steel pipe piles averaging 80 ’ in length. The construction trestle, being constructed from both the east and west sides of the river, totaled 465 feet in length, and was completed in 70 days. Piles were primarily driven with a vibratory hammer or within an isolation casing, to reduce the impact on salmonids [Central California Coastal Steelhead (CCCS) (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and California Coastal Chinook salmon (CCCO) (O. tshawytscha) ] which are known to inhabit this reach of the Russian River. During the time that the trestle was being constructed, Caltrans bridge engineers, designers, and environmental personnel completed the Plans Specifications & Estimate (PS&E) for the new bridge in approximately 4 weeks. Once construction of the trestle was completed, demolition of the existing bridge began. Demolition commenced with the removal of the concrete deck, lifting of the pony trusses, and the toppling of the old piers. These piers were founded on 12 ” diameter 25 ’ long Douglas fir piles and there were 18 piles per pier. Once the piers were toppled, the Douglas fir piles were either extracted from the river bed or cut off approximately 3 ’ below the grade of the gravel bar. To the greatest extent possible, all demolition debris was prevented from falling into the river or onto the dry river bed. Hydroacoustic monitoring was conducted during pile driving activities within the wetted channel or within 30 ’ of the wetted channel. Recordings of the 24 ” trestle piles driven with the vibratory hammer could not be distinguished from the ambient river noise which ranged up to 170 dB (re 1 μPa) RMS. Diesel hammer driving of the 24 ” piles resulted in readings ranging up to 190 dB peak. Driving of the 48 ” steel shell production pipe piles to depths of up to 140 ’ resulted, in some cases, of readings up to 210 dB peak, even though the piles were being driven in a dewatered isolation casing. Construction of the new bridge, on the same alignment of the damaged and demolished bridge, began on May 1, 2006. The bridge was opened to all traffic on August 18 th, 2006, a total of 110 days. Extensive coordination with the resource agencies (Army Corps of Engineers, Regional Water Quality Control Board, California Department of Fish and Game, and the National Marine Fisheries Service) was continuous throughout the entire construction period. A full time biological monitor was on site beginning in the middle of May. Caltrans personnel relocated to the main river channel trapped fish from the pools that remained after the demolition of the piers. Deconstruction of the trestle, including the extraction of the 24 ” piles, was completed in 15 days. Total construction costs were $ 26 million broken down as follows: $ 10. 5 M for the trestle, old bridge demolition, and pipe piles; $ 14 M for the new bridge; and $ 1. 5 M for contract change orders and landscaping. Caltrans, as compensation for impacts to Russian River fisheries due to this project, established a $ 2, 500, 000 fund to enhance and restore appropriate salmonid fisheries habitat within the Russian River watershed...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2013 Two {{commercial}} salmon {{management strategies}} currently {{being used in}} Alaska are management by <b>emergency</b> order <b>opening</b> ("active management") and, to the extent practical, a fixed fishing schedule. Active management is more expensive than a fixed fishing schedule. The objective of this thesis is to compare {{the performance of the}} two management strategies on the Egegik and Togiak fisheries in Bristol Bay, Alaska. To accomplish this, we reconstructed the sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) runs to Egegik and Togiak and then simulated the management strategies on each fishery. Active management resulted in higher yearly catches, a higher percentage of the run caught, less yearly variation in escapement, and less years of escapement below the goal range. A fixed fishing schedule resulted in less yearly variation in catch and a more even harvest rate. Potential benefits of active management are that maximum sustained yield {{is more likely to be}} achieved, under escapement is less likely, and the productive capacity of the fishery is better protected. Potential benefits of a fixed fishing schedule are lower management costs, better maintenance of the genetic and phenotypic diversity and sex ratio, and more predictability for fishermen and processors...|$|R
