6000|$|Representations of {{injuries}} resulting to several persons {{claiming to be}} citizens of the United States by reason of such violations {{were made to the}} Spanish Government. From April, 1869, to June last the Spanish minister at Washington had been clothed with a limited power to aid in redressing such wrongs. That power was found to be withdrawn, [...] "in view," [...] as it was said, [...] "of the favorable situation in which the island of Cuba" [...] then [...] "was," [...] which, however, did not lead to a revocation or suspension of the extraordinary and arbitrary functions exercised by the executive power in Cuba, and we were obliged to make our complaints at Madrid. In the negotiations thus opened, and still pending there, the United States only claimed that for the future the rights secured to their citizens by treaty should be respected in Cuba, and that as to the past a <b>joint</b> <b>tribunal</b> should be established in the United States with full jurisdiction over all such claims. Before such an impartial tribunal each claimant would be required to prove his case. On the other hand, Spain would be at liberty to traverse every material fact, and thus complete equity would be done. A case which at one time threatened seriously to affect the relations between the United States and Spain has already been disposed of in this way. The claim of the owners of the Colonel Lloyd Aspinwall for the illegal seizure and detention of that vessel was referred to arbitration by mutual consent, and has resulted in an award to the United States, for the owners, of the sum of $19,702.50 in gold. Another and long-pending claim of like nature, that of the whaleship Canada, has been disposed of by friendly arbitrament during the present year. It was referred, by the joint consent of Brazil and the United States, to the decision of Sir Edward Thornton, Her Britannic Majesty's minister at Washington, who kindly undertook the laborious task of examining the voluminous mass of correspondence and testimony submitted by the two Governments, and awarded to the United States the sum of $100,740.09 in gold, which has since been paid by the Imperial Government. These recent examples show that the mode which the United States have proposed to Spain for adjusting the pending claims is just and feasible, and that it may be agreed to by either nation without dishonor. It is to be hoped that this moderate demand may be acceded to by Spain without further delay. Should the pending negotiations, unfortunately and unexpectedly, be without result, it will then become my duty to communicate that fact to Congress and invite its action on the subject.|$|E

It explores the several potential obstacles 				to the success of such a tribunal. 				First, it argues that the Cambodian government still exercises control 				over the Cambodian judiciary {{and the presence of}} a majority of Cambodian judges 				likely will cause the tribunal to lack credibility in the eyes of Cambodians 				and the international community. Second, 				through tracing the history of negotiations between and the United Nations 				regarding the establishment of the <b>joint</b> <b>tribunal,</b> this note argues that the 				Cambodian government greatly prolonged the process of reaching an agreement and 				has demonstrated a lack of good faith. 				Finally, this note argues that the structure of the tribunal is 				flawed. Specifically the features of the 				tribunal, which present risks to its success, include: (1) a lack of judicial 				independence due to interference by political manipulation of the Cambodian 				government, (2) no independent, international prosecutor, (3) the limited 				number of competent Cambodian judges and (4) a flawed supermajority 				formula. Lastly, this note contains a 				case study of the Special Court established in Sierra Leone and asserts that a 				Cambodian tribunal modeled after the Special Court may achieve several of the 				goals of the <b>joint</b> <b>tribunal</b> with substantially fewer risks...|$|E

50|$|The <b>Joint</b> Contracts <b>Tribunal</b> was {{established}} in the 1930s by the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) and the National Federation of Building Trades Employers (NFBTE), to consider future proposals for amending the Form of Contract which had been published in 1931. Its first chairman, to 1956, was Sydney Tatchell, followed by Sir Percy Thomas. The RIBA Guide to its Archive and History (1986) recorded that the tribunal had been established jointly in October 1932 by the councils of the RIBA and NFBTE to consider suggestions for the amendment of the 1931 Form of Contract, and that each of those two bodies appointed one of the two Joint Secretaries. The Secretary RIBA had acted as the RIBA Joint Secretary until the early 1960s (Macalister to 1942, Spragg to 1959), when this appointment was performed by the Practice Secretary and then by the Legal Adviser. The archived documents are listed in the Guide as the RIBA Joint Secretary's Papers, 1932-1944, 1952-1971, including copies of minutes and reports and papers concerning revision of the Form of Contract 1955-1961.|$|R
40|$|Design clashes’ {{encountered}} {{during the}} development of a large multi-storey educational building, awarded under a <b>Joint</b> Contracts <b>Tribunal</b> (JCT) Design and Build contract, are reported upon. The building was developed in Birmingham, UK and the contract value was circa £ 36 million (UK Sterling, 2015). Members of the project management team (PMT) produced designs that were subsequently integrated by the main contractor into a federated building information modelling (BIM) model; at this stage 404 error clashes were evident between the positions of the mechanical, electrical and plumbing (MEP) designer's and structural designer's building compartments. The contractor deemed that these particular clashes were ‘mission critical’ as previous experience suggested that project costs could spiral uncontrollably if left unabated. Participatory action research was employed to acquire a deeper understanding and knowledge of the clash incidents. Clash data accrued (in mm) was subsequently quantitatively modelled using the probability density function (PDF) and the cumulative distribution function (CDF). Two models produced were the Log Logistic Three Parameter (3 P) (using all data including outliers) and Generalized Gamma distribution (excluding outliers). Both models satisfied Anderson- Darling and Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness of fit tests at α 0. 01 and 0. 02 levels of significance. Model parameters could be used to forecast similar clashes occurring on future projects and will prove invaluable to PMT members when accurately estimating the time and resource needed to integrate BIM designs.

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper [© RICS]. It is also freely {{available}} at: [URL] Michael Latham and Sir John Egan in their reports “Constructing the Team”, “Rethinking Construction” and “Accelerating Change” identified substantial {{changes in the}} culture and structure of UK construction being required. These also included changes in the relationships between companies. The choice and form of contract can {{play a significant role}} in the governance of such relationships. Sir Michael Latham suggested that contract writing bodies could amend existing standard forms to meet some of the concerns further urging the industry to embrace a Modern Contract. The forms of contract, and the changes to them over time, can influence culture change. This paper compares and contrasts the principal provisions of the contracts published by the <b>Joint</b> Contracts <b>Tribunal</b> (“JCT”), Institution of Civil Engineers (“ICE”) and the New Engineering Contract (“NEC”) against Sir Michael Latham’s 13 requirements for a Modern Contract. Where relevant, subcontract and consultant forms are also considered within the contractual matrix. The JCT and ICE forms of contract were found to have retained the principle features more conducive to promoting an adversarial relationship as opposed to the modern requirements for a collaborative and trusting relationship. Some attempts have been made by the JCT and ICE to promote collaborative working and to incorporate the features of a Modern Contract but this relies heavily on overarching documents which, in the main, are non binding on the parties and simply exhort collaborative behaviour. The single, most notable, exception to this was the JCT Constructing Excellence Contract. On the other hand. the NEC family of contracts were found to have embraced virtually all the requirements for a Modern Contract in an integrated way and, could be argued, were the most conducive to assisting with implementation of the various drivers for change...|$|R
40|$|Japanese Design-Build (DB) {{is unique}} and {{different}} from the DB implemented {{in other parts of}} the world, especially in advanced western countries like the US and UK. The purpose of this research study is to analyse the uniqueness of Japanese DB, based on allocation of responsibility and risk in the standard construction contracts. A comparative analysis was carried out to ascertain the similarities and differences between Japanese DB contract and Japanese traditional as well as western contracts as represented by the standard contract forms of the American Institute of Architects and the <b>Joint</b> Contracts <b>Tribunal.</b> Contract clauses are extracted and broken down into eight elementary components in order to clarify the responsibility statement. For each responsibility, the appropriate project phases (whether pre-design, design, construction or completion of each responsibility), risk contained in the responsibility and degree of each party’s involvement were indicated. To make the three contract series with different configuration structures comparable, ten headings of contractual issues were established. The comparative analysis revealed that the differences between Japanese and western contracts basically revolve around the clarity of the responsibility description, the process and approach of decision making, and the degree of involvement by the Owner. The finding supports the hypothesis that the Japanese DB contract does not properly represent the actual Japanese DB; instead, it suggests that the Japanese DB is closer to the Japanese Traditional method. The hypothesis that the Japanese DB is nothing like the DB in other global DB standard contracts, as represented by the AIA-DB and JCT-DB, was also verified. It has been validated that the Japanese DB is close to the Construction Manager as Constructor of the AIA. The Management Contract of the JCT is found incomparable to the Japanese DB due to different risk placements despite being designed for the single responsibility of contracting construction contracts. Based on a comparative analysis, contractual issues and allocation of responsibility and risk (which are essential for a standard contract for inclusion in a future Japanese DB contract) are highlighted...|$|R
40|$|The {{forms of}} {{contract}} {{published by the}} <b>Joint</b> Contracts <b>Tribunal</b> Ltd (the JCT) are {{the most widely used}} standard forms of building contract in the UK. They have a long history, with the earliest form published in 1909 (known as “the RIBA form”). This subsequently evolved, through a series of editions published in 1931, 1939, 1963 and 1980, into the 1998 edition of the JCT Standard Form of Building Contract. In parallel with this, the JCT developed other standard forms to cover a wide variety of procurement options. Their widespread use stems from this long tradition, and their claimed advantage of being both standard and agreed by consensus between representatives of all the interested parties Over the last few months the JCT has republished many of its standard forms of contract, and expanded the range with new contracts, subcontracts and guidance documents. The JCT describes this exercise as “a complete update and redesign” of the suite. Publication took place over the period of May to December 2005, and at the time of writing (October 2005) many of the main forms have been published although some, for example the Construction Management Contract, the Management Contract and the Prime Cost Contract are not yet available and many of the subcontracts, warranties and guides are likewise still to appear. The forms for traditional procurement, including the Standard Building Contract 2005 (formerly the Standard Form of Building Contract 1998), the Intermediate Building Contract and the Minor Works Building Contract, are, however, all published, together with related guidance. This article begins with an overview of the general changes to the suite, and then focuses on the more detailed changes to the Standard Building Contract (SBC 05). Other forms will be reviewed in a future article. Changes to the suite The new contracts include two Framework Agreements, one binding and the other non-binding.

40|$|In November 2006 the New Zealand Law Commission and the Ministry of Justice {{launched}} a <b>joint</b> programme of <b>tribunal</b> reform in New Zealand. The {{aim of the}} project was to “recommend a structure for existing tribunals as well as a framework for the establishment of tribunals in the future”. As I write this, the whisper from the Beehive suggests that the change in government means that the tribunal reform project is to be put on ice. This is a disappointing development but it should not surprise us. Although the tribunal system in New Zealand has been ripe for reform almost since the first tribunal was established, successive attempts to introduce coherence to the “system” have foundered in the difficult waters of the legislative process. From their humble (and relatively late) beginnings in 1908, New Zealand's system of tribunals now occupies a significant (perhaps even pre-eminent) position in New Zealand's system of justice, particularly in the field of Administrative Law. Despite this, tribunals remain a largely forgotten element of the wider legal system. Few student texts give much mentioned of them and they remain very much an academic and political backwater. It should be no surprise then that, given their astonishingly low profile in New Zealand, tribunals remain largely un-loved, unnoticed and un-reformed institutions. This paper from which it comes aims to at least partially fill the lacuna in New Zealand's legal literature by examining the current system {{in the light of the}} Law Commission's proposals...|$|R
