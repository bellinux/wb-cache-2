50|$|Common {{metallic}} contaminants such as {{copper and}} lead {{can be treated}} by increasing the pH using soda ash or lime, which precipitates such metals. Careful <b>decanting</b> <b>of</b> the clear water after settlement {{or the use of}} filtration provides acceptably low levels of metals. Water contaminated by aluminium or zinc cannot be treated in this way using a strong alkali as higher pHs re-dissolve the metal salts.

Inflowing fresher river water with high alkalinity and nutrient concentrations settled over more saline and acidic pit lake water.

40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that in non-hermetically sealed medium voltage oil insulated switchgear (MV OIS), the insulating oil will absorb water from the ambient air. The humidity <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> highly influences the breakdown voltage <b>of</b> <b>oil.</b> The humidity <b>of</b> <b>oil,</b> in turn, is influenced by the acidity <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> which will change during the aging processes <b>of</b> <b>oil.</b> Moreover, experience on the influence of copper due to switching actions of switchgear on the chemical and electrical aging process <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> is rare. Chemical and electrical aging <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> can influence the humidity and breakdown voltage (BDV) <b>of</b> <b>oil.</b> To address this situation, it is necessary to determine the influence of changing properties <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> on the BDV <b>of</b> said <b>oil</b> in switchgear. The goal of the research is to reduce the risk <b>of</b> breakdown <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> in OIS. Therefore, this thesis focuses on the BDV <b>of</b> insulating <b>oil</b> and quantifies the influence of related factors on the BDV <b>of</b> <b>oil.</b> Stedin can apply this knowledge {{in order to reduce the}} risk of failures related to the breakdown <b>of</b> insulating <b>oil.</b> High-Voltage Technology and ManagementElectrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Scienc...|$|R
