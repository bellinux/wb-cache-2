A life cycle study of one beer brand, including grain production, brewing, bottling, distribution and waste management, {{shows that the}} CO2 emissions from a 6-pack of micro-brew beer is about 3 kilograms (6.6 pounds). The loss of natural habitat potential from the 6-pack of micro-brew beer {{is estimated to be}} 2.5 square metres (26 square feet).

A Life Cycle Assessment study was conducted and combined with a bioeconomic model of genetic response. Results show that environmental consequences of genetic improvement in TGC and FCR are different among impact categories, depending on their main contributors and on the factor limiting production at farm level. Genetic improvement of FCR always leads to lower <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> while improving TGC decreases <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> only when density was the limiting factor.

40|$|Part 2 : Assessment ApproachesInternational audienceLife cycle {{assessment}} (LCA) {{can help}} enterprises evaluate their product’s <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> {{through the entire}} product life cycle (PLC).

This paper proposes a novel approach to re-evaluate the <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> of product based on LCA and Pareto rule which can reduce the time of assessment.

40|$|Historically, the {{manufacturing}} industry {{is one of}} the main contributors to the environmental issues. With conservation of the environment becoming more and more critical for survival, it is of importance for {{the manufacturing}} industry to take responsibility for minimizing their productions’ <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts.</b> Life cycle assessment has been widely used in the product’s development phase within the manufacturing industry. However, the <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> that come from various dynamic manufacturing processes are only estimated with large uncertainty. Some studies have suggested that the combination of life cycle assessment and production flow simulation is an appropriate approach to address the <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> from the manufacturing processes. Nevertheless, these studies are often limiting their concerns to the limited life cycle phases or certain <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts.</b> This study proposes a framework regarding how to develop a method for evaluating and identifying improvements that help reduce the life-cycle <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> of complex production processes. In addition, this work employs a simplified case study to demonstrate the proposed framework. ...|$|R

Besides to evaluate eco-efficiency we should not be concentrated alone on building’s life, but goes stretched to all the proceeded upstream and downstream. To show these, it is stretched out a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) articulated in two moments: {{evaluation of}} <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> from the production of insulating materials and evaluation of <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> from energy consumption of a building, in Mediterranean context. Different stratifications of envelope (from high insulation to low insulation) were compared with the energy consumptions in service life (for heating), emphasizing from a side environmental advantages obtained from energy saving (for better performance in thermal insulation of high insulated envelope) and from the other side <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> of the production’s phase. Results emphasize the role of thermal insulation for energy saving and the reduction of <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> (building’s use phase produces more <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> than material production phase). However, the use of high thicknesses of insulating material (like Passivhaus standard) in Mediterranean climate doesn’t reduce in significant way consumptions in use phase and therefore increases the impacts in production phase...|$|R
