25|$|A {{electrode}} typically {{consists of}} carbon support, Pt particles, Nafion ionomer, and/or Teflon binder. The carbon support functions as an electrical conductor; the Pt particles are reaction sites; the ionomer provides paths for proton conduction, and the Teflon binder increases the hydrophobicity of the electrode to minimize potential flooding. In order {{to enable the}} electrochemical reactions at the electrodes, protons, electrons and the reactant gases (hydrogen or oxygen) must {{gain access to the}} surface of the catalyst in the electrodes, while the product water, which can be in either liquid or gaseous phase, or both phases, must be able to permeate from the catalyst to the gas outlet. These properties are typically realized by porous composites of polymer electrolyte binder (ionomer) and catalyst nanoparticles supported on carbon particles. Typically platinum is used as the catalyst for the electrochemical reactions at the anode and cathode, while nanoparticles realize high surface to weight ratios (as further described below) reducing the amount of the costly platinum. The polymer electrolyte binder provides the ionic conductivity, while the carbon support of the catalyst improves the <b>electric</b> <b>conductivity</b> and enables low platinum metal loading. The <b>electric</b> <b>conductivity</b> in the composite electrodes is typically more than 40 times higher as the proton conductivity.|$|E
25|$|Such {{magnetic}} fields may be advected inward from {{the interstellar medium}} or generated by a magnetic dynamo within the disk. Magnetic fields strengths at least of order 100 Gauss seem necessary for the magneto-centrifugal mechanism to launch powerful jets. There are problems, however, in carrying external magnetic flux inward towards the central star of the disk. High <b>electric</b> <b>conductivity</b> dictates that the magnetic field is frozen into the matter which is being accreted onto the central object with a slow velocity. However, the plasma is not a perfect electric conductor, so there is always some degree of dissipation. The magnetic field diffuses away faster than {{the rate at which}} it is being carried inward by accretion of matter.|$|E
