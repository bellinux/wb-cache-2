Among the haematological parameters there were significant differences between the three species in heterophils, azurophils and lymphocytes, but no significant differences in red blood cell count, white blood cell count, haemoglobin, packed-cell volume, monocytes, eosinophils and basophils. in terms of blood chemistry there were significant differences between the three species in cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, sodium, chloride, urea, uric acid, total proteins, prealbumin, albumin and gamma globulins, but no significant differences in calcium, potassium, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, creatine kinase, bile acids, alpha-i and alpha- 2 globulins and beta globulins.

5000|$|The Yuchi {{have another}} tale about <b>giant</b> <b>lizards.</b> They {{believe that a}} titanic battle between a <b>giant</b> <b>lizard</b> from the land and a <b>giant</b> <b>lizard</b> from the water that was so calamitous that it [...] "shook the earth". These stories about {{gigantic}} ancient reptiles now attributed to dinosaurs may be evidence that Yuchi medicine men once encountered the Cretaceous fossils preserved west of the Mississippi River while on vision quests. Following the release of Jurassic Park to theatres the Yuchi people have replaced the phrase <b>giant</b> <b>lizard</b> with dinosaur.

50|$|El Hierro {{is home to}} many unique species, such as the {{critically}} endangered El <b>Hierro</b> <b>giant</b> <b>lizard</b> (Gallotia simonyi), {{for which there is}} a captive breeding programme, allowing its reintroduction.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Hierro</b> <b>giant</b> <b>lizard</b> is {{protected}} by national and international legislation. It is listed on Annex IV of the European Union's Habitats Directive (EC 2003) and on Appendix I of CITES.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Hierro</b> <b>giant</b> <b>lizard</b> is omnivorous. It eats plants - notably verode and Lavandula abrotanoides - {{as well as}} insects (ARKive 2006). Mating {{begins in}} May and 5 to 13 eggs are laid from June {{until the end of}} August. Their eggs hatch after 61 days.|$|E

50|$|Prehistoric Gallotia remains {{have been}} {{assigned}} to the taxa G. maxima and G. goliath, the former supposedly occurring only on Tenerife, the latter on several islands. It was eventually determined, however, that G. maxima is a junior synonym of G. goliath, and that the latter {{was close to the}} El <b>Hierro</b> <b>giant</b> <b>lizard</b> (Gallotia simonyi); supposed goliath specimens from El Hierro, La Gomera, and La Palma (from the Cuevas de los Murci√©lagos) are probably just extremely large individuals of, respectively, the El Hierro, La Gomera (Gallotia bravoana) and La Palma (Gallotia auaritae) giant lizards. Based on DNA sequence analysis of mummified remains, G. goliath is a valid species that probably was restricted to Tenerife, and apparently was closer to the Tenerife speckled lizard (Gallotia intermedia) than to the El <b>Hierro</b> <b>giant</b> <b>lizard.</b>|$|E
50|$|Malpaso slopes host {{woods and}} heaths with {{relevant}} samples of Canary Islands juniper (Juniperus cedrus), {{some of them}} said {{to be more than}} one thousand years old. The most important animal from a conservationist point of view is El <b>Hierro</b> <b>giant</b> <b>lizard</b> (in Spanish lagarto Salmor), an endangered species of reptiles.|$|E
50|$|About 60 cm long, the <b>Hierro</b> <b>giant</b> <b>lizard</b> is a thickset reptile {{with a broad}} head. Adults {{are dark}} grey to brown in colour, with two rows of pale orange patches running along its sides. Its belly is mostly brown, but has an orange to red {{colouration}} towards the middle. Older El Hierro giant lizards are mainly black with some grey. Males are larger than females. It is the animal symbol of the island of El Hierro.|$|E

50|$|Terrestrial fauna {{includes}} geckos, wall lizards, {{and three}} endemic species of recently rediscovered and critically endangered giant lizard: the El <b>Hierro</b> <b>giant</b> <b>lizard</b> (or Roque Chico de Salmor giant lizard), La Gomera giant lizard, and La Palma giant lizard. Mammals include the Canarian shrew, Canary big-eared bat, the Algerian hedgehog (which {{may have been}} introduced) and the more recently introduced mouflon. Some endemic mammals, the lava mouse, Tenerife giant rat and Gran Canaria giant rat, are extinct, as are the Canary Islands quail, long-legged bunting, and the eastern Canary Islands chiffchaff.|$|E
50|$|Its decline {{may have}} started 2000 {{years ago with the}} arrival of humans on La Palma. Until its recent sightings, it was {{believed}} to have become extinct in the last 500 years. The main causes of this presumed extinction were believed to have been introduced cats, consumption by the original human population of the Canary Islands, and habitat destruction for agriculture. It is not the only lizard from the Canary Islands to have been considered extinct only to be rediscovered later: This happened with other giant lizards of the Canary Islands, like the El <b>Hierro</b> <b>giant</b> <b>lizard</b> and La Gomera giant lizard (rediscovered 1974 and 1999, respectively); the somewhat smaller Tenerife speckled lizard was only discovered {{for the first time in}} 1996.|$|E
50|$|Working {{on fossil}} and subfossil evidence, this giant lizard was {{originally}} {{described as a}} subspecies of the El <b>Hierro</b> <b>giant</b> <b>lizard</b> (Mateo et al. 2001). Later, it was elevated to full species rank (Afonso & Mateo 2003). Specimen remains from La Palma assigned to G. goliath seem to belong to this taxon instead; if this is correct, they indicate that the average size of this species had been decreasing over the last millennia, possibly due to humans preferring to hunt larger lizards (Barahona et al. 2000). The recently sighted La Palma giant lizard individual was slightly more than 30 cm (~1 ft) long and had an estimated age of four years. New expeditions {{to the area of}} the rediscovery are planned in the hope of finding more individuals and possibly a breeding population.|$|E

50|$|Previously, Gallotia simonyi {{included}} the La Palma <b>giant</b> <b>lizard</b> and the La Gomera <b>giant</b> <b>lizard</b> as subspecies too (Miras 2005, Miras & P√©rez-Mellado 2005a); {{the latter is}} known to be very closely related to the extant population (Maca-Meyer et al. 2003) and its specific distinctness is not universally accepted (e.g. Bischoff 2000). Subfossil remains from El Hierro that were assigned to the prehistorically extinct Gallotia goliath apparently belong to the present species (Barahona et al. 2000), but the population referred to G. goliath from Tenerife was distinct (Maca-Meyer et al. 2003).|$|R
