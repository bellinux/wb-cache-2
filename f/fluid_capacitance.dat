40|$|Determining the {{electrical}} impedance of fluids {{is of interest}} in many applications such as the measurement of ionic concentration, the detection of dispersed particles or the humidity sensing. This paper shows a new test system for standard interdigitated electrodes microsensors using a single CMOS circuit that extracts the fluid impedance parameters. The system principle is to load the structure with constant current steps. The response is a voltage wave which contains the fluid resistance and the <b>fluid</b> <b>capacitance</b> in its shape.

40|$|Fundamental {{understanding}} of atomic-level processes underlying charge separation and transport {{is critical to}} the development of next-generation electric energy storage devices to enable wide-scale adoption of electric-vehicle technology and intermittent renewable energy sources (such as wind and solar). Joint Density-Functional Theory (JDFT) allows for the ab initio description of electronic systems in thermodynamic equilibrium with liquid environments and, as such, is ideally positioned to study electrode-electrolyte systems, which are among the most promising technological avenues but which are also currently poorly understood at the fundamental level due to their complexity. This thesis, after describing JDFT and its application to electrochemical environments, focuses on two physical systems of great current research interest in the growing area of supercapacitor storage systems. First, we examine possible sources of an observed but hitherto unexplained enhanced capacitance effect at the Dirac point of graphene in electrolyte environments. We propose and explore two possible explanations for this effect: (1) overscreening by ions within the fluid producing a negative effective <b>fluid</b> <b>capacitance</b> and (2) a stray parallel capacitance effect produced by the adsorption of hydroxide ions. Second, we explore the conduction properties of phthalocyanine-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), which represent potential high-performance materials for use as supercapacitors due to their nanoscale structure and high specific surface areas. The challenge here is to increase the electronic conduction of these materials so that the high specific surface area can be accessed as a source of capacitance by an external circuit, and we present detailed calculations of the full electronic conductivity tensor for these materials. The thesis concludes with suggestions for future experimental and theoretical work to advance the {{understanding of}} nanoscale influences on charge-storage systems. 2021 - 05 - 3...|$|E

One is time term which can indicate solar collector's inner heat transfer ability {{and the other is}} a second order term of collector mean fluid temperature which can obtain <b>fluid</b> thermal <b>capacitance</b> in data processing. Then theoretical analysis and experimental verification are carried out to investigate influencing factors of obtaining accurate and stable second order term. A flat plate and ETC solar collector are compared using both the new dynamic method and a standard method. The results show that the improved function method can accurately and robustly estimate these two kinds of solar collectors...|$|R
40|$|The article {{concerns}} {{the development of}} flexible robotic fingers using electro-rheological fluid (ERF) for pressure control. It describes a technique to predict the transient response of a pressure control device using ERF by an electric-flow analogy. The inertia is calculated from the theoretical equation. The resistance and additional voltage source by the ER effect are derived theoretically by assuming the flow in the electrode annuli of the pressure control device as a flow of the Bingham <b>fluid.</b> The <b>capacitance</b> is determined to compare the time-responses of pressures by the prediction based on a model {{with the results of}} a simple experiment.

Film thickness and traction were measured simultaneously in point contacts by interferometry, from which a new theory of traction was proposed.

40|$|The {{irreversible}} cycle {{model of}} a regenerative modified complex Brayton cycle has been established for the finite heat capacities of external reservoirs. The power output and efficiency have been optimized {{with respect to the}} cycle temperatures and the optimum performance parameters are calculated for a typical set of operating condition.

40|$|Abstract: An {{ecological}} optimization {{along with}} a detailed parametric study of an irreversible regenerative Brayton heat engine with isothermal heat addition {{have been carried out}} with external as well as internal irreversibilities. The ecological function is defined as the power output minus the power loss (irreversibility) which is ambient temperature times the entropy generation rate. The external irreversibility is due to finite temperature difference between the heat engine and the external reservoirs while the internal irreversibilities are due to nonisentropic compression and expansion processes in the compressor and the turbine respectively and the regenerative heat loss. The ecological function is found to be an increasing function of the isothermal-, sink- and regenerative-side effectiveness, isothermal-side inlet temperature, component efficiencies and sink-side temperature while it is found to be a decreasing function of the isobaric-side temperature and effectiveness and the working <b>fluid</b> heat <b>capacitance</b> rate. The effects of the isobaric-side effectiveness are found to be more than those of the other parameters and the effects of turbine efficiency are found to be more than those of the compressor efficiency on all the performance parameters of the cycle...|$|R

The power output is adopted as the objective function and optimized {{with respect to the}} cycle temperature ratio for a typical set of operating parameters.

The effects of the cold-side effectiveness and heat capacitance rate are found to be more than those of the other side effectiveness and heat capacitance rates on the performance of the cycle.

40|$|An {{irreversible}} complex Brayton cycle under maximum {{economic conditions}} has been investigated. The economic function has been optimized {{with respect to}} the cycle temperatures, reheat and intercooling pressure ratios for a typical set of operating conditions. It is found that there are optimal values of the intercooling, reheat and cycle pressure ratios at which the cycle attains the maximum objective function, maximum power and maximum efficiency. The maximum economic point, maximum power point and the maximum efficiency point exist but the economic function corresponding to the maximum power and maximum efficiency is found to be lower than that can be attained and vice-versa. The optimal values of different parameters corresponding to the maximum economic function are different from those corresponding to the maximum efficiency and maximum power for the same set of operating conditions. Again, all the performance parameters further enhance as the heat capacitance rates of the external reservoirs and increased, while it is found to be reverse {{in the case of the}} working <b>fluid</b> heat <b>capacitance</b> rate and the inlet temperature of the conversing combustion chamber (CCC).

The economic function (which {{is defined as}} the power output divided by the total cost) and cycle efficiency are optimised with respect to the cycle temperatures, reheat and intercooling pressure ratios for a typical set of operating conditions. It is found that there are optimal values of the turbine outlet temperature, intercooling, reheat and cycle pressure ratios at which the cycle attains the maximum objective function and maximum efficiency.

40|$|In daily life, {{air-conditioning}} {{devices are}} all around us. To optimize these devices, the prediction of two-phase flow heat transfer of evaporating refrigerants has to be improved. This heat transfer is strongly related to the two-phase flow patterns. Improving the current two-phase flow models should therfore focus on incorporating more flow phenomena into the models. In this work, two-phase flow patterns of horizontal evaporating refrigerant flow in smooth round macro-scale tubes are investigated. A macro-scale test facility for two-phase flow and heat transfer studies of HFCs was designed and constructed. Secondly, a capacitive void fraction sensor was developed to study the dynamic behavior of two-phase flows. The capacitance transducer can measure dynamic signals of <b>fluids</b> with the <b>capacitance</b> of the liquid smaller than 1 pF and still achieve a SNR greater than 300. Capacitance signals of HFCs can thus be investigated. The dynamic capacitance signals in combination with high speed camera images were used to characterize horizontal two-phase flows in an 7. 91 mm ID smooth tube. Two datasets were gathered using R 410 A and R 134 a respectively. A {{detailed description of the}} two-phase flow phenomena was presented together wit a sensor signal charaterization using the time signals as well as PDFs and PSDs. All major two-phase flow phenomena were clearly represented in the sensor signals. To investigate the objectivity in the current flow pattern maps, several statistical parameters were analyzed in combination {{with the use of the}} fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm. The clustering in the selected feature space, groups the data points in clearly separable areas in a flow pattern map. Applying the technique to the HFC datasets, the slug flows could be easily separated from non-slug flows by using the variance of the sensor signal. The AVG and the F 95 parameter were found most suitable for separating intermittent flows from annular flows. From the output of the soft-clustering algorithm a probabilistic flow pattern map was presentd for the HFC data. These maps clearly quantify the width of the transition zones and can be applied for probabilistic heat transfer and/or pressure drop modeling...|$|R
