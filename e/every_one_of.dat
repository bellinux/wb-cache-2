Hogan and Bigelow won <b>every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> these matches.|$|E

5|$|By {{the summer}} of 1949 Street & Smith, {{one of the largest}} pulp publishers, had shut down <b>every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> their pulps. This format was dying out, though it took several more years before the pulps {{completely}} disappeared from the newsstands. Both Thrilling Wonder and Startling went quarterly in 1954, {{and at the end of}} that year Mines left. The magazines did not survive him for long; only two more issues of Thrilling Wonder appeared, both edited by Alexander Samalman. After the beginning of 1955, Thrilling Wonder was merged with Startling, which itself ceased publication at the end of 1955.|$|E
5|$|Donald Fagen of Steely Dan has {{favored the}} sound of the Rhodes over the Wurlitzer Electric Piano, because he felt it was a {{technically}} superior instrument.

5|$|Having {{finished}} third in the league in May 2003, Given and Newcastle lost 4–3 on penalties to Partizan Belgrade early in the 2003–04 season, meaning that Newcastle failed to reach the group stages of the Champions League.

Ian Rush is the club's record goalscorer; he scored 346 goals in his 16 years at Liverpool. Rush is the only player to score more than 300 goals for Liverpool; only three other players have scored more than 200 goals for the club.|$|E

Following his promotion, unit morale improved, and <b>every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> his men re-enlisted.|$|E
5|$|The {{estate is}} {{strongly}} reminiscent of Romanesque architecture, mainly due to alterations {{made to the}} house and grounds by Davenport.

He was very much involved in the world exposition movement. Every two years there were big world expos happening in different cities around the world. And he would travel to <b>every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> these expos...I'm sure that the influences that he picked up in all of his travels are reflected here in Beaumont House.|$|E

5|$|While Shakespeare's {{daffodil}} is {{the wild}} or true English daffodil (N. pseudonarcissus), many other species were introduced, {{some of which}} escaped and naturalised, particularly N. biflorus (a hybrid) in Devon and the west of England. Gerard, in his extensive discussion of daffodils, both wild and cultivated ("bastard daffodils") described twenty four species in London gardens (1597), ("we have them all and <b>every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> them in our London gardens, in great abundance", p.114).|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} most of the top riders in the GC, paced by the race leader himself, caught <b>every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the twelve initial leaders, and {{subsequently}} Garzelli just before the day's last climb, Prà Martino. Di Luca's aggressive descent of Prà Martino gave him a gap over the elite group of riders who had been able to hold his wheel to that point, and the stage win. The day saw a big winner in time gains and a big loser: Lance Armstrong finished 29 seconds behind Di Luca in the same group as the man finishing sixth on the stage, gaining seven places in the GC, while Thomas Lövkvist lost over a minute and fell from second to eighth in the GC.|$|E

5|$|After an offseason of speculation, Favre officially {{signed with}} the Minnesota Vikings on August 18, 2009. He {{would go on to}} have a {{landmark}} season in which he surpassed former Vikings defensive end Jim Marshall for consecutive starts at one position, with 291, became the first quarterback in NFL history to defeat <b>every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the league's 32 franchises since the NFL first expanded to 32 franchises in 2002, surpassed Dan Marino's previous record for four-touchdown games, and was named to his 11th Pro Bowl. The Vikings finished 12-4 and advanced to the NFC Championship game, ultimately losing in overtime to the eventual Super Bowl XLIV champion New Orleans Saints. Despite the loss, Favre set playoff records for pass completions and passing yards previously held by Joe Montana.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth grew camellias in <b>every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> her gardens, {{and before}} her flag-draped coffin {{was taken from}} Windsor to lie in state at Westminster Hall, an {{arrangement}} of camellias from her own gardens was placed on top. An estimated 200,000 people over three days filed past as she lay in state in Westminster Hall at the Palace of Westminster. Members of the household cavalry and other branches {{of the armed forces}} stood guard at the four corners of the catafalque. At one point, her four grandsons Prince Charles, Prince Andrew, Prince Edward and Viscount Linley mounted the guard as a mark of respect—an honour similar to the Vigil of the Princes at the lying in state of King George V.|$|E
5|$|Kansas, {{which had}} won the pre-game coin toss, {{received}} the ball to open the second half. Todd Reesing initially began where he had left off in the first half, completing a pass to Dexton Fields for 12yards and a first down. On subsequent plays, however, Virginia Tech showed some of the defensive prowess that had been promoted heavily heading into the game. Aqib Talib was tackled for a loss of sixyards after catching a pass. Reesing was sacked under heavy pressure from the Tech defense. On third down, a Reesing pass was nearly intercepted by Cody Grimm, who knocked it down to force a Kansas punt. On the subsequent return, Virginia Tech earned its first big play of the game. Eddie Royal, who had returned <b>every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> Virginia Tech's first-half kicks, received the ball and lateraled it to Justin Harper, who returned it 84yards for a touchdown. The score cut Kansas' lead to just three points with 11:35 remaining in the third quarter.|$|E
