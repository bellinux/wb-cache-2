25|$|The {{history of}} {{mathematics}} {{can be seen}} as an ever-increasing series of abstractions. The first abstraction, which is shared by many animals, was probably that of numbers: the realization that a collection of two apples and a collection of two oranges (for example) <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>common,</b> namely quantity of their members.|$|E
2500|$|Traditional {{arguments}} for incompatibilism {{are based on}} an [...] "intuition pump": {{if a person is}} like other mechanical things that are determined in their behavior such as a wind-up toy, a billiard ball, a puppet, or a robot, then people must not have free will. This argument has been rejected by compatibilists such as Daniel Dennett on the grounds that, even if humans <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> with these things, it remains possible and plausible that we are different from such objects in important ways.|$|E
2500|$|Leon Mirsky has said: [...] "combinatorics is a {{range of}} linked studies which <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> and yet diverge widely in their objectives, their methods, {{and the degree of}} {{coherence}} they have attained." [...] One way to define combinatorics is, perhaps, to describe its subdivisions with their problems and techniques. This is the approach that is used below. However, there are also purely historical reasons for including or not including some topics under the combinatorics umbrella. Although primarily concerned with finite systems, some combinatorial questions and techniques can be extended to an infinite (specifically, countable) but discrete setting.|$|E

5000|$|The Generality Constraint, {{according}} to Evans, {{is intended to}} capture the structure that there is in thought. As Evans puts it, [...] "The thought that John is happy <b>has</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> {{with the thought that}} Harry is happy, and the thought that John is happy <b>has</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> with the thought that John is sad" [...] (1982, p. 100). The Generality Constraint requires that if one is to have a thought (that John is happy, for example) about an object (John), then one must be able to conceive of the object (John) as having different properties (such as being sad).|$|R

2500|$|Tom Roland, {{from the}} Country Music Association International, {{explains}} country music's global popularity: [...] "In this respect, at least, Country Music listeners {{around the globe}} <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> {{with those in the}} United States. In Germany, for instance, Rohrbach identifies three general groups that gravitate to the genre: people intrigued with the American cowboy icon, middle-aged fans who seek an alternative to harder rock music and younger listeners drawn to the pop-influenced sound that underscores many current Country hits." [...] One of the first Americans to perform country music abroad was George Hamilton IV. He was the first country musician to perform in the Soviet Union; he also toured in Australia and the Middle East. He was deemed the [...] "International Ambassador of Country Music" [...] for his contributions to the globalization of country music. Johnny Cash, Emmylou Harris, Keith Urban, and Dwight Yoakam have also made numerous international tours. The Country Music Association undertakes various initiatives to promote country music internationally.|$|E
2500|$|Regulated {{genes are}} {{categorized}} {{in terms of}} what they are and what they do, important relationships between genes may emerge. For example, we might see evidence that a certain gene creates a protein to make an enzyme that activates a protein [...] to turn on a second gene on our list. This second gene may [...] be a transcription factor that regulates yet another gene from our list. Observing these links we may begin to suspect that they represent much more than chance associations in the results, and that they are all on our list because of an underlying biological process. On the other hand, it could be that if one selected genes at random, one might find many that seem to <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>common.</b> In this sense, we need rigorous statistical procedures to test whether the emerging biological themes is significant or not. That is where gene set analysis comes in.|$|E

2500|$|Yeston {{was born}} in Jersey City, New Jersey. His English-born father, David, founded the Dial Import Corporation, an {{importing}} and exporting firm, and his mother, Frances, helped run the business. [...] But the family loved music. [...] His father sang English music hall songs, {{and his mother was}} an accomplished pianist. [...] Yeston noted in a 1997 interview, [...] "My mother was trained in classical piano, and her father was a cantor in a synagogue. [...] A lot of musical theatre writers <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>common.</b> Irving Berlin, George Gershwin, Harold Arlen, Kurt Weill – each one had a cantor in the family. When you take a young, impressionable child and put him at age three {{in the middle of a}} synagogue, and that child sees a man in a costume, dramatically raised up on a kind of stage, singing his heart out at the top of his lungs to a rapt congregation, it makes a lasting impression." [...] At age five, Yeston began taking piano lessons from his mother, and by age seven he had won an award for composition. [...] He attended the Yeshiva of Hudson County through grade eight. [...] Yeston's interest in musical theatre began at age ten when his mother took him to see My Fair Lady on Broadway. [...] At Jersey Academy, a small private high school in Jersey City, Yeston broadened his musical study beyond classical and religious music and Broadway show tunes to include jazz, folk, rock and roll, and early music. [...] He took up folk guitar, played vibraphone with a jazz group, and participated in madrigal singing.|$|E

60|$|We {{come next}} to {{relations}}. The easiest relations to apprehend are those which hold {{between the different}} parts of a single complex sense-datum. For example, I can see at a glance {{the whole of the}} page on which I am writing; thus the whole page is included in one sense-datum. But I perceive that some parts of the page are to the left of other parts, and some parts are above other parts. The process of abstraction in this case seems to proceed somewhat as follows: I see successively a number of sense-data in which one part is to the left of another; I perceive, {{as in the case of}} different white patches, that all these sense-data <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>common,</b> and by abstraction I find that what they have in common is a certain relation between their parts, namely the relation which I call 'being to the left of'. In this way I become acquainted with the universal relation.|$|E

60|$|In {{considering}} {{how far the}} theory of natural selection may be extended, --that is, in determining from how many progenitors {{the inhabitants of the}} world have descended,--we may conclude that at least {{all the members of the}} same class have descended from a single ancestor. A number of organic beings are included in the same class, because they present, independently of their habits of life, the same fundamental type of structure, and because they graduate into each other. Moreover, members of the same class can in most cases be shown to be closely alike at an early embryonic age. These facts can be explained on the belief of their descent from a common form; therefore it may be safely admitted that all the members of the same class are descended from one progenitor. But as the members of quite distinct classes <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> in structure and much in common in constitution, analogy would lead us one step further, and to infer as probable that all living creatures are descended from a single prototype.|$|E
60|$|My dear Reynolds--Since you {{all agree}} that the thing[60] is bad, it must be so--though I am not aware there is {{anything}} like Hunt in it (and if there is, it is my natural way, and I <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> with Hunt). Look it over again, and examine into the motives, the seeds, from which any one sentence sprung--I have not the slightest feel of humility towards the public--or to anything in existence,--but the eternal Being, the Principle of Beauty, and the Memory of great Men. When I am writing for myself for the mere sake of the moment's enjoyment, perhaps nature has its course with me--but a Preface is written to the Public; a thing I cannot help looking upon as an Enemy, and which I cannot address without feelings of Hostility. If I write a Preface in a supple or subdued style, {{it will not be}} in character with me as a public speaker--I would be subdued before my friends, and thank them for subduing me--but among Multitudes of Men--I have no feel of stooping, I hate the idea of humility to them.|$|E
60|$|I went to Marlborough House {{to look at}} the English {{pictures}}, which I {{care more}} about seeing, here in England, than those of foreign artists, because the latter will be found more numerously and better on the Continent. I saw many pictures that pleased me; nothing that impressed me very strongly. Pictorial talent seems to be abundant enough, up to a certain point; pictorial genius, I should judge, is among the rarest of gifts. To be sure, I very likely might not recognize it where it existed; and yet it ought to have the power of making itself known even to the uninstructed mind, as literary genius does. If it exist only for connoisseurs, it is a very suspicious matter. I looked at all Turner's pictures, and at many of his drawings; and must again confess myself wholly unable to understand more than a very few of them. Even those few are tantalizing. At a certain distance you discern {{what appears to be a}} grand and beautiful picture, which you shall admire and enjoy infinitely if you can get within the range of distinct vision. You come nearer, and find only blotches of color and dabs of the brush, meaning nothing when you look closely, and meaning a mystery at the point where the painter intended to station you. Some landscapes there were, indeed, full of imaginative beauty, and of the better truth etherealized out of the prosaic truth of Nature; only it was still impossible actually to see it. There was a mist over it; or it was like a tract of beautiful dreamland, seen dimly through sleep, and glimmering out of sight, if looked upon with wide-open eyes. These were the more satisfactory specimens. There were many others which I could not comprehend in the remotest degree; not even so far as to conjecture whether they purported to represent earth, sea, or sky. In fact, I should not have known them to be pictures at all, but might have supposed that the artist had been trying his brush on the canvas, mixing up all sorts of hues, but principally white paint, and now and then producing an agreeable harmony of color without particularly intending it. Now that I have done my best to understand them without an interpreter, I mean to buy Ruskin's pamphlet at my next visit, and look at them through his eyes. But I do not think that I can be driven out of the idea that a picture ought to <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> with what the spectator sees in nature.|$|E

50|$|It {{appears that}} the term was {{inspired}} by Carl Jung's {{use of the term}} collective unconscious. Jellicoe admired Jung, but the use of 'collective landscape' in the above quotation <b>has</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> with its use in collectivism.
