50|$|The {{harmonica}} {{first appeared}} in Vienna, where harmonicas with chambers were sold before 1824 (see also Anton Reinlein and Anton Haeckl). Richter tuning, invented by Joseph Richter (who also is credited with inventing the blow and <b>draw</b> <b>mechanism),</b> was created in 1826 and was eventually adopted nearly universally. In Germany, violin manufacturer Mr. Meisel from Klingenthal bought a harmonica with chambers (Kanzellen) at the Exhibition in Braunschweig in 1824. He and the ironworker Langhammer in the 3-mile-away Graslitz copied the instruments; by 1827 they had produced hundreds of harmonicas. Many others followed in Germany and also nearby in what would later become Czechoslovakia. In 1829, Johann Wilhelm Rudolph Glier also began making harmonicas.|$|E

The traditional Ordinary Least Square (OLS) leaves the estimation of school productivity questionable. Moreover, Hierarchical Linear Model (HLM) encounters {{a large proportion of the}} variance unexplained in the level- 1 equation. In the paper, I will first introduce the Kalman Filter (KF) algorithm together with the Bayesian random <b>draw</b> <b>mechanism</b> to simulate the accurate school effects, and then compare the simulated results with the estimates generated from OLS and HLM. The comparison of the school effects will conclude that the Kalman Filter is more reliable and accurate for the educators and school administrators to supervise the allocation of the school resources for school improvement...|$|E

40|$|Fibres {{obtained}} by gel spinning of ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) {{were drawn to}} various ratios, and {{the improvement of the}} tensile strength of the hot-drawn filaments with increasing draw ratio has been studied. The tensile force at break of gel-spun/hot-drawn UHMWPE fibres appeared to be constant for draw ratios exceeding lambda = 30. From scaling arguments, full chain extension is expected at this draw ratio. On the basis of development of the physical properties during drawing, it is concluded that little disentangling occurs up to lambda = 30. Beyond this point, slippage of chains through entanglement hooks becomes predominant. The observed constant tensile force at break can be explained by this <b>drawing</b> <b>mechanism...</b>|$|R
50|$|Mounted knights {{armed with}} lances proved {{ineffective}} against formations of pikemen combined with crossbowmen whose weapons could penetrate most knights' armor. The invention of pushlever and ratchet <b>drawing</b> <b>mechanisms</b> enabled {{the use of}} crossbows on horseback, leading {{to the development of}} new cavalry tactics. Knights and mercenaries deployed in triangular formations, with the most heavily armored knights at the front. Some of these riders would carry small, powerful all-metal crossbows of their own. Crossbows were eventually replaced in warfare by more powerful gunpowder weapons, although early guns had slower rates of fire and much worse accuracy than contemporary crossbows. Later, similar competing tactics would feature harquebusiers or musketeers in formation with pikemen (pike and shot), pitted against cavalry firing pistols or carbines.|$|R

40|$|Registers of the {{mercenary}} infantry give many {{information about}} types of weapon and its quality. In Warsaw archive we have rolls from 1471, 1477 and 1496 - 1500 {{with information about}} 7000 mercenaries. In rolls we meet different descriptions of quality of crossbows like: good, bed, new, old, used, repaired. We can clasify about 47 % of crossbows as bed, basing on the sources from 1471 and 1477, which contain all these terms. In 1496 we have 14 %, and in 1498 - 22 % bad or old crossbows. Registers give also information about different types of crossbows used by soldiers. They had crossbows with two kinds of bow - horn or steel. Only two from 597 mercenaries had this last type in 1496, similary in 1498, 9 from 725 crossbowmen possesed steel bows. Soldiers used three types of bend mechanism. The oldest one hed the bow-string stretched by hook fastened to soldier’s belt. This type is named kryg in Polish sources. Second kind of belt mechanism is goat’s foot called hewar in medieval Poland (from word „lewar” - lever). <b>Drawing</b> <b>mechanism,</b> which we know as cranequin or windelass appeared in sources as klyky (from Czech word klika - crank) {{and this is the}} third kind of mechanism. All these three different kinds of <b>drawing</b> <b>mechanism</b> could be used by soldiers of the one troop at the same time. Second typ of shooting weapon was bow. This kind of arms was unpopular among mercenaries in end of XV c. Only two soldiers used bows. First bow we meet in 1498 (it is 1 from 725 shooters). Second men with bow appeared in 1500 (rolls from this year mention 1 bowmen among 72 crossbowmen). Zadanie pt.

40|$|Fused {{biconical}} tapering (FBT) is {{an important}} method of manufacturing polarization-maintaining fiber (PMF) couplers. However, the tension {{on the ends of}} the fibers can affect the performance of the coupler. In this paper, a computer-based method of controlling the drawing force was presented. The system includes a <b>drawing</b> <b>mechanism,</b> rotary position encoders, and a control circuit. A three-dimensional model of a permanent magnet and a coil is constructed, and the relationship among the coil current, rotation angle of the clamp, and electromagnetic force is determined using finite element simulations. Electromagnetic force control based on these simulations can be realized. The method is verified experimentally, and it is shown that a drawing force of 0 – 1. 8 [*]gf can be achieved with an error of within 3. 04 %.

40|$|Flyash to 20 wt% {{was added}} to {{polypropylene}} and an ethylene/propylene copolymer with and without {{the addition of a}} maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene coupling agent. The tensile mechanical properties were assessed and the fracture toughness measured by using notched impact specimens. The modulus of the materials increased with the addition of the filler and further increased with the addition of the coupling agent while the yield stress decreased with the addition of 10 wt% filler and no coupling agent but was unchanged from the matrix when the coupling agent was added. Elongation to break was significantly less in those composites to which the coupling agent had been added. Scanning electron microscopy showed that bonding between the matrix and the filler was significantly improved by the addition of the coupling agent and this appeared to hinder the <b>drawing</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in the polymer. The fracture toughness in the copolymer based composites was seen to decrease with filler content...|$|R

In this scheme, the information to be visualized and clustered is represented as a graph, where the nodes represent pieces of information and the edges represent relationships between those pieces. This scheme supports three related models of information, the underlying graph structure, the graph clustered according to some geometric attributes and, the graph represented according to some <b>drawing</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Also introduced is a method for reducing the computational complexity of a graph drawing algorithm called, force directed placement,fromO(n 2) to O(n log n). This method is adapted from an n-body hierarchical force calculation, that allows larger data sets to be draw and visualized on various levels of abstraction. Finally, this method provides the framework for the integration and testing of numerous concepts about how the quality of layout and clustering are related...|$|R

40|$|A new {{technique}} on friction aided deep drawing has been proposed. A metal blank holder {{was designed to}} be of two layers: stationary layer or base with four planes of 5 degrees taper angle and moving layer divided into four tapered segments. Under appropriate blank holding force, these four segments can move radially to the die opening with a constant speed by using a specially designed compression tool. The main function of this developed blank holding device is adopting the frictional force between the blank and the blank holder to work in the useful drawing direction likewise the function of the rubber ring used in Maslennikov's process. Drawing deformation is efficiently performed by using an assistant metal punch, which is supplemented with a hydraulic cylinder to provide a constant punch force during the drawing process. The <b>drawing</b> <b>mechanism</b> and the effects of drawing conditions are mainly investigated to characterize the merits and defects of the proposed process. Since successful deep cups of drawing ratio 3. 76 have been produced the possibility of the present technique is already confirmed, however, further investigations are needed to enhance the drawing efficiency.

40|$|In {{the early}} stages of {{mechanism}} design, type synthesis requires intuition and engineering experience to achieve the desired task. This can only be accomplished by an experienced design engineer. ^ Current type synthesis design techniques are not fully automated. This project utilizes the computer to aid type synthesis of mechanisms by employing symbolic manipulation techniques and frame base knowledge representation in InterLisp-D environment. The study involves the design and creation of a LISP based program the purpose of which is to perform type synthesis operations which are now performed by designers with an expert knowledge of type synthesis methods. The objective of this work is two-fold: First, schematic representations of mechanisms can be automatically developed from graphs. Second, functional evaluation of mechanisms is accomplished. Computer code was developed to <b>draw</b> <b>mechanisms</b> automatically with various revolute, prismatic, and gear joints for different mechanism inversions. A designer can visually inspect the schematics to determine if the mechanisms satisfy the designer 2 ̆ 7 s requirements before a dimensional analysis is performed. ^ Functional evaluation is based on features and joint connectivity and it includes five functional and three structural constraints. The automated process can examine large number of mechanisms in a fraction of the time traditionally required. These techniques were applied to a robot gripper design and two optimum mechanisms were found in which the functional and structural criteria are satisfied. ...|$|R
