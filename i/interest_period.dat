40|$|Saving in the "Zero Interest Period". Private Investors and the Capital Market in Germany in the First World War: This {{paper offers}} {{a look back}} at the period of zero {{interest}} and even negative interest during the First World War. In contrast to the current period of low interest rates, during the war there was an illusion of interest: while savers did receive nominal interest on their deposits, however, the savings deposits lost value due to the war inflation such that it was effectively negative interest. Even {{at the end of the}} war only very few savers were aware that they had experienced a period of declining interest. Rather, they assumed that the purchasing power of the mark and the exchange rate would soon settle down at the pre-war level. The full scope of the dilemma for private investors during the zero <b>interest</b> <b>period</b> became apparent only in the post-war inflation. Although various options between inflation and deflation were still discussed during the revolution and at the beginning of the Weimar Republic, the monetary and fiscal path subsequently taken resulted in the uncontrolled inflation that had significantly greater effects on private investors and the capital market than the war inflation that directly preceded it...|$|E

40|$|The Social Geography – from Apogee to Crisis {{and to the}} Social Geographies of the 21 st Century - The Continuos Shifting of its Focus and of its Area of Interest. Social {{geography}} {{has probably}} been the most dynamic {{and one of the}} most controversial of the human geography’s domains of thematic interests, and the echoes of these attributes are still heard today. Considering these aspects, we believe that summarizing the conceptualizations of its fields of interest and the sphere of its matters of concern is necessary – at least in the context of the present Romanian geographical research – both because of the domain’s epistemological particularities and because of the propitious scientific moment we experience. Every decade, the content of the interest themes in the field of social geography changes significantly. This situation is due to the fact that, substantially simplifying, the main interest themes which have emerged and developed in the field of research, have followed two types of trajectories. One of the patterns was represented by the following stadiality: emergence – the pinnacle of the <b>interest</b> <b>period</b> and the period with the most papers written and published – the critics’ apogee (the critics began at the same time with the development phase) – the fall into abeyance (e. g. representations’ geography, crime geography, geography of poverty, geography of the body etc.) but there are rarely strong come-backs, for instance ones that are based on a methodological renewal of the data processing, now that the complex computerized processing has become standard. The other dynamics alternative resides in the following pattern: emergence – apogee – intensified diversification of the sphere of methodology and matters of concern – the separation of social geography from the body of human geography as an independent subdivision...|$|E
40|$|The present {{work has}} {{investigated}} {{the configuration of}} field‐aligned currents (FACs) during {{a long period of}} radial interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) on 19 May 2002 by using high‐resolution and precise vector magnetic field measurements of CHAMP satellite. During the <b>interest</b> <b>period</b> IMF B y and B z are weakly positive and B x keeps pointing to the Earth for almost 10 h. The geomagnetic indices D s t is about − 40 nT and AE about 100 nT on average. The cross polar cap potential calculated from Assimilative Mapping of Ionospheric Electrodynamics and derived from DMSP observations have average values of 10 – 20 kV. Obvious hemispheric differences are shown in the configurations of FACs on the dayside and nightside. At the south pole FACs diminish in intensity to magnitudes of about 0. 1 μA/m 2, the plasma convection maintains two‐cell flow pattern, and the thermospheric density is quite low. However, there are obvious activities in the northern cusp region. One pair of FACs with a downward leg toward the pole and upward leg on the equatorward side emerge in the northern cusp region, exhibiting opposite polarity to FACs typical for duskward IMF orientation. An obvious sunward plasma flow channel persists during the whole period. These ionospheric features might be manifestations of an efficient magnetic reconnection process occurring in the northern magnetospheric flanks at high latitude. The enhanced ionospheric current systems might deposit large amount of Joule heating into the thermosphere. The air densities in the cusp region get enhanced and subsequently propagate equatorward on the dayside. Although geomagnetic indices during the radial IMF indicate low‐level activity, the present study demonstrates that there are prevailing energy inputs from the magnetosphere to both the ionosphere and thermosphere in the northern polar cusp region. Key Points A pair of strong FACs emerges with opposite polarity to DPY FACs Obvious sunward plasma flow channel persists during the period Enhanced air densities are found in the cusp regio...|$|E

A finalidade do regime autorit?rio, em especial na educa??o, era utilizar os livros did?ticos como dispositivos para controle e condicionamento da ordem social na busca por uma forma??o cidad? passiva e domesticada. Com questionamentos e inquieta??es formadas no velejar de experi?ncias, pesquisas e pr?ticas docentes, o presente trabalho teve como objetivo compreender as representa??es de Cidadania na educa??o brasileira durante o Regime Militar, por meio dos livros did?ticos de Educa??o Moral e C?vica (EMC), de 1964 a 1985. Para a realiza??o dessa investiga??o, utilizamos como fontes de an?lise tr?s livros did?ticos de EMC, veiculados no per?odo de interesse, sendo cada um deles referente a uma d?cada da Ditadura Civil-Militar. Como aporte te?rico-metodol?gico, o trabalho ? subsidiado pelos conceitos de Chartier (1990, 1991, 1994, 1996, 2010) : apropria??o, pr?ticas e, principalmente, representa??es. Mediante esse aporte, analisamos os livros did?ticos de EMC considerando n?o apenas o conceito de Cidadania, mas as dicotomias entre o discurso e as representa??es presentes nas obras e na pr?tica cidad? no per?odo, bem como a materialidade dos livros da disciplina. Na busca por respostas aos nossos questionamentos, constru?mos uma discuss?o que denominamos de ?Mosaico Hist?rico?. Nessa discuss?o, apresentamos um debate entre os elementos, ou melhor, entre as tesselas (pe?as que formam um mosaico) fundamentais para a compreens?o do texto: Cidadania, Regime Militar, educa??o, pr?ticas, representa??es e discurso. Por interm?dio delas, discutimos a conjuntura do per?odo, trazemos para o debate como a Cidadania estava representada e quais mudan?as ocorreram na educa??o brasileira. Considerando as quest?es levantadas e a an?lise das fontes, elucidamos que a forma??o cidad? passiva contribuiu para a??es pol?ticas e econ?micas do Governo Militar, motivando algumas continuidades e rupturas nas representa??es de Cidadania nos livros did?ticos de EMC no percorrer das d?cadas do regime. Citizenship, this {{research}} analysis rate, had different representations, practices and appropriations during the Civil Military Dictatorship. The authoritarian regime end, {{especially in the}} education area, was to use the didactic books as dispositive to the social order control and conditioning, searching a passive and domesticated citizen rise. With questions and uneasiness built by experiences, researches and teach practices, the present work objected to comprehend the Citizenship representations in the Brazilian education during the Military Regime, using the Moral and Civic Education didactic books (MCE), at 1964 to 1985. To this investigation execution, we used tree MCE didactic books as analysis sources diffused in the <b>interest</b> <b>period.</b> Every single book is relative to a Civil Military Dictatorship decade. As theoretical methodological support, the work is subsidized by the Chartier (1990, 1991, 1994, 1996, 2010) concepts: appropriations, practices and, principally, representations. Trough this support, we analyzed the MCE didactic books, considering not only the Citizenship concept, but the dichotomies between the speech and the representations presented in the titles and citizen practices at the period, and the materiality of the discipline books. Searching for asks to our questions, we built a discussion named ?Historical Mosaic?. In this discussion, we presented a debate between the elements, or better, between the tesseras (mosaic pieces), essential to the text comprehension: Citizenship, Military Regime, education, practices, representations and speech. According to these words, we discussed the period conjuncture, we brought to the debate how the Citizenship was represented and the changes {{that occurred in the}} Brazilian education. Considering the pointed questions and the analyzed sources, we elucidated that the passive citizen rise contributed to the political and economic actions of the Military Government, stimulating some continuations and ruptures in the Citizenship representations in the MCE didactic books, during the Regime decades...|$|E

A resposta a estes questionamentos constitui a linha mestra de condução deste trabalho, que possui como período de interesse aquele {{posterior}} à edição da Lei Federal de Recursos Hídricos (Lei Federal n 9433 / 1997) até a presente data. A verificação da implementação (ou não) da gestão democrática e participativa da água {{no local}} estudado foi buscada mediante aprofundamento no local investigado e suas relações sociais, busca de conhecimentos específicos sobre os efeitos da atividade de geração hidrelétrica, análise dos marcos jurídicos balizadores da política de recursos hídricos e uma incursão teórico-conceitual. O objetivo específico do trabalho dirige-se à verificação da existência de gestão participativa da água na bacia hidrográfica do litoral do Paraná e a influência das geradoras hidrelétricas neste contexto, bem como da geração de externalidades econômicas e impactos ambientais negativos ocasionados pela operação destes empreendimentos na região. Para avanço no processo de pesquisa e elaboração da dissertação partiu-se de uma perspectiva ancorada na complexidade das relações entre sociedade e ambiente, estabelecendo-se uma pergunta de partida que foi desdobrada em hipótese, a qual deu origem a variáveis, cuja apuração subsidiou a resposta ao problema proposto. Com relação à base de dados, foram coletados elementos junto ao poder público, agentes do mercado, pesquisadores, sociedade civil e comunidades ribeirinhas, conjugando-se aqueles produzidos num ambiente de conhecimento científico com informações marcadas por impressões do senso comum. O encadeamento do estudo teórico e os dados coletados permitiram o oferecimento de resposta à pergunta inicial, a qual aponta para a não implementação da gestão democrática e participativa dos recursos hídricos na bacia litorânea do Paraná, com influência da atividade de geração hidrelétrica para perpetuação desta condição. Is there a democratic {{management of the}} water resources at the coastline basin of Paraná? Does the hydroelectric generation activity influence this fact? The answer of these questions constitute the master line in the conduction of this academic work, that has as <b>interest</b> <b>period</b> the one before the Water Resources Federal Law (Federal Law n 9433 / 1997) {{up to the present}} date. The implementation verification (or not) of the democratic management and participative of the water at the studied place was searched through deepen at the researched place and its social relations, search of specific knowledge about the hydroelectric generation activity effects, analyses of the referential juridical limit of the hydroelectric generation activity and a theory conceptual incursion. The specific objective of the work addresses to determinate the existence of water participatory management in the water parting of the Paraná coast, the influence of hydroelectric dams in this context, but also the generation of economic externalities and negative environmental impacts associated with the operation of these developments in the region. The advance in the process of research and preparation of the dissertation came from a perspective rooted in the complexity of the relationships between society and environment, establishing a starting question that was deployed in hypotheses, which gave rise to variables, whose determination supported the answer to the proposed problem. Regarding the database, information was collected with the government, market players, researchers, civil society and coastal communities, combining those produced in an environment of scientific knowledge with information marked by common sense impressions. The link of the theory study and of the collected data will allow the initial question to be answered, which signalizes to the non implementation of the democratic management and participative of the water resources at the coastline basin of Paraná, with influence of the hydroelectric generation activity for the perpetuation of this condition...|$|E
