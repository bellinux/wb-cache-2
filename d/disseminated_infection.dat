50|$|If {{this occurs}} with the classic buboes, this is {{considered}} primary, while secondary occurs after symptoms of bubonic or pneumonic infection. Since the bacteria are blood-borne, several organs can be affected, including the spleen and brain.

50|$|The main {{route of}} {{infection}} is inhalation of airborne spores through the respiratory pathway. This can occur in both healthy and immunocompromised individuals however a <b>disseminated</b> <b>infection</b> {{is more common in}} the latter. After inhalation the conidia switch to their adiaspore state, triggered by the temperature increase within the body. These develop without replicating in the alveoli of the lung. Transmission can originate directly from the soil or through an animal reservoir such as mice or bats.|$|E
50|$|Infection cases cased by {{exposure}} to Exserohilum are rare, but it's the most well studied detail of the fungi. The three species of Exserohilum that are identified as human pathogens are: Exserohilum Rostratum, Exserohilum longirostratum and Exserohilum mcginnisii. Prevailing infections include sinusitis, skin infection and in some rare cases, cerebral absecesses, keratitis, osteomyelitis, prothetic valve endocarditis, and <b>disseminated</b> <b>infection.</b> Reports of human infection by Exserohilum mainly come from warm, tropical and subtropical locations such as southern United States, India, and Israel.|$|E

5000|$|Scedosporium prolificans {{has been}} {{recognized}} {{as an agent of}} opportunistic human disease since the 1990s. This species is primarily associated with subcutaneous lesions arising from injury following [...] "traumatic implantation" [...] of the agent via contaminated splinters or plant thorns. The majority of S. prolificans infections in immunologically normal people remain localized, characteristically with bone or joint involvement. <b>Disseminated</b> <b>infections</b> from S. prolificans are largely limited to people with pre-existing immune impairment. Notably, S. prolificans exhibits varying tolerance to all currently available antifungal agents. This is particularly true of strains recovered from <b>disseminated</b> <b>infections,</b> and these infections carry a high mortality. Scedosporium prolificans has also been known to cause disseminated disease secondary to myeloblastic leukemia and following lung transplant. In otherwise healthy people, it was recorded as a cause of corneal infection following a lawn trimmer mishap, and bone infection following trauma.|$|R

50|$|From the Latin ab- (“away”) + cedere (“to go”), an abscess {{is named}} for the notion that humors leave the body through pus. Mycobacterium abscessus was first {{isolated}} from gluteal abscesses in a 62-year-old patient who had injured her knee {{as a child and}} had a <b>disseminated</b> <b>infection</b> 48 years later. The species M. bolletii, named after the late microbiologist and taxonomist Claude Bollet, was described in 2006. In current taxonomy, M. bolletii and M. massiliense (named for Massilia, the ancient Greek and Roman name for Marseille, where the organism was isolated) have been incorporated into M. abscessus subsp. bolletii.|$|E
50|$|The term “phaeohyphomycosis” was {{introduced}} to determine infections caused by dematiaceous or pigmented filamentous fungi which contain melanin in their cell walls. Phaeohyphomycosis is an uncommon infection, however the number of case reported has been increasing in recent years. The presence of melanin in cell walls may be a virulence factor for the pathogens caused by the fungi. The outcome of antifungal treatment is poor, and mortality is almost 80%. Phaeohyphomycosis {{has been attributed to}} more than 100 species and 60 genera of fungi over the past several decades. The pathogens are considered opportunistic. Almost all cases of widely <b>disseminated</b> <b>infection</b> have occurred in immunosuppressed patients.|$|E
50|$|Infections by S. vasiformis {{are mainly}} treated with drug {{amphotericin}} B because this species is resistant to many antifungal agents. The {{side effect of}} amphotericin B is renal toxicity, but the chances of side effect can be reduced by administering amphotericin B in incremental doses to reach maximum daily dose of 0.5 to 0.75 mg/kg. Furthermore, amphotericin B deoxycholate is more nephrotoxic than liposomal amphotericin B; however, due to expensive cost of liposomal amphotericin B, many of the patients were unable to afford this therapy, resulting in fatal outcome. In addition, another antifungal agent, posaconazole, was able to successfully treat <b>disseminated</b> <b>infection</b> by S. vasiformis in vitro, suggesting {{that it could be}} used as an alternative to amphotericin B for the treatment of the infections.|$|E
