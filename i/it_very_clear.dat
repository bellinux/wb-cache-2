So I felt like, well, I've finally got this thing going but it's dead. Flood and I had to record Broken under a {{different}} band name, because if TVT found out we were recording, they could confiscate all our shit and release it. Jimmy Iovine got involved with Interscope, and we kind of got slave-traded. It wasn't my doing. I didn't know anything about Interscope. And I was real pissed off at him at first because it was going from one bad situation to potentially another one. But Interscope went into it like {{they really wanted to}} know what I wanted. It was good, after I put my raving lunatic act on.|$|E
25|$|This {{explanation}} of Ubay also makes <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> that the Companions {{did not differ}} at all about what {{was part of the}} Quran and what {{was not part of the}} Quran when the revelation had ceased. It is also important to note that the hadith appeared in the mushaf of Ubay because it was for his own personal use, in other words, his private notebook, where he did not always distinguish between Quranic material and hadith, since it was not meant for general use and he himself knew well what to make of his own notes. The same is true of the other copies of the Quran, which some of the Companions had for their own personal use.|$|E
25|$|November 23: After {{becoming}} {{a free agent}} following the conclusion to the 2011 season, the Braves decided to decline arbitration to shortstop Álex González. If the team had accepted his arbitration they would have received a compensatory draft pick {{between the first and}} second rounds of the 2012 MLB draft if González signed with another team. The move made <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> that González would not return as the starting shortstop in 2012. González looked to receive a multi-year contract on the free agent market, something the Braves were not willing to offer due to rising prospects such as Tyler Pastornicky and Andrelton Simmons. On December 8, González signed a contract with the Milwaukee Brewers for one year and a vesting option for the 2013 season.|$|E

25|$|The WACs {{received}} the same pay, allowances, and benefits as regular army units, though time spent as a WAC did not count toward time served and the allowance for dependents was heavily restricted. The WACs were now disciplined, promoted, and given the same legal protections as regular Army units, and the 150,000 ceiling was lifted. While the legislators made <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> they expected the WACs to be noncombatants, the bill contained no specific restrictions. Existing Army regulations still prohibited them from combat training with weapons, tactical exercises, duty assignments requiring weapons, supervising men, and jobs requiring great physical strength, unless waived by the United States Secretary of War; but of the 628 Army specialties, women now qualified for 406. Additional Army regulations were adopted to cover pregnancy, marriage, and maternity care.|$|E
25|$|According to simulations, a two-lane {{roundabout}} {{with three}} right turns should offer 12–20% greater traffic flow than a conventional, three-lane roundabout {{of the same}} size. The reason is reduced weaving that makes entering and exiting more predictable. Because there are only ten points of conflict (compared with 8 for a conventional single lane roundabout, or between 32 and 64 with traffic signal control), this design is often safer as well. Research and experiments show that traffic accidents are reduced by 72% on turbo roundabouts compared to multi-lane roundabouts, which have 12 points of conflict. Research at Windesheim University also shows that turbo roundabouts reduce accidents including casualties by some 75% when compared to regular intersections, and by 61% compared to single-lane roundabouts. The same research made <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> that it is safer for cyclists not to have priority over motor vehicles on the roundabout, than to have it.|$|E
25|$|Parker {{immediately}} {{went to work}} {{to find a new}} label for Presley. Both Mercury Records and Columbia Records showed interest, although their initial offers were nowhere near the $40,000 requirement. RCA Victor, Hank Snow's current label, was also showing an interest, but they were also put off by the cost of the contract. However, RCA Victor producer Steve Sholes was convinced that Presley's style of music would be a huge hit with the right label, and he began talks with Parker. RCA made <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> they were unwilling to go above $25,000 for a practically unknown singer, but Parker persuaded them that Presley was no ordinary unknown singer. Around the same time, realizing the deal for Presley might fall through due to the cost of the contract, Parker attempted once again to sell Tommy Sands to RCA. He suggested to Sholes that Sands could record material similar to Presley's style. Sholes, remembering his previous experience with Sands, dismissed him as a viable replacement for Presley.|$|E

25|$|The Company made <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> that {{published}} timetables {{were only}} {{to indicate the}} times before which a train would not depart and the specified times for each stop were only given as a rough guide. Trains normally made three regular and eight conditional stops, but 'expresses' did run which did not stop between Bideford and Westward Ho!. With two engines in steam the frequency could be every half-hour, but a train every hour or so was the norm in summer, normally taking about 20 minutes from Bideford to Northam or 15 minutes for the 'express'. Fifteen trains ran in each direction in the July 1906 Bideford to Northam timetable and lighter service of four ran on Sundays. The 1910 Bradshaw's Timetable shows trains taking thirty minutes for the journey from Bideford to Appledore, ten trains in each direction, with an extra run on the Market Days (Tuesdays and Saturdays) and no trains on Sundays. The winter timetable for 1 November 1917 to 30 April 1918, which was destined never to be used, was down to seven trains in each direction and no Sunday service. Horse-drawn buses ran from Westward Ho! to Clovelly and through tickets were issued from Instow to cover the journey by ferry, railway and road transport. The bus service cost £51 18s 0d (£51.90) {{to run for the}} six months ending 31 December 1906.|$|E
500|$|Sir Geoffrey Archer was {{appointed}} Governor-General of Sudan in 1925 {{in place of}} Sir Lee Stack. One of his early decisions was to initiate {{the formation of the}} Sudan Defence Force, with a command completely separate from the Egyptian army. He dropped the Egyptian title [...] "Sirdar" [...] for the supreme commander, and did not wear the Egyptian tarboush. He made <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> that he was commander in chief of a purely Sudanese army, while reassuring Sudanese officers who had served in the Egyptian army that they would be retained if they had not taken part in the mutiny. The British authorities, who had again became hostile to Mahdism, banned enlistment of Ansar into the Sudanese Defence Force.|$|E
500|$|In {{the weeks}} {{following}} Irwin's death, {{at least ten}} stingrays were found dead and mutilated on the beaches of Queensland, with their tails cut off, prompting speculation {{as to whether they}} might have been killed by fans of Irwin as an act of revenge, although, according to the chairman of the Queensland fishing information service, anglers regularly cut the tails off of accidentally caught stingrays to avoid being stung. Michael Hornby, a friend of Irwin and executive director of his Wildlife Warrior fund, condemned any revenge killings, saying that [...] "We just want to make <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> that we will not accept and not stand for anyone who's taken a form of retribution.

One good thing came from the visit, there were talks of making her an honorary citizen of the town. Ultimately, a statue of Madonna, wearing conical bra was elected in her name, {{at the center of the}} town. The Vatican was outraged by the plans of erecting the statue, with the Pope's spokesperson commenting: [...] "The statue would be too sexy and might corrupt the morals of Italy's fine young people." ...|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{before the}} film was due to air on British {{television}} in December 2012, Hedren gave an interview to the Daily Mail in which she repeated her claims about Hitchcock: [...] "He made <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> {{what was expected of}} me, but I was equally clear that I wasn't interested...Nobody is denying that Hitchcock was a brilliant moviemaker and I enjoyed working with him before I realised he was starting to take an almost obsessive interest in me." [...] Other actresses have spoken about the close attention Hitchcock paid to details of the leading ladies' characters and appearances in his films, but they said that no harassment was involved. Eva Marie Saint, who starred in 1959's North by Northwest, told The Daily Telegraph [...] "Hitchcock was a gentleman, he was funny, he was so attentive to me, with the character, and he cared about everything my character Eve Kendall wore. He had an eye for the specifics of the character." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to Luna as Reyes and Whitehead as James, guest stars for the episode include Mallory Jansen as Aida, José Zúñiga as Morrow, Kerr Smith as Joseph, Phil Tyler as watchdog #1, Sergio Enrique as guard, Tanner Fontana as Elliot and Lilli Birdsell as Lucy. Luna, Jansen, Whitehead, and Birdsell reprise their roles from {{earlier in the}} series. When asked whether the series still wanted to pursue stories about Inhumans such as James, Whedon said they are [...] "still in our world, so we still have {{some of these people}} in the mix ... but right now we’re on the Ghost Rider kick." [...] On having Johnson and Reyes join up with S.H.I.E.L.D., Whedon called it uneasy [...] "for everyone involved. Daisy has made <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> that she doesn’t want to be with our team. There’s all that history and pain there. For Robbie, {{this is a guy who}} has never had a team, and probably doesn’t function well within one.

500|$|The most {{interesting}} {{part of that}} {{for me is that}} audiences seem very unwilling to believe the stuff that Teddy [...] says at the end and yet why? I think its because people have spent the entire film looking at Leonard's photograph of Teddy, with the caption: [...] "Don't believe his lies." [...] That image really stays in people's heads, and they still prefer to trust that image even after we make <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> that Leonard's visual recollection is completely questionable. It was quite surprising, and it wasn't planned. What was always planned was that we don't ever step completely outside Leonard's head, and that we keep the audience in that interpretive mode of trying to analyze what they want to believe or not. For me, the crux of the movie is that the one guy who might actually be the authority on the truth of what happened is played by Joe Pantoliano ... who is so untrustworthy, especially given the baggage he carries in from his other movies: he's already seen by audiences as this character actor who's always unreliable. I find it very frightening, really, the level of uncertainty and malevolence Joe brings to the film.|$|E
500|$|It {{has been}} argued in recent years, mainly by foreign commentators, that the CPC {{does not have an}} ideology, and that the party {{organization}} is pragmatic and interested only in what works. This view is considered wrong by some in many ways, since official statements make <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> the party does have a coherent worldview. For instance, Hu Jintao stated in 2012 that the Western world is [...] "threatening to divide us" [...] and that [...] "the international culture of the West is strong while we are weak ... Ideological and cultural fields are our main targets". The CPC puts a great deal of effort into the party schools and into crafting its ideological message. Before the [...] "Practice Is the Sole Criterion for the Truth" [...] campaign, the relationship between ideology and decision-making was a deductive one, meaning that policy-making was derived from ideological knowledge. Under Deng this relationship was turned upside down, with decision-making justifying ideology and not the other way around. Lastly, Chinese policy-makers believe {{that one of the reasons}} for the dissolution of the Soviet Union was its stagnant state ideology. They therefore believe that their party ideology must be dynamic to safeguard the party's rule, unlike the Soviet Union's communist party, whose ideology they believe became [...] "rigid, unimaginative, ossified, and disconnected from reality." ...|$|E
500|$|The Paris {{delegation}}, led by Bertrand Delanoë, {{argued that}} Tony Blair and the London delegation {{had broken the}} IOC rules. On 11 July 2005, Delanoë stated: [...] "They have not respected the rules established by the International Olympic Committee. I do not {{say that they were}} flirting with the yellow line, I say that they crossed the yellow line". A controversial move by the London bid team was its initiative to offer incentive packages for participating athletes, which included free flights, food, vouchers for long-distance calling and other financial accommodations. Immediately after announcing the initiative, London withdrew it, most likely as a result of Jacques Rogge raising concerns over its potential to start a [...] "bidding war". Paris also claimed that the lobbying by Tony Blair was illegal, an accusation that was strongly denied by Downing Street. It was not until 4 August 2005 that Jacques Rogge suppressed any further controversies by saying in a statement: [...] "I made <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> that, in my opinion, the competition was fair. It was conducted according to the rules that we have set out". Delanoë's comments were criticised by Parisian political leaders; Claude Goasguen, president of the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) party of the Council of Paris, stated: [...] "One cannot make such type of accusations without delivering any proof".|$|E

500|$|Tony Blair {{recorded}} his {{part for the}} episode in April 2003, in ten minutes at Downing Street. Blair was sent the script {{early on in the}} writing process, and it took eight months of negotiation between Fox and Blair's director of communications Alastair Campbell before Blair could appear as a guest star. In the original script, Blair was supposed to welcome the Simpsons to the United Kingdom [...] "with a garland of 'genuine Newcastle coal' and hand [...] a complimentary Corgi", but Campbell had them changed, as Blair [...] "made <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> that he was only interested in doing the show if he could promote tourism in Britain". The show's staff did not know whether Blair would actually record his lines until showrunner Al Jean and his wife were in London promoting the 300th episode of The Simpsons. They received a call stating: [...] "If you go over to Downing Street tomorrow and can promise to get the recording done in 15 minutes, then the Prime Minister will do it". Jean was [...] "so nervous, it was ridiculous" [...] when he met Blair, an event he has cited as [...] "one of the most fantastic moments of his life". Blair was the top choice to guest star in the episode, but the staff did not think they {{had a chance to get}} him to appear. Blair is the only head of government to guest star in the show, with Rudy Giuliani (who played himself in the episode [...] "Stop! Or My Dog Will Shoot") the only other politician to guest star.|$|E
500|$|Producer Bob Ezrin {{had worked}} with Alice Cooper, Lou Reed, and Kiss, as well as {{producing}} Peter Gabriel's debut solo album. At the suggestion of Waters's then-girlfriend Lady Carolyne Christie, who had worked as Ezrin's secretary, the band hired him to co-produce the album. From the start, Waters made <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> who was in charge: [...] "You can write anything you want. Just don't expect any credit". [...] Ezrin, Waters, and Gilmour read Waters's concept, keeping what they liked, and discarding {{what they thought was}} not good enough. Waters and Ezrin worked mostly on the story, improving the concept. [...] A 40-page script was presented {{to the rest of the}} band, with positive results: [...] "The next day at the studio, we had a table read, like you would with a play, but with the whole of the band, and their eyes all twinkled, because then they could see the album." [...] Ezrin broadened the storyline, distancing it from the autobiographical work Waters had written, and instead basing it on a composite, or gestalt character named Pink. Engineer Nick Griffiths later said of the Canadian producer, [...] "Ezrin was very good in The Wall, because he did manage to pull the whole thing together. He's a very forceful guy. There was a lot of argument about how it should sound between Roger and Dave, and he bridged the gap between them." [...] Waters wrote most of the album's material, with Gilmour co-writing [...] "Comfortably Numb", [...] "Run Like Hell", and [...] "Young Lust", and Ezrin co-writing [...] "The Trial".|$|E
500|$|The film {{received}} widespread acclaim. Kate Stables {{wrote in}} Sight & Sound: [...] "Elegant restraint is the film’s watchword ... In this enjoyably deliberate film, each shot and scene is carefully composed {{to pay homage}} to 50s cinema, yet infused with an emotional ambiguity which feels decidedly contemporary." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times said: [...] " [...] has made a serious melodrama about the geometry of desire, a dreamy example of heightened reality that fully engages emotions despite the exact calculations with which it's been made... 'Carol's' lush but controlled visual look is completely intoxicating. This is filmmaking done by masters, an experience to savor." [...] A.O. Scott wrote in The New York Times: [...] "At once ardent and analytical, cerebral and swooning, 'Carol' is a study in human magnetism, in the physics and optics of eros. With sparse dialogue and restrained drama, the film is a symphony of angles and glances, of colors and shadows." [...] Amy Taubin from Film Comment said: [...] "The narrative, precisely chiseled by Phyllis Nagy from the ungainly novel, is deceptively simple ... What's remarkable about Carol is that it seems to exist entirely in the present moment—to be precise, in that electric, elastic, heart-stopping/heart-racing present of romantic desire. It is a film composed of gestures and glances, its delicacy a veiled promise of abandon. And it could not exist without the extraordinary performances of Blanchett and Mara." [...] David Stratton of The Australian wrote: [...] "The meeting of these two women is an electrifying scene; their eyes make contact, and nothing of significance is said, apart from the usual interaction between shopper and shop assistant, but Haynes and his wonderful actors make <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> that something momentous has occurred — love at first sight." ...|$|E
