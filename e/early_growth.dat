Fire {{management of}} Banksia aemula heath in Southeast Queensland recommends 7- to 20-year fire intervals. Intervals of 10–15 years are recommended for the Eastern Suburbs Banksia Scrub, as longer leads to overgrowth by Leptospermum laevigatum. Experimenting with seed germination and <b>early</b> <b>growth</b> of B.aemula showed that phosphorus was toxic to seedlings, inhibiting growth at double normal soil concentrations and causing seedling death at quadruple normal soil concentrations. The addition of potassium or magnesium ameliorated these effects a little although potassium in high concentrations impacted on growth as well. Overall, seedlings grow slowly {{over the first}} 21 weeks of life compared with other plant species, the reasons for which are unclear, {{although it may be}} that it offers an increased chance of survival in a nutrient- or water-poor environment.

5|$|Leguat {{stated that}} the Rodrigues {{solitaire}} fed on dates, whereas Tafforet mentioned seeds and leaves. No other accounts mention diet. It has been suggested it ate latan palm fruits, for which it competed with the now extinct Cylindraspis tortoises. It is not known how the young were fed, but related pigeons provide crop milk. The risings on the crop of the female may have covered glands that produced the crop milk. If the theory is correct, the birds may have practiced a division of labour, where the female stayed and fed the young crop milk, while the male collected food in the crop and delivered it to the female.

5|$|The Baptists {{established}} the oldest extant churches in Hampshire County. After {{the end of}} the American Revolutionary War, Baptist preachers continued their attempt to gain a foothold in what is now the Eastern Panhandle region. During the Baptists' <b>early</b> <b>growth</b> in Hampshire County, the best known Baptist ministers were John Monroe (1750–1824) and Benjamin Stone (1743–1842). Monroe preached at the North River, Crooked Run, and Patterson's Creek churches during the early 19th century. According to historians Hu Maxwell and Howard Llewellyn Swisher in History of Hampshire County, West Virginia (1897), Monroe was a minister for Primitive Baptists, who were adherent to a strict interpretation of the Calvinist theology of the Ketocton Association. Monroe probably established a Baptist church {{on the site of the}} present-day Capon Chapel, where he is buried in the church's cemetery. However, other sources claim that a Baptist congregation began gathering at the Capon Chapel site as early as 1756.|$|E

5|$|The {{lifespan}} of the Columbian mammoth {{is thought}} to have been about 80 years. The lifespan of a mammal is related to its size; Columbian mammoths are larger than modern elephants, which have a lifespan of about 60 years. The age of a mammoth can be roughly determined by counting the growth rings of its tusks when viewed in cross section. However, ring-counting does not account for a mammoth's early years; <b>early</b> <b>growth</b> is represented in tusk tips, which are usually worn away. In the remainder of the tusk each major line represents a year, with weekly and daily lines found in between. Dark bands correspond to summer, making it possible to determine the season in which a mammoth died. Tusk growth slowed when foraging became more difficult, such as during illness or when a male mammoth was banished from the herd (male elephants live with their herds until about the age of ten).|$|E
5|$|The {{research}} Fischbach {{conducted at}} Columbia University stemmed from his previous work at Harvard University, Washington University {{and with the}} National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institute of Health. The specialized focus of his research was on the influence trophic factors could have on the survival of nerve cells and the efficiency of synapses. After his arrival to Columbia, Fischbach {{was focused on the}} expression of neuregulin in regards to neuromuscular synapses, signaling pathways in the brain, transcription factors, as well as work on autism. His research on Neuregulin-1 revealed a possible function in CNS neurogenesis since the neuregulins were labeled throughout proliferation with an anti-MAP2 antibody and an anti-nestin antibody were suggested to have become neuron-restricted progenitors. Some of his other research examined the relationship between neuregulin and expression of myosin heavy chain and transcription factors in human muscle. The research found that treatment including neuregulin increased the number of acetylcholine receptors {{on the surface of the}} myotube as well as an increase in the <b>early</b> <b>growth</b> response family for transcription factors. These findings impact the available knowledge regarding muscle spindle fiber formation, myosin heavy chains development, and the feasibility of mimicking muscle development processes in vitro.|$|E

University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2006 Correlation and {{stepwise}} {{regression analyses}} were used to investigate relationships between growth in four distinct marine habitats, marine survival, and biophysical indices for Auke Creek coho salmon, a coho salmon population in Southeast Alaska. <b>Early</b> marine <b>growth</b> {{of males and females}} were positively correlated, but neither was correlated with <b>early</b> marine <b>growth</b> of jacks. Regional biophysical indices had significant effects on <b>early</b> marine <b>growth</b> of jack, but not on <b>early</b> marine <b>growth</b> of adult coho salmon. Sea surface temperature and number of hatchery pink and churn salmon juveniles released had negative and positive effects on growth in strait habitat, respectively. Hatchery pink and churn salmon abundance and pink salmon catch in Northern Southeast Alaska were negatively related to the growth of Auke Creek coho salmon in the late ocean phase. The average length-at-return of males, but not females, was negatively related to the abundance of hatchery pink and chum salmon. Female and male size-at-return were positively correlated (r = 0. 68) but within-year variation was less for females, indicating possible sex-specific differences in adult size requirements associated with reproductive success.
