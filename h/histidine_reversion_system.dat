At higher fluences the overall mutant frequency response could be resolved into one-hit and two-hit components.

Even low-level pollution of these ecosystems can cause adverse effects to the ecology (Hildebrandt et al. 2008). There are number of analytical methods {{that have been}} used widely for the evaluation of mutagenicity and genotoxicity (Egito et al. 2007; Gupta and Ahmad 2012). In this study, Harike wetland is taken as an area for the analysis. Wetland is surrounded by agricultural field used for cultivation of wheat, rice and other seasonal crops. Over the years, the wetland has been facing a threat from a developing economy with increasing pressure on the resources (Chopra et al. 2001; Jain et al. 2008). As a result, many parts of southern Punjab and Rajasthan are facing a number of health problems. The plants and animals residing in the wetland are also under great pressure of pollutants. To assess mutagenic/genotoxic effect as well as to understand the composition of pollution load of Harike wetland, the present research plan was framed using short-term Ames Salmonella <b>histidine</b> <b>reversion</b> assay and plasmid nicking assay along with determining physicochemical analysis and heavy metal content.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the antimutagenic activity of the methanol extract of Origanum vulgare L. subsp. vulgare. Antimutagenic activity was estimated by employing the plate incorporation AMES/Salmonella <b>histidine</b> <b>reversion</b> assay. The base pair substitution tester strain Salmonella typhimurium TA 1535 and the frame shift mutagen strain S. typhimurium TA 1538 were used against direct acting mutagens- sodium azide (NaN 3), 4 -nitro- 1 -quinoline oxide (4 NQO) and the S 9 -dependent mutagen 2 -aminofluorene (2 AF). The results suggested that in the absence of S 9 metabolic activation, all 3 doses (5, 0. 5, and 0. 05 μg/plate) of the plant extract tested caused statistically significant (P < 0. 05) antimutagenic activity on TA 1535 strain, but not on TA 1538 strain. However, in the presence of S 9 microsomal fraction, the plant extract exerted moderate antimutagenic activity against the 2 AF mutagen and reduced mutant colonies in TA 1535 and TA 1538 strains. As a result, the methanol extract of Origanum vulgare subsp. vulgare showed antimutagenic effects at 5, 0. 5, and 0. 05 μg/plate concentrations. These effects may be explained with the antioxidant activity mechanism, changes in membrane lipids, and permeability of ion channels...|$|R

These treatment technologies are being evaluated in pilot scale laboratory systems by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency's National Risk Management Research Laboratory in Cincinnati, Ohio. To evaluate the genotoxicity and identify the mutagens in the soil {{before and after the}} various treatments, fractionated extracts of five soils were bioassayed for mutagenic activity with a microsuspension modification of the Salmonella <b>histidine</b> <b>reversion</b> assay. Soils were extracted by sonication using dichloromethane (DCM). The five extracts were fractionated in triplicate (two for bioassay and one for chemical analysis) by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using hexane/DCM/methanol, and the fraction for bioassay were solvent-exchanged into dimethyl sulfoxide by nitrogen evaporation. Forty HPLC fractions for each sample were bioassayed in strain YG 1041 with and without exogenous liver metabolic activation. As shown in a companion paper, the mutagenicity of two treatments (BS and BP) was significantly greater than the mutagenicity of the untreated soil. Mutagenic fractions (> 500 revertants) were analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). PAH analysis of the soils indicated that all treatments were effective in reducing the total PAH concentration (48 - 74 %). Qualitative GC/MS analysis of the mutagenic fractions from the BS and BP treatments indicated that they contained azaarenes, which are mutagens. The CMP and LT processes were the most effective and least toxic bioremediation procedures based on mutagenic potency and chemical analysis. This research demonstrated that the combination of bioassays and chemical analysis provided a more accurate determination of toxicity in these complex environmental mixtures...|$|R
40|$|A novel mutator locus in Escherichia coli was {{identified}} from {{a collection of}} random transposon insertion mutants. Several mutators in this collection {{were found to have}} an insertion in the dgt gene, encoding a previously characterized dGTP triphosphohydrolase. The mutator activity of the dgt mutants displays an unusual specificity. Among the six possible base pair substitutions in a lacZ <b>reversion</b> <b>system,</b> the G·C→C·G transversion and A·T→G·C transition are strongly enhanced (10 - to 50 -fold), while a modest effect (two- to threefold) is also observed for the G·C→A·T transition. Interestingly, a two- to threefold reduction in mutant frequency (antimutator effect) is observed for the G·C→T·A transversion. In the absence of DNA mismatch repair (mutL) some of these effects are reduced or abolished, while other effects remain unchanged. Analysis of these effects, combined with the DNA sequence contexts in which the reversions take place, suggests that alterations of the dGTP pools as well as alterations in the level of some modified dNTP derivatives could affect the fidelity of in vivo DNA replication and, hence, account for the overall mutator effects...|$|R

Results revealed that a strain deficient in MutSL showed a significant propensity to generate increased numbers of stationary-phase-induced revertants. These results suggest that absence or depression of MMR {{is an important factor in}} the mutagenesis of nongrowing B. subtilis cells because of the role of MMR in repairing DNA damage. In agreement with this suggestion, a significant decrease in the number of adaptive revertant colonies, for the three markers tested, occurred in B. subtilis cells which overexpressed a component of the MMR system. Interestingly, the single overexpression of mutS, but not of mutL, was sufficient to decrease the level of adaptive mutants in the <b>reversion</b> assay <b>system</b> of B. subtilis.

DNA polymerase lambda contains all the critical residues involved in DNA binding, nucleotide binding, nucleotide selection, and catalysis of DNA polymerization and has been assigned to family X based on sequence homology with polymerase beta, lambda, mu, and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase. Here we describe a purification of DNA polymerase lambda from calf thymus that preferentially can replicate damaged DNA. By testing polymerase activity on non-damaged and damaged DNA, DNA polymerase lambda was purified trough five chromatographic steps to near homogeneity and identified as a 67 -kDa polypeptide that cross-reacted with monoclonal antibodies against DNA polymerase beta and polyclonal antibodies against DNA polymerase lambda. DNA polymerase lambda had no detectable nuclease activities and, in contrast to DNA polymerase beta, was aphidicolin-sensitive.

40|$|We showed {{previously}} that transcription in Escherichia coli promotes C[*]·[*]G-to-T[*]·[*]A transitions due {{to increased}} deamination of cytosines to uracils in the nontranscribed but not the transcribed strand (A. Beletskii and A. S. Bhagwat, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93 : 13919 - 13924, 1996). To study mutations other than that of C to T, we developed a new genetic assay that selects only base substitution mutations and additionally excludes C[*]·[*]G to T[*]·[*]A transitions. This novel genetic <b>reversion</b> <b>system</b> is based on mutations in a termination codon and involves positive selection for resistance to bleomycin or kanamycin. Using this genetic system, we show here that transcription from a strong promoter increases the level of non-C-to-T as well as C-to-T mutations. We find that high-level transcription increases the level of non-C-to-T mutations in DNA repair-proficient cells in three different sequence contexts in two genes and {{that the rate of}} mutation is higher by a factor of 2 to 4 under these conditions. These increases are not caused by a growth advantage for the revertants and are restricted to genes that are induced for transcription. In particular, high levels of transcription do not create a general mutator phenotype in E. coli. Sequence analysis of the revertants revealed that the frequency of several different base substitutions increased upon transcription of the bleomycin resistance gene and that G[*]·[*]C-to-T[*]·[*]A transversions dominated the spectrum in cells transcribing the gene. These results suggest that high levels of transcription promote many different spontaneous base substitutions in E. coli...|$|R

In growing bacteria, 8 -oxoguanine-adenine mispairs persist and can {{give rise to}} G [...] >T transversions during subsequent replication cycles. We now show that when trpA 23 mutY bacteria are held under tryptophan starvation conditions the tryptophan-independent mutants that arise include small in-frame deletions in addition to transversions. The trpA 23 <b>reversion</b> <b>system</b> appears to be unusual in that small in-frame deletions occurring in a particular region of the gene {{can lead to the}} production of a functional protein. We suggest that this is a consequence of the deletion causing the polar group on the arginine at the trpA 23 site to be pulled away from the active site of the enzyme. Such deletions are also found with starved bacteria defective in methyl-directed mismatch correction activity (mutH, mutL or mutS), and deletion mutations are also found among the much lower number of mutants that arise in bacteria wild-type for mismatch correction. There is thus a pathway, hitherto undetected, leading to deletions probably from mismatches under conditions of growth restraint. RecA, UmuC, UvrA, MutH,L,S, SbcC and SbcD proteins are not required for the operation of the deletion pathway. A possible explanation is that the deletion pathway is not dependent upon further replication and that it fails to be discernible in growing cells because it is relatively slow acting and mismatches are likely to encounter a DNA replication fork before the initial step of the deletion pathway...|$|R

For very low UV doses, both mutational systems exhibit linear induction kinetics. However, as the dose increases, a strikingly different response is observed: in the selective <b>reversion</b> <b>system</b> a transition to higher order induction kinetics occurs near 9 ergs/mm 2 (25 % survival), whereas in the nonselective forward system the mutation frequency passes through a maximum near 14 ergs/mm 2 (4. 4 % survival) and then declines. This contrast in kinetics cannot be explained in any straightforward way by current models of induced mutagenesis, which have been developed primarily {{on the basis of}} bacterial data. The bacterial models are designed to accommodate the quadratic induction kinetics that are frequently observed in these systems. We have derived a mathematical expression for mutation frequency that enables us to fit both the forward and reversion data on the assumptions that mutagenesis is basically a "single event" Poisson process, and that mutation and killing are not necessarily independent of one another. In particular, the dose-response relations are consistent with the idea that the sensitivity of the revertants is about 25 % less than that of the original cell population, whereas the sensitivity of the forward mutants is about 29 % greater than the population average. We argue that this relatively small differential sensitivity of mutant and nonmutant cells is associated with events that take place during mutation expression and clonal growth...|$|R

Genetic analysis demonstrates that the dominant small eye phenotype {{is the result of}} separate gain-of-function mutations in the closely linked muscle segment homeobox (msh) gene, encoding a homeodomain transcription factor required for patterning of muscle and nervous <b>system.</b> <b>Reversion</b> of the DrMio allele was coincident with the generation of lethal loss-of-function mutations inmsh in cis, suggesting that the dominant eye phenotype is the result of ectopic expression. Molecular genetic analysis revealed that two dominant Dr alleles contain lesions upstream of the msh transcription start site. In the DrMio mutant, a 3 S 18 retrotransposon insertion is the target of second-site mutations (P-element insertions or deletions) which suppress the dominant eye phenotype following reversion. The pattern of 3 S 18 expression and the absence of msh in eye imaginal discs suggest that transcriptional activation of the msh promoter accounts for ectopic expression. Dr dominant mutations arrest eye development by blocking the progression of the morphogenetic furrow leading to photoreceptor cell loss via apoptosis. Gal 4 -mediated ubiquitous expression of msh in third-instar larvae was sufficient to arrest the morphogenetic furrow in the eye imaginal disc and resulted in lethality prior to eclosion. Dominant mutations in the human msx 2 gene, one of the vertebrate homologs of msh, are associated with craniosynostosis, a disease affecting cranial development. The Dr mutations are the first example of gain-of-function mutations in the msh/msx gene family identified in a genetically tractible model organism and may serve as a useful tool to identify additional genes that regulate this class of homeodomain proteins...|$|R

40|$|When {{assessing}} {{values of}} petroleum projects, a key parameter is {{the oil price}} at which the extracted petroleum can be sold at. Many companies use a corporate planning price in their calculations. This price is more often estimated by a fixed price model than a more realistic model. History {{has shown that the}} oil price for the past forty years has been anything but stable and is constantly reacting to many different factors, such as war, politic upheavals, speculation and also to industry occurrences such as refinery constraints, oil spills, and discoveries. Consequently all of these events influence the balance in supply and demand, where the imbalance and future outlook is reflected in the price of oil. The choice of using a fixed price level to value projects, fails to embrace the volatility and uncertainty in the oil price and will subsequent lead too poor project evaluation as these features are not reflected in a projects value. The work in this thesis has been to investigate and compare the behaviour and the uncertainty of four price models which offer different levels of detail and complexity; Fixed Price, Geometric Brownian Motion, Mean <b>Reversion</b> and a <b>System</b> Thinking approach. Using system thinking has not yet been popularized in price modelling. Much effort has therefore gone into establish and refine this model as the level of complexity and detail in this approach requires a reasonable amount of data and understanding. To compare and evaluate how the models impact project economics, three realistic petroleum projects with different attributes were selected to perform analysis on; Knarr (Norway), Tawke (Kurdistan); Tiber (USA). The selected price models, all but one, show to contribute to over 50 % of the total uncertainty in a projects value. As a consequence, a price model used in project economics should therefore have uncertainty associated to it in order to reflect the possible values different price scenarios could impose in a project. Two of the models are chosen as recommended models from this thesis work; The Mean Reversion (MR) model and the System Thinking (ST) approach. The Mean Reversion model used here offers a larger uncertainty range, but fails to embrace an increasing trend in the price. The System Thinking Model shows an increasing trend and has a reasonable uncertainty range; however it fails to embrace lower price levels. The uncertainty in price models is highly influential to the valuation of projects. It is therefore vital to implement a realistic price model with uncertainty when assessing projects. The choice of model should be approached with respect to historic data and attuned for present and future outlook...|$|R
