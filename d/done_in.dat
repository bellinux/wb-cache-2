5|$|Bicycle kicks are {{generally}} <b>done</b> <b>in</b> two situations, one defensive {{and the other}} offensive. A defensive bicycle kick is done when a player facing his side's goal uses the action to clear {{the ball in the}} direction opposite his side's goalmouth. Sports historian Richard Witzig considers defensive bicycle kicks a desperate move requiring less aim than its offensive variety. An offensive bicycle kick is used when a player has his back to the opposing goal and is near the goalmouth. According to Witzig, the offensive bicycle kick requires concentration and a good understanding of the ball's location. Bicycle kicks can also be <b>done</b> <b>in</b> the midfield, but this is not recommended because safer and more accurate passes can be <b>done</b> <b>in</b> this zone.|$|E
