5|$|A {{grant of}} £650,000 funded the {{construction}} of a technology centre with a computer suite, which opened in January 1993. Plans for a new sports hall were first discussed in 1990, but they only came to fruition in 1996, when Northgate Sports Hall opened. The Sports Council and the Foundation for Sport and the Arts donated £250,000 towards its construction; this was matched by North Kesteven District Council, while Carre's raised £50,000 towards the building work. An all-weather pitch at the school opened in 2007; it cost £649,000 to lay, half of which was met by the Football Foundation. A building programme costing £835,000 provided the school with <b>food</b> <b>technology</b> facilities and a two-storey Fitness Suite, which were opened in March 2011.|$|E
5|$|A {{committee}} {{appointed by}} the Prime Minister, Robert Menzies, and chaired by Keith Murray, recommended in 1957 that a medical school be established at Kensington. Its creation, followed by that of a Faculty of Arts, prompted the university to change {{its name to the}} University of New South Wales (UNSW) in 1958. Baxter established a number of unusual schools. He created a School of Nuclear Engineering in anticipation that a nuclear power industry would be established in Australia. He also created schools of Textile Technology, Wool Technology, <b>Food</b> <b>Technology</b> and Highway Engineering and Traffic Engineering. The School of Business Administration and an Institute of Administration was established in 1960, and ultimately the Australian Graduate School of Management in 1969. When the Faculty of Arts was created, he insisted that all Arts students take at least one science subject.|$|E

The Board of Studies requires stage 6 students to study a minimum of 12units in the Preliminary Year and 10units in their HSC Year (most subjects being worth 2units). HSC English is compulsory; Standard and Advanced Extension courses, as well as 2-unit English as a Second Language are also offered. Students may then choose from all levels of Mathematics, Senior Science, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Modern History, Ancient History, Business Studies, Economics, Geography, Legal studies, French, German, Latin, Japanese, Italian, Indonesian (Beginners), Mandarin, Design and Technology, Textiles and Design, <b>Food</b> <b>Technology,</b> Visual Arts, Music (Course 1 and 2), Drama and PDHPE.|$|E

All primary schools have at least four computers, one printer, a large monitor and a teacher's laptop computer in their classrooms, while many secondary schools have specialised rooms necessary to teach subjects such as Home Economics and <b>Food</b> <b>Technology.</b> An average of 22.5 students are enrolled per primary school class, with the average rising to 24.3 in secondary school classes. Primary school teachers are expected to dedicate five hours per week to each of Maltese, English and mathematics, one hour per week to science, two hours per weeks to arts and crafts, two hours per week to social studies, one hour and 15 minutes per week to social studies, and {{two and a half hours}} per week to physical education and religion.

5|$|After the fortress's {{military}} importance decreased {{at the end}} of the 19th century, Tvrđa {{became a}} center of administrative, educational, cultural, and scholarly life in Osijek and the entire region. The first school in Osijek was organized at Tvrđa; the first scholarly curriculum was introduced in 1707, to be later expanded and renewed, and the first printing press started working in 1735. The significance of educational institutions of Tvrđa are best underlined by the fact that Croatian Nobel Prize laureates, Lavoslav Ružička and Vladimir Prelog, along with Serbian scientist Milutin Milanković (Milankovitch cycles), were all alumni (graduates) of the Tvrđa schools. The Faculty of Agriculture of the Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek has occupied the former general headquarters since 1995 after its previous site was destroyed in the Croatian War of Independence. The Faculty of <b>Food</b> <b>Technology</b> has been relocated to a building that served as the first military hospital in Osijek, from the mid-17th century until the beginning of the 1990s. Other present-day educational institutions in Tvrđa include the II and the III Gymnasium, Franjo Kuhač Music School (former Roman Catholic Seminary), Jesuit Classical Gymnasium (former logistics barracks built in the mid-18th century), and the Secondary School of Economics (former grammar school for girls).|$|E
5|$|In Key Stage 4 (Years 10 and 11), pupils study a core {{curriculum}} comprising English, mathematics, science, PE, RE and citizenship. They {{are required to}} take GCSEs in English, mathematics and science, alongside two option blocks, plus either a modern foreign language or a vocational course. English Language is taught in Year 10 and Literature the following year. Mathematics in taken by all pupils; they may opt-in for a GCSE in Statistics in Year 10, and the most able pupils may take Further Maths at GCSE in Year 11. Science courses are based on ability; pupils may study for three separate science qualifications, a dual or single award in Science or BTEC Applied Science. pupils may choose a modern foreign language (French, Spanish or German), a humanity (history or geography), computing or separate sciences (biology, chemistry and physics) for their options as part of the English Baccalaureate. Additionally, the school offers six technology courses at GCSE (electronics, <b>food</b> <b>technology,</b> graphics, product design, resistant materials and textiles), as well as art and design, drama, music, PE, RE and child development GCSE qualifications. Vocational courses are also offered at Level 2, including applied business, construction, engineering, health and social care, ICT, music, performing arts, and travel and tourism.

5000|$|In the past, {{consumer}} attitude towards <b>food</b> <b>technologies</b> was not common talk {{and was not}} important in food development. Nowadays the food chain is long and complicated, <b>foods</b> and <b>food</b> <b>technologies</b> are diverse; consequently the consumers are uncertain about the food quality and safety and {{find it difficult to}} orient themselves to the subject. That is why consumer acceptance of <b>food</b> <b>technologies</b> is an important question. However, in these days acceptance of food products very often depends on potential benefits and risks associated with the food. This also includes the <b>technology</b> the <b>food</b> is processed with. Attributes like “uncertain”, “unknown” or “unfamiliar” are associated with consumers’ risk perception and consumer very likely will reject products linked to these attributes. Especially innovative <b>food</b> processing <b>technologies</b> are connected to these characteristics and are perceived as risky by consumers [...] Acceptance of the different <b>food</b> <b>technologies</b> is very different. Whereas pasteurisation is well recognised, high pressure treatment or even microwaves are perceived as risky very often. In studies done within Hightech Europe project, it was found that traditional technologies were well accepted in contrast to innovative technologies.|$|R

30|$|The {{high levels}} of {{uncertainty}} and scarce perception of tangible benefits may generate in consumers the idea that new <b>food</b> <b>technologies</b> are superfluous. This is condensed in the second factor (12.2 % of total variance) which captures {{the opinion of the}} interviewees as regards the usefulness of adopting new <b>food</b> <b>technologies,</b> and in general captures the level of uncertainty connected to them (perception of futility of technologies). When it takes on positive values, the second component identifies consumers who do not recognise a real benefit in the introduction of new <b>technologies</b> in <b>food</b> production. This approach is further reinforced by the feeling of uncertainty which goes with it (“New <b>food</b> <b>technologies</b> are something I'm unsure about”) (Hansen et al. 2003; Frewer and Salter 2003). By contrast, negative values of the component are linked to the recognition by the interviewees that new technologies actually bring about a benefit in terms of health, food taste and quality.|$|R
