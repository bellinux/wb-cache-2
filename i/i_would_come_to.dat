But I did {{recognize}} the impact because acts were going all over the world at that time. I recognized the bridges that we crossed, the racial problems and the barriers that we broke down with music. I recognized that because I lived it. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> the South {{in the early days of}} Motown and the audiences would be segregated. Then they started to get the Motown music and we would go back and the audiences were integrated and the kids were dancing together and holding hands.|$|E
500|$|The 2012 Summer Games marked Sherab Zam's Olympic debut. She was {{the flag}} bearer {{at both the}} opening and closing ceremonies. She {{qualified}} for the individual archery competition after receiving a wildcard from the Tripartite Commission. In an interview with Reuters before the games Zam said that [...] "Participation {{is more important than}} winning a medal." [...] Zam spent time in South Korea and India preparing for the games. The archery events at the 2012 games were held at the Lord's Cricket Ground. Zam competed on 27 July in the ranking round, finishing 61st out of 64 competitors with 589 points. She scored 82 points less than the leading competitor, Ki Bo-bae of South Korea. Zam competed against American Khatuna Lorig, the fourth ranking athlete in the ranking round, in the round of 64. Lorig beat Zam three sets to none in about six minutes. This meant Zam was eliminated from the competition. After the games Zam said: [...] "I am not that good at archery but I love it. It was so good to meet world ranking archers who are famous and to watch how they do it. I have learnt a lot from them," [...] and that, [...] "When I grew up I never dreamt <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> London, let alone compete in an Olympics. This just shows that anything is possible. The Olympics is great for that." ...|$|E

5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>would</b> sooner <b>come</b> <b>to</b> a {{decision}} and be wrong, than vacillate.|$|R
5000|$|In 1999, she toured India doing a five city tour. From Goa, she said: [...] "I {{never thought}} <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> back <b>to</b> India." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! I'm {{so glad to}} {{hear that}} he's much better, and been out too! <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have <b>come</b> <b>to</b> see him again long long ago, but p--" ...|$|R
6000|$|IGNOR. Do {{you think}} that I am such a fool as to think God can see no further than I? or, that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> God {{in the best of}} my performances? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{really believe}} Gladys {{was in the}} right when she said <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> like you almost as much as if you were a cat. Do you want a saucer of milk?" ...|$|E
6000|$|But she {{had quite}} fallen away again. [...] "I {{remember}} {{the moment you}} mean--it was when I said <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> you here. But why should it have struck you as a crisis?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was very}} kind of you," [...] John said. [...] "If I had known that you cared about seeing me, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have <b>come</b> <b>to</b> you with pleasure." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{moved slowly}} along the road, and Acton went with her. Presently he said, [...] "If I had done as <b>I</b> liked <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have <b>come</b> <b>to</b> see you several times." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then, {{say to my}} uncle," [...] {{answered}} Damian, [...] "I am a prisoner, or <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have <b>come</b> <b>to</b> him--I am a confiscated beggar, or <b>I</b> <b>would</b> {{have sent}} him my all." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{said that}} I {{would get him}} the file, and I would get him what broken bits of food I could, and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> him at the Battery, early in the morning.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's it!" [...] cried Nanny {{with sudden}} passion. [...] "Na, na; I'll {{be a woman}} on the poor's rates. Oh, mither, mither, you little thocht when you bore me that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> this!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Would {{you mind}} telling him," [...] Mary asked, [...] "that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> {{see him at}} once, but my father is holding my hand so tight that I could not draw it away without rousing him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I will. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> never <b>come</b> <b>to</b> see you again, even if I had the {{strength}} <b>to</b> <b>come,</b> which I shall not have any more. Sue, Sue, you are not worth a man's love!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] replied Peter, [...] "but {{there are}} {{lots and lots of}} things <b>I</b> <b>would</b> like to know about other people. If you please, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> like <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> school to you every day. You see, the more I learn about my neighbors, the better able I will be to take care of myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> myself <b>to</b> see if {{you were}} taking my money on false pretences? No, I dare say not. You fool!" [...] she blazed, turning {{suddenly}} upon Tom Spring. [...] "You'll be beat. That will {{be the end of}} it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, sir. My {{mother was}} ill {{and went into}} an infirmary, and so as I was alone I thought <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> London {{and try to get}} the sort of work I liked; but I have tried almost all over London." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Mrs. Thompson: {{some four}} years ago I was at Ramsgate, and when there I struck up a great {{acquaintance}} with your mother. She gave me your address, and I said that if ever I came to London <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> you. Do you still let lodgings, and are they vacant?" ...|$|E
60|$|The Saviour {{turns them}} off, the Saviour throws them down. He hath given him {{authority}} to execute judgment also, {{because he is}} the Son of man (John 5:27). Depart from me: <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> have done you good; but then you would not. Now then, though you would have it never so willingly, yet you shall not.|$|E
60|$|It was {{possible}} that I might convey from one vessel to the other some articles of luxury or necessity, but on this point <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>come</b> <b>to</b> any definite conclusion. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> consult Mary Phillips on the subject.|$|R
60|$|GERALD. Well, I don't {{care what}} happens. <b>I</b> wish things <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> a head. <b>I</b> only fear they won't.|$|R
6000|$|... "Both {{father and}} mother will consent. There need be no {{hindrance}} if Nina will agree. I {{did not know that}} you were so badly off. I did not indeed, or <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have <b>come</b> <b>to</b> you myself and seen to it." ...|$|R
60|$|Having {{written to}} Joe, {{to offer him}} consolation, and to assure him that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> the funeral, I passed the {{intermediate}} days in the curious state of mind I have glanced at. I went down early in the morning, and alighted at the Blue Boar in good time to {{walk over to the}} forge.|$|E
6000|$|... "Marie--Marie Bouchet. My {{husband is}} a fishmonger, or was, until one of those crusading priests got hold of him and took him off to kill Paynims and save his soul, much against my will. Well, I promised {{him that if he}} did not return in five years <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> look for him. So here I am, but where he may be is another matter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And when I was so ill-treated in Kingsbury Crescent I thought <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> you. It {{could not}} be right that a gentleman making an honourable proposition,--and very liberal, as you must acknowledge,--should {{not be allowed to}} see the young lady. It was not as though I did not know her. I had been ten days in the same house with her. Don't you think, Sir Thomas, I ought to have been allowed to see her?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{it is full}} noon. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have <b>come</b> <b>to</b> you before; but was on your business, and {{believed}} you could content yourselves, even in this poor place, knowing that your work was being forwarded. Are you suffering for food?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I shan't {{want you}} at all, George. I {{told you so}} yesterday. However, after breakfast I will {{walk over to the}} farm with you. I only had time for a word with your father yesterday, but I told him that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> over <b>to</b> see them {{sometime}} today." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I did, Hilda--and I {{wondered}} at {{you more than}} ever as I read it. But if you KNEW <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>come,</b> why write <b>to</b> prevent me?" ...|$|R
60|$|The next day, {{which was}} Sunday, a {{telegram}} came for me, which I decided, without opening it, {{to be the}} announcement of the end. But it proved to be a message from Mrs. Bentley, begging in most urgent terms that Mrs. March and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> her at once, if possible. These terms left the widest latitude for surmise, but none for choice, in the sad circumstances, and we looked up the Sunday trains for Gormanville, and went.|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't quite tell you; {{but your}} father in his {{delirium}} muttered some words {{which made me}} suspect the truth, and a sailor who could speak a little bad French said that the Trondhjem was lost upon some rocks. Well, these are the only rocks about here; and as the whole story was too vague to carry to the lifeboat people I thought that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> look. So you see it is perfectly simple." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, of course," [...] said La Fleur, {{with her}} head on one side, and her smile at its angle of humility, [...] "I meant that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> her when she is settled here as Mrs. Haverley, and her dear mother is living with her, and when Miss Miriam has gone to finish her {{education}} at whatever seminary is decided on. Then this house will seem like my true home, and begging your pardon, madam, you cannot imagine how happy I am going to be." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hardly remember. I {{told her}} what <b>I</b> thought <b>would</b> please her. I've been in Florence a week. <b>I</b> hoped you <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> see me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Papa! papa! I know you! <b>I</b> {{knew you}} <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> me! Oh, papa, don't go away again! Crazy Jim {{said you were}} dead! Oh, papa!" ...|$|R
60|$|Before leaving I said <b>to</b> Jacobus that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> {{next day}} <b>to</b> hear if the bag affair had made any progress. He {{shook his head}} {{slightly}} at that.|$|R
