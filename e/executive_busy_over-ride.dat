40|$|The {{traditional}} {{calculation of}} dilepton yields from bremsstrahlung {{relies on the}} assumption that electromagnetic and strong processes factorize. We argue that this assumption, embodied by the soft photon approximation, cannot hold true for invariant mass spectra on very general grounds. Deriving a formula for the dilepton cross section for pion-pion scattering that does not rely on such factorization, we formulate the problem exactly in terms of three-particle phase space invariants. Using a simple one boson exchange model for comparison, we find that dilepton cross sections and yields are generally overestimated by the soft photon approximation by factors 2 [...] 8. In extreme cases, overestimation up to a factor 40 is possible. Comment: Conference version for <b>Busy</b> <b>Executives</b> with no interest in detail.

The purpose of the conspiracy is to forestall a run on the dollar by other central banks and foreign exchange speculators. If my assumption about the existence of this conspiracy is correct, then the end-game of the regime of irredeemable currencies will be stretched out by another decade or so.

40|$|Officers {{of large}} corporations, having {{demonstrated}} expertise in managing complex organizations, {{would appear to}} be ideal additions to the boards of directors of other corporations. Shareholder wealth effects are examined for 124 announcements in which an officer of one public corporation joins {{the board of directors of}} another. The results indicate that the values of nonfinancial firms that send directors to other firms decline significantly, while those of financial senders increase significantly. Receiving firms of both types do not gain. The results suggest that for nonfinancial firms the added duties of an outside directorship distract corporate officers from managing their own firms or are signals to the market that managers are available to other firms. For financial senders, the benefits of networking appear to strongly outweigh any drawbacks. Cross-sectional regressions suggest that prediction errors are higher for receiving firms if they have performed poorly prior to the announcement and less negative for sending firms if they have performed well prior to the announcement. Abnormal returns are negatively related to the size of the sender, adding support for the notion that <b>busy</b> <b>executives</b> are less valuable as outside directors. ...|$|R

40|$|Summary for the <b>busy</b> <b>executive</b> Labor vitally {{depends on}} the state of {{industrial}} capital. Wage rates cannot increase except in consequence of an increase in the per capita quota of invested capital. Conversely, a decrease in that quota means capital decumulation that lowers wage rates, ultimately leading to unemployment. The regime of fiat currency has destabilized the interest-rate structure with the result that bond speculators can siphon off capital from the balance sheet of productive enterprise surreptitiously. There are laws against computer-hacking. There are no laws against hackers entering the balance sheet of industrial enterprise surreptitiously, and making off with illicit gains through risk-free profits in bond speculation. The resulting insufficiency hurts labor even more than it hurts capital. Owners of capital can protect themselves through exporting their remaining funds to low-wage countries. The trouble is that well-paid industrial jobs are exported along with capital, never to return. American labor is stuck with low-paid service jobs such as flipping hamburgers. The outlook is even bleaker. As interest rates keep falling, even hamburger-flipping may go the way of steel-making. Mass unemployment, directly attributable to fiat currency destabilizing the interest-rate structure, is a real threat...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{addresses}} {{the question of}} whether independent directors of the bidding firm are effective monitors during acquisitions and whether this effectiveness is impaired when the independent directors serve on multiple boards. The choice of the acquisition setting, where the board of directors is known to be engaged in active decision-making, facilitates a direct test of the role of independent directors as effective, external monitors of the board’s activities. We employ three indicators of the bidding board’s performance in making optimal acquisition decisions: the acquisition premium (benchmarked against subsequent performance), a new indicator comprising the conflicts of interest associated with the acquisitions (conflicted acquisitions), and the post-acquisition stock performance. The results suggest that more independent boards and busy independent directors on the bidding firm’s board are associated with more effective acquisition decisions by the board. However, busy independent directors are associated with less effective acquisition decisions when the bidding firm has higher free cash flows consistent with Jensen (1986). We also find that <b>busy</b> <b>executive</b> directors on the bidding firm’s board have no implications for the effectiveness of acquisition decisions unless the director is a busy chairperson or busy CEO both of whom are associated with less effective acquisition decisions. This paper contributes direct evidence on the effectiveness of bidding firm independent directors in their role as monitors and decision-makers...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Many {{organisational}} gurus {{highlight the}} value of oral narrative or storytelling {{as a catalyst for}} organisational change or a way to share knowledge. Tomes of articles describe seasoned raconteurs single handedly inciting enormous transformation in organisations. Oxymoronically many written works are describing the power of oral narrative. Surely these printed exposés are themselves motivators for change; so why the continued emphasis on the face-to-face storytelling? There is no disputing the fact that oral narrative is a powerful form of communicating; however, it is not always feasible. In fact, there are times when the written word packs a more powerful punch. Often it is simply not possible to catch the ear of a wide audience simultaneously, or even at all. Many people simply will not take time from their busy schedules to listen to stories. <b>Busy</b> <b>executives</b> seem to prefer the written word to the spoken. In these cases, the power of the pen offers a persuasive substitute. This is a tale about such stories in action, each of which seemed to sow the seed of change. Of course, time will be the real test; however, anecdotal evidence seems to support the proposition that well-written futuristic stories provide an excellent alternative to face-to-face oral narrative. At least in these examples, the written story proved to be a motivator for organisational change and an effective way to share knowledge. This paper is about the use of narrative to share knowledge; it is part tutorial and part theory. Building on the foundational knowledge developed by Denning, Snowden, Prusak, and others this paper describes the “how to ” of effective storytelling to create and share knowledge within organisations...|$|R
40|$|In an ever {{smaller and}} {{connected}} world, {{the need for}} instant access and communication {{is becoming more and}} more necessary.

This is why they have decided to develop a mobile application specially catered to serve <b>busy</b> <b>executives</b> of innovative manufacturing companies, and help them find the right business partners for their next business venture or innovative collaboration. This thesis was written on the behalf of the Global Success Club to help them determine the optimal way to develop a mobile application that aims to connect innovative manufacturing companies in a global setting by looking at two research questions: 1. How to win B 2 B users/customers for a mobile application by focusing on smart user interface; and 2. Which method of marketing communication, direct marketing (emails & follow-up calls) or social media marketing, is more successful in winning over users in the internet affinitive US market. This paper will accomplish its task by first looking over past research done by authors and researchers about how mobile applications are changing the way of the world and the way we communicate. The paper will also explore why businesses are now deciding to adopt new technologies to help them with business processes that were traditionally done offline. In order to answer the questions posed by this thesis, research was conducted on previous studies and what they have suggested pertaining to the research questions. Based on the research, hypotheses were made and those ideas implemented into the final plans by the company for the design and marketing communication strategy. Conclusions were made about the most effective user interface designs based on the hypotheses, and a study will be carried out at a later to judge their effectiveness. A study on the marketing strategy taken by the company was able to show that a more direct marketing message is optimal to win users and would be more effective if combined with wide spread and cost-effective online marketing. ...|$|R
