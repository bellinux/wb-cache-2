500|$|On April 5, 2010, Entertainment Weekly {{reported}} that Dirty Sexy Money actor Seth Gabel had been {{cast as the}} lead Fringe investigator in the parallel universe, and would be making his first appearance in the finale as a possible recurring character. Jeff Pinkner described the character as [...] "the scientist-cop-leader of the team on the Other Side." [...] In an interview with TV Guide, Gabel commented that during shooting {{he felt that he}} looked [...] "like such a doofus holding a gun," [...] but changed his mind when he saw the finished production. Gabel elaborated, [...] "I was so scared that I wouldn't pull it off. Once <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>myself</b> being a scientist-slash-FBI hero, I felt more confident and relaxed." [...] His character is caught in a large explosion in the finale, but Gabel confirmed, in a Chicago Tribune interview, that his character would be returning for the third season. He states that the parallel universe has [...] "special technology than can heal burns".|$|E
500|$|During her childhood, Madonna was {{inspired}} by actors, later saying, [...] "I loved Carole Lombard and Judy Holliday and Marilyn Monroe. They were all incredibly funny... and <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>myself</b> in them... my girlishness, my knowingness and my innocence." [...] Her [...] "Material Girl" [...] music video recreated Monroe's look in the song [...] "Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend", from the film Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953). She studied the screwball comedies of the 1930s, particularly those of Lombard, {{in preparation for the}} film Who's That Girl. The video for [...] "Express Yourself" [...] (1989) {{was inspired}} by Fritz Lang's silent film Metropolis (1927). The video for [...] "Vogue" [...] recreated the style of Hollywood glamour photographs, in particular those by Horst P. Horst, and imitated the poses of Marlene Dietrich, Carole Lombard, and Rita Hayworth, while the lyrics referred to many of the stars who had inspired her, including Bette Davis, described by Madonna as an idol. However, Madonna's film career has been largely received negatively by the film critic community. Stephanie Zacharek, critic for Time magazine, stated that, [...] " [...] seems wooden and unnatural as an actress, and it's tough to watch, because she's clearly trying her damnedest." [...] According to biographer Andrew Morton, [...] "Madonna puts a brave face on the criticism, but privately she is deeply hurt." [...] After the box office bomb Swept Away (2002), Madonna vowed that she would never again act in a film, hoping her repertoire as a bad actress would never be discussed again. In 2016, a career retrospective titled Body of Work was shown at New York's Metrograph hall, to [...] "showcase Madonna's calculated, cohesive canon" [...] according to The Guardians Nigel M Smith. He also explained in an article for the newspaper that the singer's film career suffered mostly due to lack of proper material supplied to her, and given a chance [...] " [...] could steal a scene for all the right reasons".|$|E
2500|$|Cartwright said, [...] "When I was younger, <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>myself</b> as a batting all-rounder, {{and then}} I started {{taking a few}} wickets and people started saying, ‘’Oh you’re a bowling all-rounder’’ because I was out of form with my batting. So it was quite hard {{to try to keep}} the idea of myself as a batting all-rounder in my own mind." ...|$|E

60|$|He took me down {{lower on}} the shore, and <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> for <b>myself</b> that his {{footsteps}} and mine were the only footsteps printed off on the sand.|$|R

2500|$|... "The worst moment – {{not just}} of my {{adolescence}} but of my life – was the day they took off the bandages and <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>myself</b> in the mirror. I cried for hours ... It made me very unsettled. It really mucked me around badly, not {{to the point of}} being psychiatrically impaired but it did me a lot of harm in terms of stability and the capacity to concentrate." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lansman {{was brought}} up in an Orthodox Jewish family in Southgate, north London. He was a pupil at the {{independent}} Highgate School from 1970 to 1975. [...] He first visited Israel when he was 16: [...] "I worked on a kibbutz in the Negev and my aunt lived in Beersheba. [...] It was actually a very politicising experience. When I did my bar mitzvah <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>myself</b> as a Zionist and I think after I went there I felt it less. [...] I was more interested in the kibbutz and what I liked about it was the pioneering spirit, the sense of community and radicalism of it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Japanese {{had their}} own files on Sukarno and the Japanese {{commander}} in Sumatra approached him with respect, wanting to use him to organise and pacify the Indonesians. Sukarno {{on the other hand}} wanted to use the Japanese to gain independence for Indonesia: [...] "The Lord be praised, God showed me the way; in that valley of the Ngarai I said: Yes, Independent Indonesia can only be achieved with Dai Nippon...For the first time in all my life, <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>myself</b> in the mirror of Asia." [...] In July 1942, Sukarno was sent back to Jakarta, where he re-united with other nationalist leaders recently released by the Japanese, including Mohammad Hatta. There, he met the Japanese commander General Hitoshi Imamura, who asked Sukarno and other nationalists to galvanise support from Indonesian populace to aid Japanese war effort.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no, Mr. Archfield," [...] pleaded Anne, [...] "that was impossible; <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> him <b>myself.</b> He {{was with}} that sailor-looking man {{measuring}} {{the height of}} the secretary bird." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't deny it, sir," [...] roared the Doctor. [...] "Don't add lies, sir, to {{your other}} infamy. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> you <b>myself,</b> sir. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> {{you from the}} Dean's garden. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> you kissing the hand of that infernal painted---" ...|$|R

2500|$|The lyrical {{themes of}} Currents centre on {{personal}} transition and growing older. Parker's lyrics {{on the album}} are entirely autobiographical. His vocals are clearer and less affected than in prior Tame Impala releases, which is partially owed to him having more pride in his lyrics; he said he {{hoped it would be}} easy for listeners to understand them. Parker considered the primary theme of the album to be a [...] "deep feeling of transition in your psyche," [...] or, in a broad sense, fully entering adulthood. He began learning about the concept of the Saturn return halfway through the recording process, which explained his feelings of reflection. He said, [...] "I was halfway through making the album when I heard about it, and it gave what I was doing a lot more meaning; suddenly things made a lot more sense." [...] Accordingly, on the album his reaction to transition is acceptance, exemplified by the opening song, [...] "Let It Happen". Parker also felt buying the home where he recorded Currents [...] "really changed my perspective about where <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>myself,</b> like a place that I belonged." ...|$|E
60|$|Gazing up {{into the}} {{darkness}} <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>myself</b> as a creature driven and derided by vanity; and my eyes burned with anguish and anger.|$|E
6000|$|Then, as it were, {{within me}} [...] Something snapped, [...] As if my soul had largened: [...] Conscience-capped, <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>myself</b> the snarer--them the trapped.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{was a smart}} man, though, to make a cuckoo-clock. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> one <b>myself,</b> one time, {{and it was a}} {{wonderful}} thing. The cuckoo told what time it was every hour." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Jaaf and Susquesus? To be {{sure she}} does. Both are living still, {{and both are}} well. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> them <b>myself,</b> and even ate of their venison, so lately as last winter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Impossible!" [...] Cuthbert exclaimed, [...] "the firing {{has been}} heavy, but no heavier than usual, and {{although}} the village is knocked to pieces, as <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> for <b>myself</b> yesterday, no great harm was done to the bastions." ...|$|R
6000|$|I held my tongue. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>myself</b> {{calling on}} Charles Strickland and sending in my card; I saw him {{come into the}} room, holding it between finger and thumb: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A queer sentence, was it not, Yorke? And I knew, as she uttered it, it {{was true}} as queer. Her words were a mirror in which <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>myself.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Harry did not at {{all like}} the cross-examination, and his {{resolution}} to be cool was quickly fading. [...] "I told you that <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>myself</b> the figure of a man." ...|$|E
60|$|Now, mind! (said the German courier) I {{went with}} Mr. James into his brother's room, and <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> and heard <b>myself</b> what follows.|$|R
6000|$|At {{the door}} of the {{infirmary}} the Governor met us. [...] "1430," [...] he said to me, in a very kind voice, [...] "you have behaved most admirably. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> you <b>myself</b> quite distinctly from my drawing-room windows. Your bravery and intrepidity are well deserving of the highest recognition." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{believe the}} Wizard is fooling us. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> the kettle <b>myself,</b> {{and when he}} hung it over the fire there wasn't a thing in it but air." ...|$|R
60|$|This is {{the year}} 1492. I am eighty-two years of age. The things I am {{going to tell you}} are things which <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>myself</b> as a child and as a youth.|$|E
60|$|So I did. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>myself</b> in the glass, in my mourning-dress, a faded, hollow-eyed vision. Yet I thought {{little of}} the wan spectacle. The blight, I believed, was chiefly external: I still felt life at life's sources.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>myself</b> draw {{near her}} reverently and say, [...] "Margaret, he is dead, {{and that is}} why I have come back," [...] and I saw her put her arms around my neck as she often did long ago.|$|E
60|$|The Faun is not dead, {{despite my}} unlucky bullet. Henry {{insisted that he}} {{caught a glimpse of}} him yesterday. To-day <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> him <b>myself.</b> He came to the corner of the 'midship-house and gazed wistfully aft at the poop, {{straining}} and eager to understand. In the same way I have often seen Possum gaze at me.|$|R
6000|$|... "The signorina's {{writing-desk}} is gone," [...] replied Kenyon; [...] "it always {{stood on}} this table, and <b>I</b> <b>myself</b> <b>saw</b> it there {{only a few}} days ago." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As pretty a case as I {{have come}} across in years," [...] he said. [...] "Mrs. Pett, {{let me tell}} you something. It is one of my peculiarities that I never forget a face. You say that this young man pretends to have landed this morning from the Caronia? Well, <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> him <b>myself</b> more than a week ago in a Broadway cafe." ...|$|R
60|$|Her {{letter was}} a mirror in which <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>myself.</b> She said little, but I understood, and my self-satisfaction was in ribbons--and {{something}} deeper than self-satisfaction. I saw now that I loved her as I had not dreamed myself capable of loving.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{hardly knew}} myself when <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>myself</b> in a glass," [...] Jack said. [...] "Now, on what {{principle}} {{do you explain}} the fact that a slight alteration in the cutting and sewing together of pieces of cloth should make such a difference?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish to Heaven it was!" [...] Bathurst said gloomily; [...] "I {{could look}} without dread at {{whatever}} is coming {{as far as}} I am concerned, if I could believe it possible that I should be fighting as <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>myself</b> there." ...|$|E
5000|$|Says Mundhra, [...] "The {{family was}} very {{conservative}} and my grand mother was very strict {{and we were}} allowed to see maybe a couple of films a year and that too of the Har Har Mahadev variety. As a child <b>I</b> never <b>saw</b> <b>myself</b> as a young Marwari boy but a lot beyond that. In those days, the word global citizen was not there, but inside I felt like one".|$|R
60|$|By the by, {{the best}} view of the said fire (which <b>I</b> <b>myself</b> <b>saw</b> from a house-top in Covent-garden) was at Westminster Bridge, from the {{reflection}} on the Thames.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Will, hesitatingly, [...] "maybe {{that would}} be better after all than letting him stray away with other dogs who may teach him bad habits. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> Don <b>myself</b> one evening last week ambling down the Harbour road with that big brown dog of Sam Ventnor's. Ventnor's dog is {{beginning}} to have a bad reputation, you know. There have been several sheep worried lately, and--" ...|$|R
