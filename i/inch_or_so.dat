5|$|Cockroaches can {{be trapped}} in a deep, smooth-walled jar baited with food inside, placed so that {{cockroaches}} can reach the opening, for example with a ramp of card or twigs on the outside. An <b>inch</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> of water or stale beer (by itself a cockroach attractant) in the jar {{can be used to}} drown any insects thus captured. The method works well with the American cockroach, but less so with the German cockroach.|$|E
5|$|Then {{suddenly}} he faltered—and the disturbing truth became obvious. He wasn't reading his address at all. He had learned it by heart. To refresh his memory {{he brought the}} paper {{closer and closer to}} his eyes. When it was only an <b>inch</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> away he still couldn't read it, and had to fish for a magnifying glass in his pocket to make the typing visible to him. It was an agonizing moment.|$|E
5|$|Cores {{are often}} drilled {{in areas such}} as Antarctica and central Greenland where the {{temperature}} is almost never warm enough to cause melting, but the summer sun can still alter the snow. In polar areas, the sun is visible day and night during the local summer and invisible all winter. It can make some snow sublimate, leaving the top <b>inch</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> less dense. When the sun approaches its lowest point in the sky, the temperature drops and hoar frost forms on the top layer. Buried under the snow of following years, the coarse-grained hoar frost compresses into lighter layers than the winter snow. As a result, alternating bands of lighter and darker ice can be seen in an ice core.|$|E

2500|$|A {{counter-example}} is {{the common}} technique for recording an automobile. [...] For recording [...] "Onboard" [...] car sounds (which include the car interiors), a three-microphone technique is common. [...] Two microphones record the engine directly: one is taped to {{the underside of the}} hood, near the engine block. [...] The second microphone is covered in a wind screen and tightly attached to the rear bumper, within an <b>inch</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> of the tail pipe. [...] The third microphone, which is often a stereo microphone, is stationed inside the car to get the car interior.|$|E
60|$|The man then {{seized a}} bit of iron about as thick as his own wrist--full {{an inch and a}} half in diameter--which the {{scissors}} cut up into lengths of eighteen <b>inches</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> as easily as if it had been a bar of lead or wood.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hear! hear!" [...] {{interrupted}} Willie; [...] "but the copy-book says `Comparisons are odiows!' don't it? Mother, here's a fathom and two <b>inches</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> {{of humanity}} as {{wants me to}} go with him to Mr Auberly. I s'pose Frank can get along without me for a little while--eh?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "You should {{bend your}} knees from the thighs down. As your knees bend, {{the upper part of}} the trunk remains {{normally}} erect, just as it does when you sit down in a chair. In golf, the sit-down motion is more like lowering yourself onto a spectator-sports-stick. Think of the seat of the stick as being about two <b>inches</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> below your buttocks." ...|$|R

60|$|He {{extended}} his hand. She {{allowed him to}} take hers, but {{only to the extent}} of a niggardly <b>inch</b> <b>or</b> <b>so.</b> At the same moment she glanced up at him, when their eyes met, and hers were again withdrawn.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{think they}} would stand a blow against any rock if it hadn't a cutting edge. They would just bound off as a basket would. Of course they are very heavy for canoes; but as they won't have to carry more than the weight of four men each, they will draw little {{over a couple of}} <b>inches</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> of water.|$|R

50|$|A modern, {{tailored}} kilt, {{with its}} tapered pleats (tapered from seat to waist) is fastened about the body securely {{enough with the}} buckles and straps which are provided for that purpose. The kilt belt worn with such kilts is purely decorative during ceremonial use. They are typically fairly wide - between 2 - 1/2 and 3 <b>inches</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> - and come in black or brown leather.|$|R
60|$|All {{this time}} the uncle was dolefully blowing his clarionet in the corner, {{sometimes}} taking it an <b>inch</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> from his mouth for a moment while he stopped to gaze at them, with a vague impression that somebody had said something.|$|E
60|$|She walked buoyantly {{along by}} my side, as tall within an <b>inch</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> as myself, {{and with a}} certain elegance in her gait {{a little hard to}} {{reconcile}} with her years. All the while she looked eagerly about her, her eyes shining with curiosity.|$|E
60|$|Ann {{surveyed}} {{his features}} with tender, perplexed eyes; {{she had never}} seen him so white and drawn before, and her hand rested an <b>inch</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> away from his arm. The actual loss was still, as it were, afar from her. The immediate thing was his enormous distress.|$|E
50|$|Stem Morris canoes {{display a}} “splayed stem”, 3 <b>inches</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> in width at the inboard end {{and made of}} cedar. The splayed end of the stem has a squared-off appearance. Some canoes built by the Kennebec Boat and Canoe Company have an {{identical}} cedar stem, possibly because Kennebec founder George Terry hired men from Morris. The Rhinelander Boat Company employed a splayed hardwood stem on its boats {{as well as its}} canoes.|$|R
6000|$|That same afternoon, Gyp {{was sitting}} in a shelter on the common, a book on her knee--thinking her one long thought: 'To-day is Thursday--Monday week! Eleven days--still!'--when three figures came slowly toward her, a man, a woman, and {{what should have been a}} dog. English love of beauty and the rights of man had forced its nose back, {{deprived}} it of half its ears, and all but three <b>inches</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> of tail. It had asthma--and waddled in disillusionment. A voice said: ...|$|R
60|$|To {{begin with}} {{they had been}} rather loose over the feet and turned up, and as the game progressed, fold after fold of concertina-ed flannel {{gathered}} about his ankles. Every now and then Mr. Raeburn would seize the opportunity of some respite from the game to turn up a fresh six <b>inches</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> of this accumulation. Naturally Mr. Direck expected this policy to end unhappily. He {{did not know that}} the flannel trousers of Mr. Raeburn were like a river, that they could come down forever and still remain inexhaustible....|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was a good}} shot, Pete; {{especially}} considering how you are out of practice. If {{it had been a}} red-skin it would have stunned him sure, for I doubt whether it is not too high by a quarter of an <b>inch</b> <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> to have finished him altogether." ...|$|E
6000|$|Soup Face, who {{had been}} assiduously communing with a pint flask, leaned close to Columbus Blackie, placing his {{whiskers}} within an <b>inch</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> of the other's nose as was his habit when addressing another, and whispered, relative to the pearl necklace: [...] "Not a cent less 'n fifty thou, bo!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Kemp {{stared at}} the bandage as it moved across the room, then saw a basket chair dragged across the floor and come to rest near the bed. It creaked, and the seat was {{depressed}} the quarter of an <b>inch</b> <b>or</b> <b>so.</b> He rubbed his eyes and felt his neck again. [...] "This beats ghosts," [...] he said, and laughed stupidly.|$|E
5000|$|Dolls come in girl, boy, baby, and (beginning in {{the last}} {{production}} cycle) toddler versions. Girl and boy dolls are 16 <b>inches</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> tall, while babies and toddlers are 11 - 12 inches. Babies have curved {{arms and legs and}} do not stand. When first introduced, baby dolls were sexed with stylised genitals, but the practice was discontinued. Dolls have rooted hair in brown, blonde, red, or black, though some [...] "limited edition" [...] dolls had wigs. Clothes sets were available, though some clothes came only with the purchase of a doll and were not available separately.|$|R
50|$|When the fore-aft {{adjustment}} {{range of the}} saddle needs further extension than the clamp affords, {{it may be possible}} to add a saddle adjuster. One such adjuster mounts on the existing saddle clamp and allows up to 40mm of increase or decrease in the fore-aft position of the saddle. Another method for increasing the fore-aft adjustment is the swept-back seat post, where the seat post has a curve in it over the six <b>inches</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> before the saddle. Because of the gentle sweep of the tube, the top part of the seat-post cannot fit within the seat-tube, so this solution is useful only for high seat positions.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's been gettin' hotter round this Greaser corral {{for some}} weeks," [...] replied the other cowboy. [...] "If that two-bit of a {{garrison}} surrenders, there's no tellin' what'll happen. Orozco is headin' west from Agua Prieta with his guerrillas. Campo is burnin' bridges an' tearin' up the railroad south of Nogales. Then there's all these bandits callin' themselves revolutionists just {{for an excuse}} to steal, burn, kill, an' ride off with women. It's plain facts, Laddy, an' bein' across the U.S. line a few <b>inches</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> don't make no hell of a difference. My advice is, don't let Miss Castaneda ever set foot in Casita again." ...|$|R
60|$|The makings were neatly {{laid out}} on a side-table, and to pour into a glass an <b>inch</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> of the raw spirit and shoosh some soda-water {{on top of it}} was with me the work of a moment. This done, I retired to an arm-chair and put my feet up, sipping the mixture with {{carefree}} enjoyment, rather like Caesar having one in his tent the day he overcame the Nervii.|$|E
6000|$|... "There can't {{be much of}} {{a mistake}} if we're to travel nor'-nor'-east," [...] and Bob placed the compass on that portion of the {{shattered}} timber which yet remained in the sand. [...] "It'll be a decently hard job to walk in a straight line, though, an' if we should happen to get an <b>inch</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> out of the way at the start it would throw the whole course askew." ...|$|E
60|$|About {{this time}} the wind began to rise, and came in {{irregular}} gusts. At each gust the door was blown from the wall an <b>inch</b> <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> and fell back with a noise that invariably awoke Joe with a start. He looked round each time quickly; but as the door remained quiet he did not discover {{the cause of his}} alarm. After it had done this several times Joe became, so to speak, desperately courageous.|$|E
50|$|Cars {{and trucks}} were also molded in larger sizes, from about five inches {{up to about}} ten <b>inches</b> <b>or</b> <b>so.</b> These {{appeared}} both as cars and trucks / utility vehicles. Larger cars included an Indianapolis style open wheel racer (see photo), a 1957 Cadillac Eldorado convertible, a less realistic Cadillac-style 'station wagon', and also a 1955 Plymouth station wagon airport limousine with nine different people molded into the windows (see photo). Utility vehicles produced were a detailed fire truck, a variety of tractors and farm implements, a road grader and other construction vehicles, an articulated cab and stake bed truck. Tanks and airplanes were a staple, and many other more fantastic creations were also produced.|$|R
50|$|Delivered {{just as with}} a punch {{except that}} the hand is held open like with a knife hand. The {{intended}} striking area are {{the tips of the}} fingers. The ideal targets are the eyes and throat. This technique is generally unsuitable against most other targets due to the high probability that one might break their fingers. It does have the added advantage of increasing the range of normal hand striking by 3-4 <b>inches</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> as opposed to say punching, backfisting, or hammer fisting. It is considered a high-level technique requiring enormous conditioning, but even accidental spear fingering can be quite devastating on the eyes such as punching mistakes seen in modern MMA circuits.|$|R
60|$|Selecting what he {{believed}} to be the thickest part of the bull's hide, he cut off a small portion about eighteen inches square. Spreading this on the ground with the hair upwards, he planted his naked foot on it and marked the shape thereon. Then with his knife he cut away the hide all round the foot-mark at four <b>inches</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> from the outline of the foot. Next, he bored little holes all round the margin, through which he ran a line, or lace, also made of raw hide. Then, planting his foot again {{in the middle of the}} hide, he drew the line tight, causing the edges to rise all round the foot and almost cover it.|$|R
