40|$|We {{developed}} a high-copy-number plasmid system containing the entire structural and regulatory sequences of the phosphate-repressible acid phosphatase (PHO 5) gene and the TRP 1 /ARS 1 replicator sequences of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{to investigate the}} mechanism of repression-derepression of transcription. The resulting plasmid was used to transform either wild-type cells or a number of strains which contain mutations in various trans-acting regulatory loci {{for the production of}} acid phosphatase. Results of analysis of mRNA levels isolated from the transformed strains grown under repressed or derepressed conditions suggested that normal transcriptional regulation of the gene persisted, although gene copy number was significantly increased. Analysis of changes in linking number (i. e., the number of negative supercoils) of the plasmid isolated under repressed and derepressed growth conditions revealed that the transcriptionally <b>inactive</b> <b>plasmid</b> contained approximately three more negative supercoils than the transcriptionally active plasmid. This difference in topological state was similarly seen in a plasmid containing a sequence-related acid phosphatase gene (PHO 11) under the same regulatory control system, but it was not seen in plasmids isolated from some strains containing mutations which caused either fully constitutive or nonderepressible production of acid phosphatase. Finally, analysis of the nucleosome positioning along the inactive gene sequence revealed that an abnormally broad internucleosomal spacer is present in a region presumed to function in the regulation of transcription by the level of Pi in the growth media...|$|E

Pancreatic cancer remains a cancer {{with the lowest}} survival rate and shortest median survival. It is predicted to accelerate to the 2 nd cause of cancer related death in the next 15 years. Poor survival rates stem from late disease detection, aggressive tumor biology, and unsuccessful treatments. These dismal statistics highlight the urgency for increased knowledge of the biology of pancreatic cancer {{and the need for}} effective therapies. Within the past decade, cancer stem cells, a population within the tumor, have been exposed for their role in tumor initiation, progression, chemoresistance, and metastasis. These studies focus to examine the role of CD 133 positive cancer stem cells in stemness and metastasis within pancreatic cancer. We demonstrated that CD 133 positive pancreatic cancer cells, from human pancreatic cancer cell lines and a spontaneous murine model of pancreatic cancer, are capable of tumor initiation at very low cell numbers in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent mice, respectively. These cells exhibited chemoresistance properties by the upregulation of drug transporters, active drug efflux capabilities, and resistance to cell death upon treatment with conventional chemotherapies, such as gemcitabine and 5 -fluorouracil. CD 133 positive cancer stem cell population was, however, sensitive to a novel therapy- Minnelide™. In both in vitro and in vivo studies, CD 133 positive cells responded to Minnelide™ treatment and underwent apoptosis in addition to the CD 133 negative population. These investigations led to questions regarding the function of this surface marker. CD 133 played no functional role in conferring the cancer stem cell phenotype to this population. Through overexpression of CD 133 in a pancreatic cancer cell line with very low endogenous CD 133 expression, we determined that CD 133 expression influences both stemness and invasiveness. Cells overexpressing CD 133 were capable of initiating tumors at low cell numbers, as compared to control cells, and exhibited an upregulation in pluripotency and developmental signaling gene expression. Additionally, tumors derived from CD 133 overexpressing cells demonstrated a marked increase in metastasis to several distant sites. This was shown to occur through the activation of NF-kB signaling and induction of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition; resulting in increased cellular invasiveness. Further, CD 133 expressing cells displayed increased expression and secretion of the cytokine, interleukin- 1 beta. Inhibition of IL- 1 signaling through various methods established a significant role for IL- 1 in the induction of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cellular invasiveness. Significantly, interleukin- 1 beta positively correlates with CD 133 gene expression in pancreatic cancer cell lines of varying aggressiveness. In cell lines with high levels of CD 133 positive populations, inhibition of IL- 1 signaling demonstrated its critical role in epithelial-mesenchymal transition induction and invasiveness. This exhibited that IL- 1 signaling functions within CD 133 positive populations during the metastasis process. Finally, these studies demonstrated the pivotal role of NF-kB activation in the induction of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, cellular invasion, and metastasis. Using triptolide and NF-kB signaling inhibitor treatment, as well as, NF-kB signaling pathway modulation via constitutively active or <b>inactive</b> <b>plasmid</b> expression, this signaling pathway was decisively confirmed to mediate invasion and metastasis in pancreatic cancer. Taken together, this work establishes the functional role of the cancer stem cell marker, CD 133; IL- 1 signaling; and NF-kB activation in pancreatic cancer stemness and metastasis...|$|E

40|$|E. coli {{harboring}} the mutant plasmid pKGP-HA 1 mut 4 and an inactive pCM-X# are chloramphenicol resistant {{and that}} the mutation responsible {{for the expression of}} CAT from the <b>inactive</b> pCM-X# <b>plasmid</b> is a G to A transition at nucleotide 664 of T 7 gene 1 that converts glutamic acid (222) to lysine. This mutation expands the range of T 7 promoter sequences that can be utilized by the enzyme. The mutant T 7 RNA polymerase, GP 1 (lys 222), utilizes inactive T 7 promoter point mutants more efficiently than wild-type T 7 RNA polymerase both in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, the correlation of in vivo and in vitro promoter utilization suggests that the restoration of chloramphenicol resistance in the cotransformed E. coli results from the ability of GP 1 (lys 222) to initiate transcription from T 7 promoter point mutants that are normally inactive.

40|$|Nuclear {{extracts}} from adenovirus type 5 (Ad 5) infected HeLa cells {{were used to}} study the template requirements for adenovirus DNA replication in vitro. When XbaI digested Ad 5 DNA, containing the parental terminal protein (TP), {{was used as a}} template preferential synthesis of the terminal fragments was observed. The newly synthesized DNA was covalently bound to the 82 kD preterminal protein (pTP). Plasmid DNAs containing the Ad 2 origin sequence or the Ad 12 origin sequence with small deletions were analyzed for their capacity to support pTP-primed DNA replication. Circular <b>plasmid</b> DNAs were <b>inactive.</b> When <b>plasmids</b> were linearized to expose the adenovirus origin, both Ad 2 and Ad 12 TP-free fragments could support initiation and elongation similarly as Ad 5 DNA-TP, although with lower efficiency. These observations indicate that the parental terminal protein is dispensable for initiation in vitro. The presence of 29 nucleotides ahead of the molecular end or a deletion of 14 base pairs extending into the conserved sequence (9 - 22) destroyed the template activity. DNA with a large deletion within the first 8 base pairs could still support replication while a small deletion could not. The results suggest that only G residues at a distance of 4 - 8 nucleotides {{from the start of the}} conserved sequence can be used as template during initiation of DNA replication...|$|R
40|$|The killer toxin of Kluyveromyces lactis {{consists}} of three polypeptides encoded by the linear plasmid k 1. We re-introduced the entire k 1 sequence, cloned on a circular replicating plasmid, into K. lactis strains lacking k 1, {{and found that the}} resulting transformants did not produce toxin. The barrier to expression was found to be transcriptional: the four transcripts of native k 1 were absent, and instead shorter, aberrant k 1 transcripts were made. We determined the precise initiation sites of the four transcripts of native k 1 : these had very short untranslated leaders and mapped about 14 bp downstream of an "upstream conserved sequence" (UCS). It appears that k 1 has novel promoters which are <b>inactive</b> on circular <b>plasmids</b> which replicate in the nucleus. This is consistent with the suggestion that native k 1 resides in the cytoplasm...|$|R
40|$|The gamma origin binding {{sites of}} the {{replication}} initiator pi protein, composed of seven 22 -base-pair (bp) direct repeats and previously shown to be essential for replication of plasmid R 6 K, can also act as an inhibitor of R 6 K replication in Escherichia coli cells if provided in trans. Inhibition is dependent upon the ability of these repeats to bind the R 6 K-encoded pi protein but is not overcome by increasing the intracellular pi level. The insertion of a second repeat cluster {{in close proximity to}} the gamma origin also can markedly inhibit replication. The severity of this effect is dependent upon the position, orientation, and number of repeats present in the extra cluster. As few as six extra repeats can result in a completely nonfunctional gamma origin. However, this <b>inactive</b> gamma origin <b>plasmid</b> containing the six extra repeats is functional when placed in a strain that underproduces the wild-type pi protein or when placed in the presence of any of several copy-up mutant pi proteins. On the basis of these observations, we propose that the nucleoprotein structures formed by the binding of pi protein to the seven 22 -bp direct repeats at the gamma origin are capable of coupling with each other in vivo and that replication initiation is prevented at such coupled origins. In support of this model of replication control, we demonstrate by electron microscopy analysis that the pi protein has the ability to associate two DNA molecules containing gamma origin sequences and also show that pi enhances the DNA ligase-catalyzed multimerization of a DNA fragment containing the gamma origin...|$|R
40|$|The {{increased}} {{expression of}} immediate-early genes {{is a key}} feature of the myocardial response to hypertrophic stimuli. In this study, we investigated whether pressure overload or phenylephrine treatment stimulated myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF 2) -dependent transcriptional activation of c-jun in cardiac myocytes. Western blotting and immunohistochemical analysis of rat myocardium demonstrated that p 70 (MEF 2) is highly expressed in the rat heart and is predominantly located at the nuclei of cardiac myocytes. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays of myocardial nuclear extracts revealed a consistent DNA binding activation of MEF 2 after 1 and 2 hours of pressure overload. We further showed that pressure overload induced a progressive nuclear translocation and activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 5 (ERK 5). Coimmunoprecipitation and in vitro kinase assays indicated that the activation of ERK 5 was paralleled by increased association of ERK 5 /p 70 (MEF 2) and by enhanced ability of ERK 5 to phosphorylate p 70 (MEF 2). Experiments with in vivo transfection of the left ventricle with the c-jun promoter reporter gene showed that pressure overload induced a consistent increase of c-jun transcriptional activity in the rat myocardium. Rendering the MEF 2 site of the c-jun <b>plasmid</b> <b>inactive</b> by mutation abolished the load-induced activation of the c-jun promoter reporter gene. Mutation of the MEF 2 site also abolished the phenylephrine-induced c-jun promoter activation in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes. In addition, we demonstrated that neonatal rat ventricular myocyte transfection with ERK 5 -antisense oligodeoxynucleotide inhibited the phenylephrine-induced c-jun promoter activation. These findings identify MEF 2 as a potential regulator of c-jun transactivation and suggest that ERK 5 might be an important mediator of MEF 2 and c-jun promoter activation in response to hypertrophic stimuli in cardiac myocytes...|$|R
