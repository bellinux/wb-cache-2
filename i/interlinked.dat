5|$|The mass, radius and {{luminosity}} {{of a star}} {{are closely}} <b>interlinked,</b> and their respective values can be approximated by three relations. First is the Stefan–Boltzmann law, which relates the luminosity L, the radius R and the surface temperature Teff. Second is the mass–luminosity relation, which relates the luminosity L and the mass M. Finally, the relationship between M and R is close to linear. The ratio of M to R increases {{by a factor of}} only three over 2.5 orders of magnitude of M. This relation is roughly proportional to the star's inner temperature TI, and its extremely slow increase reflects the fact that the rate of energy generation in the core strongly depends on this temperature, whereas it has to fit the mass–luminosity relation. Thus, a too high or too low temperature will result in stellar instability.|$|E

40|$|A hybrid {{alternate}} current/direct current (AC/DC) microgrid {{consists of}} an AC subgrid and a DC subgrid, and the subgrids are connected through the <b>interlink</b> bidirectional AC/DC converter. In the stand-alone operation mode, it is desirable that the <b>interlink</b> bidirectional AC/DC converter manages proportional power sharing between the subgrids by transferring power from the under-loaded subgrid to the over-loaded one. In terms of system security, the <b>interlink</b> bidirectional AC/DC converter takes an important role, so proper control strategies need to be established. In addition, {{it is assumed that}} a battery energy storage system is installed in one subgrid, and the coordinated control of <b>interlink</b> bidirectional AC/DC converter and battery energy storage system converter is required so that the power sharing scheme between subgrids becomes more efficient. For the purpose of designing a tracking controller for the power sharing by <b>interlink</b> bidirectional AC/DC converter in a hybrid AC/DC microgrid, a droop control method generates a power reference for <b>interlink</b> bidirectional AC/DC converter based on the deviation of the system frequency and voltages first and then <b>interlink</b> bidirectional AC/DC converter needs to transfer the power reference to the over-loaded subgrid. For efficiency of this power transferring, a linear quadratic regulator with exponential weighting for the current regulation of <b>interlink</b> bidirectional AC/DC converter is designed {{in such a way that}} the resulting microgrid can operate robustly against various uncertainties and the power sharing is carried out quickly. Simulation results show that the proposed <b>interlink</b> bidirectional AC/DC converter control strategy provides robust and efficient power sharing scheme between the subgrids without deteriorating the secure system operation...|$|R

5|$|There {{are more}} than 30 monuments in the early Maya style, which dates to the Late Preclassic, making it the most common style {{represented}} at Takalik Abaj. The great quantity of early Maya sculpture {{and the presence of}} early examples of Maya hieroglyphic writing suggest that the site played an important part in the development of Maya ideology. The origins of the Maya sculptural style may have developed in the Preclassic on the Pacific coast and Takalik Abaj's position at the nexus of key trade routes could have been important in the dissemination of the style across the Maya area. The early Maya style of monument at Takalik Abaj is closely linked to the style of monument at Kaminaljuyu, showing mutual influence. This <b>interlinked</b> style spread to other sites that formed part of the extended trade network of which these two cities were the twin foci.|$|E
5|$|In 738 the <b>interlinked</b> {{fortunes}} of Quiriguá and Copán took a stunning change of direction when K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat, reigning lord of Quiriguá, captured the powerful, but elderly 13th king of Copán, Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil, who had installed {{him on his}} throne in 725. This coup {{does not seem to}} have affected either Copán or Quiriguá physically, there is no evidence that either city was attacked at this time and the victor seems not to have received any detectable tribute. Quiriguá seems rather to have gained its independence and the control of important trade routes. An inscription at Quiriguá, although difficult to interpret, suggests that the capture took place on 27 April 738, when Quiriguá seized and burned the wooden images of Copán's patron deities. All of this seems to imply that K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat managed to somehow ambush Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil, rather than to have defeated him in outright battle. In the Classic Period the statues of Maya deities often were carried into battle on palanquins, facilitating their capture in the event of defeat. It has been suggested that the king of Copán was attempting to attack another site in order to secure captives for sacrifice, and was ambushed by K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat and his Quiriguá warriors.|$|E
5|$|The {{localization}} {{proved more}} challenging than other Atlus projects for multiple reasons. As the characters' text bubbles {{were designed to}} use Japanese kanji characters—which compress {{a lot of information}} into a single symbol in a way impossible in the English alphabet—each text bubble had to be individually resized and sometimes shifted so they would not intrude on other elements within scenes. The sheer amount of voice acting in the game meant that dubbing took far longer than other similar projects, running past its projected time and requiring Atlus staff members to voice very minor characters to save time. The main characters were a major focus due to the storytelling style of multiple <b>interlinked</b> narratives, with each character's personal growth needing to be reflected in their voice performance. This was particularly true of Mercedes. The auto-scrolling nature of dialogue, which moved along at a set pace rather than through the player's button prompts, meant that performances needed to be correctly timed and balanced to the varying paces at which the actors read their lines. This led to lines being modified during recording to keep within schedule. During the last stages, the team needed to rerecord some lines of dialogue, but to keep the localization in budget and on schedule it was done outside a professional recording studio, resulting in an audible drop in quality.|$|E
40|$|The <b>interlinking</b> of commit {{and issue}} data {{has become a}} de-facto {{standard}} in software development. Modern issue tracking systems, such as JIRA, automatically <b>interlink</b> commits and issues by the extraction of identifiers (e. g., issue key) from commit messages. However, the conventions {{for the use of}} <b>interlinking</b> methodologies vary between software projects. For example, some projects enforce the use of identifiers for every commit while others have less restrictive conventions. In this work, we introduce a model called PaLiMod to enable the analysis of <b>interlinking</b> characteristics in commit and issue data. We surveyed 15 Apache projects to investigate differences and commonalities between linked and non-linked commits and issues. Based on the gathered information, we created a set of heuristics to <b>interlink</b> the residual of non-linked commits and issues. We present the characteristics of Loners and Phantoms in commit and issue data. The results of our evaluation indicate that the proposed PaLiMod model and heuristics enable an automatic <b>interlinking</b> and can indeed reduce the residual of non-linked commits and issues in software projects...|$|R
40|$|<b>Interlinking</b> {{is without}} doubt {{one of the}} most active and mature areas of {{research}} and development in semantic technologies. Over the last decade or more a multitude of approaches to match, merge and integrate ontologies, both at the schema and instance levels have been proposed and successfully applied to resolve heterogeneity issues and, more recently, to <b>interlink</b> RDF data sets exposed over the Web as part of the Linked Open Data Cloud. The strengths and weaknesses of existing <b>interlinking</b> solutions, as well as their natural limitations and principled combinations have been intensively studied, not least through community projects such as the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative. Human input remains a key ingredient of the process, either as a source of domain knowledge used to train matching algorithms and to build the underlying knowledge base, or to validate automatically computed results. In this paper we describe how such human input could be acquired and used to enhance the results of existing data <b>interlinking</b> technology via crowdsourcing. In a survey of data <b>interlinking</b> tools we identify several aspects of the <b>interlinking</b> process that crucially rely on human contributions and explain how these aspects could be subject to a semantically enabled human computation architecture that can be set-up by extending <b>interlinking</b> platforms such as Silk with direct interfaces to popular microtask platforms such as Amazon's Mechanical Turk...|$|R
