40|$|Extruded {{parts of}} non-sterilized and P-irradiated (25 and 50 kGy) {{plasticized}} poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) used for disposable medical devices {{have been studied}} to investigate the effect of sterilization on surface chemical composition. The polymer surfaces were analysed using angle-resolved x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The inner surface <b>of</b> the blood <b>tubing</b> <b>lines</b> showed a fairly smooth surface {{both before and after}} sterilization, so a laterally homogeneous surface can be assumed for XPS analysis. The XPS survey spectra exhibited no signals besides carbon, chlorine, oxygen and calcium. Detailed analysis of the regions showed the C 1 s, Cl 2 p and O 1 s signals to be multi-component, presenting signals of the PVC, the plasticizer and the other additives. Binding energies remained constant irrespective of P-radiation dosage, but the amount of chlorine component at 198. 4 +/- 0. 1 eV (associated with modified PVC) decreased with sterilization dosage. Angle-resolved XPS revealed that this component is located at the outermost surface of the polymer. It can be hypothesized that the production processes themselves (extrusion and/or injection molded) already induce modifications of the polymer surface and also lead to surface segregation of the plasticizer. During the subsequent thermal sterilization of the polymer dehydrochlorination continues but, because of the very short time required by the beta-irradiation technology to sterilize devices, the atmospheric oxygen is unable to diffuse into the irradiated material, thus inhibiting further side-degradation of the materials, such as thermo-oxidative degradation.

50|$|With <b>lined</b> <b>tubing,</b> {{the thin}} inside liner {{is made of}} a {{chemically}} resistant material such as poly-olefin and PTFE that form a barrier for the rest <b>of</b> the <b>tubing</b> wall from coming {{in contact with the}} pumped fluid. These liners are materials that are often not elastomeric, therefore the entire tube wall cannot be made with this material for peristaltic pump applications. This tubing provides adequate chemical compatibility and life to be used in chemically challenging applications. There are a few things to keep in mind when using these tubes - any pin holes in the liner during manufacturing could render the tubing vulnerable to chemical attack. In the case of stiff plastic liners like the polyolefins, with repeated flexing in the peristaltic pump they can develop cracks, rendering the bulk material again vulnerable to chemical attack. A common issue with all <b>lined</b> <b>tubing</b> is delamination <b>of</b> the liner with repeated flexing that signals the end of the tube's life. For those with need for chemically compatible <b>tubing,</b> these <b>lined</b> <b>tubing</b> offer a good solution.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Oil tubing {{works as}} a special {{pipeline}} in oil well has the characteristic of high work efficiency and under high loading. Oil tubing failure which commonly happens {{during the course of}} oilfield development and production can bring severe economic loss because of the failure accidents caused by the eccentric friction <b>of</b> rods and <b>tubing</b> account for a great percentage. It has a great of significance to study on the fatigue fracture situation and the critical eccentric friction depth <b>of</b> <b>tubing</b> with defects. Oil <b>tubings</b> <b>of</b> J 55 material with the specification of Ф 73 * 5. 51 commonly used in oilfields were chosen to be the source of semi-ellipse surface crack tensile specimens. Residual life <b>of</b> oil <b>tubing</b> with different eccentric friction percentages was studied through tensile tests. The critical eccentric friction percentage under which the residual life <b>of</b> oil <b>tubing</b> can meet pump detection period was determined, which provides reference for making a reasonable failure standard <b>of</b> <b>tubing.</b> From the tensile test results <b>of</b> the oil <b>tubings</b> <b>of</b> J 55 material simulating the condition that the eccentric friction depth accounts for 30 % ~ 50 % of the wall thickness, the critical friction depth <b>of</b> oil <b>tubing</b> <b>of</b> J 55 material is 43. 0 % of the wall thickness. 1...|$|R
50|$|This {{refers to}} the {{integrity}} <b>of</b> the production <b>tubing.</b> Common threats to tubing integrity are erosion and corrosion by production fluids, which denude the steel.

40|$|The {{internal}} pressure strength <b>of</b> <b>tubing</b> and casing often cannot satisfy the design requirements in high pressure, high temperature and high H 2 S gas wells. Also, the practical safety coefficient of some wells {{is lower than}} the design standard according to the current API 5 C 3 standard, which brings some perplexity to the design. The ISO 10400 : 2007 provides the model which can calculate the burst strength <b>of</b> <b>tubing</b> and casing better than API 5 C 3 standard, but the calculation accuracy is not desirable because about 50 percent predictive values are remarkably higher than real burst values. So, for the sake of improving strength design <b>of</b> <b>tubing</b> and casing, this paper deduces the plastic limit pressure <b>of</b> <b>tubing</b> and casing under {{internal pressure}} by applying the twin shear unified strength theory. According to the research of the influence rule of yield-to-tensile strength ratio and mechanical properties on the burst strength <b>of</b> <b>tubing</b> and casing, the more precise calculation model of tubing-casing’s burst strength has been established with material hardening and intermediate principal stress. Numerical and experimental comparisons show that the new burst strength model is much closer to the real burst values than that of other models. The research results provide an important reference to optimize the tubing and casing design of deep and ultra-deep wells...|$|R

30|$|Many {{data output}} in radiopharmacy is {{commonly}} based on detection of radioactivity, {{which is usually}} measured with an in-line detector in liquid chromatography. In-line detection is described in general monographs in the Ph. Eur. 2.2. 66 (European Pharmacopeia 9.0 2017 a). Briefly, a sample containing a radiopharmaceutical is diluted (if necessary) and injected onto a chromatography system with specified volume, conditions and column as written in accordant standard operating procedure (SOP). Important QC parameters for in-line detection on LC are limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantification (LOQ) and detector linearity (Guide for the elaboration of monographs on radiopharmaceutical preparations 2018).

40|$|Abstract. Oil well tubing {{is used in}} oil {{extraction}} in offshore oil well. Under the force of tubular columns, erosion and pressure of drilling fluids, the oil well tubing usually fails in long-term service, which always leads to accidents and stagnation of production. So it’s especially necessary to detect faults in tubing. Intense-magnetic memory testing equipment for reusable offshore oil well tubing is developed for this consideration. The equipment is composed of feeding machines, baiting machines, transport machines and a detection machine. Measurement and control system decides the running sequence logic of these components and obtains fault signals <b>of</b> <b>tubing.</b> The avoidance <b>of</b> transport machines for oil well tubing coupling makes the transport <b>of</b> <b>tubing</b> stable. The synchronization control of transport and detection <b>of</b> <b>tubing</b> decides the accurate location of faults. The automatic switch of both detection units and measurement of fault signals makes it convenient to detect oil well <b>tubing</b> <b>of</b> multiple sizes...|$|R
