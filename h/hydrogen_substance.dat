To evaluate the effects of two contrasting hydrothermal environments on the antioxidant defence system of this vent mussel species, a 2 -week transplant experiment was carried out involving mussels collected from the relatively deep (2300 m), and chemical rich, Rainbow vent field. These were transplanted to the shallower (1700 m), and relatively less toxic, Lucky Strike vent field. To achieve this objective, levels of superoxide dismutase, catalase (CAT), total glutathione peroxidase (GPx), selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase and lipid peroxidation (LPO) were measured in the gills and mantle tissues of resident and transplant mussels {{before and after the}} transplant experiment. With the exception of CAT, the gills of the transplanted mussels had significantly higher antioxidant enzyme activity compared with the basal levels in the donor (Rainbow) and recipient (Lucky Strike) populations; whereas the antioxidant enzyme levels in the mantle tissues of the transplants reflected the baseline levels of activity in the native Lucky Strike mussels after 2 weeks. In contrast, LPO levels were significantly higher in both tissue types in the transplants than in either the source or the recipient populations, which suggested a response to hydrostatic pressure change (note, the transplant animals were brought to the surface for transportation between the two vent fields).

40|$|AbstractTransient {{receptor}} potential vanilloid type channels (TRPVs) {{are expressed}} in several cell types in human and animal lungs. Increasing evidence has demonstrated important roles of these cation channels, particularly TRPV 1 and TRPV 4, in the regulation of airway function. These TRPVs can be activated {{by a number of}} endogenous <b>substances</b> (<b>hydrogen</b> ion, certain lipoxygenase products, etc.) and changes in physiological conditions (e. g., temperature, osmolarity, etc.). Activation of these channels can evoke Ca 2 + influx and excitation of the neuron. TRPV 1 channels are generally expressed in non-myelinated afferents innervating the airways and lungs, which also contain sensory neuropeptides such as tachykinins. Upon stimulation, these sensory nerves elicit centrally-mediated reflex responses as well as local release of tachykinins, and result in cough, airway irritation, reflex bronchoconstriction and neurogenic inflammation in the airways. Recent studies clearly demonstrated that the excitability of TRPV 1 channels is up-regulated by certain autacoids (e. g., prostaglandin E 2, bradykinin) released during airway inflammatory reaction. Under these conditions, the TRPV 1 can be activated by a slight increase in airway temperature or tissue acidity. Indirect evidence also suggests that TRPV channels may play a part in the pathogenesis of certain respiratory diseases such as asthma and chronic cough. Therefore, the potential use of TRPV antagonists as a novel therapy for these diseases certainly merits further investigation...|$|R

The scientific community is addressing the analysis and planning of distributed energy resources with widespread approaches, taking into account technical, environmental, economic and social issues.

Changes in laccase activity {{in the presence of}} natural fungicidals, the saponins from Medicago sativa roots, were also examined. The introduction of both metal ions and some pro. oxidants into the medium enhanced a multiple increase in extracellular laccase activity for the two fungal strains, Trametes versicolor and Abortiporus biennis.

30|$|Oxidation is a {{chemical}} reaction that transfers electrons or <b>hydrogen</b> from a <b>substance</b> to an oxidizing agent. Free radicals are generated during this oxidation reaction especially during oxidative respiration {{when there is}} a mitochondria leakage of activated oxygen [1], which in turn initiate a chain of reactions that results in cellular damage. Antioxidants terminate this chain of reactions by removing free radical intermediates, thus inhibiting further oxidation reactions [2]. They include reducing agents such as β-carotene, vitamin C, E and ascorbic acid, as well as enzymes like superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione and peroxidases [3], and therefore exert their protective role by being oxidized themselves. Furthermore, many antioxidants compounds have been characterized form plants including flavonoids. Flavonoids are phenolic compounds with importants roles in scavenging free radicals and thus play vital roles in preventing oxidative stress associated disorders [4]. Among the common ROS are superoxide (O 2 ·−), hydroxyl (OH), and peroxyl (OOH, ROO) radicals [5]. Enzymes capable of producing superoxide are xanthine oxidase, reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidases and cytochrome P 450 [1]. The imbalance between the production of these free radicals and the detoxifying capacity of the antioxidants results in oxidative stress which is among the major implicative factors in etiology of certain degenerative and chronic diseases including diabetes, atherosclerosis, parkinson’s disease [6], renal disorders [7], cardiovascular, inflammatory, cancer, autoimmune, neurodegenerative diseases [8], and several other human ailments [9].|$|R

The conformation of humic substances in the solutions is mainly stabilized by weak disperse forces, such as Van der Waals, -, CH- interactions and <b>hydrogen</b> bonds. Humic <b>substances</b> in the solutions tend to form aggregates that are held together mostly by the intermolecular hydrophobic interactions. Concentration series of humic acids were prepared in three different mediums of constant ionic strength: NaOH and NaCl (prepared either by neutralization NaOH by HCl or direct dilution by solution of NaCl). Several analytical methods have been used to determine conformation and molecular organization of humic acids: potentiometric determination of pH, direct conductometry, ultraviolet and visible spectroscopy, density measurement, dynamic light scattering, laser Doppler velocimetry and high resolution ultrasound spectrometry. It was confirmed that the conformation and molecular organization of humic acids in aqueous solutions depend not only on pH of medium, but they also depend on chemical nature and concentration with the same pH. Results showed that hydrodynamic diameter of particles is significantly increasing in NaCl medium prepared by neutralization NaOH by HCl, particularly at low concentrations, which corresponds to higher values of zeta potential obtained. Concentration dependencies of ultrasonic velocity and compressibility also indicate the changes in conformation and molecular organization corresponding with results from other methods used...|$|R

In {{the marine}} environment vast amount of carbon is stored as gas hydrates within the temperature and pressure zone these ice-like structures are stable. Natural gas hydrate mapping and characterization is important basic research that brings about critical knowledge concerning various topics. Natural gas hydrates is {{a vital part of}} the carbon cycle, it is a potential energy resource (and thereby a potential climate agent) and it is a potential geo-hazard. One of the goals the GANS initiative aimed at exploring, was the hydrate bearing sediment of the Norway -Svalbard margins, to investigate the character and expansion of natural gas hydrates. Part of the investigation was to define how the gas in the hydrated sediment was produced and where it came from. As a result this thesis addresses the matter of light hydrocarbon characterization and origin in two Norwegian hydrate deposits. On cruises to Vestnesa on the Svalbard margin and to Nyegga in the mid-Norwegian margin, samples of hydrate charged and non-hydrate charged sediments were obtained and analyzed. Through compositional and isotopic analyses the origin of the hydrate bound gas in the fluid escape feature G 11 at Nyegga was determined. The hydrate incubated methane is microbial produced as well as parts of the hydrate bound ethane. The compositional analysis in both the Nyegga area and at the Vestnesa Ridge points at thermogenic contributions in the sediment interstitials and pore water. The two hydrate bearing margins show large differences in hydrocarbon content and microbial activity in the pockmarks investigated. The gravity cores from the penetrated pockmark at Vestnesa showed low hydrocarbon content and thus suggest ceased or periodic venting. The fluid flow escape features at Nyegga show large variety of flux rates based on ROV monitoring and headspace analysis of the sediment and pore water. The light hydrocarbon content varies largely both between the pockmarks and within a single pockmark. Laboratory experiments have been preformed to consider the carbon isotope fractionation effect of hydrate formation. The experiments display minor fractionation with contrasting fractionation effects of carbon isotopes when forming methane hydrates and structure two hydrates of methane, ethane and propane. This does not inflict with the interpretation of the isotopic signature of the hydrated deposits at Nyegga. Thus the proposed microbial carbon circulation in the free gas zone beneath the gas hydrate stability zone is withheld as the probable root of the light isotopic signature...|$|R

Such {{a class of}} systems can be described by an additive two-body potential whose functional form is common to all substances which only differ in the energy ϵ and range l scales of the potential. With this choice De Boer's quantum theorem of corresponding states holds thus implying that ground-state properties expressed in appropriate reduced form are only determined by the dimensionless parameter λ_ 0 ^ 2 ∼ħ^ 2 /ml^ 2 ϵ measuring the strength of zero-point motion in the system. The presence of a minimum in the two-body interaction potential leads to a many-body bound state which is a Luttinger liquid. As λ_ 0 increases, the asymmetry of the two-body potential causes quantum expansion, softening, and eventual evaporation of the Luttinger liquid into a gas phase. Selecting the pair interaction potential in the Morse form we analytically compute {{the properties of the}} Luttinger liquid and its range of existence. As lambda_ 0 increases, the system first undergoes a discontinuous evaporation transition into a diatomic gas followed by a continuous dissociation transition into a monoatomic gas. In particular we find that spin-polarized isotopes of hydrogen and He- 3 are monoatomic gases, He- 4 is a diatomic gas, while molecular <b>hydrogen</b> and heavier <b>substances</b> are Luttinger liquids.

NaCl (100 mM) was used to mimic salinity stress in a series of experiments. Varying combinations of CO in a saturated aqueous solution and hematin (1. 0 mu M) were added to seeds and seedlings under salinity stress. Seed germination indices and seedling parameters were investigated. Seed germination and seedling growth were significantly inhibited under salinity stress. NaCl-induced inhibitory effects on seed germination and seedling growth were ameliorated by hematin or the CO aqueous solution. Addition of 1. 0 mu M hematin or 5 % CO-saturated aqueous solution to seeds and seedlings significantly alleviated damage to the plant cells under salinity stress. Hematin and the CO aqueous solution enhanced chlorophyll concentration, total soluble sugars, free proline, and soluble protein, and improved photosystem II (PSII) photochemical efficiency levels, PSII actual photochemical efficiency, and the photochemical quench coefficient. In contrast, the non-photochemical quenching coefficient decreased. Hematin and the CO aqueous solution also enhanced the activities of superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, and glutathione reductase, thus alleviating oxidative damage, as indicated by decreases in hiobarbituric acid reactive <b>substances,</b> <b>hydrogen</b> peroxide concentration, relative conductivity, and lipoxygenase activity. Heme oxygenase (HO) activity was increased by hematin treatment. Hematin may contribute to endogenous HO-derived CO, since the addition of zinc protoporphyrin IX or hemoglobin reversed the protective effects conferred by hematin specified above.

Among the PGPR group, Azotobacter are ubiquitous, aerobic, free-living, and N 2 -fixing bacteria commonly living in soil, water, and sediments. Being the major group of soilborne bacteria, Azotobacter plays different beneficial roles and is known to produce varieties of vitamins, amino acids, plant growth hormones, antifungal <b>substances,</b> <b>hydrogen</b> cyanide, and siderophores. The growth-promoting substances such as indoleacetic acid, gibberellic acid, arginine, etc., produced by Azotobacter have direct influence on shoot and root length as well as seed germination of several agricultural crops. Azotobacter species are efficient in fixation of highest amount of nitrogen (29. 21 μg NmL− 1 day− 1), production of indoleacetic acid (24. 50 μgmL− 1) and gibberellic acid (15. 2 μg 25 mL− 1), and formation of larger phosphate solubilizing zone (13. 4 mm). Many species of Pseudomonas, Bacillus, and Azotobacter can grow and survive at extreme environmental conditions, viz., tolerant to higher salt concentration, pH values, and even at dry soils with maximum temperature. Different factors affect Azotobacter population in soil such as pH, phosphorus content, soil aeration and moisture contents, etc. A. chroococcum found tolerant to a maximum NaCl concentration of 6 % with a temperature of 45 ° C and also up to pH of 8. Azotobacter species such as A. vinelandii, A. chroococcum, A. salinestris, A. tropicalis, and A. nigricans are able to produce antimicrobial compounds which inhibit the growth of common plant pathogens, viz., Fusarium, Aspergillus, Alternaria, Curvularia, and Rhizoctonia species. Pesticides used to control pests, insects, and phytopathogens are known to cause direct effect on soil microbiological aspects, environmental pollution, and health hazards in all living beings of the soil ecosystem. The species of Azotobacter are known to tolerate up to 5 % pesticide concentration and also to degrade heavy metals and pesticides. A. chroococcum and A. vinelandii proved their biodegradation efficiency of many commonly used pesticides, viz., endosulfan, chlorpyrifos, pendimethalin, phorate, glyphosate, and carbendazim. From these results, {{it is clear that}} the Azotobacter strains not only produce plant growth-promoting substances (PGPS) but are also tolerant to abiotic stress under different physiological conditions...|$|R
