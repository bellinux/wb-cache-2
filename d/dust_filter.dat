50|$|A dust {{collector}} {{is a system}} used to {{enhance the quality of}} air released from industrial and commercial processes by collecting dust and other impurities from air or gas. Designed to handle high-volume dust loads, a {{dust collector}} system consists of a blower, <b>dust</b> <b>filter,</b> a filter-cleaning system, and a dust receptacle or dust removal system. It is distinguished from air cleaners, which use disposable filters to remove dust.|$|E
50|$|While {{the power}} supply (PSU) {{contains}} a fan with few exceptions, {{it is not}} to be used for case ventilation. The hotter the PSU's intake air is, the hotter the PSU gets. As the PSU temperature rises, the conductivity of its internal components decrease. Decreased conductivity means that the PSU will convert more of the input electric energy into thermal energy (heat). This cycle of increasing temperature and decreased efficiency continues until the PSU either overheats, or its cooling fan is spinning fast enough to keep the PSU adequately supplied with comparatively cool air. The PSU is mainly bottom-mounted in modern PCs, having its own dedicated intake and exhaust vents, preferably with a <b>dust</b> <b>filter</b> in its intake vent.|$|E

50|$|A 330L Puma, no. 177, was {{converted}} to Oryx configuration {{and used as}} a prototype and as the results exceeded all expectations the Oryx programme was launched. The sanctions era encouraged the local aviation industry to become self-sufficient in producing helicopter components and, with the knowledge to assemble pre-manufactured helicopters, led to the technical skill for producing complete Puma helicopters, should the need arise. This included complete airframes and dynamic components such as gearboxes, rotor blades and turbines and hot section parts. The engine intakes are fitted with locally produced dust filters and ensure higher efficiency and reliability. It is an upgraded and remanufactured version of the Aérospatiale SA 330 Puma, equivalent to the Eurocopter AS332 Super Puma, and offers a performance improvement over the original, in addition to cutting the operating costs by 25 to 30%. First examples were fitted with the latest dust filters as were then in use on the SAAF Puma. These units had a moveable auxiliary air intake on the front. A newly designed <b>dust</b> <b>filter</b> was later fitted without the auxiliary air intake. Should one of the engines fail, the remaining powerplant has sufficient power for the Oryx to complete its mission. If an engine fails in flight, the management system automatically advances the power setting on the remaining engine. This ensures the Oryx sustains flight with very little crew input, during such an emergency.|$|E
5000|$|From {{the first}} trials {{it was evident}} that the C.202 was an {{advanced}} design, mainly because of the use of the Daimler Benz DB 601, a departure from the standard practice of using engines of Italian origin. Test results showed that Italy had caught up with Britain and Germany in the field of fighter airplanes. The prototype differed in some respects from the production aircraft; the headrest fairing incorporated two windows for rear visibility, while production versions replaced this with a narrower, scalloped headrest. The square-sectioned supercharger air intake was replaced by an elongated round sectioned fairing, which was later redesigned to incorporate a <b>dust</b> <b>filter.</b> The prototype was flown to the Regia Aeronauticas main test airfield at Guidonia, where it met with an enthusiastic response from test pilots. A speed of 603 km/h (375 mph) was recorded, with 5,486 m (18,000 ft) being reached in six minutes and little of the good manoeuvrability of the C.200 was lost.Another of its attributes was its extremely strong construction that allowed its pilots to dive the aircraft steeply.Due to the flight test reports, the C.202 was immediately ordered into production with the first examples (built by Macchi as Serie II) appearing in May 1941. The complexity of the structure was not well suited to mass production, and resulted in a limited production rate compared to the Bf 109E/F (usually rated at 4,500-6,000 man-hours) while the Macchi needed 22,000 or more. The growth of the C.202 project was slower than that of the Re. 2001; but, by employing both mass production techniques and less expensive advanced technologies, the production cost was slightly less than that of the Reggiane Re.2001, (525,000 lire vs 600,000); this latter, the only other DB 601 fighter in mass production, was slower and heavier (2.460/3.240 kg) [...] but had a bigger wing and a more advanced and adaptable structure. Breda, Milan was also chosen to build the C.202 and eventually built the majority of the type. SAI-Ambrosini was another sub-contractor, building some 100 C.202s.|$|E

40|$|Considering the {{disadvantage}} of the present home and aboard biomass gasifiers, a new design was conducted to improve the current conditions such as low combustion, high tar and dust, low heat value and so on. A suite of gasification was achieved to decrease tar, sulfur and dust during gasification process. The developing system provides a feasible strategy for improving and developing gasifier equipment. The improved gasifier equipment includes gas generator, high temperature pyrolysis apparatus, the first <b>dust</b> <b>filter,</b> the second <b>dust</b> <b>filter,</b> heat-cold exchange apparatus, washing apparatus, motive power apparatus, tar removal apparatus, and sulfur removal apparatus. The harmless combustible gases enter the gas container, and go through a dedicated pipeline, and then the gas was delivered to the house for coking, heating or generating electricity. Up to now, the improved gasifier equipment has been successfully applied to some communities in Qinghai and inner Mongolia of China. Implications of the improved gasifier equipment is improving human health, reducing fuel consumption, deforestation and global climate change.

40|$|An {{outbreak}} of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) occurred on a {{head and neck}} surgical (HNS) ward of a university hospital in Amsterdam. The outbreak lasted from May 2000 until November 2000, and MRSA spread to two intensive care units. Amplified fragment length polymorphism analysis indicated that a single clone {{was responsible for the}} outbreak. Phage-typing indicated that this clone was of a type that was uncommon in The Netherlands. Strict isolation of patients, according to the Dutch national guidelines, was instituted. During the outbreak, surveillance culture specimens, from patients, healthcare workers, and the environment, were obtained at regular intervals. MRSA was found in the <b>dust</b> <b>filters</b> of nebulizers through which air from the room was filtered and subsequently humidified. These nebulizers were used to humidify tracheostomies. The <b>dust</b> <b>filters</b> were not maintained according to the guidelines. Restricted use and cleaning and disinfection of all ultra-sonic nebulizers led to termination of the outbreak.

40|$|Case StudyA 2500 HP {{integral}} gear compressor in an {{air separation}} plant experienced an impeller failure {{in the first stage}} of compression. The failure was extensive and took the dry air compressor off-line. Plant production was curtailed for several weeks. Initial investigation focused on the 1 st stage centrifugal compressor impeller and upstream <b>dust</b> <b>filter.</b> Most of the aluminum impeller was missing and portions of the air filter element had melted. With the sequence and cause unclear, a formal root cause analysis (RCA) was undertaken. The RCA process ultimately revealed that an unexpected thermite reaction occurred and consumed most of the aluminum impeller. During compressor shutdown, products of the intensely exothermic thermite reaction backflowed into the upstream <b>dust</b> <b>filter</b> causing the element to partially melt. The thermite reaction initiated in the impeller back disk seal area where metal oxides and fuel (debris) had collected. Viscous heating and temperatures greater than expected allowed the rotating labyrinth seal to creep. Contact with the babbitted stationary seal generated additional heat and further accelerated the creep process. Frictional heating in the impeller back disk seal initiated the reaction. Corrective actions to prevent reoccurrence included a creep resistant impeller back disk seal and a passive debris removal system to prevent debris particles from collecting in the impeller back disk seal area. This compressor and a twin have operating reliably since 2003. Recent inspection revealed neither back disk seal creep no the collection of debris particles.
