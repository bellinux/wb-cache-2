5|$|According to an IAU draft resolution, the {{roundness}} condition generally results <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for {{a mass of}} {{at least}} 5 kg, or diameter of at least 800km. However, Mike Brown claims that these numbers are only right for rocky bodies like asteroids, and that icy bodies like Kuiper Belt objects reach hydrostatic equilibrium at much smaller sizes, probably somewhere between 200 and 400km in diameter. It {{all depends on the}} rigidity of the material that makes up the body, which is in turn strongly influenced by its internal temperature. Assuming that Methone's shape reflects the balance between the tidal force exerted by Saturn and the moon's gravity, its tiny 3km diameter suggests Methone is composed of icy fluff.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, after Estonia regained independence, {{the country}} {{underwent}} a {{restructuring of the}} economy, causing {{the collapse of a}} large part of the heavy industry sector. This collapse led to a decrease in the consumption of electricity and thus a decrease <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for the oil shale that was mined to produce it. Electricity and shale oil export to former Soviet markets largely ceased. Due to a decrease in demand, the Tammiku and Sompa mines closed in 1999 and those at Kohtla and Ahtme closed in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Poitous {{developed}} in the French Poitou region, possibly from donkeys introduced to the area by the Romans. They {{may have been a}} status symbol during the Middle Ages, and by the early 18th century, their physical characteristics had been established. A studbook for the breed was established in France in 1884, and the 19th and early 20th centuries saw them being used for the production of mules throughout Europe. During this same time, Poitou bloodlines were also used to develop other donkey breeds, including the American Mammoth Jack in the United States. Increasing mechanization in the mid-20th century saw a decline <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for, and hence population of, the breed, and by 1977, a survey found only 44 members worldwide. Conservation efforts were begun by a number of public and private breeders and organizations, and by 2005 there were 450 purebred Poitou donkeys.|$|E

5|$|Ramanujan {{spent nearly}} five years in Cambridge collaborating with Hardy and Littlewood, and {{published}} part of his findings there. Hardy and Ramanujan had highly contrasting personalities. Their collaboration was a clash of different cultures, beliefs, and working styles. In the previous few decades, the foundations of mathematics had come into question {{and the need for}} mathematically rigorous proofs recognized. Hardy was an atheist and an apostle of proof and mathematical rigour, whereas Ramanujan was a deeply religious man who relied very strongly on his intuition and insights. While in England, Hardy tried his best to fill the gaps in Ramanujan's education and to mentor him <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for formal proofs to support his results, without hindering his inspiration - a conflict that neither found easy.|$|E

Troll Airfield was opened on 11 February 2005 by Queen Sonja of Norway and the new research station the following day. After the opening, another power station was built in 2005. In 2006, a satellite base station was built by Kongsberg Satellite Services. This resulted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for a broadband connection for the base. During the winter season of 2006, there was no overwintering due to lack of funding, but from 2007 this has been re-instated. In 2008, a windmill was taken into use to provide some of the power.|$|E

5|$|Work on {{establish}} an administration was initiated by Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld in 1871. After contacting the invested governments, {{he concluded that}} only Russia and Norway would object to an annexation of the island. Fridtjof Nansen's endeavors raised the Norwegian public's consciousness of the Arctic, which again brought forth public support for annexation of Svalbard. Industrialization and permanent settlements on Svalbard began in the 1900s {{with the introduction of}} coal mining. This resulted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for jurisdiction. Firstly, there was no means to make a mining claim legal. Secondly, there was a need for conflict resolution, particularly regarding labor conflicts, which often saw the mining company and the workers have different nationalities.|$|E
5|$|Castro {{believed}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> {{for reform}} if Cuban socialism was {{to survive in}} a world now dominated by capitalist free markets. In October 1991, the Fourth Congress of the Cuban Communist Party was held in Santiago, at which a number of important changes to the government were announced. Castro would step down as head of government, to be replaced by the much younger Carlos Lage, although Castro would remain the head of the Communist Party and Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces. Many older members of government were to be retired and replaced by their younger counterparts. A number of economic changes were proposed, and subsequently put to a national referendum. Free farmers' markets and small-scale private enterprises would be legalized in an attempt to stimulate economic growth, while U.S. dollars were also made legal tender. Certain restrictions on emigration were eased, allowing more discontented Cuban citizens to move to the United States. Further democratization was to be brought in by having the National Assembly's members elected directly by the people, rather than through municipal and provincial assemblies. Castro welcomed debate between proponents and opponents of the reforms, although over time he began to increasingly sympathise with the opponent's positions, arguing that such reforms must be delayed.|$|E

40|$|Aim: The overall aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{illuminate}} older persons' experience of becoming in need of public home help and their family members' experience of this situation. Further, {{the aim was to}} illuminate experiences of participation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> assessment process of older people and influence on decisions about public home help from the perspective of older needs-assessed persons, their family members, assessing home help officers and external home help officers. Method: A qualitative hermeneutic approach and triangulation of sources was used as the methodological strategy. A purposive sample of older persons aged 75 and over, who had gone through <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> assessment process and lived in their ordinary homes, was selected consecutively, retrospectively from home help officers' files on decisions about public home help in two municipalities. Data were collected about the same topic - older needs-assessed persons and family members' participation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> assessment, through personal interviews with those involved, the older needs-assessed persons (n= 28, age 75 - 96, Paper I-II), family members (n= 27, age 42 - 93, Paper III) the assessing home help officers (n= 5, age 29 - 50, 26 interviews), and an additional focus group interview with home help officers (n= 9) (Paper IV). Analysis: A qualitative content analysis was used (Paper I-IV) to interpret concrete and abstract meaning content, the latter inspired by hermeneutics to convey the meaning of <b>the</b> utterance, which <b>in</b> each study was interpreted as one overarching category that encompassed principal categories and sub-categories. Findings: To the older persons becoming in need of public home help it meant "Experiencing discontinuity in life as a whole - the countdown has begun" (Paper I). Further, their participation and influence on decisions about public home help when undergoing needs assessment and receiving public home help meant "Having to be satisfied, adjust, and walk a fine line when balancing between needs and available help" (Paper II). To family members with an older next of kin becoming in need of public home help, their participation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> assessment procedure and the decisions about their next of kin's public home help meant "Feeling disconfirmed or confirmed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> assessment, when feeling pressed by the responsibility and struggling to balance <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> of <b>the</b> family" (Paper III). To home help officers, the participation of older help recipients and family members <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> assessment procedure and the decisions made about public home help meant "Having to establish boundaries towards family influence {{and at the same time}} use them as a resource" (Paper IV). These findings seem to correspond to and provide an understanding of the meaning of older needs-assessed persons' and family members' participation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> assessment as a whole. Conclusion: <b>The</b> <b>needs</b> assessment marked a turning point that can be understood and framed as a larger distressing life transition for both older persons and family members, which could cause difficulties for adequate participation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> assessment. Both older persons and family members experienced <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> assessment as difficult to comprehend, they lacked knowledge regarding aims, procedures, and rights and had not perceived what was <b>the</b> actual <b>needs</b> assessment. <b>The</b> older persons' actual ability to participate and communicate varied, and family members could be necessary as representatives, which created a moral conflict for the home help officers. Home help officers' attitudes towards their professional responsibility seemed to influence their management of older persons' and family members' participation. <b>The</b> <b>needs</b> assessment focused solely on the older individual's present situation and mainly physical and practical disabilities and needs, while mental, existential, social and medical needs tended to be neglected. The older persons and family members had little opportunity to participate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process or to influence the decisions. Older persons felt that help offered in accordance with municipal guidelines had to be accepted, and family members felt mainly disconfirmed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> assessment encounter. <b>The</b> forms of <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> assessment and organisational conditions must be reviewed to promote the sense of coherence and participation of those involved...|$|R
