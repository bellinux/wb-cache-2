25|$|Groundbreaking, {{previously}} set for January 2009, was put {{off until}} July 2009 and possibly December 2009. By March 2009, financing had still not {{been put in}} place. Hines-Archstone officials said they would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> twice as many investors as usual before financing could be found. The lack of financing began to worry contractors. Firms such as the structural engineering company Thornton Tomasetti, consulting engineering firm TOLK, Inc., and Shalom Baranes Associates, among others, {{said they would be}} forced to lay off employees if the project did not start soon.|$|E
500|$|Paul Simon's {{homage to}} Lennon, [...] "The Late Great Johnny Ace", {{initially}} sings of the {{rhythm and blues}} singer Johnny Ace, {{who is said to}} have shot himself in 1954, then goes on to reference John Lennon, as well as President John F. Kennedy who was assassinated in 1963, the year [...] "Beatlemania" [...] started. Simon had actually premiered the song during Simon & Garfunkel's reunion Concert in Central Park in 1981; {{near the end of the}} song, a fan ran onto the stage, possibly in response to Simon's mentioning Lennon in the lyrics. The man, saying to Simon, [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you", was dragged offstage by Simon's personnel; all of this can be seen in the DVD of the concert. The song also appears on Simon's Hearts and Bones (1983) album.|$|E
500|$|The {{pictures}} {{shown on}} the world feed (supplied by host broadcaster RAI) of Senna being treated were considered by the BBC (the corporation responsible for broadcasting the San Marino Grand Prix to viewers in the United Kingdom) to be too graphic, disturbing and upsetting for general viewing at the time (around 13:20 GMT), and the BBC abandoned RAI's world feed to focus on their own camera in the pit lane. BBC commentator Murray Walker has frequently talked about how upsetting it was to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> viewers whilst attempting to avoid any and all mention of the distressing images shown on RAI. Referring {{to the number of}} times the incident was replayed on the world feed, Ferrari team principal Jean Todt stated that [...] "even if you didn't want to watch it, you could barely fail to". Senna was lifted from the wrecked Williams, and after approximately fifteen minutes of on-site medical attention, was airlifted directly to Maggiore Hospital, becoming the third and final driver to be admitted there during the weekend. Medical teams continued to treat him during the flight. Thirty-seven minutes after the crash, at 2:55pm local time, the race was restarted.|$|E
6000|$|... "What news {{have you}} heard lately, Mrs. Leake?" [...] asked Miss Todd. The great thing was <b>to</b> make Mrs. Leake <b>talk</b> instead of <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her.|$|R
5000|$|... 'A rabbi doesn't {{work only}} for his {{community}} {{or for the}} Jews. A rabbi <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> every human being who needs him. He belongs to everybody. He is for everybody.' ...|$|R
60|$|There {{were some}} people there {{of the night}} before, and Colville <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> them. One of the ladies {{asked him if he}} had met the Inglehart boys as he came in.|$|R
500|$|Kyle Busch, who {{finished}} second, said, [...] "He {{was on a}} mission today, that's for sure. When Jeff Gordon has a good car {{and he has the}} opportunity to beat you, he's going to beat you. He's my hero. I've always watched him and what he's been able to accomplish over the years." [...] In the subsequent press conference, pole position winner, Edwards, stated his frustration at his accident, [...] "I’m not exactly sure what happened. I’ll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> Kyle about it. I thought at first he was just frustrated and he turned left to get back in line and he didn’t know I was there, but I watched the tape and I think he really did get loose. He hit me hard and I was left with nothing. I got rammed to the infield." [...] Rick Hendrick, the owner of Hendrick Motorsports, expressed his enjoyment of winning the race, stating, [...] "When you're a champion like Jeff Gordon, you know you can still do it, (even) when people overlook you. He's been right there but he hasn't had that edge. I think we're {{going to see a lot}} of momentum out of that team right now." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, the {{following}} day, Pacquiao's top adviser, Michael Koncz, stated that Pacquiao had never agreed to testing until fight day. [...] "Will we give blood five days, seven {{days before the}} fight? You know, that's something I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> Manny about, but {{we have nothing to}} hide," [...] Koncz said.|$|E
2500|$|On July 8, 2011, ESPN {{reported}} that Pacquiao {{was willing to}} agree to random drug testing—but not by the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA). [...] "We have agreed in the Pacquiao camp to unlimited random testing done by a responsible, neutral organization," [...] Arum told Yahoo. [...] "We don't believe USADA is a neutral organization. I don't think anybody's test is as vigorous as the test administered by the Olympic Organization. And we can arrange for the Olympic Organization to handle the test {{under the supervision of}} the Athletic commission respective of the state where the fight is going to be held." [...] However, the following day, Pacquiao's top adviser, Michael Koncz, stated that Pacquiao had never agreed to testing all the way up to fight day. [...] "Will we give blood five days, seven days before the fight? You know, that's something I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> Manny about, but we have nothing to hide," [...] Koncz said.|$|E
6000|$|... "No!" [...] she said. [...] "That is finished. I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> see you. I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you. Go away, please. I cannot bear {{to see you}} any more. It is too terrible--too terrible!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To avert suspicion, most dear Betty. Also I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her of this Peter, in {{whom she}} seems so greatly interested. You are very shrewd, Betty--tell me, {{is that to}} be a match?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, it is. You {{come and}} tease and say uncivil things, and I don't {{choose to be}} bullied. What right <b>have</b> you <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me about Mr. Newton? Did I ever give you any right? Honest indeed! What right <b>have</b> you <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me about being honest?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Between 1983 and 1986, Landy charged about $430,000 annually. When he {{requested}} more money, Carl Wilson {{was obliged to}} give away a quarter of Brian's publishing royalties. In 1988, Wilson said that [...] "Dr. Landy doesn't like {{me to be in}} touch with my family too much. He thinks it's unhealthy." [...] Landy responded to the charges that he exerted too much control on the songwriter: [...] "He's got a car phone in his car. If he wants to call somebody, he calls somebody... He can go anywhere, on his own, anytime he wants." [...] Regarding Wilson's relationship to the Beach Boys at that time, Wilson added: [...] "Although we stay together as a group, as people we're a far cry from friends. One time we were doing an interview together, and the interviewer asked Carl what it was between him and me. He goes, 'Well, Brian and I don't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> each other. We're just Beach Boys, but we don't need to be friends.' And that's true. Although, whenever I think about him, I feel rotten." ...|$|E
2500|$|On Saturday, April 27, a man {{was arrested}} in Corpus Christi, Texas for trying to sell a {{saxophone}} to a music store. On Thursday, April 25, the thirty-year-old man walked into a music store without an instrument and asked the sales person {{if they wanted to}} buy an alto Bundy saxophone. The girl told him that she would need to speak to her manager. The man replied, [...] "What do you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him about it for? You work here, don't you?" [...] The girl claimed that the man seemed nervous. Once the manager was summoned, the man fled. The store contacted the police. The man was arrested two days later at a waterfront hotel after purchasing a [...]45 revolver from a pawn shop. On Tuesday, April 30, the sales girl identified him as the same man who tried selling the saxophone. Although no saxophone was found in his possession, the police found a bag of bloody clothing in his hotel room. The man claimed that the blood was from a cut he had received on his forehead in a bar fight.|$|E
2500|$|At {{a meeting}} hosted by Stop the War Coalition in 2009, Corbyn said he invited [...] "friends" [...] from Hamas and Hezbollah {{to an event}} in parliament, {{referred}} to Hamas as [...] "an organisation dedicated towards {{the good of the}} Palestinian people and bringing about long term peace and social justice and political justice in the whole region" [...] and said that the British government's labelling of Hamas as a terrorist organisation is [...] "a big, big historical mistake." [...] Asked on Channel 4 News in July 2015 why he had called representatives from Hamas and Hezbollah [...] "friends", Corbyn explained, [...] "I use it in a collective way, saying our friends are prepared to talk," [...] and that the specific occasion he used it was to introduce speakers from Hezbollah at a Parliamentary meeting about the Middle East. He said that he does not condone the actions of either organisation: [...] "Does it mean I agree with Hamas and what it does? No. Does it mean I agree with Hezbollah and what they do? No. What it means is that I think to bring about a peace process, you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> people with whom you may profoundly disagree ... There {{is not going to be}} a peace process unless there is talks involving Israel, Hezbollah and Hamas and I think everyone knows that." ...|$|E

She is then put to stay with Julia.|$|R
2500|$|Corbyn {{has been}} vocal on Middle East foreign policy. He {{is a member}} of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign, campaigning against {{conflict}} in Gaza and what the organisation considers to be [...] "apartheid in Israel".

6000|$|... "Isn't it beautiful?" [...] {{said the}} Story Girl in rapture. [...] "I wouldn't {{have missed it}} for anything. I'm glad I left my necklace. And I am glad you are with me, Bev. The others wouldn't {{understand}} so well. I like you because I don't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you all the time.

5000|$|Lars Ulrich {{reflected}} on the production, saying: “We were at a crossroads. We had been really good at being able to compartmentalize {{a lot of this}} stuff. Suppress it with drinking or other extravagances. This {{was the first time we}} <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> each other, get to know each other and work stuff out.

6000|$|... "Why, I {{was obliged}} to let him {{understand}} explicitly that I preferred to keep some of my clothes for my own personal wearing; also, I put his magnificence upon an allowance of cologne-water, and actually was so cruel as to restrict him to one dozen of my cambric handkerchiefs. Dolph was particularly huffy about it, and I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him like a father, to bring him round." ...|$|R

"That's all right, that's all right, {{you may be}} sure, mother," [...] said Cohen, as if {{anxious to}} cut off inquiry on matters {{in which he was}} {{uncertain}} of the guest's position.
