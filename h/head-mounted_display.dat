5|$|Measurement of {{predictive}} visual tracking {{is being}} studied as a screening technique to identify mild traumatic brain injury. A <b>head-mounted</b> <b>display</b> unit with eye-tracking capability shows a moving object in a predictive pattern {{for the person}} to follow with their eyes. People without brain injury {{will be able to}} track the moving object with smooth pursuit eye movements and correct trajectory while it is hypothesized that those with mild traumatic brain injury cannot.|$|E
5|$|The player {{may choose}} to begin flight on a runway or taxiway, or in the air. Aircraft are {{controlled}} via keyboard, joystick, <b>head-mounted</b> <b>display</b> or specialized input devices such as pedals. During flight, several third- and first-person camera angles may be selected. For example, the third-person Flyby View places the camera {{in front of the}} plane as it flies past, while the first-person Three-Way View displays more information about the plane's position and speed than other angles. Certain camera angles, including the Three-Way View and 3-D Cockpit view, provide the player with simulated flight instruments such as an altimeter, airspeed indicator, accelerometer, variometer and tachometer. The game is designed to allow players to perform aerobatic maneuvers such as the Immelmann turn, tailslide, Lomcevak and Cuban Eight. Performances may be recorded and played back, with controls that allow the player to pause, rewind and fast forward. At any time, the player may stop a recording and resume flight from that point.|$|E

25|$|The Hawk is {{designed}} to carry a centreline gun pod, such as the 30mm ADEN cannon, two under-wing pylons, and up to four hardpoints for fitting armaments and equipment. In RAF service, Hawks have been equipped to operate the Sidewinder air-to-air missiles. In the early 1990s, British Aerospace investigated the possibility of arming the Hawk with the Sea Eagle anti-ship missile for export customers. In 2016, BAE Systems was developing so-called 'Advanced Hawk' with a new wing using leading-edge slats, and potentially additional sensors and weapons, a <b>head-mounted</b> <b>display,</b> and a single large-screen display in the forward cockpit.|$|E
25|$|Near {{the close}} of the 2015 season, Canada's Wonderland {{announced}} that two new flat rides would be added in 2016 — Skyhawk (a Gerstlauer Sky Roller) and Flying Eagles (a Larson International Flying Scooters). Cedar Fair CEO Matt Ouimett also confirmed in December 2015 that virtual reality (VR) headsets would be added to Thunder Run in 2016. Available to riders for an additional upcharge fee, the experience is co-developed with Mack Rides, a German amusement ride company.

25|$|The {{input device}} used for games, the game controller, varies across platforms. Common {{controllers}} include gamepads, joysticks, mouse devices, keyboards, the touchscreens of mobile devices, and buttons, or even, with the Kinect sensor, a person's hands and body. Players typically view {{the game on}} a video screen or television or computer monitor, or sometimes on virtual reality <b>head-mounted</b> <b>display</b> goggles. There are often game sound effects, music and, in the 2010s, voice actor lines which come from loudspeakers or headphones. Some games in the 2000s include haptic, vibration-creating effects, force feedback peripherals and virtual reality headsets. In the 2010s, the video game industry is of increasing commercial importance, with growth driven particularly by the emerging Asian markets and mobile games, which are played on smartphones. As of 2015, video games generated sales of USD 74 billion annually worldwide, and were the third-largest segment in the U.S. entertainment market, behind broadcast and cable TV.|$|E

25|$|Also in 1966, Ivan Sutherland {{continued}} to innovate at MIT when he invented the first computer controlled <b>head-mounted</b> <b>display</b> (HMD). Called the Sword of Damocles {{because of the}} hardware required for support, it displayed two separate wireframe images, one for each eye. This allowed the viewer to see the computer scene in stereoscopic 3D. After receiving his Ph.D. from MIT, Sutherland became Director of Information Processing at ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency), and later became a professor at Harvard. In 1967 Sutherland was recruited by Evans to join the computer science program at the University of Utah - a development which would turn that department {{into one of the}} most important research centers in graphics for nearly a decade thereafter, eventually producing some of the most important pioneers in the field. There Sutherland perfected his HMD; twenty years later, NASA would re-discover his techniques in their virtual reality research. At Utah, Sutherland and Evans were highly sought after consultants by large companies, but they were frustrated at the lack of graphics hardware available at the time so they started formulating a plan to start their own company.|$|E
500|$|As of 2010, {{the use of}} {{predictive}} visual tracking measurement {{to identify}} mild traumatic brain injury was being studied. [...] In visual tracking tests, a <b>head-mounted</b> <b>display</b> unit with eye-tracking capability shows an object moving in a regular pattern. People without brain injury are able to track the moving object with smooth pursuit eye movements and correct trajectory. [...] The test requires both attention and working memory which are difficult functions for people with mild traumatic brain injury. The question being studied, is whether results for people with brain injury will show visual-tracking gaze errors relative to the moving target.|$|E
2500|$|The Virtual Boy is a 32-bit {{table-top}} {{video game}} console developed and manufactured by Nintendo. Released in 1995, it was marketed {{as the first}} console capable of displaying stereoscopic 3D graphics. The player uses the console {{in a manner similar}} to a <b>head-mounted</b> <b>display,</b> placing their head against the eyepiece to see a red monochrome display. The games use a parallax effect to create the illusion of depth. Sales failed to meet targets, and by early 1996, Nintendo ceased distribution and game development, only ever releasing 22 games for the system.|$|E
50|$|The Oculus Rift is {{a virtual}} reality headset that was {{developed}} by Oculus VR. The company was founded by Palmer Luckey, who had {{a keen interest in}} <b>head-mounted</b> <b>displays</b> and had developed a prototype of the Oculus Rift by 2012. Concurrently, John Carmack, at the time of id Software, a subsidiary under ZeniMax Media, also was interested in <b>head-mounted</b> <b>displays,</b> saw Luckey's prototype for the Rift and modified it, showcasing the updated prototype at Electronic Entertainment Expo 2012 (E3) that June using a modified version of id's Doom 3.|$|R

50|$|Another way to {{characterize}} these devices is {{according to the}} different categories of depth perception cues used to achieve that the user can understand the three-dimensional information. The main types of displays used in 3D UIs are: monitors, surround-screen displays, workbenches, hemispherical <b>displays,</b> <b>head-mounted</b> <b>displays,</b> arm-mounted displays and autostereoscopic displays.|$|R
2500|$|The Virtual Boy is {{the first}} video game console that was {{supposed}} to be capable of displaying stereoscopic 3D graphics, marketed as a form of virtual reality. Whereas most video games use monocular cues to achieve the illusion of three dimensions on a two-dimensional screen, the Virtual Boy creates an illusion of depth through the effect known as parallax. In a manner similar to using a <b>head-mounted</b> <b>display,</b> the user looks into an eyepiece made of neoprene on the front of the machine, and then an eyeglass-style projector allows viewing of the monochromatic (in this case, red) image. Nintendo claimed that a color display would have made the system too expensive and resulted in [...] "jumpy" [...] images, so the company opted for a monochrome display.|$|E
2500|$|In Shadowrun, Fourth Edition, the Matrix {{rules have}} changed, {{thanks to the}} setting's {{constant}} evolution and a drive to match real world technological developments. After the second Matrix crash in 2064, Matrix technology was {{moved away from the}} wired network and led into a wireless technology. The most noticeable difference between the Matrix in the 2070s and the earlier editions is that wireless technology has become completely ubiquitous. Communications and Matrix access is provided through Wi-Fi nodes placed throughout the infrastructure of just about every city on Earth, fulfilling a service similar to contemporary cell sites—but as these nodes are as numerous as telephone poles, only a tiny percentage of their range is necessary. The nodes of all electronic devices a person carries are connected in a similar manner, creating a Personal Area Network (PAN). People access their PAN with their Commlink, a combination personal computer/cell phone/PDA/wireless device available either as a brain implant or a <b>head-mounted</b> <b>display.</b> This access can be the total sensory immersion common to cyberpunk fiction, or a sensory enhancement by which the virtual features of one's physical surroundings can be perceived and manipulated. The Matrix of the 2070s is thus not only a virtual reality, but an augmented or mixed reality. Cyberdecks are obsolete, so [...] "deckers" [...] have once again become [...] "hackers". In turn, the otaku of previous versions (deckers who did not need decks to access the Matrix) have been reworked into technomancers, who possess an innate connection to the Matrix that permits them to access the wireless network without hardware.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{system of}} dichoptic {{presentation}} for binocular vision therapy {{has been proposed}} by researchers of the Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre. Using a modified puzzle video game Tetris, the interocular suppression of patients with amblyopia was successfully treated with dichotomic training in which certain parameters of the training material were systematically adapted {{during the course of}} four weeks. Clinical supervision of such procedures is required to ensure that double vision does not occur. Most of the patients who underwent this treatment gained improved visual acuity of the weaker eye, and some also showed increased stereoacuity. Another study performed at the same institute showed that dichoptic training can be more effective in adults than the more conventional amblyopia treatment of an eye patch. For this investigation, 18 adults played the game Tetris for one hour each day, half of the group wearing eye patches and the other half playing a dichoptic version of the game. After two weeks, the group who played dichoptically showed a significant improvement of vision in the weaker eye and in stereopsis acuity; the eye patch group had moderate improvements, which increased substantially after they, too, were given the dichoptic training afterwards. Dichoptic-based perceptual learning therapy, presented by means of a <b>head-mounted</b> <b>display,</b> is amenable also to amblyopic children, as it improves both the amblyopic eye's visual acuity and the stereo function. The researchers at McGill University have shown that one to three weeks of playing a dichoptic video game for one to two hours on a hand-held device [...] "can improve acuity and restore binocular function, including stereopsis in adults". Furthermore, {{it has been suggested that}} these effect can be enhanced by anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS).|$|E
