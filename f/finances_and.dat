5|$|At one point, {{the prices}} for his {{pictures}} were exceeded only {{by those of}} renowned English artists Joshua Reynolds and Thomas Gainsborough.

5|$|According to Anne Feldhaus, the Morgaon temple {{does not}} pre-date the seventeenth century, when Morya Gosavi popularized it. However, even the dating of Morya Gosavi is disputed and varies from the 13th–14th {{century to the}} 17th century. The {{descendants}} of Morya Gosavi – who were worshipped as Ganesha incarnates at the Chinchwad temple – often visited the Morgaon temple and controlled the <b>finances</b> <b>and</b> administration of many Ashthavinayak temples. The 17th-century saint Samarth Ramdas composed the popular arati song Sukhakarta Dukhaharta, seeing the Morgaon icon.|$|E
5|$|Adams did {{not speak}} French, the {{international}} language of diplomacy at the time. He therefore assumed a less visible role, but emerged as the commission's chief administrator, imposing order and methods lacking in his delegation's <b>finances</b> <b>and</b> record-keeping affairs. His first stay in Europe, between April 1, 1778, and June 17, 1779, was otherwise unremarkable, and {{he returned to his}} home in Braintree in early August 1779. Back home, Adams became one of the founders and charter members of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1780.|$|E
5|$|After resigning the {{presidency}} of MAC in 1879, Clark left academia to become {{the president of a}} mining company, Clark & Bothwell. The company, in operation from 1881 to 1882, purchased several silver mines, mostly in Utah and California. Clark's partner, John R. Bothwell, proved to be corrupt and the company quickly folded, destroying Clark's reputation, his own <b>finances</b> <b>and</b> the fortunes of many of his friends and family. The subsequent scandal ruined Clark's health. He died of heart disease at his home in Amherst in 1886.|$|E

Within a few weeks, he was appointed minister of the First Methodist Church in Jacksonville, Florida, a position he held for the remainder of 1909 and the first half of 1910. Sledd was subsequently invited to return to Southern University as its president, serving from 1910 to 1914. While president of Southern University, he implemented a new pre-college preparatory school and a four-year course of Bible study, and focused his personal efforts on restoring the school's <b>finances</b> <b>and</b> improving the quality of its instruction.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, {{former vice}} {{president}} and presidential candidate Walter Mondale, seen as an underdog, selected Ferraro to be his running mate in the upcoming election. Ferraro became the only Italian American to be a major-party national nominee {{in addition to being}} the first woman. The positive polling the Mondale-Ferraro ticket received when she joined soon faded, as damaging questions arose about her and her businessman husband's <b>finances</b> <b>and</b> wealth and her Congressional disclosure statements. In the general election, Mondale and Ferraro were defeated in a landslide by incumbent President Ronald Reagan and Vice President George H. W. Bush.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} spring Augustus {{suffered}} a severe illness, and on his supposed deathbed made arrangements that would ensure {{the continuation of the}} Principate in some form, while allaying senators' suspicions of his anti-republicanism. Augustus prepared to hand down his signet ring to his favored general Agrippa. However, Augustus handed over to his co-consul Piso all of his official documents, an account of public <b>finances,</b> <b>and</b> authority over listed troops in the provinces while Augustus' supposedly favored nephew Marcellus came away empty-handed. This was a surprise to many who believed Augustus would have named an heir to his position as an unofficial emperor.|$|E
5|$|Life in Nelson {{was hard}} for the colonists. The company had limited <b>finances</b> <b>and</b> {{tightened}} its expenditure which affected the salaries of its employees. In 1844, it had to halt its operations for a time. Although Nelson had 300 landowners, nearly two thirds were absentee owners and only 80 actually lived in the town. Brunner lived at Riwaka, a nearby village, and, in addition to carrying out survey work along the Motueka River, helped {{in the design and}} building of houses in the area. He ended his service with the company in August 1844.|$|E
