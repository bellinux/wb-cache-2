We find that CH 3 OH and C 4 H are positively correlated indicating that these two classes of molecules can coexist during the embedded protostellar stage. The C 4 H/CH 3 OH gas abundance ratio tentatively correlates with the CH 4 /CH 3 OH ice abundance ratio in the same lines of sight.

Gas-phase formation pathways {{for many of}} the observed organics are still uncertain, so that solid-phase syntheses are of interest. Low-temperature reactions are thought to occur within interstellar ices, on ice and grain surfaces in the interstellar medium, and on icy surfaces of solar system objects (e. g. Europa, Pluto). Ionizing radiation, such as cosmic rays, and far-UV photons are two possible initiators of such chemistry. In the Cosmic Ice Lab at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, we can study both the photo-and radiation chemistries of ices at 8 - 300 K. Our most-recent work has been motivated by the detections of ethylene glycol, HOCH 2 CH 2 OH, in an interstellar source (Hollis, Lovas, Jewell, et al. 2002) and in comet Hale-Bopp (Crovisier, Bockelee-Morvan, Biver, et al. 2002).

We observe salt growth at temperatures as low as 15 K, indicating that this reaction is feasible in cold environments. The kinetics of salt growth are best fit by a two-step model involving a slow "pre-reaction" step followed by a fast reaction step. The reaction energy barrier is determined to be 70 ± 30 K with a pre-exponential factor 1. 4 ± 0. 4 x 10 ^- 3 s^- 1. The pre-reaction rate varies under different experimental conditions and likely represents a combination of diffusion and orientation of reactant molecules.

It is likely that a combination of these sources contributed to the building blocks of life on the early Earth. It may even have taken several starts before life surpassed the less than ideal conditions at the surface. What is certain is that once life emerged, it learned to adapt quickly taking advantage of every available refuge and energy source (e. g. photosynthesis and chemosynthesis), an attribute that eventually led to complex metabolic life and even. our own existence. Current experimental research investigating the origin of life is focused on the spontaneous formation of stable polymers out of monomers. However, understanding the spontaneous formation of structure is not enough to understand the formation of life. The introduction and evolution of information and complexity is essential to our definition of life. The formation of complexity and the means to distribute and store information are currently being investigated in a number of theoretical frameworks, such as evolving algorithms, chaos theory and modem evolution theory.

Thanks to {{the combination of the}} high-sensitivities and high-angular resolu- tions provided by the advent of new telescopes such as ALMA and NOEMA, it is now possible to image in details the earliest stages of the Sun-like star formation, thus inspecting the inner (< 50 AU from the protostar) jet. At these spatial scales a proper study of jets has to take into account also the effects connected with the accreting disk. In other words, it is time to study the protostellar jet-disk system as a whole. Several still unanswered questions can be addressed. What is the origin of the chemically enriched hot corinos: are they jet-driven shocked regions? What is the origin of the ejections: are they due to disk or stellar winds? Shocks are precious tool to attack these questions, given they enrich the gas phase with the species deposited onto the dust mantles and/or locked in the refractory dust cores. Basically, {{we have to deal with}} two kind of shocks: (i) high-velocity shocks produced by protostellar jets, and (ii) slow accretion shocks located close to the centrifugal barrier of the accretion disks.

We submitted HMT to asteroidal hydrothermal conditions at 150 °C, for various durations (up to 31 days) and under alkaline pH. Organic products were characterized by gas chromatography mass spectrometry, infrared spectroscopy and synchrotron-based X-ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy. Results show that, within a few days, HMT has evolved into (1) a very diverse suite of soluble compounds dominated by N-bearing aromatic compounds (> 150 species after 31 days), including for instance formamide, pyridine, pyrrole and their polymers (2) an aromatic and N-rich insoluble material that forms after only 7 days of experiment and then remains stable through time.

Also considered are universal protein ancestors from hydrogen cyanide and water, astronomical sources of polarized light and their role in determining molecular chirality on earth, the universal diagrams and life in the universe, the precambrian evolution of terrestrial life and a thermodynamic approach to the occurrance and appearance of galactic life forms. Papers are also presented on the Ohio Seti program, lunar reflections of terrestrial radio leakage, the multichannel spectrum analyzer, software implementation of detection algorithms for the MCSA, the Serendip II design, galactic colonization and competition in a young galactic disk, implications of ancient and future migrations, extraterrestrial intelligence, the ineviability and the possible structures of supercivilizations, planetary, interplanetary and <b>interstellar</b> <b>organic</b> matter, and universal aspects of biological evolution...|$|R

In both cases, the initial intensities of the <b>organic</b> <b>molecules</b> were the highest, followed by a quick decay with increasing sputter dose. The normalized intensities of the <b>organic</b> <b>molecules</b> are also all higher throughout the depth profile of the formaldehyde-fixed cells, consistent with the data presented in Figure  4.|$|R
40|$|<b>Interstellar</b> <b>organic</b> {{chemistry}} is discussed as {{the field of}} study emerging from the discovery of microwave lines of formaldehyde and of hydrogen cyanide in the interstellar medium. The reliability of molecular identifications and comparisons of interstellar and cometary compounds are considered, along with the degradational origin of simple organics. It is {{pointed out that the}} contribution of <b>interstellar</b> <b>organic</b> chemistry to problems in biology is not substantive but analogical. The interstellar medium reveals the operation of chemical processes which, on earth and perhaps on vast numbers of planets throughout the universe, led to the origin of life, but the actual molecules of the interstellar medium are unlikely to play any significant biological role...|$|R
