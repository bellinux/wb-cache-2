5|$|In practice, the MSE <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>blend</b> <b>of</b> empathic {{descriptive}} phenomenology {{and empirical}} clinical observation. It {{has been argued}} that the term phenomenology has become corrupted in clinical psychiatry: current usage, as a set of supposedly objective descriptions of a psychiatric patient (a synonym for signs and symptoms), is incompatible with the original meaning which was concerned with comprehending a patient's subjective experience.|$|E

The two companies later split Seagram's business based on the previously announced framework agreement signed between them.|$|E
5|$|Mumbai's culture <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>blend</b> <b>of</b> {{traditional}} festivals, food, music, and theatres. The city {{offers a}} cosmopolitan and diverse lifestyle {{with a variety}} of food, entertainment, and night life, available in a form and abundance comparable to that in other world capitals. Mumbai's history as a major trading centre has led to a diverse range of cultures, religions, and cuisines coexisting in the city. This unique blend of cultures is due to the migration of people from all over India since the British period.|$|E

5|$|Although early {{assertions of}} a {{distinct}} Mangalorean Catholic identity {{date from the}} migration period, a developed Mangalorean Catholic cultural identity only emerged following the captivity. The culture of Mangalorean Catholics <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>blend</b> <b>of</b> Mangalorean and Goan cultures. After migration, they adopted {{some aspects of the}} local Mangalorean culture, but retained many of their Goan customs and traditions, and like their Goan ancestors, modern Mangalorean Catholic culture can be best described as an increasingly Anglicised Indo-Latin culture. The Mangalorean Catholic diaspora is mostly concentrated in the Arab states of the Persian Gulf and the English-speaking world.|$|E
5|$|Bollywood, the Hindi film {{industry}} based in Mumbai, produces around 150–200 films every year. The name Bollywood <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>blend</b> <b>of</b> Bombay and Hollywood. The 2000s saw a growth in Bollywood's popularity overseas. This led filmmaking {{to new heights}} in terms of quality, cinematography and innovative story lines as well as technical advances such as special effects and animation. Studios in Goregaon, including Film City, are the location for most movie sets. The city also hosts the Marathi {{film industry}} which has seen increased popularity in recent years, and TV production companies.|$|E
5|$|Ninja Gaiden {{is set in}} {{the game}} world of the Dead or Alive series. Located mainly in Japan and the fictional Vigoor Empire, the game draws on Heian period {{structures}} for its Japanese locales—a ninja fortress and village set in the mountains. In contrast the Vigoor Empire, with its capital city of Tairon, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>blend</b> <b>of</b> architectural types from around the world. European-style buildings display Arabic lettering, and the monastery in Tairon exhibits Gothic influences with a vaulted hall, pointed arches, and large stained glass windows. A hidden underground level features statues with the heads of cats, walls covered with carvings, hieroglyphics, Aztec pyramid and a labyrinth. This mix of styles was the result of Itagaki's deliberate refusal to constrain the game's creative process.|$|E

5|$|The {{cultural}} heritage of Slavonia <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>blend</b> <b>of</b> historical influences, especially those {{since the end}} of the 17th century, when Slavonia started recovering from the Ottoman wars, and its traditional culture. Slavonia contributed to the culture of Croatia, through art, writers, poets and art patronage. In traditional music, Slavonia is a distinct region of Croatia, and the traditional culture is preserved through folklore festivals, with prominence given to tamburica music and bećarac, a form of traditional song, recognized as an intangible {{cultural heritage}} by UNESCO. The cuisine of Slavonia reflects diverse influences—a blend of traditional and foreign elements. Slavonia is one of Croatia's winemaking areas, with Ilok and Kutjevo recognized as centres of wine production.|$|E
5|$|These {{scattering}} methods generally use monochromatic X-rays, {{which are}} restricted to a single wavelength with minor deviations. A broad spectrum of X-rays (that <b>is,</b> <b>a</b> <b>blend</b> <b>of</b> X-rays with different wavelengths) {{can also be used}} to carry out X-ray diffraction, a technique known as the Laue method. This is the method used in the original discovery of X-ray diffraction. Laue scattering provides much structural information with only a short exposure to the X-ray beam, and is therefore used in structural studies of very rapid events (Time resolved crystallography). However, it is not as well-suited as monochromatic scattering for determining the full atomic structure of a crystal and therefore works better with crystals with relatively simple atomic arrangements.|$|E
5|$|Royal Stag, {{also known}} as Seagram's Royal Stag, is a brand of whisky {{launched}} in 1995. It is available in many countries across the world in various pack sizes and {{has emerged as a}} global brand of whisky from the house of Seagram’s. It is Pernod Ricard's best selling brand by volume. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>blend</b> <b>of</b> finest grain spirits and imported Scotch malts. It is commonly available in 1L, 750ml, 375ml and 180ml bottles and also available in 90ml and 60ml bottles. The brand is named after a species of deer famous for its antlers, that is also featured in its logo. It is produced in several company-owned as well as bottler-owned distilleries. It was the first whisky brand launched in India that did not use any artificial flavours.|$|E

5|$|The palace <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>blend</b> <b>of</b> {{architectural}} styles; {{its ancient}} origins are indicated {{by a lack}} of symmetry. Thus to evaluate the architecture, wings and blocks have to be observed separately. The principal façade appears as a terrace of Renaissance style palazzi from differing periods of the Renaissance era (Illustrations 1 and 12) which—even though they form only one palace—is exactly what they are. These wings are however united by their common rusticated ground floor. This Renaissance architecture seems to mask earlier fortifications, the towers of which rise behind the differing classical façades. These towers—many complete with crenellations and machicolations—were actually mostly rebuilt during the 19th century. At the rear of the palace the original medieval fortifications seem untouched by time. (Illustration 4). A greater architectural harmony has been achieved within the court of honour around which the palace is built, where two tiers of frescoed open arcades serve as both a ceremonial balcony for the prince's appearances and a state entrance and corridor linking the formal state rooms of the palace.|$|E
5|$|When Sir William Sharington {{purchased}} {{the remains of}} the Augustinian nunnery in 1540, after the dissolution, he built a country house on the cloister court. He retained the cloisters and the medieval basement largely unaltered and built another storey above, so that the main rooms are on the first floor. The house is constructed of ashlar and rubble stone, the roofs are of stone slates and there are many twisted, sixteenth century chimney stacks. The house <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>blend</b> <b>of</b> different styles but lacks a cohesive plan; the four wings of the house are built above the cloister passages, but the house cannot be entered from the cloisters, and the cloisters cannot be seen from inside the house. The abbey underwent substantial alterations in the Gothic Revival style in the 1750s, under the ownership of John Ivory Talbot. The great hall was redesigned during this period, the architect being Sanderson Miller.|$|E
5|$|Under {{appellation}} rules, around 4,000 kilograms (8,800 pounds) {{of grapes}} can be pressed to create up to 673 gallons (either 2,550 L or 3,060 L) of juice. The first 541 gallons (either 2,050 L or 2,460 L) are the cuvée {{and the next}} 132 gallons (either 500 L or 600 L) are the taille. Prior to 1992, a second taille of 44 gallons (either 167 L or 200 L) was previously allowed. For vintage Champagne, 100% of the grapes must come from that vintage year while non-vintage wine <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>blend</b> <b>of</b> vintages. Vintage champagne must spend {{a minimum of three}} years of aging. There are no regulations about how long it must spend on its lees, but some of the premier Champagne houses keep their wines on lees for upwards of five to ten years. Non-vintage Champagne must spend a minimum of 15 months of aging but only a minimum of 12 months on the lees. Most of the Champagne houses keep their wines on the lees through the whole time of aging because it is more expense to bottle the wine then age it and finally shipped.|$|E
