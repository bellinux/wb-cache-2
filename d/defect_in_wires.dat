The wires showed pronounced necking at fracture. The coarser wires with diameters > 50 mu m exhibited conventional ductile cup-cone fracture, with dimples {{in the central}} zone and peripheral shear lips, whereas finer wires failed by shear with knife or chisel-edge fractures. Shear bands were observed in all samples. Further, through- section microscopy of selected fractured samples revealed that the shear bands did not go across the enitre specimen for the coarser wires. The shear bands led to grain fragmention, with a reduction in grain aspect ratio as well as rotations away from the initial orientations. The strength data were analysed based on a Weibull approach. The data could be rationalized in terms of failure from volume <b>defects</b> <b>in</b> coarser <b>wires,</b> with a high Weibull modulus, and from surface <b>defects</b> <b>in</b> finer <b>wires,</b> with a low Weibull modulus and greater variability.

Do atom wires exist that are metallic (at low temperatures) ? What role is played by <b>defects</b> <b>in</b> these atom <b>wires?</b> This Thesis attempts to find an answer to these questions.

Using Scanning Tunneling Microscopy and Spectroscopy combined with Density Functional Theory calculations, a full analysis of the (thermodynamic) stability of Gallium (Ga) atom wires on Si(112) has been made, including the energetics of fluctuating intrinsic structural defects. It is shown that the stable atom wires fully passivate the surface, and that the spacing between intrinsic quasi- 1 D meandering vacancy lines can be tuned continuously through experimental adjustment of the Ga chemical potential.

The difficulty arises in analyzing the inner coil signals, which detects the signals from wear, nicks and broken wire, which cannot be distinguished if they are of the same magnitude.

40|$|One-dimensional {{semiconductor}} nanostructures {{have attracted}} much attention because of their potential applications {{in the design of}} novel electronic, photonic, and sensing devices. Due to their high mobility of electrons and holes, Ge nanowires are particularly attractive for high-speed field-effect transistors. Moreover, Ge nanowires are potentially useful for building quantum bits because of a long decoherence time due to a predominance of spin-zero nuclei and the advantage of a large excitonic Bohr radius (24. 3 nm) which allows the quantum confinement to be observed for relatively large structures and at high temperatures. To realize these applications on a large scale, one of the key challenges is to develop a convenient and parallel method to align bottom-up nanowires into complex patterns or structures.

No clear reason for the failure has been found, but some material <b>defects</b> <b>in</b> the <b>wires</b> could be part of the reason. If the wires continue to fracture with the same rate as today, the main cables have to be maintained more often, and maybe changed much earlier than they were planned for in the beginning. Therefore, the bridge should be further analyzed, to detect any other reasons for the wire fractures, and to determine how and when the main cables should be maintained or changed. A new finite element model is created in ABAQUS, and an eigen value analysis of the bridge model is carried out. A brief analysis of the fractures in light of the weather around the bridge is given. The main components of a suspension bridge are described, and analytical calculations are done based on equations from Bleich and Steinman to verify the results from ABAQUS and Alvsat. The bridge behavior during wind loading was briefly checked, and the displacement from wind load, from a 50 year wind speed, on the bridge has been examined. The loading from this wind speed, with coefficients that take into account different angles of the bridge girder, has been created in ABAQUS, through several iterations. The eigenfrequency analysis done in ABAQUS and the analytical calculations give results that are in the same range as the ones from the original analysis done in Alvsat.

Very {{little is known about}} the molecular mechanism underlying these processes. Recent studies have suggested a potential role of Rho GTPases as intracellular regulators of several ENS developmental processes. However, the relative participation of specific members of the family in migration, neurogenesis and axonal guidance of enteric progenitors has not been addressed yet. Here, we investigate the in vivo role and genetic interaction of two members of the Rho-GTPase family, Rac 1 and Rac 3 in enteric neurogenesis. Taking advantage of the Cre/loxP recombination system and a Rac 1 conditional inactivation mouse strain (Rac 1 flox/flox), we generated a Sox 10 Cre; Rac 1 flox/flox;R 26 ReYFP mouse line, where Rac 1 gene is specifically ablated in the neural crest population which is also labeled by the expression of Yellow Fluorescent Protein. Secondly, we generated double Rac 1;Rac 3 mutant animals by crossing the Sox 10 Cre;Rac 1 flox;R 26 ReYFP mouse line to a constitutive Rac 3 KO strain (Rac 3 -/-). In vivo and in vitro studies on Rac-deficient enteric neural crest cells and neurons showed distinctive roles for Rac 1 and Rac 3 in migration of enteric neural crest cells (ENCCs), in development of enteric neurons and in control of cell polarity within the developing ENS. In addition, we also undertook a candidate gene approach to investigate the involvement of Wnt-signaling genes in enteric axon guidance and circuit formation. We found that two of the core components of the Planar Cell Polarity pathway, the Wnt receptor Frizzled 3 (Fzd 3) and the Cadherin EGF LAG seven-pass G-type receptor 3 (Celsr 3) are expressed specifically in ENCCs during embryonic development. Here we show, by using a combination of in vivo approaches that in mice deficient in either protein, enteric neurons had characteristic <b>defects</b> <b>in</b> neuronal tract formation and in patterning of individual axonal projections evident from early stages of ENS development. Furthermore, preliminary data show that these specific <b>defects</b> <b>in</b> ENS <b>wiring</b> might be the cause of impaired intestinal function and, therefore, provide the basis for understanding the aetiopathology of several idiopathic enteric neuropathies in humans...|$|R

40|$|REACT Project: The University of Houston {{will develop}} a low-cost, high-current superconducting wire {{that could be used}} in {{high-power}} wind generators. Superconducting wire currently transports 600 times more electric current than a similarly sized copper wire, but is significantly more expensive. The University of Houston’s innovation is based on engineering nanoscale <b>defects</b> <b>in</b> the superconducting film. This could quadruple the current relative to today’s superconducting wires, supporting the same amount of current using 25 % of the material. This would make wind generators lighter, more powerful and more efficient. The design could result in a several-fold reduction <b>in</b> <b>wire</b> costs and enable their commercial viability of high-power wind generators for use in offshore applications...|$|R
