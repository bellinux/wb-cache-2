25|$|In Either/Or, A and Judge William {{each has}} one epistolary novel in two volumes. The A is an aesthete {{well aware that}} he can {{use the power of}} {{interpretation}} to define who he <b>is</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> takes to be valuable. He knows he can shape and reshape his own self-identity. Nothing binds him to his relationships. Nothing binds him to his past actions. In the end though, he also knows he lacks a consistent understanding of who he is. He lacks a self that resists his own power of reinterpretation. His older friend Judge William, argues that a deeper concept of selfhood is discovered as one commits to one's actions, and takes ownership of the past and present. A concept of oneself, as this particular human being, begins to take form in one's own consciousness.|$|E
500|$|Baba {{described}} the Avatar as [...] "a gauge against which man can measure what he <b>is</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> may become. He trues {{the standard of}} human values by interpreting {{them in terms of}} divinely human life." ...|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Fabricant warns Black that he {{was taken}} from the {{hospital}} and operated on by the [...] "sum of all evil"; Fabricant also warns that this entity knows who Black <b>is</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> is capable of. Returning home, Black discovers that Butler was arrested elsewhere for a motoring offence, but was released without charge. Black takes his daughter Jordan hiking over the same North Cascades trail he and Bletcher had visited earlier.|$|E

500|$|Roger Ebert of The Chicago Sun Times {{rated the}} film as the best of 2009, writing, [...] "The Hurt Locker is a great film, an {{intelligent}} film, a film shot clearly so that we know exactly who everybody is {{and where they are}} and what they're doing and why." [...] He applauded how the suspense was built, calling the film [...] "spellbinding." [...] Ebert considered Renner [...] "a leading contender for Academy Awards," [...] writing, [...] "His performance is not built on complex speeches but on a visceral projection of who this man <b>is</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> feels. He is not a hero in a conventional sense." [...] He eventually ranked it the second-best film of the decade, behind only Synecdoche, New York.|$|E
500|$|Harrison's {{staging of}} the two benefit concerts {{enhanced}} his standing as {{the most popular of}} the former Beatles; Doggett describes him as having become [...] "arguably music's most influential figure" [...] over this period. In a laudatory review of the Concert for Bangladesh album, for Rolling Stone, Jon Landau described [...] "Wah-Wah" [...] as [...] "a simple statement by a musician who knows who he <b>is</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> wants to play". Like Rodriguez, who considers that the song [...] "truly [...] into its own" [...] that day, Andrew Grant Jackson views this live reading as superior to the studio recording. He writes: [...] "The live version is a notch slower, and the cleaner mix allows breathing room to hear the space between the instruments. And more importantly, there's the euphoria of the performance itself." ...|$|E
500|$|Just {{as little}} is known about Jesus during his middle years, Clark travels into the {{wilderness}} to find out who he <b>is</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> has to do. Jor-El says, [...] "Live as one of them, Kal-El, to discover where your strength and power are needed. But always hold in your heart the pride of your special heritage. They can be a great people, Kal-El, and they wish to be. They only lack the light to show the way. For this reason above all, their capacity for good, I have sent them you, my only son." [...] The theme resembles the Biblical account of God sending his only son Jesus to Earth in hope for the good of mankind.

500|$|When Steven S. DeKnight {{was writing}} the episode [...] "Run" [...] {{for the first}} {{official}} appearance of Bart Allen, {{he knew he had}} to give the character certain characteristics that embodied his comic book counterpart. DeKnight knew Bart had faster than Clark, because in the comic, that is one advantage Flash has over Superman. DeKnight also featured Bart as a [...] "smart-ass", after being inspired by the sarcastic Flash that appears in the animated television series, Justice League. DeKnight's belief is that Bart enjoys his powers, and would not exhibit the more [...] "somber or serious" [...] characteristics of other character. As Gallner pointed out, Bart accepts who he <b>is,</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> can do, and he even abuses his gifts somewhat. The difference between him and Clark is that Bart is not afraid to show the world what he can do. Gallner also suggested that in his character's initial appearance, Bart is living in a [...] "confused" [...] state, because he has developed these extraordinary powers, his parents do not accept him, and he ends up turning to thievery just to take care of himself.|$|E
2500|$|... "For here is {{the chief}} and most {{confounding}} objection to excessive skepticism, that no durable good can ever result from it; while it remains in its full force and vigor. We need only ask such a skeptic, What his meaning <b>is?</b> <b>And</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> proposes by all these curious researches? He is immediately at a loss, and knows not what to answer... a Pyrrhonian cannot expect, that his philosophy will have any constant influence on the mind: or if it had, that its influence would be beneficial to society. On the contrary, he must acknowledge, if he will acknowledge anything, that all human life must perish, were his principles universally and steadily to prevail." [...] (Hume 1974:426) ...|$|E
2500|$|In Roman Catholic {{theology}} {{the study}} of Mary, while contributing to {{the study of}} Christ, is also a separate discipline in its own right, with an understanding of the figure of Mary contributing to a fuller understanding of who Christ <b>is</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> did. The Congregation for Catholic Education has characterized the situation as follows: [...] "The history of theology shows that an understanding of the mystery of the Virgin contributes to a more profound understanding of the mystery of Christ, of the Church and of the vocation of man." [...] Referring to this, Cardinal Raymond Burke stated that the promotion of a fuller knowledge of the Virgin Mary is the [...] "constant work of the Church".|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{its many}} {{institutional}} forms, the function {{and structure of}} ideology is unchanging and present throughout history; as Althusser states, [...] "ideology has no history". All ideologies constitute a subject, even though {{he or she may}} differ according to each particular ideology. Memorably, Althusser illustrates this with the concept of [...] "hailing" [...] or [...] "interpellation". Drawing heavily from Jacques Lacan and his concept of the Mirror Stage, he compares ideology to a policeman shouting [...] "Hey you there!" [...] toward a person walking on the street. Upon hearing this call, the person responds by turning around and in doing so, is transformed into a subject. The person is conscious of being a subject and aware of the other person. Thus, for Althusser, being aware of other people is a form of ideology. Within that, Althusser sees subjectivity as a type of ideology. The person being hailed recognizes himself or herself as the subject of the hail, and knows to respond. Althusser calls this recognition a [...] "mis-recognition" [...] (m√©connaissance), because it works retroactively: a material individual is always already an ideological subject, even before he or she is born. The [...] "transformation" [...] of an individual into a subject has always already happened; Althusser here acknowledges a debt to Spinoza's theory of immanence. To highlight this, Althusser offers the example of Christian religious ideology, embodied in the Voice of God, instructing a person on what his place in the world <b>is</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> must do to be reconciled with Christ. From this, Althusser draws the point that in order for that person to identify as a Christian, he must first already be a subject; that is, by responding to God's call and following His rules, he affirms himself as a free agent, the author of the acts for which he assumes responsibility. We cannot recognize ourselves outside ideology, and in fact, our very actions reach out to this overarching structure. For Althusser, we acquire our identities by seeing ourselves mirrored in ideologies.|$|E
