25|$|Delaware's {{swing to}} the <b>Democrats</b> <b>is</b> {{in part due}} to a strong Democratic trend in New Castle County, home to 55 percent of Delaware's {{population}} (the two smaller counties have only 359,000 people between them to New Castle's 535,000). New Castle has not voted Republican in a presidential election since 1988. In 1992, 2000, 2004, and 2016, the Republican presidential candidate carried both Kent and Sussex but lost by double-digits each time in New Castle, which was a large enough margin to swing the state to the Democrats. New Castle also elects a substantial majority of the legislature; 27 of the 41 state house districts and 14 of the 21 state senate districts are based in New Castle.|$|E

He tells Josh to [...] "throw an elbow" [...] and threaten to leak the fact that Buckland tried to blackmail the president. In the end, Josh ends up striking a compromise, while it is Toby and Sam who [...] "throw an elbow" [...] by turning down Democratic Congressman Kimble and offering the same deal to moderate Republican Congressman Robert Royce instead.|$|E

500|$|The {{move towards}} greater {{involvement}} in political {{issues and the}} increasing popularity of the show in certain key demographics have led to examinations of where {{the views of the}} show fit in the political spectrum. Adam Clymer, among many others, has argued that The Daily Show is more critical of Republicans than Democrats. Stewart, who voted Democratic in the 2004 presidential election, acknowledged that the show has a more liberal point of view, but that it is not [...] "a liberal organization" [...] with a political agenda and its duty first and foremost is to be funny. He acknowledges that the show is not necessarily an [...] "equal opportunity offender", explaining that Republicans tended to provide more comedic fodder because [...] "I think we consider those with power and influence targets and those without it, not." [...] In an interview in 2005, when asked how he responded to critics claiming that The Daily Show is overly liberal, Stephen Colbert, also a self-proclaimed Democrat, said in an interview during the Bush Administration, when the Republicans held a majority in the House and Senate: [...] "We are liberal, but Jon's very respectful of the Republican guests, and, listen, if liberals were in power {{it would be easier to}} attack them, but Republicans have the executive, legislative and judicial branches, so making fun of <b>Democrats</b> <b>is</b> like kicking a child, so it's just not worth it." ...|$|E
2500|$|LGBT Americans {{typically}} vote Democratic {{in national}} elections within the 70–77% range, according to national media exit polling. In heavily gay precincts {{in large cities}} across the nation, the average was higher, ranging from 85–94%. This trend has continued since 1996, when Bill Clinton won 71% of the LGBT vote compared to Bob Dole's 16% and 13% for others. In 2000, Al Gore won 70% to George W. Bush's 25% with 5% for others, in 2004 John Kerry won 77% to George W. Bush's 23%, in 2008 Barack Obama won 70% to John McCain's 27% with 3% to others and in 2012 Barack Obama won 76% to Mitt Romney's 22% with 2% to others. Patrick Egan, a professor of politics at New York University specializing in LGBT voting patterns, calls this a [...] "remarkable continuity". Saying [...] "about three-fourths vote Democratic and one-fourth Republican from year to year." [...] Notable LGBT Democrats include current Senator Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin and current Representatives Jared Polis of Colorado and David Cicilline of Rhode Island. The late activist and San Francisco Supervisor Harvey Milk was a Democrat as is former Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts.

6000|$|Mr. Speaker, I see I {{have but}} three minutes left, and this forces me {{to throw out}} one whole branch of my subject. A single word on still another. The Democrats are keen enough to {{frequently}} remind us that we have some dissensions in our ranks. Our good friend from Baltimore immediately before me [Mr. McLane] expressed some doubt the other day as to which branch of our party General Taylor would ultimately {{fall into the hands}} of. That was a new idea to me. I knew we had dissenters, but I did not know {{they were trying to get}} our candidate away from us. I would like to say a word to our dissenters, but I have not the time. Some such we certainly have; have you none, gentlemen <b>Democrats?</b> <b>Is</b> it all union and harmony in your ranks? no bickerings? no divisions? If there be doubt as to which of our divisions will get our candidate, is there no doubt as to which of your candidates will get your party? I have heard some things from New York; and if they are true, one might well say of your party there, as a drunken fellow once said when he heard the reading of an indictment for hog-stealing. The clerk read on till he got to and through the words, [...] "did steal, take, and carry away ten boars, ten sows, ten shoats, and ten pigs," [...] at which he exclaimed, [...] "Well, by golly, that is the most equally divided gang of hogs I ever did hear of!" [...] If there is any other gang of hogs more equally divided than the Democrats of New York are about this time, I have not heard of it.|$|E

25|$|A Conservative <b>Democrat</b> <b>is</b> {{a member}} of the Democratic Party with {{conservative}} political views, or with views relatively conservative with respect to those of the national party. While such members of the Democratic Party can be found throughout the nation, actual elected officials are disproportionately found within the Southern states, {{and to a lesser extent}} within rural regions of the United States generally, more commonly in the West.

6000|$|Liberalism in England is {{not quite}} the same thing as Liberalism {{in the rest of the}} world; it is woven of two strands. There is Whiggism, the {{powerful}} tradition of seventeenth-century Protestant and republican England, with its great debt to republican Rome, its strong constructive and disciplinary bias, its broad and originally very living and intelligent outlook; and interwoven with this there is the sentimental and logical Liberalism that sprang from the stresses of the eighteenth century, that finds its early scarce differentiated expression in Harrington's Oceana, and after fresh draughts of the tradition of Brutus and Cato and some elegant trifling with noble savages, budded in La Cite Morellyste, flowered in the emotional democratic naturalism of Rousseau, and bore abundant fruit in the French Revolution. These are two very distinct strands. Directly they were freed in America from the grip of conflict with British Toryism, they came apart as the Republican and Democratic parties respectively. Their continued union in Great Britain is a political accident. Because of this mixture, the whole career of English-speaking Liberalism, though it has gone to one unbroken strain of eloquence, has never produced a clear statement of policy in relation to other peoples politically less fortunate. It has developed no definite ideas at all about the future of mankind. The Whig disposition, which once had some play in India, was certainly to attempt to anglicise the [...] "native," [...] to assimilate his culture, and then to assimilate his political status with that of his temporary ruler. But interwoven with this anglicising tendency, which was also, by the bye, a Christianising tendency, was a strong disposition, derived from the Rousseau strand, to leave other peoples alone, to facilitate even the separation and autonomy of detached portions of our own peoples, to disintegrate finally into perfect, because lawless, individuals. The official exposition of British [...] "Liberalism" [...] to-day still wriggles unstably because of these conflicting constituents, but on the whole the Whig strand now seems the weaker. The contemporary Liberal politician offers cogent criticism upon the brutality and conceit of modern imperialisms, but that seems to be the limit of his service. Taking what they do not say and do not propose as an indication of Liberal intentions, it would seem that the ideal of the British Liberals and of the American <b>Democrats</b> <b>is</b> to favour the existence of just as many petty, loosely allied, or quite independent nationalities as possible, just as many languages as possible, to deprecate armies and all controls, and to trust to the innate goodness of disorder and the powers of an ardent sentimentality to keep the world clean and sweet. The Liberals will not face the plain consequence that such a state of affairs is hopelessly unstable, that it involves the maximum risk of war with the minimum of permanent benefit and public order. They will not reflect that the stars in their courses rule inexorably against it. It is a vague, impossible ideal, with a rude sort of unworldly moral beauty, like the gospel of the Doukhobors. Besides that charm it has this most seductive quality to an official British Liberal, that it does not exact intellectual activity nor indeed activity of any sort whatever. It is, by virtue of that alone, a far less mischievous doctrine than the crude and violent Imperialism of the popular Press.|$|E
