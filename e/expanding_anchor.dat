40|$|Abstract. Anchor text {{has been}} shown to be {{effective}} in ranking[6] and a variety of information retrieval tasks on web pages. Some authors have <b>expanded</b> on <b>anchor</b> text by using the words around the anchor tag, a link-context, but each with a different definition of link-context. This lack of consensus begs the question: What is a good link-context? The two experiments in this paper address the question by comparing the results of using different link-contexts for the problem of ranking. Specifically, we concatenate the link-contexts of links pointing to a web page to create a link-context document used to rank that web page. By comparing the ranking order resulting from using different link-contexts, we found that smaller contexts are effective at ranking relevant urls highly. ...|$|R

The site is targeted as a "focal point for development" to become "more of a destination" and a "gateway" for the city. Although boasting ideal accessibility and panoramic views of Manhattan, the area exists as a gap along the Hudson River waterfront. It should be a social destination, a Transit-Oriented Development, and a link between the two <b>expanding</b> neighborhoods. <b>Anchoring</b> the plan will be a minor league ballpark just south of the Hoboken Terminal in Jersey City.

A new anchor-selection / expansion approach to compute an initial matching {{is presented in the}} paper. We give heuristics to select a small number of important anchors using a new similarity score, which measures how two nodes in two different graphs are similar to be matched by taking both global and local information of nodes into consideration. And then by <b>expanding</b> from the <b>anchors</b> selected we work out a good initial matching. The expansion is based on structural similarity among the neighbors of nodes in two graphs.

40|$|International audienceThe Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale was {{initially}} {{developed as a}} rapid method to assess symptom change in psychiatric inpatients of various diagnoses. The original version was expanded to an 18 -item version and thereafter to a 24 -item version to increase sensitivity to {{a broader range of}} psychotic and affective symptoms. The latest version of the expanded 24 - item BPRS provides probe questions and detailed anchor points for the ratings for each item. Studies have shown the <b>expanded</b> and <b>anchored</b> 24 -item BPRS to be a sensitive and effective measure of psychiatric symptoms with good interrater reliability that can be maintained over time. To our knowledge, there are eight published papers including factor analyses of the BPRS-E(A). While many similarities are evident between these studies, inconsistencies are apparent that may have been due to sample size, characteristics and / or methodological differences in the factor analysis computation. Among these studies, six provided a four-factor solution. There was no French version of this scale available. After its translation into French and back translation, we investigated the validity of the French BPRS-E(A) version. We carried out a component analysis on the data of 111 participants of various diagnoses, mostly hospitalised for a first psychotic episode, yielding to a three-factor solution (positive symptoms [...] disorganisation; depression-anxiety and negative symptoms). A good internal consistency and interrater reliability were found. These results confirm the psychometric value of the BPRS-E(A) in its French version. We compared those findings to earlier reports; similarities and differences are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the advent}} of {{wide-angle}} imaging of the inner heliosphere, a plethora of techniques {{have been developed to}} investigate the three-dimensional structure and kinematics of solar wind transients, such as coronal mass ejections, from their signatures in single- and multi-spacecraft imaging observations. These techniques, which range from the highly complex and computationally intensive to methods based on simple curve ﬁtting, all have their inherent advantages and limitations. In the analysis of single-spacecraft imaging observations, much use has been made of the ﬁxed φ ﬁtting (FPF) and harmonic mean ﬁtting (HMF) techniques, in which the solar wind transient {{is considered to be a}} radially propagating point source (ﬁxed φ, FP, model) and a radially <b>expanding</b> circle <b>anchored</b> at Sun centre (harmonic mean, HM, model), respectively. Initially, we compare the radial speeds and propagation directions derived from application of the FPF and HMF techniques to a large set of STEREO/Heliospheric Imager (HI) observations. As the geometries on which these two techniques are founded constitute extreme descriptions of solar wind transients in terms of their extent along the line of sight, we describe a single-spacecraft ﬁtting technique based on a more generalized model for which the FP and HM geometries form the limiting cases. In addition to providing estimates of a transient’s speed and propagation direction, the self-similar expansion ﬁtting (SSEF) technique provides, in theory, the capability to estimate the transient’s angular extent in the plane orthogonal to the ﬁeld of view. Using the HI observations, and also by performing a Monte Carlo simulation, we assess the potential of the SSEF technique...|$|R
40|$|Digital brain atlases are {{valuable}} and increasingly widespread tools, serving various purposes in {{the scope of}} clinical subspecialities like neurology or neuroradiology. Atlases with similar purposes can be considerably different in many properties such as digital representation, delineation method, nomenclature or coordinate-system and the used standard template. Although the number of available brain atlases shows a significant increase {{and some of these}} have also been integrated within popular software tools, the general support of this technique by information systems is still poorly accomplished. 	 	 The purpose of our work was to create a uniform framework handling most of the web-accessible human and animal anatomical brain atlases and deploy a user-friendly application and utility package based on this framework; furthermore, to apply the Multi Modal Medical Imaging software library developed in the Institute of Nuclear Medicine, Debrecen. A uniform brain atlas concept was defined to describe deterministic, hierarchical, probabilistic and maximum probability brain atlases. All of the integrated atlases were expanded with calculating so-called multi-level Maximum Probability Maps, and Region-of-Interest data-sets for each region of the atlas. Numerous utilities were developed to perform the uniforming and the <b>expanding</b> procedure. 	 	 After <b>anchoring</b> important conventions and rules, such as naming-conventions and file formats describing the atlases, a multi-platform localization and region analysis software, called BrainLOC, was developed, which can handle all of the integrated atlases through a user friendly graphical interface. It can be used for interactive loci identification and editing, and perform region-based analysis of functional images assisted by any of the integrated atlases. The Anatomy Fiber Tracts and CYTO Anatomy Atlas (Research Center Jülich), Cerebellar atlas constructed by Diedrichsen et al. (FLIRT and FNIRT version), Harvard-Oxford Cortical and Subcortical Structural, ICBM-DTI 81, JHU White-Matter Tractography, Juelich Histological, LONI neonatal Mouse, LPBA- 40, Oxford Thalamic Connectivity, MNI Structural and different versions of the Talairach Atlas were so far integrated to our framework. régi képzésProgramtervező matematiku...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents an}} inquiry into the roles played by persistent, shared external representations in design collaboration. It advances {{an understanding of the}} active participation of these representations—including drawings, models and prototypes—in the collective reasoning of design teams. Interaction was analyzed using a novel network formalization to portray the accomplishment of essential work in this context. A synthesis of analyses over different time scales provides the basis for a comprehensive notion of representational support for design interaction, and a diagnostic for problems that may arise with inadequate support and/or disparities of access and participation. Data were collected during working sessions of a leading, “real-time” concurrent design practice at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, notable for accelerated performance and the use of technologically-advanced, shared representations. Fine-grained analysis of this activity offers insights to complement those obtained from laboratory studies of individual designers, ad-hoc groups, and organizationally-situated ethnographic accounts. A microanalytic technique was developed to assess dynamic interaction between participants and representations. The resulting, novel formalization of an actor-discourse network makes concepts derived from actor-network theory operational to understand the work accomplished through design interaction. Network visualization and structural metrics highlight patterns associated with productivity in the design process. On this basis, indicators for the quality of design conversation are proposed: these include the degree of participants’ engagement, the development of design discourse, the integration of representations and the consolidation of commitment to action. Specific roles and situational attributes of representations are identified that foster and sustain advances in collective design reasoning. The dissertation advances a view of design activity in terms of temporally-evolving constellations of issues and actors, in which representations act to stabilize and <b>anchor</b> <b>expanding</b> networks of commitment. Directions for further work include technical enhancement to network metrics and visualization, extension of the actor-discourse network formalization and further exploration of theoretical and practical issues pertaining to representational actors in social situations.
