25|$|With {{a record}} of 1-2-1 that year, he entered the Grand Prix in {{relatively}} poor form but qualified for the final eight nonetheless with a win over Pierre Guénette at K-1 Grand Prix '97 1st Round on September 7, 1997, putting away the Canadian taekwondo exponent with three knockdowns inside the first round. The round of eight went down on November 9 and saw the rubber match between Andy Hug and Masaaki Satake in the quarter-finals <b>go</b> <b>just</b> fifteen seconds as the Swiss dispatched his Japanese foe with a high kick. In the semis, Hug drew Peter Aerts and avenged his loss to the Dutchman eight months prior with a unanimous judges' decision victory. Having fought his way through to the final, he then lost to Ernesto Hoost by unanimous decision in the third of their four matches.|$|E
25|$|Both teams {{went into}} the semi-final first leg with {{identical}} records in this season's Champions League, each having won eight games and drawn two, while scoring 18 goals and conceding five. United were awarded a penalty three minutes into the game, after Gabriel Milito handled Cristiano Ronaldo's header from a corner. Ronaldo himself stepped up to take the kick, but, despite sending Víctor Valdés the wrong way, smacked his shot against the post. The missed penalty seemed to give Barcelona the extra impetus they needed, {{and they began to}} take control of the game. Just before the half-hour, Ronaldo made a break into the Barça penalty area, only to be bodychecked by Rafael Márquez, who made no attempt to get to the ball. Rightfully expecting another penalty to be awarded, the look of dismay on Ronaldo's face was justified when he saw referee Massimo Busacca wave play on. Márquez fouled Ronaldo again just before half time, this time about 25yards from goal. Márquez was shown a yellow card for his trouble, which meant he was ineligible for the second leg on 29 April, but Ronaldo saw his resulting free kick <b>go</b> <b>just</b> a yard wide of the far post. A number of saves from Van der Sar and a Michael Carrick block kept Barcelona at bay, while Carrick himself came close to scoring at the other end, rippling the side-netting after making space for himself on the left side of the penalty area. The match finished as a scoreless draw, with Barcelona having had the better of the possession, but with the second leg being played at Old Trafford, United had every reason to be confident.|$|E
25|$|The 86 riders {{remaining}} in the race took off from the Al Thakhira harbour. It would be another day across the peninsula {{under the influence of}} strong winds. Despite several attempts, the pack remained bunched all the way to Al Zubara, north-west of Qatar. The first hour had an avarege speed of 48 kilometres per hour. The first bonus sprint was won by Kirsten Wild As the pack headed up north and the wind started blowing sideways, several riders failed {{to keep up with the}} pace. While a crash occurred in the peloton, a group of 18 ladies pulled away including race leader Chloe Hosking, Ellen van Dijk, Wild, Gracie Elvin, and Trixi Worrack. The front group enjoyed a 40” lead at km 83 on a group of 22 including Cromwell, Gilmour and Bronzini. With 25 kilometres to go, as the riders entered the final circuit, the first two groups bunched up together again. 8 riders gave it a go but where rapidly caught before reaching Madinat Al Shamal for the second bonus sprint won by Lisa Brennauer ahead of Chantal Blaak, who had both broken away just before crossing the line. Wild powered to third spot ahead of the pack, 5” adrift. With 10 kilometres to go, Brennauer and Blaak could still enjoy a 10” lead. Both were first caught by Fahlin and Cantele and then by the whole golden jersey group with 5 kilometres to <b>go.</b> <b>Just</b> under 40 riders moved closer to the finish line. With under 3 kilometres to go, race leader Hosking suffered a puncture. Despite being eventually given the winner’s time, she could no longer hope for stage victory and extra bonus seconds. Well helped out by her Team Argos-Shimano teammates, Wild powered to a second consecutive stage win, beating Ellen van Dijk and Giorgia Bronzini.|$|E

500|$|The song became {{controversial}} for its supposed {{references to}} drugs. The BBC {{announced that it}} would not broadcast [...] "A Day in the Life" [...] due to the line [...] "I'd love to turn you on", which, according to the corporation, advocated drug use. Other lyrics allegedly referring to drugs include [...] "found my way upstairs and had a smoke / somebody spoke and I went into a dream". A spokesman for the BBC stated: [...] "We have listened to this song over and over again.

500|$|The match {{started with}} a frenetic pace as both teams earned free kick {{attempts}} within the opening two minutes. [...] Seattle forward Mike Fucito had the first goal scoring opportunity of the match in the eighth minute as he broke free in the penalty area and took a shot on goal. [...] The shot was kicked away by Fire goalkeeper Sean Johnson. Neither side appeared to gain control as the match progressed through the first 10 minutes. [...] In the 11th minute, Chicago midfielder Marco Pappa slipped between two defenders {{in the middle of}} the field and had a long range shot <b>go</b> <b>just</b> wide of the net. [...] Two minutes later Pappa again had a long shot which forced Seattle goalkeeper Kasey Keller to make a save. Pappa was responsible for all five of his team's shots in the first half. [...] In the 26th minute, Patrick Nyarko was shown a yellow card by referee Alex Prus for a hard tackle on Seattle's Osvaldo Alonso near the touch-line.|$|E

2500|$|In the Beckett Room {{below the}} library there survives Anglo-Saxon masonry, a {{reminder}} that the school occupies all that remains of the site of Sherborne Abbey (AD 705, remodelled as a Benedictine abbey in 998).

2500|$|The Matrix trilogy: Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) wears a black PVC catsuit. Her {{androgynous}} {{appeal in}} the film was carefully designed in PVC catsuits, at times by trench coats, generating enormous following, especially among cybergeeks. The role and costume launched her into stardom. Trinity's shift from the maiden with longer hair and softer garbs to the black vinyl catsuit has been commented on as a statement in gender identity. Kym Barrett, the costume designer, made 15 versions of the catsuit, all designed to look the same on screen. She was nominated by the Costume Designers Guild in 2001 as the Best Costume Designer for her designs for Matrix characters. While discussing the Matrix {{she said that she}} [...] "wanted to <b>go</b> <b>just</b> from the script--to come up with clothes that weren't connected to a certain time or place".|$|E
2500|$|Play {{is started}} at the {{beginning}} of each half by a kick-off. One side—determined following the toss of a coin—takes a drop kick from the middle of the halfway line to start the half. The ball must travel at least 10 m into the opposition half. None of the kicking team's players are allowed in front of the player taking the kick until after that player's foot has touched the ball. The kicking side frequently kicks the ball high and for it to <b>go</b> <b>just</b> over 10 m, which is marked by a dashed line across the pitch. This tactic gives their players time to chase the lobbed ball and hope to catch it before the opposition does. Alternatively the kick may be a long kick deep into opposition territory, sacrificing the chance to regain possession for territorial gain. A restart kick that does not cross the 10 m line can either be played by the receiving team, but not by the kicking team, or a midfield scrum is awarded to the receiving team. A restart kick that crosses the side lines without being touched awards the receiving team either a midfield scrum or a line out on the halfway line, receiving team option.|$|E
