50|$|Each rhombomere {{has its own}} set of receptors, and {{the same}} receptors can cause {{different}} actions. For example, one study showed that there are proteins called Gli1, Gli2, and Gli3 that affect ventral hindbrain development, and are also required for motoneuron development and correct neural patterning in the hindbrain. However, how important are they and what their specific roles are was unclear. By mutating the proteins Gli2 and Gli3, which were especially studied, it was found that Gli2 and Gli3 contain both activation and repression domains, while Gli1 only had activation domains, which were entirely transcriptional. Gli2 was also found to be a stronger activator while Gli3 was a strong repressor. Gli2 and Gli3 had overlapping functions that concerned the patterning of the ventral spinal cord which was important for correct organization and formation of the motoneurons. This was shown when mutation of the Gli3 protein showed only a slight decrease in expression of Olig2, while when the Gli2 protein was mutated, the expression of Olig2 was not detected. Olig2 is normally expressed in the ventral area of the neural tube. Mutations in the Gli2 protein causes more severe damage in the ventral patterning of the hindbrain than that of the spinal cord. This shows that Gli2 performs different functions in the hindbrain that Gli3 is unable to substitute. Gli2 and Gli3 in a developing hindbrain also have distinct functions in the Shh (sonic hedgehog) signal transduction. This is caused by <b>differential</b> <b>modulation</b> of gene expression that is specific to each rhombomere. Finally, studies have shown that in rhombomere 4, the ventral patterning is less affected by the mutation of Gli2. This shows that this particular rhombomere has different requirements for Gli proteins.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — A {{lower bound}} on the {{capacity}} of trained space-time modulation is presented for {{the case of a}} time-varying channel. We consider the case where the channel consists of two components of variable strength: a specular component from line-of-sight or strong coherent multipath, and a time-varying diffuse component due to a mobile receiver or scatterers. The training period and the data period are assumed quasi-static, with the time-autocorrelation function of the channel used to model the variation between each sub-block. The training signal, training signal length, power allocation and training frequency that optimize the capacity bound are derived. We compare the effective SNR of this bound to that of <b>differential</b> <b>modulation</b> at high SNR, and find it to be lower. We find the best number of antennas to use at high SNR with <b>differential</b> <b>modulation,</b> and compare it with the optimal value for trained modulation.

40|$|Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is a {{multicarrier}} {{modulation technique}} which is robust against multipath fading and {{very easy to}} implement in transmitters and receivers using the inverse fast Fourier transform and the fast Fourier transform. A guard interval using cyclic prefix is inserted in each OFDM symbol to avoid the inter-symbol interference. This guard interval {{should be at least}} equal to, or longer than the maximum delay spread of the channel to combat against inter-symbol interference properly. In coherent detection, channel estimation is required for the data detection of OFDM systems to equalize the channel effects. One of the popular techniques is to insert pilot tones (reference signals) in OFDM symbols. In conventional method, pilot tones are inserted into every OFDM symbols. Channel capacity is wasted due to the transmission {{of a large number of}} pilot tones. To overcome this transmission loss, incoherent data detection is introduced in OFDM systems, where it is not needed to estimate the channel at first. We use <b>differential</b> <b>modulation</b> based incoherent detection in this thesis for the data detection of OFDM systems. Data can be encoded in the relative phase of consecutive OFDM symbols (inter-frame modulation) or in the relative phase of an OFDM symbol in adjacent subcarriers (in-frame modulation). We use higher order <b>differential</b> <b>modulation</b> for in-frame modulation to compare the improvement of bit error rate. It should be noted that the single <b>differential</b> <b>modulation</b> scheme uses only one pilot tone, whereas the double differential uses two pilot tones and so on. Thus overhead due to the extra pilot tones in conventional methods are minimized and the detection delay is reduced. It has been observed that the single differential scheme works better in low SNRs (Signal to Noise Ratios) with low channel taps and the double differential works better at higher SNRs. Simulation results show that higher order <b>differential</b> <b>modulation</b> schemes don¡¯t have any further advantages. For inter-frame modulation, we use single <b>differential</b> <b>modulation</b> where only one OFDM symbol is used as a reference symbol. Except the reference symbol, no other overhead is required. We also perform channel estimation using <b>differential</b> <b>modulation.</b> Channel estimation using <b>differential</b> <b>modulation</b> is very easy and channel coefficients can be estimated very accurately without increasing any computational complexity. Our simulation results show that the mean square channel estimation error is about ¡¼ 10 ¡½^(- 2) at an SNR of 30 dB for double differential in-frame modulation scheme, whereas channel estimation error is about ¡¼ 10 ¡½^(- 4) for single differential inter-frame modulation. Incoherent data detection using classical DPSK (Differential Phase Shift Keying) causes an SNR loss of approximately 3 dB compared to coherent detection. But in our method, differential detection can estimate the channel coefficients very accurately and our estimated channel can be used in simple coherent detection to improve the system performance and minimize the SNR loss that happens in conventional method...|$|E
