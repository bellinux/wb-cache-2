25|$|An {{osteotomy}} is {{a surgical}} operation whereby a bone is cut to shorten or lengthen it or {{to change its}} alignment. It is sometimes performed to correct a hallux valgus, or to straighten a bone that has healed crookedly following a fracture. It {{is also used to}} correct a coxa vara, <b>genu</b> <b>valgum,</b> and genu varum. The operation is done under a general anaesthetic.|$|E
25|$|The {{angle of}} {{inclination}} formed between the neck and shaft of the femur, (collodiaphysial angle), varies with age—about 150° in the newborn, it gradually decreases to 126-128° in adults, to reach 120° in old age. Pathological changes in this angle results in abnormal posture of the leg: A small angle produces coxa vara and a large angle in coxa valga; the latter is usually combined with genu varum and coxa vara leads <b>genu</b> <b>valgum.</b> Additionally, a line drawn through the femoral neck superimposed on a line drawn through the femoral condyles forms an angle, the torsion angle, which {{makes it possible for}} flexion movements of the hip joint to be transposed into rotary movements of the femoral head. Abnormally increased torsion angles results in a limb turned inward and a decreased angle in a limb turned outward; both cases resulting in a reduced range of a persons mobility.|$|E
25|$|Usually, {{the large}} joints {{of the lower}} limb are aligned in a {{straight}} line, which represents the mechanical longitudinal axis of the leg, the Mikulicz line. This line stretches from the hip joint (or more precisely {{the head of the}} femur), through the knee joint (the intercondylar eminence of the tibia), and down {{to the center of the}} ankle (the ankle mortise, the fork-like grip between the medial and lateral malleoli). In the tibial shaft, the mechanical and anatomical axes coincide, but in the femoral shaft they diverge 6°, resulting in the femorotibial angle of 174° in a leg with normal axial alignment. A leg is considered straight when, with the feet brought together, both the medial malleoli of the ankle and the medial condyles of the knee are touching. Divergence from the normal femorotibial angle is called genu varum if the center of the knee joint is lateral to the mechanical axis (intermalleolar distance exceeds 3cm), and <b>genu</b> <b>valgum</b> if it is medial to the mechanical axis (intercondylar distance exceeds 5cm). These conditions impose unbalanced loads on the joints and stretching of either the thigh's adductors and abductors.|$|E
30|$|This {{prospective}} {{study was conducted}} between November 2012 and November 2015. The included patients had coronal plane angular knee deformities (<b>genu</b> varum and <b>valgum)</b> with at least 1  year of skeletal growth remaining. The following cases were excluded: physiological deformities, deformities due to metabolic disorders that improved with medical management, deformities {{as a result of}} infection or neoplasm, post-traumatic deformities, dynamic deformities as in neuromuscular disorders and contractures, non-ambulatory patients.|$|R
3000|$|Lower {{extremity}} angular deformities such as <b>genu</b> varum or <b>valgum</b> {{are common}} in children. Treatment options include osteotomy [1] or growth modulation [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. Growth modulation is less invasive than osteotomy and has increased in popularity, particularly since the development of tension band plates (TBPs [...]) by Stevens [8]. TBPs function as a hinge on the convex side of the deformity, and gradually correct limb alignment while preserving natural growth, with no need for invasive osteotomy [4, 8].|$|R
40|$|Aim. One of the {{physical}} characteristics of the human skeleton showing remarkable individual variability is knee conformation. Allowing for variation of normal, an angle of 0 degrees to 5 degrees between the femoral and the tibial axis is considered acceptable, although no normotype exists. In persons prone to gonarthrosis, significant axial deviation of the knee, particularly varus deviation, can lead to degenerative joint changes in adulthood. In this retrospective study, clinical and radiographic outcomes were evaluated in 25 patients undergoing staple epiphysiodesis or opening wedge osteotomy (varusizing or valgusizing) and Puddu plate fixation for axial deviation of the knee (<b>genu</b> varum or <b>valgum).</b> A further aim {{of the study was}} to underline the importance of adequate and prompt treatment with appropriate timing of intervention with a view to obviate the need for later knee arthroplasty (unicompartmental prosthesis). Methods. The series was composed of 25 patients operated for axial deviation of the knee: 16 (10 males and 6 females; mean age, 40 years, range, 14 - 58 years) underwent osteotomy; 9 (6 males and 3 females; mean age, 12. 5 years, range, 11 - 14) underwent staple epiphysiodesis. All patients underwent preoperative clinical and radiographic assessment. In the latter group, the staples were inserted into the femur or tibia to correct valgus or varus deviation, respectively. Follow-up examinations showed a significant improvement in mechanical axis deviation of the lower extremity. The patients in the former group were operated either for deformities that had caused unicompartmental gonarthrosis or for fractures. Prior to osteotomy, arthroscopy was performed to treat joint damage (meniscal debridement, condroabrasion and/or subcondral perforation, partial synovectomy) followed by open surgery. The mean duration of follow-up was 5 years. Clinical, functional and radiographic outcomes were assessed. Results. A significant improvement in pain symptoms and knee joint function was noted in all patients. No complications (neurologic, vascular, fractures) occurred. All osteotomies consolidated and the degree of correction remained, with slight variations, unchanged. No postoperative complications developed. In properly selected patients, tibial and femoral addition osteotomy with the Puddu plate, as well as staple epiphysiodesis, were found to be optimal techniques for femorotibial axis correction in the treatment and prevention (epiphysiodesis) of unicompartmental gonarthrosis. Conclusion. The reliability, reproducibility and simplicity of the technique, together with the maintenance of mid- and long-term outcomes, argue for epiphysiodesis as a useful alternative to conservative correction should such methods fail. Puddu's osteotomy was found to be a valuable alternative to uni- or tricompartmental knee arthroplasty, conventional external subtraction osteotomy (Coventry), and hemicallotasis...|$|R

50|$|Underlying {{causes of}} chronic medial knee {{instability}} must be identified before surgical reconstruction is performed. More specifically, patients with <b>genu</b> <b>valgum</b> (knock-kneed) alignment must be evaluated and treated with an osteotomy(s) to establish balanced forces on knee ligaments, preventing premature failure of concurrent cruciate ligament reconstruction.

Once proper alignment is achieved, reconstruction can be performed.|$|E
50|$|Growth disturbance: Children with JIA {{may have}} reduced overall rate of growth, {{especially}} if the disease involves many joints or other body systems. Paradoxically, individually affected large joints (such as the knee) may grow faster, due to inflammation-induced increased blood supply to the bone growth plates situated near the joints. This can result in leg length discrepancy, and also deformities such as <b>genu</b> <b>valgum.</b> Asymmetrical growth can also affect other bones e.g. discrepancy in digit length. Marked differences in bone age (skeletal maturation) may be seen.|$|E
50|$|Symptomatic {{individuals}} {{should be}} seen by an orthopedist to assess the possibility of treatment (physiotherapy for muscular strengthening, cautious use of analgesic medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). Although there is no cure, surgery is sometimes used to relieve symptoms.

50|$|It {{is normal}} for {{children}} to have knock knees {{between the ages of}} two and five years of age, and almost all of them resolve as the child grows older. If symptoms are prolonged and pronounced or hereditary, doctors often use orthotic shoes or leg braces at night to gently move a child's leg back into position. If the condition persists and worsens later in life, surgery may be required to relieve pain and complications resulting from severe or hereditary <b>genu</b> <b>valgum.</b> Available surgical procedures include adjustments to the lower femur and total knee replacement (TKR).|$|E
50|$|In 1938 Hans Wagner {{described}} 13 {{members of}} a Canton of Zurich family with a peculiar lesion of the vitreous and retina.

5000|$|<b>Genu</b> <b>valgum,</b> {{commonly}} called [...] "knock-knee", {{is a condition}} in which the knees angle in and touch each other when the legs are straightened. Individuals with severe valgus deformities are typically unable to touch their feet together while simultaneously straightening the legs. The term originates from the Latin genu, [...] "knee", and valgus which actually means bent outwards, but in this case, it is used to describe the distal portion of the knee joint which bends outwards and thus the proximal portion seems to be bent inwards.

In women, the Q angle should be less than 22 degrees with the knee in extension and less than 9 degrees with the knee in 90 degrees of flexion. In men, the Q angle should be less than 18 degrees with the knee in extension and less than 8 degrees with the knee in 90 degrees of flexion.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: <b>Genu</b> <b>valgum</b> is {{a common}} knee {{deformity}} in growing children. It alters the alignment of the lower extremity, body posture, and gait pattern of the children. Understanding of kinematic and kinetic parameters of gait in <b>genu</b> <b>valgum</b> is essential for planning and implementing the intervention to correcting the valgus deformity. The aim {{of this paper is}} to investigate the kinetic and kinematic gait differences in children with <b>genu</b> <b>valgum.</b> PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 13 -year old girl with left side unilateral <b>genu</b> <b>valgum</b> and a closely matched healthy counterpart were recruited to compare the kinetic and kinematic parameters of their gait performances, and they were captured by The VICON motion analysis system. RESULTS: The results showed that the child with <b>genu</b> <b>valgum</b> had lower left and right knee angles (39. 6 degrees; 30. 2 degrees) and higher ankle angles (35. 6 degrees; 28. 4 degrees) than the healthy subject (64. 2 degrees, 60. 2 degrees). In addition, the child with <b>genu</b> <b>valgum</b> had lower moments on the left side of the knee (42. 1 mm. N) than unaffected right knee (73. 9 mm. N). Also, the ground reaction force was (0. 7 N) lower in the affected knee of the child with <b>genu</b> <b>valgum</b> than the normal subject. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that there were decreased knee and ankle moments and lower knee and ankle ground reaction forces in the affected <b>genu</b> <b>valgum</b> extremity when compared with the healthy counterpart. These changes might be responsible for the altering gait pattern of the child with <b>genu</b> <b>valgum.</b> Institute of Textiles and ClothingDepartment of Rehabilitation Science...|$|E
