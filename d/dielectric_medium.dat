5|$|According to Einstein's {{theory of}} special relativity, as an electron's speed {{approaches}} {{the speed of}} light, from an observer's point of view its relativistic mass increases, thereby making it {{more and more difficult}} to accelerate it from within the observer's frame of reference. The speed of an electron can approach, but never reach, the speed of light in a vacuum, c. However, when relativistic electrons—that is, electrons moving at a speed close to c—are injected into a <b>dielectric</b> <b>medium</b> such as water, where the local speed of light is significantly less than c, the electrons temporarily travel faster than light in the medium. As they interact with the medium, they generate a faint light called Cherenkov radiation.|$|E

A theory of this effect was later developed within the framework of Einstein's special relativity theory by Igor Tamm and Ilya Frank, who also shared the Nobel Prize.

40|$|Abstract. We present {{here the}} {{application}} of the Maxwell Garnett (MG) and the Bruggeman (Br) formalisms to homogenize very general linear bianisotropic-in-bianisotropic particulate composite media with ellipsoidal inclusions. Both formalisms involve the calculation of certain depolarization dyadics, which generally amounts to the numerical evaluation of several two-dimensional integrals. The MG estimate of the constitutive dyadic of the homogenized composite medium can then be obtained by straightforward matrix manipulations. The Br estimate, however, involves nonlinear equations which have to be solved iteratively. We present an iteration scheme that converged rapidly in most cases tested. Numerical results are given for those composite media for which the Bruggeman formalism so far has not been implemented: spherical chiral inclusions in a uniaxial <b>dielectric</b> host <b>medium,</b> spheroidal chiral inclusions in free space, spherical chiral inclusions in a biaxial <b>dielectric</b> host <b>medium,</b> and spherical voids in a gyrotropic <b>dielectric</b> host <b>medium.</b> 1...|$|R
500|$|Effects of the solvent and {{solvation}} {{should be}} mentioned also in this section. It turns out, these influences are more subtle {{than that of}} a <b>dielectric</b> <b>medium</b> mentioned above. For example, the expected (by electronic effects of methyl substituents) and observed in gas phase order of basicity of methylamines, Me3N > Me2NH > MeNH2 > NH3, is changed by water to [...] Me2NH > MeNH2 > Me3N > NH3. Neutral methylamine molecules are hydrogen-bonded to water molecules mainly through one acceptor, N–HOH, interaction and only occasionally just one more donor bond, NH–OH2. Hence, methylamines are stabilized to about the same extent by hydration, regardless of the number of methyl groups. In stark contrast, corresponding methylammonium cations always utilize all the available protons for donor NH–OH2 bonding. Relative stabilization of methylammonium ions thus decreases with the number of methyl groups explaining the order of water basicity of methylamines.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this study, the {{transmission}} of planar single-layer frequency selective surface (FSS) has been studied using modal analysis method, and the maximum transmission that a planar single-layer FSS structure with an infinitely thin array can reach is presented. The results show that this transmission upper limit is independent of the array and the element, which indicates {{that it is impossible}} to achieve a transmission higher than this upper limit under a given incident and dielectric-supporting condition by the design of the periodic array. As the modal analysis method is an accurate method to solve the scattering problem of planar FSS with an infinitely thin array, this upper limit is also independent of the solution method. Results of both numerical simulations and experiments show that the upper limit presented in this paper is strict, but may be hard to attain when FSS is supported by lossy <b>dielectric</b> <b>mediums.</b> 1...|$|R

[...] gas under pressure is used as an insulator in gas insulated switchgear (GIS) because it has a much higher dielectric strength than air or dry nitrogen.

This makes GIS more suitable for certain purposes such as indoor placement, as opposed to air-insulated electrical gear, which takes up considerably more room.

It is vital to prevent oxidation and material degradation, in order to improve the performance and sensitivity of aluminum based surface plasmon resonance (SPR) devices. Aluminum nanoparticles passivate by forming the surrounding oxide layer. In this research, SPR properties of aluminum nanoparticles in different dielectric environments were investigated. Using boundary element method and MNPBEM simulation package the sensitivity of aluminum plasmon resonance to the presence of surrounding oxide layer, two nanoparticle coupling and different <b>dielectric</b> <b>mediums</b> were studied. Results show that in core-shell nanoparticles SPR peak position shifts from 170 nm to 206 nm by increasing shell thickness from 1 to 5 nm. In coupled Al nanoparticles by decreasing the gap distance between the particles from 20 to 0 nm the SPR longitudinal peak wavelength redshifted from 137 nm to 167 nm. Finally we study the effect of different embedding medium refractive indexes. Increasing dielectric matrix refractive index from 1 to 2 leads to redshift in SPR peak wavelength from 154 nm to 202 nm. Furthermore, enhancement of SPR peak position by refractive index is linear.
