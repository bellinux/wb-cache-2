5|$|Miller's character, <b>joie</b> <b>de</b> <b>vivre</b> {{and love}} of cricket were {{expressed}} on the field during the tour, particularly in the tour games, when he played several carefree innings, hitting many sixes. He also showed his disdain for Bradman's obsession with annihilating the opposition. In one match against Essex, he deliberately {{allowed himself to be}} bowled first ball in protest against Australia's ruthless approach to batting; that day, his side set a world record for the most runs scored in a day of first-class cricket (721).|$|E
5|$|Since its release, Kadhalikka Neramillai has {{developed}} a cult status in Tamil cinema. It has been hailed as a trendsetting comedy, and the film is said to kindle a feeling of <b>joie</b> <b>de</b> <b>vivre.</b> The film's comedy sequences are regarded as evergreen. The success of their on-screen pairing led Nagesh and Sachu to act together in films such as Motor Sundaram Pillai (1966), Galatta Kalyanam (1968), Sivandha Mann (1969) Sumathi En Sundari (1971) and Urimai Kural (1974). According to The News Today, Kadhalikka Neramillai also popularised the romantic comedy genre.|$|E
5|$|A {{month after}} the opening of Peter Grimes, Britten and Yehudi Menuhin went to Germany to give {{recitals}} to concentration camp survivors. What they saw, at Belsen most of all, so shocked Britten that he refused {{to talk about it}} until towards the end of his life, when he told Pears that it had coloured everything he had written since. Colin Matthews comments that the next two works Britten composed after his return, the song-cycle The Holy Sonnets of John Donne and the Second String Quartet, contrast strongly with earlier, lighter-hearted works such as Les Illuminations. Britten recovered his <b>joie</b> <b>de</b> <b>vivre</b> for The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra (1945), written for an educational film, Instruments of the Orchestra, directed by Muir Mathieson and featuring the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Malcolm Sargent. It became, and remained, his most often played and popular work.|$|E

500|$|The Ninth Symphony (1945), in contrast, {{was much}} lighter in tone. Gavriil Popov wrote {{that it was}} [...] "splendid in its <b>joie</b> <b>de</b> <b>vivre,</b> gaiety, brilliance, and pungency!! By 1946, however, it {{was the subject of}} criticism. Israel Nestyev asked whether it was the right time for [...] "a light and amusing {{interlude}} between Shostakovich's significant creations, a temporary rejection of great, serious problems for the sake of playful, filigree-trimmed trifles." [...] The New York World-Telegram of 27 July 1946 was similarly dismissive: [...] "The Russian composer should not have expressed his feelings about the defeat of Nazism in such a childish manner". Shostakovich continued to compose chamber music, notably his Second Piano Trio (Op. 67), dedicated to the memory of Sollertinsky, with a bittersweet, Jewish-themed totentanz finale.|$|E
500|$|Of Sicily's own form of Baroque, post 1693, it {{has been}} said, [...] "The {{buildings}} conceived {{in the wake of}} this disaster expressed a light-hearted freedom of decoration whose incongruous gaiety was intended, perhaps, to assuage the horror". While this is an accurate description of a style which is almost a celebration of <b>joie</b> <b>de</b> <b>vivre</b> in stone, it is unlikely to be the reason for the choice. As with all architectural styles, the selection of style would have directly linked to current fashion. Versailles had been completed in 1688 in a far sterner Baroque style; Louis XIV's new palace was immediately emulated across Europe by any aristocrat or sovereign in Europe aspiring to wealth, taste, or power. Thus it was the obvious choice for the [...] "homeless rich" [...] of Sicily, of whom there were hundreds. The excesses of the Baroque-style palazzi and country villas to be constructed in Sicily, however, were soon to make Versailles seem a model of restraint.|$|E

500|$|In the Winnipeg Free Press, Brad Oswald {{reviewed}} the show cautiously, writing {{it that is}} [...] "decidedly different, distinctly weird and definitely-an-acquired-taste kind of great" [...] and that some characters and scenes [...] "are edgy and uncompromising and sure to shock and offend nearly as many viewers as they amuse." [...] In the Toronto Star Raju Mudhar wrote that the [...] "humour is classic Kids, with plenty of visual gags mixed with off-colour, politically incorrect jokes" [...] and that [...] "the troupe's eye for satire remains sharp as ever". John Doyle in The Globe and Mail wrote a negative review concluding it was [...] "a dismal coda to the comedy troupe's outstanding career". Doyle identified himself as {{a fan of the}} original The Kids in the Hall series but found that this show had [...] "excruciatingly awful attempts at humour" [...] and [...] "no comic rhythm". Doyle called it [...] "appallingly slow-witted TV", [...] "mediocre and maddeningly pointless". In the Times-Colonist, Alex Strachan provided a qualified positive review writing that it was [...] "juvenile, sophomoric and deliberately unsophisticated" [...] but [...] "a joy to watch". Strachan concludes that [...] "Death Comes to Town is easy to dismiss as being lightweight, which it is, and scattershot, which it is. There's a genuine <b>joie</b> <b>de</b> <b>vivre</b> at work, though. Death Comes to Town is silly comedy for smart people." ...|$|E

Cameron stated, [...] "In order to see {{the present and the}} past, I decided to create a fictional {{survivor}} who is [...] 101 years, and she connects us in a way through history." [...] The 100-year-old Rose gives Lovett information regarding the [...] "Heart of the Ocean" [...] after he discovers a nude drawing of her in the wreck. She tells the story of her time aboard the ship, mentioning Jack {{for the first time since}} the sinking. At 87, Stuart had to be made up to look older for the role. Of casting Stuart, Cameron stated, [...] "My casting director found her. She was sent out on a mission to find retired actresses from the Golden Age of the thirties and forties." [...] Cameron said that he did not know who Stuart was, and Fay Wray was also considered for the role. [...] "But [...] was just so into it, and so lucid, and had such a great spirit. And I saw the connection between her spirit and [...] spirit," [...] stated Cameron. [...] "I saw this <b>joie</b> <b>de</b> <b>vivre</b> in both of them, that I thought the audience would be able to make that cognitive leap that it's the same person." [...] Stuart died on September 26, 2010, at age 100, approximately the same age elder Rose was in the film.|$|E

2500|$|In our century, {{observers}} have warmed to the rebel myth of Caravaggio, and often ignore the profound influence on art that Carracci had. Caravaggio almost never worked in fresco, {{regarded as the}} test of a great painter's mettle. On the other hand, Carracci's best works are in fresco. Thus the somber canvases of Caravaggio, with benighted backgrounds, are suited to the contemplative altars, and not to well-lit walls or ceilings {{such as this one}} in the Farnese. Wittkower was surprised that a Farnese cardinal surrounded himself with frescoes of libidinous themes, indicative of a [...] "considerable relaxation of counter-reformatory morality". This thematic choice suggests Carracci may have been more rebellious relative to the often-solemn religious passion of Caravaggio's canvases. Wittkower states Carracci's [...] "frescoes convey the impression of a tremendous <b>joie</b> <b>de</b> <b>vivre,</b> a new blossoming of vitality and of an energy long repressed".|$|E
