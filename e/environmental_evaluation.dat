25|$|Bangalore's {{rapid growth}} has created several {{problems}} relating to traffic congestion and infrastructural obsolescence that the Bangalore Mahanagara Palike has found challenging to address. The unplanned nature {{of growth in}} the city resulted in massive traffic gridlocks that the municipality attempted to ease by constructing a flyover system and by imposing one-way traffic systems. Some of the flyovers and one-ways mitigated the traffic situation moderately but were unable to adequately address the disproportionate growth of city traffic. A 2003 Battelle <b>Environmental</b> <b>Evaluation</b> System (BEES) evaluation of Bangalore's physical, biological and socioeconomic parameters indicated that Bangalore's water quality and terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems were close to ideal, while the city's socioeconomic parameters (traffic, quality of life) aire quality and noise pollution scored poorly. The BBMP works in conjunction with the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) and the Agenda for Bangalore's Infrastructure and Development Task Force (ABIDe) to design and implement civic and infrastructural projects.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{important}} that those interested in a Chemistry degree understand the variety of roles available to them (on average), which vary depending on education and job experience. Those Chemists who hold a bachelor's degree are most commonly involved in positions related to either research assistance (working {{under the guidance of}} senior chemists in a research-oriented activity), or, alternatively, they may work on distinct (chemistry-related) aspects of a business/organization/enterprise, including aspects that involve quality control, quality assurance, manufacturing/production, formulation, inspection, method validation, visitation for troubleshooting of chemistry-related instruments, regulatory affairs, [...] "on-demand" [...] technical services, chemical analysis for non-research purposes (e.g. as a legal request, for testing purposes, or for government or non-profit agencies); chemists may also work in <b>environmental</b> <b>evaluation</b> & assessment. Other jobs/roles may include sales and marketing of chemical products and chemistry-related instruments, and/or technical writing. The more experience obtained, the more independence & leadership/management roles these chemists may perform in those organizations. Some chemists with relatively higher experience might change jobs or job position to become a manager of a chemistry-related enterprise, a supervisor, an entrepreneur or a chemistry consultant. Other chemists choose to combine their education and/or experience as a chemist with a distinct credential to provide different services (e.g. forensic chemists, chemistry-related software development, patent law specialists, environmental law firm staff, scientific news reporting staff, engineering design staff, etc.)... In comparison, Chemists who have obtained a Master of Science (M.S.) in Chemistry or in a very related discipline may find chemist roles that allow them to enjoy more independence, leadership and/or responsibility earlier in their careers (with less years of experience than those with a bachelor's degree as highest degree); Sometimes, M.S. chemists receive more complex tasks duties, in comparison with the roles/positions found by chemists with a bachelor's degree as their highest academic degree and with the same or close-to-same years of job experience. Although good chemists without a PhD. degree but with relatively many years of experience may be allowed some applied research positions, the general rule is that PhD. chemists are preferred for research positions and are typically the preferred choice for the highest administrative positions on big enterprises involved in Chemistry-related duties. Some positions, especially research oriented, will only allow those chemists who are PhD. holders. Jobs that involve intensive research and actively seek to lead the discovery of completely new chemical products under specifically assigned monetary funds & resources, or jobs that seek to develop new scientific theories, require a Ph.D. more often than not. Chemists with a PhD. as the highest academic degree are found typically on the R department of an enterprise, and can also hold university positionsΉ as professors. Some smaller colleges, [...] as well as Community Colleges, usually hire chemists with M.S. as professors too (and rarely, some universities who need part-time or temporary instructors, or temporary staff), but when the positions are scarce and the applicants are many, they might prefer PhD. holders instead.|$|E
