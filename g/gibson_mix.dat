50|$|Before {{standard}} benchmarks were available, {{average speed}} rating of computers {{was based on}} calculations for a mix of instructions with the results given in kilo Instructions Per Second (kIPS). The most famous was the <b>Gibson</b> <b>Mix,</b> produced by Jack Clark Gibson of IBM for scientific applications. Other ratings, such as the ADP mix which does not include floating point operations, were produced for commercial applications. The thousand instructions per second (kIPS) unit is rarely used today, as most current microprocessors can execute at least a million instructions per second.|$|E
40|$|A {{high-performance}} processor circuit {{called the}} SC- 3 {{has been developed}} {{to meet the requirements}} of advanced experiment and attitude control applications. It is based on the 16 MHz Intel 80386 / 80387 chip set and implements a dual bus system configuration which allows high-speed, 32 -bit wide memory and low-speed. 16 -bit wide Input Output(I/O) circuits to be separated. This separation maintains compatibility {{with a wide range of}} current I/O circuit designs while exploiting the high-bandwidth memory access capabilities of the 80386. Performance is further enhanced by means of a cache on the 32 -bit bus. Gibson, Whetstone, and Dhrystone instruction mixes have been used to evaluate performance under various operating modes. When the SC- 3 is constrained to execute from 16 -bit memory. the <b>Gibson</b> <b>mix</b> indicates a 32...|$|E
40|$|Engineering cell {{factories}} {{for producing}} biofuels and pharmaceuticals has spurred great interests to develop rapid and efficient synthetic biology tools customized for modular pathway engineering. Along the way, combinatorial gene expression control through modification of regulatory element offered tremendous opportunity for fine-tuning gene expression and generating digital-like genetic circuits. In this report, we present an efficient evolutionary approach {{to build a}} range of regulatory control elements. The reported method allows for rapid construction of promoter, 5 ′UTR, terminator and trans-activating RNA libraries. Synthetic overlapping oligos with high portion of degenerate nucleotides flanking the regulatory element could be efficiently assembled to a vector expressing fluorescence reporter. This approach combines high mutation rate of the synthetic DNA with the high assembly efficiency of <b>Gibson</b> <b>Mix.</b> Our constructed library demonstrates broad range of transcriptional or translational gene expression dynamics. Specifically, both the promoter library and 5 ′UTR library exhibits gene expression dynamics spanning across three order of magnitude. The terminator library and trans-activating RNA library displays relatively narrowed gene expression pattern. The reported study provides a versatile toolbox for rapidly constructing a large family of prokaryotic regulatory elements. These libraries also facilitate the implementation of combinatorial pathway engineering principles and the engineering of more efficient microbial cell factory for various biomanufacturing applications...|$|E

The Extended Club Mix/Vocal track (6:34) from DM 86744 was excerpted for a dance medley, 'Medley: Out of the Blue - Shake Your Love - Only in My Dreams' (Debbie <b>Gibson</b> Mega <b>Mix),</b> that became Track 4 on Atlantic DM 86556 'Foolish Beat'.|$|R
50|$|In 1925 Jones {{made three}} films {{with a very}} young Carole Lombard.

By 1928 he formed his own {{production}} company, but his independently produced film The Big Hop (a non-Western) failed. He then organized a touring Wild West show, with himself as a featured attraction, but this expensive venture also failed due to the faltering economy of late 1929.|$|R

Earlier that year, she starred in Housesitter, a screwball comedy with Steve Martin, which was a commercial success.|$|R
30|$|Bacterial {{recombinant}} DNA manipulation {{was carried}} out in Escherichia coli strain NEB 5 -α (New England Biolabs, Hertfordshire, UK). The VRC 01 heavy and light chain genes were generated from their published sequence (Wu et al. 2010) and cloned into a pUC 19 vector already containing the murine IgG 1 secretion signal (Tiller et al. 2008). The amino acid sequence of the murine IgG 1 secretion signal is GWSCIILFLVATATGVHSQ. The four vectors used in this study were constructed using the DNA Gibson Assembly method (Gibson et al. 2009). Initially the VRC 01 heavy and light chains were amplified by PCR using Phusion® High-Fidelity DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) ensuring that the murine IgG 1 secretion signal was included and primers designed to add regions of homology to the relevant vectors. The VRC 01 heavy chain gene was integrated into the pPICZ A vector (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The VRC 01 light chain gene was integrated into the pJAN- 1 vector (Biogrammatics, Carlsbad, USA). A second set of vectors were made with the initial amplification of VRC 01 removing the murine IgG 1 secretion signal for integration into the pPICZα A vector and pJAN-s 1 vector (both containing the α-MF signal peptide from S. cerevisiae), which were also amplified with the relevant regions of homology. The PCR fragments were gel extracted using the Zymoclean™ Gel DNA Recovery kit (Zymo Research Corporation, Irvine, USA). DNA was incubated at 50  °C in equimolar concentrations of 100  ng of DNA with the ingredients of the <b>Gibson</b> master <b>mix</b> (<b>Gibson</b> et al. 2009) and 1  μL was transformed into NEB 5 -α competent cells (New England Biolabs).|$|R
50|$|Many of SGI's collaborations {{have been}} with energy companies. In 2007, SGI worked with BP to commercialize microbial-based {{processes}} for increasing the conversion and recovery of subsurface hydrocarbons. In 2009, SGI received funding from ExxonMobil to produce biofuels on an industrial-scale using recombinant algae and other microorganisms. The company purchased an 81 acre site in Southern California's Imperial valley to produce algae fuel for their collaboration with Exxon Mobil. They also signed a collaborative agreement with New England Biolabs to Launch <b>Gibson</b> Assembly Master <b>Mix</b> Product for Synthetic and Molecular Biology Applications in 2012.|$|R
30|$|The {{quality of}} genomic DNA and PCR {{products}} {{was assessed using}} the E-gel Electrophoresis System (E-gel pre-cast 1 % EX Agarose gels with SYBR safe along with E-gel 1 kB Plus DNA Ladder) from Invitrogen. Gel purification of DNA was carried out {{with the help of}} Zymoclean Gel DNA recovery kit from Zymo Research as instructed. Zymoclean-purified DNA was additionally desalted using the Bio-Rad mini spin columns, pre-filled with the Bio-Gel P- 6 DG soaked in water. For cloning in the pEU vector, the <b>Gibson</b> Assembly Master <b>Mix</b> from New England Biolabs was used. The linearized pEU vector and the insertion fragment containing the desired gene were prepared by PCR. These fragments were further gel purified and quantified with NanoDrop 2000 c from ThermoFisher. As an example of Gibson reaction, linear pEU plasmid (2  μl, 20  ng/μl) was mixed with linear gene PCR template (3.8  μl, 15  ng/μl), water (4.2  μl) and 2 × <b>Gibson</b> Assembly <b>Mix</b> (10  μl) and incubated at 50  °C for 1  h in the thermocycler. The assembled product (2  μl) has been used to transform an NEB 10 E. coli supplied with the Gibson Assembly kit. Transformed E. coli was later plated on a carbenicillin-containing agar plate and grown at 37  °C overnight. Several individual colonies were then selected and grown overnight in several milliliters of LB broth supplemented with 100  μg/ml carbenicillin. The QIAGEN Plasmid Mini Kit was then employed for plasmid extractions, which were then sent for sequencing to Eurofins Genomics or MCLAB. Successful clones were later grown in larger quantities of LB broth (with carbenicillin) and harvested using the QIAGEN Plasmid Maxi kit. To note, a 3 XFLAG tag was initially introduced through PCR primers in the first construct to generate pEU_ 3 XFLAG_LA_gene. For all subsequent cloning experiments for other genes, the obtained pEU_ 3 XFLAG_LA_gene vector was used as a template for other constructs. The general sequence design of pEU vectors is provided in Additional file 1 : Figure S 3.|$|R
