The rim is segmented and transected by radial fracture zones. Evidence for fluid-mediated alteration includes m-scale detections of phyllosilicates from orbit, and cm-scale variations in rock/soil composition/mineralogy documented by the Opportunity instrument suite. The m-scale phyllosilicate detections include Fe(3 +) -Mg and aluminous smectites that occur in patches in the Matijevic and Shoemaker fms. Rock compositions do not reveal substantial differences for smectite-bearing compared to smectite-free rocks. Interpretation: large-scale hydrothermal alteration powered by impact-deposited heat acting on limited water supplies engendered mineralogic transfomations under low water/rock, near-isochemical conditions.

Glass transition (Tg), heat capacity (Cp) and glass crystallization (Tc) properties of Eu 2 + and Sm 3 + doped and undoped FCZ glasses with different amounts of relative Cl concentration, that is, with respect to the total Cl and F concentration have been investigated by conventional differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and modulated differential scanning calorimetry (MDSC) techniques.

The apparent activation energy for the crystallization process was obtained by the crystallization peak temperature shift method in the conventional DSC mode. The specific heat capacity (Cp) has been measured as a function of composition, and the glass transition temperature (Tg) is evaluated from the smooth change in the heat capacity curve during the glass transformation. The observation of two possible glass transitions points to the presence of two phases in these FCZ glasses with higher relative Cl content.

40|$|Injection of coal-water {{slurries}} (CWS) {{made with}} both waste coal and bituminous coal was tested for enhanced reduction of NO{sub x} and Hg emissions at the AES Beaver Valley plant near Monaca, PA. Under this project, Breen Energy Solutions (BES) conducted field experiments on the these emission reduction technologies by mixing coal fines and/or pulverized coal, urea {{and water to}} form slurry, then injecting the slurry in the upper furnace region of a coal-fired boiler. The main focus of this project was use of waste coal fines as the carbon source; however, testing was also conducted using pulverized coal in conjunction with or instead of waste coal fines for conversion efficiency and economic comparisons. The host site for this research and development project was Unit No. 2 at AES Beaver Valley cogeneration station. Unit No. 2 is a 35 MW Babcock & Wilcox (B&W) front-wall fired boiler that burns eastern bituminous coal. It has low NO{sub x} burners, overfire air ports and a urea-based selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR) system for NO{sub x} control. The back-end clean-up system includes a rotating mechanical ash particulate removal and electrostatic precipitator (ESP) and wet flue gas desulfurization (FGD) scrubber. Coal slurry injection was expected to help reduce NOx emissions in two ways: (1) Via fuel-lean reburning when the slurry is injected above the combustion zone. (2) Via enhanced SNCR reduction when urea is incorporated into the slurry. The mercury control process under research uses carbon/water slurry injection to produce reactive carbon in-situ in the upper furnace, promoting the oxidation of elemental mercury in flue gas from coal-fired power boilers. By controlling the water content of the slurry below the stoichiometric requirement for complete gasification, water activated carbon (WAC) can be generated in-situ in the upper furnace. As little as 1 - 2 % coal/water slurry (heat input basis) can be injected and generate sufficient WAC for mercury capture. During July, August, and September 2007, BES designed, procured, installed, and tested the slurry injection system at Beaver Valley. Slurry production was performed by Penn State University using equipment that was moved from campus to the Beaver Valley site. Waste coal fines were procured from Headwaters Inc. and transported to the site in Super Sacks. In addition, bituminous coal was pulverized at Penn State and trucked to the site in 55 -gallon drums. This system was operated for three weeks during August and September 2007. NO{sub x} emission data were obtained using the plant CEM system. Hg measurements were taken using EPA Method 30 B (Sorbent Trap method) both downstream of the electrostatic precipitator and in the stack. Ohio Lumex Company was on site to provide rapid Hg analysis on the sorbent traps during the tests. Key results from these tests are: (1) Coal Fines reburn alone reduced NO{sub x} emissions by 0 - 10 % with up to 4 % heat input from the CWS. However, the NO{sub x} reduction was accompanied by higher CO emissions. The higher CO limited our ability to try higher reburn rates for further NO{sub x} reduction. (2) Coal Fines reburn with Urea (Carbon enhanced SNCR) decreased NO{sub x} emissions by an additional 30 % compared to Urea injection only. (3) Coal slurry injection did not change Hg capture across the ESP at full load with an inlet temperature of 400 - 430 F. The Hg capture in the ESP averaged 40 %, with or without slurry injection; low mercury particulate capture is normally expected across a higher temperature ESP because any oxidized mercury is thought to desorb from the particulate at ESP temperatures above 250 F. (4) Coal slurry injection with <b>halogen</b> <b>salts</b> added to the mixing tank increased the Hg capture in the ESP to 60 %. This significant incremental mercury reduction is important to improved mercury capture with hot-side ESP operation and wherever hindrance from sulfur oxides limit mercury reduction, because the higher temperature is above sulfur oxide dew point interference...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (PhD (Chemistry)) [...] Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education, 2000 The ochratoxins, {{metabolites}} {{of certain}} Aspergillus and Penicillium species {{are the first}} group of mycotoxins discovered subsequent to the epoch-making discovery of the aflatoxins. Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a very important mycotoxin owing to its frequent occurrence in nature, its established role in Danish porcine nephropathy and in poultry mycotoxicoses and its implicated role in Balkan endemic nephropathy and urinary system tumors among population groups in North Africa. Chapters 2 and 3 highlight the importance of OTA and the research currently being done on mycotoxins. These efforts are focused on the molecular genetics of toxinogenic fungi; the mechanism of their action; species differences in metabolism and pharmacokinetics; quantification of mycotoxins; risk assessments on the exposure of man and animals to mycotoxins and regulations for the control of mycotoxin contamination. Methods developed to analyse OTA in different matrices by using reversed phase high performance-liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection and tandem liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry techniques are described in Chapter 10. Amino propyl solid phase extraction columns were used {{for the first time in}} cleanup steps of ochratoxin analysis. These techniques and methods were applied to the first survey on the levels of OTA in coffee on the South African retail market (Chapter 5). The results suggest that the levels of OT A in the coffee on the South African market are somewhat higher than the levels of OTA in coffees on the European market. The possibility to biologically produce different halogen-ochratoxins by supplementing the growth medium of Aspergillus ochraceus with <b>halogen</b> <b>salts</b> was investigated. Bromoochratoxin A was produced for the first time in this way. Supplementation of inoculated wheat with potassium iodide and -fluoride resulted in the poisoning of the yeast and no iodoor fluoro-ochratoxin B was produced. It was found that Aspergillus ochraceus produced OTA in higher yields at elevated levels of potassium chloride. This finding has important commercial applications in the production ofOTA (Chapter 4). The ochratoxins are hydrolyzed in vivo by carboxypeptidase A. The hydrolysis of the ochratoxins and analogues by carboxypeptidase A was measured in vitro in a structurefunction relation study by employing mass spectrometric techniques. The kinetic data of the ochratoxins were compared to the values of a number of synthesized structural analogues. It was found that the halogen containing analogues had lower turnovers than their des-halo analogues. There were no substantial differences in the kinetic data between the different halogen containing analogues (Chapter 8). The toxicokinetics of OTA in vervet monkeys were determined for the first time. The clearance of OTA from the plasma suggested a two-compartment model and the elimination half-life was determined to be 19 - 21 days. The half-life of OTA in humans was determined by allometric calculations to be 46 days. We came to the conclusion that the long term consumption of OT A contaminated foods will lead to potentially hazardous levels of the toxin in the body (Chapter 9). This hypothesis can be substantiated by the incidence of OTA in the blood of various population groups. Possible ways to decontaminate OT A contaminated foods by degrading the compound biologically with yeast; moulds or lipases to non-toxic compounds were investigated. Eight moulds, 323 yeasts and 23 lipases were screened for ochratoxin degradation. A lipase from Aspergillus niger is the first lipase that was proven to degrade OTA (Chapter 7). Four yeasts were found to degrade OT A of which one, Trichosporon mucoides degraded OTA substantially within 48 hours in a growing culture (Chapter 6). In addition to this first report of yeasts which have the ability to degrade OTA, the fungi Cochliobolus sativus, Penicillium islandicum and Metarhizium anispoliae also proved to degrade OT A. OT A was degraded in all instances to the non-toxic ochratoxin a and the amino acid phenylalanine. Doctora...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Recently several field {{campaigns and}} {{satellite}} observations have found strong indications {{for the presence}} of bromine oxide (BrO) in the free troposphere. Using a global atmospheric chemistry transport model we show that BrO mixing ratios of a few tenths to 2 pmol mol − 1 lead to a reduction in the zonal mean O 3 mixing ratio of up to 18 % in widespread areas and regionally up to 40 % compared to a model run without bromine chemistry. A lower limit approach for the marine boundary layer, that does not explicitly include the release of <b>halogens</b> from sea <b>salt</b> aerosol, shows that for dimethyl sulfide (DMS) the effect is even larger, with up to 60 % reduction of its tropospheric column. This is accompanied by dramatic changes in DMS oxidation pathways, reducing its cooling effect on climate. In addition there are changes in the HO 2 : OH ratio that also affect NOx and PAN. These results imply that potentially significant strong sinks for O 3 and DMS have so far been ignored in many studies of the chemistry of the troposphere. ...|$|R

The determination of nonmetals from aqueous solutions has been limited to the sensitive, yet somewhat nonselective techniques of titration, spectrophotometry, ion-selective electrodes and chromatography. While adequate, the considerations of sample composition prohibit these techniques from being applied universally to routine analysis of complex mixtures in solution. In theory, atomic spectrometry possesses the ability to produce both sensitive and selective analytical response for all elements of the periodic table. Plasma emission spectrometry shows a number of advantages over conventional techniques of atomic emission due to the greater amount of energy available for the excitation processes. The application of these methods to halogen detection has been limited, however, {{due to the fact that}} the resonance transitions of the halide atoms possess energies in excess of 6. 9 eV. Consequently, the most intense emission of these species is observed primarily in the vacuum-ultraviolet (VUV) region of the atomic spectrum. The most ideal region for spectral analysis lies between 200 and 800 nm where vacuum constraints are absent and usual atomic spectroscopic systems are operable. Recently, a helium-microwave induced plasma (He-MIP) system has been described by our laboratories which provides a source of sufficient energy to achieve nonmetal excitation in this region. This report details the investigation of the direct determination of halides by He-MIP-AES.

40|$|Some {{years ago}} it was {{suggested}} that halogen negative ions [1] could offer a feasible alternative path to positive ions as a heavy ion fusion driver beam which would not suffer degradation due to electron accumulation in the accelerator and beam transport system, and which could be converted to a neutral beam by photodetachment near the chamber entrance if desired. Since then, experiments have demonstrated that negative halogen beams can be extracted and accelerated away from the gas plume near the source with a surviving current density close to what could be achieved with a positive ion of similar mass, and with comparable optical quality. In demonstrating the feasibility of halogen negative ions as heavy ion driver beams, ion � ion plasmas, an interesting and somewhat novel state of matter, were produced. These plasmas, produced near the extractor plane of the sources, appear, based upon many lines of experimental evidence, to consist of almost equal densities of positive and negative chlorine ions, with only a small component of free electrons. Serendipitously, the need to extract beams from this plasma for driver development provides a unique diagnostic tool to investigate the plasma, since each component - positive ions, negative ions, and electrons [...] can be extracted and measured separately. We discuss the relevance of these observations to understanding negative ion beam extraction from electronegative plasmas such as halogens, or the more familiar hydrogen of magnetic fusion ion sources. We suggest a concept which might improve negative hydrogen extraction by the addition of a halogen. The possibility and challenges of producing ion-ion plasmas with thin targets of <b>halogens</b> or, perhaps, <b>salt,</b> is briefly addressed. _________________________________________________...|$|R

5|$|The {{chemistry}} of unbinilium {{is predicted to}} be {{similar to that of the}} alkaline earth metals, but it would probably behave more like calcium or strontium than barium or radium. Like strontium, unbinilium should react vigorously with air to form an oxide (UbnO) and with water to form the hydroxide (Ubn(OH)2), which would be a strong base, and releasing hydrogen gas. It should also react with the <b>halogens</b> to form <b>salts</b> such as UbnCl2. While these reactions would be expected from periodic trends, their lowered intensity is somewhat unusual, as ignoring relativistic effects, periodic trends would predict unbinilium to be even more reactive than barium or radium. This lowered reactivity is due to the relativistic stabilization of unbinilium's valence electron, increasing unbinilium's first ionization energy and decreasing the metallic and ionic radii; this effect is already seen for radium. the {{chemistry of}} unbinilium in the +2 oxidation state should be more similar to the chemistry of strontium than to that of radium. On the other hand, the ionic radius of the Ubn2+ ion is predicted to be larger than that of Sr2+, because the 7p orbitals are destabilized and are thus larger than the p-orbitals of the lower shells. Unbinilium may also show the +4 oxidation state, which is not seen in any other alkaline earth metal, in addition to the +2 oxidation state that is characteristic of the other alkaline earth metals and is also the main oxidation state of all the known alkaline earth metals: this is because of the destabilization and expansion of the 7p3/2 spinor, causing its outermost electrons to have a lower ionization energy than what would otherwise be expected. The +1 state may also be stable in isolation. Many unbinilium compounds are expected to have a large covalent character, due to the involvement of the 7p3/2 electrons in the bonding: this effect is also seen to a lesser extent in radium, which shows some 6s and 6p3/2 contribution to the bonding in radium fluoride (RaF2) and astatide (RaAt2), resulting in these compounds having more covalent character. The standard reduction potential of the Ubn2+/Ubn couple is predicted to be −2.9V.|$|R
40|$|The {{first part}} of this {{laboratory}} study deals with heterogeneous reactions of bromine- and chlorine-containing species relevant to the atmosphere with solid model alkali salt substrates. The second part of this work treats the heterogeneous interaction of acidic compounds with various mineral dust substrates. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the role of adsorbed water, H 2 O(a) and the influence of defect surface sites on the reactions. Furthermore, reaction mechanisms are proposed for the different interactions. Steady state and pulsed valve uptake experiments have been performed in a low-pressure flow reactor. In order to characterise the solid samples images have been taken using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Furthermore, a few scans using a photoacoustic cell coupled to a FTIR spectrometer have been performed. First, the interaction of gaseous Cl 2, HCl, BrCl, Br 2, Cl 2 O and HOCl with solid KBr and furthermore, the reaction of Cl 2 O and HOCl on solid NaCl have been investigated. The reaction products of the reactions of Cl 2, Cl 2 O and HOCl with KBr have been Br 2 and BrCl. The reaction of Cl 2 O with KBr leads to slow additional formation of HOCl, BrOCl and Cl 2, and the reaction of HOCl with KBr leads to slow formation of HOBr, Cl 2 O, Br 2 O and BrOCl. The reaction of Cl 2 O on solid NaCl leads to formation of Cl 2 but also a slow formation of HOCl has been observed which is attributed to the reaction with adsorbed H 2 O(a). The interaction of HOCl with NaCl was immeasurably slow under our conditions. In order to measure the amount of adsorbed H 2 O(a) desorption experiments have been carried out and a calibration curve has been obtained. While performing desorption experiments on ground KBr grains and thin KBr films sprayed on a gold-coated substrate desorption of HOBr has been observed which we attributed to the presence of surface adsorbed molecular bromine. Using the SEM we found that pumping and heating the substrate lead to a better-ordered surface. The exposure of the salt sample to an excess of chlorine or bromine leads also to a recrystallisation of the surface. Furthermore, all reactions on alkali salt samples have shown that adsorbed halogen species are retained on the surface. These adsorbed species play a crucial role for the reactions of <b>halogens</b> with alkali <b>salt.</b> In the case of HOCl on KBr we explain the autocatalytic behaviour of the reaction by the presence of adsorbed halogen species, particularly Br 2. In the Cl 2 /KBr system a regeneration of the surface has been observed which we explain with desorption of adsorbed intermediates, but also by crystallisation of KCl that may lead to a recycling of reactive sites. In contrast to Cl 2 /KBr no regeneration of the substrate towards formation of gaseous bromine-containing species has been observed in the HOCl/KBr system. We explain this with the fact that KOH thermodynamically does not tend to crystallise in the presence of H 2 O as does the alkali halide. In the second part the reactions of CO 2, SO 2, HCl and HNO 3 on various CaCO 3 substrates such as roughened and polished marble and low- and high-ordered precipitated CaCO 3 have been carried out. Additionally, a few HNO 3 uptake experiments have been performed on dust substrates such as Saharan Dust, Kaolinite and Arizona Road Dust. On these substrates a fast uptake of HNO 3 but no reaction products have been observed. In the case of SO 2 and HCl interacting with precipitated CaCO 3 the observed reaction product has been CO 2. Whereas HNO 3 uptake experiments on precipitated CaCO 3 additionally lead to a slow formation of H 2 O. HCl uptake experiments on polished marble plates have not led to formation of any reaction product. However, HNO 3 uptake experiments on polished and roughened marble led to formation of H 2 O but not of CO 2. We explain these observations with the dependence of the rate of surface chemistry on the morphology of the sample. The HCl and HNO 3 uptake experiments on precipitated CaCO 3 have shown a delay in the formation of CO 2 whereas it is immediately released after the exposure of the CaCO 3 sample to SO 2. Furthermore, an uptake of CO 2 has been observed on precipitated CaCO 3. All uptake experiments on CaCO 3 have shown saturation due to a limited number of reactive sites. In order to explain these results we have speculated the existence of an intermediate species Ca(OH) (HCO 3). This intermediate may be formed by exposure of the CaCO 3 sample to ambient H 2 O and CO 2. Acidic compounds such as HCl and HNO 3 react rapidly with the basic OH part of the intermediate and subsequently more slowly with the bicarbonate part of the intermediate. This explains the delay of formation of CO 2 in the reaction of HCl and HNO 3 with CaCO 3. In contrast to acidic species, SO 2 attacks with preference the bicarbonate part of the intermediate. This leads to an immediate release of CO 2 after exposure of the CaCO 3 sample to SO 2. The reaction of SO 2 with the OH part of the intermediate leads to loss of SO 2. The mass balance between loss of SO 2 and yield of CO 2 has shown a deficiency of CO 2, which may be explained with a slow reaction with the OH part of the intermediate...|$|R
