5|$|After his Test debut, Hunt was {{expected}} to be the Queensland fullback in the first match of the three game State of Origin series. However, Queensland selectors decided to stay with incumbent Origin fullback Matt Bowen. The selectors reconsidered after Queensland lost the first game, selecting Hunt for the second match. In <b>his</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> Origin debut, Hunt ran with the ball seventeen times, making 196 metres. He missed the third Origin game because of a foot injury, sustained in the Broncos' Round 15 match, and was replaced by Clinton Schifcofske.|$|E
5|$|As {{provisional}} {{president in}} 1861, Davis formed his first cabinet. Robert Toombs of Georgia {{was the first}} Secretary of State and Christopher Memminger of South Carolina became Secretary of the Treasury. LeRoy Pope Walker of Alabama was made Secretary of War, after being recommended for this post by Clement Clay and William Yancey (both of whom declined to accept cabinet positions themselves). John Reagan of Texas became Postmaster General. Judah P. Benjamin of Louisiana became Attorney General. Although Stephen Mallory was not put forward by the delegation from <b>his</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> Florida, Davis insisted {{that he was the}} best man for the job of Secretary of the Navy, and he was eventually confirmed.|$|E
5|$|Freedom from Fear is {{the last}} of the {{well-known}} Four Freedoms oil paintings produced by the American artist Norman Rockwell. The series was based on the four goals known as the Four Freedoms, which were enunciated by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in <b>his</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> the Union Address on January 6, 1941. This work was published in the March 13, 1943, issue of The Saturday Evening Post alongside an essay by a prominent thinker of the day, Stephen Vincent Benét. The painting is generally described as depicting American children being tucked into bed by their parents while the Blitz rages across the Atlantic in Great Britain.|$|E

5|$|In 1936, Brown {{accepted}} a coaching position and employment {{as a car}} salesman {{to move back to}} Queensland, representing <b>his</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> birth from 1936–37 onwards. He was appointed captain the following season. Brown started the new season strongly, scoring 111 for Victor Richardson's XI in a testimonial match against Bradman's XI, in the opening match of summer. In November, Brown played for an Australian XI and Queensland in two matches against the touring England team, scoring 71 and 74 the two drawn matches.|$|E
5|$|In <b>his</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> the Union Address on 23 January 2007, President Bush {{announced}} plans to deploy more than 20,000 additional soldiers and Marines to Iraq in {{what became known as}} the Surge. Four thousand were specifically earmarked for Anbar, which Bush acknowledged had become both an AQI haven and a center of resistance against AQI. Instead of deploying new units, the Marine Corps chose to extend the deployments of several units already in Anbar: 1st Battalion 6th Marines, 3rd Battalion 4th Marines, and the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU). The 15th MEU would later be replaced by the 13th MEU as the last surge unit.|$|E
5|$|After twelve matches for <b>his</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> origin, Brown {{was still}} {{to end up}} on the winning side. This changed in the next match against New South Wales. After their opponents had made 214, Brown top-scored with 95 as Queensland replied with 200. New South Wales made 264 to leave Brown's men 279 for victory. The captain led the way, {{combining}} with Geoff Cook in Queensland's then record first-wicket partnership of 265. Brown was out for 168, but his team held on to secure an eight-wicket victory over New South Wales. It was Brown's first win in Queensland colours. He then scored 81 in a ten-wicket defeat to South Australia, before adding a second victory, this time over Victoria. Brown ended the season by amassing 215 as Queensland reached 7/575 declared before completing an innings win. Brown topped the aggregates with 1,057 runs and was the only player to pass 1,000 runs for the season.|$|E

5|$|During the 2008 election, New York state {{officials}} asserted that Al Franken Inc. {{had failed to}} carry required workers' compensation insurance for employees who assisted him with his comedy and public speaking from 2002 to 2005. Franken paid a $25,000 fine {{to the state of}} New York upon being advised his corporation was out of compliance with the state's workers' compensation laws. At the same time, the California Franchise Tax Board reported that the same corporation owed more than $4,743.40 in taxes, fines, and associated penalties in the state of California for 2003 through 2007, because the corporation did not file tax returns in the state for those years. A Franken representative said that it followed the advice of an accountant who believed when the corporation stopped doing business in California that no further filing was required. Subsequently, Franken paid $70,000 in back income taxes in 17 states dating back to 2003, mostly from his speeches and other paid appearances. Franken said he paid the income tax in <b>his</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> residence, and he would seek retroactive credit for paying the taxes in the wrong states.|$|E
5|$|Lenormand de Mezy: Lenormand de Mezy is {{the white}} master of a {{plantation}} and owns Ti Noel and Macandal among other black slaves. He has multiple wives, mistresses, and sexual encounters {{during the course of}} the novel. Following the quelled black uprising in Part Two, Lenormand de Mezy leaves <b>his</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> hiding and arrives in time to spare the lives of Ti Noel and some of his other slaves. He takes them to Cuba to protect his assets, but while there, he gambles with his slaves, drinks much alcohol, enjoys the company of women, and loses what remains of his wealth. Having lost Ti Noel in a card game, Lenormand de Mezy dies shortly after in abject poverty.Lenormand de Mezy's name may be based on an eponymous Haitian plantation where the historical Bouckman is said to have conducted his famous Bois Caiman ritual.|$|E
5|$|Nixon was a late {{convert to}} the {{conservation}} movement. Environmental policy {{had not been}} a significant issue in the 1968 election; the candidates were rarely asked for their views on the subject. He saw that the first Earth Day in April 1970 presaged a wave of voter interest on the subject, and sought to use that to his benefit; in June he announced the formation of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Nixon broke new ground by discussing environment policy in <b>his</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> the Union speech; other initiatives supported by Nixon included the Clean Air Act of 1970 and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA); the National Environmental Policy Act required environmental impact statements for many Federal projects. Nixon vetoed the Clean Water Act of 1972—objecting not to the policy goals of the legislation but to the amount of money to be spent on them, which he deemed excessive. After Congress overrode his veto, Nixon impounded the funds he deemed unjustifiable.|$|E

5|$|Whimpress tabled various {{hypotheses}} for Crockett's actions. At the time, Crockett was 37 {{years old}} {{and was ready to}} emerge from the shadow of Phillips, the eminent Australian umpire of the time. When Crockett called Marsh, it was his 29th match as a first-class umpire and the no-balling was seen in some quarters as a signal that he felt ready to officiate in Test matches. A cynical view of Crockett's calls held that if throwing was to be eradicated then the umpire was going to choose a soft target. This theory ruled out the calling of a fellow Victorian, <b>his</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> origin. The same line of reasoning concluded that a New South Welshman would be called, and likely not a high-profile Test player like Noble or Jack Saunders. Those who adhered to this hypothesis believed that it would be easier for Crockett to target someone who had a previous stigma of throwing and that Marsh—an aborigine who led the bowling averages with 21 wickets at 17.38—was an ideal target.|$|E
