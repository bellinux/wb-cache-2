5|$|Dracula's Daughter {{was not as}} {{successful}} as the original upon its release, although it was generally critically well-reviewed. In the intervening decades, criticism has been <b>deeply</b> <b>divided.</b> Modern critics and scholars have noted the strong lesbian overtones of the film, which Universal acknowledged {{from the start of}} filming and exploited in some early advertising.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{exhausted}} the JNA {{and proved}} {{a turning point}} in the Croatian war. A ceasefire was declared a few weeks later. Vukovar remained in Serb hands until 1998, when it was peacefully reintegrated into Croatia. It has since been rebuilt but has less than half of its pre-war population and many buildings are still scarred by the battle. Its two principal ethnic communities remain <b>deeply</b> <b>divided</b> and it has not regained its former prosperity.|$|E
5|$|Déby faces armed {{opposition}} from {{groups who are}} <b>deeply</b> <b>divided</b> by leadership clashes but united in their intention to overthrow him. These forces stormed the capital on 13 April 2006, but were ultimately repelled. Chad's greatest foreign influence is France, which maintains 1,000 soldiers in the country. Déby relies on the French to help repel the rebels, and France gives the Chadian army logistical and intelligence support for fear of a complete collapse of regional stability. Nevertheless, Franco-Chadian relations were soured by the granting of oil drilling rights to the American Exxon company in 1999.|$|E
50|$|Even fifty-five {{years later}} the case of Mašíns is able to <b>deeply</b> <b>divide</b> the Czech public into two groups: one seeing them as heroes, the other abhorring their {{sometimes}} brutal killings.

Petiole absent or much {{shorter than the}} lamina. Sterile portion of frond shallowly to <b>deeply</b> pinnately <b>divided.</b> Fertile portion entire to <b>deeply</b> pinnately <b>divided.</b> (A few species with fronds [...] pinnate-pinnatifid). Veins simple, free (not anastomosing). Hydathodes present. Sori round or elliptic, often slightly sunken, without paraphyses.|$|R
5000|$|Physaria is a genus of {{flowering}} {{plants in the}} mustard family. Many species are known generally as twinpods, bladderpods, or lesquerella. They are native to the Americas, with many species endemic to western North America. They are densely hairy annual and perennial herbs often growing prostrate or decumbent, along the ground in patches or clumps. They bear inflorescences of bright yellow flowers. The fruit is often notched <b>deeply,</b> <b>dividing</b> into twin sections, giving the genus its common name.|$|R
5|$|Harding {{sought and}} gained the 1910 Republican gubernatorial nomination. At that time, {{the party was}} <b>deeply</b> <b>divided</b> between {{progressive}} and conservative wings, and could not defeat the united Democrats; he lost the election to incumbent Judson Harmon. Harry Daugherty managed Harding's campaign, but the defeated candidate did not hold the loss against him. Despite the growing rift between them, both President Taft and former president Roosevelt came to Ohio to campaign for Harding, but their quarrels split the Republican Party and helped assure Harding's defeat.|$|E
5|$|In the {{subsequent}} election campaign, {{the party was}} <b>deeply</b> <b>divided</b> and unable to organise an effective political strategy. It changed leaders five times {{in less than two}} months, and in the 2002 general election decreased its share of the vote to 10.2%, almost two-thirds less than its previous share. Most of its voters sided with the ÖVP, which became the largest party in Austria with 43% of the vote. Nevertheless, the coalition government of the ÖVP and FPÖ was revived after the election; however, there was increasing criticism within the FPÖ against the party's mission of winning elections at any cost.|$|E
5|$|The Oriental Republic of Uruguay in South America had been, {{since its}} {{independence}} in 1828, troubled by strife between the Blanco Party and the Colorado Party. They were not {{political parties in}} the modern sense, but factions that engaged in internecine rebellion whenever the other dominated the government. The nation was <b>deeply</b> <b>divided</b> into Colorado and Blanco camps. These partisan groups formed in the 1830s and arose out of patron–client relationships fostered by local caudillos in the cities and countryside. Rather than a unity based upon common nationalistic sentiments, each had differing aims and loyalties informed by their respective, insular political frameworks.|$|E
50|$|The state's {{budget is}} another {{fiercely}} debated issue. Prior to Republican Governor Chris Christie taking office in 2009, the state regularly borrowed money to technically avoid deficits. Over the years, this practice generated {{a large amount}} of debt. Because of that, Governor Christie has refused to borrow money to cover shortfalls, and has instead demanded the state legislature agree to budget cuts. The {{question of whether or not}} public workers should bear the burden of budget cuts <b>deeply</b> <b>divides</b> the state.|$|R
50|$|Debates {{surrounding}} {{the implementation of}} Kyoto in Canada are informed {{by the nature of}} relationships between national, provincial, territorial and municipal jurisdictions. The federal government can negotiate multilateral agreements and enact legislation to respect their terms. However, the provinces have jurisdiction in terms of energy and therefore, to a large extent— climate change. In 1980, when the National Energy Program was introduced, the country was almost torn apart, <b>deeply</b> <b>dividing</b> the provinces along an East-West axis. Since then no federal government has had the courage to implement an intergovernmental, long-term, cohesive energy plan.|$|R

5|$|After the {{execution}} of the King in January 1649, England was declared a commonwealth and the Scots declared his son king as Charles II. The English responded with an invasion and, after defeats for the Scots at Dunbar in 1650 and Worcester in 1651, the English occupied the country in 1652, declaring Scotland part of the Commonwealth. In the period after the defeat at Dunbar the Kirk became <b>deeply</b> <b>divided,</b> partly in the search for scapegoats for defeat. Different factions and tendencies produced rival resolutions and protests, which gave their names to the two major parties as the Resolutioners, who were willing to make an accommodation with royalism, and the more hard line Protesters who wished to purge the Kirk of such associations. Subsequently, the divide between rival camps became almost irrevocable. After 1655 both groups appointed permanent agents in London.|$|E
5|$|Also in Oregon v. Mitchell, the Supreme Court {{addressed}} {{the constitutionality of}} various other provisions relating to voter qualifications and prerequisites to voting. The Court upheld Section 202, which prohibits any state or local jurisdiction from requiring people to live in their borders for longer than 30 days before allowing them to vote in a presidential election. Additionally, the Court upheld the provision lowering the minimum voting age to 18 in federal elections, but it held that Congress exceeded its power by lowering the voting age to 18 in state elections; this precipitated the ratification of the Twenty-sixth Amendment the following year, which lowered the voting age in all elections to 18. The Court was <b>deeply</b> <b>divided</b> in Oregon v. Mitchell, {{and a majority of}} justices did not agree on a rationale for the holding.|$|E
5|$|Feminist {{views on}} {{sexuality}} vary, and have differed by historical period and by cultural context. Feminist attitudes to female sexuality {{have taken a}} few different directions. Matters such as the sex industry, sexual representation in the media, and issues regarding consent to sex under conditions of male dominance have been particularly controversial among feminists. This debate has culminated in the late 1970s and the 1980s, in {{what came to be}} known as the feminist sex wars, which pitted anti-pornography feminism against sex-positive feminism, and parts of the feminist movement were <b>deeply</b> <b>divided</b> by these debates. Feminists have taken a variety of positions on different aspects of the sexual revolution from the 1960s and 70s. Over the course of the 1970s, a large number of influential women accepted lesbian and bisexual women as part of feminism.|$|E
40|$|The {{movement}} to develop, identify, and disseminate evidence-based treatments has been contentious. On the surface, it hardly seemed possible {{that anyone could}} or would object to the initial report issued by the Society of Clinical Psychology (Division 12) of the American Psychological Association (APA) in 1995 or anticipate that the movement associated with it would become so controversial. Surely, identifying, developing, and disseminating treatments that have empirical support should be encouraged, not discouraged, especially by a profession that {{is committed to the}} welfare of those whom it serves. Sensible as this may seem, the task force report was not only controversial; moreover, and unfortunately, it served to <b>deeply</b> <b>divide</b> the profession of clinical psychology and related mental health disciplines (Chambless & Hollon, 1998...|$|R

40|$|On the 28 September 2013, {{the interim}} {{government}} of Mansur ‘Adli announced the banning of the Muslim Brotherhood (MB). Apart {{from the fact that}} the ban <b>deeply</b> <b>divides</b> Egyptian society, we also need to consider the implications on the organisation. Of course, it is not possible to make predictions about the future. However, it is possible to examine the MB’s mobilising structures. By looking at shifts in these structures, we can say something about the MB’s political performance before President Mursi was removed from office and comment, albeit carefully, on whether the organisation will be able to reinvigorate its informal political networks in order to survive the new period of confinement. An assessment of the Brotherhood’s mobilisation capacity can give us an idea of the current state of its popular appeal...|$|R
5|$|This {{programme}} is one {{of three}} programmes that NATO is pursuing in the area of missile defence. The contract puts the Alliance on track for having, by 2010, a system to protect troops on missions against ballistic missiles. The contract is worth approximately 75 million EUR for work that would be conducted over a period of six years. The theatre missile defence would be a multi-layered system of systems, comprising early warning system sensors, radar and various interceptors. While NATO member countries would provide the sensors and weapon systems, NATO itself would develop a commonly funded NATO architecture to integrate all of these elements. The development of the ALTBMD system was agreed by NATO members in large part because it is limited. NATO members are <b>deeply</b> <b>divided</b> about the multi-tiered BMD architecture promoted by the US Missile Defense Agency (MDA).|$|E
5|$|Abraham Lincoln's {{constitutional}} election {{reflected the}} nation’s sectional divide, though 82 {{percent of the}} electorate had split among the Unionists, Lincoln, Stephen A. Douglas and John Bell. Even before Lincoln’s inauguration, the Deep South states that had cast Electoral College votes for John C. Breckinridge resolved to secede from the United States and form the Confederate States of America. The Virginia Assembly called a special convention {{for the sole purpose of}} considering secession from the United States. Virginia was <b>deeply</b> <b>divided,</b> returning a convention of delegates amounting to about one-third for secession and two thirds Unionist. But the Unionists would prove to be further divided between those who would be labelled Conditional Unionists who would favor Virginia in the Union only if Lincoln made no move at “coercion”, and those who would later be called Unconditional Unionists who would be unwavering in their loyalty to the constitutional government of the United States.|$|E
5|$|In Italy, {{the idea}} of an Unknown Soldier {{memorial}} was particularly popular, both because lists of memorial names were less common and because Italy had suffered particularly heavily from unidentifiable casualties {{as a result of the}} campaigns in the Alps — as many of 60% of the corpses buried at Redipuglia were unidentifiable. The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Rome was built in 1921, with other unidentifiable bodies being adopted by local cults of the dead across Italy. The Italian tomb was significant in political terms; Italy was <b>deeply</b> <b>divided</b> in the post-war years and the Liberal government hoped that the opening would reunify the country. In practice, the tomb became a point of tension between the Liberals and the Italian Fascist movement, and Benito Mussolini claimed to have timed his seizure of power the next year to ensure that the 1922 ceremonies at the tomb would occur under a Fascist government.|$|E
40|$|ADOLESCENTS {{with severe}} problems, who cannot live withtheir own families, have {{traditionally}} been considered as unsuit-able for fostering on the dual grounds that no other family would accept them and that their difficult behavior is not amenable to treatment by lay people. The Kent Family Placement Project dis-proved both statements. What is an Expert? This {{is not the place}} to question medical and educational exper-tise, which may be based on knowledge not available to the general public, but the expertise required to &dquo;treat&dquo; or &dquo;cure&dquo; disturbed or delinquent adolescents is generally a matter of skill in human relationships coupled with a good knowledge of available resources-medical, educational, recreational, employment, etc. It is the belief in the competence of &dquo;experts&dquo; which <b>deeply</b> <b>divides</b> the policies of the N.

40|$|Biofilms — matrix-enclosed {{microbial}} accretions that {{adhere to}} biological or non-biological surfaces — represent {{a significant and}} incompletely understood mode of growth for bacteria. Biofilm formation appears early in the fossil record (3. 25 billion years ago) and is common throughout a diverse range of organisms in both the Archaea and Bacteria lineages, including the 'living fossils' in the most <b>deeply</b> <b>dividing</b> branches of the phylogenetic tree. It is evident that biofilm formation is an ancient and integral component of the prokaryotic life cycle, and is a key factor for survival in diverse environments. Recent advances show that biofilms are structurally complex, dynamic systems with attributes of both primordial multicellular organisms and multifaceted ecosystems. Biofilm formation represents a protected mode of growth that allows cells to survive in hostile environments and also disperse to colonize new niches. The implications of these survival and propagative mechanisms {{in the context of}} both the natural environment and infectious diseases are discussed in this review...|$|R
40|$|Approaches {{combining}} {{social and}} political theory with ontology have rarely been utilised {{in the evaluation of}} decision-making processes. Drawing on such an approach clarifies the questions that still need to be asked about the policy response to HIV/AIDS in The Netherlands in the early 1980 s. The initial response in The Netherlands is internationally regarded as an example of successful cooperation between public authorities, health organisations, blood banks and the gay movement. In comparison with other countries, <b>deeply</b> <b>dividing</b> social conflicts as well as dramatic medical disasters were avoided. This image, however, is misleading. Although it was on a smaller scale than the disasters with contaminated blood products in other countries, The Netherlands had their blood scandal too. A reconstruction of this episode offers the opportunity to evaluate the role objects are granted in theories of institutionalisation and to critically examine the procedural notion of politics in actor network theory. The aim of the article is to show that analyses of decision-making processes under conditions of uncertainty ought to engage more carefully with processes of exclusion and the transformative role of objects...|$|R
5|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century, Cuban society was highly stratified, {{consisting}} of a Spanish creole ruling class of tobacco, sugar, and coffee plantation owners, a middle class of black and Spanish plantation workers, and an underclass of black slaves. The upper echelons of society were also <b>deeply</b> <b>divided</b> between the creoles and Spaniards (known as peninsulares), with the Spaniards benefiting greatly from the colonial regime. Cuba was a colony of Spain, although there were movements for independence, integration into the U.S., and integration with Spain. The roots of anarchism were first seen in 1857, when a Proudhonian mutualist society was founded. After being introduced to the ideas of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon by José de Jesus Márquez, Saturnino Martínez (an Asturian immigrant to Cuba) founded the periodical La Aurora in 1865. Directed at tobacco workers, it included the earliest advocation of cooperative societies in Cuba. By the Ten Years' War, the insurgents against Spain included expatriates from the Paris Commune, and others influenced by Proudhon, including Salvador Cisneros Betancourt and Vicente García.|$|E
5|$|The {{persecution}} in Africa {{also encouraged}} {{the development of}} Donatism, a schismatic movement that forbade any compromise with Roman government or traditor bishops (those who had handed scriptures over to secular authorities). One of the key moments in the break with the mainline Church occurred in Carthage in 304. The Christians from Abitinae {{had been brought to}} the city and imprisoned. Friends and relatives of the prisoners came to visit, but encountered resistance from a local mob. The group was harassed, beaten, and whipped; the food they had brought for their imprisoned friends was scattered on the ground. The mob had been sent by Mensurius, the bishop of the city, and Caecilian, his deacon, for reasons that remain obscure. In 311, Caecilian was elected bishop of Carthage. His opponents charged that his traditio made him unworthy of the office, and declared itself for another candidate, Majorinus. Many others in Africa, including the Abitinians, also supported Majorinus against Caecilian. Majorinus's successor Donatus would give the dissident movement its name. By the time Constantine took over the province, the African church was <b>deeply</b> <b>divided.</b> The Donatists would not be reconciled to the Catholic Church until after 411.|$|E
5|$|The root of {{the trouble}} was an {{economic}} crisis—initiated by the Panic of 1837—which was entering its sixth year in 1842. A speculative bubble had burst in 1836–39, causing a collapse of the financial sector and a subsequent depression. The country became <b>deeply</b> <b>divided</b> over the best response to the crisis. Conditions got even worse in early 1842 because a deadline was looming. A decade earlier, when the economy was strong, Congress had promised Southern states {{that there would be}} a reduction in hated federal tariffs. Northern states welcomed tariffs, which protected their infant industries. But the South had no industrial base and depended on open access to British markets for their cotton. In a recommendation to Congress, Tyler lamented that it would be necessary to override the Compromise Tariff of 1833 and raise rates beyond the 20 percent limit. Under the previous deal, this would suspend the distribution program, with all revenues going to the federal government.|$|E
40|$|COMPLETION DATE: 3 {{months from}} your {{registration}} date LEARNING ENVIRONMENT: This course requires assignment responses to be posted in a password-secured ONLINE website hosted by The Heritage Institute. COURSE DESCRIPTION: Contentious issues are typically {{the language used}} to describe issues that <b>deeply</b> <b>divide</b> us. They tend to be those controversial topics that policymakers and administrators often try to shield from students, {{with the thought of}} maintaining safety and security. Yet, students live and interact with a world replete with contentious issues and struggle to make sense of and navigate their way through them. One question then becomes, to what degree do schools have a responsibility to engage in the discussion of controversial issues? What are the appropriate roles for contentious issues in the classroom to engage students in what’s happening in their community, state or nation? Participants will first learn how to utilize contentious issues as a springboard for facilitating effective dialogue and non-hostile discussions. Secondly, participants will learn how to harness the power of the contentious issue by developing authentic civic responsibility exercised in collaboration with youth and community partners...|$|R
5000|$|Reform of {{the laws}} {{regarding}} illegal immigration to the United States operated as a wedge issue in 2007. Some Republican legislators, {{with the backing of}} President George W. Bush, sought to address the dual issues of ongoing illegal immigration to the United States and the illegal status of an estimated 12 million people currently living in America. Other Republicans bitterly opposed any [...] "amnesty" [...] for illegal immigrants, out of fear that their constituents were unsupportive of immigration reform. Some Democrats pitched in to keep the issue alive as they recognized the issue was <b>deeply</b> <b>dividing</b> the Republican party between advocates of reform and advocates of the status quo. The result was a bitter division in Republican ranks and a stalled bill in Congress; columnist Peggy Noonan wrote in January 2008 that President Bush had [...] "destroyed the Republican Party, by which I mean he sundered it, broke its constituent pieces apart and set them against each other", by pushing immigration reform, as well as other wedge issues for the Republicans.|$|R

40|$|Based on {{the turmoil}} of the 2 ̆ 7 crisis years 2 ̆ 7 (1998 - 2003) and the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Island (RAMSI) years (2003 - 2007), this paper explores {{epistemological}} issues that <b>deeply</b> <b>divide</b> the way that Solomon Islanders look at prosperity and good government {{and the way that}} foreign aid donors, RAMSI and Australia see the future for Solomon Islands. State-building or re-building {{is not the same as}} nation-building based on local concepts of the good life. The stakes are high, and as the Sogavare Government (2006 - 2007) indicated, substantial changes are needed to RAMSI, with a clear exit strategy or amalgamation of its central features into the central government structure. Unless RAMSI can come to terms with Solomon Islands 2 ̆ 7 epistemological and related political issues, there is no future for the Mission. The paper looks first at the post-RAMSI period, before concentrating on epistemological and political differences, and uses Malaita Province as an example of local circumstances that apply in all areas of the troubled nation. The argument on the epistemology of development is drawn from the writings of David Gegeo and Karen Watson Gegeo, and my personal experience...|$|R
40|$|The dynamic {{mechanisms}} by which RNAs acquire biologically functional structures are of increasing importance to the rapidly expanding fields of RNA therapeutics and biotechnology. Large energy barriers separating misfolded and functional states arising from alternate base pairing are a well-appreciated characteristic of RNA. In contrast, it is typically assumed that functionally folded RNA occupies a single native basin of attraction that is free of <b>deeply</b> <b>dividing</b> energy barriers (ergodic hypothesis). This assumption is widely used as an implicit basis to interpret experimental ensemble-averaged data. Here, we develop an experimental approach to isolate persistent sub-populations of a small RNA enzyme and show by single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET), biochemical probing and high-resolution mass spectrometry that commitment to one of several catalytically active folds occurs unexpectedly high on the RNA folding energy landscape, resulting in partially irreversible folding. Our experiments reveal the retention of molecular heterogeneity following {{the complete loss of}} all native secondary and tertiary structure. Our results demonstrate a surprising longevity of molecular heterogeneity and advance our current understanding beyond that of non-functional misfolds of RNA kinetically trapped on a rugged folding-free energy landscape...|$|R
