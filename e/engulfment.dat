5|$|Whale {{morphology}} shows {{a number}} of examples of convergent evolution, the most obvious being the streamlined fish-like body shape. Other examples {{include the use of}} echolocation for hunting in low light conditions— which is the same hearing adaptation used by bats— and, in the rorqual whales, jaw adaptations, similar to those found in pelicans, that enable <b>engulfment</b> feeding.|$|E
5|$|Glycocalyx is {{produced}} by many bacteria to surround their cells, and varies in structural complexity: ranging from a disorganised slime layer of extracellular polymeric substances to a highly structured capsule. These structures can protect cells from <b>engulfment</b> by eukaryotic cells such as macrophages (part of the human immune system). They can also act as antigens and be involved in cell recognition, as well as aiding attachment to surfaces {{and the formation of}} biofilms.|$|E
5|$|Prokaryotes {{inhabited}} the Earth from approximately 3–4 billion years ago. No obvious changes in morphology or cellular organisation occurred in these organisms {{over the next}} few billion years. The eukaryotic cells emerged between 1.6–2.7 billion years ago. The next major change in cell structure came when bacteria were engulfed by eukaryotic cells, in a cooperative association called endosymbiosis. The engulfed bacteria and the host cell then underwent coevolution, with the bacteria evolving into either mitochondria or hydrogenosomes. Another <b>engulfment</b> of cyanobacterial-like organisms {{led to the formation of}} chloroplasts in algae and plants.|$|E
5|$|Phagocytosis is an {{important}} feature of cellular innate immunity performed by cells called 'phagocytes' that engulf, or eat, pathogens or particles. Phagocytes generally patrol the body searching for pathogens, but can be called to specific locations by cytokines. Once a pathogen has been engulfed by a phagocyte, it becomes trapped in an intracellular vesicle called a phagosome, which subsequently fuses with another vesicle called a lysosome to form a phagolysosome. The pathogen is killed by the activity of digestive enzymes or following a respiratory burst that releases free radicals into the phagolysosome. Phagocytosis evolved {{as a means of}} acquiring nutrients, but this role was extended in phagocytes to include <b>engulfment</b> of pathogens as a defense mechanism. Phagocytosis probably represents the oldest form of host defense, as phagocytes have been identified in both vertebrate and invertebrate animals.|$|E
25|$|Most dinophyte chloroplasts are {{secondary}} red algal derived chloroplasts. Many other dinophytes {{have lost}} the chloroplast (becoming the nonphotosynthetic kind of dinoflagellate), or replaced it though tertiary endosymbiosis—the <b>engulfment</b> of another eukaryotic algae containing a red algal derived chloroplast. Others replaced their original chloroplast with a green algal derived one.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} hours of the morning of 14 June 2017, a fire at the Grenfell Tower engulfed the building, killing at least seventy-nine residents. It was speculated even whilst events were {{unfolding}} that a recent refurbishment of the block had, through the flammable cladding panels that were added to the exterior, contributed to the speed of <b>engulfment</b> of the whole building.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the {{integration}} process, support came {{primarily from the}} two governments and their social elites; neither the Senegalese nor the Gambian people at large were particularly interested in integration. Once the threat of political instability began to dissipate, both sides began {{to move back to}} their traditional fears and stereotypes of the other. The Gambian government (and the Gambian people) began to fear losing their own power and identity through Senegalese <b>engulfment.</b> Hughes and Lewis, in their Senegambia analysis, list many problems with unions which often lead to failure, which this union shared.|$|E
500|$|Bacteria often produce {{proteins}} or sugars that coat {{their cells}} and interfere with phagocytosis; these are called capsules. Some examples are the K5 capsule and O75 O antigen {{found on the}} surface of Escherichia coli, and the exopolysaccharide capsules of Staphylococcus epidermidis. [...] Streptococcus pneumoniae produces several types of capsule that provide different levels of protection, and group A streptococci produce proteins such as M protein and fimbrial proteins to block <b>engulfment.</b> Some proteins hinder opsonin-related ingestion; Staphylococcus aureus produces Protein A to block antibody receptors, which decreases the effectiveness of opsonins.|$|E
500|$|Bacteria {{were also}} {{involved}} in the second great evolutionary divergence, that of the archaea and eukaryotes. Here, eukaryotes resulted from the entering of ancient bacteria into endosymbiotic associations with the ancestors of eukaryotic cells, which were themselves possibly related to the Archaea. This involved the <b>engulfment</b> by proto-eukaryotic cells of alphaproteobacterial symbionts to form either mitochondria or hydrogenosomes, which are still found in all known Eukarya (sometimes in highly reduced form, e.g. in ancient [...] "amitochondrial" [...] protozoa). Later on, some eukaryotes that already contained mitochondria also engulfed cyanobacterial-like organisms. This {{led to the formation}} of chloroplasts in algae and plants. There are also some algae that originated from even later endosymbiotic events. Here, eukaryotes engulfed a eukaryotic algae that developed into a [...] "second-generation" [...] plastid. This is known as secondary endosymbiosis.|$|E
500|$|Antigen {{presentation}} {{is a process}} in which some phagocytes move parts of engulfed materials back to the surface of their cells and [...] "present" [...] them to other cells of the immune system. There are two [...] "professional" [...] antigen-presenting cells: macrophages and dendritic cells. After [...] <b>engulfment,</b> foreign proteins (the antigens) are broken down into peptides inside dendritic cells and macrophages. These peptides are then bound to the cell's major histocompatibility complex (MHC) glycoproteins, which carry the peptides back to the phagocyte's surface where they can be [...] "presented" [...] to lymphocytes. Mature macrophages do not travel far from the site of infection, but dendritic cells can reach the body's lymph nodes, where there are millions of lymphocytes. This enhances immunity because the lymphocytes respond to the antigens presented by the dendritic cells just as they would {{at the site of the}} original infection. But dendritic cells can also destroy or pacify lymphocytes if they recognize components of the host body; this is necessary to prevent autoimmune reactions. This process is called tolerance.|$|E
60|$|With {{the utmost}} {{difficulty}} a sea anchor was rigged and tumbled over the Halfmoon's pitching bow into the angry sea, that was rising to more gigantic proportions with each succeeding minute. This frail makeshift which at best could but keep the vessel's bow into the wind, saving her from instant <b>engulfment</b> in the sea's trough, seemed to Theriere but a sorry means of prolonging {{the agony of}} suspense preceding the inevitable end. That nothing could save them was the second officer's firm belief, nor was he alone in his conviction. Not only Simms and Ward, but every experienced sailor on the ship felt that {{the life of the}} Halfmoon was now but a matter of hours, possibly minutes, while those of lesser experience were equally positive that each succeeding wave must mark the termination of the lives of the vessel and her company.|$|E
50|$|Grain entrapment, or grain <b>engulfment,</b> {{occurs when}} a person becomes {{submerged}} in grain and cannot get out without assistance. This more frequently occurs at storage facilities such as silos or grain elevators, but {{has been known to}} occur around any large quantity of grain, even freestanding piles outdoors. Usually, unstable grain collapses suddenly, wholly or partially burying workers who may be within it. Entrapment occurs when victims are partially submerged but cannot remove themselves; <b>engulfment</b> occurs when they are completely buried within the grain. <b>Engulfment</b> has a very high fatality rate.|$|E
