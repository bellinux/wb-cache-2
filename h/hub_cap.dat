500|$|The {{unit was}} {{reactivated}} again at RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, on 1April 1968, employing the Plessey [...] "Hub Cap" [...] automated air defence system, which utilised Westinghouse radar and Marconi computer programs. It {{was to have}} moved directly from Butterworth to Amberley but delivery of the <b>Hub</b> <b>Cap</b> system, ordered in 1965, was delayed owing to programming issues. The system was also physically larger and heavier than had been anticipated, rendering it less easily transportable. In 1979, No.114 MCRU upgraded to the Westinghouse AN/TPS-43 radar system, improving both its mobility and its tactical capabilities. It inaugurated the RAAF's Tactical Air Defence System (TADS, subsequently Tactical Air Defence Radar System or TADRS) on 10July 1985. No.114 MCRU was presented with a Squadron Standard on 23May 1990, becoming the only non-flying unit in the Air Force to receive such an honour. The standard displays battle honours for the Pacific (1943–45), New Britain (1943), New Guinea (1943–44) and Borneo (1945). No.114 MCRU was transferred to RAAF Base Tindal, Northern Territory, in May–June 1997, and then to RAAF Base Darwin in December 1999. The AN/TPS-43 was retired in September 2005, and replaced by the AN/TPS-77 radar. In May 2007, a detachment of 75 members of No.114 MCRU deployed for active service at Kandahar Airfield in southern Afghanistan, utilising the AN/TPS-77 to coordinate coalition combat air operations. The detachment returned to Australia in August 2009. No.114 MCRU celebrated its 70th anniversary at Darwin on 23May 2013. It marked ten years service with the AN/TPS-77 radar in November 2015.|$|E

50|$|In the 1980s Barkin's {{interests}} {{turned to}} collaborative endeavors, real-time interactive music-making, {{out of which}} emerged UCLA's Experimental Workshop. She joined UCLA's Javanese and Balinese Gamelan ensembles and made 5 trips to Bali and Java to study new music for gamelan {{under the auspices of}} a University of California Pacific Rim Research Grant with colleagues Linda Burman-Hall, Sue Carole DeVale, and David Cope. In 1989 Barkin, Benjamin Boretz and James K. Randall co-founded the OPEN SPACE Music publications series. (See http://the-open-space.org) During these decades she composed and wrote works concerning gender issues, explored music educational practices wherein students were encouraged to become more actively involved in their own agendas, and sought ways to write and talk about music that were experiential, literary, or poetic {{in an effort to get}} in and out of the head of the listener, and perhaps the composer, during the listening process. Many texts - whether for print medium, live performance or tape collage - blur distinctions between words and music or merge theoretical commentary with the creative process in poetic-graphic form. A lifelong interest in arts & crafts led to the making of <b>hub</b> <b>cap</b> mask-collages, using paint, shells, and various recyclables. Starting in 2004, the Sibelius music notation software enabled her to use the computer as a performance medium, its flexibility and precision a liberating experience.|$|E

5000|$|C. M. [...] "Tad" [...] Smith Coliseum is an 8,867-seat {{multi-purpose}} arena on {{the campus}} of the University of Mississippi. Through the first part of the 2015-16 basketball season, it was home to the University of Mississippi Rebels men's and women's basketball teams, but was replaced by a new arena, The Pavilion at Ole Miss, in January 2016. It has also hosted many concerts, one of which was The Allman Brothers with Gov't Mule in November 1995.The circular building, similar to many arenas constructed at the time, has a 272-foot-diameter white steel-framed, Neoprene-covered roof which tops out at 89 feet above the court. From its exterior, it looks like a giant <b>hub</b> <b>cap.</b> The floor, 130' from end to end with its Rebel red and blue trim, is located twelve feet below the surrounding ground level. The seats were replaced in 2001 with navy blue upholstered seats. In 2010 the Tad Pad was upgraded. These upgrades included a unique new center hung video display, featuring four LED boards approximately 7 feet high by 13 feet wide. Two ring displays are also part of the center hung structure and are able to show a variety of graphics, animations and statistical information. Overall the display measures approximately 17 feet high by 24 feet wide and also features four dedicated scoring sections. In addition to this upgrade, Daktronics provided a custom sound system for the newly renovated arena. The outside of the building includes red Mississippi brick and blue vinyl-covered steel siding. It is located to the southwest of the center of campus, west of Vaught-Hemingway Stadium and across the street from the Robert C. Khayat Law Center.

40|$|ABSTRACTThe global {{price of}} oil, {{which is both}} finite and limited in quantity, has been rising {{steadily}} because of the increasing requirements for energy in both developing and developed countries. Furthermore, regulations have been strengthened across all industries to address global warming. Many studies of hull resistance, propulsion and operation of ships have been performed {{to reduce fuel consumption}} and emissions. This study examined the design parameters of the propeller boss cap fin (PBCF) and <b>hub</b> <b>cap</b> for 6, 000 TEU container ships to improve the propulsion efficiency. The design parameters of PBCF have been selected based on the geometrical shape. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis with a propeller open water (POW) test was performed to check the validity of CFD analysis. The design of experiment (DOE) case was selected as a full factorial design, and the experiment was analyzed by POW and CFD analysis. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to determine the correlation among design parameters. Four design alternatives of PBCF were selected from the DOE. The shape of a propeller <b>hub</b> <b>cap</b> was selected as a divergent shape, and the divergent angle was determined by the DOE. Four design alternatives of PBCF were attached to the divergent <b>hub</b> <b>cap,</b> and the POW was estimated by CFD. As a result, the divergent <b>hub</b> <b>cap</b> with PBCF has a negative effect on the POW, which is induced by an increase in torque coefficient. A POW test and cavitation test were performed with a divergent <b>hub</b> <b>cap</b> with PBCF to verify the CFD result. The POW test result showed that the open water efficiency was increased approximately 2 % with a divergent <b>hub</b> <b>cap</b> compared to a normal cap. The POW test result was similar to the CFD result, and the divergent <b>hub</b> <b>cap</b> with the PBCF models showed lower open water efficiency. This was attributed to an increase in the torque coefficient just like the CFD results. A cavitation test was performed using the 2 models selected. The test result showed that the hub vortex is increased downstream of the propeller...|$|E

40|$|Recycling {{capacities}} in Germany for post-user automobiles {{are estimated}} {{as well as}} the economy of separation of large car components like bumpers, cooler grating and <b>hub</b> <b>caps.</b> Costs of disassembling, plastic separation and utilization are evaluated. Based on the recycling capacities of eight plants in Germany it is concluded, that the total capacities in Germany are sufficient for the recycling of large car components. Plastics from bumpers (PP/EPDM, PC/PBT, PC/PET, SMC, or PUR-(R) RIM), from cooler gratings (ABS, ABS/ASA, ASA, PA, PP, or SMC), and from <b>hub</b> <b>caps</b> (PA, ABS, ABS/PC, PP-T and others) may be separated via milling or granulating. Future expansion of plastics recycling from post-user cars may include motor covers under the hood (PA 6 GF 10 M 20), air ducts (PA 6 GF 30),, wheel bearings, gasoline tanks and large car-body components.

50|$|Probably one {{the rarest}} models ever {{produced}} by IH was the 1980 RS: the Special Limited Edition RS Scout. This package was only {{available on the}} Traveler in Tahitian Red (metallic). It had special extras inside and out, including polycast wheels with Tahitian Red (metallic) accent, luxurious plush all-velour russet interior including headliner and visors, special pin striping, wood grain trim instrument panel and shift console, chrome bumpers, tinted glass, and more. Two other special packages offered in 1980 were the 844 and 434 Gold Star Models. The 844 offered standard equipment plus a 345 V-8, HD clutch, T428 4-speed manual transmission, 2.72 rear axle ratio, AM radio, rear seat, <b>hub</b> <b>caps,</b> special black side applique and paint on lower body, and black carpet while the 434 offered standard equipment plus 4-196 engine, T332 3-speed transmission, 3:73 rear axle ratio, black vinyl interior, AM radio, rear seat, <b>hub</b> <b>caps,</b> special black side applique and paint on lower body, and black carpet.|$|R
5000|$|In mid-1986, a new Limited Edition was {{launched}} in Mexico: The Volkswagen Europa Edition 1. This was the first Volkswagen available in Mexico in many years painted in black; besides this special painting, this new Limited Edition had chrome <b>hub</b> <b>caps</b> (the norm in the 80's were matt finished <b>hub</b> <b>caps),</b> inside it had seats upholstered in a honeycomb black and white design with Recaro headrests, plus an AM/FM stereo cassette player radio (usually the only audio equipment available on Mexican Beetles were the eternal Sapphire XI AM monoaural radio) with two speakers and a basket below the dashboard, as well as side and rear special badges. This year, the Volkswagen received a [...] "double diagonal" [...] braking system, already seen in the Caribe, Atlantic and the Corsar, this system was characterized by connecting the right front brake, with the rear left brake, and vice versa. In addition, the Volkswagen received an intermittent modality in its wiper/washer system. However, the metallic colors were no longer available.|$|R
