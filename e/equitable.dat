5|$|Tracing {{is divided}} into two forms, common law tracing and <b>equitable</b> tracing. Common law tracing relies on the {{claimant}} having legal ownership of the property, and will fail if the property has been mixed with other property, the legal title has been transferred to the defendant, or the legal title has been transferred by the defendant to any further recipient of the property. <b>Equitable</b> tracing, on the other hand, relies on the claimant having an <b>equitable</b> interest in the property, and can succeed where the property has been mixed with other property.|$|E
5|$|Belloni {{issued a}} final {{ruling that the}} tribes were {{entitled}} to a fair and <b>equitable</b> portion of the fish harvest. The court retained continuing jurisdiction, and his order was not appealed.|$|E
5|$|Shared 50/50 custody {{has some}} unique {{configurations}} to ensure <b>equitable</b> time sharing, {{for example the}} 2-2-5-5 arrangement shown below.|$|E
5|$|As {{a general}} rule, {{there is no}} {{requirement}} for particular formalities in trust instruments, they can be oral or written. The only requirement is that they show an intention to create a trust. The exceptions are where it is a transfer of land, the transfer of existing <b>equitable</b> interests, or where the trust is made in a will.|$|E
5|$|Implementation of {{congestion}} pricing has reduced congestion in urban areas, but has also sparked criticism and public discontent. Critics maintain that {{congestion pricing}} is not <b>equitable,</b> places an economic burden on neighboring communities, {{has a negative}} effect on retail businesses and on economic activity in general, and represents another tax levy.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, {{construction}} of the building began, with a design by Der Scutt, of Poor, Swanke, Hayden & Connell, and development by Trump and the <b>Equitable</b> Life Assurance Company (renamed the AXA <b>Equitable</b> Life Insurance Company in 2004). Although it is in one of Midtown Manhattan's special zoning districts, the tower was approved because {{it was to be}} built as a mixed-use development. Trump was permitted to add more stories to the tower because of the atrium on the ground floor. There were controversies during construction, including the destruction of historically important sculptures from the Bonwit Teller store; Trump's alleged underpaying of contractors; and a lawsuit that Trump filed because the tower was not tax-exempt.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{strengthen}} relationships within clans and communities, {{and to promote}} moderation and <b>equitable</b> distribution of resources, Andrianampoinimerina decreed that families should build larger, monolithic stone tombs to hold the remains of all family members, and that the construction of these tombs was to be undertaken as a shared responsibility {{among members of the}} family to be entombed there.|$|E
5|$|The General Assembly Task Force on Security Council Reform has {{delivered}} a Report (on {{the question of}} <b>equitable</b> representation on and increase in {{the membership of the}} Security Council) recommending a compromise solution for entering intergovernmental negotiations on reform.|$|E
5|$|The feminist {{movement}} has effected change in Western society, including women's suffrage; {{greater access to}} education; more nearly <b>equitable</b> pay with men; the right to initiate divorce proceedings; the right of women to make individual decisions regarding pregnancy (including access to contraceptives and abortion); {{and the right to}} own property.|$|E
5|$|The new {{objectives}} and purposes {{focused on the}} need to enhance the game of Australian football and ensure that players played a strong {{role in the development of}} the game, received fair terms and conditions, and were apportioned an <b>equitable</b> share of revenue.|$|E
5|$|William Morgan :Morgan was the {{appointed}} Actuary of the Society for <b>Equitable</b> Assurances in 1775. He expanded on Mores's and Dodson's work, {{and may be}} considered {{the father of the}} actuarial profession in that his title became applied to the field as a whole.|$|E
5|$|A July 1861 {{address to}} the people of Bourbon County, {{authored}} by Hawes and other like-minded Democrats, blamed Republicans for starting the Civil War, denounced the coercion of states to remain in the Union, and warned that the Lincoln administration would fight to end slavery. The address {{called for an end to}} the war, recognition of the Confederate States of America as a sovereign nation, and <b>equitable</b> distribution of the national debt and federal property.|$|E
5|$|An {{injunction}} is an <b>equitable</b> {{private law}} remedy that restrains a public body from doing {{an act that}} is wrongful or ultra vires. Following law reforms in the United Kingdom in 1977, it became possible for the High Court of England and Wales to grant prerogative orders {{as well as a}} declaration or injunction in the same set of legal proceedings. As these reforms have not been followed in Singapore, the Singapore High Court is not empowered to grant injunctions under Order 53 of the Rules of Court.|$|E
5|$|Another flaw {{with both}} Wilberforce's and Millett's {{explanations}} {{is that if}} the interest is retained by the lender from the outset of the contract, it is not a resulting trust at all; the complete transfer of money should end the lender's <b>equitable</b> interest. It could be argued that the creation of a Quistclose trust is not based on the recovery of the original interest, but {{the creation of a new}} one. Doubts have also been raised about the Twinsectra case in general, in that the facts of the case did not create a stereotypical Quistclose trust; this causes problems with applying Millett's analysis.|$|E
5|$|Cabin in the Cotton (1932) is a Warner Bros. message {{film about}} the evils of capitalism. The film takes place in an {{unspecified}} southern state where workers are given barely enough to survive and taken advantage of by being charged exorbitant interest rates and high prices by unscrupulous landowners. The film is decidedly anti-capitalist; however, its preface claims otherwise: In the end, however, the planters admit their wrongdoing and agree to a more <b>equitable</b> distribution of capital.|$|E
5|$|Denning made {{sweeping}} {{changes to the}} Common Law, with the resurrection of <b>equitable</b> estoppel and his reform of divorce law. A common misconception {{is that most of}} his judgments were overturned in the House of Lords; many were, including the expansion to the doctrine of fundamental breach he set out in Photo Production Ltd v Securicor Transport Ltd, but they let many judgments stand and on occasion agreed with his judgment in situations where he dissented, such as in his final case George Mitchell (Chesterhall) Ltd v Finney Lock Seeds Ltd in 1983.|$|E
5|$|Health care {{delivery}} in Nigeria is a concurrent {{responsibility of the}} three tiers of government in the country, and the private sector. Nigeria has been reorganising its health system since the Bamako Initiative of 1987, which formally promoted community-based methods of increasing accessibility of drugs and health care services to the population, in part by implementing user fees. The new strategy dramatically increased accessibility through community-based healthcare reform, resulting in more efficient and <b>equitable</b> provision of services.|$|E
5|$|In October 2012, an ICSID {{tribunal}} {{awarded a}} judgment of $1.8 billion for Occidental Petroleum {{against the government}} of Ecuador. Additionally, Ecuador had to pay $589 million in backdated compound interest {{and half of the}} costs of the tribunal, making its total penalty around $2.4 billion. The South American country annulled a contract with the oil firm {{on the grounds that it}} violated a clause that the company would not sell its rights to another firm without permission. The tribunal agreed the violation took place but judged that the annulment was not fair and <b>equitable</b> treatment to the company.|$|E
5|$|In {{the general}} election, Knott {{defeated}} Republican Thomas Z. Morrow {{by a margin}} of nearly 45,000 votes. During his term in office, he asked the legislature to conduct a thorough reform of the state's tax system, but the legislators' only response was to create a board of equalization charged with making <b>equitable</b> tax assessments. The legislature also refused to grant the Railroad Commission all the powers Knott had requested.|$|E
5|$|Macdonald {{consistently}} {{called for}} a more <b>equitable</b> redistribution of wealth, so that poorer provinces such as Nova Scotia, could share fully in Canada's prosperity. Biographer Stephen Henderson writes that Macdonald deserves credit for the introduction, in 1957, of an equalization scheme designed to enable poorer provinces to provide comparable levels of services to their citizens. Macdonald's advocacy of provincial autonomy however, fell victim to the centralizing tendencies of a post-war welfare state in which the federal government increasingly assumed greater control over national social programs.|$|E
5|$|Members of the Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) {{along with}} Kasargod MP P Karunkaran staged a protest on 8 September 2010 at the airline's office in Mangalore where they {{submitted}} a memorandum to officials demanding that {{families of the}} victims receive early and <b>equitable</b> settlements of compensation due. They also demanded the settlement process be made more transparent by opening it to the media rather than holding sessions in camera.|$|E
5|$|Often feminist economists use country-level {{or smaller}} case studies focused on {{developing}} and often understudied countries or populations. For example, Michael Kevane and Leslie C. Gray examine how gendered social norms {{are central to}} understanding agricultural activities in Burkina Faso. Cristina Carrasco and Arantxa Rodriquez examine the care economy in Spain to suggest that women's entrance into the labor market requires more <b>equitable</b> caregiving responsibilities. Such studies show the importance of local social norms, government policies and cultural situations. Feminist economists see such variation as a crucial factor {{to be included in}} economics.|$|E
5|$|On {{the eve of}} World War II in 1939, SBC, {{like other}} Swiss banks, was the {{recipient}} of large influxes of foreign funds for safekeeping. Just prior to {{the outbreak of the}} war, SBC made the timely decision to open an office in New York City. The office, located in the <b>Equitable</b> Building, was able to begin operations {{a few weeks after the}} outbreak of the war and was intended as a safe place to store assets in the case of an invasion. During the war, the banks' traditional business fell off and the Swiss government became their largest client.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{auctioning}} permits provides {{the government with}} revenues. These revenues {{could be used to}} fund low-carbon investment, and also fund cuts in distortionary taxes. Auctioning permits can therefore be more efficient and <b>equitable</b> than allocating permits (Hepburn, 2006, pp.236–237). Ross Garnaut states that full auctioning will provide greater transparency and accountability and lower implementation and transaction costs as governments retain control over the permit revenue.|$|E
5|$|The {{bill was}} part of a large reform {{movement}} to prevent <b>equitable</b> courts such as the Court of Chancery from undermining their business. It was far cheaper and faster than the older equivalents used by the Chancery and Common Pleas, leading to a drop in their business and an increase in that of the King's Bench. As such, the Chancery issued injunctions in an ineffective attempt to prevent its use. The Bill was finally abolished by the Uniformity of Process Act 1832.|$|E
5|$|This caused Blamey to {{despatch}} {{a medical}} mission headed by Fairley to the United States and the United Kingdom in September 1942 {{to present the}} Army's case for a more adequate and <b>equitable</b> share of anti-malarial supplies. The mission was successful. Fairley was able to secure supplies and expedite the delivery of those that were already on order but held up for lack of shipping or priority. In bringing the problem {{to the attention of}} the highest allied military and civil authorities overseas, he lifted the global profile and priority of malaria control measures.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{southern}} cities at the time, Chicago did not segregate {{most public}} accommodations. According to Walter Francis White of the NAACP, pre-1915 Chicago {{had a good}} reputation for <b>equitable</b> treatment of African Americans. However, unofficially, early 20th-century Chicago beaches were racially segregated. African Americans {{had a long history}} in Chicago, the city sending its first African-American representative to the state legislature in 1876. However, the black population in 1900 was only about 1 percent, while it expanded dramatically {{in the early years of}} the century. Most Irish Americans and African Americans competed for low-end jobs, causing tension between the groups.|$|E
5|$|Wollstonecraft wields the English philosopher John Locke's {{definition}} of property (that is, ownership acquired through labour) against Burke's notion of inherited wealth. She contends that inheritance {{is one of}} the major impediments to the progress of European civilization, and repeatedly argues that Britain's problems are rooted in the inequity of property distribution. Although she did not advocate a totally equal distribution of wealth, she did desire one that was more <b>equitable.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{retiring}} from baseball, Tenney {{worked for the}} <b>Equitable</b> Life Insurance Society and continued writing for The New York Times. In 1912, he was vice-president of the Usher–Stoughton shoe manufacturing company in Lynn, Massachusetts; later, he formed the Tenney–Spinney Shoe Company in partnership with Henry Spinney. He was balloted for the National Baseball Hall of Fame from 1936–1942 and again in 1946, but never received more than eight votes, receiving eight (3.1% of total ballots cast) during the Baseball Hall of Fame balloting in 1938. Tenney died on July 3, 1952 at Massachusetts General Hospital after a long illness. He was interred at Harmony Chapel and Cemetery in Georgetown.|$|E
5|$|As {{one of the}} two {{principal}} common law courts along with the Common Pleas, the King's Bench's jurisdiction and caseload was significantly challenged by the rise of the Court of Chancery and <b>equitable</b> doctrines in the 15th and 16th centuries. To recover, the King's Bench undertook a scheme of revolutionary reform, creating less expensive, faster and more versatile types of pleading in the form of bills as opposed to the more traditional writs. Although not immediately stemming the tide, in the long term it helped the King's Bench not only recover but increase its workload. While there was a steep decline in business from 1460 to 1540, as the new reforms began to take effect the King's Bench's business was significantly boosted; between 1560 and 1640, it rose tenfold.|$|E
5|$|Between 2006 and 2007, Texas spent $7,275 {{per pupil}} ranking it below the {{national}} average of $9,389. The pupil/teacher ratio was 14.9, {{below the national}} average of 15.3. Texas paid instructors $41,744, {{below the national average}} of $46,593. The Texas Education Agency (TEA) administers the state's public school systems. Texas has over 1,000 school districts- all districts except the Stafford Municipal School District are independent from municipal government and many cross city boundaries. School districts have the power to tax their residents and to assert eminent domain over privately owned property. Due to court-mandated <b>equitable</b> school financing for school districts, the state has a controversial tax redistribution system called the"Robin Hood plan". This plan transfers property tax revenue from wealthy school districts to poor ones. The TEA has no authority over private or home school activities.|$|E
5|$|Born in Georgetown, Massachusetts, Tenney {{was one of}} {{the first}} players to enter the league after graduating college, where he served as a left-handed catcher for Brown University. Signing with the Beaneaters, Tenney spent the next 14 seasons with the team, {{including}} a three-year managerial stint from 1905–1907. In December 1907 Tenney was traded to the Giants as a part of an eight-man deal; after two years playing for New York, he re-signed with the Boston club, where he played for and managed the team in 1911. After retiring from baseball, Tenney worked for the <b>Equitable</b> Life Insurance Society before his death in Boston on July 3, 1952.|$|E
5|$|Diocletian {{separated}} and enlarged the empire's civil and military services and reorganized the empire's provincial divisions, establishing {{the largest and}} most bureaucratic government {{in the history of the}} empire. He established new administrative centres in Nicomedia, Mediolanum, Antioch, and Trier, closer to the empire's frontiers than the traditional capital at Rome had been. Building on third-century trends towards absolutism, he styled himself an autocrat, elevating himself above the empire's masses with imposing forms of court ceremonies and architecture. Bureaucratic and military growth, constant campaigning, and construction projects increased the state's expenditures and necessitated a comprehensive tax reform. From at least 297 on, imperial taxation was standardized, made more <b>equitable,</b> and levied at generally higher rates.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} in office, Ross {{proposed}} tax reform laws intended to provide for more <b>equitable</b> assessments of propertyat that time, people were allowed to assess their own belongings with little oversight. The legislature passed his recommendations, and approved his plan to exert more control over school funds and to require local taxation to support the public schools. He also encouraged the legislature to enact antitrust laws. These were passed March 30, 1889, a full year before the federal government enacted the Sherman Antitrust Act. His reform acts were beneficial for the state, leading Ross to become the only Texas governor to call a special session of the legislature {{to deal with a}} treasury surplus.|$|E
5|$|Early {{attempts}} by Ernest Flagg {{to limit the}} height of New York's skyscrapers in 1896 failed; further unsuccessful attempts followed between 1906 and 1908, and legislation was turned down again in 1909, partially because of pressure from the real estate industry. After 1913, however, the property market in New York entered a recession, and vacancy levels in buildings began to rise. The campaign for change was helped by {{the construction of the}} <b>Equitable</b> Building in 1915 at the estimated cost of $29 million ($10.9 billion in 2010 terms), which rapidly became infamous as its vast height and bulk blocked views and cast neighbours into permanent shade. The real estate industry finally ceased its objections to new legislation, and the 1916 Zoning Resolution was passed.|$|E
5|$|Feminist economists' work on {{globalization}} is diverse and multifaceted. But {{much of it}} is tied together through detailed and nuanced studies {{of the ways in which}} globalization affects women in particular and how these effects relate to socially just outcomes. Often country case studies are used for these data. Some feminist economists focus on policies involving the development of globalization. For example, Lourdes Benería argues that economic development in the Global South depends in large part on improved reproductive rights, gender <b>equitable</b> laws on ownership and inheritance, and policies that are sensitive to the proportion of women in the informal economy. Additionally, Nalia Kabeer discusses the impacts of a social clause that would enforce global labor standards through international trade agreements, drawing on fieldwork from Bangladesh. She argues that although these jobs may appear exploitative, for many workers in those areas they present opportunities and ways to avoid more exploitative situations in the informal economy.|$|E
