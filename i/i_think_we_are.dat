500|$|The team {{held two}} Organized Team Activities (OTAs) {{prior to the}} draft, in {{addition}} to 12 throughout May and June. The OTAs were voluntary, however, most players did attend. Many players routinely worked on their conditioning and strength together, in addition to [...] "informal" [...] on field training. A week prior {{to the end of}} OTAs Mike Tomlin said he was happy with the team's progress during the sessions. Also stating, “We are having a productive off-season {{and that is what we}} are here for. We are here to get better individually and collectively and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> doing that.” Limas Sweed experimented on special teams play for the first time ever, with a concentration in punt blocking. On the day of the final OTA, June 12, Tomlin stated that while he was pleased with the progress of the team, no positions would be gained or lost based on the voluntary camp. Tomlin added, [...] "it's been teach-oriented, it's been skill-develop-oriented. It's different than playing the game of football." [...] The team was given 44days off until the beginning of training camp.|$|E
500|$|In June 2009, singer Michael Jackson {{died at the}} age of 50 {{following}} cardiac arrest. Three {{weeks after}} Jackson's death, celebrity news website TMZ.com (who were the first media outlet to report his death) obtained a 24-second snippet of a song entitled [...] "A Place with No Name", and released it on the Internet. At the time of the leak [...] there were news reports that there was a [...] "vast vault" [...] and [...] "dozens and dozens" [...] of unreleased Jackson songs that could be issued for several years to come. The curator of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Jim Henke, commented that any future Jackson releases would receive a significant amount of attention, stating, [...] "What we have seen happen in the last three weeks is that the albums that are out here right now are selling in amazing numbers. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> going to see amazing interest in any released Michael Jackson material that will come out in the future or a year from now on." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{comeback}} {{was confirmed}} when Girls Aloud's official website posted on 9 October a countdown {{that would last}} until 19 October, when the girls would make a special announcement. It was speculated that they would make an appearance on BBC's Strictly Come Dancing, where bandmate Kimberley Walsh joined as a contestant. However, on 15 October, the surprise, a single titled [...] "Something New", leaked online in full. The official radio premiere of the song was then brought forward to the following day, with Girls Aloud posting on their website, [...] "It's here!

[...] "Something New" [...] was released on 16 November 2012 by Polydor Records through digital download, serving as the official Children in Need 2012 single. When asked about how she felt with the group being back together and the reception from the public, Walsh said, [...] "I'm kind of flattered people actually care if we come back or not. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> all quite proud that we made enough of an impact {{to be able to}} a comeback." ...|$|E

500|$|November's {{first game}} {{was at the}} Mata Real against Paços de Ferreira. Benfica scored first with a header by Cristian Rodríguez, but Tiago Valente tied the game {{a few minutes later}} for Paços. In the 85th minute, Kostas Katsouranis scored Benefica's winning goal with an assist by Rodríguez. To Camacho, the win was [...] "difficult but very important". On 6 November, Benfica played Celtic on the road. In their second game against the team, Benfica lost 1–0 on a goal by Aiden McGeady. With the loss, Benfica was in last place and needed to defeat Milan to remain in the Champions League. Although Camacho was optimistic, he was aware of the high stakes. On 11 November, Benfica hosted Boavista in search of their fourth {{consecutive}} win in the Primeira Liga. Cardozo scored in the first half, with Boavista tying the score in the 58th minute. Benfica then scored five goals in the final 40 minutes for a 6–1 win. After the match, Rui Costa said, [...] "We had our fourth consecutive win in the Primeira Liga, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> on the right track." [...] After a third international break, Benfica resumed on the 24th with an away game against Académica. Lito scored first for Académica, but a free kick by Rui Costa tied the game. Académica goalkeeper Ricardo made two errors, allowing Luisão and Adu to score Benfica's second and third goals, and Camacho credited the late win to his players' perseverance and commitment. November ended with a decisive match against Milan. Andrea Pirlo scored for Benfica, but Maxi Pereira's 23th-minute shot tied the game. Benfica's fate was determined by events in Glasgow, as Celtic defeated Shakhtar Donetsk with an added-time goal. Camacho bemoaned his team's luck: [...] "We're a bit unhappy. For what we did in this competition I think we should have had more of a chance to go through, so for me football has not been fair to Benfica." ...|$|E

2500|$|In post-game analysis, both coaches {{told the}} press they {{believed}} they had the better team.

2500|$|After the Imperial Japanese Navy was defeated, the Emperor called Yonai to his castle. The Emperor amiably invited Yonai to {{have lunch}} together. After that, the Emperor said, [...] "I really {{appreciated}} your reign and effort not to begin the war. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> not going to meet often like before". He put a pen and inkstone into a case and said, [...] "These {{are the things that}} I have used. I would like to present this as a gift to you." [...] (Agawa, n.d.). This action is extremely rare because having presented the belongings of the Emperor is the supreme honor and the utmost expression of amiability.|$|E

2500|$|McKellar {{attended}} {{a summer camp}} for the blind {{as part of his}} research. He wanted to observe how blind people interacted in groups. He discovered that excessive expositional dialogue, usually frowned upon by writers, was essential for the groups. McKellar cut one of the last lines in the novel from his screenplay: [...] "I don't think we did go blind, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> blind. Blind but seeing. Blind people who can see, but do not see." [...] McKellar believed viewers would by that point have already grasped the symbolism and didn't want the script to seem heavy-handed. He also toned down the visual cues in his screenplay, such as the [...] "brilliant milky whiteness" [...] of blindness described in the novel. McKellar knew he wanted a stylistically adept director and didn't want to be too prescriptive, preferring only to hint at an approach.|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, General Martin Luther Agwai, head of {{the joint}} African Union – United Nations Operation, said {{the war was over}} in the region, {{although}} low-level disputes remained. [...] "Banditry, localised issues, people trying to resolve issues over water and land at a local level. But real war as such, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> over that," [...] he said. This perspective is contradicted by reports which indicate that violence continues in Darfur while peace efforts have been stalled repeatedly. Violence between Sudan's military and rebel fighters has beset Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile states since disputed state elections in May 2011, an ongoing humanitarian crisis that has prompted international condemnation and U.S. congressional hearings. In 2012, tensions between Sudan and South Sudan reached a boiling point when the Sudanese military bombed territory in South Sudan, leading to hostilities over the disputed Heglig (or Panthou) oil fields located along the Sudan-South Sudan border.|$|E
2500|$|Moffat {{had always}} {{intended}} for Amy and Rory {{to get married}} [...] "from the off". Gillan stated, [...] "What I love about that relationship is that we really saw it develop {{to get to the}} stage where they were happy together. Because we started off at a point where Amy didn't want to be committed to him, and he absolutely did, and that just gave us somewhere to go with it, rather than just them being happy together. So it was interesting, and it evolved, and Rory really became a hero in the process". She was pleased that the audience was able to see Amy's life [...] "pan out", starting {{when she was a child}} and through her marriage and daughter. Gillan stated that the aftermath of [...] "A Good Man Goes to War" [...] would [...] "change her in a big way for the long run and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> going to get to see Amy in a really different light". According to Moffat, by the seventh series, Amy and Rory had become [...] "a crack team"; so used to being the Doctor's companions that instead of marvelling at him they [...] "treat him like a big kid they have to look after".|$|E

2500|$|Critics have {{referred}} {{to the music of}} HIM as gothic rock, gothic metal, alternative rock, alternative metal, and dark rock. The band themselves {{have referred}} to their music as [...] "love metal", the title of their fourth studio album. According to Ville Valo, the term [...] "love metal" [...] was coined as a response to people having difficulties categorizing their music. In regards to HIM being labeled a [...] "goth band", Valo responded by stating: [...] "We can't do anything about that , but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> a special shade of goth, more tender than others. In Finnish tradition, our music is very melancholic." [...] Valo has described HIM's sound as [...] "sentimental, hard-hitting rock music". According to Valo, since the beginning the band's intent was to combine more melodic and melancholic elements, with heavier influences. Valo has often cited Black Sabbath and Type O Negative as HIM's biggest influences. Some of the band's further influences include Paradise Lost, Anathema, My Dying Bride, Cathedral, Electric Wizard, Monster Magnet and Norwegian black metal. Regarding HIM's sound, Valo has also stated that: [...] "We never tried to claim that we have reinvented the wheel of rock 'n' roll. We've always been proud to be the torchbearers for Sabbath, Type O, Paradise Lost and Anathema, and a lot of those bands." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mollie King {{spoke about}} the album's sound saying {{that she had been}} joining playing on the studio [...] "messing around" [...] with a certain track. [...] "30 Days" [...] is about being a part from the person you love and {{counting}} down the minutes until you're back together. [...] "The song really struck a chord with us - it's a situation all of us can relate to, and we think a lot of fans will relate to it as well." [...] Rochelle Humes explained the concept of the single, [...] "It’s a really amazing, catchy song but the sentiment behind it is being all excited and counting down the days to seeing someone when you’ve really been missing that person." [...] The band revealed that they wanted to create an album which was [...] "amazing", [...] "crazy" [...] and [...] "very pop". King said [...] "What About Us" [...] features [...] reggae pop music influence, a little different from what band usually record, but the track is still really [...] "dancey" [...] and [...] "upbeat", as well a good song to dance to on either stage or at a club. When Una Healy was asked what the song was about she said that she [...] "did not know" [...] what the song was exactly about. [...] "To be honest I {{was trying to figure out}} the other day what exactly it's about. I could bullshit away telling you, but I really don't know. But I think it's all about someone driving you crazy." [...] She said she [...] "thinks" [...] that 'What About Us' part means [...] "me and you getting together". She did point out that she did know that the song was about [...] "making you happy" [...] and that the track was good for the summer and will get you on the dancefloor. Rochelle Humes said that the band had recorded a new track, which features a more [...] "edgy" [...] vibe than their previous material. She also said that the track would be released at the end of Summer, which was revealed to be [...] "Gentleman". She also said [...] "It's very dancey", and that they hoped to experiment with other types of music genres on the album, she said: [...] "It's going to be a lot more edgy than our previous stuff and what we are known for. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> definitely a pop band so we will carry on doing what we do best." [...] She said that her most favourite thing about being a singer is that she can try out different styles of genres. The band warned fans that the new album would have a [...] "fresh sound". Although, the said they weren't changing the sound too much. [...] "It's a fresh start for a new album as it's got that slight reggae vibe, but is still a dance pop record." ...|$|E
