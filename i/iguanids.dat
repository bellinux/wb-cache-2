500|$|Endemic to Utila, {{an island}} off the {{northern}} Honduras coast, Ctenosaura bakeri is an inhabitant of [...] of mangrove forests. [...] Unique among <b>iguanids</b> and rare among reptiles, {{it is believed that}} C. bakeri was pushed into the mangrove swamps due to competition from the larger, more aggressive C. similis, which typically inhabits the drier habitats on Utila. It has interbred with this very species and produced viable offspring. From evolutionary and ecological perspectives, inhabiting brackish mangrove forests entails very specific adaptations of diet, behavior, and resource utilization. It is one of only two known species of lizard, the other being a species of anole, Anolis utilensis, that lives solely in mangrove forests.|$|E
500|$|The Cuban iguana's {{eyes have}} a golden iris and red sclera. Cuban iguanas have {{excellent}} {{vision and the}} ability to detect shapes and movement at long distances. Sensory cells called [...] "double cones" [...] give them sharp color vision and enable them to see ultraviolet wavelengths. By seeking out locations with more ultraviolet sunlight to bask in, the Cuban iguana optimizes vitamin D production. Cuban iguanas have poor low-light vision, because they have few rods or photoreceptor cells. [...] Like other <b>iguanids,</b> Cuban iguanas have a white photosensory organ on the top of their heads, called the parietal eye. This [...] "eye" [...] has only a rudimentary retina and lens and cannot form images, but it is sensitive to changes in light and can detect movement.|$|E

500|$|As {{opposed to}} other West Indian islands where <b>iguanids</b> are found, {{consumption}} of iguana meat is not widespread in Cuba. Certain fishing communities do practice it for subsistence, {{but for the}} most part the animal is not eaten by Cubans. According to naturalist Thomas Barbour, this is based on unfounded superstitious beliefs which suggest that the iguanas emit a dark fluid reminiscent of the black vomit of yellow fever victims when they are killed. [...] One of the reasons for their decline is habitat destruction caused by the overgrazing of farm animals, housing development, and the building of tourist resorts on the beaches where the animals prefer to build their nests. Populations of iguanas suffer by the direct predation of introduced animals such as rats, cats, and dogs. Feral hogs are responsible for destroying many iguana nest sites which they dig up for eggs. Ant predation of iguana eggs is another threat to the species.|$|E
5000|$|Iguanid lizards (sensu lato) are {{distributed}} throughout the Americas, on Madagascar, and on Fiji and Tonga in the western South Pacific. The Malagasy forms are basal, with an estimated divergence date from the others of ~162 million years, not long before the time of Madagascar's separation from Africa. This suggests that <b>iguanids</b> once had a widespread Gondwanan distribution; after the Malagasy and New World representatives were isolated by vicariance, the remaining Gondwanan <b>iguanids</b> became extinct through competition with other Old World lizard groups. In contrast, western Pacific <b>iguanids</b> are nested deeply within American <b>iguanids,</b> having apparently colonized their isolated range after a remarkable 10,000 km rafting event.|$|E

[...] Females guard the nest of three to six eggs, which is unusual for <b>iguanids.</b> [...] Hatchlings emerge from their eggs in the rainy season and obtain moisture by licking wet leaves.|$|E
5000|$|Like most <b>iguanids,</b> {{the cape}} spinytail iguana is {{primarily}} herbivorous, eating flowers, leaves, stems, fruit, and cactus {{such as the}} bushy Jatropha cuneata and the taller, spindly Solanum hindsianum.

5000|$|Pariguana (meaning [...] "near Iguana" [...] in Greek) is an extinct genus of <b>iguanid</b> lizard {{from the}} Late Cretaceous of western North America. It is known {{from a single}} type species, Pariguana lancensis, named in 2012 {{on the basis of}} a partial lower jaw from the Lance Formation in eastern Wyoming. This jaw bone comes from a layer dated {{approximately}} 650,000 years before the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event. Pariguana is the oldest definitive <b>iguanid</b> from North America, and may represent the first stage of the iguanian evolutionary radiation from Asia into North America.|$|R
50|$|The {{species is}} closely related to the Fiji banded iguana and B. bulabula. Brachylophus is thought to be descended from ancestral iguanas that rafted 9000 km west across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas, where their closest {{relatives}} are found. Alternatively, it has been suggested they are the descendants of a more widespread lineage of (now extinct) Old World <b>iguanids</b> that diverged from their New World relatives in the Paleogene.|$|E
50|$|Brachylophus {{species are}} the most {{geographically}} isolated iguanas in the world. Their closest extant relatives (the genera Amblyrhynchus, Conolophus, Ctenosaura, Cyclura, Iguana and Sauromalus) are present in primarily tropical regions of the Americas and islands in the Galápagos and Lesser and Greater Antilles. Several of these genera are adapted to xeric biomes. The location of members of Brachylophus, so distant from all other known extant or extinct <b>iguanids,</b> has long presented a biogeographical enigma.|$|E
50|$|The agamids show {{a curious}} distribution. They are found {{over much of}} the Old World, {{including}} continental Africa, Australia, southern Asia, and sparsely in warmer regions of Europe. They are, however, absent from Madagascar and the New World.

A similar faunal divide is found in between the boas and pythons.|$|E
