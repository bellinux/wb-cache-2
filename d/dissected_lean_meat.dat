40|$|Title of the paper: Accuracy of dual energy X-ray {{absorptiometry}} (DXA) for {{the determination}} of the body composition of pigs in vivo New methods for the measurement of the body composition in vivo (or post mortem) like DXA need to be evaluated before routine use in livestock research or performance testing. Two body weight groups of pigs I) 30 – 50 kg (n= 61) and II) 70 – 90 kg (n= 62) were studied in this analysis. The whole bodies of the pigs were analyzed by a GE Lunar DPX-IQ scanner in vivo for the amount and percentage of fat, lean tissue, bone mineral, and the bone mineral density as well. Three days later, pigs were slaughtered and after a 24 h cooling period, the reference parts (shoulder, loin, side, and ham) of the left carcass half were <b>dissected</b> into <b>lean</b> <b>meat,</b> fat, bone, tendons, connective tissue and skin according to the EU reference method. Generally, DXA variables explained a high proportion of variation (R²> 0. 8; √MSE= 70 – 784 g) in the tissue masses of the reference parts (fat, muscle, bone) in both weight groups. The fat percentage of the reference parts and the DXA whole body results (in vivo) showed a very high relationship with a maximum R²= 0. 82 (√MSE= 1. 47 %) for group II. Slightly lower was the relationship between the <b>lean</b> <b>meat</b> content (%) of the reference parts and DXA results in vivo (R 2 = 0. 72; √MSE= 1. 75) for group II. The bone percentage was predicted with R²= 0. 3 (√MSE= 0. 64), caused by the very different analysis methods. Generally, DXA is a suitable method for growth studies in the above body weight range. In order to predict the percentage of muscle (<b>lean</b> <b>meat)</b> or fat tissue accurately by DXA, pigs should weigh > 50 kg, since the soft tissue percentages of group I resulted in R²≤ 0. 38 (√MSE≤ 2. 55) ...|$|R

The carcass composition was evaluated on 168 pigs by serial slaugter at 20, 50, 80 and 110 kgLW. The chemical composition ws examined in only 62 of these animals. The carcasses were partitioned into four cuts and <b>dissected</b> into <b>lean</b> <b>meat,</b> fatty tissue, rind and bones. Ad libitum feeding resulted in daily weight gain exceeding restricted feeding in te three weight ranges by 42 %, 17 % and 7 % and feed conversion ratios by 3 %¬ 15 % and 9 %, respectively. Castrated males exceeded daily weight gains of females by 6 %. At 20 kg the carcass moisture content was 65 % for both sexes, which on averace over feed rgimens at 110 kg decreased to 56 %and 52 % for females and castrated males respectively. Correspondingly, the carcass crude fat (CF) content increased from 13 % to 24 % and 30 %, respectively. At 110 kg LW on restricted feedingthe carcass meat content of females exceeded that of castrated males by 1. 7, and on ad libitum feeding by 3. 9 prcentage units; corresponding, carcass atty tissue of castrated males exeeded those values for females by 0. 5 and 3. 9 percentae units, respectively. Daily carcas crude protein (CP) accretion on ad libitum feedig for females and castrated males for the interval 22 - 111 LW was, on average, 95 g. Daily accretion on ad libitum feeding exeeded that on restricted feeding by 34 %. Ad libitum fed castrated males and females showed daily CF accretion rates 0 f 231 g and 158 g, respectively. Ad libitum feeding increased weights of liver over restrictd feeding by 12 % (p< 0. 001). Feed regimen also influenced CF content of muscles. It is concluded that feed regimen influenced arcass CP content at slaughter only to a limited extent, but greatly influenced daily CP accretion. However, carcass CF content and daily CF accretion were largely influenced by feed regimen and sex. These differeces became manifest after 50 kg LW.

40|$|Estimation of the <b>lean</b> <b>meat</b> {{percentage}} of rib loin part between the 9 - 11 th ribs was investigated using images of 41 carcass cross-section of embryonic cloning cattle and full-sib testing cattle.

In addition, the muscle area percentage was calculated by dividing each muscle area by cross-section area. The <b>lean</b> <b>meat</b> percentage was obtained through dissection for separation from the rib loin part between 9 - 11 th ribs. The correlation coefficients of <b>lean</b> <b>meat</b> percentage with each muscle area, muscle area percentage and muscle area ratio were investigated. The actual area of M. iliocostalis and M. serratus ventralis showed significant correlations with <b>lean</b> <b>meat</b> percentage (r= 0. 46 and - 0. 34 respectively). Percentage of M. iliocostalis, M. serratus ventralis, M. longissimus thoracis and M. trapezius areas showed significant correlations with <b>lean</b> <b>meat</b> percentage (r= 0. 50, - 0. 35, 0. 53 and 0. 33 respectively). The highest correlation was recognized between <b>lean</b> <b>meat</b> percentage and muscle area (r= 0. 53).

After grading, 20 carcases of each group were <b>dissected</b> and <b>lean</b> and adipose cuts were weighed.

Vitamin supplementation increased <b>lean</b> <b>meat</b> (50. 91 vs. 47. 86 %) and total carcass lean cuts content (63. 40 vs. 60. 97 %) and reduced backfat thickness (28. 30 vs. 33. 50 mm) and adipose cut percentage (24. 10 vs. 25. 78) without affecting markedly pH and colour of biceps femoris...|$|R
40|$|The {{quality of}} sheep carcass is mostly {{determined}} by the total <b>lean</b> <b>meat</b> production, meat distribution on the carcass {{and the quality of}} meat. Calpastatin gene (CAST) is known to have an association with carcass and meat quality traits. The objective of this research was to identify the association between CAST polymorphisms and carcass characteristics in Thin Tail Sheep (TTS). Thirty three heads of sheep representing three genotypes of CAST (CAST- 11, CAST- 12 and CAST- 22) were identified for carcass and meat characterisation. There {{was no significant difference between}} CAST polymorphisms with meat tenderness, pH, water holding capacity and cooking loss, neither with carcass weight and dressing percentage among genotypes. Shoulder proportion of CAST- 11 genotype was larger than that of CAST- 12 or CAST- 22, but the <b>lean</b> <b>meat</b> proportion of CAST- 22 genotype in shoulder, rack and loin were higher than those of CAST- 11 but not different from CAST- 12. The fat percentage of CAST- 11 was the highest among the genotypes. CAST- 22 genotype has higher <b>lean</b> <b>meat</b> percentage than the CAST- 11. Variation in CAST gene could be used as marker assisted selection in sheep for higher <b>lean</b> <b>meat</b> proportion...|$|R

40|$|Slovenian {{results on}} pig carcass classifi cation {{according}} to SEUROP (average <b>lean</b> <b>meat</b> percentage, carcass weight, measurements {{of fat and}} muscle and their variability) are presented for years from 1996 to 2004. In these years, an important increase of average <b>lean</b> <b>meat</b> percentage was noted (51. 9 % in year 1996 vs. 55. 9 % in year 2004). As a consequence the percentage of pig carcasses being graded into S and E classes was almost tripled from 1996 to 2004 (21. 3 to 58. 2 %, respectively). This improvement was initiated by the payment according to the <b>lean</b> <b>meat</b> percentage, to which pig breeders responded by better management of herds and partly by increased use of pietrain breed. Potential for further improvement remains in attaining genetically more uniform herds and reduction of carcass weight variability.

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} was to {{characterize}} the growth, fattening performance and carcass value of pigs and the factors which influence them. The attention was devoted to classification of pig carcasses in SEUROP system. There were observed feeding parameters of 20 batches from January 2014 to April 2015. The average quantity of pigs in one batch was 471. 3 heads. The average initial weight was 26. 9 kg, the average period of fattening lasted 106. 7 days, the average slaughter weight was 112. 7 kg, the average daily weight gain was achieved 0. 81 kg/head/day, the average consumption of complete feed mixture for 1 fattening day was 2. 19 kg, the average consumption of complete feed mixture of 1 kg weight gain was 2. 72 kg, the average loss caused by mortality during the fattening course was 2. 26 %. There were used 2 737 of carcasses in the following experiment. The pigs were slaughtered in slaughterhouse A and in slaughterhouse B. The average carcass weight was 89. 2 kg. The average <b>lean</b> <b>meat</b> content was estimated at 57. 7 %. In the class S there were classified 446 carcasses (16. 3 %) with an average <b>lean</b> <b>meat</b> content of 61. 3 %, in the class E there were classified 1 870 carcasses (68. 3 %) with an average <b>lean</b> <b>meat</b> content of 57. 9 %, and in the class U there were classified 421 carcasses (15. 4 %) with an average <b>lean</b> <b>meat</b> content of 53. 5 %.
