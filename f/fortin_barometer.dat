Fitzroy barometers combine the standard mercury barometer with a thermometer, {{as well as a}} guide of how to interpret pressure changes. [...] Fortin barometers use a variable displacement mercury cistern, usually constructed with a thumbscrew pressing on a leather diaphragm bottom. [...] This compensates for displacement of mercury in the column with varying pressure. [...] To use a <b>Fortin</b> <b>barometer,</b> the level of mercury is set to the zero level before the pressure is read on the column. [...] Some models also employ a valve for closing the cistern, enabling the mercury column to be forced {{to the top of the}} column for transport. [...] This prevents water-hammer damage to the column in transit.|$|E
50|$|Fortin is chiefly {{remembered for}} his design of barometer, now called a <b>Fortin</b> <b>barometer,</b> which he {{introduced}} in about 1800. In this, the mercury cistern has a glass portion {{through which the}} mercury exposed to the atmosphere can be seen, and an ivory needle which was made just to touch its mirror image in the mercury before the reading was taken. This allows for the fact that, when the mercury column in the closed tube falls, the level in the cistern rises, and the difference in height between the two cannot be accurately determined unless {{the height of the}} latter is taken into account.|$|E

50|$|The {{clock is}} similar to other {{mechanical}} clocks, except {{that it does not}} need winding. The change of pressure in the Earth's atmosphere acts as an external energy source and causes sufficient movement of the winding mechanism. This keeps the mainspring coiled inside the barrel. The clock is designed to enable the timepiece to run indefinitely and overwinding is prevented by a safety mechanism. The prime mover, encased in a finely detailed clock body, is a <b>Fortin</b> mercury <b>barometer.</b> The barometer contained 68 kilograms (150 pounds) of mercury (approximately 5 litres).|$|R
30|$|The H 2 S {{generator}} {{is composed}} of a dropping funnel (1) containing 1  mol/L aqueous H 2 SO 4 solution and the H 2 S generator vessel (2) with 10  %wt. Na 2 S solution. The equilibrium cell (9) is a glass-jacketed gas liquid absorber with two double drive impellers. The rotating speeds of the gas phase impeller (10 - 2) and liquid phase impeller (10 - 1) are controlled by its own direct current motor (12 - 1), (12 - 2), respectively. And the speed is displayed on the screen of revolution counter. The absorption temperature is measured by a mercurial thermometer (8) with a sensitivity of 0.1  °C, which is adjusted by the constant temperature circulating water (14), (15) with a water thermostat. The pressure difference was determined by a glass U-tube manometer (18) with the minimum resolution of 0.1  mmHg (0.013  kPa). The absorption pressure equates the pressure difference plus the atmosphere pressure measured by a <b>Fortin</b> <b>Barometer.</b> Liquid sampling is undertaken with a 2  mL injection syringe connected with the liquid sampling valve (11), and analyzed by the methods of weighing and chemical iodine titration. Gas sampling is done quantitatively with a eudiometer (16).|$|E
