He and his collaborators have established conditions for the synchronization of power grids [...] and other complex networks. Together with his former student Z. Nicolaou, he designed a class of mechanical metamaterials that exhibit longitudinal negative compressibility. He has devised local methods for cascade control in distributed systems. <b>His</b> group <b>has</b> <b>studied</b> <b>implications</b> of these methods for the recovery of lost function in biological [...] and ecological [...] networks and for the control of complex networks in general. In other areas he is known for accommodating the formalism of chaos theory within general relativity [...] and, along with his collaborators, for establishing the three degrees of separation for English words.|$|R

30|$|The {{findings}} of the present <b>study</b> <b>have</b> <b>implications</b> for research on OCBs. First, the current study suggests the {{need to continue to}} expand citizenship behavior research beyond personal (personality, affect, etc.) and situational (job characteristics, social settings, etc.) antecedents of OCB. Often, the existing literature has assumed that whether a person performs a citizenship behavior or not is a personal choice (Banki 2010) with little relation to expectations from other members within the organization. The current research shows the value of considering others’ expectations of citizenship behavior.|$|R
