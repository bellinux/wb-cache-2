The {{aim of this}} study is to evaluate the colour quality and compare the accuracy between CCM forecasting and simulated dyeing produced by conventional water-based dyeing and octane-assisted reverse micellar dyeing.

In addition to the written thesis, the research outcomes also include a range of fabric samples and prototype pieces that explore the design potential of thermochromic <b>dye</b> <b>systems</b> on textiles when used in combination with electronic heat-profiling circuitry. A particular ambition of the research was to highlight and exploit the complexity {{of a wide range of}} thermochromic <b>dye</b> <b>systems</b> within the area of textile design. The research was multidisciplinary in nature, bridging design, colour chemistry and power electronics. A number of electronic heating systems, some digitally-controlled, were designed and constructed as a means to activate and control the colour change effects on thermochromic fabrics. Both leuco and liquid crystal types of thermochromic systems were explored. However, a significant focus developed on liquid crystal <b>dye</b> <b>systems</b> which offered particular opportunities in their application to textiles, including the previously unexploited design potential of their ability to change through a spectrum of colours, facilitated further by access to some unique materials made available by the industrial collaboration. The research contributes to knowledge in several ways: • it demonstrates the additive colour mixing properties of liquid crystal <b>dye</b> <b>systems</b> when layered on textiles, which have not previously been exploited in textile design. • the electronic systems that have been developed within the research offer tools for visualising colour-change, controlling, and mixing colour on a textile surface. • the approach through textile design exploited combinations of thermochromic effects with pattern, for example using laser technology, to enhance further the colour changing surfaces. It demonstrates a diverse range of thermochromic effects.

For chrome dyeing, the dyeing rate of LTP-treated wool fibre was increased, but the final dyeing exhaustion equilibrium was increased only to a small extent. In addition, the rate of the afterchroming process was similar to the chrome dyeing process.

40|$|A {{simple and}} {{feasible}} method of computer colour matching involving fluorescent dyes was developed. An ordinary abridged-spectroreflectometer with polychomatic illumination and a simulated D 65 xenon light source was employed for all measurements. In {{addition to the}} normal K/S constants for non-fluorescent dyes and the non-fluorescent portion of the fluorescent dye' [...] constants responsible for the fluorescent portion were necessary. Two sets of equations to relate the total radiance factors of dyeings with a fluorescent dye and its concentration were developed respectively for self and compound shades where a non-fluorescent dye is admixed. Finding constants responsible for the compound shades required a number of calibration mixture dyeings. Negative K/S constants were found useful when the total radiance factor was above that for the substrate but below one hundred. Three computer programs? s were developed to deal with calibration constants for self and compound shade and also for match prediction. Optimization was used in all cases to minimize errors in total radiance factors or colour differences.

The main purpose {{of this research was}} to study the effectiveness of natural adsorbents for the multi <b>dye</b> <b>system</b> removal (synthesis wastewater) by adsorption technique in batch process. The natural adsorbents that had been used were wood ash, papaya seed, coconut husk and clay. The operation parameters investigated included the effect of the pH towards dyes removal performance and optimum dosage of natural adsorbents for multi <b>dye</b> <b>system.</b> Different range of pH that had been used was pH 3 (acidic), pH 7 (neutral) and pH 11 (basic) in different dosage of adsorbents. In this research, the percentage of dye removal for MO showed higher compared than percentage of dye removal for MB. The residual of dye concentration was determined spectrophotometrically by monitoring absorbance changed at maximum wavelength adsorption using UV-Vis spectrophotometer. After analyzed the data, wood ash was found as the effective natural adsorbents in multi <b>dyes</b> <b>system</b> compared with coconut husk, papaya seeds and clay. In pH 3 (acidic), it produced higher percentage of dyes removal. The pH of the solution affects the surface charge of adsorbents as well as the degree of ionization of dyes.

The coefficient of correlation R 2 was high for Freundlich and Langmuir isotherm based on pH of adsorbents. The Freundlich isotherm takes place on heterogeneous surface with a non-uniform distribution of heat adsorption over the surface while the Langmuir model based on monolayer, uniform and finite adsorption site assumptions.

In this study, we present an efficient method for haplotype analysis of PAH locus using multiplexing dyes. In addition, we explain how to resolve the dye shift challenge in multiplex short tandem repeat (STR) genotyping. Materials and Methods One hundred family trios were included in this descriptive study. The forward primer of a tetra-nucleotide STR and the reverse primer of a variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) were labeled with three different non-overlapping dyes 5 -carboxyfluorescein (FAM), 6 -carboxy-N,N,N’,N’-tetramethylrhodamine (HEX) and 6 -carboxy-N,N,N’,N’-tetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA). The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products from each family trio were multiplexed for capillary electrophoresis and results were analyzed using Peak Scanner software. Results Multiplexing trio products decreased the cost significantly. The TAMRA labeled products had a significant predictable shift (migrated at a slower electrophoretic rate) relative to the HEX and FAM labeled products. Through our methodology we achieve, the less inter-dye shift than intra-dye shift variance. Correcting the dye shift in the labeled products, according to the reference allele size, significantly decreased the inter-dye variability (P< 0. 001).
