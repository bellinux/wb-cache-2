Most patients show metastatic or unresectable disease at time of presentation or surgical exploration. In patients eligible for surgical resection, challenges are to achieve negative bile duct margins, adequate liver remnant function, and adequate portal and arterial inflow to the liver remnant. Surgical treatment is characterized by high rates of postoperative morbidity and mortality.

40|$|The {{plant hormone}} auxin {{controls}} root epidermal cell {{development in a}} concentration-dependent manner 1, 2, 3. Root hairs are produced on a subset of epidermal cells as they increase in distance from the root tip. Auxin is required for their initiation 4, 5, 6, 7 and continued growth 8, 9, 10, 11, but {{little is known about}} its distribution in this region of the root. Contrary to the expectation that hair cells might require active auxin influx to ensure auxin supply, we did not detect the auxin-influx transporter AUX 1 in root-hair cells. A high level of AUX 1 expression was detected in adjacent non-hair cell files. Non-hair cells were necessary to achieve wild-type root-hair length, although an auxin response was not required in these cells. Three-dimensional modelling of auxin flow in the root tip suggests that AUX 1 -dependent transport through non-hair cells maintains an auxin supply to developing hair cells as they increase in distance from the root tip, and sustains root-hair outgrowth. Experimental data support the hypothesis that instead of moving uniformly though the epidermal cell layer 3, 12, auxin is mainly transported through canals that <b>extend</b> <b>longitudinally</b> <b>into</b> the tissue...|$|R

40|$|A casing-less down hole {{sampling}} system for acquiring a subsurface sample for analysis using an {{inductively coupled plasma}} system is disclosed. The system includes a probe which is pushed into the formation to be analyzed using a hydraulic ram system. The probe includes a detachable tip member which has a soil point mad a barb, with the soil point aiding the penetration of the earth, and the barb causing the tip member to disengage from the probe and remain in the formation when the probe is pulled up. The probe is forced into the formation to be tested, and then pulled up slightly, to disengage the tip member and expose a column of the subsurface formation to be tested. An instrumentation tube mounted in the probe is then extended outward from the probe to <b>longitudinally</b> <b>extend</b> <b>into</b> the exposed column. A balloon seal mounted {{on the end of}} the instrumentation tube allows the bottom of the column to be sealed. A source of laser radiation is emitted from the instrumentation tube to ablate a sample from the exposed column.
