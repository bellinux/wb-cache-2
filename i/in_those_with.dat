5|$|A {{number of}} {{measures}} {{have not been}} confirmed to affect UTI frequency including: urinating immediately after intercourse, the type of underwear used, personal hygiene methods used after urinating or defecating, or whether a person typically bathes or showers. There is similarly a lack of evidence surrounding the effect of holding one's urine, tampon use, and douching. <b>In</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> frequent urinary tract infections who use spermicide or a diaphragm {{as a method of}} contraception, they are advised to use alternative methods. <b>In</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> benign prostatic hyperplasia urinating in a sitting position appears to improve bladder emptying which might decrease urinary tract infections in this group.|$|E
5|$|About 90% {{of those}} {{infected}} with M. tuberculosis have asymptomatic, latent TB infections (sometimes called LTBI), {{with only a}} 10% lifetime chance that the latent infection will progress to overt, active tuberculous disease. <b>In</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> HIV, {{the risk of developing}} active TB increases to nearly 10% a year. If effective treatment is not given, the death rate for active TB cases is up to 66%.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{negative}} health consequences of obesity {{in the general}} population are well supported by the available evidence, health outcomes in certain subgroups seem to be improved at an increased BMI, a phenomenon known as the obesity survival paradox. The paradox was first described in 1999 in overweight and obese people undergoing hemodialysis, and has subsequently been found <b>in</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> heart failure and peripheral artery disease (PAD).|$|E
5|$|Antidepressants may be {{effective}} for treating chronic pain associated with symptoms of depression, {{but they have}} a risk of side effects. Although the antiseizure drugs gabapentin and carbamazepine are sometimes used for chronic low back pain and may relieve sciatic pain, there is insufficient evidence to support their use. Systemic oral steroids have not been shown to be useful in low back pain. Facet joint injections and steroid injections into the discs have not been found to {{be effective}} <b>in</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> persistent, non-radiating pain; however, they may be considered for those with persistent sciatic pain. Epidural corticosteroid injections provide a slight and questionable short-term improvement <b>in</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> sciatica but are of no long term benefit. There are also concerns of potential side effects.|$|E
5|$|COPD often occurs {{along with}} a number of other {{conditions}}, due in part to shared risk factors. These conditions include ischemic heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, muscle wasting, osteoporosis, lung cancer, anxiety disorder, sexual dysfunction, and depression. <b>In</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> severe disease, a feeling of always being tired is common. Fingernail clubbing is not specific to COPD and should prompt investigations for an underlying lung cancer.|$|E

Triggers may include infection, not taking insulin correctly, stroke, and certain medications such as steroids. DKA results from a shortage of insulin; in response the body switches to burning fatty acids which produces acidic ketone bodies. DKA is typically diagnosed when testing finds high blood sugar, low blood pH, and ketoacids in either the blood or urine.|$|E
5|$|Death from {{pneumothorax}} is very uncommon (except {{in tension}} pneumothoraces). British statistics show an annual mortality rate of 1.26 and 0.62 deaths per million person-years {{in men and}} women, respectively. A significantly increased risk of death is seen in older victims and <b>in</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> secondary pneumothoraces.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{numerous}} studies demonstrating {{the central role}} of ammonia, ammonia levels do not always correlate with the severity of the encephalopathy; it is suspected that this means that more ammonia has already been absorbed into the brain <b>in</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> severe symptoms whose serum levels are relatively low. Other waste products implicated in hepatic encephalopathy include mercaptans (substances containing a thiol group), short-chain fatty acids, and phenol.|$|E

A diagnosis of TB should, however, be considered <b>in</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> signs of lung disease or constitutional symptoms lasting longer than two weeks. A chest X-ray and multiple sputum cultures for acid-fast bacilli are typically part of the initial evaluation. Interferon-γ release assays and tuberculin skin tests are of little use in the developing world. Interferon gamma release assays (IGRA) have similar limitations <b>in</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> HIV.|$|E
5|$|Drugs in the gliflozin class (SGLT2 inhibitors), {{which are}} {{generally}} used for type 2 diabetes, {{have been associated}} with cases of diabetic ketoacidosis where the blood sugars are not significantly elevated ("euglycemic DKA"). This may be because they were being used in people with type 1 diabetes, but <b>in</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> type 2 diabetes it may be {{as a result of an}} increase in glucagon levels.|$|E
