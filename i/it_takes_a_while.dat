25|$|The {{change in}} the MR signal from {{neuronal}} activity is called the hemodynamic response (HDR). It lags the neuronal events triggering it {{by a couple of}} seconds, since <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> for the vascular system to respond to the brain's need for glucose. From this point it typically rises to a peak at about 5seconds after the stimulus. If the neurons keep firing, say from a continuous stimulus, the peak spreads to a flat plateau while the neurons stay active. After activity stops, the BOLD signal falls below the original level, the baseline, a phenomenon called the undershoot. Over time the signal recovers to the baseline. There is some evidence that continuous metabolic requirements in a brain region contribute to the undershoot.|$|E
2500|$|From mid-2001 the band's {{momentum}} {{was reduced}} when a cyst {{was found on}} Ella's vocal cords and she underwent throat surgery late that year. Her voice was slow to recover, which [...] "destroyed any confidence she had in her voice." [...] In November of the following year she said, [...] "I have a rule – no singing before 10am. Nothing comes out, even if I wanted it to. If I'm on at 10am I have to be up by 8.30am, because <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> for my voice to sound human. It's like a croaky 80-year-old lady." [...] The group's official website announced in August 2001 that Wah Wah Music had joined with Sony Music Entertainment Australia for their releases. The band continued to work on its second studio album, Present (October 2002), which peaked at No.12. It was co-produced by Kosky and Robinson with Andy Baldwyn and issued on Wah Wah Music/Sony Music Australia. It was certified gold for shipment of 35,000 units in December.|$|E
2500|$|Stephen Dalton of The Hollywood Reporter {{was more}} {{critical}} of the documentary, calling it [...] "lightweight but warm-hearted" [...] and a [...] "genial love letter to a minor musical cult", but saying that it [...] "starts to lose momentum in its midsection as the turnover of interchangeable band members takes on a slightly Groundhog Day feel. In a break from rockumentary tradition, LaCoeur and Riggle fail to unearth any backstage dirt or drama here." [...] He complained that the portions on Stevenson's relationship {{with his father and}} health issues [...] "are serious episodes, but largely unrelated to the story. Coming so late in an otherwise light-hearted film, this tonal shift feels like a clumsy bid to add grit and gravitas." [...] Finally, he felt that Filmage failed to place the Descendents and All in a wider context, saying [...] "it feels limited in its lack of social or historical context beyond the band’s personal story, with almost zero examination of underground hardcore rock as a reaction against mainstream pop culture in Reagan-era America. Even if Descendents had little personal interest in the politics of punk, {{they were part of a}} wider movement that deserves a more searching film than this." [...] Postmedia News reviewer Jay Stone felt similarly about the segments focusing on Stevenson, remarking that while he [...] "emerges as the key character in Filmage" [...] and forms the film's human interest story, [...] "his personal history, including problems with a distant father and some health issues, is slipped so casually into Filmage that <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> to realize what we’re seeing. Stevenson’s medical miracle is worth a movie of its own, but in the world of punk music documentaries, it’s just a sidebar." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 6 September 2010, Body Talk Pt. 2 was {{released}} in the UK. It was preceded by the lead single, a dance version of [...] "Hang with Me" [...] from Body Talk Pt. 1, on 5 September. The album includes a duet with American rapper Snoop Dogg, [...] "U Should Know Better". Robyn performed [...] "Dancing on My Own" [...] with deadmau5 at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards on 12 September. In a BBC Newsbeat interview, Robyn explained her decision to release three albums in one year: [...] "It was just something I felt like I needed to do. I just never thought about selling records or not, making this decision. I just did it for myself. It's a way of, for me, to stay inspired {{and to be able}} to do the things I like to do". She said that she would not do it again: [...] "When you do 16 or 13 songs in one go, you kind of empty yourself, and <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> to fill back up and have new things to talk about, so I think it's good for everyone". Robyn announced the release of the single, [...] "Indestructible", on 13 October 2010; an acoustic version appeared on Body Talk Pt. 2. The song {{was released}} on 17 November in Scandinavia and 22 November in the UK. Co-written by Klas Åhlund, it was described as a [...] "pulsating full power version [...] takes every ounce of that emotion and wraps it up in another exceptional disco-pop record worthy of any dance-floor or passion-laden sing-a-long." [...] Robyn planned to collaborate with Swedish producer Max Martin on the song, [...] "Time Machine"; Martin produced Robyn's US singles [...] "Do You Know (What It Takes)" [...] and [...] "Show Me Love", both of which peaked in the top 10 on the Billboard 100 in 1997.
