In the documentary Naked & Famous, he explained how photographers want him to frown angrily in photos. <b>He</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> cover of The Big Issue, where he has a milder look on his face, as being more representative of how he feels.

2500|$|Keith, meanwhile, {{as well as}} {{linking the}} Youth to the Narcissus myth, points to the Persephone, (also known as Proserpina) myth, as {{applicable}} to the Virgin character, where the [...] "soul's descent into the material world of generation" [...] leads to a yearning to escape. <b>He</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> connection between Persephone, {{who might have been}} gathering Daffodils (confused with the Asphodel in English tradition), before being taken under the Earth by Pluto. When Persephone was captured, the Daffodils, originally white in colour, turned yellow.|$|E

Barrie ran [...] "Godless" [...] through iThenticate, his company's machine which is able to scan works and compare them to existing texts. <b>He</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> 25 word section of the text that exactly matches a Planned Parenthood pamphlet and a 33 word section almost duplicating a 1999 article from the Portland Press as some examples of evidence.|$|E
2500|$|Musicologist Richard Dumbrill today {{uses the}} word to discuss {{instruments}} that existed millennia before the term [...] "lute" [...] was coined. Dumbrill documented more than 3000 years of iconographic evidence for the lutes in Mesopotamia, in his book The Archaeomusicology of the Ancient Near East. According to Dumbrill, the lute family included instruments in Mesopotamia prior to 3000BC. <b>He</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> cylinder seal as evidence; dating from [...] 3100BC [...] or earlier (now {{in the possession of}} the British Museum) the seal depicts on one side what is thought to be a woman playing a stick [...] "lute". Like Sachs, Dumbrill saw length as distinguishing lutes, dividing the Mesopotamian lutes into a long variety and a short. His book does not cover the shorter instruments that became the European lute, beyond showing examples of shorter lutes in the ancient world. He focuses on the longer lutes of Mesopotamia, [...] various types of necked chordophones that developed throughout ancient world: Greek, Egyptian (in the Middle Kingdom), Iranian (Elamite and others), Hittite, Roman, Bulgar, Turkic, Indian, Chinese, Armenian/Cilician cultures. He names among the long lutes, the pandura and the tanbur ...|$|E
2500|$|Stagg {{addresses}} {{the question of}} why so much of the Christian Household Code is found in what is generally recognized as the Pauline tradition. <b>He</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> seeming irony that the Code in the New Testament is associated with the apostle who fought so openly and suffered such personal sacrifice for both freedom and equity for Jew and Greek, slave and free, male and female. Citing the complexities with which Paul had to deal after his historic proclamation in Galatians 3:28, Stagg concludes that the New Testament Household Code was not a simple situation in which one man [...] "single-handedly imposed male chauvinism on Gentile churches." [...] He suggests that Paul's strong emphases stemmed from the [...] "perennial tension between freedom and order." [...] Pointing out that freedom is ever at the risk of its abuse in terms of permissiveness, disorder, anarchy, or chaos, [...] "the twin threats of legalism and libertinism are ancient and recurrent". Stagg notes that various New Testament books reflect [...] "this ongoing struggle for a proper relationship between law and grace, gift and demand, freedom and responsibility". He conjectures that this situation must have become acute in the early churches, especially among women and slaves who had suffered most under the heaviest restraints. Therefore, they understandably would want {{to make the most of}} their new freedom [...] "in Christ", and Stagg concludes that Paul found himself at the center of the battle.|$|E

2500|$|Old Testament prophets and patriarchs {{are portrayed}} {{on the fourth}} tier of the iconostasis, in {{accordance}} with the traditional Slavic structure. Three of the twelve Biblical figures in the row are hard to identify because they do not hold any emblems, nor do they have their names painted on the icon. However, the placement of the icons is rather strictly regulated, determining whom the three icons can portray. The first painting from the left is one of the three uncertain icons. Most probably it depicts Daniel as a youth. He holds a rock in his hand as described in one of his visions in Daniel 2. He could interpret the dream of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylonia, prophesying the fall of the great empires. In the king's dream, the strong empires, symbolized by a terrifying creature, were smashed by a rock. The next picture portrays Zechariah, the eleventh of the Twelve Minor Prophets, who led his people as a priest. He is depicted in a high priest's vestments holding a seven-branched menorah. Ezekiel's image is the third on the tier. <b>He</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> [...] "closed gate" [...] with his right hand in accordance with one of his prophecies. Christian scholars interpreted this narrative later as the Old Testament reference to the Incarnation, to the birth of Jesus. The gate that can only be opened by God signifies Mary and the prince symbolizes Jesus. The next icon portrays David, the second king of the united Israel. He is depicted with the harp he played to expel the evil spirit possessing King Saul. David is followed by Jacob, holding his ladder. According to the Old Testament Jacob dreamed about a ladder reaching into heaven with angels going up and down it. In Christian theology the ladder can stand for Jesus himself, bridging the gap between Heaven and Earth. The last prophet {{on the left side of}} the tier is Moses. He holds the Tablets of Stone on which the Ten Commandments are inscribed. The painters included two horn-like curls of hair on Moses' head as on Michelangelo's well-known statue.|$|E

6000|$|Before the Duke of York's column, {{and between}} the [...] "Athenaeum" [...] and [...] "United Service" [...] Clubs, I have seen more than once, on the esplanade, a preacher holding forth to a little {{congregation}} of badauds and street-boys, whom he entertains with a discourse on the crimes of a rapacious aristocracy, or warns of the imminent peril of their own souls. Sometimes this orator is made to [...] "move on" [...] by brutal policemen. Sometimes, on a Sunday, <b>he</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> white head or two visible {{in the windows of}} the Clubs to the right and left of him, and volunteers a statement that those quiet and elderly Sabbath-breakers will very soon be called from this world to another, where their lot will by no means be so comfortable as that which the reprobates enjoy here, in their arm-chairs by their snug fires.|$|E

60|$|We were {{received}} with much courtesy and emphasis {{by the director}} of the foundry, and conducted into a large room walled with bare, new brick, where the statue {{was standing in front of}} the extinct furnace: a majestic Webster indeed, eight feet high, and looking even more colossal than that. The likeness seemed to me perfect, and, like a sensible man, Powers' has dressed him in his natural costume, such as I have seen Webster have on while making a speech in the open air at a mass meeting in Concord,--dress-coat buttoned pretty closely across the breast, pantaloons and boots,--everything finished even to a seam and a stitch. Not an inch of the statue but is Webster; even his coat-tails are imbued with the man, and this true artist has succeeded in showing him through the broadcloth as nature showed him. He has felt that a man's actual clothes are as much a part of him as his flesh, and I respect him for disdaining to shirk the difficulty by throwing the meanness of a cloak over it, and for recognizing the folly of masquerading our Yankee statesman in a Roman toga, and the indecorousness of presenting him as a brassy nudity. It would have been quite as unjustifiable to strip him to his skeleton as to his flesh. Webster is represented as holding in his right hand the written roll of the Constitution, with which <b>he</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> bundle of fasces, which he keeps from falling by the grasp of his left, thus symbolizing him as the preserver of the Union. There is an expression of quiet, solid, massive strength in the whole figure; a deep, pervading energy, in which any exaggeration of gesture would lessen and lower the effect. He looks really like a pillar of the state. The face is very grand, very Webster stern and awful, because he is in the act of meeting a great crisis, and yet with the warmth of a great heart glowing through it. Happy is Webster to have been so truly and adequately sculptured; happy the sculptor in such a subject, which no idealization of a demigod could have supplied him with. Perhaps the statue at the bottom of the sea will be cast up in some future age, when the present race of man is forgotten, and if so, that far posterity will look up to us as a grander race than we find ourselves to be. Neither was Webster altogether the man he looked. His physique helped him out, even when he fell somewhat short of its promise; and if his eyes had not been in such deep caverns their fire would not have looked so bright.|$|E
