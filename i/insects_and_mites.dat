5|$|Biological {{pest control}} is a method of {{controlling}} pests such as <b>insects</b> <b>and</b> <b>mites</b> by using other organisms. It relies on predation, parasitism, herbivory or other natural mechanisms, but typically also involves an active human management role. Classical biological control involves the introduction of natural enemies of the pest that are bred in the laboratory and released into the environment. An alternative approach is to augment the natural enemies that occur {{in a particular area}} by releasing more, either in small, repeated batches, or in a single large-scale release. Ideally, the released organism will breed and survive, and provide long-term control. Biological control can be an important component of an integrated pest management programme.|$|E

50|$|The {{most common}} {{management}} practice for grains and legumes {{is the use}} of aeration systems. Air is pushed through the storage bins at low flow rates, which removes excess moisture and heat. Regulation of air flow allows the moisture content in harvested products to remain at a constant level and decreases the temperature within the bins. Temperature levels can decrease enough so <b>insects</b> <b>and</b> <b>mites</b> are dormant, which reduces rapid growth of the pathogen.|$|E

Favoured fruit include those of Vismia trees, figs, and Amazon grape.

The survey revealed 10 species of predatory thrips in 5 genera in the Family Phlaeothripidae. They were: Aleurodothrips fasciapennis (Franklin), Androthrips flavipes Schmutz, Androthrips ramachandrai Karny, Karnyothrips flavipes (Jones), two indeterminate Karnyothrips sp. 1 and sp. 2, Leptothrips sp., Podothrips lucasseni (Krüger), and two indeterminate Podothrips sp. 1, and sp. 2. Eleven species of <b>insect</b> <b>and</b> <b>mite</b> pests serving as prey were found associated with 16 species of host plants in 13 families. They were: scale insects, Coccus viridis (Green) and two Coccus spp.; spiraling whitefly, Aleurodicus dispersus Russell; unidentified gall-making Hemiptera; coffee berry borer, Hypothenemus hampei (Ferrari); unidentified crambid lepidopterous larvae; Kanzawa spider mite, Tetranychus kanzawai Kishida; santol gall mite, Eriophyes sandorici Nelepa; litchi rust mite, Aceria litchii (Keifer); <b>and</b> bamboo green <b>mite,</b> Aponychus corpuzae Rimando.

50|$|Galls or cecidia are {{a kind of}} {{swelling}} {{growth on}} the external tissues of plants or animals. Plant galls are abnormal outgrowths of plant tissues, similar to benign tumors or warts in animals. They can be caused by various parasites, from fungi and bacteria, to <b>insects</b> <b>and</b> <b>mites.</b> Plant galls are often highly organized structures and because of this the cause of the gall can often be determined without the actual agent being identified. This applies particularly to some insect and mite plant galls. The study of plant galls is known as cecidology.|$|E
50|$|To ensure {{grains and}} legumes remain free of A. flavus infection, certain {{conditions}} must be incorporated before, during, and after harvest. Moisture levels {{should be kept}} below 11.5%. Temperature in storage units should be kept {{as low as possible}} since the pathogen is unable to grow below 5 °C. The low temperature facilitates slower respiration and prevents moisture increase. Fumigants are used to decrease the occurrence and persistence of <b>insects</b> <b>and</b> <b>mites,</b> which aids the rapid growth of the pathogen. Sanitary practices including, removing old and unripe seeds, exclusion of damaged and broken seeds, and overall cleanliness assist in minimizing the colonization and spread of the pathogen.|$|E
50|$|Contamination by moulds {{is mainly}} {{determined}} by {{the temperature of the}} grain and the availability of water and oxygen. Moulds can grow over a wide range of temperatures, but the rate of growth is lower with lower temperature and less water availability. The interaction between moisture and temperature is important. Maize, for example, can be stored for one year at a moisture level of 15% and a temperature of 15 °C. However, the same maize stored at 30 °C will be substantially damaged by moulds within three months. <b>Insects</b> <b>and</b> <b>mites</b> (arthropods) can, of course, make a significant contribution towards the deterioration of grain, through the physical damage and nutrient losses caused by their activity.|$|E

50|$|They {{can also}} {{influence}} mould colonisation as carriers of mould spores and because their faecal material can be utilised {{as a food}} source by moulds. In general, grain is not infested by insects below 17 °C whereas mite infestations can occur between 3 and 30 °C and above 12% moisture content. The metabolic activity of <b>insects</b> <b>and</b> <b>mites</b> causes an increase in both the moisture content and temperature of infested grain. Another important factor that can affect mould growth is the proportion of broken kernels. There are about 1,700 species of rodents in the world, {{but only a few}} species contribute significantly to post-harvest losses. Three species are found throughout the world: the house mouse (Mus musculus), the black rat (Rattus rattus) and the brown rat while a few other species are important in Africa and Asia.|$|E
5000|$|Physogastrism is a {{characteristic}} of certain arthropods (mostly <b>insects</b> <b>and</b> <b>mites),</b> where the abdomen is greatly enlarged and membranous. The most common examples are the [...] "queens" [...] of certain species of eusocial insects such as termites, bees and ants, in which the abdomen swells in order to hold enlarged ovaries, thus increasing fecundity. This means that the queen {{has the ability to}} hold more and produce more eggs at one time. Physogastric queens produce an enormous number of eggs which can account for a significant amount of their body weight. In the termite species Macrotermes subhyalinus, eggs can make up a third of their body weight, and a 15-gram queen can produce up to 30 eggs per minute. The physogastric queens' egg production is supported by oocyte proteins supplied by the [...] "queen body fat." ...|$|E
50|$|Hundreds of {{millions}} of tonnes of wheat, corn, soybean, rice and other grains as sorghum, sunflower seeds, rapeseed/canola, barley, oats, etc., are dried in grain dryers. In the main agricultural countries, drying comprises the reduction of moisture from about 17-30%w/w to values between 8 and 15%w/w, depending on the grain. The final moisture content for drying must be adequate for storage. The more oil the grain has, the lower its storage moisture content will be (though its initial moisture for drying will also be lower). Cereals are often dried to 14% w/w, while oilseeds, to 12.5% (soybeans), 8% (sunflower) and 9% (peanuts). Drying is carried out as a requisite for safe storage, in order to inhibit microbial growth. However, low temperatures in storage are also highly recommended to avoid degradative reactions and, especially, the growth of <b>insects</b> <b>and</b> <b>mites.</b> A good maximum storage temperature is about 18 °C.|$|E
30|$|The {{spread of}} {{insecticide}} strains of stored-product pests and environmental problems connected with chemical control, like {{the effect of}} methyl bromide on the ozone layer, has led to intensify the researches for alternative control methods such as biological control (Rees 2003).
