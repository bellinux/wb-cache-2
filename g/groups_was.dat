5|$|A unique {{bond between}} two very {{disparate}} <b>groups</b> <b>was</b> {{formed as a}} result of the hurricane. Two groups, the Bastrop Christian Outreach Center (BCOC) and attendees of the counter-culture Rainbow Gathering, arrived around the same time in Waveland.|$|E
5|$|After the Camp returned, Smith drew {{heavily from}} its {{participants}} to establish five governing {{bodies in the}} church, all originally of equal authority to check one another. Among these five <b>groups</b> <b>was</b> a quorum of twelve apostles. Smith gave a revelation saying that to redeem Zion, his followers would have to receive an endowment in the Kirtland Temple, and in March 1836, at the temple's dedication, many participants in the promised endowment saw visions of angels, spoke in tongues, and prophesied.|$|E
5|$|Division I {{is split}} into two groups of six, both groups play in round robin tournaments {{independent}} {{of each other and}} the championship division. Previously the top team from both <b>groups</b> <b>was</b> promoted to the championship, while the bottom team was relegated to Division II. Beginning in 2012, the top two teams from the 'A' group will be promoted to the championship, the bottom team will be exchanged with the group 'B' winner, and that group's last place team will go down to Division II.|$|E

5|$|In November 2014, {{rap group}} Migos and Glo Gang member, Capo, were {{involved}} in a physical altercation in a Chicago restaurant. Later, Keef uploaded an image onto Instagram featuring the alleged stolen chain belonging to rapper Quavo of Migos. Though this incident escalated the already existing tension between members of Glo Gang and members of Migos, the feud between the two <b>groups</b> <b>was</b> later seemingly ended.|$|E
5|$|Kefalas {{proposed}} {{a bill to}} explore alternative voting systems, which was defeated in committee, but {{which led to the}} creation of an 11-member multi-partisan task force to study related issues. Another of Kefalas' proposed bills, which would have required the Colorado Department of Revenue to regularly report on tax burdens across individual income <b>groups,</b> <b>was</b> also defeated in committee.|$|E
5|$|The {{legislation}} {{in its original}} form {{was sponsored by the}} Democratic Party, but after it ran into opposition, it was rescued by the conservative Republican Senator Barry Goldwater. Under Goldwater's sponsorship, a version of the legislation without the commitment provisions that were the target of intense opposition from a variety of far-right, anti-Communist and fringe religious <b>groups</b> <b>was</b> passed by the United States Senate. The controversy still plays a prominent role in the Church of Scientology's account of its campaign against psychiatry.|$|E

5|$|Two small {{detachments}} of infantry {{of about}} 40 men each were ordered ahead of main columns. They set roadblocks {{ahead of the}} main army, and were to take prisoner whoever came into or left the town.

5|$|Due to the fog, {{visibility}} {{was low and}} the {{two main}} forces failed to notice Oxford's victory over Hastings. As such, {{the collapse of the}} Yorkist left wing had little (if any) effect on morale of either side. The fighting between Montagu's and Edward's <b>groups</b> <b>was</b> evenly matched and intense. The Lancastrian left wing, however, was suffering treatment similar to that Oxford had inflicted on its counterpart; Gloucester exploited the misaligned forces and beat Exeter back. Progress for Edward's brother was slow because his group was fighting up a slight slope. Nonetheless, the pressure he exerted on the Lancastrian left wing rotated the entire battle line. Warwick, seeing the shift, ordered most of his reserves to help ease the pressure on Exeter, and took the rest into fighting at the centre. Gradually, the battle line settled to an orientation that slanted north-east to south-west.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{surrender}} of Oribe, the Allied forces split into two groups, the plan being for one force to maneuver upriver and sweep down on Buenos Aires from Santa Fe, while the other would make a landing {{at the port of}} Buenos Aires itself. The first of these <b>groups,</b> <b>was</b> composed of Uruguayan and Argentine troops, along with the 1st Division of the Brazilian Army under Brigadier General Manuel Marques de Sousa (later the Count of Porto Alegre). It was initially based in the town of Colonia del Sacramento in the south of Uruguay across the Río de la Plata estuary from the city of Buenos Aires.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A <b>group</b> <b>is</b> called linear {{if it has}} a {{faithful}} linear (com-plex) representation. Another way of expressing this property <b>is</b> that the <b>group</b> <b>is</b> isomorphic to a group of invertible complex ma-trices. Not all <b>groups</b> <b>are</b> linear.

5|$|The LM {{sought to}} {{seize control of}} the LCL agenda by winning key {{positions}} on the state executive at the annual general meeting in September, but this was difficult as the malapportionment towards rural <b>groups</b> <b>was</b> entrenched at party level, and because the conservatives had anticipated the LM's plans. The LM President Alex Perryman challenged McLachlan for the party presidency and in a high-profile contest received 47% {{of the vote in}} a narrow defeat. He received around 90% among urban delegates and around 33% of the rural votes, the latter figure shocking the conservatives. The LM later generated more publicity by inquiring about alleged impropriety in the balloting process.|$|E
5|$|The World Cup {{was first}} {{televised}} in 1954 {{and is now}} the most widely viewed and followed sporting event in the world. The cumulative audience of all matches of the 2006 World Cup is estimated to be 26.29 billion. 715.1 million individuals watched the final match of this tournament (a ninth of the entire population of the planet). The 2006 World Cup draw, which decided the distribution of teams into <b>groups,</b> <b>was</b> watched by 300 million viewers. The World Cup attracts many sponsors such as Coca-Cola, McDonald's and Adidas. For these companies and many more, being a sponsor strongly impacts their global brands. Host countries typically experience a multimillion-dollar revenue increase from the month-long event. It was predicted that Brazil will bring in more than $11 billion in revenue for the 2014 World Cup.|$|E
5|$|The {{clash between}} the Croatian {{forces and the}} JNA in Kijevo {{was one of the}} first {{instances}} where the JNA openly sided with the insurgent Serbs in the rapidly escalating Croatian War of Independence, acting based on Martić's ultimatum. The defending force suffered only two wounded, but one of the retreating <b>groups</b> <b>was</b> captured. The group, consisting of 20 men, were later released in a prisoner of war exchange. The JNA suffered no casualties. After the JNA secured Kijevo, the village was looted and torched. The destruction of Kijevo became one of the most notorious Serb crimes in the early stages of the war. The JNA units which took part in the fighting in and around Kijevo advanced towards Sinj in the following few days, capturing Vrlika before being redeployed to take part in the Battle of Šibenik in mid-September.|$|E

5|$|The {{sound of}} Japanese bands Earthshaker, Loudness, Anthem and other minor <b>groups</b> <b>was</b> also {{influenced}} by the NWOBHM, whose British sound engineers were used for their early albums. The Japanese band Bow Wow even transferred to England {{to be part of}} the British metal scene. Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Belgium, Netherlands, France and Spain promptly welcomed the new British bands and spawned imitators almost immediately. Acts like Accept, Grave Digger, Sinner and Warlock from Germany, E.F. Band from Sweden, Mercyful Fate from Denmark, Killer and Ostrogoth from Belgium, Picture and Bodine from the Netherlands, Trust and Nightmare from France, and Barón Rojo and Ángeles del Infierno from Spain, formed between 1978 and 1982 and were heavily influenced by the sound of the NWOBHM. Many of these bands signed with the Dutch Roadrunner Records or with the Belgian Mausoleum Records, independent labels that also published recordings of British NWOBHM acts.|$|E
5|$|Tourism {{has grown}} in Dorset since the late 18th century {{and is now the}} {{predominant}} industry. It is estimated that 37,500 people work in Dorset's tourism sector. Some 3.2million British and 326,000 foreign tourists visited the county in 2008, staying a total of 15.1 million nights. In addition there were 14.6million day visitors. The combined spending of both <b>groups</b> <b>was</b> £1,458million. Towns received 56% of Dorset's day trippers, 27% went to the coast and 17% to the countryside. A survey carried out in 1997 concluded that the primary reason tourists were drawn to Dorset was the attractiveness of the county's coast and countryside. Numbers of domestic and foreign tourists have fluctuated in recent years due to various factors including security and economic downturn, a trend reflected throughout the UK.|$|E
5|$|Within {{some of the}} {{destroyed}} suburbs, {{a limited}} postal system between various Robinson <b>groups</b> <b>was</b> established. Dawid Landau {{had served as a}} bodyguard to the courier of the Polish government in exile, Jan Karski, while Karski secretly entered the ghetto to gather information for a report on the extermination of Polish Jews by Nazi Germany for the Western allies, in 1943. Later, Landau fought in both of the Warsaw uprising as part of Żydowski Związek Wojskowy (Jewish Military Union, ŻZW) and afterward decided to stay in the ruins. In his memoirs he reports that the post functioned through the use of empty electrical socket boxes. Various groups would leave notes for others informing them of who was alive and in hiding, news from the front that had been obtained, as well as requests for special forms of assistance. According to Landau, the most common pleas were for doctors or other forms of medical help.|$|E
