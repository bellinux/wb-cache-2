5|$|After {{creating}} custom plugins for the 3D {{computer graphics}} software, Burrows {{claimed that the}} team could create and test entire race tracks within five minutes. The custom plugin used for creating tracks consisted of a 450 kilobyte file, which contained polygon subdividing and data on artificial intelligence, effectively cutting down the time to create tracks from six hours to five minutes. In order to the play the game as soon as possible, the team developed the user interface in the XML markup language, which allowed revisions {{to be made for}} the content at any time. However, Burrows recalled that the only <b>downside</b> <b>to</b> converting everything to XML was that the game was always in danger of becoming too large for the PlayStation Portable's Universal Media Disc. The game's cover art was designed by Popgun, who also designed the logos for games released by EA Sports.|$|E
5|$|The <b>downside</b> <b>to</b> the CSBS {{was that}} the settings, made through four main input dials, were useful for one {{operational}} setup, a given altitude and heading. If the aircraft manoeuvred, the entire system had to be reset. Additionally, the system required the bomber's direction to be compared to objects on the ground, requiring a time-consuming process sighting through thin metal wires against a suitable object on the ground below. As the sight was not stabilized, any manoeuvres to correct for misalignment interfered {{with the ability to}} measure the heading, so these corrections further extended the bomb run. The CSBS generally required the bomber to fly straight and level for a lengthy time.|$|E
25|$|The city's {{job market}} scored only 6 points {{out of a}} {{possible}} 100 in the Cities Ranked and Rated guide, as the <b>downside</b> <b>to</b> the low cost of living is an extremely weak local job market that is oversupplied with college-educated residents. The median income in Gainesville is slightly below the U.S. average.|$|E
50|$|The <b>downsides</b> <b>to</b> this {{approach}} include the delay of {{results from the}} inoculation and the inability to identify the type of carbapenemase.|$|R
50|$|<b>Downsides</b> <b>to</b> cost {{segregation}} studies include cost, the triggering of depreciation recapture and understatement {{penalties for}} taxpayers that use cost segregation too aggressively.|$|R
50|$|Pat DiNizio {{said that}} the music was based on Louie Louie by The Kingsmen. The song was written about the <b>downsides</b> <b>to</b> success.|$|R
25|$|The <b>downside</b> <b>to</b> this {{approach}} is that high-power transmissions are failure-prone devices, especially in the World War II era. They are also complex and time consuming devices to build and repair. Although it eliminates a second engine, compared to the dual-drive concept, it is still relatively complex compared to the solutions that follow.|$|E
25|$|The D'Amico {{classification}} stratifies men by low, intermediate, or {{high risk}} based on stage, grade, and PSA. It is used widely in clinical practice and research settings. The major <b>downside</b> <b>to</b> the 3-level {{system is that}} it does not account for multiple adverse parameters (e.g., high Gleason score and high PSA) in stratifying patients.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, Downside was {{the setting}} for a {{television}} show A Second Chance, in which a teenager from London, Ryan Bell, was sent to <b>Downside</b> <b>to</b> see if a 'difficult' student would do better in the independent sector. After excelling at Latin, biology, and on the rugby field, Bell was eventually expelled after being caught drinking.|$|E
25|$|The <b>downsides</b> <b>to</b> these {{fireplaces}} is {{that their}} heat output is slightly less than electric heat or gas fires, and precautions {{must be taken to}} avoid carbon monoxide poisoning.|$|R
50|$|Gunstar Heroes {{was awarded}} Best Action Game of 1993 by Electronic Gaming Monthly. MegaTech {{magazine}} praised the animation {{and speed of}} gameplay, and {{could not think of}} any <b>downsides</b> <b>to</b> the game.|$|R
5000|$|One of the <b>downsides</b> <b>to</b> any [...] {{operated}} pistol is {{that when}} the carbon dioxide cylinder gets cold due to pressure loss as a result of rapid fire, the pistols velocity will drop.|$|R
25|$|While playing winter ball in Puerto Rico, {{his wife}} {{gave birth to}} Randy on November 18, 1954. With the team owner's approval, he flew home on Christmas day to see his new son at his own expense. The <b>downside</b> <b>to</b> all this was after paying to fly back and playing just one game, his team {{released}} him despite having the 3rd highest batting average in the league.|$|E
25|$|The biggest <b>downside</b> <b>to</b> the 200B was {{the noise}} the driver {{would have to}} endure. The 2-litre {{overhead}} cam engine could be very loud when pushed up through the rev range, and {{to make matters worse}} there was always plenty of drive line vibration. These issues prompted an exhaustive correction programme to be undertaken by the parent company in Japan, and thankfully later models were somewhat improved.|$|E
25|$|Standard {{fluorescent}} tubes are the common light bars {{you find in}} commercial ceilings. Fluorescent lighting has more color temperatures available which are more suited to aquariums than those of incandescent bulbs. They are also more efficient than incandescent lighting, averaging between 90 and 95 lumens per watt. The <b>downside</b> <b>to</b> regular fluorescent lights {{is that they do}} not have the intensity to penetrate into deeper aquariums.|$|E
5000|$|While {{trying to}} weed out the [...] "easy" [...] inventions, the {{non-obviousness}} requirement brings in several <b>downsides</b> <b>to</b> the overall patent system, particularly in the pharmaceutical field, which depends on patent protection most heavily. For example, ...|$|R
50|$|Reviews of the ZTE Blade {{have been}} {{positive}} {{due to the}} amount of features offered while maintaining a low price. The screen in particular received praise, while the camera/camcorder quality was identified {{as one of the few}} <b>downsides</b> <b>to</b> the device.|$|R
5000|$|In August 2011, Allan Jenkins {{reviewed}} the pub for The Guardian. He found {{some of the}} food stunning, and described a blueberry souffl√© as having [...] "an otherworldly intensity of colour and taste." [...] The <b>downsides</b> <b>to</b> his visit were the overly boisterous antics of another table of diners, and that his steak was overcooked.|$|R
25|$|Most {{countries}} have breed descriptions that {{say that the}} Irish Terrier should not be more than 48cm measured at the withers. However, {{it is not unusual}} to see females that are 50cm tall or dogs that are even 53cm (20in). Younger generations are closer to the ideal, but there is a <b>downside</b> <b>to</b> this: when an Irish Terrier is very small and light-boned, it loses the correct racy type.|$|E
25|$|His renewed {{dedication}} to cricket saw him excel in the 2007-8 season. In the Pura Cup, he played 7 games and scored 289 runs {{at an average}} of 36.12, with a high score of 63. He also took 18 wickets at 47.11. The only <b>downside</b> <b>to</b> his season was that he did not break into the one-day side, with incumbent Xavier Doherty being Tasmania's sole spin bowler in the one-day arena. He played only one game, and was named 12th man in Tasmania's competition victory against Victoria.|$|E
25|$|A {{big plus}} {{for the site}} {{selection}} for the Exposition organizers was favorable access by water. A naval review {{was to be a}} major feature of the Exposition. Of course, one <b>downside</b> <b>to</b> the location was that the rural and sparely populated location was hard to reach by land. However, the new railroad was soon to be laying tracks nearby and could be relied upon to help transport the millions of attendees anticipated on land adjacent to the site where work had already begun on the new coal pier.|$|E
5000|$|Ethanol is {{also used}} to fuel {{bioethanol}} fireplaces. As they do not require a chimney and are [...] "flueless", bioethanol fires are extremely useful for newly built homes and apartments without a flue.The <b>downsides</b> <b>to</b> these fireplaces is that their heat output is slightly less than electric heat or gas fires, and precautions must be taken to avoid carbon monoxide poisoning.|$|R
5000|$|Full VGA (640x480 resolution) graphics, {{as opposed}} to the [...] "QVGA (320x240) emulation/compatibility mode" [...] which the Universal runs in by default. The two main <b>downsides</b> <b>to</b> this are that some {{software}} cannot handle [...] "true VGA" [...] mode, which usually results in corrupted graphics, and that it can be quite difficult to see (and use a stylus with) such small screen elements like text.|$|R
5000|$|Sequential rearing: Multiple {{age groups}} of fish share a rearing tank, and when an age group reaches market size they are {{selectively}} harvested {{and replaced with}} {{the same amount of}} fingerlings. [...] <b>Downsides</b> <b>to</b> this method include stressing out the entire pool of fish during each harvest, missing fish resulting in a waste of food/space, and the difficulty of keeping accurate records with frequent harvests.|$|R
25|$|The American manual {{approach}} to docking allows greater initial flexibility and less complexity. The <b>downside</b> <b>to</b> {{this mode of}} operation is that each mission becomes unique and requires specialised training and planning, making the process more labour-intensive and expensive. The Russians pursued an automated methodology that used the crew in override or monitoring roles. Although the initial development costs were high, the system has become very reliable with standardisations that provide significant cost benefits in repetitive routine operations. An automated approach could allow assembly of modules orbiting other worlds prior to crew arrival.|$|E
25|$|One <b>downside</b> <b>to</b> the panel-rib {{construction}} was not noticed until the aircraft {{had been in}} service for some time. Because the panels were glued together, they formed a liquid-tight bond, unlike conventional systems using rivets. Instead of using a separate tank to hold fuel, builders simply drilled holes in the ribs to interconnect the sections to form a tank. In service, {{it was found that}} leaks inevitably developed due to problems like improper seals and natural flexing of the wing. BedeCorp later redesigned the wing to use a more conventional system with separate fuel tanks in the BD-4C.|$|E
25|$|As a pilot project, the Trillium Line {{system was}} {{built at the}} cost of $21 million, {{relatively}} little compared with {{the hundreds of millions of}} dollars usually required to build a new transit line. It runs on an existing Canadian Pacific Railway track (Ellwood and Prescott subdivisions,) so the only construction work necessary was to build the stations themselves and the passing tracks necessary to allow trains to operate in both directions. The <b>downside</b> <b>to</b> this, however, is that much ground pollution remains from the track‚Äôs previous use. This will become a liability one day when the city has to pay to clean it up, which it has thus far avoided by not digging into the ground under the tracks.|$|E
5000|$|Uglies is a 2005 {{science fiction}} novel by Scott Westerfeld. It {{is set in}} a future post {{scarcity}} dystopian world in which everyone is turned [...] "Pretty" [...] by extreme cosmetic surgery upon reaching age 16. It tells the story of teenager Tally Youngblood who rebels against society's enforced conformity, after her newfound friends Shay and David show her the <b>downsides</b> <b>to</b> becoming a [...] "Pretty".|$|R
25|$|A {{very common}} method for {{connection}} is the Internet. Game servers are often separated by region, but high quality connections allow players {{to set up}} real-time connections across the world. <b>Downsides</b> <b>to</b> online connections include increased difficulty detecting cheating compared to physical events, and greater network latency, which can negatively impact players' performance, especially at high levels of competition. Many competitions take place online, especially for smaller tournaments and exhibition games.|$|R
50|$|In 2012 Brick {{published}} {{an article on the}} Daily Mail website titled There are <b>Downsides</b> <b>to</b> Looking This Pretty: Why Women Hate Me for Being Beautiful The perception of her arrogance caused the article to go viral on social media websites and Brick trended globally on Twitter. The article got 1.5 million hits on the newspapers website and nearly 5,000 readers left comments, many of which were negative.|$|R
25|$|The {{hot wire}} method for the {{production}} of KrF2 uses krypton in a solid state with a hot wire running a few centimeters away from it as fluorine gas is then run past the wire. The wire has a large current, causing it to reach temperatures around 680¬∞C. This causes the fluorine gas to split into its radicals, which then can react with the solid krypton. Under ideal conditions, it has been known to reach a maximum yield of 6g/h. In order to achieve optimal yields the gap between the wire and the solid krypton should be 1cm, giving rise to a temperature gradient of about 900¬∞C/cm. A major <b>downside</b> <b>to</b> this method is the amount of electricity that has to be passed through the wire. It is dangerous if not properly set up.|$|E
25|$|The game's {{environment}} {{takes up}} 60‚Äì65% of the CPU bandwidth, {{primarily because of}} the moving camera, but also because eight different characters can appear on screen at any one time ‚Äì a large number for the technology of the time. Because of this, a powerful CPU was required to run the game, since the engine relied on the processor doing all the work in creating the 3D models. However, despite this limitation, the game runs at a minimum of 15 FPS, even on slow systems. The <b>downside</b> <b>to</b> this was that, since processor power at that time was limited, the in-game 3D models tended to look very pixelated, especially up-close and when motionless, due to the low amount of voxels used to display them. However, had the number of voxels been raised to increase the detail on the characters, the game would have become too slow to play, even on advanced CPUs.|$|E
25|$|In July 1938 {{the shadow}} mask color {{television}} was patented by Werner Flechsig (1900‚Äì1981) in Germany, and was demonstrated at the International radio exhibition Berlin in 1939. Most CRT color televisions used today {{are based on}} this technology. His {{solution to the problem}} of focusing the electron guns on the tiny colored dots was one of brute-force; a metal sheet with holes punched in it allowed the beams to reach the screen only when they were properly aligned over the dots. Three separate guns were aimed at the holes from slightly different angles, and when their beams passed through the holes the angles caused them to separate again and hit the individual spots a short distance away on the back of the screen. The <b>downside</b> <b>to</b> this approach was that the mask cut off the vast majority of the beam energy, allowing it to hit the screen only 15% of the time, requiring a massive increase in beam power to produce acceptable image brightness.|$|E
5000|$|Bill Ratner reprises {{his role}} of Flint in the Family Guy episode [...] "North by North Quahog." [...] Flint {{appears in a}} parody of the [...] "Knowing is half the battle" [...] public service {{announcements}} that were common {{after the end of}} many G.I. Joe episodes. He appears out of a bathroom stall in Chris Griffin's school to talk about the <b>downsides</b> <b>to</b> abusing alcohol. He was never mentioned by name.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a new measure of {{vulnerability}} called vulnerability <b>to</b> <b>downside</b> risk. The relevant benchmark for this new measure is the current level of wellbeing of a household as opposed to another benchmark such as the poverty line. We argue that this measure adds complementary information to existing measures such as Calvo and Dercon 9 ÃÜ 2 s (2007) axiomatic measure of vulnerability to poverty. We apply a measure of both vulnerability <b>to</b> <b>downside</b> risk and <b>to</b> poverty to data from Vietnam. We show that consumption smoothing capacities and the probability to experience an adverse event differ substantially between different wealth groups. Consequently, the relation between initial wealth and vulnerability <b>to</b> <b>downside</b> risk is highly non-linear. While moderately but not extremely poor households are relatively vulnerable to extreme poverty, they are less vulnerable <b>to</b> <b>downside</b> risk than any other group of households...|$|R
