5|$|In {{the early}} first {{millennium}} BC, Babylonian astronomers {{observed that the}} Sun's motion along the ecliptic is not uniform, though {{they did not know}} why; it is today known that {{this is due to the}} movement of Earth in an elliptic orbit around the Sun, with <b>Earth</b> <b>moving</b> faster when it is nearer to the Sun at perihelion and moving slower when it is farther away at aphelion.|$|E
5|$|Crusader (AV2767) was an Australian Army amphibious {{operations}} support ship of World War II. She was launched {{shortly before the}} war ended and entered service in late 1945. From 1945 to 1947 she was mainly used to return Australian Army equipment from the islands off New Guinea. She was also loaned to the Australian Shipping Board in early 1947 and transported <b>earth</b> <b>moving</b> equipment and timber between Melbourne and Tasmania. However, the Army did not need a ship with Crusaders capabilities after the war, and she was sold in 1947 to the Queensland Cement and Lime Company which operated her as a coral barge on the Brisbane River until the mid-1980s. The ship was scuttled in 1986 and subsequently became a popular dive wreck.|$|E
5|$|By January 1947 the Army {{no longer}} needed a ship with Crusaders capabilities, and she was loaned to the Australian Shipping Board. In February that year she transported a load of <b>earth</b> <b>moving</b> {{equipment}} from Melbourne to Launceston, and carried a cargo of timber back to Melbourne. She continued to be manned by an Army crew and made several further trips between Tasmania and the mainland, but in April 1947 {{it was reported that}} the ship was to be scrapped on the grounds that she was considered unseaworthy. Gil Duthie, the Federal member for Wilmot, sought to have Crusader retained in service until the shortage of shipping capable of transporting heavy loads to and from Tasmania was rectified. The Shipping Control Board rejected Duthrie's representations on the grounds that Crusader would need extensive alterations before she could be permanently used for commercial trade, and it would take at least a year to complete the necessary works. However, the Board gave a commitment to make other ships available to transport timber from Tasmania. Crusader was subsequently offered for sale, and was purchased by the Queensland Cement and Lime Company (QCL). She arrived at Brisbane on 28 September 1947 and was subsequently renamed Cementco.|$|E

25|$|In {{the case}} of annual {{aberration}} of starlight, the direction of incoming starlight {{as seen in the}} <b>Earth's</b> <b>moving</b> frame is tilted relative to the angle observed in the Sun's frame.

25|$|As {{a result}} of the {{magnitude}} 8.0 earthquake in Sichuan province of China on 12 May 2008, many rivers became blocked by landslides, resulting in the formation of so-called quake lakes: large amounts of water pooling up behind the landslide-formed dams. These dams eventually broke {{under the weight of the}} water, endangering those downstream. At least one Mi-26 belonging to a branch of China's civil aviation service was used to bring heavy <b>earth</b> <b>moving</b> tractors to the quake-lakes at Tangjiashan mountain, located in difficult terrain and accessible only by foot or air.|$|E
25|$|The closest open {{clusters}} {{can have}} their distance measured directly by one of two methods. First, the parallax (the small change in apparent position {{over the course of}} a year caused by the <b>Earth</b> <b>moving</b> from one side of its orbit around the Sun to the other) of stars in close open clusters can be measured, like other individual stars. Clusters such as the Pleiades, Hyades and a few others within about 500light years are close enough for this method to be viable, and results from the Hipparcos position-measuring satellite yielded accurate distances for several clusters.|$|E

25|$|Most {{governmental}} EPAs, {{including the}} United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) mandate that facilities that generate dust, minimize or mitigate {{the production of}} dust in their operation. The most frequent dust control violations occur at new residential housing developments in urban areas. United States Federal law requires that construction sites obtain permits to conduct <b>earth</b> <b>moving,</b> clearing of areas, to include plans to control dust emissions when the work is being carried out. Control measures include such simple practices as spraying construction and demolition sites with water, and preventing the tracking of dust onto adjacent roads.|$|E
25|$|The {{rescue effort}} was {{hampered}} by the weather, terrain, and other problems. Emergency vehicles could not approach due to a fuel pipeline destroyed by the crash and blocking the narrow road. United States Navy Seabees of NMCB133 {{were some of the}} first on the scene as they utilized their <b>earth</b> <b>moving</b> equipment to clear roadways and timber from the crash site approach. The Seabees used backhoes to crack open the still-burning plane to rescue survivors and erected mortuary tents for first responders. There was confusion over the administration of the effort; the crash occurred on land owned by the United States Navy but civil authorities initially claimed authority. The hull had disintegrated, and jet fuel in the wing tanks had sparked a fire which was still burning eight hours after impact.|$|E
25|$|At 14:00 on July 14, Obrenović was at Snagovo when Major Zoran Jovanović {{brought in}} a {{reinforcement}} company, along with the information that Colonel Ljubiša Beara, officer {{in charge of the}} VRS security service, had transported an abnormally large number of prisoners in buses to Zvornik. That same day Obrenović overheard a call for two engineers to be released from battle lines to build a road; suspicious of someone doing the engineers a favor, Obrenović checked on the message and was told that the engineers were needed in Zvornik because of a task being carried out by Beara, Popović, and Nikolić. Obrenović knew that this must involve mass burials; he released the two engineers and ordered his aides to refrain from discussing the issue. Throughout the next days, Obrenović {{spent most of his time}} trying to find a solution for the column problem, but he also released further military police and infantry personnel from battle lines to assist with the execution of prisoners, and supplied <b>earth</b> <b>moving</b> machinery from his engineering battalions to dig mass graves.|$|E

500|$|Regarding {{physics in}} the world of Dust, Chahi commented that the {{developers}} had: [...] "worked hard to translate a vision {{of the power of the}} <b>Earth</b> <b>moving</b> and exploding in the game". Volcanic eruptions, explosions, and lava flows, function in a way similar to actual volcanoes, such as Mount Etna. However, the developers opted for more theatrical, [...] "visually impressive" [...] tsunamis. Dynamic textures were used to represent water transparency, moving lava, and the real time adaptation of rock and soil to fluids.|$|E

30|$|For the OSEE {{experiments}} {{a surface}} quality monitor SQM 300 (Photo Emission Tech., Inc. (PET), USA) was used.

The device contains a solid state electrometer capable of measuring emitted photoelectrons from the tested samples. Those photoelectrons flow through a collector (adjusted at + 40  V), generating a current and its intensity is denoted as the OSEE intensity. The device features an <b>earthed</b> <b>moving</b> table on which the samples are scanned in orthogonal directions within a few millimeters distance to the UV lamp.

50|$|Geologists usually {{associate}} {{volcanic eruptions}} with {{the boundaries between}} colliding or diverging plates. However, the focus of volcanism at Yellowstone in the Columbia Plateau Province is far inland from the subduction zone that lies along the Oregon and Washington coast.
