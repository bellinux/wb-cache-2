5|$|Adult {{males are}} less ready to pursue and less <b>efficient</b> <b>at</b> {{catching}} than adult females, especially against larger prey. Males are quite effective against small web spiders, and reluctant to tackle large ones although they catch them in about 50% of attempts. Against other jumping spiders, males do not pursue large ones and pursue about 48% of small ones, catching 84% of those they pursue. Males of Portia do not build large webs for catching prey ("capture webs").|$|E
5|$|All cells, {{and many}} viruses, produce {{proteins}} that are enzymes called DNA polymerase and RNA polymerase which make new copies of DNA and RNA. A virus's polymerase enzymes are often much more <b>efficient</b> <b>at</b> making DNA and RNA than the host cell's. However, RNA polymerase enzymes often make mistakes, {{and this is}} one of the reasons why RNA viruses often mutate to form new strains.|$|E

5|$|Most Proteaceae and all Banksia species, {{including}} B.aemula, have proteoid roots, roots with dense {{clusters of}} short lateral rootlets that form a mat {{in the soil}} just below the leaf litter. These roots are particularly <b>efficient</b> <b>at</b> absorbing nutrients from nutrient-poor soils, such as the phosphorus-deficient native soils of Australia. A study of six wallum species, including B.aemula, found they have adapted to very low levels of phosphorus and are highly sensitive to increased levels of the element, leading to phosphorus toxicity. Some evidence suggests they are <b>efficient</b> <b>at</b> using potassium, and sensitive to calcium toxicity as well. A field study on North Stradbroke Island noted increased root growth in autumn (around April), but that overall root growth was more constant than other species looked at, possibly because its deeper roots had more regular access to groundwater.|$|E

5|$|Performance {{estimates}} of the Spey-engined Phantom contrary to its American equivalent indicated that the former had a 30% shorter take-off distance, 20% faster climb to altitude, higher top speed and longer range. The Spey was more <b>efficient</b> <b>at</b> lower altitudes, and had better acceleration at low speed, giving British Phantoms better range and acceleration, which was shown during the deployment of 892 NAS to the Mediterranean aboard USS Saratoga in 1969, when the F-4K was repeatedly quicker off the deck than the F-4J used by the Americans. It was less <b>efficient</b> <b>at</b> higher altitudes, the British Phantoms lacking speed compared to J79-powered versions owing to the increased drag of the re-designed fuselage. This discrepancy became apparent when the F-4J was obtained by the UK in 1984; it was regarded as being {{the best of the}} three variants to serve in the RAF.|$|E

5|$|Crickets {{often appear}} as {{characters}} in literature. The Talking Cricket features in Carlo Collodi's 1883 children's book, The Adventures of Pinocchio, and in films {{based on the}} book. The eponymous insect is central to Charles Dickens's 1845 The Cricket on the Hearth, as is the chirping insect in George Selden's 1960 The Cricket in Times Square. Crickets are celebrated in poems by William Wordsworth, John Keats, and Du Fu. They are kept as pets in countries from China to Europe, sometimes for cricket fighting. Crickets are <b>efficient</b> <b>at</b> converting their food into body mass, making them a candidate for food production. They are used as food in Southeast Asia, where they are sold deep-fried in markets as snacks. They are also used to feed carnivorous pets and zoo animals.
