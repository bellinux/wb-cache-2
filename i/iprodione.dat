50|$|Dicarboximide (or dicarboxamide) {{fungicides}} are {{a family}} of agricultural fungicides that include vinclozolin, <b>iprodione,</b> and procymidone. Dicarboximides are believed to inhibit triglyceride biosynthesis in sclerotia-forming fungi, including Botrytis cinerea. These fungicides turn into 3,5-dichloroaniline in soil rapidly. Repeated use of dicarboximides over several years reduce their effectiveness. Resistance has developed against all dicarboximides in many plant species, including vines, strawberries and protected crops, and are recommended {{to be used in}} conjunction with other fungicides.|$|E
50|$|Alternaria dianthia {{was first}} {{recorded}} in the scientific literature by F.L. Stevens and J.G. Hall in 1909, from florists in the United States. The fungus, along {{with other members of}} the Alternaria genus, is effectively controlled by the commercial fungicide mancozeb, as well as dithiocarbamtes, chlorotholonil, and <b>iprodione.</b> Although A. dianthi has been found in wild and commercial varieties of Dianthus plants worldwide, no studies of the economic impacts or losses due the disease have been published.|$|E
5000|$|Alternaria mali {{prevention}} {{consists of}} strict quarantine, never importing plants or scions from affected plants and collecting fallen or infected leaves and burning them in winter. Apple cultivars can be ranked {{in order of}} increasing resistance as follows: Indo, Red Gold, Raritan, Delicious, Fuji, Golden Delicious, Ralls, Toko, Tsugaru, Mutsu, Jonagold, Jonathan. Chemical control uses fungicides such as <b>iprodione,</b> mancozeb and captan. [...] Disease severity is aggravated by severe mite infestation; thus good mite management {{is an important factor}} in preventing severe disease development.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} {{techniques}} currently used to manage M. phaseolina fungal infections. Often, fungicides {{are used to}} inhibit mycelial growth. These include thiram, <b>iprodione,</b> carbendazim, pyraclostrobin, fluquinconazol, tolyfluanid, and metalaxyl and penflufen + trifloxystrobin. The active ingredients carbendazim and penflufen + trifloxystrobin were shown {{to be the most}} powerful to control M. phaseolina. In this same study, the M. phaseolina isolate showed insensitivity to the active ingredients fluquinconazole, metalaxyl, thiram and tolyfluanid. Thus, fungicides are not necessarily an effective way to manage this fungal pathogen.|$|E
50|$|Since the {{phase-out}} of vinclozolin, {{farmers are}} faced with fewer options to control gray and white mold. The New York State Agricultural Experiment Station has carried out efficacy trials for gray and white mold. Research has showed potential alternatives to vinclozolin. Trifloxystrobin (Flint), <b>iprodione</b> (Rovral), and cyprodinil plus fludioxonil (Switch) control gray mold. Thiophanate-methyl (Topsin M) was as effective as vinclozolin in controlling white molds. Switch was the most promising alternative to vinclozolin for controlling both gray and white mold on pods and for increasing marketable yield.|$|E
50|$|Chemical {{control is}} an option for {{practitioners}} who need to maintain high quality, visually pleasing turfgrass. There are many fungicides labeled for control of Sclerotinia homoeocarpa, including benzimidazoles, carboxamides, nitriles, dicarboxamides, and demethylation inhibitors (DMIs). Some common fungicides used include chlorothalonil (nitrile), propiconazole (DMI), boscalid (carboxamide), thiophanate-methyl (benzamidazole), and <b>iprodione</b> (dicarboxamide). Preventative fungicide programs should be implemented when conditions are favorable for disease development (i.e., in the Spring when nighttime temperatures reach 50 F). While preventative applications are most effective, curative applications are also successful, but often require high rates and short application intervals.|$|E
50|$|These {{chemical}} classes {{should be}} rotated so that selection {{pressure on the}} disease in limited as to avoid resistant strains of this disease. The applicator should read and follow all label rates and directions. Breaking these directions and misuse of any labeled product is breaking the law. Remember that the label is the law. The best way to control Microdochium Patch especially going into winter {{is to use a}} three way spray right before the first snow fall. A combination of a dicarboximides such as <b>iprodione,</b> a chloronitrile such as chlorothalonil, and a DMI such as propiconazole will give sufficient control over the span of an average winter.|$|E
50|$|Lettuce drop {{is another}} {{resilient}} {{disease of the}} lettuce plant. It {{can be found in}} all lettuce-growing regions of the U.S. and is able to survive in the soil for up to a decade after infecting a field. The fungus appears on the plant as a white mass on the leaf that slowly turns into a hard black growth. These growths release spores that infect the lettuce plant with pathogens that slowly move up the stalk, killing tissue as they travel. Use of DCNA, <b>iprodione,</b> and vinclozolin about a month before harvest has been shown to significantly reduce lettuce drop in treated fields. In treated California fields fungicides are able to reduce yield losses as low as 5%.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the absence}} of treated seed, there are {{multiple}} chemical sprays available to treat Alternaria dauci. Azoxystrobin, chlorothalonil, <b>iprodione,</b> pyraclostrobin and bacillus are a few common fungicides to consider for foliar application. A few brand names {{to look for in}} the Midwest include RR Endura 70WG, Rovral, and Switch. Gibberrillic acid has shown to be equally effective as the aforementioned fungicides. However, if sprayed in excess giberrillic acid can defer nutrients from the roots to foliage, resulting in undeveloped carrots. If chemically treating plants, scouting the crop is of utmost importance. Initial threshold recommendations vary depending on location, time of year, and moisture level. Different recommendations include spraying upon first evidence of symptoms or spraying once disease has reached 25% of the foliage ...|$|E
50|$|In Brazil, it is {{recommended}} not to plant seed lots with more than 30 percent black point in order to limit spot blotch. Seed treatment {{may prove to be}} appropriate, although the inoculum remaining on secondary hosts or in the soil may reduce the treatment efficiency. Seed treatments with phytoalexin inducer appeared to provide good protection to wheat seedlings against ''''''B. sorokiniana'''''' infection (Hait and Sinha, 1986). Seed treatment with fungicide will help protect germinating seed and seedlings from fungi causing seedling blights. Fungicide seed treatments include: captan, mancozeb, maneb, thiram, pentachloronitrobenzene (PCNB) or carboxin guazatine plus, <b>iprodione</b> and triadimefon (Stack and McMullen, 1988; Mehta, 1993). Seed-borne inoculum of ''''''P. tritici-repentis'''''' can be controlled with seed-applied fungicides, such as guazatine and guazatine + imazalil, but other chemicals are also effective (Schilder and Bergstrom, 1993).|$|E
50|$|Typhula blight {{and snow}} molds can be {{controlled}} by fungicide applications. However, {{the timing of the}} application is crucial. This chemical treatment {{needs to be done in}} late fall before the first snow fall. If the application is made too soon a second follow up treatment may be needed. Possible chemical applications include: a demethylation inhibitor, or DMI, with a chlorothalonil product, a DMI with a thiophanate-methyl product, or an <b>Iprodione</b> with a chlorothalonil product. Typhula blight can also be controlled culturally. One method would be to plant a less susceptible turfgrass. Bentgrass and annual bluegrass are the two most susceptible turfgrasses to Typhula blight. Another method is to limit heavy late season fertilizer applications. Finally, cutting the grass until dormancy to keep the grass height down can help.|$|E
50|$|Pythium and Rhizoctonia {{are both}} {{seedling}} {{diseases of the}} cotton plant. They can be devastating to cotton plants because they develop when seedlings are unable to overcome the damage being caused by the invading fungus. The diseases often kill seeds before they grow. However, if the seeds do manage to sprout they demonstrate symptoms almost immediately. The stalks of the cotton plant will be weak, brown sunken lesions {{will appear on the}} stem, and the plant will often die before producing or will have very poor yields. Growers who plant early are especially susceptible because cooler temperatures and damper weather are conducive to these diseases. Therefore, growers who plant early are advised to use in-furrow fungicides for control: PNCB and <b>iprodione</b> for Rhizoctonia and etridiazole and mefenoxam for pythium. Recently, azoxystrobin has proven effective in controlling both rhizoctonia and pythium.|$|E

However, limited {{studies have been}} conducted to evaluate the effects of repeated fungicide applications and interactive effects of different agrochemical applications on soil microorganisms. In this study, an incubation experiment was established to evaluate the potential influences of the fungicide <b>iprodione</b> and the nitrification inhibitor 3, 4 -dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) on soil enzyme activities and bacterial properties. Weekly <b>iprodione</b> applications decreased the activities of all enzymes tested, and DMPP application inhibited soil urease activity. Compared with the blank control, bacterial 16 S rRNA gene abundance decreased following repeated <b>iprodione</b> applications, but increased after DMPP application. After 28 days of incubation, the treatment receiving both <b>iprodione</b> and DMPP application had higher bacterial 16 S rRNA gene abundance and Shannon diversity index than the treatment with <b>iprodione</b> applications alone. Repeated <b>iprodione</b> applications significantly increased the relative abundance of Proteobacteria, but decreased the relative abundances of Chloroflexi and Acidobacteria. Simultaneously, bacterial community structure was changed by repeated <b>iprodione</b> applications, alone or together with DMPP. These results showed that repeated <b>iprodione</b> applications exerted negative effects on soil enzyme activities, bacterial biomass and community diversity. Moreover, relative to <b>iprodione</b> applications alone, additional DMPP application could alleviate the toxic effects of <b>iprodione</b> applications on bacterial biomass and community diversity.

40|$|Botrytis cinerea {{isolates}} {{collected from}} Niagara region {{were treated with}} different concentrations of the fiingicide, <b>iprodione</b> to test their sensitivity to this fungicide. These Botrytis cinerea isolates {{were divided into two}} groups according to their sensitivity to <b>iprodione.</b> Those isolates whose growth was inhibited by <b>iprodione</b> at concentrations < 2 |i,g/nil were classified as sensitive isolates. Isolates that were able to show considerable growth at 2 |j,g/ml <b>iprodione</b> were classified as resistant isolates. Resistant and sensitive isolates were compared for their morphological and growth characteristics, conidial germination, virulence on grape berries and protein banding profiles. The fungicide <b>iprodione</b> at a concentration of 2 |xg/nil inhibited mycelial growth, sporulation and conidial germination of sensitive isolates but not those of resistant isolates. The inhibitory effect of the fungicide was greater on mycelial growth than on conidia germination of the sensitive isolates. Sensitive isolates produced no sclerotia whereas resistant isolates produced large number of sclerotia. The fungicide <b>iprodione</b> affected sclerotial production in the resistant isolates. The number of sclerotia was decreased by the increase of <b>iprodione</b> in the medium. Sporulation of resistant isolates was improved significantly in the presence of <b>iprodione.</b> The resistant isolates were as virulent as the sensitive isolates on grape berries.

40|$|A {{bacterial}} strain able to transform <b>iprodione</b> was isolated from a fast iprodione-degrading soil by enrichment procedures. Transformation was detected through 3, 5 -dichloroaniline production {{as measured by}} a rapid colorimetric method. The strain, MA 6, was tentatively identified as an Arthrobacter sp. When it was incubated with MA 6 in a minimum mineral medium (pH 6. 5), <b>iprodione</b> (8. 8 mumol/liter) was transformed into two major metabolites that were identified by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis: 3, 5 -dichlorophenylcarboximide (metabolite 1) and (3, 5 -dichlorophenylurea) acetic acid (metabolite 2), which was produced after ring cleavage of the former product.

40|$|<b>Iprodione</b> is a {{fungicide}} {{commonly used}} {{in a range of}} crops resulting in its common detection in natural water resources. Biological degradation constitutes the major dissipation processes controlling its environmental dissipation. We aimed to isolate and characterize soil bacteria able to metabolize <b>iprodione</b> and its key metabolite 3, 5 -DCA. Initial microcosm laboratory studies in a pristine acidic soil (without previous exposure to the fungicide) showed a slow dissipation of <b>iprodione.</b> Subsequent enrichment cultures from the same soil as well as from a soil with previous exposure to <b>iprodione</b> resulted in the isolation of two bacterial cultures (C 2. 7 and A 1. 4) that degraded <b>iprodione</b> and 3, 5 -DCA respectively, both obtained from the pristine soil. Molecular fingerprinting revealed that C 2. 7 was composed of two strains, identified via cloning as Arthrobacter sp. (strain C 1) and Achromobacter sp. (strain C 2), whereas A 1. 4 was pure and it was identified as Pseudomonas sp. Degradation studies with the purified isolates Arthrobacter sp. strain C 1, Achromobacter sp. strain C 2 and their combination in minimal and rich media showed that Arthrobacter sp. strain C 1 was the key iprodione-degrader, whereas Achromobacter sp. strain C 2 was only able to slowly co-metabolize <b>iprodione.</b> Transformation of <b>iprodione</b> by Arthrobacter sp. strain C 1 resulted in the formation of isopropylamine which could be used by the strain as C and N source. This finding suggests that <b>iprodione</b> degradation by our isolate proceeds via the formation of intermediate metabolites before final hydrolysis to 3, 5 -DCA. Arthrobacter sp. strain C 1 showed maximal <b>iprodione</b> degradation and 3, 5 -DCA formation at the higher pH-temperature combination (7. 5 - 35 °C) and maintained its degradation capacity {{in the presence of a}} mixture of pesticides expected to co-occur in on-farm biobed systems.

Os fungos A. niger e A. ochraceus foram os mais sensíveis a <b>iprodione,</b> tendo apresentado ED 50 de 2, 5 e 3, 1 mg. l- 1, respectivamente. This {{experiment}} aimed {{to evaluate the}} <b>iprodione</b> effects on mycelial growth of fungi commonly associated with rice seeds {{in the state of}} Minas Gerais, Brazil. Isolates of Alternaria alternata, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus ochraceus, Curvularia oryzae, Drechslera oryzae, Gerlachia oryzae, Phoma sorghina and Pyricularia grisea were obtained from rice seeds and mycelial growth measured in PDA medium containing the fungicide at concentrations of 10 mg. l- 1, 50 mg. l- 1, 100 mg. l- 1 and 500 mg. l- 1, after seven days of incubation. The effect of <b>iprodione</b> was evaluated by calculating ED 50 (dose required for inhibiting 50 % of the mycelial growth). <b>Iprodione</b> inhibits with high effect (ED 50 50 mg. l- 1) the mycelial growth of P. grisea. The fungi A. niger and A. ochraceus were the most sensitive ones to the fungicide tested with ED 50 of 2, 5 e 3, 1 mg. l- 1, respectively...|$|E
