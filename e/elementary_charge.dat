25|$|The <b>elementary</b> <b>charge</b> {{is one of}} the {{fundamental}} physical constants, and accurate knowledge of its value is of great importance. His experiment measured the force on tiny charged droplets of oil suspended against gravity between two metal electrodes. Knowing the electric field, the charge on the droplet could be determined. Repeating the experiment for many droplets, Millikan showed that the results could be explained as integer multiples of a common value (1.592 × 10−19 coulomb), which is the charge of a single electron. That this is somewhat lower than the modern value of 1.602 176 53(14) x 10−19 coulomb is probably due to Millikan's use of an inaccurate value for the viscosity of air.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{calculations}} {{of the rate}} at which falling droplets in clouds collide with aerosols have led to the conclusion that except in thunderclouds any electrical charges on the aerosols or droplets have little effect on the collision rate.

The calculations are for the size range of 0. 1 - to 1. 0 -�m radius with the collision efficiency compared to that for phoretic and Brownian effects being greater by up to a factor of 30 greater for droplets from 18. 6 - to 106 -�m radius with relative humidity in the range 95 %– 100 % and only 50 <b>elementary</b> <b>charges</b> on the aerosol.

The electric charge per mole of electrons is a constant called the Faraday constant and had been known since 1834 when Michael Faraday published his works on electrolysis.
