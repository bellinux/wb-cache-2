2500|$|Each carbon atom {{bearing a}} {{hydroxyl}} group (-OH), {{with the exception}} of the first and last carbons, are asymmetric, making them stereo centers with two possible configurations each (R or S). Because of this asymmetry, a number of isomers may exist for any given monosaccharide formula. Using Le Bel-van't Hoff rule, the aldohexose D-glucose, for example, has the formula (C·H2O)6, of which four of its six carbons atoms are stereogenic, making D-glucose one of 24=16 possible stereoisomers. In the case of glyceraldehydes, an aldotriose, there is one pair of possible stereoisomers, which are enantiomers and epimers. 1, 3-dihydroxyacetone, the ketose corresponding to the aldose glyceraldehydes, is a symmetric molecule with no stereo centers. The assignment of D or L is made according to the orientation of the asymmetric carbon furthest from the carbonyl group: in a standard <b>Fischer</b> <b>projection</b> if the hydroxyl group is on the right the molecule is a D sugar, otherwise it is an L sugar. The [...] "D-" [...] and [...] "L-" [...] prefixes should not be confused with [...] "d-" [...] or [...] "l-", which indicate the direction that the sugar [...] rotates plane polarized light.

50|$|In a <b>Fischer</b> <b>projection,</b> all {{horizontal}} bonds project {{toward the}} viewer, while vertical bonds project {{away from the}} viewer. Therefore, a <b>Fischer</b> <b>projection</b> cannot be rotated by 90° or 270° in {{the plane of the}} page or the screen, as the orientation of bonds relative to one another can change, converting a molecule to its enantiomer. However, any rotation of 180° doesn't change the molecule's representation. Swapping two pairs of groups attached to the central carbon atom still represents the same molecule as was represented by the original <b>Fischer</b> <b>projection.</b>|$|E

50|$|Several {{other methods}} for {{depicting}} chemical structures are also {{commonly used in}} organic chemistry (though less frequently than skeletal formulae). For example, conformational structures look similar to skeletal formulae and are used to depict the approximate positions of the atoms in a molecule, as a perspective drawing. Other types of representations, e.g., Newman projections, Haworth <b>projections</b> and <b>Fischer</b> <b>projections,</b> also look somewhat similar to skeletal formulae.

40|$|On {{the basis}} of {{empirical}} <b>Fischer</b> <b>projections,</b> we develop an algebraic approach to the central molecular chirality of tetrahedral molecules. The elements of such an algebra are obtained from the 24 projections which a single chiral tetrahedron can generate in S and R absolute configurations. They constitute a matrix representation of the O(4) orthogonal group. According to this representation, given a molecule with n chiral centres, {{it is possible to}} define an "index of chirality chi = {n, p}", where n is the number of stereogenic centres of the molecule and p the number of permutations observed under rotations and superimpositions of the tetrahedral molecule to its mirror image. The chirality index not only assigns the global chirality of a given tetrahedral chain, but indicates also a way to predict the same property for new compounds, which can be built up consistently...|$|R
40|$|The {{algebraic}} {{structure of}} central molecular chirality {{can be achieved}} starting from the geometrical representation of bonds of tetrahedral molecules, as complex numbers in polar form, and the empirical <b>Fischer</b> <b>projections</b> used in organic chemistry. A general orthogonal O(4) algebra is derived from which we obtain a chirality index related to the classification of a molecule as achiral, diastereoisomer or enantiomer. Consequently, the chiral features of tetrahedral chains can be predicted {{by means of a}} molecular Aufbau. Moreover, a consistent Schroedinger equation is developed, whose solutions are the bonds of tetrahedral molecules in complex number representation. Starting from this result, the O(4) algebra can be considered as a quantum chiral algebra. It is shown that the operators of such an algebra preserve the parity of the whole system.
