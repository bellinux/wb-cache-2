5|$|Andrew Peck also {{considers}} the Slender Man {{to be an}} authentic form of folklore and notes its similarity to emergent forms of offline legend performance. Peck suggests that digital folklore performance extends the dynamics of face-to-face performance in several notable ways, such as by occurring asynchronously, encouraging imitation and personalization while also allowing perfect replication, combining elements of oral, written, and visual communication, and generating shared expectations <b>for</b> <b>performance</b> that enact group identity {{despite the lack of}} a physically present group. He concludes that the Slender Man represents a digital legend cycle that combines the generic conventions and emergent qualities of oral and visual performance with the collaborative potential of networked communication.|$|E

5|$|Around 1733 Bach {{transposed}} his Latin Magnificat to Dmajor (BWV243). Besides transposing, he also {{applied a}} few modifications: {{for instance in}} the movement that has Luke1:54 as text he replaced the trumpet as performer of the cantus firmus by two oboes. Around a decade later Bach prepared two Latin Magnificats by other composers <b>for</b> <b>performance</b> (BWV1082, BWV Anh. 30). Probably {{around the same time}} Bach performed BWV10 again.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not known}} when Monteverdi {{received}} the libretto from Badoaro, but this was presumably during or before 1639 since the work was being prepared <b>for</b> <b>performance</b> in the 1639–40 carnival. In keeping with the general character of Venetian opera, the work was written for a small band—around five string players and various continuo instruments. This reflected the financial motives of the merchant princes who were sponsoring the opera houses—they demanded commercial as well as artistic success, and wanted to minimise costs. As was common at the time, precise instrumentation is not indicated in the score, which exists in a single handwritten manuscript discovered in the Vienna National Library in the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Jane Marian Joseph (31 May 1894– 9 March 1929) was an English composer, {{arranger}} {{and music}} teacher.

Many of her works were composed <b>for</b> <b>performance</b> at these festivals and similar occasions. Her early death, which prevented the full realisation of her talents, was considered by her contemporaries as a considerable loss to English music.|$|E

5|$|Jean Sibelius's Symphony No. 8 was {{his final}} major {{compositional}} project, occupying him intermittently from the mid-1920s until around 1938, {{though he never}} published it. During this time Sibelius was {{at the peak of}} his fame, a national figure in his native Finland and a composer of international stature. A fair copy of at least the first movement was made, but how much of the Eighth Symphony was completed is unknown. Sibelius repeatedly refused to release it <b>for</b> <b>performance,</b> though he continued to assert that he was working on it even after he had, according to later reports from his family, burned the score and associated material, probably in 1945.|$|E
5|$|Judah Beer was {{a leader}} of the Berlin Jewish {{community}} and maintained a private synagogue in his house which leaned towards reformist views. Jacob Beer wrote an early cantata <b>for</b> <b>performance</b> at this synagogue. Both Judah Herz Beer and his wife were close to the Prussian court; when Amalia was awarded in 1816 the Order of Louise, she was given, by Royal dispensation, not the traditional Cross but a portrait bust of the Queen. The Beer children were provided with a fine education; their tutors included two {{of the leaders of the}} enlightened Jewish intelligentsia, the author Aaron Halle-Wolfssohn and Edmund Kley, (later a reform movement rabbi in Hamburg) to whom they remained attached into their maturity. The brothers Alexander von Humboldt, the renowned naturalist, geographer and explorer, and the philosopher, linguist and diplomat Wilhelm von Humboldt were close friends of the family circle.|$|E

5|$|Mendelssohn's {{interest}} in baroque music {{was not limited}} to the Bach St Matthew Passion which he had revived in 1829. He was concerned in preparing and editing such music, whether <b>for</b> <b>performance</b> or for publication, to be {{as close as possible to}} the original intentions of the composers, including wherever possible a close study of early editions and manuscripts. This could lead him into conflict with publishers; for instance, his edition of Handel's oratorio Israel in Egypt for the London Handel Society (1845) evoked an often contentious correspondence, with Mendelssohn refusing for example to add dynamics where not given by Handel, or to add parts for trombones. Mendelssohn also edited a number of Bach's works for organ, and apparently discussed with Robert Schumann the possibility of producing a complete Bach edition.|$|E
5|$|Monteverdi's next {{commission}} from Mantua {{came early}} in 1618, {{when he was}} asked to provide the music for Andromeda, an opera based on the ancient Greek myth of the princess chained to a rock. The libretto was written by Duke Ferdinando's chancellor, Ercole Marigliani, and the project was sponsored by the duke's younger brother, Don Vincenzo Gonzaga. It is probable that the work was intended <b>for</b> <b>performance</b> at the Mantua Carnival of March 1618, but as Carter records, Monteverdi's approach to his Mantua commissions was often dilatory and half-hearted; his inability or unwillingness to work on Andromeda delayed its performance, first to 1619 and then to 1620.|$|E
