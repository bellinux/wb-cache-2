40|$|In {{order to}} better {{understand}} the process of angiogenesis in the developing human brain, we have examined the spatial relationship and relative contributions of endothelial cells and pericytes, the two primary cell types involved in vessel growth, together with their relation with the vascular basement membrane. Pericytes were immunolocalized through use of the specific markers nerve/glial antigen 2 (NG 2) proteoglycan, endosialin (CD 248) and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFR-beta), while endothelial cells were identified by the pan-endothelial marker CD 31 and the blood brain barrier (BBB) -specific markers claudin- 5 and glucose transporter isoform 1 (GLUT- 1). The quantitative analysis demonstrates that microvessels of the fetal human telencephalon are characterized by a continuous layer of activated/angiogenic NG 2 pericytes, which tightly invest endothelial cells and participate in the earliest stages of vessel growth. Immunolabelling with anti-active matrix metalloproteinase- 2 (aMMP- 2) and anti-collagen type IV antibodies revealed that aMMP- 2 producing endothelial cells and pericytes are both associated with the vascular basement membrane during vessel sprouting. Detailed localization of the two vascular cell types during angiogenesis suggests that growing microvessels of the human telencephalon are formed by a pericyte-driven angiogenic process in which the endothelial cells are preceded and guided by migrating pericytes during organization of the <b>growing</b> <b>vessel</b> wall...|$|E
40|$|Cardiovascular {{diseases}} {{account for}} more than half of total mortality before the age of 75 in industrialized countries. To develop therapies promoting the compensatory growth of blood vessels could be superior to palliative surgical surgical interventions. Therefore, much effort has been put into investigating underlying mechanisms. Depending on the initial trigger, growth of blood vessels in adult organisms proceeds via two major processes, angiogenesis and arteriogenesis. While angiogenesis is induced by hypoxia and results in new capillaries, arteriogenesis is induced by physical forces, most importantly fluid shear stress. Consequently, chronically elevated fluid shear stress was found to be the strongest trigger under experimental conditions. Arteriogenesis describes the remodelling of pre-existing arterio-arteriolar anastomoses to completely developed and functional arteries. In both growth processes, enlargement of vascular wall structures was proposed to be covered by proliferation of existing wall cells. Recently, increasing evidence emerges, implicating a pivotal role for circulating cells, above all blood monocytes, in vascular growth processes. Since it has been shown that monocytes/macrophage release a cocktail of chemokines, growth factors and proteases involved in vascular growth, their contribution seems to be of a paracrine fashion. A similar role is currently discussed for various populations of bone-marrow derived stem cells and endothelial progenitors. In contrast, the initial hypothesis that these cells -after undergoing a (trans-) differentiation- contribute by a structural integration into the <b>growing</b> <b>vessel</b> wall, is increasingly challenged...|$|E

50|$|There {{are several}} {{pathways}} {{of communication between}} the endothelial cells and pericytes. The first is transforming growth factor (TGF) signaling, which is mediated by endothelial cells. This is important for pericyte differentiation.

Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) pathway signaling from endothelial cells recruits pericytes, so that pericytes can migrate to <b>growing</b> <b>vessels.</b> If this pathway is blocked, it leads to pericyte deficiency.

40|$|EDU Branching out {{requires}} VEGF ot all isoforms {{are created}} equal. New results from Christiana Ruhrberg, David Shima (Cancer Research UK, London, UK), and colleagues {{reveal that the}} stickiness of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) {{can make all the}} difference between blood vessels growing larger or finding new territory. VEGF initiates the formation and expansion of the vascular system. VEGF isoforms differ in their ability to bind to the extracellular matrix (ECM), but, in vitro, endothelial cell proliferation is stimulated by VEGF regardless of its ECM-binding ability. In the new study, Shima’s group examined mice engineered to make only single VEGF isoforms. These mice reveal that VEGF isoforms have opposing effects on <b>growing</b> <b>vessel</b> networks. Although all forms stimulated cell growth in vivo, mice that expressed only soluble VEGF had expanded microvessels with fewer branches. In contrast, microvessels in mice with only ECM-binding VEGF were narrow and branched excessively. “Our results indicate that growth is integrated with tissues, because the tissue provides localized cues by depositing VEGF in precise spatial patterns, ” says Ruhrberg. The road map is provided by ECM-bound VEGF, which attracted filopodia extending from the tip of a new vessel branch. Soluble VEGF did not remain where it was secreted, but rather traveled further away, thus stimulating expansion of existing vessels from a distance. The authors hope to raise awareness of isoform-specific effects for those considering the use of VEGF for therapy to increase or block angiogenesis...|$|E
40|$|The {{growth of}} solid tumours beyond a {{critical}} size {{is dependent upon}} angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from an existing vasculature. Tumours may remain dormant at microscopic sizes for some years before switching to a mode in which growth of a supportive vasculature is initiated. The new blood vessels supply nutrients, oxygen, and access to routes by which tumour cells may travel to other sites within the host (metastasize). In recent decades an abundance of biological {{research has focused on}} tumour-induced angiogenesis in the hope that treatments targeted at the vasculature may result in a stabilisation or regression of the disease: a tantalizing prospect. The complex and fascinating process of angiogenesis has also attracted the interest of researchers in the field of mathematical biology, a discipline that is, for mathematics, relatively new. The challenge in mathematical biology is to produce a model that captures the essential elements and critical dependencies of a biological system. Such a model may ultimately be used as a predictive tool. In this thesis we examine a number of aspects of tumour-induced angiogenesis, focusing on growth of the neovasculature external to the tumour. Firstly we present a one-dimensional continuum model of tumour-induced angiogenesis in which elements of the immune system or other tumour-cytotoxins are delivered via the newly formed vessels. This model, based on observations from experiments by Judah Folkman et al., is able to show regression of the tumour for some parameter regimes. The modelling highlights a number of interesting aspects of the process that may be characterised further in the laboratory. The next model we present examines the initiation positions of blood vessel sprouts on an existing vessel, in a two-dimensional domain. This model hypothesises that a simple feedback inhibition mechanism may be used to describe the spacing of these sprouts with the inhibitor being produced by breakdown of the existing vessel's basement membrane. Finally, we have developed a stochastic model of blood vessel growth and anastomosis in three dimensions. The model has been implemented in C++, includes an openGL interface, and uses a novel algorithm for calculating proximity of the line segments representing a <b>growing</b> <b>vessel.</b> This choice of programming language and graphics interface allows for near-simultaneous calculation and visualisation of blood vessel networks using a contemporary personal computer. In addition the visualised results may be transformed interactively, and drop-down menus facilitate changes in the parameter values. Visualisation of results is of vital importance in the communication of mathematical information to a wide audience, and we aim to incorporate this philosophy in the thesis. As biological research further uncovers the intriguing processes involved in tumourinduced angiogenesis, we conclude with a comment from mathematical biologist Jim Murray, Mathematical biology is : : : the most exciting modern application of mathematics...|$|E

We propose and validate several similarity metrics, which can be used to optimize the radii of the vascular tree. ...|$|R

We find that mice with disruptions of both NFATc 4 and the related NFATc 3 genes die around E 11 with generalized defects in vessel assembly as well as excessive and disorganized growth of vessels into the neural tube and somites. Since calcineurin is thought to control nuclear localization of NFATc proteins, we introduced a mutation into the calcineurin B gene that prevents phosphatase activation by Ca 2 + signals. These CnB mutant mice exhibit vascular developmental abnormalities similar to the NFATc 3 /c 4 null mice. We show that calcineurin function is transiently required between E 7. 5 and E 8. 5.

The mechanisms responsible for survivin down-regulation in resting conditions are still unknown. We report here that confluence and vascular endothelial-cadherin (VE-cadherin) expression induce contact inhibition of cell growth and survivin down-regulation in the endothelium.

Furthermore, in allantois organ cultures, survivin expression is up-regulated in areas of <b>growing</b> <b>vessels</b> where VE-cadherin is partially dismantled from junctions or in VE-cadherin −/− specimens. Overall, these data indicate that VE-cadherin and β-catenin may negatively regulate survivin synthesis in endothelial cells.

To better define the role of Dll 4 during vascular growth and differentiation, we selected the postnatal retina as a model because its vasculature develops shortly after birth in a highly stereotypic manner, during which time it is accessible to experimental manipulation. We report that Dll 4 expression is dynamically regulated by VEGF in the retinal vasculature, where it is most prominently expressed at the leading front of actively <b>growing</b> <b>vessels.</b> Deletion of a single Dll 4 allele or pharmacologic inhibition of Dll 4 /Notch signaling by intraocular administration of either soluble Dll 4 -Fc or a blocking antibody against Dll 4 all produced the same set of characteristic abnormalities in the developing retinal vasculature, most notably enhanced angiogenic sprouting and increased endothelial cell proliferation, resulting in the formation of a denser and more highly interconnected superficial capillary plexus. In a model of ischemic retinopathy, Dll 4 blockade also enhanced angiogenic sprouting and regrowth of lost retinal vessels while suppressing ectopic pathological neovascularization. Our data demonstrate that Dll 4 is induced by VEGF as a negative feedback regulator and acts to prevent overexuberant angiogenic sprouting, promoting the timely formation of a well differentiated vascular network...|$|R
