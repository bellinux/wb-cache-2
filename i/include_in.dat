5|$|At {{this point}} the plot {{concerned}} {{the crew of the}} Enterprise coming across God in space, something which Roddenberry had previously wanted to <b>include</b> <b>in</b> The Original Series but it had been turned down by NBC Primetime's executives. He thought that such an idea might be palatable to the Daytime executives instead. Roddenberry felt that such an episode would work better in animated form and asked Brody to work up a full script. Brody returned home and started work on the script immediately, wanting to improve it far beyond the point that he had developed when he pitched it for The Original Series.|$|E
5|$|Bacteria can {{be grown}} in the {{laboratory}} on nutrient culture media, but viruses need living cells in which to replicate. Many vaccines to infectious diseases {{can be grown}} in fertilised chicken eggs. Millions of eggs are used each year to generate the annual flu vaccine requirements, a complex process that takes about {{six months after the}} decision is made as to what strains of virus to <b>include</b> <b>in</b> the new vaccine. A problem with using eggs for this purpose is that people with egg allergies are unable to be immunised, but this disadvantage may be overcome as new techniques for cell-based rather than egg-based culture become available. Cell-based culture will also be useful in a pandemic when {{it may be difficult to}} acquire a sufficiently large quantity of suitable sterile, fertile eggs.|$|E
5|$|Bogdan-Pitești was {{the subject}} of several {{anonymous}} sketches, including two 1896 vignettes, published in Adevărul, and a 1917 drawing signed Correggio. He is also depicted in an affectionate cartoon published in 1914 by Petrescu Găină. Domnica Bogdan herself sat as a model for various artists, and was notably depicted in works by Camil Ressu, Pallady and the Bulgarian-born painter Pascin. In 1920, Bogdan-Pitești commissioned Paciurea to complete a portrait bust of Domnica. The same year, Dimitrescu painted her an oil-on-cardboard portrait in dominant shades of brown (with touches of red and gray). Artists who illustrated works by Bogdan-Pitești <b>include,</b> <b>in</b> addition to himself, George Demetrescu Mirea, Ion Georgescu and Satmari.|$|E

5|$|Captive crickets are omnivorous; when {{deprived}} of their natural diet, they accept {{a wide range of}} organic foodstuffs. Some species are completely herbivorous, feeding on flowers, fruit, and leaves, with ground-based species consuming seedlings, grasses, pieces of leaf, and the shoots of young plants. Others are more predatory and <b>include</b> <b>in</b> their diet invertebrate eggs, larvae, pupae, moulting insects, scale insects, and aphids. Many are scavengers and consume various organic remains, decaying plants, seedlings, and fungi. In captivity, many species have been successfully reared on a diet of ground, commercial dry dog food, supplemented with lettuce and aphids.|$|E
5|$|Like the game, {{the comic}} {{is set in}} a post-apocalyptic world, overrun by zombie-like creatures {{infected}} by a mutated strain of the Cordyceps fungus. The comics serve as a prequel to the game, chronicling the journey of the young Ellie and her meeting with another young survivor, Riley Abel. Druckmann chose Ellie as the focus of the comic due to the uniqueness of her birth and upbringing in the post-apocalyptic world. Hicks joined the project after discovering Ellie's role in the game, considering her an unusual character to <b>include</b> <b>in</b> a survival horror game. The comic's art style is different than the game art—a choice from Hicks to give the comic a unique feel and identity.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the major}} {{applications}} of sintered silicon nitride is in automobile industry as a material for engine parts. Those <b>include,</b> <b>in</b> diesel engines, glowplugs for faster start-up; precombustion chambers (swirl chambers) for lower emissions, faster start-up and lower noise; turbocharger for reduced engine lag and emissions. In spark-ignition engines, silicon nitride is used for rocker arm pads for lower wear, turbocharger for lower inertia and less engine lag, and in exhaust gas control valves for increased acceleration. As examples of production levels, there is an estimated more than 300,000 sintered silicon nitride turbochargers made annually.|$|E

Procedural due process is required any time a person faces the deprivation of life, liberty, or property. As substantive due process arises from the liberty clause, a deprivation of a substantive due process right is a deprivation of liberty and thus requires procedural due process.|$|E

In 1991, Jeff Minter released a shareware game titled Llamatron based on Robotron: 2084s design. Twenty years later, Minter released an upgraded version titled Minotron: 2112 on the iPhone.|$|E
5|$|Though Disney gave Nomura {{freedom in}} the {{characters}} and worlds used for the games, {{he and his staff}} tried to stay within the established roles of characters and boundaries of the worlds. Nomura has stated that though many of the Disney characters are not normally dark and serious, there were not many challenges making them so for the story, and despite this, their personalities shine because they maintain their own characteristics. He also felt managing and keeping multiple worlds was problematic. When deciding which worlds to <b>include</b> <b>in</b> the game, the development staff tried to take into account worlds with Disney characters that would be interesting and made an effort to minimize any overlap in the overall look and feel of each world.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of its target value and vulnerability, {{aircraft}} carriers are always escorted by at least one submarine for protection. The other vessels in the Strike Group provide additional capabilities, such as long range Tomahawk missiles or the Aegis Combat System, and also protect the carrier from attack. A typical Strike Group may <b>include,</b> <b>in</b> addition to an aircraft carrier: up to six surface combatants, including frigates (since retired from USN service), guided missile cruisers and guided missile destroyers (used primarily for anti-aircraft warfare and anti-submarine warfare); one or two attack submarines (for seeking out and destroying hostile surface ships and submarines); and an ammunition, oiler, and supply ship of Military Sealift Command to provide logistical support. The precise structure and numbers of each type of ship can vary between groups depending on the objectives of the deployment.|$|E
5|$|Hergé {{had been}} accused of exhibiting a racist {{attitude}} toward Africans in an earlier story, Tintin in the Congo, and potentially hoped to exonerate himself from such criticism by depicting Tintin and Haddock freeing African slaves in The Red Sea Sharks. In preparing the latter story he had consulted a colleague who worked for an African-themed magazine, L'Afrique et le Monde ("Africa and the World"); they translated some of the passages that Hergé wished to <b>include</b> <b>in</b> the story into Yoruba. However, in January 1962 an article in the magazine Jeune Afrique criticised Hergé for a racist depiction of Africans in the story, an accusation that would be echoed in other publications. These claims focused on the African characters' simplistic use of pidgin language, which was similar to the speech patterns used in Tintin in the Congo.|$|E
