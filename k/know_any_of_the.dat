5|$|The {{band has}} also seen musicians such as Keith Morris and Chuck Biscuits briefly {{fill in for}} a show or two. Morris, who was {{fronting}} the Circle Jerks at the time, filled in for Kiedis for a show in 1986. Kiedis was off scoring drugs and missed the band's performance so they asked Morris to fill in however Morris didn't <b>know</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lyrics to the songs so he screamed and yelled {{his way through the}} show. Drummer Chuck Biscuits also briefly filled in on drums back in 1986.|$|E
25|$|ALPINE and ALTITUDE {{only know}} how to reach ALASTAIR, but {{they are aware of}} at least some of other team members' {{identity}} should ALASTAIR be unavailable, and they would accept a message from ALBERT. Most often, the identity (and location) of the radio operator may not be shared. ALPINE and ALTITUDE, however, do not know one another. They do not <b>know</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> members of team ALICE.|$|E
500|$|Originally {{there was}} a scene after the four had been reunited in the museum where Amy had a [...] "meltdown" [...] and Rory assured her it was okay; this was cut due to pacing issues, which pleased Darvill as he disliked his {{performance}} in the scene. Gillan stated that the episode was the [...] "most difficult" [...] for her, as it was [...] "a big climax for Amy and her story that's been building through the series...it just required a lot of kind of concentration and emotion." [...] In August 2011 she stated that the Doctor and Amy's farewell was the most emotional scene for her to film. The scene in which the Doctor gives a final speech to young Amelia was not filmed with Smith and Blackwood on the same set. Smith's dialogue was shot first in the bedroom set, while the corner with the bed was recreated and filmed with Blackwood as a pick-up. Blackwood fell asleep during filming. Amy and Rory's wedding reception was filmed at Miskin Manor. Gillan found wearing the dress strange, while Darvill {{felt as if he}} was gate-crashing someone else's wedding, as he did not <b>know</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> extras there. Haynes wanted to first show the revelation that the TARDIS would appear at the reception in a small way with minor changes such as the glasses tinkling and chandelier shaking, and build it up from there. Moffat thought that Amy would want a big wedding with a lot of dancing. In the script it was written that the Doctor was a [...] "terrible dancer" [...] and danced like a [...] "drunk giraffe", and Smith additionally came up with his own routine.|$|E

6000|$|... "I hate a {{great many}} of these social rules," [...] he said, [...] "and {{although}} I did not <b>know</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rest of your family, I knew you, and felt very much inclined to call on you and let the customs take care of themselves." ...|$|E

60|$|The contemplative {{young man}} was a distant {{connection}} of the Teller, and his first name being Quincy, was commonly called Quee.

60|$|Lieut. D'Hubert, without {{questioning}} {{the accuracy of}} the deduction, did not see that it advanced him much on his official quest. For his quest after Lieut.

60|$|He {{who will}} go thus far, if he find on {{finishing}} this treatise that large bodies of facts, otherwise inexplicable, {{can be explained by}} the theory of descent, ought not to hesitate to go further, and to admit that a structure even as perfect as the eye of an eagle might be formed by natural selection, although in this case he does not <b>know</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> transitional grades. His reason ought to conquer his imagination; though I have felt the difficulty far too keenly to be surprised at any degree of hesitation in extending the principle of natural selection to such startling lengths.|$|E
60|$|It was {{the same}} way with the blacks.

That their appearance was coincidental {{with the arrival of the}} Arangi was an association that occurred as a matter of course in Jerry's brain. Further, he did not bother, save that there was a companion association, namely, that their occasional disappearances into the beyond was likewise coincidental with the Arangi's departure.|$|E
6000|$|Harley's perfidy {{allowed him}} to assure Marlborough he would [...] "never do any thing which shall forfeit your good opinion" [...] while pretending to plan to restore Marlborough to the Queen's confidence.
