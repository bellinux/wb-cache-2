5|$|Young <b>individuals</b> <b>have</b> {{yellowish}} or greenish tail {{tips and}} engage in caudal luring. The tail tip is wriggled to lure prey, such as frogs and lizards, within striking distance. Wharton (1960) observed captive specimens exhibiting this behavior between 07:20 and 19:40 hours, which suggests it is a daytime activity.|$|E
5|$|Adult Pteranodon {{specimens}} {{from the}} two major species {{can be divided into}} two distinct size classes. The smaller class of specimens have small, rounded head crests and very wide pelvic canals, even wider than those of the much larger size class. The size of the pelvic canal probably allowed the laying of eggs, indicating that these smaller adults are females. The larger size class, representing male <b>individuals,</b> <b>have</b> narrow hips and very large crests, which were probably for display.|$|E

5|$|Giant mouse lemurs {{were first}} {{studied in the}} wild by Petter and colleagues in 1971. His {{observations}} were secondary to his primary research interest, the fork-marked lemurs north of Morondava. Both northern and southern populations were studied intermittently between 1978 and 1981, and in 1993, long-term social and genetic studies began in Kirindy Forest. Behavioral studies of captive <b>individuals</b> <b>have</b> also been performed at the Duke Lemur Center (DLC) in Durham, North Carolina during the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Gryllus firmus {{exhibits}} wing polymorphism; some <b>individuals</b> <b>have</b> fully functional, long hind {{wings and}} others have short wings and cannot fly. The short-winged females have smaller flight muscles, greater ovarian development, and produce more eggs, so the polymorphism adapts the cricket for either dispersal or reproduction. In some long-winged individuals, the flight muscles deteriorate during adulthood and the insect's reproductive capabilities improve.|$|E

Using the within-state variation of the number of mandates, we show that each additional mandate causes approximately a 0. 2 percentage point decrease in the probability that an <b>individual</b> <b>has</b> EPHI. Importantly, using a two-stage least squares model, we are able to clearly demonstrate that these results are not biased by endogeneity. ...|$|R

5|$|Like {{the other}} big cats, the jaguar is capable of roaring and does so to warn {{territorial}} and mating competitors away; intensive bouts of counter-calling between <b>individuals</b> <b>have</b> been observed in the wild. Their roar often resembles a repetitive cough, and they may also vocalize mews and grunts. Mating fights between males occur, but are rare, and aggression avoidance behavior has been observed in the wild. When it occurs, conflict is typically over territory: a male's range may encompass that {{of two or three}} females, and he will not tolerate intrusions by other adult males.|$|E
