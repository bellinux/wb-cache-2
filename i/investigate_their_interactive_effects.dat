40|$|Understanding {{the effects}} of warming on {{greenhouse}} gas feedbacks to climate change represents a major global challenge. Most {{research has focused on}} direct effects of warming, without considering how concurrent changes in plant communities may alter such effects. Here, we combined vegetation manipulations with warming to <b>investigate</b> <b>their</b> <b>interactive</b> <b>effects</b> on greenhouse gas emissions from peatland. We found that although warming consistently increased respiration, the effect on net ecosystem CO 2 exchange depended on vegetation composition. The greatest increase in CO 2 sink strength after warming was when shrubs were present, and the greatest decrease when graminoids were present. CH 4 was more strongly controlled by vegetation composition than by warming, with largest emissions from graminoid communities. Our results show that plant community composition is a significant modulator of greenhouse gas emissions and their response to warming, and suggest that vegetation change could alter peatland carbon sink strength under future climate change...|$|E
40|$|Soil {{salinization}} and {{greenhouse gas}} emissions are major global environmental concerns. The extent of salinization and associated negative effects on soils and crop yields make the reclamation of these soils an international priority. With increasing interest {{in the use of}} organic amendments for remediating salt-affected soils, it is important to <b>investigate</b> <b>their</b> <b>interactive</b> <b>effects</b> on soil biogeochemical processes including {{greenhouse gas emissions}}, particularly carbon dioxide (CO 2) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O). The objectives of this dissertation are to: 1) evaluate the effects of soil salinity, temperature, and carbon availability from organic amendments on CO 2, N 2 O, and N 2 emissions; 2) determine the effect of changes in salinity and temperature on soil mineral N concentration from salt-affected soils following organic amendment applications; and 3) determine whether CO 2 and N 2 O emissions under field conditions were comparable qualitatively to those observed in the laboratory incubation studies. Organic amendments used in this research included: active greenwaste (AGW), cured greenwaste compost (CGW), active dairy manure (ADM), and cured dairy manure compost (CDM). The methods used in this research included monitoring CO 2 and N 2 O emissions, estimating N 2 emissions using acetylene block technique, and analysis of soil mineral N concentrations in the laboratory and field studies. Results from laboratory incubations showed that increases in soil salinity enhanced cumulative N 2 O-N losses but decreased cumulative CO 2 -C and N 2 emissions and N 2 to N 2 O-N ratios. Increases in soil temperatures greatly enhanced cumulative CO 2 -C, N 2 O-N, and N 2 emissions and ratios of N 2 to N 2 O-N from all treatments. In the field, results validated the laboratory findings that active organic materials, particularly AGW, reduced N 2 O emissions compared to cured amendments. In general, dairy manure amendments produced higher N 2 O emissions relative to the greenwaste treatments. In both laboratory and field studies, soils amended with greenwaste materials had lower soil nitrate concentrations compared to those treated with dairy manure amendments. Overall, this work showed that soil salinization resulted in greater N 2 O emissions following organic amendment applications. Nitrous oxide emissions are dependent on climatic conditions (e. g., precipitation and temperature), soil properties (e. g., electrical conductivity, microbial respiration, and nitrate concentration), organic amendment properties (e. g., feedstock and processing stage), and their interactions...|$|E
40|$|Carnivore (top-down) and {{resource}} (bottom-up) influences in food webs are strong and pervasive, but {{few studies have}} <b>investigated</b> <b>their</b> <b>interactive</b> <b>effects</b> in species-rich terrestrial ecosystems. This study focused on arthropods associated with the dominant tree species, Metrosideros polymorpha (Myrtaceae), in Hawaiian forests. Severe soil nutrient limitation on a 120 -yr-old lava flow was removed by fertilization and combined with bird predator exclusion cages in a randomized block design. Arthropod densities were measured from clipped foliage at the outset and conclusion of a 33 -mo experiment, and their biomass was estimated using regression equations. Metrosideros foliar nitrogen, tree growth, and biomass increased directly in response to fertilization but did not change with bird exclusion. Fertilization increased detritivore densities but not biomass, and both density and biomass of herbivores, while bird exclusion increased both density and biomass of carnivores. Fertilization also increased spider density and biomass, but bird exclusion increased spider numbers (15 species) only in high resource plots. Overall, trophic level biomass responses were less pronounced than density because smaller bodied individuals responded more to enrichment. Bottom-up factors controlled basal trophic levels, and detritivores comprised the largest fraction of arthropod density and biomass. Conversely, top-down impacts were apparent but variable, limited to higher order consumers, and did not cascade {{to the level of}} primary producers. These experimental results were consistent with the view that complex forest ecosystems are structured on a bottom-up template...|$|R
40|$|Aim. This {{paper is}} a report of a study {{assessing}} pressure ulcer incidence and factors affecting pressure ulcer development among older nursing home residents. Background. Previous researchers have shown that demographic, clinical, health status, risk and human resources factors affect pressure ulcer development among older people in various healthcare settings, but none has <b>investigated</b> <b>their</b> <b>interactive</b> <b>effects</b> among older nursing home residents. Method. This was a prospective cohort study involving 346 residents aged 65 years or over from four private nursing homes in Hong Kong. We collected information on participant demographics and assessed their clinical characteristics, health status and pressure ulcer risk factors. Subsequently, we assessed their skin condition every 2 days for 4 weeks to detect pressure ulcers that developed after the initial assessment. The data were collected between December 2006 and September 2007. Results. The pressure ulcer incidence was 25 · 16 %. The model in which the factors of clinical characteristics, health status, pressure ulcer risk and human resources were controlled was more reliable in predicting pressure ulcer development {{than the other two}} models. It showed that bedfast or chairfast residents, especially those with co-morbidities (renal failure and stroke) and living in nursing homes where there were no nurses but more nursing assistants, were at higher risk for pressure ulcer development. Conclusion. Evidence-based interventions should be adopted to minimize the possible problems of pressure, malnutrition, friction and shear force, and the decreased pain perception of bedfast or chairfast residents in nursing homes, especially those with renal failure or stroke.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} eucalypt trees on pasture in open eucalypt woodlands of north-eastern Queensland, 2 common native pasture species, Chrysopogon fallaxand Heteropogon contortus, were grown in soil collected from under tree canopies and inter-canopy areas.

40|$|In {{recent decades}} {{temperature}} elevation {{has been the}} focus of many studies on climate change, including effects on planktonic communities, but few studies have examined the effects of increased water color ("brownification"). Since these changes are likely to occur simultaneously, it is important to <b>investigate</b> <b>their</b> potential <b>interactive</b> <b>effects.</b> Accordingly, we performed a mesocosm experiment where we combined a 3 °C increase in temperature with a doubling in water color to study how these factors affect zooplankton. In particular, we looked at recruitment of cladocerans and copepods from the sediment in spring, as well as their establishment in the water column. Our results show that an elevated temperature will have considerable effects on recruitment as well as on pelagic abundances of both cladocerans and copepods, whereas increases in water color will have less effects on the recruitment and pelagic establishment. But more importantly, the proportion of cladocerans in the water column, relative to copepods, increased at higher temperature, suggesting that cladocerans benefit more from elevated temperatures than copepods do. Overall, these results likely stem from the combined effect of changes in recruitment and differences in life history between copepods and cladocerans. Taking a wider outlook, this suggests that future climate warming will change the dominance pattern of zooplankton communities in spring, and, in accordance with the experimental data, we here show that cladocerans are more abundant than copepods in natural lake ecosystems during warmer rather than cooler years...|$|R
