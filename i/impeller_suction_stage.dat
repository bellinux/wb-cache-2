To {{discuss the}} {{relationship}} between matric suction and strength under different drying-wetting cycle paths of residual clay, soil water characteristic curve {{was determined by the}} filter paper method. The shear strength, unconfined compressive strength and matric suction were obtained during desorption and adsorption at the drying and wetting cycle. The experimental results show that the matric suction of soil specimens subjected to different drying and wetting cycle paths are different although at the same water content. Contributions of internal friction angle and cohesion to shear strength are different at different matric suction. In the low matric <b>suction</b> <b>stage,</b> matric <b>suction</b> mainly contribute to shear strength by affecting the cohesion, yet in the high matric <b>suction</b> <b>stage</b> by increasing both the internal friction angle and cohesion; in the transition matric <b>suction</b> <b>stage,</b> the contribution of cohesion decreases while the contribution of internal friction angle increases. Furthermore, the unconfined compressive strength of specimens subjected to the drying and wetting cycle path of desorption first and then adsorption is reduced and increase with the opposite path.

40|$|Pump pre-swirl or uneven flow {{distribution}} {{in front of}} the pump can induce pump-intake vortices. These phenomena result in blockage of the <b>impeller</b> <b>suction</b> space, deterioration of efficiency, drop of head curve and earlier onset of cavitation. Real problematic case, where head curve drop was documented, is simulated using commercial CFD software. Computational simulation was carried out for three flow rates, which correspond to three operating regimes of the vertical pump. The domain consists of the pump sump, pump itself excluding the impeller and the delivery pipe. One-phase approach is applied, because the vortex cores were not filled with air during observation of the real pump operation. Numerical simulation identified two surface vortices and one bottom vortex. Their position and strength depend on the pump flow rate. Paper presents detail analysis of the flow field on the pump intake, discusses influence of the vortices on pump operation and suggests possible actions that should be taken to suppress the intake vortices...|$|R
40|$|Many {{studies have}} shown that bionic forms reduce drag through the control fluid medium. In this study, the evenly aligned pits of the whirligig beetle (Gyrinidae Latreille) notum were {{selected}} as the bionic form to be studied. They were used in centrifugal compressor impellers, called bionic centrifugal compressors, and the flow characteristics were simulated and compared to the prototype compressor. The simulation results show that compared to the prototype compressor, the pressure drag of bionic centrifugal compressors was reduced dramatically, while the pressure ratio was significantly improved. The pressure drag decreased by 19. 24 %, while the compression ratio increased by 9. 8 %. The bionic form of the blade delayed the boundary layer separation of the <b>impeller</b> <b>suction</b> surface, reducing the turbulent kinetic energy loss and improving internal air flow. The effect of drag reduction was shown to have a close relationship with the dimple size and bionic surface area; the greater the area, the better the drag reduction effect. However, there should exist an optimal bionic area, which could be determined by considering the flow velocity inside the impeller...|$|R

At the micro level, fluid converge {{is the process of}} the diffuser and the nozzles transforming between each other during <b>suction</b> <b>stage</b> and discharge stage in a single cycle. The conversion of the diffuser and the nozzles results in the shunting and impact of the fluid at the above-mentioned concentration junction, which will cause the trend of the shunting and the impact of the fluid within the pump chamber.|$|R
5000|$|The air escapes {{through the}} pump {{discharge}} nozzle whilst the fluid drops {{back down and}} is once more entrained by the <b>impeller.</b> The <b>suction</b> line is thus continuously evacuated.

For these reasons this solution is only adopted for small pumps, e.g. garden pumps. More frequently used types of self-priming pumps are side channel and water ring pumps. Another type of self-priming pump is a centrifugal pump with two casing chambers and an open impeller. This design is not only used for its self-priming capabilities but also for its degassing effects when pumping twophase mixtures (air/gas and liquid) for a short time in process engineering or when handling polluted fluids, for example when draining water from construction pits.|$|R

A new criterion, which is governed by the fluid physical properties, the geometry effect and the heat transfer rates at various oscillating stages, was developed. The theory can explain the operating range of the applied heating power. The dynamic measurements with a high speed data acquisition system shows that periodically a full cycle can be subdivided into a short liquid <b>suction</b> <b>stage,</b> a bulk boiling and a fluid discharge stage, followed by a pressure decrease stage with both of the valves closed. The average mass flow rate is small and can be computed by the energy conservation equation. The cycle period is shortened with increasing the applied heating power. The wall temperatures of the microchannel heat sink are oscillating with small amplitudes but they are slightly higher than the saturated temperature of the working fluid by several degrees. Deionized water {{was selected as the}} working fluid. Finally a closed loop heat driven pump design incorporating the microchannel heat sink and the condenser fin heat sink is proposed.

40|$|BACKGROUND: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate variations in heart rate and to determine the occurrence of oculocardiac reflex (OCR) during laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK). &# 13; METHODS: This descriptive, prospective study was designed to observe the effect of suction ring and ablation stages during LASIK procedure on the heart rate. The ECG was taken before and during LASIK operation on the first eye in 61 patients. These patients were selected randomly among cases that presented to Al-Zahra Hospital, Isfahan, Iran for LASIK surgery in summer 2001. All patients were healthy without history of cardiovascular disease and no systemic medication. The ECG prior to the procedure was considered as baseline. Decrease in the heart rate of 10 % or more of baseline was considered as oculocardiac reflex. &# 13; RESULTS: In 12 patients (20 %) the heart rate decreased more than 10 % during the <b>suction</b> ring <b>stage.</b> In 19 patients (31 %) the heart rate increased more than 20 % of baseline. In 15 patients (25 %) the heart rate increased 10 %- 20 % more than baseline during the preparation and ablation stages. In the remaining 15 patients (25 %) the heart rate did not change during the procedure. &# 13; CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study confirm that oculocardiac reflex may occur during the LASIK procedure especially in the <b>suction</b> ring <b>stage.</b> Because the oculocardiac reflex may cause heart rate changes during LASIK, the patients should be closely monitored during the procedure. &# 13; KEY WORDS: Laser in situ keratomileusis, oculocardiac reflex, suction ring...|$|R

40|$|Tutorialpg. 151 The {{essential}} elements {{to be reviewed}} when considering a centrifugal pump application are highlighted. The purpose is to ensure the procurement and/or application of a centrifugal pump which optimizes reliability, energy usage, maintenance costs, and achieves this in a safe manner. The {{need to understand the}} system hydraulics and complete process requirements is emphasized, as is the impact each system parameter has on pump design. The test is broken into three basic areas: pump boundaries conditions, flow requirements, and pump specification ? key elements. Pump boundary conditions addressed NPSH considerations as they relate to flow requirements, potential for cavitation damage, suction specific speed, and mechanical seal temperature margin. This section also addresses system resistance variations, and addresses the effects of variations in dynamic and static system heads and the potential prime causes of variations in these heads. Flow requirements discusses the determination of normal, maximum (or rated), and minimum flow requirements. A method of approximation of a pump?s minimum acceptable flowrate is presented (based on the pump?s hydraulic specifications), which utilizes suction specific speed and moderating factors such as impeller head, NPSH margin, specific gravity, etc. Attention is paid to the effect of excessive specified flow on NPSHA, flow rangeability, and suction specific speed. Mechanical and hydraulic interrelationships are discussed to emphasize how flowrate variations affect radial and axial thrust, <b>impeller</b> <b>suction</b> and discharge recirculation, and potential for cavitation; also covered are the effect of variation in running clearances and changes in specific gravity. Critical aspects of both parallel and series pump application are addressed. The dangers of incorrect parallel pump application are highlighted and guidelines are offered for correct application of parallel pumps. Series pump operation is discussed primarily in terms of percentage split in pumps? combined total head, pump protection and system protection. Pump Specification ? Key Elements addresses communicating to prospective pump vendors the key parameters that may determine the metallurgy, mechanical seal design and mechanical seal peripheral?s design, and pump hydraulic design best suited to the user?s requirements. The liquid specification is highlighted, the important site and operating conditions are addressed, and the importance of clearly defining the key performance requirements in full is discussed. The wrong pump, operated incorrectly coupled with poor maintenance practices, results in unsatisfactory hydraulic performance, high energy costs, high maintenance costs, poor reliability, and increases the potential for an unsafe failure. Proper specification and selection principles, coupled with the implementation of correct operating and maintenance practices, will result in optimized centrifugal pump application. The net result will be a pumping application that meets all process demands, with a minimum of energy usage, and low frequency of repair (high reliability), low overall maintenance costs, and low process debits. Key hydraulic and Performance Criteria are addressed along with their effects on performance, energy, reliability, energy, reliability, maintenance costs, and safety.

The classical one-dimensional design rules applied for decades are no longer sufficient, and for this reason, there is a strong need for more accurate numerical tools to predict the cavitation behavior of pumps. An original cavitation prediction method is presented and its results are compared to experimental data for five pumps of specific speeds from 15 to 125 (775 to 6500 US units). The numerical method introduced in this paper for the prediction for the cavitation development in pumps is a simplified version of a previously developed program successfully used in similar cases.

Cavitation erosion on the suction surface {{and in the}} hub fillet area caused this unacceptably short life. This pump design is unique in that its suction-stage operates at an inlet tip velocity of 281 ft/sec. This tip speed, coupled with a stage pressure rise of about 1160 psi places this machine well {{into the category of}} ?high energy? pumps, and signals the need for special design attention to elements of its hydraulic design in order to provide suitable performance, reliability and operability. In a joint program with the user and the pump manufacturer, the problem was investigated, a test program conducted, redesign of the impeller completed and replacement impellers commissioned in the field. Elements of the investigation and test program included the <b>impeller</b> design itself, <b>suction</b> bay distortions and effects of distorted flow generated by the upstream piping. The redesign was accomplished through the use of sophisticated computational techniques and experimental flow visualization. The final design, referred to as a biased-wedge, was manufactured using a precision, lost wax casting process, with a special stereolithographic technique used to translate the final blade design into usable patterns. One of the final set of impellers was tested using flow visualization. The test program confirmed that the final design was free of cavitation bubbles at the baseload condition and significantly reduced vapor activity and hence damage potential at min-flow. The effects of flow distortions (on cavitation activity) presented to the <b>impeller</b> by the <b>suction</b> bay (so prevalent with the conventional design) was effectively countered by the biased-wedge design. Finally, the flow distortions (both introduction of swirl and uneven mass distribution) at the pump suction flange were modeled and tested with both conventional and biased-wedge impellers. In both cases, these distortions had no effect on the formation or collapse of cavitation vapor in the impeller eye. These conclusions are valid for only this single-suction type of configuration.

40|$|Lecturepg. 13 Following a brief {{description}} of the general suction performance of pumps and starting from an impeller designed for standard requirements, it will be discussed by which modifications and up to which limit the suction performance can be improved. In this context, it will be shown that the well-known measures ? e. g., enlargement of the impeller inlet diameter, reduction of the vane number or installation of an inducer ? may result in some restrictions concerning the possible operational range and may pose a risk of cavitation erosion. These undesirable consequences can, however, be avoided or at least moderated by modifications upstream of the <b>impeller.</b> The <b>suction</b> performance can also be improved by using double suction instead of single suction pumps. It is explained why the resulting improvement may not be as substantial as could be assumed at a first glace. Pumps with inlet velocities exceeding 25 to 30 m/s that are expected to run for 10, 000 hr and more without cavitation damage cannot operate at NPSH values corresponding to a 3. 0 percent head drop, even if a highly cavitation-resistant material is used. It is demonstrated that the design parameters of their impellers differ from those used for ?normal? impellers. If NPSHA is not sufficient, a booster pump has to be provided, or the rotational speed has to be reduced. As the latter is an expensive alternative, the question arises what the minimum booster pump head is. Some information regarding this issue is given. It will also be demonstrated that there is an upper limit of the rotational speed of the main pump beyond which can economical solution is impossible...|$|R

The dynamic pressure readings were analysed for <b>suction</b> and compression <b>stages.</b> Water volume fluctuations inside the capture chamber were also recorded and compared for different inclinations. The result was an increase in the velocity of air flowing in the capture chamber and hence a rise in the kinetic energy available to the turbine.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, a reduced scale {{model of a}} {{low-pressure}} stage of a two-stage pump turbine was investigated when it operates in pump mode, which is as a centrifugal pump with vaned diffuser. An instability region was found in its Q-H curve. This instability region, centered into the flow rate interval between 0. 45 to 0. 7 QDes, restricts the stable operating range of the test pump. The object {{of this study was}} to analyze the origins and development of the unsteadiness inner pump during this saddle instability region, and to find the causes of this saddle, which could guide the design, and optimization of the test pump. Experimental and numerical approaches have been adopted to contribute the understanding on the highly complex flow interactions inside the test pump. The analyses pointed out that the instability of Q-H curve during this flow rate interval was mainly affected by the flow field unsteadiness into the diffuser. Severe flow separation occurred into the diffuser, affecting and/or affected by the unsteadiness from the impeller and return channel remarkably. Both at full and part load, due to the U shape stay vanes in the return system, a 3 -dimentional complex flow was found on the suction side of stay vane near the U turn corner. This flow caused a periodic unforced pressure disturbance with frequency St= 0. 6625 in the diffuser. A rotating stall with 5 cells into the diffuser was also highlighted by the experimental analyses and the numerical results validated that this disturbance was mainly due to the unsteady flow patterns in the return channel. With the reduction of flow rate, the location of this unsteadiness in return channel move closer to the outlet of diffuser, and the unsteadiness made the flow separation near the stay vane leading edge on the suction side more severe and it impacted the flow in diffuser flow field in a more severe way. At the same time, two types of unsteadiness were detected in the impeller in the saddle instability region. They were the flow separation with the frequency St= 0. 6625 at the <b>impeller</b> blade <b>suction</b> side and the wake-jet near the trailing edge of impeller blade with the frequency St= 0. 335, respectively. The wake-jet caused a periodic disturbance with a frequency of St= 0. 335 in diffuser as well. The experimental results indicated that it propagate circumferentially with 2 cells. At the beginning of this saddle instability, in diffuser, the intensity of the fluctuations at St= 0. 335 and St= 0. 6625 both increase with the falling flow rate. With the development of these unsteady patterns, they mixed and caused a blockage in the gap between impeller and diffuser. This blockage caused the increase of the amplitude at BPF, which has been detected both by experimental and numerical results. At the same time, the further development of the blockage weakened the intensity of the two disturbances with frequency of St= 0. 335 and St= 0. 6625 in the blockage region. The blockage fully developed near the critical flow rate of 0. 6 QDes. At this condition, the intensity of rotor and stator interaction increased and energy loss also increased which caused the drop of head and mean pressure at the exit of impeller. Furthermore, the disturbance in diffuser which caused by wake-jet of impeller lost the periodic character with frequency of St= 0. 335 at this condition. This is the reason why the non-linear component St= 0. 335 disappeared in diffuser around 0. 6 QDes...|$|R
