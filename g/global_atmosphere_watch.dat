The Mauna Loa Solar Observatory (MLSO), located at [...] on the northern slope of the mountain, has long been prominent in observations of the Sun. The NOAA Mauna Loa Observatory (MLO) is located close by. From its location well above local human-generated influences, the MLO monitors the global atmosphere, including the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide. Measurements are adjusted to account for local outgassing of CO2 from the volcano.|$|E

40|$|The Lorenz {{energy cycle}} {{is widely used}} to {{investigate}} atmospheres and climates on planets. However, the long-term temporal variations of such an energy cycle {{have not yet been}} explored. Here we use three independent meteorological data sets from the modern satellite era, to examine the temporal characteristics of the Lorenz energy cycle of Earth’s <b>global</b> <b>atmosphere</b> in response to climate change. The total mechanical energy of the <b>global</b> <b>atmosphere</b> basically remains constant with time, but the global-average eddy energies show significant positive trends. The spatial investigations suggest that these positive trends are concentrated in the Southern Hemisphere. Significant positive trends are also found in the conversion, generation and dissipation rates of energies. The positive trends in the dissipation rates of kinetic energies suggest that the efficiency of the <b>global</b> <b>atmosphere</b> as a heat engine increased during the modern satellite era...|$|R
