25|$|A simpler system, {{developed}} later, uses a {{concave disc}} (or {{a pair of}} them) set at a large angle to the direction of progress, that uses the concave shape to hold the disc into the soil– unless something hard strikes the circumference of the disk, causing it to roll {{up and over the}} obstruction. As the arrangement is dragged forward, the sharp edge of the disc cuts the soil, and the concave surface of the rotating disc lifts and throws the soil to the side. It doesn't make as good a job as the mouldboard plough (but this is not considered a disadvantage, because it helps fight wind erosion), but it does lift and break up the soil (see <b>disc</b> <b>harrow).</b>|$|E
50|$|A discer is an evolved {{form of a}} <b>disc</b> <b>harrow,</b> more {{suitable}} to Saskatchewan prairies, where it {{was developed in the}} 1940s. It does not leave ridging and it is lighter to pull, so it can be made bigger. After the 1980s their domination started to fade.|$|E

5000|$|Before {{invention}} of the modern tractor, <b>disc</b> <b>harrows</b> typically consisted of two sections, which were horse-drawn and had no hydraulic power. These harrows were often adjustable so that the discs could be changed from their offset position. Straightening the discs allowed for transport without ripping up the ground; also, they were not as difficult to pull. Overuse of <b>disc</b> <b>harrows</b> in the High Plains of the United States in the early 20th century {{may have contributed to}} the [...] "Dust Bowl".|$|R
50|$|Modern <b>disc</b> <b>harrows</b> are tractor-driven and {{are raised}} either by a three-point lift or {{hydraulically}} by wheels.

5000|$|It is also common, {{at least}} in the United States, to {{consider}} [...] to be a separate class of implement from <b>discs</b> (<b>disc</b> <b>harrows).</b> The first is a true plow, which does primary tillage and leaves behind a rough surface, whereas the second is a secondary tillage tool.|$|R

50|$|Primary {{heavy duty}} disc harrows of 265 to 1000 lbs per disc are mainly used {{to break up}} virgin land, to chop material/residue, and to {{incorporate}} it into the top soil. Lighter secondary disc harrows help completely incorporate residue left by a primary <b>disc</b> <b>harrow,</b> eliminate clumps, and loosen the remaining packed soil. The notched disc blades chop up stover left from a previous crops, such as cornstalks. Disc harrows incorporate remaining residue into the top soil, promoting the rapid decay of the dead plant material. Applying fertilizer onto residue {{on the surface of}} the soil results in much of the applied nitrogen being tied up by residual plant material; therefore it is not available to germinating seeds. Disc harrows are also generally used prior to plowing in order to make the land easier to manage and work after plowing. Applying a <b>disc</b> <b>harrow</b> before plowing can also reduce clogging and allow more complete turning of the soil during plowing.|$|E
50|$|The disc {{for cooking}} the meats {{is usually a}} <b>disc</b> <b>harrow</b> made of either iron or steel. Shaped like a Chinese Wok, the disc {{provides}} an even heat distribution ideal for cooking. The cast iron also provides a robust, earthy flavor to food cooked in this fashion. The original concave disc shape is unaltered, however the disc can have handles or a tripod welded to it for easy access.|$|E
50|$|A <b>disc</b> <b>harrow</b> is the {{preferred}} method of incorporating both agricultural lime (either dolomitic or calcitic lime) and agricultural gypsum, and disc harrowing achieves a 50/50 mix with the soil when set correctly, thereby reducing acid saturation in the top soil and so promoting strong, healthy root development. Lime does not move in the soil, and this poses a critical challenge to sustainable zero-till farming, especially considering that chemical fertilizers are generally used by farmers around the world.|$|E

50|$|There {{are four}} general types of harrows: <b>disc</b> <b>harrows,</b> tine harrows (including spring-tooth harrows, drag harrows, and spike harrows), chain harrows, and chain-disk harrows. Harrows were {{originally}} drawn by draft animals, such as horses, mules, or oxen, {{or in some}} times and places by manual labourers. In modern practice they are almost always tractor-mounted implements, either trailed after the tractor by a drawbar or mounted on the three-point hitch.|$|R
40|$|A {{three years}} {{research}} project {{was developed to}} study tractor-implement dynamics in tillage operations. This paper reports the results of field tests performed under real working conditions, using four wheel drive tractors and trailed <b>disc</b> <b>harrows</b> combinations, under different soils conditions. The data show a linear relationship between the drawbar pull per unit of implement width and the fuel consumption ha- 1. The results give evidence {{of the benefits of}} the “gear up, throttle down” approach...|$|R

50|$|In cooler climates {{the most}} common types are the <b>disc</b> <b>harrow,</b> the chain harrow, the tine harrow or spike harrow and the spring tine harrow. Chain harrows are often used for lighter work such as {{levelling}} the tilth or covering seed, while disc harrows are typically used for heavy work, such as following ploughing {{to break up the}} sod. In addition, there are various types of power harrow, in which the cultivators are power-driven from the tractor rather than depending on its forward motion.|$|E
50|$|The {{drag harrow}} {{is not often}} used in modern farming as other harrows {{have proven to be}} more suitable, such as the <b>disc</b> <b>harrow.</b> Another reason they are not often used is because they cannot be {{controlled}} hydraulically, meaning that the operator is required to dismount from the tractor to adjust it or unclog it. However it is used as a drag behind several other implements such as a rod weeder. Due to their low cost and simplicity, drag harrows are still used widely by small farmers.|$|E

40|$|Soil working {{operations}} in conventional farming systems involving {{the use of}} the tractor are some of the operations which incur the highest energy costs. The sustainability of such systems requires a strictly-controlled management of resources leading to a significant reduction in crop-production costs derived from savings in fuel consumption. The configuration of the tractor-harrow combination, based on the measurement of the draught required under operational conditions provides the manufacturers with a reliable indication of the recommended power required for each model of harrow produced. With this type of information farmers can take decisions regarding the selection of a suitable tractor-implement combination for their farms. As a consequence there is improved tractor-harrow productivity and field efficiency. This study centred on the validation of the mathematical models used to estimate the draught of <b>disc</b> <b>harrows</b> in medium textured soils presented by ASABE. A three-year research project was developed to study tractor-implement dynamics in tillage operations. The field tests were performed under real working conditions, using more than twenty four-wheel-drive tractors and trailed <b>disc</b> <b>harrows</b> combinations, in different soil types. The tractors were instrumented and the measured parameters were: forward speed, slip, engine speed, draught and fuel consumption per hour. The tractors were also submitted to dynamometer tests for measuring PTO power and speed and the engine fuel consumption per hour. The results allow {{led to the development of}} a quadratic equation that corresponds to an adaptation of the linear model of ASABE to estimate the draught of the <b>disc</b> <b>harrows</b> in undisturbed loamy soils, not only as a function of implement mass and soil type, but also as a function of speed, working depth and soil conditions. Under these conditions, a ratio of tractor power to implement width of 25 to 33 kW m- 1 is suggested. The data also show the existence of a linear relationship between the fuel consumption per hectare and the specific draught, for the range of 4 to 9 kN m- 1, valid for dry, undisturbed loamy soils...|$|R
50|$|A drag harrow, {{a type of}} spring-tooth harrow, is {{a largely}} {{outdated}} type of soil cultivation implement {{that is used to}} smooth the ground as well as loosen it after it has been plowed and packed. It uses many flexible iron teeth usually arranged into three rows. It has no hydraulic functionality and has to be raised/adjusted with one or multiple manual levers. It is a largely outdated piece of farm equipment, having been replaced by more modern <b>disc</b> <b>harrows</b> and hydraulically operated field cultivators.|$|R

50|$|In the United States, {{the first}} boring machine {{to have been}} built was used in 1853 during the {{construction}} of the Hoosac Tunnel. Made of cast iron, it was known as Wilson's Patented Stone-Cutting Machine, after inventor Charles Wilson. It drilled 10 feet into the rock before breaking down. (The tunnel was eventually completed more than 20 years later, and as with the Fréjus Rail Tunnel, by using less ambitious methods.) Wilson's machine anticipated modern TBMs {{in the sense that it}} employed cutting discs, like those of a <b>disc</b> <b>harrow,</b> which were attached to the rotating head of the machine. In contrast to traditional chiseling or drilling and blasting, this innovative method of removing rock relied on simple metal wheels to apply a transient high pressure that fractured the rock.|$|E
50|$|On {{smaller and}} older planters, a marker extends {{out to the}} side half the width of the planter and creates a line in the field where the tractor should be {{centered}} for the next pass. The marker is usually a single <b>disc</b> <b>harrow</b> disc on a rod {{on each side of the}} planter. On larger and more modern planters, GPS navigation and auto-steer systems for the tractor are often used, eliminating the need for the marker. Some precision farming equipment such as Case IH AFS uses GPS/RKS and computer-controlled planter to sow seeds to precise position accurate within 2 cm. In an irregularly shaped field, the precision farming equipment will automatically hold the seed release over area already sewn when the tractor has to run overlapping pattern to avoid obstacles such as trees.|$|E
50|$|A {{subsoiler}} or flat lifter is a tractor-mounted {{farm implement}} used for deep tillage, loosening and breaking up soil at depths below the levels worked by moldboard ploughs, <b>disc</b> <b>harrows,</b> or rototillers. Most such tools will break up and turn over surface soil {{to a depth}} of 15-20 cm (6-8 in), whereas a subsoiler will break up and loosen soil to twice those depths. Typically a subsoiler mounted on a compact utility tractor will reach depths of about 30 cm (12 in) and typically have only one thin blade with a sharpened tip.|$|R
50|$|A {{drag harrow}} more {{specifically}} {{refers to a}} largely outdated type of soil cultivation implement {{that is used to}} smooth the ground as well as loosen it after it has been plowed and packed. It uses many flexible iron teeth usually arranged into three rows. It has no hydraulic functionality and has to be raised/adjusted with one or multiple manual levers. It is a largely outdated piece of farm equipment, having been replaced by more modern <b>disc</b> <b>harrows</b> and deeper, stiff-toothed rippers, however, smaller farmers still use them.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{southern}} hemisphere, so-called giant discs are a specialised kind of <b>disc</b> <b>harrows</b> that can {{stand in for}} a plough in rough country where a mouldboard plough cannot handle tree-stumps and rocks, and a disc-plough is too slow (because of its limited number of discs). Giant scalloped-edged discs operate in a set, or frame, that is often weighted with concrete or steel blocks to improve penetration of the cutting edges. This sort of cultivation is usually followed by broadcast fertilisation and seeding, rather than drilled or row seeding.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>disc</b> <b>harrow</b> is a farm {{implement}} {{that is used}} to till the soil where crops are to be planted. It is also used to chop up unwanted weeds or crop remainders. It consists of many carbon steel and sometimes the longer-lasting boron discs, which have many varying [...] and disc blade sizes and spacing (the choices of the later being determined by the final result required in a given soil type) and which are arranged into two sections ("offset disc harrow") or four sections ("tandem disc harrow"). When viewed from above, the four sections would appear to form an [...] "X" [...] which has been flattened to be wider than it is tall. The discs are also [...] so that they are not parallel with the overall direction of the implement. This arrangement ensures that the discs will repeatedly slice any ground to which they are applied, in order to optimize the result. The concavity of the discs as well as their offset angle causes them to loosen and lift the soil that they cut.|$|E
5000|$|The {{heavy duty}} disc with large {{diameter}} disc blades of 26", 28", 30", 32", 36", and 40", and with increased disc spacings of 10", 14", and 18" [...] {{are the primary}} tillage tools {{that are used to}} break virgin ground, to incorporate residue into the soil in preparation for a ripper / subsoiler, and to break up a compacted soil in order to increase soil aeration and to promote soil permeability in lower levels of the soil profile. Prior to a planting operation, a secondary <b>disc</b> <b>harrow</b> with narrow disc spacing of 8", 9", and even 10" [...] with disc sizes ranging from 20", 22", 24", to 26" [...] can be used. Other similar secondary tillage tine implements or rotary harrows are also widely used. When choosing secondary tillage equipment, soil type as well as soil moisture content at the time must be considered. Lighter secondary disc harrows are primarily used to break down soil clods into smaller pieces. By so doing, water penetrates more easily into the soil, soil aeration is increased, and the activity of soil biota is enhanced; the final result is a seed bed that is suitable for planting.|$|E

In March 1970 the Massey Ferguson 165 Tractor With Saw Attachment (73) was issued featuring a clever circular saw attachment which rotated as the model was pushed along by means of a long finely coiled spring. Next followed two versions of the Ford 5000 Super Major tractor with a fully operational side trenching scoop (74) in 1970 followed by a version with a rear trenching scoop (72) in January 1971. The next new tractor model was issued in April 1973. The Massey Ferguson MF50B (50) featured a closed cab and was finished in yellow. A version with an operational shovel (54) was released in April 1974 and was featured with a trailer carrying a load of plastic 'hay' with figures sitting atop the 'hay' as the latest version of the Agricultural Gift Set (GS4) in July 1974. Another new tractor was added to the range in September 1976. The David Brown Tractor and Trailer Set (GS34) included the new tractor finished in white and with a closed cab and a tipping trailer. These models were also featured in another version of the Agricultural Gift Set (GS42) released in March 1978, along with models of a grain elevator and grain silo.
