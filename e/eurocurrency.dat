40|$|This paper {{addresses}} why {{the relatively}} unknown island of Jersey {{emerged as a}} major Offshore Finance Centre (OFC) during the 1960 s. Was the OFC purely {{the result of the}} context of the 1960 s and the significant changes in international banking, especially in London? In other words, was Jersey just a child of its times or was there more involved? 	Orthodox international banking theory would suggest that the location of OFCs is based upon issues of taxation or regulatory differentials, bank secrecy and political stability. However, this paper uses a materialist, fractions of capital approach to analyse the political economy of the onshore state and its specific relationship to its dependent island territories. This paradoxical political relationship underpins the feasibility of OFCs. Arguably, UK financial capital had reached hegemony by the 1960 s, giving it the effective regulatory and fiscal 'space' for banking innovation as first manifested in the London offshore currency markets (<b>Eurocurrencies),</b> and then later in the concomitant emergence of small island OFCs such as Jersey. ...|$|R
40|$|Australia has {{suffered}} {{in line with}} other nations from the recession of the 1970 s. Behind the downturn lay a major structural change in the economies of Western Nations; a change which resulted from the movement from a system of monopoly capitalism to one of global capitalism. Much {{attention has been paid}} to the rise of multinational manufacturing corporations in this process; relatively little to the fundamental revision of the world's capital markets. The process of change began with the shortcomings of the Bretton Woods system and the rise of the <b>Eurocurrencies.</b> A vast and undisciplined international capital market was created, the hallmarks of which were highly volatile exchange rates and a greatly expanded pool of capital which was very mobile. The power of individual governments to control the system was reduced, and the new system was organized through a group of key global cities which operated the market throughout the world on a twenty-four-hour basis. A fourfold hierarchy of centres evolved. In Australia there was an historic transition from the dominance of Melbourne to that of Sydney as a result of the changing world scene. The growth of the international markets had produced a revolution in the distribution of wealth and activities throughout the world. The problems resulting from this have called for a regulatory body to control the new system. The prospects for creating such a body are clouded by the scale of the problem and by the lack of understanding of its causes. The result is an indecisive and probably wrongly directed approach to the question of regional development. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{the global}} capital market, {{as one of}} the most dynamic aspects of the world economy. Once the dollars have begun to circulate outside the US, the expansion of transnational banking could not be curtailed. In addition to <b>Eurocurrencies,</b> other external financial markets were created, providing a global structure for the whole range of instruments to be traded. Economic and political changes in the late 1970 s and in the beginning of the 1980 s contributed to a shift in financial logic of both intermediaries and investors: from credit markets, they have increasingly turned to securities. Computer banking networks spanned the globe and provided almost an instantaneousa ccesst o every corner of the world of finance. So, in the mid- 1980 s, a truly global capital market came into being. Global financial structure sent critical signals on several occasions, regarding its over-all stability and soundness. Regulation of such global structure has attracted immense attention world-wide, as cross-border capital flows epitomize basic dilemmae about the concept of market economy: to what extent efficiency-gains justify loose market regulation, or, to put it the other way, to what degree the regulation could be tightened (i. e. market stability over-emphasized) to avoid hampering efficiency. These questions have indeed become political choices, provoking hot debates on both the national and the international level. The International Relations' approach to the global environment has proved to be a necessary enlargement of classical economic analysis today. In this particular case, the Issue-Based paradigm and regime theory were the most appropriate analytical frameworks to be applied. The hyper-issue of an orderly market economy v. a socialist command economy links the issues like international control, capital rules, liberalization and market integrity. A wider policy-system for global capital flows has emerged, featuring many and diverse actors. Although priorities vary to a great extent, it can be concluded that the multi-centric structure emphasizes the values of efficiency and freedom, while the intergovernmental world still highlights the maintenance of order and stability. Although regime theory has provided a valuable framework for this analysis, it still fails to reflect changing reality of modern financial structures. Instead of concentrating exclusively on governmental actors and the intergovernmental world, regime theory should also be applied on processes which are going on in the other, multicentric world. For the time being, an intergovernmental regime for global capital market is beyond the reach. Contrary to that, a transnational, nongovernmental regime for capital flows has begun to emerge...|$|R

5000|$|Eurocredits are short-to-medium-term loans of <b>Eurocurrency</b> {{extended}} by Eurobanks to corporations, sovereign governments, nonprime banks, or international organizations. The loans are denominated in currencies {{other than the}} home currency of the Eurobank. Because these loans are frequently too large for a single bank to handle, Eurobanks will band {{together to form a}} bank lending syndicate to share the risk.The credit risk on these loans is greater than on loans to other banks in the interbank market. Thus, the interest rate on Eurocredits must compensate the bank, or banking syndicate, for the added credit risk. On Eurocredits originating in London the base lending rate is LIBOR. The lending rate on these credits is stated as LIBOR +X percent, where X is the lending margin charged depending upon the creditworthiness of the borrower. Additionally, rollover pricing was created on Eurocredits so that Eurobanks do not end up paying more on <b>Eurocurrency</b> time deposits than they earn from the loans. Thus, a Eurocredit may be viewed as a series of short-term loans, where {{at the end of each}} time period (generally three or six months), the loan is rolled over and the base lending rate is repriced to current LIBOR over the next time interval of the loan.|$|E

Second, our evidence reveals that short- and long-term <b>Eurocurrency</b> rate series have the same volatility process. the results point out that a common time-varying volatility process characterises most <b>Eurocurrency</b> rate series across maturities and currency denominations.

40|$|An {{attempt is}} made to create a model of {{exchange}} rates that explains the short term, daily levels of the foreign exchange spot market. The model is a monetary type {{that focuses on the}} <b>eurocurrency</b> markets and the current account. It has a liquidity preference form and employs daily data. The futures rate, the euro interest rate, the <b>eurocurrency</b> money stocks and a current account variable are the individual variables of the model. The futures rate and the euro interest rates are from the assumed Fisher's 'Covered Interest Rate Paradigm'. The <b>eurocurrency</b> money stock variable's justification is based on the real world structure of the spot market where the foreign exchange desks of the major world commercial banks are the dominant players. The current account variable, which is motivated by a desire to improve on the short run performance of the Purchasing Power Parity variable of other monetary models, is justified by trade theory. The liquidity preference form of the model is in keeping with current monetary models. The econometric results show that the model is better than the random walk model. However the results of the individual variables are mixed. The futures rate accounts {{for the vast majority of}} the model's success. Although the <b>eurocurrency</b> variable is as statistically significant as the interest rate differentials from the widely accepted Fisher's Covered Interest Rate Parity paradigm, neither was as significant as the futures rate. The current account variable results are not statistically significant. Thus, the current account variable may be discarded while the <b>eurocurrency</b> interest rates and euromoney variables warrant further study. As a result of the dominance of the futures rate variable, models that cry to capture rational expectations such as the News or Chaos Models are appealing. This rational expectations characteristic of the market combined with the dominance of speculation over economic fundamentals also points toward game theory as a good candidate for further study...|$|E
40|$|BELL, Graham Douglas, M. Com. University of the Witwatersrand, 1985. This {{dissertation}} {{studies the}} development and operation, advantages and {{problems associated with the}} <b>Eurocurrency</b> market. It also considers the parallel emergence of the United States dollar as the primary international vehicle currency. A well-developed international money market with easy access to a widely accepted international numeric is deemed desirable because it reduces the costs of international financial transactions and facilitates international capital mobility. Two major criticisms are that the <b>Eurocurrency</b> market contributes to international inflation and that Euro banks have been imprudent in lending to developing countries. The thesis concludes that the conventional credit multiplier model is not appropriate in studying the market but that there is, however, some inflationary potential. As for imprudent Euro bank lending, some blame adheres to the bankers but extensive international controls are ruled out. Finally, the advent of floating exchange rates in the 1970 s and uncertainty surrounding United States economic policy has led to considerable uncertainty in international financial markets. This has been aggravated by volatile short-term international capital flows fuelled by the efficient <b>Eurocurrency</b> market. In such an environment South Africa has experienced considerable oscillations in the price of gold, its major export, and has embarked on a programme to establish a flexible foreign exchange market.

Further evidence does not provide support {{for the presence of}} a systematic risk premium on forward rates. The findings of this study suggest also that the <b>Eurocurrency</b> market is efficient in incorporating information contained in the history of interest rates into the forward rate. In addition, this paper shows that, in conformity with the efficient market hypothesis, errors of prediction based on forward rates are not related to past changes of interest rates. © 1982 JIBS.

40|$|To {{manage their}} reserve positions, {{depository}} {{institutions in the}} United States actively buy and sell deposits at the Federal Reserve Banks via the federal funds market. Beginning in 1991, the Eurodollar market also became an attractive venue for trading deposits at the Federal Reserve Banks. Prior to 1991, the Federal Reserve’s statutory reserve requirement on <b>Eurocurrency</b> liabilities of U. S. banking offices discouraged use of <b>Eurocurrency</b> liabilities {{as a vehicle for}} trading deposits at the Federal Reserve. This impediment was removed in December 1990. Beginning in January 1991, the overnight instruments in the federal funds market and in the Eurodollar markets, except for minor differences in risk, became similar vehicles for exchanging deposits at Federal Reserve Banks. Because the risk characteristics of the instruments differ, the law of one price need not hold precisely across the two markets. Yet, the authors hypothesize that, beginning in 1991, the two trading instruments became close enough substitutes that price pressures in one market began to show through to the other. Herein, the authors examine overnight LIBOR for U. S. bank settlement effects. During the period when the federal funds market and Eurodollar markets are similar venues for trading deposits at Federal Reserve Banks, they find strong settlement effects in overnight LIBOR. However, during the period when <b>Eurocurrency</b> liabilities carry a reserve tax, they find no evidence of a settlement effect in overnight LIBOR. Their results suggest that (i) the microstructure of the federal funds market spills over into the markets for substitute assets and (ii) Federal Reserve rules have implications beyond U. S. borders.
