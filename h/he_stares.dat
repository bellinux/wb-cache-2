Mulder finds Scully's necklace in Tooms' apartment and tries to call his partner, but her phone line has been cut.

Tooms is put in an institution for the criminally insane where he begins to build another nest using newspaper. At the institution, Scully informs Mulder that medical tests on Tooms show an abnormal skeletal and muscle system, and a rapidly declining metabolism.

5|$|On patrol, Riley notices {{shadows in}} the belfry and goes to investigate. Buffy finds two of The Gentlemen's minions, kills one and runs after the other. Riley fights {{his way into the}} belfry and while he's embattled, Buffy crashes through a window, fighting. He turns to attack and finds himself face to face with Buffy. She fights while <b>he</b> <b>stares,</b> unmoving. When a minion pins her down she sees and recognizes the box from her dream and gesticulates wildly for Riley to destroy it. When he does so, the stolen voices escape. Buffy screams until the heads of The Gentlemen and their minions explode.|$|E
25|$|The possessed Jed {{goes into}} cardiac arrest. Before he dies, <b>he</b> <b>stares</b> {{directly}} at Sister Mary Eunice. She is flung backwards, knocking her unconscious. The next day, Dr. Arden visits her, concerned, though he eyes her scantily-clothed body. When she awakens, {{he tells her}} he is embarrassed seeing {{her out of her}} habit. She apologizes and covers up with a sheet, saying that she feels comfortable around him. When he leaves, she throws the blanket off, mysteriously shaking a crucifix on the wall.|$|E
60|$|Komba {{was much}} impressed. <b>He</b> returned; <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> {{at the dead}} {{rhinoceros}} and at the hole in its throat; <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> at me; <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> at the still smoking rifle.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> heard, <b>he</b> <b>stared,</b> <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> again, {{then lifted}} his thin hand and stroked her hair.|$|R
60|$|Then {{she stopped}} short, for Peter's eyes were staring more roundly than usual {{and the hand}} that fumbled at his locket trembled visibly. <b>He</b> <b>stared</b> at Aunt Hannah, <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> at Irene; {{but most of all}} <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> at Mary Louise, who seemed to sense from his manner some {{impending}} misfortune.|$|R
500|$|Scotty is revived as a demon {{and attacks}} Ash {{when he goes}} back upstairs, while Cheryl savagely beats him with a {{fireplace}} poker. Ash gets {{his hands on the}} book with Linda's necklace, and throws it into the fireplace. As the book burns, Scotty and Cheryl begin to gruesomely decompose and their blood sprays all over Ash as <b>he</b> <b>stares</b> in horror and disgust. After Scotty and Cheryl are dead, Ash hears the voice of the demons telling him [...] "Join Us". As the voice dies away as well, Ash grabs Linda's necklace in gratitude.|$|E
500|$|Later, Scully {{is sitting}} by Mulder's bedside when he regains consciousness. <b>He</b> <b>stares</b> blankly at Scully, and asks [...] "Who are you?" [...] At first, Scully thinks that Mulder does not {{remember}} her. However, she quickly {{realizes that he}} is actually playing a practical joke. They laugh, and Mulder asks, [...] "Did anybody miss me?" [...] Scully responds with tears. Later at the FBI, Kersh expresses his disappointment that Doggett did not take his advice to abandon Mulder's case and rescinds his offer to promote him. He indicates that {{he will continue to}} work on The X-Files with Scully and Mulder.|$|E
2500|$|Davis {{showed little}} {{interest}} in the film Now, Voyager (1942) until Hal Wallis advised her that female audiences needed romantic dramas to distract them from the reality of their lives. It became one of the best known of her [...] "women's pictures". In one of the film's most imitated scenes, Paul Henreid lights two cigarettes as <b>he</b> <b>stares</b> into Davis' eyes and passes one to her. Film reviewers complimented Davis on her performance, the National Board of Review commenting that she gave the film [...] "a dignity not fully warranted by the script." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>stared.</b> <b>He</b> gesticulated. Once {{or twice}} he shouted and applauded.|$|R
60|$|The rancher gave a start, and <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> as <b>he</b> had <b>stared</b> before, fixedly and perplexedly at Wade.|$|R
6000|$|And <b>he</b> <b>stared!</b> <b>He</b> <b>stared,</b> {{forgetting to}} move, almost awed, almost sorry. But for {{nothing in the}} world would he have had it undone. Such a shot!--such a shot! Rolled over on his back and died! ...|$|R
2500|$|Chicago Sun-Times film critic, Roger Ebert, was {{especially}} complimentary {{of the film}} and of actor Joe Pesci, and wrote, [...] "One {{of the best things}} about the movie is the way it shows us how seriously Bernzy takes his work. He doesn't talk about it. He does it, with that cigar stuck in his mug, leading the way with the big, ungainly Speed Graphic with the glass flashbulbs. In the movie's big scene of a mob assassination, <b>he</b> <b>stares</b> death in the face to get a great picture." [...] Ebert said the film made him [...] "think" [...] a little bit of Casablanca (1942).|$|E
2500|$|Ennis {{travels to}} meet with Jack's mother and father, and offers to take Jack's ashes to the mountain. The father refuses, preferring to have them interred in a family plot. Permitted by Jack's mother to see his {{childhood}} bedroom, Ennis finds the bloodstained shirt {{he thought he had}} lost on Brokeback Mountain. He discovers Jack kept it hanging with his own stained shirt from that summer's fight. Ennis holds both shirts up to his face, silently weeping. Jack's mother lets him keep the shirts. Later, 19-year-old Alma Jr. arrives at Ennis' trailer to tell her father she is engaged. She asks for his blessing and invites him to the wedding. Ennis asks her if her fianc√© really loves her and she replies [...] "yes". After Alma leaves, Ennis goes to his closet, where his and Jack's shirts hang together, with a postcard of Brokeback Mountain tacked above. <b>He</b> <b>stares</b> at the ensemble for a moment, tears in his eyes, and murmurs, [...] "Jack, I swear..." ...|$|E
2500|$|The most {{significant}} {{difference from the}} original play concerned the character of Young Lucius, who {{is a much more}} important figure in the adaptation; he is present throughout Act 1, and retrieves the murder weapon after the death of Mutius; it is his knife which Titus uses to kill the fly; he aids in the capture of Chiron and Demetrius; he is present throughout the final scene. Much as Julie Taymor would do in her 1999 filmic adaptation, Howell set Young Lucius as the centre of the production to prompt the question [...] "What are we doing to the children?" [...] At the end of the play, as Lucius delivers his final speech, the camera stays on Young Lucius rather than his father, who is in the far background and out of focus, as <b>he</b> <b>stares</b> in horror at the coffin of Aaron's child (which has been killed off-screen). Thus the production became [...] "in part about a boy's reaction to murder and mutilation. We see him losing his innocence and being drawn into this adventure of revenge; yet, at the end we perceive that he retains the capacity for compassion and sympathy." ...|$|E
60|$|James {{scarcely}} heard; <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> at the floor, brooding sorrowfully.|$|R
60|$|Kells's {{radiance}} fled, {{leaving him}} ghastly. <b>He</b> <b>stared</b> at Oliver.|$|R

2500|$|Constable Karen Pelly (Tara Spencer-Nairn) is Dog River's ambitious, {{sometimes}} neurotic junior police officer. Before {{becoming a}} police officer, she ranked fifth in Canada {{in the sport}} of static apnea, with a personal best of more than six minutes. She's a very good cook, but does not like {{to bring it up}} for fear it will stereotype her. She does not want to admit that she does not know how to ride a bike. She is also at least 10 years younger than most of the other characters, turning 30 in the sixth season. Karen possesses a variety of skills including cooking, martial arts, drums, drawing, and table hockey; but when she wins a raffle in the sixth season, she says it's the first time she ever won anything. She tends to take her police position very seriously, unlike her partner Davis, and treats even the most minor problem officially. On one occasion, when she mentions to Davis that she feels she has a good lead on a cold case, <b>he</b> <b>stares</b> at her dumbfounded and asks [...] "Why?" [...] Karen frequently becomes annoyed with Davis' willingness to obey the mayor in everything and bend rules. They differ greatly on their views of what a police officer should portray; on one occasion, Karen states that [...] "a police officer should be respected by the community", to which Davis casually replies [...] "Who said that?" [...] Many episodes see them engaged in petty disputes and going to great lengths to one-up each other. Despite their differences, Karen and Davis get along well although they don't spend much time together outside of work. In the episode [...] "Hook, Line and Sinker" [...] Karen goes fishing with Hank and is seduced by his [...] "sexy fish talk". After the end of the series, she falls in love and marries; in , Karen's husband {{is said to be a}} soldier stationed off the Mediterranean coast, and they are expecting their first child.|$|E

60|$|It was the general-in-chief. <b>He</b> <b>stared</b> at me, {{but said}} nothing.|$|R

6000|$|... (His mistake surprises her, {{but she is}} in a wild {{mood and}} curtsies, then turns away and smiles. <b>He</b> <b>stares</b> as if half-convinced.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... [Then, motionless, <b>he</b> <b>stares</b> {{down at his}} brother's open, [...] sightless eyes. Suddenly he wets {{his finger}} and holds it to the [...] girl's lips, then to LARRY'S.] ...|$|E
60|$|BURGOYNE (rising in amazement). Satisfactory, sir! Satisfactory!! (<b>He</b> <b>stares</b> {{at him for}} a moment, {{and then}} adds, with grim intensity) I am glad you take that view of them.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>stared</b> at {{her with}} his round eyes, playing with his locket.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>stared</b> in amazement; then {{scratched}} his ear with a puzzled air.|$|R
60|$|She {{spoke with}} girlish shyness, which {{increased}} as <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> at her.|$|R
60|$|TANNER. You {{can explain}} that if anybody calls you to account, here or hereafter. [He turns away, and plants {{himself in front}} of Mr Herbert Spencer, at whom <b>he</b> <b>stares</b> gloomily].|$|E
6000|$|... "He raves, alas!" [...] said Catharine. [...] "Haste to call some help. He {{will not}} harm me; but I fear {{he will do}} evil to himself. See how <b>he</b> <b>stares</b> down on the roaring waterfall!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{ever thought}} him such a treasure!" [...] said Gillian; [...] "and {{now look at}} him as he stands by the side of a real gentleman, how <b>he</b> <b>stares</b> and trembles as if he were distraught." ...|$|E
60|$|For {{a moment}} Hare did not understand. <b>He</b> <b>stared</b> at her unbelievingly.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>stared</b> at {{her from}} doorways, and glared {{at her from}} {{passages}} as she went about with her partners; and the more <b>he</b> <b>stared,</b> the more taken was he. He could scarcely {{believe that this was}} the woman with the red eyes and the black stuff gown who used to weep over the eggs at breakfast.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>stared</b> at her, {{trying to}} {{guess at the}} mystery of her thoughts.|$|R
