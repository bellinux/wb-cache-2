25|$|The {{common emitter}} (or common source, common cathode, etc.) {{is most often}} {{configured}} to provide amplification of a voltage applied between base and emitter, and the output signal taken between collector and emitter is inverted, relative to the input. The common collector arrangement applies the input voltage between base and collector, and to take the output voltage between emitter and collector. This causes negative feedback, and the output voltage tends to follow the input voltage. This arrangement is also used as the input presents a high impedance and does not load the signal source, though the voltage amplification is less than one. The common-collector circuit is, therefore, better known as an <b>emitter</b> <b>follower,</b> source follower, or cathode follower.|$|E

2500|$|Another way to {{classify}} amplifiers {{is by the}} phase relationship of the input signal to the output signal. [...] An 'inverting' amplifier produces an output 180 degrees out of phase with the input signal (that is, a polarity inversion or {{mirror image of the}} input as seen on an oscilloscope). A 'non-inverting' amplifier maintains the phase of the input signal waveforms. An <b>emitter</b> <b>follower</b> is a type of non-inverting amplifier, indicating that the signal at the emitter of a transistor is following (that is, matching with unity gain but perhaps an offset) the input signal. Voltage follower is also non inverting type of amplifier having unity gain.|$|E

40|$|Sometimes, {{the need}} arises for a low-distortion buffer {{amplifier}} {{capable of handling}} bipolar signals. You can use an op amp or integrated buffer for these applications, but for more flexibility, a discrete design may prove useful. Applications include buffering the input of an ADC or the output of a DAC, or an audio line driver. The buffer in Figure 1 provides unity gain, low output impedance, and low distortion. It uses two <b>emitter</b> <b>followers</b> configured as symmetrical class-A amplifiers; current sources replace the usual emitter resistors (Figure 2).

50|$|Increased {{impedance}} {{is implemented}} by a non-inverting amplifier with gain of 0 < Av < 1. The (magnitude of) output voltage {{is less than}} the input voltage Vi and partially neutralizes it.

50|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 1960s, ECL {{circuits}} were implemented on monolithic integrated circuits and consisted of a differential amplifier input stage to perform logic and followed by an <b>emitter</b> <b>follower</b> stage to drive outputs and shift the output voltages so they will be compatible with the inputs.

5000|$|At {{common mode}} (the two input {{voltages}} {{change in the}} same directions), the two voltage (<b>emitter)</b> <b>followers</b> cooperate with each other working together on the common high-resistive emitter load (the [...] "long tail"). They all together increase or decrease the voltage of the common emitter point (figuratively speaking, they together [...] "pull up" [...] or [...] "pull down" [...] {{it so that it}} moves). In addition, the dynamic load [...] "helps" [...] them by changing its instant ohmic resistance {{in the same direction as}} the input voltages (it increases when the voltage increases and vice versa.) thus keeping up constant total resistance between the two supply rails. There is a full (100%) negative feedback; the two input base voltages and the emitter voltage change simultaneously while the collector currents and the total current do not change. As a result, the output collector voltages do not change as well.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — An {{ultra-low}} power static {{frequency divider}} {{with a maximum}} clock frequency> 61 GHz was designed and fabricated into a 500 nm InP/In 0. 53 Ga 47 As/InP double heterojunction bipolar transistor (DHBT) technology utiliz-ing a collector pedestal process for reduced base-collector capacitanceCcb. This is the first reported digital circuit in this material system employing such Ccb reduction techniques. The divider operation is fully static, operating from fclk = 4 GHz to 61. 2 GHz while dissipating ≤ 27. 1 mW {{of power in the}} flip-flop from a single- 2. 30 V supply. The power-delay product of this circuit is 113. 0 fJ/latch if all devices in the latch are considered, and 63. 2 fJ/latch if the power associated with the voltage level-shifting <b>emitter</b> <b>followers</b> is not included in the power-delay calculation. By either method of calculation, this is a record low power-delay product for an InP DHBT-based static frequency divider; more than 2 × lower than has been previously reported.
