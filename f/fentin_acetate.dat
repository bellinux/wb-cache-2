From two Dutch soil types the upper 1. 10 m below soil surface {{was placed in}} stainless steel columns. The columns were treated with <b>fentin</b> <b>acetate</b> and leached during one year. An artificial water table was maintained at 1 metre depth. Separately batch sorption and transformation experiments were performed. Soils and soil leachates were analysed for tri-, di- and mono-phynyl-tin compounds. Very high sorption constants were found for <b>fentin</b> <b>acetate</b> or its first transformation product fentin hydroxide. The fungicide is, therefore, practically immobile in both soils. Above mentioned transformation products were found in both the transformation and the soil column experiments. Half-life values for the combined phenyl-tin residues {{were found to be}} 59 to 140 days depending on the soil type. A small fraction of the dose was found in the leachate. Thisd unexpected result could not be explained. At the end of the column experiment all phenyl-tin residues were found in the upper 10 cm of the columns...|$|E
40|$|According to {{traits of}} {{pesticides}} permitted {{to use in}} sugar beet (oral percutaneus and inhalation toxicity, toxicity to wildlife, bees and aquatic organisms, re-entry interval, maximum number of treatments, effects on reproduction) do not present health risk in sugar production/technology. However, the danger exists for workers by chronic exposure during the application, especially from pesticide being potential endocrine disruptors (EDS) (<b>fentin</b> <b>acetate,</b> benomyl, endosulfan, methomyl, methidathion). EDS can cause sterility or decreased fertility, impaired development, birth defects of the reproductive tract and metabolic disorders. Authors recommend limited application of EDS pesticides (to {{limit the number of}} treatments to only one during the vegetation), replacement with pesticides with low risk to humans game and fishes, as well as mandatory submission of re-entry data for registration...|$|E
40|$|Among the {{biocidal}} triorganotin compounds, triphenyltin derivatives (TPTs, <b>Fentin),</b> i. e. <b>acetate</b> (TPTA), hydroxide (TPTH), and chloride (TPTC) {{are used}} world wide as fungicide – mainly against Cercospora beticola -, herbicides, antifeedings, and molluscicides. They are of environmental concern owing to direct introduction into the marine {{water and sediments}} by leaching from employment in agriculture with particular contamination of coastal areas as in the Venice Lagoon. As lipophilic compounds, TPTs accumulate by oral and via gill intake especially in the fatty compartments of the teleostean fishes. In the latters the resulted bioconcentration is responsible of mortality after continue exposure, together with the decreased resistance to infections. Such effect appears {{in accord with the}} highly selective toxicity on the immune system in mammals. Our previous studies showed that organotin compounds, such as butyltin derivatives mainly employed in antifouling paints, are immunotoxic in tunicates causing inhibitory effects on yeast phagocytosis by hemocytes of the colonial ascidian Botryllus schlosseri, which is spread in Venice Lagoon. Therefore we have extended the study to TPTs with the aim of investigating whether hemocytes of this species were still sensitive biosensors with the same mechanism. TPTs were first dissolved in DMSO and then diluted and always employed at concentrations of 0. 1, 1, 10 µM in sea water. After 1 hr exposure, viability of hemocytes was not affected up to 100 µM for TPTA and TPTC, and 1 mM for TPTH, indicating and about tenfold lesser sensitivity than mammal thymocytes. Only at 100 µM TPTs caused some morphological changes without cytolysis, suggesting an interaction with cytoskeletal constituents. Analogously to butyltin, TPTs exerted significant inhibitory effects on yeast phagocytosis – TPTC > TPTA > TPTH – in a concentration-dependent manner. The same order of inhibition was observed for Ca 2 +-ATPase activity, suggesting that the inhibition of this enzyme and of phagocytosis might be strictly linked, as we demonstrated with butyltin. So, in general, organotins may influence cell calcium homeostasis. As for alkyl trorganortins – TBT > TET > TMT -, addition of 20 µg/ml calmodulin (CaM) was able to reverse the inhibition of Ca 2 +-ATPase activity by TPTs, but not restoring the phagocytosis index. These results supported the hypothesis that the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation might also be involved. In fact, O 2 °- production was inhibited – TPTA > TPTC > TPTH – in a concentration-dependent manner, but not restored by CaM. So CaM {{does not seem to be}} involved in the respiratory burst of mitochondria. In conclusion, TPTs inhibit the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in tunicates as shown in teleosts, but impair the cell-mediated immunity compromising the phagocyte system, differently from mammals where e. g. TPTH is not immunotoxic. Therefore tunicates appear effective candidates for sentinel organisms of organotin pollutants...|$|R
