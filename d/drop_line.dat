5000|$|In poetry, a <b>dropped</b> <b>line</b> {{is a line}} {{which is}} broken into two lines, but where the second part is {{indented}} to the horizontal position {{it would have had}} an unbroken line. For example, in the poem [...] "The Other Side of the River" [...] by Charles Wright, the first and second <b>lines</b> form a <b>dropped</b> <b>line,</b> as do the fourth and fifth lines: It's linkage I'm talking about,::::::::and harmonies and structures,And all the various things that lock our wrists to the past.Something infinite behind everything appears,:::::::::::::and then disappears. Charles Wright <b>Dropped</b> <b>lines</b> have a variety of functions and uses. In Robert Denham's words, a <b>dropped</b> <b>line</b> is [...] "a spatial as well as temporal feature, affecting both the eye and ear." [...] It may be used to determine the visual appearance of the line as a whole. Wright, for example, uses <b>dropped</b> <b>lines</b> to reference landscape paintings, especially by Paul Cézanne and Giorgio Morandi, which influenced his writing. As Joe Moffett notes, the <b>dropped</b> <b>line</b> [...] "can be seen as imitating the sense of horizontal rhythm prevalent in paintings by Cézanne." [...] Modern poets who are known for using <b>dropped</b> <b>lines</b> include Wright, Carl Phillips, and Edward Hirsch.|$|R

50|$|Once {{the line}} is set, the angler need only check the line {{periodically}} throughout the day {{to see if any}} fish have been caught. While checking the line, one can also replace bait, untangle <b>drop</b> <b>lines,</b> and retrieve any fish on the line. Care is needed when checking or setting the line to make sure that no one is accidentally hooked in any part of the process.|$|R

50|$|Fishing gear damages reefs via direct {{physical}} {{contact with the}} reef structure and substrate. Gill nets, fish traps, and anchors break branching coral and cause coral death through entanglement. When fishermen <b>drop</b> <b>lines</b> by coral reefs, the lines entangle the coral. The fisher cuts the line and abandons it, leaving it attached to the reef. The discarded lines abrade coral polyps and upper tissue layers. Corals are able to recover from small lesions, but larger and recurrent damage complicates recovery.|$|R
5000|$|The {{population}} size is unknown, but numbers have decreased {{as much as}} 99% in some areas since the 1970s. This species is harvested, by commercial trawling or <b>drop</b> <b>lining,</b> for meat and liver oil (squalene). Upper-slope dogfish species are more vulnerable to capture than midslope species, because they are targeted throughout their vertical distribution and most of their local geographic distribution. [...] The low reproductive rate, late age of maturity, and long lifespan typical of these sharks means they are likely unable to recover quickly after depletion.|$|R
50|$|A {{handling}} or <b>drop</b> <b>line</b> {{is mandatory}} safety equipment in many countries. This is a rope or webbing of 20-30 meters in length {{attached to the}} balloon basket with a quick release connection at one end. In very calm winds the balloon pilot can throw the handling line from the balloon so that the ground crew can guide the balloon safely away from obstructions on the ground.|$|E
50|$|Yellow garden spiders breed twice a year. The males roam {{in search}} of a female, {{building}} a small web near or actually in the female's web, then court the females by plucking strands on her web. Often, when the male approaches the female, he has a safety <b>drop</b> <b>line</b> ready, in case she attacks him. The male uses the palpal bulbs on his pedipalps to transfer sperm to the female. After inserting the second palpal bulb, the male dies, and is sometimes then eaten by the female.|$|E
50|$|While it is {{certainly}} possible to enjoy the sport of hot air ballooning without a chase vehicle, returning from the landing site by foot, bicycle, or hitch hiking, many balloonists opt {{to be followed by}} their ground crew in some sort of chase vehicle. Crew at the landing site can aid with the landing itself, by catching a <b>drop</b> <b>line</b> and guiding the balloon into a tight space; with extracting the balloon system from a remote location, such as deep in a farmer's field; and with packing up all the equipment.|$|E

Don't want to stop it, just want to know how it starts." [...] If listened closely enough on [...] "Aware" [...] and [...] "More of the Same," [...] something can even be noticed, something more or less alien to hardcore records of the era: guitar solos.|$|R
5000|$|Kite {{fishing is}} a fishing {{technique}} involving a kite from which hangs a <b>drop</b> <b>line</b> {{attached to a}} lure or bait. The kite is flown out {{over the surface of}} a body of water, and the bait floats near the waterline until taken by a fish. The kite then drops immediately, signaling to the fisherman that the bait has been taken, and the fish is then hauled in. Kites can provide the boatless fishermen access to waters that would otherwise be available only to boats. Similarly, for boat owners, kites provide a way to fish in areas where it is not safe to navigate such as shallows or coral reefs where fish may be plentiful.|$|E
50|$|Tree heights {{can also}} be {{directly}} measured by a tree climber. The climber accesses {{the top of the}} tree finding a position as near to the top as can be safely reached. Once safely anchored from that position the climber finds a clear path and drops a weighted line to the ground. A tape is fastened {{to the end of the}} <b>drop</b> <b>line</b> and pulled up to the top following the path of the weighted line. The bottom reference point is the mid-slope position of the trunk at ground level. The total height of the tree to the climber’s position is read directly from the tape. Fiberglass tapes are generally used for these measurements because of their light weight, negligible stretch, and because they do not need to be calibrated for use at different temperatures. If the tape is to be used later as a fixed reference for later trunk volume measurements the top is fastened in place using several thumbtacks. This holds the tape in position during the volume measurements, but it still can be pulled free from below when finished.|$|E
5000|$|In fact, {{the show}} was pitched towards hard-core Springsteen fans. Lesser-known tracks and rarities abounded in the set lists; enough album {{oriented}} rock radio classics were included to keep knowledgeable rock fans content, but Springsteen's Top 40 pop hits from the 1980s and early 1990s were almost completely ignored, causing marked discontent outside arenas for attendees coming from that perspective. In other ways, too, the tour was a feast for [...] "Bruce tramps". Internet forums and ticket exchange sites made travelling to multiple shows easier than ever. Tips were exchanged {{about how best to}} get [...] "jailbait" [...] seats, those in the first 17 rows of the arena floor for which a special bracelet was worn. In its traditional anti-scalping measure, Springsteen's management held tickets out for day-of-the-show [...] "drop lines", for which ticketless fans organized waiting lines. Even better was the [...] "Man in Black", a darkly dressed Springsteen representative who would walk the upper rafters before a show and upgrade some of the lucky faithful to front-row seats (and feed the exchanged nosebleeds out to the <b>drop</b> <b>line).</b> Indeed, some fans purposefully bought or sat in bad seats in hope of an MIB visit, though it seemed to help selection chances if someone young, attractive and female was in the party.|$|E

40|$|Fiber-to-the Home (FTTH) {{network system}} is a {{broadband}} network system which can transmit video, data and voice signals. To ensure good signals condition, a CATV tester device is proposed. The CATV tester device is designed to measure CATV signals passing through the optical network unit (ONU) at usersâ€™ premises. A single mode optical fiber signal entering the ONU will be obtained by â€˜tappingâ€™ method and the signal will then be fed into the CATV tester device through optical cable connection. A wireless technology is applied through the implementation of audio video transmitter and receiver. Then, this tester will display the received signal on the display panel. Although the signal received is accompanied by undesired signals and noises, it will then indicate that the status of main FTTH <b>drop</b> <b>line,</b> the possible damages and action needed {{that can be easily}} determined afterwards.

50|$|Typically, the <b>drop</b> <b>lines</b> are set so {{that the}} hook of one line can not touch the hook of another line, to prevent the fish from getting tangled up in {{multiple}} lines, or getting tangled in lines with other fish already on the line. This might mean using lines just over 1 foot long and having the lines spaced in 3 foot intervals. It is also typical to avoid setting lines directly over stumps, branches or other obstacles that might cause the fish to get tangled. This is done so that any released fish {{has a better chance}} of being in good health.|$|R
