5|$|The Naval Battle of Lemnos {{resulted}} from an Ottoman plan {{to lure the}} faster Georgios Averof away from the Dardanelles. The protected cruiser Hamidiye evaded the Greek blockade and broke out into the Aegean sea; the assumption was that the Greeks would dispatch Georgios Averof to <b>hunt</b> <b>down</b> Hamidiye. Despite the threat to Greek lines of communication posed by the cruiser, the Greek commander refused to detach Georgios Averof from her position. Georgios Averof appeared approximately 12miles from Lemnos; when the powerful Greek ship was spotted, the Ottomans turned to retreat with Georgios Averof in pursuit. She scored several hits on the fleeing Ottoman ships before breaking off the chase. Psara and her sisters were too slow {{to keep up with}} Georgios Averof, and played no part in the engagement. Since Georgios Averof was needed to keep the blockade, Psara and four destroyers were detached to <b>hunt</b> <b>down</b> Hamidiye. Psara was much slower than the Turkish cruiser, and had no real chance of catching her, and Hamidiye remained at large {{until the end of the}} war in May 1913.|$|E
