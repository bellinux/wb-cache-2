40|$|The {{performance}} <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> <b>investments</b> {{is inextricably}} linked to economic growth. Nonetheless, few studies on investing have explicitly taken research on economic growth into account. This study bridges that gap by examining the implications for <b>equity</b> investing <b>of</b> both theoretical models and empirical results from growth theory. The study concludes that over the long run, investors should anticipate real returns on common stock to average no more than about 4 percent. he performance <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> <b>investments</b> is {{inextricably linked to}} economic growth. Earnings, the source <b>of</b> value for <b>equity</b> <b>investments,</b> are themselves driven by eco-nomic activity. Unless corporate profits rise {{as a percentage of}} GDP, which cannot continue indefi-nitely, earnings growth is constrained by GDP growth. This dynamic means that the same factors that determine the rate of economic growth also place bounds on earnings growth and, thereby, the performance <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> <b>investments.</b> Despite these well-known facts, few studies on equity investing have explicitly taken the literature on economic growth into account. This observation is not meant to imply that research connecting economic growth with equity returns is sparse. Numerous contribu-tions in that area include several provocative pieces by Arnott and Bernstein (2002), Arnott and Asness (2003), and Bernstein and Arnott (2003). Nonethe-less, rarely has this research been expressly tied to the literature on the theory of economic growth.

40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this work is to investigate further development of the capital markets in the Republic of Croatia {{with a focus on}} industry concentration <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> <b>investment</b> funds with a public offering, and the changes that they have experienced since 2004 to date. Visage the Croatian capital market has changed in this period and therefore the aim is to measure investment capital concentration in the industry <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> <b>investment</b> funds. It is required to determine if in industry is perfect equality present or if the investment capital is directed only to a small number of large funds. Uncertainty, distrust, and a great level of risk are characteristics of the capital markets in development, such as Croatia. The aim is to determine whether the size of net assets of investment fund puts safety at the investor, and thus encourages investors to future investment in the fund, which generally speaking, increase the concentration of capital only in funds with a high value of net assets. Process of transition in the Republic of Croatia affected the development of capital markets and the emergence of new participants, namely an open investment fund. The foundations for long-term sustainable growth of the Croatian capital markets are currently still extremely unstable, and development of the market itself is tied to a sense of distrust and insecurity of its participants. It is necessary to investigate, in poorly developed capital market, if investors perceived greater safety of investments in large funds, which are the symptoms of a large concentration of capital in a small number of funds. We will also investigate whether the development of capital markets leads to a reduction of industrial concentration.

40|$|The {{impact of}} the time horizon upon the risk <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> <b>investments</b> is still a {{controversial}} issue. In this paper, we analyse long-term risk in a portfolio insurance framework based on option pricing theory. The insurance strategies are implemented alternatively with a portfolio of stocks and put options or bonds and call options. The risk of stock holdings {{is measured by the}} permissible relative stock position in the replicating portfolio for an exogenous floor function. Our findings indicate that there is no general conclusion as to the long-term risk of stocks; the risk can only be determined for specific floor functions. Because the utility function is implicit in any floor specification, we argue that the assumption of preference-free determination of risk with the help of option-pricing theory, as recently suggested in the literature, is a fallacy. Moreover, the popular belief that a longer time horizon reduces the risk <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> <b>investments</b> and therefore makes it optimal to invest a greater fraction of one's wealth in stocks may not be justified.

It contributes to the literature by fundamentally analyzing the decision criteria of family firm owners for using minority <b>investments</b> <b>of</b> private <b>equity</b> investors. This type of financing might be of great interest to family firms, as the family firm owner is able to secure majority ownership and control over the family business. Likewise, minority investments might be attractive for private equity investors, as they are mostly not leveraged and therefore independent from capital market turbulences. Using data from 21 case studies, we identify challenges induced by the family or the business that lead to the phenomenon <b>of</b> private <b>equity</b> minority <b>investments</b> in family firms. We find that perceived benefits and drawbacks <b>of</b> private <b>equity</b> <b>investments</b> are influenced by business and family characteristics.
