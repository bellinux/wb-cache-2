In separate modes of operation, the bonnet rotation-axis is orientated pole-down on the surface, or inclined {{at an angle}} and then precessed about the local normal. The bonnet, covered with standard polishing cloth and working with standard slurry, {{has been found to}} give superb surface textures in the regime of nanometre to sub-nanometre Ra values, starting with parts directly off precision CNC aspheric grinding machines. This paper reports an important extension of the process to the precision-controlled smoothing (or 'fining') operation required between more conventional diamond milling and subsequent Precession polishing. The method utilises an aggressive surface on the bonnet, again with slurry. This is compared with an alternative approach using diamond abrasives bound onto <b>flexible</b> <b>carriers</b> attached to the bonnets. The results demonstrate the viability of smoothing aspheric surfaces, which extends Precessions processing to parts with inferior input-quality. This may prove of particular importance to large optics where significant volumes of material may need to be removed, and to the creation of more substantial aspheric departures from a parent sphere. The paper continues with a recent update on results obtained, and lessons learnt, processing free-form surfaces, and concludes with an assessment of the relevance of the smoothing and free-form operations to the fabrication of off-axis parts including segments for extremely large telescopes...|$|R

Non-regular employment accounts 30 % of employment in Japanese society now. Universities in Japan must revise carrier education and raise undergraduates as professional carrier to survive. We investigated the carrier education from elementary school to high school to reform carrier education in higher education. We developed a questionnaire for freshman. This asks students' past carrier education and their consciousness about the education. As a result of the investigation, we found out followings. 1) In 2008 of the revision of curriculum guidelines, the enhancement of carrier education in elementary school and middle school was stressed. 2) School education developed systematic carrier education from elementary school and high school based of the revision.

40|$|AbstractObjective: The {{percutaneous}} steel Greenfield filter (PSGF) {{is similar}} in appearance to the titanium Greenfield filter (TGF) but differs in the length and orientation of the attachment hooks and in the over-the-wire delivery system. Because these differences improve ease of insertion and attachment, they may affect patient outcomes and physician practices. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the performance of the PSGF relative to the TGF and to determine whether there had been a change in physician practices. Methods: The Michigan Filter Registry contains data for a prospective cohort of 2188 patients with Greenfield filters. Procedural and long-term outcomes for patients with a PSGF were abstracted. These events were compared with rates for Registry patients who had a TGF. Trends for indication for placement, delivery route, and filter location were also compared with published series. Results: Since 1995, 600 PSGFs have been placed in 599 patients. A 1 -year mortality rate of 42 % left 349 patients available for annual follow-up, and studies were completed for 231 (66 %). Periprocedural events occurred in 2. 5 % of cases with associated morbidity in 1. 5 %. The rate of new pulmonary embolism was 2. 6 %, and vena caval patency was 98. 3 %. The combined rate of new venous thromboembolic events was 12. 5 %. Left-sided femoral vein placements increased to 20 %, and the major indication for filter placement has become prophylaxis (46 %). Conclusions: The PSGF is similar to the TGF with respect to patient outcomes, and it provides decreased rates of asymmetry along with excellent fixation. The <b>flexible</b> <b>carrier</b> system has allowed more frequent access through the left femoral vein. The ease of use and favorable patient outcomes have resulted in more frequent placement for prophylactic indications. (J Vasc Surg 2000; 32 : 888 - 93. ...|$|E

40|$|Purpose - In {{the past}} 15 years {{stretchable}} electronic circuits {{have emerged as}} a new technology {{in the domain of}} assembly, interconnections and sensor circuits and assembly technologies. In the meantime a wide variety of processes with the use of many different materials have been explored in this new field. The purpose of the current contribution is for the authors to present an approach for stretchable circuits which is inspired by conventional rigid and flexible printed circuit board (PCB) technology. Two variants of this technology are presented: stretchable circuit board (SCB) and stretchable mould interconnect (SMI). Design/methodology/approach - Similarly as in PCB 17 or 35 Am thick sheets of electrodeposited or rolled-annealed Cu are structured to form the conductive tracks, and off-the-shelf, standard packaged, rigid components are assembled on the Cu contact pads using lead-free solder materials and reflow processes. Stretchability is obtained by shaping the Cu tracks not as straight lines, like in normal PCB design, but as horseshoe shaped meanders. Instead of rigid or flexible board materials, elastic materials, predominantly PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane), are used to embed the conductors and the components, thus serving as circuit carrier. The authors include some mechanical modeling and design considerations, aimed at the optimization of the build-up and combination of elastic, flexible and rigid materials towards minimal stress and maximum mechanical reliability in the structures. Furthermore, details on the two production processes are given, reliability findings are summarised, and a number of functional demonstrators, realized with the technologies, are described. Findings - Key conclusions of the work are that: supporting the metal meanders with a <b>flexible</b> <b>carrier</b> prior to embedding in an elastic substrate substantially increases the reliability under mechanical stress (cyclic uniaxial stretching) of the stretchable interconnect and the transition areas between rigid components and stretchable interconnects are the zones which are most sensitive to failure under mechanical stress. Careful design and technology implementation is necessary, providing a gradual transition from rigid to flexible to stretchable parts of the circuit. Originality/value - Technologies for stretchable circuits, with the same level of similarity to standard PCB manufacturing and assembly, and thus with the same high potential for transfer to an industrial environment and for mass production, have not been shown before...|$|E
40|$|Major {{efforts have}} been spent during recent years in {{worldwide}} attempts to achieve an electronic paper technology; the common name for novel flexible displays utilizing substrates such as paper, plastics or thin metal sheets. Various kinds of technology are available that potentially {{will be used for}} an electronic paper, which differs from each other mainly with respect to the choice of active materials, substrates and manufacturing techniques. There are many applications for electronic paper technology, ranging from high-resolution displays used in electronic books to updateable large-area billboards. The latter suggests a novel electronic display function that could extend the utilization of cellulose-based paper, {{which is one of the}} most common materials ever produced by mankind, by using the paper as a thin and <b>flexible</b> <b>carrier.</b> The requirement for fast update speed in such large area applications would probably be a bit more relaxed compared to traditional display technologies, while low-power consumption and bi-stability are among the factors that should be further emphasized, together with the utilization of well-established printing techniques to enable low-cost manufacturing of the displays. The choice of active materials is therefore crucial in order to reach these objectives in reality and this paves the way for printable conjugated polymers with electrochromic properties. Chemical synthesis of these materials during the last decades has resulted in a vast variety of electrochromic polymers with custom-tailored functionality covering a broad range of optical absorption and electrical conductivities. This thesis review the studies done on the electrochemical switching of poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT). For this material both the electrical conductivity and the optical absorption is controlled by the oxidation state. Active matrix addressed displays that are printed on flexible substrates have been obtained by arranging electrochemical smart pixels, based on the combination of electrochemical transistors and electrochromic display cells, into cross-point matrices. The resulting polymer-based active-matrix displays are operated at low voltages and the same active material can be used in electrochemical transistors and conducting lines and in electrochromic display cells employing the electronic and the opto-electonic properties of the material, respectively. In addition to this, a switchable optical polarizer is briefly discussed. This is a device utilizing electrochromism of stretch-aligned polyaniline (PANI). The combination of two identical devices in a vertical architecture, orthogonally oriented with respect to each other, results in a filter in which the orientation of the polarized optical absorption is governed by the voltage polarity applied to the device.

40|$|Lungs {{are exposed}} to {{different}} forms of stress such as chemical substances, allergens or {{in the form of}} direct tissue injury. This study examined whether precision-cut lung slices are suitable as a model for studying different types of stress. We established the use of PCLS from sheep to study the response of airways and vessels to mediators. According to in vivo experiments sheep are thought to represent the human pathophysiology better than rodents. We therefore established the use of sheep PCLS and showed that methacholine, serotonin and endothelin- 1 lead to a bronchoconstriction, while the response to leukotriene and thromboxane was rather weak. PCLS were also produced from preterm sheep and compared to adult sheep, which revealed a decreased reagibility to methacholine and serotonin in preterm sheep. Comparison of the bronchoconstriction of sheep PCLS with bronchoconstriction data from human PCLS revealed a less satisfactory accordance than the one seen in vivo. Although sheep PCLS may not represent the characteristics of human PCLS completely, the results presented in this thesis indicate that they are closer to human PCLS than PCLS from rodents. Another kind of stress that we examined was chemical stress. This study also aimed at studying the usefulness of PCLS to study respiratory allergens as required in the REACH (Regulation, Evaluation, Authorisation and restriction of CHemicals) process. Bronchoconstriction in PCLS as response to chemical allergen was investigated and compared to bronchoconstriction in vivo. For this purpose a well established sensitisation protocol with TMA, a respiratory allergen and DNCB, a dermal allergen, was used. The early allergic response and airway hyperresponsiveness in mouse PCLS was investigated and compared to data from in vivo invasive measurements. Acquired measurements were comparable suggesting PCLS as a reasonable alternative to invasive lung function measurements. Hence, stress-related bronchoconstriction to chemical allergens may be a suitable predictability for in vivo experiments. Several in vivo and cell culture models have been developed to study the pulmonary responses to mechanical stretch. While providing extremely useful information, these models do also suffer from limitations in being either too complex for detailed mechanical or mechanistic studies, or being devoid of the full complexity present in vivo (e. g. different cell types and interstitial matrix). Therefore, we developed a new model, based on the biaxial stretching of precision-cut lung slices. Single PCLS were mounted on a thin and <b>flexible</b> <b>carrier</b> membrane of PDMS in a bioreactor and the membrane was stretched by applying varying pressures under static conditions. A gene array revealed a general upregulation of immune response and wound healing genes by the slicing process. Stretch markers like amphiregulin were upregulated in PCLS by the slicing process. This upregulation was dependent on tyrosin kinases and the cytoskeleton, but could not be blocked sufficiently, which made it complicated to differentiate a stretch response from the basal increase. Distension of the PCLS was modelled via finite element simulation. According to this analysis, lung tissue was stretched by up to 38 % in the latitudinal and by up to 44 % in the longitudinal direction resulting in alveolar distension similar to what has been described in intact lungs. Lung slices were stretched dynamically with a frequency of 0. 25 Hz for 4 h, without causing cell injury. This indicates that the distension of PCLS in the bioreactor may not be suitable to study gene expression but allow the calculation of deformation and occurring forces of the PCLS during the stretching process. PCLS are a suitable model for studying different forms of stress in the lung and allows the investigation of different pathophysiological situations. Additionally, PCLS may serve as a link between different species...|$|E

Results of the investigation indicate that there is no stability problem due to flexible coupling of the experiment package and the carrier, and that the ATM-type system is capable of pointing accuracies better than 0. 1 arc second.

40|$|Problems in {{measurement}} of irregularities in angular velocity of rotating assemblies in memory devices with rigid and <b>flexible</b> magnetic data <b>carriers</b> are discussed. A device and method for determination {{of change in}} angular velocities in various frequency and rotation rate ranges are examined. A schematic diagram of a photoelectric sensor for recording the signal pulses is provided. Mathematical models are developed to show the amount of error which can result from misalignment of the test equipment...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{and compares}} two integration methods to structurally laminate and interconnect foil-based components with flexible polymeric substrates. The first method uses isotropic conductive adhesives (ICA) confined in laser-ablated through foil vias (TFV), {{while the second}} one uses an anisotropic conductive adhesive (ACA). Both procedures were successfully demonstrated by interconnecting silver-based inkjet printed and gold-sputtered interdigitated capacitive humidity sensors onto <b>flexible</b> PEN <b>carrier</b> substrates, showing functionality, high process yield and low-complexity. The robustness of the assemblies was tested and compared for adhesion, bending, high humidity and temperature cycling. Confined ICA vias show higher mechanical robustness to bending, while both methods remained functional after more than 900 h of environmental ageing. Finally, the interconnections were fully validated {{at different levels of}} relative humidity (RH) by comparing the sensor response to that of a commercial sensor. © 2013 Elsevier B. V.
