25|$|In 1947, Fred Smye, {{president}} of Avro, advised Herbert James Symington of TCA {{that they could}} not meet the <b>fixed</b> <b>price</b> <b>contract.</b> Symington's response was {{to pull out of the}} project, perhaps due to having successfully taken delivery of their new Canadair North Stars. C. D. Howe stepped in and offered $1.5 million to continue the project, at a slower pace. At about the same time, Rolls-Royce told Avro that the civil certification of the Avon could not be guaranteed in time for the Jetliner's rollout. This, in turn, would lead to higher operational and maintenance costs. Nevertheless, Avro continued with its plan to build the jet, selecting four Rolls-Royce Derwents to replace the two Avons.|$|E

40|$|Sales and {{distribution}} innovations have increased productivity in the salmon aquaculture industry. In this article, we investigate {{the use of}} <b>fixed</b> <b>price</b> <b>contracts</b> for Norwegian salmon exports to France based on all export transactions between the two countries. Our analysis shows that almost 25 % of these exports were traded using <b>fixed</b> <b>price</b> <b>contracts</b> and <b>contract</b> <b>prices</b> were renegotiated at different intervals, including as infrequently as once a year. Some contracts allow the contracting parties to adjust <b>contract</b> <b>prices</b> when the export price moves significantly. Benchmark analysis, which shows a marginal 0. 5 % difference between average unit revenue for the year from spot sales relative to contract sales, indicates that contracts primarily change revenue time profiles. The use of contracts creates a wedge between salmon export prices and spot prices in periods of price volatility, which in turn reduces <b>price</b> transmission. <b>Contracts,</b> salmon aquaculture, International Relations/Trade, Productivity Analysis, Research Methods/ Statistical Methods, L 14, Q 22,...|$|R
40|$|Proceedings Paper (for Acquisition Research Program) Cost {{and time}} overruns in Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAPs) {{have become a}} {{high-profile}} problem attracting the interest of Congress, government, and watchdog groups. According to the GAO, the 98 MDAPs from FY 2010 collectively ran $ 402 billion over budget and were an average of 22 months behind schedule since their first full estimate. President Obama''s memorandum on government contracting of 4 March 2009 also highlighted this issue. This paper presents findings {{of research on the}} root causes of cost and schedule delays for 92 MDAPs active in 2010 and 12 cancelled programs. The results do not establish causality but they do indicate multiple notable correlations. Inaccurate cost estimates are responsible for the strongest correlation with net cost growth changes and are associated with 40 % of the accumulated cost overruns. In addition, the start year has little impact on the compound annual growth rate of cost overruns. This suggests that relatively better performance of newer programs may prove illusionary as programs age. Finally, <b>fixed</b> <b>price</b> <b>contracts</b> appear to have relatively smaller overruns, although this may tell us more about which programs are likely to receive <b>fixed</b> <b>price</b> <b>contracts</b> rather than what effect <b>fixed</b> <b>price</b> <b>contracts</b> may have on program performance.

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} to develop concepts of project and contract organization {{to predict the}} selection of contract type on infrastructure projects. Conventional wisdom is that at low risk <b>fixed</b> <b>price</b> <b>contracts</b> are best, moving to remeasurement and then cost plus as risk increases. We started trying to predict this from a transaction cost perspective, and such an analysis confirmed conventional wisdom. However, it does not fit with current practice. Further, the differences in transaction costs are small compared to differences in contract out-turn cost that occur under the different motivational effects of different contract types. We therefore take a different perspective. We assume the purpose behind a project contract {{is to create a}} cooperative project organization, in which all participants, clients and contractors, are motivated to achieve common objectives, their goals are aligned. This analysis confirms modern practice, and shows selection of contract type is related to uncertainty in the project's deliverables, and uncertainty in the process of their delivery. Build only remeasurement contracts are used where uncertainty of both product and process is low. Design and build <b>fixed</b> <b>price</b> <b>contracts</b> are used where uncertainty of the product is low, but the uncertainty in the process of delivery is high. <b>Fixed</b> <b>price</b> <b>contracts</b> should be used where both are high. We extend the analysis to show when the client should be involved in the project organization in an alliance contract, and when they should not, as in a traditional project contrac...|$|R

50|$|About this time, General Dynamics {{made the}} {{decision}} not to compete in the tests mandated by Congress, because of the Army's demand for a <b>fixed</b> <b>price</b> <b>contract</b> on any future Viper production lots that were to include safety improvements.

Two months later, the testing mandated by Congress found the Swedish designed AT4 the most suitable off-the-shelf option to replace the M72 LAW. The AT4 did not meet every requirement, but it was the only one to meet most of the requirements. Congress agreed and funded that weapon as the future M72 LAW replacement.|$|E
