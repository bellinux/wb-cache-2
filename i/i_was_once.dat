The Greeks {{believed}} that only barbarians drank unmixed or undiluted wine and that the Spartan king Cleomenes <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>once</b> driven insane after drinking wine this way. They also believed that undiluted wine could even kill the drinker: the Gallic chieftain Brennus was recorded as having committed suicide by drinking wine full-strength. Greeks asserted that the dilution of wine with water was a mark of civilized behavior, whose contrast was embodied in {{the myth of the}} battle of Lapiths with the Centaurs, inflamed to rape and mayhem because of wine drunk undiluted with water.|$|E
2500|$|While some {{winemaking}} techniques {{once considered}} fraudulent are now generally accepted, a few practices {{have gone in}} the opposite direction. One {{of the most controversial}} is adding water to wine in a technique known today as humidification. Master of wine Jancis Robinson calls the act of adding water to [...] "stretch out" [...] or dilute wine [...] "possibly the oldest form of wine fraud in the book." [...] There is a long history of adding water to dilute wine {{in order to make it}} more palatable. The ancient Greeks thought it was [...] "barbaric" [...] to drink undiluted wine. They further believed that undiluted wine was unhealthy and that the Spartan king Cleomenes <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>once</b> driven insane after drinking wine that was not diluted with water. Today, few consumers dilute their wine as the Greeks did, but the use of water during the winemaking process is still prevalent.|$|E
2500|$|Josephine wrote {{much later}} that [...] "The {{fear and the}} excitement, the weeks of {{exhausting}} travel, chagrin over my own foolishness, all together proved too much for my strength. I developed St. Vitus Dance {{and was unable to}} attend school very much again. After a time however I very much improved in health so that within two years after my experience <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>once</b> more a normal healthy girl." [...] If Josephine, as she said, left San Francisco at age 18, it's unclear why she would still be attending school upon her return two years later. Like cerebral meningitis, St. Vitus Dance is a form of a streptococcus infection. The symptoms of St. Vitus Dance and meningitis are somewhat different, but both can be contracted from the same strain of bacteria through saliva. Both of Behan's children, Henrietta and Albert, were ill with meningitis around 1877, and in July of that year, Henrietta died from the disease.|$|E
