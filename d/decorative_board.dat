50|$|The {{interior}} {{design of the}} building {{is a tribute to}} detail. The design of each lamp, piece of furniture, panel, flooring material and <b>decorative</b> <b>board</b> reflects the mature approach resulting from Aalto’s long career as an architect. All the materials speak the language of nature, simply without technically artificial tones. This is because Aalto’s basic view was that architecture should create a frame for human beings. In the Finlandia Hall, the focus is not on extraordinary forms or ostentatious interior. It is on the audience and on the performers. According to Aalto, the audience at the Finlandia Hall need not dress up like people used to in the opera foyers and gilded concert halls of the old days. What people wear should be as genuine and natural as the environment in the building.|$|E

50|$|The {{early period}} shikumen also possessed more {{features}} of traditional Chinese architecture: on the external façade of the terrace {{there are often}} typically Chinese matou ("horse head") style or Guanyin dou ("Guanyin hood") style gables; the main hall uses floor-to-ceiling windows; <b>decorative</b> <b>boards</b> below eaves; and grid windows on the side wings. However, in contrast to later shikumen buildings, the gates of early period shikumen were not elaborately decorated, and were simply framed in stone. In terms of layout, the shikumen of this period were arranged in lanes of about 3 metres wide - narrower than later buildings - and the attention to orientation, and organization of trunk lanes and branch lanes, both features of later shikumen, were also absent.|$|R

The house has a rambling cruciform plan with ten major rooms on a principal story. Two flights of steps which ascend a full story to an Eastlake gallery. This gallery makes a total of four ninety-degree turns as it runs {{from one side of the}} house to the other.

5000|$|The cost of {{the station}} was £1,000 in respect of {{building}} work plus £200 for machinery. Two platforms were provided with the station buildings on the [...] "Up" [...] side and a timber platform and waiting shelter on the [...] "Down" [...] side. The stone [...] "Up" [...] platform was very low and also very narrow. The architecture was a rural combination of brick and timber with some restrained ornamentation. The station house which adjoined the platform buildings was in a similar style to structures on the Bletchley to Bedford section of the line, being built of brick and half timber rendered with cement and <b>decorative</b> barge <b>boarding</b> around the gables. A small goods yard was served by two sidings and comprised a loading dock, weighbridge, brick hut, ground frame and loading gauge. The level crossing gate and sidings were controlled by Annett's key; when the siding was in use {{it could only be}} released by a key which was kept in a gable wing of the station building. During London, Midland and Scottish Railway days, the station, which was in a relatively rural location, was served by six services in either direction on weekdays, plus an extra service on Saturdays and three services on Sundays. When the stationmaster at Claydon was abolished, two porter signalmen ran the station on alternate shifts.|$|R
