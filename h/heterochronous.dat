If the temporal range of the sampled sequences is large relative to the rate of mutation, the sampling times can directly calibrate evolutionary rates to calendar time. Here, we extend this calibration process to provide a full probabilistic method that utilizes temporal information in <b>heterochronous</b> data sets to estimate sampling times (leaf-ages) for sequenced for which this information unavailable. Our method is similar to relaxing the constraints of the molecular clock on specific lineages within a phylogenetic tree. Using a combination of synthetic and empirical data sets, we demonstrate that the method estimates leaf-ages reliably and accurately. Potential applications of our approach include incorporating samples of uncertain or radiocarbon-infinite age into ancient DNA analyses, evaluating the temporal signal in a particular sequence or data set, and exploring the reliability of sequence ages that are somehow contentious.

The departure from a closed panmictic model require researchers to either exploit software developed for the analysis of isochronous data, take advantage of simulation approaches using algorithms developed for <b>heterochronous</b> data, or explore approximate Bayesian computation. Here, we review statistical approaches employed and available software for the joint analysis of ancient and modern DNA, and where appropriate we suggest how these may be further developed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} free-space {{optical communication}} between a distributed collection of nodes (e. g., a distributed net-work of sensor nodes) and a central base station with an imaging receiver. This paper studies both synchronous and asynchronous {{reception of the}} optical signals from the nodes at the imaging receiver. Synchronous reception is done using a symbol-by-symbol maximal-ratio combining technique. We describe a low-com-plexity asynchronous reception scheme for the uplink that allows the nodes to transmit at a bit rate slightly lower than the frame rate. Since the two rates are nominally different, the scheme {{is said to be}} <b>heterochronous.</b> Our <b>heterochronous</b> detection algorithm uses joint maximum-likelihood sequence detection of multiple trellises, which can be implemented using the Viterbi algorithm, as well as the per-survivor processing technique.

40|$|Inference of {{population}} demographic history has vastly improved {{in recent years}} due {{to a number of}} technological and theoretical advances including the use of ancient DNA. Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) stands among the most promising methods due to its simple theoretical fundament and exceptional flexibility. However, limited availability of user-friendly programs that perform ABC analysis renders it difficult to implement, and hence programming skills are frequently required. In addition, there is limited availability of programs able to deal with <b>heterochronous</b> data. Here we present the software BaySICS: Bayesian Statistical Inference of Coalescent Simulations. BaySICS provides an integrated and user-friendly platform that performs ABC analyses by means of coalescent simulations from DNA sequence data. It estimates historical demographic population parameters and performs hypothesis testing by means of Bayes factors obtained from model comparisons. Although providing specific features that improve inference from datasets with <b>heterochronous</b> data, BaySICS also has several capabilities making it a suitable tool for analysing contemporary genetic datasets. Those capabilities include joint analysis of independent tables, a graphical interface and the implementation of Markov-chain Monte Carlo without likelihoods...|$|E
40|$|Neural Baldwinism {{concerns}} the Baldwin Effect {{in the evolution}} of brains and intelligence. The first phase of the Baldwin Effect (B. E.), wherein plasticity provides a selective advantage, is intuitive and commonplace in simulations of adaptive systems. However, the second (assimilation) phase often poses problems for Baldwinism in general, and this is particularly acute for biological neural networks, where a complex developmental process greatly confounds the mapping from genotype to functional phenotype: a brain whose synapses are tuned to perform particular tasks. Since a strong genotype-phenotype correlation is often viewed as a prerequisite to this second phase, the body’s most plastic organ would appear to defy Baldwinism. However, a detailed examination of 3 key processes of neural adaptation blurs the distinction between classic developmental and learning stages of brain maturation, thus supporting a re-interpretation of Neural Baldwinism’s phase II as a <b>heterochronous</b> shift of the bulk of these three adaptive processes from postnatal to prenatal stages.

40|$|This work aims {{to explore}} the use of genetic {{sequences}} sampled serially through time (<b>heterochronous</b> data), to infer the timescale of past evolutionary events. Such data can be generated from preserved sub-fossil or fossil organismal remains (like mummified tissues, fossilized bones or coprolites), and then used to observe genetic modifications in real-time. Most importantly, the dates of the samples provide firm temporal tie points for their genetic sequences, {{and can be used}} to calibrate phylogenetic reconstructions. This thesis presents several case studies where ancient DNA was used to re-calibrate evolutionary timescales. In every situation, the use of <b>heterochronous</b> data led to elevated molecular rate estimates, resulting in the reconstruction of younger timescales, as compared to estimates based on fossil calibrations. These observations are in agreement with the recent demonstration that molecular rates vary according to the time period over which they are calculated. This work shows that, ancient DNA offers crucial temporal information to reliably estimate the timescale of recent population evolution, and is generally the only source of direct calibration available for this specific timeframe. Along with the results specific to each organism studied (hyena, bison and human), an emphasis was placed on the methodological aspects of the use of ancient DNA to generate timed phylogenetic inferences. Additionally, simulated data and mathematical modelling were used to extend the understanding of specific aspects of the temporal dependence of molecular rates. The results discussed in the present study help to further elucidate the evolutionary mechanisms behind the molecular clock concept, and have implications for the development and application of statistical models to obtain accurate time estimates from genetic data.

40|$|Ancient DNA {{sequences}} {{are able}} to offer valuable insights into molecular evolutionary processes, which are not directly accessible via modern DNA. They are particularly suitable for the estimation of substitution rates because their ages provide calibrating information in phylogenetic analyses, circumventing {{the difficult task of}} choosing independent calibration points. The substitution rates obtained from such datasets have typically been high, falling between the rates estimated from pedigrees and species phylogenies. Many of these estimates have been made using a Bayesian phylogenetic method that explicitly accommodates <b>heterochronous</b> data. Stimulated by recent criticism of this method, we present a comprehensive simulation study that validates its performance. For datasets of moderate size, it produces accurate estimates of rates, while appearing robust to assumptions about demographic history. We then analyse a large collection of 749 ancient and 727 modern DNA sequences from 19 species of animals, plants and bacteria. Our new estimates confirm that the substitution rates estimated from ancient DNA sequences are elevated above long-term phylogenetic levels. ...|$|E

40|$|This study {{analyses}} temporality in designed landscapes. The {{meaning of}} temporality is explored, taking us beyond common conceptualisations of time. Temporality, invariably poorly understood {{in a landscape}} context, and previously acknowledged as being important, but with only limited explicit discourse, is examined {{through the lens of}} a fresh theoretical articulation of temporality pertaining to designed landscapes. A phenomenological approach becomes imperative; and is employed in probing the work, through writing, of several eminent landscape designers between 1945 and 2005. These designers’ works are analysed through the texts, and with support from images of the works, for characteristics of temporality. Textual material offered a broad range of verbal articulation of these characteristics. Some designed landscapes are described with explicit verbalisation of their temporal qualities: others require analysis to discover their temporal qualities from text that is only mildly suggestive. The <b>heterochronous</b> characteristics of temporality expressed in these designers’ works are named and ordered within five themes: tempo, process, duration, imagination and layers.

We {{report on a}} 42 -year-old woman who was diagnosed with recurrent breast cancer that was detected due {{to the presence of}} PTTM. Eleven months after surgery for <b>heterochronous</b> bilateral cancer of the left breast, she developed progressive dyspnea but computerized tomography showed no pulmonary thromboembolism, and a transthoracic echocardiography revealed mild pulmonary hypertension. She was diagnosed with PTTM by cytology from pulmonary artery catheterization and perfusion lung scintigraphy. Also, the patients complained of back pain after admission, bone scintigraphy showed multiple bone metastases. Despite the early diagnosis of PTTM, her platelet count decreased, her performance status rapidly deteriorated, and her dyspnea worsened. Thus, we could not treat her with chemotherapy. She died due to respiratory failure 19 days after admission. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of recurrent breast cancer identified by the manifestation of PTTM. Although PTTM is a rare phenomenon, it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute dyspnea or pulmonary hypertension in patients with breast cancer.

40|$|The {{origins of}} many plant {{diseases}} {{appear to be}} recent and associated {{with the rise of}} domestication, the spread of agriculture or recent global movements of crops. Distinguishing between these possibilities is problematic because of the difficulty of determining rates of molecular evolution over short time frames. <b>Heterochronous</b> approaches using recent and historical samples show that plant viruses exhibit highly variable and often rapid rates of molecular evolution. The accuracy of estimated evolution rates and age of origin can be greatly improved with the inclusion of older molecular data from archaeological material. Here we present the first reconstruction of an archaeological RNA genome, which is of Barley Stripe Mosaic Virus (BSMV) isolated from barley grain ~ 750 years of age. Phylogenetic analysis of BSMV that includes this genome indicates the divergence of BSMV and its closest relative prior to this time, most likely around 2000 years ago. However, exclusion of the archaeological data results in an apparently much more recent origin of the virus that postdates even the archaeological sample.

We have sequenced 10, 236 nucleotides of the open reading frame (93. 6 % of the full-length genome) of 23 of these strains, and have used the sequences to conduct phylogenetic analyses, in order to investigate the forces shaping the evolution of St. Louis encephalitis virus. Contrary to previous reports, we found little evidence for recombination in these isolates.

Perhaps more exciting are recent developments in coalescence-based Bayesian inference that offer the potential to use temporal information from aDNA and mDNA for the estimation of substitution rates and divergence dates {{as an alternative to}} fossil and geological calibration. This comes at a time of growing interest in the possibility of time dependency for molecular rate estimates. In this study, we provide a critical assessment of Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis for the estimation of substitution rate using simulated samples of aDNA and mDNA. We conclude that the current models and priors employed in Bayesian MCMC analysis of <b>heterochronous</b> mtDNA are susceptible to an upward bias in the estimation of substitution rates because of model misspecification when the data come from populations with less than simple demographic histories, including sudden short-lived population bottlenecks or pronounced population structure.

40|$|One of {{the grand}} goals of {{historical}} biogeography is to understand how and why species' population sizes and distributions change over time. Multiple types of data drawn from disparate fields, combined into a single modelling framework, are necessary to document changes in a species's demography and distribution, and to determine the drivers responsible for change. Yet truly integrated approaches are challenging and rarely performed. Here, we discuss a modelling framework that integrates spatio-temporal fossil data, ancient DNA, palaeoclimatological reconstructions, bioclimatic envelope modelling and coalescence models in order to statistically test alternative hypotheses of demographic and potential distributional changes for the iconic American bison (Bison bison). Using different assumptions about {{the evolution of the}} bioclimatic niche, we generate hypothetical distributional and demographic histories of the species. We then test these demographic models by comparing the genetic signature predicted by serial coalescence against sequence data derived from subfossils and modern populations. Our results supported demographic models that include both climate and human-associated drivers of population declines. This synthetic approach, integrating palaeoclimatology, bioclimatic envelopes, serial coalescence, spatio-temporal fossil data and <b>heterochronous</b> DNA sequences, improves understanding of species' historical biogeogra-phy by allowing consideration of both abiotic and biotic interactions at the population level. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

The lithostratigraphical study allowed reconstruction of the palaeoenvironmental conditions during the existence of a palaeo-marsh. Based on tephrostratigraphical analysis, the significant volcanoclastic inputs recorded along the Sessano succession were correlated to the explosive activity of the nearby Roccamonfina volcano and in particular to the high-K series (HKS) period of activity, lasted from 546 to 364 ka. The 40 Ar/ 39 Ar age of 437. 9 1. 9 ka obtained {{at the base of the}} trench section, which stratigraphically overlaps the core succession, confirms the tephrostratigraphical model and indicates that the marsh dried up during the glacial phase of Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 12. On this basis, the glacial–interglacial cycle recognised in the core through pollen analysis was ascribed to MIS 14 and 13, while the interglacial phase identified at the core base was tentatively ascribed to MIS 15.

40|$|This essay {{examines}} {{the disruption of}} linear time in experimental forms of “history painting” as represented by Dierk Schmidt’s SIEV-X—On a Case of Intensified Refugee Politics (2001 - 2005). It analyses how the aesthetics of heterochronoia—multiple temporalities—play {{a crucial role in}} the development of a new understanding of the politics of “history painting. ” As Schmidt’s work reveals, a radical conception of history exists outside the “singular moment,” and in dialogue with heterogenous visual cultures (news media, art history, advertising). In attempting to understand the import of Schmidt’s work, this essay considers his methodologies for creating a <b>heterochronous</b> mode of history painting, particularly his anachronistic engagement with the work of Theodore Géricault and the iconic history painting, The Raft of the Medusa. Unlike previous critical responses to Schmidt’s work, this paper argues that (after Géricault) the artist’s use of investigative “journalistic” methodologies for SIEV-X—On a Case of Intensified Refugee Politics do not generate an aesthetics of exposé but rather an aesthetics of “fictionalization. ” This aesthetic is defined by the recalibration of documentary and speculative data as a means to reconceive the landscape of the perceptual. The findings of this research demonstrate that the use of disparate fragments—or data—to visualize otherwise diminishing historical events underpins contemporary history painting’s capacity for advancing a distinct economy of affect that circumvents the limitations of the news media and its “monopoly on reality. ...|$|E

Through a close study of both films, it demonstrates how Garrel finds a more nuanced and transformative aesthetic than Bertolucci in representing this defining moment in modern French culture and politics. The films share a number of aspects; most notably, they draw upon the history of cinema itself in recalling this period, an approach that can be related to Godard’s project in Histoire(s) du Cinéma (1988 - 1998). However, their differing approaches to cinematographic citation (metonymic in the case of Bertolucci, and metaphoric in the case of Garrel) have significant implications for the temporal dynamics of each film. The article argues that Bertolucci’s method is intrinsically conservative—reactionary, even—implying an historical linearity that reinforces the “pastness” of May, its significance as a piece of “heritage” rather than part of an ongoing historical process, or dialectic. Garrel’s practice of citation, by contrast, generates a more radical, <b>heterochronous</b> form that constitutes a testimony to May 1968 by evoking its continued presence.

The results show that, generally, in the lower portion the post-evaporitic Messinian was characterised by unstable environments, which hosted poor ostracod communities characterised by low diversity, while in the upper portion the environmental conditions were more stable, allowing the subdivision of the environment hyperspace in several different niches and, thus, supporting high-diversity ostracod communities. Anyway, the correlation of the boundary between low- and high-diversity ostracod assemblages through the studied successions has shown to be <b>heterochronous,</b> probably because it is due both to local and regional factors. A more detailed palaeoenvironmental reconstruction across the late Messinian Lago-Mare successions showed that, while in the lower portion the palaeoenvironments are rather disomogeneous, even if investigated in nearby sections, in the upper part a general trend towards a deepening and freshening followed by a new salinity increase and depth decrease has been recognized. The palaeoenvironmental variability of the lower part probably {{was related to the}} superimposition of local factors on global climatic forcing, while in the upper part the high amplitude insolation peaks drove the palaeoenvironmental changes at a regional scale...|$|E
40|$|The current standard-of-care {{treatment}} {{for patients with}} limited-stage small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is concurrent chemoradiotherapy for local and systemic control. However, standard-of-care treatment strategies have not been established for those with limited-stage SCLC who {{have a history of}} thoracic radiotherapy due to concerns with complications associated with radiation overdose. A 37 -year-old male developed an aspergilloma in the postoperative left thoracic space after he was treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy for mediastinal type lung adenocarcionoma and subsequent left upper lobectomy for <b>heterochronous</b> dual adenocarcinoma. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy was performed to examine the status of the suspected bronchopleural fistula when a polypoid mass was observed in the right mainstem bronchus. A histological examination showed that the mass was SCLC at a clinical stage of cTisN 0 M 0, stageIA, without local invasion. Since thoracic radiotherapy was not an option due to a previous history of thoracic irradiation, a combination treatment of carboplatin and etoposide was administered for 4 cycles and resulted in good partial response. In addition, argon plasma coagulation (APC) was performed as an alternative to curative radiotherapy on day 22 of the 4 th cycle. The 5 th cycle was administered 7 days after APC at which the anticancer therapy was completed. The patient remains disease-free 60 months after the completion of treatment, which suggests that this combination therapy may resolve very early-stage SCLC...|$|E
40|$|Estimates of the coalescent {{effective}} {{population size}} Ne can be poorly {{correlated with the}} true population size. The relationship between Ne and the population size is sensitive {{to the way in}} which birth and death rates vary over time. The problem of inference is exacerbated when the mechanisms underlying population dynamics are complex and depend on many parameters. In instances where nonparametric estimators of Ne such as the skyline struggle to reproduce the correct demographic history, model-based estimators that can draw on prior information about population size and growth rates may be more efficient. A coalescent model is developed for a large class of populations such that the demographic history is described by a deterministic nonlinear dynamical system of arbitrary dimension. This class of demographic model differs from those typically used in population genetics. Birth and death rates are not fixed, and no assumptions are made regarding the fraction of the population sampled. Furthermore, the population may be structured in such a way that gene copies reproduce both within and across demes. For this large class of models, it is shown how to derive the rate of coalescence, as well as the likelihood of a gene genealogy with <b>heterochronous</b> sampling and labeled taxa, and how to simulate a coalescent tree conditional on a complex demographic history. This theoretical framework encapsulates many of the models used by ecologists and epidemiologists and should facilitate the integration of population genetics with the study of mathematical population dynamics...|$|E
40|$|A fluvio-lacustrine {{succession}} {{was discovered}} in 1995 at Saticula, near Sant’Agata de’ Goti (Benevento), below a thick volcaniclastic deposit sealed by the Campania Ignimbrite formation (39 ka). Vertebrate fossil remains and pollen were recovered in the excavated sections. Pollen analysis allowed recognition of two pollen zones, the first being characterised by a Quercus-Carya mixed deciduous forest which was probably present in the plain and on the slopes surrounding the Caudina valley basin. The transition to pollen zone 2 clearly records a drastic decrease in Carya pollen grains and the contemporary increase in herbs and Pinus. A more open environment established around the river shores due to a climate shift towards dryer conditions. Most of the vertebrate remains {{were found in the}} upper portion of the succession corresponding to pollen zone 2. The fossil mammal assemblage includes Hippopotamus antiquus, Axis eurygonos, Praemegaceros sp., Equus suessenbornensis and Stephanorhinus cf. S. hundsheimensis. In addition, a partial unerupted molar of an elephantid (tentatively attributed to Mammuthus meridionalis), two hyena coprolites and fragments of rodent teeth were identified. The high amount of Carya in pollen zone 1 represents the most peculiar feature of the Saticula floral record and was used as a reference for its chronological constrain. In fact, comparison with other Italian pollen sequences allowed the Saticula record to be tentatively ascribed to the late Early Pleistocene. After that period, Carya was never recorded in so high amounts and gradually disappeared from the Italian flora following a <b>heterochronous</b> latitudinal gradient. The Saticula mammal assemblage is in agreement with the chronological framework suggested by pollen data...|$|E
40|$|Megalospheric {{forms of}} Western Tethyan late Bartonian to late Priabonian {{involute}} Heterostegina from numerous locali− ties, marking different ecological conditions, were morphometrically investigated. They belong to three species, H. armenica, H. reticulata, and H. gracilis {{based on the}} presence/absence of granulation, on the chamberlet characteristics and on the relative size of proloculus. Within these species a very rapid evolution could be observed in {{the reduction of the}} num− ber of operculinid chambers, in the increase of the number of chamberlets and partially in the increase of the proloculus size. This evolution is demonstrated by stratigraphic superpositions in several localities (especially in the Mossano section), and is supported also by the change of co−occurring fossils, starting with the disappearance of large−sized Nummulites, then fol− lowed by the appearance of the genus Spiroclypeus and then by the disappearance of orthophragmines of middle Eocene acme. Based on the reduction of operculinid chambers, two chronosubspecies of Heterostegina armenica and seven of H. reticulata are defined biometrically (four of them: H. armenica tigrisensis, H. reticulata tronensis, H. r. hungarica, and H. r. mossanensis are introduced here). This allows to subdivide the Shallow Benthic Zone (SBZ) 18 into three and SBZ 19 into two subzones. The extremely rapid evolution of H. reticulata allows to calibrate larger foraminiferal events around the mid− dle/late Eocene boundary. The extinction of large−sized Nummulites seems to be <b>heterochronous</b> in the late Bartonian in hav− ing migrated eastward, while the first appearance of Spiroclypeus is shown to be synchronous {{at the base of the}} Priabonian. The middle/upper Eocene (= Bartonian/Priabonian) boundary is to be placed at the base of the Priabona marls in th...|$|E
