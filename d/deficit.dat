We {{were interested in}} comparing the <b>deficits</b> identified in SAH patients, including cognitive <b>deficits,</b> at discharge by neurosurgeons and <b>deficits</b> identified by neurologists upon admission to the rehabilitation unit on the same day. The assessment of <b>deficits</b> might {{have an impact on}} referring patients to rehabilitation. This retrospective study included 494 SAH patients treated between 2005 and 2010. Of these, 50 patients were discharged to an affiliated rehabilitation unit. <b>Deficits</b> were grouped into 18 categories and summarized into three groups: major somatic, minor somatic, and cognitive <b>deficits.</b> Major somatic <b>deficits</b> were identified in 16 and 20 patients (p = 0. 53), minor somatic <b>deficits</b> in 16 and 44 (p < 0. 0001) patients, and cognitive <b>deficits</b> in 36 and 45 (p < 0. 04) patients by neurosurgeons and neurologists, respectively.

Obama and the Congressional Budget Office predicted the 2010 budget <b>deficit</b> would be $1.5trillion or 10.6% of the nation's gross domestic product (GDP) compared to the 2009 <b>deficit</b> of $1.4trillion or 9.9% of GDP.

The most recent increase in the U.S. debt ceiling to $17.2trillion took effect in February 2014. On August 2, 2011, after a lengthy congressional debate over whether to raise the nation's debt limit, Obama signed the bipartisan Budget Control Act of 2011. The legislation enforces limits on discretionary spending until 2021, establishes a procedure to increase the debt limit, creates a Congressional Joint Select Committee on <b>Deficit</b> Reduction to propose further <b>deficit</b> reduction with a stated goal of achieving at least $1.5trillion in budgetary savings over 10 years, and establishes automatic procedures for reducing spending by as much as $1.2trillion if legislation originating with the new joint select committee does not achieve such savings.

40|$|Introduction. Although {{there is}} some {{evidence}} that Theory of Mind (ToM) <b>deficits</b> may be trait markers of schizophrenia it is not clear yet if ToM <b>deficits</b> are primary <b>deficits,</b> that is, to be independent of <b>deficits</b> in general intellectual abilities and executive function. The aim was to examine if ToM <b>deficits</b> may be trait markers of the illness and the effect of cognitive inhibition, general intellectual abilities and depression on ToM abilities of patients with schizophrenia and their unaffected parents. Methods. We assessed ToM abilities (first-order and second-order ToM stories, The Revised Eyes Test), cognitive inhibition (Stroop Task), general intellectual ability (Standard Progressive Matrices Test Plus) in patients with schizophrenia (N= 21) and their unaffected fathers (N= 21) and mothers (N= 21) in comparison with healthy control families (healthy control males, N= 21, healthy control fathers, N= 21, healthy control mothers, N= 21) Results. Patients showed <b>deficits</b> in first-order ToM tasks but some of these <b>deficits</b> were mediated by general intellectual abilities. Impairments in cognitive inhibition mediated only patients performance in The Revised Eyes Test. Patients showed <b>deficits</b> in second-order ToM stories independently of <b>deficits</b> in general intellectual abilities and cognitive inhibition. Unaffected parents did not show <b>deficits</b> in first-order ToM tasks, whereas they showed <b>deficits</b> in second-order ToM stories. However, the <b>deficits</b> that unaffected parents showed in second-order ToM stories were mediated by their <b>deficits</b> in general intellectual abilities, and there was an effect of remitted depression on the unaffected mothers performance. Conclusions. The results suggest that intact neurocognitive and general intellectual abilities are necessary in order patients and their unaffected parents to pass successfully ToM tasks. Patients and their unaffected parents show ToM <b>deficits</b> but these <b>deficits</b> are not similar. Patients show ToM <b>deficits</b> but these <b>deficits</b> seem to be a component of the pathophysiology of the illness (e. g., <b>deficits</b> in executive function, general intellectual abilities). © 2012 Copyright Psychology Press Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
