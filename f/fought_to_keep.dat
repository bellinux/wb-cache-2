5|$|Bakshi's frustrations {{with his}} failing {{marriage}} {{and the state of}} the planet further drove his need to animate. In 1959, he moved his desk to join the rest of the animators; after asking Rasinski for material to animate, he received layouts of two scenes: a hat floating on water and Deputy Dawg, the lead character of one of Terrytoons' syndicated television series, running. Despite threats of repercussion from the animators' union, Rasinski <b>fought</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> Bakshi as a layout artist. Bakshi began to see Rasinski as a father figure; Rasinski, childless, was happy to serve as Bakshi's mentor.|$|E
5|$|Founded in 1942 as a company, {{the unit}} {{consisted}} mainly of Yugoslav Volksdeutsche and recruits from South Tyrol. Although focused on anti-partisan operations, it also saw {{action in the}} wake of the Italian surrender when it moved to disarm Italian troops in Tarvisio and protect ethnic German communities in Italy. In addition, at the end of the war it successfully <b>fought</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> passes into Austria open, allowing German units to escape the Balkans and surrender to British forces. The remnants of the unit became some of the last Germans to lay down their arms when they surrendered to the British 6th Armoured Division on 9 May 1945.|$|E
5|$|On Nørregade, another {{fire started}} at a brewery Wednesday evening – {{possibly}} between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. Just {{prior to that}} the original fire had reached Gammeltorv, where people <b>fought</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the fire back. For that reason, help was sent late {{to deal with the}} new fire. Around midnight the wind shifted to the west, and the situation on Nørregade turned critical as the fire was driven towards the street along a wide front. At first people sought to keep the fire on the western side of Nørregade, but nevertheless it spread to the eastern side during the night. Simultaneously, the fire moved from present day Nørre Voldgade towards Nørreport (North Gate).|$|E

50|$|Ms Clarke {{should have}} <b>fought</b> harder <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> her partner in Christchurch and not left the marae when {{conversation}} {{between the two}} sides became heated. If she wanted her husband to stay there, she should have stayed there, irrespective of what happened.|$|R
50|$|After {{the death}} of Matej Ninoslav in 1250, the {{question}} of power over Bosnia was initiated. Ninoslav's sons <b>fought</b> valiantly <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> Bosnia independent, but eventually King Béla IV of Hungary martially subjected Bosnia and implaced Prijezda as its Ban, who vouched to rule in Hungary's name.|$|R
5|$|After {{the home}} {{was placed on the}} National Register of Historic Places in 1974 (the result of an {{application}} by an Eldon farmer), the owner refurbished the house, installing an indoor bathroom and electricity and restoring the windows and wallpaper. Local politicians believed such work coupled with a new museum and education center could provide a major boost to local tourism—one state senator hoped for as many as 100,000 visitors per year. After the house's owner eventually turned over the property to the State Historical Society of Iowa in 1991, an effort was made to move the house to Living History Farms outside Des Moines, but Eldonians <b>fought</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> it within their city limits. The house was renovated in 1992, with boosters hoping to see the house become a pop-culture tourism attraction, much like the Field of Dreams site in similarly rural Dyersville. Today the American Gothic House Center hosts approximately 15,000 visitors per year, which does not account for additional after-hours visitors.|$|E
5|$|By 1864 {{the company}} was {{operating}} a fleet of at least four ships - the Kiama was still in service, {{and she had been}} joined by Hunter, Mynora and Kembla. Both Kembla, a 204-ton iron steamship, and Hunter, a paddle steamer with a net weight of 105 tons, were built in Glasgow, Scotland. The Mynora was built in Australia at Prymont in Sydney. A 117-ton wooden paddle steamer, her time with the company ended in 1864 after she ran into St Georges Head in Wreck Bay. In an attempt to save the lives of passengers and crew, the captain <b>fought</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the ship afloat until she finally ran aground on a sandy beach approximately three miles from the headland. While the boat was lost, all of the passengers and crew on Mynora were saved.|$|E
5|$|Cernan {{turned down}} the {{opportunity}} {{to walk on the}} Moon as Lunar Module Pilot of Apollo 16, preferring to risk missing a flight altogether for the opportunity to command his own mission. After the cancellation of Apollo 18, NASA decided to send a scientist, Harrison Schmitt, to the Moon. This decision meant the original Lunar Module (LM) pilot, Joe Engle, never had the opportunity to walk on the Moon. Cernan <b>fought</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> his crew together; however, public pressure from the scientific community cemented Schmitt's position on the crew. Even though Cernan wanted to keep his crew together, he had a positive evaluation of Schmitt's abilities. For example, he believed Schmitt was an outstanding LM pilot and that Engle was merely an adequate one.|$|E
50|$|In 1955 Fr. Zabelka was {{transferred}} to Sacred Heart Parish in Flint, Michigan, with notification from the Bishop that the parish would soon close. He <b>fought</b> successfully <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the church and parochial school open for black children, despite major objections {{from a variety of}} sources and an ongoing struggle over finances.|$|R
50|$|The old pragmatists {{naturally}} {{balked at}} the prospect of turning their lucrative cash-making enterprise into a quixotic venture for holy glory. Court pragmatists like D. Diogo Lobo, Baron of Alvito, the powerful vedor da fazenda, <b>fought</b> hard <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the India armadas from being diverted into messianic pursuits by Duarte Galvão's clique.|$|R

5|$|Filming began October 2000. From {{the onset}} of filming, {{difficulties}} with the studio slowed the film's development and caused a rift between the director and Universal Pictures, as executives were unhappy with the film's pacing, emphasis on small scale action sequences, and the general relationship between themselves and Liman, who was suspicious of direct studio involvement. A number of reshoots and rewrites late in development, plus scheduling problems, delayed the film from its original release target date of September 2001 to June 2002 and took it $8,000,000 over budget from the initial budget of $60 million; screenwriter Tony Gilroy faxed elements of screenplay rewrites almost throughout the entire duration of filming. A particular point of contention {{with regard to the}} original Gilroy script were the scenes set in the farmhouse near the film's conclusion. Liman and Matt Damon <b>fought</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the scenes in the film after they were excised in a third-act rewrite that was insisted upon by the studio. Liman and Damon argued that, though the scenes were low key, they were integral to the audience's understanding of the Bourne character and the film's central themes. The farmhouse sequence consequently went through many rewrites from its original incarnation before its inclusion in the final product.|$|E
5|$|The director's {{original}} cut of Sholay has {{a different}} ending in which Thakur kills Gabbar, along with some additional violent scenes. Gabbar's death scene, and the scene in which the imam's son is killed, were cut from the film by India's Censor Board, as was the scene in which Thakur's family is massacred. The Censor Board {{was concerned about the}} violence, and that viewers may be influenced to violate the law by punishing people severely. Although Sippy <b>fought</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the scenes, eventually he had to re-shoot the ending of the film, and as directed by the Censor Board, have the police arrive just before Thakur can kill Gabbar. The censored theatrical version was the only one seen by audiences for fifteen years. The original, unedited cut of the film finally came out in a British release on VHS in 1990. Since then, Eros International has released two versions on DVD. The director's cut of the film preserves the original full frame and is 204minutes in length; the censored widescreen version is 198minutes long.|$|E
25|$|Although the NWA wanted Nelson and Sbraccia to {{tour the}} various NWA territories to defend the championship, Rumble <b>fought</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the titles in New England. Their run as the tag team champions is {{considered}} one of the high points in NWA New England's history. On February 18, 1999, Knuckles Nelson also won the NWA New England Heavyweight Championship from Trooper Gilmore in Mansfield, Massachusetts.|$|E
60|$|The {{secret of}} the matter was that the cattle kings of that section {{controlled}} everything, and as the grazing land of the territory was worth {{hundreds of thousands of}} dollars <b>to</b> them they <b>fought</b> desperately <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the pioneers out, delaying, in every manner possible, legislation which tended to make the section an absolutely free one to would-be settlers.|$|R
50|$|Renée {{was born}} on 25 October 1510 at the Château de Blois, Blois, Touraine and was the second {{daughter}} of Louis XII of France and Anne of Brittany. Anne, who had always <b>fought</b> fiercely <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> Brittany independent of the French crown, tried to will the duchy to Renée, but Louis disagreed, so the Duchy passed to her elder sister, Claude.|$|R
50|$|While {{the works}} of Nuniz speak very lowly of Achyuta Deva Raya as being a king given to vices and cruelty, there is enough {{evidence}} {{to prove that the}} king was indeed noteworthy in his own right and <b>fought</b> hard <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the prosperity of the kingdom alive. He had been handpicked by Krishna Deva Raya himself as an able successor.|$|R
25|$|The {{decision}} was put off {{due to the}} varied national positions preventing a unanimous decision. Luxembourg <b>fought</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the ECSC or have compensation, France fought for Strasbourg and Italy, initially backing Paris, fought for any Italian city to thwart Luxembourg and Strasbourg. Meanwhile, Parliament passed a series of resolutions complaining about the whole situation of spreading itself across three cities, though unable {{to do anything about}} it.|$|E
25|$|As the Democrats were {{grappling}} {{with their own}} troubles, leaders in the Republican party <b>fought</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> elected members focused {{on the issue of}} slavery in the West, which allowed them to mobilize popular support. Chase wrote Sumner that if the conservatives succeeded, it might be necessary to recreate the Free Soil Party. He was also particularly disturbed by the tendency of many Republicans to eschew moral attacks on slavery for political and economic arguments.|$|E
25|$|Historically, local {{residents}} and preservation {{groups have been}} concerned about development in the Village and have fought to preserve its architectural and historic integrity. In the 1960s, Margot Gayle led a group of citizens to preserve the Jefferson Market Courthouse (later reused as Jefferson Market Library) while other citizen groups <b>fought</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> traffic out of Washington Square Park, and Jane Jacobs, using the Village {{as an example of}} a vibrant urban community, advocated to keep it that way.|$|E
50|$|Demographics {{changed and}} during the early 1990s Lathlain's only civil structure, its local primary school, was {{earmarked}} for closure by the education minister at the time Norman Moore, due to low student enrolments. Students, parents and locals <b>fought</b> hard <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the school open and their cries were heard. The school now has a healthy enrolment aided by the onsite pre-primary and better facilities.|$|R
50|$|The Liberals who had <b>fought</b> hard <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> {{the seat}} in the {{by-election}} hatched a plan to team up with the Conservatives. The two parties held a joint nomination meeting to run a candidate under both banners in the district. The party members nominated Angus McDonald a popular rancher residing in the district to oppose Moore and support the administration of Premier Charles Stewart.|$|R
50|$|The school {{suffered}} from declining pupil numbers {{in its last}} years and closed {{in the summer of}} 2007. The remaining pupils were relocated to either Abersychan Comprehensive School or West Monmouth School. Many residents of Trevethin were bitter about the school's closure and <b>fought</b> hard <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> it open, but to no avail. Trevethin itself is an economically deprived district of Pontypool and this has affected the school's fate.|$|R
25|$|After the Apollo program concluded, Greene {{spent two}} years as a Range Safety Coordinator, {{planning}} the procedures that would be followed if something went wrong with the trajectory of the Space Shuttle during launch. He <b>fought</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the Shuttle from being fitted with a range safety destruct system, which would {{allow it to be}} destroyed remotely from the ground. However, he was not successful and believes that he was removed from the position {{as a result of his}} stand on the issue.|$|E
25|$|The loss of {{this vital}} line of communication; while not fatal in itself, {{was a serious}} blow {{to the ability of}} Army Group Kempf, to defend the city from the {{constant}} Red Army attacks. This meant critical delays of supplies and reinforcements, and the unit's position was becoming increasingly untenable. The way to Poltava now remained open, but Vatutin hesitated to push through while the Germans flanking the gap held firm. Instead, he turned his left flank armies; the 5th Guards Tank Army and the 5th Guards Army, against the western front of Army Group Kempf where the 2nd and 3rd SS Panzer Divisions <b>fought</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the front angled south westward away from Kharkov.|$|E
25|$|During {{the seventeenth}} century, about sixty French {{families}} {{were established in}} Acadia. They developed friendly relations with the Wabanaki Confederacy (particularly the Mi'kmaq), learning their hunting and fishing techniques. The Acadians lived mainly in the coastal regions of the Bay of Fundy; farming land reclaimed from the sea through diking. Living in a contested borderland region between French Quebec and British territories, the Acadians often became entangled in {{the conflict between the}} powers. Over a period of seventy-four years, six wars took place in Acadia and Nova Scotia in which the Confederacy and some Acadians <b>fought</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the British from taking over the region (See the four French and Indian Wars as well as Father Rale's War and Father Le Loutre's War).|$|E
5000|$|In 1964, the Surgeon General's {{report on}} [...] "Smoking and Health" [...] came out. This report helped the {{government}} to regulate the advertisement and sales of cigarettes. The 1960s {{as a whole was}} a time when many of the health hazards of smoking were reported. However, the companies that made these cigarettes <b>fought</b> hard <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the public buying their products. It wasn't until 1971 the television ads for cigarettes were taken off the air in the U.S.|$|R
50|$|From {{the time}} of {{independence}} of the United States, that country expanded rapidly to the west, acquiring the massive Louisiana territory in 1803. Between 1810 and 1811 a Native confederacy under Tecumseh <b>fought</b> unsuccessfully <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the Americans from pushing {{them out of the}} Great Lakes. Tecumseh's followers then went north into Canada, where they helped the British to block an American attempt to seize Canada during the War of 1812. Following the war, British and Irish settlement in Canada increased dramatically.|$|R
50|$|Finally, {{they reached}} Cusco. The staff {{sank into the}} ground. Before they arrived, Mama Ocllo had already borne Ayar Manco a child, Sinchi Roca. The people who were already living in Cusco <b>fought</b> hard <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> their land, but Mama Huaca was a good fighter. When the enemy attacked, she threw her bolas (several stones tied {{together}} that spun through the air when thrown) at a soldier (gualla) and killed him instantly. The other people became afraid and ran away.|$|R
25|$|By {{the end of}} the 15th {{century the}} Ottoman Empire had {{advanced}} all over Southeastern Europe, eventually conquering the Byzantine Empire and extending control over the Balkan states. Hungary was the last bastion of the Latin Christian world in the East, and <b>fought</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> its rule over a period of two centuries. After the tragic death of the young king Vladislaus I of Hungary during the Battle of Varna in 1444 against the Ottomans, the Kingdom was placed in the hands of count John Hunyadi, who became Hungary's regent-governor (1446–1453). Hunyadi was {{considered one of the most}} relevant military figures of the 15th century: Pope Pius II awarded him the title of Athleta Christi or Champion of Christ for being the only hope of resisting the Ottomans from advancing to Central and Western Europe.|$|E
25|$|Haig thought Robertson (who {{had begun}} his {{military}} {{career as a}} private) egotistical and not “a gentleman” and was unhappy at the way Robertson had allowed divisions to be diverted to other fronts, {{even though he had}} in fact <b>fought</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> such diversions to a minimum. Although Haig had been suspicious of Henry Wilson, they gradually established a warily respectful relationship, and interactions were socially more smooth than they had been with Robertson, with whom Haig had never been on first-name terms. Haig noted (diary 25 February) that as CIGS Wilson was no longer keen on diverting efforts to other fronts, nor on Rawlinson building up a strong staff at Versailles. Haig's callousness towards Robertson and Derby, his equals, has been compared unfavourably to the care with which he tried to protect the interests of his subordinates Charteris and Kiggell.|$|E
25|$|Under the {{military}} leadership of Toussaint, the forces made up mostly of former slaves succeeded in winning concessions from the British and expelling the Spanish forces. In the end, Toussaint essentially restored control of Saint-Domingue to France. Louverture was very intelligent, organized and articulate. Having made himself {{master of the}} island, however, Toussaint {{did not wish to}} surrender too much power to France. He began to rule the country as an effectively autonomous entity. Louverture overcame a succession of local rivals, including: the Commissioner Sonthonax, a French white man who gained support from many Haitians, angering Louverture; André Rigaud, a free man of color who <b>fought</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> control of the South in the War of Knives; and Comte d'Hédouville. Hédouville forced a fatal wedge between Rigaud and Louverture before he escaped to France. Toussaint defeated a British expeditionary force in 1798. In addition, he led an invasion of neighboring Santo Domingo (December 1800), and freed the slaves there on January 3, 1801.|$|E
50|$|Drakengard 2 {{takes place}} in an unnamed land nearly two decades after the events of Drakengard. In the {{original}} game, two powers, the Empire and the Union, {{were engaged in a}} religious war over the Seals, magical bindings tied to a chosen Goddess of the Seal that kept dark entities known as the Watchers from appearing in the mortal world and destroying humanity. Caught up in the conflict were Caim and Angelus, a human and a dragon who had made a pact (a magical ritual that linked their souls), and <b>fought</b> <b>to</b> try <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> both the Seals and the Goddess safe. Though they ultimately failed, Angelus became the new seal, averting the end of the world. Eighteen years later, the Seals are protected by the Knights of the Seal, who eventually grow to become a dominating force in the land.|$|R
50|$|This game {{looked to}} be a great match-up from the tip. The teams traded buckets and had three ties and four lead changes within the first threeminutes of the game. However, the East Team grabbed the lead at 8-6 and kept it the {{remainder}} of the game. The West Squad <b>fought</b> hard <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the lead <b>to</b> single digits and had it down to a two-point game late in the second period, but they couldn’t overcome a 14 rebound deficit and 52% shooting from the East Team.|$|R
5000|$|However, council {{still felt}} that Hopkins had {{acquired}} too much control and removed him from office in January 1930. His replacement was Daniel E. Morgan, {{the second and}} final city manager of Cleveland. In 1931, Hopkins {{became a member of}} council again and <b>fought</b> unsuccessfully <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the city manager system. However, it was soon overturned and the city returned to a mayor-council government. In 1933, Hopkins retired from politics. In his honor, the Cleveland Municipal Airport was renamed Cleveland Hopkins International Airport in 1951.|$|R
