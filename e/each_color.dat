5|$|Any Penrose tiling has local {{pentagonal}} symmetry, in {{the sense}} that there are points in the tiling surrounded by a symmetric configuration of tiles: such configurations have fivefold rotational symmetry about the center point, as well as five mirror lines of reflection symmetry passing through the point, a dihedral symmetry group. This symmetry will generally preserve only a patch of tiles around the center point, but the patch can be very large: Conway and Penrose proved that whenever the colored curves on the P2 or P3 tilings close in a loop, the region within the loop has pentagonal symmetry, and furthermore, in any tiling, there are at most two such curves of <b>each</b> <b>color</b> that do not close up.|$|E

5|$|The {{official}} chess {{rules do}} not include a procedure for determining who plays White. Instead, this decision is left open to tournament-specific rules (e.g. a Swiss system tournament or Round-robin tournament) or, {{in the case of}} non-competitive play, mutual agreement, in which case some kind of random choice is often employed. A common method is for one player to conceal a piece (usually a pawn) of <b>each</b> <b>color</b> in either hand; the other player chooses a hand to open, and receives the color of the piece that is revealed.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Warhol began {{producing}} {{his first}} canvases, which he based on comic strip subjects. In late 1961, {{he learned the}} process of silkscreening from Floriano Vecchi, who had run the Tiber Press since 1953. Though the process generally begins with a stencil drawing, it often evolves from a blown up photograph which is then transferred with glue onto silk. In either case, one needs to produce a glue-based version of a positive two-dimensional image (positive means that open spaces are left where the paint will appear). Usually, the ink is rolled across the medium so that it passes through the silk and not the glue. Campbell's Soup cans were among Warhol's first silkscreen productions; the first were U.S. dollar bills. The pieces were made from stencils; one for <b>each</b> <b>color.</b> Warhol did not begin to convert photographs to silkscreens until after the original series of Campbell's Soup cans had been produced.|$|E

40|$|Orthodontic {{elastomeric}} {{chains are}} commercially available from many manufacturers. Objective: This study investigated effects of manufacturing factors on dynamic force delivery and viscoelastic properties of elastomeric chains from three manufacturers using {{dynamic mechanical analysis}} (DMA). Methods: Three popular colors (clear, silver/gray, black) of elastomeric chains were obtained from three manufacturers (GAC, RMO, 3 M Unitek). The dimensions for nine specimens of <b>each</b> <b>colored</b> brand (N= 81) were measured, and DMA was performed at eight frequencies (0. 125, 0. 25, 0. 5, 1. 0, 2. 0, 4. 0, 8. 0, and 16. 0 Hz). Five DMA variables [storage stiffness (K'), loss stiffness (K''), Tan δ, and damping (C) ] were analyzed using repeated-measures ANOVA and pairwise t-tests, comparing all frequencies for <b>each</b> <b>colored</b> brand (Bonferroni correction) and all <b>colored</b> brands for <b>each</b> frequency (step-wise Bonferroni correction). Significance was set at α= 0. 05. Results: Significant differences were found among means of all four measured specimen dimensions. Comparing the five mean DMA variables for <b>each</b> <b>colored</b> brand, values for nearly all frequencies iii differed from one another. Comparing the mean DMA variables for each frequency, significant differences were also found for all variables and frequencies. Conclusions: Multiple manufacturing factors likely combine to affect dynamic force delivery and viscoelastic properties of elastomeric chains. Further research investigating clinical performance is recommended. i...|$|R

We show that this theorem is close in computational strength to standard Ramsey's theorem by giving arithmetical upper and lower bounds for solutions to computable instances. In reverse mathematics, we show that that this packed Ramsey's theorem is equivalent to Ramsey's theorem for exponents not equal to 2. When n= 2, we show that it implies Ramsey's theorem, and that it does not imply ACA_ 0. Comment: 26 pages, 1 figur...|$|R
