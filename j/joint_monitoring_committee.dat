40|$|Thesis (M. Art. et Scien. (Town and Regional Planning)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2010. A {{thorough}} investigation of legislation {{involved in the}} land reform programme was conducted. This includes the Constitution of South Africa, {{as well as the}} legal frameworks that manage the land reform process. Many of the unintended results are because of misunderstandings. This study sought to clarify those misunderstandings and confusing language. The South African land reform process was excellently planned. The process is managed in three phases, namely land restitution, land redistribution and land tenure. There are some successes and failures due to the way those programmes were implemented. In order to implement and manage the land reform programmes and spatial planning on national, provincial and district level, the following plans were introduced: National Level: Pro-active Land Acquisition Strategy (PLAS) & Area-based Planning Provincial Level: Limpopo Growth and Development Strategy (LGDS) District Level: Mopani Integrated Development Plan Local Level: Greater Tzaneen Municipality Integrated Development Plan & Spatial Development Framework The study area, the Tzaneen Local Municipality, was chosen because it is home to some of the first land reform projects in South Africa, it is the district with some of the highest intensity of land claims and it offers a complete menu of land reform programmes in an advanced state on a small area. The impact that land reform has had on the spatial development in the Tzaneen Local Municipality has been studied in more detail. As the study progressed, it was realised that the impact not only stops at spatial development. The influence was much bigger than that. The local economy was affected, as were job opportunities, tourism, food security, the retail industry and even the mining industry. Such an impact is also not restricted to the Tzaneen Local Municipality. In order to control the land reform process, the government should involve the private sector in the land reform process. The moment this happens, the skills and experience locked in the private sector are transferred to the government for the benefit of all people involved in and influenced by the land reform process. An Integrated Land Reform Action Forum (ILRAF) must be established that manages the land reform process on national, provincial and local level. This ILRAF has to fulfil much the same purpose as the former <b>Joint</b> <b>Monitoring</b> <b>Committees</b> (JMCs) accomplished. The ILRAF must consist of all role-players within the land reform process. These include, national, provincial and local government officials, commercial farmers, key role-players from the private sector, farm worker representatives, Agri-SA, professionals such as town and regional planners and transfer attorneys, farmers? associations, commercial banks and the media to ensure transparency. In order to correct past mistakes and to ensure that the next five years of the land reform process goes off without a hitch, it is important to involve all role-players and ensure transparency throughout all decision-making processes. Key Terms: Land Reform; Agri-village; Area Based Planning; Land Restitution; Land Redistribution; Land Tenure Reform; Greater Tzaneen Municipality; Willing buyer-willing seller; Spatial Development Framework; Integrated Development Plan.

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of data monitoring {{and the need}} for the use of data <b>monitoring</b> <b>committees</b> in clinical trials sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry differ from those of trials sponsored by government. Data monitoring is a continuous process in industry trials due to the regulatory requirements and the need to more thoroughly evaluate safety of new compounds. As part of this process, interim analyses are employed to make decisions about treatment effects. In some cases, such analyses may require the use of an external data <b>monitoring</b> <b>committee</b> to assist in the data review, analysis and decision making. A number of examples of interim analyses, with and without data <b>monitoring</b> <b>committees,</b> are discussed. Issues surrounding the need for external data <b>monitoring</b> <b>committees</b> and recommendations are presented. In particular the issues of sponsor participation in the data <b>monitoring</b> <b>committee</b> and controls of the decision making process are considered...|$|R

25|$|A triple-blind {{study is}} an {{extension}} of the double-blind design; the <b>monitoring</b> <b>committee</b> response variables is not told the identity of the groups. The committee is simply given data for groups A and B. A triple-blind study has the theoretical advantage of allowing the <b>monitoring</b> <b>committee</b> to evaluate the response variable results more objectively. This assumes that appraisal of efficacy and harm, as well as requests for special analyses, may be biased if group identity is known. However, in a trial where the <b>monitoring</b> <b>committee</b> has an ethical responsibility to ensure participant safety, such a design may be counterproductive since in this case monitoring is often guided by the constellation of trends and their directions. In addition, by the time many <b>monitoring</b> <b>committees</b> receive data, often any emergency situation has long passed.|$|R
