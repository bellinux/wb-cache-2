25|$|The then current {{theory of}} colour held that white light was elementary, and that colours arose from {{mixtures}} {{of light and}} dark. Newton criticised this theory by noting that in that case a printed page, with its juxtaposition of light and dark, would look coloured. <b>In</b> <b>folio</b> 122 he recorded {{for the first time}} his notion that white light is heterogeneous and colour arise, not through the modification of a homogeneous white light, but from the separation of this mixture into its components. Newton also mentions Hooke's theory of colour, including his idea that it is a wave. Newton dismisses this theory with the remark that then light should bend around edges of objects as sounds does.|$|E

[...] Also in that year, Curll was sent to jail for publishing an account of the trial of the Earl of Wintoun. [...] No sooner was he out than he produced a biography of Dr. Robert South, former head of Westminster School. [...] He had printed the eulogy for Dr. South by the current school head, as well. [...] He was invited to the school and expected to be honored for the work he had done on behalf of the memory of the school's masters. [...] Instead, the students forced him to his knees by beatings and forced him to beg for an apology. [...] They then wrapped him in a blanket and began beating him with sticks and tossing him in the air. [...] Samuel Wesley, a student at the school and older brother to John Wesley, wrote a mock-heroic poem on the blanket incident. [...] Curll suspected that Pope and his friends were somehow responsible for his treatment, and he began to employ the [...] "phantom poet." [...] He published a poem called [...] "The Petticoat" [...] by [...] "J. Gay." [...] This poet was Francis Chute, who used the pseudonym [...] "Joseph Gay." [...] To siphon off sales of John Gay's poems and to wound Pope and his friends, Curll used this phantom twice more.|$|E
