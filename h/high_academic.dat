5|$|Constantine {{first went}} to the St Ann's Government School in Port of Spain, then {{attended}} St Ann's Roman Catholic School until 1917. He displayed little enthusiasm for learning and never reached a <b>high</b> <b>academic</b> standard, but showed prowess at several sports and was respected for his cricketing lineage. He played for the school cricket team, which he captained in his last two years, by which time he was developing a reputation as an attacking batsman, a good fast-medium bowler and an excellent fielder. His father prohibited him from playing competitive club cricket until 1920 for fear of premature exposure to top-class opposition while too young; in addition, he first wanted his son to establish a professional career. Upon leaving school Constantine joined Jonathan Ryan, a firm of solicitors in Port of Spain, as a clerk. This was a possible route into the legal profession; however, {{as a member of}} the black lower-middle class, he was unlikely to progress far. Few black Trinidadians at this time became solicitors, and he faced many social restrictions owing to his colour.|$|E

25|$|Peer-reviewed {{research}} undertaken {{since then}} has not validated previous assumptions. Recent research indicates that inflating students' self-esteem {{in and of itself}} has no positive effect on grades.

The relationship involving self-esteem and academic results does not signify that high self-esteem contributes to <b>high</b> <b>academic</b> results. It simply means that high self-esteem may be accomplished as a result of <b>high</b> <b>academic</b> performance due to the other variables of social interactions and life events affecting this performance.|$|E
