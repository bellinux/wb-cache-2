40|$|Drought is {{the most}} serious abiotic stress {{limiting}} rice production, and <b>deep</b> <b>root</b> is the key contributor to drought avoidance. However, the genetic mechanism regulating the development of <b>deep</b> <b>roots</b> is largely unknown. In this study, the transcriptomes of 74 root samples from 37 rice varieties, representing the extreme genotypes of shallow or <b>deep</b> <b>rooting,</b> were surveyed by RNA-seq. The 13, 242 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between <b>deep</b> <b>rooting</b> and shallow rooting varieties (H vs. L) were enriched in the pathway of genetic information processing and metabolism, while the 1, 052 DEGs between the <b>deep</b> <b>roots</b> and shallow roots from each of the plants (D vs. S) were significantly enriched in metabolic pathways especially energy metabolism. Ten quantitative trait transcripts (QTTs) were identified and some were involved in energy metabolism. Forty-nine candidate DEGs were confirmed by qRT-PCR and microarray. Through weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), we found 18 hub genes. Surprisingly, all these hub genes expressed higher in <b>deep</b> <b>roots</b> than in shallow roots, furthermore half of them functioned in energy metabolism. We also estimated that the ATP production in the <b>deep</b> <b>roots</b> was faster than shallow roots. Our results provided a lot of reliable candidate genes to improve <b>deep</b> <b>rooting,</b> and firstly highlight the importance of energy metabolism to the development of <b>deep</b> <b>roots...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background <b>Deep</b> <b>roots</b> are {{a common}} trait among {{a wide range of}} plant species and biomes, and are pivotal to the very {{existence}} of ecosystem services such as pedogenesis, groundwater and streamflow regulation, soil carbon sequestration and moisture content in the lower troposphere. Notwithstanding the growing realization of the functional significance of <b>deep</b> <b>roots</b> across disciplines such as soil science, agronomy, hydrology, ecophysiology or climatology, research efforts allocated to the study of <b>deep</b> <b>roots</b> remain incommensurate with those devoted to shallow roots. This {{is due in part to}} the fact that, despite technological advances, observing and measuring <b>deep</b> <b>roots</b> remains challenging. Scope Here, other reasons that explain why there are still so many fundamental unresolved questions related to <b>deep</b> <b>roots</b> are discussed. These include the fact that a number of hypotheses and models that are widely considered as verified and sufficiently robust are only partly supported by data. Evidence has accumulated that <b>deep</b> <b>rooting</b> could be a more widespread and important trait among plants than usually considered based on the share of biomass that it represents. Examples that indicate that plant roots have different structures and play different roles with respect to major biochemical cycles depending on their position within the soil profile are also examined and discussed. Conclusions Current knowledge gaps are identified and new lines of research for improving our understanding of the processes that drive <b>deep</b> <b>root</b> growth and functioning are proposed. This ultimately leads to a reflection on an alternative paradigm that could be used in the future as a unifying framework to describe and analyse <b>deep</b> <b>rooting.</b> Despite the many hurdles that pave the way to a practical understanding of <b>deep</b> <b>rooting</b> functions, it is anticipated that, in the relatively near future, increased knowledge about the <b>deep</b> <b>rooting</b> traits of a variety of plants and crops will have direct and tangible influence on how we manage natural and cultivated ecosystems...|$|R

Malagkit Pirurutong and Binicol were identified as the two rice accessions with <b>deepest</b> <b>roots</b> through four field experiments conducted at two different locations in West Africa. For these two accessions, root depths reached 35. 6 and 41. 4  cm, respectively, in the first experiment at Bamako; on the other hand, their depths only reached 22. 6 and 18. 6  cm, respectively, {{in the second and third}} experiments at Ibadan, leading to inconsistent genotypic ranking based on root depth between the two locations. However, Malagkit Pirurutong was identified as <b>deep</b> <b>rooting</b> in both locations; in addition, it showed <b>deep</b> <b>rooting</b> in the fourth experiment in a 20 -mm irrigation treatment, even when compared with the <b>deep</b> <b>rooting</b> reference Azucena.

25|$|In 1948, {{there was}} rising {{agitation}} in East Bengal against {{the omission of}} Bengali script from coins, stamps and government exams. Thousands of students, mainly from the University of Dhaka, protested in Dhaka and clashed with security forces. Prominent student leaders including Shamsul Huq, Khaleque Nawaz khan, Shawkat Ali, Kazi Golam Mahboob, Oli Ahad, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and Abdul Wahed were arrested and the police were accused of excessive brutality while charging protesters. In March, senior Bengali political leaders were attacked whilst leading protests demanding that Bengali be declared an official language in Pakistan. The leaders included the A. K. Fazlul Huq, the former Prime Minister of undivided Bengal. Amidst the rising discontent in East Bengal, Jinnah visited Dhaka and announced that Urdu would be sole state language of Pakistan given its significance to Islamic nationalism in South Asia. The announcement caused uproar in East Bengal, where the native Bengali population resented Jinnah for his attempts to impose a language they hardly understood. The resentment was further fuelled by rising discrimination against Bengalis in government, industry, bureaucracy and {{the armed forces and}} the dominance of the Muslim League. The Bengalis argued that they constituted the ethnic majority of Pakistan's population and Urdu was remote to the land of Bengal, located in the eastern Indian Subcontinent. Moreover, the rich literary heritage of the Bengali language and the <b>deep</b> <b>rooted</b> secular culture of Bengali society led to a strong sense of linguistic and cultural nationalism amongst the people of East Bengal. The only significant language in Pakistan not written in the Persian-Arabic script was Bengali. Against this backdrop, Bengali nationalism began to take root within the Muslim League and the party's Bengali members began to rebel.|$|E

40|$|Key message <b>Deep</b> <b>root</b> {{hydraulic}} conductance is upregulated during severe {{drought and}} {{is associated with}} upregulation in aquaporin activity. In 2011, Texas experienced the worst single-year drought in its recorded history and, based on tree-ring data, likely its worst in the past millennium. In the Edwards Plateau of Texas, rainfall was 58 % lower and the mean daily maximum temperatures were > 5 °C higher than long-term means in June through September, resulting in extensive tree mortality. To better understand the balance of <b>deep</b> and shallow <b>root</b> functioning for water supply, we measured root hydraulic conductance (KR) in deep (~ 20 m) and shallow (5 - 10 cm) roots of Quercus fusiformis at four time points {{in the field in}} 2011. <b>Deep</b> <b>roots</b> of Q. fusiformis obtained water from a perennial underground (18 - 20 m) stream that was present even during the drought. As the drought progressed, <b>deep</b> <b>root</b> KR increased 2. 6 -fold from early season values and shallow root KR decreased by 50 % between April and September. Inhibitor studies revealed that aquaporin contribution to KR increased in <b>deep</b> <b>roots</b> and decreased in shallow roots as the drought progressed. <b>Deep</b> <b>root</b> aquaporin activity was upregulated during peak drought, likely driven by increased summer evaporative demand and the need to compensate for declining shallow root KR. A whole-tree hydraulic transport model predicted that trees with greater proportions of <b>deep</b> <b>roots</b> would have as much as five times greater transpiration during drought periods and could sustain transpiration during droughts without experiencing total hydraulic failure. Our results suggest that trees shift their dependence on <b>deep</b> <b>roots</b> versus shallow roots during drought periods, and that upregulation of aquaporin activity accounts for at least part of this increase. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R
