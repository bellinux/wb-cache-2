5|$|Midazolam, {{when taken}} during the third {{trimester}} of pregnancy, may cause risk to the neonate, including benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, with possible symptoms including hypotonia, apnoeic spells, cyanosis, and impaired metabolic responses to cold stress. Symptoms of hypotonia and the neonatal benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome {{have been reported to}} persist from hours to months after birth. Other neonatal withdrawal symptoms include <b>hyperexcitability,</b> tremor, and gastrointestinal upset (diarrhea or vomiting). Breastfeeding by mothers using midazolam is not recommended.|$|E
25|$|Central <b>hyperexcitability</b> is {{important}} for the extent of referred pain.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} {{proposed}} mechanisms for synkinesis: aberrant nerve regeneration, interneuronal ephaptic transmission, and nuclear <b>hyperexcitability.</b>|$|E
25|$|Primary erythromelalgia is {{a better}} {{understood}} autosomal dominant disorder. The neuropathological symptoms of primary erythromelalgia arise from <b>hyperexcitability</b> of C-fibers in the dorsal root ganglion. Specifically, nociceptors (neurons responsible for the sensation and conduction of painful stimuli) {{appear to be the}} primarily affect neurons in these fibers. This <b>hyperexcitability</b> results in the severe burning pain experienced by patients. While the neuropathological symptoms are a result of <b>hyperexcitability,</b> microvascular alterations in erythromelalgia are due to hypoexcitability. The sympathetic nervous system controls cutaneous vascular tone and altered response of this system to stimuli such as heat likely results in the observed microvascular symptoms. In both cases, these changes in excitability are typically due to mutation of the sodium channel NaV1.7. These differences in excitability alterations between the sympathetic nervous system and nociceptors is due to different expression of sodium channels other than NaV1.7 in them.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hyperexcitability</b> hypothesizes that {{referred}} pain has no central mechanism. However, it does {{say that there}} is one central characteristic that predominates. Experiments involving noxious stimuli and recordings from the dorsal horn of animals revealed that {{referred pain}} sensations began minutes after muscle stimulation. Pain was felt in a receptive field that was some distance away from the original receptive field. According to <b>hyperexcitability,</b> new receptive fields are created {{as a result of the}} opening of latent convergent afferent fibers in the dorsal horn. This signal could then be perceived as referred pain.|$|E
25|$|Prevention of neurotransmitter-induced <b>hyperexcitability</b> {{of nerve}} cells, via Kv7.2 channel and AKAP5, may also {{contribute}} to its mechanism. Also, {{it has been shown}} to protect against a seizure-induced reduction in phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3) as a potential therapeutic mechanism.|$|E
25|$|The final type of GEFS+ {{is caused}} by {{mutations}} in the SCN2A gene, which encodes a sodium channel α subunit. The first associated mutation in this gene is R187W, located on the intracellular region linking membrane spanning units two and three in the first domain (D1S2-S3, figure 3). Patients with this mutation have both febrile and afebrile seizures. Electrophysiological examination of this mutant revealed that it increases the time constant for inactivation, presumably increasing sodium current and leading to <b>hyperexcitability.</b> However, this mutation also yields channels that inactivate at more hyperpolarized potentials relative to wild-type channels, indicative of hypoexcitability. Whether the end result on membrane excitability of this mutation is <b>hyperexcitability</b> or hypoexcitability is, as yet, unclear.|$|E
25|$|A second subtype of GEFS+, type 2, is {{the result}} of {{mutations}} in SCN1A, a gene encoding a sodium channel α subunit. There are currently almost 90 known mutations in the SCN1A gene throughout the entirety of the channel (see table 1). These mutations result in almost any imaginable mutation type in the gene, short of duplications. The results of these mutations are highly variable, some producing functional channels while others result in non-functional channels. Some functional channels result in membrane <b>hyperexcitability</b> while others result in hypoexcitability. Most of the functional mutant channels result in <b>hyperexcitability</b> due to decreased frequency dependent rundown. An example of this is the D188V mutation. A 10Hz stimulation of wild-type channels causes current to decrease to approximately 70% of maximum whereas the same stimulation of mutant channels results in rundown to 90% of maximum. This is caused by an expedited recovery from inactivation for mutant channels versus wild-type. The D188V mutant, for example, recovers to 90% maximal current in 200ms while wild-type channels are unable to recover to this degree in >1000ms. Some other functional mutations that lead to <b>hyperexcitability</b> due so by other means, such as decreasing the rate of entrance into the slow inactivated state.|$|E
25|$|Loss of KCC2 {{following}} neuronal damage (i.e. ischemia, {{spinal cord}} damage, physical {{trauma to the}} central nervous system) results {{in the loss of}} inhibitory regulation and the subsequent development of neuronal <b>hyperexcitability,</b> motor spasticity, and seizure-like activity as GABAA receptors and glycine receptors revert from hyperpolarizing to depolarizing postsynaptic effects.|$|E
25|$|Anti-convulsants reduce {{neuronal}} <b>hyperexcitability,</b> effectively targeting Dejerine–Roussy syndrome. Gabapentin and pregabalin are {{the most}} common anti-convulsants. They have significant efficacy in treatment of peripheral and central neuropathic pain. Treatments last 4–12 hours and in general are well tolerated, and the occurrence of adverse events does not differ significantly across patients. Commonly reported side-effects are dizziness, decreased intellectual performance, somnolence, and nausea.|$|E
25|$|Amyotrophic lateral {{sclerosis}} (ALS) affects {{upper and}} lower motor systems, with symptoms ranging from muscle atrophy, hyperreflexia, and fasciculations, all of which suggest increased axonal excitability. Many studies have concluded that abnormally decreased K+ conductance results in axonal depolarization, leading to axonal <b>hyperexcitability</b> and the generation of fasciculation. ALS patients in these studies demonstrated longer strength-duration time constants and lower values for rheobase than in control subjects.|$|E
25|$|SGCs also {{express a}} {{specific}} type of channel, the Kir4.1 channel, which works to maintain the desired low extracellular K+ concentration in order to control <b>hyperexcitability,</b> which is known to cause migraines. Additionally, extracellular K+ concentration {{has been found to be}} controlled by guanine nucleoside guanosine (Guo). Guo, which may be involved in neuron-to-SGC communication and interaction in sensory ganglia, is also a potential target that could control the alterations of extracellular K+ concentration associated with chronic pain.|$|E
25|$|In Panayiotopoulos {{syndrome}} {{there is}} a diffuse multifocal cortical <b>hyperexcitability,</b> which is age (maturation)-related. This diffuse epileptogenicity may be unequally distributed, predominating in one area, which is often posterior. Epileptic discharges in Panayiotopoulos syndrome, irrespective of their location at onset, activate emetic and autonomic centers prior to any other conventional neocortical seizure manifestations. An explanation {{for this is that}} children are susceptible to autonomic disorders as illustrated by the cyclic vomiting syndrome, which is a nonepileptic condition specific to childhood.|$|E
25|$|Concurrent {{with the}} {{previous}} mutation, a second group found a second mutation in GABRG2 associated with GEFS+. This mutation, R43Q, {{is located in the}} one of two benzodiazepine binding-sites located in the extracellular N-terminus. Benzodiazepines, such as Diazepam, potentiate GABA induced current. This potentiation is abolished in cells expressing the R43Q mutant subunit instead of the wild-type γ subunit. This mutation does not affect the subunit's ability to coassemble into function receptors as it still confers resistance to GABA current blockade by zinc. As {{with the previous}} mutation, this mutation is expected to result in neuronal <b>hyperexcitability.</b>|$|E
25|$|Machado–Joseph disease (MJD) is a triplet repeat disease {{characterized}} by cerebellar ataxia, pyramidal signs, ophthalmoplegia, and polyneuropathy. Since muscle cramps are a frequent occurrence in MJD, axonal <b>hyperexcitability</b> {{has been considered}} {{to play a role}} in the disease. Research has demonstrated that the strength-duration time constant in MJD patients is significantly longer than in controls, and this corresponds to a significant reduction in rheobase. Combined with findings on Na+ channel blockers, these data suggest that the cramps in MJD are likely caused by the increased persistent Na+ channel conductance that may be unregulated during axonal reinnervation (which results from long-term axonal degeneration).|$|E
25|$|A {{key factor}} in the neural {{plasticity}} underlying neuropathic pain is altered gene expression in sensory dorsal root ganglia neurons. Injury to sensory nerves induces neurochemical, physiological and anatomical modifications to afferent and central neurons, such as afferent terminal sprouting and inhibitory interneuron loss. Following nerve damage, NaCl channel accumulation causes <b>hyperexcitability,</b> and downregulation of the TTX-resistant Nav1.8 (sensory neuron specific, SNS1) channel and upregulation of TTX-sensitive Nav1.3 (brain type III) and TRPV1 channels. These changes contribute to increased NMDA glutamate receptor-dependent excitability of spinal dorsal horn neurons and are restricted to the ipsilateral (injured) side. A combination of these factors could contribute to the neuropathic pain state of postherpetic neuralgia.|$|E
25|$|Patients with GEFS+ type 3 have {{mutations}} in the GABRG2 gene, which encodes the GABAA γ2 subunit (figure 2). The first mutation discovered in GABRG2 was K289M, in the extracellular region linking membrane-spanning domains M2 and M3. Oocytes injected with α1, β2, and γ2 subunits produce large GABA inducible currents whereas those injected with K289M mutant instead of wild-type subunits produce currents much smaller (about 10% of wild-type). This abnormal current {{is not the}} result of non-incorporation of mutant subunits since mutant containing receptors are still sensitive to benzodiazepines, a property for which functional γ subunits are required. Because of these results, it is believed that the GEFS+ phenotype in these individuals is a result of <b>hyperexcitability.</b>|$|E
25|$|KCC2 {{levels are}} low during {{mammalian}} embryonic development, when neural networks {{are still being}} established and neurons are highly plastic (changeable). During this stage, intracellular chloride ion concentrations are high due to low KCC2 expression {{and high levels of}} a transporter known as NKCC1 (Na+/K+ chloride cotransporter 1), which moves chloride ions into cells. Thus, during embryonic development, the chloride gradient is such that stimulation of GABAA receptors and glycine receptors at inhibitory synapses causes chloride ions to flow out of cells, making the internal neuronal environment less negative (i.e. more depolarized) than it would be at rest. At this stage, GABAA receptors and glycine receptors act as excitatory rather than inhibitory effectors on postsynaptic neurons, resulting in depolarization and <b>hyperexcitability</b> of neural networks.|$|E
25|$|There is an {{untested}} {{hypothesis that}} claims that referred itch uses the spinocervical tract pathway. The cells in this tract {{lie in the}} dorsal horn of the spinal cord, and its axons run in the ipsilateral and dorsolateral quadrant, {{which is consistent with}} observations that stimuli in the trigger points are ipsilateral to the sites of referred sensations. These axons project to the thalamus and midbrain, suggesting that the thalamus is involved in the phenomenon. The cells in this tract are also excited by mechanical stimuli, lending support that this pathway can explain the mechanism of referred itch. Central neuronal damage to this area – either direct or secondary to peripheral nerve damage – makes it an area of focal <b>hyperexcitability</b> or reduced inhibition. This hypothesis {{has been found to be}} unlikely because there would be an expected progression of itches (i.e., from legs to trunk, and from trunk to neck). However, there is no symmetrical distribution found between trigger zones and sites of referred sensation.|$|E
25|$|GEFS+ type 1 is a subtype of GEFS+ {{in which}} there are {{mutations}} in SCN1B, a gene encoding a sodium channel β subunit. The β subunit is required for proper channel inactivation. There are two known mutations in SCN1B that lead to GEFS+ (Figure 1). The first and best characterized of these mutations is C121W. This mutation alters a cysteine involved in a disulfide bond in the extracellular N-terminus of the protein. This extracellular region is similar to the cell adhesion molecule contactin and other cell adhesion molecules. It is believed that the disulfide bond disrupted by the C121W mutation is required for the proper folding of this N-terminus motif. Coexpression of SCN1B with sodium channel α subunits in oocytes and other cells results in channels that inactivate more slowly. Expression of C121W mutant along with wild-type α subunits produces current indistinguishable from that through α subunits alone. Further investigation of this mutation has indicated that it results in decreased frequency dependent rundown and, thus, likely <b>hyperexcitability</b> when compared to cells expressing the wild-type subunit. Interestingly, this mutation also disrupts the subunit's ability to induce cellular aggregation. The importance of this last fact is unclear, though it is presumed that proper channel aggregation within cells and cell-cell contact are required for normal neuronal function.|$|E
500|$|Seizures in {{temporal}} lobe epilepsy {{can affect the}} normal development of new neurons and can cause tissue damage. Hippocampal sclerosis {{is the most common}} type of such tissue damage. It is not yet clear, however, whether the epilepsy is usually caused by hippocampal abnormalities or whether the hippocampus is damaged by cumulative effects of seizures. However, [...] in experimental settings where repetitive seizures are artificially induced in animals, hippocampal damage is a frequent result. This may be a consequence of the concentration of excitable glutamate receptors in the hippocampus. <b>Hyperexcitability</b> can lead to cytotoxicity and cell death. It may also have something to do with the hippocampus being a site where new neurons continue to be created throughout life, and to abnormalities in this process.|$|E

2500|$|Kynurenic acid thus {{acts as a}} neuroprotectant, by {{reducing}} the dangerous over-activation of the NMDA receptors. Manipulation of the kynurenine pathway away from quinolinic acid and toward kynurenic acid is therefore a major therapeutic focus. Nicotinylalanine {{has been shown to}} be an inhibitor of kynurenine hydroxylase, which results in a decreased production of quinolinic acid, thus favoring kynurenic acid production. This change in balance has the potential to reduce <b>hyperexcitability,</b> and thus excitotoxic damage produced from elevated levels of quinolinic acid.|$|E
2500|$|Specific {{deletion}} of NEDD4-2 in mouse renal tubules {{leads to}} increased expression of ENaC and NCC. Consistent with the critical function in ENaC and NCC regulation, NEDDL polymorphisms {{are linked to}} essential hypertension in certain human populations. Specific deletion of NEDD4-2 in mouse neurons results in axonal branching defects. Isolated fetal cortical neurons from NEDD4-2 knockout mice show defective regulation of voltage-gated sodium currents, and in animal models of neuropathic pain NEDD4-2 expression {{has been found to}} be downregulated. Also NEDD4-2-deficiency results in <b>hyperexcitability</b> of DRG neurons and contributes to pathological pain ...|$|E
2500|$|Glycine is an {{inhibitory}} neurotransmitter {{in the central}} nervous system, especially in the spinal cord, brainstem, and retina. When glycine receptors are activated, chloride enters the neuron via ionotropic receptors, causing an Inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP). Strychnine is a strong antagonist at ionotropic glycine receptors, whereas bicuculline is a weak one. Glycine is a required co-agonist along with glutamate for NMDA receptors. In contrast to the inhibitory role of glycine in the spinal cord, this behaviour is facilitated at the (NMDA) glutamatergic receptors which are excitatory. [...] The [...] of glycine is 7930mg/kg in rats (oral), and it usually causes death by <b>hyperexcitability.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The final known GEFS+ type 3 {{mutation}} is a nonsense mutation, Q351X, {{located in}} the intracellular [...] region linking {{the third and fourth}} membrane spanning segments. When this mutant subunit is expressed in cells with wild-type α and β subunits it produces non-functional receptors. Since wild-type α and β subunits expressed alone are able to produce GABA inducible current this indicates that the mutation either prevents both coassembly of the mutant and wild-type subunits but also coassembly of the wild-type α and β subunits or prevents proper trafficking of the formed receptor to the membrane. Fusion of GFP onto this mutated subunit has indicated that it is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum instead of the cell membrane. As with other known GEFS+ type 3 mutation, Q351X likely results in neuronal <b>hyperexcitability.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The use of {{nitrazepam}} {{during pregnancy}} {{can lead to}} intoxication of the newborn. A neonatal withdrawal syndrome can also occur if nitrazepam or other benzodiazepines are used during pregnancy with symptoms such as <b>hyperexcitability,</b> tremor, and gastrointestinal upset (diarrhea or vomiting) occurring. Breast feeding by mothers using nitrazepam is not recommended. Nitrazepam is a long-acting benzodiazepine with a risk of drug accumulation, [...] though no active metabolites are formed during metabolism. Accumulation can occur in various body organs, including the heart; accumulation is even greater in babies. Nitrazepam rapidly crosses the placenta and is present in breast milk in high quantities. Therefore, benzodiazepines including nitrazepam should be avoided during pregnancy. In early pregnancy, nitrazepam levels are lower in the baby than in the mother, and in the later stages of pregnancy, nitrazepam is found in equal levels in both {{the mother and the}} unborn child. Internationally benzodiazepines are known to cause harm when used during pregnancy and nitrazepam is a category D drug during pregnancy.|$|E
2500|$|Type-6 episodic ataxia (EA6) {{is a rare}} form of episodic ataxia, {{identified}} initially in a 10-year-old boy {{who first}} presented with 30 minute bouts of decreased muscle tone during infancy. He required [...] "balance therapy" [...] {{as a young child}} to aid in walking and has a number of ataxic attacks, each separated by months to years. These attacks were precipitated by fever. He has cerebellar atrophy and subclinical seizures. During later attacks, he also presented with distortions of the left hemifield, ataxia, slurred speech, followed by headache. After enrolling in school, he developed bouts of rhythmic arm jerking with concomitant confusion, also lasting approximately 30 minutes. He also has presented, at various times, with migraines. This patient carries a proline to arginine substitution in the fifth transmembrane-spanning segment of the gene SLC1A3. This gene encodes the excitatory amino acid transporter 1 (EAAT1) protein, which is responsible for glutamate uptake. In cell culture assays, this mutation results in drastically decreased glutamate uptake in a dominant-negative manner. This is likely due to decreased synthesis or protein stability. As this protein is expressed heavily in the brainstem and cerebellum, it is likely that this mutation results in excitotoxicity and/or <b>hyperexcitability</b> leading to ataxia and seizures. Mutations in EAAT1 (GLAST) have subsequently been identified in a family with episodic ataxia.|$|E
50|$|Neuromyotonia {{is a type}} of {{peripheral}} nerve <b>hyperexcitability.</b> Peripheral nerve <b>hyperexcitability</b> is an umbrella diagnosis that includes (in order of severity of symptoms from least severe to most severe) benign fasciculation syndrome, cramp fasciculation syndrome, and neuromyotonia. Some doctors will only give the diagnosis of {{peripheral nerve}} <b>hyperexcitability</b> as the differences between the three are largely a matter of the severity of the symptoms and can be subjective. However, some objective EMG criteria have been established to help distinguish between the three.|$|E

50|$|Certain studies {{suggested}} {{a link between}} sporadic ALS, specifically in athletes, and a diet enriched with branched-chain amino acids, a common dietary supplement among athletes, which cause cell <b>hyperexcitability</b> resembling that usually observed in people with ALS. The proposed underlying mechanism is that cell <b>hyperexcitability</b> results in increased calcium absorption by the cell, and thus brings about cell death of neuronal cells, which have particularly low calcium buffering capabilities.|$|E
