5|$|Historically, {{attachment}} theory {{had significant}} policy implications for hospitalized or institutionalized children, {{and those in}} poor quality daycare. Controversy remains over whether non-maternal care, particularly in group settings, has deleterious effects on social development. It is plain from research that poor quality care carries risks but that those who experience <b>good</b> <b>quality</b> alternative care cope well although {{it is difficult to}} provide <b>good</b> <b>quality,</b> individualized care in group settings.|$|E

5|$|The {{area around}} Kidwelly {{is rich in}} coal {{reserves}} and contains ironstone. It was to exploit these reserves that the canal and tramway system was built. Much of the coal was <b>good</b> <b>quality</b> anthracite, although other grades were also mined.|$|E
5|$|A 1.5 hectare {{patch of}} brown earth soil at the {{abandoned}} settlement of Papadil {{is home to}} a thriving population of earthworms, which are rare in the elsewhere poor soil of the island. Some individuals of Lumbricus terrestris have reached tremendous sizes, with the largest weighing 12.7 grams. This is speculated to be due to the <b>good</b> <b>quality</b> soil, and absence of predators.|$|E

5|$|An {{important}} {{concern for}} Barnes, when {{returning from the}} United Kingdom to Australia, was to avoid paying customs duties on the enormous amount of goods he acquired through various deals during the tour. This included <b>good</b> <b>quality</b> English cloth, in very short supply in Australia at this time. Hearing a rumour that Customs officials were waiting in Sydney for him, Barnes disembarked at Melbourne and travelled to Sydney by train. The move worked and he sold his stock at a substantial profit, conservatively estimated to be equal to his tour fee.|$|E
5|$|As one of {{the major}} herbivores of {{southern}} and eastern Africa, the blue wildebeest {{plays an important role in}} the ecosystem and is a main prey item for large predators such as the lion. It is {{one of the}} animals that draws tourists to the area to observe big game and as such it is of major economic importance to the region. Traditionally blue wildebeest have been hunted for their hides and meat, the skin making <b>good</b> <b>quality</b> leather though the flesh is coarse, dry and rather hard.|$|E

5|$|Excavations in {{the acropolis}} {{revealed}} {{the presence of}} at least two superimposed platforms built with finely dressed stone blocks and covered with <b>good</b> <b>quality</b> stucco flooring. At a later date the platforms and courtyard were covered with unworked stones bound with mortar and covered with another stucco floor. The two platforms were built in the Late Classic and appear to have been covered over in the Terminal Classic.|$|E
5|$|For the {{purposes}} of monitoring of water quality the Brue and Axe are considered together. In 2013 19 water bodies within the area were considered to have moderate water quality with two being poor and four <b>good</b> <b>quality.</b> Agriculture and rural land management is the largest factor affecting water quality followed by the water industry. Transport, industry and manufacturing also have an effect.|$|E

5|$|Reviewers made {{positive}} {{remarks about}} the game's orchestral score and voice acting. Kasavin (GameSpot) wrote that added choral tracks during intense in-game moments gave the game epic overtones, though Clayman (IGN) thought the score made the game environments feel delusively majestic. Bramwell (Eurogamer) found little joy in the verbose dialogue, which he often skipped even during important scenes, but Kasavin (GameSpot) considered the voice acting amusing, with <b>good</b> <b>quality.</b> He also praised the level of nuance in the sound effects, such as those made as characters walked.|$|E
5|$|Several {{studies of}} young adults who had used AAC since {{childhood}} report a generally <b>good</b> <b>quality</b> of life, though few lived independently, or were in paid employment. The young adults used multiple modes of communication including aided and unaided AAC approaches. More positive quality of life outcomes often correlated with better quality of communication and interaction, as well as personal characteristics, family and community support, and excellent AAC services. Poorer outcomes were related to {{lack of access to}} appropriate AAC supports and resources, problems with technology and negative attitudes.|$|E
5|$|The NAD 3020 is {{an iconic}} stereo {{integrated}} amplifier by NAD Electronics, {{considered to be}} one of the most important components in the history of high fidelity audio. Launched circa 1978, this highly affordable product delivered a <b>good</b> <b>quality</b> sound, which acquired a reputation as an audiophile amplifier of exceptional value. By 1998, the NAD 3020 had become the most well known and best-selling audio amplifier in history.|$|E

5|$|The {{challenge}} for NASA's imaging team was that, as the mission progressed, the objects being photographed were getting {{farther away from}} the spacecraft, therefore appearing fainter and requiring longer exposures and even slewing (panning) of the cameras to achieve <b>good</b> <b>quality.</b> The telecommunication capability also decreased with distance, limiting the number of data modes that could be used by the imaging system.|$|E
5|$|Two years later, in July 1895, Seibal was {{explored}} by Teoberto Maler {{on behalf of}} the Peabody Museum of Harvard University. He made a site plan and discovered a new stela to add to those already discovered. He returned to the site for further investigations in August 1905 but discovered no new monuments. The Peabody Museum published Maler's work in 1908, including <b>good</b> <b>quality</b> photos of the stelae.|$|E
5|$|A {{little over}} {{ten years after the}} first US edition ceased, a new version appeared, again as a {{companion}} to F. This time the magazine was quarterly. The debut issue was dated May 1969, and it was edited by Edward L. Ferman—son of Joseph Ferman—who was also the editor of F. There was no statement of editorial intent for this version, but the policy was straightforward: a novel was presented in each issue. Although these were substantially cut, they still took up most of the magazine, with the result that the other stories tended to be very short. As in the first incarnation, the contents were of fairly <b>good</b> <b>quality,</b> with contributions from well-known writers. However, the magazine was no more successful than before, and lasted for only six quarterly issues; the last issue was August 1970.|$|E
