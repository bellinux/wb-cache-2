40|$|The paper extends Diamond's (1984) {{analysis}} of financial intermediation {{to allow for}} risk aversion of the <b>intermediary.</b> It shows that, {{as in the case}} of risk neutrality, the agency costs of external funds provided to an <b>intermediary</b> are relatively small if the <b>intermediary</b> is financing many entrepreneurs with stochastically independent returns. Even though the <b>intermediary</b> is adding rather than subdividing risks, the underlying large-numbers argument is not invalidated by the presence of risk aversion. With risk aversion of entrepreneurs as well as the <b>intermediary,</b> financial intermediation provides insurance as well as finance. In contrast to earlier results on optimal intermediation policies under risk neutrality, the paper shows that when an <b>intermediary</b> is financing many entrepreneurs with stochastically independent returns, optimal intermediation policies must shift return risks away from risk averse entrepreneurs and impose them on the <b>intermediary</b> or on final investors. ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} crude oil price and financial sector <b>intermediary</b> development in Nigeria over the period 1975 - 2011, using the autoregressive distributed lag approach to cointegration analysis. Four measures of financial <b>intermediary</b> development are used including an index of financial <b>intermediary</b> development constructed from three indicators of financial <b>intermediary</b> development using principal component analysis. The results show that crude oil price is a key driver of financial <b>intermediary</b> development in Nigeria. A positive and significant long run relationship between financial <b>intermediary</b> development and crude oil price coexists with a negative short run relationship. The results show that even if we control for economic growth, inflation and trade openness, crude oil price still has significant influence {{on the development of}} financial intermediation in Nigeria. The findings of this study have important policy implications for financial <b>intermediary</b> development in Nigeria and other developing oil-exporting countries...|$|R
5|$|Before {{the early}} 17th century, the western Petén had been heavily {{populated}} by Ch'ol and Ch'olti' Maya {{and was an}} important trade route for the Itza. By the mid-17th century, these populations had been devastated by war, disease and the enforced movement of the inhabitants into colonial settlements, negating the economic importance of the region for the Itza. At {{the same time the}} Kejache were becoming important <b>intermediaries</b> between the Itza and Yucatán. The Putun Acalan subgroup of the Kejache had previously traded directly with the Itza but had been relocated by the Spanish. The remaining Kejache, devastated by disease and subject to the intense attentions of Spanish missionaries, were no longer able to supply the Itza directly and became middlemen instead.|$|E

Despite the use of <b>intermediaries,</b> a divorce case ensued in Paris in 1905. Gonne made a series of allegations against her husband with Yeats as her main 'second', though he did not attend court or travel to France. A divorce was not granted, for the only accusation that held up in court was that MacBride had been drunk once during the marriage. A separation was granted, with Gonne having custody of the baby and MacBride having visiting rights.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we analyze <b>intermediary</b> work in {{the context}} of {{sustainability}} transitions in relation to what we call the “environmental paradox”. While sustainability transitions are strongly related to political or social expectations in terms of management performance and measurable results and effects, environmental problems have some generic characteristics which make these expectations partly unachievable. Those recover the notions of interdependency, complexity, uncertainty and controversy. We argue those key features condition understanding and concrete achievement of <b>intermediary</b> work. Drawing upon biographic narratives of <b>intermediary</b> actors (extension worker, mandated <b>intermediary</b> workers, group of experts and researcher, NGO member), we use contrasting examples to propose a comprehensive reading of what makes their strategies effective regarding the development of political narratives and of learning processes {{in the context of}} the management of ‘wicked problems’. Our crosscutting approach allows us to advocate that such an <b>intermediary</b> work cover a set of roles or functions which involve strong articulation of objectification processes with inter-subjectivation. Then, the properties of <b>intermediary</b> work may be regarded as the capacity <b>intermediary</b> workers develop to contextualize their own activity, to create the conditions of their own performativity, both being strongly related to <b>intermediary</b> workers reflexive consciousness...|$|R
