[...] would give you the best in the house. You ought to go, to see how happy the human race can be. It is a fine, rich valley, about thirty miles from Port Platte; heavily timbered with mahogany all round; well watered; flowers so beautiful; fruits in abundance, so delicious that you could not refrain from stopping to eat, till you could eat no more. My sons have laid out good roads, and built bridges and mills; the people are improving, and everything is prosperous.|$|E
500|$|The {{co-operation}} between monarch and Parliament {{following the}} Gunpowder Plot was atypical. Instead, {{it was the}} previous session of 1604 that shaped the attitudes of both sides {{for the rest of}} the reign, though the initial difficulties owed more to mutual incomprehension than conscious enmity. On 7 July 1604, James had angrily prorogued Parliament after failing to win its support either for full union or financial subsidies. [...] "I will not thank where I feel no thanks due", he had remarked in his closing speech. [...] "...I am not of such a stock as to praise fools... You see how many things you did not well... <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> make use of your liberty with more modesty in time to come".|$|E
500|$|City Lights {{marked the}} first time Chaplin {{composed}} the film score to one of his productions. While Chaplin preferred his films to have live sound by the 1930s most theaters had gotten rid of their orchestras. Many of his critics claimed he was doing it to grab more credit. Chaplin, whose parents and many members of the Chaplin family were both musicians, was struggling with the professional musicians he hired and took it upon himself to compose the score himself. It was written in six weeks with Arthur Johnston and included over one hundred musical cues. Chaplin told a reporter that [...] "I really didn't write it down. I la-laed and Arthur Johnson wrote it down, and <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> give him credit because he did a very good job. It is all simple music, you know, in keeping with my character." [...] The intention was to have a score that would translate the characters' emotions through its melodies. The score was recorded in five days with musical arranger Alfred Newman.|$|E

2500|$|Lowe's first {{assignment}} {{was with the}} Topographical Engineers, where his balloon was used for aerial observations and map making. Eventually he worked with Major General Irvin McDowell, who rode along with Lowe making preliminary observations over the battlefield at Bull Run. McDowell became impressed with Lowe and his balloon, and a good word reached the President, who personally introduced Lowe to Union General-in-Chief Winfield Scott. [...] "General, this is my friend Professor Lowe who is organizing an aeronautics corps and who is to be its chief. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> facilitate his work in every way." [...] This introduction fairly well settled the selection of Lowe as Chief Aeronaut. The details of establishing the corps and its method of operation were left up to Lowe. The misunderstanding that the Balloon Corps would remain a civilian contract lasted its duration, and neither Lowe nor any of his men ever received commissions.|$|E
2500|$|The {{project was}} {{supported}} by Pennsylvania Governor John S. Fisher and the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Governor Fisher was an old friend and ally of McCreight, and together they labored for many years on the Cook Forest conservation project. [...] Both were “farm-boy” bankers who grew up near the Great Shamokin Path of the Seneca, knew the forests and believed in conservation. It was not until Fisher was elected Governor that the Cook Forest Bill was finally passed and signed on April 14, 1927. Governor Fisher supported McCreight’s proposal. “The Governor has written me that he is greatly interested {{in the use of}} the park for the home of the native Red Folks, and I think the plan can be worked out. [...] My suggestion is that Good Face, and with William Spotted Tail with his family, and John Sitting Bull, and others who would suit with my old friend Flying Hawk who lives at Rockyford.” McCreight, forever the dedicated public educator, saw yet another opportunity for [...] "Young America". “The Eastern people, especially the younger generation, are greatly interested in the Indians and to have a few of the old time names of whom they have read in history, it would add to their desire to know more of them. [...] Anyway, the American People owe the Indians a lot and there is nothing that I know of that would be finer, than to make a nice home for them in this great natural forest where they once lived and which was theirs before the whites came and it is the one piece of land that is just the same as it was when the original red men lived there. [...] Like all parks in the north, it would not be necessary for them to remain in it in the winter, likely they could go back and forth as it appealed to them. [...] Of course there are plenty of Indians that would be glad to get the chance to come, but not all are desired by any means. [...] I know Commissioner of Indian Affairs Charles H. Burke and will of course consult with him if the plan seems to be practical in other ways. [...] I would like, first to know whether the plan would appeal to the Indians themselves, the ones I have in mind to have for it. [...] Possibly you could see Spotted Tail too. [...] Good Face has been here before. [...] He told me he was at my house nearly thirty years ago. [...] Now that you understand what I have in mind, there are others who might be just as desirable to those mentioned, in your country, and <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> think about it and write me again how you regard it, and with any suggestions you might have considering the plan.” In February 1929, the Superintendent of the Pine Ridge Agency, Indian Field Service of the U.S. Department of the Interior contacted McCreight that “two families have signified their willingness to go if proper arrangements can be made and a contract and bond furnished.” [...] McCreight’s vision of Lakota living and working at Cook Forest was endorsed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs and families were ready to move to the great forest along the Clarion River. However, when the stock market crashed on October 29, 1929, with the onset of the Great Depression, the Lakota project at Cook Forest was shelved.|$|E
