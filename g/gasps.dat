5|$|There is {{very little}} voice acting in the game, {{as is the case}} in most The Legend of Zelda titles to date. Link remains silent in conversation, but grunts when attacking or injured and <b>gasps</b> when surprised. His {{emotions}} and responses are largely indicated visually by nods and facial expressions. Other characters have similar language-independent verbalizations, including laughter, surprised or fearful exclamations, and screams. Midna has the most voice acting—her on-screen dialogue is often accompanied by a babble of pseudo-speech, which was produced by scrambling English phrases sampled by Japanese voice actress Akiko Kōmoto.|$|E
5|$|Spencer {{seeks out}} the Beautiful Girl Across the Hall, but finds her with another man. Crushed, Spencer {{returns to his}} room, where the child is crying. He takes a pair of {{scissors}} {{and for the first time}} removes the child's swaddling. It is revealed that the child has no skin; the bandages held its internal organs together, and they spill apart after the rags are cut. The child <b>gasps</b> in pain, and Spencer cuts its organs with the scissors. The wounds gush a thick liquid, covering the child. The power in the room overloads; as the lights flicker on and off the child grows to huge proportions. When the lights burn out completely, the child's head is replaced by the planet. Spencer appears amidst a billowing cloud of eraser shavings. The side of the planet bursts apart, and inside, the Man in the Planet struggles with his levers, which are now emitting sparks. Spencer is embraced warmly by the Lady in the Radiator, as both white light and white noise crescendo.|$|E
40|$|<b>Gasping</b> {{respiration}} in {{the dying}} patient {{is the last}} respiratory pattern prior to terminal apnoea. The duration of the <b>gasping</b> respiration phase varies; it may be as brief as one or two breaths to a prolonged period of <b>gasping</b> lasting minutes or even hours. <b>Gasping</b> respiration is very abnormal, easy to recognise and distinguish from other respiratory patterns and, in the dying patient who has elected to not be resuscitated, will always result in terminal apnoea. <b>Gasping</b> respiration is {{also referred to as}} agonal respiration and the name is appropriate because the <b>gasping</b> breaths appear uncomfortable and raise concern that the patient is suffering and in agony. Enough uncertainty exists about the influence of <b>gasping</b> respiration on patient wellbeing, that it is appropriate to assume that the <b>gasping</b> breaths are burdensome to patients. Therefore, <b>gasping</b> respiration {{at the end of life}} should be treated. We propose that there is an ethical basis, in rare circumstances, for the use of neuromuscular blockade to suppress prolonged episodes of agonal respiration in the well-sedated patient in order to allow a peaceful and comfortable death.

40|$|The {{purpose was}} to {{characterize}} expiratory neural activities in <b>gasping</b> elicited during the aspiration reflex (AR) in hyperoxia and during hypoxia-induced <b>gasping.</b> In decerebrate, vagotomized and paralyzed cats, we recorded activities of inspiratory and expiratory cranial and spinal nerves. The AR was elicited by touching the epipharyngeal mucosa. In eupnea, spinal expiratory activities were greatly decreased during AR whereas laryngeal expiratory activities were increased. In hypoxia-induced <b>gasping,</b> both the laryngeal and spinal expiratory activities were reduced. All of the inspiratory activities were increased during both <b>gasping</b> and the AR. In addition, neural activities were below control levels following AR; activities gradually recovered to control levels. We conclude that spinal expiratory activities are inhibited during the AR and <b>gasping.</b> Results {{are consistent with the}} concept that medullary mechanisms for <b>gasping</b> are recruited by mechanical stimulation of the epipharynx. In hypoxia-induced <b>gasping,</b> the hypoxia, per se, causes a separate suppression of laryngeal expiratory activities. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

As she begins to notice the bellhop, dressed in the sweats, pursuing her, she turns around in haste and begins jolting back to the hotel while holding several shopping bags. Additionally, scenes of the stalker's home are shown again, this time more elaborately, with his walls covered with portraits of the singer, as well as album covers and lights around a large photo of her. As the video comes to an end, she waits for her limousine to arrive at the hotel. However, before she gets inside, she notices the stalker attempting to take a picture of her. She then looks directly into his camera and gives a smile. The video then shows him again, still attempting to take a picture, right before a bus hits him. Carey <b>gasps</b> in shock after witnessing the incident. The remix video for the song features the same story-line and footage, only showing inter-cut scenes of Carey dressed in a white ensemble, while laying on a vintage wooden table.

25|$|Despite the prosecution's {{recommendation}} of leniency, at her sentencing hearing on 22 January 2013 {{a panel of}} judges ruled there were no mitigating circumstances in Sandiford's favour, and imposed a death sentence. Amser Simanjuntak, who headed the panel said Sandiford's actions had damaged Bali's reputation as a tourist destination and undermined Indonesia's fight against drugs, while his colleague, Komang Wijaya Adi said their decision had been influenced by several factors, including what was viewed as her lack of remorse. The sentence was greeted with <b>gasps</b> from around the courtroom. In Indonesia an execution is generally carried out by firing squad, often at night in an isolated location. Following the judgment Sandiford was led from the court in a distressed state, where she declined to speak to journalists before being escorted away by guards {{to be held at}} Bali's notorious Kerobokan Prison. Her lawyers announced she would appeal, a process that can take several years under Indonesian law.|$|E
25|$|Other {{aspects of}} the game's {{interface}} were set to replicate {{the feel of a}} physical game being watched by an audience: Hearthstone starts with the player opening a box, during gameplay the cards waver and move while in their hand, and cards when played slam down on the board. When attacking, cards leap across the board to strike the target; when a massive spike of damage is dealt, the board shakes; when a massive creature is summoned, an unseen audience <b>gasps</b> in awe. Hearthstone also offers interactive boards. The boards on which the cards are played can be interacted with in various ways, such as virtually petting a dragon, although the feature is purely for entertainment and has no effect on gameplay. This idea came out from the movie Jumanji in which a board game comes to life, and also mimics how physical card players would often toy with their cards while waiting on their opponent.|$|E

40|$|Based on {{similarities}} between properties of <b>gasping</b> and the aspiration reflex, {{we hypothesized that}} this reflex activates the central pattern generator for <b>gasping.</b> To evaluate this hypothesis, we have analysed high-frequency oscillations in phrenic and hypoglossal neural activities. These oscillations, analysed by power and coherence spectra, are considered as signatures of the central pattern generators for automatic ventilatory activity. In decerebrate, vagotomized, paralysed and ventilated cats, the aspiration reflex was elicited in eupnoea and <b>gasping</b> by mechanical stimulation of the pharynx and electrical stimulation of the glossopharyngeal nerve. Compared with eupnoeic values, the peaks in the power spectra occurred at higher frequencies in spontaneous <b>gasping.</b> Peaks in the coherence spectra showed identical changes. Power and coherence spectra of inspiratory neural activities during the aspiration reflex differed markedly from those of eupnoea, but {{were similar to those}} in <b>gasping.</b> We conclude that mechanical stimulation of the pharynx or electrical stimulation of the glossopharyngeal nerve activates a reflex by which the central pattern generator for eupnoea is depressed, and that for <b>gasping</b> is activated. Our results also support the concept that separate brainstem mechanisms generate ventilatory activity in eupnoea and <b>gasping.</b> link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Polarised {{light from}} astronomical targets can yield {{a wealth of}} {{information}} about their source radiation mechanisms, and about the geometry of the scattered light regions. To date, stellar observations have focused, for the most part, on the linearly polarised component of the optical emission. Observations have been restricted due to inadequate instrumentation, and particularly the need for suitable observing conditions and the availability of luminous targets. The motivation in developing the Galway Astronomical Stokes Polarimeter (<b>GASP)</b> makes possible the ability to observe beyond these sources. <b>GASP</b> is based upon division of amplitude polarimeter (DOAP) (Compain and Drevillon, 1998), which measures the four components of the Stokes vector (I, Q, U and V) simultaneously. This work establishes a suitable optical design that develops <b>GASP</b> as an imaging polarimeter, enabling an acceptable FOV and pixelscale for a 5 -m class telescope. It also focuses on two important aspects of using the <b>GASP</b> polarimeter - the calibration of <b>GASP</b> as an imaging polarimeter, and the application of <b>GASP</b> to astronomical targets. The Eigenvalue Calibration Method (ECM) is used to calibrate <b>GASP</b> by reducing systematic errors as a result of calibration optics. It includes all the optical elements of the polarimeter in the output, including the characteristics of the reference ECM samples. The results of the ECM using <b>GASP</b> as an 8 -detector polarimeter give degree of linear polarisation to accuracies of 0. 2...|$|R

They also communicate using face and body expression, but {{the significance of these}} signals is uncertain. The animal is aggressive only during mating, and males in particular fight boldly. After a short fight, the loser flees and is followed by the winner for a short distance.

We find that correlations between <b>GASP</b> AOD and PM 2. 5 over time at fixed locations are reasonably high, except in the winter and in the western U. S. Correlations over space at fixed times are lower. Simple averaging over time actually reduces correlations over space dramatically, but statistical calibration allows averaging over time that produces strong correlations. These results and the data density of <b>GASP</b> AOD highlight its potential to help improve exposure estimates for epidemiological analyses. On average 40 % of days in a month have a <b>GASP</b> AOD retrieval compared to 14 % for MODIS and 4 % for MISR.
