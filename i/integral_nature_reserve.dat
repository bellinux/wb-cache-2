40|$|<b>Nature</b> <b>reserves</b> {{are widely}} {{considered}} as one available strategy for protecting biodiversity, which is threatened by habitat fragmentation, and wildlife extinction. The Chinese government has established a goal of protecting 15 % of its land area by 2015.

Furthermore, medium and small <b>nature</b> <b>reserves</b> compose 92. 32 % of all <b>nature</b> <b>reserves.</b> The land area under any legal protection has reached 14. 80 %, although only 9. 78 % is strictly protected. However, if 9 super-large national <b>nature</b> <b>reserves,</b> located in Southwest and Northwest China were removed, the percentage of strictly protected area decreases to 2. 66 % of the land area of China. The areas contained in <b>nature</b> <b>reserves</b> in each province are not proportional to {{the areas of the}} provinces, particularly for national <b>nature</b> <b>reserves,</b> with higher protection rates in Southwest and Northwest China than in other regions. Of the 31 provinces, 22 provinces feature strict protection of less than 4 % of their areas by national nature reserves; these provinces are mainly located in East, Central, South, and North China. Moreover, the unevenness indexes of the distribution of <b>nature</b> <b>reserves</b> and national <b>nature</b> <b>reserves</b> are 0. 39 and 0. 58, respectively. The construction of <b>nature</b> <b>reserves</b> has entered a steady development stage after a period of rapid expansion in mainland China.
