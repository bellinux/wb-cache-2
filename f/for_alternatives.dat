30|$|For 90 Y-microsphere {{treatments}} (K, L), {{shown in}} Fig.  3 d, the replies differed from above. In this case, {{the most common}} responses were prescriptions based on the absorbed dose, either to the target tissue (lobe or segment), or to non-tumor liver tissue or tumor based on 99 mTc-MAA SPECT (Table  2, alternatives 9 – 11). For resin microspheres, the frequencies were 14 / 85 (15 %) <b>for</b> <b>alternative</b> 9 in Table  2, 21 / 85 (25 %) <b>for</b> <b>alternative</b> 10, and 19 / 85 (22 %) <b>for</b> <b>alternative</b> 11. <b>For</b> glass microspheres, the corresponding frequencies were 23 / 48 (48 %) <b>for</b> <b>alternative</b> 9, 13 / 48 (27 %) <b>for</b> <b>alternative</b> 10, and 10 / 48 (21 %) <b>for</b> <b>alternative</b> 11. Thus, absorbed-dose based prescriptions were reported in 64 % and 96 % of responses for resin and glass, respectively. There was a difference between resin and glass microspheres in that the body-surface area method was stated in 28 / 85 (33 %) of the responses for resin, whereas the corresponding number for glass microspheres was 2 / 48 (4 %).|$|R

5|$|Accenture {{estimated}} that the World Cup opening would bring R$30.75Billion over 10 years to the city's economy; the study's results encouraged Brazil to site the opening match in São Paulo. A study from Fundação Getúlio Vargas estimated R$1Billion in revenue during the World Cup, as 290 thousand tourists were expected for the event. After Morumbi Stadium was deemed unsuitable by FIFA, the Local World Cup Committee looked <b>for</b> <b>alternatives</b> and set on offering Arena Corinthians to host the opening game; FIFA accepted the suggestion and confirmed the decision on 10 October 2011. Hosting the opening game required modifications to the project that raised the cost from the original R$335million to R$1.07billion to accommodate FIFA's requirements. Cuts in equipment, furniture and construction costs reduced the cost. Because of FIFA's agreements with Brazil, none of the construction work related to the World Cup was taxed by the Federal Government; the final price agreed upon was R$820million.|$|E
5|$|Easter Road staged {{its first}} Scottish League match when Hibs joined {{the league in}} 1893. Hibs were only renting Easter Road, which Edinburgh city {{planners}} had designated for future development. This meant the club were unwilling to develop the ground and looked <b>for</b> <b>alternatives.</b> Hibs considered relocating to Aberdeen in 1902, a year before Aberdeen FC was formed by a merger of three local clubs. In 1909, work began on a potential new ground in the Piershill area of Ednburgh, but the North British Railway company won a court order allowing them to build a railway line over the ground. No line was ever built, but Hibs' interest in moving to the site was thwarted. The long-term future of Easter Road was only secured in 1922, when the club agreed a 25-year lease on the ground. Two years later, three banks of terraces were raised, while a main stand seating 4,480 people {{was built on the}} west side of the ground. The redeveloped stadium had a capacity of 45,000. The pitch was also moved 40 yards to the east, providing space for the main stand. The slope was reduced to approximately 6 feet as part of this work.|$|E
