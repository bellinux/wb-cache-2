Mach probes {{of two different}} sizes, corresponding to two different methods of analysis, are used to make these flow measurements. Flows of as high as 70 km/s are detected in the single spheromak, as well as subsequent reversals of flow toward {{the edges of the}} spheromak. There is little flow perpendicular to the magnetic fields in a single spheromak, confttming that SSX spheromaks exhibit the property of <b>frozen-in</b> <b>flux.</b> Measurements during counter-helicity merging of two axially aligned spheromaks tentatively confttm the presence of bidirectional jets due to reconnection in the azimuthal direction.

40|$|We present {{nanosecond}} time-scale Vlasov-Fokker-Planck-Maxwell {{modeling of}} magnetized plasma transport and dynamics in a hohlraum with an applied external magnetic field, under {{conditions similar to}} recent experiments. Self-consistent modeling of the kinetic electron momentum equation allows for a complete treatment of the heat flow equation and Ohm's law, including Nernst advection of magnetic fields. In addition to showing the prevalence of nonlocal behavior, we demonstrate that effects such as anomalous heat flow are induced by inverse bremsstrahlung heating. We show magnetic field amplification up to a factor of 3 from Nernst compression into the hohlraum wall. The magnetic field is also expelled towards the hohlraum axis due to Nernst advection faster than <b>frozen-in</b> <b>flux</b> would suggest. Nonlocality contributes to the heat flow towards the hohlraum axis and results in an augmented Nernst advection mechanism that is included self-consistently through kinetic modeling...|$|E
40|$|Active {{triggering}} {{and manipulation}} of ultrafast flux dynamics in superconductors are demonstrated in films of Nb. Controlled amounts of magnetic flux were injected {{from a point}} {{along the edge of}} a square sample, which at 2. 5 K responds by nucleation of a thermomagnetic avalanche. Magneto-optical imaging was used to show that when such films are cooled in the presence of in-plane magnetic fields they become anisotropic, and the morphology of the avalanches change systematically, both with the direction and magnitude of the field. The images reveal that the avalanching dendrites consistently bend towards the direction perpendicular to that of the in-plane field. The effect increases with the field magnitude, and at 1. 5 kOe the triggered avalanche becomes quenched at the nucleation stage. The experimental results are explained based on a theoretical model for thermomagnetic avalanche nucleation in superconducting films, and by assuming that the <b>frozen-in</b> <b>flux</b> generates in-plane anisotropy in the film thermal conductance. The results demonstrate that applying in-plane magnetic fields to film superconductors can be a versatile external tool for controlling their ultrafast flux dynamics...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Pulsed power {{technology}} and appropriate boundary conditions {{have been used}} to create simulations of magnetically driven astrophysical jets in a lab-oratory experiment. The experiments are quite reproducible and involve a distinct sequence. Eight initial flux tubes, corresponding to eight gas injection locations, merge to form the jet which lengthens, collimates, and eventually kinks. A model developed to explain the collimation process predicts that collimation is intimately related to convection and pile-up of <b>frozen-in</b> toroidal <b>flux</b> convected with the jet. The pile-up occurs when there is an axial non-uniformity in the jet velocity so that in the frame of the jet {{there appears to be a}} converging flow of plasma carrying <b>frozen-in</b> toroidal magnetic <b>flux.</b> The pile-up of convected flux at this "stagnation region " amplifies the toroidal magnetic field and increases the pinch force, thereby collimating the jet...|$|R

A 100 kA current generates a toroidal magnetic field; the toroidal field pressure inflates the poloidal flux surface, magnetically driving the jet. The jet travels {{at up to}} 50 km/s for ∼ 20 – 25 cm before colliding with a cloud of initially neutral gas. We study {{the interaction of the}} jet and the cloud in analogy to an astrophysical jet impacting a molecular cloud. Diagnostics include magnetic probe arrays, a 12 -channel spectroscopic system and a fast camera with optical filters. When a hydrogen plasma jet collides with an argon target cloud, magnetic measurements show the magnetic flux compressing as the plasma jet deforms. As the plasma jet front slows and the plasma piles up, the density of the <b>frozen-in</b> magnetic <b>flux</b> increases...|$|R
40|$|Unlike the {{thermodynamic}} equipartition {{of energy}} in conservative systems, turbulent equipartitions (TEP) describe strongly non-equilibrium systems such as turbulent plasmas. In turbulent systems, energy {{is no longer a}} good invariant, but one can utilize the conservation of other quantities, such as adiabatic invariants, <b>frozen-in</b> magnetic <b>flux,</b> entropy, or combination thereof, in order to derive new, turbulent quasi-equilibria. These TEP equilibria assume various forms, but in general they sustain spatially inhomogeneous distributions of the usual thermodynamic quantities such as density or temperature. This mechanism explains the effects of particle and energy pinch in tokamaks. The analysis of the relaxed states caused by turbulent mixing is based on the existence of Lagrangian invariants (quantities constant along fluid-particle or other orbits). A turbulent equipartition corresponds to the spatially uniform distribution of relevant Lagrangian invariants. The existence of such turbulent equilibria is demonstrated in the simple model of two dimensional electrostatically turbulent plasma in an inhomogeneous magnetic field. The turbulence is prescribed, and the turbulent transport is assumed to be much stronger than the classical collisional transport. The simplicity of the model makes it possible to derive the equations describing the relaxation to the TEP state in several limits...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The Geospace Environment Modeling (GEM) Challenge Harris current sheet {{problem is}} {{simulated}} in 2 1 / 2 dimensions using full particle, hybrid, and Hall MHD simulations. The same gross reconnection rate {{is found in}} all of the simulations independent of the type of code used, as long as the Hall term is included. In addition, the reconnection rate is independent of the mechanism which breaks the <b>frozen-in</b> <b>flux</b> condition, whether it is electron inertia or grid scale diffusion. The insensitivity to the mechanism which breaks the frozen-in condition is a consequence of whistler waves, which control the plasma dynamics at the small scales where the ions become unmagnetized. The dispersive character of whistlers, in which the phase velocity increases with decreasing scale size, allows the flux of electrons flowing away from the dissipation region to remain finite even as the strength of the dissipation approaches zero. As a consequence, the throttling of the reconnection process {{as a result of the}} small scale size of the dissipation region, which occurs in the magnetohydrodynamic model, no longer takes place. The important consequence is that the minimum physical model necessary to produce physically correct reconnection rates is a Hall MHD description which includes the Hall term in Ohm's law. A density depletion layer, which lies just downstream from the magnetic separatrix, is identified and linked to the strong in-plane Hall currents which characterize kinetic models of magnetic reconnection. 1...|$|E
40|$|The Rice Convection Model {{has been}} {{modified}} {{and applied to}} the study of the Jovian magnetospheric system, which is interchange unstable. The basic interchange instability of the Io plasma torus is opposed by pressure gradients in the energetic particles outside the torus. Many simulations have been performed for cases where the overall system is inter-change unstable under the ideal-MHD assumption E + v × B = 0. For such cases, the torus breaks up predominantly into long fingers unless the initial condition strongly favors some other mode. The ends of the fingers tend to be rounded, and they are connected to the main torus by tails that thin rapidly with time if the torus runs out of plasma. Our calculations place an upper limit of ∼ 1 R J on the average distance between fingers. For an initially asymmetric large-scale torus, fingers generally form on a time scale shorter than the one on which the heavy side of the torus falls outwards. However, the fingers form predominantly on the heavy side. Galileo may observe such finger features outside the Io torus, at L ≈ 7 to 15. _x 000 D_ Additionally, in this thesis, drift-wave theory has been used to investigate the effect of energetic (KeV or MeV) particles on the Io torus plasma transport. It is shown that the MHD stability criterion, where the interchange motion would be completely stabilized if the energy density of the hot stabilizing plasma is greater than or dual to 3 / 4 of that of the cold unstable plasma, no longer holds owing to the gradient/curvature drift of the energetic particles. This differential-drift effect, which is a departure from the ideal-MHD and <b>frozen-in</b> <b>flux,</b> may play a significant role in plasma transport in the Jovian magnetosphere...|$|E
40|$|Magnetosphere-Ionosphere (MI) {{coupling}} {{and associated}} with this process electron and ion energization processes have interested scientists for decades and, in spite of experimental and theoretical research efforts, are still ones of the least well known dynamic processes in space plasma physics. The {{reason for this is}} that the numerous physical processes associated with MI coupling occur over multiple spatial lengths and temporal scales. One typical example of MI coupling is large scale ring current (RC) electrodynamic coupling that includes calculation of the magnetospheric electric field that is consistent with the ring current (RC) distribution. A general scheme for numerical simulation of such large-scale magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling processes has been presented earlier in many works. The mathematical formulation of these models are based on "modified <b>frozen-in</b> <b>flux</b> theorem" for an ensemble of adiabatically drifting particles in the magnetosphere. By tracking the flow of particles through the inner magnetosphere, the bounce-averaged phase space density of the hot ions and electrons can be reconstructed and the magnetospheric electric field can be calculated such that it is consistent with the particle distribution in the magnetosphere. The new a self-consistent ring current model has been developed that couples electron and ion magnetospheric dynamics with calculation of electric field. Two new features were taken into account in addition to the RC ions, we solve an electron kinetic equation in our model, self-consistently including these results in the solution. Second, using different analytical relationships, we calculate the height integrated ionospheric conductances as the function of precipitated high energy magnetospheric electrons and ions as produced by our model. This results in fundamental changes to the electric potential pattern in the inner magnetosphere, with a smaller Alfven boundary than previous potential formulations would predict but one consistent with recent satellite observations. This leads to deeper penetration of the plasma sheet ions and electrons into the inner magnetosphere and more effective ring current ions and electron energization...|$|E

40|$|Two {{types of}} Eulerian action {{principles}} for relativistic extended magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) are formulated. With the first, {{the action is}} extremized under the constraints of density, entropy, and Lagrangian label conservation, {{which leads to a}} Clebsch representation for a generalized momentum and a generalized vector potential. The second action arises upon transformation to physical field variables, giving rise to a covariant bracket action principle, i. e., a variational principle in which constrained variations are generated by a degenerate Poisson bracket. Upon taking appropriate limits, the action principles lead to relativistic Hall MHD and well-known relativistic ideal MHD. For the first time, the Hamiltonian formulation of relativistic Hall MHD with electron thermal inertia (akin to [Comisso et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 045001 (2014) ] for the electron [...] positron plasma) is introduced. This thermal inertia effect allows for violation of the <b>frozen-in</b> magnetic <b>flux</b> condition in marked contrast to nonrelativistic Hall MHD that does satisfy the frozen-in condition. We also find violation of the frozen-in condition is accompanied by freezing-in of an alternative flux determined by a generalized vector potential. Finally, we derive a more general 3 + 1 Poisson bracket for nonrelativistic extended MHD, one that does not assume smallness of the electron ion mass ratio...|$|R
40|$|The Seyfert galaxy NGC 1097 has an {{extended}} neutral hydrogen disk, a companion, a prominent bar and a luminous circumnuclear starburst "ring". Magnetic fields as revealed by nonthermal radio-continuum emissions correlate {{well with the}} optical barred spiral structure on large scales, have a gross enhancement overlapping with the optical/infrared "ring", and show a trailing swirl around and within the "ring". We propose a scenario of bar-excited long-trailing fast magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) density waves at the modified inner Lindblad resonance (mILR), physically identified with the outer rim of the "ring". These sustained outgoing long-waves are bounced back by the Q_M-barrier {{in the form of}} incoming short-trailing waves. The damping of these waves deposits a negative angular momentum into the magnetized circumnuclear gas disk. Thus, gas materials spiral inward, bring in <b>frozen-in</b> magnetic <b>flux,</b> and accumulate inside the mILR to create a circular zone of high density and magnetic flux vulnerable to massive star formation. Depending on the wave damping efficiency, this process may simultaneously sustain a net mass inflow across the "ring" and toward the nucleus. A wavelet analysis on a Hubble Space Telescope image of central NGC 1097 shows a distinct two-arm spiral structure extended down to the nucleus as a strong evidence for circumnuclear MHD density waves. We predict that magnetic-field observations with improved sensitivity and resolution would reveal a specific correspondence between circumnuclear optical and magnetic field spirals much as those known to exist on large scales in nearby spiral galaxies, including NGC 1097.

40|$|Abstract. Collisionless {{magnetic}} reconnection isstudied using a 2 1 / 2 -dimensional hybrid code including Hall {{dynamics and}} electron inertia. The simulations {{reveal that the}} dissipation region develops a two-scale structure: an inner electron region and an outer ion region. Close to the X line is a region with a scale of the electron collisionless kin depth, where the electron flows completely dominate those of the ions and the <b>frozen-in</b> magnetic <b>flux</b> constraint is broken. Outside of this region and encompassing {{the rest of the}} dissipation region, which scales like C/Wpi, the ion inertial length, is the Hall region where the electrons are frozen-in to the magnetic field but the ions are not, allowing the two species to flow at different velocities. The decoupling of electron and ion motion in the dissipation region has important implications for the rate of magnetic reconnection in collisionless plasma: the ions are not constrained to flow through the very narrow region where the frozen-in constraint is broken so that ion flux into the dissipation region is large. For the simulations which have been completed to date, the resulting rate of reconnection is a substantial fraction of the Alfv 6 n velocity and is controlled by the ions, not the electrons. The dynamics of the ions is found to be inherently nonfluid-like, with multiple ion beams present both at the X line and at the downstream boundary between the inflow and outflow plasma. The reconnection rate is only slightly affected by the temperature of the inflowing ions and in particular the structure of the dissipation region is controlled by the ion inertial ength C/Wpi and not the ion Larmor radius based on the incoming ion temperature. 1...|$|R
40|$|It {{is shown}} that {{electric}} current flowing along an axially non-uniform magnetic flux tube produces an associated non-linear, non-conservative axial MHD force which pumps plasma from regions where the flux tube diameter is small to regions {{where it is}} large. In particular, this force will ingest plasma into the ends of a fat, initially potential flux tube and then pump the ingested plasma towards the middle bulge, thereby causing mass accumulation at the bulge. The ingested plasma convects <b>frozen-in</b> toroidal magnetic <b>flux</b> which accumulates at the middle as well. Flux accumulation at the bulge has the remarkable consequence of causing the bulge to diminish so that the flux tube becomes axially uniform as observed in coronal loops. Stagnation of the convergent plasma flow at the middle heats the plasma. A small number of tail particles bouncing synchronously between approaching fluid elements can be Fermi-accelerated to very high energies. Since driving a current along a flux tube is tantamount to helicity injection into the flux tube, this mass ingestion, heating, and straightening should be ubiquitous to helicity injection processes.

40|$|It {{is shown}} {{that if a}} {{current-carrying}} magnetic flux tube is bulged at its axial midpoint z= 0 and constricted at its axial endpoints z=+h,-h, then plasma will be accelerated from z=+h,-h towards z= 0 resulting in a situation similar to two water jets pointed at each other. The ingested plasma convects embedded, <b>frozen-in</b> toroidal magnetic <b>flux</b> from z=+h,-h to z= 0. The counter-directed flows collide and stagnate at z= 0 {{and in so doing}} (i) convert their translational kinetic energy into heat, (ii) increase the plasma density at z~ 0, and (iii) increase the embedded toroidal flux density at z~ 0. The increase in toroidal flux density at z~ 0 increases the toroidal field Bphi and hence increases the magnetic pinch force at z~ 0 and so causes a reduction of the flux tube radius at z~ 0. Thus, the flux tube develops an axially uniform cross-section, a decreased volume, an increased density, and an increased temperature. This model is proposed as a likely hypothesis for the long-standing mystery of why solar coronal loops are observed to be axially uniform, hot, and bright.

40|$|An {{experimental}} program underway at Caltech {{has produced}} plasmas where the shape is neither fixed by the vacuum chamber nor fixed by an external coil set, but instead {{is determined by}} self-organization. The plasma dynamics is highly reproducible and so can be studied in considerable detail even though the morphology of the plasma is both complex and time-dependent. A surprising result has been the observation that self-collimating MHD-driven plasma jets are ubiquitous and play {{a fundamental role in}} the self-organization. The jets can be considered lab-scale simulations of astrophysical jets and in addition are intimately related to solar coronal loops. The jets are driven by the combination of the axial component of the J×B force and the axial pressure gradient resulting from the non-uniform pinch force associated with the flared axial current density. Behavior is consistent with a model showing that collimation results from axial non-uniformity of the jet velocity. In particular, flow stagnation in the jet frame compresses <b>frozen-in</b> azimuthal magnetic <b>flux,</b> squeezes together toroidal magnetic field lines, thereby amplifying the embedded toroidal magnetic field, enhancing the pinch force, and hence causing collimation of the jet...|$|R
40|$|Two {{distinct}} models {{account for}} the microwave residual sur-face resistance of superconducting cavities with equally good agreement with the measured temperature and frequency depend-ence. In presenting his phonon generation model, Passow claimed that Rabinowitz’s fluxoid power loss model of residual resistance does not fit the experimental data, whereas his does. In fact, the two models have essentially the same temperature and frequency dependence. {Submitted to Phys. Rev.) *Work supported by the U. S. Atomic Energy Commission. An analysis presented by Passowl showed that phonons generated in a superconductor by incident electromagnetic radiation result in a residual power loss with an equivalent surface resistance which agrees well with experimental measurements of temperature and frequency dependence. His expression for surface resistance is (1) The first term represents the superconducting surface resistance derived from the BCS theory. 2, 3 The second term {{is related to the}} power loss as electromagnetic energy is transformed into acoustical energy. He claims that this latter term becomes dominant in superconductors at low temperatures, and that it llcan {{account for the}} whole of the low-temperature surface resistance measured in the purest currently available materials. ” He goes on further to say, “Rabinowitz has tried to explain the residual surface rf resistance in terms of <b>frozen-in</b> magnetic <b>flux.</b> 4 However, experiments with cavities in high magnetic fields are reported to show a different frequency dependence from that predicted by his treatment. ” Passow acted on a remark made by Kneisel et al., 7 who evaluated their experiments to investigate the influence of frozen flux on the surface resistance. The oscillating fluxoid power loss occurs in addition to the well-known BCS superconducting loss 2, 3 and dominates over it at low temperature. The super-conducting loss decreases rapidly with decreasing temperature at low tempera-ture, whereas the fluxoid loss has a negligible temperature dependence at low temperature in agreement with experimental observations. The effective re-sistivity of an oscillating fluxoid is 495. ...|$|R
40|$|Suppose an {{electric}} current I flows along a magnetic flux tube that has poloidal flux psi and radius a = a(z), where z is the axial position along the flux tube. This current creates a {{toroidal magnetic field}} Bphi. It is shown that, in such a case, nonlinear, nonconservative J×B forces accelerate plasma axially from regions of small a to regions of large a and that this acceleration is proportional to [partial-derivative]I 2 /[partial-derivative]z. Thus, if a current-carrying flux tube is bulged at, say, z = 0 and constricted at, say, z = ±h, then plasma will be accelerated from z = ±h towards z = 0 resulting in a situation similar to two water jets pointed at each other. The ingested plasma convects embedded, <b>frozen-in</b> toroidal magnetic <b>flux</b> from z = ±h to z = 0. The counterdirected flows collide and stagnate at z = 0 {{and in so doing}} (i) convert their translational kinetic energy into heat, (ii) increase the plasma density at z[approximate] 0, and (iii) increase the embedded toroidal flux density at z[approximate] 0. The increase in toroidal flux density at z[approximate] 0 increases Bphi and hence increases the magnetic pinch force at z[approximate] 0 and so causes a reduction of a(0). Thus, the flux tube develops an axially uniform cross section, a decreased volume, an increased density, and an increased temperature. This model is proposed as a likely hypothesis for the long-standing mystery of why solar coronal loops are observed to be axially uniform, hot, and bright. It is furthermore argued that a small number of tail particles bouncing between the approaching counterstreaming plasma jets should be Fermi accelerated to extreme energies. Finally, analytic solution of the Grad–Shafranov equation predicts that a flux tube becomes axially uniform when the ingested plasma becomes hot and dense enough to have 2 µ 0 nkappaT/B pol 2 = (µ 0 Ia(0) /psi) 2 / 2; observed coronal loop parameters are in reasonable agreement with this relationship which is analogous to having betapol = 1 in a tokamak...|$|R
