5|$|Marie Stopes and David Watson {{analysed}} coal ball {{samples and}} decided that coal balls formed <b>in</b> <b>situ.</b> They {{stressed the importance of}} interaction with seawater, believing that it was necessary for the formation of coal balls. Some supporters of the <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> theory believe that Stopes' and Watson's discovery of a plant stem extending through multiple coal balls shows that coal balls formed <b>in</b> <b>situ,</b> stating that the drift theory fails to explain Stopes' and Watson's observation. They also cite fragile pieces of organic material projecting outside some coal balls, contending that if the drift theory was correct, the projections would have been destroyed, and some large coal balls are large enough that they could never have been able to be transported in the first place.|$|E

5|$|Conservation of cacti can be <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> or ex situ. <b>In</b> <b>situ</b> {{conservation}} involves preserving habits through {{enforcement of}} legal protection {{and the creation}} of specially protected areas such as national parks and reserves.

Latin American examples include Parque Nacional del Pinacate, Sonora, Mexico and Pan de Azúcar National Park, Chile. Ex situ conservation aims to preserve plants and seeds outside their natural habitats, often with the intention of later reintroduction.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The wild {{relatives}} of crops represent {{a major source}} of valuable traits for crop improvement. These resources are threatened by habitat destruction, land use changes, and other factors, requiring their urgent collection and long-term availability for research and breeding from ex situ collections. We propose a method to identify gaps <b>in</b> ex <b>situ</b> collections (i. e. gap analysis) of crop wild relatives as a means to guide efficient and effective collecting activities. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The methodology prioritizes among taxa based on a combination of sampling, geographic, and environmental gaps. We apply the gap analysis methodology to wild taxa of the Phaseolus genepool. Of 85 taxa, 48 (56. 5 %) are assigned high priority for collecting due to lack of, or under-representation, in genebanks, 17 taxa are given medium priority for collecting, 15 low priority, and 5 species are assessed as adequately represented <b>in</b> ex <b>situ</b> collections. Gap "hotspots", representing priority target areas for collecting, are concentrated in central Mexico, although the narrow endemic nature of a suite of priority species adds a number of specific additional regions to spatial collecting priorities. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Results of the gap analysis method mostly align very well with expert opinion of gaps <b>in</b> ex <b>situ</b> collections, with only a few exceptions. A more detailed prioritization of taxa and geographic areas for collection can be achieved by including in the analysis predictive threat factors, such as climate change or habitat destruction, or by adding additional prioritization filters, such as the degree of relatedness to cultivated species (i. e. ease of use in crop breeding). Furthermore, results for multiple crop genepools may be overlaid, which would allow a global analysis of gaps <b>in</b> ex <b>situ</b> collections of the world's plant genetic resources...|$|R
