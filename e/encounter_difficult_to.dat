30|$|Researchers {{indicate}} the explicit evidence on corporate foresight for companies and organizations still {{suffering from the}} lack of a framework to encounter future economic conditions as well as assuring all relevant external changes and providing proper responses. Many researchers have attempted to provide such framework for foresight. However, {{there is a lack of}} models for organizations and companies, and many authors including Rohrbeck and Bade [27] believe that these models are not responsive to a proper model for corporate foresight. Therefore, it is necessary to utilize foresight in corporations <b>to</b> <b>encounter</b> <b>difficult</b> future conditions, <b>to</b> forecast future trends, and to identify and interpret weak signals and entry into new markets. On the other hand, there are some barriers for the successful execution of foresight models such as future inaccessibility, changes in forecasts, contribution increases, keeping different insights, data collection, cost reduction, and needs for new methods. These barriers need to be taken into consideration to develop foresight capacities in organizations [27].|$|R

40|$|Consider {{the design}} of {{transfer}} trajectories to {{the vicinity of the}} Sun-Earth collinear libration points. First, note that the equilibrium points actually exist only in the circular restricted three-body problem (CROP). Second, conic solutions are generally not useful (even as initial guesses). Therefore, for libration point missions, most of the qualitative analysis must be accomplished {{from the perspective of a}} model with, at least, three bodies. Unfortunately, in some cases, the qualitative behavior that is apparent in the CR 3 BP might be completely lost due to lunar perturbations. Alternatively, a transfer strategy to exploit the potential advantage of the Moon 2 ̆ 7 s presence through gravitational <b>encounters</b> is <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> implement within the context of either the CR 3 BP or a model that employs ephemeris information for the Sun and Earth locations. Clearly, a formulation of the four-body problem is warranted. To maximize the four-body model as a useful component, special solutions—such as periodic and quasi-periodic trajectories in the restricted four-body problem—are initially isolated and identified. Semi-analytical approximations (for the special solutions) are obtained with the method of spectral balance and refined via differential corrections. Then, an analysis from the perspective of dynamical systems proceeds. Such an approach is employed in the Sun-Earth system to develop transfer options to L 2 Lissajous trajectories; subsequent applications include NASA 2 ̆ 7 s Microwave Anisotropy Probe (MAP) mission. ...|$|R

To investigate the effects of mobility, we use a simulator to compare encounters between devices with those inferred by scanners. We show that the statistical properties of scanned encounters differ from actual device encounters in ways which impact malware propagation dynamics, a form of aggressive data dissemination. In addition to helping us understand the limitations of encounter data gathered by scanners in the field, our use of virtual scanners suggests a practical method for using these empirical datasets to better inform simulations of proximity malware outbreaks and similar data dissemination applications...|$|R

The Saamis of both Denmark—Norway and Sweden—Finland had been christianized for decade. The main problem for the Church authorities turned out to be that of making the Saamis abandon their indigenous religious customs. From {{the end of the}} 17 th century, an intense period of propaganda and coercion began to make the Saamis abandon these non Christian elements in their religion. For the Saamis, the drums represented their threatened culture, the resistance against the Christian claim to exclusiveness, and a striving to preserve traditional values. The drums had a twofold role to play in the religious encounter. They were both foci of the confrontation and sources documenting and structuring it. The fight between old and new beliefs is to some extent possible to follow in the records from the district and county courts.

However, when low-levels HLA/peptide tetramer-positive T cell populations are <b>encountered,</b> it is <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> ascertain whether {{this represents a}} true T cell receptor (TCR) -mediated interaction or background signal. To address this issue, we have developed a method for both HLA class I and class II tetramer assays to confirm tetramer-binding to the TCR/CD 3 complex. Preincubation of T cells with anti-CD 3 mAb SPV-T 3 b and subsequent crosslinking interferes with the binding of HLA/peptide tetramers to the TCR/CD 3 complex and thereby indicates to what extent HLA/peptide tetramer binds through interaction with TCR/CD 3 complex. SPV-T 3 b pretreatment results in a 2 - to 10 -fold decrease in tetramer-binding intensity to antigen-specific CD 8 + or CD 4 + T cells, whereas background reactivity of HLA/peptide tetramers containing HIV-derived peptide in HIV-negative donors remained unchanged.

40|$|In recent decades, {{advances}} in computational methods and experimental biophysical techniques have improved {{our understanding of}} protein folding. Although some of these advances have been remarkable, the structural variability of globular proteins usually <b>encountered</b> makes it <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> extract general features of their folding processes. To overcome this difficulty, experimental and computational studies of the folding of repeat (or modular) proteins are of interest. Because their native structures {{can be described as}} linear arrays of the same, repeated, supersecondary structure unit, it is possible to seek a possibly independent behavior of the different modules without taking into account the intrinsic stability associated with different secondary structure motifs. In this work we have used a Monte Carlo-based simulation to study the folding equilibrium of four repeat proteins belonging to the tetratricopeptide repeat family. Our studies provide new insights into their energy profiles, enabling investigation about the existence of intermediate states and their relative stabilities. We have also performed structural analyses to describe the structure of these intermediates, going through the vast number of conformations obtained from the simulations. In this way, we have tried to identify the regions of each protein in which the modular structure yields a different behavior and, more specifically, regions of the proteins that can stay folded {{when the rest of the}} chain has been thermally denatured...|$|R

40|$|Current {{guidelines}} {{recommend the}} use of warfarin in all patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and/or an artificial heart valve who {{are at high risk}} of thromboembolism. While anticoagulation with warfarin greatly reduces this risk, a careful system of monitoring and management is necessary to maintain a therapeutic dose and minimize adverse events. This rigorous process places a burden on providers, and many patients managed in typical office practices are not optimally anticoagulated. To improve the quality and efficiency of anticoagulation and remove its burden from office-based physicians, newer treatment models have evolved, including anticoagulation clinics and self-monitoring by patients at home. While these newer models often incorporate innovative programs to streamline warfarin management, little is known about their individual or relative economic merits or those of traditional office-based care. The routine costs of anticoagulation within any model have not been well documented. The cost of warfarin is readily available; however, attendant expenses, such as dose adjustment, laboratory testing, and medical <b>encounters,</b> are <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> gauge. Because of these challenges in collecting practice data, most estimates of the cost of anticoagulation services have relied upon assumptions about practice patterns. Assessing the cost of anticoagulation is easier in a clinic setting because all costs relate exclusively to anticoagulation. A recent study of anticoagulation clinics estimated that annual direct costs per patient for anticoagulation services totaled approximately $US 280 -$US 380 (2002 values). Bleeding and other complications experienced by anticoagulated patients add additional types of costs, with inpatient care accounting for more than one-half of the total cost of managing excessive anticoagulation. When quality of life is considered alongside costs to gauge the cost effectiveness of warfarin therapy versus aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), warfarin appears to be cost-saving in patients at high stroke risk and cost effective in those at moderate risk. For patients at lower risk of stroke, aspirin is more cost effective than warfarin. With the aging of the population and consequent increases in patient groups requiring anticoagulation, the US healthcare system greatly needs improvements to anticoagulation management. New research must determine which models of management will provide the most favorable outcomes for high-risk patients at the lowest cost to payors and society. Warfarin...|$|R
40|$|As {{a result}} of being hunted, animals often alter their {{behaviour}} in ways that make future encounters with predators less likely. When hunting is carried out for conservation, for example to control invasive species, these behavioural changes can inadvertently impede the success of future efforts. We examined the effects of repeated culling by spearing on the behaviour of invasive predatory lionfish (Pterois volitans/miles) on Bahamian coral reef patches. We compared the extent of concealment and activity levels of lionfish at dawn and midday on 16 coral reef patches off Eleuthera, The Bahamas. Eight of the patches had been subjected to regular daytime removals of lionfish by spearing for two years. We also estimated the distance at which lionfish became alert to slowly approaching divers on culled and unculled reef patches. Lionfish on culled reefs were less active and hid deeper within the reef during the day than lionfish on patches where no culling had occurred. There were no differences at dawn when removals do not take place. Lionfish on culled reefs also adopted an alert posture at a greater distance from divers than lionfish on unculled reefs. More crepuscular activity likely leads to greater encounter rates by lionfish with more native fish species because the abundance of reef fish outside of shelters typically peaks at dawn and dusk. Hiding deeper within the reef could also make remaining lionfish less likely to be <b>encountered</b> and more <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> catch by spearfishers during culling efforts.
