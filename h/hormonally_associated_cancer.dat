5000|$|Pathologists {{classify}} intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) {{into two}} broad groups - {{those that are}} associated with an invasive cancer and those that are not associated with an invasive cancer. This separation has critical prognostic significance. Patients with a surgically resected intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm without an <b>associated</b> invasive <b>cancer</b> have an excellent prognosis (>95% will be cured), while patients with a surgically resected intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm with an <b>associated</b> invasive <b>cancer</b> have a worse prognosis. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms without an <b>associated</b> invasive <b>cancer</b> can be further subcategorized into three groups. They are IPMN with low-grade dysplasia, IPMN with moderate dysplasia, and IPMN with high-grade dysplasia. This categorization is less important [...] than the separation of IPMNs with an <b>associated</b> <b>cancer</b> from IPMNs without an <b>associated</b> invasive <b>cancer,</b> but this categorization is useful as IPMNs are believed to progress from low-grade dysplasia to moderate dysplasia to high-grade dysplasia to an IPMN with an <b>associated</b> invasive <b>cancer.</b>|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Loss of E-cadherin {{expression}} {{has been}} implicated {{in the development of}} invasive characteristics in colorectal carcinomas. Failure to express E-cadherin may result from mutations of the E-cadherin gene (HSECAD). AIMS: To examine the correlation between E-cadherin expression and genetic changes at HSECAD; and to examine differences in E-cadherin expression and genetic changes at HSECAD between three different groups of colorectal cancer [...] replication error positive (RER+) sporadic cancers, RER [...] sporadic cancers and ulcerative colitis <b>associated</b> <b>cancers.</b> SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Sixty eight colorectal cancers (22 RER+ sporadic cancers, 32 RER- sporadic cancers and 14 ulcerative colitis <b>associated</b> <b>cancers)</b> were studied using immunohistochemistry and for allele loss at the HSECAD locus. Exon 16 of HSECAD contains several mononucleotide repeat tracts which are very similar to microsatellite repeats and which may be susceptible to replication errors (manifest as new alleles). All cases were also examined for new alleles in exon 16. RESULTS: Absent or decreased E-cadherin protein expression was found in 27 (38 %) of 68 colorectal cancers and the pattern of expression did not differ significantly among the three tumour groups. Allele loss occurred at HSECAD in four (10 %) of 40 informative cancers and there were no differences between the three subgroups. New alleles at exon 16 were detected in three (14 %) of 22 RER+ tumours; no new alleles were detected in RER- or ulcerative colitis <b>associated</b> <b>cancers.</b> Overall, there was no correlation between allelic loss or exon 16 replication errors and immunohistochemical E-cadherin expression. CONCLUSIONS: (1) Loss of E-cadherin expression probably does not occur as a result of mutation at the HSECAD locus in colorectal cancers. (2) There is no difference in the frequency of loss of heterozygosity at HSECAD among RER+, RER- and ulcerative colitis <b>associated</b> colorectal <b>cancers...</b>|$|R

40|$|Insomnia {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{frequently}} reported and debilitating difficulties <b>associated</b> with <b>cancer.</b> Recent decades have seen a move from pharmacological interventions for insomnia, to non-pharmacological, cognitive behavioural therapies (CBT-I). Numerous clinical trials have established the effectiveness of CBT-I in the general population and more recently, in those with insomnia <b>associated</b> with <b>cancer.</b> However, despite these promising outcomes, the availability of such therapies remains limited across cancer services. Recent years have seen developments to widen access to CBT-I, including the use of internet-based resources. Such developments may offer a useful means of overcoming the availability and access issues of CBT-I for those with insomnia <b>associated</b> with <b>cancer...</b>|$|R
