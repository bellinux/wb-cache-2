5|$|Austria and {{the states}} of the Habsburg monarchy officially <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> {{standard}} since 1761, and Prussia, followed by its neighbours Anhalt, Lippe and Mecklenburg, would diverge in the opposite direction with a reform in 1816.

5000|$|In {{his speech}} to the NAACP, Wright speculated that, [...] "Africans <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> meter, and Africans <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> tonality. Europeans <b>have</b> seven tones, Africans have five. White people clap {{differently}} than black people. Africans and African-Americans are right-brained, subject-oriented in their learning style. They <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> way of learning." [...] The comments were labeled as racist, and likened to eugenics.

50|$|Mixed {{ability is}} a {{proposed}} new term {{to be used}} in place of the terms disabled, handicapped, abnormal, and crippled. Mixed ability refers to any person who <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> or mixed physical ability. It can also refer to anyone who <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> emotional or learning ability. Words like disabled, crippled, and handicapped have negative connotations throughout history. Mixed ability contemporizes the label placed on those who <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> or medically documented physical or mental abilities and attempts to relieve any social or conversational stigma.|$|R
5|$|In 1994, {{the band}} listened to {{hundreds}} of tapes sent in by vocalists before convincing Blaze Bayley, formerly of the band Wolfsbane who had supported Iron Maiden in 1990, to audition for them. Harris' preferred choice from the outset, Bayley <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> vocal style from his predecessor, which ultimately received a mixed reception among fans.|$|E
5|$|Two other {{machines}} were built: {{one for a}} joint British Petroleum/University of London consortium, {{and the other for}} the Atlas Computer Laboratory at Chilton near Oxford. A derivative system was built by Ferranti for Cambridge University, called the Titan or Atlas 2, which <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> memory organisation, and ran a time-sharing operating system developed by Cambridge Computer Laboratory.|$|E
5|$|All {{but one of}} the trams had a SV36-bogie from Strømmens Værksted. The two bogies, {{each with}} two axles, were {{attached}} to the steel crossbeam. The aluminium body was attached to the crossbeam with leaf springs. The bogie frames were fastened to the axle box via a revolute joint and a spiral spring. Each bogie had two motors, each controlling one axle. In 1941, no. 187 was equipped with a SV41-bogie from Strømmen; it <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> spring system that allowed the tram to remain at the same height independent of the weight.|$|E

5|$|Filming for series 3 {{began in}} November 2012, with an airing date {{scheduled}} for May 2013. In November Jones and Sharp were photographed filming {{on location in}} Manchester for the series. As the fourth series <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> air date (its television broadcast began in September, unlike May for the three previous series) it became the first series not to be filmed in the winter months. A longer break in production between series 3 and 4 was {{the reason that the}} fourth series was instead filmed in summer.|$|E
5|$|From 1929 until 1960, {{the road}} {{was part of the}} state highway system as M-135. The {{northern}} end of the highway always contained a section that ran concurrently with M-98, another state highway in the area. For a period in the 1950s, M-135 <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> northern terminus separate from M-98's endpoint. A few years before both highways were removed from the highway system, M-135 was moved to use M-98's terminus with M-28. Since the 1970s, M-135 {{has been a part of}} the county-designated highway system and assigned the number H-33, a moniker it has borne since.|$|E
5|$|Khalifa {{has also}} said that her parents have stopped {{speaking}} to her because of her career choice.

They {{also said that}} they hoped that she would leave pornography, saying that her image did not honor her family or her home country.|$|E

5|$|Lambert <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> visual {{aspect of}} the song on her mind. She {{felt that it was}} more about ecstasy, {{especially}} a sexual one, and how it related to religious ecstasy. She listened to the song with Madonna a number of times and together decided to include the ecstasy part. A sub-plot about Madonna as a homicide witness was included, which became the trigger for the sexual and religious ecstasy. Actor Leon Robinson was hired {{to play the role of}} a saint; the part was inspired by Martin de Porres, the patron saint of mixed-race people and all those seeking interracial harmony.|$|E
5|$|Periyar {{stated that}} the caste system in south India is, due to Indo-Aryan influence, linked {{with the arrival of}} Brahmins from the north. Ancient Tamil Nadu (part of Tamilakkam) <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> {{stratification}} of society in four or five regions (Tinai), determined by natural surroundings and adequate means of living. Periyar also argued that birds, animals, and worms, which are considered to be devoid of rationalism do not create castes, or differences of high and low in their own species. But man, considered to be a rational being, was suffering from these because of religion and discrimination.|$|E
5|$|Su-35UB: Two-seat trainer {{designed}} and built by KnAAPO. The single aircraft (T-10UBM-1) featured the canards and taller vertical tails of the Su-27M and a forward fuselage similar to the Su-30MKK. The Su-35UB also shared the avionics suite of the Su-30MKK, although it <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> fly-by-wire flight-control system to accommodate the canards. The aircraft was powered by AL-31FP engines with thrust-vectoring nozzles. Although a training aircraft, the Su-35UB {{was designed to be}} fully combat-capable.|$|E

5|$|That same year, J.J. Thomson {{conducted}} {{an experiment in}} which he channeled a stream of neon ions through magnetic and electric fields, striking a photographic plate at the other end. He observed two glowing patches on the plate, which suggested two different deflection trajectories. Thomson concluded this was {{because some of the}} neon ions <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> mass. The nature of this differing mass would later be explained by the discovery of neutrons in 1932.|$|E
5|$|The M21 <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> layout {{from the}} early M4 and M4A1 MMC, {{as it was the}} {{replacement}} of the M4. The major difference, was that the M21 and the M4 were based on different half-tracks (the M4 was based on the M2 Half-track while the M21 was based on the M3 Half-track). The major difference was the location and direction of the mortar (the M4's mortar was rear-facing and was near the back, while the M21's mortar was front-facing and was closer to the front).|$|E
5|$|There was a {{brief period}} when the episode <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> subplot that {{revolved}} around the restaurant chain Planet Hollywood. Groening {{had been told by}} a spokesperson that if he put Planet Hollywood in The Simpsons, the creators of the restaurant, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis, and Sylvester Stallone, would agree to make guest appearances on the show. The writers of The Simpsons were excited about this so they wrote a new subplot for the episode that featured Planet Hollywood and the three actors. However, for unknown reasons, they were unable to appear in the episode.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the chronicle}} {{indirectly}} implies that Rögnvaldr {{was also a}} son of Finnguala, {{there is evidence that}} strongly suggests that he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> mother. Within a letter from Óláfr to HenryII, King of England, Óláfr describes Rögnvaldr as a bastard. Further evidence is found within a Gaelic praise-poem of Rögnvaldr, which states that he was a son of Sadb, an otherwise unknown Irishwoman who may have been an unrecorded wife or concubine of Guðrøðr. The chronicle records that because Óláfr was only a child {{at the time of his}} father's death, the Manxmen chose Rögnvaldr to rule instead, describing him as a vigorous and hardier man. The chronicle states that Rögnvaldr began his reign the following year, in 1188.|$|E
5|$|As the {{composition}} is not precisely defined, some states {{which have a}} considerable division of executive power can {{find it difficult to}} decide who should attend the meetings. While an MEP, Alexander Stubb argued that {{there was no need for}} the President of Finland to attend Council meetings with or instead of the Prime Minister of Finland (who was head of European foreign policy). In 2008, having become Finnish Foreign Minister, Stubb was forced out of the Finnish delegation to the emergency council meeting on the Georgian crisis because the President wanted to attend the high-profile summit as well as the Prime Minister (only two people from each country could attend the meetings). This was despite Stubb being head of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe at the time which was heavily involved in the crisis. Problems also occurred in Poland where the President of Poland and the Prime Minister of Poland were of different parties and <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> foreign policy response to the crisis. A similar situation arose in Romania between President Traian Băsescu and Prime Minister Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu in 2007–2008 and again in 2012 with Prime Minister Victor Ponta, who both opposed the president.|$|E
5|$|At first, {{the game}} was titled Parasite, and {{was meant to be}} {{unrelated}} to the Infinity series, but when development began in May 2003, it was codenamed Project Infinity 3. In September of the same year, they added the subtitle The Age of Infinity. Development was troubled by creative differences between Nakazawa and Uchikoshi; Nakazawa was unhappy with Uchikoshi's idea for the game's ending, and <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> ending in mind, which they were having disagreements over. They also did not have the time to write everything that they had wanted, so they ended up with an ending that Uchikoshi described as only being half-finished. At the time of the game's release, a sequel was planned, which would have included a conclusion to the game's story. In 2013, Uchikoshi looked back on the game, saying that while {{he would have liked to}} rewrite some portions of the scenario that he felt were boring or that did not advance the story much, he would not have changed or added anything in terms of the content of the game; he felt that his ending was still in the story, and still felt happy with it.|$|E
