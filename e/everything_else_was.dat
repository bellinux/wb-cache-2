25|$|Until {{the mid-1980s}} there was little, if any, new {{investment}} in the sport, with the decline in interest being partially attributed to the complex scoring system, especially {{as it was a}} manual process then.

[...] He {{went on to say that}} based on the crowd reaction the [...] "finish seemed to dampen the enthusiasm of what was otherwise a really good show," [...] and that it was [...] "unfortunate, because everything leading up to that point was good to great." [...] Kapur gave the main event a 3 out of 10, while the Full Metal Mayhem match and the World Tag Team Championship both received a 7 out of 10.

I could have been done, like, a year ago. But being that we were having creative differences — you know, every time they rejected what I was doing, I would {{go back in the}} studio and work on more stuff. The last two songs, 'You Ain't No DJ' and 'Be Still,' were the last two records, but <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> <b>was</b> already on there". Despite his individual release, OutKast as a group remained signed to Jive. After leaving Jive, Big Boi contacted record executive and Island Def Jam CEO/chairman L.A. Reid, who had originally signed OutKast to LaFace in 1992. He played Reid a track from the album, [...] "Fo Yo Sorrows", which persuaded him to actualize a contract for Big Boi. Following two months of negotiations, Big Boi signed a three-album deal with Def Jam Recordings in March 2010.|$|E

2500|$|Progressing {{far beyond}} the {{comparatively}} frivolous musicals and sentimental operettas of the decade, Broadway's Show Boat (1927), represented an even more complete integration of book and score than the Princess Theatre musicals, with dramatic themes told through the music, dialogue, setting and movement. This was accomplished by combining the lyricism of Kern's music with the skillful libretto of Oscar Hammerstein II. One historian wrote, [...] "Here {{we come to a}} completely new genre – the musical play as distinguished from musical comedy.

Howard Greenfield and Helen Miller, the song's co-writers, offered it instead to one of Sedaka's friends, Gene Pitney. Pitney took the existing musical track, replacing Sedaka's lead vocal track with his own. <b>Everything</b> <b>else</b> <b>was</b> Sedaka, including his own arrangement and backing vocals, piano-playing, and usual female backup singers.

Citing Gustave Flaubert, whose work he admired, as an influence, Bunin was [...] "demonstrating that prose could be driven by poetic rhythms, but still remain prose." [...] According to the writer's nephew Pusheshnikov, Bunin once told him: [...] "Apparently I was born a versemaker... like Turgenev, who was a versemaker, first and foremost.

[...] The cheapest version of the car is €5,900, and the price can reach €11,200, depending on equipment and customs duty.

2500|$|The {{play was}} {{performed}} {{for the first}} time at the Stratford Shakespeare Festival in Ontario, Canada in 1978, when it was directed by Brian Bedford, starring William Hutt as Titus, Jennifer Phipps as Tamora, Alan Scarfe as Aaron and Domini Blithe as Lavinia. Bedford went with neither stylisation nor realism; instead the violence simply tended to happen off-stage, but <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> <b>was</b> realistically presented. The play received mixed reviews with some praising its restraint and others arguing that the suppression of the violence went too far. Many cited the final scene, where despite three onstage stabbings, not one drop of blood was visible, and the reveal of Lavinia, where she was totally bloodless despite her mutilation. This production cut Lucius' final speech and instead ended with Aaron alone on the stage as Sibyl predicts the fall of Rome in lines written by Bedford himself. As such, [...] "for affirmation and healing under Lucius the production substituted a sceptical modern theme of evil triumphant and Rome's decadence." ...|$|E
