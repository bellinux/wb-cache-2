He was, however, {{left out of the}} next game, which turned into a gruesome 2-1 defeat against Romania in Bucharest. Greenwood put him back in the side a month later for a now vital match against Switzerland, and Mariner scored the opener in a 2-1 win.|$|E

At some point he stopped doing original designs and went on to produce only new editions of classic faces, or to revise — and usually <b>improve</b> <b>—</b> designs by others. In fact, Lange was not very interested in new designs. He simply wanted the fonts that were released to be very well made — in particular the “classics”. That was his main ambition: any fonts that were submitted were improved under his scrutiny." ...|$|E

When environmental condition deteriorate (e.g. crowding), some of the asexually produced offspring develop into males. The females start producing haploid sexual eggs, which the males fertilise. In species without males, resting eggs are also produced asexually and are diploid. In either case, the resting eggs are protected by a hardened coat called the ephippium, and are cast off at the female's next moult. The ephippia can withstand periods of extreme cold, drought or lack of food availability, and hatch - when conditions <b>improve</b> <b>-</b> into females (They are close to being classed as extremophiles) [...]|$|E

Also, after two years out of the job market, Porcellino got a job at a health food store. In {{the spring and summer of}} 1998 Porcellino again dealt with a severe illness, probably related to pesticide exposure from his years spent as a mosquito abatement worker.

[...] Philps noted that Audus was working [...] "against almost impossible odds and with the most primitive equipment," [...] but that his efforts were [...] "so successful that the onset of blindness was halted in those already affected, no new cases occurred, and other changes due to Vitamin B deficiency began to <b>improve</b> <b>-</b> a remarkable feat of biological manipulation." ...|$|E
