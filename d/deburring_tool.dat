40|$|Cast {{aluminum}} wheels must be deburred {{and polished}} before chrome plating operation. Manual deburring and polishing is tedious and monotonous. Industrial robots are attracting {{more and more}} attention for the deburring applications. However, Each wheel path program was taking eight to ten weeks to create because the position and orientation of the <b>deburring</b> <b>tool</b> must be accurately identified based on the curvature of the wheel. To solve this problem, we developed a practical 6 DOF robot path generation method using hybrid force and visual servoing methodology. The force servoing keeps the robot tool continuously contacting with the wheel surface and the visual servoing controls the robot tool to follow a marked tool path on the wheel while the position and orientation are controlled and recorded. A robot path is then generated from the recorded data. Experiments are performed and the experimental results demonstrate that the developed algorithm {{can be used to}} automatically generate accurate 6 DOF robot paths for deburring aluminum wheels in less than an hour. This significantly reduces the robot programming time. The developed technology can also be used for robot path generation in many other manufacturing applications, such as welding and strip painting. © 2006 IEEE. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|Summary The Advanced Deburring and Chamfer System is robotic workcell {{designed}} to put precision chamfers on parts made with hard metals.

The Unified Telerobotic Architecture Project was a United States Air Force funded project to develop an open architecture for robotic applications for servicing aircraft. The main focus was to develop an architecture with standard interfaces so commercially available components could easily be substituted. This paper will describe how the ADACS workcell controller was implemented through the use of the Unified Telerobotic Architecture Project’s architecture and interfaces. 1 NOTATION AND UNITS ADACS refers to the Advanced Deburring and Chamfering System.

40|$|Removal of burrs at cross-drilled hole intersections {{is often}} tedious and {{expensive}} due to limited accessibility. Automated edge finishing of crossholes has been practiced successfully using robot-assisted, flexible abrasive brush deburring, and non-traditional, mass finishing {{methods such as}} electrochemical deburring (ECD), abrasive slurry, and thermal deburring. These methods are very efficient but most require specialized equipment and dedicated cleaning operations to remove chemicals or trapped brush bristles. The Orbitool is an on-line, localized deburring alternative to brushes recently developed by JWDone Company. The Orbitool is a mechanized cutting tool with carbide edges specifically designed for crosshole deburring. Mechanized cutting provides greater selectivity and control of dimensional specifications compared to brushing and mass finishing methods. Furthermore, it can be implemented using existing machine tool equipment and cleaning procedures. As with any <b>deburring</b> <b>tool,</b> its desired capability is burr removal in the shortest time possible while meeting dimensional and surface quality requirements. To this end, process maps of chamfer width and surface roughness of the deburred edges, plotted against process parameters, were developed in this study. Workpieces consisted of Al 6061 T 6 bars with zero-offset, perpendicular cross-holes with a diameter of 7. 94 mm (5 / 16 in.). The experiments were conducted using Orbitools with a diameter of 6. 35 mm (1 / 4 in.) and 36 cutting edges. The effect of the process inputs and their mutual interaction was assessed using Taguchi methods. The results show that proper selection of process parameters yield consistent and effective removal of burrs at cross-drilled intersections while achieving surface roughness values that range from 15 to 65 ?m at the chamfers...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} solving issues {{concerning}} deburring of hydraulic valve blocks with industrial robot. Thesis {{is focused on}} deburring of inside space of hydraulic valve blocks, although deburring of outer edges is marginally mentioned due to determining of approximate deburring time of all edges on the valve block. Search of <b>deburring</b> methods and <b>tools</b> suitable for <b>deburring</b> of inside and outside edges is {{made on the basis}} of valve blocks´ analysis. Paths of <b>tools</b> chosen for <b>deburring</b> of valve block B 1 are programmed in CAM program. CAD program ProEngineer is used to create simplified model of robotic workplace and its layout. According to customer´s requirements, deburring method, which allows creating universal robotic workplace for deburring of hydraulic valve blocks, was chosen. Approximate deburring time of all edges on B 1 block was set on the basis of tools´ paths and these were checked in the simplified model of robotic workplace in PowerMill Robot Interface.

40|$|Compliant tools, such as {{filamentary}} brushes, {{are being}} increasingly used in modern manufacturing facilities, especially in automated deburring and finishing operations. Although numerous advantages of brushing <b>tools</b> for <b>deburring</b> applications have been cited, the material removal mechanics and dynamic characteristics of such compliant tools {{are not well}} understood. It is recognized {{that there is an}} urgent need to formulate a process model for <b>deburring</b> with compliant <b>tools.</b> Furthermore, the control strategies for automatic deburring need to be developed in order to carry out advanced automatic deburring operation. In this research, process models have been obtained from brush/workpart dynamic systems and brush material removal characteristics. A process model for the dynamic system is established by employing a viscoelastic representation and Dynamic Data System (DDS) analysis. Parameters of the systems are identified by experimentally obtained dynamic response. The viscoelastic and first order DDS dynamic process models yield close agreement for poles of the system. Material removal characteristics are described by first order differential equations. Parameters of the system are evaluated by experimentally obtained 2 ̆ 2 Master Curves 2 ̆ 2 of dynamic force response. In addition, a multiple regression method and an Neural Network model are applied in modelling the burr height reduction. Control strategies have been developed for cases of burr with known constant height, known varying height, and unknown height. The closed-form solutions of transverse feed rate along the X axis have been obtained for both known constant height burr and known varying height burr. The feed rate is increased proportionally with increase of initial penetration depth. An equal-distance sampling technique was employed {{in the development of the}} closed-loop control system for burr with unknown height. The use of the concept of dividing the brush into many differential brushes has shown the success in the analysis for burr with unknown height. Computer simulations show the validity of control law developed as a result of burr totally removed, and indicate that K a = 1. 25 seems to be desired proportional gain value. Over control strategies developed show promise in the future implementation because of the simplicity of the strategies...|$|R
