Annual blue grass (Poa annua L.) is controlled by haloxyfop-methyl but not by <b>fluazifop-butyl.</b> Research was conducted {{to determine the effect}} of each herbicide on growth, morphology, lipid synthesis and acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity, of this species, and to determine physiological mechanism of annual blue grass tolerance to <b>fluazifop-butyl.</b> Techniques used in this research were growth measurements, light and electron microscopy, TLC, and enzyme assay for acetyl-CoA carboxylase. Haloxyfop-methyl at 15 μM when applied preemergence caused 96 % reduction of root growth of annual blue grass whereas <b>fluazifop-butyl</b> at 15 μM caused 42 % reduction of root growth. Haloxyfop-methyl at 5 μM and 15 μM caused 35 and 96 % inhibition of leaf growth, respectively. <b>Fluazifop-butyl</b> at same rates caused 19 and 32 % inhibition of leaf growth. Haloxyfop-methyl at 5 and 20 μM when applied postemergence caused 20 and 56 % reduction of leaf growth, respectively. <b>Fluazifop-butyl</b> at same rates caused 11 and 21 % reduction of leaf growth. Haloxyfop-methyl at 20 μM caused 80 % reduction of annual blue grass seedlings dry weight whereas <b>fluazifop-butyl</b> caused 40 % reduction. Morphological studies showed that postemergence applications of 20 μM of haloxyfop-methyl caused severe tissue injury whereas same rates of <b>fluazifop-butyl</b> caused less injury. Ultrastructural studies showed that haloxyfop-methyl at 20 μM caused disruption, elongation, and reduction of chloroplast thylakoids whereas <b>fluazifop-butyl</b> caused less injury to thylakoids. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity from annual blue grass was inhibited by about 40 % in the presence of 10 μM haloxyfop acid but fluazifop acid caused 6. 5 % inhibition. The lipid content was reduced by 56 % in seedling treated with 20 μM haloxyfop-methyl whereas <b>fluazifop-butyl</b> caused 19 % inhibition. <b>Fluazifop-butyl</b> at all rates caused no loss of lipid classes whereas haloxyfop-methyl at 10 and 15 μM caused loss of phospholipid and glycolipid which are part of the cellular membranes. Haloxyfop caused greater reduction of leaf and root growth, greater degree of tissue injury and chloroplast distortion, greater inhibition of acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity than fluazifop. All these effects lead to degradation of cellular components and eventually to the death of the plant...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} was carried out on cultivated oat (Avena sativa L. cv Amuri) to examine the efficacies of <b>fluazifop-butyl</b> and glyphosate against water stressed plants, plants grown in low and high nitrogen and plants treated with gibberellic acid (GA₃). Avena sativa L. {{was used as a}} test plant and on completion of the experiments, further studies were carried out on the weed species wild oat (Avena fatua L.). In the laboratory, plants maintained at wilting point for five days before and nine days after spraying and treated with <b>fluazifop-butyl</b> (0. 5 kg a. i. /ha) appeared healthy 32 days after herbicide application, while plants supplied with water throughout the experiment were completely chlorotic/necrotic and had main stem detachment from within the leaf sheaths. In the field, plants maintained unirrigated until 14 days after spraying with <b>fluazifop-butyl</b> (0. 25 kg a. i. /ha) or glyphosate (0. 18 kg a. i. /ha) showed greater tolerance to the herbicides than plants irrigated regularly. Values for seed head yield for water stressed and irrigated plants, 45 days after applying <b>fluazifop-butyl,</b> were 66 g and zero g dryweight/m² respectively. Comparable values for glyphosate treated plants were 65 g and 25 g dryweight/m². Radiolabel studies indicated that in comparision with well watered plants, water stressed plants absorbed 20 % less applied ¹⁴C-glyphosate. In addition, the proportion of absorbed ¹⁴C-glyphosate translocated from the treated leaf was 15 % less under water stress conditions. Uptake of ¹⁴C-fluazifop-butyl was similar under well watered and water stress conditions and was 30 - 40 % of that applied. The proportion of absorbed ¹⁴C-activity which was transported was very low, but was greater under well watered conditions (7. 6 %) than under water stress conditions (4. 4 %). Under well watered conditions in the laboratory and field, <b>fluazifop-butyl</b> (0. 25 kg a. i. /ha) and glyphosate (0. 18 kg a. i. /ha) were less toxic at low nitrogen than high nitrogen. For example, 34 days after spraying with <b>fluazifop-butyl</b> under laboratory conditions total plant dry weight was 1. 51 g and 0. 56 g at 1. 0 mol/m³ and 10 mol/m³ applied nitrate respectively. As with soil water content, soil nitrogen content had no effect on uptake of <b>fluazifop-butyl.</b> However, the proportion of absorbed <b>fluazifop-butyl</b> which was translocated out of the treated lamina was greater under high nitrogen conditions (26. 1 %) than under low nitrogen conditions (9. 3 %). Under laboratory conditions, addition of 200 µg GA₃to the leaf sheaths two days prior to spraying with <b>fluazifop-butyl</b> or glyphosate increased the efficacy of both herbicides at low nitrogen. Similarly, under field conditions application of GA₃ (0. 21 kg/ha) two days prior to spraying with glyphosate increased the performance of the herbicide against Avena sativa L. growing in a nitrogen depleted soil. At harvest, seed head yield for GA₃ treated and non-treated plants was zero and 7. 4 g dry weight/m² respectively. Experiments with Avena latua L. showed that this species was tolerant of <b>fluazifop-butyl</b> and glyphosate when grown in low water or low nitrogen conditions. Under water stress conditions, pre-treatment with GA₃ increased the phytotoxicity of <b>fluazifop-butyl</b> to Avena latua L. Similarily, GA₃ enhanced the phytotoxicity of glyphosate to Avena latua L. grown under low nitrogen conditions. Reduced performance of <b>fluazifop-butyl</b> under stress conditions involves a reduction in translocation of herbicide to meristems, but other factors are likely to be involved. It was concluded that for glyphosate, reductions in uptake and translocation of the herbicide are important factors causing reduced performance of this herbicide under stress conditions. Possible reasons for GA₃ enhancement of <b>fluazifop-butyl</b> and glyphosate activity under stress conditions are discussed and the potential of growth regulators as adjuvants is considered...|$|E
40|$|Sugarcane stalks {{that were}} drought {{stressed}} and not stressed were sampled 50 days after applying Fusilade Super (<b>fluazifop-butyl).</b> The stalks were sectioned and analysed for structural (fibre) and soluble (brix) carbohydrates. Levels of sucrose, glucose and fructose {{were determined by}} HPLC. The data show that total stalk dry matter was not reduced by <b>fluazifop-butyl,</b> {{regardless of whether the}} cane was stressed or not. Increases of sucrose in sections of unstressed cane, which were also evident in the top section of stressed cane, were substantial. Lower levels offibre, glucose and fructose were associated with increases in sucrose. The ripener restricted the emergence of new leaves of stressed and unstressed cane without reducing total green leaf area.

40|$|The {{growth and}} seed {{production}} potential of white clover (Trifolium repens L.) was studied in field plots in 2 years, {{with and without}} a companion grass (Lolium perenne L.). Three rates of grass suppressant, <b>fluazifop-butyl</b> (Fusilade), applied in early June, were compared on plots sown with the companion grass. Two clover varieties, Aberystwyth SI 84 and Olwen, were compared. Sowing a companion grass reduced the amount of clover in the sward in both {{the first and second}} harvest years, but did not affect the vigour of individual clover growing points or the number of clover inflorescences when the crop was ready to be harvested for seed. <b>Fluazifop-butyl,</b> at the highest rate used (125 g/ha), reduced the rates of leaf emergence and extension, and the numbers of reproductive tillers, in Lolium, without reducing the rate of leaf emergence in clover, although the weight per clover leaf was somewhat reduced. In the first harvest year, the numbers of SI 84 inflorescences in June and July were increased by <b>fluazifop-butyl,</b> but the effect had worn off by harvest (24 August). Seed yield potential was not increased by <b>fluazifop-butyl</b> at the rates used. Olwen produced heavier leaves, but fewer leaves and fewer growing points/ 0 ? 1 m 2 than SI 84. In the first harvest year, Olwen had fewer and smaller inflorescences than S 184. It proved feasible to measure the weight of new leaf produced per week and the nett additions to stolon and inflorescence dry matter (DM). The estimate of nett addition to stolon DM was increased by increasing the number of visible internodes included in the calculation, up to the maximum number recorded (nine). The rate of leaf emergence was slower on young branches than on main axes. Peer reviewe...|$|E

Addition of crop oil concentrate to the spray solution increased phytotoxicity. When plants {{were treated with}} single droplets, smaller concentrated droplets were more phytotoxic than larger more dilute droplets. Application site of single herbicide droplets also influenced phytotoxicity. ^ <b>Fluazifop-butyl,</b> haloxyfop-methyl and sethoxydim exhibited soil herbicidal activity in greenhouse and field experiments. When grass seeds were planted at the soil surface control was greater with all three herbicides than when planted 2, 4, or 6 cm deep. Imbibition of the herbicides by grass and soybean Glycine max (L.) Merr. seed did not reduce germination at concentrations of 10 (2 ̆ 7 - 3) M or below. All three herbicides were more readily absorbed from the soil by seedling roots than shoots. Haloxyfop-methyl exhibited the longest soil residual in the field followed by <b>fluazifop-butyl</b> and sethoxydim. Haloxyfop-methyl and <b>fluazifop-butyl</b> controlled shattercane Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench in soybeans with preemergence and early postemergence applications; whereas, control from similar applications of sethoxydim was limited and variable. ^ Behavior of (2 ̆ 714) C-haloxyfop-methyl was examined in soybean, shattercane, and yellow foxtail Setaria lutescens (Weigel) Hubb. intact plants and soybean and yellow foxtail cell cultures. Foliar absorption of (2 ̆ 714) C-haloxyfop-methyl was rapid and almost complete within 48 h. Significant translocation occurred within 48 h of treatment with soybean and shattercane plants translocating more (2 ̆ 714) C than yellow foxtail. Metabolism of (2 ̆ 714) C-haloxyfop-methyl in intact plants was similar among the three species. Soybean cells contained greater levels of (2 ̆ 714) C than did yellow foxtail cells.

Postemergent treatments were applied to 6 -day-old seedlings. Carotenoid levels were reduced by 90 to 94 % in preemergent-treated seedlings at 5 x 10 ⁻⁵ M for each herbicide. Postemergent application of 10 ⁻³ M haloxyfop-methyl and sethoxydim caused a reduction of 11 and 15 % in carotenoid concentration than the control, respectively. Also, they produced {{a significant reduction in}} chlorophyll a and total chlorophyll concentration. Preemergent treatment with 5 x 10 ⁻⁶ M of each herbicide caused a reduction of 78 to 91 % in leaf fresh weight and 72 to 84 % reduction in root dry weight as compared to the control. Height of the seedlings was reduced by 79 to 86 % of the control. Postemergent treatments with 10 ⁻³ M of each herbicide reduced the length of the second leaf by 98 %, whereas length of the first leaf was reduced by 36 % following haloxyfop-methyl treatment and 45 % following <b>fluazifop-butyl</b> or sethoxydim treatments. Fresh weight of leaf tissue treated with 10 ⁻³ M of each herbicide was reduced by 40 %.

Labelling of all acyl lipids, but not pigments, was reduced. The effects of the active acid form, fluazifop, were also determined in leaf pieces and chloroplasts. Concentrations of (R,S) -fluazifop up to 100 microM had no affect upon quality or quantity of fatty acids produced from [1 - 14 C]acetate in pea. In barley, however, 100 microM-(R,S) -fluazifop caused 89 % (leaf) or 100 % (chloroplasts) inhibition in labelling of fatty acids from [1 - 14 C]acetate. Lower concentrations of fluazifop (less than 25 microM) caused incomplete inhibition and significant {{decreases in}} the proportion of C 18 fatty acids synthesized, particularly by isolated chloroplasts.

40|$|A multiresidue {{analytical}} method for {{the determination of}} a wide range of pesticides, major conversion products and other organic micropollutants (phenols, anilines and caffeine) in water based on the on-line coupling of solid phase extraction and high performance liquid chromatography (on-line SPE/HPLC) has been developed. Analyte detection has been performed by a diode-array detector operated in tandem mode with either an electrochemical detector or a fluorescence detector placed after a two-stage post-column derivatization system. Using 100 mL sample volume the recoveries of most solutes, except for the highly polar and highly hydrophobic compounds, were better than 80 _%; the recoveries of the highly polar compounds (aniline, clopyralid, picloram, hydroxysimazine, hydroxyatrazine and phenol) were lower than 80 % due to their early breakthrough from the solid-phase extraction cartridges, while for the highly hydrophobic compounds the reduced recoveries were attributed to their adsorption onto the surfaces of the analytical equipment. Analyte detection limits, calculated by analyzing spiked river water samples, were better than 0. 1 _μg/L, which is the maximum acceptable concentration of pesticide parent compounds and phenols in drinking water according to the EU Directive 778 / 80. The proposed {{analytical method}} was applied to study the stability {{of a wide range}} of herbicides during sample storage for a period of three months as a function of storage temperature (refrigeration and 20 _ 0 C), sample pH (3 and 7) and acidification medium (sulfuric and ortho-phosphoric acid). Many of the compounds were found to be unstable in water, while sample storage conditions had significant effect on their stability. Among the compounds exhibiting high degree of instability were propanil, when stored under neutral conditions, diclofop-methyl, <b>fluazifop-butyl,</b> dinitroanilines, tralkoxydim and triasulfuron, when stored under acidic conditions, clopyralid, metamitron, metribuzin along with its conversion products and 2, 4 -DB, when water samples were stored at 20 _ 0 C. The stability of the above studied herbicides has been also evaluated under sorbed conditions, when water samples were processed by solid-phase extraction and the respective cartridges were stored for a period of three months under deep freeze, refrigeration or at 20 _ 0 C. Most compounds, expect for the highly polar analytes, exhibited higher stability under sorbed conditions than when being in solution of an aqueous medium. The stability of the highly polar analytes such as clopyralid, picloram, hydroxysimazine, imazapyr, metolachlor-sulfonic_acid, diketometribuzin, desaminodiketometribuzin, desaminometribuzin and metribuzin decreased significantly during storage under sorbed conditions, even though clopyralid was still more stable than when being in solution.
