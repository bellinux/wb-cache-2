40|$|Since the {{financial}} crisis of 2008, the term "crisis" has proliferated as a folk concept, and yet remained largely unexamined as an analytic concept. In this essay, I draw on my experience as a research assistant and research analyst at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, during what would {{come to be called}} the Latin American debt crisis, to contribute to rethinking of financial crisis. Putting aside the assumption that we know a priori the meaning of crisis, I bring into view the material devices, temporalities and, in the words of Bronislaw Malinowski, the "imponderabilia of daily life" entailed by perceiving and regulating crisis. Rather than high-level officials of the Federal Reserve Bank, the essay focuses on research assistants, <b>junior</b> <b>economists,</b> midlevel officials, and also mainframe computers with their glitches and bugs. The essay shows how local, historically specific processes of generating knowledge in a 1980 s office of the Federal Reserve Bank were part of grand projects of social reinvention, in which even the lowliest research assistant helped shape a narrative of crisis...|$|R

This paper reports new evidence from a natural field experiment using a subject pool one might expect to be particularly resistant to such effects: experimental economists.

40|$|Women {{have been}} {{traditionally}} underrepresented {{within the ranks}} of academic economists. As such, the graduate education and early career success of female economists is an important concern {{for members of the}} profession. Within the sciences, a commonly proposed method for fostering the growth of female scholars is the pairing of female Ph. D. students to female dissertation advisors. As proof of the scientific community’s commitment to the concept of same-gender mentoring, CSWEP has twice received funding from the National Science Foundation to “implement and evaluate a series of mentoring workshops for <b>junior</b> <b>economists,</b> focusing especially on issues relevant to women economists {{at the beginning of their}} careers (Francine D. Blau, p. 531, 2004). ” While funding such programs may be intuitively appealing, assessing their impact is fundamentally an empirical concern. Surprisingly we are only aware of one study by David Neumark and Rosella Gardecki (1998) that attempts to quantify the potential impact of same-gender mentoring on the early-career outcomes of Ph. D. students. We add to this sparse literature by analyzing a sample of 1, 900 individuals receiving economics Ph. D. s from top 30 programs between 1990 and 1994. Our source for the student’s advisor, Ph. D. year, and Ph. D. program is the Dissertation Abstracts database. We collec...|$|R

This paper conducts a first of its kind examination on Israel’s academic economists and economics departments, ranking them according to the number of citations on their work. It also provides a vista into one of the primary reasons given by <b>junior</b> Israeli <b>economists</b> for an unparalleled brain drain from the country - discrepancies between research impact and promotion.

40|$|Why {{do people}} give away {{knowledge}} in tutoring other people's children or when mentoring <b>junior</b> employees? Neoclassical <b>economists</b> explain informal learning as rational behavior that arises out of enlightened self-interest. They can also justify it as acts that satisfy the agent's preferences for {{the utility of}} others. By contrast, this paper shows that Smith's moral sentiments model anticipates a biological approach that explains additional and deeper motives for such exchanges. Instincts and emotions serve consequentialist ends because the ultimate causes of behavior are grounded in adaptations useful for survival and procreation. But man is largely innocent of this knowledge. The proximate causes of behavior—that is, the adaptive mechanisms actually at work in human society—are psychologically obscure—not left to the conscious mind. Social and moral capital develop through instincts and affection, and mentoring and collaboration are examples of social exchanges that arise from them. Adam Smith, instinct, informal learning, multilevel selection,...|$|R
