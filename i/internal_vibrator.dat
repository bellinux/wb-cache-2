40|$|In diploma work we {{were trying}} to {{establish}} the behaviour of self-compacting concrete during mixing, casting and during setting of the concrete in moulds. Self-compacting concrete mixtures must be handled extra carefully during mixing and casting otherwise instabilities might easily occur, which is reflected in segregation. Therefore, in formwork of experimental work we put four pairs of electrodes at four different levels of specially prepared moulds to monitor the behaviour of samples. Stability of two different mixtures with the same water-to-cement ratio was being monitored with electrical conductivity method. First mixture was composed from cement CEM II/A-M (LL-S) 42, 5 R, limestone filler and crushed limestone assembled from four different fractions, while the second mixture was composed of cement CEM II/A-S 42, 5 R, limestone filler and natural river gravel assembled from three fractions. For each concrete mixture six specimens were prepared. Three of them were cast in the moulds homogenously and three where consolidated with a help of <b>internal</b> <b>vibrator</b> in order to assure segregation and different electro conductivity at different levels of the mould. At the end we cut the concrete samples to check them visually and make the comparison to the results, gained by electrical conductivity method. Additionally to this test, we carried out also slump-flow test on fresh concrete mixtures, we determined initial and final setting times during concrete mixtures setting, as well as we tested compressive strength of hardened concrete mixtures...|$|E
50|$|The {{company was}} founded in 1848 by Johann Christian Wacker as a blacksmith’s shop in Dresden (Germany) trading as Wacker. It started {{industrial}} production in 1875. In 1930, the company’s engineers developed a high-frequency technology for <b>internal</b> <b>vibrators.</b> At the same time, the first electrically powered rammer - an innovation in concrete and soil compaction - was developed and produced.Before the start of World War II, the company had already expanded its product portfolio and created a domestic and international sales and retail organization. Progress was halted by {{the destruction of the}} production facility in Dresden just {{before the end of the}} war.|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} the <b>internal</b> <b>vibrators</b> were adopted for the {{compaction}} tests of lightweight aggregate concrete. On one hand, the compaction behavior of lightweight aggregate concrete filled in cylnder mold was investigated; {{on the other}} hand, the experiments of one point and two-point compaction implemented on a large surface lightweight aggregate concrete specimens were performed to find the influences of vibration energy and compaction position to the compaction effect. Based on the experimental results, {{it was found that}} the segregation will occur for lightweight aggregate concrete due to floating of coarse aggegate caused by over vibration, and the duration of vibration lead to segregation will be shorter as the mold is smaller. Besides, the optimum vibration duration, which can be detected by observing the specimen surface, did not appear to be constant, and the effective radius of compaction will depend on the amplitude and the diameter of vibrator. The effective radius of compaction could be also estimated from the range of smooth surface, and this method has been proven to be valid by the isostrength diagram obtained from the test results of compacted specimens. 本文以振動棒對輕質骨材混凝土進行振動夯實試驗，一方面觀察混凝土在圓柱型 試體模內的夯實過程與行為；另一方面在大面積混凝土試體上進行單點及兩點的振動夯實， 測析振動能量與振動點對夯實效果的影響。試驗結果顯示，過度的振動作用確實會引起輕質 混凝土中粗骨材上浮的析離現象，試體模愈小者發生析離的振動時間將愈短。輕質骨材混凝 土的最佳振動夯實時間無定值，可由夯實體的表面觀察研判之。至於振動棒的有效作用半徑 則依其振幅與棒身直徑而定，也可由夯實面的平滑範圍估計之，本法已由夯實試體的強度等 勢線分佈圖印證其合理性...|$|R
50|$|Concrete {{vibrators}} consolidate freshly {{poured concrete}} so that trapped air and excess water are released and the concrete settles {{firmly in place}} in the formwork. Improper consolidation of concrete can cause product defects, compromise the concrete strength, and produce surface blemishes such as bug holes and honeycombing. An <b>internal</b> concrete <b>vibrator</b> is a steel cylinder {{about the size of the}} handle of a baseball bat, with a hose or electrical cord attached to one end. The vibrator head is immersed in the wet concrete.|$|R

50|$|As other anal toys, anal {{vibrators}} {{differ from}} {{other types of}} vibrators by having a flared base to prevent its possible loss in the rectum. The average size of anal vibrator is smaller than vibrators intended for vaginal penetration and may vary from 4-6 inches long and about 1 inch wide. As well as other vibrators designed for external and <b>internal</b> stimulation, anal <b>vibrators</b> are usually battery operated: the batteries may be inside the unit or connected by wire to a power pack.|$|R

It {{is the responsibility of}} the user of this method to consult and use departmental safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations before any testing is performed. A. SCOPE This test method describes the procedure used for determining the flexural strength or modulus of rupture of Rapid Strength Concrete (RSC) by the use of a simple beam with third point loading. Rapid Strength Concrete is used on projects where short construction windows (6 to 55 hours) require rapid curing (typically 3 to 24 hours). This test method is typically used to fabricate and test samples at the jobsite to meet trafficopening criterion. B. APPARATUS 1.
