In 1862, during the Civil War Pierrepont was appointed by President Lincoln {{a member of the}} military commission to try the cases of state prisoners in the custody of the federal military authorities. During the Presidential election of 1864, Pierrepont supported Lincoln in a political speech at Cooper Union, believing President Lincoln would secure the restoration of the Union. Pierrepont stated Lincoln stood for <b>freedom,</b> <b>liberty</b> and national glory.|$|E
25|$|On January 6, 1773, black petitioners {{submitted}} {{the first of}} five appeals written during the year, asking {{for a range of}} rights, to Governor Hutchinson and the General Court of Massachusetts. Though signed only by a slave named Felix, the document petitioned for the freedom and rights of all slaves in the Massachusetts colony. While the tone of the petition is cautious, it speaks to the “unhappy State and Condition” in which enslaved persons are forced to live. Abolitionists later published the petition as a pamphlet, along with letters and other abolitionist documents. Felix’s petition expressed the talk of <b>freedom,</b> <b>liberty,</b> {{and the pursuit of happiness}} that was circulating around Massachusetts and other American colonies before the American Revolution. No record of a response from the Massachusetts General Court exists. Although slavery was never explicitly abolished or prohibited in the new Massachusetts Constitution after the Revolutionary War, rulings in freedom suits by Mum Bett and Quock Walker established that its representation of rights was incompatible with slavery, and remaining slaves effectively gained their freedom.|$|E
40|$|This paper aims at analizing the {{interdisciplinary}} association between administration and education {{under the assumption}} that <b>freedom</b> and <b>liberty</b> are essential to political, social and human development. This association can only exist if managers and educators accept <b>freedom</b> and <b>liberty</b> in their daily practices. Such a conclusion has been arrived at by reviewing the literature produced by authors who have emphasized <b>freedom</b> and <b>liberty</b> as inerent values to human beings. A model based on <b>freedom</b> and <b>liberty</b> was built both for administrators and educators. Data were collected from interviews with students in courses taught by the authors and by department heads in the municipal education agency in Rio de Janeiro. The main conclusion is that the association between administration and education goes beyond simple common missions and objectives. Due to the fact that <b>freedom</b> and <b>liberty</b> are essential to development in both fields, administration and education are really integrated and unassociated...|$|R

500|$|Still, Blassingame {{concludes that}} {{cross-cultural}} exchanges occurred on southern plantations, arguing that [...] "acculturation in the United States involved the mutual interaction between two cultures, with Europeans and Africans borrowing from each other." [...] Blassingame {{asserts that the}} most significant instance revolved around Protestant Christianity (primarily Baptist and Methodist churches): [...] "The number of blacks who received religious instruction in antebellum white churches is significant because the church was the only institution other than the plantation which {{played a major role}} in acculturating the slave." [...] Christianity and enslaved black ministers slowly replaced African religious survivals and represented another aspect of slave culture which the slaves used to create their own communities. While ministers preached obedience in the presence of the slaveowners and other whites, slaves often met in secret, [...] "invisible" [...] services unsupervised by whites. In these [...] "invisible churches", slaves could discuss <b>freedom,</b> <b>liberty,</b> and the judgment of God against slaveowners.|$|E

[...] When he performed at the London Gay Pride parade, he sang on the roof of a hired pleasure boat that floated down the Thames past Jubilee Gardens. At a performance Divine gave at the Hippodrome {{in the last year of}} his life, he appeared onstage riding an infant elephant which had been hired for the occasion. Divine was nevertheless not happy with being known primarily for his drag act, and told an interviewer that [...] "my favorite part of drag is getting out of it. Drag is my work clothes. I only put it on when someone pays me to", a view he echoed to his friends.|$|E

6000|$|We talk of our hardy forefathers; and rightly. But {{they were}} hardy, {{just as the}} savage is usually hardy, because none but the hardy lived. They may {{have been able to}} say of themselves--as they do in a state paper of 1515, now well known through the pages of Mr. Froude--"What comyn folk of all the world may compare with the comyns of England, in riches, <b>freedom,</b> <b>liberty,</b> welfare, and all prosperity? What comyn folk is so mighty, and so strong in the felde, as the comyns of England?" [...] They may have been fed on [...] "great shins of beef," [...] till they became, as Benvenuto Cellini calls them, [...] "the English wild beasts." [...] But they {{increased}} in numbers slowly, if at all, for centuries. Those terrible laws of natural selection, which issue in [...] "the survival of the fittest," [...] cleared off the less fit, in every generation, principally by infantile disease, often by wholesale famine and pestilence; and left, on the whole, only those of the strongest constitutions to perpetuate a hardy, valiant, and enterprising race.|$|E
6000|$|And of what temper {{those men}} were {{it is well}} known enough. Mr. Froude calls them--and we beg leave to endorse, without exception, Mr. Froude's opinion--'A sturdy high-hearted race, sound in body and fierce in spirit, and {{furnished}} with thews and sinews which, under the stimulus of those [...] "great shins of beef," [...] their common diet, were the wonder of the age.' 'What comyn folke in all this world,' says a State Paper in 1515, 'may compare with the comyns of England in riches, <b>freedom,</b> <b>liberty,</b> welfare, and all prosperity? What comyn folk is so mighty, so strong in the felde, as the comyns of England?' In authentic stories of actions under Henry VIII.--and, we will add, under Elizabeth likewise--where the accuracy of the account is undeniable, no disparity of force made Englishmen shrink from enemies whenever they could meet them. Again and again a few thousands of them carried dismay into the heart of France. Four hundred adventurers, vagabond apprentices of London, who formed a volunteer corps in the Calais garrison, were for years, Hall says, the terror of Normandy. In the very frolic of conscious power they fought and plundered without pay, without reward, save what they could win for themselves; and when they fell at last, they fell only when surrounded by six times their number, and were cut to pieces in careless desperation. Invariably, by friend and foe alike, the English are described as the fiercest people in all Europe--English wild beasts Benvenuto Cellini calls them; and this great physical power they owed to the profuse abundance in which they lived, to the soldier's training in which every one of them was bred from childhood.|$|E

40|$|The current {{literature}} {{has failed to}} differentiate between the collapse of democratic and authoritarian rules or whether democratic regimes collapse {{for the same reasons}} as do authoritarian regimes. Therefore, the {{current literature}} is silent on whether democracies are more fragile or less susceptible to economic and political breakdowns. Using a multitude of political instability variables, this paper explores empirically, whether political <b>freedom</b> and civil <b>liberty</b> (a proxy for democracy) has any effect on the stability of the political order. The empirical results of the paper confirm the hypothesis that democracy is conducive to political stability; the higher the level of political <b>freedom</b> and civil <b>liberty,</b> the more stable countries are. The paper also presented a Granger-causality test of political instability and the level of political <b>freedom</b> and civil <b>liberty.</b> The test results indicate that the level of political <b>freedom</b> and civil <b>liberty</b> Granger-cause the level of political instability, while the level of political instability does not Granger-cause the level of political <b>freedom</b> and civil <b>liberty.</b> The test results indicate that Granger-causality runs one-way from political <b>freedom</b> and civil <b>liberty</b> to political instability and not the other way. A further comprehensive research is needed on the multi-layered and the complex relationship among democracy and the resilience of the political order.
