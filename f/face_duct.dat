40|$|EP 413987 A UPAB: 19930928 The {{axial-flow fan}} with bladed {{impeller}} {{is housed in}} a duct in an enclosing wall (1). One or more apertures (20) are formed in the latter at the blade tip (15) region, each with a cover (21) with ports (22) at the side <b>facing</b> the <b>duct.</b> The covers pref. have fine ports. They are typically of textile fabric, or gauze. There {{can also be a}} coarse cover with a large number of holes. ADVANTAGE - No turbulent discharge flow, and stable characteristic over the entire output range. 1 /...|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} between convection and axial heat conduction along a pipe is analysed assuming third kind boundary {{conditions at the}} outer <b>face</b> of the <b>duct.</b> Wall thickness {{is assumed to be}} either uniform or having periodic step variations in the axial direction. Axial heat conduction is found to have a definite influence on the heat flux and the Nusselt number distributions. However, the overall heat flux can accurately be predicted by ordinary methods disregarding axial conduction in the wall...|$|R
5000|$|Galvanized {{mild steel}} is the {{standard}} and most common material used in fabricating ductwork because the zinc coating of this metal prevents rusting and avoids cost of painting. For insulation purposes, metal ducts are typically lined with <b>faced</b> fiberglass blankets (<b>duct</b> liner) or wrapped externally with fiberglass blankets (duct wrap). When called for, a double walled duct is used. This will usually have an inner perforated liner, then a 1-2" [...] layer of fiberglass insulation contained inside an outer solid pipe.|$|R
40|$|Present study {{investigates the}} effects of solid to fluid {{conductivity}} ratio, Prandtl and Reynolds numbers, and solid wall thickness on conjugate heat transfer for a backward <b>facing</b> step <b>duct</b> with a conductive solid bottom wall. Although Kanna and Das performed {{a case study in}} 2006 for the same problem, the benchmark studies conducted later including the present one revealed that their results are arguable. Ramsak states in a study “Professor Kanna has confirmed in personal communication that their results are probably wrong”. The temperature and Nusselt number variations along the solid-fluid interface presented here are in excellent agreement with those obtained by Ramsak. The analyses presented here reveal that even though the decrease in Pr and the increase in solid to fluid conductivity ratio have similar global influence with the thinning wall on the interface temperature, the influence of the former parameters are limited in recirculation zone...|$|R
40|$|Studies on the {{functional}} and morphological relations between exocrine and endocrine pancreas {{have been conducted}} mainly to disclose the influence of islets of Langerhans on acinar parenchyma. Less {{attention has been paid}} to the relations occurring between islets and pancreatic ducts. Methods. A series of consecutive sections of normal adult rat pancreas were double stained with islet (hormones) and duct (cytokeratin 20) markers. Electron microscopy was conducted to investigate the ultrastructural features of duct-islet relations and anti-insulin immunogold labelling was carried out to reveal the presence of insulin in the pancreatic duct system. Results. Consecutive double-stained sections demonstrated that 73. 60 ± 2. 97 % of the islets were attached to the ducts. For each series, 93. 48 ± 5. 43 % of the islets contacting the duct tree were associated with small-sized ducts or centroacinar cells. Electron microscopy revealed that some insulin and somatostatin cells do <b>face</b> the <b>duct</b> lumen. Insulin was detected within the duct lumen and in the endosomal compartment of the duct cells. Conclusions/interpretation. The finding that most islets are connected with the duct system in the adult pancreas is discussed in terms of hormone secretion into the ducts, islet histogenesis and the relation among the three tissue components of the pancreas, the endocrine, the exocrine and the duct system...|$|R
40|$|Evaluation is {{essential}} to planning and implementing effective develop- ment programs. The resource limitations, multidimensionality of develop- ment program impacts, cultural barriers between evaluators and those impacted, and the diversity of settings in which evaluations must be con- ducted arc serious constraints {{on the use of}} traditional research methods to evaluate development programs. Similar constraints are <b>faced</b> in con- <b>ducting</b> most social impact assessments. We suggest that a method of impact identification that makes use of experts, including the people ef- fected by a project, can be used in development project evaluation. The method, which is based on the noniinal group technique, is described, as are some of its applications in Latin America and the Caribbean. We conclude iiy considering directions for future development and the relationship be- tween planning, evaluation, and impact assessment. Copyright 1988 by The Policy Studies Organization. ...|$|R
2500|$|Several {{problems}} were encountered during the conversion. The newly lengthened landing gear required more hydraulic fluid, which required a larger reservoir to hold it, a pump {{to move it}} quickly enough through the system, and so on through the hydraulic system. Retaining the relatively simple intakes but only {{on the bottom of}} the wing presented the issue that the airflow into the engine was from below, as opposed to the entire compressor <b>face,</b> so the <b>ducts</b> were extended above the wing to split the airflow evenly; this produced a noticeable bulge on the upper surface of the wing. No attempt was made to fit variable intakes. At high throttle settings, considerable suction into the inlets was generated; in the event of a sudden down-throttle motion by the pilot would result in air [...] "spilling" [...] out of the intakes, which was a concern because it could flow above the wing and disrupt the vortex. Small lips were added to the intakes to help prevent this, but this proved to cause intake buzzing. Changes to the ducts, assisted by Rolls-Royce, addressed this issue.|$|R
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{relates to}} a small-scale air duct of rectangular cross-section with variably sized rectangular apertures pitched evenly along one <b>face</b> of the <b>duct.</b> Measurements of air velocities were made mainly with a hot-wire anemometer {{and to a}} lesser extent with a pitot-static tube. Details are given of the calibration and use of these instruments together with an outline of the precautions which must be taken to ensure reliability of results. Aperture air flow patterns determined by the use of the hot-wire anemometer were found to be complex and dependent primarily on the interrelated factors of duct gauge static pressure, aperture size, and that fraction of the approaching air which escaped through an aperture. It was established that aperture air volume flow could be determined accurately from a single, half-height, horizontal traverse of an aperture with the hot-wire probe and consequently the expenditure of time and effort required for a multi-row traverse was eliminated. Some evidence was found to support the supposition that variation in the magnitude of the total duct air flow does not affect the proportions into which it is divided by fixed aperture settings. Relationships between non-dimensional parameters were determined from which a method was devised by which the requisite aperture areas associated with specified aperture proportional air flows were predicted...|$|R
40|$|At {{coal mine}} working faces, {{simultaneous}} application of three basic elements reduces the methane explosion hazard: (1) adequate ventilation, (2) regular monitoring of gas concentrations, and (3) {{the elimination of}} ignition sources. This paper reviews the application of these elements in a manner relevant to Chinese coal mines. Adequate ventilation is provided by using the mine entries to convey air for the long distances between the mine portal and the working sections (main ventilation systems) and then using line brattice or ventilation <b>duct</b> (<b>face</b> ventilation systems) to convey air the last hundred meters to the working face where coal is broken and removed. The air quantity provided is enough to safely dilute methane and the air velocity is enough to prevent layering. Gas concentrations are regularly monitored in accordance with regulations using knowledge of {{the circumstances under which}} the highest concentrations are likely to be found. Ignition sources are eliminated by ensuring that electrical equipment does not ignite methane, that sparking from cutter picks is minimized, and that smoking by workers is strictly forbidden. Risk-reduction studies using fault-tree analysis have shown that large reductions in explosion risk only result from multiple preventive actions. For example, a ventilation upgrade or a methane monitor upgrade by itself offers risk reductions under 50 pct. A risk reduction of 90 pct. or more would typically require much more. Other {{studies have shown that the}} everyday vigilance of those working underground is as important as engineering design...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Tuberculosis (TB) {{is caused}} by Mycobacterium {{tuberculosis}} and is transmitted through coughing, sneezing, laughing and singing. Laboratory workers&# 146; risk of infection is 3 to 9 {{times higher than the}} general public as they handle potentially infectious samples. Laboratory safety should therefore be prioritized and optimized to provide sufficient safety to laboratory workers. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the safety of the laboratory workers in TB primary microscopy centres in Blantyre urban. Material and Methods: TB primary microscopy centers in Blantyre urban were assessed in aspects of equipment availability, facility layout, and work practice, using a standardized WHO/AFRO ISO 15189 checklist for the developing countries which sets the minimum safety score at &# 8805; 80 %. Each center was graded according to the score it earned upon assessment. Results: The safety hoods were not functional in Ndirande, Lirangwe and Chileka microscopy centres. No safety hood was found in South Lunzu. In Ndirande and Limbe the exhaust <b>ducts</b> <b>face</b> the patients&# 146; waiting area and door to the laboratory, putting them (patients and laboratory technicians) to a greater risk of infection when smear preparation begins. Bangwe, Chilomoni, Ndirande, Chileka, South Lunzu and Limbe microscopy centres had no sputum transportation boxes. Conclusion: There is a great compromised safety in the TB microscopy centers in Blantyre urban. Only one (1) microscopy center out of nine (9) reached the minimum safety requirement representing an 89 percent (%) failure of TB primary microscopy centers to provide safety to laboratory workers. Laboratory conditions and safety procedures in TB primary smear microscopy centres in Blantyre urban are poor. Government and other stake holders should therefore be committed in addressing the safety challenges of TB laboratories in the country (in primary Tb microscopy centres and other referral centres which face the same challenges) to ensure safety to the laboratory workers.

50|$|In practice, {{the duct}} is folded inside a {{conventional}} shaped cabinet, {{so that the}} open end of the duct appears as a vent on the speaker cabinet. There are {{many ways in which}} the duct can be folded and the line is often tapered in cross section to avoid parallel internal surfaces that encourage standing waves. Depending upon the drive unit and quantity - and various physical properties - of absorbent material, the amount of taper will be adjusted during the design process to tune the duct to remove irregularities in its response. The internal partitioning provides substantial bracing for the entire structure, reducing cabinet flexing and colouration. The inside <b>faces</b> of the <b>duct</b> or line, are treated with an absorbent material to provide the correct termination with frequency to load the drive unit as a TL. A theoretically perfect TL would absorb all frequencies entering the line {{from the rear of the}} drive unit but remains theoretical, as it would have to be infinitely long. The physical constraints of the real world, demand that the length of the line must often be less than 4 meters before the cabinet becomes too large for any practical applications, so not all the rear energy can be absorbed by the line. In a realized TL, only the upper bass is TL loaded in the true sense of the term (i.e. fully absorbed); the low bass is allowed to freely radiate from the vent in the cabinet. The line therefore effectively works as a low-pass filter, another crossover point in fact, achieved acoustically by the line and its absorbent filling. Below this “crossover point” the low bass is loaded by the column of air formed by the length of the line. The length is specified to reverse the phase of the rear output of the drive unit as it exits the vent. This energy combines with the output of the bass unit, extending its response and effectively creating a second driver.|$|R
5000|$|The {{transmission}} line (TL) is the theoretical ideal, {{and one of}} the most complex constructions, with which to load a moving coil drive unit. The most common and practical implementation is to fit a drive unit to the end of a long duct that is usually open at the far end. In practice, the duct is folded inside a conventional shaped cabinet, so that the open end of the duct appears as a vent on the speaker cabinet. There are many ways in which the duct can be folded and the line is often tapered in crossection to avoid parallel internal surfaces that encourage standing waves. Some speaker designs also use a spiral or elliptic spiral shaped duct, usually with one speaker element in the front or two speaker elements arranged one on each side of the cabinet. Depending upon the drive unit, and quantity and various physical properties of absorbent material, the amount of taper will be adjusted during the design process to tune the duct to remove irregularities in its response. The internal partitioning provides substantial bracing for the entire structure, reducing cabinet flexing and colouration. The inside <b>faces</b> of the <b>duct</b> or line, are treated with an absorbent material to provide the correct termination with frequency to load the drive unit as a TL. The enclosure behaves like an infinite baffle, potentially absorbing most or all of the speaker unit's rear energies. A theoretically perfect TL would absorb all frequencies entering the line from the rear of the drive unit but remains theoretical, as it would have to be infinitely long. The physical constraints of the real world, demand that the length of the line must often be less than 4 meters before the cabinet becomes too large for any practical applications, so not all the rear energy can be absorbed by the line.
