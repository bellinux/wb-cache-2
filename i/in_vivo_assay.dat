Measurement of primary cytotoxicity was the least sensitive of all the tested assays. However, when the same 51 Cr release assays were performed after in vitro restimulation, this in vitro method was found to be more sensitive than all of the five <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> <b>assays</b> tested. Assessment of CTL-mediated protection against LCMV replication in spleens was most sensitive among the <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> tests, followed by CTL-mediated resistance to intracerebral or intraperitoneal challenge infections with vaccinia-LCMV-recombinant virus.

5000|$|Another MVF protein, MurJ, {{functions}} as a peptidoglycan biosynthesis protein. [...] A 3-d structureal model shows that MurJ contains a solvent-exposed cavity within {{the plane of the}} membrane. MurJ has 14 TMSs, and specific charged residues localized in the central cavity are essential for function. This structural homology model suggests that MurJ {{functions as}} an essential transporter in PG biosynthesis. Based on an <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> <b>assay,</b> MurJ acts as a flippase for the lipid-linked cell wall precursor, polyisoprenoid-linked disaccharide-peptapeptide. There is controversy about the role of this porter and FtsW/RodA which on the basis of an in vitro assay, were thought to be flippases for the same intermediate.|$|E
50|$|The in vivo test {{normally}} uses mouse {{bone marrow}} or mouse peripheral blood. When {{a bone marrow}} erythroblast develops into a polychromatic erythrocyte, the main nucleus is extruded; any micronucleus that has been formed may remain behind in the otherwise anucleated cytoplasm. Visualisation of micronuclei is facilitated in these cells because they lack a main nucleus. An increase {{in the frequency of}} micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes in treated animals is an indication of induced chromosome damage.Micronuclei were first used to quantify chromosomal damage by H.J. Evans et al., in root tips of the Broad Bean, Vicia faba. Subsequently the <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> <b>assay</b> was developed independently by W. Schmid and by J.A. Heddle and their colleagues. The mouse peripheral blood assay was developed by J.T. MacGregor and has now been adapted for measurement by flow cytometry by A. Tometsko and colleagues. The first use of micronuclei in cultured cells was by J.A. Heddle and colleagues in human lymphocytes. The assay has been improved by M. Fenech and colleagues for use in lymphocytes and other cells in culture cells.|$|E

40|$|The {{identity}} of T-cell progenitors that seed the thymus has remained controversial, largely because many studies differ over whether these progenitors retain myeloid potential. Contradictory reports diverge {{in their use}} of various in vitro and <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> <b>assays.</b> To consolidate these discordant findings, we compared the myeloid potential of 2 putative thymus seeding populations, common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs) and multipotent progenitors (MPPs), and the earliest intrathymic progenitor (DN 1), using 2 in vitro <b>assays</b> and <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> readouts. These <b>assays</b> gave contradictory results: CLP and DN 1 displayed surprisingly robust myeloid potential on OP 9 -DL 1 in vitro stromal cocultures but displayed little myeloid potential <b>in</b> <b>vivo,</b> as well as in methylcellulose cultures. MPP, on the other hand, displayed robust myeloid potential in all settings. We conclude that stromal cocultures reveal cryptic, but nonphysiologic, myeloid potentials of lymphoid progenitors, providing an explanation for contradictory findings in the field and underscoring the importance of using <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> <b>assays</b> for the determination of physiologic lineage potentials...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIdentification of murine mammary {{stem cells}} (MaSCs) has been {{attempted}} with various in vitro and <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> <b>assays.</b> While, the <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> repopulation <b>assay</b> remains {{as the most}} definitive assay for MaSC detection, it is expensive, time-consuming, and technically challenging. The in vitro mammosphere assay was considered unreliable because of major concerns about its clonal origin. In the current study, co-culture experiments with mammary cells from fluorescent protein transgenic mice and time-lapse video microscopy revealed that > 90 % mammospheres formed from sorted basal epithelial-enriched cells were of clonal origin in terms of stem cell. These basal-cell derived mammospheres were further distinguished morphologically in a 3 -dimensional extracellular matrix culture and functionally <b>in</b> the <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> repopulation <b>assay.</b> Transplant of single mammospheres or the resultant 3 -dimensional solid structures into gland-free mammary fat pads yielded a 70 % success rate of multilineage mammary gland reconstitution.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of the in vivo and in vitro assays for nitrate reductase (NR) in estimating the amounts of reduced N made available to plants was tested against the daily increases in reduced N (Nesslerization) actually accumulated by the plant. With growth-chamber-grown wheat seedlings, the average ratio values (input of reduced N as estimated by the in vitro assay to actual accumulation of N by the plant) were 3. 9 for shoots, 3. 7 for the roots, and 4. 1 for the entire plant, over a 10 -day period. With the <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> <b>assay,</b> the average ratio values were 0. 7 for the shoot, 1. 8 for the root, and 0. 9 for the entire plant.

30|$|Carbonic anhydrase (CA; EC 4.2. 1.1) catalyzes the {{reversible}} hydration {{of carbon}} dioxide (CO 2) to bicarbonate and proton. There are 16 known isozymes of Î±-CA in humans, which differ widely in their kinetics, subcellular localization and tissue-specific distribution. Several disorders are associated with abnormal levels of CA, and so the inhibition of CA has pharmacological application {{in the treatment of}} many diseases. Currently, searching for novel CA inhibitors (CAI) has been performed using in vitro methods, and so their toxicity remains unknown at the time of screening. To obtain potentially safer CAIs, a screening procedure using an <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> <b>assay</b> seems to have more advantages. Here, we developed a yeast-based <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> <b>assay</b> for the detection of inhibitors of the human CA isozyme II (hCAII). The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant deprived of its own CA (Î”nce 103 strain) can grow under a high CO 2 condition (5 % (v/v) CO 2) but not at an ambient level. We constructed Î”nce 103 strains expressing various levels of hCAII from a plasmid harboring the hCAII gene arranged under the control of variously modified GAL 1 promoter and relying on the expression of hCAII for growth under low CO 2 condition. Using a multidrug-sensitive derivative of the Î”nce 103 strain expressing a low level of hCAII, we finally established a high throughput <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> <b>assay</b> for hCAII inhibitors under a low CO 2 condition. Cytotoxicity of the candidates obtained could be simultaneously determined under a high CO 2 condition. However, their inhibitory activities against other CA isozymes remains to be established by further investigation.|$|E

40|$|International audienceAromatase is {{the only}} enzyme {{responsible}} for the irreversible conversion of androgens into estrogens. Teleost fishes have two copies of the cyp 19 a 1 gene that encode two isoforms of aromatase: cyp 19 a 1 a encodes ovarian aromatase, while the cyp 19 a 1 b gene encodes brain aromatase (aromatase B). We have shown that (i) aromatase B is strongly expressed in radial glial cells (RGC), that act as stem cells in mammals and fish and ii) the cyp 19 a 1 b gene is very sensitive to estrogens, through a mechanism that involves a well conserved ERE.
