Jeff (Peter Dyneley) immediately dispatches Scott (Shane Rimmer) and Virgil (David Holliday) in Thunderbirds 1 and 2 – the latter carrying Pod 3 – to London. Arriving at the danger zone, Scott assures Norman of IR's good intentions, in return demanding his word that no photographs will be taken of either aircraft. However, the Hood, disguised {{as one of the}} airport police detachment, breaks into the unmanned Thunderbird 1 and photographs the cockpit. Scott is alerted by the Automatic Camera Detector and the Hood flees, chased along the M1 motorway by the police.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, a {{group of}} spies have {{abducted}} Matsuda and are attempting to steal his formula to the nuclear device the disguised Pairan warned him about. Matsuda does not comply and is eventually tied to a chair in a remote building. As the Earth's atmosphere heats up due to the approaching world, Ginko again arrives to learn why Planet R is not yet destroyed. They locate Matsuda through Pairan technology and gather the formula for the device. The scientists then all watch as the nuclear device is shot <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>space</b> station and destroys Planet R, cooling the atmosphere and removing the threat. Ginko then changes back to her original form aboard the space station.|$|E

While Samus is escaping from the doomed frigate, she encounters a cybernetic version of Ridley called Meta-Ridley. During her escape, an electrical surge and explosion damages her power suit, which revert to her original Power Suit. Samus escapes the frigate and chases her nemesis in her gunship towards the nearby planet Tallon IV.|$|E

Once in the MPS lines, the fuel and oxidizer each branch out into separate paths to each engine (three on the Space Shuttle, four on the SLS). In each branch, prevalves then allow the propellants to enter the engine.|$|E

5|$|Samus {{encounters}} heavy resistance <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Space</b> Pirates, Phazon-corrupted monstrosities, and {{her fellow}} bounty hunters who have been corrupted by Dark Samus. Throughout her mission, which eventually takes her to the Space Pirate homeworld, Samus slowly becomes further Phazon-corrupted. She manages to stop the Space Pirate assault {{with the assistance of}} the Galactic Federation navy. As they gain control of a Leviathan battleship, Samus and the Federation fleet create a wormhole and warp to Phaaze—the source of all Phazon in the galaxy. Samus travels to its core, where she finally defeats Dark Samus and then the corrupted Aurora Unit 313. As a result, Dark Samus is obliterated, and Phaaze explodes, rendering all Phazon in the galaxy inert. The Federation fleet escapes Phaaze's destruction, but loses contact with Samus in the process. Eventually, Samus appears in her gunship, and reports that the mission is accomplished. Samus then takes off for Elysia, where she reflects on her deceased fellow bounty hunters. If the player completes the game with all of the items collected, Samus is seen flying into hyperspace, with Sylux's spaceship following her.|$|E

She brought the larva to Ceres Space Colony, where scientists believed that they could harness its power. Just after she left the colony, she received a distress call and returned to find the scientists dead and the larva stolen by Ridley—the leader of the Space Pirates. Samus escapes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>space</b> colony when its self-destruct sequence is activated, and follows Ridley to the planet Zebes. There, she searches for the stolen larva in a network of caves, and finds that the Space Pirates rebuilt and expanded their base on Zebes.|$|E
5|$|Each Space Shuttle {{had three}} RS-25 engines, {{installed}} in the aft structure of the Space Shuttle orbiter in the Orbiter Processing Facility prior to the orbiter being transferred to the Vehicle Assembly Building. If necessary the engines could be changed on the pad. The engines, drawing propellant <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Space</b> Shuttle external tank (ET) via the orbiter's main propulsion system (MPS), were ignited at T−6.6 seconds prior to liftoff (with each ignition staggered by 120ms), which allowed their performance to be checked prior to ignition of the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs), which committed the shuttle to the launch. At launch, the engines would be operating at 100% RPL, throttling up to 104.5% immediately following liftoff. The engines would maintain this power level until around T+40 seconds, {{where they would be}} throttled back to around 70% to reduce aerodynamic loads on the shuttle stack as it passed through the region of maximum dynamic pressure, or max Q. The engines would then be throttled back up until around T+8 minutes, at which point they would be gradually throttled back down to 67% to prevent the stack exceeding 3g of acceleration as it became progressively lighter due to propellant consumption. The engines were then shut down, a procedure known as main engine cutoff (MECO), at around T+8.5 minutes.|$|E

5000|$|Antiporters use the {{mechanism}} of cotransport (coupling the movement of one ion or molecule down its concentration gradient with the transport of another ion or molecule up its concentration gradient), to move the ions and molecule in opposite directions.
