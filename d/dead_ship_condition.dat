Here capsizing probability under <b>dead</b> <b>ship</b> <b>condition</b> is calculated with a piece-wise linear approach. Effects of statistical correlation between wind and waves are examined. This approach is extended to the cases of water on deck and cargo shift. Further, experimental and theoretical techniques for relevant coefficients are examined.

40|$|This paper summarises the {{activities}} of the Japan Society of Naval Architects and Ocean Engineers (JASNAOE) ’s strategic research committee on estimation methods of capsizing risk for the IMO new generation stability criteria (SCAPE) in 2005 - 2008. This committee consists of eighteen experts from three universities, two research institutes and one shipyard in Japan. For facilitating the development of the IMO new generation intact stability criteria, methodologies of predicting parametric rolling, broaching and stability under <b>dead</b> <b>ship</b> <b>condition</b> were investigated at the SCAPE committee. For parametric rolling, free-running model experiments for a post-Panamax containership and a car carrier in irregular head waves are reported, and difficulty of predicting the maximum roll angle in numerical simulations is remarked. Parametric roll in beam waves is also investigated experimentally. For broaching, probabilistic methodology of calculating probability of broaching is presented using deterministic thresholds. For stability under <b>dead</b> <b>ship</b> <b>condition,</b> a piece-wise linear approach is applied to annual capsizing probability prediction with sea state statistics. The first order reliability method (FORM) is also applied to this problem. These outcomes were reported at the IMO by the Royal Institution of Naval Architects (RINA) for development of the new generation intact stability criteria...|$|E

This paper describes a current status of this development for facilitating discussion among experts in stability research. It was already agreed to consist of 3 levelled criteria and onboard operational guidances for four different stability failure modes, which include pure loss of stability, parametric rolling, broaching and stability under <b>dead</b> <b>ship</b> <b>condition.</b> Member states submitted available methodologies with sample calculation results so far but the first level criteria for pure loss of stability and parametric rolling are still missing and the first level criterion for broaching is required to be further upgraded.

40|$|The Sub-Committee of Ship Design and Construction of International Maritime Organisation (IMO) has {{undertaken}} {{the development of}} "Second Generation Intact Stability Criteria (SGISC). The intention of the SGISC {{is to provide a}} new set of rules covering those phenomena which is not properly covered by present Intact Stability Code 2008. SGISC is additional rules that complement present rules. Five failure modes will be address in SGISC are excessive roll in <b>dead</b> <b>ship</b> <b>condition,</b> pure loss of stability, broaching involving loss of maneuverability in following quartering seas, parametric roll, and excessive acceleration. Moreover, these criteria are structured in three levels namely, first level, second level and direct assessment. Specific operational guidelines is added as a sort of "fourth level", in the acknowledge that not all dangerous situation can be avoided only by design prescriptions. In this particular study, it was investigated if and how an existing and extensively used commercial code, in the present case, General HydroStatics (GHS ®), could handle level 1 and level 2 criteria. Open source ship models were tested to evaluate the vulnerability of the ship to the SGISC. Finally an illustrative example is presented to verify whether the existing and future regulations can prevent certain obviously dangerous situations on naval ship operating in extreme weather...|$|E
40|$|The International Maritime Organization (IMO) {{decided to}} revise its intact {{stability}} criteria from prescriptive based criteria {{to be the}} performance based one. The new criteria should be capable to investigate stability failure in seaways such as <b>dead</b> <b>ship</b> <b>condition,</b> pure loss of stability, parametric rolling and broaching. In case of pure loss of stability in following and quartering seas, delegation of Japan and USA proposed vulnerability criteria level one based on the hull form characteristics of ships. These proposed criteria have been tested by using several different hull forms. However similar characteristics with the Indonesian ro-ro ferries have never been used to validate the criteria. The main characteristics of Indonesian ro-ro ferries are small draught with large breadth or large ratio of breadth and draught. Therefore {{it is important to}} investigate the pure loss of stability in following and quartering seas in order to investigate effect of some variables. This paper discusses about effects of wave direction, significant wave height and ship speed on roll motion characteristics of ships with large ratio of breadth and draught in irregular following and quartering seas. Two degree of freedom model is used to investigate the roll motion characteristics. The irregular wave is developed by using the ITTC wave spectrum and the linear and nonlinear damping coefficients of roll are estimated by using the Ikeda semi empirical method. The results show that the significant wave height has significant effect on the roll motion in following and quartering seas. Eventhought the ship may safely operate in the significant wave height of 2. 25 meters with maximum roll angle of 0. 545 radian or 31 degrees. In higher significant wave height, capsizing dangerous may occur due to pure loss of stability. The maximum roll angle does not significantly change due to alteration of the heading angle from wave direction. It means that the heading angle does not significant effect on roll motion in following and quartering seas. When the intial forward speed increases, the maximum roll angle decreases. However in a certain initial forward speed, the maximum roll angle increases because occurrence of resonance. This phenomena show that dangerous condition due to pure loss of stability may be avoided by change the ship speed...|$|E

40|$|Large {{amplitude}} {{roll motion}} in realistic seas {{is a serious}} threat to ship stability because it can lead to damage or even capsizing of the vessel. For the excessive roll motion in random seas, the nonlinear effects and dynamics associated with damping and restoring terms should be considered. Currently, the criteria of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) for evaluation of the intact stability are based on both hydrostatics and dynamics (IMO, 2008). However, due to the stochastic nature of the ocean environment and the randomness of the roll response, the assessment of extreme rolling should inevitably be based on dynamic considerations and probabilistic methods. With the awareness of the deficiencies of the current criteria for intact stability evaluation, the IMO is currently developing the next generation (also second generation) of such criteria with a certain consideration of the physics associated with the dynamics of nonlinear roll motion and the randomness of the ocean environment and roll response. In this work, probabilistic methods are proposed for studying the nonlinear behavior of the random roll motion as well as for evaluating the dynamic stability of the vessel in random seas. The problems of <b>dead</b> <b>ship</b> <b>condition</b> in random beam seas and parametric roll in random head seas are studied. For the first problem, the Markov theory is applied in order to study the stochastic nonlinear roll response. Specifically, the rolling behavior is described by a single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) model which incorporates the nonlinearities associated with the damping and restoring terms as well as the randomness of the wave excitation. The linear filter technique is employed to approximate the random external excitation and then the SDOF model is extended into a four-dimensional (4 D) Markov system whose probabilistic properties are governed by the Fokker-Planck (FP) equation. Based on the Markov property of the coupled dynamic system, the 4 D path integration (PI) method is introduced in order to solve the high-dimensional FP equation. The numerical robustness and high efficiency of the 4 D PI method are evaluated by comparing with the results from Monte Carlo simulation (MCS). Based on the PI method and the MCS method, the feasibility of applying the secondorder linear filter and the Gaussian white noise to approximate the random external excitation are studied. The 4 D dynamic system is shown to be an appropriate model for studying the stochastic roll response. With the assistance of the 4 D PI method, the influence of ship parameters and wind excitation on the stochastic roll response are investigated. Furthermore, the reliability evaluation associated with high response levels is studied and long-term extreme response is predicted by combing the 4 D PI method with the metocean description. In {{the second part of the}} thesis, the Grim effective wave model is introduced in order to approximate the variation of the restoring moment in random head seas. Based on the Grim effective wave approximation, the mathematical model for describing the rolling behavior is established. The linear filter technique and an efficient MCS method are applied to predict the extreme roll response of a vessel sailing in random head seas. It is demonstrated that the efficient MCS method is able to provide satisfactory estimation of the extreme roll response with a dramatic reduction of computation time, which is important for the subsequent long-term statistical evaluation. The probabilistic methods mentioned above and the results and conclusions obtained in this work hopefully can provide a useful reference for the second generation IMO intact stability criteria which are currently being developed as well as for stochastic dynamic analysis of nonlinear systems...|$|E
