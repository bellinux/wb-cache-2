40|$|PURPOSE: This {{study is}} aimed at making {{analysis}} of <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>syndrome</b> in leptospirosis. METHODS: Clinical symptoms and laboratory parameters of 84 cases with leptospirosis, which have been treated in the Clinic of Infectious Diseases at University Hospital, Pleven (1982 – 2005), are studied retrospectively. RESULTS: <b>Haemorrhagic</b> <b>syndrome</b> appears within five to nine days after clinical onset and occurs in 30, 95 % of cases. It is presented by petechial rash (30, 95 %) and bleeding from viscera (haematuria in 28, 57 %, melaena in 14, 28 %, haematemesis in 10, 71 %, epistaxis in 5, 95 %). Haemorrhages have been observed in 75 % of fatal cases and are risk factors for death. Laboratory investigations demonstrate anaemia (73, 81 %), thrombocytopenia (42, 86 %), increased fibrinogen (73, 81 %), prolonged prothrombin time (11, 90 %). Treatment includes antibiotics, corticoids, vessels stabilising drugs, diuretics, substitution with thrombocyte or erythrocyte concentrate, hemodiaperfusion.

40|$|Two viruses, {{infectious}} salmon anaemia (ISA) {{virus and}} a novel togavirus-like virus, were isolated from ISA disease outbreaks that were first reported as a new <b>syndrome,</b> <b>haemorrhagic</b> kidney <b>syndrome</b> (HKS) affecting farmed Atlantic salmon Salmo salar L. on the East coast of Canada. Laboratory confirmation of ISA diagnosis was initially complicated by isolation of only the togavirus-like agent using the CHSE- 214 cell line. Here we demonstrate that a clinical sample from a disease outbreak of ISA contained a mixture of ISA virus and togavirus-like virus. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed the presence of both viruses during serial passage of cultures in SHK- 1 and CHSE- 214 cells. Virus harvested at passage level 3 in both cell lines caused high mortalities and severe gross pathology consistent with ISA virus infection in experimentally inoculated Atlantic salmon parr (approximately 35 g) in freshwater, beginning 12 d post inoculation. ISA virus was detected by virus isolation from kidney and liver tissues of all dead or moribund fish tested. A comparison of virus isolation, 1 -step procedure RT-PCR and RNA dot-blot hybridization for detection of ISA virus (ISAV) in fish tissues showed virus isolation to have 100 % sensitivity, followed by RT-PCR (66 and 28 % sensitivity in kidney and liver, respectively), with RNA dot-blot hybridization as the least sensitive method (20 and 10 % sensitivity in kidney and liver, respectively). No togavirus-like virus was detected in these samples by virus isolation.

The disease {{is caused by}} the Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) belonging to the family Bunyaviridae and the genus Phlebovirus [Ikegami et al. 2011]. In animals, RVF may be asymptomatic in non-pregnant adults. Outbreaks are characterised by the onset of abortions storms and high neonatal mortality. Older animals can present hight fever, lymphadenitis, nasal and ocular discharges, diarrhoea often haemorrhagic, jaundice and hepatitis [Gerdes 2004, Davies et al. 2006]. RVFV infection in humans usually causes a self-limiting, acute and febrile illness; however, a small number of patients may present acute hepatitis, jaundice, renal failure, <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>syndrome</b> and neurological disorders [Adam et al. 2010, Mansfield et al. 2015].

40|$|Introduction: EEHV- 1 is a viral {{infection}} of elephants {{that has been}} associated with a fatal <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>syndrome</b> in Asian elephants. Previous studies have suggested that pregnant animals may shed more virus than non-pregnant animals. Methods: This study examined whether pregnancy affected the frequency or magnitude of shedding of elephant endotheliotropic herpesvirus 1 (EEHV 1) using Taq man real-time PCR on trunk washes from four female elephants from a UK collection over three time periods between 2011 and 2014. These periods included pregnancies in two animals (period 1 and period 3). Behavioural observations made by keepers were also assessed. Results: During period 1 there was a high degree of social hierarchical instability which led to a hierarchy change, and was associated with aggressive behaviour. Also during period 1 EEHV- 1 shedding was of a higher magnitude and frequency than in the latter two time periods. Conclusions: These results suggest that there is no clear relationship between shedding and pregnancy, and that behavioural stressors may be related to an increase in EEHV- 1 shedding...|$|E

40|$|Summary: The {{birth of}} a male baby was induced at 32 weeks. In utero, the child presented, inter alia, signs of hydrops, {{hepatosplenomegaly}} and anaemia. Two in utero transfusions for correction of the anaemia were performed at 28 and 29 weeks, respectively. The baby rapidly presented respiratory distress with mixed acidosis. Three hours after birth, pink urine was excreted. Signs of icterus necessitated phototherapy, after which photosensitivity occurred. Erythrocytes were fluorescent under long-wavelength UV light.

40|$|The first officially {{registered}} {{outbreak of}} {{infectious salmon anaemia}} (ISA) started in Norway in November 1984 (Thorud and Djupvik, 1988). It was a chronically proceeding disease among Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) parr in a hatchery on the West Coast of Norway (Bremnes). Affected salmon were lethargic with pale gills, fin rot, exophthalmia, and haemorrhages in the anterior eye chamber and abdominal skin. Other clinical signs were a dark, pale or yellowish liver, a dark and swollen spleen, congested intestinal walls, petechia in periviceral fat, ascitic fluid, oedemas, haemorrhages in the swim bladder wall, and muscular haemorrhages. About 80 % of the parr in the hatchery died during that winter and spring. Judging from the pathological findings, "Hitra disease" was suspected, however, no bacteria were isolated from diseased fish and oxytetracycline did not reduce mortality. In the following years a disease with similar clinical and pathological signs occurred in smolt and adult salmon in marine farms that had received smolt form this hatchery (Thorud 1991). The first official registration of ISA came at a very bad time for Norwegian salmon production. One problem was an ongoing discussion {{of the causes of}} "Hitra disease". Some insisted it was caused by malnutrition (Poppe et al 1986; Salte et al 1987), while others believed it was a bacterial disease (Holm et al 1985; Egidius et al 1986; Totland et al. 1988) and even managed to culture the bacterium that was later named Vibrio salmonicida (disease: cold water vibriosis). The dispute about the causes of "Hitra disease" goes back {{to the end of the}} seventies, and later studies have indicated that the reason for the disagreement was probably that "Hitra disease" encompassed at least three different diseases: cold water vibriosis, cardiomyopathy and ISA. There are several indications of this in articles published in Norwegian (cf. Frisk Fisk brochure from this period, i. e. published reports from the Norwegian Research council). In some electron microscopic studies of tissues from salmon with "Hitra disease", the authors were not able to detect any bacteria and described pathological changes that later studies have shown to be associated with ISA. Even as late as in 1987 the three diseases were confused. One farm in Northern Norway was given the diagnosis Bremnes syndrome (i. e. ISA), but this was later changed to cardiomyopathy. The reason for the confusion was of course the lack of a safe diagnosis. The first indication of ISA can probably be found as early as in 1977 (cf: Poppe et al. 1983). The authors give a review of <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>syndrome</b> of Atlantic salmon in Norwegian aquaculture. The first case of <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>syndrome</b> was registered in September/October 1977 in a fish farm close to Hammerfest, Northern Norway. They were not able to isolate any infective agent and therapy with oxytetracycline did not influence the mortality. The same disease was also registered in 1978 and in 1979 it was found in other areas in Northern Norway. Several explanations were given for this syndrome: stress, environmental stress, genetics, water temperature, malnutrition, virus (VHS, but it was not possible to isolate this virus), bacteria (it was not always possible to isolate bacteria, but in some farms Vibrio spp. were found), and physical factors. Studies of tissues from fish with <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>syndrome</b> have later revealed the presence of ISA virus particles in some of these tissues (A. Nylund, pers. com.). ISA was first named "Bremnes syndrome" after the locality of the first official appearance. This was later changed to Salmon anaemia syndrome (SAS). However, protest from an airline company made another change of name necessary and in 1990 ISA (Infectious Salmon Anaemia) was recognised by the Office International des Epizooties. In the period from the first official outbreak in 1984 until 1991 there was a steady increase in the number of outbreaks of the disease with around 80 in 1990 and 1991 (Figure 1). This increase lead to changes in the structure of salmon farming in Norway. The farmers introduced a system with separate generations at each site and the Norwegian Food Authorities introduced a number of regulatory actions like introduction of zones to combat outbreaks. This lead to a new situation in 1994 with only one official outbreak of ISA (cf. Håstein et al 1999). The number of outbreaks since 1994 up to the present has increased again to around 10 - 15 outbreaks every year. The number of outbreaks does not reflect the increase in the amount of salmon produced in the same period (1994 - 2010), indicating a certain degree of stabilisation...|$|E
40|$|Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli {{has since}} the last 2 decades been known to cause severe and bloody {{diarrhoea}} as well as haemorrhagic colitis (HC) and <b>haemorrhagic</b> uraemic <b>syndrome</b> (HUS) especially among children.

There are, however, other features adding to the pathogenicity. In this review {{we deal with the}} importance of properties such as fimbriae and adhesins as well as systems to meet the bacterial need for iron during infection. These factors are probably important for the establishment of EHEC in the gut and add to the bacterial virulence.

40|$|Infectious salmon anaemia virus (ISAV) was {{isolated}} from farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) {{associated with an}} outbreak of <b>haemorrhagic</b> kidney <b>syndrome</b> in the Bay of Fundy, Canada. The virus induced cytopathic effects in salmon head kidney cell line SHK- 1 from Atlantic salmon and was positively confirmed as ISAV by an indirect fluorescent antibody test and by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Atlantic salmon parr injected with ISAV from the SHK- 1 line experienced significant reductions in haematocrits as early as 5 days postinfection (DPI). Mortality began 17 DPI and reached 76 % by 24 DPI at a water temperature of 11 degrees C. In a second trial, similarly high mortality occurred in salmon parr injected with 10 -fold dilutions of supernatant from ISAV-infected SHK- 1 cultures. The ISAV was reisolated from 8 randomly selected salmon that died after experimental infection. Microscopic pathological changes among infected fish included congestion and necrosis, seen in the livers from 7 of 19 samples and in the kidney from 1 of 18 salmon examined. Other tissues affected included gill, intestine, and pyloric caeca. The absence of microscopic lesions in the remaining experimentally infected fish could not be explained. ...|$|R
40|$|Clostridium {{perfringens}} {{has been}} implicated in {{a broad array of}} enteric infections including the fatal <b>haemorrhagic</b> enteritis/enterotoxaemia <b>syndrome</b> in cattle. The beta 2 toxin (CPB 2), encoded by cpb 2, is suspected to be implicated in this syndrome. However, among C. perfringens isolates from cattle suspected of clostridial disease, an atypical allele was recently found to predominate at the cpb 2 locus and atypical corresponding CPB 2 proteins were shown to be poorly expressed, thus arguing against a biologically significant role of the beta 2 toxin in clostridial diseases in cattle. This study compared genotype and phenotype of the beta 2 toxin between C. perfringens isolates from a group of healthy calves (n = 14, 87 isolates) and from a group of enterotoxaemic calves (n = 8, 41 isolates). PCR results revealed the exclusive presence of the typical "consensus" cpb 2 in the enterotoxaernic group. Western blot analysis demonstrated that the typical variant of CPB 2 was often expressed in isolates from enterotoxaemic calves (43. 9 %) and infrequently in isolates from healthy cattle (6. 9 %). These data suggest that the typical variant of the CPB 2 toxin {{may play a role in}} the pathogenesis of cattle enterotoxaemia. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. Peer reviewe...|$|R
