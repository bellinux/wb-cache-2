5000|$|Multi-level {{marketing}} (...) {{was first}} introduced to China by American, Taiwanese, and Japanese companies following the Chinese economic reform of 1978. This rise in multi-level marketing's popularity coincided with economic uncertainty and a new shift towards individual consumerism. Multi-level marketing was banned on the mainland {{by the government in}} 1998, citing social, economic, and taxation issues. Further regulation [...] "Prohibition of Chuanxiao" [...] (where MLM is a type of Chuanxiao, Chinese name of the regulation is 《禁止传销条例》 [...] ), was enacted in 2005, clause 3 of Chapter 2 of the regulation states having <b>downlines</b> is illegal (original text from the regulation '组织者或者经营者通过发展人员，要求被发展人员发展其他人员加入，形成上下线关系，并以下线的销售业绩为依据计算和给付上线报酬，牟取非法利益的。').

40|$|Offshore oil & gas {{production}} {{is an industry}} where breaking records has become a necessity. So-called unconventional oil in ultra-deep water (2000 m+) requires rethinking of current production techniques, as steel tubing begins to buckle under its own weight. Other problems arise from corrosion of pipelines at all depths, requiring expensive maintenance schedules and production interruptions. Airborne Oil & Gas’ (AOG) novel Thermoplastic Composite Pipe (TCP) promises to relieve many of these problems. A light-weight GFRP pipe with excellent corrosion resistance, spooling capability and outstanding mechanical performance figures, it promises to become the go-to technology for many, if not all, of the offshore exploration and production (E&P) majors. Offshore, <b>downlines</b> and risers experience heavy loads due to moving vessels/topsides. Such loads induce fatigue in these risers, and TCP must be subjected to careful analysis {{of the nature of}} these loads. This is the main topic of this thesis. Developing methods (and a simulation tool to apply them) to (conservatively) predict fatigue loads on TCP risers for various wave climate conditions. A method based on the concepts of Response Amplitude Operators (RAO’s) is developed to simulate vessel motions for simple (unidirectional) wave climates, as well as for complex combinations of spatially distributed components making up ‘confused’ wave climates, which may consist of any combination of wind- and/or swell-induced wave components. These vessel motions are consequently used as input for a dynamic analysis in Abaqus, a well-known finite-element package available at AOG. Stresses within the TCP as simulated by Abaqus are used in a simplified fatigue model, yielding qualitative results regarding fatigue performance of TCP in offshore service under varying circumstances. Rainflow counting is used to determine the number, and magnitude, of fatigue cycles experienced, while fatigue life is evaluated by assuming a homogeneous material for the TCP. The homogeneous assumption does not hold for actual TCP, which is highly non-linear in material behaviour, but serves as a proof of concept of the tool developed and invites for further development of the methods presented to account for such non-linearities. Findings include good agreement between the proposed model and theoretical results for vessel motions. An important effect of currents on the dynamics and stability of the system is discussed. Furthermore, the derogatory effect of increasing wave heights and failure to correctly ‘weathervane’ the vessel (i. e., failure to meet incoming waves head-on) on the proposed fatigue life is discussed. Increasing wave height by 150 % seems to more than half fatigue life, while changing the direction of wave-impact upon the vessel by 45 degrees seems to have similarly serious impact, although a more extensive analysis programme is required to confirm such statements.
