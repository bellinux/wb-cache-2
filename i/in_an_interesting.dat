25|$|Asymmetric ion pairs {{can also}} be {{attacked}} in intermolecular reactions. <b>In</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> example, asymmetric addition of enol silane nucleophiles to oxocarbenium ions can be effected by catalytically forming the oxocarbenium through anion binding. Starting from an acetal, the chloroether is generated with boron trichloride and reacted with the enol silane and catalyst. The mechanism of formation of the oxocarbenium-thiourea-chloride complex is not fully resolved. It is thought that under the reaction conditions, the chloroether can epimerize and thiourea can stereoselectively bind chloride to form a closely associated ion pair. This asymmetric ion pair is then attacked by the silane to generate alkylated product.|$|E

Goaltender Ilya Bryzgalov shined as the Ducks swept the Avalanche in four-straight games, Bryzgalov breaking Giguere's scoreless streak record from the 2003 Stanley Cup playoffs.

25|$|Because it {{encompasses}} many species-rich ecosystems for animals, fungi and plants, Brazil houses {{many thousands}} of species, with many (if not most) of them still undiscovered.

ISU finished the season ranked #25 and their nine wins were a program best since 1906. They were then invited to play in the Insight.com Bowl against Pittsburgh, Iowa State's first appearance in a bowl game since the 1978 Peach Bowl. Iowa State was able to beat the Panthers 37–29, this was the first post-season victory in program history. <b>In</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> side note, Paul Rhoads was the defensive coordinator for Pittsburgh in this game; he would later become the Iowa State head coach.|$|E
25|$|McCarthy {{first came}} to {{prominence}} on the inter-county scene {{as a member of}} the Cork minor hurling team in the early 1960s. He lined out for Cork in this grade in 1963, however, his side was defeated in the early rounds of the championship. In 1964 McCarthy was a key member of both the Cork under-21 and intermediate hurling teams. Success was slow in coming but the big breakthrough for Cork and McCarthy came in 1966. That year he won a Munster title with the under-21 team following a 5–12 to 2–6 defeat of Limerick. The subsequent All-Ireland final saw Cork play Wexford <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> encounter. After an entertaining sixty minutes of hurling both sides finished level with Cork scoring 3–12 to Wexford's 5–6. The replay took place shortly afterwards, however, both sides finished all square again with 4–9 apiece. A second replay had to be played to eventually find a winner. At the third time of asking Cork emerged victorious with a huge tally of 9–9 to 5–9.

The Ducks had a rough start to the season, however, but the plan was ultimately successful. The Ducks {{became one of the}} best teams in the NHL down the stretch and earned the sixth seed in the West and playoff matchup with the Calgary Flames. <b>In</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> playoff where the bottom four seeds all eliminated the top four seeds, the Ducks beat the heavily favored Flames in seven games. The Mighty Ducks shut-out the Flames 3–0 in Game 7 in Calgary. In the second round, the Ducks then swept the Colorado Avalanche, riding the outstanding play of backup goaltender Ilya Bryzgalov. (Bryzgalov had previously taken over for Giguere during the first round due to an injury to the Mighty Ducks' starting goalie, and went on to break Giguere's 2003 shutout streak.) The Mighty Ducks had home ice advantage in their second Western Conference Final against the equally surprising eighth-seeded Edmonton Oilers.

25|$|Eighteen wickets fell on {{the frantic}} first day at St Lawrence Ground, and {{nineteen}} on the second, as two teams clashed <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting,</b> low scoring match that lasted for only 173.4 overs. The Bangladesh A tourists had won the coin toss and chosen to bat, but immediately lost Nafees Iqbal for a duck. However, Tushar Imran made 86, and with some help from Shahriar Nafees (with 30) and Nazimuddin (27), he took the score to 185. That total did not look challenging, {{but that was before}} Syed Rasel's medium pace came to the scene. After Niall O'Brien and Neil Dexter put on 13 for the first wicket for Kent, Rasel and Shahadat Hossain dug out two wickets each, as Kent lost four wickets for two runs. Rasel took three more wickets before stumps on day one, and two more on the second morning, to end with seven for 50 - the only five-wicket-haul of Bangladesh A on the tour. However, only Shahriar Nafees passed 20 in the second innings, Tushar lost his golden touch (before this innings, he had made 455 runs at a batting average of 65) to only scamper 12 runs, while Antiguan-born Robbie Joseph took five for 19 with his pace bowling. Kent were set 188 to win, and lost wickets at regular intervals, but 54 from the first-class debutant Dexter turned out to be crucial as Kent made it with three wickets to spare.|$|E
25|$|Many Anglo-Saxon {{people needed}} to learn Norman French to {{communicate}} with their rulers, {{but it is clear}} that among themselves they kept speaking Old English, which meant that England was <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> tri-lingual situation: Anglo-Saxon for the common people, Latin for the Church, and Norman French for the administrators, the nobility, and the law courts. In this time, and due to the cultural shock of the Conquest, Anglo-Saxon began to change very rapidly, and by 1200 or so, it was no longer Anglo-Saxon English, but what scholars call early Middle English. But this language had deep roots in Anglo-Saxon, which was being spoken a lot later than 1066. Research in the early twentieth century, and still continuing today, has shown that a form of Anglo-Saxon was still being spoken, and not merely among uneducated peasants, into the thirteenth century in the West Midlands. This was J.R.R. Tolkien's major scholarly discovery when he studied a group of texts written in early Middle English called the Katherine Group, because they include the Life of St. Katherine (also, the Life of St. Margaret, the Life and the Passion of St. Juliana, Ancrene Wisse, and Hali Meithhad—these last two teaching how to be a good anchoress and arguing for the goodness of virginity). Tolkien noticed that a subtle distinction preserved in these texts indicated that Old English had continued to be spoken far longer than anyone had supposed. In Old English there is a distinction between two different kinds of verbs.|$|E
