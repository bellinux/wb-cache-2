5|$|At {{the time}} the penalty was taken, the Welsh dugout was {{surrounded}} by press and photographers, as the home team were still leading 1–0. With the scores levelled, the pack switched {{their attention to the}} Scottish bench, which led to Stein remonstrating with at least one photographer {{to move out of the}} way of <b>his</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game. Both Professor Stewart Hillis, the Scotland team doctor (who was also Stein's consultant), and Welsh manager Mike England stated that there appeared to be nothing wrong at this point.|$|E

5|$|The race {{took place}} in the {{afternoon}} from 14:00 CEST (UTC+2), in dry and sunny weather. At the start of the race, J.J. Lehto stalled his Benetton on the grid. Pedro Lamy, starting from further back on the grid, had <b>his</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stationary Benetton blocked by other cars and hit the back of Lehto's car, causing bodywork and tyres to fly into the air. Parts of the car went over the safety fencing designed to protect spectators at the startline causing minor injuries to nine people. Further back, Martin Brundle had a good start, overtaking two cars as well as Lehto, propelling him from thirteenth to tenth place.|$|E

5|$|The son of {{a wealthy}} {{landowner}} and cleric, Heber gained an early reputation at the University of Oxford as a poet. After graduation, he expanded <b>his</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world by undertaking, {{at the height of}} the Napoleonic Wars, an extended tour of Scandinavia, Russia and central Europe. He was ordained in 1807, and took over his father's old parish of Hodnet in Shropshire. He combined his pastoral duties with other church offices, hymn-writing, and more general literary work which included a critical study of the complete works of the 17th-century cleric Jeremy Taylor.|$|E
5|$|Japanese voice {{recording}} {{for the game}} began two years before its release in 2008. Several voice actors had worked on other tri-Ace titles in the past. Beyond merely being given directions for their performances, the actors were able {{to contribute to the}} characters' personalities. Many characters were revised based on suggestions given by their voice actors during recording. The cast enjoyed their experience, as the game gave them the opportunity for a large range of performances, from comedic to dramatic scenes. Overall, the production process for both actors and development staff was a positive one. The English {{voice recording}} began in August 2009 under the supervision of Sega. Recording took place at studios in Los Angeles, and was overseen by Shimano and Suguro. Speaking about <b>his</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three main actors, Shimano was impressed, praising DiCocco's range and expression for Leanne and noting Menville's performances as Zephyr required fewer retakes than other actors.|$|E
5|$|Koṇḍañña {{thereafter}} {{vowed that}} he would follow when Siddhartha became an ascetic {{to learn from the}} future Buddha's findings. In the meantime, Suddhodana attempted to foil Koṇḍañña's prediction because he wanted his son to succeed him in ruling and expanding the kingdom. Suddhodana made intricate arrangements to shield Siddhartha from all worldly suffering in order to steer his mind away from spiritual matters, pampering him with all the material luxury and sense pleasures that he could find. However, Siddhartha finally persuaded his father to allow him out of the palace to meet his subjects. Suddhodana agreed, but attempted to present a sanitised image of human existence by ordering beggars, old people and sick people to be kept from the streets. Despite this, Siddhartha saw the four sights which prompted him to reevaluate <b>his</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world.|$|E

5|$|The {{concept of}} the {{existence}} of an actual infinity was an important shared concern within the realms of mathematics, philosophy and religion. Preserving the orthodoxy of the relationship between God and mathematics, although not in the same form as held by his critics, was long a concern of Cantor's. He directly addressed this intersection between these disciplines in the introduction to his Grundlagen einer allgemeinen Mannigfaltigkeitslehre, where he stressed the connection between <b>his</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> infinite and the philosophical one. To Cantor, his mathematical views were intrinsically linked to their philosophical and theological implications – he identified the Absolute Infinite with God, and he considered his work on transfinite numbers to have been directly communicated to him by God, who had chosen Cantor to reveal them to the world.|$|E
5|$|The {{marriage}} between PedroII and Teresa Cristina started off badly. With maturity, patience and their first child, Afonso, their relationship improved. Later Teresa Cristina {{gave birth to}} more children: Isabel, in 1846; Leopoldina, in 1847; and lastly, Pedro, in 1848. However, both boys died when very young, which devastated the Emperor. Beyond suffering as a father, <b>his</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Empire's future changed completely. Despite his affection for his daughters, {{he did not believe}} that Princess Isabel, although his heir, would have any chance of prospering on the throne. He felt his successor needed to be male for the monarchy to be viable. He increasingly saw the imperial system as being tied so inextricably to himself, that it would not survive him. Isabel and her sister received a remarkable education, although they were given no preparation for governing the nation. PedroII excluded Isabel from participation in government business and decisions.|$|E
5|$|In December 1941 at {{the start}} of direct {{involvement}} of the U.S. in , Haynes was made base commander of Borinquen Field, an important defensive stronghold in the Caribbean and the first refueling stop after Florida in the southern route to Cairo. The following February he returned to Washington, D.C., to organize Force Aquila, the advance party of the Tenth Air Force, an operation that intended to bomb Tokyo using B-17s and B-24s flying from bases in the Zhejiang province of eastern China, supplied by C-47 Skytrains. In Florida, Haynes gathered a force of one B-24, 12 B-17 bombers and a small group of C-47s. Haynes and his mixed unit flew individually to Brazil, then Africa, and on to Karachi, India; landing in April 1942 with no losses. One of the B-17 pilots, Robert Lee Scott, Jr., wrote about <b>his</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> voyage in his autobiography, God Is My Co-Pilot. Haynes began organizing the supply lines for HALPRO, beginning with aviation fuel deliveries to China. On April 9, Colonel William D. Old piloted the first flight over the Hump; Haynes the second. The airmen were chagrined to hear that, with the Doolittle Raid, other Americans had beaten them in being first to attack Tokyo. A further blow came in May 1942 when Japanese forces captured the Chinese bases HALPRO was to use. The project was canceled and its men and B-17s were reassigned by General Lewis H. Brereton {{to become part of the}} Tenth Air Force. The HALPRO group of B-24s never reached Karachi; instead, the initial group was diverted to the Ninth Air Force in North Africa.|$|E

5|$|Karas is {{the title}} for the city's {{appointed}} agents. Capable of transforming into automobiles and aircraft, they are suits of armor animated by human souls infused into them through Yurine's chanting of a Shinto prayer. Director Sato told his animators to enhance the Karas dark nature by drawing their faces in shadows. Fight scenes involving Karas take place mostly in dark settings shrouded with steam or lit with spotlights. Animators touched up film frames by hand, creating an effect different from cel-shaded animation. To make the Karas more menacing, they highlighted the eyes as if light bulbs were shining through them, a technique inspired by the suitmation practice of using light bulbs for the eyes of costumes. Producer Takaya Ibira explained the presence of ravens in Tokyo and the Tower of London, inspired him and Sato to model the agents of the city after them. He stated ravens {{are believed to be}} omens of good and bad in superstitions, and they always seem to be watching over the cities. This resonated with <b>his</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> raven in the story Noah's Ark, which cursed Noah as it scouted for land. The presence of ravens all over Tokyo led Ibira to notice the same of cats and conceive the Yurines as catgirls.|$|E
5|$|Partly in {{response}} to {{what he saw as}} unsound and unscientific speculations by William Buckland and other practitioners of flood geology, Charles Lyell advocated the geological theory of uniformitarianism in his influential work Principles of Geology. Lyell amassed evidence, both from his own field research and the work of others, that most geological features could be explained by the slow action of present-day forces, such as vulcanism, earthquakes, erosion, and sedimentation rather than past catastrophic events. Lyell also claimed that the apparent evidence for catastrophic changes in the fossil record, and even the appearance of directional succession in the history of life, were illusions caused by imperfections in that record. For instance he argued that the absence of birds and mammals from the earliest fossil strata was merely an imperfection in the fossil record attributable to the fact that marine organisms were more easily fossilized. Also Lyell pointed to the Stonesfield mammal as evidence that mammals had not necessarily been preceded by reptiles, and to the fact that certain Pleistocene strata showed a mixture of extinct and still surviving species, which he said showed that extinction occurred piecemeal rather than as a result of catastrophic events. Lyell was successful in convincing geologists of the idea that the geological features of the earth were largely due to the action of the same geologic forces that could be observed in the present day, acting {{over an extended period of}} time. He was not successful in gaining support for <b>his</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fossil record, which he believed did not support a theory of directional succession.|$|E
