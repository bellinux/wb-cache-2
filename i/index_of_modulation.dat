The objective of this project was to test if reflex excitability could be modified with arm and leg (A & L) cycling training. Nineteen individuals with chronic stroke (more than six months postlesion) performed 30 min of A & L cycling training {{three times a week}} for five weeks. Changes in reflex excitability were inferred from modulation of cutaneous and stretch reflexes. A multiple baseline (three pretests) within-subject control design was used. Plasticity in reflex excitability was determined as an increase in the conditioning effect of arm cycling on soleus stretch reflex amplitude on the more affected side, by the <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>modulation,</b> and by the modulation ratio between sides for cutaneous reflexes.

40|$|This study {{concentrates}} {{to investigate}} the relationship between laser fabrication parameters and reflectivity of fiber gratings. The fiber Bragg grating system, comprising Excimer Laser, Mask Aligner, Optical Spectrum Analyzer and Tunable Laser Source was utilized to fabricate the fiber gratings. A series of experiments were carried out for the fabrication of fiber gratings and to observe the effect of laser fabrication parameters on the reflectivity of fiber gratings. These samples were fabricated with different reflectivity's ranging from 27 to 93 % at constant pulse rate i. e. 1 Hz. The amount of reflectivity {{is the extent to}} which the index modulation in the fiber core changes. The higher the reflectivity of a fiber grating, the more microstructural changes occur within the lattice of the photosensitive core and the more the residual axial stress builds up within the cross section of the fiber. Here, we discussed only two laser fabrications parameters i. e. effect of pulse energy on reflectivity of fiber grating and effect of exposure time on reflectivity of fiber grating/Bragg wavelength. Based on the results of this study, it is inferred that reflectivity is exponentially increased, as the pulse energy increase at constant UV exposure time and attained saturation at pulse energy i. e. 165 mJ. The low pulse energy produces a low reflectivity fiber Bragg grating even after a longer UV exposure time. It is also concluded that both reflectivity and Bragg wavelength are increased rapidly in the beginning with the increase of UV exposure time and then become saturated at UV exposure time i. e. 110 min, even though pulse energy is constant. It means that the induced <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>modulation</b> was increased with the increasing of UV exposure time...|$|E

40|$|Startle is a fast {{response}} elicited by sudden acoustic, tactile, or visual stimuli {{in a variety}} of animals and in humans. As the magnitude of startle response can be modulated by external and internal variables, it can be a useful tool to study reaction to stress. Our study evaluated whether acupuncture can change cardiac autonomic modulation (heart rate variability); and behavioural (reactivity) and endocrine (cortisol levels) parameters in response to startle. Brazilian Sport horses (�� = 6) were subjected to a model of startle in which an umbrella was abruptly opened near the horse. Before startle, the horses were subjected to a 20 -minute session of acupuncture in acupoints GV 1, HT 7, GV 20, and BL 52 (ACUP) and in nonpoints (NP) or left undisturbed (CTL). For analysis of the heart rate variability, ultrashort-term (64 s) heart rate series were interpolated (4 Hz) and divided into 256 -point segments and the spectra integrated into low (LF; 0. 01 – 0. 07 Hz; <b>index</b> <b>of</b> sympathetic <b>modulation)</b> and high (HF; 0. 07 – 0. 50 Hz; <b>index</b> <b>of</b> parasympathetic <b>modulation)</b> frequency bands. Acupuncture (ACUP) changed the sympathovagal balance with a shift towards parasympathetic modulation, reducing the prompt startle-induced increase in LF/HF and reducing cortisol levels 30 min after startle. However, acupuncture elicited no changes in behavioural parameters. Fil: Villas Boas, Julia Dias. Universidade Federal Rural do Rio de Janeiro; BrasilFil: Martins Dias, Daniel Penteado.

The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate whether baseline <b>indexes</b> <b>of</b> autonomic <b>modulation</b> <b>of</b> heart rate or baroreflex sensitivity were correlated with cardiovascular reactivity to stress. Spectral parameters of RR interval variability and the LFalpha-index were calculated in a resting condition in 53 untreated subjects (34 hypertensives; 19 normotensives).

The cardiovascular reactivity was not correlated with either baseline spectral parameters of RR interval variability or LFalpha-index. In the multivariate analysis no confounding effect of diagnosis (hypertension vs normotension) was found. Moreover no interaction between diagnosis and both LF/HF ratio and LFalpha-index was observed. Thus, the cardiovascular response to a mental stimulus appears to prevail over the baseline pattern of cardiovascular regulation independently of the presence or absence of the hypertensive disease...|$|R
