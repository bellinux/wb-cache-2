5|$|From a {{strategic}} point of view, the Athenians had some disadvantages at Marathon. In order {{to face the}} Persians in battle, the Athenians had to summon all available hoplites; and even then they were still probably outnumbered at least 2 to 1. Furthermore, raising such a large army had denuded Athens of defenders, and thus any secondary attack in the Athenian rear would cut the army off from the city; and any direct attack on the city could not be defended against. Still further, defeat at Marathon would mean the complete defeat of Athens, since no other Athenian army existed. The Athenian strategy was therefore to keep the Persian army pinned down at Marathon, blocking both exits from the plain, and thus preventing themselves from being outmaneuvered. However, these disadvantages were balanced by some advantages. The Athenians initially {{had no need to}} seek battle, since they had managed to confine the Persians to the plain of Marathon. Furthermore, time worked in their favour, as every day brought the arrival of the Spartans closer. Having everything to lose by attacking, and much to gain by waiting, the Athenians remained on the defensive in the run up to the battle. Tactically, hoplites were vulnerable to attacks by cavalry, and since the Persians had substantial numbers of cavalry, this made any offensive maneuver by the Athenians <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> risk, and thus reinforced the defensive strategy of the Athenians.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, initial {{support to}} develop {{alternative}} fuels {{by the government}} was also {{a response to the}} first oil crisis, and some time later, as a goal to improve air quality. Also, liquid fuels were preferred over gaseous fuels not only because they have a better volumetric energy density but also because they were the most compatible fuels with existing distribution systems and engines, thus avoiding a big departure from the existing technologies and taking advantage of the vehicle and the refueling infrastructure. California led the search of sustainable alternatives with interest focused in methanol. Ford Motor Company and other automakers responded to California's request for vehicles that run on methanol. In 1981, Ford delivered 40 dedicated methanol fuel (M100) Escorts to Los Angeles County, but only four refueling stations were installed. The biggest challenge in the development of alcohol vehicle technology was getting all of the fuel system materials compatible with the higher chemical reactivity of the fuel. Methanol was <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> challenge than ethanol but much of the early experience gained with neat ethanol vehicle production in Brazil was transferable to methanol. The success of this small experimental fleet of M100s led California to request more of these vehicles, mainly for government fleets. In 1983, Ford built 582 M100 vehicles; 501 went to California, and the remaining to New Zealand, Sweden, Norway, United Kingdom, and Canada.|$|E
25|$|During {{the public}} {{consultation}} phase many locals {{objected to the}} construction of the Seabird Centre {{on the grounds that the}} harbour area would not be able to cope with the large number of visitors, and that the large-scale construction required could damage the historic area.

25|$|Leeds {{struggled}} {{during their}} First Division debut season in 1924–25 and finished in 18th place. The following 1925–26 season was <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> struggle, {{and the club}} only just avoided relegation. The 1926–27 season finally saw Leeds relegated to Second Division, and Fairclough resigned as manager. His replacement was his former assistant Dick Ray, who had left Elland Road in 1923 to manage Doncaster Rovers.|$|E
25|$|The {{match at}} Chelmsford {{was made into}} <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> slog-effort by the English rain, as both sides were limited to 12 overs. Andy Flower made 46 off 29 balls, and 17 extras made the Essex Eagles run-rate exactly eleven an over.

25|$|The Gaza Strip {{was chosen}} as another {{military}} objective because Israel wished to remove the training grounds for Fedayeen groups, and because Israel recognised that Egypt could use the territory as a staging ground for attacks against the advancing Israeli troops.

25|$|For the Unionist leaders, the Larne gun-running was <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{political}} coup than {{a military}} feat. The Ulster Volunteers remained inadequately armed, as the weapons shipment contained {{three types of}} weapon and insufficient proper ammunition for them. Other historians consider that the Mauser 1898 model was advanced for its time, and the Larne delivery markedly increased the amount of arms for the UVF. Many much smaller weapons purchases had resulted in the UVF as having just over 37,000 rifles by June 1914.|$|E
25|$|Another work by De la Court, Political Discourses caused <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> furore. In it he denounces all (quasi-)monarchy as {{harming the}} true {{interest}} of the citizen (which he distinguishes from the subjects of monarchies), because hereditary power subordinates the public good to dynastic concerns. For good measure he added {{that it was necessary}} for the public good to curb the influence of the Public Church outside its proper sphere in the spiritual domain. This, of course, earned him the enmity of the leadership of his Leyden church that barred him from the Lord's Supper in retaliation.|$|E
25|$|The {{fact that}} the Inchoatia taxa are very disjunctly {{distributed}} means that attempting to discriminate species as against subspecies is <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> subjective opinion than usual, because reproductive isolation under natural conditions cannot be observed. An objective or a generally accepted method to weigh morphological differences does not exist. DNA analyses may be extremely helpful, but cannot always be considered decisive with regard to species or subspecies status. Molecular phylogeny reconstructions made clear that reproductive isolation and lineage splitting do not always run entirely parallel, resulting in paraphyletic species. In Inchoatia, with some island-like distributions of presumably high alpine taxa, this {{may also be the}} case.|$|E

25|$|By {{the end of}} Akbar's reign, local folk tales emerged {{involving}} his {{interactions with}} Akbar, portraying him as being extremely clever and witty. As the tales gained popularity in India, he became <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> legendary figure across the Indian subcontinent. These tales involve him outsmarting rival courtiers and sometimes even Akbar, using only his intelligence and cunning, often with giving witty and humorous responses and impressing Akbar. From the twentieth century onwards, plays, films and books based on these folk tales were made, {{some of these are}} in children's comics and school textbooks. However, no historical evidence attests that Birbal influenced Akbar by his witticisms.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to the works of Boyz II Men, Babyface and similar artists, other R artists and groups from this same period began adding <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hip-hop sound to their work, like the innovative group Jodeci. The synthesizer-heavy rhythm tracks of new jack swing were replaced by grittier East Coast hip hop-inspired backing tracks, resulting in a genre labeled hip hop soul by Mary J. Blige and producer Sean Combs who also had mentored group Jodeci in the beginning and helped them with their unique look. The style became less popular {{by the end of}} the 1990s, but later experienced a resurgence.|$|E
25|$|Starting in {{the early}} 1970s, the historiography of the Mayan kingdoms - first of all Palenque - came to occupy the forefront. Art-historical {{interpretation}} joined the historical approach pioneered by Proskouriakoff {{as well as the}} mythological approach initiated by M.D. Coe, with a professor of art, Linda Schele, serving as a driving force. Schele's seminal interpretations of Maya art are found throughout her work, especially in The Blood of Kings, written together with art historian M. Miller. Maya art history was also spurred by the enormous increase in sculptural and ceramic imagery, due to extensive archaeological excavations, as well as to organized looting on an unprecedented scale. On from 1973, M.D. Coe published a series of books offering pictures and interpretations of unknown Maya vases, with the Popol Vuh Twin myth for an explanatory model. In 1981, Robicsek and Hales added an inventory and classification of Maya vases painted in codex style, thereby revealing <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hitherto barely known spiritual world.|$|E

25|$|The {{concept for}} Tomb Raider {{originated}} in 1993 at Core Design, a British game development studio. One {{of the men}} most involved in its creation was Toby Gard, who was mostly responsible for creating the character of Lara Croft. Gard originally envisioned her as a man: company co-founder Jeremy Heath-Smith was worried the character {{would be seen as}} derivative of Indiana Jones, so Gard changed the character's gender. Her design underwent multiple revisions and redrafts during early development. The game proved an unexpected commercial success, reversing Eidos' then-bleak financial situation. After the success of Tomb Raider, work began almost at once on a sequel. After the first game's success, Gard was no longer given full creative control, and it was stated by development staff that he was both saddened and disappointed by the use of Lara Croft's sex appeal in marketing. Gard left Core Design in 1997 to found his own gaming company Confounding Factor, and was replaced by Stuart Atkinson. Tomb Raider II proved <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> commercial success than the original.|$|E
25|$|By {{the year}} 1860, the City of New Orleans {{was in a}} {{position}} of unprecedented economic, military, and political power. The Mexican–American War, along with the annexation of Texas, had made New Orleans <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> springboard for expansion. The California Gold Rush contributed another share to local wealth. The electrical telegraph arrived in New Orleans in 1848, and the completion of the New Orleans, Jackson, and Great Northern Railroad from New Orleans to Canton, a distance of over , added another dimension to local transportation. The combination of all these factors resulted in an increase in the price of prime field hands of 21 per cent in 1848, and further increases as the value of trade grew through the 1850s. By 1860 New Orleans {{was one of the greatest}} ports in the world, with 33 different steamship lines and trade worth 500 million dollars passing through the city. As far as population, the city not only outnumbered any other city in the South, it was larger than the four next-largest Southern cities combined, with an estimated population of 168,675.|$|E

25|$|Due to the {{uncertainty}} of future supply and demand fluctuations, and the price risk imposed on the farmer, said farmer may use different financial transactions to reduce, or hedge, their risk. One such transaction {{is the use of}} forward contracts. Forward contracts are mutual agreements to deliver a certain amount of a commodity at a certain date for a specified price and each contract is unique to the buyer and seller. For this example, the farmer can sell a number of forward contracts equivalent to the amount of wheat he expects to harvest and essentially lock in the current price of wheat. Once the forward contracts expire, the farmer will harvest the wheat and deliver it to the buyer at the price agreed to in the forward contract. Therefore, the farmer has reduced his risks to fluctuations in the market of wheat because he has already guaranteed a certain number of bushels for a certain price. However, there are still many risks associated with this type of hedge. For example, if the farmer has a low yield year and he harvests less than the amount specified in the forward contracts, he must purchase the bushels elsewhere in order to fill the contract. This becomes <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> problem when the lower yields affect the entire wheat industry and the price of wheat increases due to supply and demand pressures. Also, while the farmer hedged all of the risks of a price decrease away by locking in the price with a forward contract, he also gives up the right to the benefits of a price increase. Another risk associated with the forward contract is the risk of default or renegotiation. The forward contract locks in a certain amount and price at a certain future date. Because of that, there is always the possibility that the buyer will not pay the amount required {{at the end of the}} contract or that the buyer will try to renegotiate the contract before it expires.|$|E
