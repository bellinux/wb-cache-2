Touring vehicles were powered by low-emissions renewable biodiesel, a fuel made partly from vegetable oil. Non-profit organizations Love Hope Strength and HeadCount joined the tour for select dates.|$|E
5|$|The addax are amply {{suited to}} live in the deep desert under extreme conditions. They can survive without <b>free</b> <b>water</b> almost indefinitely, because they get {{moisture}} from their food and dew that condenses on plants. Scientists believe the addax has a special lining in its stomach that stores water in pouches to use in times of dehydration. They also produce highly concentrated urine to conserve water. Pale colour of the coat reflects radiant heat, and the length and density of the coat helps in thermoregulation. In the day the addax huddle together in shaded areas, and in cool nights rest in sand hollows. These practices help in dissipation of body heat and saving water by cooling the body through evaporation.|$|E

25|$|As part of {{this review}} process, Durban has now changed its {{implementation}} of the <b>free</b> basic <b>water</b> policy: Households living in properties that are valued above a certain threshold now must prove that their income is below the poverty limit, {{in order to continue}} to receive <b>free</b> basic <b>water.</b> The reason for the change was that most of those benefiting from <b>free</b> basic <b>water</b> were not poor. They used less than amount of <b>free</b> basic <b>water</b> - 9 cubic meters per month in the case of Durban - {{for the simple reason that}} there were two or less residents in the household.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} the first {{results of the}} TerraDew research project {{about the effects of}} <b>free</b> vegetation <b>water</b> on the radar backscatter signal. The investigations are based on intensive SAR and field measurements of diurnal <b>free</b> vegetation <b>water</b> changes in different vegetation types. The results show a systematic backscatter influence in dependence of the investigated backscatter features (wavelength, polarization, vegetation structure, amount of <b>free</b> vegetation <b>water).</b> The highest backscatter increase is found at C-VV and for grassland (up to 4. 5 dB), no significant backscatter change is indicated for L-VV and forested areas. The further investigations will focus on the physical description and simulation of these effects to include them in backscatter models and the evaluation of the impacts for thematic SAR data analysis...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{benefits}} of recycling water to industry is the opportunity to <b>free</b> existing potable <b>water</b> supplies for new customers. A recycling plant was commissioned in May 2001 in Merebank, Durban. The plant receives effluent from the Durban Southern Wastewater Treatment works and treats it to an acceptable standard for industrial use. However, as with any industrial activity there are costs and benefits associated. This paper describes the environmental, social and macroeconomic costs and benefits associated with recycling water. This is approach considers the triple bottom line associated with water recycling and providing <b>free</b> basic <b>water</b> thus providing a holistic picture of the provision of <b>free</b> basic <b>water</b> in Durban...|$|R
25|$|The {{action on}} the distal tubules is {{independent}} of any inhibitory effect on carbonic anhydrase or aldosterone; it also abolishes the corticomedullary osmotic gradient and blocks negative, as well as positive, <b>free</b> <b>water</b> clearance. Because of the large NaCl absorptive capacity of the loop of Henle, diuresis is not limited by development of acidosis, {{as it is with}} the carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.|$|E
25|$|The process {{consists}} of pumping a cementitous grout or polyurethane mixture through holes drilled through the slab. The grout can fill small voids beneath the slab and/or sub-base. The grout also displaces <b>free</b> <b>water</b> and helps keep water from saturating and weakening support under the joints and slab edge after stabilization is complete. The three steps for this method after finding the voids are locating and drilling holes, grout injection and post-testing the stabilized slabs.|$|E

Their distribution is apparently seasonally limited by water in some areas. In summer, greater sage-grouse in desert regions occur only near streams, springs, and water holes. In winter in Eden Valley, Wyoming, they have been observed regularly visiting partially frozen streams to drink from holes in the ice.|$|E
