40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{experimental work}} which was undertaken {{to investigate the}} buckling characteristics of axially loaded cylindrical tubes and presents a theoretical basis for analysing tube behaviour. This is a radical deflarture from the existing theories in the literature which are not supported by experimental evidence. It is shown here that the tube failure is a ‘one-way’ buckling phenomenon where buckles can appear singly or in sequence. Two basic failure modes are established. One is due to an outward movement of the tube wall which produces a ripple or bellows formation and is fundamentally a yielding phenomenon. The other is inward movement which produces diamond shaped indentations and is an elastic failure. Mainly in the latter case, the small <b>deviations</b> <b>from</b> the true <b>cylindrical</b> <b>form</b> are the critical elements in determining {{the value of the}} failure load...|$|R

40|$|Boxy/peanut bulges are {{believed}} to originate from galactic discs through secular processes. A little explored question is how this evolution would be modified if the initial disc was assembled around a preexisting classical bulge. Previously we showed that a low-mass initial classical bulge (ICB), as might have been present in Milky Way-like galaxies, can spin up significantly by gaining angular momentum from a bar formed through disc instability. Here we investigate how the disc instability and the kinematics of the final boxy/peanut (BP) bulge depend on the angular momentum of such a low-mass ICB. We show that a strong bar forms and transfers angular momentum to the ICB in all our models. However, rotation in the ICB limits the emission of the bar's angular momentum, which in turn changes the size and growth of the bar, and of the BP bulge formed from the disc. The final BP bulge in these models is a superposition of the BP bulge formed via the buckling instability and the spun-up ICB. We find that the long-term kinematics of the composite BP bulges in our simulations is independent of {{the rotation of the}} ICB, and is always described by cylindrical rotation. However, {{as a result of the}} co-evolution between bulge and bar, <b>deviations</b> <b>from</b> <b>cylindrical</b> rotation are seen during the early phases of secular evolution, and may correspond to similar deviations observed in some bulges. We provide a simple criterion to quantify <b>deviations</b> <b>from</b> pure <b>cylindrical</b> rotation, apply it to all our model bulges, and also illustrate its use for two galaxies: NGC 7332 and NGC 4570.

40|$|HR 3831 is {{a rapidly}} {{oscillating}} Ap star with a pulsational period of 11. 67 min. The amplitude of this pulsation ranges from O to about 5 mmag {{as a function}} of the rotational aspect of the star. We use 268 hr of new high-speed photometric observa­ tions obtained in 1990 and 1991 plus 238 hr of published high-speed photometry from 1980, 1981, 1985 and 1986 to show that the period of pulsation amplitude modulation is equal to the period of mean-light variation. We use this to show that an interpretation of the pulsation-amplitude modulation as rotationally perturbed m­ modes requires that Cnt≤ 2 X 10 - 5 at the 3 σ a confidence level, making that interpretation highly unlikely. We also show that the time of pulsation maximum pre­ cedes the time of mean-light extremum by 0. 177 ± 0. 007 d (0. 062 ± 0. 002 rotation periods), a 25 σ a difference. The time of magnetic extremum coincides with the time of pulsation-amplitude maximum but differs from mean-light extremum by 0. 158 ± 0. 032 d, a 5 σ difference. This argues that HR 3831 is an oblique pulsator with the magnetic axis and pulsation axis aligned, rather than a spotted pulsator with amplitude modulation caused by surface inhomogeneities. lt also indicates a <b>deviation</b> <b>from</b> <b>cylindrical</b> symmetry which makes the interpretation of the pulsation-amplitude modulation in terms of the oblique-pulsator model more complex than has yet been considered. By shifting the pulsation-amplitude variations into phase with the mean­ light variations and normalizing both data sets, we refine the rotation frequency for HR 3831 to be vrot= 0. 3506333 ± 0. 0000006 d- 1 = 4058. 256 ± 0. 007 nHz, or Prot= 2. 851982 ± 0. 000005 d...|$|R

40|$|A uniform {{asymptotic}} {{representation of}} the electromagnetic field radiated from arbitrary collinear array antennas is presented. The asymptotic field is obtained applying the saddle-point technique to the radiation integrals after expressing the current excited along the array axis {{by means of a}} Fourier spectral representation. The resulting electromagnetic field is expressed in terms of propagating and evanescent truncated Floquet Waves (FWs). The leading asymptotic term of the FWs exhibits an optical behavior and is responsible for the slow decay of the array near-field, which can be described as cylindrical in character. The transition toward the spherical wave propagation regime is due to the interference of the cylindrical field with the relevant scattered field from the array truncations, while the reactive energy storage is due to the evanescent FWs, {{as well as to the}} progressive inductive and progressive electrostatic FWs excited close the antenna axis. Using the asymptotic field representation, prediction formulas for the spatial locations where the array near-field exhibits peak <b>deviation</b> <b>from</b> the <b>cylindrical</b> decay, and where the transition <b>from</b> <b>cylindrical</b> to spherical wave propagation regime takes place, have been derived. The proposed analytical technique can be adopted to analyze the spatial field distributions and the radiation mechanisms of periodic and nonperiodic linear arrays...|$|R
40|$|We {{measure the}} {{response}} of a rotating sample of superfluid ^ 3 He-B to spin-down {{to rest in the}} zero-temperature limit. <b>Deviations</b> <b>from</b> perfect <b>cylindrical</b> symmetry in the flow environment cause the initial response to become turbulent. The remaining high polarization of vortices along the rotation axis suppresses the turbulent behavior and leads to laminar late-time response. We determine the dissipation during laminar decay at (0. 13 - 0. 22) T_c from the precession frequency of the remnant vortex cluster. We extract the mutual friction parameter α and confirm that its dependence on temperature and pressure agrees with theoretical predictions. We find that the zero-temperature extrapolation of α has pressure-independent value α(T= 0) ∼ 5 · 10 ^- 4, which we attribute to a process where Kelvin waves, excited at surfaces of the container, propagate into the bulk and enhance energy dissipation via overheating vortex core-bound fermions.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of quantized vortices is studied in superfluid 3 He-B after a rapid stop of rotation. We use Andreev reflection of thermal excitations to monitor vortex motion with quartz tuning fork oscillators {{in two different}} experimental setups at temperatures below 0. 2 Tc. <b>Deviations</b> <b>from</b> ideal <b>cylindrical</b> symmetry in the flow environment cause the early decay to become turbulent. This is identified from a rapid initial overshoot in the vortex density above the value before the spin-down and its subsequent decay with a t^(- 3 / 2) time dependence. The high polarization of the vortices along the rotation axis significantly suppresses the effective turbulent kinematic viscosity below the values reported for more homogeneous turbulence and leads to a laminar late-time response. The vortex dissipation down to T < 0. 15 Tc is determined from the precession frequency of the polarized vortex configuration. In the limit of vanishing normal component density, the laminar dissipation is found to approach a temperature-independent value, whose origin is currently under discussion.

40|$|For {{experiments}} on warm dense matter (WDM) with intense heavy ion beams aiming for precise {{determination of the}} equation of state (EOS), a detailed knowledge of target heating is essential. Previous simulations [1] with the hydrodynamic 2 D code BIG 2 showed that the heating process can be quasi-isochoric, provided the ion beam bunch is sufficiently short. Unfortunatelly these simulations are usually time-consuming and therefore are not efficient for optimising beam-target configurations. Moreover there is no posibility to {{study the effects of}} <b>deviations</b> <b>from</b> the <b>cylindrical</b> geometry on the energy density distribution in the target with 2 D codes. In order to address the above issues a 3 D Monte-Carlo code has been developed. This code allows one to obtain detailed information about the energy deposition in the target. Since hydrodynamic motion is neglected, it is possible to study and optimize the target heating in a fast and flexible way. Ion beams with gaussian distributions in the transverse phase-space and elliptical cross-sections are generated using functions from the ccmath library [2]. Cylindrically shaped targets with arbitrary spatial orientation to the beam can be considered. For present simulations stopping data generated by the SRIM [3] code has been used. ...|$|R
40|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNT) {{are potentially}} promising fibers for ultra high strength composites. In order to fully har-ness the outstanding mechanical properties of carbon nanotubes as fiber reinforcements, {{it is essential}} {{to understand the nature of}} load transfer between fiber and matrix under various types of loading conditions that include tension, compression, torsion and a combination thereof. In this paper, we study the compressive behavior (buckling and post-buckling) of carbon nanotubes in the neat form, when they are embedded in polyethylene matrix and with in¬terface chemical modifications using molecular dynamics simulations based on Tersoff–Brenner potential. It is ob¬served that the critical load for buckling increases only very marginally for nanotubes embedded in polythene matrix (with non-bonded interface) compared to neat CNTs. When CNTs are chemically bonded to the matrix, the compres¬sive behavior occurs in two phases; pre- and post-buckling phases. First, the critical stress for buckling is found to re¬duce because the change in chemical bonding induces <b>deviation</b> <b>from</b> perfect <b>cylindrical</b> structure.

40|$|This text {{presents}} a {{design of a}} device {{to be used for}} scanning gas pipeline external surface damaged by water corrosion. The corrosion defects appears when a protection on pipeline is damaged. Water than can infiltrate on a metal surface and cause corrosion. An area of these defects is from square centimetres to square decimetres. These defects have shape as different deep pits. The pits depth can achieve fifty percent of pipeline wall thickness. The defects are searched by ultrasonic sensing head on mobile devices, which goes through pipeline. It can only find the defects, but it cannot define accurate extent and shape of the defects. Then the pipeline must be uncovered on places with defects and cleaned. Our device provides a 3 D-map of the scanned surface {{in the form of the}} defect surface <b>deviation</b> <b>from</b> an ideal <b>cylindrical</b> shape. These 3 D-map data obtained serve as input data for the remaining carrying capacity assessment of the pipeline by means of the finite element method (FEM). The device applies a polar co-ordinate system that seems to be the most suitable one for this task. A relatively small mass of the device, together with its battery feeding, enables an easy manipulation in field conditions. The device is able to operate when being attached in any position on the pipe surface. The area scanned by the apparatus can in maximum reach 550 x 300 mm in the longitudinal and circumferential pipe directions, respectively. If a larger area of a pipe defect is to be scanned it is possible to connect more sections alongside. In order to achieve a sufficient measuring speed, e. g., 70 points per minute, the device operation is based on contact-less optical measuring methods. When using a short measuring step of 1 mm, as many as 165 000 scanned points are attained in 40 minutes. The device can scan tubes with diameter from 500 mm to 1400 mm. The measuring method is optical triangulation. A narrow light beam from semiconductor laser with collimating lens is projected perpendicularly to the surface. A small light spot is made on measuring tube. A disperse light from this spot is projected by lens to the light detector. it is possible to transfer a position of the spot image on the detector to the surface distance from the sensing head. As light detector we used position sensitive diode (PSD). The optical sensing head is moved above pipeline surface in two directions. One direction is longitudinal in line and second direction is along arc to keep the sensing head in suitable distance <b>from</b> <b>cylindrical</b> surface. A computer provides control and setting of the device. Software collects data from the device and converts it to the applicable form for the following analysis.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the influence of}} the pulse duration on the laser drilling process in the femtosecond, picosecond and nanosecond regime by in-situ imaging of the hole formation in silicon for pulse energies from 25 µJ to 500 µJ. For percussion drilling, we used a Ti:Sa CPA laser system that provides pulses with a duration of 50 fs up to 10 ns at 800 nm. At this wavelength, silicon shows linear absorption and its ablation behavior is comparable to metals. The temporal evolution of the longitudinal silhouette of the hole was visualized during the drilling progress. Deep holes with a depth larger than 1 mm and aspect ratios up to 30 : 1 were generated. In terms of maximum achievable depth, ultrashort pulses with a duration below 5 ps show comparable efficiency for pulse energies below 100 µJ, while ns-pulses only lead to shallow depths. The situation changes for pulse energies higher than 100 µJ. The depth of holes drilled with ns-pulses increases linearly with pulse energy, while ultrashort pulses show a saturation of achievable depth, which is most distinctive for the shortest pulse duration of 50 fs. The increase in depth for ns-pulses is accompanied by an increasing number of pulses required to reach this depth, which can be 10 times as much as for ultrashort pulses at the same pulse energy. The drilling process consists of an iterative sequence of forward drilling and increase of hole diameter. The increase in diameter leads to numerous <b>deviations</b> <b>from</b> a <b>cylindrical</b> hole shape in the form of bulges, cavities and finger-like structures.

The combination of a suitably chosen electrolyte/template system with pulse-reverse electrodeposition allows the formation of well-defined segments linked to nanowires. Manipulation of the morphology is obtained by controlling the electrokinetie effects on the local electrolyte distribution inside the nanochannels during the nanowire growth process, allowing a <b>deviation</b> <b>from</b> the continuously <b>cylindrical</b> geometry given by the nanoporous template. The length of the segments can be adjusted {{as a function of}} the cathodic pulse duration. Applying constant pulses leads to segments with homogeneous shape and dimensions along most of the total wire length. X-ray diffraction demonstrates that the preferred crystallite orientation of the polycrystalline wires varies with the average segment length. The results are explained considering transitions in texture formation with increasing thickness of the electrodeposit. A mechanism of segment formation is proposed based on structural characterizations. Nanowires with controlled segmented morphology are of great technological importance, because of the possibility to precisely control their substructure as a means of tuning their electrical, thermal, and optical properties.
