50|$|In 1930, {{two major}} {{categories}} of H. influenzae were defined: the unencapsulated strains and the encapsulated strains. Encapsulated strains were classified {{on the basis}} of their distinct capsular antigens. There are six generally recognized types of encapsulated H. influenzae: a, b, c, d, e, and f.Genetic diversity among unencapsulated strains is greater than within the encapsulated group. Unencapsulated strains are termed nontypable (NTHi) because they lack capsular serotypes; however, they can be classified by multilocus sequence typing. The pathogenesis of H. influenzae infections is not completely understood, although the presence of the capsule in <b>encapsulated</b> <b>type</b> b (Hib), a serotype causing conditions such as epiglottitis, is known to be a major factor in virulence. Their capsule allows them to resist phagocytosis and complement-mediated lysis in the nonimmune host. The unencapsulated strains are almost always less invasive; they can, however, produce an inflammatory response in humans, which can lead to many symptoms. Vaccination with Hib conjugate vaccine is effective in preventing Hib infection, but does not prevent infection with NTHi strains.|$|E

Using an in vitro assay, we compared the opsonic requirements for phagocytic killing of prototype strains of <b>encapsulated</b> (<b>type</b> 1) and microencapsulated (type 5 and type 8) S. aureus by human PMNs. More than 85 % of broth-grown, logarithmic-phase type 5 and 8 S. aureus organisms were killed by PMNs incubated with fresh normal human, rabbit, or guinea pig serum with complement activity. Under similar conditions, the highly <b>encapsulated</b> <b>type</b> 1 strain was not killed. Both encapsulated and microencapsulated strains were opsonized for phagocytosis by heat-inactivated serum raised in rabbits to killed bacteria. Opsonization by homologous serum was required for phagocytosis of the type 1 strain. In contrast, microencapsulated type 5 and 8 S. aureus organisms were killed by heat-inactivated rabbit serum raised to type 5, type 8, or nonencapsulated isolates; this result suggested that antibodies to the capsule or to cell wall components other than the capsule could opsonize these organisms for phagocytosis. The specificity of the assay was confirmed with capsule type 5 -specific monoclonal antibodies, which were opsonic only for the type 5 S. aureus isolate. These studies indicate that, unlike the highly <b>encapsulated</b> <b>type</b> 1 strain, broth-grown microencapsulated S. aureus strains do not resist opsonophagocytic killing in vitro by normal serum...|$|E

40|$|Generics has {{recently}} been adopted to many mainstream object oriented languages, such as C# and Java. As a particular design choice, generics in C# and Java use a sub-typing relation to constraint type parameters. Failing to <b>encapsulate</b> <b>type</b> parameters within generic interfaces and inability to <b>encapsulate</b> <b>type</b> constraints {{as part of an}} interface definition have been identified as deficiencies in the way this design choice has been implemented in these languages. These deficiencies can lead to verbose and redundant code. In particular, they have been reported to affect the development of highly generic libraries. To address these issues, extending object oriented interfaces and sub-typing with associated types and constraint propagation has been proposed and studied in an idealized small-scale formal setting.

Twelve hours after intracisternal inoculation of an <b>encapsulated</b> <b>type</b> 3 Streptococcus pneumoniae strain, body temperature was manipulated by using two different anesthetic drugs: pentobarbital, which did not affect temperature, and urethane, which mitigated the febrile response to infection. Growth rates of pneumococci in cerebrospinal fluid were dramatically influenced by modification of the febrile response. Rabbits whose fever was not suppressed had mean bacterial doubling times of 2. 76 +/- 1. 43 h. Animals with a blunted febrile response had a significantly faster mean bacterial growth rate (doubling time = 1. 10 +/- 0. 27 h; P less than 0. 02). When the antipyretic effect of urethane was counteracted by raising the ambient temperature, animals also showed a marked reduction in pneumococcal growth rates. In vitro, the pneumococci grew well at 37 degrees C in Trypticase soy broth (doubling time = 0. 61 +/- 0. 05 h) and in pooled rabbit cerebrospinal fluid (doubling time = 0. 85 +/- 0. 07 h).

While antibodies directed to the type-specific GBS capsule {{have been shown to be}} protective, it is less clear whether antibodies to the group B polysaccharide, a noncapsular, cell wall-associated antigen, may play a role in immunity. To investigate the functional activity of group B polysaccharide-specific antibodies, we tested sera from rabbits vaccinated with group B polysaccharide coupled to tetanus toxoid (B-TT). Anti-B-TT was weakly opsonic in vitro for a highly <b>encapsulated</b> <b>type</b> III strain, while antiserum elicited by vaccination with type III capsular polysaccharide linked to tetanus toxoid (III-TT) was a very effective opsonin. In contrast to anti-III-TT, anti-B-TT given before or after bacterial challenge was only marginally effective in protecting newborn mice against lethal infection with type III GBS. The number of C 3 molecules bound to type III GBS was augmented by anti-III-TT but not by high antibody concentrations of anti-B-TT. These results suggest that the difference in opsonic activity between anti-B-TT and anti-III-TT may be due to a difference in their ability to deposit C 3. In addition, the maximum number of antibody molecules bound to the bacterial surface was greater for anti-III-TT than for anti-B-TT.

40|$|Expression of capsular {{polysaccharide}} (CPS) and some surface proteins by group B Streptococcus (GBS) is regulated by growth rate. We hypothesized that precise control of GBS growth, and thus surface-expressed components, could modulate {{the ability of}} GBS to invade eukaryotic cells. To test this hypothesis, a dynamic in vitro attachment and invasion system (DIVAS) was developed that combines the advantages of bacterial growth in continuous culture with tissue culture. Tissue culture flasks were modified with inlet and outlet ports to permit perfusion of GBS. <b>Encapsulated</b> <b>type</b> III GBS strains M 781 and COH 1 and strains COH 1 - 11 and COH 1 - 13 (transposon mutants of COH 1 that express an asialo CPS or are acapsular, respectively) were grown in continuous culture in a chemically defined medium at fast mass doubling time (td = 1. 8 h) and slow (td = 11 h) growth rates, conditions previously shown to induce and repress, respectively, type III CPS expression. Encapsulated GBS strains invaded A 549 respiratory epithelial cells 20 - to 700 -fold better at the fast than at the slow growth rate, suggesting a role for CPS. However, unencapsulated GBS were also invasive but only when cultured at the fast growth rate, which indicates that GBS invasion is independent of CPS expression and can be regulated by growth rate. Growth rate-dependent invasion occurred when GBS was grown in continuous culture under glucose-defined, thiamine-defined, and nondefined nutrient limitations. These results suggest a growth rate-dependent regulation of GBS pathogenesis and demonstrate the usefulness of DIVAS as a tool in studies of host–microbe interactions...|$|E

The hmw genes were significantly more prevalent among middle ear than throat isolates, while hia did not segregate with a respiratory tract site.

40|$|The {{observations}} {{recorded in}} this paper on the infectivity of Type III pneumococci for rabbits may be summarized as follows: 1. Of eleven strains of Type III isolated from human sources, ten were found to possess low virulence for rabbits. This was true {{despite the fact that}} all the strains tested possessed large capsules and a high degree of virulence for mice. 2. One strain of Type III pneumococcus was rendered highly virulent for rabbits. Since it possessed no other biological property demonstrably different from the other strains, its virulence must reside in some additional property. 3. An initial {{decrease in the number of}} circulating organisms following the injection of virulent bacteria is a well known occurrence, and it was observed in rabbits injected with the rabbit virulent strain of Type III. However, the extent of the reduction was in inverse proportion to the degree of virulence of the strain; a fact which makes mechanical explanations of the phenomenon insufficient. 4. The bacteremia produced in rabbits by Type III pneumococci, avirulent for this species, runs a characteristic course. It differs from that produced by non-encapsulated R forms of pneumococci although in both instances survival of the infected animal ensues. This is evidence that the mechanism of resistance against encapsulated and non-encapsulated pneumococci is not identical. 5. Phagocytosis of Type III pneumococci by circulating rabbit leucocytes was not demonstrable by a vital stain technique, whereas under the same conditions the ingestion of non-encapsulated R forms occurred. This is further evidence that the process whereby non-encapsulated pneumococci are disposed of, is insufficient to explain the natural resistance of rabbits to infection with <b>encapsulated</b> <b>Type</b> III pneumococci...|$|E

Using this data, an approximate method of calculating the peak-to-total ratio of other composite detectors, is shown. Experimental validation of our approach (for energies up to 8 MeV) has been confirmed considering the data of the SPI spectrometer.

40|$|The major {{virulence}} {{determinant of}} group A streptococci {{is the ability}} to resist opsonization and phagocytic ingestion. The present studies were performed to compare the mechanisms of resistance to opsonization of type 18 and type 24 streptococci and to determine the relative roles of M protein-fibrinogen interaction and the hyaluronate capsule in preventing phagocytic ingestion and killing. By use of parent strains and acapsular transposon mutants in the presence and absence of fibrinogen, we show that type 18 and type 24 streptococci rely on somewhat different mechanisms for resistance to opsonization. Type 24 streptococci bound fibrinogen avidly to their surfaces, and encapsulated organisms were completely resistant to opsonization only in the presence of fibrinogen. In contrast, type 18 streptococci bound 10 -fold less fibrinogen than type 24 streptococci and were fully resistant to phagocytosis only when they expressed capsule. The general structural characteristics of the amino-terminal halves of type 18 and type 24 M proteins differed in that type 18 M protein contained only one complete B repeat, whereas type 24 M protein contained five complete B repeats, a structural difference which could potentially be related to the differences in fibrinogen binding between the two serotypes.
