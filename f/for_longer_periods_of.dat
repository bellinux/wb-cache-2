5|$|Oddfellows is {{the fourth}} studio album by musical {{supergroup}} Tomahawk. The album {{is the first to}} feature new bass player Trevor Dunn, who has replaced previous member Kevin Rutmanis. Oddfellows was recorded live in the Easy Eye Sound Studio in Nashville, Tennessee, after a brief period of rehearsal. Guitarist Duane Denison favored the location as its cheaper studio costs allowed <b>for</b> <b>longer</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> song-writing.|$|E
5|$|Artificial {{lighting}} {{of any sort}} was largely absent during the industrial development of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Using candles or oil lamps to illuminate a textile factory was costly, and economically unsound. With the advent of industrial means of production, not only were new textile halls physically larger, but they also had to be lit more brightly <b>for</b> <b>longer</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> time. Driven by great demand, and made possible through Lavoisier's theoretical work regarding the role of oxygen in combustion, {{the end of the}} 18th century saw a continuous series of improvements in lighting technology.|$|E

5|$|The {{underlying}} bedrock or limestone of the Everglades basin {{affects the}} hydroperiod, {{or how long}} an area within the region stays flooded throughout the year. Longer hydroperiods are possible in areas that were submerged beneath seawater <b>for</b> <b>longer</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> time, while the geology of Florida was forming. More water is held within the porous ooids and limestone than older types of rock that spent more time above sea level. A hydroperiod of ten months or more fosters growth of sawgrass, whereas a shorter hydroperiod of six months or less promotes beds of periphyton, a growth of algae and other microscopic organisms. There are only two types of soil in the Everglades, peat and marl. Where there are longer hydroperiods, peat builds up over {{hundreds or thousands of}} years due to many generations of decaying plant matter. Where periphyton grows, the soil develops into marl, which is more calcitic in composition.|$|E
25|$|As the HIV/AIDS {{epidemic}} {{entered the}} 21st Century, WWC {{was faced with}} a changing epidemic and difficult decisions. With improved medical treatment, HIV/AIDS patients began to live longer and required more services <b>for</b> <b>longer</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> time. This change put an additional financial strain on the Clinic as it continued providing services to a growing patient base.|$|E
25|$|Due to copper’s strong {{antimicrobial}} properties, copper fins can inhibit bacterial, fungal and viral growths that commonly {{build up}} in air conditioning systems. Hence, the surfaces of copper-based heat exchangers are cleaner <b>for</b> <b>longer</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> time than heat exchangers made from other metals. This benefit offers a greatly expanded heat exchanger service life and contributes to improved air quality.|$|E
50|$|Membrane {{relaxation}} {{consists of}} pausing the filtration during a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time, and thus, {{there is no}} need for permeate flow reversion.

25|$|During {{the course}} of his long reign, Emperor Franz Joseph stayed at the Hofburg in Innsbruck on {{numerous}} occasions. Empress Elisabeth of Austria, however, stayed overnight at the Hofburg only once, on 14–15 October 1871. Other Habsburg archdukes, Franz Josef's uncle Ferdinand Karl (1818–1874), cousin Eugen (1863–1954), and nephew Heinrich Ferdinand (1878–1969) stayed <b>for</b> <b>longer</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> time at the Hofburg imperial apartments during {{the late nineteenth and early}} twentieth century.|$|E

25|$|Benzodiazepines such as {{clonazepam}} can be {{very effective}} in controlling status epilepticus, but, when used <b>for</b> <b>longer</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> time, some potentially serious side-effects may develop, such as interference with cognitive functions and behavior. Many individuals treated on a long-term basis develop a dependence. Physiological dependence was demonstrated by flumazenil-precipitated withdrawal. Use of alcohol or other CNS depressants while taking clonazepam greatly intensifies the effects (and side-effects) of the drug.|$|E
25|$|The {{city also}} has {{numerous}} hotels, including the ultra-luxurious Town House Galleria, {{which is the}} world's first seven-star hotel according to Société Générale de Surveillance (five-star superior luxury according to state law, however) and one of The Leading Hotels of the World. The average stay for a tourist in the city is of 3.43 nights, whilst foreigners stay <b>for</b> <b>longer</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> time, 77% of which stay for a 2-5 night average.|$|E
25|$|Also, a MTBF only {{includes}} operational hours. It {{is considered}} that turning a tube {{on or off}} does not contribute to reducing overall lifespan, so many civilians tend to turn their night vision equipment on only when they need to, {{to make the most}} of the tube's life.

25|$|On April 17, 1864, General Ulysses S. Grant {{canceled}} all prisoner exchange {{negotiations and}} {{said they would not}} resume unless they included black Union prisoners held by Confederates. This led to a several months-long impasse in prisoner exchanges until shortly after negotiations were resumed on January 21, 1865. Both Union and Confederate armies had to house many additional prisoners <b>for</b> <b>longer</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> time than in the past.

25|$|T. gondii-infected rodents show {{a number}} of {{behavioral}} changes beyond altered responses to cat odors. Rats infected with the parasite show increased levels of activity and decreased neophobic behavior. Similarly, infected mice show alterations in patterns of locomotion and exploratory behavior during experimental tests. These patterns include traveling greater distances, moving at higher speeds, accelerating <b>for</b> <b>longer</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> time, and showing a decreased pause-time when placed in new arenas. Infected rodents have {{also been shown to}} have lower anxiety, using traditional models such as elevated plus mazes, open field arenas, and social interaction tests.|$|E
25|$|Calling is an energetically {{expensive}} activity, requiring {{high levels}} of aerobic respiration. Selection favors the most efficient call production, a good quality call that does not require {{high levels of}} energy. allowing a male frog {{to be able to}} call continuously for females. Dendropsophus microcephalus, a small tree frog, will produce 100 notes per minute for several hours, requiring up to 25 times more oxygen. Some frogs produce less energetic calls and remain in chorus <b>for</b> <b>longer</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> time with the ability to remain active longer being better for mating success than a higher energy vocal display.|$|E

The mizugumo was featured on the show MythBusters, where it was demonstrated unfit for walking on water. The ukidari, a similar footwear for walking on water, also existed {{in the form of a}} round bucket, but was probably quite unstable. Inflatable skins and breathing tubes allowed the ninja to stay underwater <b>for</b> <b>longer</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> time.|$|E

25|$|Contact beds were tanks {{containing}} the inert substance, such as stones or slate, that maximized {{the surface area}} available for the microbial growth {{to break down the}} sewage. The sewage was held in the tank until it was fully decomposed and it was then filtered out into the ground. This method quickly became widespread, especially in the UK, where it was used in Leicester, Sheffield, Manchester and Leeds. The bacterial bed was simultaneously developed by Joseph Corbett as Borough Engineer in Salford and experiments in 1905 showed that his method was superior in that greater volumes of sewage could be purified better <b>for</b> <b>longer</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> time than could be achieved by the contact bed.|$|E
