50|$|To Nietzsche {{everything}} in this world {{is an expression of}} will to power. To exist is to represent will to power, to cause influence (compare similar views of Protagoras' disciples in Plato's Theaetetus). One can cause influence only on something that exists. Therefore, (through induction) an act changes everything from that moment onwards. If one thing <b>was</b> <b>otherwise,</b> everything would have to <b>be</b> <b>otherwise</b> (and generally also backwards). Contrary to Chesterton's views, this general rule is not precluded even by absolute chances: they of course change the course of the world too, but still: if one thing <b>was</b> set <b>otherwise,</b> everything would have to <b>be</b> <b>otherwise.</b>|$|R

5|$|Although {{the writing}} of unit names is language-specific, {{the writing of}} unit symbols and the values of {{quantities}} is consistent across all languages and therefore the SI Brochure has specific rules in respect of writing them.

5|$|Eilífr Goðrúnarson's Christianity-influenced {{account of}} Urðarbrunnr (section 52 of Skáldskaparmál) {{associates}} the {{well with the}} south and Rome. Theories have been proposed that this description may have some relation to notions of the Jordan River due to phonetic and typological similarities perceived by Eilífr, though {{there may be no}} other causative connection. Eilífr <b>is</b> <b>otherwise</b> known as a pagan skald, and this selection has been theorized as describing that, due to directly associating Christ with the well, Christ had taken over responsibility of providence or fate.|$|E

Other areas that are suitable for solar cells are lands that are not being used for businesses where solar plants can be established.|$|E
