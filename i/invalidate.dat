5|$|In Yong Vui Kong v.

The former <b>invalidate</b> legislation on the ground of unconstitutionality and can only be altered by amending the Constitution, while the latter <b>invalidate</b> administrative decisions on the ground of administrative law principles and can be abrogated or disapplied by ordinary legislation.|$|E

5|$|Additionally, {{critics have}} noted the {{similarity}} between Qwak! and the 1984 Nintendo light gun game for the Nintendo Entertainment System titled Duck Hunt. Nintendo used that similarity in a 1986 court case attempting to <b>invalidate</b> a patent held by Sanders Associates; the patent, filed by Ralph Baer, was for the light gun peripheral used in the Magnavox Odyssey light gun game and held to be infringed on by Duck Hunt. Nintendo unsuccessfully claimed that Baer had based his patent {{not only on the}} Odyssey work but also on Qwak! as seen by him at the 1974 MOA show.|$|E
5|$|Fettering of {{discretion}} {{by a public}} authority {{is one of the}} grounds of judicial review in Singapore administrative law. It is regarded as a form of illegality. An applicant may challenge a decision by an authority on the basis that it has either rigidly adhered to a policy it has formulated, or has wrongfully delegated the exercise of its statutory powers to another body. If the High Court finds that a decision-maker has fettered its discretion, it may hold the decision to be ultra vires – beyond the decision-maker's powers – and grant the applicant a suitable remedy such as a quashing order to <b>invalidate</b> the decision.|$|E

5|$|The Moon {{has long}} been {{associated}} with insanity and irrationality; the words lunacy and lunatic (popular shortening loony) are derived from the Latin name for the Moon, Luna. Philosophers Aristotle and Pliny the Elder argued that the full moon induced insanity in susceptible individuals, believing that the brain, which is mostly water, must {{be affected by the}} Moon and its power over the tides, but the Moon's gravity is too slight to affect any single person. Even today, people who believe in a lunar effect claim that admissions to psychiatric hospitals, traffic accidents, homicides or suicides increase during a full moon, but dozens of studies <b>invalidate</b> these claims.|$|E
5|$|The broad {{heading of}} {{illegality}} may {{be divided into}} two sub-headings. In the first case, the High Court inquires into whether the public authority was empowered to take a particular course of action or make a decision, and, in the other, whether it exercised its discretion wrongly even though it was empowered to act. Where the Court finds that the public authority had exceeded its jurisdiction or had exercised its discretion wrongly, it may <b>invalidate</b> the act or decision.|$|E
5|$|Though {{based on}} a technicality, the Blyew case set a {{precedent}} {{in state and federal}} courts that led to the erosion of Congress's Thirteenth Amendment powers. The Supreme Court continued along this path in the Slaughter-House Cases (1873), which upheld a state-sanctioned monopoly of white butchers. In United States v. Cruikshank (1876), the Court ignored Thirteenth Amendment dicta from a circuit court decision to exonerate perpetrators of the Colfax massacre and <b>invalidate</b> the Enforcement Act of 1870.|$|E

5|$|An incensed Democratic {{majority}} in the Kentucky General Assembly created a committee to investigate the charges of voter fraud, even as armed citizens from heavily Republican eastern Kentucky poured into the state capital under auspices of keeping Democrats from stealing the election. Before the investigative committee could report, Goebel was shot by an unknown assassin while entering the state capitol on January 30, 1900. As Goebel lay in a nearby hotel being treated for his wounds, the committee issued its report recommending that the General Assembly <b>invalidate</b> enough votes to give the election to Goebel. The report was accepted, Taylor was deposed, and Goebel was sworn into office on January 31. He died three days later on February 2.|$|E
5|$|For all {{the claims}} about the {{potential}} for violence, election day, November 7, remained mostly calm across the state. Fewer than a dozen people were arrested statewide. Voting returns were slow, and on election night, the race was still too close to call. When the official tally was announced, Taylor had won by a vote of 193,714 to 191,331. Former governor John Y. Brown, nominated by a dissident group of Democrats, had garnered 12,040 votes, and Populist candidate John G. Blair had captured 2,936. Though the Board of Elections was thought to be controlled by Goebel, it rendered a surprise 2–1 decision to certify the election results. The board's majority opinion claimed {{that they did not have}} any judicial power and were thus unable to hear proof or swear witnesses, leaving them without grounds to <b>invalidate</b> any votes. Taylor was inaugurated on December 12, 1899.|$|E
5|$|Jeffrey Jowell proposes two {{justifications}} for limiting parliamentary sovereignty: legitimacy {{and the current}} hypothesis of constitutionalism. The argument from legitimacy highlights that Parliament's supremacy depends on the democratic and accountable nature of legislature; anything that undermines this status would <b>invalidate</b> {{the applicability of the}} doctrine. Jowell suggests that this view was expressly supported by Lord Hope and impliedly supported in other opinions that legislation limiting Parliament's accountability would be challenged by the judiciary. The argument based on the current hypothesis of constitutionalism reasons that no authority should be allowed to violate fundamental rights in a democratic society: they are essential features that cannot be removed, even by a supposedly sovereign Parliament. This view was also expressly endorsed in Jackson by Lord Hope, who regarded Parliament's sovereignty as subject to the rule of law.|$|E

5|$|The {{possible}} inconsistencies {{the subjective}} test had {{with respect to}} Articles12 and 93 of the Constitution were sought to be resolved {{with the passing of}} the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Act 1989. Article149(1) was amended to shield any anti-subversion laws enacted pursuant to this provision from inconsistency with Articles11 and 12. This was in addition to Articles 9, 13 and 14 which had already been present in Article149(1) before the amendment. Furthermore, a new Article149(3) provided that nothing in Article93 would <b>invalidate</b> any provisions that were enacted pursuant to Article149. Hence, the ruling in Chng Suan Tze that the subjective test was inconsistent with the Constitution was legislatively reversed, and the subjective test was restored as the valid and relevant law in Singapore.|$|E
5|$|Under {{administrative}} law, {{judicial review}} {{is an exercise}} in which the High Court scrutinizes the executive's decisions and orders to ensure that they conform with the law. If the decisions and orders are not authorized by statute or if they have been made in contravention of administrative law principles, the Court can <b>invalidate</b> them. Similarly, if any exercise of power by an executive body contravenes the Constitution, the Court has a duty to declare it invalid. With regards to the ISA and the powers to detain without trial, the scope of judicial review was subject to a succession of changes between 1988 and 1990. These changes revolved around the issue of whether the discretion of the President and the Home Affairs Minister should be assessed objectively or subjectively. During that period, the scope of judicial review was expanded by common law developments but was subsequently curtailed by legislative and constitutional amendments.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{few times}} a federal court was asked to <b>invalidate</b> a law or action on Third Amendment grounds was in Engblom v. Carey (1982). In 1979, prison {{officials}} in New York organized a strike; they were evicted from their prison facility residences, which were reassigned to members of the National Guard who had temporarily taken their place as prison guards. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled: (1) that the term owner in the Third Amendment includes tenants (paralleling similar cases regarding the Fourth Amendment, governing search and seizure), (2) National Guard troops count as soldiers {{for the purposes of the}} Third Amendment, and (3) that the Third Amendment is incorporated (that is, that it applies to the states) by virtue of the Fourteenth Amendment. The case was remanded to the district court, which dismissed the case on the grounds that state officials could not have been aware of this interpretation.|$|E
