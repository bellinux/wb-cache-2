40|$|Hoogovens Steel (HS) is a {{vertically}} integrated steel company, which until 1995 was functionally structured. During {{the eighties}} the steel market became saturated and more heterogeneous. In order {{to remain a}} flexible, market-oriented company, HS changed its organizational structure, by introducing business units {{responsible for their own}} financial results. Nevertheless, it remained a vertically integrated steel producer. With the functional structure HS had used cost-based transfer prices. But following the introduction of the business units the question was raised as to whether the transfer pricing system should be changed. A business unit structure implies a decentralization of authority and the delegation of certain activities to the units, but vertically integrated production requires close relations between the various stages. This paper discusses {{the extent to which the}} tensions between decentralization and integration can be resolved through the coordination of <b>internal</b> <b>transactions.</b> After introducing the relevant theoretical concepts, the issues which emerged in discussions about the coordination of <b>internal</b> <b>transactions</b> at HS are discussed.

40|$|The {{theory of}} the firm was {{originally}} motivated by the belief that transactions were organized differently within firms compared to between them. We have learned much from recent research about when firms choose to integrate transactions. However, we still {{know very little about}} how these integration decisions affect the way that transactions are managed. I address this question by carrying out a detailed comparison of the governance of internal and outsourced Information Technology (IT) projects at a large financial services institution. Much of the {{theory of the}} firm has argued that firms are able to exercise more control over <b>internal</b> <b>transactions</b> through the exercise of authority or asset decision rights. However, I find that clients often exercise extensive authority over outsourced projects as well as internal projects. Instead, I find that the key differences between <b>internal</b> and external <b>transactions</b> are in how the organization shapes the context in which employees interact inside the firm, through regulating the terms of <b>internal</b> <b>transactions</b> and the centralization of all income rights. Specifically, I find that where outsourced projects are usually governed by a variety of incentive provisions, managers cannot use such provisions for internal projects. In addition, the residual returns from the project are assigned differently for internal and outsourced projects. These findings suggest that the theory of the firm should {{pay more attention to the}} regulation of “horizontal ” transactions between employees and the role of residual income rights in understanding firm boundaries...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - The study aims {{to add to}} the {{knowledge}} of governance and control aspects of intrafirm relationships by exploring a transaction costs economics perspective (TCE perspective) on governance and management control structure choices related {{to the development of a}} shared service center (SSC). - Design/methodology/approach - The notion of governance and control in SSC organizations is explored and a TCE model is developed to analyze management control structure choices for SSC governance. The nature of <b>internal</b> <b>transactions</b> is related to the dimensions of transactions. Then an example case study is used to illustrate the application of the theoretical model. - Findings - The theoretical analysis broadens existing frameworks of management control structures by particularly pointing to the possibility of including governance structures for <b>internal</b> <b>transactions</b> and exit threats (connected to a market mechanism) in the management control structure of an organization. Confrontation with the case example illustrates that the possibility of an exit threat was not explicitly considered by top management (“the designer” of management control). Although the TCE model may be a useful tool for analysis purposes, it has little explanatory power in this particular case. Organizational change processes toward SSCs are complex and can only partly be examined with conventional economics-based approaches such as TCE. - Research limitations/implications - Governance and control of SSCs is conceptually theorized, using an instrumental economics approach. The case study is not generalizable but illustrates the use of the model in a particular situation. To understand governance and control change within SSC organizations, more longitudinal case studies are needed. - Practical implications - A TCE approach to governance and control choices regarding SSCs might provide practitioners with insights into the efficiency of specific management control structures. - Originality/value - This chapter contributes to the extant knowledge by both exploring and challenging a TCE perspective on SSC-related changes in management control...|$|R

40|$|The {{question}} of {{the management of the}} transfer process and transfer pricing is an important one for managers and academics alike (Colbert and Spicer, 1995). Yet, in general, our current knowledge on several aspects of transfer pricing process is limited. One question which arises in relation to transfer pricing in service organizations is whether there is an association between the transfer price and the internal customer&# 039;s perception of value emanating from the transaction. An inappropriate transfer pricing system can give rise to a number of adverse effects which can include among other things, maldistribution of economic resources, negative motivation for reducing costs (Lesser, 1987), lack of goal congruence and inequitable performance evaluation (Cravens and Shearon, 1997). The gap in the literature on transfer pricing in the service sector applies equally in the Australian setting. This is despite the significant and increasing contribution of the service sector to both GDP and employment. The objective of this research is to explore the domestic transfer pricing practices of service organisations in Australia with the emphasis placed on examining whether, in <b>internal</b> <b>transactions,</b> the domestic transfer price had any influence on the value perceived by the internal buyer. Because the extant transfer pricing theories cannot explain the value perceived by the internal customer in internal exchange of goods and services, an exploratory research methodology is adopted and no assumptions are made about the relationship. PDF created with pdfFactory trial version www. pdffactory. com 3 Data were gathered from survey responses from eighty service organisations and thirteen face-to-face interviews. Survey data were sought at two levels. Questions of a strategic nature were directed to corporate management while questions pertinent to transfer pricing and value were sought from the divisional management who are actually involved in such transfers. Exploratory factor analysis was used to analyze the data. The findings indicate that cost-based transfer pricing was the most preferred method, and in <b>internal</b> <b>transactions,</b> and responsiveness of the internal supplier was the key factor for internal buyers. The research found that service organisations are external customer oriented and internal customer issues are secondary. The research results also demonstrate that no significant association exists between transfer pricing and internal customer perceived value. The current research contributes to the transfer pricing literature by providing insights to locus of transfer pricing decisions, transfer pricing methods employed by service organizations in Australia, objectives of transfer pricing systems, conflicts arising during from the transfer pricing process and the role of transfer prices on the value perceived by internal customers. As a research topic, this study is pioneering as it integrates for the first time, the constructs of transfer price and value in <b>internal</b> <b>transactions.</b> Another unique feature of this research is that it was carried out in another important but under-researched context of service organisations...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the continuing importance of borders, {{even within the}} EU, for the volume {{of international trade and}} global capital flows. It suggests that a range of factors, including the nature of the commercial, social and legal fabric of a country and the structure of consumers' preferences, act to constrain cross-border exchanges relative to <b>internal</b> <b>transactions.</b> Hence, whilst the process of globalisation may continue, there are likely to be distinct limits to the extent of economic integration. This entails that the traditional roles of governments in OECD countries in providing social welfare and regulating the market economy within national boundaries will not be seriously undermined. However, the situation may differ in developing countries where existing social and legal institutions may be compromised by globalisation rather than acting to dampen its impact...|$|R
50|$|The {{question}} then arises of what determines {{the size of}} the firm; why does the entrepreneur organise the transactions he does, why no more or less? Since the reason for the firm's being is to have lower costs than the market, the upper limit on the firm's size is set by costs rising to the point where internalising an additional transaction equals the cost of making that transaction in the market. (At the lower limit, the firm’s costs exceed the market’s costs, and it does not come into existence.) In practice, diminishing returns to management contribute most to raising the costs of organising a large firm, particularly in large firms with many different plants and differing <b>internal</b> <b>transactions</b> (such as a conglomerate), or if the relevant prices change frequently.|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{importance of}} mergers {{for the growth}} strategies of corporations, multinational in particular, gives rise to questions about the motives for the choice of such strategy. Traditionally, mergers have been explained by economies of scale, increases in operational effectiveness, beneficial results of <b>internal</b> <b>transactions,</b> and the synergetic effect flowing from complementaiy resources. It seems, however, that the foregoing motives do not fully explain the contemporary wave of mergers. The author attempts at linking the development of merger strategies with a certain chain of interdependent phenomena, for which competition is the propelling force. Further, she analyzes the impact of merger strategies on the market structure and corporate behaviour, and suggests a need to make mergers subject to stricter antitrust scrutiny than currently in force.

40|$|Multidivisional firms {{frequently}} rely {{on external}} market prices {{in order to}} value <b>internal</b> <b>transactions</b> across profit centers. This paper examines market-based transfer pricing when an upstream division has monopoly power in selling a proprietary component both to a downstream division within the same firm and to external customers. When internal transfers are valued at the prevailing market price, the resulting transactions are distorted by double marginalization. The imposition of intracompany discounts will always improve overall firm profits provided the supplying division is capacity constrained. Under certain conditions it is then possible to design discount rules so that the resulting prices and sales quantities are effcient from the corporate perspective. In contrast, the impact of intracompany discounts remains ambiguous when {{the capacity of the}} selling division is essentially unlimited. It is then generally impossible to achieve fully effcient outcomes by means of market-based transfer pricing unless the external market for the component is suffciently large relative to the internal market. ...|$|R

The study data was collected via conducting interviews with the cluster’s agents, making direct observations during the field visits, and consulting secondary data emerging both from document analysis and from sources such as newspapers, sectoral studies, and previous academic studies. The data point to the intense frequency of transactions among firms and the low uncertainty of <b>internal</b> <b>transactions</b> within the cluster due to the extensive exchange of information among agents. The bonds of competition and coordination that are established among the firms both reduce transaction costs and make them more competitive.

40|$|Background: Liquidity and the {{management}} of liquidity are of great importance for companies.
