The Mountie asked Earl Bascom just <b>how</b> <b>old</b> <b>he</b> was - he was 13 years old. Earl was returned to school.

[...] Participants are placed in the following age groups: 14–15years, 16–17years, and 17–18years. The athlete's age is determined by <b>how</b> <b>old</b> <b>he</b> or she is by 31 December of the year they are participating in the YOG. [...] Qualification {{to participate in the}} Youth Olympics is determined by the IOC in conjunction with the International Sport Federations (ISF) for the various sports on the program. [...] To ensure that all nations are represented at the YOG the IOC instituted the concept of Universality Places. [...] A certain number of spots in each event are to be left open for athletes from under-represented nations regardless of qualifying marks. [...] This is to ensure that every nation will be able to send at least four athletes to each Youth Olympic Games. [...] For team tournaments one team per continent will be allowed to compete along with a sixth team either representing the host nation or as proposed by the IF with IOC approval. [...] There is a cap of two teams (one boys' and one girls') per nation. [...] Finally, no nation may enter more than 70 athletes in individual sports.|$|E

The family was so poor that young Jimmie {{did not have a}} bed in which to sleep until he was nine years old. Davis was not sure of his date of birth; according to the New York Times, [...] "Various newspaper and magazine articles over the last 70 years said he was born in 1899, 1901, 1902 or 1903. He told The New York Times several years ago that his sharecropper parents could never recall just when he was born – he was, after all, one of 11 children – and that he had not had the slightest idea when it really was." [...] According to the Los Angeles Times, [...] "Davis was not sure exactly <b>how</b> <b>old</b> <b>he</b> was, noting only that he was born {{around the turn of the}} last century."

Jacob told Joseph that now he could die, since he had seen Joseph's face. Joseph told his {{brothers}} {{that he would go}} tell Pharaoh that his brothers had come, that they kept cattle, and that they had brought their flocks, herds, and all their possessions. Joseph instructed them that when Pharaoh asked them their occupation, they should say that they were keepers of cattle, for shepherds were an abomination to the Egyptians. Joseph told Pharaoh that his family had arrived in the land of Goshen, and presented five of his brothers to Pharaoh. Pharaoh asked the brothers what their occupation was, and they told Pharaoh that they were shepherds and asked to live in the land of Goshen. Pharaoh told Joseph that his family could live in the best of the land, in Goshen, and if he knew any able men among them, then he could appoint them to watch over Pharaoh's cattle. Joseph set Jacob before Pharaoh, and Jacob blessed Pharaoh. Pharaoh asked Jacob <b>how</b> <b>old</b> <b>he</b> was, and Jacob answered that he was 130 years old and that few and evil had been the years of his life. Jacob blessed Pharaoh and left.

2500|$|His {{nickname}} {{was and is}} [...] "YT" [...] for [...] "young thug," [...] in {{part because}} he was older at a time when BMX was seen as a pre-teen and early teen activity. By the late 1970s, he did things beyond his young age—promoting races, nationwide tours, teaching racing clinics, safety seminars for the C.P.S.C. and starting and consulting with companies while still a teenager. Later, it became a running gag as to just <b>how</b> <b>old</b> <b>he</b> was. In the January 1975 issue of Cycle Illustrated in its report on the Yamaha Bicycle Gold Cup Finals ( [...] the Bicycle Motocross Championship of California State), which Breithaupt conceptualized, promoted, and built a custom track for, has him listed as 17 years old. At 17, his age hadn't become a running gag yet, although he could not participate in the Yamaha Bicycle Gold Cup series finals-ironically since he was the race promoter-because he was disqualified after a win in the Expert Class in the first qualifying race at Birmingham High School in Van Nuys, California with Brian Ramocinski declared the winner. This was the first of three preceding qualifying races prior to the final to be held in September 1974. Only those 16 years and younger could participate and he had turned 17 between the time he signed up for the race and the day the qualifying race was actually held, July 20, 1974. He turned 17 on July 14, 1974, six days before the race. This makes his birth year 1957, and makes him 13 when he started organizing races in Long Beach in November 1970. In fact nine other riders in the event were over 16. In fact, Ramocinski's sponsor, Dirtmasters, and its general manager Mike Devitt protested Breithaupt. Further confirmation came on page 11 of the November 1975 issue of Bicycle Motocross News, which described Breithaupt as an [...] "18-year-old dynamo." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Hiyya {{said that}} Abram's father Terah {{manufactured}} idols (as [...] implies), and once Terah went away and left Abram {{to mind the}} store. A man came and asked to buy an idol. Abram asked the man <b>how</b> <b>old</b> <b>he</b> was. The man replied that he was 50 years old. Abram exclaimed {{that it was a}} shame that a man of 50 would worship a day-old object. The man became embarrassed and left. On another occasion, a woman came with a plate of flour and asked Abram to offer it to the idols. Abram took a stick, broke the idols, and put the stick in the largest idol's hand. When Terah returned, he demanded that Abram explain what he had done. Abram told Terah that the idols fought among themselves to be fed first, and the largest broke the others with the stick. Terah asked Abram why he made sport of him, for the idols had no consciousness. Abram replied by asking Terah to listen to what he had just said. Thereupon Terah seized Abram and delivered him to Nimrod, king of Shinar. Nimrod proposed that they worship the fire. Abram replied that they should rather worship water, which extinguishes fire. Nimrod agreed to worship water. Abram replied that they should rather worship clouds, which bear the water. Nimrod agreed to worship the clouds. Abram replied that they should rather worship the winds, which disperse the clouds. Nimrod agreed to worship the wind. Abram replied that they should rather worship human beings, who withstand the wind. Nimrod then accused Abram of just bandying words, and decreed that they would worship nothing but the fire. Nimrod cast Abram into the fire, challenging Abram's God to save him from it. Haran was standing there undecided. Haran thought to himself that if Abram survived, then Haran would say that he was of Abram's faith, but if Nimrod was victorious, then Haran would say that he was on Nimrod's side. When Abram descended into the fiery furnace, God saved him. Nimrod then asked Haran whose belief he shared. Haran replied that he shared Abram's faith. Thereupon Nimrod cast Haran into the fire, and he died in his father's presence, as [...] reports, [...] "And Haran died in the presence of ( [...] , al pene) his father Terah." ...|$|E
