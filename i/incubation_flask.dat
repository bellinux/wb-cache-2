In experiment 1, the levels, in a total of 12 were the following: addition of 0 (control 1), 50, 100, 150, 200 and 250 mM of lactic acid and 0 (control 2), 50, 100, 150, 200 and 250 mM of propionic acid, respectively, in <b>incubation</b> <b>flasks,</b> which contained ruminal inoculum, glucose and synthetic culture medium, with two repetitions for each combination. In experiment 2, the combinations, in a total of 4, were the following: presence of 12 and 24 mM of propionic acid and 0 mg of glucose, respectively; presence of 12 and 24 mM of propionic acid and 40 mg of glucose, respectively, to the <b>incubation</b> <b>flasks</b> which contained ruminal inoculum, with or without glucose and in synthetic culture medium with two repetitions each. There was no effect on the specific growth velocity of ruminal microorganisms in the presence of lactic acid or propionic acid. However, when there were greater concentrations of these acids in the media, there was a longer lag phase in the microorganism phase. Acid propionic at the concentration of 24 mM inhibited the production of acid acetic and butyric acid in a media with glucose. Despite of not being used as a source of energy by the ruminal microorganisms, propionic acid affects their metabolism.

It was determined that the input in a subalpine meadow was 0. 33, in aspen 0. 52 and in spruce sites 0. 32 kg N ha− 1 yr− 1, respectively, by combined non-symbiotic and associative-symbiotic fixation. The in situ C 2 H 2 reduction values equated with the 15 N 2 fixation values if a ratio of 7. 5 C 2 H 2 reduced to 1 N 2 fixed was used. Symbiotic fixation by a lupine in the aspen site added 0. 63 kg N ha− 1 yr− 1. The associate-symbiotic fixation contributed 14 % of the N input in the meadow, 30 % in the aspen, and nil in the coniferous stands estimated by the C 2 H 2 reduction method in situ.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to apply the thyroid vein {{catheterization}} technique to the measurement of some metabolic parameters of the dog's thyroid gland in vivo, and to compare these measurements with corresponding findings obtained in vitro. The femoral artery and the inferior vein of each thyroid lobe of the dog were catheterized and blood was collected for 2 =n-hr. (Dumont & Rocmans, 1964); other small thyroid veins were ligatured. After this period the thyroid was removed, weighed, and partly used for studies in vitro in triplicate <b>incubation</b> <b>flasks.</b> The techniques used for the preparation, incubation, and metabolic evaluation of thyroid slices have been previously described (Dumont, 1964; Dumont & Tondeur-Montenez, 1965). The concentration of glucose in blood and in the incubation medium was measured according to Hoffman (1937) and that of lactate according to Hohorst (1963). Lactate concentration in blood was calculated from the plasma concentration and the haematocrit, assuming a plasma:red cell ratio of 1 =. 7 (Huckabee, 1956).

40|$|A {{new method}} is {{described}} for a precise and simultaneous {{determination of the}} rate of production and dissolution of biosilica in marine waters, using isotopic dilution technique. No HF or F 2 is required for chemical preparations as the change in isotopic composition is measured on silica producing SiO 2 &#x 2212; ions. The seawater sample flask is spiked with 30 Si(OH) 4 (&# 60; 10 % of increase in situ concentration) and incubated in in situ conditions. At the end of incubation, changes of the 30 Si: 28 Si ratios in particulate and liquid phases are measured by using a thermal ionisation mass spectrometer Finnigan THQ.

40|$|Many {{techniques}} for quantifying microbial biodegradation of 14 C-labeled compounds use soil-water slurries and trap mineralization-derived 14 CO 2 in solution wells suspended within the incubation flasks. These methods are not satisfactory for studies of arid-region soils {{that are highly}} calcareous and unsaturated because (i) slurries do not simulate unsaturated conditions and (ii) the amount of CO 2 released from calcareous soils exceeds {{the capacity of the}} suspended well. This report describes simple, inexpensive methodological modifications for quantifying microbial degradation of [14 C]benzene and 1, 2 -dichloro[U- 14 C]ethane in calcareous soils under unsaturated conditions. Soils at 50 % water holding capacity were incubated with labeled contaminants for periods up to 10 weeks, followed by acidification of the soil and trapping of the evolved CO 2 in a separate container of 2 N NaOH. The CO 2 was transferred from the <b>incubation</b> <b>flask</b> to the trap solution by a gas transfer shunt containing activated charcoal to remove any volatilized labeled organics. The amount of 14 CO 2 in the trap solution was measured by scintillation counting (disintegrations per minute). The method was tested by using two regional unamended surface soils, a sandy aridisol and a clay-rich riparian soil. The results demonstrated that both [14 C]benzene and 1, 2 -dichloro[U- 14 C]ethane were mineralized to release substantial amounts of 14 CO 2 within 10 weeks. Levels of mineralization varied with contaminant type, soil type, and aeration status (anaerobic vs. aerobic); no significant degradation was observed in abiotic control samples. Methodological refinements of this technique resulted in total 14 CO 2 recovery efficiency of approximately 90 %...|$|E
40|$|Solid {{filtered}} or centrifuged potato processing wastes {{were obtained}} from three potato processors in Idaho. The waste samples were dried and ground to pass a 2 -nun sieve and added to soils at rates of 0, 2. 5, 10, and 25 g/kg. The 100 -g samples of Portneuf silt loam soil con-taining the waste material was incubated at 26 °C and decomposition of the added wastes was determined by measuring CO, evolution in a flowing air stream passing over the soil in the <b>incubation</b> <b>flask.</b> Each increment of added organic waste material increased {{the amount of carbon}} evolved during the 12 -week incubation. The waste materials contained 6. 8, 20. 4, or 65. 5 g N/kg waste. However, these differences in N did not change the amount of CO, evolved at the 12 -week incuba-tion, although the evolution curves were shaped somewhat differently during the 12 weeks. Regression analyses of the cumulative carbon re-sulted in highly significant values being obtained for each potato processing waste material. Decomposition of the solid waste materials ranged from 24 to 92 % depending upon the source and application rate. The rapid decomposition of the solid wastes verified field re-search indicating that potato wastes have not more than 1 yr residual fertilizer value.

40|$|The {{acetylene}} inhibition technique (AIT) {{has been}} widely used to measure soil denitrification potential (SDP), but has been criticized also for underestimating the actual SDP due to limitations of the AIT. Possible effects of soil properties on the bias of the AIT-derived SDP have not been thoroughly investigated yet. The study presented here therefore aimed at quantifying the relationships between soil texture and nutrient contents and the bias of AIT-derived SDP. A total of 26 soils {{with a wide range}} of clay and nutrient contents were incubated according to the standard procedure of AIT for assaying SDP. <b>Incubation</b> <b>flasks</b> were made anaerobic by gas substitution with pure helium (99. 999 %). Changes in the N- 2 and N 2 O concentrations in the He headspace were measured using gas chromatography. The emission rates of N 2 O and N- 2 were calculated to quantify the bias of the AIT-derived SDP (expressed as the percentage of the actual SDP that was not accounted for by AIT). The results showed that the bias ranged from 8 to 98 %. The bias was negatively correlated (P < 0. 05) with the clay, silt, organic matter and nutrient contents of the soils. These results indicate that the bias of the AIT-derived SDP was higher in low-fertility soils than in fertile soils. We recommend that soil properties are taken into account when interpreting results of AIT-derived SDP values. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Diuron is a {{herbicide}} {{commonly used}} in agricultural areas where excess application causes it to leach into rivers, reach sensitive marine environments like the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) lagoon and pose risks to marine life. To investigate the impact of diuron on whole prokaryotic communities that underpin the marine food web and are integral to coral reef health, GBR lagoon water was incubated with diuron at environmentally-relevant concentration (8 µg/L), and sequenced at specific time points over the following year. 16 S rRNA gene amplicon profiling revealed no significant short- or long-term effect of diuron on microbiome structure. The relative abundance of prokaryotic phototrophs was not significantly altered by diuron, which suggests that they were largely tolerant at this concentration. Assembly of a metagenome derived from waters sampled at a similar location in the GBR lagoon did not reveal the presence of mutations in the cyanobacterial photosystem that could explain diuron tolerance. However, resident phages displayed several variants of this gene and could potentially {{play a role in}} tolerance acquisition. Slow biodegradation of diuron was reported in the <b>incubation</b> <b>flasks,</b> but no correlation with the relative abundance of heterotrophs was evident. Analysis of metagenomic reads supports the hypothesis that previously uncharacterized hydrolases carried by low-abundance species may mediate herbicide degradation in the GBR lagoon. Overall, this study offers evidence that pelagic phototrophs of the GBR lagoon may be more tolerant of diuron than other tropical organisms, and that heterotrophs in the microbial seed bank may have the potential to degrade diuron and alleviate local anthropogenic stresses to inshore GBR ecosystems...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} studies was {{conducted}} using SEM in conjunction with chemical analysis, in situ and in vitro digestion techniques, to characterize the anatomical components from barley, corn, sorghum and wheat grains which constitute "fiber" and investigate their susceptibility to rumen microbial digestion. Fractured grains were used to identify anatomical features and cell types prior to and after extraction or digestion. Certain anatomical features, including pericarp tissue, aleurone cells, endosperm cell walls, corneous and floury endosperm tissue and lemma and palea from barley, were easily identifiable in fractured and ground grains, and in neutral detergent extracted or digested residues. In situ and in vitro incubation conditions were varied to assess the effect of concentrate and/or reduction of pH on the disappearance of identifiable grain fractions. In situ incubations were conducted using steers adapted to 0 -, 30 - and 90 % concentrate diets. In vitro inoculum buffered at pH 7 or 6 was provided by a steer fed 0 - or 90 % concentrate. Tissues resistant to rumen microbial digestion during extended (144 -h) in situ incubations and shorter term (12 - to 48 -h) in vitro incubations were primarily those identified in NDF, and included pericarp, lemma and palea, and small amounts of corneous endosperm. Remaining tissues identified included barley lemma, palea and pericarp; corn pericarp, tip cap and small amounts of corneous endosperm; sorghum pericarp and corneous endosperm with matrix and protein bodies; and wheat pericarp. In vitro disappearance of isolated NDF after 48 -h ranged from 43 % for barley to 89 % for corn. Labile structures included embryonic tissue and portions of endosperm cell walls, protein matrix and residual starch. Resistant tissues included pericarp, aleurone cell walls, tip cap and portions of the corneous endosperm. Relative rankings of NDF digestibility under all conditions studied were similar (corn > sorghum > wheat > barley) whether determined using isolated NDF or calculated from TIVDMD residues. Neither concentrate level fed to the host animal nor pH of the in vitro <b>incubation</b> <b>flask</b> affected rankings among grains, although increasing concentrate level and/or reducing pH appeared to reduce in vitro NDF disappearance. Evaluation of electron micrographs of fractured grains suggested that similar anatomical structures in the various grains differed in their resistance to microbial digestion. For example, pericarp from barley and wheat appeared to be more resistant than that from corn or sorghum. Endosperm of barley was less resistant than that of sorghum...|$|E
40|$|The tachykinins, {{including}} substance P, neurokinin A and neurokinin B, are a mammalian peptide {{family that}} have documented motor, sensory and circulatory neurotransmitter {{functions in the}} gut. Little is known about their action on the exocrine pancreas. In this study we investigated the effects of PG-KII, a natural NK 3 -tachykinin receptor agonist, and senktide, a synthetic NK 3 -tachykinin receptor agonist, on amylase release from isolated pancreatic lobules of the guinea pig {{in comparison with the}} secretagogues carbachol, caerulein and substance P and the depolarizing agent KCl. When added to <b>incubation</b> <b>flasks</b> at various concentrations (from 10 (- 10) to 10 (- 6) M), PG-KII and senkfide both caused a dose-dependent increase in amylase release from pancreatic lobules. PG-KII and senktide elicited a lower maximal response (7. 5 +/- 0. 8 and 8. 1 +/- 0. 6 % of the total lobular amylase content) than carbachol (34. 4 +/- 3. 9 %), caerulein (26. 5 +/- 2. 8 %) and KCl (22. 5 +/- 3. 8 %). Whereas atropine left PG-KII and senktide-stimulated secretion unaffected, the non peptide NK 3 receptor antagonist SR 142801 significantly reduced the stimulant effect of PG-KII and senktide. PG-KII (10 (- 7) M) also slightly though significantly increased the response to lower concentrations of caerulein (10 (- 11) and 10 (- 10) M) and carbachol (10 (- 7) and 10 (- 6) M). These findings show that PG-KII and senkfide are weak stimulants of exocrine pancreatic secretion that act directly on the acinar cells through NK 3 receptors, without cholinergic involvement. We suggest also that the tachykininergic NK 3 receptor system cooperates with the other known secretagogues in the control of pancreatic exocrine secretion. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to identify an efficient and practical enrichment method for bovine type A spermatogonia. Four different enrichment methods were compared: differential plating on laminin- or Datura stramonium agglutinin (DSA) -coated flasks, percoll-gradient isolation, magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). The isolated cells were characterised with Dolichos biflorus agglutinin (DBA) lectin staining for type A spermatogonia and vimentin-antibody staining for Sertoli cells. A 2 x 2 factorial design was used to investigate the enrichment efficiency on laminin and DSA. In the laminin- enrichment groups, 2 h incubation in plates coated with 20 mu g mL(- 1) laminin yielded a 3. 3 -fold increase in DBA-positive cells in the adherent fraction, while overnight <b>incubation</b> in <b>flasks</b> coated with 20 mu g mL(- 1) DSA produced a 3. 6 -fold increase in the non-adherent fraction. However, the greatest enrichment (5. 3 -fold) of DBA-positive cells was obtained after 2 h <b>incubation</b> in control <b>flasks</b> (coated with bovine serum albumin). Percoll-gradient centrifugation yielded a 3 -fold increase in DBA-positive cells. MACS results showed a 3. 5 - to 5 -fold enrichment while FACS produced a 4 -fold increase in DBA-positive cells. It is concluded that differential plating is a better method of recovering large numbers of type A spermatogonia for germ cell transplantation, while MACS or FACS can provide highly enriched viable type A spermatogonia for in vitro culture. Further, the combination of differential plating and other enrichment techniques may increase the purification efficiency of type A spermatogonia...|$|R

Treatments were incubated in 100 -mL flasks containing 400 mg of freeze-dried grass, 5 mL of strained ruminal fluid, and 20 mL of phosphate buffer. Ruminal fluid was collected just before the morning feeding from 3 cows receiving a control diet (49 % ryegrass silage, 39 % corn silage, 1 % straw, and 11 % concentrate, fresh-weight basis) supplemented with marine algae for 21 d (adapted rumen fluid, aRF) or from the same cows receiving the control diet only for 14 d after marine algae supplementation was stopped (unadapted rumen fluid, uRF). In half of the <b>incubation</b> <b>flasks,</b> pure DHA (5 mg) was added as an oil-ethanol solution (100 mL). Incubations were carried out during 0, 0. 5, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 24 h. After 24 h, in vitro addition of DHA resulted in greater amounts (mg/incubation) of 18 : 3 n- 3 (0. 23, 0. 43, 0. 26, and 0. 34 for aRF, aRF+DHA, uRF, and uRF+DHA), 18 : 2 n- 6 (0. 14, 0. 22, 0. 15, and 0. 20 for aRF, aRF+DHA, uRF, and uRF+DHA) and trans- 11, cis- 15 - 18 : 2 (0. 27, 2. 40, 0. 06, and 2. 21 for aRF, aRF+DHA, uRF, and uRF+DHA), whereas no effect of inoculum source was observed. Trans- 11 - 18 : 1 accumulated after 24 h when aRF was incubated irrespective of in vitro DHA supplementation, whereas in incubations with uRF, accumulation of trans- 11 - 18 : 1 only occurred when DHA was added (6. 40, 4. 35, 1. 06, and 3. 91 for aRF, aRF+DHA, uRF, and uRF+DHA). The increased amounts of trans- 11 - 18 : 1 were due to the strong inhibition of the reduction to 18 : 0 because no 18 : 0 was formed when trans- 11 - 18 : 1 accumulated after 24 h. The results of the current experiment shows hydrogenation of trans- 11, cis- 15 - 18 : 2 occurred in the absence of in vitro DHA only, whereas substantial hydrogenation of trans 11 - 18 : 1 to 18 : 0 only took place in incubations without DHA and with unadapted rumen inoculum, confirming the higher sensitivity of the latter process to DHA...|$|R

Comparing the mineralization rates of radiolabeled diazinon and parathion in root-free and in rhizosphere soil, we tested our hypothesis that, {{because of the presence}} of root exudates, the rhizosphere is an especially favorable environment for such co-metabolic transformations. The insecticides were added individually at 5 μg/g to sealed flasks containing either soil permeated by the root system of a bush bean plant or identical soil without roots. Periodically, the flask atmospheres were flushed through traps and the evolved 14 CO 2 was quantitated. Bush bean plant roots without associated rhizosphere microorganisms failed to produce a significant amount of 14 CO 2. During 1 month of <b>incubation,</b> rhizosphere <b>flasks</b> mineralized 12. 9 and 17. 9 % of the added diazinon and parathion radiocarbon, respectively, compared to 5. 0 and 7. 8 % by the soil without roots.

Viable counts of microorganisms on soil extract agar were not significantly altered by root permeation or by root exudate treatment of the soil, leaving population selection and/or enhanced cometabolic activity as the most plausible interpretations for the observed stimulatory effects.

40|$|By {{using a new}} rapid high {{pressure}} filtration technique, mitochondrial and cytosolic ATP and ADP contents were determined in isolated hepatocytes at different oxygen partial pressures. At 670 mmHg, subcellular adenine nucleotide contents and ATP/ADP ratios were comparable with values obtained with the digitonin fractionation technique. However at lower oxygen partial pressure ADP appears to be rephosphorylated during digitonin fractionation whereas with {{high pressure}} filtration fractionation rephosphorylation of ADP is avoided due to shorter fractionation times. Cytosolic and mitochondrial ATP/ADP ratios decrease if oxygen partial pressure is lowered. However the absolute values of ATP/ADP ratios depend critically on the incubation conditions. Thus incubation of hepatocytes in an oxystat system, where oxygen partial pressure is maintained constant by infusing oxygen-saturated medium and the hepatocyte suspension is continuously stirred, yields much higher subcellular and overall ATP/ADP ratios than <b>incubation</b> in Erlenmeyer <b>flasks</b> gassed with different gas mixtures and shaken in a water bath. This is ascribed to limited diffusion of oxygen from the medium into the cell if the suspension is not mixed thoroughly by stirring.

Low pHi in the presence of hyperthermia enabled cell respiration to continue at a reduced level with no further change in glycolysis. There was delayed cell replication after 3 h at 42 degrees C and inability to multiply following 6 h hyperthermia: low pHi did not influence these results.

40|$|Peritoneal Dialysis Fluids of the 21 st century should fulfill major {{clinical}} demands, as {{decrease of}} cardiovascular mortality, peritoneal membrane preservation, adequate dialysis and ultrafiltration {{and maintenance of}} adequate nutrition. The ‘health’ of the peritoneal membrane and its endurance as dialysis filter {{are influenced by the}} uraemic environment and the chronic exposure to peritoneal dialysis fluids. The medical, scientific and industrial societies have mounted a great interest regarding the role of biocompatibility of peritoneal dialysis fluids on peritoneal dialysis adverse events, as ultrafiltration failure, peritonitis and encapsulated peritoneal sclerosis. Long term exposure to conventional glucose, lactate buffered dialysis fluid may provoke peritoneal damage, by neovascularization, translated clinically as ultrafiltration failure. The most adverse bioincompatible factors of dialysis fluids seem to be the acidic pH, the lactic acid buffer, the glucose, the hyperosmolality, the glucose degradation products and the advanced glycation end products. Long?time research in the biocompatibility field shed new light to the pathophysiology of peritoneal damage in peritonitis and long?term peritoneal dialysis and led to the industrial production of new peritoneal dialysis fluids of alternative osmotic factor and buffer. The ultimate purpose of the ‘newer’ dialysis fluids as opposed to conventional is a ‘healthier’ peritoneum and a ‘long?lived’ method of peritoneal dialysis in the arsenal of renal replacement therapies for end stage renal disease. Biocompatibility research of dialysis fluids, in vitro, in animals and ex vivo, has innate problems of methodology and results’ analysis which leads sometimes to contradictive and non comparable results. On the other hand, we are still lacking long term large clinical randomized clinical trials, which could verify the superiority of new to conventional fluids. We compared new and conventional unused peritoneal dialysis fluids by way of their influence on cytokines’ release by peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy volunteers, with or without stimulation, as a parameter of in vitro biocompatibility. We used an experimental procedure assimilating as much as possible the peritoneal equilibration of pH and osmolality of the peritoneal dwell. Six solutions were examined: Conventional glucose lactate buffered, as isotonic (1. 5 % dextrose) (1), and hypertonic (4. 25 % dextrose) (2) solution. Newer glucose based solutions, pyruvate buffered as isotonic (1. 0 % dextrose) (3) and hypertonic (4. 0 % dextrose) (4) 103 solutions. New solutions of alternative osmotic factor, glucose polymer (5) and amino acid (6), lactate buffered.

40|$|L'effet du pH (6. 2, 7. 2, 8. 4, 9. 6), de la température (4 °C, 12 °C, 23 °C) et du rayonnement solaire a été étudié expérimentalement sur les évolutions des abondances d'Escherichia coli 0126  : B 16 et d'autres bactéries pathogènes d'intérêt sanitaire : Salmonella typhimurium et Aeromonas hydrophila. En eau usée épurée, les résultats obtenus montrent que la température et le rayonnement solaire sont parmi les facteurs responsables des {{variations}} des abondances de ces bactéries dans les milieux aquatiques. Les faibles valeurs de température (4 °C) favorisent la survie d'E. coli et de S. lyphimurlum et réduisent celle d'A. hydrophila. Les faibles valeurs de température (4 °C) augmentent non seulement la survie bactérienne d'E. coli et de S. typhimurium mais limitent les effets nocifs des pH alcalins (pH 9. 6) sur la diminution des abondances de ces bactéries. Parmi les pH alcalins étudiés, le pH 9. 6 entraîne la plus forte diminution du temps de survie vis-à-vis d'E. coli, de A. hydrophila et de S. typhimarlam. A pH 9. 6, les T 90 obtenus à une température de 12 °C sont respectivement de 23, 20 et 33 heures. Le rayonnement solaire joue également un rôle important dans la réduction des abondances bactériennes et ce d'autant plus que le pH est élevé. Dans l'eau usée épurée par lagunage, ajustée à pH 9. 6 et exposée au rayonnement solaire, les T 90 d'E coli, d'A. hydrophila et de S. typhimarium sont respectivement de 6, 4 et de 6 heures. L'effet combiné du pH et du rayonnement est beaucoup plus important sur la réduction des abondances bactériennes que si l'un des facteurs agit isolément. The behaviour of coliforms especially E. coli, pathogenic bacteria (Salmonella typhimurium), {{and occasionally}} pathogenic bacteria (Aeromonas hydrophila) in different aquatic environments {{has often been}} studied, but rather than a medical than an environmental point of view. However, studies on the affect of various environmental factors such as temperature, pH and solar radiation on their evolution have seldom been carried out. Their action on pathogenic and occasional pathogenic bacteria remains fragmentary. The aim of this survey is analyse the effect (in laboratory experiment) of certain environmental factors such as temperature, pH and solar radiation on the behaviour of E. coli 0126  : B 16, S. typhimurium and A. hydrophila, in waste waters treated in a sewage treatment lagoon. The values of these tested factors are comparable to those which exist in aquatic environments at different seasons. Experimentation has been realized in a variable and complex medium in this case water than the basin of lagoon, in order to study the varying effects of differents factors on evolution of abundance bacteria. Hierarchization of effects of environmental factors or of certain of their associations has been proposed. In order to study {{the action of the}} temperature and the combined action of temperature-pH on the bacterial evolution, four sterile 1 litre flasks were filled with 500 ml of waste water treated in lagoon. The pH of each flask was adjusted by acid (H 2 SO 4) or alkaline (NaOH) solutions at 6. 2; 7. 2; 8. 4 and 9. 6. Each flask was seeded with a bacterial inoculum of each of the tested strains (E. coli, A. hydrophila and S. typhimurium). The temperature used for the <b>incubation</b> of the <b>flasks</b> corresponded to the different seasons : 4 °C, 12 °C and 23 °C. The temporal evolution of the abundance of each tested strain is followed up by the indirect counting on specific media : TTC and Tergitol Lactose Agar (Institut Pasteur Production) and incubation at 44. 5 °C for 24 hours (E. coli), Salmonella-Shigella Agar (BioMérieux) and incubation at 37 °C for 24 hours (S. typhimurium 4, 5 H 1, 2 i), Pril-Xylose-Ampicilin agar (ROGOL et al., 1979) and incubation at 37 °C for 48 hours (A. hydrophila ATCC 7966). The action of the solar radiation and the combined action of solar radiation-pH on E. coli, S. typhimurium and A. hydrophila was carried out as follows :i) 3 series of glass crystallizers were filled with 500 ml of waste water treated in lagoon (height water : 55 mm). Three reactional mediums were thus prepared by adjusting the pH to 7. 2; 8. 4 and 9. 6. Each pH corresponds to two crystallizers which were seeded with a bacterial inoculum of E. coli; S. typhimurium; and A. hydrophila. For each pH one of the crystallizers is placed in front of a window receiving plenty of solar radiation, the other being protected from all radiation by aluminium paper and used as control. The number of bacteria is verified by counting the colony forming units (c. f. u.) through a dilution-spreading technique on the same media as those used to estimate the action of temperature and pH on the survival of E. coli, A. hydrophila and S. typhimurium. ii) In order to understand the night and day variations in the number of E. coli according to the solar radiation, another method was used. A standard E. coli inoculum is added to some water of the outflow of lagoon filtered on 0, 45 µm (Millipore) and exposed to solar radiation. The temporal evolution of the number of E. coli is then followed by daily counts at 6 : 00 AM, at 2 : 00 PM and at 19 : 00 PM (GMT hour). Comparison of the different results is made with T 90 (the time needed to reduce the initial bacterial population by 90 %) and with an equality test of 2 regression coefficients (FRONTIER, 1981). Obtained results show that temperature and solar radiation could be considered among factors responsible for the variable abundance of E. coli, A. hydrophila and S. typhimurium. At pH 6. 2; 7. 2 and 8. 4 and effect incubation at 23 °C, the survival time (T 90) of E. coli and A. hydrophila is almost the same (T = 53 h) and is anyway inferior to the one for S. typhimurrum which survived nearly twice as long (T 90 = 100 h). On the other hand, at pH 9. 6 and with the same incubation temperature of 23 °C, the survival time of different tested bacteria is reduced. The T 90 for E. coli {{is the same as the}} one for A. hydrophila (T 90 = 20 h) and is 24 hours for S. typhimuriun (table 1). It is almost 4, 3 times lower than the one with pH 6. 2 and 7. 2. The evolution in number of the same bacteria with similar pH but at a temperature of 12 °C are shown in figure 2. Compared with results obtained at 23 °C, one notices that the arrival of different tested bacteria is longer. The survival times for E. coli and A. hydrophila are almost the same (T 90 = 73 h), but differ than the one for S. typhimurium (T 90 = 142 h), a bacteria which always survives better than other bacteria under the same experimental conditions. Low temperatures (4 °C) increase the survival et E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium and reduce that of Aeromonas hydrophila. Not only do these low temperatures (4 °C) reduce survival of E. coli and S. typhimurium but they also reduce negative effects of alkaline pH (pH 9. 6) which decreases the abundance of these bacteria. Among the alkaline pH values studied, pH 9. 6 caused the highest reduction of the survival of E. coli, A. hydrophila and S. typhimurium. We can conclude that at 4 °C the survival time of A. hydrophila significantly decreases in comparison with that of E. coli and S. typhimurium. At 12 and 23 °C, the survival time of E. coli and A. hydrophila is the same. S. typhimurium survived better than both E. coli and A. hydrophila. Solar radiation is also considered an important factor in the decrease of bacterial abundance especially when the pH is alkaline. Under solar radiation and pH 9. 6, the survival time of E. coli, A. hydrophila and S. typhimurium is respectively 6, 4 and 6 hours (table 2). The decline in the numbers of these bacteria in effluent lagoon samples was found to be significantly greater in the presence of both pH-temperature or pH-solar radiation than when each of these factors was acting independently. In waste waters treated in lagoon and under sunlight, E. coli 0126  : B 16 undergoes a successive evolution (night growth phase-diurnal decrease phase : fig. 5). According to all count values, we can plot the regression straight line (log 10 bacteria = vs (time)) and estimate the death coefficient which is the slope of this regressional straight line. This model expresses the tendency of the linear decrease of E. coli. Predictions of this model are satisfactory for counting values corresponding to periods of 24 hours or their multiple. The decrease phase or stable night phase cannot be predicte by this model owing to the fact that it is linear and presents the negative slope...|$|R
