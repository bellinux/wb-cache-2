50|$|Linscott {{used her}} own {{personal}} funding to finance the first ten years of her research. Around 1940, she gained sponsorship from Musicraft and in 1941 from the Library of Congress. In 1941, Linscott borrowed equipment from Alan Lomax (head of the Library's Archive of American Folk Song) and in two weeks delivered to Lomax 36 <b>glass-core</b> master acetate discs of folk songs. Lomax was a regular correspondent and mentor to her during this time.|$|E
40|$|A {{simple method}} has been devised for the {{experimental}} determination of mode conversion coefficients in multimode fibers and involves only the observation of the far-field output as the angle of incidence of a collimated input beam is changed. The normalized mode coupling coefficient in a liquid-core fiber is D = 3 x 10 ^- 6 rad^ 2 / m and increases {{by as much as}} a factor of 10 when transverse pressure is applied. Values some 2 orders of magnitude larger are found in <b>glass-core</b> fibers. There is good agreement between the theory presented and experiment...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} simple {{refractive}} index sensor {{based on a}} step-index fiber with a hollow micro-channel running parallel to its core. This channel becomes waveguiding when filled with a liquid of index greater than silica, causing sharp dips {{to appear in the}} transmission spectrum at wavelengths where the <b>glass-core</b> mode phase-matches to a mode of the liquid-core. The sensitivity of the dip-wavelengths to changes in liquid refractive index is quantified and the results used to study the dynamic flow characteristics of fluids in narrow channels. Potential applications of this fiber microstructure include measuring the optical properties of liquids, refractive index sensing, biophotonics and studies of fluid dynamics on the nanoscale.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} a 3 D surface mapping system used to measure the surface of a fusion target Capsule Fill-Tube Assembly (CFTA). The CFTA consists of a hollow Ge-doped plastic sphere, called a capsule, ranging in outer diameter between 2. 2 mm and 2. 6 mm and an attached 150 {micro}m diameter <b>glass-core</b> fill-tube that tapers down to a 10 {micro} diameter at the capsule. The mapping system is an enabling technology to facilitate a quality assurance program and to archive 3 D surface information of each capsule used in fusion ignition experiments that are currently being performed at the National Ignition Facility (NIF). The 3 D Surface Mapping System is designed to locate and quantify surface features with a height of 50 nm and 300 nm in width or larger. Additionally, the system will be calibrated such that the 3 D measured surface can be related to the capsule surface angular coordinate system to within 0. 25 degree (1 {sigma}), which corresponds to approximately 5 {micro}m linear error on the capsule surface...|$|E
40|$|Using a {{selective}} hole closure technique, individual hollow channels in silica-air photonic crystal fibers {{are filled with}} pure Ge by pumping in molten material at high pressure. The smallest channels filled so far are 600 nm in diameter, which is 10 x smaller than in previous work. Electrical conductivity and micro-Raman measurements indicate that the resulting cm-long wires have {{a high degree of}} crystallinity. Optical transmission spectra are measured in a sample with a single wire placed adjacent to the core of an endlessly single-mode photonic crystal fiber. This renders the fiber birefringent, as well as causing strongly polarization-dependent transmission losses, with extinction ratios as high as 30 dB in the visible. In the IR, anti-crossings between the <b>glass-core</b> mode and resonances on the high index Ge wire create a series of clear dips in the spectrum transmitted through the fiber. The measurements agree closely with the results of finite-element simulations in which the wavelength dependence of the dielectric constants is taken fully into account. A toy model based on a multilayer structure is used to help interpret the results. Finally, the temperature dependence of the anti-crossing wavelengths is measured, the preliminary results suggesting that the structure might form the basis of a compact optical thermometer. Since Ge provides electrical conductance together with low-loss guidance in the mid-IR, Ge-filled PCF seems likely to lead to new kinds of in-fiber detector and sensor, as well as having potential uses in ultra-low-threshold nonlinear optical devices.
