50|$|The {{procedure}} {{given in}} Robert's Rules of Order for voting on motions and amendments {{is also a}} Condorcet method, even though the voters do not vote by expressing their orders of preference. There are multiple rounds of voting, and in each round the vote is {{between two of the}} alternatives. The loser (by majority rule) of a pairing is eliminated, and the winner of a pairing survives to be paired in a later round against another alternative. Eventually only one alternative remains, and it is the winner. This is analogous to a single-winner tournament; the total number of pairings is one less than the number of alternatives. Since a Condorcet winner will win by majority rule in each of its pairings, it will never be eliminated by Robert's Rules. But this method cannot reveal a voting paradox {{in which there is no}} Condorcet winner and a majority prefer an <b>early</b> <b>loser</b> over the eventual winner. A considerable portion of the literature on social choice theory is about the properties of this method since it is widely used and is used by important organizations (legislatures, councils, committees, etc.). It is not practical for use in public elections, however, since its multiple rounds of voting would be very expensive for voters, for candidates, and for governments to administer.|$|E
40|$|An organization's {{promotion}} decision {{between two}} workers is modeled {{as a problem}} of boundedly rational learning about ability. The decisionmaker can bias noisy rank-order contests sequentially, thereby changing the information they convey. The optimal final-period bias favors the "leader," reinforcing his likely ability advantage. When optimally biased rank-order information is a sufficient statistic for cardinal information, the leader is favored in every period. In other environments, bias in early periods may (1) favor the <b>early</b> <b>loser,</b> (2) be optimal even when the workers are equally rated, and (3) reduce the favored worker's promotion chances.

The unemployment rate remains stubbornly high and durations of unemployment are unprecedentedly long. I use data from the Dis- placed Workers Survey (DWS) from 1984 - 2010 to investigate the incidence and consequences of job loss from 1981 - 2009. In particular, the January 2010 DWS, which captures job loss during the 2007 - 2009 period, provides a window through which to examine the experience of job losers in the Great Recession and to compare their experience to that of <b>earlier</b> job <b>losers.</b> These data show a record high rate of job loss, with almost one in six workers reporting having lost a job in the 2007 - 2009 period.

40|$|Why do {{some investors}} tend to ''sell winners too <b>early</b> and ride <b>losers</b> too long''? Such behavior, labeled the {{disposition}} effect, has {{been attributed to}} biases in return expectations, time-varying risk-aversion based on the value function of prospect theory, and regret theory. I review these explanations and argue that none of them is satisfactory because they either fail to capture the disposition effect or because they are not supported by emprical evidence. I point out that there is a large psychological literature on entrapment, escalating commitment, and sunk cost that studies phenomena that are very similar to the disposition effect. This literature suggests an explanation of the disposition effect based on cognitive dissonance theory. ...|$|R

40|$|According to the {{prospect}} theory financial investors tend to sell winners too <b>early</b> and ride <b>losers</b> too long. Therefore, demand for financial advise should be {{high in a}} bull market and low in a bear market. Thus, we test the hypothesis whether the demand for business magazines is somehow related {{to the performance of}} the stock market. It turns out that the sales of these magazines are positively correlated with the stock market index. Due {{to the fact that the}} information provided in business magazines seem to be already reflected in stock prices, trading on those kind of data will be just like trading on noise. In conclusion, we are able to isolate a major influence factor for the expectation formation process of noise traders. [...] Noise Trader,Stock Market,Business Magazine,Demand Estimation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} careers of top {{managers}} using a large panel of firms. The main objective is to empirically evaluate the role of learning and human capital acquisition in promotion dynamics along with variables capturing the formation of internal labour market (ILM) practices. We find that promotion is negatively correlated with tenure, but {{that there is a}} non-linear negative duration dependence with elapsed time since the last promotion event. Firms showing a weaker degree of ILM are less prone to promote insiders. We next take the manager's career inside a firm as a sequence of promotion decisions, and use a nested structure of the promotion decision modelled as a nested logit model. �Results show that the top manager's progression nest into four types: <b>loser,</b> <b>early</b> starter, late beginner, and champion, and that the degree of ILM as a signigicant impact on the process of learning inside the firm. ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose To {{examine the}} rate of early HBeAg loss and {{predictors}} of HBeAg loss in HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients with acute exacerbation (AE) treated with lamivudine. Methods A total of 146 patients diagnosed with CHB and AEs were included in this retrospective study. Patients {{were divided into two}} groups: decompensated and compensated. Results The mean treatment duration for the decompensated and compensated groups was 18. 1 and 19. 9 months, respectively. Decompensated patients were significantly older and had a higher prevalence of cirrhosis and genotype B infection than compensated patients. Compared to compensated patients, decompensated patients achieved a higher rate of HBeAg loss (25. 8 vs. 14. 3 %; P = 0. 0805) at 3 months of therapy, a higher rate of serum HBV DNA negativity (53. 2 vs. 29. 8 %; P = 0. 0042), and a lower rate of rtM 204 V/I mutation (3. 2 vs. 16. 7 %; P = 0. 0139) after 12 months of lamivudine therapy. The rates of HBeAg loss after 6 and 12 months of lamivudine therapy were similar between the two groups. Logistic regression analysis revealed that female gender and baseline ALT level >= 1, 000 IU/L, but not decompensations, were significant predictors of HBeAg loss at 3 months; however, only female gender {{was a significant predictor of}} HBeAg loss after 6 and 12 months of lamivudine therapy. The <b>early</b> HBeAg <b>losers</b> showed a significantly higher sustained remission rate off lamivudine therapy. Conclusions Female gender and baseline serum ALT level >= 1, 000 IU/L were independent predictors of early HBeAg loss during lamivudine therapy in HBeAg-positive CHB patients with AE...|$|R

40|$|The {{first chapter}} {{examines}} consumer choices {{of health insurance}} contracts. An important innovation in health insurance design is a high-deductible health plan paired with a health savings account (HSA). These contracts aim to control costs by linking insurance coverage with tax incentives for saving, but their rules are highly complex. How consumers perceive the features of these contracts may dampen any cost reduction and produce unintended welfare effects by distorting plan choices. Using a novel administrative dataset linking health insurance choices, medical claims, and saving in HSAs and 401 (k) s from a large U. S. health insurer, I develop and estimate a model that integrates HSA saving with deductible choices. I estimate over two-thirds of the marginal HSA dollar is allocated to reduce the deductible, which counteracts the contract 2 ̆ 7 s cost-control incentives and leads consumers to choose different insurance plans than they would without an HSA. In this setting, using HSA contributions to offset higher deductibles produced no reduction in health care costs. Several counterfactual analyses quantify the welfare implications of using the HSA to finance current costs on moral hazard, plan enrollment and premiums, and the consumption smoothing benefits from insurance. Health insurance contracts that require sophisticated consumer decision-making may work well in theory, but may be less effective and lead to unintended consequences in practice. ^ The second chapter investigates how status affects health by comparing mortality between Gold and Silver medalists in Olympic Track and Field. Contrary to conventional wisdom, winners die over two years <b>earlier</b> than <b>losers.</b> Analysis of individual Census records of each athlete and his parents suggests that income is the key mechanism: losers pursued higher-paying occupations than winners after the Olympics, while parental earnings in childhood were similar. An athlete’s performance relative to expectations plays an auxiliary role, but is much less important than income. The results suggest that how people respond to pivotal life events can produce long-lasting consequences for health. ...|$|R

Slop has proven to be an issue for some HouseGuests; Hypoglycemic HouseGuest Amanda Hansen fainted and had a seizure after only a few days of being on the slop diet, while HouseGuest Allison Nichols had an allergic reaction to the slop (both of these cases occurred in Big Brother 9). Both women were medically evacuated from the house, though they returned the following morning. HouseGuests who choose to break the slop rule are punished by Big Brother. HouseGuest Jen Johnson from Big Brother 8 was the first HouseGuest to break the food restriction rules, and earned a penalty eviction vote for doing so; she was ultimately evicted that week. Audrey Middleton from Big Brother 17 and Matt Clines from Big Brother 19 also broke the rules and earned a penalty vote and ultimately evicted. HouseGuests Jeff Schroeder and Kevin Campbell of Big Brother 11 also broke the rules, to a lesser degree, and earned an extra day on the slop diet. The HouseGuests also frequently compete in luxury competitions during their time in the house. Most frequently, HouseGuests will compete for the right to watch a film or television show in the house.
