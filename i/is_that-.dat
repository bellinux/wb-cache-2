The objective of the case study described in this paper is to evaluate the performance of displacement systems in offices (ie an environment with a low air pollution load) in terms of thermal energy.

A spread of P arises in this way if, and only if, there exists an isomorphism of L onto the kernel of the spread such that K is elementwise invariant. Furthermore a geometric characterization of right quadratic extensions with a left degree other than two and of quadratic Galois extensions is given. 1...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} robust {{features}} of estimated gravity equations <b>is</b> <b>that-</b> based on standard theory- the effect of distance on trade flows appears too strong to be explained by trade costs alone. Despite the strong and ongoing reduction of trade costs, the effect is rather increasing than decreasing {{over the last six}} decades. This paper specifies a model of international trade in which heterogeneous firms can form informational networks to decrease their fixed costs of exporting. Compared to existing theories, the effect of distance on aggregate trade ows is endogenously magnified and an improvement of the (exogenous) network technology turns out to be an explanation for the increase of estimated distance effects over time. Major implications of the model regarding the effects of firm heterogeneity and market structure are supported by existing empirical evidence. An empirical gravity equation is used to obtain an estimate of the magnitude of the effect. In the light of this model the empirical results on the effects of distance on international trade appear considerably less puzzling...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the extent to which household expenditure patterns are affected by Child Benefit (CB), a transfer payment that depends on the number of children in the household. Despite the fact that CB is cash, we find that it is spent differently than other income – not on child assignable goods, but disproportionately on alcohol. We find, surprisingly, that this effect is much larger for couples that for lone mothers but this would be consistent with the idea that parents free-ride when it comes to child quality investment. Thus, our evidence suggests that the answer to our question <b>is</b> <b>that-</b> it is parents who benefit from CB. This would be consistent with two extreme views: parents place little weight on the welfare of their children; or parents place so much weight that they fully insure their children against shocks. We decompose CB variation into anticipated (inflation driven) variation, and (reform driven) surprises. We find that the alcohol spending result is driven by surprises – consistent with the view that parents are altruistic towards their children...|$|E

This study examined three aspects related to the climate of the institution, and the fabric of the interpersonal relations between these two groups of students: (a) Arab students ’ perceptions of equality and consideration for minority groups; (b) Students ’ perceptions of the relationships between the two groups; (c) Arab students ’ apprehensions stemming from their minority status. Findings highlight a complex, mainly positive reality. Considerable findings stand in contrast to prevalent public beliefs, and to the situation on other campuses in Israel. The important lesson of this study <b>is</b> <b>that-</b> despite differences in religion, culture and nationality, despite the complexity of the minority experience in Israel, and despite the dark shadow cast on Arab-Jewish relations by the Israel-Palestinian conflict – a rather positive climate prevails on these campuses as far as the relations between these two groups is concerned. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{distinction}} between speech and writing is traditionally {{felt to be}} fundamental to any discussion about language. Indeed, many would find the difference so basic and obvious that they might question the need to devote any space to it at all. The distinction is transparent, they might say. Speech uses the transmitting medium of 'phonic substance', typically air-pressure movements produced by the vocal organs, whereas writing uses the transmitting medium of 'graphic substance', typically marks on a surface made by a hand using an implement. It is simply a physical thing.

He decided on a raven, which he considered [...] "equally capable of speech" [...] as a parrot, because it matched the intended tone of the poem. Poe said the raven is meant to symbolize [...] "Mournful and Never-ending Remembrance". He was also inspired by Grip, the raven in [...] by Charles Dickens. One scene in particular bears a resemblance to [...] "The Raven": {{at the end of}} the fifth chapter of Dickens's novel, Grip makes a noise and someone says, [...] "What <b>was</b> <b>that–</b> him tapping at the door?"

[...] Dickens's raven could speak many words and had many comic turns, including the popping of a champagne cork, but Poe emphasized the bird's more dramatic qualities. Poe had written a review of Barnaby Rudge for Graham's Magazine saying, among other things, that the raven should have served a more symbolic, prophetic purpose. The similarity did not go unnoticed: James Russell Lowell in his A Fable for Critics wrote the verse, [...] "Here comes Poe with his raven, like Barnaby Rudge / Three-fifths of him genius and two-fifths sheer fudge."

40|$|In this paper, I {{develop and}} test a simple {{economic}} model of sexuality. The key idea <b>is</b> <b>that—</b> taking the biological determinants of sexual preferences as given—social, cultural, and economic variables {{play a crucial}} role in the development and expression of sexual behavior, desire, and identity, which together characterize sexual orientation. I apply the theory to make predictions about the effect of AIDS on sexuality, since AIDS dramatically altered the cost of sexual activities. Using a nationally representative dataset on sexual behavior in the United States, I estimate the impact of AIDS. I employ an instrumental variables strategy, as well as examine the change in sexual behavior before and after AIDS is discovered. I create an instrumental variable based on whether a person has a relative with AIDS. People who have a relative with AIDS, on average, have more knowledge, awareness, and fear of AIDS than those who do not. I argue that this variable is exogenous, as it is uncorrelated with a large number of individual background characteristics. The empirical results validate the economics of sexuality. I find that AIDS causes people to shift from less safe sexual activities to safer ones. I find that AIDS causes men to shift from homosexual to heterosexual behavior, desire, and identity, whereas AIDS causes women to shift from heterosexual to homosexual desire. Neither genetic nor hormonal theories of sexual orientation can explain these findings. Therefore, biology is not the sole determinant of sexual behavior, desire, and identity. Both biology and economics shape sexual orientation...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{critically}} {{evaluates the}} concept, theory and process of economic globalisation, which extends the widely held belief that capitalist firms now produce {{the vast majority}} of goods and services produced in the world (i. e. the commodification thesis), by asserting that this process of commodification is increasingly taking place within an open world economy in which firms operate in a deregulated and seamless global marketplace. In this economic globalisation thesis, therefore, it is a specific type of commodified global economy that is becoming hegemonic and stretching wider and deeper across the globe, namely unregulated or 'free market' capitalism composed of hyper-mobile and homeless capital operating in a borderless world. The intention here is to investigate this belief in economic globalisation by demonstrating the influence and pervasiveness of the informal sector in Gambian society. In doing so, this thesis contests the view that economic globalisation is the only feasible future for those in the 'developing' world particularly those in Sub-Saharan Africa (The Gambia), and displays how the future is more open than suggested by its proponents. The empirical findings of this thesis <b>are</b> <b>that-</b> a) the informal sector in the Gambia forms a significant part in the day-to-day livelihood coping strategies of rural and urban households; b) the provisioning of goods and services in Gambian society is largely embedded in the informal sector rather than the commodified global market; c) and that the informal sector in the Gambia is not an opposition to the benefits and opportunities offered by economic globalisation through foreign direct investment and trade and that such benefits and opportunities can be utilised by the informal sector in creating a development pathway for the Gambia.
