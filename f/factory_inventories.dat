All these companies, with the exception again of Alkett, produced tanks in addition to their normal peacetime manufacture of trucks, locomotives, and other heavy equipment. From 1935 onward, the government progressively increased its control over industries engaged in rearmament. The Nazi Party's Four Year Plan introduced in 1936 placed Hermann Göring in leadership of the state's efforts to bring industry into state control. [...] Through threat and coercion Göring was able to expand the Nazi Party's control of private industry involved in steel and armament production. By 1938, this control included the rationing of essential raw materials, <b>factory</b> <b>inventories,</b> labor hours, rates of pay, working conditions, building and machine tool expansion, plant locations and stock dividends. All companies were forced to join the Economic Board of the tank industry which handled all questions affecting the industry.|$|E
30|$|The SCN design {{optimization}} problems with uncertainty {{have been addressed}} and developed {{in a wide variety}} of past researches (Taleizadeh et al. 2008 a, b, 2010, 2011; Olivares-Benitez et al. 2012; Wang et al. 2011). These researches typically considered demand as the uncertainty parameter of the supply chain (El-Sayed et al. 2010; Rodriguez et al. 2014; Georgiadis et al. 2011; Cardona-Valdés and Alvarez 2011). Mirzapour Al-e-hashem et al. (2011) proposed a multi-site, multi-period, multi-product aggregate production planning problem in a supply chain consisting of multiple suppliers, multiple plants and multiple customers under cost and demand uncertainty. The proposed bi-objective model is solved as a single-objective mixed integer programming model using the LP-metrics method. Moreover, Azaron et al. (2008) developed a multi-objective robust stochastic programming approach for designing SCs under uncertainty. In their approach, in addition to demands, supplies, processing, transportation, shortage and capacity expansion costs were also considered as the uncertain parameters. They applied the goal attainment technique to obtain the Pareto-optimal solutions. Hnaiena et al. (2010) addressed a supply planning model for a two-level assembly systems under random lead times. They solved this problem by two multi-objective heuristics methods based on GA algorithm. Song et al. (2014) proposed a mathematical model for the optimal material procurement and production control problem in a manufacturing SC with multiple suppliers in the presence of multiple uncertainties such as uncertain material supplies, stochastic production times, and random customer demands. They employed the integrated inventory management policy for procurement and production control using the stochastic dynamic programming approach. Pasandideh et al. (2015) addressed a multi-product SCN design problem under uncertainty with three levels of manufacturers, distributors and customers. The problem of deciding the number of products, number and locations of distribution centers and the number of goods going from factories to distribution centers and to the customers, <b>factory</b> <b>inventories</b> and slack of time periods were allowed. They utilized a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) to solve the problem.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{examine whether}} centenarians {{have a unique}} set of {{personality}} traits, which may in part explain their longevity. Methods: 79 Australian centenarians completed the NEO Five <b>Factory</b> <b>Inventory</b> (NEO-FFI), Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) and Life Orientation Test Revised (LOT-R) to assess different dimensions of their personalities. Centenarians were asked to answer items of the NEO-FFI, CD-RISC and LOT-R based on current views, and were then asked to recall in the presence of an informant (e. g. carers, offspring) on past personality (i. e. at mid-adult-life). Both sets of answers were recorded and analysed. Results: Centenarians were currently low in Openness and Extraversion and high in Neuroticism, but were low in Openness and high in Neuroticism, Conscientiousness and Extraversion when reflecting on past traits. Currently, centenarians in high care facilities reported higher levels of Neuroticism, as did centenarians who did not socialize. Cognitively intact centenarians reported higher levels of Agreeableness; and males reported lower Neuroticism compared to females when reflecting on past experiences. Discussion: Centenarians were characterized by several personality traits, which facilitated positive health behaviors and thus contributed to their longevity.

Each of these efforts has contributed to the marked improvement F 23 achieved throughout 2006. F 23 's cycle time efficiency, the ratio of raw process cycle time to actual fab cycle time, improved from 12 % (worst amongst Intel facilities) to greater than 35 % (best amongst Intel sites), and overall cycle time was reduced by more than 61 % in 2006. Inventory control was found to {{have a major impact on}} factory cycle time and performance. F 23 controls its <b>factory</b> work-in-process, WIP, <b>inventory</b> through the F 23 Wafer Starts Protocol. F 23 utilizes Little's Law (Cycle Time = Inventory / Output) to identify target WIP inventory levels required to achieve particular cycle time goals. The target inventory is then achieved by modulating wafer starts. To do this, the Wafer Starts Protocol monitors the inventory of the overall fab and the constraint operations and suggests the amount of wafers to start for each shift. (cont.) Maintaining the target inventory level drives the overall factory cycle time towards the cycle time goal. Using the starts protocol, F 23 has reduced its inventory by 44 % while ramping factory output. During the implementation of this wafer starts protocol, F 23 began tracking a new inventory metric to determine factory performance. Critical WIP ratio was introduced to evaluate the <b>factory's</b> <b>inventory</b> relative to the theoretical minimum inventory based upon a given factory output level and raw process time. F 23 also found that this metric provides an effective comparison of inventory level between fabs. The Fab 23 Wafer Starts Protocol is one of the ways in which F 23 has applied Manufacturing Science tactics and principles to drive cycle time improvements. F 23 has found that inventory control can have significant impacts on factory cycle time. This is one of the reasons why F 23 was able to achieve dramatic cycle time improvement. by Matthew J. Ward.

However, while the relation with Axis- 1 diseases is well-defined, temperamental/personality traits have been less investigated. The study aimed at detecting correlations between {{psychiatric disorders}}, temperamental traits and body image perception in overweight and obese patients who seek surgical lipostructuring treatments. Material and Methods. 28 overweight/obese patients (age 18 - 60 yrs, BMI 25 to 34. 9 at recruitment) {{were enrolled in the}} period March 2008 - June 2011 between those referring to the outpatient service for Obesity-related lipodystrophisms of the Institute of Plastic Surgery. Presence of psychiatric disorders, temperamental traits and body image perception were evaluated, and compared to a control group (N= 25) from general population sharing clinical/demographic features. Psychiatric evaluation was based on acquisition of clinical history, Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview, Beck Depression Inventory, Yale Brown Scale (YBOCS), Paykel Life Events Scale, NEO Five <b>Factory</b> <b>Inventory,</b> Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire (TPQ), Body Shape Questionnaire (BSQ). Results. The patients group presented higher scoring in lifetime depression and BSQ with moderate/mild concern with body shapes. With regard to personality traits, TPQ revealed higher score in subscale RD 4 (dependence/independence) in the patients, while controls scored higher in “openness to experience” NEO-FFI sub-scale. At YBOCS obese patients presented higher prevalence of obsessive characters. Conclusion. The affective sphere is a relevant feature in obese patients, but also obsessive traits, as negative body shape perception and temperamental and personality characteristics appear to be involved in leading patients to seek surgical consultation.

A Model Predictive Control (MPC) based Tactical Execution module forms the inner loop which generates short timescale decisions on the starts of factories by considering the stochasticity and nonlinearity on both supply side and demand side in semicondutor manufacturing.

50|$|When the bin on {{the factory}} floor is empty (because the parts in it were used up in a {{manufacturing}} process), the empty bin and its kanban card are returned to the <b>factory</b> store (the <b>inventory</b> control point). The factory store replaces the empty bin {{on the factory}} floor with the full bin from the factory store, which also contains a kanban card. The factory store sends the empty bin with its kanban card to the supplier. The supplier's full product bin, with its kanban card, is delivered to the factory store; the supplier keeps the empty bin. This is the final step in the process. Thus, the process never runs out of product—and could be described as a closed loop, in that it provides the exact amount required, with only one spare bin so there is never oversupply. This 'spare' bin allows for uncertainties in supply, use, and transport in the inventory system. A good kanban system calculates just enough kanban cards for each product. Most factories that use kanban use the coloured board system (heijunka box).|$|R

[...] "They built smaller factories ... in which the only materials housed in the factory were those on which work was currently being done. In this way, inventory levels were kept low, investment in in-process inventories was at a minimum, and the investment in purchased natural resources was quickly turned around so that additional materials were purchased." [...] Plenart goes on to explain Toyota's key role in developing this lean or JIT production methodology.|$|R
40|$|The lean {{production}} philosophy {{has been applied}} {{in the construction industry}} to reduce waste andincrease efficiency. It is until recently that the lean philosophy has proven to be effective to meet thechallenges of sustainable development. Many studies have shown that lean philosophy can be applied inprecast concrete <b>factories</b> to lower <b>inventory,</b> reduce waste and increase efficiency. However, the precastconcrete installation cycle should not be overlooked following a life cycle perspective. This study adoptsa weighted factor model comprising 30 contractors in the Singapore construction industry and a casestudy. Construction site layout management practices are investigated using the weighted factor model. Strategies to improve the construction site layout are presented in a case study. The results indicatedthat there are many non-value adding activities in the site layout management practices that contributeto an increase in the carbon emissions level. Little consideration of green building materials, improperspecifications of the precast concrete products, lack of an uninterrupted workflow, and inaccurate esti-mation of seem {{to be the most important}} ones. The results provide good practice guidance and can beused as a checklist for contractors to identify the NVA activities in the installation sites to achieve low-carbon installation. The results will also be useful for regulatory agencies to provide recommendationsfor contractors to improve the installation procedure and reduce carbon emissions...|$|R

40|$|The A 1 IMS-II subproject was {{dedicated}} to the development and testing of practical computer-aided instruments for structural factory planning by means of modern visualization and simulation techniques and by use of real data. In addition, instruments were developed for configuration of factory simulators which support permanent logistics-oriented factory planning at the operative and tactical levels. The definition of structural materials and information flow elements and their interaction provided elementary fundamentals {{for the development of}} design rules applicable to materials handling structuring processes. The integration of structure models into the real data inventory of, e. g. a factory allows one to model the real factory processes. Using the model, conceivable structuring alternatives or control strategies can be tested and evaluated before orders are placed for implementation. The 'permanent factory planning' option of the developed instrument contributes to rationalization in small- and medium-scale factories if, for example, service companies develop, archive and continuously maintain the factory models, or if the models are connected via data interfaces with the <b>factory's</b> real data <b>inventory</b> and are used every day to find solutions to topical problems. The present applications of the model elements comprise, e. g. simulation-assisted analyses of factories and their information and materials flow interconnections with suppliers and customers, and the modeling of complex logistics structures such as procurement and distribution channels.

40|$|Engineering focused {{companies}} {{often find}} difficulty in managing costs. As the innovations begin to slow and key products are commoditized these companies {{often find themselves}} far behind their competition from a cost perspective and quickly lose margin and market share. Shifting the supply organization towards one of cost awareness is a difficult and slow task. The challenge and goal in changing the mindset of the organization {{is to create a}} team which actively seeks and analyzes all opportunities to remove inefficiencies in the purchasing and management of supply. Large cost cutting initiatives start the process, but changing the mentality and culture of a supply organization involves more than shifting the <b>factory</b> footprint, reducing <b>inventory,</b> and taking away the free pots of coffee. ABB is a large global engineering company with products ranging from automation to power technology. Historically relying on technological superiority and a strong customer focus, ABB has focused energy on growth of the top line revenues, and was inconsistent in managing the bottom line costs. In 2004 ABB margins were the thinnest among all of their competitors, and they were the furthest behind in EC sourcing. (cont.) This thesis emphasizes the need for engineering companies to manage commodity costs and describes different activities, performed within ABB to change the mentality and the culture of the supply organization from one of cost acceptance to one of cost awareness. The challenges in managing the indirect commodity spends at ABB will be outlined and the need for optimization studies, modeling, and data driven decision making to control costs and quality will be shown. Discussed will be the difficulties and discoveries from three projects: the modeling and optimization of European ground transportation, the management of a pan-European team to manage the electrical energy spends, and the development of cost models for training of the supply organization. These activities were performed to challenge the complacent mindset toward managing commodity costs and to effect organizational change. Following the discussion of specific projects and results, higher level thoughts and more general considerations will be summarized. by Jeremy Weinstein. Thesis (M. B. A.)

40|$|The Largo {{manufacturing}} {{site of the}} Raytheon Company is a pure production facility with limited collocated design capabilities. All of the initial design and development engineering is done in four external sites - Marlborough, MA; St. Petersburg, FL; Towson, MD; and Ft. Wayne, IN - before final specifications are "thrown over the wall" to Largo for production. Because manufacturing is geographically sequestered there are numerous organizational and informational disconnects. Accountability is not easy with four distinct program management offices; each has equally distinct incentives and needs, and expects stellar results from the Largo production staff. Materials normally account for approximately 75 % of the total costs for a standard manufacturing operation. Largo is no different; however its material costs are often even higher than this benchmark for unique reasons. Difficulties arise for Largo in structuring its supply chain agreements because the four design sites have disparate material requirements and harbor unique supplier preferences. A salient symbol of the challenges faced by the site's supply chain management group is {{the millions of dollars}} worth of inventory that sits in the vast <b>factory</b> storeroom. Current <b>inventory</b> floor accuracy is at an unacceptable level of 85. 3 %. (cont.) Getting rid of the inventory monster and its attendant problems is no trivial task, and certainly not one that could be accomplished in a six month LFM internship. But steps were taken to help get the ball rolling in the right direction and to generate some quick wins in the near term. The first phase of the project involved the creation of a novel sourcing agreement with a key CCA supplier. The second phase involved optimizing the replenishment system to minimize material flow, implement pull, and increase material accountability. The final phase involved creation of a financial cost v. benefit model to standardize the site's methodology for making sourcing and partnering decisions in the future. All of these topics are discussed in this thesis as shown in the table of contents. Overview of main internship project tasks: The internship project was scoped to fit within the six and one half month allotted time period and was structured around the main problem points I have just briefly touched upon: 1. Identify optimal candidate supplier and part with potential for significant SMI cost savings. 2. Structure SMI supplier partnership agreement. 3. Implement and automate calculation of kanban system to control inventory 4. Create SMI cost v. benefit tool to prioritize future projects according to expected returns on investment. by Colin Ducharme. Thesis (S. M.)
