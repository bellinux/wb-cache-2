40|$|Two {{response}} precuing {{experiments were}} conducted to investigate effects of musical skill level {{on the ability to}} pre- and re-programme simple movements. Participants successfully used advance information to prepare forthcoming responses and showed response slowing when precue information was invalid rather than valid. This slowing was, however, only observed for partially invalid but not fully invalid precues. Musicians were generally faster than non-musicians, but no group differences in the efficiency of movement pre-programming or re-programming were observed. Interestingly, only musicians exhibited a significant foreperiod lateralized readiness potential (LRP) when response hand was pre-specified or <b>full</b> <b>advance</b> information was provided. These LRP findings suggest increased effector-specific motor preparation in musicians than non-musicians. However, here the levels of effector-specific preparation did not predict preparatory advantages observed in behaviour. In sum, combining the response precuing and ERP paradigms serves a valuable tool to examine influences of musical training on movement pre- or re-programming processes. PostprintPeer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Our event-related {{functional}} MRI (efMRI) study investigates whether visual {{advance information}} (AI) affects rather perceptual or central response-related processing areas. Twelve subjects {{were required to}} make a go/no-go decision to a conjunction of a specific color and motion direction. The stimuli were preceded by a cue, providing 100 % valid advance information about motion direction. Partial and <b>full</b> <b>advance</b> information (PAI and FAI) predicted possible targets, respectively, certain nontargets, neutral cues (NAI) gave no prediction. The time between cue and stimulus (stimulus onset asynchrony, SOA) was varied. A response benefit was found after PAI as compared with NAI. The benefit was small with a short SOA (150 ms), increased with intermediate SOA (450 ms) and sustained with long SOA (750 ms). Perceptual and central processing areas were more active with increasing SOA, but only central response-related processing areas were selectively modulated by cue information. In particular, supplementary motor area and bilateral inferior parietal lobe were more active with PAI than with NAI. If comparing NAI with FAI, more errors were made and activity was larger in central processing areas. Our results suggest that, depending on the processing time, cues providing perceptual information modulate central response-related processes. © 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
