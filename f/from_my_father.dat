In 2004 he was chosen to deliver the keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention. In Obama's 2006 memoir The Audacity of Hope, he recollects that on being chosen to deliver this speech, he pondered the topics on which he had previously campaigned, and on major issues then affecting the nation, before thinking about the variety of people he had met while campaigning, all endeavouring in different ways to improve {{their own lives and}} to serve their country.|$|E

25|$|Born in Franklinton, North Carolina, a small textile {{and tobacco}} town, Harvey grew up {{alongside}} his father who owned his own land, {{which was very}} uncommon for black farmers in the 1930s. When his tenants stole from his property, Harvey’s father lost his land. Refusing to join the sharecropping business, Harvey looked for work in Durham. In 1936, Harvey found {{a job at the}} American Tobacco Company where the segregated unions troubled him. In a journal article about his father, the younger Harvey wrote, “I got my hatred for segregation <b>from</b> <b>my</b> <b>father.</b> He was raised up in the house of a white couple, two liberal lawyers. He learned to always speak up for himself.” In 1943, Harvey worked at the Krueger Bottling Company in Durham where he successfully led efforts to integrate the segregated black and white unions. During the black union protest against the segregated pay scales, forty-four out of the forty-five whites in the plant joined the black union in their strike.|$|E
