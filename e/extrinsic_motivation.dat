25|$|The {{aspect of}} {{motivation}} within a person's personality may predict creativity {{levels in the}} person. Motivation stems from two different sources, intrinsic and <b>extrinsic</b> <b>motivation.</b> Intrinsic motivation is an internal drive within a person to participate or invest {{as a result of}} personal interest, desires, hopes, goals, etc. <b>Extrinsic</b> <b>motivation</b> is a drive from outside of a person and might take the form of payment, rewards, fame, approval from others, etc. Although <b>extrinsic</b> <b>motivation</b> and intrinsic motivation can both increase creativity in certain cases, strictly <b>extrinsic</b> <b>motivation</b> often impedes creativity in people.|$|E
25|$|<b>Extrinsic</b> <b>motivation</b> {{refers to}} the {{performance}} of an activity in order to attain a desired outcome and it is the opposite of intrinsic motivation. <b>Extrinsic</b> <b>motivation</b> comes from influences outside of the individual. In <b>extrinsic</b> <b>motivation,</b> the harder question to answer is where do people get the motivation to carry out and continue to push with persistence. Usually <b>extrinsic</b> <b>motivation</b> is used to attain outcomes that a person wouldn't get from intrinsic motivation. Common extrinsic motivations are rewards (for example money or grades) for showing the desired behavior, and the threat of punishment following misbehavior. Competition is an extrinsic motivator because it encourages the performer to win and to beat others, not simply to enjoy the intrinsic rewards of the activity. A cheering crowd and the desire to win a trophy are also extrinsic incentives.|$|E

40|$|For {{representative}} democracy to work, legislators {{need to be}} responsive {{to the concerns of}} citizens. One way in which this can be achieved is through constituency service. Two factors drive constituency service: <b>extrinsic</b> and intrinsic <b>motivations.</b> Research to date suggests that <b>extrinsic</b> <b>motivations</b> are crucial for constituency service. Yet, this evidence stems primarily from the US context characterized by a personal ballot structure and campaign content which may bias findings in favor of <b>extrinsic</b> <b>motivations.</b> We present evidence from the first ever field experiment conducted in the European Parliament (EP) in which we vary both the <b>extrinsic</b> and intrinsic <b>motivations</b> of legislators. What is more, we are able to examine the way in which intrinsic and <b>extrinsic</b> <b>motivations</b> interact, an aspect largely ignored in the literature. Our findings suggest that while intrinsic motivations matter most for constituency service in the EP, they are dampened by the presence of <b>extrinsic</b> <b>motivations.</b> " (author's abstract...|$|R

Then, as the number of users increases, the system becomes even more valuable and is able to attract a wider user base.|$|E
25|$|The {{self-determination}} theory (SDT) {{was developed}} by psychologists Edward Deci and Richard Ryan. SDT focuses {{on the importance of}} intrinsic and <b>extrinsic</b> <b>motivation</b> in driving human behavior and posits inherent growth and development tendencies. It emphasizes the degree to which an individual's behavior is self-motivated and self-determined. When applied to the realm of education, the self-determination theory is concerned primarily with promoting in students an interest in learning, a value of education, and a confidence in their own capacities and attributes.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} various {{studies on the}} {{connection}} between motivation and games. One particular study was on Taiwanese adolescents and their drive of addiction to games. Two studies {{by the same people}} were conducted. The first study revealed that addicted players showed higher intrinsic than <b>extrinsic</b> <b>motivation</b> and more intrinsic motivation than the non-addicted players. It can then be said that addicted players, according to the studies findings, are more internally motivated to play games. They enjoy the reward of playing. There are studies that also show that motivation gives these players more to look for in the future such as long-lasting experience that they may keep later on in life.|$|E

40|$|A key {{contribution}} of both classical and contemporary humanistic theories is their distinction between intrinsic and <b>extrinsic</b> <b>motivations</b> and drives and their demonstration that psychological well-being is more {{strongly associated with}} the former than the latter. However, such a dimensional-ization {{raises the question of}} how <b>extrinsic</b> <b>motivations</b> and goals emerge; and classic humanistic attempts to account for this tend to contradict some of the basic tenets of humanistic thinking: that human beings are integrated, meaning-seeking agencies consistently striving to maintain and enhance their being. An alternative framework is therefore proposed, a hierarchy of wants, in which <b>extrinsic</b> <b>motivations</b> and goals are seen as attempts—albeit often unsuccessful ones—to reach the highest order, most intrinsic goals. Here, “extrinsic ” motivations and goals are not considered pathogenic, per se, but problematic because of their indirectness and lack of fit to present contexts. This model also suggests that human beings are most likely to achieve a state of well-being when their goals are synergetically related: determined both by the internal configuration of goals and external resources. at PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV on February 18, 2016 jhp. sagepub. comDownloaded fro...|$|R
25|$|Educational {{psychology}} {{research on}} motivation {{is concerned with}} the volition or will that students bring to a task, their level of interest and intrinsic motivation, the personally held goals that guide their behavior, and their belief about the causes of their success or failure. As intrinsic motivation deals with activities that act as their own rewards, <b>extrinsic</b> <b>motivation</b> deals with motivations that are brought on by consequences or punishments. A form of attribution theory developed by Bernard Weiner describes how students' beliefs about the causes of academic success or failure affect their emotions and motivations. For example, when students attribute failure to lack of ability, and ability is perceived as uncontrollable, they experience the emotions of shame and embarrassment and consequently decrease effort and show poorer performance. In contrast, when students attribute failure to lack of effort, and effort is perceived as controllable, they experience the emotion of guilt and consequently increase effort and show improved performance.|$|E

The learner enjoys learning and the acquisition of a foreign language is challenging.

2500|$|As {{important}} as the budget differences are {{to the issue of}} pay for performance, the difference in how federal and private sector employees respond to motivators is even more crucial. Weibel has demonstrated that public servants tend to gravitate more to intrinsic motivation, but two key researchers, Edward L. Deci and Robert Eisenburger, have disagreed as to whether <b>extrinsic</b> <b>motivation</b> is harmful to intrinsically motivated individuals. [...] Deci designed a study that involved college students who were given an [...] "interesting" [...] activity to perform. [...] Some of those students were provided tangible rewards (e.g. money) as an <b>extrinsic</b> <b>motivation</b> and were observed by researchers to see how they reacted. From these studies, Deci argued that some activities provide their own inherent reward, so motivation for such activities is not dependent on external rewards. [...] Deci goes even further to show that when extrinsic rewards are placed on these activities, it is detrimental to performance because it puts a market price on something they already value internally.|$|E
2500|$|In contrast, David McClelland {{believed}} that workers {{could not be}} motivated by the mere need for money—in fact, <b>extrinsic</b> <b>motivation</b> (e.g., money) could extinguish intrinsic motivation such as achievement motivation, though money {{could be used as}} an indicator of success for various motives, e.g., keeping score. In keeping with this view, his consulting firm, McBer & Company, had as its first motto [...] "To make everyone productive, happy, and free." [...] For McClelland, satisfaction lay in aligning a person's life with their fundamental motivations.|$|E
2500|$|Although a {{push for}} {{providing}} <b>extrinsic</b> <b>motivation</b> is still politically popular, research continues to lean toward {{the understanding of}} Deci and Perry—that the public sector is fundamentally different from the private sector. [...] Since those who work for government or non-profit organizations {{are more likely to}} be in the mindset of serving others, they tend to be motivated more intrinsically. [...] They perform tasks because of loyalty or an internalized sense of duty, and/or enjoyment. [...] Giving employees a performance-contingent monetary incentive to do something they already enjoy can decrease his/her motivation to do it as the person is then likely to view its action as externally driven rather than as internally appealing.|$|E
40|$|The article {{provides}} {{insights into the}} driving forces that underpin new forms of political participation. Digital technologies offer opportunities for engaging {{in a wide range}} of civically oriented activities, each of which can contribute to deeper democratic engagement. Conventional acts of political participation are argued to be driven primarily by intrinsic motivations relating to self-efficacy and empowerment with participants feeling they can have influence over decision makers. Little research explores whether similar motivations drive participation in less conventional acts, as well as whether mobilisation attempts via social media by peers or political organisations mediate those motivations. Drawing on data from a survey among a representative sample of the UK electorate, we find the offline and online spheres of agency remain fairly distinct. Intrinsic and <b>extrinsic</b> <b>motivations</b> both matter but <b>extrinsic</b> <b>motivations</b> have the strongest explanatory power independent of the sphere of activity. The mediating effect of mobilisation tactics has a minimal effect on <b>extrinsic</b> <b>motivations,</b> online or offline, but online intrinsic motivations lose their explanatory power. As intrinsic factors offer little explanatory power some forms of online political participation may lack meaning to the individual. Rather, these non-conventional acts result from reward seeking and are more likely to be encouraged by non-governmental campaigning organizations suggesting social media users are most likely to perform simple acts in support of non-contentious causes...|$|R

2500|$|There {{are many}} {{possible}} consequences of POS discussed in Eisenberger and Rhoade's meta-analysis of studies done on POS. [...] The first is organizational commitment. [...] There are {{three kinds of}} organizational commitment: [...] affective commitment, continuance commitment, and normative commitment. [...] Affective commitment, or feeling an emotional tie to one's organization, is important in employees because it demonstrates a deeper meaning for work than simply earning money. [...] Continuance commitment, or knowing that staying with one's organization will be less costly in the end than leaving, is telling of <b>extrinsic</b> <b>motivation</b> to remain wherever one will profit the most. [...] Normative commitment, or feeling compelled to stay because everyone else is, is less significant than the first two [...] but is still considered {{to have an effect}} on employees. [...] Some other consequences of POS include changes in withdrawal behavior, the desire to remain, strains on employees, performance, job related affect, and job related involvement. [...] Levy also discusses absence rates, turnover, and counterproductive behaviors. [...] Changes in these can result in undesired employee action.|$|E
2500|$|Organizational {{rewards and}} job {{conditions}} play {{a large role}} in perceived organizational support as well. [...] Sometimes, <b>extrinsic</b> <b>motivation</b> can mean more to an employee than intrinsic motivation because perceived appreciation has the power to turn a bitter employee into a content employee. [...] Eisenberger and Rhoades discuss the many ways that employers can show appreciation and reward their employees. [...] A few examples are paying their employees fairly; recognizing their employees for new ideas, exceptional work, etc.; promoting their employees when they deserve it; providing job security as incentive to remain with the organization; encouraging autonomy to correspondingly increase production and morale; reduce stress when made aware of it; and to provide proper training, to ensure employees' confidence in their jobs. [...] Some of these factors carry less weight than others do. [...] Being autonomous increases an employee's desire to continue to remain loyal to his or her organization because if he feels competent and confident in his ability to do well, he will be less likely to give up or lose faith.|$|E
