5|$|At {{the same}} time, the {{regulation}} of <b>interstate</b> <b>commerce,</b> especially as concerned the railroads, was a political issue. The call for regulation of the railroads divided the nation's business interests, with railroads working against legislation and manufacturers, who were aggrieved by high railroad rates, joining the reformers. Standard Oil joined the latter group in calling for Congressional action. In 1886, Payne voted for {{a bill that would}} reform railroad rates slightly, but was considered ineffective by reformers. After amendments by the House, however, the bill returned to the Senate with more substantive prohibitions on the practices consumers and manufacturers found most egregious. Payne voted against the strengthened <b>Interstate</b> <b>Commerce</b> Act, which passed and was signed into law by President Grover Cleveland. In explaining his vote, Payne said that the law was impractical and unfairly advantaged other methods of shipping (such as boat transportation on the Great Lakes) over the railroads.|$|E
5|$|In 1892, the <b>Interstate</b> <b>Commerce</b> Commission {{agreed with}} the city after it filed a {{complaint}} about these practices, but that decision was struck down by a federal court. In 1906, Spokane sued under the newly passed Hepburn Act, and won on July 24, 1911.|$|E
5|$|Initially conservative, {{working with}} Wilson (who was elected president) {{inspired}} Barkley {{to become more}} liberal. On April 24, 1912, he first spoke on the House floor, favoring the administration-backed Underwood–Simmons Tariff Act which lowered tariffs on foreign goods. He endorsed Wilson's New Freedom agenda, including the 1913 Federal Reserve Act and the 1914 Federal Trade Commission Act. Because of {{his support for the}} administration, he was assigned to the powerful Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee and became the first freshman to preside over a session of the House. As a member of the <b>Interstate</b> <b>Commerce</b> Commission, he supported the Clayton Antitrust Act and sought to end child labor in <b>interstate</b> <b>commerce</b> through the Keating–Owen Act in 1916. He also supported measures to extend credit to and fund road improvements in rural areas.|$|E

The first was to become Territorial Governor of Hawaii; the other was an appointment to the <b>Interstate</b> <b>Commerce</b> Commission. Knott served as a special assistant to Kentucky's attorney general in 1887 and 1888, and in 1891, he was chosen as a delegate to the state constitutional convention.|$|E
5|$|For some time, {{there had}} been concern {{about the power of}} the railroads and the way they charged {{different}} rates for different customers. In 1885, a bill to regulate the practice, authored by John Henninger Reagan, of Texas passed the House. The Reagan bill forbade discrimination in railroad or pipeline freight rates, required that rates be reasonable, and fixed maximum charges allowed. Sherman agreed with the general idea of the law, but objected to certain portions, especially a provision that gave state courts jurisdiction over enforcement disputes. Sherman believed the law should allow for more nuance as well, insisting that competition against other forms of transit be considered. These changes were adopted in the conference committee and the result, the <b>Interstate</b> <b>Commerce</b> Act of 1887, owed much to Sherman's influence. Cleveland signed it into law on February 4, 1887, and appointed members to the new <b>Interstate</b> <b>Commerce</b> Commission. The act displeased the railroad industry, but was a boon to farmers and the oil industry.|$|E

5|$|The last OE {{service to}} this station {{operated}} on June 19, 1931, {{after the company}} requested, and received, permission from the <b>Interstate</b> <b>Commerce</b> Commission to abandon that section of route because of declining ridership and worsening traffic congestion. The service was cut back to Front and Jefferson streets the following day, and OE moved its ticket office to that location. The tracks along 10th and Salmon streets were abandoned and soon removed. Just two years later, in May 1933, the Oregon Electric discontinued all its remaining passenger service, becoming exclusively a freight railroad.|$|E

5|$|In 1938, the now-abolished <b>Interstate</b> <b>Commerce</b> Commission (ICC) {{enforced}} {{the first}} HOS rules. Drivers {{were limited to}} 12hours of work within a 15-hour period. Work was defined as loading, unloading, driving, handling freight, preparing reports, preparing vehicles for service, or performing any other duty pertaining to the transportation of passengers or property. The ICC intended the 3-hour difference between 15hours on-duty and 12hours {{of work to be}} used for meals and rest breaks. The weekly maximum was limited to 60hours over 7days (non-daily drivers), or 70hours over 8days (daily drivers). These rules allowed for 12hours of work within a 15-hour period, 9hours of rest, with 3hours for breaks within a 24-hour day.|$|E
5|$|John Marshall Harlan {{was born}} on May 20, 1899 in Chicago, Illinois. He {{was the son of}} John Maynard Harlan, a Chicago lawyer and politician, and Elizabeth Flagg. He had three sisters. Historically, Harlan's family had been {{politically}} active. His forebear, George Harlan, served as one of governors of Delaware during the seventeenth century; his great-grandfather, James Harlan, was a congressman during the 1830s; his grandfather, also John Marshall Harlan, was an associate justice of the United States Supreme Court from 1877 to 1911; and his uncle, James S. Harlan, was attorney general of Puerto Rico and then chairman of the <b>Interstate</b> <b>Commerce</b> Commission.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the ensuing}} decades, the Erie Railroad fell into debt {{along with its}} competitor, the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad. On September 16, 1960, the <b>Interstate</b> <b>Commerce</b> Commission {{approved}} the railroads {{to go forward with}} a merger, creating the new Erie-Lackawanna Railroad on October 15, 1960. The new railroad lasted only 16 years. In 1976, the Erie Lackawanna and several other large railroad companies were merged into the newly formed federal Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail). At this point, stations had to fight for survival. The station depot at Harriman has been closed and boarded up since at least 1970. Passenger train service, however, remained intact through the early 1980s.|$|E

5|$|Taft {{appointed}} 13 {{judges to}} the federal courts of appeal and 38 to the United States district courts. Taft also appointed judges to various specialized courts, including the first five appointees each to the United States Commerce Court and the United States Court of Customs Appeals. The Commerce Court, created in 1910, stemmed from a Taft proposal for a specialized court to hear appeals from the <b>Interstate</b> <b>Commerce</b> Commission. There was considerable opposition to its establishment, which only grew when one of its judges, Robert W. Archbald, was in 1912 impeached for corruption and removed by the Senate the following January. Taft vetoed a bill to abolish the court, but the respite was short-lived as Wilson signed similar legislation in October 1913.|$|E
5|$|The {{reconstruction}} of NY205 transformed the road {{into the main}} north–south connection between West Oneonta and Oaksville. At the same time, the parallel Southern New York Railroad had become unprofitable as the highways running alongside the track had become more appealing to shippers and travelers than the railroad itself. In 1940, the railroad abandoned the section of its line between West Oneonta and Jordanville, Herkimer County. The track ran alongside state routes {{for most of its}} length, and the presence of NY205 and NY167 was noted as a contributing factor to the line's demise in the railroad's abandonment petition to the <b>Interstate</b> <b>Commerce</b> Commission.|$|E
5|$|Berkshire Division service {{began to}} decline before World War II, when {{increased}} automobile availability reduced the appeal of travel by train. The line had always used the oldest equipment on the railroad, and all trains except one weekly round trip lost their parlor cars in 1940 and 1942. In January 1960, profitable railway post office service was ended due to unsuitable schedules, and starting in March 1960 all trains except two weekend through round trips were run by single Budd RDCs and truncated to Danbury where passengers could change for local trains to New York. In November 1960, the New Haven moved its station services from Union Station to a converted freight house slightly to the east to save money, leaving the B alone in the station. In March 1964, the <b>Interstate</b> <b>Commerce</b> Commission authorized the NYNH to cut all Berkshire Division services except the weekend trips.|$|E

5|$|Serving as Secretary of the Treasury in the {{administration}} of Rutherford B. Hayes, Sherman continued his efforts for financial stability and solvency, overseeing an end to wartime inflationary measures and a return to gold-backed money. He returned to the Senate after his term expired, serving there for a further sixteen years. During that time he continued his work on financial legislation, as well as writing and debating laws on immigration, business competition law, and the regulation of <b>interstate</b> <b>commerce.</b> Sherman was the principal author of the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, which was signed into law by President Benjamin Harrison. In 1897, President William McKinley appointed him Secretary of State. Failing health and declining faculties made him unable to handle the burdens of the job, and he retired in 1898 {{at the start of the}} Spanish–American War. Sherman died at his home in Washington, D.C. in 1900.|$|E
5|$|Standard Oil {{moved its}} {{headquarters}} to New York City at 26 Broadway, and Rockefeller became {{a central figure}} in the city's business community. He bought a residence in 1884 on 54th Street near the mansions of other magnates such as William Henry Vanderbilt. Despite personal threats and constant pleas for charity, Rockefeller took the new elevated train to his downtown office daily. In 1887, Congress created the <b>Interstate</b> <b>Commerce</b> Commission which was tasked with enforcing equal rates for all railroad freight, but by then Standard depended more on pipeline transport. More threatening to Standard's power was the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, originally used to control unions, but later central to {{the breakup of the}} Standard Oil trust. Ohio was especially vigorous in applying its state anti-trust laws, and finally forced a separation of Standard Oil of Ohio {{from the rest of the}} company in 1892, the first step in the dissolution of the trust.|$|E
5|$|The delegates {{voted to}} address the {{platform}} before deciding on nominees, and debate began when they reconvened at 8:45p.m. Many fights and compromises had been hashed out in the Resolutions Committee already, but the delegates insisted on debating several provisions. On many planks, there was widespread agreement among the delegates. On the monetary issue, the platform declared that all money, whether metal or paper, should be issued by the government, not by banks (as was common for paper money at the time). They also called for the unlimited coinage of silver and the repayment of the national debt in bonds, rather than gold dollars. Other planks of the platform called for a graduated income tax, laws to mandate safe working conditions in factories, the regulation of <b>interstate</b> <b>commerce,</b> {{and an end to}} child and convict labor; all of these were familiar parts of Greenback platforms from earlier elections, and provoked no serious dissent.|$|E
