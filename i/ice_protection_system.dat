25|$|The {{commission}} {{rejected that}} the aircraft {{did not have}} a sufficiently potent <b>ice</b> <b>protection</b> <b>system,</b> stating that the Heron's were equipped with a better system than comparable aircraft. It was of the opinion that no contemporary ice protections systems would have been capable of de-icing the aircraft in the conditions. They found no faults with the pilot's actions. It also recommended that airlines equip aircraft with additional first-aid and survival equipment.|$|E
40|$|Thermal <b>ice</b> <b>protection</b> <b>systems</b> use {{heat energy}} {{to prevent a}} {{dangerous}} buildup of ice on an aircraft. As aircraft become more efficient, less heat energy is available to operate a thermal <b>ice</b> <b>protections</b> <b>system.</b> This requires that thermal <b>ice</b> <b>protection</b> <b>systems</b> be designed to more exacting standards so as to more efficiently prevent a dangerous ice buildup without adversely affecting aircraft safety. While the effects of altitude have always beeing taked into account {{in the design of}} thermal <b>ice</b> <b>protection</b> <b>systems,</b> a better understanding of these effects is needed so as to enable more exact design, testing, and evaluation of these systems...|$|R

25|$|The flight {{departed}} Værnes at 8:30. It {{climbed to}} a cruising altitude of 2,500meters (8,000ft) and passed Tolga Radio Beacon at 09:12. In {{the area around}} Røros the aircraft started experiencing icing, which quickly rose to levels {{which could not be}} handled by the <b>ice</b> <b>protection</b> <b>system.</b> In addition, the aircraft was subject to a downdraft. The pilots therefore chose to turn the aircraft around and return to Trondheim. However, the icing was so aggressive that the aircraft continued to lose elevation. It was flying through a blizzard and there was poor sight, making navigation difficult.|$|E
25|$|The Scorpion {{had flown}} 76.4 hours in 41 test flights by 19 May 2014; no planned flights were {{cancelled}} due to mechanical or maintenance issues. Incremental improvements {{were to be}} made to the aircraft over the course of testing. Participation in the Farnborough International Airshow in 2014 accelerated changes; modifications included an engine inlet <b>ice</b> <b>protection</b> <b>system</b> and a metal inlet leading edge in place of the composite one for flying in a broader range of weather conditions, a cockpit ladder so the pilot does not need a ground crew ladder, an onboard oxygen-generating system in place of oxygen bottles, and other non-urgent items. The modified Scorpion resumed flights on 1 June 2014. In July 2014, the Scorpion made its first public appearance at Farnborough Airshow.|$|E
25|$|The NH90 can be {{equipped}} with various mission-specific systems, including modular armor plating around the cabin area for undertaking high-risk missions and an <b>ice</b> <b>protection</b> <b>system</b> for operations within cold climates. It can also {{make use of the}} In-Hover Flight Refuelling System (HIFR) as well as additional internal and external fuel tanks to conduct extended range missions. Other equipment includes a wire strike protection system, rappelling system, hoist, cargo hook, search light and various seating options, including crashworthy foldable seats. For performing maritime operations, such tasked NH90s are typically equipped with the Harpoon deck-locking system, automatic main rotor blade and tail folding mechanisms, and other deck handling systems to conduct all-weather ship-borne operations; it is also typically outfitted with dipping sonar and sonobuoy processing equipment.|$|E
40|$|Research {{activity}} is described for: <b>ice</b> <b>protection</b> <b>systems,</b> <b>icing</b> instrumentation, experimental methods, analytical modeling for the above, and in flight research. The {{renewed interest in}} aircraft icing has come about {{because of the new}} need for All-Weather Helicopters and General Aviation aircraft. Because of increased fuel costs, tomorrow's Commercial Transport aircraft will also require new types of <b>ice</b> <b>protection</b> <b>systems</b> and better estimates of the aeropenalties caused by ice on unprotected surfaces. The physics of aircraft icing is very similar to the icing that occurs on ground structures and structures at sea; all involve droplets that freeze on the surfaces because of the cold air. Therefore all icing research groups will benefit greatly by sharing their research information...|$|R
50|$|Ice {{accumulation}} on {{the leading}} edge (lip) of engine inlets causes flow problems and can lead to ice ingestion. In turbofan engines, laminar airflow is required at the face of the fan.

25|$|The cockpit {{design of}} the TBM strives to be {{user-friendly}} and as uncomplicated to operate as possible. For pilot convenience, an automatic fuel selector automatically switches between fuel tanks periodically to effortlessly maintain fuel balance throughout flight; manual selection of fuel tanks is also possible, which remains overseen by a low fuel warning system. The <b>ice</b> <b>protection</b> <b>system</b> is as automated as possible, the windshield being electrically heated, the air inlet being kept warm by engine exhaust and the de-ice boots automatically cycling once activated. The electrically actuated flaps are monitored by a sophisticated split-flap protection system to prevent asymmetric deployment. An onboard air data computer calculates various values to support the pilot, such as the aircraft's true air speed, wind, and power advisory notices based upon current external temperature and altitude.|$|E
2500|$|Braathens SAFE Flight 253, {{also known}} as the Hummelfjell Accident (...) , {{occurred}} on 7 November 1956 at 9:50, when a de Havilland Heron crashed into the mountain Hummelfjell in Tolga, Norway. The Braathens SAFE aircraft was en route from Trondheim Airport, Værnes to Oslo Airport, Fornebu. While passing Røros the Heron started experiencing a rapidly accelerating atmospheric icing which soon was too extensive for the <b>ice</b> <b>protection</b> <b>system</b> to handle. Combined with downdraft, the aircraft lost sufficient lift to stay airborne. The pilots were able to turn around the aircraft, but it hit Hummelfjell at an altitude of [...] above mean sea level.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2010 Cirrus {{confirmed}} that the project {{does not have a}} timeline for certification or deliveries. CEO Brent Wouters stated: [...] "It's a function of cash flow ... We will get the program done as soon as humanly possible." [...] As of January 2010 the company had 428 position holders, with orders increasing at about one to two per week. The test aircraft had accumulated 236 hours. [...] Also in January 2010 some parameters for the jet's design were confirmed. The aircraft will be certified for FL280. It will have a hybrid <b>ice</b> <b>protection</b> <b>system</b> consisting of urethane pneumatic boots. The cabin pressurization will be contained within a single-piece carbon shell.

40|$|The {{aeronautics}} {{industry is}} looking for <b>ice</b> <b>protection</b> <b>systems</b> consuming less energy. Electromechanical and especially piezoelectric solutions are a promising area of research for reducing average consumptions. This article provides an analytical model of a simple structure to assess the power and voltage required to obtain the delamination of the accumulated layer of ice at the support/ice interface. This model also allows analyzing {{the impact of the}} resonance frequencies used for supplying piezoelectric actuators on the tensile stress into PZT materials. Finally, this article assesses the effect of different ice-phobic coatings combined with piezoelectric <b>ice</b> <b>protection</b> <b>systems.</b> Experimental measurements of ice adhesion for different ice-phobic coatings allow evaluating the shear stress at which ice is detached from the surface. These results are then used to estimate - thanks to the proposed analytical model - the additional gain of power that would be provided by the use of such coatings...|$|R
50|$|Atmospheric icing {{occurs when}} water {{droplets}} {{in the atmosphere}} freeze on objects they contact. This can be extremely dangerous to aircraft, as the built-up ice changes the aerodynamics of the flight surfaces, which can {{increase the risk of}} a subsequent stalling of the airfoil. For this reason, <b>ice</b> <b>protection</b> <b>systems</b> are often considered critical components of flight, and aircraft are often deiced prior to take-off in icy environments.|$|R

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of liquid <b>ice</b> <b>protection</b> <b>systems</b> which distribute a glycol-water solution onto leading edge surfaces through a porous skin was demonstrated in tests {{conducted in the}} NASA Lewis icing research tunnel using a composite porous leading edge panels. The data obtained were compared {{with the performance of}} previously tested stainless steel leading edge with the same geometry. Results show: (1) anti-ice protection of a composite leading edge is possible for all the simulated conditions tested; (2) the glycol flow rates required to achieve anti-ice protection were generally much higher than those required for a stainless steel panel; (3) the low reservoir pressures of the glycol during test runs indicates that more uniform distribution of glycol, and therefore lower glycol flow rates, can probably be achieved by decreasing the porosity of the panel; and (4) significant weight savings can be achieved in fluid <b>ice</b> <b>protection</b> <b>systems</b> with composite porous leading edges. The resistance of composite panels to abrasion and erosion must yet be determined before they can be incorporated in production systems...|$|R
25|$|The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) {{determined}} {{that the cause of}} the accident was pilot error.
