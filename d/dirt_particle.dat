50|$|Kellar Autumn and his {{research}} group have conducted experiments to test and demonstrate this {{ability of the}} gecko. They also use the contact mechanical model to suggest that self-cleaning occurs by an energetic disequilibrium between the adhesive forces attracting a <b>dirt</b> <b>particle</b> to the substrate and those attracting the same particle {{to one or more}} spatulae. In other words, the Van der Waals interaction energy for the particle-wall system requires a sufficiently great number of particle-spatula systems to counterbalance; however, relatively few spatulae can actually attach to a single particle, therefore the contaminant particles tend to attach to the substrate surface rather than the gecko's toe due to this disequilibrium. Figure on the right shows the model of interaction between N spatulas, a <b>dirt</b> <b>particle</b> and a planar wall.|$|E
50|$|Dirt {{particles}} with {{an extremely}} reduced contact area are {{picked up by}} water droplets and are thus easily cleaned off the surface. If a water droplet rolls across such a contaminated surface the adhesion between the <b>dirt</b> <b>particle,</b> irrespective of its chemistry, and the droplet is higher than between the particle and the surface. As this self-cleaning effect {{is based on the}} high surface tension of water it does not work with organic solvents. Therefore, the hydrophobicity of a surface is no protection against graffiti.|$|E

40|$|Surface {{cleaning}} using {{cavitation bubble}} dynamics is investigated numerically through modeling of bubble dynamics, <b>dirt</b> <b>particle</b> motion, and fluid material interaction. Three fluid dynamics models; a potential flow model, a viscous model, and a compressible model, {{are used to}} describe the flow field generated by the bubble all showing the strong effects bubble explosive growth and collapse have on a <b>dirt</b> <b>particle</b> and on a layer of material to remove. Bubble deformation and reentrant jet formation are seen to be responsible for generating concentrated pressures, shear, and lift forces on the <b>dirt</b> <b>particle</b> and high impulsive loads on a layer of material to remove. Bubble explosive growth is also an important mechanism for removal of dirt particles, since strong suction forces in addition to shear are generated around the explosively growing bubble and can exert strong forces lifting the particles from the surface to clean and sucking them toward the bubble. To model material failure and removal, a finite element structure code is used and enables simulation of full fluid-structure interaction and investigation of the effects of various parameters. High impulsive pressures are generated during bubble collapse due to the impact of the bubble reentrant jet on the material surface and the subsequent collapse of the resulting toroidal bubble. Pits and material removal develop on the material surface when th...|$|E
40|$|Dirt {{counting}} and <b>dirt</b> <b>particle</b> characterisation of pulp samples is {{an important}} part of quality control in pulp and paper production. The need for an automatic image analysis system to consider <b>dirt</b> <b>particle</b> characterisation in various pulp samples is also very critical. However, existent image analysis systems utilise a single threshold to segment the dirt particles in different pulp samples. This limits their precision. Based on evidence, designing an automatic image analysis system that could overcome this deficiency is very useful. In this study, the developed Niblack thresholding method is proposed. The method defines the threshold based on the number of segmented particles. In addition, the Kittler thresholding is utilised. Both of these thresholding methods can determine the dirt count of the different pulp samples accurately as compared to visual inspection and the Digital Optical Measuring and Analysis System (DOMAS). In addition, the minimum resolution needed for acquiring a scanner image is defined. By considering the variation in <b>dirt</b> <b>particle</b> features, the curl shows acceptable difference to discriminate the bark and the fibre bundles in different pulp samples. Three classifiers, called k-Nearest Neighbour, Linear Discriminant Analysis and Multi-layer Perceptron are utilised to categorize the dirt particles. Linear Discriminant Analysis and Multi-layer Perceptron are the most accurate in classifying the segmented dirt particles by the Kittler thresholding with morphological processing. The result shows that the dirt particles are successfully categorized for bark and for fibre bundles...|$|E

40|$|In the {{evaluation}} of dirt inclusions in paper, the attention is paid {{not only to the}} quantity of dirt but also to the type of dirt particles. Automatic classification methods can be designed for the task, but there should also exist proper evaluation data to truthfully compare the methods. For such comprehensive evaluations, reliable ground truth is essential. To get suitable samples of paper with expert-annotated dirt particles in each can be considered as a too complicated, laborious, and time-consuming task. In the present work, laboratory personnel produced pulp and dirt particles for the samples as pure as possible. Consequently, the initial data was provided as a set of paper sheets with a single dirt type in each. In order to combine dirt particles of different types in one image of a paper sheet and to know the exact location and the type of the particles, a semisynthetic method for generating the ground truth was developed. This paper introduces the algorithm for the purpose. It is shown how the background for <b>dirt</b> <b>particle</b> images is generated, what is the principle of <b>dirt</b> <b>particle</b> placing over the background, and how the problem of color normalization is solved. Finally, the generated background is statistically evaluated, and segmentation result of the dirt particles is used to estimate the quality of the semisynthetic images. ...|$|E
40|$|In dry {{attachment}} {{systems of}} spiders and geckos, van der Waals forces mediate attraction between substrate and animal tarsus. In particular, the scopula of Evarcha arcuata spiders allows for reversible attachment and easy detachment {{to a broad}} range of surfaces. Hence, reproducing the scopula’s roughness compatibility while maintaining anti-bunching features and <b>dirt</b> <b>particle</b> repellence behavior is a central task for a biomimetic transfer to an engineered model. In the present work we model the scopula of E. arcuata from a mechano-elastic point of view analyzing the influence of its hierarchical structure on the attachment behavior. By considering biological data of the gecko and spider, and the simulation results, the adhesive capabilities of the two animals are compared and important confirmations and new directives in order to reproduce the overall structure are found. Moreover, a possible suggestion of how the spider detaches in an easy and fast manner is proposed and supported by the results...|$|E
40|$|A {{tokay gecko}} can cling to {{virtually}} any surface and support its body mass {{with a single}} toe by using the millions of keratinous setae on its toe pads. Each seta branches into hundreds of 200 -nm spatulae that make intimate contact {{with a variety of}} surface profiles. We showed previously that the combined surface area of billions of spatulae maximizes van der Waals interactions to generate large adhesive and shear forces. Geckos are not known to groom their feet yet retain their stickiness for months between molts. How geckos manage to keep their feet clean while walking about with sticky toes has remained a puzzle until now. Although self-cleaning by water droplets occurs in plant and animal surfaces, no adhesive has been shown to self-clean. In the present study, we demonstrate that gecko setae are a self-cleaning adhesive. Geckos with dirty feet recovered their ability to cling to vertical surfaces after only a few steps. Self-cleaning occurred in arrays of setae isolated from the gecko. Contact mechanical models suggest that self-cleaning occurs by an energetic disequilibrium between the adhesive forces attracting a <b>dirt</b> <b>particle</b> to the substrate and those attracting the same particle to one or more spatulae. We propose that the property of self-cleaning is intrinsic to the setal nanostructure and therefore should be replicable in synthetic adhesive materials in the future...|$|E

Consequently, methods to characterize their three dimensional shapes must become more sophisticated, too.

While being defined and meaningful for arbitrary particles, the characteristics were actually selected motivated by the application to technical cleanliness. Residual <b>dirt</b> <b>particles</b> can seriously harm mechanical components in vehicles, machines, or medical instruments. 3 d geometric characterization based on micro-computed tomography allows to detect dangerous particles reliably and with high throughput.
