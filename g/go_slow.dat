500|$|Developers {{originally}} intended for players to be permanently {{out of a}} race when falling far off a track, however they {{came to realize that}} it was not fun for players [...] "to be forced to <b>go</b> <b>slow</b> or suffer an instant defeat." [...] An attempt was made to give three [...] "strikes" [...] to a rider. [...] Once the rider fell for the third time they were out of the race. [...] However once implemented developers noticed that the number of racers remaining {{at the end of the}} race was too random to be deemed any fun. [...] In the end the decision was made to simply respawn the character on the track. The PC version was ported in large part by John Olsen, who worked on the port as his first task at SingleTrac. [...] The PC version also features 3Dfx hardware acceleration, which allows for higher resolution gameplay and visual enhancements such as reflective water. [...] Axiom Design created the user interface shell for the game, which has a comic book-inspired feel. The music for Jet Moto was produced by Big Idea Music Productions.|$|E
500|$|An {{affidavit}} {{was filed}} in the Supreme Court {{on the basis of}} a report on testimony of suspended IPS officer Sanjiv Bhatt that Modi ordered top police officers not to take active actions in the riots. Bhatt said that on the night of 27 February 2002, Modi said that [...] "Hindus must be allowed to carry out retaliatory violence against Muslims." [...] The report filed by Raju Ramachandran, a Supreme Court lawyer and an amicus curiae, alleged that Modi [...] "gave instructions to top police officers to <b>go</b> <b>slow</b> on rioters". On 7 May 2012, Ramachandran said that Modi can be prosecuted under sections 153 A (1) (a) & (b), 153 B (1), 166 and 505 (2) of the Indian Penal Code for promoting enmity among different groups during the 2002 Gujarat riots, including the Naroda incident. The Special Investigation Team criticised the amicus report for relying heavily on Bhatt's testimony, who according to the Special Investigation Team (SIT) was an [...] "unreliable witness" [...] as he remained silent for nine years. The report was rejected by the team and according to the SIT, [...] "No case can be made out against Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi in connection with the 2002 communal riots under any of the Sections of the Indian Penal Code mentioned by him [...] ".|$|E

2500|$|One of the {{farthest}} reaching {{consequences of the}} war was the wide-scale economic slowdown in Pakistan. The war ended the impressive economic growth Pakistan had experienced since the early 1960s. Between 1964 and 1966, Pakistan's defence spending rose from 4.82% to 9.86% of GDP, putting a tremendous strain on Pakistan's economy. By 1970–71, defence spending comprised a whopping 55.66% of government expenditure. According to veterans of the war, the war greatly cost Pakistan economically, politically, and militarily. [...] Nuclear theorist Feroze Khan maintained that the 1965 war was a last conventional attempt to snatch Kashmir by military force, and Pakistan's own position in the international community, especially with the United States, began to deteriorate from the point the war started, while on the other hand, the alliance with China saw improvements. Chairman joint chiefs General Tariq Majid claims in his memoirs that Chou En-Lai had longed advised the government in the classic style of Sun Tzu: [...] "to <b>go</b> <b>slow,</b> not to push India hard; and avoid a fight over Kashmir, 'for at least, 20–30 years, until you have developed your economy and consolidated your national power'." [...] General Majid maintained in Eating Grass that the [...] "sane, philosophical and political critical thinking" [...] was missing in Pakistan, and that the country had lost extensive human resources by fighting the war.|$|E
