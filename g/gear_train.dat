5|$|The first geared {{clock was}} invented in the 11th century by the Arab {{engineer}} Ibn Khalaf al-Muradi in Islamic Iberia; it was a water clock that employed a complex <b>gear</b> <b>train</b> mechanism, including both segmental and epicyclic gearing, capable of transmitting high torque. The clock was unrivalled in its use of sophisticated complex gearing, until the mechanical clocks of the mid-14th century. Al-Muradi's clock also employed the use of mercury in its hydraulic linkages, which could function mechanical automata. Al-Muradi's work was known to scholars working under Alfonso X of Castile, hence the mechanism {{may have played a}} role in the development of the European mechanical clocks. Other monumental water clocks constructed by medieval Muslim engineers also employed complex gear trains and arrays of automata. Like the earlier Greeks and Chinese, Arab engineers at the time also developed a liquid-driven escapement mechanism which they employed in some of their water clocks. Heavy floats were used as weights and a constant-head system was used as an escapement mechanism, which was present in the hydraulic controls they used to make heavy floats descend at a slow and steady rate.|$|E

40|$|To date, {{most of the}} multi-DOF (degree-of-freedom) {{epicyclic}} <b>gear</b> <b>trains</b> {{have been}} used as a series of one-DOF devices. Comparatively little is known with regard to the existence and synthesis of true multi-DOF epicyclic <b>gear</b> <b>trains.</b> This paper presents a systematic methodology for the identification and enumeration of the kinematic structure of true multiDOF epicyclic <b>gear</b> <b>trains.</b> It has been shown that there exist no true two-DOF epicyclic <b>gear</b> <b>trains</b> with five or less links and, that there exist two nonisomorphic rotation graphs of six vertices and twenty nonisomorphic rotation graphs of seven vertices. An atlas of nonisomorphic displacement graphs which can be used to construct true two-DOF epicyclic <b>gear</b> <b>trains</b> with six and seven links has been developed. It is hoped that this atlas will lead to more optimum and efficient designs of machines with multiple actuating requirements such as robotic wrists, grippers and walking machines...|$|R

25|$|The planisphere was a {{star chart}} invented by Abū Rayḥān al-Bīrūnī in the early 11th century. The {{astrolabe}} was invented in the Hellenistic world in either the 1st or 2nd centuries BC and is often attributed to Hipparchus. A combination of the planisphere and dioptra, the astrolabe was effectively an analog computer capable of working out several {{different kinds of problems}} in spherical astronomy. An astrolabe incorporating a mechanical calendar computer and gear-wheels was invented by Abi Bakr of Isfahan, Persia in 1235. Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī invented the first mechanical geared lunisolar calendar astrolabe, an early fixed-wired knowledge processing machine with a <b>gear</b> <b>train</b> and gear-wheels, circa 1000 AD.

25|$|All 567 engines utilize forced induction, {{with either}} a Roots blower or a {{turbocharger}}. The turbocharger (a combination turbo-compressor system) follows EMD's innovative design that uses a <b>gear</b> <b>train</b> and over-running clutch to drive the compressor rotor during low engine speed, when exhaust gas temperature (and, correspondingly, heat energy) alone is insufficient to drive the turbine. At higher engine speeds, increased exhaust gas temperature is sufficient to drive the turbine and the clutch disengages, turning the turbo-compressor system into a true turbocharger. The turbo-compressor can revert to compressor mode momentarily during demands for large increases in engine output power. While more expensive to maintain than Roots blowers, the turbocharger significantly reduces fuel consumption and emissions, while improving high-altitude performance. Additionally, EMD's turbo-compressor can provide a 50 percent increase in maximum rated horsepower over Roots-blown engines for the same engine displacement.|$|E
25|$|Turbochargers {{are also}} {{employed}} in certain two-stroke cycle diesel engines, which would normally require a Roots blower for aspiration. In this specific application, mainly Electro-Motive diesel (EMD) 567, 645, and 710 Series engines, the turbocharger is initially {{driven by the}} engine's crankshaft through a <b>gear</b> <b>train</b> and an overrunning clutch, thereby providing aspiration for combustion. After combustion has been achieved, and after the exhaust gases have reached sufficient heat energy, the overrunning clutch is automatically disengaged, and the turbo-compressor is thereafter driven exclusively by the exhaust gases. In the EMD application, the turbocharger acts as a compressor for normal aspiration during starting and low power output settings and is used for true turbocharging during medium and high power output settings. This is particularly beneficial at high altitudes, as are often encountered on western U.S. railroads. It is possible for the turbocharger to revert to compressor mode momentarily during commands for large increases in engine power.|$|E
