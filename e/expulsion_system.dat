50|$|The German Type 212 {{submarine}} uses a {{new development}} of the water ram <b>expulsion</b> <b>system,</b> which ejects the torpedo with water pressure to avoid acoustic detection.|$|E
50|$|Currently, the Type 212A {{is capable}} of {{launching}} the fiber optic-guided DM2A4 Seehecht ("Seahake") heavyweight torpedoes, the WASS BlackShark torpedoes and short-range missiles from its six torpedo tubes, which use a water ram <b>expulsion</b> <b>system.</b> Future capability may include tube-launched cruise missiles.|$|E
50|$|The Flettner rotor {{utilized}} the delayed action dissemination technique (DADT) fuse. This type of fuse has two functions. The {{first is that}} the internal fuse can initiate the gas <b>expulsion</b> <b>system</b> {{in the event of}} tampering, or certain environmental conditions. This DADT fuse also self-destructs after three days if the munition fails to dispense its agent on impact as designed. Fuses incorporating self-destruct mechanisms are considerably more expensive than traditional fuses.|$|E
5000|$|Hybrid Electro-Mechanical <b>Expulsion</b> Deicing <b>Systems</b> combine an EMEDS de-icer with an {{electrical}} heating element anti-icer. The heater prevents ice accumulation {{on the leading}} edge of the airfoil and the actuators of the EMED system remove ice that accumulates aft of the heated portion of the airfoil. [...] Cox and Company, Inc. of Plainview, NY has developed multiple versions of Hybrid EMED systems referred to as Thermo-Mechanical <b>Expulsion</b> Deicing <b>System</b> (TMEDS).|$|R
40|$|Aerospace {{applications}} of elastomers are considered, including: propellant binders, bladder materials for liquid propellant <b>expulsion</b> <b>systems,</b> and fuel tank sealants for high-speed aircraft. A comprehensive molecular theory for mechanical properties {{of these materials}} has been developed but has only been tested experimentally in cases where chemical degradation processes are excluded. Hence, a study is being conducted to ascertain the nature, extent, and rate of chemical changes {{that take place in}} some elastomers of interest. Chemical changes that may take place in the fluorosilicone elastomer, LS 420, which is regarded as a fuel and high-temperature-resistant rubber are investigated. The kinetic analysis of the chemical stress relaxation and gel permeation chromatography studies comprise the major portion of the report...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of single-phase storage and <b>expulsion</b> <b>systems</b> as affected by temperature variations within the stored cryogen which are generated during heat transfer is discussed. Peculiar operating responses are indicated by spontaneous changes in fluid pressure which accompany g level changes, increased heater surface temperature, and durations of pressure cycles which differ considerably from {{that which is}} computed for an isothermal cryogen. The nonisothermal characteristics are predicted with a numerical model which includes the simultaneous solution of the time dependent conservation equations of mass, energy, and momentum in two space dimensions of Cartesian coordinates for boundary conditions which approximate those of the flight cryogenic system. The methodology of the numerical method and some comparisons between the predictions and the Apollo 12 flight data are included...|$|R

Ascent and injection guidance and {{attitude control}} are provided by the Agena spacecraft with a gyrocompassed mass <b>expulsion</b> <b>system.</b> On-orbit attitude control functions are performed by a system that has its functional roots in the gravity-gradient momentum bias technology. The paper discusses hardware, control laws, and simulation results...|$|E
40|$|Vigorous {{efforts to}} reduce costs, coupled with changes in LST guidelines, {{took place in the}} Fall of 1974. These events made a new design of the LST and its Pointing and Attitude Control System possible. The major design changes are {{summarized}} as: an annular Support Systems Module; removal of image motion compensation; reaction wheels instead of CMG's; a magnetic torquer system to also perform the emergency and backup functions, eliminating the previously required mass <b>expulsion</b> <b>system.</b> Preliminary analysis indicates the Low Cost LST concept can meet the newly defined requirements and results in a significantly reduced development cost...|$|E
40|$|All system {{components}} were tested for endurance and steady state and cyclic operation. The following results were obtained: acceleration system (electrostatic type), 3100 hours continuous running; acceleration system (translation type), 2026 hours continuous running; cathode-isolator-vaporizer assembly, 5000 hours continuous operation and 190 restart cycles with 1750 hours operation; mercury <b>expulsion</b> <b>system,</b> 5000 hours continuous running; and neutralizer, 5100 hours continuous operation. The results of component optimization studies such as neutralizer position, neutralizer keeper hole, and screen grid geometry are included. Extensive mapping of the magnet field within and immediately outside the thruster are shown. A technique of electroplating the molybdenum accelerator grid with copper to study erosion patterns is described. Results of tests being conducted to more {{fully understand the}} operation of the hollow cathode are also given. This type of 5 -cm thruster will be space tested on the Communication Technology Satellite in 1975...|$|E
50|$|Electro-{{mechanical}} <b>Expulsion</b> Deicing <b>Systems</b> (EMEDS) use {{a mechanical}} force {{to knock the}} ice off the flight surface. Typically, actuators are installed underneath {{the skin of the}} structure. The actuator is moved to induce a shock wave in the protected surface to dislodge the ice. Cox and Company, Inc. of Plainview, NY developed a lightweight, low-power system called EMEDS that is the first ice protection technology to receive FAA certification in 50 years, and is currently in-service on multiple commercial aircraft (FAA Part 23 and Part 25) and military aircraft.|$|R
40|$|The {{topic of}} this thesis is Aircraft Icing and Aircraft Icing and Thermo-Mechanical Expulsion De-icing Technology. The main {{objectives}} are to investigate aircraft icing meteorology and effects on aircraft, ice protection <b>systems</b> and thermo-mechanical <b>expulsion</b> de-icing technology. Initially, the research project focuses on aircraft icing meteorology, ice accumulation and icing effects on flight safety. A {{basic understanding of}} aircraft icing is explained, including icing conditions and parameters, ice detection, ice accretion shapes, and icing effects in terms of different airframe surfaces. Ice protection systems are employed to prevent the icing hazards and ensure flight safety. The conventional and novel ice protection technologies are investigated and their characteristics are explained. Thermo-mechanical expulsion de-icing technology is selected as the research topic because of its typical characteristics of lower power required and high de-icing efficiency. Methods are explored to assess power consumption of thermo-mechanical <b>expulsion</b> de-icing <b>system.</b> In addition, a thermo-mechanical <b>expulsion</b> de-icing <b>system</b> architecture is explored for a civil aircraft and system power consumption is calculated. In order to explain the system design characteristics, conventional electro-thermal de-icing system architecture is designed to show the contrasts in terms of power consumption, de-icing efficiency, cost and mass. This novel ice protection system has better results in power consumption and de-icing performance, allowing long time flight in icing conditions. It can compensate the disadvantages of heavier mass and higher cost {{because there is no}} need to escape from icing encounters immediately and fuel penalties are reduced sequentially...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the common Austronesian reliance on similar idioms and metaphors to define ideas of origins {{and on the}} use of narratives {{for the construction of a}} shared past. Thus common origin — not just “descent ” —becomes a prime marker of identity. Among Austronesians, the sharing of a journey may be part of this reckoning of social ancestry. Within this cultural framework, the paper considers two formal systems of differentiation: the one, a system of lateral expansion; the other, a system of apical demotion with concomitant predatory <b>expulsion.</b> Each <b>system</b> relies on a differently structured narrative of the past on which to base its construction of origins...|$|R
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of rotational motion of a spinning orbiting spacecraft {{consisting of two}} rigid bodies connected by a flexible joint and arbitrary number of flexible appendages (two of which are flexible massless booms having masses on their tips) is analyzed. Active attitude control is provided by momentum exchange devices (e. g. control moment gyroscopes) or a mass <b>expulsion</b> <b>system.</b> The linearized equations of motion describing the vehicle are presented, and a large scale digital simulation that has been developed at the Marshall Space Flight Center is presented. A simplified model of the geometrically complex vehicle is selected to make it analytically tractable. The simplified model consists of a single rigid core body with two attached flexible massless booms having tip masses. The states of the vehicle are defined as small perturbations about its steady-state spin. An analysis is performed to determine the domain of stability...|$|E
40|$|Thermal {{conditioning}} {{systems for}} satisfying engine net positive suction pressure (NPSP) requirements, and propellant expulsion systems for achieving propellant dump during a return-to-launch site (RTLS) abort were studied for LH 2 /LO 2 and LCH 4 /LO 2 upper stage propellant combinations. A state-of-the-art thermal conditioning system employing helium injection beneath the liquid surface shows the lowest weight penalty for LO 2 and LCH 4. A technology system incorporating a thermal subcooler (heat exchanger) for engine NPSP {{results in the}} lowest weight penalty for the LH 2 tank. A preliminary design of two state-of-the-art and two new technology systems indicates a weight penalty difference too small to warrant development of a LH 2 thermal subcooler. Analysis {{results showed that the}} LH 2 /LO 2 propellant <b>expulsion</b> <b>system</b> is optimized for maximum dump line diameters, whereas the LCH 4 /LO 2 system is optimized for minimum dump line diameter (LCH 4) and maximum dump line diameter (LO 2). The primary uncertainty is the accurate determination of two-phase flow rates through the dump system; experimentation is not recommended because this uncertainty is not considered significant...|$|E
40|$|A fluid {{storage and}} <b>expulsion</b> <b>system</b> {{comprising}} a tank with an internal flexible diaphragm assembly of dual diaphragms in back-to-back relationship, {{at least one}} of which is provided with a patterned surface having fine edges such that the diaphragms are in contact along said edges without mating contact of surface areas to thereby form fluid channels which extend outwardly to the peripheral edges of the diaphragms is described. The interior wall of the tank at the juncture of tank sections is formed with a circumferential annular recess comprising an outer annular recess portion which forms a fluid collection chamber and an inner annular recess portion which accommodates the peripheral edge portions of the diaphragms and a sealing ring in clamped sealing relation therebetween. The sealing ring is perforated with radially extending passages which allow any fluid leaking or diffusing past a diaphragm to flow through the fluid channels between the diaphragms to the fluid collection chamber. Ports connectable to pressure fittings are provided in the tank sections for admission of fluids to opposite sides of the diaphragm assembly. A drain passage through the tank wall to the fluid collection chamber permits detection, analysis and removal of fluids in the collection chamber...|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} October 1939, the Germans {{introduced}} {{the death penalty for}} active disobedience to the German occupation. Plans for mass <b>expulsions</b> and the <b>system</b> of slave labour camps for up to 20 million Poles were made. Himmler thought of moving all Poles to Siberia. In May 1940 he wrote a memorandum; in it, he promised to eventually deport all Poles to the east. Most of them were intended to die during the cultivation of the swamps.|$|R
40|$|With {{funding from}} Glenn's Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, Cox & Company, Inc., built an ice {{protection}} system that combines thermal anti-icing and mechanical deicing to keep airfoils (wings and other lifting surfaces) clear of ice. Cox's concept was to combine an anti-icing system with NASA's Electro-Mechanical <b>Expulsion</b> Deicing <b>System,</b> a mechanical deicer. The anti-icing element of this hybrid would reduce the aerodynamic losses associated with deicing systems. The Cox Low Power Ice Protection System is the first new aircraft {{ice protection system}} that has {{been approved by the}} Federal Aviation Administration for use on a business jet in 40 years. While the system is currently sized for Premier class aircraft, there are no apparent constraints prohibiting its use on aircraft of any size. The company is investigating further applications, such as adapting the system for unmanned aerial vehicles and other military aircraft...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{consists}} of four parts and its four main objectives are: (1) to establish a potential link between serpentinization beneath a young sedimented-ocean ridge and carbon release and gas hydrate formation directly above it, (2) to understand the coexistence of free gas and gas-hydrate and to image the geophysical evidence for a geologically controlled gas hydrate, fluid migration pathway and seabed <b>expulsion</b> <b>system,</b> (3) to image the active fluid flow migration path-networks from deep hydrocarbon sources and to assess the distribution of shallow gas accumulation, and (4) to determine in detail the seismic velocity structure of the regions close to the landward limit of hydrate stability zone.

This PhD thesis presents results from four articles that glean into the fluid flow and gas-hydrate systems of the NW-Svalbard and SW-Barents Sea margins.

6000|$|I {{understood}} that before my arrival in M. Pelet's establishment, the combined insubordination of the pupils had effected {{the dismissal of}} more than one English master. It was necessary then to exact only the most moderate application from natures so little qualified to apply--to assist, in every practicable way, understandings so opaque and contracted--to be ever gentle, considerate, yielding even, to a certain point, with dispositions so irrationally perverse; but, having reached that culminating point of indulgence, you must fix your foot, plant it, root it in rock--become immutable as the towers of Ste. Gudule; for a step--but half a step farther, and you would plunge headlong into the gulf of imbecility; there lodged, you would speedily receive proofs of Flemish gratitude and magnanimity in showers of Brabant saliva and handfuls of Low Country mud. You might smooth to the utmost the path of learning, remove every pebble from the track; but then you must finally insist with decision on the pupil taking your arm and allowing himself to be led quietly along the prepared road. When I had brought down my lesson to the lowest level of my dullest pupil's capacity--when I had shown myself the mildest, the most tolerant of masters--a word of impertinence, a movement of disobedience, changed me at once into a despot. I offered then but one alternative--submission and acknowledgment of error, or ignominious <b>expulsion.</b> This <b>system</b> answered, and my influence, by degrees, became established on a firm basis. [...] "The boy is father to the man," [...] it is said; and so I often thought when looked at my boys and remembered the political history of their ancestors. Pelet's school was merely an epitome of the Belgian nation.|$|R
