30|$|There {{are three}} stream {{crossings}} along the studied stream section, including (along {{the direction of}} flow; Fig.  1 b) a road bridge (I) and a pedestrian bridge (II), and another road bridge (III). The upstream single-span concrete bridge (I) and pedestrian truss bridge (II) have sufficiently wide spans to allow flow to pass unimpeded— 27 and 72  m, respectively, the latter supported by a pier along the stream bank. The site of interest was the third stream crossing (III) (41.7986 ° N, 72.7132 ° W). A bridge with <b>a</b> single span <b>of</b> 25  m was built at this location, to replace a stream crossing in the <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>embankment</b> with culverts that severely impeded throughput of high water flows (Fig.  1 c).|$|R
30|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the water quality impacts of flow improvement works in the urban North Branch Park River (drainage area 74.1  km 2) in Connecticut, Northeastern United States. In the studied location, a stream crossing in the <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>embankment</b> with culverts was replaced with small single-span bridge to increase flow capacity and reduce flood occurrence in the immediate upstream vicinity. We evaluated the impacts of this flow improvement project on water quality by comparing turbidity [a common indicator of suspended solids], dissolved oxygen (DO), total phosphorus (TP), and benthic macroinvertebrate abundance, taxon richness and diversity (Weigel et al. 2002; Chen et al. 2009; Hassan et al. 2015) measured before, during, and after construction.|$|R
40|$|Flow {{resistance}} {{is a key}} factor in predicting the river conveyance capacity and associated water levels. In addition to bed resistance, the obstacles (embankments, spur dikes etc.) in the flood plain <b>of</b> <b>a</b> river contribute to the flow resistance. In particular the elevated parts are expected to play an important role. The objective {{of this study is to}} develop and parameterize an analytical model for the form drag due to such obstacles. An experimental study was carried out for validation purposes of the developed analytical model. The prototype weir-like structure (in the <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>embankment)</b> was modeled as a weir with various leeside slopes. Measurements for energy head losses were carried out for <b>a</b> range <b>of</b> discharges and downstream water levels covering submerged flow conditions. The energy head loss due to submerged dikes was modeled as an expansion loss form drag. The analytical form drag model was estimated using a one-dimensional momentum conservation equation which accounts for the energy loss associated with <b>a</b> deceleration <b>of</b> the flow in the leeside region of the sudden expansion. The predicted losses from the analytical model agreed well with the experimental results. The minor deviations observed could be attributed to downstream slope effects and non- uniform velocity distribution in expansion zone (recirculation region) <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>embankment...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{reserve is}} {{important}} in containing a rare recognisable remnant of Gympie Road as it existed prior to 1936. This takes the <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> raised <b>embankment,</b> <b>formed</b> in 1877, that traces the road approach to the bridge that crossed the North Pine River there. The remains of the bridge piles (1877) are also extant {{in the bed of}} the river. The road remnant was preserved after the position of the road was altered in 1936 due to the continued use of the area as a recreational reserve.|$|R
30|$|The Kolong River of Nagaon district, Assam {{has been}} facing serious {{degradation}} leading {{to its current}} moribund condition due to a drastic human intervention in the <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>embankment</b> put across it near its take-off point from the Brahmaputra River in the year 1964. The blockage of the river flow was adopted as a flood control measure to protect its riparian areas, especially the Nagaon town, from flood hazard. The river, once <b>a</b> blooming distributary <b>of</b> the mighty Brahmaputra, had high navigability and rich riparian biodiversity with a well established agriculturally productive watershed. However, the present status of Kolong River is highly wretched as <b>a</b> consequence <b>of</b> the post-dam effects thus leaving it as stagnant pools of polluted water with negligible socio-economic and ecological value. The Central Pollution Control Board, {{in one of its}} report has placed the Kolong River among 275 most polluted rivers of India. Thus, this study is conducted to analyze the seasonal water quality status of the Kolong River in terms of water quality index (WQI). The WQI scores shows very poor to unsuitable quality of water samples in almost all the seven sampling sites along the Kolong River. The water quality is found to be most deteriorated during monsoon season with an average WQI value of 122.47 as compared to pre-monsoon and post-monsoon season having average WQI value of 85.73 and 80.75, respectively. Out of the seven sampling sites, Hatimura site (S 1) and Nagaon Town site (S 4) are observed to be the most polluted sites.|$|R
500|$|Hayes and Rutter {{state that}} the primary purpose <b>of</b> such <b>an</b> <b>embankment</b> {{would have been to}} provide good {{drainage}} for a road surface. Archaeologist David E Johnston states that the structure is crossed by numerous perpendicular drainage culverts with small becks trickling through them since the ground is often boggy. This could suggest a reason for the embankment, and its early attribution as a causeway—a route across wetland, normally supported on earth or stone in the <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> raised <b>embankment.</b> Nineteenth-century antiquarian Thomas Codrington argued that Roman roads in Britain were generally built on embankments regardless of the underlying ground's drainage. He states that the common appellation of [...] "causeway" [...] in the names of Roman roads may, therefore, relate to their embankments rather than indicate that the ground on which they were constructed was ill-drained. Some historians translate Livy's phrase for Roman military construction of roads, via munire, as [...] "making a causeway".|$|R
40|$|Chemical {{stabilizers}} (e. g., cement, lime, gypsum, {{and other}} alkaline admixtures) {{have been widely}} used to enhance the strength and compressibility properties of subgrade soils. However, traditional chemical stabilizers are not always acceptable in Australia because they often pose a threat to the surrounding environment. Moreover, traditionally treated soils usually exhibit excessive brittle behaviour, which is often undesirable for transport infrastructure such as rail embankments and airport runways. To establish an alternative stabilizer that could overcome the above problems, this note presents <b>a</b> series <b>of</b> experimental results on the use of lignosulfonate (by-product of timber and paper industry), an environmentally friendly soil stabilizer effective for treating fine sandy silt that <b>formed</b> the bulk <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>embankment</b> fill at Penrith, Australia. The effects of lignosulfonate treatment on the shear behaviour of treated soil, including the stress-strain relationships, and the corresponding development of excess pore pressure and volumetric responses under monotonic triaxial testing are discussed...|$|R
2500|$|On August 5, 1933, a radio play by Peter Hagen and Hans Jürgen Nierenz, Wir bauen eine Straße ("We are Building a Road"), was {{broadcast}} throughout the Reich. On September 23, 1933, the first 720 unemployed {{marched to the}} Frankfurt Stock Exchange, where they were ceremonially invested with shovels as Reichsautobahn workers, then from there accompanied by SA men, marched behind Todt and Jakob Sprenger, the Reichsstatthalter of Hesse, to {{the bank of the}} Main. There after further speeches, Hitler was to inaugurate work on the autobahn system with the first ceremonial shoveling <b>of</b> dirt to <b>form</b> the base <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>embankment.</b> However, as Todt described the scene in an illustrated album published in 1935, [...] "again and again his shovel plunged into the mound [...] This was no symbolic shoveling; this was real construction work!" [...] Two of the workers [...] "sprang... to help him", and they worked [...] "until the mound had been dealt with in an orderly fashion and... the first drops of sweat were dripping from his brow onto the earth." [...] The image of Hitler shoveling was used many times in propaganda, including superimposed on the workers' march in Heinrich Hoffmann's poster urging Germans to ratify the Nazi government in the November 1933 Reichstag election. The location was marked with a park and a commemorative stone.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: A continuum-based finite-element {{methodology}} {{is established}} for quantifying {{the stability of}} earthen embankments built on saturated soil deposits. Within the methodology the soil is treated as a fluid-solid porous medium, in which the soil skeleton’s constitutive behavior is modeled using a smooth elastoplastic cap model that features continuous coupling between deviatoric and volumetric plasticity. In the stability analysis procedure, self-weight of the embankment soils is monotonically increased at rates characteristic of the embankment construction time, until instability mechanisms develop. The transient effects of excess pore pressures {{and their impact on}} soil strength are explicitly modeled, allowing for computation of embankment safety factors against instability as <b>a</b> function <b>of</b> construction rate. Details on the proposed method are presented and discussed, including (1) how the construction rate <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>embankment</b> can be modeled; (2) how load-based safety factors can differ from resistance-based safety factors; and (3) solved example problems corresponding to <b>a</b> case history <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>embankment</b> failure...|$|R
