40|$|This {{study is}} {{performed}} to compare healthcare expenditure patterns of different income <b>deciles</b> of Iranian rural households during 2009 to 2014. The econometric method is ordinary least square (OLS). Data is devised from National household survey data.

This paper tries to quantify the degree of effectiveness of each variable on healthcare expenditure among different income <b>deciles.</b> It is also needed to examine if there is a statistically significant difference between effects of variables on healthcare expenditure during different income <b>deciles.</b> The findings verify that there is a significant difference in healthcare expenditure patterns between different income <b>deciles.</b> They show that in the first six <b>deciles</b> a similar pattern is observed. In these <b>deciles,</b> the level of education of parents doesn’t demonstrate a significant effect on the healthcare expenditure and a percent increase in the family income increases the healthcare expenditure less than 1...|$|R
40|$|Nursing homes {{vary widely}} between {{facilities}} {{with very few}} beds and facilities with several hundred beds. Previous studies, which estimate nursing home scale and scope economies, do not account for this heterogeneity and implicitly assume that all nursing homes face the same cost structure. To account for heterogeneity, this paper uses quantile regression to estimate cost functions for skilled and intermediate care nursing homes. The {{results show that the}} parameters of nursing home cost functions vary significantly by output mix and across the cost distribution. Estimates show that product-specific scale economies systematically increase across the cost distribution for both skilled and intermediate care facilities, with diseconomies of scale in the lower <b>deciles</b> and no significant scale economies in the higher <b>deciles.</b> As for ray scale economies, estimates show economies of scale in the lower <b>deciles</b> and diseconomies of scale or no significant scale economies at higher <b>deciles.</b> The estimates also show that scope economies exist in the lower cost <b>deciles</b> and that no scope economies exist in the higher cost <b>deciles.</b> Additionally, the degree of scope economies monotonically decreases across the <b>deciles.</b> Copyright © 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to compare Mathematical Citation Quotient (MCQ), as a tool of {{mathematical}} science citation analysis, with Journal Impact Factor (JIF) in both 2 -year and 5 -year impact factors. MCQ is represented in the 2005 version of MathSciNet with special selected journals named as the Reference List Journals (RLJ). This study is an investigation of pure mathematics journals listed in JCR database. A comparison of the relative overlap for the journals shows that relative overlap of RLJ in JCR is equal to 72. 2 percent. In this research, MCQ has been compared with JIF 2 and JIF 5. The average of JIF 2 and JIF 5 are higher than the average of journals' MCQ. Comparison of correlations shows that in general MCQ has a strong and direct correlation with JIF 2 and JIF 5, but when journals are put in <b>deciles,</b> we get different results. By comparing averages we show that in any <b>deciles,</b> averages of JIF 2 and JIF 5 are more than MCQ. In some <b>deciles,</b> we have various correlations and even negative ones. A comparison between MCQ and JIF 2 shows that only in the first <b>deciles</b> the correlation is strong and direct and in the <b>deciles</b> 2, 7 and 8, there is a weak direct correlation. In the other <b>deciles</b> one observes some negative correlations. A comparison between MCQ and JIF 5 shows that the correlation is strong only in the first <b>deciles</b> and direct and in the others there are weak correlations, in particular, in <b>deciles</b> 6, 8, 9 and 10 the correlations are negative. This article advises American Mathematical Society to extend the coverage of RLJ and suggest pure mathematics departments to take care of usage of JIF 2, rather MCQ may be a good source for evaluating researches of their academic members...|$|R

40|$|Wealth quintiles {{derived from}} {{household}} asset indices are routinely used for measuring socioeconomic inequalities {{in the health}} {{of women and children}} in low and middle-income countries. We explore whether the use of wealth <b>deciles</b> rather than quintiles may be advantageous. We selected 46 countries with available national surveys carried out between 2003 and 2013 and with a sample size of at least 3000 children. The outcomes were prevalence of under-five stunting and delivery by a skilled birth attendant (SBA). Differences and ratios between extreme groups for <b>deciles</b> (D 1 and D 10) and quintiles (Q 1 and Q 5) were calculated, as well as two summary measures: the slope index of inequality (SII) and concentration index (CIX). In virtually all countries, stunting prevalence was highest among the poor, and there were larger differences between D 1 and D 10 than between Q 1 and Q 5. SBA coverage showed pro-rich patterns in all countries; in four countries the gap was greater than 80 pct points. With one exception, differences between extreme <b>deciles</b> were larger than between quintiles. Similar patterns emerged when using ratios instead of differences. The two summary measures provide very similar results for quintiles and <b>deciles.</b> Patterns of top or bottom inequality varied with national coverage levels. Researchers and policymakers should consider breakdowns by wealth <b>deciles,</b> when sample sizes allow. Use of <b>deciles</b> may contribute to advocacy efforts, monitoring inequalities over time, and targeting health interventions. Summary indices of inequalities were unaffected by the use of quintiles or <b>deciles</b> in their calculation...|$|R

The behavioral explanation for the day-of-the-week effect, based on monotonically improving mood throughout the week, is therefore a stronger candidate in smaller-market capitalization <b>deciles.</b>|$|R

The University of Western Australia Medical School has been progressively widening {{the participation of}} students from a broader spectrum of the community both through expanded selection criteria and quota-based approaches for students of rural, indigenous and other socio-educationally disadvantaged backgrounds. We proposed that medical students entering medical school from such backgrounds would ultimately {{be more likely to}} practice in areas of increased socio-economic disadvantage. Methods The current practice address of 2829 medical students who commenced practice from 1980 to 2011 was ascertained from the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA) Database. Logistic regression was utilised to determine the predictors of the likelihood of the current practice address being in the lower 8 socio-economic <b>deciles</b> versus the top 2 socio-economic <b>deciles.</b> Results Those who were categorised in the lower 8 socio-economic <b>deciles</b> at entry to medical school had increased odds of a current practice address in the lower 8 socio-economic <b>deciles</b> 5 or more years after graduation (OR 2. 05, 95...|$|R
