25|$|Just {{before the}} {{training}} camp commenced, the Drillers {{pulled the trigger}} on another deal that {{came as a shock}} to many. The deal saw Domenic Mobilio shipped to Philadelphia for Rick Titus, a player that only months earlier had walked out on the Drillers, and whom management had stated would never again be welcomed back. While on the surface, dealing a fan favourite and leading scorer for a <b>guy</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> considered persona non grata doesn't quite add up, the underlying issue was that Mobilio had a falling out with management which led to the deal being brokered. This would also mark the third time Titus had been acquired by Edmonton.|$|E

Speaking on the experience, Fator said, [...] "Not in my wildest dreams did I imagine I would win that show...Essentially I auditioned because the <b>guy</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> the ventriloquist the first season got on Late Show with David Letterman... So I figured I'd do three episodes like he did and end up on 'David Letterman.'" [...] After winning the show, Fator actually had to turn the Letterman gig down fourteen times before his schedule was clear so he could appear. [...] "My schedule got so packed, and it broke my heart every time I had to turn him down," [...] Fator says.|$|E
