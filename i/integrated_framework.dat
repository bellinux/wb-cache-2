Donald Holzman writes that Shen [...] "has nowhere organized his observations into {{anything like a}} general theory."

The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to further develop and demonstrate <b>integrating</b> software architecture <b>frameworks</b> for distributed simulation and distributed collaboration in the homeland security domain. The <b>integrated</b> <b>frameworks</b> were initially developed through the Weapons of Mass Destruction Decision Analysis Center (WMD-DAC), sited at SNL/CA, and the National Infrastructure Simulation & Analysis Center (NISAC), sited at SNL/NM. The primary deliverable was a demonstration of both a federation of distributed simulations and a federation of distributed collaborative simulation analysis communities {{in the context of the}} same integrated scenario, which was the release of smallpox in San Diego, California. To our knowledge this was the first time such a combination of federations under a single scenario has ever been demonstrated. A secondary deliverable was the creation of the standalone GroupMeld{trademark} collaboration client, which uses the GroupMeld{trademark} synchronous collaboration framework.
