25|$|The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) {{recommend}} that all women 65years {{of age or}} older be screened by bone <b>densitometry.</b> Additionally they recommend screening women with increased risk factors that puts them at risk equivalent to a 65‑year‑old. There is insufficient evidence to make recommendations about the intervals for repeated screening and the appropriate age to stop screening. In men the harm versus benefit of screening for osteoporosis is unknown. Prescrire states that the need to test for osteoporosis in {{those who have not}} had a previous bone fracture is unclear. The International Society for Clinical <b>Densitometry,</b> however, suggest BMD testing for men 70 or older, or those who are indicated for risk equal to that of a 70‑year‑old.

25|$|The International Society for Clinical <b>Densitometry</b> {{takes the}} {{position}} that a diagnosis of osteoporosis in men under 50 years of age should not {{be made on the}} basis of densitometric criteria alone.

25|$|The {{colorimetric}} {{detection method}} depends on incubation {{of the western}} blot with a substrate that reacts with the reporter enzyme (such as peroxidase) that is bound to the secondary antibody. This converts the soluble dye into an insoluble form of a different color that precipitates next to the enzyme and thereby stains the membrane. Development of the blot is then stopped by washing away the soluble dye. Protein levels are evaluated through <b>densitometry</b> (how intense the stain is) or spectrophotometry.|$|E
2500|$|Chemiluminescent {{detection}} methods depend on incubation {{of the western}} blot with a substrate that will luminesce when exposed to the reporter on the secondary antibody. The light is then detected [...] by CCD cameras which capture a digital image of the western blot or photographic film. The use of film for western blot detection is slowly disappearing because of non linearity of the image (non accurate quantification). The image is analysed by <b>densitometry,</b> which evaluates the relative amount of protein staining and quantifies the results in terms of optical density. Newer software allows further data analysis such as molecular weight analysis if appropriate standards are used.|$|E
2500|$|In <b>densitometry,</b> a model {{quite similar}} to the hue defined above is used for {{describing}} colors of CMYK process inks. In 1953, Frank Preucil developed two geometric arrangements of hue, the [...] "Preucil hue circle" [...] and the [...] "Preucil hue hexagon", analogous to our H and H2, respectively, but defined relative to idealized cyan, yellow, and magenta ink colors. The [...] "Preucil hue error" [...] of an ink indicates {{the difference in the}} [...] "hue circle" [...] between its color and the hue of the corresponding idealized ink color. The grayness of an ink is , where m and M are the minimum and maximum among the amounts of idealized cyan, magenta, and yellow in a density measurement.|$|E

50|$|The {{official}} {{position of the}} International Society for Clinical <b>Densitometry</b> (ISCD) is that a patient may be tested for BMD if he suffers from a condition that could precipitate bone loss, {{is going to be}} prescribed pharmaceuticals known to cause bone loss, or is being treated and needs to be monitored. The ISCD states that there is no clearly understood correlation between BMD and the risk of a child's suffering a fracture; the diagnosis of osteoporosis in children cannot be made using the basis of a <b>densitometry</b> criteria. T-scores are prohibited with children and should not even appear on DXA reports. Thus, the WHO classification of osteoporosis and osteopenia in adults cannot be applied to children, but Z-scores can be used to assist diagnosis.|$|E
