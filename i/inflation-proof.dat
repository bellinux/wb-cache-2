5000|$|The safe {{held the}} Bedford Diamonds, an {{extremely}} valuable collection of jewelry, much sought-after as an <b>inflation-proof</b> investment for cash and wanted by police {{all over the}} world. Holm Hansen sells the diamonds to an Arabian Oil Sheikh for 15 million dollars. Using a boat, a bus and one hundred balloons, the Gang manage to snatch the diamonds under the very nose of the Sheikh and his police escort. Egon, knowing that the diamonds cannot legally be sold, plan instead {{to use them to}} extort 50% of the 15 million from Holm Hansen, but is foiled by Yvonne, who has hidden the diamonds and replaced them with worthless souvenirs. Holm Hansen concludes that Egon is raving mad, but far too knowledgeable about his businesses and orders his henchman [...] "Bøffen" [...] to make Egon [...] "disappear and stay gone forever". Bøffen captures Egon and attempts to drown him in the Copenhagen harbor, but Egon is saved {{in the nick of time}} by Benny and Kjeld. Egon how has a final plan. With Benny and Kjeld disguised as police officers and Egon playing captive, the Gang confronts Holm Hansen. With Holm Hansen distracted by Benny, Egon and Kjeld open his safe and replace the 15 million dollars with the diamonds. Realizing he has been played, Holm Hansen calls the real police, which promptly arrest him on finding the Bedford Diamonds in his possession. The Gang subsequently escapes to Majorca with the money.|$|E
40|$|When {{the effect}} of high {{inflation}} on the tax system is taken into account, the overall revenues from inflationary finance may well be negative. The strength of this contention is weighed against measures taken in Israel {{in an attempt to}} construct an <b>inflation-proof</b> tax system. The paper concludes that, despite these measures, the Israeli experience suggests that it is more appropriate to talk about the "inflation subsidy," rather than the "inflation tax. "...|$|E
50|$|With Jeff Rooker she co-authored the Rooker-Wise Amendment to Denis Healey's 1977 budget {{which sought}} to freeze many annual fiscal changes to {{mitigate}} global inflation; this amendment introduced retrospective <b>inflation-proofing</b> on personal tax allowances (the tax-free portion of individuals' earnings), and resulted in £450 million being returned to taxpayers.|$|R

40|$|Currency Substitution and the Regressivity of Inflationary Taxation The {{purpose of}} this paper is to show that in the {{presence}} of financial adaptation or currency substitution. the inflation tax is extremely regressive. This regressivity arises from the existence of a fixed cost of switching to <b>inflation-proof</b> transactions technologies. This fixed cost makes it optimal only for those agents with sufficiently high incomes to switch out of domestic currency. The effects are illustrated and quantified for a particular case...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Decentralized {{sustainable}} {{resource management}} {{in developing countries}} is important both from a poverty-reduction and an ecological viewpoint. At the same time, no financial instrument is available that enables small savings to be protected against the vagaries of monetary instabilities and inflation. This paper proposes a solution that would address all three issues simultaneously: an <b>inflation-proof</b> savings instrument, fully backed by the organic growth process of a local resource, which {{at the same time}} gives a market-based financial incentive to protect that natural resource. A specific example involving sustainable forestry plantations in the Third World is provided...|$|E
30|$|In general, {{the fear}} of {{floating}} comes from three dimensions. First, currency depreciation could increase the real burden of external debt. Many enterprises and financial institutions in developing countries have substantial amount of liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, while most their assets are denominated in domestic currencies, namely currency mismatch. When domestic currencies depreciate, the balance sheets of corporate sector and financial sector will deteriorate, making it even hard to get financed on the international financial market. Second, currency depreciation could lead to capital flight, which exerts downward pressure on domestic investment and output, especially when the central bank raises interest rates to stop the currency depreciation, in which case, even more contraction. Third, currency depreciation could cause inflation, threatening domestic economic stability. To some extent, pegging its domestic currency to the US dollar or any other <b>inflation-proof</b> currency could be deemed as an institutional arrangement or commitment of a developing country to contain inflation. However, currency depreciation violates the commitment and could trigger a credibility crisis.|$|E
5000|$|The Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation {{manages the}} assets of both the Permanent Fund and other state investments, but {{spending}} Fund income {{is up to the}} Legislature. The Corporation is to manage for maximum prudent return, and not—as some Alaskans at first wanted—as a development bank for in-state projects. The Fund grew from an initial investment of $734,000 in 1977 to approximately $53.7 billion as of July 9, 2015. [...] Some growth was due to good management, some to inflationary re-investment, and some via legislative decisions to deposit extra income during boom years. Each year, the fund's realized earnings are split between <b>inflation-proofing,</b> operating expenses, and the annual Permanent Fund Dividend.|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} the British government's new {{proposals}} for personal portable pensions and of the parallel reduction of the benefits in the state earnings-related pension scheme are examined {{in the light of}} historical evidence on the behaviour of pension saving. Defined contribution pension schemes are forecast to become more popular, against the currently dominant defined-benefit schemes. The present <b>inflation-proofing</b> for the vested rights of leavers may prove inadequate. The risk to pension plan members of fund insolvency may rise to United States levels as competition in the industry increases. Costs of running the more flexible new system will rise. A wider range of financial services are likely to be retailed through pension funds, particularly if tax subsidies are not re-assessed.

5000|$|In 1975, a State Earnings Related Pension Scheme (SERPS) was introduced. A new pension, {{which was}} <b>inflation-proofed</b> and linked to earnings, {{was added to}} the basic pension which was to {{increase}} in line with earnings for the first time ever. This reform assisted women by the linking of pensions to the 'twenty best years' of earnings, and those who worked at home caring for children or others were counted as contributors. This scheme was reformed by the subsequent Thatcher Government. The Sex Discrimination Act 1975 gave women the right in principle to equal access to jobs and equal treatment at work with men, while the Employment Protection Act 1975 introduced Statutory Maternity Leave. [...] That same year, the wage stop was finally abolished. In addition, differentials between skilled and unskilled workers were narrowed as a result of egalitarian pay policies involving flat-rate increases.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{contributes}} to the literature on budget deficits and inflation in high inflation economies. The main finding is that recurrent outbursts of extreme inflation in these economies can be explained by a certain hysteresis effect associated with public finance. This interpretation meets the evidence that dramatic shifts between regimes of moderately high and extremely high (hyper-) inflation often occur without visible deterioration in public finance or abrupt shifts in fiscal and monetary policies. The existence of the hysteresis effect is explicitly explained by the work of two mechanisms: the arithmetic associated with {{the wrong side of the}} inflation tax Laffer curve and the Patinkin effect (the reverse of the much more-cited Olivera-Tanzi effect). It is also shown that the division of the operational budget deficit into the part that is subject to negative inflation feedback and the <b>inflation-proof</b> part has implications for both the discussion of inflationary consequences of budget deficits and the proper design of stabilization policy...|$|E

40|$|In 1975 Niels Thygesen, {{together}} with eight other economists - {{one of us}} among them - published in The Economist a "manifesto" proposing a new common currency for Europe (Basevi et al., 1975). His co-operation on this subject was pursued within a smaller group, and resulted in the publication of two reports for the EU Commission (Optica Report ' 75, Optica Report 1976). The proposal in the "manifesto" was ironically re-titled, by The Economist, "The All Saints' day manifesto for European monetary union". In fact it had been published on 1 st November, and the "Saints" should have been, according to The Economist, the European Governments if they had adopted and adhered to the proposal. This amounted to launching a new currency that should have circulated in parallel to the national ones, related to them by flexible exchange rates, due to the constraint that such new currency, the "Europa", had to be kept by an automatic formula at fixed purchasing power. In fact the Europa was to be indexed to the inflation rates in the participating countries, according to the weights of their national currencies in what {{at that time was}} called the European Unit of Account. As for the two other reports, Optica ' 75 proposed again a parallel currency, but less than fully <b>inflation-proof,</b> since its standing in terms of purchasing power would have been {{the same as that of}} the currency of the member country with the lowest inflation rate. In the Optica 1976 Report, while reiterating the proposal of a parallel currency along the lines of Optica ' 75, the focus was on designing a joint management of intra-European exchange rates on the basis of inflation differentials. The proposals contained in the three documents where premature, perhaps visionary. On 7 July 1978 the European Council met in Bremen and drew the lines of the European Monetary System, which started on 13 March 1979, on the basis, among other things, of a new quasi-currency - the European Currency Unit (ECU) - composed of a basket of national currencies. Since then, it took almost twenty years before the euro was introduced, replacing the ECU on 1 st January 1999. Comparing the euro to such proposals, we note at least two differences. The euro (a) did not start as a parallel currency, but replaced with a pre-announced schedule the national currencies of the countries participating in the monetary union, and (b) it was not conceived as an automatically <b>inflation-proof</b> currency, but one issued by a Central Bank bound by a monetary policy aimed at price stability. ...|$|E
40|$|On {{the basis}} of the {{investigation}} on the status quo of pilot area of rural pension insurance in Changsha, Zhuzhou and Xiangtan, farmers’ demand on insuring in the new pilot area of rural pension insurance is expounded from two aspects: farmers’ awareness on insuring is increasing gradually; farmers’ ability on insuring is increasing. The growing demand of farmers on insuring and the conflicts between the supply of rural pension insurance and the system construction are analyzed. The problems are inadequate input of funds, low level of social security; imperfect fund-collecting mechanism, serious vacancy; low level of fund management and operation, poor ability of <b>inflation-proofing</b> and appreciation; backward laws and regulations, instability of system. On the strength of the analysis above, the government should innovate and compound fund-collecting mechanism; establish â€œG-C-Fâ€ three-pillar model and set up â€œBSIâ€ the third party custodian; accelerate the legislation of new rural pension system so as to push forward the optimization of new rural pension insurance system in Changsha, Zhuzhou and Xiangtan.

40|$|We {{investigate}} whether individuals ’ experiences of macro-economic outcomes have long-term effects on their risk attitudes, as often suggested for {{the generation that}} experienced the Great Depression. Using data from the Survey of Consumer Finances from 1964 - 2004, we find that individuals that have experienced high stock-market returns throughout their lives report lower risk aversion, {{are more likely to}} be stock-market participants, and, if they participate, invest a higher fraction of liquid wealth in stocks. At the same time, individuals that have experienced high inflation are less likely to invest their (non-stock) assets in bonds and favor <b>inflation-proof</b> cash-like investments. All results are estimated controlling for age, year effects, and a broad set of household characteristics. Our estimates indicate that the most recent returns and inflation rates have the strongest effect, but experiences earlier in life still have some influence, even several decades later. Thus, the experience of risky asset payoffs over the course of an individual’s life affects subsequent risk-taking. Our results can explain, for example, the relatively low rates of stock-market participation among young households in the early 1980 s (following the disappointing stock-market returns in the 1970 s) and the relatively high participation rates of young investors in the late 1990 s (following the boom years in the 1990 s) ...|$|E
40|$|Historically, one of {{the most}} {{fruitful}} applications of financial and economic cost-benefit analysis has been in electricity systems planning. Because of the capital intensive nature of the production technology and the possibilities of substitution between capital and fuel, the potential for savings through correct choice of timing, technology and scale are immense. This particular project is unique because these decisions involve two political jurisdictions, India and Bhutan. Furthermore, the value of Bhutan’s unique natural resources, its hydro-electric sites, is entirely determined by their potential to save India’s scarce economic resources, both capital and fuel. The 336 MW Chukha hydro-electricity project was built by India on a turnkey basis, with India providing 60 % of the capital in a grant and 40 % in a loan at highly concessional terms and conditions. In the arrangement, India receives in turn all the electricity generated from the project in excess of Bhutan’s demand at much cheaper prices than India’s generation cost from alternative sources. The analysis, therefore involves an ex ante financial and economic evaluation of the project from viewpoint of Bhutan and India, taking into consideration the project’s terms and conditions, the alternative cost of power generation for India, and the engineering risks and environmental costs. The project is considered beneficial to both Bhutan and India, although its terms and conditions are not <b>inflation-proof.</b> international trade, electricity, Bhutan...|$|E
