5000|$|The six {{cylinder}} engines were {{fitted with}} a new Carter carburetor. A vacuum operated “Fuel Pacer” was offered as an option, the device using a flashing light to assist the driver in avoiding fuel wastage. This light was initially on the right-hand guard, but was later fitted to the instrument panel. Additional safety features included a pressure proportioning valve in the rear brake circuit, power-boosted brakes and <b>hazard</b> warning <b>lights.</b> <b>Indicator,</b> headlight dipping, headlight flashing and windscreen wiper controls were now housed in a steering column stalk. This was the first multi-purpose stalk control to be fitted {{by any of the}} “big three" [...] manufacturers, the other two being Ford Australia and General Motors-Holden's.|$|R

40|$|This {{study used}} a video-based braking {{simulation}} dual task {{to carry out}} a preliminary evaluation of the effect of a sudden brake warning system (SBWS) in a leading passenger vehicle on the response time of the following driver. The primary task required the participants (N = 25, 16 females, full NZ license holders) to respond to sudden braking manoeuvres of a lead vehicle during day and night driving, wet and dry conditions and in rural and urban traffic, while concurrently performing a secondary tracking task using a computer mouse. The SBWS in the lead vehicle consisted of g-force controlled activation of the rear <b>hazard</b> <b>lights</b> (the rear <b>indicators</b> flashed), in addition to the standard brake lights. Overall, the results revealed that responses to the braking manoeuvres of the leading vehicles when the <b>hazard</b> <b>lights</b> were activated by the warning system were 0. 34 s (19 %) faster compared to the standard brake lights. The SBWS was particularly effective when the simulated braking scenario of the leading vehicle did not require an immediate and abrupt braking response. Given this, the SBWS may also be beneficial for allowing smoother deceleration, thus reducing fuel consumption. These preliminary findings justify a larger, more ecologically valid laboratory evaluation which may lead to a naturalistic study in order to test this new technology in ‘real world’ braking situations...|$|R

50|$|The {{immobiliser}} circuit {{will close}} for 15 seconds and will rapidly pulse for 15 seconds before re-opening the circuit, allowing {{the vehicle to}} be driven to a safe location before once again being immobilised. The <b>hazard</b> <b>lights</b> will continue to flash, and on every subsequent attempt to start the vehicle will cause the horn to operate for 30 seconds, but the immobilizer circuit will not open, so the vehicle will not start and the <b>hazard</b> <b>lights</b> will keep flashing until the vehicle's battery is drained or the system is disarmed.|$|R

40|$|This work {{presents}} {{solutions to}} improve the quality parameters for outdoor illumination. The work starts from a case study which measured the outdoor <b>lighting</b> quality <b>indicators</b> on a street of the town Reşiţa. We measured levels of lighting and brightness, and we computed various <b>lighting</b> <b>indicators.</b> The obtained values were then compared to the values recommended by actual technical norms observing that they do not fit into the normed limits. Using the Dialux software we calculated the optimal mounting variant of the lighting installation for the street under lighting analysis. In the optimizing software we kept the pole’s height and place in space constant to the values in the real situation. This work presents new variants of lighting installations that can ensure the best <b>lighting</b> <b>indicators</b> possible...|$|R
