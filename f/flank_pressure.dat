40|$|Abstract Introduction The {{spontaneous}} rupture of {{an infected}} renal cyst {{is a rare}} event. Spontaneous rupture with drainage to the exterior through a surgical scar has not been reported previously. Case presentation A 49 -year-old male with tetraplegia had undergone extended right pyelolithotomy in 1999. Deroofing and marsupialisation of a cyst in the upper pole of the right kidney was performed in 2003. Subsequently there was recurrence of a thick-walled cystic space-occupying lesion in the upper pole of the right kidney. Thick pus was aspirated from the renal cyst on six occasions between September 2003 and November 2004. In March 2006, ultrasound examination revealed a cyst measuring 6. 2 cm in diameter in the upper pole of the right kidney. Aspiration was planned when the renal cyst reached 7. 5 cm in diameter. However, 11 months later, the cyst ruptured spontaneously and drained through the previous surgical scar in the flank, while the patient was recovering from a severe chest infection in the spinal unit. Ultrasound examination showed a fistulous tract running between the renal cyst and the abdominal wall. Repeated minor trauma sustained during turning, hoisting and chest physiotherapy all {{may have contributed to}} the rupture of the infected renal cyst and drainage through a weak spot in the abdominal wall. Conclusion In hindsight, we might have prevented rupture of the renal cyst had we considered aspiration of the renal cyst before it reached 7. 5 cm in diameter, although this 7. 5 cm diameter, as the threshold for percutaneous aspiration, is an arbitrary setting. This patient could have been advised to wear an abdominal corset to protect the right <b>flank</b> from <b>pressure</b> applied unintentionally during turning, hoisting or assisted coughing. </p...|$|R

50|$|At dawn on 29 October Prince Henry formed {{his army}} {{on the ground}} to the west of Lang Hennersdorf, {{detailing}} Forcade with the reserve to the north, Kleist to the south to pin Meyer, with Seydlitz and Stutterheim to attack the heights held by the Reichsarmy. As they advanced, the leading elements of the Prussian army skirmished briefly with the Croats in the woods but these troops soon withdrew in the face of formed infantry. Young Stutterheim’s attack however, met stiff resistance from the corps of Campitelli and for a time the attack stalled. Several Prussian cavalry attacks also failed to shift the Austrians and a regiment had to be borrowed from the left wing in order to stabilise this front. While the main Prussian army attacked this position, Seydlitz, finding the ground difficult for his cavalry, took command of the infantry on his wing and attacked Campitelli’s <b>flank.</b> With the <b>pressure</b> mounting, Stolberg began to move his line to the south in order to bolster the defence of a hillock known as the Trois Croix.

40|$|International audienceMajor volcano flank collapses {{strongly}} {{affect the}} underlying magmatic plumbing system. Here, {{we consider the}} magma storage zone as a liquid pocket embedded in an elastic medium, and we perform numerical simulations in two-dimensional axisymmetric geometry {{as well as in}} three dimensions in order to evaluate the consequences of a major collapse event. We quantify the pressure decrease induced within and around a magma reservoir by a volcano <b>flank</b> collapse. This <b>pressure</b> reduction is expected to favor replenishment with less evolved magma from deeper sources. We also estimate the impact of the magma pressure decrease, together with the stress field variations around the reservoir, on the eruptive event associated with the edifice failure. We show that, for a given magma reservoir geometry, the collapse of a large strato-volcano tends to reduce the volume of the simultaneous eruption; destabilization of large edifices may even suppress magma emission, resulting in phreatic eruptions instead. This effect is greater for shallow reservoirs, and is more pronounced for spherical reservoirs than for vertically-elongated ones. It is reduced for compressible magmas containing a large amount of volatiles. Over a longer time scale, the modification of pressure conditions for dyke initiation at the chamber wall may also explain an increase in eruption rate as well as an apparent change of magma storage location...|$|R
40|$|Magnetic {{reconnection}} between Earth's magnetosphere and {{the solar}} wind results in several modes of response, including the impulsive substorm and the quasi-steady mode known as steady magnetospheric convection (SMC). SMC events are theorized to result from balancing the dayside and nightside reconnection rates. The reasons the magnetosphere responds with different modes are not fully known. This dissertation comprises statistical data analysis of the SMC mode to investigate {{the solar wind}} conditions and magnetospheric properties during these events. A comprehensive list of SMC events is selected from 1997 - 2011. 	In {{the first of three}} studies, an association between SMCs and solar wind stream interfaces (SI) is identified in the declining phase of Solar Cycle 23. SMC occurrence peaks 12 - 24 hours after an SI if the solar wind is geoeffective. The subset of SI-associated SMCs occurs during fast solar wind velocity, in contrast to previous results, but the driving electric field imposed on the magnetosphere (E y) is the same for SI-associated and unassociated SMC events. Therefore the magnitude and steadiness of E y is the most important solar wind parameter for an SMC to occur. 	The second study shows that magnetotail convection is significantly different for SMC events, compared to quiet intervals and isolated substorms. Fast flows transporting enhanced magnetic flux are deflected toward the dawn and dusk flanks during SMC. Flow diversion is due to a broad high pressure region in the inner magnetosphere. The interval preceding SMC events is found to set up the magnetotail conditions that assist balanced reconnection. In particular inner magnetosphere pressure before SMCs is enhanced from substorm levels but not as high as SMC levels. The final study shows that nearly all SMCs are preceded by a substorm expansion. In rare cases when an SMC occurs without a preceding substorm, we hypothesize that the distant x-line is able to balance a weak solar wind driver. 	These results help explain how quasi-steady magnetospheric convection occurs. A southward turning of the solar wind and positive E y leads to dayside reconnection and a substorm onset occurs. Plasma injections from the near-Earth nightside x-line increase the pressure in the inner magnetosphere. If positive E y continues to drive dayside reconnection, the nightside x-line will stabilize to match it. Tail flux is diverted towards the <b>flanks</b> by <b>pressure</b> gradients and returns to the dayside. This convection pattern keeps the magnetosphere in its balanced reconnection mode...|$|R
40|$|Protection against {{noise is}} one of the six {{essential}} requirements of the European Construction Product directive. In buildings, airborne sound insulation is used to define the acoustical quality between rooms. In order to develop wall structures with optimal sound insulation, an understanding of the physical origins of sound transmission is necessary. The purpose of this thesis was, firstly, to study and compare the validity of existing physical models to predict the sound insulation of wall structures, and, secondly, to study the benefits of the sound intensity measurement method for determining the sound insulation. To develop the kind of knowledge that is applicable to the improvement of real wall and door structures was the motive behind this study. Five main results are summarized in the following. 1. It was possible to measure wall structures with a considerably, up to 22 dB, higher sound reduction index with the intensity method than with the pressure method. Thus, the intensity method enables the determination of sound insulation in the presence of strong <b>flanking</b> where the <b>pressure</b> method gives only an underestimate. 2. The sound transmission through doors was modelled by two separate paths: a structural path through the door leaf and a leaking path through the door slits. The structural path was predicted using Sharp's model. The agreement with measurements was reasonably good except at high frequencies where overestimations were obtained. The leaking path was predicted using the model of Gomperts and Kihlman. The agreement with measurements was good for free apertures. 3. Thirteen existing prediction models of double panels were compared. The variations in predicted sound reduction indices were high, 20   [...] .   40  dB. Further work is needed to rank different models according to their reliability for practical structures. In addition, there is an obvious need to develop a hybrid model where all the important parameters are considered. 4. A new flanking mechanism could be observed in situ for a floating floor covering over a concrete slab. Identical floor structures in adjacent dwellings led to strong flanking transmission at the double panel resonance frequency of the floors. Strong flanking could be avoided by modifying the double structure in one dwelling. 5. In general, the most typical design fault of sound insulating double structures was strong mechanical connections, either in the form of rigid interpanel connections (studs) or in the form of bonded cavity absorbent (sandwich structures). In the case of door structures, efforts are usually wasted {{on the development of the}} structure, while the leak transmission may be the main transmission path. The results of this study are useful when the intensity method is used in the presence of strong flanking sound, the sound insulation of wall and door structures are predicted or improved and when prediction models are developed. reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} into supercells {{has focused on}} narrowing the number of important storm processes that lead to these storms. For years it has been known that supercells generally deviate slightly {{to the left or}} right of the mean wind, but that in some rare cases, supercells move in a very atypical direction. For example, Corfidi (1998) examined the conditions present for the Jarrell, Texas tornado, which exhibited such an atypical motion, and found the environment to be extremely unstable with weak storm-relative helicity. He also found that the southwest movement of the Jarrell, TX storm was closely tied to the southwest movement of a strong convergence zone along a pre-existing boundary. This discrete propagation allowed the storm to move southwest despite mean cloud-layer winds indicating an east to northeast motion. An earlier study by Weaver (1979) found similar conditions for a tornadic supercell moving west, yet little has been studied concerning common parameter values among these events. The goal for this study will be to determine if any common characteristics exist among various parameters for these events. In determining storm type and evolution, wind shear has been found to play a significant role. Studies by Klemp et al. (1981), Rotunno and Klemp (1982, 1985), and Klemp(1987) found that midlevel rotation or mesocyclones are created by the tilting and stretching of the horizontal vorticity found in the pre-storm vertical wind shear. This vertical vorticity produces a dynamically induced pressure deficit that is strongest in the midlevels of the atmosphere, effectively establishing a non-hydrostatic pressure gradient on the storm 2 ̆ 7 s <b>flanks.</b> These vertical <b>pressure</b> gradients force the updraft to move toward a particular flank, thus allowing it to become best correlated with the vertical vorticity on that flank (Weisman 1996). Davies-Jones (1984) found that when streamwise vorticity was ingested into the updraft of a storm, it was converted to vertical vorticity within the updraft. A later study by Davies-Jones et al. (1990) found that Storm-Relative Helicity (SRH) in the lowest two or three kilometers of the atmosphere is most relevant {{to the development of a}} midlevel mesocyclone. They went on further to state that differing values of SRH often can be associated with weak, strong, and violent mesocyclones. Weisman (1996), found that the 0 - 4 km or 0 - 6 km wind shear of the pre-storm environment is more beneficial to the operational forecaster in anticipating supercell rotation compared to SRH since an estimate of storm motion is not needed to make the calculation. Another similar study from Colquhoun and Riley (1996), found that the surface- 600 mb shear magnitude to be best correlated with the intensity of a tornado. Although ambient vertical shear and SRH have been found to be well correlated with midlevel rotation within supercells, recent tornadogenesis studies have pointed to the importance of midlevel winds and their role in redistributing precipitation away from the updraft. Brooks et al. (1994 a,b) found that the midlevel storm-relative winds are important to the development of lowlevel mesocyclones, since their conceptual model indicates that the strength and lifetime of lowlevel mesocyclones is based on the balance between baroclinic generation of vorticity and storm outflow development. A later study by Rasmussen and Blanchard (1998) though showed that the same combination of parameters used by Brooks et al(1994 a,b) demonstrated little skill in discriminating between tornadic and non-tornadic supercells or discriminating between tornadic supercells and ordinary thunderstorms. Thompson (1998) used Eta model initialized soundings to calculate a storm-relative wind in the midlevels (500 mb) and near surface (15 mb above the surface). This study did show some success at discriminating between tornadic and non-tornadic environments when Eta model storm-relative winds at 500 mb and the surface exceeded 15 knots. Rasmussen and Straka (1998) evaluated a data set of supercells and concluded that low precipitation (LP) supercells generally have anvil-level storm-relative wind speeds 3 ̆e 54 kts (28 m/s), classic supercells have speeds between 35 and 54 kts (18 - 28 m/s), and high precipitation (HP) supercells generally have speeds 3 ̆c 35 kts (18 m/s). A very popular measure of instability defined by Moncrieff and Miller (1976) is Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE). Rasmussen and Blanchard (1998) used CAPE as one of their investigated parameters and found it had some utility at forecasting tornadic environments. Combining shear parameters with CAPE, further enhanced forecasting skill. In addition, Rasmussen and Blanchard (1998) investigated Energy-Helicity Index (EHI), Vorticity Generation Potential (VGP), and Bulk Richardson Number (BRN). They found that EHI and VGP showed the highest skill at discriminating between tornadic and non-tornadic environments, while BRN showed significantly less skill. Recently a study by Bunkers et al. (2000) described a method for forecasting supercell motion known as the Internal Dynamics (ID) method. The ID technique uses the 0 - 6 KM shear vector along with the mean wind to find a storm motion estimate. The advantage to this method is that it is Galilean invariant, meaning that the storm motion is the same, relative to the vertical wind shear, no matter where the vertical wind shear profile is positioned with respect to the origin of the hodograph. Because this technique has shown skill in predicting supercell motion compared to previous methods, this study will also test the Bunkers et al. (2000) scheme on storms exhibiting an atypical motion...|$|R
