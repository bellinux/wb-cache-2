It {{was announced}} that Darren would be tempted back into his gambling addiction. Series producer Emma Smithwick commented on the storyline explaining that because Darren was organising the wedding it was [...] "never going to be as smooth as if somebody else was organising it". She added that the wedding was a [...] "long time coming" [...] for the couple but there going to be [...] "a few obstacles in the way", some self-imposed and some caused by external forces. She added that the event would be in [...] "true Darren style". Dawson felt that {{at this point in the}} relationship Darren is [...] "besotted" [...] with Nancy. He explained that Darren feels Nancy is good for him but Darren almost feels undeserving of her. Dawson felt that Nancy was the love of Darren's life. Dawson commented that Darren had [...] "been through the mill" [...] but [...] "for once in his life, Darren is happy". Dawson put this down to Darren getting the Dog in the Pond back and his relationship with Nancy. On why Darren plans the wedding Dawson said: [...] "He wants to show Nancy how much he loves her and thinks a surprise wedding will do that". He explained that due to lack of funds Darren will [...] "have to call in a lot of favours but he hasn't got many friends". Dawson felt that Darren would have to see the idea through to the end, even if Darren would end up [...] "upside-down in mud". On how he felt the wedding would turn out Dawson said that [...] "it could be the tackiest thing ever" [...] but that it would be [...] "hilarious". On the wedding and Darren's feelings, Dawson said that his character is [...] "incredibly excited about it, especially after all the hard work and planning that he's been doing in secret for weeks and weeks". Dawson said that Darren feels like the wedding is [...] "going to be the most perfect day possible and he just can't wait to see the look on Nancy's face when she realises what he's been up to". Dawson went on to add that [...] "things don't go as he planned". Dawson said that he wants the wedding to go ahead, saying [...] "after all this it would be lovely to see them get married, but you never know with soaps. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be happy together". Dawson felt that the pair are the [...] "perfect match and are incredibly sweet together. Darren brings out Nancy's fun side and she gives his life a bit of order". Dawson went on to say he feels the pair are [...] "destined to be the Jack and Vera of Hollyoaks!" [...] Nancy's mother, Margaret Hayton (Darryl Fishwick), arrives in the village. Fox said that Margaret believes Darren is [...] "not good enough for Nancy" [...] so begins trying to split the pair up. Fox said that Margaret tries to [...] "make Nancy doubt her relationship with Darren". Nancy witnesses Darren and Cindy in an embrace which Fox said confirms to Nancy that [...] "everything her mum is saying is true - that Darren doesn't love her and he has been having an affair". When questioned if the pair can get through their troubles Fox said: [...] "I hope so! Myself and Ash have had an awful lot of fun working together, so I'd love to see a 'happily ever after'. Well, as much as it can be happy in soapland!" [...] Fox felt that if Nancy were to discover Darren's plans for their wedding she would be [...] "horrified" [...] although she would [...] "see that he has good intentions". Fox later said that Nancy [...] "really wants to get married, have babies and be happy" [...] with Darren, although Nancy may not ready to be a mother [...] "just yet". [...] Darren and Nancy marry. Dawson explained that Darren felt [...] "relief" [...] that the wedding went ahead as he [...] "often worried that Nancy is too good for him". Dawson commented that he thinks [...] "the characters work well together and they challenge each other all the time. It's quite comical, even when they're arguing. In many ways, Darren is a typical man and Nancy is a typical woman". On how married life will affect the couple Dawson said: [...] "it will change them is by giving a bit of solidity to their relationship. It proves to both of them how much they mean to each other, so if anything, I think it will make them stronger". Explaining why Darren went ahead with planning the surprise wedding Dawson said: [...] "he's got the pub back, he feels like he's learned all his lessons, and he's come full circle. This time around, Darren doesn't want to mess anything up and wants to get everything right. Now that they're married, having children is something that they'll look at in the future".|$|E

60|$|A {{portion of}} this {{troublesome}} quality is owing, beyond question, to our provincial habits, which are always the most exacting; but I think a large portion, perhaps I ought to say the largest, is inherited from those pious but exaggerated religionists who first peopled the country. These sectaries extended the discipline {{of the church to}} all the concerns of life. Nothing was too minute to escape their cognizance, and a parish sat in judgment on the affairs of all who belonged to it. One may easily live so long in the condition of society that such an origin has entailed on us, as to be quite unconscious of its peculiarities, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> hardly escape one who has lived much beyond its influence.|$|E

60|$|Reader, if {{you come}} from the more sunny side of the Tweed--or even if, being a Scot, you have had the {{advantage}} to be born within the last twenty-five years, you may be induced to think this portrait of Queen Elizabeth, in Dame Quickly's piqued hat and green apron, somewhat overcharged in the features. But I appeal to my own contemporaries, who have known wheel-road, bridle-way, and footpath, for thirty years, whether they do not, every one of them, remember Meg Dods--or somebody very like her. Indeed, so much is this the case, that, about the period I mention, I should have been afraid to have rambled from the Scottish metropolis, in almost any direction, lest I had lighted upon some one of the sisterhood of Dame Quickly, who might suspect me of having showed her up {{to the public in}} the character of Meg Dods. At present, though it is possible that some one or two of this peculiar class of wild-cats may still exist, their talons must be much impaired by age; and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> do little more than sit, like the Giant Pope, in the Pilgrim's Progress, at the door of their unfrequented caverns, and grin at the pilgrims over whom they used formerly to execute their despotism.|$|E

But what I am afraid of, is when such a book is summarised as 'It's actually just stigmatising strangers and that is racism', that does somewhat frighten me. And that does induce a safety risk, because types like Volkert van der G. do look at that, and that may be kept in their minds (...).' ...|$|E
5000|$|Following the {{addition}} of Jimmy Carlin, a former rider for Jamie Thomas's Mystery brand, on September 3, 2013, Hsu announced his departure from the company.

Trick Horse—a collection of hitherto unreleased non-Young recordings possibly derived from older Sampedro-funded sessions where session musicians were hired to play the instrumental parts, enabling the band to focus on their vocal performances—was released on iTunes in 2009. According to Young in a 2011 interview with American Songwriter, [...] "They have to be together before I can be together with them.

5000|$|The signing was {{confirmed}} by the manager on 30 July 1996 and was officially unveiled a week later in front of hundreds of journalists and around 15,000 fans who queued in the stadium car parks hoping {{to catch a glimpse}} of the player.

It's the money you've spent on your replica shirts, the money you've spent on your season tickets and your bonds, the programmes and the Black and White magazines" [...] whilst chairman Sir John Hall stated that [...] "now we must get some silverware in the cupboard.

5000|$|The {{indigenous}} people he encountered, the Lucayan, Taíno, or Arawak, were peaceful and friendly.

I believe that people from the mainland come here to take them as slaves. They ought to make good and skilled servants, for they repeat very quickly whatever we say to them. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> very easily be made Christians, for they seem to have no religion. If it pleases our Lord, I will take six of them to Your Highnesses when I depart, in order that they may learn our language."

Gabrielle's portrayal of Asperger syndrome was praised, with Jon Boyer of Autism New Zealand stating on her return to the soap in 2011; [...] "Autism New Zealand is thrilled that the character of Gabrielle Jacobs is returning to Shortland Street. The rise in awareness for Autism and Asperger's Syndrome that this character generated was fantastic and we commend Virginie Le Brun for the research she undertook before taking on this challenging role. We would like to congratulate the makers of Shortland Street for presenting Asperger's Syndrome in a fair, balanced yet very entertaining way." [...] Le Brun received positive feedback for her portrayal of Asperger's Syndrome. Mothers of teenagers with the syndrome said their children had taken pride in seeing Gabrielle's character on TV. Le Brun explained the benefits of portraying the role as helping educate viewers about Asperger's, stating; [...] "Kids who have Asperger's have tuned in where they might not have done so before. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> find it quite reassuring. We've had the odd email or mums saying they {{look at it as a}} bit of an inspiration that while things are difficult, you can do good things with your life."

5000|$|Winning manager JJ Doyle of Wexford said:”What the Wexford teams {{achieved}} {{out there}} today I doubt ever will be achieved again. We have been in six competitions in two years and we won every one of them. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> lay claim to {{being one of the}} greatest camogie teams ever to play the game now. The amount of work that went in was phenomenal. We did it because Wexford loves camogie and loves GAA.They weren't letting us run at them. It was the way it was in Bellefield earlier in the year, a game that was talked about an awful lot. People had said {{a lot of things about}} Wexford camogie, especially the senior team. People questioned our girl's hunger. People questioned our desire, said that Galway were going to be hungrier than us. They questioned a lot of things about the team. We wanted to get the opportunity to answer them. Thankfully we have done that.It is very hard to put into words what I feel right now. I feel extremely proud of the girls, all 48 that have been training with us. The first half seemed to go on for hours and the second half just flew by. Then we got into injury time and I thought it would never end. Anyone looking at that {{out there today}} will see that Wexford camogie is made of very very stern stuff. You don’t play for as many years as these girls have and not have the character.When Galway got the goal lesser teams would have buckled. I have learned a lot about the girls and they have learned a lot about themselves.” The losing manager Noel Finn of Galway stood down on the Sunday night of the All-Ireland final:I am very, very disappointed. Last year was hard to take but losing again today was devastation. The girls are devastated in there. We all are. Sport can be cruel, great when you win, very very hard to take when you lose. Scrappy first half. Two points downat half time, I felt we were in the game. We came out with all guns blazing in the second half. When we went three points in front and I thought we would have pushed on. Instead Wexford came back at us. They got the scores and they finished us. It was very, very exciting there. Anyone could have won as it went down to the wire. After they got the goal they sort of pushed on.” ...|$|E
