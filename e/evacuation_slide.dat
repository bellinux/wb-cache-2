5|$|The 767 entered {{service with}} United Airlines on September 8, 1982. The aircraft's first {{commercial}} flight used a JT9D-powered 767-200 on the Chicago-to-Denver route. The CF6-powered 767-200 commenced service {{three months later}} with Delta Air Lines. Upon delivery, early 767s were mainly deployed on domestic routes, including US transcontinental services. American Airlines and TWA began flying the 767-200 in late 1982, while Air Canada, China Airlines, and El Al began operating the aircraft in 1983. The aircraft's introduction was relatively smooth, with few operational glitches and greater dispatch reliability than prior jetliners. In its first year, the 767 logged a 96.1percent dispatch rate, which exceeded the industry average for new aircraft. Operators reported generally favorable ratings for the twinjet's sound levels, interior comfort, and economic performance. Resolved issues were minor and included the recalibration of a leading edge sensor to prevent false readings, the replacement of an <b>evacuation</b> <b>slide</b> latch, and the repair of a tailplane pivot to match production specifications.|$|E
25|$|On 29 August 2011, Gulf Air Flight 270, {{using an}} Airbus A320-214, from Bahrain to Cochin {{carrying}} 143 people, skidded off the runway on landing due to pilot error {{of loss of}} situational awareness during reduced visibility conditions. The weather was poor with heavy rain and strong winds. The aircraft was badly damaged with nose gear collapsed and seven passengers were injured. Some people {{were reported to have}} jumped from an emergency exit when the <b>evacuation</b> <b>slide</b> failed to deploy.|$|E
25|$|August 9, 2010: Flight 1052, The {{incident}} {{involved a}} flight attendant after JetBlue Airways Flight 1052 from Pittsburgh to New York City landed. The incident garnered significant media attention when, upon landing, Steven Slater, {{a flight attendant}}, announced over the plane's public address system {{that he had been}} abused by a passenger and that he quit his job. He then grabbed two beers and exited the plane by deploying the <b>evacuation</b> <b>slide</b> and sliding down it. Slater claimed to have been injured by a passenger when he instructed her to sit down. Slater's account of the event was not corroborated by others.|$|E
50|$|Aircraft safety {{cards and}} {{in-flight}} safety demonstrations show the passengers where the nearest emergency exits {{are and how}} to use the <b>evacuation</b> <b>slides.</b> Additionally, Flight Attendants receive extensive safety training that covers the use of <b>evacuation</b> <b>slides.</b>|$|R
50|$|Emergency {{evacuation}} systems include inflatable {{life rafts}} and manually extendable canvas <b>evacuation</b> <b>slides.</b> Most aircraft are now retrospectively fitted with emergency floor lighting strips and some aircraft equipped with automatically inflatable <b>evacuation</b> <b>slides.</b> Fire extinguishers are sited in engine nacelles, flightdeck compartment, cabin crew rest areas and toilets.|$|R

500|$|The 757 {{interior}} allows seat {{arrangements of}} up to six per row with a single center aisle. [...] Originally optimized for flights averaging two hours, the 757 features interior lighting and cabin architecture designs aimed at a more spacious impression. As on the 767, garment-bag-length overhead bins and a rear economy-class galley are standard equipment. The bins have twice the capacity as those on the preceding 727. To save weight, honeycomb sandwich is used for interior paneling and bins. Unlike previous <b>evacuation</b> <b>slide</b> designs which are not equipped for water landings, the 757's main exits feature combination slide rafts {{similar to those found}} on the 747. In the 1980s, Boeing altered the interior designs of its other narrow-body aircraft to be {{similar to that of the}} 757.|$|E

5000|$|Zodiac Evacuation Systems offers rescue {{systems such}} as {{inflatable}} lifejackets, <b>evacuation</b> <b>slides</b> and emergency flotation systems for helicopters.|$|R
5000|$|Certain <b>evacuation</b> <b>slides</b> {{do not use}} a slide bustle on {{the door}} as a container. Instead, the slide is [...] "fuselage mounted" [...] and is {{attached}} to a container located underneath or below the exit close to the aircraft exterior. This design of slide is found in the Airbus A321 aircraft at the emergency doors, and typically at all overwing <b>evacuation</b> <b>slides</b> other than the Boeing 747-400 series aircraft.|$|R
50|$|Any {{aircraft}} {{where the}} emergency exit door sill height is above that {{which would make}} unaided escape possible is fitted with an automatic inflatable <b>evacuation</b> <b>slide,</b> which allows occupants to slide to the ground safely.|$|E
50|$|Overwing exits {{are found}} on {{passenger}} aircraft {{to provide a}} means of evacuation onto the wing, where passengers either continue off the trailing edge by sliding down the extended flaps or by using an <b>evacuation</b> <b>slide</b> that deploys when the exit is opened.|$|E
50|$|An <b>evacuation</b> <b>slide</b> is an {{inflatable}} slide used to evacuate an aircraft quickly. An escape slide is required on all commercial (passenger carrying) aircraft where the door sill height is such that, {{in the event}} of an evacuation, passengers would be unable to step down from the door uninjured (Federal Aviation Administration requires slides on all aircraft doors where the floor is 6 ft or more above the ground).|$|E

25|$|After the {{investigation}} of this accident was completed, the FAA mandated changes {{to the design of}} <b>evacuation</b> <b>slides</b> to make them have more capacity and inflate at a quicker speed.|$|R
50|$|A ramp slide is an <b>evacuation</b> <b>slide</b> {{that has}} a small {{platform}} between the exit and the slide itself, and is used mainly where {{the proximity of the}} exit to an engine requires the slide to be angled away from the engine to prevent damage. Airbus A310, Airbus 340-600, Airbus A380 and Boeing 747 aircraft have ramp slide attachments for their overwing evacuation slides. The overwing exits on the Airbus A320 series, Boeing 757-variant and Boeing 767-variant aircraft also use ramp slide attachments.|$|E

50|$|On August 9, 2010, Steven Slater gained {{immediate}} global fame when {{he claimed}} he was injured by the luggage of a passenger whom he had confronted on an arriving JetBlue flight at New York's JFK Airport for disregarding his order to remain seated. Passengers dispute his account of this confrontation. As the incident continued, he cursed at the passengers over the aircraft's public address system, grabbed a beer, opened the <b>evacuation</b> <b>slide</b> and left the aircraft. He was later {{arrested and charged with}} several crimes.|$|E
25|$|Passengers {{began to}} {{disembark}} {{less than seven}} minutes later. The landing was smooth and no physical injuries were reported. The aircraft was evacuated via airstairs, as opposed to <b>Evacuation</b> <b>Slides</b> typically used in an emergency situation.|$|R
5000|$|Chute or Slide- {{attached}} to the ship and life rafts, it is stored in the stowage box. Inflatable slides are composed of polyurethane coated nylon fabrics making it sturdy. It ranges up to 13.6m in height, including single and double <b>evacuation</b> <b>slides</b> depending on the vessels preference.|$|R
2500|$|Two <b>evacuation</b> <b>slides</b> were {{deployed}} {{on the left}} side of the airliner and used for evacuation. Despite damage to the aircraft, [...] "many ... were able to walk away on their own". [...] The slides for the first and second doors on the right side of the aircraft (doors 1R and 2R) deployed inside the aircraft during the crash, pinning the flight attendants seated nearby.|$|R
50|$|An unhinged hatch type exit, {{where the}} hatch is {{unlocked}} {{from the inside}} and pulled into the cabin, whereupon it can be disposed. Some carriers recommend placing the hatch onto the adjacent seats, while others may recommend dropping it in the next seat row, or rotating the exit and throwing it outside the aircraft as far forward as possible. A manual inflation handle for the <b>evacuation</b> <b>slide,</b> if equipped, {{can be found in}} the window frame. Most aircraft overwing exits are of this type.|$|E
50|$|All the exits, {{except the}} 1R door and 2L door {{were used for}} evacuation. Senior flight {{attendant}} Wayne Reed could not open the 1L door. Flight attendant Susan Harelson deployed the <b>evacuation</b> <b>slide</b> at 1R; the 2R slide was disarmed before the door was opened because flight attendant Jolynn Galmish believed that the slide would float upward and block the exit. The 2L door was opened and then closed by Kelly Donovan when water entered the cabin. All four of the overwing exits were used to evacuate successfully.|$|E
50|$|Another unique type of <b>evacuation</b> <b>slide</b> {{is found}} on certain DC-9, MD-80 and Boeing 717 aircraft. This type of slide {{is in the}} aircraft's {{tailcone}}, and deploys after the tailcone is jettisoned by flight attendants, allowing for evacuation through {{the rear of the}} airframe. The procedure to use this exit may involve removing a plug-type pressure bulkhead, or a swing type door that leads directly to a walkway. At the end of the walkway is the slide pack and a manual tailcone jettison handle for use if the tailcone has not already been automatically jettisoned by opening the walkway entrance.|$|E
50|$|All new <b>evacuation</b> <b>slides</b> {{are tested}} on a mock-up of an {{aircraft}} exit door and filmed {{prior to being}} certified as airworthy and delivered to a customer. Also, new units are usually constructed of urethane materials and impregnated or coated with an aluminized coating so that the slide will survive {{for a short while}} even if fire is nearby. Older slides are yellow and made of neoprene/nylon fabric.|$|R
5000|$|Escape slides {{are packed}} and held within the door {{structure}} inside the slide bustle, a protruding {{part of the}} inside of an aircraft door that varies with aircraft size, door size and door location. In many modern planes, to reduce <b>evacuation</b> time, <b>evacuation</b> <b>slides</b> deploy automatically when a door is opened in an [...] "armed" [...] condition. Modern planes often indicate an armed condition with an indicator light.|$|R
5000|$|The {{flight crew}} {{initiated}} an emergency descent, and the aircraft was landed safely at Albuquerque International Sunport 19 {{minutes after the}} engine failed. 115 passengers and 12 crewmembers exited the aircraft by using the <b>evacuation</b> <b>slides.</b> As {{a result of the}} accident, one passenger died and 24 people were treated for smoke inhalation, ear problems, and minor abrasions. The plane was repaired and was later flown by Pan Am (as Clipper Meteor) ...|$|R
50|$|There are {{two types}} of {{aircraft}} evacuation slides: slides and slide/rafts. A slide is for use only on land as a means of escape, although it has sufficient buoyancy to allow passengers to hold on to a lanyard running the length of it {{and use it as a}} buoyancy aid. A slide/raft is an <b>evacuation</b> <b>slide</b> that can be used both as a means of escape in a land evacuation and as a life raft in a landing on water. Slide/rafts usually feature an erectable canopy, outer compartments to hold passengers and survival packs containing items such as leak stoppers, paddles and flares.|$|E

5000|$|The first {{aircraft}} <b>evacuation</b> <b>slide</b> {{was developed}} and produced by Air Cruisers, founded by James F. Boyle, inventor of the World War II life vest, the [...] "Mae West". [...] The patent for the inflatable escape chute assembly was submitted by Boyle in 1954 and the designs was patented in 1956 under patent number 2,765,131. Today Air Cruisers provides slides for over 65% of the aircraft slide market. Prior to inflatables, some passenger aircraft utilized canvas type slides which required the crew to undertake an extensive rigging procedure. Canvas type slides are still found on some Russian aircraft.|$|E
500|$|On October 28, 2016, American Airlines Flight 383, a 767-300ER with 161 {{passengers}} and 9 crew members, aborted takeoff at Chicago O'Hare Airport following an uncontained {{failure of the}} right GE CF6-80C2 engine. The engine failure, which hurled fragments over a considerable distance, caused a fuel leak resulting in a fire under the right wing. Fire and smoke entered the cabin. All {{passengers and}} crew evacuated the aircraft, with 20 passengers and one flight attendant sustaining minor injuries using the <b>evacuation</b> <b>slides.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Burgess focused most of {{her time}} on the Board towards cabin safety on aircraft, better galley and gallery security, jumpseat safety, and an {{unprecedented}} platform advocating for better <b>evacuation</b> <b>slides</b> and emergency interior lighting. In 1971, she was named [...] "Outstanding Woman in the Field of Life Support" [...] by the Survival and Flight Equipment Association. She was also named an honorary member of the Flight Attendants Association in 1972 for her work towards greater transportation safety. Burgess served on the NTSB until 1976.|$|R
2500|$|According to NBC {{reports in}} September 2013, the US {{government}} had {{been concerned about}} the reliability of <b>evacuation</b> <b>slides</b> for decades: [...] "Federal safety reports and government databases reveal that the NTSB has recommended multiple improvements to escape slides and that the Federal Aviation Administration has collected thousands of complaints about them." [...] Two months before the accident at SFO, the FAA issued an airworthiness directive ordering inspection of the slide release mechanism on certain Boeing 777 aircraft, so as to detect and correct corrosion that might interfere with slide deployment.|$|R
