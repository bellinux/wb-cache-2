5|$|Deivanai is {{generally}} depicted with her husband, particularly in an iconographic form called Senapati. She {{sits on the}} left thigh of the six-headed and twelve-armed Kartikeya. One of his arms holds her waist. Numerous depictions of the two exist at Tirupparankunram, the location of their marriage. However, in many south-Indian representations, when Murugan is depicted only with one consort, Valli is favoured over Devasena. In most South-Indian depictions, Murugan is depicted with both his consorts standing besides him; Devasena is on his left-hand side. Her complexion is yellow; she is often depicted adorned with a crown, earrings, necklaces and ornaments. She wears a traditional sari and has two arms. She holds a lotus in <b>her</b> <b>left</b> <b>arm,</b> while his right hand hangs down.|$|E
5|$|Wilson {{attempts}} to change House's drug habits, with little success. After Cuddy makes a bet to prove House's addiction to Vicodin, House concedes to Wilson {{that he has}} an addiction but says that the addiction is not a problem. It is, in fact, Wilson who usually writes House's Vicodin prescriptions (with Cuddy writing a few merely for leverage in her dealings with House). In Season 3, when Detective Michael Tritter (David Morse) threatens to jail House for his Vicodin addiction after finding a huge stash in his apartment, Wilson {{attempts to}} convince House to go to rehab as the situation worsens. After Tritter pressures Wilson to testify several times, Wilson reluctantly agrees, unknown to House. Before this, Wilson watches House punch Dr. Robert Chase, insult Cuddy, and incorrectly diagnose {{a child with a}} condition that would have required the amputation of <b>her</b> <b>left</b> <b>arm</b> and leg.|$|E
25|$|With {{the removal}} of all of her ribs on one side, Madonna was paralyzed from her neck through <b>her</b> <b>left</b> <b>arm</b> {{and was unable to}} sit up. Battling depression, fitted with a brace to provide support, Madonna made a long and arduous recovery, {{gradually}} regaining sensation. While recovering she learned from reading and practice in the Sanator classroom how to repair jewelry. She received certification in horology (watch/clock repair).|$|E
50|$|Thomas {{revealed}} in 2015 that {{a series of}} shooting stars inked {{on the inside of}} <b>her</b> lower <b>left</b> <b>arm</b> were not tattoos but were in fact transfers.|$|R
60|$|Miss D. (Capturing <b>her</b> friend's <b>left</b> <b>arm,</b> {{taking away}} all the books, placing books in 'rickshaw, {{returning}} to arm, securing hand by third finger and investigating.) Well! You bad girl! And you never told me.|$|R
2500|$|Agriculture is {{approximately}} [...] tall and {{carved out of}} Italian Carrara marble; the sculpture sits on a large cement base. A black label with the word [...] "AGRICULTURE" [...] in large gold letters is affixed to the base. The sculpture is a female form symbolizing agriculture. The figure has classical features, wears {{her hair in a}} bun with two looped braids, and is clothed in robes. Her robes are belted at the waist, as well as draped over <b>her</b> proper <b>left</b> <b>arm.</b> In <b>her</b> proper <b>left</b> <b>arm</b> she also holds wheat. <b>Her</b> proper <b>left</b> foot is extended forward, and her proper right foot is pointed behind her body (as if she {{is in the middle of}} a step).|$|R
25|$|In 1918, the Fox Film Corporation hired Weber {{to direct}} , in which Annette Kellerman swam and dove naked. However, she was {{replaced}} eventually by John G. Adolfi. In September 1918, Weber broke <b>her</b> <b>left</b> <b>arm</b> {{in two places}} when she fell in Barker Brothers, a downtown Los Angeles store, forcing her to be hospitalized in the California Hospital. Weber's arm was still causing her trouble seven months later.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the mass}} demonstrations of 1992 and 1993, neo-Nazi attacks on Turks {{continued}} throughout the 1990s. For example, on February 18, 1994, the Bayram family were attacked on their doorstep by a neo-Nazi neighbour in Darmstadt. The attack {{was not well}} publicised until one of the victims, Aslı Bayram, was crowned Miss Germany in 2005. The armed neo-Nazi neighbour shot Aslı on <b>her</b> <b>left</b> <b>arm</b> and then the attacker shot Aslı's father, Ali Bayram, who died from the gunshot.|$|E
25|$|In 1983, after {{filming the}} pilot episode for the {{television}} series Hotel, Davis {{was diagnosed with}} breast cancer and underwent a mastectomy. Within two weeks of her surgery, she suffered four strokes which caused paralysis in the left side of her face and in <b>her</b> <b>left</b> <b>arm,</b> and left her with slurred speech. She commenced a lengthy period of physical therapy, and aided by her personal assistant, Kathryn Sermak, gained partial recovery from the paralysis. Even late in life, Davis smoked 100 cigarettes a day.|$|E

40|$|Figure 1. Asymmetric {{hypertrophy}} of the <b>left</b> <b>arm</b> and {{in particular}} the left first and second digit macrodactyly. Figure 2. Osteohypertrophy of the metacarpals and phalanges. DESCRIPTION A mother brings her 8 -year-old daughter for evaluation because <b>her</b> daughter’s <b>left</b> <b>arm</b> and leg are becoming “more swollen. ” History reveals that the child was born with a pale pink mark over <b>her</b> <b>left</b> thigh that has darkened with time. The patient did not walk until 16 months...|$|R
25|$|A provincial, {{though not}} crude, small (7.5cm high) Roman bronze of a seated Epona, {{flanked by a}} small mare and stallion, found in England, is conserved in the British Museum. Lying on her lap and on the patera raised {{in her right hand}} are disproportionately large ears of grain; ears of grain also {{protrude}} from the mouths of the ponies, whose heads are turned towards the goddess. On <b>her</b> <b>left</b> <b>arm</b> she holds a yoke, which curves up above her shoulder, an attribute unique to this bronze statuette.|$|E
25|$|The work {{represents}} {{at least}} four nude women (or bathers) relaxing in a highly abstract landscape with vegetation and a small body of water visible through reflections and from {{the woman on the}} left whose legs are submerged from the knees down. The central figure holds the trunk of a tree with <b>her</b> <b>left</b> <b>arm</b> and a woman with her right, forming a tight central mass. The two nudes at the center, treated in a light color, stand-out against a darker background. They are flanked on both sides by a standing and a sitting nude.|$|E
25|$|Here, {{rather than}} the two straps that cross around Artemis A's chest, only one strap crosses over the figure's right {{shoulder}} and under <b>her</b> <b>left</b> <b>arm,</b> supporting part of the quiver that is still intact. The quiver itself was cast separately {{from the rest of}} the statue and had to be reattached to the statue at some point in antiquity, setting the quiver in a slightly different position than it had been originally. The quiver strap itself is also elaborate; it is decorated with a meander and dot pattern with silver inlay.|$|E
60|$|Nemesis is lame, {{but she is}} of colossal stature, {{like the}} gods; and sometimes, while her sword is not yet unsheathed, she {{stretches}} out <b>her</b> huge <b>left</b> <b>arm</b> and grasps <b>her</b> victim. The mighty hand is invisible, but the victim totters under the dire clutch.|$|R
5000|$|The {{sculpture}} {{depicts a}} figure of a woman cut from a thin piece of metal. She [...] "wears" [...] a sleeveless dress, high heels and has short, straight hair. She is walking; with <b>her</b> proper <b>left</b> <b>arm</b> swinging above <b>her</b> head and her proper right arm back behind her.|$|R
60|$|Poor Violette, {{looking as}} miserable as her master, was led round and I {{was told to}} mount <b>her.</b> My <b>left</b> <b>arm</b> was tied with a thong which was {{fastened}} to the stirrup-iron of a sergeant of Dragoons. So in most sorry plight I and the remnant of my men set forth from Minsk.|$|R
25|$|The taller {{of the two}} Artemis statues, a quiver strap runs diagonally {{over the}} figure's right {{shoulder}} and under <b>her</b> <b>left</b> <b>arm.</b> There is a trace of lead solder on the strap on the statue’s back, which shows where the quiver was attached. Her hand still contains a lump of clay {{that was used to}} anchor her bow. There are also two small, bronze remnants of a phiale (offering bowl) that she would have held in her upturned right hand. This stance is in fact one of the stances in which Artemis and Apollo were often portrayed in Greek art.|$|E
25|$|Little {{is known}} of her education. She played the piano, painted, took ballet lessons, was a good swimmer and worked {{for a short time}} as a governess for a family in Cambridge. She had {{multiple}} health problems. She was diagnosed with tuberculosis of the bone in <b>her</b> <b>left</b> <b>arm</b> when she was a child; this was before the discovery of antibiotics and apparently little could be done about it. She was treated by Sir Frederick Treves and said she had had so many operations, she had no memory of her life before the age of seven.|$|E
25|$|Her coach {{had advised}} her {{to hold back}} on her swim speed, {{otherwise}} she {{might not be able}} to complete the race; together with the lack of power in <b>her</b> <b>left</b> <b>arm,</b> that meant her swim was much slower than usual at 61minutes. In contrast with her previous races at Kona, where Wellington had dominated on the bike, she started the marathon stage with five women still in front of her. Wellington's main concern, though, was Mirinda Carfrae, the 2010 champion who was only a little over three minutes behind her, and the only woman who had run faster than her on this course – a serious worry, given Wellington's injuries.|$|E
50|$|Bessie {{had some}} {{involvement}} in midwifery, disclosing that as usual {{she could do}} nothing for them without Thomas's assistance, specifically {{he gave her a}} green silk lace that she tied around <b>her</b> clients <b>left</b> <b>arm</b> in contact with the skin. She treated the children of John Jack and Wilson of Townhead with herbs and they recovered.|$|R
60|$|He covered Craig {{with his}} revolver, but his arm was {{scarcely}} extended before Feerda sprang {{at him like}} a little wild-cat. He gripped <b>her</b> with his <b>left</b> <b>arm</b> and held <b>her</b> away with difficulty.|$|R
60|$|Then, mounting, {{he slipped}} {{behind her and}} lifted and turned her, and then held <b>her</b> with his <b>left</b> <b>arm</b> so that she lay across the saddle and his knees, her head against his shoulder.|$|R
25|$|On March 12, 2011, Giffords's husband {{informed}} her that six {{other people had}} been killed in the attack on her, but he did not identify who they were until months later. In late April, Giffords's doctors reported that her physical, cognitive, and language production abilities had improved significantly, placing her in the top 5 percent of patients recovering from similar injuries. She was walking under supervision with perfect control of <b>her</b> <b>left</b> <b>arm</b> and leg, and able to write with her left hand. She was able to read and understand, and spoke in short phrases. With longer efforts, she was able to produce more complex sentences.|$|E
25|$|Mitsuko Hane is Reiji's and later, Aoi's, private teacher. She is an alum of Hakuto Junior High School {{and has won}} the Japan National Music Contest twice consecutively. However, {{after her}} mother's death, she got emotionally {{involved}} with fellow violinist Bartholomew. The pressure for her to win the contest a third time and her unrequited love for Bartholomew, resulted in a fire accident, burning <b>her</b> <b>left</b> <b>arm,</b> effectively disabling her from playing the violin. She spent {{the next four years}} in hospital. Afterwards, she became a music teacher. She later was chosen to be Reiji's teacher. She still has affections for Bartholomew after what he did to her.|$|E
25|$|Reiji Saioin, the top violinist in Hakuto Junior High School, is to {{be kicked}} out of the school if he does not win the next Japan National Music Contest due to his history of trouble. His private teacher and alum of Hakuto, Mitsuko Hane, is willing to help Reiji {{overcome}} his flaws to win the music contest. She wants Reiji to play the violin because she cannot due to <b>her</b> <b>left</b> <b>arm</b> being rendered useless after being burnt. Reiji has his own wishes to keep his sister, Miruka, who is abused by their father, happy. Along the way to win the music contest, Reiji becomes friends with Nachi Meiya, the best female violinist in Hakuto, and Aoi Kenzaki, a pianist-turned-violinist. He also has to deal with Bartholomew Asakura, the man who ruined Hane's arm, as well as his growing feelings for his teacher.|$|E
50|$|The {{figure on}} the left (from {{the point of view}} of the viewer) has her legs crossed and holds a swaddled infant in her lap, with its head resting on <b>her</b> lower <b>left</b> <b>arm</b> and <b>her</b> right hand on the baby's wrapped up legs. The central figure appears to hold only a piece of cloth, rolled open on her lap, while the {{figure on the}} right holds a small dish in her right hand and a very hole-y sponge in <b>her</b> <b>left</b> hand. There seems to be a shawl spread out on her lap.|$|R
60|$|The mate sprang at her, but she dodged {{round the}} table. He leaned over, and, {{catching}} <b>her</b> by the <b>left</b> <b>arm,</b> drew <b>her</b> towards him; then, with her flushed, laughing face close to his, he forgot everything else, and kissed her.|$|R
60|$|Manuela, {{helpless}} and horror-struck, had stood motionless {{on the spot}} where the chief had released her. Lawrence caught <b>her</b> in his <b>left</b> <b>arm,</b> swung <b>her</b> into an angle of the broken wall, placed himself in front, and faced his foes.|$|R
25|$|Despite {{the rumors}} of arrests and deportations, {{trickling}} in from Istanbul and other Ottoman cities, many of Musa Dagh’s Armenians remain unconcerned about the outside world. It is not until four refugees arrive in Yoghonoluk in late April, {{that the full}} nature of what the Ottoman government is doing becomes clear, for the refugees bring news of the brutal suppression of an Armenian uprising, {{in the city of}} Zeitun and the mass deportation that followed. In a long passage, Werfel tells the story of Zeitun and introduces three more important characters of the book, the Protestant pastor Aram Tomasian, his pregnant wife Hovsannah, his sister Iskuhi, a quasi-feral orphan girl named Sato and Kevork, a houseboy who had suffered brain damage as a child, {{at the hands of the}} Turks. Iskuhi, too, is a victim of a more recent atrocity. <b>Her</b> <b>left</b> <b>arm</b> is paralyzed from fending off a rape attempt. Despite her deformity, the Armenian girl’s beauty and eyes attract Bagradian.|$|E
25|$|A decade earlier, the {{illustrator}} Charles Edmund Brock {{extended into}} the 20th century what {{is almost a}} pastiche of the 18th century conversation piece in his “Circe and the Sirens” (1925). In this the Honourable Edith Chaplin (1878–1959), Marchioness of Londonderry, and her three youngest daughters are pictured in a garden setting grouped about a large pet goat. Three women painters also produced portraits using the convention of the sitter in character. The earliest was Beatrice Offor (1864–1920), whose sitter's part in her 1911 painting of Circe {{is suggested by the}} vine-leaf crown in her long dark hair, the snake-twined goblet she carries and the snake bracelet on <b>her</b> <b>left</b> <b>arm.</b> Mary Cecil Allen was of Australian origin but was living in the United States at the time “Miss Audrey Stevenson as Circe” was painted (1930). Though only a head and shoulders sketch, its colouring and execution suggest the sitter’s lively personality. Rosemary Valodon (born 1947), from the same country, painted a series of Australian personalities in her goddess series. “Margarita Georgiadis as Circe” (1991) is a triptych, the central panel of which portrays an updated, naked femme fatale reclining in tropical vegetation next to a pig’s head.|$|E
25|$|Phúc {{was removed}} from her {{university}} as a young adult studying medicine and used as a propaganda symbol by the communist government of Vietnam. In 1986, however, she was granted permission to continue her studies in Cuba. She had converted from her family's Cao Đài religion to Christianity four years earlier. Prime Minister of Vietnam Phạm Văn Đồng became her friend and patron. After arriving in Cuba, she met Bui Huy Toan, another Vietnamese student and her future fiancé. In 1992, Phúc and Toan married. On the way to their honeymoon in Moscow, they left the plane during a refuelling stop in Gander, Newfoundland, and asked for political asylum in Canada, which was granted. The couple now live in Ajax, Ontario, near Toronto, and have two children. In 1996, Phúc met the surgeons who had saved her life. The following year, she passed the Canadian Citizenship Test with a perfect score and became a Canadian citizen. In 2015, {{it was reported that}} she was receiving laser treatment at a hospital in Miami, Florida, to reduce the scarring on <b>her</b> <b>left</b> <b>arm</b> and back. The treatment is being provided free of charge.|$|E
50|$|Redman {{is badly}} scarred on <b>her</b> upper <b>left</b> <b>arm</b> {{as a result}} of an {{accident}} when she was 15 months old. She was scalded with a pan of boiling turkey-and-vegetable soup and suffered burns to 75% of her body. Her arm was the only part of her body permanently affected, but the trauma was so severe that she was pronounced clinically dead at the Queen Victoria Hospital in East Grinstead, Sussex.|$|R
25|$|This Realist {{sculpture}} {{depicts a}} Mary Magdalene emerging from an alcove consisting of three granite blocks that surround her. Dressed in long robes and a cape which covers her head, her proper right hand is raised {{to lift the}} cape from her head. <b>Her</b> proper <b>left</b> <b>arm</b> is extended outward in front of her. Her proper right leg is stepping forward, to recognize Jesus Christ has risen from his tomb on Easter.|$|R
50|$|Christian {{journalist}} and critic of Syria May Chidiac was seriously injured when a bomb exploded {{as she got}} into her car in Jounieh on 25 September. She lost <b>her</b> <b>left</b> leg and <b>arm.</b> Chidiac was a news anchor at the Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation.|$|R
