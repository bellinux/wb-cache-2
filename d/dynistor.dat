40|$|The {{measurement}} of the pulse switch state current of RSD (Reversely Switching <b>Dynistor)</b> device is crucial to transmit the energy efficiently with high stability and reliability. The novel CT (current transformer) centered on self-integrating Rogowski coil is proposed. The operation principle, methods for properly choosing electric parameters both of RSD-based pulse switch experimental loop and the self-integrating Rogowski coil are presented. The error characteristics of the CT instrumentation are analyzed. The prototype CT centered on the self-integrating Rogowski coil according to the proposed theory and methods are introduced. Experimental results acquired by the proposed CT system are given. Experimental results can verify {{the validity of the}} novel CT measurement system...|$|E
40|$|A {{high-power}} (250 kA and 25 kV) {{compact switch}} {{based on an}} assembly of reversed switch-on <b>dynistors</b> (RSDs) connected in series and a coaxial saturable-core choke, which is necessary for their effective switching, is described. An essential feature of this switch is a drastic reduction of the duration of RSDs control pulse, which allows using minimum dimensions and low inductance saturable core choke and obtain high rise rate (more than 30 kA/µs) of the switched current. The increased RSDs control pulse amplitude and rise rate that are required for RSDs switching on by reduced duration triggering pulse are attained by using a fast switch based on new type semiconductor devices deep-level <b>dynistors</b> (DLDs) ...|$|R
40|$|New {{generation}} of semiconductor closing switches based on reverse switched <b>dynistors</b> (RSD) {{has been developed}} to switch high – power current pulses with microsecond duration. In this report the results of theoretical and experimental investigations of RSD at peak current more than 500 kA and pulse duration up to 500 μs (at 0. 1 Imax) are observed. The criteria of extreme peak current for switch taking into consideration the longtime performance under pulse-periodical mode are gave. The design and test results for switch under single pulse mode at operating voltage up to 25 kV and peak current up to 300 kA are described. The possibility of using such a switch in the ISKRA- 6 capacitor bank is estimated...|$|R
40|$|Basing on 2 D {{computer}} simulation of physical processes in high-voltage reversibly-switched <b>dynistors</b> (RSD) important peculiarities of their submicrosecond pulse performance mechanisms have been studied. It is characteristic that on {{early stages of}} switching fronts rather great voltage spikes and dangerous delays in current rise are observed. These undesirable manifestations {{are found to be}} eliminated due to appropriate reduction of the doping in p-base. Following this way for RSD with blocking voltage of 2. 5 - 5 kV at the value of reversibly pumped charge 5 - 10 uC/cm^ 2 one can diminished the switching front duration up to 75 - 100 ns and lower. As for the current rise rate it can be increased up to (20 - 30) A/cm^ 2 /ns, i. e., more then the order higher of the similar parameter for the standard RSD. For the switching pulse amplitudes of few unites kA and with the total pulse duration of several hundred nanoseconds the energy transmitted to the load can reach fractions and units of joules per cycle at the power losses in RSD nearly 10 % of these values.
