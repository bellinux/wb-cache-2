25|$|White Americans {{have the}} second highest median {{household}} income and personal income levels in the nation, by cultural background. The median income per household member was also the highest, since White Americans had the smallest households of any racial demographic in the nation. In 2006, the median individual income of a White American age 25 or older was $33,030, with those who were full-time employed, and of age 25 to 64, earning $34,432. Since 42% of all households had two income earners, the median household income was considerably higher than the median personal income, which was $48,554 in 2005. Jewish Americans rank first in household income, personal income, and educational attainment among White Americans. In 2005, White households had a median household income of $48,977, which is 10.3% above the national median of $44,389.

Data for all 114 counties in the state of Missouri are collected. Due to the presence of endogeneity, two-state least squares parameter estimation is carried. Results indicate income gains associated from increments in <b>educational</b> <b>attainment</b> <b>levels.</b> The effects of public capital stocks are not as clear-cut.

40|$|Our study aims to {{determine}} the sources {{of growth in the}} Boise-Nampa Metro Area. Research has shown that increases in <b>educational</b> <b>attainment</b> <b>levels</b> and increases in productivity are highly positively correlated.

Therefore, our research will examine the effect of <b>educational</b> <b>attainment</b> <b>levels</b> on median wage in the Boise metro area {{to determine}} whether higher high school graduation rates lead to a higher median wage in Boise. We will present an analysis of the median wage and <b>educational</b> <b>attainment</b> between 1950 to 2013. We will use data from the US Census Bureau and the Gem State Prospector in our analysis. We will also present a comparison between Boise-Nampa MSA, Colorado Springs MSA, Spokane MSA, and Des Moines MSA in terms of <b>educational</b> <b>attainment</b> <b>levels</b> and median wage. These cities have similar size, political leaning, and racial makeup as the Boise-Nampa MSA. We expect to show a link between increases in <b>educational</b> <b>attainment</b> and wage growth...|$|R

To cover all aspects of analysis, three different analysis methods were used. The first was based on a descriptive analysis. The second was based on the calculation of the rates of return on education through linking the wage levels with unemployment. And the third focused on the utilization of the Dynamic Probit Model to examine the probability for unemployment during the Intifada for four <b>educational</b> <b>attainment</b> <b>levels.</b> The results showed that <b>educational</b> <b>attainment</b> has a key role to play in reducing unemployment, and that the Palestinian Labor market is saturated with persons with low <b>educational</b> <b>attainment...</b>|$|R

The possible reasons as to why Asians Americans were used by White America as this image of a model minority are that they were viewed as having not been as much of a [...] "threat" [...] to White America due to less of a history of political activism in fighting racism, their smaller population, the success of their numerous businesses (nearly all of which were small businesses) in their segregated communities, and {{the fact that}} during the time period Chinese, Japanese and Filipino Americans' <b>educational</b> <b>attainment</b> <b>level</b> was meeting the national average equaling Whites in terms of education.|$|E
50|$|Individuals having origins {{within the}} Far East, Southeast Asia or the Indian subcontinent are {{referred}} to as Asian under the U.S. Census Bureau.

Asian Americans have had the highest <b>educational</b> <b>attainment</b> <b>level</b> and median household income of any racial demographic in the country and attain the highest median personal income overall, as of 2008. Thus, Asian American Culture is often depicted as the most similar culture to American Culture. Asian Americans often communicate non-verbally and/or indirectly, and often are not as bold or upfront as other cultures in terms of their communication. The Asian American way of life is much more group-oriented or holistic and thus {{the way in which they}} interpret the world is systematically different from American Culture in terms of thought process and lifestyle. This may make it difficult for Asian Americans to assimilate easily into American culture.|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of socioeconomic factors on {{standardized test scores}} has been long debated and studied. This paper examines the relationship between family income and state-mandated achievement test scores for students in the State of Georgia. We first use a simple linear regression model of average test score and average household income to first establish a positively correlated relationship. This relationship is further analyzed by differentiating for other community-based factors (race, household type, and <b>educational</b> <b>attainment</b> <b>level)</b> in three multiple variable regression models. For comparison and to evaluate any consistencies these variables may have, the regressions were run on data from both 2007 and 2014. In both cases, the final multiple regressions found that average household income {{was not statistically significant}} in impacting the average test scores of the counties studied, while household type and <b>educational</b> <b>attainment</b> <b>level</b> were statistically significant...|$|E
40|$|This article {{studies the}} {{relationship}} between employee training and institutional factors of initial skill formation and industrial relations across 14 European countries. Rather than focusing on individual participation rates and returns, {{the aim is to}} explain the observed country variation in training incidence and its returns. It turns out that there are direct links between the system of initial skill formation and training that differ between incidence and returns. Although cross-country training incidence seems to vary according to <b>educational</b> <b>attainment</b> <b>levels</b> and the financial input into education, the returns to training are strongly associated with the quality and stratification of secondary schooling. This finding suggests that the aggregate level of training provided is associated with <b>educational</b> <b>attainment</b> <b>levels</b> in terms of skill demand as well as educational expenditure, whereas training-related productivity gains are higher in systems in which school leavers and the workforce actually do possess higher skills. Educational stratification seems to increase inequality beyond education by increasing training-related earnings differentials...|$|R

40|$|As {{the cost}} of college {{continues}} to increase, state funding for higher education is decreasing. Students now face a growing burden to finance their education. As a result, state funded student grant programs, including need and nonneed based programs, are becoming increasingly important to improving the accessibility of higher education. Using data presented by the National Association of State Student Grant and Aid Programs’ Annual Survey Reports on State-Sponsored Student Financial Aid for 2002 - 2003, 2006 - 2007, and 2011 - 2012, this paper seeks to understand what factors best predict the structure and outcomes of state funded grant programs. These factors include state <b>educational</b> <b>attainment</b> <b>levels,</b> income inequality, and a multidimensional measure of state partisanship. While I find some correlation between state funding for student grant programs and the independent variables of state income inequality and state <b>educational</b> <b>attainment</b> <b>levels,</b> there is no relationship found between political factors and state funding for student grant programs. I conclude less numerically observable variables within the states and within legislatures {{play a role in}} determining funding allocations for state funded student grant programs...|$|R

Participants (254 girls, 211 boys) were three cohorts of students in Grades 3, 4, and 5 from ten elementary schools. Results from structural equation modeling revealed that academic self-concept predicted <b>educational</b> <b>attainment</b> <b>level</b> ten years later over and above prior achievement. Moreover, this pattern of results was invariant across cohorts. In addition, regression analyses based on a restricted sample (n= 243) indicated that the academic self-concept/educational attainment level relation was still significant while controlling for family SES, family structure (single parent vs. two parent family), and academic achievement. Discussion focuses on the theoretical and practical implications of the results.
