5|$|After these events, Ueshiba {{seemed to}} slowly grow away from Takeda, {{and he began}} to change his art. These changes are {{reflected}} in the differing names with which <b>he</b> <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> his system, first as aiki-jūjutsu, then Ueshiba-ryū, Asahi-ryū, and aiki budō. In 1942, when Ueshiba's group joined the Dai Nippon Butoku Kai, the martial art that Ueshiba developed finally {{came to be known as}} aikido.|$|E
5|$|Screaming mouths {{appears in}} many of Bacon's works from the late 1940s to the early 1950s. The motif was {{developed}} from sources including medical textbooks, and images of the nurse in the Odessa Steps sequence in Sergei Eisenstein's 1925 silent film Battleship Potemkin. Bacon kept a close-up still of the screaming nurse, {{at the moment when}} she has been shot in the eye. <b>He</b> <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> the still in paintings throughout his career.|$|E
5|$|The first {{recorded}} writing mentioning this site is from William Worcester in about 1480 when <b>he</b> <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> it as Myghell-borough. A medieval church dedicated to St Michael, {{belonging to the}} Athelney Abbey, dates from at least the mid-15th century. This formed a sanctuary for royalist troops in 1642 and 1645 during the English Civil War, and a detachment of the king's army occupied it in 1685 {{during the course of}} the Monmouth Rebellion.|$|E

5|$|The work ventures into transcendentalism, relying {{strongly}} on intuition, {{a movement}} and practice he had despised. Though he criticized the transcendental movement for what <b>he</b> <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> as incoherent mysticism, Eureka is more mystical than most transcendental works. Eureka {{has also been}} compared to the theories of Mary Baker Eddy, founder of Christian Science and Joseph Smith, founder of the Latter Day Saint movement.|$|E
5|$|Within a year, he {{abandoned}} her and married Annia Aurelia Faustina, {{a descendant of}} Marcus Aurelius and the widow of a man he had recently had executed. He had returned to his second wife Severa {{by the end of}} the year. According to Cassius Dio, his most stable relationship seems to have been with his chariot driver, a blond slave from Caria named Hierocles, whom <b>he</b> <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> as his husband.|$|E
5|$|Andrée gave a glowingly optimistic {{account of}} {{the ease with which}} these {{requirements}} could be met. Larger balloons had been constructed in France, he claimed, and more airtight, too. Some French balloons had remained hydrogen-filled for over a year without appreciable loss of buoyancy. As for the hydrogen, filling the balloon at the launch site could easily be done with the help of mobile hydrogen manufacturing units; for the steering <b>he</b> <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> his own drag-rope experiments with the Svea, stating that a deviation of 27degrees from the wind direction could be routinely achieved.|$|E

5|$|Archaeologist William R. Coe {{divided the}} Mundo Perdido complex into two clearly demarcated areas that <b>he</b> <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> as the High Plaza and the Low Plaza. The High Plaza {{is the area}} around the Lost World Pyramid. It is closed on the south side by Structures 6C-24 and 6C-25. A range of eight {{adjoining}} structures divide the High Plaza from the Plaza of the Seven Temples to the east. On the north side, the Plaza is principally delimited by Structures 5D-77, 5C-45, 5C-46, together with some smaller structures. The Low Plaza lies {{to the west of the}} Lost World Pyramid, centred upon Structure 5C-53, a low platform. The Low Plaza is closed on its north side by the Talud-Tablero Temple (5C-49), which is the second largest structure in the whole complex.|$|E
5|$|Around 1925, {{having had}} little success in Batavia, Andjar moved to Padang, {{where he was}} a {{reporter}} for the daily Sinar Soematera. At the same time, he worked with the city's Padangsche Opera, writing stage plays. In contrast to the standard musical theatre of the time, bangsawan, he promoted a more natural style, using dialogue instead of song to convey the story; <b>he</b> <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> this as toneel, based on the Dutch word for theatre. Among the works he wrote for the Padangsche Opera were adaptations of Melati van Agam, a 1923 work by Swan Pen, and Sitti Nurbaya, a 1922 novel by Marah Roesli. These works were well received.|$|E
5|$|As {{promised by}} Fillmore, treaty commissioners arrived in La Pointe in 1854 to {{conclude}} a final treaty. Recalling {{the experiences of}} 1837 and 1842, the Ojibwa leaders sought to control the negotiations in 1854. Ambiguity in those treaties had been partially to blame for ensuing problems, so Buffalo insisted he would accept no interpreter other than Armstrong, whom <b>he</b> <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> as his adopted son. The Ojibwa insisted on a guarantee {{of the right to}} hunt, fish, and gather on all the ceded territory, and on the establishment on several reservations across western Upper Michigan, northern Wisconsin, and northeastern Minnesota. In his mid-nineties and in failing health, Buffalo directed the negotiations but left most of the speaking to other chiefs. He entrusted Armstrong with taking care of the details in the written version.|$|E

5|$|DuBois rose to {{national}} prominence {{as the leader}} of the Niagara Movement, a group of African-American activists who wanted equal rights for blacks. DuBois and his supporters opposed the Atlanta compromise, an agreement crafted by BookerT. Washington which provided that Southern blacks would work and submit to white political rule, while Southern whites guaranteed that blacks would receive basic educational and economic opportunities. Instead, DuBois insisted on full civil rights and increased political representation, which he believed would be brought about by the African-American intellectual elite. <b>He</b> <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> this group as the Talented Tenth and believed that African Americans needed the chances for advanced education to develop its leadership.|$|E
5|$|Earlier, Cotillo {{had opposed}} the anti-immigration {{restrictions}} of the Immigration Act of 1924 that significantly limited immigration from Italy. In 1931, Cotillo protested against unnecessary stringent {{requirements of a}} proposed registration law, particularly the requirement of {{the equivalent of a}} public school education and the fingerprinting of applicants. A naturalized citizen had the same rights as native-born and fingerprinting would make the foreign applicant feel like a criminal, Cotillo pointed out. <b>He</b> <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> the findings of the Wickersham Commission that the foreign-born committed considerably less crime than native citizens. He also attacked the revocation of citizenship because of evil doing, while a native born was not affected. At the time, Cotillo claimed to have naturalized some 25,000 immigrants in the eight years he had been on the bench.|$|E
5|$|Father Secchi {{produced}} {{some of the}} first color illustrations of Mars in 1863. He used the names of famous explorers for the distinct features. In 1869, he observed two dark linear features on the surface that <b>he</b> <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> as canali, which is Italian for 'channels' or 'grooves'. In 1867, English astronomer Richard A. Proctor created a more detailed map of Mars based on the 1864 drawings of English astronomer William R. Dawes. Proctor named the various lighter or darker features after astronomers, past and present, who had contributed to the observations of Mars. During the same decade, comparable maps and nomenclature were produced by the French astronomer Camille Flammarion and the English astronomer Nathan Green.|$|E

5|$|Franklin {{was first}} {{attracted}} {{to the study of}} electricity when he saw the showman Archibald Spencer do magic demonstrations in Boston (1743) and in Philadelphia (1744). He purchased Spencer's equipment and used it for his electricity experiments after these demonstrations were completed. <b>He</b> <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> Spencer as Dr. Spence from Scotland. In 1746, at the age of forty years, Franklin began turning over the affairs of his printing company to his business partner David Hall, and went into semi-retirement so he could carry out research on electricity; initially using Spencer's equipment.|$|E
5|$|He re-invented the {{practice}} of stiff-arming his tacklers, which {{had gone out of}} favor among running backs in the 1970s. At times, he used his high school experience as a long jumper to leap over his opponents, landing on his head in the end zone to gain a touchdown in a game against the Buffalo Bills. His running gait was somewhat unusual, as his knees were minimally bent, and the motion was largely powered from the hip. This may have given his knees, a football player's most vulnerable joints, some protection, although he underwent arthroscopic surgery on both knees in 1983. <b>He</b> <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> this procedure as an 11,000-yard checkup.|$|E
5|$|In April 1922, Kenyatta began a job {{working as}} a stores clerk and meter reader for Cook, who had been {{appointed}} water superintendent for the Nairobi municipal council. In this position he earned 250 shillings a month, a particularly high wage for a native African, which brought him financial independence and {{a growing sense of}} self-confidence. Kenyatta lived in Kilimani, although financed the construction of a second home at Dagoretti; <b>he</b> <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> this latter hut as the Kinyata Stores for he used it to hold general provisions for the neighbourhood. He had sufficient funds that he could lend money to European clerks in the offices, and could enjoy the lifestyle offered by Nairobi, which included cinemas, football matches, and imported British fashions.|$|E
