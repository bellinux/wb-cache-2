40|$|E-mail {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used ways of written {{communication}} over the internet, and its traffic has increased exponentially with the advent of World Wide Web. The increase in email traffic comes also with an increase in the use of emails <b>for</b> <b>illegitimate</b> <b>purpose.</b> Phishing, Spamming, email bombing, threatening, cyber bullying, racial vilification, terrorist activities, child pornography and sexual harassment are common examples of e-mail abuses. So, there is a need for e-mail mining. Various methods and approaches were used by the scientists for classification of email messages in above categories. In this paper we are presenting various techniques and approaches used by researchers for email mining and subsequent classification...|$|R
40|$|Equal {{protection}} law {{today is}} divided. When minorities challenge laws of general application {{and argue that}} government has segregated or profiled {{on the basis of}} race, plaintiffs must show that government acted for a discriminatory purpose, a standard that doctrine has made extraordinarily difficult to satisfy. In discriminatory purpose cases, the ways that citizens experience state action is not constitutionally significant. By contrast, when members of majority groups challenge state action that classifies by race - affirmative action has become the paradigmatic example - plaintiffs do not need to demonstrate, as a predicate for judicial intervention, that government has acted <b>for</b> an <b>illegitimate</b> <b>purpose.</b> Strict scrutiny doctrine imposes restrictions on affirmative action that expressly take into consideration the ways citizens experience state action...|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} a conceptual {{map of the}} purposes served by continuing custody of prisoners of war and captured non-combatants. Morally legitimate and non-controversial purposes include preventing prisoners of war from rejoining their comrades-in-arms, preventing both prisoners of war and captured non-combatants from giving material support to combatants still in the field, facilitating orderly release and repatriation {{at the end of}} hostilities, and the prosecution for war crimes. Morally <b>illegitimate</b> <b>purposes</b> include punishment, exploitation as conscript labour, recruitment or conscription as combatants, exploitation for intelligence, display as proof of victory, and ideological indoctrination. Analysis of historical cases illustrating each purpose reveal that continuing custody is often motivated by multiple purposes, both legitimate and illegitimate. What explains adoption of multiple and <b>illegitimate</b> <b>purposes</b> <b>for</b> continuing custody? Prisoners are available <b>for</b> legitimate and <b>illegitimate</b> <b>purposes</b> because neither elites nor masses within the captor state typically view prisoners as members of the moral community. 1 Continuing custody does not alter the perceived status of the captured as aliens who cannot be intuitively invested with expectations of reciprocity. This suggests both ending custody as soon as legitimate purposes are served and bringing the captured within the moral community while in continuing captivity...|$|R

40|$|Electronic Mail (E-Mail), {{which is}} one of the most widely used {{applications}} of Internet, has become a global communication infrastructure service. Â  However, security loopholes in it enable cybercriminals to misuse it by forging its headers or by sending it anonymously <b>for</b> <b>illegitimate</b> <b>purposes,</b> leading to e-mail forgeries. E-mail messages include transit handling envelope and trace information in the form of structured fields which are not stripped after messages are delivered, leaving a detailed record of e-mail transactions. Â  A detailed header analysis can be used to map the networks traversed by messages, including information on the messaging software and patching policies of clients and gateways, etc. Cyber forensic e-mail analysis is employed to collect credible evidence to bring criminals to justice. This paper projects the need for e-mail forensic investigation and lists various methods and tools used for its realization. A detailed header analysis of a multiple tactic spoofed e-mail message is carried out in this paper. It also discusses various possibilities for detection of spoofed headers and identification of its originator. Further, difficulties that may be faced by investigators during forensic investigation of an e-mail message have been discussed along with their possible solutions. </p...|$|E
40|$|E-mail {{has emerged}} as the most {{important}} application on Internet for communication of messages, delivery of documents and carrying out of transactions and is used not only from computers but many other electronic gadgets like mobile phones. Over a period of year’s e-mail protocols have been secured through several security extensions and producers, however, cybercriminals continue to misuse it <b>for</b> <b>illegitimate</b> <b>purposes</b> by sending spam, phishing e-mails, distributing child pornography, and hate e-mails besides propagating viruses, worms, hoaxes and Trojan horses. Further, Internet infrastructure misuse through denial of service, waste of storage space and computational resources are costing every Internet user directly or indirectly. It is thus essential to identify and eliminate users and machines misusing e-mail service. E-mail forensic analysis is used to study the source and content of e-mail message as evidence, identifying the actual sender, recipient and date and time it was sent, etc. to collect credible evidence to bring criminals to justice. This paper is an attempt to illustrate e-mail architecture from forensics perspective. It describes roles and responsibilities of different e-mail actors and components, itemizes meta-data contained in e-mail headers, and lists protocols and ports used in it. It further describes various tools and techniques currently employed to carry out forensic investigation of an e-mail message...|$|E
40|$|Upon {{acquisition}} of legal personality a company enjoys certain attributes such as limited liability. While the {{separate legal personality}} of a company enables it to enjoy rights and assume obligations quite different from its members, the limited liability of shareholders refers {{to the fact that}} the company alone is liable for its debts. However, such privilege of limited liability may not always exist when the legal personality of a company is abused and used <b>for</b> <b>illegitimate</b> or unlawful <b>purposes</b> and other reasons. This article examines some of the grounds by which the corporate veil can be pierced under Ethiopian law and the role of courts in recognizing the doctrine. Based on the analysis of the relevant legislative provisions and some court cases, it is found that Ethiopian company law, though not sufficient, provides some clear grounds of piercing the corporate veil and certain possible grounds which may call for the application of the doctrine. It is also argued that Ethiopian courts should apply the doctrine of piercing the corporate veil, through the purposive interpretation of the statutory provisions, if doing so produces equitable results and fairness...|$|R

There is no closed list; public policy determines what should be included. Usually the right to give has a corresponding duty, legal or moral or social, to receive the information. If not, {{there must be a}} corresponding interest, and the interest must be legitimate. The test is objective and guided by public policy.

40|$|Transnational {{intelligence}} {{networks have}} emerged as an essential tool for combating international terrorism and criminal activity. As with domestic intelligence-gathering, they raise a number of privacy concerns: the risk of false information, the danger that intelligence will be used <b>for</b> <b>illegitimate</b> <b>purposes,</b> and the burden placed on human dignity and individual autonomy by free-wheeling data gathering. Transnational networks, however, exacerbate these privacy problems due to the dispersed nature of government authority {{and the difficulty of}} ensuring compliance with privacy duties by each node in the network. This article illustrates the dangers of transnational intelligence sharing with the case of Maher Arar, the Canadian national who was suspected of involvement with Al Qaeda and was sent by U. S. authorities to Syria to be held captive and tortured. Although the privacy dimension of this incident are generally unappreciated, the decision to deport Arar was based on misleading information provided by the Canadian authorities via a transnational intelligence network – the free-flow-of-information agreement between Canadian and U. S. intelligence agencies. The article then turns to the multilateral privacy guarantees that have been built into another transnational intelligence network – the Europol Convention for fighting cross-border crime – and argues for their adoption in transnational networks more generally...|$|E

Canada and Norway challenged the regime under various provisions of the Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) Agreement and the GATT.
