25|$|In Luzon, the Middle Oligocene to Late Miocene {{age of the}} arc is well {{constrained}} stratigraphically as well as radiometrically. Most of the <b>intrusive</b> <b>rocks</b> are dioritic in composition, although {{alkali rocks}} also occur. In the Central Cordillera of Luzon, <b>intrusive</b> <b>rocks</b> include Paleogene rocks related to an ancient arc and Neogene intrusive and volcanic rocks related to eastward subduction from the Manila Trench.|$|E
25|$|Early Archean rocks {{generally}} form elongate, domal or circular {{bodies that}} are several kilometers thick. Late-stage dikes and sills of diabase, quartz-feldspar fine-grained instrusive rocks (aplite) and quartz-feldspar-mica coarse-grained <b>intrusive</b> <b>rocks</b> (pegmatite) are common.|$|E
25|$|Zircon is {{a common}} {{accessory}} to trace mineral constituent of most granite and felsic igneous rocks. Due to its hardness, durability and chemical inertness, zircon persists in sedimentary deposits and {{is a common}} constituent of most sands. Zircon is rare within mafic rocks and very rare within ultramafic rocks aside {{from a group of}} ultrapotassic <b>intrusive</b> <b>rocks</b> such as kimberlites, carbonatites, and lamprophyre, where zircon can occasionally be found as a trace mineral owing to the unusual magma genesis of these rocks.|$|E
50|$|This process {{requires}} a considerable degree {{of effort and}} checking of field relationships and age dates. For instance, there may be many millions of years between a bed being laid down and an <b>intrusive</b> <b>rock</b> cutting it; the estimate of age must necessarily be between the oldest cross-cutting <b>intrusive</b> <b>rock</b> in the fossil assemblage and the youngest rock upon which the fossil assemblage rests.|$|R

25|$|Clastic {{rocks are}} also {{commonly}} found in shallow subvolcanic intrusions such as porphyry stocks, granites and kimberlite pipes, where they are transitional with volcanic breccias. <b>Intrusive</b> <b>rocks</b> can become brecciated in appearance by multiple stages of intrusion, especially if fresh magma is intruded into partly consolidated or solidified magma. This {{may be seen in}} many granite intrusions where later aplite veins form a late-stage stockwork through earlier phases of the granite mass. When particularly intense, the rock may appear as a chaotic breccia.|$|E
25|$|Below 7,000m (23,000ft), the Rongbuk Formation {{underlies}} the North Col Formation and forms {{the base of}} Mount Everest. It consists of sillimanite-K-feldspar grade schist and gneiss intruded by numerous sills and dikes of leucogranite ranging in thickness from 1cm to 1,500m (0.4in to 4,900ft). These leucogranites {{are part of a}} belt of Late Oligocene–Miocene <b>intrusive</b> <b>rocks</b> known as the Higher Himalayan leucogranite. They formed as the result of partial melting of Paleoproterozoic to Ordovician high-grade metasedimentary rocks of the Higher Himalayan Sequence about 20 to 24 million years ago during the subduction of the Indian Plate.|$|E
25|$|Intrusive {{igneous rocks}} are formed from magma that cools and solidifies within the crust of a planet, {{surrounded}} by pre-existing rock (called country rock); the magma cools slowly and, as a result, these rocks are coarse-grained. The mineral grains in such rocks can generally {{be identified with}} the naked eye. <b>Intrusive</b> <b>rocks</b> can also be classified according to the shape {{and size of the}} intrusive body and its relation to the other formations into which it intrudes. Typical intrusive formations are batholiths, stocks, laccoliths, sills and dikes. When the magma solidifies within the earth's crust, it cools slowly forming coarse textured rocks, such as granite, gabbro, or diorite.|$|E

50|$|Geochronology on the Manfred Complex places its age {{at around}} 3.73 billion via Pb-Pb on zircon. This {{makes it the}} oldest {{recognised}} <b>intrusive</b> <b>rock</b> on the Earth, containing the oldest known igneous textures and mineral assemblages.|$|R
25|$|Most of the {{mountains}} and canyons, as {{in other parts of}} the Sierra Nevada, are formed in igneous <b>intrusive</b> <b>rocks</b> such as granite, diorite and monzonite, formed at least 100 million years ago due to subduction along the North American–Pacific Plate boundary. However, the Sierra itself is a young mountain range, no more than 10 million years old. Huge tectonic forces along the western edge of the Great Basin forced the local crustal block to tilt and uplift, creating {{the mountains}}' gradual slope to the west and the nearly vertical escarpment to the east bordering the Owens Valley. Many cave systems are also formed in the rock layers, including Boyden Cave along the South Fork of the Kings River.|$|E
25|$|The {{rocks of}} the Klamath Mountains {{originated}} as island arcs and continental fragments in the Pacific Ocean. The island masses consisted of rifted fragments of pre-existing continents and volcanic island masses created over subduction zones. These island masses contain rocks {{as old as}} 500million years, dating to the early Paleozoic Era. A succession of eight island terranes moved eastward on the ancient Farallon plate and collided with the North American plate between 260 and about 130million years ago. Each accretion left a terrane of rock of a single age. During the accretion, subduction of the plate metamorphosed the overlying rock and produced magma which intruded the overlying rock as plutons. Serpentinite, produced by the metamorphism of basaltic oceanic rocks, and <b>intrusive</b> <b>rocks</b> of gabbroic to granodiorite composition are common rocks within the Klamath terranes.|$|E
25|$|All {{of these}} {{processes}} do not necessarily occur in a single environment, {{and do not necessarily}} occur in a single order. The Hawaiian Islands, for example, consist almost entirely of layered basaltic lava flows. The sedimentary sequences of the mid-continental United States and the Grand Canyon in the southwestern United States contain almost-undeformed stacks of sedimentary rocks that have remained in place since Cambrian time. Other areas are much more geologically complex. In the southwestern United States, sedimentary, volcanic, and <b>intrusive</b> <b>rocks</b> have been metamorphosed, faulted, foliated, and folded. Even older rocks, such as the Acasta gneiss of the Slave craton in northwestern Canada, the oldest known rock in the world have been metamorphosed to the point where their origin is undiscernable without laboratory analysis. In addition, these processes can occur in stages. In many places, the Grand Canyon in the southwestern United States being a very visible example, the lower rock units were metamorphosed and deformed, and then deformation ended and the upper, undeformed units were deposited. Although any amount of rock emplacement and rock deformation can occur, and they can occur any number of times, these concepts provide a guide to understanding the geological history of an area.|$|E

50|$|The archaic term epidiorite is {{sometimes}} {{used to refer}} to a metamorphosed ortho-amphibolite with a protolith of diorite, gabbro or other mafic <b>intrusive</b> <b>rock.</b> In epidiorite the original clinopyroxene (most often augite) has been replaced by the fibrous amphibole uralite.|$|R
50|$|The term Intrusive suite seems near {{synonymous with}} <b>{{intrusive}}</b> <b>rock.</b> There is, however, a modest difference: An intrusive suite {{is a group}} of plutons related in time and space. Plus, all <b>rocks</b> in an <b>intrusive</b> suite result from the same magma-producing event.|$|R
25|$|One of {{the major}} aspects that changed early during the Coast Range Arc was {{the status of the}} {{northern}} end of the Farallon Plate, a portion now known as the Kula Plate. About 85million years ago, the Kula Plate broke off from the Farallon Plate to form an area of seafloor spreading called the Kula-Farallon Ridge. This change apparently had some important ramifications for regional geologic evolution. When this change was completed, Coast Range Arc volcanism returned and sections of the arc were uplifted considerably in latest Cretaceous time. This started a period of mountain building that affected much of western North America called the Laramide orogeny. In particular a large area of dextral transpression and southwest-directed thrust faulting was active from 75to 66million years ago. Much of the record of this deformation has been overridden by Tertiary age structures and the zone of Cretaceous dextral thrust faulting appears to have been widespread. It was also during this period when massive amounts of molten granite intruded highly deformed ocean rocks and assorted fragments from pre-existing island arcs, largely remnants of the Bridge River Ocean. This molten granite burned the old oceanic sediments into a glittering medium-grade metamorphic rock called schist. The older intrusions of the Coast Range Arc were then deformed under the heat and pressure of later intrusions, turning them into layered metamorphic rock known as gneiss. In some places, mixtures of older <b>intrusive</b> <b>rocks</b> and the original oceanic rocks have been distorted and warped under intense heat, weight and stress to create unusual swirled patters known as migmatite, appearing to have been nearly melted in the procedure.|$|E
500|$|Niobium is {{estimated}} to be the 34th most common element in the Earth’s crust, with 20ppm. Some think that the abundance on Earth is much greater, and that the element's high density has concentrated it in the Earth’s core. The free element is not found in nature, but niobium occurs in combination with other elements in minerals. Minerals that contain niobium often also contain tantalum. [...] Examples include columbite ((Fe,Mn)(Nb,Ta)2O6) and columbite–tantalite (or coltan, (Fe,Mn)(Ta,Nb)2O6). Columbite–tantalite minerals are most usually found as accessory minerals in pegmatite intrusions, and in alkaline <b>intrusive</b> <b>rocks.</b> Less common are the niobates of calcium, uranium, thorium and the rare earth elements. [...] Examples of such niobates are pyrochlore ((Na,Ca)2Nb2O6(OH,F)) and euxenite ((Y,Ca,Ce,U,Th)(Nb,Ta,Ti)2O6). These large deposits of niobium have been found associated with carbonatites (carbonate-silicate igneous rocks) and as a constituent of pyrochlore.|$|E
