50|$|Bad {{contacts}} are {{the cause}} of failure or poor performance {{in a wide variety}} of electrical devices. For example, corroded <b>jumper</b> <b>cable</b> <b>clamps</b> can frustrate attempts to start a vehicle that has a low battery. Dirty or corroded contacts on a fuse or its holder can give the false impression that the fuse is blown. A sufficiently high contact resistance can cause substantial heating in a high current device. Unpredictable or noisy contacts are a major cause of the failure of electrical equipment.|$|R

50|$|Furthermore, {{the most}} of the {{available}} <b>cable</b> <b>clamps</b> are not very flexible when it comes to routing lines with varying diameters. That causes higher acquisition and storage costs. The installation of the single <b>cable</b> <b>clamps</b> can take a lot of mounting time, depending on the laying length of the lines. Strain relief plates are therefore a more flexible solution which allows a parallel routing of several lines with varying diameters.|$|R

5000|$|Meanwhile, as Alex's father, Ted Bell, {{is on his}} way to the airport, {{he stops}} by [...] "The Bone Yard" [...] to check on some business. A stranger—Charlie Rotter, the {{perpetrator}} of the Roller-Dome massacre and Skye's father—asks to borrow his <b>jumper</b> <b>cables</b> to fix his truck, and when Ted happily obliges, Rotter stabs him in the back and strangles him to death with a <b>jumper</b> <b>cable</b> in the trunk of his Acadia. Back in Skye's hometown, her friend Derek meets a girl named Courtney at school and they begin to date. The two are about to make out when Brigg enters the room to tell Derek that Skye finally messaged him back. Courtney shows disdain towards Skye, calling her [...] "Psycho-Rotter". Derek and Brigg find out that Skye is now hiding out in a nearby neighborhood, and they agree to go find her in the morning, with Courtney tagging along.|$|R

5000|$|The {{vertical}} blocks {{are used}} to terminate the permanent outside lines entering the station. Horizontal blocks {{are used to}} terminate inside plant equipment. This arrangement permits the association of any outside line with any desired terminal equipment. These connections are made either with twisted pair wire, normally referred to as jumper wire, or with optical fiber cables, normally referred to as <b>jumper</b> <b>cables.</b>|$|R
50|$|On April 11, 2001, Branson Perry {{was last}} seen in {{his home in the}} 300 block of West Oak Street in Skidmore at around 3:00 p.m. He went outside to put some <b>jumper</b> <b>cables</b> in a shed. He never {{returned}} and has never been heard from again. The Missouri State Highway Patrol and the Nodaway County Sheriff's Department still have an open/active case on this.|$|R
50|$|Large {{versions}} of these clips, called automotive clips or battery clamps, {{are made of}} solid copper for low electrical resistance, and are used with thick insulated copper cables to make connections between automobile batteries. These <b>jumper</b> <b>cables</b> are capable of delivering hundreds of Amperes of current needed to directly power an automobile starter motor, or to transfer energy from a charged lead-acid battery to a discharged one.|$|R
50|$|The {{electrical}} control system required control cables throughout {{the length of}} the train (in addition to the two air pipes for Westinghouse operation) and a <b>jumper</b> <b>cable</b> was provided at each end of every unit for use when two or more units were coupled to run in multiple. In 1950, no electronic control was possible and the system used four conductors in the cable to achieve graduated braking rates.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} coped well in service, {{and from}} 1942 it became standard practice to run three locomotives together {{with only two}} pantographs up, and have their pantographs linked by <b>jumper</b> <b>cables.</b> This was deemed dangerous however, and soon each locomotive ran with its own pantograph up. This often resulted in heavy sparking. Once it became normal to run three locomotives together, they were altered in 1940 to a single cab design.|$|R
50|$|A more cable-friendly {{alternative}} is attaching the lines to special strain relief plates using common cable ties. In case of industrial applications these strain relief plates are as well cost-effective because {{the packing density}} (meaning the possible number of lines to be fixed on one plate) {{is much higher than}} with common <b>cable</b> <b>clamps</b> which are normally designed for holding one single line.|$|R
50|$|With {{a strain}} relief component, the {{connection}} between a flexible electrical line and its connection port is protected against mechanical stress. Usually, the lines are fixed by clamping them into single <b>cable</b> <b>clamps</b> made of plastic or metal. Another possibility is to use so called cord grips which consist of weaved wire strands that put a grip around the cables.|$|R
50|$|During 2015, the Class 15E fleet {{began to}} be {{equipped}} with new multiple unit (MU) hardware and train control and monitoring system (TCMS) software. Modified locomotives carried temporary plaques on their front doors {{to indicate that the}} modification had been carried out and to warn train crews that the locomotive may not be connected to an unmodified locomotive by multiple unit <b>jumper</b> <b>cable.</b> Modified locomotives could only be used with unmodified locomotives through the radio distributed power system.|$|R
5000|$|A jump wire (also {{known as}} jumper, <b>jumper</b> wire, <b>jumper</b> <b>cable,</b> DuPont wire, or DuPont cable - named for one {{manufacturer}} of them) is an electrical wire {{or group of}} them in a cable with a connector or pin at each end (or sometimes without them - simply [...] "tinned"), which is normally used to interconnect the components of a breadboard or other prototype or test circuit, internally or with other equipment or components, without soldering.|$|R
