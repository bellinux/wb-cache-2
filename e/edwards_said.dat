He referred it to as an [...] "aforementioned mega-song". Similarly, Jason Shawahn from About.com noted it as [...] "a blessing for domestic music consumers". AllMusic's Chris True favored [...] "On a Night Like This" [...] as one of the better cuts on the parent album, and selected the track as some of Minogue's best work. Nick Levine from Digital Spy called it a [...] "catchy" [...] number, and pointed it out as a highlight from the record. While likening the recording to the track [...] "Groovejet" [...] by Spiller and Sophie Ellis-Bextor, a reviewer from British tabloid NME felt the comparison [...] "works because it doesn't revolve awkwardly round a random disco beat".|$|E

Although the title itself proclaims such a direction, for me the book becomes lost in anecdotal information and details of military strategy without a critical and persuasive understanding of orientalism. Porter’s definition of orientalism arrives through several caveats, which he proposes as counters to <b>Edwards</b> <b>Said’s</b> decisive work on the subject. Porter argues that cultures at war contain rival and clashing narratives, ‘an ambiguous repertoire of competing ideas that can be selected, instrumentalised, and manipulated...|$|R

500|$|After the {{destruction}} of the first bridge over the fast-flowing River Taff, Edwards designed a more radical [...] single-arch bridge that would eliminate the possibility of debris destroying the bridge due to the flooding of the River Taff. The second bridge was built from 1748, however two reports differ as to what actually happened during this second attempt. Thomas Morgan, a contemporary of <b>Edwards,</b> <b>said</b> that [...] "…when he (Edwards) had almost finished the arch, the centre timber work gave way and all fell to the bottom." [...] However, The National Library of Wales has a contemporary work known as the Plasybrain manuscript which says, [...] "Just after the first single arch was finished and before the centre was struck, a flood came and carried all away." [...] It is not clear which account is accurate, however it is clear that Edwards' latest attempt to build a bridge across the River Taff had failed.|$|E
500|$|Author Jerome Corsi {{was interviewed}} in July 2008.

Corsi scheduled another promotional appearance on The Political Cesspool, but one month later he canceled this appearance, citing [...] "travel plans that changed". <b>Edwards</b> <b>said</b> that he believed the incident [...] "just goes to show what incredible pressure everyone in public life is under to never {{have anything to do with}} anyone who speaks up for the interests of white people." [...] Fellow authors John Derbyshire and Steve Sailer have also been guests. In July 2011, WorldNetDaily columnist Ilana Mercer appeared on the show.|$|E
500|$|Roush Fenway Racing {{president}} Geoff Smith said a bolt {{that held}} the oil lid together did not work because of vibration harmonics generated by Edwards' car and the Las Vegas race track. <b>Edwards</b> <b>said</b> the infraction was [...] "an absolute mistake" [...] and that his team {{had no intention of}} cheating. Edwards' teammate Biffle and Newman agreed the penalties were justified. According to Sadler, the penalties were not severe enough; he argued that the driver should be penalized or required to miss one event. Toyota Racing Development General Manager Lee White said Roush Fenway Racing had modified Edwards' car to enhance downforce by , which increased the car's horsepower leaving the corners. Roush felt White's comments were motivated by results. White later issued a statement in which he apologized for his comments. An internal investigation found no evidence that another person had intentionally caused the bolt to come loose, and that the team enacted protective measures to ensure the oil lid would stay fastened in future events.|$|E

500|$|Boon {{said that}} there was a focus on {{including}} characters from the first three Mortal Kombat games and that [...] "if you have a favorite character from those games, you're probably going to see him or her in the game." [...] The game's developers stated that the characters had been designed with the intent to make each character unique – each having his or her own individual stance, victory pose and Fatality with no shared animations. Lead designer John <b>Edwards</b> <b>said</b> that characters are differentiated by features such as power and speed. Producer Shaun Himmerick said that the internal and external character design required [...] "two months or ten weeks". Boon said that an exclusive character was planned for the Xbox 360 version, but [...] "unfortunately, the circumstances didn't allow us to make a 360 exclusive." [...] Ed Boon mentioned that Marcus Fenix of the Gears of War franchise was considered for the Xbox 360 version as the console guest fighter. He also said they were in talks to include Sweet Tooth from Sony's Twisted Metal franchise.|$|E
500|$|In 1886, Edwards {{was interviewed}} for The Theatre, a weekly {{magazine}} published in New York. Edwards {{was described as}} [...] "unusually popular and genial", with a [...] "charming English" [...] wife and a Chinese servant named Charlie who [...] "adores his employers" [...] and had served them for 17 years. The Edwards' home was observed to be comfortable but decorated with an astonishing collection of wonders from around the globe. Displayed amid the biological specimens, rugs, china, furniture, and valuable photographs were paintings executed by other actors, including ones by Edward Askew Sothern and Joseph Jefferson. Edwards showed letters he had received from {{a wide array of}} notables such as writers William Makepeace Thackeray, Charles Dickens, Anthony Trollope and naturalists Charles Darwin, Louis Agassiz and John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury. One floor of the residence was seen to be wholly devoted to the entomologist's collection of specimens, which <b>Edwards</b> <b>said</b> was insured for $17,000, $ in current value. Surrounded by his exotic possessions and [...] "in the most perfect congeniality with his wife", Edwards was reported to be the host of a [...] "cultivated home".|$|E

[...] At the end of the interview, James <b>Edwards</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Mr. Buchanan, {{thank you so much for}} coming back on our program, for fighting for our people." [...] Previously, in September 2006, Buchanan had made an appearance to promote his book State of Emergency; during this interview, he said that [...] "we are being invaded by people of different cultures" [...] and argued that Americans [...] "cannot survive a bifurcated culture or a heavily Hispanicized culture, tilted towards Mexico...

500|$|Most reviewers {{criticized the}} quality of its cameras, {{particularly}} due to their resolution in comparison to contemporaneous mobile phones. They considered them sufficient for the DSi's screens, however. Harris and Lowe believed that the camera's only use was to take [...] "silly pictures of yourself and others". They complained about the difficulty of taking photographs in low-light environments, and said that low-light images were tinged green or blue. Opinions on the DSi's photograph-editing tools were varied: Bit-techs Martin and Reid considered them to be a gimmick, but Bakalar and Cliff Edwards of BusinessWeek thought otherwise. <b>Edwards</b> <b>said</b> that the camera's use in gameplay was a new opportunity for developers; Martin did not think that the concept would be widely adopted, as he believed it to be [...] "a gimmick that would alienate [...] DS Lite owners". Eurogamer's Tom Bramwell speculated that the DSi follows Game & Watch and Game Boy creator Gunpei Yokoi's philosophy of using dated technology developers are familiar with to introduce new game design concepts that are inexpensive enough for mass production at a profit. He argued its features are designed to [...] "briefly entertain" [...] early adopters while encouraging [...] "developers to consider it as an alternative [...] " [...] to build an attractive game library for the long term.|$|E
500|$|As the {{producers}} gained greater {{confidence in the}} film however, larger name actors were brought in. Patrick Warburton was the first celebrity actor to join the film and did so purely out of a love for the script. Though Cory Edwards had originally envisioned the Wolf as sounding like a mixture between a young Chevy Chase and Bill Murray, he praised Warburton's performance, saying that he [...] "made the Wolf his own character." [...] Andy Dick also joined the cast early on, to voice Boingo. He used improvisation and approached the role differently from how it had been written, interpreting the character as victimized and unstable. The filmmakers were enthusiastic over Dick's angle on the character, and Todd <b>Edwards</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "What we had written was kind of stock, to be honest, but Andy Dick, well, where {{he was supposed to}} laugh, he'd be crying. Where he was supposed to yell, he'd be laughing. He just mixed it up!" [...] Prolific voice performers Tara Strong, David Ogden Stiers, and Tom Kenny were cast in multiple roles. Strong was cast as Red and Zorra, Stiers was cast as Kirk, the Woodsman and Nicky Flippers, and Kenny was cast as Tommy and Woolworth the Sheep. Emmy-winning actress Sally Struthers was brought in to play Granny Puckett and Joel McCrary was cast as Chief Grizzly.|$|E
