5000|$|No. 11. 127 North Calumet Road, 1902, Hess Restaurant and Hotel {{used this}} {{building}} from 1902 until 1920. From 1920 until recent years, Johnson Grocery Store occupied the building. Anton Insurance Company now utilizes this {{building and the}} neighboring block at 129 Calumet. 127 is a two-story, three bay commercial block. The first story shop front was remodeled in c.1950. The front is angled inward in a single plane, with two shop windows {{to the south and}} a double entry to the north. The <b>kick</b> <b>panel</b> area is brick and the doors and windows are framed in brushed natural metal (likely aluminum). The second floor has three windows with stone sills and lintels. The cornice has false machicolations and corbeled brick courses.|$|E
5000|$|No. 6. 137B North Calumet Road, c. 1905, This small story {{shop was}} home to a barber shop until the 1960s. The wooden {{storefront}} seems to be original, with recessed <b>kick</b> <b>panels</b> below a large wood framed window, and the recessed entrance set to the north with single light wood door. The metal awning is from the 1950s. The face brick walls have two double recessed panels on the parapet and a stone coping.|$|R
50|$|Presented to {{the public}} at the 2001 Geneva Motor Show, the 3200 GT Assetto Corsa was a limited edition, run-out version of the GT with a special {{handling}} package. Limited to 259 units of which 3 were special orders, it was available in three standard colours: Grigio Touring, Grigio Alfieri and Rosso Mondiale; and available with manual or automatic transmission. Assetto Corsa was lowered by 15 mm, had larger front anti-roll bar, stiffer springs, soft compound Pirelli PZero Corsa tyres on dark grey or silver painted BBS alloy wheels, and specific brake ventilation ducts. Interior featured perforated Connolly leather seats and 'Assetto Corsa' script on the sill <b>kick</b> <b>panels.</b> Both kerb weight and performance were unchanged from the GT.|$|R
50|$|On 17 August, Fifita was {{involved}} in a road rage incident at Taren Point where he allegedly threw an object at a car travelling behind him and later after the pair pulled over, Fifita allegedly got out of his Jeep and verbally abused the 23-year-old male driver of the Subaru before punching and <b>kicking</b> the <b>panels</b> of his car.|$|R
50|$|Perhaps {{the most}} notable feature {{in the house is}} a wooden {{partition}} that can be removed (by taking out the baseboard and <b>kicking</b> the <b>panels</b> out on dowels) to join the drawing room and the central hall into a 20 x 30 foot room for great occasions. The partition is fully paneled on both sides, both above and below the chair rail. Complete with a 10-pane casement window {{on either side of the}} partition door, the design is extraordinary.|$|R
5000|$|No. 7. 135 North Calumet Road, c.1900, The Hoham Block is two {{buildings}} {{to the north}} and is also a c.1905 Twentieth Century Functional style. The Hoham Block is a two-story brick and stone commercial building. In 1903, Bennett Morgan constructed this building as a hardware store. He and his son Robert operated the store until Bennett died in 1974. The double recessed entrance storefront seems to have some original features and others dating from perhaps the 1930s. The iron corner piers are original, the doorways appear to be original, but the metal framing and edging for the shop windows seems to be a Moderne style replacement. The upper floor face brick walls have two bays, one wood double hung window with stone sill and lintel, and an oriel window. The semihexagonal bay has pressed metal <b>kick</b> <b>panels</b> and entablature, both have Classical swag and floral motifs. A stone tablet with raised letters spelling [...] "HOHAM BLOCK" [...] is centered over the window and oriel. The cornice has a lower sawtooth course of brick, a run of alternately recessed brick, fake machicolations, and a three course corbel table with stone coping. The sides of the building always stood above its neighbors and have several operable windows. Country Loft Crafts occupies this store currently.|$|R
50|$|When {{they were}} gone, Gibbs managed to <b>kick</b> the door <b>panel</b> {{out with her}} heavy, platform-heeled leather boots and escape with the {{children}} in the dark, finding help a few kilometres away. Eastwood and Boland were captured by heavily armed Victoria Police officers after an extensive manhunt.|$|R
6000|$|... "You see we're busy {{waiting for}} you, Master," [...] said old Robert. [...] "You're late this evening. Keep {{any of the}} youngsters in? That's a foolish way of {{punishing}} them, as hard on yourself as on them. One teacher we had four years ago used to lock them in and go home. Then he'd go back {{in an hour and}} let them out--if they were there. They weren't always. Tom Ferguson <b>kicked</b> the <b>panels</b> out of the old door once and got out that way. We put a new door of double plank in that they couldn't kick out." ...|$|R
5000|$|No. 3. 193 North Calumet Road, c.1905, The Chesterton Tribune Building is {{the most}} {{southern}} building and was built c. 1905 after the great fire of 1902. It is considered a Twentieth Century function style, similar {{to most of the}} buildings in the district. The Chesterton Tribune commissioned construction of this building in 1904 and it continues to serve as the paper's headquarters. Arthur Bowser first published the paper in 1884 * and he owned the paper when {{the decision was made to}} build this structure. It is a two-story brick commercial building. The ground floor storefront has been altered; stucco covers the <b>kick</b> <b>panels</b> and piers. An old-fashioned style simple cloth awning covers the storefront. The original steel or iron I-beam spanning the ground floor remains intact along with the decorative rosettes. The red brick walls rise above the I-beam and three windows puncture the wall, each with dressed stone sills and lintels. Centered over the windows, a stone tablet reads [...] "The Chesterton Tribune". The elaborate parapet gives the building a slight Romanesque Revival style flavor. First, a beltcourse of sawtooth-laid brick runs across, then a frieze of alternating recessed single bricks. The raised brick corbels dividing the upper parapet into four panels mimic machicolations, with infilling of progressively corbeled courses of brick. J.G. Graessle bought the paper from Bowser in 1923, Warren Canright purchased it in 1928, and held the paper until his death in 1975. His son Warren and grandson David continue to publish the Tribune out of the building. The Tribune is the oldest existing business in Chesterton, and still publishes daily except for Sundays., ...|$|R
60|$|Then, as in reaction, {{the gallery}} trembled {{with a roar}} of laughter. But Mr. Sutton did not smile. The clerk {{scratched}} off the names with lightning rapidity, scarce waiting for the answers. Every man's color was known, and it was against the rules to be present and fail to vote. The noise in the corridors grew louder, some one dealt a smashing <b>kick</b> on a <b>panel,</b> and Wetherell ventured to ask Mr. Bixby if he thought the doors would hold.|$|R
60|$|Pretty soon {{afterwards}} {{they came}} to a low door, where the Sultana whistled three times and <b>kicked</b> at the <b>panels.</b> It soon yielded, disclosing two gigantic Nubian eunuchs, black as the ace of clubs, who stared at first, but when shown a very cleverly-executed signet-ring of paste, knocked their heads against the ground with respectful violence. Then one of them consulted a thick book, and took from a secret drawer two metal badges numbered 7,394 and 7,395, which he fastened about the necks of the now frightened girls, who had just observed that the Sultana had vanished. The numbers on the badges showed {{that this would be a}} very crowded ball.|$|R
60|$|At last, the {{orchestra}} left off, and the curtain rose upon the new piece. The first scene, {{in which there}} was nobody particular, passed off calmly enough, but when Miss Snevellicci went on in the second, accompanied by the phenomenon as child, what a roar of applause broke out! The people in the Borum box rose as one man, waving their hats and handkerchiefs, and uttering shouts of 'Bravo!' Mrs Borum and the governess cast wreaths upon the stage, of which, some fluttered into the lamps, and one crowned the temples of a fat gentleman in the pit, who, looking eagerly towards the scene, remained unconscious of the honour; the tailor and his family <b>kicked</b> at the <b>panels</b> of the upper boxes till they threatened to come out altogether; the very ginger-beer boy remained transfixed in the centre of the house; a young officer, supposed to entertain a passion for Miss Snevellicci, stuck his glass in his eye as though to hide a tear. Again and again Miss Snevellicci curtseyed lower and lower, and again and again the applause came down, louder and louder. At length, when the phenomenon {{picked up one of the}} smoking wreaths and put it on, sideways, over Miss Snevellicci's eye, it reached its climax, and the play proceeded.|$|R
40|$|A virtual {{organization}} uses IT to function like a traditional one. A {{number of articles}} in the popular press have espoused the virtue of the “virtual office ” or “virtual corporation. ” According to Apgar (1993), “the changing nature of work is challenging deeply held beliefs about the workplace (where facilities are located) and the workspace (individual areas that people occupy). ” Proponents for the virtual office or virtual corporation suggest that organizations can realize significant savings while increasing the output or productivity of the firm. Others {{have pointed out that}} the managerial and personal implications of the {{virtual organization}} may require us to rethink what we mean by an organization (Lucas and Baroudi 1994; Handy 1995). The objective of this panel is to discuss {{what it means to be}} a virtual organization from an organization design theory point of view and suggest further avenues of research related to the virtual organization concept. This will be accomplished through presentation and discussion. The panel format will be as follows. Hank Lucas will <b>kick</b> off the <b>panel</b> by reviewing the literature that has influenced our thinking regarding information technology, organization design and the virtual organization. Following the literature overview, Lucas will highligh...|$|R
