5000|$|Triumph Actuation Systems - Connecticut (TAS-CT) {{specializes in}} the development, design, {{manufacture}} and test of {{a wide array of}} aerospace products, notably manufacturing parts up to 20 in in diameter that typically require both milling and turning, typically in high strength nickel and titanium based alloys primarily used in turbine engine applications. [...] With numerous CNC turning centers, 4-axis CNC milling centers, CNC grinding capabilities, 3-axis CNC vertical milling centers, grinding, wire EDM, lapping and honing capabilities, the facility can manufacture and design shimmy dampers, nose wheel steering systems, flight control servo actuators, landing gear systems, hydraulic valves, lag dampers, telescoping, fixed length and folding <b>hold</b> <b>open</b> <b>rods</b> and struts, mechanical latches and keepers, hydro-mechanical uplocks, hydro-mechanical actuation systems, turbine engine components, electro-mechanical and mechanical actuation systems as well as structural landing gear systems and components used throughout military and commercial industries. The company currently has its operations distributed between Bethel, Bloomfield and East Lyme, Connecticut. They claim their in-house grinding capability permits tolerances to be held within +/- 0.0001 in.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We combine {{and extend}} the work of Alexander & Antman [3] and Fuller [11, 12] to give a {{framework}} within which precise definitions can be given of topological and geometrical quantities characterising the contortion of <b>open</b> <b>rods</b> undergoing large deformations under end loading. We use these definitions to examine the extension of known results for closed <b>rods</b> to <b>open</b> <b>rods.</b> In particular, we formulate the analogue of the celebrated formula Lk = Tw + Wr (link equals twist plus writhe) for <b>open</b> <b>rods</b> and propose an end rotation, through which the applied end moment does work, {{in the form of}} an integral over the length of the rod. The results serve to promote the variational analysis of boundary-value problems for rods undergoing large deformations...|$|R
