40|$|Sylt is {{a barrier}} island at the German-Danish {{border in the}} SE North Sea. It {{consists}} of a core of Miocene to Pliocene marine and riverine sediments in the central part which forms the source sediment for two spit systems that extend more than 15 km {{to the south and}} the north. These protect the backside tidal basins and the mainland against the direct influence of the North Sea. Presently, Sylt is strongly eroded (about 1 m land loss per year at its west coast). Goal of the investigations presented here is to reconstruct the Holocene geological history of the area and to provide data instrumental to build up a scenario for the future development of the area in the light of climate change and sea-level rise. We use the sea-floor classification system RoxAnn to characterize the present state of the sublitoral sedimentary environments, and a parametric echosounder as well as sparker/boomer shallow seismics to reconstruct the Holocene development of the sedimentary environments offshore. Onshore, ground-penetrating radar (GPR), long sediment cores, and surface samples are used to reconstruct the transition from marine to terrestrial environments. West of Sylt and Rømø Sparker data reveal an upper unit with north-directed foreset structures overlying more horizontally bedded sediments. The foreset structures are likely related to the List Deep tidal delta situated between Sylt and Rømø. Under the immediate influence of the recent tidal currents large sandwaves (crest <b>hight</b> <b>up</b> to 7 m) locally occur on the seafloor. Onshore, GPR data reveal alternating processes of swash-bar accretion and severe-storm erosion at the west coast and longshore sediment transport with beach-ridge accretion at the north-facing part of the northern spit. Sediment core granulometric data show the transition from marine via beaches to dune environments. AMS radiocarbon age determinations allow to reconstruct the growth of the spit system whose youngest recurved part became permanently terrestrial about 1000 years ago. Acoustic and sedimentologic data from the recent seafloor west of the coastline show extended alternating zones of coarser and finer sediments that stretch perpendicular to the coastline. Depressions within the otherwise sandy area are being filled with muddy sediments. We will show how the different marine and terrestrial depositional environments are linked to each other and how sediment transport is likely governed. It becomes clear that Sylt is not the result of a retreating coastline as there is clear evidence for periods of extended seaward island growth during the late Holocene. Erosive and accumulative phases of the island appear {{to be the result of}} atmospheric forcing and the fluctuating sea level which suggests implications with regard to the future development of this and similar areas...|$|E

40|$|Long {{lengths of}} multifilamentary Nb Ti composites, which {{comprise}} several thousands. 5 to 1 micron-diameter filaments, have been manufactured. These composites, with a Cu-Cu Ni mixed-matrix {{and some of}} them with pure Cu Ni between the filaments, carry <b>hight</b> current densities <b>up</b> to 1. 95 105 A/cm 2 at 5 Teslas. Their structure provides a good magnetic stability and leads to strongly reduced 50 Hertz losses. These results allow to consider alternators with superconducting rotor and armature windings and, in a general way, they open very new prospects for industrial applications of superconductivity in fast pulsed magnets and in A. C. current devices...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this work}} was to work up the survey about usage and {{fertility}} of stallions using in Czech warmblood breeding. All data originate from breeding evidence of Czech warmblood Breeders Association, Association of Horse Breeder´s Unions of the Czech Republic and Czech Equestrian Federation (years 2002 { [...] } 2008). It has been evaluated frequency of stallion using in each period, the numbers of fertilized mares and the numbers of foals borning after each stallions. Frequency of using the stallions was compared with achieved level their sports performance. The results of the numbers of borning foals in each years were in interval 917 { [...] } 1360 and gradually falls. In average 6 foals were born to one stallion. Natality was in interval 32, 3 % - 74, 4 %, 11 fertilized mares to one stallion in average. From 13 to 21 % stallions used in breeding have no offspring. It was made out that the using of stallions with <b>hight</b> performance grow <b>up</b> from 11, 4 % to 21, 1 % by sports performance T and from 3 % to 7, 1 % by sports performance TT. Detected rates from the analysis of stallions usage in breeding Leeds to conclusion, {{that the number of}} present stallions should be lower, but the frequency of usage should be higher...|$|R
