AimsTo assess handling and imaging quality of a new release of a micro-TOE probe in children. MethodsThirty-eight consecutive children, enrolled during February and May 2013, underwent TOE with the Philips S 8 - 3 t probe. Insertion, handling and image quality were assessed. ResultsThe 38 children (aged 7 days to 12 years; weight 3. 1 – 27 kg) underwent 75  TOE (30 [40. 0 %] before cardiac surgery, 31 [41. 3 %] after cardiac surgery, 4 [5. 3 %] during a percutaneous procedure, 10 [13. 3 %] {{in the intensive care}} unit). Insertion of the micro-TOE probe was ‘very easy’ in 37 / 38 patients (97. 4 %). Handling was better in the lightest children (P= 0. 001). Image quality was mainly ‘good’ or ‘very good’, with no significant changes between preoperative and postoperative examinations or over time. Total scores (insertion, handling, image quality) were significantly better in the lightest children (P= 0. 02). Preoperative TOE did not provide additional information over transthoracic echocardiography. Postoperative TOE was useful to assess surgical results, but no residual lesions required extracorporeal circulation return. Micro-TOE was useful during the postoperative care of neonatal surgery with open breastbone to assess the surgical result and ventricular function. It was also useful to guide extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) indication and withdrawal; and was a useful <b>guide</b> <b>for</b> percutaneous <b>procedures.</b> ConclusionMicro-multiplane TOE is safe and efficient for use in neonates and children.

Case report: We report {{a case of a}} 71 years old man, who was admitted to our observation with a duodenal ulceration that reveled being a duodenal adenocarcinoma. Discussion: These lesions are characteried by a vague symptomatology like weight loss, abdominal pain, jaundice and anemia. The diagnosys is often delayed because of these nonspecific clinical signs. The most frequent location is the second portion of the duodenum. Curative surgery is the gold standard of treatment with an improving survival.

These procedures eliminate the need for a cardiopulminary bypass and its well documented adverse effects. However, challenges remain before clinical implementation of ultrasound-guided intracardiac surgery can be made practical. 3 D ultrasound provides limited spatial perception due to distorted appearance of tissue and instruments. The low quality imaging when combined with the confined dynamic environment of a beating heart makes complex tasks difficult for surgeons to perform. These challenges are addressed by improving the display of 3 D ultrasound with stereo displays, tracked surgical instruments, and introducing robotics for handling the dynamic cardiac tissue.
