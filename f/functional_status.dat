40|$|AbstractObjectiveThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} the clinical efficacy of acupuncture in combination with RehaCom cognitive training in poststroke patients with cognitive dysfunction. Methods/DesignThis study was a 2  ×  2 factorial design randomized controlled trial comparing acupuncture, computer-assisted cognitive rehabilitation, and the usual treatment by per-protocol analysis. The trial was completed by 204 stroke patients, including 49 patients in a control group, 52 patients in an acupuncture treatment group, 51 patients in a RehaCom training group, and 52 patients in an acupuncture combined with RehaCom group. All of the patients accepted basic treatment and health education. The interventions continued for 12  weeks (30  minutes per day, 5  days per week). The relative cognitive and functional outcomes were measured at baseline and 12  weeks (at the end of intervention) using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and Functional Independence Measure (FIM) scales. ResultsAfter 12  weeks of treatment, the <b>functional</b> <b>statuses</b> of the patients in each of the 4 groups showed varying degrees of improvement. Multiple comparisons of the changes in the MMSE, MoCA, and FIM scores indicated that acupuncture combined with RehaCom cognitive training (ACR) had enhanced therapeutic effects on the <b>functional</b> <b>statuses</b> of the stroke patients (P < . 05). In addition, ACR had similar therapeutic effects on the <b>functional</b> <b>statuses</b> of the stroke patients according to each of the assessment scales applied (P△change value MMSE =  0. 399, P△MoCA =  0. 794, P△FIM =  0. 862). The interaction effect values between acupuncture and RehaCom training (acceptance or nonacceptance) were as follows: △MMSE: F =  6. 251, P = . 013; △MoCA: F =  4. 991, P = . 027; and △FIM: F =  6. 317, P = . 013. Further, the main effect values for acupuncture and RehaCom training were both significant (P < . 05). ConclusionsThere is an interaction effect in the treatment of stroke patients using ACR. The use of acupuncture in combination with RehaCom training has better therapeutic effects on the <b>functional</b> <b>statuses</b> of poststroke patients than the use of either treatment alone, demonstrating the clinical significance of this combination therapy...|$|R
40|$|Background: Knowing the {{magnitude}} of a problem {{is the first step}} to improving it, and quantifying the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) allows us to do it with respect to stroke. To identify the HRQOL in patients with ischemic stroke and its affecting factors, and compare it with other clinical and functional scales. Methods: A consecutive series of patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) or transient ischemic attack (TIA) was recruited. Their HRQOL and utilities were assessed using the EQ- 5 Dindex－which evaluates the health profile of an individual in five dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activity, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) and three levels (no problem, some/moderate problems, and extreme problems) －at 1 year after stroke. The Modified Rankin Scale (MRS), Barthel Index (BI), and NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) were used to measure clinical and <b>functional</b> <b>statuses.</b> The EQ- 5 Dindex and the clinical and <b>functional</b> <b>statuses</b> were compared by clinical parameters, and the relationships among those scales were examined. Additionally, the EQ- 5 Dindex in the patients was compared with that in age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Results: Among 538 patients with AIS or TIA, 465 patients (males, 59. 8 %; age, 65. 3 ± 11. 8 [mean±SD]; TIA, 7. 7 %; and initial NIHSS, 4. 5 ± 5. 1) were evaluated. The EQ- 5 Dindex and the clinical and <b>functional</b> <b>statuses</b> were clearly aggravated by age, but did not differ with most of the risk factors. The EQ- 5 Dindex was strongly and significantly correlated with scores on the MRS, BI, and NIHSS. The EQ- 5 Dindex was lower in patients (especially older ones) than in healthy controls...|$|R

25|$|A broader {{example of}} {{emergent}} properties in biology is {{viewed in the}} biological organisation of life, ranging from the subatomic level to the entire biosphere.

Another example is how cascade phenotype reactions, as detailed in chaos theory, arise from individual genes mutating respective positioning.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{validity}} of non-randomized studies using healthcare databases is often challenged {{because they lack}} information on potentially important confounders, such as <b>functional</b> health <b>status</b> and socioeconomic status. In a study quantifying the effects of influenza vaccination among community-dwelling elderly we assessed whether additional information on not routinely available covariates was indeed associated with exposure to influenza vaccination and could, therefore, have led to residual confounding in healthcare databases. METHODS: We randomly selected 500 persons aged 65 years and older from the computerized Utrecht General Practitioner database. Information on exposure status and on demographics, co-morbidity status, prior healthcare use and medication use was extracted from the database. A questionnaire was used to obtain additional information on not routinely available risk factors [e. g. <b>functional</b> health <b>status</b> (SF- 20), smoking status and alcohol consumption]. Missing data from the questionnaire was imputed and multivariable logistic regression analysis was applied to quantify the influence of covariates on the prediction of exposure to influenza vaccination. Within an existing dataset {{the potential impact of}} <b>functional</b> health <b>status</b> on the relation between influenza vaccination and mortality was simulated. RESULTS: We obtained questionnaire data from 365 of 500 (73 %) subjects. The model including routinely available data from the database appeared accurate in predicting exposure to influenza vaccination (c-statistic 0. 86, 95 % CI: 0. 82 - 0. 89). <b>Functional</b> health <b>status</b> was the only additional characteristic measured with the questionnaire that was not similar in vaccinated and unvaccinated subjects. However, extending the multivariable regression model with <b>functional</b> health <b>status</b> did not significantly improve the prediction of exposure to influenza vaccination, nor did it affect the relation between influenza vaccination and mortality. CONCLUSION: The potential for unmeasured confounding on the association between influenza vaccination and health outcomes as quantified in healthcare databases seems small for non-randomized intervention studies within extensive and reliable databases...|$|R

500|$|Because comorbid {{conditions}} such as OCD and ADHD can be more impairing than tics, these conditions are included in an evaluation of patients presenting with tics.

The initial assessment of a patient referred for a tic disorder should include a thorough evaluation, including a family history of tics, ADHD, obsessive–compulsive symptoms, and other chronic medical, psychiatric and neurological conditions. Children and adolescents with TS who have learning difficulties are candidates for psychoeducational testing, particularly if the child also has ADHD. Undiagnosed comorbid conditions may result in functional impairment, and it is necessary to identify and treat these conditions to improve functioning. Complications may include depression, sleep problems, social discomfort, self-injury, anxiety, personality disorders, oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorders.|$|E

40|$|PATIENT PERCEPTIONS OF PATIENT-EMPOWERING NURSE BEHAVIORS, PATIENT ACTIVATION, AND <b>FUNCTIONAL</b> HEALTH <b>STATUS</b> AFTER SURGERY Teresa A. Jerofke, BSN, MSN, APNP-BC Marquette University, 2013 Patient {{empowerment}} {{has been}} advocated {{as a way}} to engage patients in self-management of chronic illnesses in emerging patient-centered models for healthcare improvement. The majority of research on patient empowerment has studied empowerment as an outcome in outpatient settings, with little attention to provider processes used to empower patients during a hospitalization. Post-operative patients with life-threatening chronic illnesses face multiple illness-related transitions associated with the recovery from their surgery and taking on the role of managing their life-threatening chronic illnesses upon hospital discharge. A correlational, longitudinal design framed by Meleis 2 ̆ 7 Transitions Theory and the Individual and Family Self-Management Theory (IFSMT) was used to determine the relationship between patient perceptions of patient-empowering nurse behaviors in an acute care setting and patient activation and <b>functional</b> health <b>status</b> six-weeks post-discharge in patients who recently underwent a surgical procedure for cancer or cardiac disease. In addition, tests of validity and reliability were conducted on a newly constructed instrument, the Patient Perceptions of Patient-Empowering Nurse Behaviors Scale (PPPNBS). One hundred thirteen post-surgical cancer and cardiac patients participated. Patient perceptions of patient-empowering nurse behaviors and baseline patient activation were measured prior to discharge with the PPPNBS and 13 -item Patient Activation Measure (PAM 13). Patient activation and <b>functional</b> health <b>status</b> were measured six-weeks following discharge with the PAM 13 and SF- 36. Multiple linear regression using a simultaneous equation approach was used to identify significant relationships. Patient perceptions of patient-empowering nurse behaviors were significantly positively associated with post-discharge patient activation, which was significantly positively associated with mental <b>functional</b> health <b>status.</b> Length of stay was the only significant predictor of physical <b>functional</b> health <b>status.</b> The PPPNBS demonstrated acceptable validity and reliability in post-surgical patients with a life-threatening chronic illness. Implications for nursing practice, nursing research, and nursing education are identified. Patient-empowering nurse behaviors can be used to facilitate engagement in self-management behavior, improve <b>functional</b> health <b>status,</b> and should be examined {{as a way to}} improve the cost of chronic illness care through improved patient activation levels.

40|$|Background: Laparoscopic {{cholecystectomy}} {{is frequently}} an ambulatory procedure, but some patients are best admitted {{for a brief}} hospital stay. In this study, we compared the <b>functional</b> health <b>status,</b> symptoms, and outcomes of patients undergoing ambulatory elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy to those with brief hospital admission. The purpose was to assess patient satisfaction and to identify factors that might assist in selecting patients for ambulatory vs short-stay operations. Methods: A total of 140 patients scheduled for elective cholecystectomy completed the SF- 36 health survey and provided additional information regarding symptoms preoperatively, at 2 months, and at 6 months after operation. Results: All patients had symptomatic gallstones; 76 were admitted to the hospital, and 64 were ambulatory. Admitted patients reported more emotional role limitations on preoperative SF- 36. They also reported symptoms of depression more often. Patients in both groups were equally relieved of symptoms of pain, nausea, vomiting, and tenderness. Satisfaction with care was similar for both groups; however, at 2 and 6 months, admitted patients continued to report significantly poorer <b>functional</b> health <b>status</b> than ambulatory patients. Conclusion: A reliable, reproducible measure of <b>functional</b> health <b>status,</b> such as the SF- 36, may be useful for identifying patients who are appropriate for short-stay hospital admission after laparoscopic cholecystectomy {{as part of a}} decision process that tries to optimize outcomes while utilizing resources efficiently...|$|R
