40|$|Stimmay. -Following Lester, {{the rate}} of {{accidental}} <b>death</b> <b>from</b> firearms was asso-ciated with the percentage of firearms used in suicides and on homicide victims ex-cept for persons aged 55 + yr. One proxy measure {{of the availability of}} firearms in a society might be {{the rate of}} accidental <b>death</b> <b>from</b> firearms (Cook, 1982). Lester (2000) found that the rate of accidental <b>death</b> <b>from</b> firearms in Canada from 1970 - 1995 was positively associated with both the rates for homicide and suicide from firearms and significantly so for rate of accidental <b>death</b> <b>from</b> firearms and rate of homicide from firearms.

40|$|Background: With {{increasing}} life expectancy, population {{aging is}} becoming a global public health issue. Most evidence concerning modifiable factors for mortality in older people is derived from observational studies in long-term developed Western settings and they usually find moderate drinking associated with a lower risk of death whilst diabetes, for which obesity is a substantial risk factor, associated with {{a higher risk of}} <b>death</b> <b>from</b> cancer, especially for cancers related to obesity, such as colon and pancreatic cancer. However, older people in Hong Kong have different lifetime experiences. They have experienced macro-environmental transition from pre- to post-industrial living conditions in their own lifetime, as well as considerable social re-assortment. Results of the association of modifiable factors for mortality in this setting may act as a sentinel for mainland China and other similar settings where economic transitions are currently underway. Objectives: This study took advantage of a large (n= 66, 820) prospective elderly cohort (65 + years) from Hong Kong, a developed non-Western setting where patterns of lifestyle, chronic conditions, and socioeconomic position (SEP) differ from those in the West, to examine the association of alcohol use with <b>death</b> <b>from</b> cancer and respiratory disease, and to examine the association of self-reported diabetes, SEP and physical activity with <b>death</b> <b>from</b> all- and specific causes. Methods: All participants were enrolled from July 1998 to December 2001 at all the 18 Elderly Health Centers in Hong Kong, and followed until May 31, 2012. Multivariable Cox regression was used to analyze the association of alcohol use categories (never, social, moderate, excessive and ex-drinking) with <b>death</b> <b>from</b> cancer and respiratory disease, and to analyze the association of self-reported diabetes, SEP across the life course (education, housing type and monthly expenditure) and different types of physical activity (aerobic exercise, traditional Chinese exercise (TCE), stretching exercise and slow walking) with <b>death</b> <b>from</b> all- and specific causes. Results: Social drinking rather than moderate drinking was associated with a lower risk of <b>death</b> <b>from</b> non-esophageal cancer. Moderate drinking was associated with a higher risk of <b>death</b> <b>from</b> esophageal cancer. Both social drinking and moderate drinking were associated with a lower risk of <b>death</b> <b>from</b> respiratory disease with similar patterns of association. Self-reported diabetes was associated with a higher risk of <b>death</b> <b>from</b> all-causes, cardiovascular disease and respiratory disease, but was weakly associated with <b>death</b> <b>from</b> all-cancer, and only clearly associated with <b>death</b> <b>from</b> liver and stomach cancer. Socioeconomic disadvantages at different life stages contributed to <b>death</b> <b>from</b> all- and specific causes independently and sometimes interactively, often with a larger contribution from early life. TCE was inversely associated with <b>death</b> <b>from</b> all- and specific causes with similar estimates to aerobic exercise. Conclusion: This large prospective elderly cohort study from an understudied population found different associations of several modifiable factors including alcohol use, diabetes, SEP and physical activity, with mortality from those in the West. More effective and possibly contextually-specific public health strategies are needed. published_or_final_versionPublic HealthDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

40|$|Background The {{extent to}} which adult height, a {{biomarker}} of the interplay of genetic endowment and early-life experiences, is related to risk of chronic diseases in adulthood is uncertain. Methods We calculated hazard ratios (HRs) for height, assessed in increments of 6. 5 ¿cm, using individual–participant data on 174 ¿ 374 deaths or major non-fatal vascular outcomes recorded among 1 ¿ 085 ¿ 949 people in 121 prospective studies. Results For people born between 1900 and 1960, mean adult height increased 0. 5 – 1 ¿cm with each successive decade of birth. After adjustment for age, sex, smoking and year of birth, HRs per 6. 5 ¿cm greater height were 0. 97 (95 % confidence interval: 0. 96 – 0. 99) for <b>death</b> <b>from</b> any cause, 0. 94 (0. 93 – 0. 96) for <b>death</b> <b>from</b> vascular causes, 1. 04 (1. 03 – 1. 06) for <b>death</b> <b>from</b> cancer and 0. 92 (0. 90 – 0. 94) for <b>death</b> <b>from</b> other causes. Height was negatively associated with <b>death</b> <b>from</b> coronary disease, stroke subtypes, heart failure, stomach and oral cancers, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, mental disorders, liver disease and external causes. In contrast, height was positively associated with <b>death</b> <b>from</b> ruptured aortic aneurysm, pulmonary embolism, melanoma and cancers of the pancreas, endocrine and nervous systems, ovary, breast, prostate, colorectum, blood and lung. HRs per 6. 5 ¿cm greater height ranged from 1. 26 (1. 12 – 1. 42) for risk of melanoma death to 0. 84 (0. 80 – 0. 89) for risk of <b>death</b> <b>from</b> chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
