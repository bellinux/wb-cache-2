The paper also shows the necessary and sufficient conditions for both forms of debt, and the pareto-optimality of one over the other. The important findings of this paper are: (i) the existence of an equilibrium, where the borrowing interest rate is greater than the lending rate, despite the violation of Fisher separation theorem (1930); (ii) wealth plays a critical role in determining the debt ratio and the equilibrium risk-free rate of interest, complementing the De Meza and Webb (1987 and 1999) studies; (iii) an explanation for the preferred stock and <b>income</b> <b>bond</b> puzzles, extending Fooladi et al.

The Japanese experience of the 1980 s provides several insights about the way to manage such a transition and the downsides to avoid. In particular Japan offers useful insights on (1) the limits to an export-oriented growth strategy; (2) the role of exchange rate, macroeconomic policies, and structural reforms in rebalancing the economy toward the nontradables sector; and (3) the risks associated with financial liberalization. The similarities between the Chinese economy today and the Japanese economy of the 1980 s make these insights relevant for China. However, with the benefit of analyzing the Japanese experience and, given the important differences between the two economies, China should be able to successfully rebalance its growth pattern while avoiding the downsides encountered by Japan.

40|$|The {{observed}} {{increase in}} the level and volatility of Tanzania''s Treasury yields in recent years against an otherwise benign macroeconomic backdrop presented a puzzle for policymakers, while raising concerns about the fiscal burden of rising debt interest payments and diversion of bank credit away from the private sector. Using evidence from bid-level data and supported by theoretical models, this paper argues that oligopolistic bidding through 2005 may have been partly responsible for the rising level of yields; while the high volatility during 2006 - 07 could be traced to the emergence of a sharp segmentation of the T-bill market between sophisticated financial market players (foreign-controlled banks) and a lessexperienced group of investors (domestic pension funds and small banks). An important policy recommendation that emerges is that public debt managers should avoid micromanaging Treasury bill auctions by issuing amounts in excess of those offered or by dipping into oversubscribed segments of the yield curve, as such practices seriously disadvantage the less-sophisticated (but more competitive) investors vis-Ã -vis the more sophisticated players.

The reasons for the price increases are the subject of as much debate and uncertainty. This research attempts to determine whether there is a statistically significant relationship between the economic indicators selected and residential property prices, which could provide some indication of the factors influencing residential property prices in South Africa. The economic indicators selected were interest rates, real gross domestic product, average <b>income,</b> <b>bond</b> affordability levels, rand to US dollar exchange rates and inflation. Residential property prices in South Africa were measured using two data bases, the ABSA database, which comprised average residential property prices split into affordable, middle and luxury segments, as well as the Standard Bank database comprising median residential property prices in South Africa. The sample period was determined by reference to the period when data in respect of all the variables was available. Autocorrelation was removed from the data and thereafter a stepwise regression was performed to determine which economic indicators had a statistically significant relationship to each category of residential property price. It was found that quarterly lagged disposable income per capita (average income) had a statistically significant relationship to affordable and luxury property segments, as well as the median property prices. No economic indicator was found to have a statistically significant relationship to middle segment property prices. Dissertation (MBA) [...] University of Pretoria, 2010.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} some {{conventional and}} new measures of market, credit, and liquidity risks for government bonds. These measures are analyzed {{from the perspective}} of a sovereign''s debt manager. In particular, it examines duration, convexity, M-square, skewness, kurtosis, and VaR statistics as measures of interest rate exposure; a VaR statistic as the prominent measure of exchange rate exposure; the balance sheet approach (or contingent claims approach), and its consequent probability of default as the most promising measure of credit risk exposure; and an elasticity approach and a VaR statistic to measure liquidity risk. Along with the formulas for the various statistics proposed, we provide simple examples of their application to some common risk valuation cases. Finally, we present an integrated approach for the simultaneous estimation of a portfolio''s interest rate and exchange rate risk using the VaR methodology. The integrated approach is then extended to also include N risk factors. This approach allows us to measure the total risk of a portfolio, provided that the volatilities and correlations among the risk factors can be estimated.

40|$|An {{implication}} of the "globalization hazard" hypothesis is that sudden stops could be prevented by offering foreign investors price guarantees on emerging markets assets. These guarantees create a tradeoff, however, because they weaken globalization hazard by creating international moral hazard. We study this tradeoff using an equilibrium asset-pricing model. Without guarantees, margin calls and trading costs cause Sudden Stops driven by Fisher''s debt-deflation process. Price guarantees prevent this deflation by propping up foreign asset demand, but their effectiveness and welfare implications depend critically on the price elasticity of foreign demand and on making the guarantees contingent on debt levels.
