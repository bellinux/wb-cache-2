The {{class of}} stick-breaking priors and their {{extensions}} are considered in classification and clustering problems {{in which the}} complexity, the number of possible models or clusters, can be either bounded or unbounded. A conjugacy property for the ex tended stick-breaking prior is established which allows for informative characterizations of the priors under i. i. d. sampling, and which further enables an informative characterization of the posterior in the classification model. Such characterizations show how to develop Monte Carlo algorithms for efficient posterior computing.

Seventy-two children were excluded due to prenatal diagnosis (n[*]=[*] 54) or clinical signs of cCHD (n[*]=[*] 18) before POS. Seven hundred ninety-five newborns did not receive POS, mainly due to early discharge after birth (n[*]=[*] 727; 91 %).

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{a programming language}} where all control is encoded in algebras and combinators over algebras. This language supports higher levels of abstraction than traditional functional languages and is amenable to calculation based optimization. Three well known transformations are illustrated. Each one, requiring varying levels of insight and creativity over ordinary functional programs, can be fully automated in an algebraic language. The algorithm encoding these transformations is presented. This algorithm is an improvement over our previous work since it works over a richer, more expressive language, encodes more transformations, and is more efficient. 1 Introduction We have developed a programming style we call algebraic programming because of its reliance on algebras and combinators for encoding control. Algebraic programs provide two advantages over traditional functional programs. First, they provide a mechanism for abstracting over type constructors, i. e. it <b>is</b> <b>pos</b> [...] ...|$|E

Solutions have often involved the hand-tuning of general natural language processing systems to a particular domain. However, such solutions may be difficult to apply to "informal" domains, domains based on genres characterized by syntactically unparsable text and frequent out-of-lexicon terms. With the growth of the Internet, such genres, which include email messages, newsgroup posts, and Web pages, are particularly abundant, and there is no lack of potential information extraction applications.
