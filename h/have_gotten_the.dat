5|$|The ensuing kickoff saw {{yet another}} Connecticut special-teams blunder. UConn running back Robbie Frey misplayed the ball {{off of the}} kickoff, letting it roll back into the end zone. Frey {{recovered}} the loose ball; if he had simply taken a knee, by rule {{it would have been}} a touchback and the Huskies would <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>the</b> ball at their own 20-yard line. Instead, Frey carried the ball out of the end zone, was hit at the 4-yard line, and fumbled. Buffalo recovered and promptly scored on a 4-yard touchdown run by Bull running back James Starks, giving themselves a 20–10 lead. UConn had committed its fifth fumble of the game, four of which were recovered by Buffalo. All of Buffalo's 20 points were directly off of UConn turnovers.|$|E
5|$|After {{tying up}} Ms. Botz, the kids find all their {{telephones}} disabled (which Ms. Botz had done earlier) {{and go to}} a nearby payphone to alert the authorities. Meanwhile, Marge tries to call home to check up on the kids but because there is no answer, she and Homer decide to cancel their motel reservation and go home. They find Ms. Botz bound and gagged in front of the TV. Homer, thinking his children <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>the</b> best of another babysitter and unaware of her true identity, frees her and pays her handsomely. After advising Homer to keep both eyes on Bart, Ms. Botz makes a clean getaway, just seconds before the kids arrive with the police and news media to arrest her. As Bart tries to lead the police to the house, Homer attempts to berate him for his behavior towards Ms. Botz, only to be informed by a news reporter about Ms. Botz's true identity and that he just freed her. Realizing his mistake, a humiliated Homer attempts to save face by claiming he fought Botz and she escaped, then warning her on camera never to show her face to him again. Later that night, Homer moans about his blunder on TV, but Marge cheers him up by saying that if he raised three children who can hogtie a perfect stranger, he must be doing something right.|$|E

25|$|The Pistons {{opened up}} with a rout in Game 1, as Detroit's big men keyed in on Dwight Howard and forced him to playoff lows 12 points and 8 rebounds, with five Pistons scoring in double figures. After being quiet in Game 1, the Magic's 3-point {{shooting}} picked up (11/26, with Jameer Nelson making 5-of-8), but could not overcome 19 turnovers and fell down in the series 2–0. There was a controversial call {{at the end of}} the third quarter, where Chauncey Billups made a 3 near the end of the 3rd quarter when the clock froze and approximately 0.5 seconds remained, but TNT clocks later revealed that Billups could not <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>the</b> ball off in time.|$|E
25|$|Since November 2009, 14 deaths as {{a result}} of swine flu in Northern Ireland have been reported. The {{majority}} of the victims were reported to have pre-existing health conditions which had lowered their immunity. This closely corresponds to the 19 patients who had died in the year prior due to swine flu, where 18 of the 19 were determined to have lowered immune systems. Because of this, many mothers who have just given birth are strongly encouraged to get a flu shot because their immune systems are vulnerable. Also, studies have shown that people between the ages of 15 and 44 have the highest rate of infection. Although most people now recover, having any conditions that lower one's immune system increases the risk of having the flu become potentially lethal. In Northern Ireland now, approximately 56% of all people under 65 who are entitled to the vaccine <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>the</b> shot, and the outbreak is said to be under control.|$|E

500|$|The star which {{prompted}} Poe to write [...] "Al Aaraaf" [...] {{was believed to}} foretell disaster or that humanity would be punished for breaking God's laws.

The name of the star has been changed from [...] "Al Orf" [...] to [...] "Al Aaraaf" [...] to become similar to the word arafa, which means distinguishing between things. Additionally, Poe was indebted to Irish poet Thomas Moore, whose poem Lalla-Rookh inspired, among other parts of [...] "Al Aaraaf", the catalogue of flowers near the beginning. Another work by Moore, The Loves of the Angels, inspired Poe's idea of uniting mortal and immortal love.|$|E
500|$|During Greenwalt's {{restructuring}} of the pilot, all of the original actors save for the male lead role of Mick St. John were recast in June 2007: Shannon Lucio, Rade Šerbedžija and Amber Valletta were originally cast in the roles of Beth Turner, Josef Kostan and Coraline Duvall respectively before Sophia Myles, Jason Dohring and Shannyn Sossamon replaced them. With an almost entirely different cast, a retooled, full-length pilot for television audiences was re-shot. Joel Silver approached Dohring [...] "out of the blue and said, 'There's a role, and I'm making it younger'". Dohring read two pages of script featuring Josef, and was interested by the character's [...] "dark" [...] and [...] "sharp" [...] personality.

He believed the changes granted the studio's and network's wish to [...] "make it a little younger and hipper". O'Laughlin felt that the whole cast's becoming [...] "a little bit younger" [...] especially effected the character Josef, as the originally chosen actor, Šerbedžija, was twice Jason Dohring's age. The creators and the network were concerned that Josef, whose relationship with Mick was important, would appear as more of a [...] "father figure" [...] rather than as a friend. O'Laughlin supported the recasting of Josef with a younger actor due to the resulting [...] "level of ease in that age difference".|$|E

500|$|The eighth {{season of}} The Office {{received}} mixed reviews. While some critics {{felt that the}} show was still humorous in its eighth year, many others argued that the program should have ended after the departure of Steve Carell. The A.V. Club reviewer Myles McNutt criticized Robert California's role, noting that he a character that [...] "the narrative reacts to as opposed to something actually involved in the narrative". Alan Sepinwall of HitFix criticized Ed Helms' comedic performance as manager (calling him [...] "a softer version of Michael Scott"), {{as well as the}} toning down of Robert California from his appearance in the show's seventh season's finale, [...] "Search Committee". Sepinwall also expressed disappointment that many of the supporting characters were seemingly transformed into mere caricatures of their former selves. He stopped reviewing a majority of the Season 8 episodes since [...] "Pam's Replacement", due to his distaste for the series. Time writer James Poniewozik also criticized the choice of Andy as manager, instead arguing that Jim should <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>the</b> job so the series could have been more ensemble-oriented. New York named Andy Bernard one of the most annoying TV characters of 2011. Matt Zoller Seitz from New York wrote, [...] "Fact is, the show's first post–Steve Carell year has been a mess, at times bordering on a disaster", although he did write, [...] "Nevertheless, I still adore these characters, even when the writing doesn't do them justice." [...] McNutt gave the season a [...] "C" [...] grade overall, writing that the season finale, [...] "Free Family Portrait Studio" [...] was [...] "a disheartening conclusion to the show's worst season, offering little optimism to sustain our already dwindling enthusiasm over the summer months." ...|$|E

[...] Detective fiction, however, had no real precedent and the word detective had not yet been coined when Poe first introduced Dupin.

More recently, both Elms and librarian Lee Weinstein have gathered circumstantial evidence to support the case for Linebarger's being Allen, but both concede there is no direct proof that Linebarger was ever a patient of Lindner's or that he suffered from a disorder similar to that of Kirk Allen.|$|E
