5|$|Corona Borealis {{is home to}} two {{remarkable}} {{variable star}}s. T Coronae Borealis is a cataclysmic variable star {{also known as the}} Blaze Star. Normally placid around magnitude 10—it has a minimum of 10.2 and maximum of 9.9—it brightens to magnitude 2 in a period of hours, caused by a nuclear chain reaction and the subsequent explosion. T Coronae Borealis <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>handful</b> of stars called recurrent novae, which include T Pyxidis and U Scorpii. An outburst of T Coronae Borealis was first recorded in 1866; its second recorded outburst was in February 1946. T Coronae Borealis is a binary star with a red-hued giant primary and a white dwarf secondary, the two stars orbiting each other over a period of approximately 8 months. R Coronae Borealis is a yellow-hued variable supergiant star, over 7000 light-years from Earth, and prototype of a class of stars known as R Coronae Borealis variables. Normally of magnitude 6, its brightness periodically drops as low as magnitude 15 and then slowly increases over the next several months. These declines in magnitude come about as dust that has been ejected from the star obscures it. Direct imaging with the Hubble Space Telescope shows extensive dust clouds out to a radius of around 2000AU from the star, corresponding with a stream of fine dust (composed of grains 5nm in diameter) associated with the star's stellar wind and coarser dust (composed of grains with a diameter of around 0.14µm) ejected periodically.|$|E
