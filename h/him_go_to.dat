Homer has made Bart's visit {{conditional}} on him getting at least a C- average on his report card. Bart receives a D- in each subject from Ms. Krabappel, so he changes each grade into straight A+. Homer chides Bart for not faking plausible grades, but lets <b>him</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> camp anyway, {{because he does not}} want Bart hanging around throughout the summer.|$|E
5|$|The French colonial {{administration}} recognised tribal leaders; they {{arranged to}} have Houphouët go to school at the military post in Bonzi, not far from his village, in order to prepare for his future as a leader, despite strenuous objections from relatives, especially his great-aunt Yamousso. In 1915, he {{was transferred to the}} école primaire supérieure (secondary) at Bingerville in spite of his family's reluctance to have <b>him</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> boarding school. The same year, at Bingerville, Houphouët converted to Christianity; he considered it a modern religion and an obstacle to the spread of Islam. He chose to be christened Félix.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Liverpool, {{he was put}} in charge of the Clarendon Furnishing shop in Hoylake and was made a director of NEMS in 1955. In September 1956, he took a trip to London to meet a friend but after being there for only one day, was robbed of his passport, birth certificate, chequebook, wristwatch, and all the money he had on him. He did not want his parents to find out, so he worked as a department store clerk until he had earned enough money to buy a train ticket back to Liverpool. Back in Liverpool, he confessed his homosexuality to a psychiatrist—a friend of the Epstein family—who suggested to Harry Epstein that his son should leave Liverpool as soon as possible. During the sessions, Epstein revealed his ambition of becoming an actor, so his parents allowed <b>him</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> London to study.|$|E

They also said they would not let <b>him</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the United States unless the Houston Rockets would take him first overall. After assurances from Team Yao that the Rockets would draft Yao with their number one pick, the CBA gave permission {{on the morning of the}} draft for Yao to play in the U.S. When the Rockets selected Yao with the first pick of the draft, he became the first international player ever to be selected first overall without having previously played U.S. college basketball.|$|E

At the time, the warlord Gongsun Du controlled the nearby Liaodong Commandery (遼東郡; around present-day Liaoyang, Liaoning). While Liang Mao passed by Liaodong en route to Lelang, Gongsun Du detained him in Liaodong and refused to let <b>him</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Lelang. Liang Mao was unfazed by Gongsun Du's bold and illegal action.|$|E

The following campaign, {{he was used}} in the same fashion in the transfer of Sébastien Frey, which saw <b>him</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Inter Milan while Frey went in the other direction. After two seasons and a good number of starts, he would eventually leave Inter by mutual agreement and re-joined Lazio, leaving for former club Porto towards the end of 2003–04, again by mutual agreement, and adding his third Portuguese national championship.|$|E

25|$|He {{tells of}} how, {{rallying}} the other survivors, {{he built a}} fleet of ships and made landfall at various locations in the Mediterranean: Thrace, where they find the last remains of a fellow Trojan, Polydorus; the Strophades, where they encounter the Harpy Celaeno, who tells them to leave her island and to look for Italy; Crete, which {{they believe to be}} the land where they are to build their city, which they name Pergamea (but they are set straight by Apollo); and Buthrotum. This last city had been built in an attempt to replicate Troy. In Buthrotum, Aeneas meets Andromache, the widow of Hector. She is still lamenting the loss of her valiant husband and beloved child. There, too, Aeneas sees and meets Helenus, one of Priam's sons, who has the gift of prophecy. Through him, Aeneas learns the destiny laid out for him: he is divinely advised to seek out the land of Italy (also known as Ausonia or Hesperia), where his descendants will not only prosper, but in time rule the entire known world. In addition, Helenus also bids <b>him</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the Sibyl in Cumae.|$|E
500|$|Zappa {{was often}} {{characterized}} as an atheist. He recalled his parents being [...] "pretty religious" [...] {{and trying to}} make <b>him</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Catholic school despite his resentment. He felt disgust towards organized religion (Christianity in particular) because he believed that it promoted ignorance and anti-intellectualism. On Dweezil's birth certificate, Frank wrote [...] "musician" [...] for [...] "father's religion". Some of his songs, concert performances, interviews and public debates in the 1980s criticized and derided Republicans and their policies, President Ronald Reagan, the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), televangelism, and the Christian Right, and warned that the United States government was in danger of becoming a [...] "fascist theocracy".|$|E
500|$|The {{idea for}} the show came from Conan O'Brien, who thought of Marge getting {{a job at the}} power plant and that Mr. Burns has a crush on her. The animators had trouble animating Marge with the suit and lipstick. Director Jeff Lynch said there were a few scenes where Marge [...] "looks like a monster". All the jargon used by Troy McClure was {{accurately}} taken from a Time–Life foundation repair book. The original subplot for the episode was Mr. Burns telling Homer to dress up as Mister Atom and have <b>him</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> schools to talk to the children. The cast really liked Tom Jones as a guest star. They said he was fun to work with, and was really nice, and even offered to perform a concert after he was done recording lines.|$|E

500|$|The Prijedor communists were keen {{to rescue}} Stojanović from his imprisonment, but their {{attempts}} to bribe the Ustaše to release him failed. They also considered storming the school {{in which he was}} kept. On 17July, just after midnight, Stojanović asked a guard to let <b>him</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the toilet {{on the first floor of}} the school. The guard let him go and followed closely behind him. When they were halfway down the stairs, Stojanović shouted [...] "Fire!" [...] as smoke came from a room on the second floor. During the commotion of the guards and hostages extinguishing the fire, Stojanović entered the toilet and escaped through the window. He went to the village of Orlovci, several kilometres from Prijedor, where he was accompanied by Rade Bašića young communist who had earlier escaped from the town. Bašić escorted Stojanović toward Mount Kozara ( [...] high), north of the Prijedor plain.|$|E
500|$|Following the Mighty Ducks' Stanley Cup run, Kariya {{became an}} {{unrestricted}} free {{agent in the}} off-season. With Kariya requiring a $10 million qualifying offer from Anaheim to remain with the team, General Manager Bryan Murray let <b>him</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> free agency. Murray went on record saying, [...] "We understand {{that he is an}} important player for the franchise...but when you are trying to build a team it's hard to have one player at $10 million when your payroll is the mid to low ($40 million range)." [...] It was reported that the team had tried negotiating a longer-term deal with a decreased salary, while Murray told media {{at the time that he}} would remain in negotiations with Kariya to sign him for less. With former linemate Teemu Selänne also entering unrestricted free agency that summer after three years with San Jose (he decided to opt out of his final year, valued at $6.5 million), the duo agreed to reunite and sign with the same team. Together, they approached the Colorado Avalanche, having decided the team had the best chance of winning the Stanley Cup. On July 3, 2003, the Avalanche announced the signing of Kariya and Selänne to one-year contracts. In order for the team to afford both players, Kariya took an $8.8 million paycut from his $10 million salary with Anaheim the previous year, marking the highest decrease in compensation for a player in NHL history. At $1.2 million, his salary was below the NHL average, ensuring that he would have the freedom of unrestricted free agency at the end of the season. Selänne, meanwhile, signed for $5.8 million. Their deals were partially facilitated by goaltender Patrick Roy's retirement, which freed up $8.5 million in salary.|$|E

Zorin, who had taken on some qualities of other notable Bond villains (Blofeld's cat and suit, Emilio Largo's eye patch), was upset that everything was going wrong for him. His lair was still under construction; his henchmen had jump suits that didn't fit; and his shark tank lacked sharks, having a giant sea sponge instead. A captive James Bond, portrayed by Phil Hartman, offered to get Zorin [...] "a good deal" [...] on the abandoned Blofeld volcanic lair if Zorin let <b>him</b> <b>go,</b> <b>to</b> which he reluctantly agreed.|$|E

Rockne later recalled that Kirk and Gipp had been [...] "practically inseparable" [...] and reflected on his disappointment in losing the talented Kirk.

2500|$|Olaseni Lewis aged 23 died in 2010 at Bethlem Royal Hospital {{after police}} {{subjected}} him to prolonged restraint {{of a type}} known to be dangerous. Neither police nor medical staff intervened when Lewis became unresponsive. At coroner's inquest the jury found many failures by both police and medical staff which {{played a part in}} Lewis’s death. They said “The excessive force, pain compliance techniques and multiple mechanical restraints were disproportionate and unreasonable. On the balance of probability, this contributed to the cause of death.” Ajibola Lewis, Olaseni Lewis's mother claimed a nurse at Maudsley hospital where Lewis had been earlier warned against allowing his transfer to Bethlem. “She said to me, ‘Look, don’t let <b>him</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the Bethlem, don’t let him go there’,” his mother said.

His father made <b>him</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the crime scene and showed him what he had done. He then took the money and placed it in his Caracal home, intending to use it to buy a new house.

How?" [...] But he had reason to suspect it, as he had been washing his son's bloody clothes after the attacks. After Ion robbed the cashier, Florea confiscated the ax and knife and it was with these that he was secretly returning when he was arrested.|$|E
2500|$|Belief in {{spontaneous}} generation of {{certain forms of}} life from non-living matter goes back to Aristotle and ancient Greek philosophy and continued to have support in Western scholarship until the 19th century. This belief was paired with a belief in heterogenesis, i.e., that one form of life derived from a different form (e.g., bees from flowers). Classical notions of {{spontaneous generation}} held that certain complex, living organisms are generated by decaying organic substances. According to Aristotle, it was a readily observable truth that aphids arise from the dew that falls on plants, flies from putrid matter, mice from dirty hay, crocodiles from rotting logs {{at the bottom of}} bodies of water, and so on. In the 17th century, people began to question such assumptions. In 1646, Sir Thomas Browne published his Pseudodoxia Epidemica (subtitled Enquiries into Very many Received Tenets, and commonly Presumed Truths), which was an attack on false beliefs and [...] "vulgar errors." [...] His contemporary, Alexander Ross, erroneously refuted him, stating: [...] "To question this , is to question Reason, Sense, and Experience: If he doubts of this, let <b>him</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Ægypt, and there he will finde the fields swarming with mice begot of the mud of Nylus, to the great calamity of the Inhabitants." ...|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "Remember Me," [...] Clarke and a {{group from}} the Ark set off to a Grounder camp (Tondc) to {{complete}} their agreement for a truce. On the way, Clarke is haunted by visions of Finn. Bellamy tries to convince Clarke to let <b>him</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Mount Weather as an inside man; Clarke says she cannot lose him too. When they arrive at the village, Clarke burns Finn's corpse, along with the corpses of those he killed, in a traditional Grounder funeral. While grieving, Lexa tells Clarke of Costia, her own past love who was tortured and killed by Lexa's enemy, who believed she knew Lexa's secrets. She tells Clarke that love is weakness. At a dinner, Kane gifts Lexa {{with a bottle of}} liquor. When Gustus, her right hand, tests it for her, he appears to be poisoned, leading Lexa to believe it was an assassination attempt by the Sky People. Clarke immediately thinks it was Raven, as she was Finn's former girlfriend and loved him. Clarke confronts her; Raven punches Clarke for accusing her of doing it. Lexa nearly kills Raven, but Bellamy figures out it was Gustus who poisoned the cup, and Clarke proves it to Lexa by drinking from the bottle herself. Lexa kills Gustus. When Lincoln confronts Bellamy about how he knew it was Gustus, he says Gustus would do anything to protect Lexa. Clarke decides she sees Lexa's point about how love is a weakness and tells Bellamy he was right and should go to Mount Weather.|$|E
