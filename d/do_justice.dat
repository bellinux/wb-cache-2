5|$|During a rainy {{holiday in}} Hastings {{at the end}} of November 1903, Potter {{outlined}} a tale about a cat, a dog, and a tea party she called Something very very NICE. She discussed the Lakefield sketches as backgrounds for the tale with Warne. He proposed a large format volume similar to L. Leslie Brooke's Johnny Crow's Garden to <b>do</b> <b>justice</b> to the detail of the illustrations, but the entire project was set aside when The Tale of Benjamin Bunny and The Tale of Two Bad Mice were chosen for development and publication in 1904.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} <b>do</b> <b>justice</b> to the {{recording}} of Quadrophenia, the group decided {{to build their own}} studio, Ramport Studios in Battersea. Work started on building Ramport in November 1972, but five months later still lacked an adequate mixing desk that could handle recording Quadrophenia. Instead, Townshend's friend Ronnie Lane, bassist for The Faces, loaned his mobile studio for the sessions. Lambert ostensibly began producing the album in May, but missed recording sessions and generally lacked discipline. By mid 1973, Daltrey demanded that Lambert leave the Who's services. The band recruited engineer Ron Nevison, who had worked with Townshend's associate John Alcock, to assist with engineering.|$|E
5|$|Khan, Chopra, and Rampal {{underwent}} extensive {{martial arts}} training from an expert from the Shaolin Temple. The principal cast received training in {{different kinds of}} martial arts. Khan revealed that he {{had always wanted to}} look the way Amitabh Bachchan had in his films, but he said he gave his own interpretation to the role. After signing to do the film, Chopra was very excited, but a few days later, she became nervous, wondering if {{she would be able to}} <b>do</b> <b>justice</b> to the character. Having seen the original film as a teenager, Chopra avoided watching the film again as she did not wanted to imitate Zeenat Aman's portrayal of Roma. She made a conscious effort to give her own look and style to the character.|$|E
5|$|Now Sunderland {{found out}} {{how hard it is}} to score against this terrific defence of ours. Not for nothing have we scored 18 goals against two (both of them freaks) conceded in five ties all away from home. What can I say to <b>do</b> <b>justice</b> to that {{brilliant}} goalkeeper Gil Merrick, to wonderful young Trevor Smith and to the matchless Jeff Hall and Ken Green? Once again they mixed the old cement and constructed that brilliant wall of a defence. Sunderland would have needed to call in a firm of demolition contractors to destroy it.|$|E

5|$|The {{centre of}} {{attention}} is {{in large part}} on the characters, described often with a personal slant and using memorable expressions ("It is we who are Hamlet") and incorporating psychological insights that were to become highly influential in later criticism. Though at first less influential, Hazlitt's comments on the plays' dramatic structure and poetry and on the central themes and general mood of each play laid the groundwork for later critics' more elaborate interpretations. Frequently expressing the view that stage presentation could not <b>do</b> <b>justice</b> to Shakespeare's plays, Hazlitt nevertheless also found certain plays eminently actable, and he frequently admired the performances of certain actors, particularly Edmund Kean.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{scheduled}} for a single theatrical release, on 13 March 2008, Warner Bros. announced that the film adaptation of Deathly Hallows would be split into two parts to <b>do</b> <b>justice</b> to the book and {{out of respect for}} its fans.Yates, director ofthe previous two films,was confirmed to return as director, and Kloves was confirmed as screenwriter. For {{the first time in the}} series, Rowling was credited as a producer alongside Heyman and Barron, however Yates noted that her participation in the filmmaking process did not change from the previous films. Pre-production began on 26 January 2009, while principal photography began on 19 February at Leavesden Studios, where the previous six instalments were filmed. Pinewood Studios became the second studio location for shooting the seventh film. The premiere of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1 was held on 11 November 2010, at the Empire, Leicester Square in London, and the film was released in the United Kingdom and the United States on 19 November.|$|E
5|$|President Franklin D. Roosevelt died on April 12, 1945, {{after leading}} the United States {{through much of}} the Great Depression and World War II. Roosevelt had {{suffered}} from polio since 1921 and had helped found and strongly supported the March of Dimes to fight that crippling disease, so the ten-cent piece was an obvious way of honoring a president popular for his war leadership. On May 3, Louisiana Representative James Hobson Morrison introduced a bill for a Roosevelt dime. On May 17, Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau Jr. announced that the Mercury dime (also known as the Winged Liberty dime) would be replaced by a new coin depicting Roosevelt, to go into circulation {{about the end of the}} year. Approximately 90 percent of the letters received by Stuart Mosher, editor of The Numismatist (the journal of the American Numismatic Association), were supportive of the change, but he himself was not, arguing that the Mercury design was beautiful and that the limited space on the dime would not <b>do</b> <b>justice</b> to Roosevelt; he advocated a commemorative silver dollar instead. Others objected that despite his merits, Roosevelt had not earned a place alongside Washington, Jefferson and Lincoln, the only presidents honored on the circulating coinage to that point. As the Mercury design, first coined in 1916, had been struck for at least 25 years, it could be changed under the law by the Bureau of the Mint. No congressional action was required, though the committees of each house with jurisdiction over the coinage were informed.|$|E

25|$|The actual {{existence}} of far-reaching type-differences, of which I have described eight groups in , has {{enabled me to}} conceive the two controversial theories of neurosis as manifestations of a type-antagonism.

25|$|Also, the {{so-called}} neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development maintained that Piaget's theory does not <b>do</b> <b>justice</b> {{either to the}} underlying mechanisms of information processing that explain transition from stage to stage or individual differences in cognitive development. According to these theories, changes in information processing mechanisms, such as speed of processing and working memory, are responsible for ascension from stage to stage. Moreover, differences between individuals in these processes explain why some individuals develop faster than other individuals (Demetriou, 1998).|$|E
