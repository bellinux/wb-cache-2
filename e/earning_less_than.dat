Hope Shakespear relented when the couple agreed to a church wedding rather than a civil ceremony, which took place on 20April 1914. Olivia gave them two early circus drawings by Pablo Picasso.|$|E
5|$|The CSR {{subsidies}} {{are paid to}} insurance companies to reduce copayments and deductibles for a smaller group of ACA enrollees, those <b>earning</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 250% of the federal poverty line (FPL). The second and larger type of subsidy, the premium tax credits designed to reduce the post-subsidy cost of monthly premiums, apply to all enrollees <b>earning</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 400% of the FPL. For scale, during 2017, approximately $7 billion in CSR subsidies will be paid, versus $34 billion for the premium tax credits. A court decision meant that CSR subsidies were treated as discretionary spending, meaning Congress must decide to appropriate funds for them each year. This effectively gave the President the power to end them, as Democrats with a minority in Congress could not appropriate the funds, let alone override his veto of an appropriations bill.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} theatrically in the United States and Canada in September 1982 {{and then quickly}} withdrawn because of its poor performance at the box office. It has never been released on home video, although it has sometimes been broadcast on television. It was the largest financial loss in film of 1982, <b>earning</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> $2 million. Reviewers at the time gave it consistently bad reviews and later commentators including Newsweek, TV Guide and Canadian Press have classed Inchon among the worst films of all time.|$|E

30|$|In {{this paper}} we use matched firm-employee data on over 500, 000 workers {{to examine whether}} firms comply with legal minimum wages and other pay {{regulations}} in China. We find evidence that there is broad compliance with minimum wages in China in that very few full-time workers <b>earn</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> the monthly minimum wage.

5|$|During {{the second}} phase, {{starting}} in June 2012, {{half of the}} funds from energy and food subsidies will be re-allocated {{to the people and}} the remaining 50% will go to the industrial sector. If approved by the Parliament, the government will pay an extra cash handout of 280,000 rials/month to 80% of the general population (i.e. people <b>earning</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> $2000/month, which is a comfortable income level in Iran). In July 2012, it was announced that implementation of the second phase was suspended awaiting further adjustments by the government and because of raising inflation (around 22% as of April 2012). Finally, in fall 2013, the parliament approved a plan to drop 22 million Iranians—the top 30 percent of earners—from the subsidy system instead. Yet, it was reported in 2014 that out of Iran’s population of 77 million, 73.6 million registered to receive the cash hand-outs.|$|E
5|$|In 1918, {{the salary}} for patrolmen {{was set at}} $1,400 a year. Police {{officers}} had to buy their own uniforms and equipment which cost over $200.

In the years following World War I, inflation dramatically eroded {{the value of a}} police officer's salary. From 1913 to May 1919, the cost of living rose by 76%, while police wages rose just 18%. Discontent and restiveness among the Boston police force grew as they compared their wages and found they were <b>earning</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> an unskilled steelworker, half as much as a carpenter or mechanic and 50 cents a day less than a streetcar conductor.

25|$|Ford's {{next two}} films stand {{somewhat}} {{apart from the}} rest of his films in terms of production, and he notably took no salary for either job. The Rising of the Moon (Warner Bros, 1957) was a three-part 'omnibus' movie shot on location in Ireland and based on Irish short stories. It was made by Four Province Productions, a company established by Irish tycoon Lord Killanin, who had recently become Chair of the International Olympic Committee, and to whom Ford was distantly related.
