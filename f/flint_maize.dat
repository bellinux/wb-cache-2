40|$|Most of the {{varieties}} of cultivated maize (Zen mays, L.) in Europe are crosses between European flint and U. S. dent germplasm. At present, no commercial flint hybrids have been obtained from crosses among European inbreds. Flint germplasm could be an alternative to obtain early high-yielding hybrids, potentially useful to produce high quality flours. To include flint germplasm in a breeding program, however, {{it would be useful}} to know its relationships with other types of germplasm The objective of this work was to study the performance of <b>flint</b> <b>maize</b> varieties in crosses with testers from different heterotic groups. Ten open pollinated <b>flint</b> <b>maize</b> varieties were crossed to four inbred testers representing Reid Yellow Dent, Lancaster Sure-crop and European flint heterotic groups. Testcrosses were evaluated in four environments in northwestern Spain. Variability for many trails was mainly due to general combing ability (GCA) of varieties or tester; thus, additive effects were more important in the differences among varieties and testers. For yield, most of the variability was due to the GCA of testers, indicating homogeneous performance of the flint populations included in this study. Varieties yielded more in crosses to A 632, a Reid Yellow Dent-type inbred line. The flint varieties had a higher yield in crosses to dent testers than to the European flint tester. This information could be useful to develop new inbred lines that would increase the variability present in commercial European <b>flint</b> <b>maize.</b> The specific combinig ability (SCA) of Gallego, Gallego/Hembrilla Norteńo, Norteńo, Norteńo Largo, Fino, Tremesino, and Basto/Enano Levantino with the tester A 632 as well as the SCA of varieties Gallego and Basto/Enano levantino with the inbred line B 93 could be improved to obtain new promising hybrids between flint and dent maize inbreds.

The objectives of this work were to assess the potential value of <b>flint</b> white <b>maize</b> inbreds from northwestern Spain and to determine the genetic effects of quality. A diallel among flint and dent white inbred lines was evaluated in northwestern Spain, and generation mean analyses were performed for three crosses representing flint by flint, dent by dent, and flint by dent combinations. Dent × dent hybrids had low density. Considering grain yield and density together, the best hybrids were EP 64 × K 301, EP 71 × K 301, and EC 22 × Mo 20 W, which had poor milling test values, and high proportions of whole kernels. Considering the relative importance of nonadditive genetic effects, the final goal of breeding programs should be to obtain hybrids. Both additive and nonadditive genetic effects have to be taken into account to improve any of these traits in the flint genetic background.

40|$|Maize is {{primarily}} grown as an energy crop, but {{the use of}} different specific versions, such as high-oil maize, high-lysine maize, waxy maize, white-seeded maize, popping maize and sweet maize, is quite extensive. Speciality maize, due to its traits and genetic control of these traits, requires a particular attention in handling breeding material during the processes of breeding. It is especially related to prevention of uncontrolled pollination. In order to provide successful selection for a certain trait, the following specific procedures in evaluation of the trait are necessary: the estimation of a popping volume and flake quality in popping maize; the determination of sugars and harvest maturity in sweet maize; the determination of oil in selected samples of high-oil maize types, and so forth. Breeding programmes for speciality maize, except high-amylose maize, have been implemented at the Maize Research Institute, Zemun Polje, Belgrade, for the last 45 years.

40|$|Most maize (Zea mays L.) hybrids {{cultivated}} in Europe follow the heterotic pattern European flint × Corn Belt dent.

A flint × flint heterotic pattern could be an alternative to use in breeding programs to obtain early maturity, high-yielding hybrids, potentially useful for producing high quality flours. The objective of this work was to search for heterotic patterns within flint germplasm adapted to temperate conditions. Ten open-pollinated <b>flint</b> <b>maize</b> cultivars were crossed in a diallel design without reciprocals and evaluated in four environments in northwestern Spain. Cultivar effects explained most of the sum of squares for traits analyzed, except for yield. Crosses yielded 30 % more than parental cultivars. Yield of crosses ranged from 3. 94 to 5. 61 Mg ha− 1 Midparent heterosis values ranged from 2. 5 to 64. 7 %. The crosses ‘Gallego’ × ‘Basto/Enano Levantino’ and Basto/Enano Levantino × ‘Longfellow’ showed high heterosis and the best averages for grain yield. On {{the basis of these}} results, these crosses could be included in a recurrent reciprocal selection breeding program to increase heterosis among the cultivars and improve their hybrids. A cluster analysis made with midparent heterosis for grain yield as a measure of distance revealed that the flint germplasm probably had similar origins and were related to the ‘Northern Flint’ race. Some differences among these cultivars were detected. ‘Norteño Largo’ was closely related to Northern Flint, while Basto/Enano Levantino was {{different from the rest of}} the cultivars.

40|$|Background and Purpose: Photosynthetic {{efficiency}} in crops can {{be associated with}} stress resistance and yield increase. In maize, photosynthetic efficiency is important in inbred lines during breeding process and in seed production, as well as in hybrids.

Moreover, this investigation will serve as a preliminary study for the QTL analysis of chlorophyll fluorescence parameters in order to understand the genetic and physiological background to drought stress tolerance in maize. Materials and Method: Photosynthetic efficiency was measured in maize field nursery in Osijek during silking by Hansatech Handy-PEA analyzer in the elite inbreds Os 1767 / 99, Os 1252 / 99, Os 163 _ 9, B 73, Mo 17, Os 6 _ 2 i B 84. The data obtained were used to calculate two biophysical parameters that describe the photochemistry of PSII: maximum quantum yield of photosystem II (Fv/Fm) and performance index on absorption basis (PIABS). Obtained data were subjected to statistical analysis applying least significant difference (LSD) and cluster analysis. Results and Conclusions: Differences in photosynthetic efficiency appeared to be higher within dent inbred lines than between dents and flints. Although investigated parameters of chlorophyll fluorescence (Fv/Fm and PIABS) revealed similar clustering of inbred lines, there was slight difference concerning the grouping of the line Os 6 _ 2. Therefore we recommend the combined use of these two main parameters of chlorophyll fluorescence when the investigation includes photosynthetic performance in stress challenged plants, such as water-limited conditions...|$|R

Despite inherent variations in culture conditions, differences were apparent between VOLGA and the three other hybrids. The principal mode was characteristic of the fraction considered, without clear varietal differentiation. Analysis of the secondary mode of fine semolina and flours showed that it was principally due to particles similar in size to starch granules (14 to 17 /*m), VOLGA particles being smaller than the others. The relative "weight" of the secondary mode was greater with VOLGA than with the three other maize types. The small differences observed between DEA and the ROSSO and MONARQUE hybrids were not significant. A technological behaviour index is proposed: the calculated quantity (g) of very fine particles constituting the secondary modes of fine semolina and flours (per 1 g of ground maize). This index is inversely correlated with the yield of grits (r= 0. 913 for the 26 samples), and may therefore prove useful in the cultivation and processing of maize...|$|E

A total of 326 markers, comprising 8 RAPD, 7 I-SSR, 259 AFLP, 28 SAMPL, 24 SSR, were scored in 64 F 1 individuals obtained from a cross between a highly heterozygous genotype of the landrace with the inbred line B 37. Grouping of the markers at a LOD score of 5. 0 resulted in 10 linkage groups and a framework map covering 1826 cM was assembled by using 282 markers that could be ordered with a LOD threshold of 2. 5. The efficiency of pseudo-testcross strategy was concluded to be around twice compared to that of backcross because of its higher ability to detect the recombination events occurring between pairs of linked loci. Of the total markers, 12. 5 % showed segregation distortion in the F 1 population, whereas in the BC 1 the distortion was evident for 18. 5 % of loci. The results are discussed in terms of map use as a tool for characterizing the Italian maize germplasm and designing an appropriate conservation...|$|E
40|$|Maize (Zea mays L.) {{used for}} human {{consumption}} is frequently processed following traditional methods with unknown effects. The objectives of this research consist of studying genotypic and environmental effects on grain quality {{for human consumption}} and evaluating traditional grain processing methods. Three maize varieties were evaluated for 2 yr in two locations. Populations were significantly different for grain quality while grain yield and pericarp damage were mostly affected by environment. Moisture content varied from 24 % for early harvest to 20 % for late harvest, pericarp damage from 24 to 19 %, and germination from 62 to 84 %. Environments explained most of the variation while harvest dates affected mainly grain hardness and germination. In addition, white <b>flint</b> <b>maize</b> grains were processed {{with a combination of}} drying, freezing, vacuum, and storage treatments. Drying with warm air after natural drying increased grain quality compared to natural drying alone. Medium term storage increased grain quality but reduced germination. Traditional processing was adequate for adapted varieties and typical uses but additional drying, freezing, or vacuum can be worthwhile depending on grain conditions and final use. To optimize quality, the key issues are appropriate growth cycle and proper harvest time. Furthermore, quality and agronomic performance can be managed independently of each other except for the negative correlation between moisture and milling test.

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{theory and}} analysis of partial diallel crosses based on Hayman's methods. This genetic design consists of crosses among two parental groups. It should be used when there are two groups of parents, for example, dent and <b>flint</b> <b>maize</b> inbred lines, and the breeder {{is not interested in}} the assessment of crosses between parents of the same group. Analyses are carried out using data from the parents and their F 1 hybrids allowing a detailed characterization of the polygenic systems under study and the choice of parents for hybridization. Diallel analysis allows the estimation of genetic and non-genetic components of variation and genetic parameters and to assess the following: genetic variability in each group; genotypic differences between parents of distinct groups; if a parent has a common or a rare genotype in the group to which it does not belong; if there is dominance; if dominant genes increase or decrease trait expression (direction of dominance); average degree of dominance in each group; the relative importance of mean effects of genes and dominance in determining a trait; if, in each group, the allelic genes have the same frequency; if genes are equally frequent in the two groups; the group with the greatest frequency of favorable genes; the group in which dominant genes are most frequent; the relative number of dominant and recessive genes in each parent; if a parent has a common or a rare genotype in the group to which it belongs, and the genotypic differences between parents of the same group.

40|$|Much of {{our modern}} maize {{germplasm}} was originally {{brought about by}} the combination of northern flint lines and southern dent lines. Yet commercial production in the US today is dominated by dent or semi-dent kernel type maize (Corn Belt dent), which has hard outer walls of endosperm surrounding a soft floury interior that when dried compacts to form the characteristic dent {{in the top of the}} kernel. One major exception is flint type corn, which is grown in areas of North America, Europe, South America, the Caribbean and many parts of Africa. <b>Flint</b> <b>maize</b> is characterized by its rounded vitreous outer endosperm and soft granular center and has desirable qualities such as cold tolerance, disease and insect resistance as well as longer storage capacity than many dent lines. The Nested Association Mapping (NAM) population parent inbred lines represent many of the major kernel types found in maize. In 2006 the entire NAM population of recombinant inbred lines were grown and scored visually for kernel type, in five locations. The NAM population contains 25 parents, of which, there are nine flint, nine semi-dent, four dent, two sweet and one popcorn parent lines, with a common dent parent, B 73. Linkage mapping with ~ 7400 intervals markers was used to examine the genetics of kernel morphology. This yielded several areas of the genome that are significantly associated with the difference in kernel type seen in NAM. Several other major and minor QTL are shared across many families. Genome wide association study (GWAS) was also used in the maize association panel. Suggested peaks from both linkage mapping and GWAS highlight 13 candidate genes in starch and protein related pathways in the endosperm...|$|E
40|$|Maize (Zea mays L.) landraces {{have the}} highest genetic {{variation}} and adaptation to the natural and anthropological environment where they have evolved. Surveying both qualitative and quantitative morphological traits of existing landraces {{may be useful in}} maintaining their genetic diversity and preserving them from genetic erosion. Our research deals with the morpho-phenological and agronomic characterization of a <b>flint</b> <b>maize</b> landrace, named ‘Nostrano di Storo’, still grown in an inland hilly environment in the low valley of Chiese River in Trentino, North-Eastern Italy. The majority of plants from twenty field populations proved to belong, with few exceptions (NSt 2, NSt 9, NSt 11), to a single population. It means that the plant material long grown in this area and maintained by local farmers through yearly selection forms a single landrace within which some populations (i. e. NSt 1, NSt 3, NSt 4, NSt 7, NSt 10, NSt 18, NSt 19, NSt 20) could be considered as most representative and taken as ‘core’. This is supported {{by the fact that the}} genetic variability was much higher within than between field populations: half of the plant and ear traits investigated did not show any significant difference between populations whereas all traits but two showed highly significant differences within populations. Selection carried out over the years by each farmer according to his own criteria produced little genetic differentiation within the original population. Gene flow among farmer populations, most likely occurred through both pollen dispersion to neighboring cultivated fields and seed exchange among farmers, may help to explain the low genetic differentiation. This information is useful for both planning conservation and recognizing the landrace as a unique germplasm source of specific geographic origin...|$|E
40|$|Background: Breeding {{for cold}} {{tolerance}} in maize promises to allow increasing growth area and production in temperate zones. The {{objective of this}} research was to conduct genome-wide association analyses (GWAS) in temperate maize inbred lines and to find strategies for pyramiding genes for cold tolerance. Two panels of 306 dent and 292 European <b>flint</b> <b>maize</b> inbred lines were evaluated per se and in testcrosses under cold and control conditions in a growth chamber. We recorded indirect measures for cold tolerance as the traits number of days from sowing to emergence, relative leaf chlorophyll content or quantum efficiency of photosystem II. Association mapping for identifying genes associated to cold tolerance in both panels was based on genotyping with 49, 585 genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. Results: We found 275 significant associations, most of them in the inbreds evaluated per se, in the flint panel, and under control conditions. A few candidate genes coincided between the current research and previous reports. A total of 47 flint inbreds harbored the favorable alleles for six significant quantitative trait loci (QTL) detected for inbreds per se evaluated under cold conditions, four of them had also the favorable alleles for the main QTL detected from the testcrosses. Only four dent inbreds (EZ 47, F 924, NK 807 and PHJ 40) harbored the favorable alleles for three main QTL detected from the evaluation of the dent inbreds per se under cold conditions. There were more QTL in the flint panel and most of the QTL were associated with days to emergence and FPSII. Conclusions: These results open new possibilities to genetically improve cold tolerance either with genome-wide selection or with marker assisted selection...|$|E
40|$|Genotyping by {{sequencing}} {{is suitable}} for analysis of global diversity in maize. We showed the distinctiveness of <b>flint</b> <b>maize</b> inbred lines of interest to enrich the diversity of breeding programs. Genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) is a highly cost-effective procedure that permits the analysis of large collections of inbred lines. We used it to characterize diversity in 1191 maize flint inbred lines from the INRA collection, the European Cornfed association panel, and lines recently derived from landraces. We analyzed the properties of GBS data obtained with different imputation methods, through comparison with a 50 K SNP array. We identified seven ancestral groups within the Flint collection (dent, Northern flint, Italy, Pyrenees-Galicia, Argentina, Lacaune, Popcorn) in agreement with breeding knowledge. Analysis highlighted many crosses between different origins and the improvement of flint germplasm with dent germplasm. We performed association studies on different agronomic traits, revealing SNPs associated with cob color, kernel color, and male flowering time variation. We compared the diversity of both our collection and the USDA collection which has been previously analyzed by GBS. The population structure of the 4001 inbred lines confirmed {{the influence of the}} historical inbred lines (B 73, A 632, Oh 43, Mo 17, W 182 E, PH 207, and Wf 9) within the dent group. It showed distinctly different tropical and popcorn groups, a sweet-Northern flint group and a flint group sub-structured in Italian and European flint (Pyrenees-Galicia and Lacaune) groups. Interestingly, we identified several selective sweeps between dent, flint, and tropical inbred lines that co-localized with SNPs associated with flowering time variation. The joint analysis of collections by GBS offers opportunities for a global diversity analysis of maize inbred lines...|$|E
