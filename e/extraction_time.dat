Immortalized human gingival fibroblast- 1 HGF- 1 (ATCC CRL- 2014) were incubated. Root canal sealers were then placed into sterile, cylindrical Teflon moulds.

40|$|Low {{environmental}} impact and high efficiency in chemical processing and manufacturing can be attained {{with the use}} of “light” instead of conductive heating. At microwave (MW) frequencies (300 MHz– 300 GHz), the electromagnetic field can be dissipated by matter in the form of heat via polarization mechanisms, magnetic interactions, and ionic conduction. The conversion is extremely rapid, and heat is volumetrically diffused into the solvents, leading to an incredibly fast temperature increase that can speed up extraction processes in a way no other technique can match. In closed systems, microwave-assisted extraction can be performed at higher temperatures, and <b>extraction</b> <b>times</b> can be reduced drastically. In fact, enhanced plant matrix swelling increases the diffusion rate and promotes faster extraction kinetics. However, the user must take into account that the temperature distribution in a solvent exposed to microwave radiation is strictly dependent on the electromagnetic field distribution in the reactor, on the dielectric properties of the material, and on the presence of mass transport phenomena such as natural convection and stirring. Shorter <b>extraction</b> <b>times</b> and shorter cooling times usually avoid material degradation and afford high-quality extracts...|$|R

Coffee decaffeination is an area in which there has been a notable commercialization of supercritical CO 2 extraction technology. In the past, a methylene chloride extraction process had been used. Methylene chloride is used to extract the caffeine from the coffee beans by continuously circulating the solvent. Typical <b>extraction</b> <b>times</b> range from 24 to 36 hours. Then the solvent must be stripped from the beans by another process that takes from one to eight hours. The major disadvantage of the methylene chloride process is that it is toxic, and a residue is often left on the beans. Extraction processes that use supercritical CO 2 leave no such residue. Also, supercritical CO 2 is selective exclusively for the caffeine. It does not extract any of the flavor material in the coffee, unlike methylene chloride. Also there is no associated waste treatment of a toxic solvent, and <b>extraction</b> <b>times</b> are generally lower.

5000|$|The {{basic premise}} is that as {{individual}} organisms (especially bacteria and fungi) die, phospholipids are rapidly degraded and the remaining phospholipid content of the sample {{is assumed to be}} from living organisms. As the phospholipids of different groups of bacteria and fungi contain a variety of somewhat unusual fatty acids, they can serve as useful biomarkers for such groups. PLFA profiles and composition can be determined by purifying the phospholipids and then cleaving the fatty acids for further analysis. Knowledge of the composition and metabolic activity of the microbiota in soils, water and waste materials is useful in optimizing crop production, in bioremediation and in understanding microbial ecosystems. Soil microbial community analysis by PLFA has been a widely used technique due to the sensitive, reproducible measurement of the dominant portions of the soil microbiota and the fact that PLFA does not require cultivation of the organisms. [...] Sampling of soil populations by culturing has proven not cost effective and results in biased results due to the differing ease of culturing of some organisms. The main drawback of PLFA has been that the <b>extraction</b> <b>time</b> is very long and cumbersome. A new 96-well plate PLFA extraction procedure has been developed which represents a 4-to-5 fold increase in throughput over traditional PLFA extraction methods. This new method, coupled to new software tools for analyzing the PLFA data, will be useful to laboratories performing large numbers of PLFA analyses, or for laboratories wanting to begin PLFA research.|$|E

Extraction of oil from flakes agreed with Fick 2 ̆ 7 s second law of diffusion for short <b>extraction</b> <b>times,</b> but deviated significantly from the standard diffusion behavior at long times. ^ In spite of its apparent complexity, the solvent extraction of oil from flaked oilseeds {{appears to be a}} linear diffusion process and the diffusivity appears to be independent of oil concentration. This is supported by the following experimental results for soybean flakes: (a) Normalized extraction curves were independent of both oil content in the solid and initial concentration of oil in the extracting solvent; (b) Infusion and extraction occurred at the same rate; (c) Normalized extraction curves for unextracted and previously extracted flakes reinfused with refined oil were virtually identical; and (d) <b>Extraction</b> <b>times</b> for different solvents were inversely proportional to liquid diffusivities of the oil-solvent pairs. ^ Analytical solutions of Fick 2 ̆ 7 s second law are presented for batch and differential extraction of slabs and spheres, which account for both internal and external mass transfer resistances. These solutions correlate alumina sphere extraction data well. ^ Soybean flake extraction data were well correlated by two mathematical models. One of these treats the extraction curve as the sum of two or more independent diffusive contributions. The other is a one-parameter empirical model. For short <b>extraction</b> <b>times,</b> experimental data are well correlated by available short-time solutions of the diffusion equation, subject to appropriate initial and boundary conditions. ^ Experimental results for multistage batch extraction of soybean flakes agreed very well with those predicted from superposition of single-stage extraction data by means of Duhamel 2 ̆ 7 s theorem. ^ Structural non-uniformity appeared to be the most probable reason for the observed extraction behavior of flaked oilseeds. Other hypotheses have been ruled out based on experimental evidence, including: decreased solubility of the last portions of extracted oil; slow dissolution of oil in the extracting solvent; interaction of oil or solvent with the solid; and concentration-dependent diffusivity. ...|$|R
