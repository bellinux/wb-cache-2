[...] In 1848, Thomas and his father joined the Navy Band, but in 1849 his father ceased to support him, and he set out on his own.

During this time Thomas served as his own manager, ticket sales, and press agent. He reached as far south as Mississippi. [...] Thomas returned to New York in 1850, with the intent of returning to Germany for advanced musical education; instead, he began his studies conducting in New York with Karl Eckert and Louis Antoine Jullien. He became first violin in the orchestra that accompanied Jenny Lind in that year, Henrietta Sontag in 1852, and Giulia Grisi and Giuseppe Mario in 1854.

40|$|In {{the eastern}} half of the United States, below the limit of glaciation, bedrock geology {{accounts}} for a significant amount of the variation seen in indoor radon. Various geologic parameters as well as soil radon and surface gamma radiation have been compared with thousands of indoor radon measurements and regression analyses indicate high positive correlations (R>S to. 9). In this part of the U. S., bedrock geologic models for indoor radon can be used successfully for prediction. Across the northern tier of states that have been subject to glaciation, the correlation of bedrock geology to indoor radon is obscured or is positive in only certain situations. In glaciated areas of the country, the type, composition, thickness, and permeability of glacial deposits play major roles in controlling radon sources in the soil.
