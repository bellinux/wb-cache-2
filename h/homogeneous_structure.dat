50|$|In a homoiconic language, {{the primary}} {{representation}} of programs {{is also a}} data structure in a primitive type of the language itself.

50|$|During {{spraying}} it {{is essential}} to maintain a constant top surface temperature and hence maintain steady-state conditions if a billet with consistent microstructure is to be produced. At the billet surface, during spraying an enthalpy balance must be maintained where the rate of enthalpy lost (Hout) from the billet by conduction to the atomising gas and through the substrate, convection and radiation must be balanced with the rate of enthalpy input (Hin) from the droplets in the spray. There are a variety of factors that can be adjusted in order to maintain these conditions: spray height, atomiser gas pressure, melt flow rate, melt superheat and atomiser configuration, being those parameters most readily adjusted. Typically equipment such as closed circuit cameras and optical pyrometry can be used to monitor billet size/position and top surface temperature. If Hout is much greater Hin then a steady temperature is maintained at the billet top surface. The top surface should be in a mushy condition in order to promote sticking of incoming droplets and partial re-melting of solid particles. The necessary partial re-melting of solid droplets explains the absence of dendritic remnants from pre-solidified droplets in the final microstructure. If Hin is insufficient to cause significant re-melting, a ‘splat’ microstructure of layered droplets will form, typical of thermal spray processes such as vacuum plasma spraying (VPS), arc spraying and high velocity oxy-fuel. Processing maps have been produced for plasma spraying and spray forming using a steady-state heat balance in terms of the interlayer time (time between deposition events) against average deposition rate per unit area. These maps show the boundaries between banded un-fused microstructure and an equiaxed <b>homogeneous</b> <b>structure.</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} simplified J-estimation equations for defective homogeneous {{and strength}} mismatched structures, {{based on the}} engineering treatment model (ETM). For <b>homogeneous</b> <b>structures,</b> two modifications are made to the existing ETM J-estimation equations; firstly a modification of the contained yielding solutions, and secondly modification of J-estimation equations for materials exhibiting Lueders strain. Based on the proposed J-estimation equations for <b>homogeneous</b> <b>structures,</b> J-estimation equations for welded structures with strength mismatch are proposed. The proposed J-estimation equations for both <b>homogeneous</b> and mismatched <b>structures</b> are then compared with selected elastic-plastic finite element results.
