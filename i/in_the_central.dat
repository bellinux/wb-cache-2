5|$|Between February 17 and February 19, 1975, North Vietnamese field commanders <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Central</b> Highlands Front held {{a conference}} {{to plan for}} their {{upcoming}} offensive. In order to plan their combat strategy, North Vietnamese commanders assessed the potential obstacles faced by the Vietnam People’s Army {{and the strength of}} the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Central</b> Highlands. Following extensive discussions, North Vietnamese commanders concluded that the South Vietnamese army <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Central</b> Highlands could mobilise about 5–7 regiment-sized units to counter the upcoming offensive. In the worst-case scenario, if South Vietnamese units were not tied up elsewhere, North Vietnamese commanders thought that South Vietnam could probably mobilise between nine and twelve regiments. North Vietnamese commanders believed South Vietnam could deploy about one or two armoured brigades, three to five battalions of artillery, and 80 aircraft per day to support the army. The North Vietnamese commanders within the Central Highlands Front discussed the possibility of the United States re-entering the conflict, which they believed would see the commitment of about 100 fighter-bombers from the United States Seventh Fleet.|$|E
