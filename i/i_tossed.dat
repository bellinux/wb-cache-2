He writes, [...] "I {{began to}} exude some kind of masculinity, in the way <b>I</b> <b>tossed</b> up and caught my eraser, for instance." [...] In another incident, Cal discusses how his penchants were masculine. While his female classmates are {{turned off by the}} blood in the Iliad, Cal is [...] "thrilled to [...] the stabbings and beheadings, the gouging out of eyes, the juicy eviscerations." [...] Cal ponders his gender identity and how males and females associate with each other, reflecting, [...] "Did I see through the male tricks because I was destined to scheme that way myself? Or do girls see through the tricks, too, and just pretend not to notice?" ...|$|E
60|$|All my gloom had {{returned}} {{by the time}} I was in bed. Hours seemed to pass while <b>I</b> <b>tossed</b> restlessly aching for sleep.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>tossed</b> the cheque {{across the}} table to him. [...] "Do you believe in THAT part of her ladyship's letter?" [...] I said, indignantly.|$|E

6000|$|... "Inimies {{would be}} truer," [...] {{returned}} Deerslayer, [...] "but sound isn't sense, and does little harm. Here {{is one of}} the images; <b>I</b> <b>toss</b> it to you under faith of treaties. If it's not returned, the rifle will settle the p'int atween us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thanks, signor," [...] replied Beatrice, {{with her}} rich voice, that came forth {{as it were}} like a gush of music, and with a mirthful {{expression}} half childish and half woman-like. [...] "I accept your gift, and would fain recompense it with this precious purple flower; but if <b>I</b> <b>toss</b> it into the air it will not reach you. So Signor Guasconti must even content himself with my thanks." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was a quiet}} {{moonlight}} night, but <b>I</b> <b>tossed</b> restlessly {{and could}} not sleep. At {{five in the morning}} I dressed and abandoned my bed.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>tossed</b> {{the paper}} {{down upon the}} table, {{but at that moment}} my eye caught an {{advertisement}} in the agony column. It ran in this way: ...|$|E
60|$|Accepting this as {{a mandate}} to go on, I {{returned}} to my room in the University Club and went to bed, but not to sleep. For hours <b>I</b> <b>tossed</b> and turned in self-questioning, self-accusing fury.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, <b>I</b> jest <b>tossed</b> it to him--when I--sort of j'ined in {{with the}} argyment. We was tusslin' some an' I didn't want no gun." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Since it {{has been}} heard that the {{carpenter}} had persuaded thee, [...] My sleep is disturbed--busy is foolishness within me at [...] midnight. [...] The kindness that has been between us, I cannot shake off that [...] memory in visions; [...] Thou callest me not to thy side; but love is {{to me for a}} [...] messenger. [...] THERE IS STRIFE WITHIN ME, AND <b>I</b> <b>TOSS</b> TO BE AT LIBERTY; [...] AND EVER THE CLOSER IT CLINGS, AND THE DELUSION IS GROWING TO [...] ME AS A TREE.|$|R
60|$|Then my two selves joined, and it {{was only}} I (half crazed, devil-driven <b>I)</b> that <b>tossed</b> in my bed, tracing step by step the history of the past month.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have a good}} memory," [...] I commented drily, as I essayed {{a moment}} to drape my {{shoulders}} with the new sable cloak ere <b>I</b> <b>tossed</b> it to Pons to put aside. He shook his head sourly.|$|E
60|$|In {{answer to}} the growl <b>I</b> <b>tossed</b> my head, and {{sheathing}} my sword I flung the bloodstained kerchief into their very midst. The audacity of the gesture left them breathless, and they growled no more, but stared.|$|E
6000|$|... "A--a {{little of}} both, {{and more of}} the first than the second," [...] he confessed. [...] "At the time I suppose I was madly exultant; then {{afterwards}} came the shame, and <b>I</b> <b>tossed</b> awake half the night." ...|$|E
6000|$|Knowles {{has brought}} this book before me, and being {{as strong as}} it [...] is strange, it cannot perish still-born. <b>I</b> am <b>tossed</b> about with [...] doubt as to writing upon it.|$|R
6000|$|... "All right, I'll {{have a look}} at him afterward," [...] <b>I</b> said, <b>tossing</b> {{my paper}} {{carelessly}} aside, and pouring myself out a cup of coffee. [...] "Nothing else to report, I suppose, warder?" ...|$|R
60|$|Thus I mused, {{and thus}} <b>I</b> questioned, <b>tossing</b> and turning on my inhospitable hard bed, until merciful sleep laid her quieting {{hands on the}} strings of my brain, and hushed their weary jangling.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>tossed</b> {{the article}} over. He {{looked at it}} and then at me. Clearly he was mad enough to [...] "chew me up." [...] Bidding him a mocking good night, I ran down the steps and hurried away.|$|E
60|$|So fell night once more, {{and made}} all dim. And only the cold {{light of the}} {{firmament}} lit thoughts in me restless as the sea on which <b>I</b> <b>tossed,</b> whose moon was dark, yet walked in heaven beneath the distant stars.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Save him! Ah, daughter, <b>I</b> <b>tossed</b> {{all night}} long {{thinking}} how to save him, so strong, so noble, so firm, so patient, so good even {{to the old man}} who has destroyed his hope--his life! Ah! I have thought till my brain whirls.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Allan's memory {{reverted to}} the half-crown {{that he had}} spun on the cabin-table of the yacht, at Castletown. [...] "If she only knew that <b>I</b> had <b>tossed</b> up for it!" [...] he thought, guiltily.|$|R
60|$|And <b>I</b> do <b>toss</b> {{through the}} troubled night for you, Dreaming your yielded mouth {{is given to}} mine, Feeling your strong breast carry me on into The peace where sleep is {{stronger}} even than wine.|$|R
6000|$|Finding that Holmes was too absorbed for {{conversation}} <b>I</b> had <b>tossed</b> aside the barren paper, and {{leaning back in}} my chair I fell into a brown study. Suddenly my companion's voice broke in upon my thoughts: ...|$|R
60|$|Then <b>I</b> <b>tossed</b> him peanuts, {{throwing}} them first far away, then nearer and nearer till {{he would come}} to my window-sill. And when I woke one morning he was sitting there looking in at the window, waiting for me to get up and bring his breakfast.|$|E
6000|$|... "Strayed amid lonely islets, mazed amid outer keys, [...] I waked {{the palms}} to {{laughter}} -- <b>I</b> <b>tossed</b> the scud {{in the breeze}} -- [...] Never was isle so little, never was sea so lone, [...] But over the scud and the palm-trees an English flag was flown.|$|E
6000|$|... "Gentlemen," [...] said I, [...] "I don't say anything--I haven't been around, you know, and {{of course}} don't know anything--but all I ask of you is to cast your eye on that, for instance, {{and tell me what}} you think of it!"

6000|$|But oh, the English {{comfort of}} those beds! How did Lankin manage in his, with his great long legs? How did <b>I</b> <b>toss</b> and tumble in mine; which, small as it was, I was not destined to enjoy alone, but {{to pass the}} night in company with anthropophagous wretched reptiles, who took their horrid meal off an English Christian! I thought the morning would never come; and when the tardy dawn at length arrived, and as I was in my first sleep, dreaming of Miss Fanny, behold I was wakened up by the Serjeant, already dressed and shaven, and who said, [...] "Rise, Titmarsh, the steamer will be here in three-quarters of an hour." [...] And the modest gentleman retired, and left me to dress.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> have <b>tossed,</b> and {{the lagoon}} has won. This almost makes one {{wish that the}} gulch or the cake or Tink's leaf had won. Of course I could do it again, and make it best out of three; however, perhaps fairest {{to stick to the}} lagoon.|$|R
6000|$|... "There is {{the woman}} you have so foully wronged, and so foully swindled," [...] said the Duke, {{watching}} him. [...] "What reparation will you make to her? What reparation can you make? <b>I</b> can <b>toss</b> your filthy head into her lap. But will that repair the wrong?" ...|$|R
60|$|Straight {{down the}} water front we boomed, Charley edging in till {{a man could}} almost leap ashore. When he gave the signal <b>I</b> <b>tossed</b> the marlinspike. It struck the {{planking}} of the wharf a resounding smash, bounced along fifteen or twenty feet, and was pounced upon by the amazed onlookers.|$|E
6000|$|Flinging {{the blanket}} {{over her and}} {{smoothing}} it carefully, <b>I</b> <b>tossed</b> the light saddle to her back and cinched it tight, so tight that she grunted.

60|$|That night, {{like the}} nights before, <b>I</b> <b>tossed</b> {{and turned on}} my bed incessantly. The pain in my leg had come back once more. It was long before I dropped asleep by degrees.

6000|$|... 'Now, Mr. Smith,' {{said the}} lady imperatively, coming downstairs, and {{appearing}} in her riding-habit, {{as she always}} did in a change of dress, like a new edition of a delightful volume, 'you have a task to perform to-day. These earrings are my very favourite darling ones; but the worst of it is that they have such short hooks that they are liable to be dropped if <b>I</b> <b>toss</b> my head about much, and when I am riding I can't give my mind to them. It would be doing me knight service if you keep your eyes fixed upon them, and remember them every minute of the day, and tell me directly I drop one. They have had such hairbreadth escapes, haven't they, Unity?' she continued to the parlour-maid who was standing at the door.|$|R
50|$|Was {{there ever}} chummies, now, such {{as you and}} <b>I,</b> Jack?:Long we've <b>tossed</b> on the rolling main, now we're safe ashore, Jack.|$|R
6000|$|... "You see, I am now hungry," [...] I said still gently. [...] "To-morrow morning I {{shall be}} hungrier.

Now {{if you will}} give me something to eat, I'll be in great shape for those bricks." ...|$|R
