25|$|Moore's winning bicycle is in Ely City Museum in Cambridgeshire. It has a {{diamond-shaped}} iron <b>downtube</b> and a {{top tube}} and tyres of flattened metal. The rest is wood, including the wheels. The back wheel has a diameter of 31inches, the front 38inches. The gearing is 1:1 (the pedals connected to the front hub), so the gear is low. The machine's saddle perished and disappeared before the bicycle returned to Britain.|$|E
25|$|The {{essential}} {{differences between}} a traditional cask and a keg {{are that the}} latter has a centrally located <b>downtube</b> and a valve that allows beer in and gas out when filling and vice versa when beer is dispensed. Also kegs have a simple concave bottom whilst the barrel or cask design allows sediment to be retained in the cask. This aspect of keg design means that all the beer in the keg is dispensed, which therefore requires that the beer be processed by filtration, fining or centrifuging, {{or some combination of}} these, to prevent sediment formation. Lastly, kegs have straight sides unlike the traditional barrel or cask shape. In order to get the beer out of a keg and into a customer's glass, it can be forced out with gas pressure, although if air or gas at low pressure is admitted {{to the top of the}} keg it can also be dispensed using a traditional hand pump at the bar.|$|E

5000|$|The Hildebrand & Wolfmüller patent of 20 January 1894, No. 78553 {{describes}} a [...] two-cylinder, four-stroke engine, with a {{bore and stroke}} of 90 x 117 mm. It produced [...] @ 240 rpm propelling a weight of 50 kg up to a maximum speed of 45 km/h.The fuel-air mixture from the surface carburettor was regulated by a valve operated by controls on the handlebar. The engine, which was positioned flat in the frame, used hot tube ignition with the tube heater {{in front of the}} cylinder heads. The tube heater was ventilated by the lower <b>downtubes</b> while the upper <b>downtubes</b> held lubricating oil.|$|R
25|$|Other {{materials}} besides carbon fiber, such as metallic boron, can {{be added}} to the matrix to enhance stiffness further. Some newer high end frames are incorporating Kevlar fibers into the carbon weaves to improve vibration damping and impact strength, particularly in <b>downtubes</b> and seat- and chainstays.|$|R
5000|$|Stressed member engines were pioneered {{at least}} {{as early as the}} 1916 Harley-Davidson 8-valve racer, and {{incorporated}} in the production Harley-Davidson Model W by 1919. This was called a keystone, or diamond, frame. The 1946 Vincent Series B Rapide was designed with an advanced chassis, termed a [...] "tour de force for its day," [...] that included a stressed member engine. During early testing of the 1983 Kawasaki GPZ900R, twin <b>downtubes</b> were included, creating a full cradle, but the <b>downtubes</b> were found to carry little load, so they were removed, relying entirely on the combination of the steel backbone and engine for chassis rigidity. BMW's R1100 series twins of 1994 relieved the frame of stress entirely, with the engine carrying the total load from the front Telelever fork to the rear Monolever.|$|R
2500|$|Yamaha began {{competing}} internationally in 1956 {{when they}} entered the Catalina Grand Prix, again with the YA-1, at which they placed sixth. [...] The YA-1 {{was followed by the}} YA-2 of 1957, another 125cc two stroke, but with significantly improved frame and suspension. [...] The YD-1 of 1957 was a 250cc two-stroke twin cylinder motorcycle, resembling the YA-2, but with a larger and more powerful motor. [...] A performance version of this bike, the YDS-1 housed the 250cc two-stroke twin in a double <b>downtube</b> cradle frame and offered the first five-speed transmission in a Japanese motorcycle. [...] This period also saw Yamaha offer its first outboard marine engine.|$|E
2500|$|Pierre Michaux's son Ernest is {{credited}} by L. J. K. Setright and David Burgess-Wise as having first fitted the Perreaux patented engine to the velocipede, while Charles M. Falco {{says it was}} Louis-Guillaume Perreaux. The Michaux-Perreaux machine was constructed using the first commercially successful pedal bicycle, a boneshaker which Michaux had been building over 400 of annually since 1863, and the single cylinder alcohol fueled Perreaux engine, which used twin flexible leather belt drives to the rear wheel. A steam pressure gauge was mounted in the rider's view above the front wheel, and steam to the cylinder was engaged and regulated with a hand control. The base Michaux velocipede came with a spoon brake but the steam version had no brakes. The engine weighed , and the total weight of the steam velocipede was [...] A 14 June 1871 addition to Perreaux's patent included {{the removal of the}} cranks and pedals from the front wheel, and using an arched instead of straight <b>downtube</b> to allow space for the engine. Although the steam velocipede was functional, it did not have any commercial successors.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the risk of noise induced hearing loss (NIHL) in {{shearing}} and investigate practi-cable control methods. Woolshed surveys included shed construction data, noise dosimetry and area noise sampling. The noise exposures from 40 personal measurements were all above the 85 dB(A) action level, lying in the range 86 - 90 dB(A). Shearers had the highest exposure, “near field ” noise coming from the action of the cutting edge in the shearing comb, but also from <b>downtubes</b> and gears. Noise for sorters and pressers was contributed to by the stereo system (found in all shearing sheds). Lined sheds seemed to have slightly higher noise levels than unlined sheds. None of the shearing crews had hearing protection available. Redesign of the shearing equipment primarily the hand-piece but also the <b>downtubes</b> and gears could potentially reduce the exposure by 2 - 3 dB(A) and possibly more. In the meantime shearing crews need to wear hearing protection and be subject to audiometric surveillance...|$|R
50|$|Later {{models were}} {{fitted with a}} bashplate between the lower frame <b>downtubes</b> (by frame number TB879). The bashplate was dual purpose: to stop dirt {{entering}} the air filter, and also to protect the carburettor from damage. Even later models (by frame number TB1029) were fitted with a further small light steel plate shielding the carburettor float bowl and fitted under {{the heads of the}} front two engine mounting bolts.|$|R
50|$|The {{front engine}} mounts on the K75 frame are placed further back {{than in the}} K100 frame and the <b>downtubes</b> are at a {{different}} angle; otherwise the frames are identical. The K75 had the same wheelbase, seat height, and steering geometry as the K100. According to BMW, 80 percent of the K75's parts are interchangeable with the K100's. The K75's radiator and fuel tank were smaller than those on the K100.|$|R
50|$|Quintana Roo SHIFT {{technology}} is the diverting of air away from the dirty (drive) side of the bike towards the clean (non-drive) side of the bike. The non-drive side of the <b>downtube</b> is offset towards the drive side, thus directing airflow away from the drag-heavy drivetrain components. By creating an offset <b>downtube,</b> airflow off the back edge of the front wheel is free to flow {{along the side of}} the <b>downtube,</b> instead of crashing against it, as with a traditional <b>downtube.</b> This results in a more balanced drag curve, which leads to increased stability in crosswinds and headwinds.|$|E
50|$|Frame: Single <b>downtube</b> frame.|$|E
50|$|STI and ErgoPower {{have largely}} {{displaced}} <b>downtube</b> shifting, {{even though some}} cyclists still use <b>downtube</b> shifters for various reasons, including less expense, less weight, more flexibility, and better reliability. A compromise is to use bar-end shifters or Barcons. This type places the shifters closer to the hand positions, but still offer a simple reliable system, especially for touring cyclist. Drawbacks to STI and ErgoPower systems include the higher weight and the higher price. There are many more parts in an STI or ErgoPower lever than in a <b>downtube</b> system.|$|E
50|$|In the (very limited) {{production}} application the water-cooled engine {{retained the}} vertical cylinder but placed the crank driven supercharger piston and its cylinder under the crankcases. The radiator was mounted between the twin <b>downtubes</b> of the plunger suspended {{double cradle frame}} and drive {{was taken to the}} four speed gearbox via a chain primary drive and dry multidisc clutch. Girder forks equipped the front end and were fitted with a full width hub as was the rear wheel.|$|R
5000|$|Although Dunstall's open-class racers (non production-race category) were {{equipped}} with lowboy frames {{based on the}} works design which Dunstall had acquired during the Norton factory race-shop closure, this re-design {{was based on an}} established concept not yet applied to the Norton twin for road racing. With no front <b>downtube(s)</b> hence no conventional engine mountings, the spine frame needed substantial cantilever bracing from the central-point of the frame forwards under the gearbox and engine to control the torque reaction ...|$|R
50|$|Engineers paid {{particular}} attention to engine cooling, {{in order to make}} the radiator and its hoses as inconspicuous as possible, yet still function effectively. This was achieved by running the top radiator hose underneath a valve cover, and by situating a thin radiator between the <b>downtubes</b> of the double-cradle frame. The Fury was given a five-speed transmission and a shaft-drive system similar to its VTX predecessors, but the shaft was enclosed by an aluminum swingarm assembly unique to the Fury.|$|R

50|$|The SR400 has an {{air-cooled}} 4-stroke {{single cylinder}} SOHC 2-valve engine with a dry-sump — with the <b>downtubes</b> of the motorcycle's frame {{serving as the}} engine's oil reservoir and cooling system — thereby {{eliminating the need for}} an external oil cooler, reducing engine pumping losses, and allowing increased ground clearance as well as reduced overall width. The bike's semi-double cradle frame uses high-strength steel. The SR400 had a kick-starter and no electric start. To aid with starting, the bike had a sight glass {{on the right side of}} the cylinder head indicating the optimal cylinder position for starting, as well as a decompressor lever on the left handlebar.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] Victory engine carries [...] {{of oil in}} the sump, {{about the}} same as most automobiles. This is {{intended}} to minimize risk of low-oil damage, but also makes it dimensionally larger than other motorcycle engines, such as Harley-Davidson, which carry the oil in an external tank. Top speed is about 120 mph at 5,500 rpm; the ECM contains a rev limiter which can be overridden by reprogramming the EPROM. The Victory engine is air-cooled, and also circulates crankcase oil through a cooler mounted between the front frame <b>downtubes.</b> A section of the rear swingarm can be removed to change the drive belt or the rear wheel.|$|R
50|$|The DragStar {{began as}} the XVS650 in 1997 in Europe (400 version {{available}} in Japan since 1996), and grew in 1999 {{to include the}} XVS1100 Custom. The 1100 used a reworked version of the venerable Virago 75-degree, air-cooled v-twin engine which had been in use since the early 1980s. The Star version offered better torque for the new midsize cruiser bike. The Star carried over the shaft-drive layout from the Virago, but relied on a new suspension and frame, discarding the outboard dual shocks and stressed-member engine arrangement of the Virago {{in favor of a}} single-shock and twin <b>downtubes.</b> Dual Mikuni 37 mm carburetors with throttle-position sensors are used to efficiently meter fuel to the 8.3:1, oversquare engine.|$|R

50|$|In January Velocite accused Cicli Pinarello {{of taking}} the {{patented}} and copyrighted original research performed by Velocite dealing with integration of a round water bottle into the airflow through use of a concave <b>downtube.</b> Velocite developed the aerodynamic solution during 2014 and launched the Velocite Syn aero road bike featuring the concave <b>downtube</b> at the 2015 Taipei Cycle Show. Pinarello released the Bolide TT bicycle featuring the concave <b>downtube</b> over a year later in May 2016 and a Dogma F10 bicycle in January 2017. The Dogma F10 marketing information also makes use of the Velocite Syn wind tunnel data. At the time of launch of the Dogma F10, Pinarello did not present any wind tunnel, or simulation results data that indicates independent work. Pinarello is disputing the rights of Velocite to the aerodynamically functional concave <b>downtube</b> design and associated airflow data and are insisting {{that they have the}} right to incorporate the design into their bicycle designs and use the data in their marketing materials.|$|E
50|$|The {{motorcycle}} {{engine is}} held in a double cradle with asingle spine and single <b>downtube.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The R32 had a {{tubular steel}} frame with twin <b>downtubes</b> that {{continued}} under {{the engine to}} the rear wheel. [...] The front fork had a trailing link design suspended by a leaf spring, similar to the forks used by Indian at the time. [...] The rear wheel was rigidly mounted. In the original First Series, Braking was accomplished solely with a [...] "dummy rim" [...] on the rear wheel with two padded brake shoes set within it. One would be operated by the, now traditional, right hand lever and the other by use of a heel actuated lever on the right side. Later years would reroute the front right lever and cable to a front drum brake.|$|R
50|$|The {{result was}} a {{water-cooled}} version with barrels and cylinder heads cast in pairs, and fitted with enclosed valves. All exhaust ports now faced rearwards. Initially a thermo siphon design with a radiator {{on each side of}} the front frame <b>downtubes,</b> an impeller type water pump was soon added to the left side of the crankshaft to further aid cooling. Supercharger boost was reduced to 6 psi. Instead of the previous pressure lubrication, oil was now added to the fuel. The new duplex frame had integral rear plunger suspension housings, and the Webb-type girder forks were now graced with a deep finned alloy 8 in TLS front brake. The bike used a 21 in front tyre, and a 19 in rear. It had a six imperial gallon fuel tank.|$|R
5000|$|Technical {{advances}} included {{water cooling}} and 16 valves, allowing additional power, and a frame that used the engine as a stressed member for improved handling and reduced weight, {{as a result}} of testing that showed that the standard <b>downtubes</b> carried virtually no weight and could be eliminated. Its top speed gave it the title of the fastest production bike at the time, and standing quarter mile times of 10.976 seconds, or 10.55 seconds recorded by specialist rider Jay [...] "Pee Wee" [...] Gleason. The 1984 GPZ900R was the first Kawasaki bike to be officially marketed (in North America) under the Ninja brand name.In spite of its performance, the GPZ900R was smooth and ridable in urban traffic, owing to the new suspension and a crankshaft counter-balancer to nearly eliminated secondary vibration. The fairing's aerodynamics combined with good overall ergonomics to make comfortable long-distance riding possible.|$|R

5000|$|In 1996, GT won the {{commission}} to manufacture a highly aerodynamic bike design that would later {{become known as the}} [...] "Superbike," [...] hailed at the time [...] "as the best on the planet" [...] and later banned by Olympic regulations for being [...] "too fast." [...] A byproduct of a year-long development program with the U.S. national team known as Project '96, the bike featured a carbon graphite frame with no top tube, extremely thin seat and <b>downtubes,</b> a seat tube with a deep cutout to accommodate the rear wheel, as well as differently sized aerodynamic wheels. Describing the bike, the U. S. Cycling Federation's track endurance coach Craig Griffin said [...] "it's so thin and light, and it's as strong as anything built. It's so aerodynamic {{that when you look at}} it from the front, it disappears." [...] Controversially, just prior to the 96 Summer Olympics, Rebecca Twigg quit the team, citing her Superbike's ill fit as one of the reasons for departing.|$|R
5000|$|The Seagull {{outboard}} motor had a simple single cylinder water-cooled two-stroke engine. Atop {{the engine was}} a magneto, and on its port side was a simple carburetter with no air filter. Even a rudimentary rubber [...] "storm cowl" [...] was an optional extra, and induction noise when running was pronounced. Above the cylinder head was bolted a small brass fuel tank whose 10:1 fuel/oil mix was gravity-fed to the carb via a clear plastic tube that served to capture dirt particles in its U-bend. A simple plastic filter filter on the banjo union to the carb gave rudimentary secondary filtering, {{but it was still}} not unusual for the carb jets to become blocked. Starting was effected with a hand-wound pull-rope, although a recoil starter became an option in due course. Connecting the motor to the gearbox and propeller werere two <b>downtubes,</b> the forward one containing the drive shaft and the aft tube serving as the exhaust, which vented underwater. This arrangement meant that the engine could not be rotated 360 degrees as can more modern engines. The Seagull handbook advises that the engine can be safely run at full throttle (partly to prevent the spark-plug from oiling up) but adds that is wasteful to try to exceed the maximum design speed of a displacement hull, suggesting a [...] "one-third open throttle" [...] usually suffices. The engines proved very rugged as they used high quality materials, and would last for years even in harsh marine environments and in developing countries. Seagull outboards were utilitarian in nature with a relatively slow-turning prop, and so were ideal for use in dinghies, tenders and small yachts. The Silver Century Plus model could propel a displacement hull of up to 26 feet in length; but all Seagull outboards were unsuitable for high speed craft.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the most}} {{respected}} and pioneering BMX bicycle models is named after him: The P.K. Ripper manufactured by Scot Enterprises (SE) Racing. It {{was one of the first}} production BMX bicycles to be made from aluminum. It is a metal that was difficult to work with [...] bicycle frame construction and fragile if not manufactured correctly. As a result it was also more expensive than typical steel bicycles. The P.K. Ripper was one of the first aluminum framed BMX bicycles that was reliable and durable for racing and competitively priced. It was in many ways ahead of its time. The fact that it resembles a modern BMX bicycle is no accident; most modern BMX race bicycles are usually made from aluminum. Like the P.K., modern aluminum bicycle frames have oversized flattened <b>downtubes</b> and toptubes which was called on the Ripper (and a pioneering S.E. Racing BMX Cruiser) [...] "Floval" [...] by the founder of S.E. Racing Scot Breithaupt. Also, there is a pro cruiser by S.E. called the [...] "floval flyer," [...] a very unusual-looking bicycle at the time, as was the [...] "exotic" [...] material it was fabricated from. When introduced, most BMX bicycles were made from either hi-tensile steel or more expensive but stronger chromium-molybdenum steel. Chromium-molybdenum steel, commonly known as [...] "Chromoly", while more expensive than high-tensile steel, it was cheaper than aluminum, in part it was much easier to fabricate and more reliable in terms of durability than most other aluminum framed race bicycles on the market at the time. Aluminum, while significantly lighter and much less subject to corrosion than chromoly steel, is more brittle and less resilient than chromoly. The frame must be absolutely stiff or it is subject to failing abruptly, i.e. snapping in two suddenly. It will succumb from metal fatigue at a much faster rate, especially if it is subjected to flexing. This is why the tubes of an aluminum frame are both of a larger diameter and are thicker walled than chromoly tubes, to maintain stiffness. Further, aluminum is harder to weld. The welds have to be extra strong and [...] "double butted" [...] and thorough which gives the aluminum frame with its very obvious beaded welds an [...] "unfinished" [...] look, as if someone forgot to sand them down at the factory to give it the clean, almost one-piece look of a chromoly frame. As a result, the weight advantage of aluminum is reduced significantly, in addition to it higher fabrication cost. For these reasons, the Chromoly steel frame and fork was the standard of BMX racing and freestyle for twenty years. Only in the mid-1990s, as manufacturing advances - many pioneered in the construction of a mountain bike frame - made aluminum cheaper and easier to work with, did aluminum-framed race and freestyle bicycles begin to supplant chromoly. Today the aluminum BMX bicycle frame is the standard, and the modern iteration of the P. K. Ripper is still manufactured by SE (now called Sports Engineering) Racing.|$|R
