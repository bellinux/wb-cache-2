5|$|On 22 March 1990, Achebe {{was riding}} in a car to Lagos when an axle {{collapsed}} and the car flipped. His son Ikechukwu and the driver suffered minor injuries, but {{the weight of the}} vehicle fell on Achebe and his spine was severely damaged. He was flown to the Paddocks Hospital in Buckinghamshire, England, and treated for his injuries. In July doctors announced that although he was recuperating well, he was paralyzed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>waist</b> <b>down</b> and would require the use of a wheelchair {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|Both of Britain's {{athletes at}} the Games competed in alpine skiing events, {{funding for the}} two athletes was {{provided}} by the British Paralympic Association. Russell Docker, who was paralysed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>waist</b> <b>down</b> following a skiing accident in 1995, appeared at the Paralympics {{for the first time and}} competed in the LW12 classification. He crashed out in the downhill event and failed to complete his other three races. Stephen Napier, who was disabled after being knocked off a motorbike by an unmarked police car in 1995, also competed in four events in the LW10 classification. His highest finish was sixth in the Super-G and he also had three seventh-place finishes. In each of his events Napier was the lowest ranked athlete to complete the course.|$|E

50|$|Like {{the other}} Tripuri, the {{traditional}} dress of the Reang {{is simple and}} plain. Men traditionally wear a hand woven loin cloth {{and a piece of}} cloth as a wrapper for the upper body. The women wear a long cloth called Mnai, a wraparound; <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>waist</b> to <b>down</b> to <b>the</b> knees, a Rsa covering the chest, and Rikatouh for covering the whole upper half of the body. The fabric is usually woven by the Reang women and very colourful. However moderisation has caught up with the Bru and most urban Reang no longer wear their traditional costumes.|$|R
5|$|After the ISIS agents reunite and Drake's mutinous crew {{agrees to}} {{surrender}} {{in order to}} prevent his death, Drake has a mental breakdown, declaring humanity to be doomed and killing himself with Pam's rifle. Cyril, startled by the sudden gunfire, opens fire himself, killing three people (one of whom was the only capable pilot of the shuttle other than Drake). To worsen the situation, Barry Dylan (Dave Willis) challenges Archer to fight him in space. Despite the rigorous taunting and demeaning from Barry, Archer ultimately declines his offer. After Archer makes an act of humility, Cyril aims the launches at Barry's jet, subsequently stranding him on Horizon. As the group nears the airstrip, Archer, who wishes to take credit for the landing, messes with the steering shift, causing the spacecraft to crash. Afterwards, every ISIS agent except for Archer is shown to be injured as a result, especially Ray, who is now paralyzed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>waist</b> <b>down</b> (which he ironically had pretended to be earlier in the season).|$|E
5|$|With Fate and Other Worlds launched, Palmer {{began to}} plan for a new magazine, to be called Imagination. Material {{for the first two}} issues had been {{assembled}} by mid-1950, but in the early summer Palmer fell down his basement stairs and was left paralyzed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>waist</b> <b>down.</b> While he was hospitalized, much of the work of editing both Other Worlds and Imagination was done by Mahaffey, who coped well, despite her inexperience. An assistant, Marge Budwig Saunder, was hired to read the slush pile and help out. The magazine's first issue, dated October 1950 on a planned bi-monthly schedule, appeared on news stands 1 August 1950. However, in September that year, Ziff-Davis made the decision to move to New York from Chicago; Palmer promptly contacted William Hamling, {{who did not want to}} relocate and suggested that Hamling take over Imagination. Like Palmer, Hamling had made preparations to leave Ziff-Davis by establishing a separate publishing company, Greenleaf Publishing, and in November 1950 Hamling left Ziff-Davis and became Imaginations editor and publisher.|$|E
5|$|In 1256 Bulgaria {{descended into}} {{a civil war}} between Mitso Asen (r. 1256–1257), a {{relative}} of Ivan Asen II, who established himself in south-eastern Bulgaria, and the bolyar of Skopje Constantine Tikh (r. 1257–1277), who was proclaimed emperor by the nobility in Tarnovo. Simultaneously, the Hungarian noble of Rus' princely origin Rostislav Mikhailovich established himself in Vidin as another claimant of the title Emperor of Bulgaria and was recognized as such by the Kingdom of Hungary. By 1261 Constantine Tikh had emerged as victor, but his 20–year-long reign did not bring stability to Bulgaria: Vidin remained separated from the central authorities in Tarnovo, the Mongols regularly campaigned in north-eastern Bulgaria, looting the countryside and paralysing the economy. That same year Michael VIII Palaiologos (r. 1259–1282) seized Constantinople and restored the Byzantine Empire as a major adversary of Bulgaria to the south. In the 1260s Constantine Tikh broke his leg in a hunting incident and was paralysed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>waist</b> <b>down.</b> This disability weakened his control over the government and he fell {{under the influence of}} his second wife Irene Doukaina Laskarina, who was constantly involved in intrigues with her relatives in the Byzantine court. Later, he left the state affairs to his third wife, Maria Palaiologina Kantakouzene— a scandalous intriguer whose actions to secure the succession of her son alienated the nobility.|$|E
5000|$|On 16 February 2014, the {{day after}} the incident, Komissarova was moved to a Munich {{hospital}} where she underwent further surgery on 17 February. Komissarova said in an Instagram update at the end of February that she was paralyzed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>waist</b> and <b>down.</b> <b>The</b> Russian Freestyle Federation has called for donations to cover her medical costs. She hopes to recover, saying [...] "some day I will definitely be on my feet again". However, on 5 March, the opinion of her doctors was published stating she would never fully recover. £400,000 has been raised for her treatment.|$|R
5000|$|Like the chasuble, the phelonion was {{originally}} {{a sort of}} poncho, a round vestment {{with a hole in}} the middle for the head, which fell to the feet on all sides. In its present form (dating <b>from</b> about <b>the</b> fifteenth century) the front is largely cut away (<b>from</b> about <b>the</b> <b>waist</b> <b>down)</b> to facilitate <b>the</b> movements of the priest's hands. In Russia the longer front remained common until quite recent times. The use of the phelonion {{is not limited to the}} Divine Liturgy but is specified for any major liturgical function. It is also called phenolion ( [...] ; plural phenolia [...] ) in some books.|$|R
5000|$|The {{engine was}} the Ford 2.8 Cologne V6 with Bosch fuel {{injection}} producing [...] An automatic gearbox was available, {{making it the}} first TVR to have this as an option. While the styling of the car was by Oliver Winterbottom who had previously styled the Lotus Elite S2, it bears {{a striking resemblance to}} 1971 Ital Design concept car, the Alfa Romeo Caimano, <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>waist</b> rail <b>down</b> being mistakable for the same car. Beside the Cologne V6 engine the Tasmin was also available with a 2.0 litre Ford Pinto. This car, presented in late 1981, was called the Tasmin 200 and was an attempt to make a car cheaper than the standard Tasmin 280i. It was priced at under £10,000, but with an engine producing only about [...] it wasn't a big success. Only 16 Tasmin 200 coupes and 45 convertibles were made in total.|$|R
5|$|Before marriage, women {{used to wear}} a Kirgi (sari) and Baju (blouse). The Kirgi is a {{piece of}} cloth not longer than four feet, and about three feet wide. It was wrapped around the body <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>waist</b> <b>down.</b> A jacket with long sleeves called a Baju, was used to cover {{the upper part of the}} body. This dress was a sign of the bride's virginity and was worn during the Ros ceremony. The Kirgi was wrapped around the waist, but the end of the sari is not thrown over the shoulder. To wear the sari with its end thrown over the shoulder, known as Worl, is the {{exclusive}} right of a married woman. Married women used to wear sarees the general way. The Salwar kameez is another form of popular dress for females. The Mangalorean Catholic bride's wedding sari is known as a Sado. It is usually a red-coloured Banarasi sari which is made of finely woven silk and is decorated with elaborate engravings. In olden days, the bride wore on her head a red cloth, three feet square. Gold ornaments were absent in those days: the bride went to the church dressed as a virgin girl. In modern times, the bride wears (in place of the Kirgi) a red sari, but the end of the sari is not thrown over the shoulder; it is wrapped around the waist. The bride wears a few gold ornaments, some rings on the fingers, earrings, and at least two of the Dantoni (golden combs). Other ornaments worn by the bride in the olden days included Kanti, Chakrasar, Kap, Karap, Mugud, Kanto, and Dantoni.|$|E

50|$|Sarge is a tough-talking {{physical}} therapist who {{began working with}} Jack Abbott, who was paralyzed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>waist</b> on <b>down</b> after being shot by his mentally ill ex-wife Patty Williams. Jack at first clashed with Sarge when he spotted him aggressively coaching one of his female patients, which Sarge uses {{as a way of}} building their strength to encourage them to work harder on their recovery. Jack later understood this method which lead him to ask Sarge to help him with his recovery as his female therapist didn't give him much hope on recovering. On March 20, Sarge was seen sitting in on an AA meeting just as Harmony took a seat next to him after she finished speaking. Harmony and Sarge later formally introduced themselves when she ran into him at the coffeehouse and they engaged in conversation as she spoke about her battles, but she became angry when Sarge revealed that he's been in AA supporting a patient of his, making Harmony feel like a fool as she believed she was confiding in someone who had struggles of his own. Sarge and Harmony have later pretended to be a couple to make Neil Winters jealous, growing a friendship in the process. Although the two have attraction to one another, Sarge wishes Neil luck in ending up with Harmony. Sarge would eventually reveal to Jack the reason he became a {{physical therapist}}. When he was younger, Augustus was a street racer and got in a very bad crash with a brick wall; although he was okay, his brother wasn't. Although his brother refused his help to the very present, Sarge wanted to make sure everyone had the chance to fight.|$|R
