50|$|A <b>herringbone</b> <b>gear,</b> a {{specific}} type of double helical gear, is a special type of gear that is a side to side (not face to face) combination of two helical gears of opposite hands. From the top, each helical groove of this gear looks like the letter V, and many together form a herringbone pattern (resembling the bones of a fish such as a herring). Unlike helical gears, herringbone gears do not produce an additional axial load.|$|E
5000|$|Planetary gears {{have become}} popular in 3D {{printing}} {{for a few}} different reasons. Some people use them for the gearing ratio benefits and to get more accurate 3D prints, getting their layers of plastic down {{to just a few}} microns thick [...] This produces very high quality 3D prints. The largest use of 3D printed planetary gear systems is as toys for children. Since <b>herringbone</b> <b>gears</b> are easy to 3D print, it has become very popular to 3D print a moving <b>herringbone</b> planetary <b>gear</b> system for teaching children how gears work. An advantage of <b>herringbone</b> <b>gears</b> is that they don't fall out of the ring and don't need a mounting plate.|$|R

50|$|Precision <b>herringbone</b> <b>gears</b> {{are more}} {{difficult}} to manufacture than equivalent spur or helical gears and consequently are more expensive.They are used in heavy machinery.|$|R
50|$|Many {{variations}} exist, including; helical and <b>herringbone</b> <b>gear</b> sets (instead of spur gears), lobe shaped rotors {{similar to}} Roots blowers (commonly used as superchargers), and mechanical designs {{that allow the}} stacking of pumps. The most common variations are shown below (the drive gear is shown blue and the idler is shown purple).File:Gear pump.png| External gear pump design for hydraulic power applications.

50|$|A {{disadvantage}} of the <b>herringbone</b> <b>gear</b> {{is that it}} cannot be cut by simple gear hobbing machines, as the cutter would run into {{the other half of}} the gear. Solutions to this have included assembling small gears by stacking two helical gears together, cutting the gears with a central groove to provide clearance, and (particularly in the early days) by casting the gears to an accurate pattern and without further machining. With the older method of fabrication, herringbone gears had a central channel separating the two oppositely-angled courses of teeth. This was necessary to permit the shaving tool to run out of the groove. The development of the Sykes gear shaper made it possible to have continuous teeth with no central gap. Sunderland, also in England, also produced a herringbone cutting machine. The Sykes uses cylindrical guides and round cutters; the Sunderland uses straight guides and rack-type cutters. The W. E. Sykes Co. dissolved in 1983-84. Since then it has been common practice to obtain an older machine and rebuild it if necessary to create this unique type of gear. Recently, the Bourn and Koch company has developed a CNC-controlled derivation of the W. E. Sykes design called the HDS1600-300. This machine, like the Sykes gear shaper, has the ability to generate a true apex without the need for a clearance groove cut around the gear. This allows the gears to be used in positive displacement pumping applications, as well as power transmission. Helical gears with low weight, accuracy and strength may be 3D printed.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Planetary {{gear train}} (PGT) with {{herringbone}} gears {{is one of}} typical transmission styles used in marine power transmission. How to effectively design a PGT with lighter structures and lower vibration and noise is a fatal task for heavily loaded marine gearing. An analysis system which {{was developed in the}} past decades is introduced in this paper to simulate the performance of planetary <b>herringbone</b> <b>gear</b> trains. The effects of main crucial parameters on the static and dynamic characteristics of planetary <b>herringbone</b> <b>gear</b> trains are studied by using the analysis system. The results are discussed and show that the presented system is effective and can be used in design of planetary <b>herringbone</b> <b>gear</b> trains...|$|E
50|$|Like helical gears, {{they have}} the {{advantage}} of transferring power smoothly because more than two teeth will be in mesh at any moment in time. Their advantage over the helical gears is that the side-thrust of one half is balanced by that of the other half. This means that <b>herringbone</b> <b>gears</b> can be used in torque gearboxes without requiring a substantial thrust bearing. Because of this <b>herringbone</b> <b>gears</b> were an important step in the introduction of the steam turbine to marine propulsion.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Torque-spilt {{transmissions}} {{are promising}} {{alternatives to the}} common <b>herringbone</b> <b>gears</b> for power-branching. A method was developed to analyze the load-sharing in power-branching. With the theory of equivalent mesh error, in consideration of the manufacturing and assembly errors of every gear pair, the formula of uneven load coefficient are obtained by using the engineering calculation and simulation calculation two methods, and then the load-sharing behavior of system is studied under different operating conditions in power dual-branching and three-branching transmission. The calculated results confirmed that measures must be took to improve load-sharing, and it is helpful {{for the design of}} power-branching <b>herringbone</b> <b>gears</b> transmission system...|$|R
50|$|Double helical <b>gears</b> and <b>herringbone</b> <b>gears</b> are similar, but the {{difference}} is that <b>herringbone</b> <b>gears</b> do not have a groove in the middle like double helical gears do. Double helical gears overcome the problem of axial thrust presented by single helical gears by using two sets of teeth that are set in a V shape. A double helical gear {{can be thought of as}} two mirrored helical gears joined together. This arrangement cancels out the net axial thrust, since each half of the gear thrusts in the opposite direction, resulting in a net axial force of zero. This arrangement can remove the need for thrust bearings. However, double helical gears are more difficult to manufacture due to their more complicated shape.|$|R

In {{order to}} more {{accurately}} estimate the intrinsic mode of <b>herringbone</b> <b>gear</b> transmission box, fluid-structure interaction model of gear box and lubricants is established. Gear system natural frequencies and mode shapes is calculate {{out on the}} establishment of the fluid-solid coupling dynamics equations. The finite element models of gearbox and lubricating oil are build by ANSYS software, and the results of inherent characteristics are given. The top ten order natural frequency is distributed between 611. 8 HZ and 2487 HZ, and the first two order mode shape is respectively shown as the axial swing and horizontal swing. In order to verify the analysis results, the hammering method of single-input multiple-output (SIMO) is used to test gearbox structure modal. The results show that the mode shapes get from ANSYS analysis are consistent with the datas of experimental measurements, and the maximum deviation of natural frequency between experiment and theory is blew 15 %. So it can be shown the fluid-structure interaction model in this paper is effective and reasonable...|$|E
