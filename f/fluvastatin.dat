Twenty healthy male adult subjects were given <b>fluvastatin</b> ER tablet 80 [*]mg QD by oral administration or <b>fluvastatin</b> IR capsule 40 [*]mg BID for seven days. Blood samples were collected up to 24 hours after dosing on day 1 and day 7. Serum concentrations of <b>fluvastatin</b> were determined by LC-MS/MS. For <b>fluvastatin</b> ER tablet 80 [*]mg QD, max was 61. 0 ± 39. 0 and 63. 9 ± 29. 7 [*]ng/mL, and AUC 0 − 24 h was 242 ± 156 and 253 ± 91. 1 ng·h/mL on day 1 and 7, respectively.

40|$|AIMS: To {{investigate}} {{the effect on}} risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) of lipid lowering treatment with <b>fluvastatin</b> 80 mg/day after a first percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with stable and unstable angina. METHOD AND RESULTS: This prespecified subgroup analysis of the LIPS (Lescol intervention prevention study) analysed 1658 patients with documented diagnosis; 824 had unstable angina (417 randomly assigned to <b>fluvastatin,</b> 407 to placebo) and 834 had stable angina (including silent ischaemia; <b>fluvastatin,</b> 418; placebo, 416). Median follow up was 3. 9 years. There was no significant effect of anginal status on long term risk of MACE. <b>Fluvastatin</b> treatment reduced the risk of MACE by 28 % compared with placebo (p = 0. 03) among patients with unstable angina, with no difference between patients with stable and patients with unstable angina (relative risk 1. 07, 95 % confidence interval 0. 87 to 1. 30, p = 0. 53). <b>Fluvastatin</b> reduced coronary atherosclerotic events (MACE excluding restenosis) by 36 % (p = 0. 006) among patients with unstable angina and 31 % (p = 0. 02) among patients with stable angina. <b>Fluvastatin</b> caused similar reductions in total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations in both patient groups.

Antioxidant therapy may have a therapeutic potential toward interstitial fibrosis of unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) kidneys. <b>Fluvastatin</b> is an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor and has been demonstrated to have an antioxidant activity in vitro. MethodsThe effects of <b>fluvastatin</b> on UUO kidneys from the viewpoints of antioxidant action in vivo and antifibrosis action were studied. To investigate the antioxidant action and its therapeutic efficacy of <b>fluvastatin</b> in UUO kidneys, AGE accumulation and fibrosis in the obstructed kidneys was compared among vehicle-, pravastatin-, or fluvastatin-treated (10 or 40 mg/kg/day) groups.

Methods: A total of 80 patients with early diabetic nephropathy were randomly divided into diet group (n= 40) and <b>fluvastatin</b> group (n= 40), and 40 healthy people were regarded as control group. The two groups both received low protein diet, and the <b>fluvastatin</b> group was additionally given <b>fluvastatin.</b> The treatment time {{of the two groups}} was 2 months. The levels of inflammatory factors, MMP- 9, mAlb, Hcy and APN in the three groups before treatment, after treatment for 1 month, after treatment for 2 months were detected and compared, respectively. Results: Before treatment, the levels of hs-CRP, TNF-毩, mAlb, Hcy and MMP- 9 in diet and <b>fluvastatin</b> group were significantly higher while the level of APN was significantly lower than that in control group (P 0. 05), and there was significant difference of all indexes between diet and <b>fluvastatin</b> group (P 0. 05), while the level of mAlb decreased significantly than that before treatment and after treatment for 1 month in diet group (P< 0. 05), there were significant differences of the indexes (hs-CRP, TNF-毩, MMP- 9, Hcy and APN) between diet and <b>fluvastatin</b> group (P< 0. 05). Conclusions: Early diabetic nephropathy can lead to abnormal the levels of inflammatory factors, MMP- 9, mAlb, Hcy and APN, <b>fluvastatin</b> can significantly improve inflammatory factors and the levels of MMP- 9, mAlb, Hcy and APN in patients with early diabetic nephropathy...|$|E
40|$|Background: Bisphosphonates {{interfere}} with the mevalonate pathway and inhibit the prenylation of small GTP-binding proteins such as ras and rap. We hypothesized that zoledronic acid would synergistically inhibit T 24 bladder cancer cell growth in combination with <b>fluvastatin</b> and paclitaxel. Methods: Increasing doses of <b>fluvastatin,</b> zoledronic acid, and paclitaxel were investigated as single agents and in combination, and synergistic interactions were evaluated by the Chou-Talalay method. Western blots {{were used to assess}} effects on signal transduction pathways. Results: Growth of T 24 was significantly inhibited with IC 50 values of 2. 67 ± 0. 61 mM for <b>fluvastatin</b> and 5. 35 ± 1. 35 mM for zoledronic acid after 72 hours treatment. Geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate and farnesyl pyrophosphate was able to block, in part, this inhibitory activity. The combinations of zoledronic acid and paclitaxel, zoledronic acid and <b>fluvastatin,</b> and <b>fluvastatin</b> and paclitaxel were all synergistic. Both <b>fluvastatin</b> and zoledronic acid inhibited Ras and Rap prenylation, and the phosphorylation of ERK 1 / 2 and AKT. The degree of inhibition of phosphorylation of these key signaling transduction pathways appears to closely correlate with their synergistic interactions. Conclusions: Zoledronic acid enhances <b>fluvastatin</b> and paclitaxel activity against T 24 in a synergistic manner and this is mediated largely by inhibition of both the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and PI 3 K/AKT signaling pathways via isoprenylation inhibition...|$|E

Experimental {{evidence suggests that}} <b>fluvastatin</b> may, independent of any lipid lowering action, exert a greater direct inhibitory effect on proliferating vascular myocytes than other statins. The FLARE (<b>Fluvastatin</b> Angioplasty Restenosis) Trial was conceived to evaluate the ability of <b>fluvastatin</b> 40 mg twice daily to reduce restenosis after successful coronary balloon angioplasty (PTCA). METHODS: Patients were randomized to either placebo or <b>fluvastatin</b> 40 mg twice daily beginning 2 - 4 weeks prior to planned PTCA and continuing after a successful PTCA (without {{the use of a}} stent), to follow-up angiography at 26 +/- 2 weeks. Clinical follow-up was completed at 40 weeks. The primary end-point was angiographic restenosis, measured by quantitative coronary angiography at a core laboratory, as the loss in minimal luminal diameter during follow-up. Clinical end-points were death, myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass graft surgery or re-intervention, up to 40 weeks after PTCA. RESULTS: Of 1054 patients randomized, 526 were allocated to <b>fluvastatin</b> and 528 to placebo. Among these, 409 in the <b>fluvastatin</b> group and 427 in the placebo group were included in the intention-to-treat analysis, having undergone a successful PTCA after a minimum of 2 weeks of pre-treatment. At the time of PTCA, <b>fluvastatin</b> had reduced LDL cholesterol by 37 % and this was maintained at 33 % at 26 weeks. There was no difference in the primary end-point between the treatment groups (<b>fluvastatin</b> 0. 23 +/- 0. 49 mm vs placebo 0. 23 +/- 0. 52 mm, P= 0. 95) or in the angiographic restenosis rate (<b>fluvastatin</b> 28 %, placebo 31 %, chi-square P= 0. 42), or in the incidence of the composite clinical end-point at 40 weeks (22. 4 % vs 23. 3 %; logrank P= 0. 74). However, a significantly lower incidence of total death and myocardial infarction was observed in six patients (1. 4 %) in the <b>fluvastatin</b> group and 17 (4. 0 %) in the placebo group (log rank P= 0. 025). CONCLUSION: Treatment with <b>fluvastatin</b> 80 mg daily did not affect the process of restenosis and is therefore not indicated for this purpose. However, the observed reduction in mortality and myocardial infarction 40 weeks after PTCA in the <b>fluvastatin</b> treated group has not been previously reported with statin therapy. Accordingly, a priori investigation of this finding is indicated and a new clinical trial with this intention is already underway...|$|E
40|$|Background: Cigarette smoke {{includes}} {{free radicals}} that cause inflamation process which can increase inflamation markers such as alcaline phosphatase (ALP) serum. <b>Fluvastatin</b> has anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting the secretion of the enzyme myeloperoxidase (MPO) secreted by activated neutrophils which produce serum ALP serum and decreased levels of inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL- 1, IL- 8, and total leukocytes and neutrophils in sepsis rat. <b>Fluvastatin</b> {{also has a}} pro-inflammatory effects that increase the levels of cytokine transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) resulting in activation of neutrophils. This study aims {{to determine the effect}} of serum ALP levels. Methods : This study is an experimental study with pre and post test only control group design. Rats that had undergone adaptation for 1 week were divided rendomly into 3 groups each 6 rats and induced by cigarette smoke. KA was given <b>fluvastatin</b> 5 mg/kgBW, KB was given <b>fluvastatin</b> 10 mg/kgBW, and K without <b>fluvastatin</b> per-oral. AlP levels is checked by spctrofotometry (unit/cc) before an after exposure by 2 cigarettes/days in 4 weeks. Normal distributes data were analized by One Way Annova test and data that were not normally distributed were analized by the Krusskal Wallis test Result: Difference in serum ALP levels before and after exposure to cigarette smoke K: 226. 8; KA: 180. 17; KB: 378. 0 with p> 0. 05 between groups C and KA and p < 0. 05 between KB and K and KA and KB. Conclusion: <b>Fluvastatin</b> can not inhibit the increase of ALP levels in wistar rats that were given exposure to 2 cigarettes/days for 4 weeks. <b>Fluvastatin</b> 5 mg/kgBW had mean levels of serum ALP is smaller than the <b>fluvastatin</b> group and the control group 10 mg/KgBB...|$|E
