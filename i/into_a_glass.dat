5|$|The Broadmead {{shopping}} centre was redeveloped {{in the early}} years of the century, involving the demolition of one the city's tallest mid-century towers, Tollgate House, in the construction of Cabot Circus. The former Bristol and West Tower was reworked <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> skyscraper with glass panels in place of its concrete outer cladding. In 2005, the city council undertook extensive consultations about the future of tall buildings in Bristol, and identified support for new tall buildings so long as they are well designed, sustainable, distinctive and 'fit' into the existing urban landscape.|$|E

5|$|Juliet {{arrives at}} an airport with her sister, where Richard Alpert and Ethan Rom are there to escort her {{the rest of the}} way. Juliet says good-bye to her sister, Rachel, {{promising}} to be back before her baby is born. In the airport terminal, Alpert pours sedative <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> of orange juice and gives it to Juliet to drink, explaining that the trip is very intense. Juliet is wary of drinking the juice, even though she is okay with the other circumstances surrounding the trip. Alpert interrupts and tells her the place she is going is very special and that she has a gift with which she is supposed to do something significant. Juliet drinks the orange juice and passes out. She wakes up in a submarine with her arms and waist strapped down for safety.|$|E
5|$|This process, {{developed}} by Stony Brook Physics, yields francium isotopes with masses of 209, 210, and 211, {{which are then}} isolated by the magneto-optical trap (MOT). The production rate of a particular isotope depends on {{the energy of the}} oxygen beam. An 18O beam from the Stony Brook LINAC creates 210Fr in the gold target with the nuclear reaction 197Au + 18O → 210Fr + 5n. The production required some time to develop and understand. It was critical to operate the gold target very close to its melting point {{and to make sure that}} its surface was very clean. The nuclear reaction embeds the francium atoms deep in the gold target, and they must be removed efficiently. The atoms quickly diffuse to the surface of the gold target and are released as ions, but this does not happen every time. The francium ions are guided by electrostatic lenses until they land in a surface of hot yttrium and become neutral again. The francium is then injected <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> bulb. A magnetic field and laser beams cool and confine the atoms. Although the atoms remain in the trap for only about 20 seconds before escaping (or decaying), a steady stream of fresh atoms replaces those lost, keeping the number of trapped atoms roughly constant for minutes or longer. Initially, about 1000 francium atoms were trapped in the experiment. This was gradually improved and the setup is capable of trapping over 300,000 neutral atoms of francium a time. These are neutral metallic atoms in a gaseous unconsolidated state. Enough francium is trapped that a video camera can capture the light given off by the atoms as they fluoresce. The atoms appear as a glowing sphere about 1 millimeter in diameter. This was the first time that anyone had ever seen francium. The researchers can now make extremely sensitive measurements of the light emitted and absorbed by the trapped atoms, providing the first experimental results on various transitions between atomic energy levels in francium. Initial measurements show very good agreement between experimental values and calculations based on quantum theory. Other synthesis methods include bombarding radium with neutrons, and bombarding thorium with protons, deuterons, or helium ions. Francium has not been synthesized in amounts large enough to weigh.|$|E

25|$|As stibine (SbH3) is {{very similar}} to arsine (AsH3), it is also {{detected}} by the Marsh test. This sensitive test detects arsine generated in the presence of arsenic. This procedure, developed around 1836 by James Marsh, is based upon treating a sample with arsenic-free zinc and dilute sulfuric acid: if the sample contains arsenic, gaseous arsine will form. The gas is swept <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> tube and decomposed by means of heating around 250–300°C. The presence of arsenic is indicated by formation of a deposit in the heated part of the equipment. The formation of a black mirror deposit in the cool part of the equipment indicates the presence of antimony.|$|E
25|$|Jan Swammerdam {{was among}} the first to {{experimentally}} study muscle contraction. He used frog leg muscle along with its adherent nerve as a model for his experiments and observed muscle thickening (contraction) on nerve irritation (stimulation). He later on improved upon his technique by putting two needles at the muscle ends which showed movement on nerve stimulation. He even put the muscle <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> pipe to avoid direct touching of its belly and used brass wire to fix the nerve and silver wire to stimulate it. Though he was very close in understanding the true nature of bioelectricity in neurophysiology; his experiments have greatly inspired many budding neurophysiologists.|$|E

25|$|Manex also handled {{creature}} effects, such as Sentinels {{and machines}} {{in real world}} scenes; Animal Logic created the code hallway and the exploding Agent {{at the end of}} the film. DFilm managed scenes that required heavy use of digital compositing, such as Neo's jump off a skyscraper and the helicopter crash into a building. The ripple effect in the latter scene was created digitally, but the shot also included practical elements, and months of extensive research were needed to find the correct kind of glass and explosives to use. The scene was shot by colliding a quarter-scale helicopter mock-up <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> wall wired to concentric rings of explosives; the explosives were then triggered in sequence from the center outward, to create a wave of exploding glass.|$|E

25|$|On July 16, 1228, he was {{pronounced}} a saint by Pope Gregory IX (the former cardinal Ugolino di Conti, friend of Saint Francis and Cardinal Protector of the Order). The next day, the Pope {{laid the foundation}} stone for the Basilica of Saint Francis in Assisi. Francis was buried on May 25, 1230, under the Lower Basilica, but his tomb was soon hidden on orders of Brother Elias {{to protect it from}} Saracen invaders. His exact burial place remained unknown until it was re-discovered in 1818. Pasquale Belli then constructed for the remains a crypt in neo-classical style in the Lower Basilica. It was refashioned between 1927 and 1930 into its present form by Ugo Tarchi, stripping the wall of its marble decorations. In 1978, the remains of Saint Francis were examined and confirmed by a commission of scholars appointed by Pope Paul VI, and put <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> urn in the ancient stone tomb.|$|E

25|$|Another way {{to create}} {{longitudinally}} oriented channels {{is to create a}} conduit from one polymer with embedded longitudinally oriented fibers from another polymer; then selectively dissolve the fibers to form longitudinally oriented channels. Polycaprolactone (PCL) fibers were embedded in a (Hydroxyethyl)methacrylate (HEMA) scaffold. PCL was chosen over poly (lactic acid) (PLA) and poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), because it is insoluble in HEMA but soluble in acetone. This is important because HEMA was used for the main conduit material and acetone was used to selectively dissolve the polymer fibers. Extruded PCL fibers were inserted <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> tube and the HEMA solution was injected. The number of channels created was consistent from batch to batch and the variations in fiber diameter could be reduced by creating a more controlled PCL fiber extrusion system. The channels formed were confirmed to be continuous and homogeneous by examination of porosity variations. This process is safe, reproducible and has controllable dimensions. In a similar study conducted by Yu and Shoichet (2005), HEMA was copolymerized with AEMA to create a P(HEMA-co-AMEA) gel. Polycaprolactone (PCL) fibers were embedded in the gel, and then selectively dissolved by acetone with sonication to create channels. It was found that HEMA in mixture with 1% AEMA created the strongest gels. When compared to scaffolds without channels, the addition of 82–132 channels can provide an approximately 6–9 fold increase in surface area, which may be advantageous for regeneration studies that depend on contact-mediated cues.|$|E

500|$|The drakes {{that end}} up being left out after the others have paired off with mating {{partners}} sometimes target an isolated female duck, even one of a different species, and proceed to chase and peck at her until she weakens, {{at which point the}} males take turns copulating with the female. Lebret (1961) calls this behaviour [...] "Attempted Rape Flight", and Stanley Cramp and K.E.L. Simmons (1977) speak of [...] "rape-intent flights".
