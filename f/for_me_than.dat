25|$|The {{sense of}} {{something}} being missing on Aliens was greater <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>than</b> on The Abyss, where the film just got consistently better as the cut got along. The film must {{function as a}} dramatic, organic whole. When I cut the film together, things that read well on paper, on a conceptual level, didn't necessarily translate to the screen as well. I felt I was losing something by breaking my focus. Breaking the story's focus and coming off the main characters was a far greater detriment to the film than what was gained. The film keeps the same message intact at a thematic level, not at a really overt level, by working in a symbolic way.|$|E
500|$|Penry-Jones {{read the}} book and saw the other {{versions}} of the film, but said that Hitchcock's 1959 film North by Northwest was [...] "more of a template <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>than</b> any version of The 39 Steps". Explaining why he took on the part, he said to Tim Oglethorpe of the Daily Record: ...|$|E
500|$|Stevenson {{described}} {{the character of}} Marion as [...] "cranky, stubborn and lonely", saying that living alone has made her [...] "become quite idiotic and eccentric". When the character of April arrives, Stevenson explains that [...] "Marion has to go from nought to 80 in terms of parenting. There are lots of reasons she wouldn't get it right" [...] which leads on to the guilt and anxiety that Marion suffers when April runs away. Stevenson compared her own difficulties of parenting to Marion's, saying [...] "it is easier <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>than</b> someone like Marion because I have had 14 years experience". Richards spoke {{of the character of}} April, saying that [...] "the residential schools and children's homes were completely different from my life. [...] doesn't feel connected to anybody and she struggles to know who she is".|$|E

500|$|Doby {{played a}} major role in Cleveland's World Series victory against the Boston Braves. In Game 4 on October 9, Doby hit the first home run by a black player in World Series history. A picture {{featuring}} an embrace between Doby and white teammate Steve Gromek, who had pitched a complete game that day, was on the cover of the next day's Plain Dealer. Richard Goldstein of The New York Times called the photograph [...] "a signature moment in the integration of Major League Baseball." [...] Of the picture, Doby said, [...] "The picture was more rewarding and happy <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>than</b> actually hitting the home run. The picture finally showed a moment of a man showing his feelings for me." [...] The Indians defeated the Braves in six games and with it, Cleveland had its first World Series championship since the 1920 season. Doby's [...]318 batting average during the Series led the Indians. Nationally syndicated columnist Grantland Rice argued that without Doby and Gene Bearden, who had won 20 games that year, the Indians would have finished in fourth or fifth place. After the Series, Doby received a celebratory parade in Paterson, New Jersey, and during the offseason he, along with other teammates, appeared in the 1949 film The Kid From Cleveland. With additional income available due to the post-season run and Series championship, Doby and his wife attempted to buy a home in Paterson in an all-white neighborhood but were kept out by a petition from members of the community. The Dobys were allowed to purchase their desired home when the Paterson city mayor intervened on their behalf.|$|E
500|$|On October 25, 2005, Giants patriarch Wellington Mara {{died after}} a brief illness, {{at the age of}} 89. Mara had been {{involved}} with the Giants since he was nine years old, when he was a ball boy for the team. Mara was universally beloved by the players. Hall of Fame linebacker Harry Carson, who played during some of the team's down years in the 1970s, never became angry at Mara despite being frustrated with the team's performances. [...] "The Giants’ organization cares about its players more than most teams in the NFL. This stems from the top. The Maras are family men and Wellington, especially, has sought to cultivate a family atmosphere in the team.... If any NFL owner deserves a championship, it is Mara." [...] According to Parcells, Wellington made an effort {{to get to know each}} of his players. [...] "The Giants are Wellington Mara’s whole life, they have been his whole life. He’s at the office every day, he’s at practice very day, he loves hanging around the locker room and getting to know the players." [...] Despite his strong religious convictions, he put aside his personal beliefs, and avoided preaching to players who were having problems. [...] "Nobody did more <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>than</b> Wellington Mara." [...] Lawrence Taylor said. [...] "He didn’t have to save me, he didn’t have to keep helping me to find help.... And he never lectured me. I could tell he disapproved but he never lectured me." [...] Several players went to Mara's bedside as he was dying to say goodbye to the owner. The team dedicated their next game to Mara, and shut out the Redskins 36–0.|$|E

So I started locating the Quranic material and collecting it from parchments, scapula, leafstalks of date palms and from the memories of men.|$|E

2500|$|Williams has {{admitted}} being very shy and {{was diagnosed with}} social anxiety disorder, borderline personality disorder, and avoidance disorder with which he struggled to cope during his football career. Williams was treated with therapy and medication. Williams was briefly {{a spokesperson for the}} drug Paxil as treatment. He worked with the drug company GlaxoSmithKline to educate the public about the disorder. Williams later quit using Paxil and said that cannabis was a much better form of treatment. In an interview with ESPN, Williams stated, [...] "marijuana is 10 times better <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>than</b> Paxil." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hosono saw four {{lifeboats}} being launched and {{contemplated the}} prospect of an imminent death. He was [...] "deep in desolate thought that I would no more be able to see my beloved wife and children, since there was no alternative <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>than</b> to share the same destiny as the Titanic". [...] As the number of lifeboats remaining diminished rapidly, [...] "I tried to prepare myself for the last moment with no agitation, making up my mind not to leave anything disgraceful as a Japanese. But still I found myself looking for and waiting for any possible chance for survival." ...|$|E
2500|$|Obituaries for {{her were}} {{published}} in The New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, The Washington Post, The Sydney Morning Herald, and the Corriere della Sera, amongst others. The Sydney Morning Herald also republished one of her last blog posts, in which she discussed how engaging with a difficult activity had taught her about helping students with their own difficulties, partly by teaching them to celebrate the little successes {{on the way to}} a goal. She wrote that, [...] "Ultimately, nothing was more helpful <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>than</b> failing repeatedly" [...] and that she wanted her students to realize that failures could be part of learning and were nothing to be ashamed of. The journal ABO, which Wadewitz had worked for from 2011 to 2012, dedicated its March 2014 issue to Wadewitz.|$|E
