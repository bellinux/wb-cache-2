In the last decade, with the rapid development of Micro Electro Mechanical Sensors (MEMS), great interest has been generated in low cost integrated GPS/INS applications. This paper presents a PC 104 based low cost GPS/INS integrated navigation platform. The platform hardware consists of low cost <b>inertial</b> <b>sensors</b> and an <b>assembly</b> of various PC 104 compatible peripherals, such as data acquisition card, GPS receiver, Ethernet card, mother board, graphic card, etc. The platform software including inertial/GPS data acquisition, inertial navigation calculation and integrated GPS/INS Kalman filter is implemented with Simulink, which can be directly loaded and processed in the PC 104 mother board {{with the aid of}} Matlab Real-Time Workshop (RTW) utility.

Methods: This was a laboratory-based, repeated-measures design with ten healthy participants. Concurrent validity was tested between an <b>inertial</b> <b>sensor,</b> forceplate, and rigid-body kinematics across three commonly used balance tests. Further, the <b>inertial</b> <b>sensor</b> measures were compared across eight commonly used tests of balance.

Results: The <b>inertial</b> <b>sensor</b> was correlated to both the forceplate-derived measures (r= 0. 793) and rigid-body kinematics (r= 0. 887). Significant differences between the balance tests were observed when tested with the <b>inertial</b> <b>sensor.</b> In general, there was a three-way interactions between the three balance factors (surface, stance, and vision) leading to pairwise comparisons between each balance test. The root-mean-square showed an increase across tasks of greater difficulty ranging from an average of 0. 0368 with two legs, eyes-open to 0. 911 when tested during tandem stance, eyes-closed tested on a foam pad.
