25|$|Coordination polyhedra are <b>geometric</b> <b>representation</b> {{of how a}} cation is {{surrounded}} by an anion. In mineralogy, coordination polyhedra are usually considered in terms of oxygen, due its abundance in the crust. The base unit of silicate minerals is the silica tetrahedron – one Si4+ surrounded by four O2−. An alternate way of describing the coordination of the silicate is by a number: {{in the case of}} the silica tetrahedron, the silicon is said to have a coordination number of 4. Various cations have a specific range of possible coordination numbers; for silicon, it is almost always 4, except for very high-pressure minerals where compound is compressed such that silicon is in six-fold (octahedral) coordination by oxygen. Bigger cations have a bigger coordination number because of the increase in relative size as compared to oxygen (the last orbital subshell of heavier atoms is different too). Changes in coordination numbers between leads to physical and mineralogical differences; for example, at high pressure such as in the mantle, many minerals, especially silicates such as olivine and garnet will change to a perovskite structure, where silicon is in octahedral coordination. Another example are the aluminosilicates kyanite, andalusite, and sillimanite (polymorphs, as they share the formula Al2SiO5), which differ by the coordination number of the Al3+; these minerals transition from one another as a response to changes in pressure and temperature. In the case of silicate materials, the substitution of Si4+ by Al3+ allows for a variety of minerals because of the need to balance charges.|$|E

These papers introduced the use of different type phase diagrams, which were his favorite aids to the imagination process when doing research, rather than the mechanical models, {{such as the ones}} that Maxwell used in constructing his electromagnetic theory, which might not completely represent their corresponding phenomena. [...] Although the journal had few readers capable of understanding Gibbs's work, he shared reprints with correspondents in Europe and received an enthusiastic response from James Clerk Maxwell at Cambridge.

40|$|Extension Properties of Graphs and Structures Pavel Klavík The main {{motivation}} for graph drawing and <b>geometric</b> <b>representations</b> is {{finding ways to}} visualize graphs efficiently to make their structure as understandable as possible. In this thesis, we are concerned with structural properties which are implied for graphs having certain <b>geometric</b> <b>representations.</b> We study two types of geometric representations: inter- section representations in which the vertices are represented by geometric sets while the edges are encoded by their intersections, and planar embeddings of planar graphs which are drawing of graphs into the plane without crossing edges. The existence of <b>geometric</b> <b>representations</b> {{can be used to}} deduce additional information about graphs. The main idea of this thesis is to ask what extra information can be deduced from the structure of all possible <b>geometric</b> <b>representations.</b> In Part I, we study the partial representation extension problems for intersection rep- resentations. Aside from the graph, the input also gives a partial representation, which prescribes a representation of an induced subgraph. We ask whether this partial repre- sentation can be extended to a full representation of the input graph without altering the predrawn sets. I introduced this problem in 2010 in my Bachelor's thesis.

However, when all generated knots are grouped together, their scaling exponent becomes equal to 0. 5 (as in non-self-avoiding random walks). We explain here this apparent paradox.
