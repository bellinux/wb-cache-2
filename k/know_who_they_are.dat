In Navajo communities, for children and adults, storytelling {{is one of the many}} effective ways to educate both the young and old about their cultures, identities and history. Storytelling help the Navajos <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>they</b> <b>are,</b> where they come from and where they belong.|$|E

500|$|On the island, the {{remaining}} survivors {{are back in}} the past, attempting to start a fire, when they are attacked by a barrage of flaming arrows. Some of the survivors are able to escape, but Neil [...] "Frogurt" [...] and a few others are killed, and James [...] "Sawyer" [...] Ford (Josh Holloway) and Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell) are separated from the group. Lost in the jungle, they are captured by a group of armed military men who demand to <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>they</b> <b>are,</b> asserting that the island is theirs. The men are about to cut off Juliet's hand to extract information, when John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) ambushes them, helping Sawyer and Juliet free themselves.|$|E

5000|$|At 11:30 p.m., Susana hadn't {{arrived to}} tell us who Horacio was. ... But two young men did arrive and began {{to knock on the}} door and nobody opened it .... So one of our men went to speak with them, and {{immediately}} they both ran away. We didn't <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>they</b> <b>were.</b> ... One of our men ran, 'stop, stop, stop,' and threw them both to the ground. We didn't <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>they</b> <b>were,</b> but afterwards <b>they</b> turned out to be Felix and Nelson Encinas.|$|R

500|$|At a {{dialogue}} on {{the changes to}} the Elected President scheme on 15 September 2016, Law Minister K. Shanmugam addressed the allegation, saying: [...] "sk yourself logically, [...] do we, as a Government, do what is right, based on the system, or do we worry [...] some {{people are going to}} say this is to knock out people we don't like? You know, more than 1,000 people will qualify from the private sector. Do you think we <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> and we can make sure that they are all going to be OK? It’s not possible." [...] He also expressed the view that Tan would not satisfy the new qualification criteria as he had held a non-executive post in a company, and the company did not have shareholders' equity of at least $500 million. In a Facebook post two days later, Tan asked: [...] "Is there some truth after all that the changes in the rules was to make sure I would not be eligible? It would be a sad day for Singaporeans if a constitutional change was made because of an individual." [...] The Singapore Government denied the accusation, Shanmugam stating at another forum held on 18 September that the amendments to the Elected President scheme were aimed at [...] "improving the system for Singapore's long-term future, not at barring certain individuals from standing".|$|E

The women exit, but Florinda leaves Belvile with a jewel (most likely a locket of some sort) so that he [...] "may repent the {{opportunity}} you have lost by your modesty." [...] Belvile recognizes Florinda’s picture in the locket and resolves to rescue her that night, with Willmore and Frederick's help.|$|E
2500|$|The {{terrorists were}} {{in contact with}} their {{handlers}} during the attack, but soon after the SSG had moved in, the security forces intercepted the terrorists' communications. [...] "We <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> and who they were in contact with but details can not be shared due to operation reasons. They were aware of locations and they must have carried out the recon of the area. And it is highly possible that someone from inside might have tipped them off." [...] said Bajwa.|$|E

2500|$|Osbourne's co-hosts on The Talk, Leah Remini and Holly Robinson Peete were {{released}} from their contracts in 2011. Osbourne spoke of their dismissals in December 2011 on The Howard Stern Show, stating: [...] "Some people don't really <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>they</b> <b>are,</b> {{and you have}} to know who you are when you're in something like this. You can't pretend to be something you're not. You have to know your brand. You can't be all things to everyone." [...] Remini later protested her dismissal with series of tweets and accusations aimed at Osbourne.|$|E
2500|$|Stipe {{wrote the}} lyrics of Monster in character. This, {{according}} to biographer Dan Buckley, [...] "set the real Stipe {{at a distance from}} the mask adopted for each song." [...] The album dealt with the nature of celebrity and [...] "the creepiness of fandom as pathology". Buck said the album was a reaction to the band's popularity. He added, [...] "When I read the lyrics I thought, all these guys are totally fucked up. I don't <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>they</b> <b>are,</b> because they're not Michael. I would say that this was the only time where he's done characters that are creepy, and I don't know if anyone got that. He was getting out his things by acting out these parts that are not him." [...] The band noted {{that at the end of}} certain songs, they left blank choruses where Mills and Berry would traditionally sing harmonies so fans could sing along.|$|E
2500|$|Das Racist's unique {{style has}} a strong {{polarizing}} tendency; their set at the 2009 Pop Montreal festival was described as [...] "the most divisive show seen at the festival". They describe their approach to music as [...] "'deconstructionalist': sawing the legs out from under hip-hop as they celebrate it". New York Times wrote [...] "Das Racist’s lack of piety has become an aesthetic of its own, with songs that are as much commentary on hip-hop as rigorous practice of it". The Root said DasRacist could speak for both [...] "the ‘hood or the nearest gated community". Playboy called the duo [...] "equal parts hip-hop and Cheech & Chong". In an interview with Sepia Mutiny, Suri described Das Racist's music:we’re not making music that’s instantly appealing. We dabble with non sequiturs, dadaism, repetition, repetition. We make dance music while talking about not-dancey things. We say things that on the surface can seem pretty dumb but it’s a mask on some Paul Laurence Dunbar shit for actual discontent {{with a lot of}} shit in the world. Further, {{not a lot of people}} want to hear rappers talk about Dinesh D'Souza being a punk, Eddie Said, Gayatri Spivak being dope or even <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>they</b> <b>are.</b> A lot of people hear Pizza Hut Taco Bell and then have preconceived notions about our entire body of work that fall pretty flat.|$|E

5000|$|Despite being Grammy-nominated {{and being}} among the most {{prominent}} vocal performers on the radio in the United States in the 1960s, {{little is known about}} the group.
