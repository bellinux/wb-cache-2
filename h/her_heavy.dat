5|$|Dupuy de Lôme was {{designed}} to fill the commerce-raiding strategy of the Jeune École. Considered by some the first true armoured cruiser, she was superior to existing British and Italian protected cruisers, especially in her relatively thick steel armour. She could control the engagement range with her superior speed and <b>her</b> <b>heavy</b> armament of quick-firing guns, {{all of which were}} mounted in gun turrets, in marked contrast to her intended opponents who mounted their guns in lightly protected casemates or pivot mounts.|$|E
5|$|HMS Vigilant was a {{merchantman}} {{converted into}} a warship during the American Revolution. After serving as a transport in North American waters from 1775, she was purchased by the Royal Navy (RN) and modified for shore bombardment duties in 1777. She {{was instrumental in the}} eventual British success during the siege of Fort Mifflin that same year and supported British operations in Georgia and South Carolina in 1779–80. <b>Her</b> <b>heavy</b> armament proved to be more than Vigilant was designed to handle and she was condemned and disposed of in 1780.|$|E
5|$|Wisconsin arrived off Songjin, Korea on 15 March and {{concentrated}} her gunfire on enemy railway transport. Early that morning, she destroyed a communist troop train trapped outside a destroyed tunnel. That afternoon, she received the first direct hit in her history, {{when one of}} four shells from a North Korean 152mm gun battery struck the shield of a starboard 40mm mount; Although little material damage resulted, three men were injured.

5|$|With the 1979 {{municipal}} elections occurring only {{months after the}} riot, prominent gay leaders feared a backlash at the polls. The elections continued without incident, and the gay community fared better than expected, wielding unprecedented influence. Although the virtually unknown gay Mayoral candidate David Scott {{finished third in the}} election, his showing was strong enough to force Mayor Feinstein into a runoff election against conservative City Supervisor Quentin Kopp. Feinstein's promises to appoint more gay people to public office, and <b>her</b> <b>heavy</b> campaigning in the Castro, ensured that she won enough support from the gay community to give her a full term as Mayor.|$|E

She was joined by Guam, two light cruisers, and Destroyer Squadron 47. On the night of 2728 March, she fired forty-five 12-inch shells and three hundred and fifty-two 5-inch rounds at the island. The ships rejoined TG 58.4 at a refueling point, after which they returned to Okinawa to support the landings when they began on 1 April. On the evening of 11 April, Alaska shot down one Japanese plane, assisted {{in the destruction of}} another, and claimed what might have been an Ohka piloted rocket-bomb. On 16 April, the ship shot down another three aircraft and assisted with three others. Throughout the rest of the month, <b>her</b> <b>heavy</b> anti-aircraft fire succeeded in driving off Japanese bombers.|$|E
5|$|Chopra {{also had}} to learn jazz dance {{for one of the}} characters. For another song {{featuring}} all twelve characters, Chopra had to shoot for 22 hours to keep the continuity of the whole musical sequence. She had to change the costumes and makeup for each of the twelve characters while filming the song. At one point, Chopra fainted on the set and Gowariker wanted to postpone the filming, but she insisted on finishing the scenes. <b>Her</b> <b>heavy</b> workloadfilming for several productions, travelling for endorsements, and performing at live showstook its toll; she was admitted to hospital because of exhaustion and was kept under observation. After spending three days in hospital, she was discharged and immediately resumed filming to avoid delaying her other projects. Filming was completed by the first week of May 2009.|$|E
60|$|We {{were not}} at Leuk {{in time to see}} <b>her</b> at <b>her</b> <b>heaviest</b> weight. She had {{suffered}} from corpulence and had come there to get rid of her extra flesh in the baths.

5|$|Following {{two years}} of negotiation, in 1920 the NFWW voted to merge with the National Union of General Workers and become that union's Women's Section. Bondfield, who {{supported}} the merger, believed that provided women could maintain their separate group identity, it was better {{for men and women}} to work together. The secretary of the new section was to have been Mary Macarthur, but she died of cancer on 1 January 1921, the date that the merger came into effect. Bondfield was appointed in her place, and remained in the post (with leave of absence while holding ministerial office) until 1938. To honour her friend, Bondfield helped to organise the Mary Macarthur Memorial Fund. She added other responsibilities to <b>her</b> <b>heavy</b> schedule: chairing the Standing Joint Committee of Industrial Women's Organisations (SJCIWO), membership of the Labour Party's Emergency Committee on Unemployment, and chairman of the 1922 Conference of Unemployed Women. In September 1923 she became the first women to assume the chair of the TUC's General Council.|$|E
5|$|Maine {{served in}} the Atlantic for the {{entirety}} of her career with the North Atlantic Fleet, which later became the Atlantic Fleet; {{during the early years}} of her service, she was the fleet flagship, until she was replaced in 1907. Later that year, she joined the cruise of the Great White Fleet, though <b>her</b> <b>heavy</b> coal consumption prevented her from continuing with the fleet past San Francisco. After returning to the U.S., she served as the 3rd Squadron flagship. During America's participation in World War I from April 1917 to November 1918, Maine was used as a training ship. She remained in active service until May 1920, when she was decommissioned. The ship was ultimately sold for scrap in January 1922 and broken up for scrap under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty signed that year.|$|E
5|$|Schlesien saw limited combat during World War II, {{including}} {{the invasion of}} Norway in 1940. After {{the conclusion of the}} operation, the ship was again given secondary duties. She ended her career as an anti-aircraft ship in the Baltic; in April 1945 Schlesien steamed to Swinemünde to restock her ammunition and evacuate wounded soldiers when she struck a mine on 3 May. She sank in shallow water, though much of her superstructure, including her main battery, remained above water. In the remaining days of the war, Schlesien used <b>her</b> <b>heavy</b> artillery to provide support for retreating German ground troops. After the end of the war, she was broken up, though some parts of the ship remained until the 1970s.|$|E

25|$|Dementieva had no {{particular}} favorite surface, as her playing ability {{allowed her to}} adapt easily on each surface although her best results were on hard courts, while her two Grand Slam finals were on hard court and clay. While <b>her</b> <b>heavy</b> groundstroking baseline game {{did not seem to}} be that suited to grass, her athleticism and improved serve, in particular her slice serve, led to two consecutive semi-final appearances at Wimbledon.|$|E
25|$|On August 21, 1940, Trotsky {{was assassinated}} in Coyoacán, where he had {{continued}} to live after leaving La Casa Azul. Kahlo was briefly suspected of being involved, as she knew the murderer, and was arrested and held for two days with her sister Cristina. The following month, Kahlo traveled to San Francisco for medical treatment for back pain and a fungal infection on her hand. Her continuously fragile health had been in increasing decline since her divorce and was exacerbated by <b>her</b> <b>heavy</b> consumption of alcohol.|$|E
25|$|On July 19, 1957, {{hours after}} Liberace gave a {{deposition}} in his $25 million libel suit against Confidential magazine, two masked intruders attacked {{his mother in}} the garage of Liberace's home in Sherman Oaks.

25|$|Addams kept up <b>her</b> <b>heavy</b> {{schedule}} of public lectures around the country, especially at college campuses. In addition, she offered college courses through the Extension Division of the University of Chicago. She declined offers {{from the university}} to become directly affiliated with it, including an offer from Albion Small, chair of the Department of Sociology, of a graduate faculty position. She declined {{in order to maintain}} her independent role outside of academia. Her goal was to teach adults not enrolled in formal academic institutions, because of their poverty and/or lack of credentials. Furthermore, she wanted no university controls over her political activism.|$|E
25|$|A Time-Turner may be {{used for}} {{short-term}} time travel. Hermione receives a Time-Turner from McGonagall in Prisoner of Azkaban, enabling her to attend more than one class simultaneously. Hermione is ordered to keep it a secret from everyone, including Harry and Ron, although they do notice the suspicious impossibility of her schedule and several bizarre disappearances and reappearances. Hermione lets Harry and Ron in on the secret {{near the end of the}} book, when she and Harry use the Time-Turner to save Sirius Black and Buckbeak. Feeling the strain from <b>her</b> <b>heavy</b> course load, she finally returns the device to McGonagall at the end of the novel.|$|E
25|$|Hermione buys a cat named Crookshanks, {{who takes}} to chasing Ron's pet rat, Scabbers. Before {{the start of}} term, Professor McGonagall {{secretly}} gives Hermione a Time-Turner, a device which enables her {{to go back in}} time and handle <b>her</b> <b>heavy</b> class schedule, though this is not revealed until the penultimate chapter. Much tension comes into play between Hermione and her two best friends; Harry is furious with her because she told McGonagall that he had received a Firebolt, which was confiscated to be inspected for traces of dark magic. Ron is angry because he feels Crookshanks is responsible for Scabbers' disappearance, while Hermione fiercely maintains that Crookshanks is innocent.|$|E

5|$|It will {{be remembered}} that the Virginia was a novelty in naval architecture, wholly unlike any ship that ever floated; that <b>her</b> <b>heaviest</b> guns were equal {{novelties}} in ordnance; that her motive power and obedience to her helm were untried, and her officers and crew strangers, comparatively, to the ship and to each other; and yet, under all these disadvantages, the dashing courage and consummate professional ability of Flag Officer Buchanan and his associates achieved the most remarkable victory which naval annals record.|$|R
