5|$|Espejo is {{considered}} the precursor of the <b>independence</b> <b>movement</b> in Quito. He died in 1795, but his ideas had a powerful influence on three of his close friends: Juan Pío Montúfar, Juan de Dios Morales and Juan de Salinas. They, along with Manuel Rodriguez Quiroga, founded the revolutionary movement of August 10, 1809, in Quito, when the city declared independence from Spain.|$|E
5|$|In July 1962, Algeria became {{independent}} of France. As a staunch {{political and financial}} supporter of the Algerian <b>independence</b> <b>movement,</b> Nasser considered the country's independence to be a personal victory.

5|$|In the 1940s, as the Indian <b>independence</b> <b>movement</b> intensified, an upsurge of Muslim {{nationalism}} helmed by the All-India Muslim League took place, {{of which}} Muhammad Ali Jinnah {{was the most}} prominent leader. Being a political party to secure {{the interests of the}} Muslim diaspora in British India, the Muslim League played a decisive role during the 1940s in the Indian <b>independence</b> <b>movement</b> and developed into {{the driving force behind the}} creation of Pakistan as a Muslim state in South Asia. During a three-day general session of All-India Muslim League from 22–24 March 1940, a formal political statement was presented, known as the Lahore Resolution, which called on for the creation of an independent state for Muslims. In 1956, 23 March also became the date on which Pakistan transitioned from a dominion to a republic, and is known as Pakistan Day.|$|E

5|$|New Caledonia was {{annexed to}} France in 1853, {{and became an}} {{overseas}} territory of France in 1956. An <b>independence</b> <b>movement</b> led to a failed revolt in 1967, and was restarted in 1984, pursuing total independence status from the French rule. When the 1988 Matignon agreements were signed between the representatives of France and New Caledonia to decide on holding the referendum for independence, Jean-Marie Tjibaou, the Kanak leader of the <b>independence</b> <b>movement,</b> had mooted a proposal {{to set up an}} Agency for the Development of Kanak Culture (ADCK). After Tjibaou's assassination in 1989, the French President François Mitterrand ordered that a cultural centre on the lines suggested by Tjibaou be set up in Nouméa, the capital of New Caledonia; it was to be the last of Mitterrand's Grands Projets. The Jean-Marie Tjibaou Cultural Centre was formally established in May 1998.|$|E

5|$|The Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles {{had their}} {{origins in the}} Indian <b>independence</b> <b>movement,</b> which strove to achieve the values of liberty and social welfare as the goals of an {{independent}} Indian state. The development of constitutional rights in India was inspired by historical documents such as England's Bill of Rights, the United States Bill of Rights and France's Declaration of the Rights of Man. The demand for civil liberties formed {{an important part of}} the Indian <b>independence</b> <b>movement,</b> with one of the objectives of the Indian National Congress (INC) being to end discrimination between the British rulers and their Indian subjects. This demand was explicitly mentioned in resolutions adopted by the INC between 1917 and 1919. The demands articulated in these resolutions included granting to Indians the rights to equality before law, free speech, trial by juries composed at least half of Indian members, political power, and equal terms for bearing arms as British citizens.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the seeds}} of both {{proactive}} government repression against the Puerto Rican <b>independence</b> <b>movement</b> had been planted before the Grito de Lares, and its aftermath only guaranteed the surge of autonomism as a political alternative in the island, the level of cultural and social development of a collective Puerto Rican conscience was almost {{a direct consequence of}} the event. To put it simply, if there is any nationalistic sentiment in Puerto Rico in the present day, almost all of it {{can be traced back to}} Betances and his political work.|$|E

On 28 November 1912 in Vlorë, Ismail Qemali declared Albania's independence, and a provisional government was soon formed that exercised its authority {{only in the}} immediate area of Vlorë. Elsewhere, the Ottoman general Essad Pasha formed the Republic of Central Albania at Durrës, while conservative Albanian tribesmen still hoped for an Ottoman ruler.
