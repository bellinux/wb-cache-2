He had a way of folding his arms and looking at you as though he <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> make a mistake. But in our playoff in the 1988 U.S. Open, I was in a good frame of mind to handle him. We didn't say three words all day, which was fine with me. I'm proud of beating him {{when he was in his}} prime." ...|$|E

He started playing at the Lucania Snooker Club in Romford, where at the age of 18 the manager of the club brought his talent to the attention of Barry Hearn, chairman of the Lucania chain of snooker halls. Hearn became Davis' friend and manager. Paid £25 a match by Hearn, Davis toured the country, taking part in challenge matches against established professionals such as Ray Reardon, John Spencer and Alex Higgins. Around this time he was given the nickname [...] "Nugget" [...] because, according to Hearn, [...] "you could put your case of money on him and you <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> get paid." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "He <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be on {{the other}} side, Nat, and wanted to teach me a lesson. I suppose it is folly to contest a case where the Railroad Commission has {{completely}} exonerated your client," [...] Austen added thoughtfully.|$|E
6000|$|... "I must--I must. When I <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> live I {{vowed that}} I {{would tell you}} as soon as you were well--that I wouldn't go on {{accepting}} your friendship and companionship without telling you how unworthy I was of it. And I've been so afraid--it would turn you against me." ...|$|E
6000|$|Ida {{looked at}} me without surprise, but with a little {{pleasure}} in her face. [...] "What nonsense!" [...] she said quietly. [...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> propose to me this afternoon, and so I came out alone {{to keep out of}} your way. You haven't had time to make up your mind properly yet." ...|$|E

She makes me promise I won't leave the yard. So I'll {{not have to}} lie to meet you.... Daren, that day at Helen's, the minute I saw you I <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have {{something}} to do with my future." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] {{replied the}} older man. [...] "I have tried never to say {{anything}} to influence her.

6000|$|... "If I had <b>known</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> out, I {{should have}} got you {{just to go}} as far as my house with some orders for Nanny," [...] said she, [...] "which I have since, to my very great inconvenience, been obliged to go and carry myself. I could very ill spare the time, and you might have saved me the trouble, if you would only have been so good as to let us <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> out.

5000|$|MTV's Michael Depland has {{commented on}} the video saying: [...] "Rappers like Brooklyn's Joey Badass are in the {{business}} of painting what writers call [...] "word pictures." [...] He's not just deft at turning a phrase and killing the delivery, but he's also especially good at constructing graphic and vivid tales via his lyrics—he gets you right in there. Now, in his video for the DJ Premier-produced [...] "Unorthodox," [...] a free single from Green Label Sound, Joey's words are literally brought to life. In the lush and colorful clip, the MTV Artist To Watch and Premier are covered in art and strange hues via rotoscoping, while animation illustrates the rapper's lyrics. Joey's verbose lyrical style makes for great visual storytelling, lucky for us, as his words spring to life around him. The Pro Era member has been on a tear lately with last month's video for [...] "Underground Airplay," [...] featuring Big K.R.I.T. and Smoke DZA and his collabo [...] "Wendy N Becky" [...] with Chance The Rapper. Plus, he'll be performing on the 2013 Woodies stage next week. OK, Joey, we <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be something to watch this year, but now you're just OVERDOING it. Well, we guess if [...] "Unorthodox" [...] represents one piece of art for you, all of 2013 is shaping up to be your masterpiece." ...|$|E
5000|$|We {{knew we had}} to {{go through}} Oakland to win the championship, and they knew they had to go through Kansas City...that made it a very bitter rivalry. Hank Stram, former Texans/Chiefs head coach [...] Those were my {{favorite}} games...I always likened them to a heavyweight fight. You <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> get beat up, but it was fun. We needed the Chiefs. We wouldn't have been as good without them. Ben Davidson, former Raiders defensive end. [...] It's something special. It's not just media hype...You can sense it with coaches and players. Then you get out into the community, and you realize what a huge game this is for both cities. Will Shields, former Chiefs offensive guard. [...] In Oakland...the games you always really wanted to come see were the Niners and the Chiefs. You grew up hating red...It goes deep. It's not just the teams. It's the organizations, you know, which organization is better? These are two teams that played in the old AFL against each other. Most of the history goes back to it. They've been AFC West rivals for a very, very long time. It's always been the must-win game. Kirk Morrison, former Raiders linebacker. [...] It's a dark game. I characterize it as a lot of darkness." [...] When asked whether [...] "dark" [...] was meant as 'a good vs. evil dark'—"You can read between the lines.
