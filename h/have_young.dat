5|$|This {{decision}} {{may cause}} regret in some men and women. Of women aged over 30 who have undergone tubal ligation, about 5% regret their decision, {{as compared with}} 20% of women aged under 30. By contrast, less than 5% of men are likely to regret sterilization. Men more likely to regret sterilization are younger, <b>have</b> <b>young</b> or no children, or have an unstable marriage. In a survey of biological parents, 9% stated {{they would not have}} had children if they were able to do it over again.|$|E
5|$|In Grévy's zebras and {{the wild}} ass species, adults have more fluid {{associations}} and adult males will establish large territories and monopolize the females that enter them. These species live in habitats with sparser resources and standing water and grazing areas may be separated. Groups of lactating females are able to remain in groups with non-lactating ones and usually gather at foraging areas. The most dominant males establish territories near watering holes, where more sexually receptive females gather. Subdominants have territories farther away, near foraging areas. Mares may wander through several territories but will remain in one when they <b>have</b> <b>young.</b> Staying in a territory offers a female protection from harassment by outside males, as well as access to a renewable resource. Some feral populations of horse exhibit features of both the harem and territorial social systems.|$|E

5|$|In a {{study done}} by Rosamund Weatherall, Heather Joshi and Susan Macran of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in 1994, the {{research}} presented suggests that women presented with the double burden have a lower mortality rate than women who are simply housewives. The women who were observed that had part-time jobs had a mortality rate lower than the women with full-time jobs and children. The same study also suggests that women who <b>have</b> <b>young</b> children {{are less likely to}} die than women who have no children or have older children. Although this evidence can not be strictly attributed to the double burden of having children and a career field, it can give a good indication of a trend in society. Also, this study was conducted in multiple countries including England, Wales, and the United States which gives the information presented from the study a more global perspective on the double burden.|$|E
5|$|Very {{little is}} known about the summer {{roosting}} locations of this species, as well as where maternal colonies are formed, which makes a proper species distribution estimate difficult to obtain. The first study into the summer roosting habits was only done in 2011 so information is scarce. This study performed by Johnson, Kiser and Peterson discovered that these bats most commonly use ground level rock roosts in talus slopes, rock fields and vertical cliff faces for their summer roosts. On average they change their roosts every 1.1 days, males travel about 41 meters between consecutive roosts and females around 67 meters. They also found that females roosting sites were closer to ephemeral water sources than male’s roosts. Females who <b>have</b> <b>young</b> require roost sites that receive a lot of sunlight in order to keep the pups warm while the mother is away from the nesting site. Summer roosting habitats are very difficult to find, and may be threatened by mining, quarrying, oil and gas drilling and other mineral extraction, as well as logging, sprawl highway construction, wind energy and other forms of agricultural, industrial and residential development. However, it is also likely that some of the above disturbances could also create roosting sites for the species.|$|E
25|$|One {{problem that}} women have to face is that mothers who <b>have</b> <b>young</b> {{children}} and want {{to pursue a career}} may face social criticism. In 2014, the governing coalition agreed to impose a 30% female quota for Supervisory board positions from 2016 onwards.|$|E

These men, known as coureurs des bois (runners of the woods) (such as Étienne Brûlé), extended French influence south and west to the Great Lakes and among the Huron tribes who lived there.

25|$|The Neapolitan Mastiff {{is not a}} breed {{for most}} people, and {{certainly}} not a dog for beginners. Neapolitans must be well socialized with people (especially children), as they are large, powerful dogs and do not always know their own strength. Additionally, young children <b>have</b> <b>young</b> friends, and even with extensive socialization and training, Neapolitans will be wary of strangers and protective of their family, which can be disastrous for small children. Most of the time, they will protect their owners with their lives.|$|E
25|$|In 1534, Jacques Cartier {{discovered}} the Gaspé Peninsula and claimed {{the land in}} the name of Francis I of France.

That's why Samuel de Champlain arranged to <b>have</b> <b>young</b> French men live with the natives, to learn their language and customs and help the French adapt to life in North America. These men, known as coureurs des bois (runners of the woods), were the first European mushers in North America, extended French influence south and west and in 1609, New France controlled all the Canadian Shield. In 1680, the intendant Duchesneau estimated that there was not one family in New France who did not have a “son, brother, uncle or nephew” among the Coureurs des Bois. During the winter, sled became the ordinary transportation in the north of New France.|$|E

500|$|Also, faecal sac. A mucous membrane, {{generally}} {{white or}} clear {{with a dark}} end, that surrounds the feces of some species of [...] birds. It allows parent birds to more easily remove fecal material from the nest. The nestling usually produces a fecal sac within seconds of being fed; if not, a waiting adult may prod around the youngster's cloaca to stimulate excretion. Young birds of some species adopt specific postures or engage in specific behaviours to signal that they are producing fecal sacs. For example, nestling curve-billed thrashers raise their posteriors in the air, while young cactus wrens shake their bodies. Other species deposit the sacs {{on the rim of}} the nest, where they are likely to be seen (and removed) by parent birds. Not all species generate fecal sacs.

500|$|Bacon Academy {{is named}} for Pierpoint Bacon, a prosperous farmer who died childless in 1800. Bacon bequeathed most of his {{property}} and assets to the First Society of Colchester to support schooling. The trustees decided to build an academy, an institution to <b>have</b> <b>young</b> men be educated, and then go directly into the workforce. Completed in 1803 {{for the cost of}} $7000, the main Bacon Academy structure is a long by wide three-story Flemish bond brick structure with Federal style details. The foundation of the academy is made of fieldstone with a facing of dressed granite blocks. The bricks were produced on a local farm for the purpose building Bacon Academy. The front facade has 26windows arranged in 9bays with gaps for the chimneys in between the second and third bay from the corners. The sash is 6-by-6 and was noted to appear original in the nomination form. Originally the hipped roof had four chimneys, with two matching chimneys on each the west and east sides. Only the east chimneys remain. Facing the front entrance, the chimneys are spaced about [...] from the side corners. In the 1982nomination, the hipped roof was reported to have asphalt shingles.|$|E

He did, however, occasionally empathise with the convicts, especially when they were mistreated. Shortly after landing on Norfolk Island, Clark and Robert Kellow came across some convicts, including some women with their children, who {{had been forced to}} sleep in the open far from the main townsite, adequate accommodation being lacking: [...] "on the Road we met a great many of the Convicts both Men and Women Particular the women that <b>have</b> <b>young</b> children Who told me that the have been obliged to Sleep in the woods all night for the could not get into Town, poor Devils how they are Kick about from one place to a nother".
