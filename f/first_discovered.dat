40|$|Abstract. A novel algorithm, CorClass, that {{integrates}} {{association rule}} mining with classification, is presented. It <b>first</b> <b>discovers</b> all correlated association rules (adapting a technique by Morishita and Sese) and then applies the discovered rule sets to classify unseen data. The key advantage of CorClass, {{as compared to}} other techniques for associative classification, is that CorClass directly finds the associations rules for classification by employing a branch-and-bound algorithm. Previous techniques (such as CBA [1] and CMAR [2]) <b>first</b> <b>discover</b> all association rules satisfying a minimum support and confidence threshold and then post-process them to retain the best rules. CorClass is experimentally evaluated and compared to existing associative classification algorithms such as CBA [1], CMAR [2] and rule induction algorithms such as Ripper [3], PART [4] and C 4. 5 [5]. ...|$|R

Filoviruses are filament-like viruses that cause viral hemorrhagic fever, and include ebolaviruses and marburgviruses. Marburg virus, <b>first</b> <b>discovered</b> in 1967, attracted widespread press attention in April 2005 for an outbreak in Angola. Ebola Virus Disease has also caused intermittent outbreaks with high mortality rates since 1976 when it was first identified. The worst and most recent one is the West Africa epidemic.|$|E
