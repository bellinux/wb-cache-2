5|$|Labradors like to eat, {{and without}} proper <b>exercise</b> <b>can</b> become obese. Laziness is a {{contribution}} to this. Obesity is a serious condition and can be considered the number one nutritional problem with dogs. A study shows that at least 25% of dogs in the United States are overweight. Therefore, Labradors must be properly exercised and stimulated. A healthy Labrador can do swimming wind sprints for two hours, and should keep a very slight hourglass waist and be fit and light, rather than fat or heavy-set. Obesity can exacerbate conditions such as hip dysplasia and joint problems, {{and can lead to}} secondary diseases, including diabetes. Osteoarthritis is very common in older, especially overweight, Labradors. A 14-year study covering 48 dogs by food manufacturer Purina showed that Labradors fed to maintain a lean body shape outlived those fed freely by around two years, emphasising the importance of not over-feeding. Labradors should be walked twice a day for at least half an hour.|$|E

5000|$|Where appropriate, {{orthoptic}} <b>exercises</b> <b>can</b> be used {{to attempt}} to restore binocularity.|$|R
5000|$|Adding ankle {{weights to}} any <b>exercises</b> <b>can</b> be done as {{progress}} {{is made in}} rehabilitation.|$|R
25|$|Weight lifting - {{such as the}} {{improperly}} performed deep squat, is also {{dangerous to}} the lower limbs, because the <b>exercise</b> <b>can</b> lead to an overextension, or an outstretch, of our ligaments in the knee and can cause pain over time.|$|E
25|$|Underweight/inactive: Bone {{remodeling}} {{occurs in}} response to physical stress, so physical inactivity can lead to significant bone loss. Weight bearing <b>exercise</b> <b>can</b> increase peak bone mass achieved in adolescence, and a highly significant correlation between bone strength and muscle strength has been determined. The incidence of osteoporosis is lower in overweight people.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect of}} {{physical}} activity {{is not limited to}} vascular effects. Physical activity can give rise to new neurons in the brain, as well as releasing a substance that can protect them. The protein known as brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) is known to be important in the development, survival and plasticity of neurons. Regular <b>exercise</b> <b>can</b> boost BDNF levels by 2-3 times.|$|E
50|$|Some {{free weight}} <b>exercises</b> <b>can</b> be {{performed}} while sitting or lying on an exercise ball.|$|R
5000|$|Physlet-based <b>exercises</b> <b>can</b> {{be used as}} part {{of almost}} any {{curriculum}} with almost any teaching style.|$|R

25|$|During fire {{suppression}} actives a firefighter can reach peak or near peak heart rates which {{can act as}} a trigger for a cardiac event. For example, tachycardia can cause a plaque build up to break loose and lodge itself is {{a small part of the}} heart causing myocardial infarction, also known as a heart attack. This along with unhealthy habits and lack of <b>exercise</b> <b>can</b> be very hazardous to firefighter health.|$|E
25|$|Twin {{studies have}} {{estimated}} that approximately 20-30% {{the variation in}} human lifespan {{can be related to}} genetics, with the rest due to individual behaviors and environmental factors which can be modified. Although over 200 gene variants have been associated with longevity according to a US-Belgian-UK research database of human genetic variants, these explain {{only a small fraction of}} the heritability. A 2012 study found that even modest amounts of leisure time physical <b>exercise</b> <b>can</b> extend life expectancy by as much as 4.5 years.|$|E
25|$|The Wirehaired Vizsla {{thrives on}} attention, exercise, and interaction. It is highly intelligent, and enjoys being {{challenged}} and stimulated, both mentally and physically. Vizslas {{that do not}} get enough attention and <b>exercise</b> <b>can</b> easily become destructive or hyperactive. Under-stimulated Vizslas may also become depressed or engage in obsessive-compulsive behaviours such as persistent licking (Coffman 1992). Vizslas are very gentle dogs that are great around children. The Vizsla wants {{to be close to}} its owner as much of the time as possible. Many Vizslas will sleep in bed with their owners if allowed, burrowing under the covers.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Prolonged {{immobilization}} {{results in}} several physiological problems. It {{has been demonstrated}} that standing <b>exercises</b> <b>can</b> ameliorate many of these problems. Standing <b>exercises</b> <b>can</b> be performed efficiently {{with the help of}} functional electrical stimulation (FES). A novel robotic mechanism which aids the unsupported standing of paraplegics, providing balancing exercise has been developed. The balancing strategy is based on voluntary activity of the paraplegic’s upper body and artificially controlled stiffness in the ankles...|$|R
50|$|An air force, {{due to its}} nature, usually limits live fire {{exercises}} to the air, although bombing <b>exercises</b> <b>can</b> be conducted as well.|$|R
5000|$|Core {{exercises}} primarily involve {{dynamic and}} static contraction {{of the back}} and abdominal muscles. Core <b>exercises</b> <b>can</b> aid with improved balance and overall stability.|$|R
25|$|Curvature of the back, called roaching, {{might be}} caused by patella {{problems}} with the rear legs, which in turn causes the dog to lean forward onto the forelegs. This might also just be a structural fault with little consequence to the dog. Many Bostons cannot tolerate excessive heat and also extremely cold weather, due to the shortened muzzle, so hot or cold weather combined with demanding <b>exercise</b> <b>can</b> bring harm to a Boston Terrier. A sensitive digestive system is also typical of Boston Terriers. In the absence of good quality, proper diet, flatulence {{is associated with the}} breed. Their large and prominent eyes make Boston Terriers prone to corneal ulcers.|$|E
25|$|<b>Exercise</b> <b>can</b> cause {{a release}} of {{potassium}} into bloodstream by {{increasing the number of}} potassium channels in the cell membrane. The degree of potassium elevation varies with the degree of exercise, which range from 0.3 meq/L in light exercise to 2 meq/L in heavy exercise, with or without accompanying ECG changes or lactic acidosis. However, peak potassium levels can be reduced by prior physical conditioning and potassium levels are usually reversed several minutes after exercise. High levels of adrenaline and noradrenaline have a protective effect on the cardiac electrophysiology because they bind to beta 2 adrenergic receptors, which, when activated, extracellularly decrease potassium concentration.|$|E
25|$|The burning {{sensation}} in muscles during hard <b>exercise</b> <b>can</b> {{be attributed to}} the release of hydrogen ions during the shift to glucose fermentation from glucose oxidation to carbon dioxide and water, when aerobic metabolism can no longer keep pace with the energy demands of the muscles. These hydrogen ions form a part of lactic acid. The body falls back on this less efficient but faster method of producing ATP under low oxygen conditions. This is thought to have been the primary means of energy production in earlier organisms before oxygen reached high concentrations in the atmosphere between 2000 and 2500 million years ago (see diagram above right), and thus would represent a more ancient form of energy production than the aerobic replenishment of NAD+ in cells.|$|E
50|$|Heat, {{therapeutic}} ultrasound, hot wax {{and short}} wave diathermy are also useful for treating diabetic neuropathy. Pelvic floor muscle <b>exercises</b> <b>can</b> improve sexual dysfunction caused by neuropathy.|$|R
25|$|Various <b>exercises</b> <b>can</b> {{be used to}} {{increase}} an athlete's vertical jumping height. One category of such exercises—plyometrics—employs repetition of discrete jumping-related movements {{to increase}} speed, agility, and power.|$|R
5000|$|This {{contraction}} {{and extension}} together constitute a single [...] As with most weight training exercises, results from biceps <b>exercises</b> <b>can</b> be maximized with {{a proper understanding}} of flexion.|$|R
25|$|Just as <b>exercise</b> <b>can</b> make muscles stronger, {{there are}} signs that regular exertions of {{self-control}} can improve willpower strength. These improvements typically take the form of resistance to depletion, in the sense that performance at self-control tasks deteriorates at a slower rate. Targeted efforts to control behavior in one area, such as spending money or exercise, lead to improvements in unrelated areas, such as studying or household chores. And daily exercises in self-control, such as improving posture, altering verbal behavior, and using one's nondominant hand for simple tasks, gradually produce improvements in self-control as measured by laboratory tasks. The finding that these improvements carry over into tasks vastly different from the daily exercises shows that the improvements are not due to simply increasing skill or acquiring self-efficacy from practice.|$|E
25|$|Exercise is a {{particularly}} potent tool for glucose control in those who have diabetes mellitus. In a situation of elevated blood glucose (hyperglycemia), moderate <b>exercise</b> <b>can</b> induce greater glucose disposal than appearance, thereby decreasing total plasma glucose concentrations. As stated above, the mechanism for this glucose disposal is independent of insulin, which makes it particularly well-suited for people with diabetes. In addition, {{there appears to be}} an increase in sensitivity to insulin for approximately 12–24 hours post-exercise. This is particularly useful for those who have type II diabetes and are producing sufficient insulin but demonstrate peripheral resistance to insulin signaling. However, during extreme hyperglycemic episodes, people with diabetes should avoid exercise due to potential complications associated with ketoacidosis. Exercise could exacerbate ketoacidosis by increasing ketone synthesis in response to increased circulating NEFA's.|$|E
25|$|Sleep hygiene is {{a common}} term {{for all of the}} {{behaviors}} which relate to the promotion of good sleep. These behaviors are used as the basis of sleep interventions and are the primary focus of sleep education programs. Behaviors include the use of caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol consumption, maximizing the regularity and efficiency of sleep episodes, minimizing medication usage and daytime napping, the promotion of regular exercise, and the facilitation of a positive sleep environment. <b>Exercise</b> <b>can</b> be helpful when establishing a routine for sleep but should not be done close to the time that you are planning on going to sleep. The creation of a positive sleep environment may also be helpful in reducing the symptoms of insomnia. In order to create a positive sleep environment one should remove objects that can cause worry or distressful thoughts from view.|$|E
50|$|Balance {{exercises}} {{make use}} of equipment designed to strengthen weak muscles and build up limbs affected by atrophy. These exercises include balancing on physio-balls, wobble boards and balance boards. Balance <b>exercises</b> <b>can</b> be useful in animals recovering from surgery. The animal is forced to place weight on the surgical repair, building muscle in the affected area. These <b>exercises</b> <b>can</b> also be helpful for animals with neurological conditions. For example, an animal recovering from a stroke has decreased coordination and balance which can be improved through a physical therapy regime that includes balance exercises.|$|R

25|$|There {{are many}} {{variations}} of this exercise {{because it is}} such a common and necessary command for a dog. Generally the handler will order the dog to sit and stay and then the judge will order the handler {{to walk away from the}} dog. Depending on the level of the competition the judge will order the handler to: walk around the ring, walk to the other side of the ring and wait for an order to return, or walk out of sight of the dog and wait for an order to return. In the later two cases the length of time before the judge orders the handler to return, and the time the dog must remain sitting, increases depending on the class the team is competing in. This <b>exercise</b> <b>can</b> also be performed in a group where as many as 10 dogs may perform the exercise simultaneously. In any case should a dog break the sit by lying down or getting up to walk around the team will usually fail the exercise and receive a non qualifying score for the class.|$|E
25|$|Pseudohyperkalemia {{occurs when}} the {{measured}} potassium levels is falsely elevated. This condition is usually suspected when patient is clinically well without any ECG changes. Mechanical trauma during blood drawing can cause potassium leakage out of the red blood cells due to haemolysed blood sample. Since <b>exercise</b> <b>can</b> cause elevated potassium levels, repeated fist clenching can cause transient rise in potassium levels. Prolonged length of blood storage can also increase serum potassium levels. Hyperkalemia may only become apparent when a person's platelet concentration is more than 500,000/microL in a clotted blood sample (serum blood sample). Potassium leaks out of platelets after clotting has occurred. On the other hand, processing of heparinised, unclot blood does not cause falsely elevated potassium. In addition to that, high white cell count (greater than 120,000/microL) in patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia increases red blood cells fragility, thus causing pseudohyperkalemia during blood processing. This problem can be avoided by processing serum samples, because formation of clot protect the cells from haemolysis during processing. A familial form of pseudohyperkalemia may also be present, and is characterized by increased serum potassium in whole blood stored at or below room temperature, without additional hematological abnormalities. This is due to increased potassium permeability in red blood cells.|$|E
25|$|Physical {{activity}} is body movement that works your muscles and requires {{more energy than}} resting. According to a blog by the American Intercontinental University, college students should make time for exercise to maintain and increase motivation. AIU states that regular exercise has impeccable effects on the brain. With consistent running routines, there are more complex connections between neurons, meaning the brain is able to access its brain cells more flexibly. By performing well physically, motivation will be present in education because of how well the brain is performing. After exercising, the brain can have more desire to obtain knowledge and better retain the information. In addition, <b>exercise</b> <b>can</b> relieve stress. Exercising can ease anxiety and relieve negative effects of stress on the body. Without stress factors, individuals can perform better and more efficiently, since their minds will have a more positive outlook. This positive mood will help keep students motivated and more open and willing to succeed academically. Lastly, exercise increases focus and concentration that could also help students maintain their motivation and focus on their studies. AIU claims that exercise may have improved the students' ability to participate and retain information during the class after they had exercised. Being able to retain information and being willing to participate keeps students motivated and performing well academically.|$|E
