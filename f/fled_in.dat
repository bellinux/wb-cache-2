5|$|Low, Harris {{and their}} ships left the Azores for the Carolinas. On 10 June 1723, they {{suffered}} a resounding defeat {{in a battle}} with , a heavily armed man of war. Greyhound had been dispatched {{under the command of}} Peter Solgard to hunt down Low and his fleet. Low <b>fled</b> <b>in</b> the Fancy with a skeleton crew and £150,000 in gold on board and headed back to the Azores, leaving Harris and the Ranger behind.|$|E
5|$|On 24 December 1944, Eichmann fled Budapest {{just before}} the Soviets {{completed}} their encirclement of the capital. He returned to Berlin, where he arranged for the incriminating records of Department IV-B4 to be burned. Along with many other SS officers who <b>fled</b> <b>in</b> the closing months of the war, Eichmann {{and his family were}} living in relative safety in Austria when the war in Europe ended on 8 May 1945.|$|E
5|$|Washington's defeat {{revealed}} his deficiencies as a strategist who split his forces, his inexperienced generals who misunderstood the situation, and his raw troops that <b>fled</b> <b>in</b> disorder {{at the first}} shots. However, his daring nighttime retreat has been seen by some historians {{as one of his}} greatest military feats. Other historians concentrate on the failure of British naval forces to prevent the withdrawal.|$|E

5|$|At {{first the}} Dutch were winning the action, but after {{they put in}} {{disorder}} two or three Spanish squadrons, Paulo Emilio Martinengo charged ahead his company on their flank and in turn routed a Dutch squadron, which allowed Córdoba to regroup his troops and renew the attack, this time with success. Despite the stubborn resistance offered by the Dutch troops, they were finally broken and <b>fled</b> <b>in</b> a disorderly fashion, attempting to save themselves before the Lippe river. Córdoba sent his cavalry to follow them up, and they found {{that some of the}} Dutch soldiers, having been unable to find a good place to ford the river, had drowned. The Spanish captives were freed, and the spoils taken by the Dutch recovered.|$|E
5|$|Basiliscus <b>fled</b> <b>in</b> {{the heat}} of the battle. One half of the Roman fleet was burned, sunk, or captured, and the other half {{followed}} the fugitive Basiliscus. The whole expedition had failed. Heraclius effected his retreat through the desert into Tripolitania, holding the position for two years until recalled; Marcellinus retired to Sicily, where he was reached by Basiliscus; the general was, however, assassinated, perhaps at the instigation of Ricimer, by one of his own captains; and the king of the Vandals expressed his surprise and satisfaction, that the Romans themselves would remove from the world his most formidable antagonists.|$|E
5|$|Daksinakaali, also spelled Dakshinakaali, is {{the most}} popular form of Kaali in Bengal. There are various {{versions}} for the origin of the name Dakshinakaali. Dakshina refers to the gift given to a priest before performing a ritual or to one's guru. Such gifts are traditionally given with the right hand. Daksinakaali's two right hands are usually depicted in gestures of blessing and giving of boons. One version of the origin of her name comes from the story of Yama, lord of death, who lives in the south (daksina). When Yama heard Kali's name, he <b>fled</b> <b>in</b> terror, and so those who worship Kali are said to be able to overcome death itself.|$|E

5|$|Historically, two {{paths of}} the native {{indigenous}} peoples ran along parts of White Deer Hole Creek. Settlers arrived by 1770, but <b>fled</b> <b>in</b> 1778 during the American Revolutionary War. They returned and the creek served as the southern boundary of Lycoming County when it was formed on April 13, 1795. A logging railroad ran along the creek from 1901 to 1904 for timber clearcutting, and small-scale lumbering continues. During World War II a Trinitrotoluene (TNT) plant, which became a federal prison in 1952, {{was built in the}} watershed. Most development is in the eastern end of the valley, with two unincorporated villages, a hamlet, and most of the farms (many Amish).|$|E
5|$|In his 1931 study, Mavrodinov {{also writes}} {{that at the}} time, the church lacked a roof. He {{references}} {{a story about a}} group of Circassians that were settled in Sapareva Banya on the order of the Ottoman authorities after the Crimean War (1853–1856). According to that story, the Circassians sought to pull down the church's roof. However, one of them fell to his death inside the church, so they <b>fled</b> <b>in</b> horror. The church was thoroughly reconstructed in 1937 by a team under architect Rashenov.|$|E
5|$|Just as {{the battle}} began, the Swedish {{flagship}} Kronan sank, taking with it almost the entire crew, including the Admiral of the Realm and commander of the Swedish navy, Lorentz Creutz. The allied force {{under the leadership of}} the Dutch admiral Cornelis Tromp took full advantage of the ensuing disorder on the Swedish side. The acting commander after Creutz's sudden demise, Admiral Claes Uggla, was surrounded and his flagship Svärdet battered in a drawn-out artillery duel, then set ablaze by a fire ship. Uggla drowned while escaping the burning ship, and with the loss of a second supreme commander, the rest of the Swedish fleet <b>fled</b> <b>in</b> disorder.|$|E

5|$|On February 10, 1825, Cofresí plundered the sloop Neptune. The {{merchant}} ship, with a {{cargo of}} fabric and provisions, was attacked while its dry goods were unloaded at dockside in Jobos Bay. Neptune {{was owned by}} Salvador Pastorisa, who was supervising the unloading. Cofresí began the charge in a sloop, opening musket fire on the crew, and Pastoriza <b>fled</b> <b>in</b> a rowboat. Despite a bullet wound, Pastoriza identified four of the eight to ten pirates (including Cofresí). An Italian living in Puerto Rico, Pedro Salovi, was reportedly second-in-command during the attack. The pirates pursued and shot those who fled. Cofresí sailed Neptune out of Jobos Port, a harbor in Jobos Bay (near Fajardo), and adopted the sloop as a pirate ship.|$|E
5|$|On February 17, 1859, the French {{warships}} {{opened fire}} on the citadel with artillery. This attack focused on the southeastern corner of the citadel, {{where most of the}} Vietnamese artillery had been installed. The Vietnamese artillery commanders had miscalculated and had set up their cannons incorrectly, firing at excessively high angles. The cannons were not easily adjusted and thus the Vietnamese firepower was misdirected and ineffective. At around 10:00, Captain Des Pallieres led 300 French soldiers in an infantry attack. They used bamboo ladders to scale the walls under artillery support from the river. The defenders were caught off guard by this manoevre and many <b>fled</b> <b>in</b> chaos.|$|E
5|$|The 24th Regiment linked {{up with a}} Highlander {{battalion}} on its {{far right}} and along with the 13th Landwehr regiment and cavalry support threw the French out of these positions. Further attacks by the 13th Landwehr and the 15th Brigade drove the French from Frichermont. Durutte's division, finding itself about to be charged by massed squadrons of Zieten's I Corps cavalry reserve, retreated from the battlefield. The soldiers of D’Erlon's Corps alongside this attack on Durutte's division also broke and <b>fled</b> <b>in</b> panic, while to the west the French Middle Guard were assaulting Wellington's centre. The Prussian I Corps then advanced towards the Brussels road and the only line of retreat available to the French.|$|E

5|$|The French column, {{despite the}} harassment, {{managed to take}} control of the bridge and started to cross to the {{opposite}} bank of the Fluvià. The miquelets and armed peasants, however, fired on them from the south and killed up to 70 French soldiers. According to Charles Sévin, marquis de Quincy, a contemporary French artillery general and military historian of Louis XIV's reign, Juigné's corps was able to retreat to Olot in good order. On the other hand, the local 19th-century Catalan historian Esteve Paluzie i Cantalozella claimed that the French troops <b>fled</b> <b>in</b> disarray, leaving 150 prisoners to the Catalans, which they carried to Sant Esteve d'en Bas under a heavy escort.|$|E
5|$|The Romans {{spent the}} next two days {{scouting}} the surrounding area and on the third day they met the Galatian army consisting of 50,000 men. The Romans started the battle by attacking with their skirmishers. The Galatian centre shattered at the first attack and <b>fled</b> <b>in</b> the direction of the camp. The flanks stood their grounds for longer but were eventually forced to retreat. The Romans chased them, plundered the Galatian camp as the surviving Galatians fled across the river to join the women, children and the Trocmi.|$|E
5|$|The SAF was {{initially}} {{made up of}} the Army, Navy, Air Force and Police Force. In the post-independence period, it grew to become among the larger militaries in Africa. Due to Barre's increasing reliance on his own clans, repressive policies, and the Somali Rebellion, the military had by 1988 begun to disintegrate. By the time President Siad Barre <b>fled</b> <b>in</b> 1991, the armed forces had dissolved. As of January 2014, the security sector is overseen by the Federal Government of Somalia's Ministry of Defence, Ministry of National Security, and Ministry of Interior and Federalism.

5|$|The {{loss of the}} Admiral's {{flagship}} {{threw the}} Swedish forces into disorder, and soon Svärdet, next in line as fleet flagship, was surrounded by the allied admirals and set ablaze by a Dutch fireship after an extended artillery duel. Only 50 of the 650-strong crew escaped the gun battle and the inferno, and among the dead was the acting Admiral Claes Uggla. After losing two of its highest ranking commanders {{as well as its}} two largest ships, the Swedish fleet <b>fled</b> <b>in</b> disarray. Solen later ran aground; Järnvågen, Neptunus and three smaller vessels were captured. Äpplet later sank after breaking her moorings off Dalarö.|$|E
5|$|The retreat {{was made}} even more serious {{by the fact that}} the gendarmes, tasked with {{stabilising}} the front and catching deserters, also <b>fled</b> <b>in</b> panic. The town itself was badly damaged, and the commanding officer of the 46th Regiment, Colonel Bronisław Krzywobłocki, was forced to order the retreat of the remainder of his forces south-west from the town. The rest of the division had no option but to fall back to the line of First World War trenches. During the chaotic withdrawal all the artillery sub-units got lost. By 19:00 hours the town was in Russian hands.|$|E
5|$|Their {{motives for}} {{escaping}} evolved over time. Those who <b>fled</b> <b>in</b> the years {{shortly after the}} Wall was built had experienced the formerly open border first-hand and often had relatives in the West or had traveled there. By contrast, later escapees {{had grown up with}} the closed border, desired greater freedom and were dissatisfied with conditions in East Germany. Their attempts to escape were often triggered by specific events such as a wish to avoid conscription, repression by the authorities or the refusal of a request to emigrate. Many escapees had previously clashed with the state authorities and had been imprisoned for political offenses, often related to earlier unsuccessful escape attempts.|$|E
