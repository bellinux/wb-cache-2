40|$|Abstract: In this article, we are {{discussing}} the Gauss’s law {{used to determine the}} width <b>emitter</b> extension <b>region</b> of the solar cell operating in open circuit condition. Taking into account the grain size (g), the grain boundary recombination velocity (Sgb) and the emitter doping density (Nemitter), the Gauss’s Law helped us to calculate the width <b>emitter</b> extension <b>region</b> of the solar cell operating in open circuit condition. To determine the width <b>emitter</b> extension <b>region,</b> we first showed that grain size (g), grain boundary recombination velociy (Sgb) are oppesite effects and concluded that best solar cells are characterized by low junction extension region width observed only with high grain size (g) and low grain boundary recombination velocity (Sgb). In a second way using Gauss’s law, we deduced that the ratio R of the width <b>emitter</b> extension <b>region</b> on the base extension region is equal to the ratio of the base doping density to emitter 15 − 3 doping density. We concluded that when N < 1. 5 ⋅ 10 cm, the ration R is practically emitter 16 − 3 16 − 3 constant and when 10 cm ≤ N emitter ≤ 5 ⋅ 10 cm the ration R variation is soft and we finely saw that the emitter contribution to the photoccurent can be neglected for emitter doping density greater than 10 17 cm- 3.

The <b>emitter</b> <b>regions</b> are located at the rear surface {{in order to be}} contacted by a continuous metal film without penalizing in shadowing losses, while the front surface shows a typical finger grid configuration with the base contacts under the metal. In a previous work, the reported efficiency was limited by optical losses at the front planar surface. As a consequence, we focus on the introduction of a texturized front surface to the device. Firstly, we characterize the contact formation by laser processing on texturized surfaces by SEM image showing that the size of the contacted region is difficult to determine. By measuring contact resistance and surface recombination velocity, we deduce that the laser process of such surfaces leads to a contacted region which is smaller than the one where passivation is lost. The obtained information is included in 3 D simulations to get the optimum size of the contacts, i. e. optimum laser power. Additionally, a new front grid metallization is introduced in order to reduce shadowing. Due to the rear emitter configuration of these devices, front surface recombination is crucial for collecting photogenerated carriers. Thus, optimum laser power is very close to the minimum to obtain a reliable contact. Finally, 2 x 2 cm 2 solar cells are fabricated with a best efficiency of 17. 0 %...|$|R

Since the BOSCO cell’s rear side exhibits p-doped as well as highly n+-doped surfaces the dielectric used as rear-side passivation needs to be suitable to passivate both polarities. This work compares the passivation of the BOSCO cell’s rear side by a PECVD aluminium oxide (AlOx) and a thermally grown silicon oxide (SiO 2). A difference in efficiency of up to = 0. 5 %abs occurs between BOSCO cells with AlOx and SiO 2 passivation, with the AlOx passivated solar cells achieving better cell performance. The difference in efficiency is dominated by a loss in fill factor of up to FF = 1. 6 %abs for cells with SiO 2 passivation compared to AlOx passivated cells. An investigation of the suns-Voc characteristics shows that this loss is mainly caused by increased recombination at lower injection, which strongly affects the pseudo fill factor.
