40|$|It is {{well known}} that a Dirichlet <b>form</b> <b>on</b> a fractal {{structure}} can be defined as the limit of an increasing sequence of discrete Dirichlet <b>forms,</b> defined <b>on</b> finite subsets which fill the fractal.

In this paper, I prove that, provided an eigenform exists, even if the <b>form</b> <b>on</b> V-(0) is not an eigenform, the corresponding sequence of discrete forms converges to a Dirichlet <b>form</b> <b>on</b> all of the fractal, both pointwise and in the sense of Gamma-convergence (but these two limits can be different).
