2500|$|According to this {{indicator}} on improved water sources, the MDG was met in 2010, {{five years}} ahead of schedule. Over 2 billion more people used improved drinking water sources in 2010 than did in 1990. However, the job is far from finished. 780 million people are still without improved sources of drinking water, and many more still lack safe drinking water: complete information about drinking water safety is not yet available for <b>global</b> <b>monitoring</b> of safe drinking water. Estimates suggest that at least 25% of improved sources contain fecal contamination and an estimated 1.8 billion people globally use a source of drinking water which suffers from fecal contamination. The quality of these sources vary over time and are typically of worse quality in the wet season. Continued efforts [...] are needed to reduce urban-rural disparities and inequities associated with poverty; to dramatically increase coverage in countries in sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania; to promote <b>global</b> <b>monitoring</b> of drinking water quality; and {{to look beyond the}} MDG target towards universal coverage.|$|E

2500|$|As of 2010, the {{literacy}} rate of females in Pakistan was at 39.6 percent {{compared to that}} of males at 67.7 percent. [...] More recent statistics provided by the UNICEF - shows that female education amongst 15-24 year olds has increased substantially to 61.5% - an increase of 45%. Male education is at a steady rate of 71.2%. The objectives of education policies in Pakistan aim to achieve equality in education between girls and boys and to reduce the gender gap in the educational system. [...] However, the policy also encourages girls, mainly in rural areas of Pakistan, to acquire basic home management skills, which are preferred over full-scale primary education. [...] The attitudes towards women in Pakistani culture make the fight for educational equality more difficult. [...] The lack of democracy and feudal practices of Pakistan also contribute to the gender gap in the educational system. [...] This feudal system leaves the underpowered, women in particular, in a very vulnerable position. [...] The long-lived socio-cultural belief that women play a reproductive role {{within the confines of the}} home leads to the belief that educating women holds no value. Although the government declared that all children of the ages 5–16 can go to school, there are 7.261 million children out of school at the primary level in Pakistan, and 58% are female (UNESCO, Education for All <b>Global</b> <b>Monitoring</b> Report 2011). Although girls have the right to get an education legally, in many rural regions of Pakistan girls are strongly discouraged from going to school and discriminated against, as there are violent acts such as acid throwing which many girls fall victim to for attending school.|$|E
