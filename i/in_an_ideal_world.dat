ReTaClasses was simulated using one, three, and five classes (denoted, respectively, GridTS 1, GridTS 3, and GridTS 5) and WQR using only two replicas (denoted WQR 2 X). MFTF used accurate information about resources, something difficult to be obtained in the real world. All simulations used the same value for the grid speed, i.e., for {{the sum of the}} resources speeds: 1, 000. The resource speed represents how fast it can execute a task. A resource with speed 5 can execute a task with size 100 in 20 time units. We also used a fixed value for the job size: 6, 000, 000 time units. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>ideal</b> <b>world,</b> the makespan of this job would be 6, 000 time units, i.e., 100 hours, if the unit was the minute.

Make {{some effort}} to remember, {{so far as}} may be {{possible}} to you, either what you felt in yourselves when you were young, or what you have observed in other children, of the action of thought and fancy. Children are continually represented as living <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>ideal</b> <b>world</b> of their own. So far as I have myself observed, the distinctive character of a child is to live always in the tangible present, having little pleasure in memory, and being utterly impatient and tormented by anticipation: weak alike in reflection and forethought, but having an intense possession of the actual present, down to the shortest moments and least objects of it; possessing it, indeed, so intensely that the sweet childish days are as long as twenty days will be; and setting all the faculties of heart and imagination on little things, so as {{to be able to make}} anything out of them he chooses. Confined to a little garden, he does not imagine himself somewhere else, but makes a great garden out of that; possessed of an acorn-cup, he will not despise it and throw it away, and covet a golden one in its stead: it is the adult who does so. The child keeps his acorn-cup as a treasure, and makes a golden one out of it in his mind; so that the wondering grown-up person standing beside him is always tempted to ask concerning his treasures, not, [...] "What would you have more than these?" [...] but [...] "What possibly can you see in these?" [...] for, to the bystander, there is a ludicrous and incomprehensible inconsistency between the child's words and the reality. The little thing tells him gravely, holding up the acorn-cup, that [...] "this is a queen's crown, or a fairy's boat," [...] and, with beautiful effrontery, expects him to believe the same. But observe--the acorn-cup must be there, and in his own hand. [...] "Give it me;" [...] then I will make more of it for myself. That is the child's one word, always.|$|E

Why had he been created with faculties so exquisite, to be left thus unused and unfruitful? The feeling of his own quality, with this of a certain injustice and waste superadded, brought warm tears which he loved to let flow. Visions of the past, from girl playmates of his youth down to the Venetian courtesan, thronged in fluttering tumult into his brain. He saw himself surrounded by a seraglio of houris whom he had known, until his blood was all aflame and his head in a whirl. His imagination was kindled into deadly activity. [...] "The impossibility of reaching to the real beings plunged me into the land of chimera; and seeing nothing actual that rose to the height of my delirium, I nourished it <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>ideal</b> <b>world,</b> which my creative imagination had soon peopled with beings after my heart's desire. In my continual ecstasies, I made myself drunk with torrents of the most delicious sentiments that ever entered the heart of man.

I had such a passion for haunting this empyrean with all its charming objects, that I passed hours and days in it without counting them as they went by; and losing recollection of everything else, I had hardly swallowed a morsel in hot haste, before I began to burn to run off in search of my beloved groves. If, when I was ready to start for the enchanted world, I saw unhappy mortals coming to detain me on the dull earth, I could neither moderate nor hide my spleen, and, no longer master over myself, I used to give them greeting so rough that it might well be called brutal."[263] ...|$|E

Blackburn rates Nietzsche as “currently the most influential of the great philosophers” and there is certainly an arguable case for that assessment. Nietzsche is regarded as the bad boy of philosophy, the writer who speaks the unspeakable. But his ideas have been taken up by philosophers who came after him like no other. His views (along with Kierkegaard’s) lead to existentialism.

40|$|To achieve faculty status, graduating {{doctoral}} {{students have to}} substantially outperform their peers, given the competitive nature of the academic job market. <b>In</b> <b>an</b> <b>ideal,</b> meritocratic <b>world,</b> factors such as prestige of degree-granting university ought not to overly influence hiring decisions. However, it has recently been reported that top-ranked universities produced about 2 - 6 times more faculty than did universities that were ranked lower [1], which the authors claim suggests the use of un-meritocratic factors in the hiring process: how could students from top-ranked universities be six times more productive than their peers from lower-ranked universities? Here we present a signal detection model, supported by computer simulation and simple proof-of-concept example data from psychology departments in the U. S., to demonstrate that substantially higher rates of faculty production need not require substantially (and unrealistically) higher levels of student productivity. Instead, a high hiring threshold due to keen competition is sufficient to cause small differences in average student productivity between universities to result in manifold differences in placement rates. Under this framework, the previously reported results are compatible with a purely meritocratic system. Whereas these results do {{not necessarily mean that}} the actual faculty hiring market is purely meritocratic, they highlight the difficulty in empirically demonstrating that it is not so...|$|R

They separate, at the session's end, one to smoke cigars about a watering-place, the other to resume the labours of the field beside his peasant family.

The overall foci of this research can be divided into two parts. On one hand we are interested in what kind of violence young people (14 to 20 years old) encounter and what constitutes as violence in their minds. On the other hand, we are interested in exploring the effects violence has on young people’s experiences and how they construe the relation between gender and violence. This is still work in progress but I want to present you here with part of the results from our analysis of the media. Moore argues that “violence of all kinds is engendered in its representation, in the way it is thought about and constituted as a social fact ” (1994 : 70). In our research we are concerned with the gendered ways violence speaks to its audience in the public sphere which, <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>ideal</b> feminist <b>world,</b> should belong equally to every individual (Kappeler, 1995 : 32).

30|$|Acute {{appendicitis}} (AA) is {{a disease}} with a high prevalence, requiring rapid and accurate diagnosis to confirm or exclude perforation. It {{is the most common}} abdominal emergency and has a lifetime prevalence of about 7  % [1]. The clinical diagnosis remains difficult, both in the paediatric and adult population, as the presentation is often atypical [2]. Symptoms are frequently non-specific and overlap with various other diseases [3]. Despite all improvements in clinical and laboratory diagnosis and the publication of various scoring systems to guide clinical decision-making, the fundamental decision whether to operate or not remains challenging. <b>In</b> <b>an</b> <b>ideal</b> medical <b>world,</b> we would like to optimally diagnose and treat all patients with suspected AA without unnecessary appendectomies. As AA with perforation is associated with significant morbidity and <b>an</b> increase <b>in</b> mortality [2], there is broad agreement that high rates of negative appendectomies (around 15  %) have to be accepted {{in order to reduce the}} rate of perforation [2, 3]. A negative appendectomy might not only expose the patient to the risk of the surgical procedure. Recently, a higher risk of acute myocardial infarction related to surgical removal of the tonsils and appendix before age 20 has been reported [4]. Further studies are needed, as the authors point out, but subtle alterations in immune function following these operations may alter the cardiovascular risk [4].|$|R

However, when working with real NGS data this sort of naive approach is not used, as it cannot account for the noise in the input data. The nucleotide counts used for base calling contain errors and bias, both due do the sequenced reads themselves, and the alignment process. This issue can be mitigated to some extent by sequencing to a greater depth of read coverage, however this is often expensive, and many practical studies require making inferences on low coverage data.|$|R

For reviewers, who cannot opt not to make such checks, VS is even more tedious. We advocate that journals using VS in print should use HS for the reviewing process; further, in the final printed version, the references should be numbered and listed alphabetically rather than according to the order in which they are cited. Especially for maturing scientists, reading texts with HS referencing is essential...|$|R

However, today’s scientists do not only produce traditional research papers – they produce comprehensive digital resources and collections. TIB’s mission is to develop a supportive framework for a sustainable access to such digital content – focusing on areas of engineering as well as architecture, chemistry, information technology, mathematics and physics. The term digital content comprises all digitally available resources such as audiovisual media, databases, texts, images, spreadsheets, digital lab journals, multimedia, 3 D objects, statistics and software code. In executing this mission, TIB provides services for the management of digital content during ongoing and for finished research. This includes:   - a technical and administrative infrastructure for indexing, cataloguing, DOI registration and licensing for text and digital objects, namely the TIB DOI registration which is active since 2005,   - the administration of the ORCID DE consortium, an institutional network fostering the adoption of ORCID across academic institutions in Germany,   - training and consultancy for data management, complemented with a digital repository for the deposition and provision of accessible, traceable and citable research data (RADAR),   - a Research and Development Department where innovative projects focus on the visualization and the sustainable access to digital information, and   - the development of a supportive framework within the German research data community which accompanies the life cycle of scientific knowledge generation and transfer. Its goal is to harmonize (meta) data display and exchange primarily on a national level (LEIBNIZ DATA project) ...|$|R
40|$|Researchers observing {{associations}} {{between age and}} political attitudes have frequently puzzled over what such relationships mean. Do they reflect aging or political maturation processes that occur over the life cycle or do they reflect differences between age cohorts or political generations? Cross-sectional sample survey data, {{the most common form}} of evidence available, is notoriously impotent in the face of such questions, since for the most part any observed correlation between age and political attitudes could be consistent with either explanation. Ideally, what is needed to address the issue appropriately is longitudinal panel data, in which the same individuals are monitored over a substantial period of time. Panel studies, however, are not only extremely rare but seldom run for the length of time required to allow for robust monitoring of age-related changes. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> less than <b>ideal</b> <b>world,</b> <b>an</b> alternative data source is repeated cross-section studies spread out over a significant period.

40|$|Individual Development Accounts are {{designed}} to support savings {{for the purchase of}} specific assets, such as buying a home, pursuing post-secondary education, or capitalizing a small business, by matching the deposits of program participants. The concept of matched savings has been promoted as a means to broaden asset ownership among populations missed by current policy. Recently, a study was released evaluating the ten-year impacts of a specific Individual Development Accounts program in Tulsa, Oklahoma focused on increasing homeownership. This paper provides commentary on the findings of this new research, raises questions about the state of homeownership as a means of achieving economic security, and critiques the existing policy tools for supporting low-income families to climb up the economic ladder. In the real world, problems are usually more abundant than the resources to address them. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> more <b>ideal</b> <b>world,</b> possible solutions could be assessed for their effectiveness so that limited resources could be leveraged to their fullest potential. This, of course, is easier said than done. We know the real world is complicated, but even the <b>ideal</b> <b>world</b> can be messy. It is hard to design meaningful experiments and implement interventions faithfully, and the opportunity to observe subsequent impacts is often limited to particular moments in time. These are perennial challenges for social science. Despite these limitations, there is much to be learned from striving for the elusive <b>ideal.</b> <b>A</b> randomized experimental design is the gold standard for testing impacts because it can distinguish a “treatment ” group that receives the intervention from a “control ” group that does not. In the real world, this may be as close as we can get to the ideal. This approach was used to assess the impacts of a specific Individual Development Account (IDA) program i...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} was to explore the question of humanitarian intervention’s agency from the theoretical perspective of cosmopolitanism. Cosmopolitanism is critical {{about the role of}} states in protecting individuals’ rights and thus questions whether the world should be organized around sovereign states system. <b>In</b> <b>an</b> <b>ideal</b> cosmopolitan <b>world</b> order without sovereign states, there would be no states and thus no need to intervene. In the non-ideal world, however, human rights violations are still present and thus humanitarian interventions are a necessity. Central to the discussion of this dissertation is the dilemma of applying <b>an</b> <b>ideal</b> theory to the problems of the non-ideal world. This dissertation sets out to identify the theoretical challenges that cosmopolitanism aces when applying its ideal principles to the problem of humanitarian intervention. The major objective of this thesis was to clarify how cosmopolitans approach the issue of right agent for humanitarian intervention. Cosmopolitanism calls for extensive reforms in the global order to handle more effectively the question of large-scale fundamental human rights abuses present in the imperfect world order. Thus the {{purpose of this}} thesis is to explore the possible alternatives to the current governance of humanitarian intervention from the perspective of cosmopolitanism, by asking who would be the most legitimate agent to authorize and undertake a humanitarian intervention. With that aim, the thesis identified the premises underlying the cosmopolitan conception of humanitarian intervention, and analyzed the arguments of the leading contemporary cosmopolitan thinkers and weighed them critically against one another. The findings of this dissertation suggest that cosmopolitanism provides normative guidance for the non-ideal world by (1) establishing the ideal global order and (2) offering guidelines to approximate that <b>ideal.</b> <b>As</b> according to cosmopolitanism the agents for humanitarian intervention in the real world lack legitimacy, they propose reforms to create the ideal agents, which would offer a much more effective protection of human rights. However the theoretical exploration conducted in the dissertation suggested that this needs to be approached with caution since there are certain limitations involved when applying the ideal theory to the non-ideal world...|$|R
40|$|Reconstructions of summer, winter or {{annual mean}} {{temperatures}} {{based on the}} species composition of bio-indicators such as pollen, foraminifera or chironomids are routinely used in climate model–proxy data comparison studies. Most reconstruction algorithms exploit the joint distribution of modern spatial climate and species distribution {{for the development of}} the reconstructions. They rely on the space-for-time substitution and the specific assumption that environmental variables other than those reconstructed are not important or that their relationship with the reconstructed variable(s) should be the same in the past as in the modern spatial calibration dataset. Here we test the implications of this “correlative uniformitarianism” assumption on climate reconstructions <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>ideal</b> model <b>world,</b> <b>in</b> which climate and vegetation are known at all times. The alternate reality is a climate simulation of the last 6000  years with dynamic vegetation. Transient changes of plant functional types are considered as surrogate pollen counts and allow us to establish, apply and evaluate transfer functions in the modeled world. We find that in our model experiments the transfer function cross validation r 2 is of limited use to identify reconstructible climate variables, as it only relies on the modern spatial climate–vegetation relationship. However, ordination approaches that assess the amount of fossil vegetation variance explained by the reconstructions are promising. We furthermore show that correlations between climate variables in the modern climate–vegetation relationship are systematically extended into the reconstructions. Summer temperatures, the most prominent driving variable for modeled vegetation change in the Northern Hemisphere, are accurately reconstructed. However, the amplitude of the model winter and mean annual temperature cooling between the mid-Holocene and present day is overestimated and similar to the summer trend in magnitude. This effect occurs because temporal changes of a dominant climate variable, such as summer temperatures in the model's Arctic, are imprinted on a less important variable, leading to reconstructions biased towards the dominant variable's trends. Our results, although based on a model vegetation that is inevitably simpler than reality, indicate that reconstructions of multiple climate variables based on modern spatial bio-indicator datasets should be treated with caution. Expert knowledge on the ecophysiological drivers of the proxies, as well as statistical methods that go beyond the cross validation on modern calibration datasets, are crucial to avoid misinterpretation...|$|R
