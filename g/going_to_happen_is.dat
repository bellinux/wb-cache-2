500|$|Suzuki {{did not use}} storyboards and disliked pre-planning. He {{preferred}} {{to come up with}} ideas either the night before or on the set as he felt that the only person who should know what is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>is</b> the director. He also felt that it was sudden inspiration that made the picture. An example is the addition of the Number Three Killer's rice-sniffing habit. Suzuki explained that he wanted to present a quintessentially [...] "Japanese" [...] killer, [...] "If he were Italian, he'd get turned on by macaroni, right?" [...] Suzuki has commended Shishido on his similar drive to make the action scenes as physical and interesting as possible. In directing his actors, Suzuki let them play their roles as they saw fit and only intervened when they went [...] "off track". For nude scenes the actors wore maebari, or adhesive strips, over their genitals in accordance with censorship practices. The film was edited in one day, a task made easy by Suzuki's method of shooting only the necessary footage. He had picked up the habit during his years working as an assistant director for Shochiku when film stock remained sparse after the war. Post-production was completed on June 14, 1967, the day before the film was released.|$|E
500|$|Upon Burton's casting, it was {{revealed}} by MSN that Dylan, who was described as [...] "the mysterious ex Avery keeps bringing up" [...] by Jillian Bowe of Zap2it, {{would be involved in}} a love triangle with his ex-girlfriend Avery Bailey Clark (Jessica Collins) and her current lover, Nicholas Newman (Joshua Morrow). Of Dylan's storyline and involvement in the love triangle, Phelps said: [...] "Dylan does come to town to find Avery but this story has much more complexity than that [...] What you think is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>is</b> not what's going to happen." [...] She noted that Avery was the [...] "great love of his life", though she may not have [...] "the same feelings for him." [...] Avery believed that Dylan died during war; TVLine commented that [...] "such a resurrection" [...] would [...] "surely" [...] derail her romance with Nick. During an interview with MSN, Burton said, [...] "Nick and Dylan will definitely fight for her, but ultimately, it's going to be her choice." [...] Dylan and Avery had an affair while she was still married to her ex-husband, but still had a [...] "great relationship", which was shown through flashbacks. Dylan's primary goal in coming to Genoa City was to make sure she was happy, and if she wanted to get back together. Burton said that Dylan can't get Avery off his mind {{despite the fact that she}} had moved on.|$|E

'Prayer {{does not}} mean that {{whatever}} is prayed for will necessarily be granted, for if this be the meaning of acceptance of prayer, two difficulties would arise: First, thousands of prayers are offered with great humility and in extreme anguish, and yet the wish is not granted.

This definition ensures that leadership is talking about the future and includes the fundamental concerns of the relevant parties.

In 2011 Harry was featured in a storyline that saw his fathers girlfriend, Rachel McKenna (Angela Bloomfield) illegally discipline him when she smacked him. Rachel was an inexperienced parent and as such, Bloomfield had to forget her own maternal nature, [...] "As a mum, my responses are now automatic. So when I was playing Rachel in this role, I tried to forget about what now comes naturally as a parent ... Rachel eventually breaks, and that's when she smacks him.

50|$|On 26 May 2014, GMA Pinoy TV {{began to}} air Niño with no episode delay whatsoever, thus premiering {{on the same}} day. This is a {{historical}} event for GMA Pinoy TV, as GMA drama series have never aired without episode delays. The nearest to not having a delay was the one-episodedelay policy that was established on 14 February 2012 with the premiere of My Beloved. What is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>is</b> in the North American feed {{as well as on}} the Australian feed, the premiere of Niño and subsequent new episodes on same-day airing will take place on the evening telecast and replays in the afternoon telecasts while in other feeds, particularly, the Middle East and North Africa, Asia Pacific and European feeds, the premiere and subsequent new episodes will take place in the afternoon telecasts and replays on evening telecasts, thus because these telecasts will take place in the afternoon, such is still not considered delayed, as a new episode of the show still has not premiered. This similar framework followed with Ang Dalawang Mrs. Real, which premiered on 2 June airing on same-day basis as well along with Strawberry Lane on 15 September and Hiram na Alaala on 22 September. Ilustrado, the first BayaniSerye on Philippine Primetime, had a world premiere on all feeds of GMA Pinoy TV on 20 October 2014; this was simultaneous with the premiere in the Philippines and this is the first time such has happened in GMA Pinoy TV history.|$|E
50|$|Heaton was {{initially}} interested in earthquake prediction. However, {{one of the}} implications of his now accepted pulse like model for earthquake ruptures is that predicting when an earthquake is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>is</b> very difficult if not impossible. This is because it does not require that the background stress on the fault plane to be uniformly high everywhere in order to initiate rupture as pulse like ruptures can propagate in relatively low background stress. Accordingly, stresses need only to be high at isolated locations which may not be accessible to direct observation as those locations are not apriori known. However, the pulse like rupture mode has an inherent merit; it implies that the slip at any point ceases within {{a short period of time}} after the passage of the rupture front at this location and long before the whole earthquake stops. Since scaling relations between slip and total rupture length exist, the pulse like model implies that it may be possible to predict, at least in a probabilistic sense, how long the earthquake rupture could be once the slip values at some points are recorded and in the pulse like model we can have information about final slip values shortly after the initiation of rupture. This opens new premises in the field of earthquake early warnings. The virtual seismologist, which is an innovative earthquake early warning technique, is an example of the achievements of Heaton's group in that field.|$|E
