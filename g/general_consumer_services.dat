40|$|This study {{examines}} {{whether there is}} herding by general equity unit trusts as investors in the <b>consumer</b> <b>services</b> sector in South Africa. It also investigates whether herding was more prevalent during the financial crisis period in South Africa between 2008 and 2010, than during a non-crisis period. Using a herding measure developed by Lakonishok, Shleifer and Vishny (1992) (LSV), {{it was found that}} there was indeed herding behaviour by general equity unit trusts in the <b>consumer</b> <b>services</b> sector. A herding rate (i. e. the proportion of trades by general equity unit trusts in the <b>consumer</b> <b>services</b> sector in excess of the expected random and independent proportion) of 7. 75 % is calculated. Possible reasons for herding in the <b>consumer</b> <b>services</b> sector include; <b>consumer</b> <b>services</b> companies being profitable investments and a small number of investment analysts in South Africa. It was also observed that herding behaviour was not more prevalent during the financial crisis period (12. 14 %) than the non-crisis period (6. 36 %), as these two periods were not statistically different from one another, even though the average herding rates differed...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that in the {{developed}} countries food safety standards are higher than ever, food safety incidents continue to occur frequently. The accumulation of food safety incidents might affect <b>general</b> <b>consumer</b> confidence in the safety of food. Therefore, in this thesis, the concept of <b>general</b> <b>consumer</b> confidence in the safety of food is further conceptualised, and embedded within an integrative framework that incorporates both its antecedents and consequences. <b>General</b> <b>consumer</b> confidence in the safety of food is determined by 1) consumer trust in societal actors, 2) consumer recall of food safety incidents and media coverage, 3) the perceived safety of different product groups, and 4) socio-demographic and personality characteristics. The behavioural consequences of <b>general</b> <b>consumer</b> confidence relate to information search and particular food choice behaviours. A measure for <b>general</b> <b>consumer</b> confidence in the safety of food is developed, showing that the construct consists of two distinct, although correlated, dimensions: optimism and pessimism. In the thesis, the construct of <b>general</b> <b>consumer</b> confidence in the safety of food is validated within its nomological network. The results show that optimism and pessimism are activated by different sources, and that consumer trust in societal actors, and consumer perceptions of the safety of meat are the strongest determinants of <b>general</b> <b>consumer</b> confidence in the safety of food. The framework is shown to be stable over time, and found to be applicable to an international context. In terms of the relationship between <b>general</b> <b>consumer</b> confidence in the safety of food and its behavioural consequences, it is shown that <b>consumers</b> low in <b>general</b> confidence in the safety of food are more likely to revert to specific risk relief strategies. A more in depth analysis of the role of trust in societal actors in shaping <b>general</b> <b>consumer</b> confidence in the safety of food, shows that the strength of the relationship between trust and <b>general</b> <b>consumer</b> confidence in the safety of food depends on the specific food chain actor, the specific dimension of trust, as well as the specific combinations between actors and different dimensions of trust. Overall, this thesis has extended existing research that largely focused on consumer perceptions of specific food-related hazards, by developing and validating an integrative framework of <b>general</b> <b>consumer</b> confidence in the safety of food. This research informs stakeholders that share responsibility on food safety about how confidence develops in the complex environment of the food production system, and provides risk managers and communicators, as well as other stakeholders, with important insights and tools to better respond to consumer concerns about food safety issues...|$|R
