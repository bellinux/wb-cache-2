25|$|The {{arrangement}} of plates and dielectric has many variations {{depending on the}} desired ratings of the capacitor. For small values of capacitance (microfarads and less), ceramic disks use metallic coatings, with wire leads bonded to the coating. Larger values {{can be made by}} multiple stacks of plates and disks. Larger value capacitors usually use a metal foil or metal film layer deposited on the surface of a dielectric film to make the plates, and a dielectric film of <b>impregnated</b> <b>paper</b> or plasticthese are rolled up to save space. To reduce the series resistance and inductance for long plates, the plates and dielectric are staggered so that connection is made at the common edge of the rolled-up plates, not at the ends of the foil or metalized film strips that comprise the plates.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIron gall inks (IGI) {{were largely}} used for writing until the nineteenth century. Under certain circumstances, they provoke a {{substantial}} degradation of their cellulosic support. It {{was shown in}} a previous works that combination of oxygen and iron largely impacts cellulose chain breaking occurring in acidic conditions (pH 3 – 4).

40|$|Melamine {{formaldehyde}} (MF) resins {{are widely}} used for the gluing and surface coating of wood-based consumer products in the interior design of living environments. MF resins are especially relevant in decorative laminate applications because of their good performance-to-price ratio. In their industrial processing, an important intermediate state is the liquid MF prepolymer that is used for decorative paper impregnation. Here, the drying of <b>impregnated</b> <b>papers</b> is investigated with respect to premature curing. A new method to quantify water release upon drying that allows estimation {{of the degree of}} undesired precuring is described. Since curing proceeds via polycondensation, crosslinking brings about the release of water molecules. By thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), drying was studied in terms of water release due to physical drying (elimination of “dilution water”) and chemical crosslinking of the prepolymer to a three-dimensional MF network (elimination of chemically liberated water). The results obtained by TGA/IR spectroscopic analysis of the liberated volatiles show that the emission of water from b-stage MF can be clearly analytically separated into a physical (evaporation of dilution water) and a chemical (liberation via condensation) sequence. TGA experiments were correlated with curing experiments performed with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to estimate the residual crosslinking capacities of the <b>impregnated</b> <b>papers.</b> The drying conditions used during the preparation of <b>impregnated</b> decorative <b>papers</b> seemed to significantly affect their remaining reactivity only when harsh drying conditions were used.

40|$|International audiencePaper {{degradation}} by iron gall ink is {{a challenging}} {{issue for the}} conservation of ancient manuscripts. It is usually attributed to both FeII catalyzed oxidation and acid catalyzed hydrolysis of cellulose, yet the dominant degradation pathway remains an open question. In this work, electron spin resonance spectroscopy (ESR) was used to identify radicals involved in cellulose degradation. <b>Papers</b> <b>impregnated</b> with iron salts were put in contact with an aqueous solution of DMPO (spin-trap) and analyzed by ESR. No DMPO-OH center dot adducts were detected while the addition of formate, an intermediary target molecule, led on the contrary to the detection of a significant amount of DMPO-CO 2 center dot- adducts. This reveals the predominant occurrence of reactive oxygen species (ROS) other than hydroxyl radicals (most likely superoxide or hydroperoxyl radicals). The production of DMPO-CO 2 center dot- adducts was found to be oxygen dependent and to originate mainly from ferrous ions lixiviated from the <b>impregnated</b> <b>papers.</b> At high iron loads (above 1 mmol L- 1), it was shown that quantification of these adducts should be done with great care because of a competing formation of hydroxylamine that jeopardizes the ESR signal. Complementary TPA hydroxylation measurements performed by HPLC on ink and iron sulfate <b>impregnated</b> <b>papers</b> revealed some production of hydroxyl radicals but at a concentration several orders of magnitude below that of the ROS detected with formation of DMPO-CO 2 center dot- adducts. This HO center dot production was moreover not correlated with cellulose chain scissions, indicating that autooxidation by these radicals is not the main mechanism of cellulose depolymerisation in presence of iron gall ink...|$|R

5000|$|Trespa {{plate is}} made by {{compressing}} <b>impregnated</b> <b>paper</b> or wood fibers and epoxy, phenolic or polypropylene resin at high pressure and high temperature. A special surface made with Electronic Beam Curing, a coating technique developed by Trespa, ensures durability and scratch resistance. Due {{to the ability to}} add colored pigments to the surface during curing, a variety of colors are possible. The production technique for the plates, which are made of wood, is also called [...] "Dry Forming" [...] technology. In this technique, cheaper pre-pregs instead of the more expensive <b>impregnated</b> <b>paper</b> layers in the production of fiber boards is applied.

Also, any contamination, such as graffiti, can be removed quite easily.
