5|$|So far, the {{investigation}} {{had been on}} the natural frequency of transient oscillation of a resonant circuit resulting from a sudden stimulus. More important {{from the point of view}} of filter theory is the behaviour of a resonant circuit when driven by an external AC signal: there is a sudden peak in the circuit's response when the <b>driving</b> <b>signal</b> frequency is at the resonant frequency of the circuit. James Clerk Maxwell heard of the phenomenon from Sir William Grove in 1868 in connection with experiments on dynamos, and was also aware of the earlier work of Henry Wilde in 1866.

25|$|As the {{particle}} bunch {{passes through the}} tube it is unaffected (the tube acts as a Faraday cage), while {{the frequency of the}} <b>driving</b> <b>signal</b> and the spacing of the gaps between electrodes are designed so that the maximum voltage differential appears as {{the particle}} crosses the gap. This accelerates the particle, imparting energy to it in the form of increased velocity. At speeds near the speed of light, the incremental velocity increase will be small, with the energy appearing as an increase in the mass of the particles. In portions of the accelerator where this occurs, the tubular electrode lengths will be almost constant.|$|E
500|$|There are a {{great many}} {{combinations}} of resonators and transducers {{that can be used}} to construct a mechanical filter. A selection of some of these is shown in the diagrams. Figure 6 shows a filter using disc flexural resonators and magnetostrictive transducers. The transducer drives the centre of the first resonator, causing it to vibrate. The edges of the disc move in antiphase to the centre when the <b>driving</b> <b>signal</b> is at, or close to, resonance, and the signal is transmitted through the connecting rods to the next resonator. [...] When the <b>driving</b> <b>signal</b> is not close to resonance, there is little movement at the edges, and the filter rejects (does not pass) the signal. Figure 7 shows a similar idea involving longitudinal resonators connected together in a chain by connecting rods. In this diagram, the filter is driven by piezoelectric transducers. It could equally well have used magnetostrictive transducers. Figure 8 shows a filter using torsional resonators. In this diagram, the input has a torsional piezoelectric transducer and the output has a magnetostrictive transducer. This would be quite unusual in a real design, as both input and output usually have the same type of transducer. The magnetostrictive transducer is only shown here to demonstrate how longitudinal vibrations may be converted to torsional vibrations and vice versa. Figure 9 shows a filter using drumhead mode resonators. The edges of the discs are fixed to the casing of the filter (not shown in the diagram) so the vibration of the disc is in the same modes as the membrane of a drum. Collins calls this type of filter a disc wire filter.|$|E
