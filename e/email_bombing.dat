50|$|Lennon, a 16-year-old teenager, was {{employed}} by Domestic & General Group PLC (D&G) {{for three months}} until he was dismissed in December 2003. In January 2004, Lennon downloaded from the Internet a mail bombing program, the Avalanche v3.6, {{and used it to}} bombard D&G with emails. <b>Email</b> <b>bombing</b> is the action whereby a program deliberately sends large numbers of emails to a particular email address within a business and {{is an example of a}} DoS attack whereby multiple requests are made with objective to slow down or disable a network.|$|E
5000|$|Mass mailing {{consists}} of sending numerous duplicate mails {{to the same}} email address. These types of mail bombs are simple to design but their extreme simplicity means they can be easily detected by spam filters. Email-bombing using mass mailing is also commonly performed as a DDoS attack by employing the use of [...] "zombie" [...] botnets; hierarchical networks of computers compromised by malware and under the attacker's control. Similar to their use in spamming, the attacker instructs the botnet to send out millions or even billions of emails, but unlike normal botnet spamming, the emails are all addressed to only {{one or a few}} addresses the attacker wishes to flood. This form of <b>email</b> <b>bombing</b> is similar in purpose to other DDoS flooding attacks. As the targets are frequently the dedicated hosts handling website and email accounts of a business, this type of attack can be just as devastating to both services of the host.|$|E
50|$|Mailboxes have a size limit, either {{determined}} implicitly by available memory, {{or after}} quota definitions for that mailbox or folders thereof. Besides administrative trivia, quota limits help mitigate <b>email</b> <b>bomb</b> attacks.|$|R
50|$|In Internet usage, an <b>email</b> <b>bomb</b> {{is a form}} of net abuse {{consisting}} of sending huge volumes of email to an address in an attempt to overflow the mailbox or overwhelm the server where the email address is hosted in a denial-of-service attack.|$|R

A separate four-count indictment charges Mr. Busby with, on 20 and 21 June, maliciously conveying false information through the Internet claiming bombs had been placed at federal courthouses in Pennsylvania in Pittsburgh, Erie and Johnstown.|$|R
40|$|Today {{internet}} {{is full of}} web security threats such as phishing attack, <b>Email</b> <b>bombing,</b> Trojan virus etc., the hackers are increasing in number day by day. They invent new techniques to steal data and confidential information. Here a hybrid approach to launch a phishing attack is proposed. We use Trojan horse, <b>email</b> <b>bombing,</b> data stealing to perform phishing attack. Such approach is a eye open for all people to have an idea, {{so that they can}} prevent and avoid threats. 1...|$|E
40|$|E-mail {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used ways of written {{communication}} over the internet, and its traffic has increased exponentially with the advent of World Wide Web. The increase in email traffic comes also with an increase in the use of emails for illegitimate purpose. Phishing, Spamming, <b>email</b> <b>bombing,</b> threatening, cyber bullying, racial vilification, terrorist activities, child pornography and sexual harassment are common examples of e-mail abuses. So, there is a need for e-mail mining. Various methods and approaches were used by the scientists for classification of email messages in above categories. In this paper we are presenting various techniques and approaches used by researchers for email mining and subsequent classification...|$|E
40|$|Today, Cybercrime {{has caused}} lot of damages to individuals, {{organizations}} {{and even the}} Government. Cybercrime detection methods and classification methods have came up with varying levels of success for preventing and protecting data from such attacks. Several laws and methods have been introduced {{in order to prevent}} cybercrime and the penalties are laid down to the criminals. However, the study shows that there are many countries facing this problem even today and United States of America is leading with maximum damage due to the cybercrimes over the years. According to the recent survey carried out it was noticed that year 2013 saw the monetary damage of nearly 781. 84 million U. S. dollars. This paper describes about the common areas where cybercrime usually occurs and the different types of cybercrimes that are committed today. The paper also shows the studies made on e-mail related crimes as email is the most common medium through which the cybercrimes occur. In addition, some of the case studies related to cybercrimes are also laid down.

It's believed the event could be connected to Anonymous. Non-related copyright or law firms sites, such as websheriff.com, were also attacked. These attacks were originally organized through an Internet Relay Chat channel. The attacks also became a popular topic on Twitter.|$|R
5000|$|On his {{personal}} PC, Trafford {{has set up}} an <b>email</b> <b>bomb</b> (containing a pr√©cis of the Theory of Evolution) which he tricks Sandra Dee into releasing under the pretense that it contains a love-letter from him to her. When being tied to the stake, Trafford notices a girl waving an Ev Love ("evolve" [...] backwards) banner, showing that she received the e-mail. He goes to his death in hope of a better world, reasoning that a society which promotes ignorance over knowledge and values mediocrity will inevitably die out and [...] "evolve" [...] into one that values knowledge and excellence.|$|R

40|$|Pre-information age {{military}} battlefields {{are based}} on the traditional land, sea, air, and space paradigm. Global internetworking is causal {{to the creation of a}} dangerously real 5 th Dimension of Warfare - Cyberspace. This paper describes an Internet based assault, commonly referred to as e-mail spam, on the Langley AFB internetworking infrastructure. We discuss the cyber-attack, a framework for defending against the attack, and the results of the campaign. The countermeasure was accomplished by running the MTA in a mode which accepts and queues SMTP mail; processes the messages with a rules-based filter; and then forwards mail after filtering. The filtering framework is simple and effective for a large subset of <b>email</b> <b>bombs.</b> The prototype filter scripts may be obtained from the authors. INTRODUCTION E-mail is extensively used for the exchange of numerous types of messages in the military environment. From low value questions and staff summaries to messages bordering on command and co [...] ...|$|R
5000|$|The Intervasion of the UK was a 1994 {{electronic}} {{civil disobedience}} and collective action against John Major's Criminal Justice Bill {{which sought to}} outlaw outdoor dance festivals and [...] "music with a repetitive beat". Launched by a group called The Zippies from San Francisco's 181 Club on Guy Fawkes Day, November 5, 1994, it resulted in government websites going down {{for at least a}} week. It utilised a form of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) known as the <b>Email</b> <b>bomb</b> in order to overload servers as a form of online protest and Internet activism. It was the first such use of the Internet and technology as a weapon of struggle and/or civil disobedience, and preceded the 1995 Italian NetStrike. This fact has yet to be acknowledged by the Electronic Disturbance Theater which claims to have pioneered the technique or the Free Range Electrohippies in the United Kingdom, who appear to have taken most of the credit for the event.|$|R
50|$|Unlike <b>email</b> spam, Twitter <b>bombs</b> {{may require}} {{participation}} from their targeted users. Fake accounts {{are a common}} source of Twitter bombs. In order to avoid Twitter's spam filters and to overcome their lack of followers, Twitter bombs are often sent as a reply to existing tweets about the same topic. This is done in hopes that {{the authors of the}} existing tweets will retweet the response to their own followers, spreading the Twitter bomb before the fake account is deleted.|$|R
