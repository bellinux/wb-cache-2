5000|$|Private Snafu {{has learned}} a secret, but the enemy is {{listening}} and he'd better zipper his lip. However, Snafu - little by little - lets his secret slip (by telling the audience, calling his mom, and drunkenly relaying it to a bar girl {{who works as a}} Nazi spy): His ship is about to set sail for Africa at 4:30. The information is picked up by spies and quickly relayed to Adolf Hitler, who orders the Nazis to attack the American fleet - which they do, shooting Snafu with torpedoes when he falls in the water after yelling for the ship to go [...] "full speed ahead" [...] to escape. He then ends up in Hell boiling in a cauldron, demanding to know who leaked the secret. Adolf Hitler as well as Hitler's staff then appear as demons and reveal that he gave away the secret he was entrusted to keep, and then show him a mirror that reveals a <b>horse's</b> <b>butt.</b>|$|R

You wish the {{contents}} of the pouch I wear about my waist, and I wish my life and my liberty even more than I do the jewels. Let us each, then, take that which he most desires and go our separate ways in peace. I will lay the pouch upon the carcass of my horse, where you may see it, and you, in turn, will lay your gun upon your <b>horse,</b> with <b>butt</b> toward me. Then I will go away, leaving the pouch to you, and you will let me go in safety. I want only my life, and my freedom." ...|$|R

Also, Egy fenékkel nem lehet két lovat megülni - It {{is impossible}} to ride two <b>horses</b> with one <b>butt.</b> (The meaning {{is similar to the}} Romanian translation.)

You do not look to me like a new-married man, for that {{marriage}} is not natural when the bridegroom rides off and leaves the bride of an hour. Perhaps you will never be really married after all, for God, Who gives sons-in-law, can also take them away, especially when He was not asked for them. Ah!" [...] he went on, lapsing into French, as was his wont when moved, [...] "qui vivra verra! qui vivra verra!" [...] Then, shouting this excellent but obvious proverb {{at the top of his}} voice, he struck his <b>horse</b> with the <b>butt</b> of his gun, and galloped away before I could answer him.|$|R
6000|$|Pleasant riding it is, though, if {{you dare}} look {{anywhere}} but over your horse's nose, under the dark roof between the red fir-pillars, in that rich subdued light. Now I plunge into a gloomy dell, wherein is no tinkling rivulet, ever pure; but instead a bog, hewn {{out into a}} chess-board of squares, parted by deep narrow ditches some twenty feet apart. Blundering among the stems I go, fetlock-deep in peat, and jumping at every third stride one of the said uncanny gripes, half hidden in long hassock grass. Oh Aira caespitosa, most stately and most variable of British grasses, why will you always grow where you are not wanted? Through you the mare all but left her hind legs in that last gripe. Through you a red-coat ahead of me, avoiding one of your hassocks, jumped with his <b>horse's</b> nose full <b>butt</b> against a fir-stem, and stopped, ...|$|R
2500|$|When matters quieted down, Frank Grouard and [...] asked American Horse {{again if}} they {{would come out of}} the hole before any more were shot, telling them they would be safe if they surrendered. “After a few minutes deliberation, the chief, American Horse, a fine looking, broad-chested Sioux, with a {{handsome}} face and a neck like a bull, showed himself {{at the mouth of the}} cave, presenting the butt end of his rifle toward the General.

[...] The chieftain’s intestines protruded from his wound, but a squaw, his wife perhaps, tied her shawl around the injured part, and then the poor, fearless savage, never uttering a complaint, walked slowly to a little camp fire, occupied by his people about 20 yards away, and sat down among the women and children.” ...|$|R
