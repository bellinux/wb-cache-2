500|$|The {{home button}} on the iPhone 5S {{incorporates}} a fingerprint recognition system known as Touch ID, based on technology from AuthenTec, a company which Apple had acquired in 2012. The sensor uses a capacitive CMOS-based sensor which can detect the [...] "sub-epidermal layers" [...] of fingers at 500 pixels per inch, and uses a 360-degree design that can read the print at any angle. The sensor itself is activated by a touch-sensitive metallic ring surrounding the button. Touch ID {{can be used for}} various authentication activities within the operating system, such as unlocking the device or authenticating App Store and iTunes purchases instead of an Apple ID password. The sensor can be trained to recognize the fingerprints of multiple fingers and multiple users. <b>Fingerprint</b> <b>data</b> is stored in an encrypted format within a [...] "secure enclave" [...] of the A7 chip itself, and is not accessible to any other apps or servers (including iCloud).|$|E

By using the genotypes of the tested cultivars (Table  4 showed), everyone could decide which primers to use to identify two cultivars, nevertheless, it would be not so straightforward but it would be done using a little more time to analyze the <b>fingerprinting</b> <b>data</b> in discriminating the tested tea cultivars. The CID directly allowed separation of cultivar sample at each step, and the whole identification process was displayed, which differed from the phylogeny tree and was an extension of the <b>fingerprinting</b> <b>data.</b> For these reasons, the CID method was a kind of useful complements to the phylogeny tree and <b>fingerprinting</b> <b>data</b> when used to quickly identify tea cultivars.|$|R

SSR with long-core motifs (tri-, tetra-, penta-, and hexa-nucleotide) are preferred since neighbor alleles are more easily separated and identified from each other. Short-core motifs (di-nucleotide) are not desirable {{mainly because of the}} lower separation of neighbor alleles and the high degree of stuttering, which render the interpretation of electropherograms and the true alleles less reliable (Cipriani et al. 2008). SSR with long-core motifs were adopted in human genetics (Ruitberg et al. 2001; Butler et al. 2004; Butler 2006; Hellmann et al. 2006), but were exclusively used for genetic analyses only in few crops (Dettori et al. 2015). In tea plant, there have been reported that eight core SSRs with the larger repeat motifs (3 – 6  bp) selected to fingerprint 128 Chinese clonal tea cultivars (Tan et al. 2015), nevertheless, it would require a little more time to analyze the <b>fingerprinting</b> <b>data</b> using these SSR markers in discriminating tea cultivars, furthermore, these markers would be not enough to exclusively identify tea cultivars, especially when more new cultivars would be released in future.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{methods for}} assigning codewords {{for the purpose}} of <b>fingerprinting</b> digital <b>data</b> (e. g., software, documents, and images). Fingerprinting consists of uniquely marking and registering each copy of the data. This marking allows a distributor to detect any unauthorized copy and trace it back to the user. This threat of detection will hopefully deter users from releasing unauthorized copies. A problem arises when users collude: For digital <b>data,</b> two different <b>fingerprinted</b> objects can be compared and the differences between them detected. Hence, a set of users can collude to detect the location of the fingerprint. They can then alter the fingerprint to mask their identities. We present a general fingerprinting solution which is secure in the context of collusion. In addition, we discuss methods for distributing <b>fingerprinted</b> <b>data.</b> 1 Introduction <b>Fingerprinting</b> is an old cryptographic technique.

40|$|Background and objectives: Traditional polyherbal oils {{are still}} in use in Persian Traditional Medicine (PTM). Most of these {{formulations}} are prepared via traditional procedures such as maceration of herbs in oils or evaporating aqueous herbal extracts in boiling or heating oils as the vehicle. Thus, their quality control, standardization and authentication are real challenges {{due to the lack}} of scientific studies.   The present study provided data and methods to authenticate some of these oils and has compared applicability of different fingerprinting methods for their authenticity. Methods: Thirteen oils were prepared according to the traditional manuscripts. High performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC), ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) <b>fingerprinting</b> <b>data</b> were analyzed using MATLAB software. For HPTLC fingerprints a special coding system was designed according to the Rf values. The <b>fingerprinting</b> <b>data</b> were subjected to principal components (PCs) analysis. Melting point and thermal behavior of the oils were obtained by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Also, the refractive indices, acid and peroxide values were obtained for the oils. Results: The designed coding system for HPTLC was successfully able to produce a discriminative unique fingerprint for each sample. Among UV, IR and HPTLC fingerprinting, the last one seemed more reliable than others to authenticate the oils. The acid values (0. 22 - 3. 85), peroxide values (2. 31 - 34. 35 meq/kg) and refractive indices (1. 4622 - 1. 4706) were in acceptable ranges for most of these oils. Conclusion: Despite lack of knowledge about constituents of traditional polyherbal oils, this study was able to provide some <b>data</b> and <b>fingerprinting</b> methods for their authentication...|$|R
