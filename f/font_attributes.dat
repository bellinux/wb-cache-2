30|$|The above studies {{essentially}} propose {{rules for}} the implementation of the acoustic rendition of specific typographic attributes. It is obvious that a systematic methodology towards the acoustic rendition of typographic signals does not exist. The present work introduces the emotional-based mapping methodology for rendering font cues to auditory modality. The methodology is applied in a case study for font size and style. We determine the acoustic rendition of the <b>font</b> <b>attributes</b> by combining a text font-to-emotional state model and expressive speech synthesis. By conducting a number of psychoacoustic experiments, we determine the acoustic rendition of text font cues.

40|$|Abstract. Font {{specific}} attributes, such as bold, italic {{and case}} {{can be used in}} knowledge mapping and information retrieval to encode addi-tional data in texts, lists and labels to increase data density of visualiza-tions; encode data quantitative data into search lists; and facilitate text skimming and refinement by visually promoting of words of interest. 1 Why <b>Font</b> <b>Attributes?</b> Information visualization (infovis) transforms data into visual representations. In knowledge mapping, visualizations are used to gain insight into the struc-ture of large scale information spaces. In knowledge maps, similar to geographic maps, text should have an inherent role to help viewer comprehend information, however, the use of font-specific attributes, such as bold, italic, caps, etc., in in-fovis is uncommon for encoding additional information. In information retrieval, search results may use a few font-attributes, e. g. bold, underline, serif/sans serif, to differentiate classes of metadata. The goal {{of this paper is to}} illustrate that font-specific attributes can be used to: 1) facilitate skimming texts such as abstracts or lead paragraphs; 2) encode quantitative data using a novel technique of proportional encoding in search results and facets; and 3) encode multiple data attributes in labels. ...|$|E

The works attributed to Hegvald are expressive on the verge of grotesque, somewhat vernacular and typically sculpting covers the whole of the font, including the base and foot.|$|R
40|$|Abstract In this chapter, we {{describe}} an adaptive Indic OCR system implemented {{as part of}} a rapidly retargetable language tool effort and extend work found in [20, 2]. The system includes script identification, character segmentation, training sample creation, and character recognition. For script identification, Hindi words are identified in bilingual or multilingual document images using features of the Devanagari script and support vector machine (SVM). Identified words are then segmented into individual characters, using a font-model-based intelligent character segmentation and recognition system. Using characteristics of structurally similar TrueType fonts, our system automatically builds a model to be used for the segmentation and recognition of the new script, independent of glyph composition. The key is a reliance on known <b>font</b> <b>attributes.</b> In our recognition system three feature extraction methods are used to demonstrate the importance of appropriate features for classification. The methods are tested on both Latin and non-Latin scripts. Results show that the character-level recognition accuracy exceeds 92 % for non-Latin and 96 % for Latin text on degraded documents. This work is a step toward the recognition of scripts of low-density languages which typically do not warrant the development of commercial OCR, yet often have complete TrueType font descriptions...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Every day in {{our life}} we can {{discover}} a lot of optimization problems. By exploring them more deeply we can reveal their fundamentals and think about their solution. The problem of the most attractive font face for the writer is such a problem. The optimization function of this problem is unknown. Beside other methods also interactive evolutionary computation {{could be used to}} solve such type of optimization problems. If we utilize interactive evolutionary computation to find solution we encounter the user fatigue problem. To eliminate this disadvantage we need to accelerate the convergence of the evolutionary computation part. In this article we propose an algorithm that tries to find a candidate solution to the most attractive font face based on input data. We assume that user likes his handwriting properties which is a subject of research for graphology. These handwriting properties will project into properties or attributes of the font face. The algorithm tries to connect Schwartz’s culture model with observations and theoretical knowledge from graphology. It maps the computer <b>font</b> <b>attributes</b> to Schwartz’s culture model using the revealed knowledge from graphology about handwriting. We modified our existing algorithm proposal and we included a learning phase of fuzzy membership function to match a case when user preferences are different from the theory found in graphology. The algorithm is a theoretical proposal to the user fatigue problem in interactive evolutionary computation. ...|$|E
40|$|Number of Pairwise Comparisons. Selecting {{the number}} of {{pairwise}} comparisons n is an important choice when estimating <b>font</b> <b>attributes.</b> If n is too low, the estimated attributes are inaccurate. Exhaustive testing of all pairs (i. e., n = 200) is cost-prohibitive and unnecessary since the attribute values will converge to accurate values after far fewer comparisons. To determine a reasonable n, we ran a smaller study on 5 attributes varying n from 2 to 15. For each n, we evaluated the mean log-likelihood of a testing set of 5 additional comparisons per font. In Figure 1, we show a figure plotting the log-likelihood for n for each attribute. We found the log-likelihood plateaued after n = 8, so we used this value in our final study for the remaining attributes. Modelling Error. In Table 1 we list the error in modelling the pairwise comparisons for each attribute. These results show which attributes are easiest to model (“thin”, and “strong ” for example), {{as well as the}} most difficult (“sharp ” and “boring”). In Fig. 2 we show histograms of 4 different attributes. These histograms show that the attributes being learned have different distributions. User Weights. In Fig. 3 we show a histogram of different user weights. Most users had positive weights, though a few users had negative weights, indicating they generally provided answers opposite to the majority opinion. We also plot the user reliability weights against {{the number of}} HITs completed by the user...|$|E
50|$|Unusually, {{this early}} medieval master stone {{sculptor}} is known by name {{since he has}} signed one of the <b>fonts</b> <b>attributed</b> to him (in Aa Church, on Bornholm island in Denmark) with runes, Sighraf Master.

He was trained locally and his oeuvre displays similarities with earlier stone sculptors from Gotland, e.g. Semi-Byzantios and Majestatis. His style is classical Romanesque with Norse influences.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} interfaces {{for exploring}} large collections of fonts for design tasks. Existing interfaces typically list fonts in a long, alphabetically-sorted menu {{that can be}} challenging and frus-trating to explore. We instead propose three interfaces for font se-lection. First, we organize fonts using high-level descriptive at-tributes, such as “dramatic ” or “legible. ” Second, we organize fonts in a tree-based hierarchical menu based on perceptual similarity. Third, we display fonts that are most similar to a user’s currently-selected font. These tools are complementary; a user may search for “graceful ” fonts, select a reasonable one, and then refine the results {{from a list of}} fonts similar to the selection. To enable these tools, we use crowdsourcing to gather <b>font</b> <b>attribute</b> data, and then train mod-els to predict attribute values for new <b>fonts.</b> We use <b>attributes</b> to help learn a font similarity metric using crowdsourced comparisons. We evaluate the interfaces against a conventional list interface and find that our interfaces are preferred to the baseline. Our interfaces also produce better results in two real-world tasks: finding the nearest match to a target font, and font selection for graphic designs. ...|$|R

Challenges of segmentation The literature often distinguishes between the recognition of isolated and continuous scripts. With isolated scripts, characters are written to be separable (although they may touch due to degradation) while connected scripts can not be easily segmented. Scripts can also be broadly classified based on word-composition into syllabic and nonsyllabic. In non-syllabic scripts, characters are horizontally (or vertically) separable glyphs whereas in syllabic scripts, glyphs appear as syllables, which are in turn a complex combination of one or more characters. Sometimes, characters fuse together to form new shapes, called ligatures (conjuncts) (Figure 1). Cambodian (Khmer) and many South-East Asian scripts are examples of syllabic scripts...|$|E

50|$|Byzantios was {{the first}} of a series of stone sculptors working on Gotland during the Romanesque period of Scandinavian art history. Several others would {{eventually}} follow in his footsteps, e.g. Majestatis, Hegvald and Sigraf. His style is easily recognisable in comparison. The basins of his fonts are always octagonal (as opposed to other masters' circular basins), and his imagery is clearly influenced by Byzantine art in a rather unusual way, e.g. through his treatment of the subject of the Annunciation. Here he depicts Mary spinning yarn for the veil at the temple, a typically Byzantine way of representing the scene. In addition, animals and legendary creatures (including the first depictions of both elephants and camels in Swedish art history) are also popular subjects. Byzantios was furthermore the first artist in the Nordic countries who portrayed human beings in a reasonably correct anatomical way. The pictures on either of the eight sides of the fonts seems to have been executed without any particular connection, although an overarching theme is the conflict between good and evil. Two of the <b>fonts</b> <b>attributed</b> to him, at Garde and Hejde churches, retain traces of original paint.|$|R
50|$|Screen fonts used in EGA and VGA are monospace raster fonts {{containing}} 256 glyphs. All glyphs in a font are {{the same}} size, but this size can be changed. Typically glyphs are 8 dots wide and 8-16 dots high, however the height can be any value up {{to a maximum of}} 32. Each row of a glyph is coded in an 8 bit byte, with high bits {{to the left of the}} glyph and low bits to the right. Along with several hardware-dependent fonts stored in the adapter’s ROM, the text mode offers 8 loadable fonts. Two active font pointers (font A and font B) select two of the available fonts, although they usually point to the same font. When they each point to different <b>fonts,</b> <b>attribute</b> bit 3 (see above) acts as a font selection bit instead of as a foreground color bit. On real VGA hardware this overrides the bit's use for color selection, but on many clones and emulators the color selection remains - meaning one font is displayed as normal intensity, and the other as high-intensity. This error can be overcome by changing the palette registers to contain two copies of an 8-color palette.|$|R

40|$|Since {{the late}} 1970 s, {{a large number}} of {{scientific}} documents have been authored in TeX or its derivations such as LaTeX. These typesetting systems allow anybody to write highquality books and articles. But the TeX syntax is not compatible with HTML or XML. So the WWW consortium 2 ̆ 7 s answer is MathML. The primary goal of MathML is to enable mathematical documents to be communicated, exchanged, and processed on the Web. Therefore, MathML documents are usually embedded with XHTML documents. Currently, there are several XHTML+MathML editors. The most popular editors use two common approaches. The first approach offers a WhatYouSeeIsWhatYouGet (WYSIWYG) interface. But experts often find it is difficult to have precise control. For example, <b>font</b> <b>attribute</b> is determined by the direction of the mouse movement during the event of insertion. The second approach uses a textbased form. The entire document is presented as a treelike structure. The treelike structure is unintuitive and extremely inefficient to comprehend, particularly for twodimensional structures such as tables or equations. Here, I present a WhatYouSeeIsWhatYouNeed (WYSIWYN) editing interface that satisfies the needs of experts who have knowledge of XHML+MathML. The WYSIWYN interface is presented in a form that simultaneously makes editing operations unambiguous and that looks recognizable. It avoids unexpected errors by showing enough structure, but still maintain enough visual presentation to avoid confusion. This report presents a test bench, an XHTML+MathML editor with a new navigation model that demonstrates the WYSIWYN user interface. Similar to a WYSIWYG editor, XHTML+MathML documents can be visualized during editing, and users can check the current XPath position by viewing the status bar. In contrast to the WYSIWYG editor, the new approach offers users the ability to view local structure of the current element with a selected style. In this way, users can magnify any ambiguous positions and still be able to visualize mathematical documents. In addition, the test bench offers multiple WYSIWYN modes with different levels of magnification...|$|R
