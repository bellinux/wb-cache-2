That way each hill would be covered with a single, primary color which represented its spiritual value. This part of their plan never came to fruition, as World War <b>I</b> <b>slowed</b> construction and planning disputes led to Griffin's dismissal by Prime Minister Billy Hughes after the war ended.|$|E
5|$|The four Borodino-class battlecruisers (also {{referred}} to as Izmail class) of the Imperial Russian Navy were all laid down in December 1912 at Saint Petersburg for service with the Baltic Fleet. Construction of the ships was delayed as many domestic factories were already overloaded with orders and some components had to be ordered from abroad. The start of World War <b>I</b> <b>slowed</b> their construction still further as the foreign orders were often not delivered and domestic production was diverted into things more immediately useful for the war effort. The ships were launched in 1915–16, but {{the outbreak of the}} Russian Revolution in 1917 put a stop to their construction, which never resumed. The Soviet Navy gave consideration to completing the ships; initially, Izmail and Borodino were looked at, with a view to finishing one or both to their original design, but the lack of available 12in guns, combined with the complexity of the originally designed electrical system, led to the idea being dropped. Subsequently, plans were raised to complete Kinburn and Navarin to a modified design with 16in guns, which again failed due to the difficulty in either obtaining guns from overseas, or manufacturing them domestically. Subsequent ideas included converting some of the hulls for cargo or passenger use, which again failed. The Navy made a serious proposal in 1925 to convert Izmail, the ship closest to completion, to an aircraft carrier, but this plan was later cancelled as a result of political maneuvering {{on the part of the}} Red Army. Eventually, all four hulls were broken up for scrap; the second, third and fourth were sold to a German company in 1923, while Izmail was broken up in Leningrad in 1931.|$|E
25|$|From 1914 to 1917, {{several more}} oil fields were {{discovered}} {{across the country}} include the emblematic Bolivar Coastal Field; however World War <b>I</b> <b>slowed</b> significant development of the industry. Due to the difficulty in purchasing and transporting the necessary tools and machinery, some oil companies were forced to forego drilling until after the war. By the end of 1917, the first refining operations began at the San Lorenzo refinery to process the Mene Grande field production, and the first significant exports of Venezuelan oil by Caribbean Petroleum left from the San Lorenzo terminal. By the end of 1918, petroleum appeared {{for the first time}} on the Venezuelan export statistics at 21,194 metric tons.|$|E

500|$|Ottman had {{to compose}} {{music for the}} North African battle before the scene was shot, because booking space to record film music is difficult. Although he found that {{composing}} music based on the script results in overlong pieces, he felt the music worked out fine for the sequence. The film's end credits piece, [...] "They'll Remember You", is an original composition, but the lyrics {{were based on the}} poem [...] "Wanderer's Nightsong" [...] by German poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. An end piece entitled [...] "Long Live Sacred Germany" [...] was inspired by Adagio for Strings, in the sense it would not feel like film music tailored to every moment in the scene, but still fit with what was going on. Ottman described the original version of the track as a [...] "three minute drone that <b>I</b> <b>slowed</b> down with these two Tuvan throat singers, the whole thing was this horribly dark, morbid piece [...] left you cold". Ottman composed a metallic motif for Hitler, which was formed by low strings and a piano cluster.|$|E

"My career {{could be}} divided up into two sections: the first being when I was an out-and-out fast bowler and played for England when I {{probably}} {{should not have}} done; and the second being when <b>I</b> <b>slowed</b> down a bit, learned how to swing the ball and did not play for England when I probably should have done. His final Test was only twelve months after his England debut, and his first and last ODIs were played {{less than a month}} apart. Cricket commentator Colin Bateman opined, [...] "his fleeting taste of Test cricket should have been added to in 1987 and 1988 when he was the most consistent fast bowler in the country, taking 194 wickets, but in 1989, when England were desperate for pace bowlers, his omission amounted to wanton neglect by a regime which questioned his desire". In 1988, when Agnew was selected as a Cricketer of the Year, Wisden recorded this verdict on the contrariness of Agnew's Test career: [...] "Asked about Agnew's omission, the chairman of selectors, P. B. H. May, expressed concern about his fitness – rather a baffling statement to make about someone who bowled more overs than any other fast bowler in the Championship." ...|$|E

2500|$|Reflecting on {{his first}} six novels and his rapid writing {{turnover}} later in his career, DeLillo remarked, [...] "I wasn't learning {{to slow down and}} examine what I was doing more closely. I don't have regrets about that work, but I do think that if I had been a bit less hasty in starting each new book, I might have produced somewhat better work in the 1970s. My first novel took so long and was such an effort that once I was free of it I almost became carefree in a sense and moved right through the decade, stopping, in a way, only at Ratner's Star (1976), which was an enormous challenge for me, and probably a bigger challenge for the reader. But <b>I</b> <b>slowed</b> down in the 1980s and '90s." [...] DeLillo has also acknowledged some of the weaknesses of his 1970s works, reflecting in 2007: [...] "I knew I wasn’t doing utterly serious work, let me put it that way." ...|$|E
2500|$|After 1908, the {{completion}} of the North Island Main Trunk Railway meant workers could be transferred north and this improved the rate of construction for a few years. [...] In 1914, the longest bridge on the line, the Otamatea Bridge, was completed with a length of 313 m. [...] However, the outbreak of World War <b>I</b> <b>slowed</b> construction. [...] On 13 March 1913, the line had been opened to Kaiwaka, but the next section to Huarau, including the Otamatea Bridge, was not formally opened until 1 March 1920. [...] At this point, work had also begun on a line south from Whangarei; it opened to Portland on 3 April 1920. [...] Work thus proceeded from both ends to link Huarau and Portland via Waiotira, though this was not without dispute as local interests clamoured for alternate routes. [...] There were debates over whether the line was to be a main line to Whangarei or to Kaitaia and the Far North, and when the line north of the Otamatea Bridge was initially authorised, it was envisaged to run via Waiotira and Kirikopuni as part of a main line to the Far North, with a branch from Waiotira to Whangarei. [...] As it happened, government authorisation was first given for the [...] "branch" [...] from Waiotira to Whangarei; the [...] "main line" [...] via Kirikopuni was formally authorised in 1919 but never built and the branch to Whangarei became the main line. [...] The PWD was able to offer a freight service between Huarau and Portland from 1923, but some parts of the line were only temporary due to difficulties with the terrain. [...] The line was not formally handed over to the Railways Department until 29 November 1925 and the North Auckland Line was finally completed.|$|E

60|$|I {{ran like}} one possessed of devils down that rough slope, {{hurdling}} the stones and {{crashing through the}} brush, with a sound in my ears that was not all the rush of the wind.
