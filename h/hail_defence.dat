50|$|As {{early as}} 1909 Mohorovičić started giving lectures that both architects and {{building}} contractors should follow, {{ahead of his}} time setting some of the basic principles of earthquake-resistant design. Mohorovičić's theories were visionary and were only truly understood many years later from detailed observations of the effects of earthquakes on buildings, deep focus earthquakes, locating earthquake epicenters, Earth models, seismographs, harnessing the energy of the wind, <b>hail</b> <b>defence</b> and other related elements of the geological body of knowledge known as geoscience.|$|E
60|$|Willie, already initiated, {{hoped to}} puzzle papa as a platypus ornithoryncus, but {{was driven to}} allow {{that it was a}} nondescript animal, neither fish, flesh, nor good red-herring, useless, and very fond of {{grubbing}} in the mud; and if it were not at Botany Bay, it ought to be! The laughter that <b>hailed</b> his <b>defence</b> of its nose as 'well, nothing particular,' precipitated the drawing up of the curtain and his apparition in the glass: and then Nora Nugent being called, the inseparable Mary accompanied her, arm-in-arm, simpering an announcement that they liked nothing so well as a pair of dear little love-birds.|$|R
500|$|At the Battle of Jutland, she was {{the first}} ship in the German line, and Hipper's flagship, and drew fire from the British battlecruisers which {{included}} hits below her waterline. Shortly after the start of the battlecruiser action, Lützow hit her opponent Lion several times; one hit knocked out Lions [...] "Q" [...] turret, and the resulting magazine fire nearly destroyed the ship. Shortly after 19:00, the armored cruisers [...] and [...] inadvertently ran into the German line; Lützow opened fire immediately, followed by several German dreadnoughts. In a <b>hail</b> of shells, <b>Defences</b> ammunition magazines detonated and the ship was sunk. At around the same time, the fresh battlecruisers of the 3rd Battlecruiser Squadron engaged their German opposites. Between 19:26 and 19:34, Lützow sustained four 12-inch shell hits in her bow from the British battlecruisers; these eventually proved to be fatal. Despite this, at 19:30, the combined fire of Lützow and her sister Derfflinger destroyed the battlecruiser Invincible. By 20:15, Lützow had been hit five more times, including hits on her two forward turrets.|$|R
