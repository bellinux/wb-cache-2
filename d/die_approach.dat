Timing issues are confined to the cell sizer, allowing the placement algorithm to focus solely on net lengths, resulting in superior layout densities and much lower power. The primary enablers to this new technology are: 1) gridded transistor sizing, 2) variable die routing that allows each net to be routed in the shortest possible length, 3) simultaneous cell placement, routing, gate sizing, and clock tree insertion, and 4) an effective incremental (ECO) placement that preserves net lengths from one iteration to the next. The variable die router is the key enabler. Superior placement and routing densities result from this new variable <b>die</b> <b>approach.</b> In addition, each net is routed at or near minimum length, and thus minor placement changes or cell size changes do not materially impact net lengths...|$|E

Application of DIE and IPE to the complex highly exothermic events represented by decomposition, combustion, thermal explosion, and detonation selectively reveal the key microscopic transient mechanistic features and in some cases, may suggest a mechanistic commonality among these various events. DIE research investigations can identity the actual kinetic rate-limiting chemical reaction step and associated covalent bond rupture responsible for controlling the global energy release rate of a given exothermic event. The <b>DIE</b> <b>approach</b> also suggests the rate-controlling feature can change with the physical state of an energetic compound, {{which in turn is}} determined by an experiment's design and externally applied boundary conditions. The IPE technique supplements DIE findings by showing the extent to which all covalent bonds are ruptured and infer the route of the chemical reactions by which transient species reform into products during an event's overall exothermic process. Additionally, IPE can quantify the extent to which reactive transient species interactions are limited by diffusion in a pure compound or in a mixture of compounds during a detonation event. The unique microscopic mechanistic information obtained from both the DIE and IPE approaches also provides a scientific link between the microscopic and macroscopic behavioral characteristics encountered in the exothermic events of energetic compounds. The condensed phase DIE and IPE approaches are discussed, and cases where they bridge micro-and macroscopic issues are noted...|$|E
40|$|Comparisons of poverty, such {{as where}} or when poverty is greatest, {{typically}} matter far more for policy choices than do aggregate measures of poverty, {{such as how}} many people are deemed poor. We examine alternative methods for constructing poverty profiles, focusing on their internal consistency and appropriateness for guiding policy. None is perfect, but some methods appear to be preferable to others when the aim is to inform policies for fighting absolute-consumption poverty. A case study on Indonesia reveals that the country's regional and sectoral poverty profile is highly sensitive to some aspects of measurement but quite robust to others. When practices in empirical work have a bearing on policy choices, they deserve especially close scrutiny. Constructing a poverty profile showing how the extent of poverty varies across subgroups of a population is typically the first step in formulating an antipoverty policy. Do the assumptions made matter to the policies advocated? This article critically examines popular methods of constructing a poverty profile. We discuss {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the two most common methods of setting poverty lines. Although neither is perfect, we argue that one of these methods is preferable when the poverty profile is intended to inform policies aimed at reducing absolute poverty.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate how the “Drama in Education” (<b>DiE)</b> <b>approach</b> can enhance students’ reading comprehension, and how Chinese Language teachers use DiE to improve students deep understanding of Chinese narrative texts. The whole research program involves 202 Secondary Three students from different bandings, and consists of three Studies. Study 1 is a pre-experimental research, in which the researcher tested her study questions, drama conventions, and developed a reading assessment scheme. Studies 2 and 3 follow the Lesson study approach, integrating the ideas of the jugyokenkyn (lesson study) from Japan, the learning study from Hong Kong, and the practice of lesson research from mainland China. The researcher analyzed four teachers’ teaching practice, their after-class self reflections, teachers and students’ interviews, students’ performances in drama activities, as well as students’ results of pre-and post-tests. Findings show that the teachers changed their reading responses to the texts and their ways to apply DiE to teach. They considered more about text meanings and the characters’ feelings, so their ways of teaching also changed from a conventional to an interactive approach. Moreover, results of students’ pre-and post-tests showed their significant improvements after learning by DiE. According to the researcher’s observations and teachers’ interviews, as a result of seeing evidences of students’ gain, there was a shift in the teachers’ teaching perceptions and teaching behaviors in using new teaching approaches. In this research program, teachers’ use of DiE, and the relevant changes in teaching perceptions and behaviors were analyzed and discussed. The process of using DiE not only benefited students’ reading comprehension, but also enhanced teachers’ professional development. Finally, a model to improve students’ higher-order reading ability through DiE was proposed. Making use of the DiE-reading assessment scheme, and a localized Lesson Study, the researcher hopes to have made some contributions to local educators. published_or_final_versionEducationDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E

40|$|The {{incidence}} of hard errors in CPUs {{is a challenge}} for future multicore designs due to increasing total core area. Even if the location and nature of hard errors are known a priori, either at manufacture-time or in the field, cores with such errors must be disabled {{in the absence of}} hard-error tolerance. While caches, with their regular and repetitive structures, are easily covered against hard errors by providing spare arrays or spare lines, structures within a core are neither as regular nor as repetitive. Previous work has proposed microarchitectural core salvaging to exploit structural redundancy within a core and maintain functionality in the presence of hard errors. Unfortunately microarchitectural salvaging introduces complexity and may provide only limited coverage of core area against hard errors {{due to a lack of}} natural redundancy in the core. This paper makes a case for architectural core salvaging. We observe that even if some individual cores cannot execute certain operations, a CPU die can be instruction-set-architecture (ISA) compliant, that is execute all of the instructions required by its ISA, by exploiting natural cross-core redundancy. We propose using hardware to migrate offending threads to another core that can execute the operation. Architectural core salvaging can cover a large core area against faults, and be implemented by leveraging known techniques that minimize changes to the microarchitecture. We show it is possible to optimize architectural core salvaging such that the performance on a faulty <b>die</b> <b>approaches</b> that of a fault-free die [...] assuring significantly better performance than core disabling for many workloads and no worse performance than core disabling for the remainder...|$|R

Both capillary rheometers were controlled via PCs running dedicated software, and the extrusion line and ELR were fully instrumented allowing real-time process monitoring to be carried out by IBM compatible PCs via data acquisition hardware and software. The prototype OLR was developed by the re-design of several key features including an instrumented transfer section and capillary die block which facilitated the use of various die geometries. Shear and extensional on-line rheometry of three polyethylenes (linear and branched), and four molecular weight grades of polypropylene were examined, and a direct comparison with off-line capillary rheometry showed a good correlation. The effect of a high loading of filler on two of the polyethylenes was investigated. In-line shear stress and entry pressure measurements showed a reasonable correlation with on-line rheometry.
