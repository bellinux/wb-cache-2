5|$|According to Peter Freuchen, {{the scene}} in which the wolf attacks Mala is real. Freuchen says that Mala, armed with {{a rock and a}} pistol beneath his <b>fur</b> <b>jacket,</b> spent three afternoons trying to lure a wolf into attacking him. A rifleman and a cinematographer using a camera with a {{telephoto}} lens followed at a distance. The wolf attack was filmed from far away, with the rifleman ready to shoot the wolf in case Mala was unable to kill it. As shown in film, Mala was able to kill the wolf without using his pistol or relying on the rifleman, and was not injured in the attack.|$|E
5|$|In {{the various}} rooms, she meets men wearing vest tops with their faces painted white with black eyes {{staring at her}} as she passes down the corridor. Later she meets other people in leather and masks, before being {{surrounded}} by a troop of lace-clad dancers. One shot shows a man in colourful clothes and leopard print Speedos surrounded by bubbles in a bathtub. Another room contains a family of four mannequins in a 1960s-styled kitchen, preparing for a plastic-looking meal. A bare African-American is seen dancing and painting herself with a large brush while being almost naked. She is also seen with her legs spread around a TV screen and Beyoncé is seen on it, singing the song. During one scene, Beyoncé performs a dance choreography on a couch along with several other female dancers. Throughout the video, she is seen wearing a tuxedo with a tie, a white <b>fur</b> <b>jacket</b> and platform heels designed by Saint Laurent. The black-and-white jumpsuit she wears is designed by Russian designer Ulyana Sergeenko. Her look is further complete with dark make-up around the eyes and red lipstick while her hair is marcelled and blonde.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} begins with Spears driving a Porsche 928 {{at high speed}} in the Hollywood Hills. She crashes through a fence and lands into a pool inside a manor where a party is taking place. She emerges from the water and crawls in top {{of the car to}} sing the first verse. Spears's brother Bryan makes a cameo in these scenes. After she leaves the pool, she enters the manor and passes couples making out around her. She appears in a {{stainless}} steel kitchen, where a maid cuts the straps of her black wet dress. In the next scene, she walks into a study in which her husband at the time, Kevin Federline, is smoking and watching a black-and-white video of Spears on a projection screen. According to Jennifer Vineyard from MTV, the clip had the style of pornographic films from the 1940s and 1950s. Rolling Stone in their article [...] "Britney Spears: The Complete Video Guide", compared it to Madonna's performances of her 1984 single [...] "Like a Virgin". She then entered a dressing room with mirrors, wearing lingerie, high heels, stockings and a short <b>fur</b> <b>jacket.</b> She proceeds to a bedroom, in which a black dress is laid out on the comforter. She puts on the new dress and the camera cuts to the party outside where people gathered waiting. During the song's bridge, it is revealed that the party is actually Spears's wedding, as she starts walking towards the aisle and Federline waits next to a priest. The video ends with a shot of the black-and-white video and Spears looking into the camera. The black-and-white footage was released as an alternate version of the music video in the 2004 DVD [...]|$|E

"We {{must take}} to our <b>fur</b> <b>jackets</b> again, Luka; my teeth are chattering, and after working {{as hard as}} we have been doing for {{the last three or four}} hours it won't do to get a chill.

6000|$|Silverbridge, {{when the}} door was closed, stood looking at the girl {{for a moment and}} thought that she was more lovely than ever. She was dressed for walking. She still had on her <b>fur</b> <b>jacket,</b> but had taken off her hat. [...] "I was in the parlour downstairs," [...] she said, [...] "when you came in, with papa; and we were going out together; but when I heard who was here, I made him go alone. Was I not good?" ...|$|E
60|$|Her mother, too, {{asked what}} Jessie was about, {{and though she}} did not say {{anything}} against her employment, their looking on, and the expression on Grace's face, worried Jessie so much that she could not think, and only put a slip of paper into her own book at each she found. The chapter she had chosen was the Parable of the Sower, on which she had once heard a sermon. She was amazed to find how many parallel passages there were, and how beautifully they explained one another when she made time for comparing them on Sunday morning. She saw herself beforehand expounding them to the children, and winning their hearts, as her friend in the hospital had described, and she was quite ready in her neat black silk and <b>fur</b> <b>jacket,</b> with a little blue velvet hat, when Amy Lee came to call for her, in her grey merino, black cloth coat, and little hat to match.|$|E
60|$|The sisters {{came out}} to find the Butterfly's Ball in full action. Fly had become a Butterfly by {{the help of a}} {{battered}} pair of fairy wings, stretched on wire, which were part of the theatrical stock. 'The shy little Dormouse' was creeping about on all fours under a <b>fur</b> <b>jacket,</b> with a dilapidated boa for a long tail, but her 'blind brother the Mole' had escaped from her, and had been transformed into the Frog, by means of a spotted handkerchief over his back, and tremendous leap-frog jumps. Primrose, in another pair of fairy wings, was personating the Dragon-fly and all his relations, 'green, orange, and blue.' Valetta, in perfect content with the present, with a queer pair of ears, and a tail made of an old brush, sat up and nibbled as Squirrel. The Grasshopper was performing antics which made him not easily distinguishable from the Frog, and the Spider was actually descending by a rope from the balusters, while his mother, standing somewhat aghast, breathed a hope that 'poor Harlequin's' fall {{was not part of the}} programme. But she did not interfere, having trust in the gymnastics that were studied at school by Jasper, who had been beguiled into the game by Fly's fascinations.|$|E
60|$|For {{three days}} the storm raged, {{and they were}} glad to resume their <b>fur</b> <b>jackets.</b> Jack lay coiled up in the furs in the tent, and nothing could persuade him to move except for breakfast and dinner.

60|$|Her {{father had}} leaned both {{his elbows on}} the table, and his head, bent forward, was {{supported}} in his hands, the thin white fingers of which were pressed over his ears. In his position he was staring fixedly at the bottom of his empty glass, and Newman supposed he was not hearing. Mademoiselle Noemie buttoned her <b>furred</b> <b>jacket</b> and pushed back her chair, casting a glance charged with the consciousness of an expensive appearance first down over her flounces and then up at Newman.|$|R

[...] There were four feet of head room at the {{entrance}} to the boat tent, and in front of this the fire was soon lit, one of the pine torches being cut up to start it with. The skins were laid upon the ground, and taking off their wet coats they put on <b>fur</b> <b>jackets.</b> [...] "Now we can see about breakfast, Luka." ...|$|R

But Hughes as a rock-solid alibi, he was at his girlfriend's party at the time of the killing. Evans knows he's guilty though, and he knows the key to proving it is the victim's <b>fur</b> <b>jacket.</b>|$|E

5000|$|In early 2009, Aries also {{underwent}} a complete character transformation, cutting his long hair, donning new pink and black trunks, {{and coming to}} the ring in a bright pink <b>fur</b> <b>jacket.</b> He dropped his darker persona and adapted to a new ladies man gimmick, often referring to himself as [...] "A Double" [...] and [...] "The Greatest Man That Ever Lived", the latter after a song by Weezer, which also became his new entrance theme.|$|E
5000|$|In late 2006, HSUS {{broke the}} story of its {{investigation}} into the sale of coats trimmed with real fur but labeled [...] "faux" [...] or fake. Laboratory testing found that the fur came from purpose-bred raccoon dogs in China that were sometimes beaten to death and skinned alive. The story of fur animals beaten to death and skinned alive is disputed by a fur industry trade group. The investigation reportedly prompted several retailers including Macy’s and J.C. Penney to pull the garments from the sale floor. Legislation {{was introduced in the}} U.S. Congress to require that all <b>fur</b> <b>jackets</b> be properly labeled, and to ban raccoon dog fur.|$|R

50|$|A pelisse was {{originally}} a short fur lined or <b>fur</b> trimmed <b>jacket</b> that was usually worn hanging loose over the left shoulder of hussar light cavalry soldiers, ostensibly to prevent sword cuts.

5000|$|Jones {{indicates}} {{at every}} turn that the unique, exotic beauty of the African culture is even more striking than traditionally white signifiers of beauty. Even her wardrobe signifies departure from standard, classy apparel yet remains aesthetically pleasing. She appears in rich reds and yellows, tailored pantsuits, clinging silk shirts, voluptuous <b>fur</b> <b>jackets,</b> turbans, silk headdresses, and hooded capes. These outfits create the glamorous identity that is beautiful, black, female, and endowed with unusual social empowerment. Critic Annette Kuhn explains that “a glamorous/glamourised image then is one manipulated, falsified perhaps, in order to heighten or even to idealize. A glamorous image of a woman (or {{an image of a}} glamorous woman) is peculiarly powerful in that it plays on the desire of the spectator in a particularly pristine way: beauty or sexuality is desirable exactly {{to the extent that it}} is idealized and unattainable.” ...|$|R
50|$|Since 1996, possum fur, {{obtained}} from about two million wild-caught possums per year, {{has been used}} in clothing with blends of fine merino wool with brushtail possum fur - variously known as Ecopossum, Merinosilk, Merinomink, possumdown, eco fur or possum wool.

50|$|On Nuutinpäivä, a {{tradition}} {{has been observed}} which is somewhat analogous to modern Santa Claus, where young men dressed as a goat (Finnish: Nuuttipukki) would visit houses. Usually the dress was an inverted <b>fur</b> <b>jacket,</b> a leather or birch bark mask, and horns. Unlike Santa Claus, Nuuttipukki was a scary character (cf. Krampus). The men dressed as Nuuttipukki wandered from house to house, came in, and typically demanded food from the household and especially leftover alcoholic beverages. In Finland the Nuuttipukki tradition is still kept alive in areas of Satakunta, Southwest Finland and Ostrobothnia. However, nowadays the character is usually played by children and now involves a happy encounter.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the night}} of the final Piasek {{performed}} 18th in the running order, following Slovenia and preceding Germany. Prior to the contest the song had been largely dismissed as a dated and derivative sub-Motown effort and Poland's weakest entry to date by some distance. The strange styling of Piasek and his backing singers was also heavily criticised [...] - [...] Piasek appeared on stage wearing a tatty <b>fur</b> <b>jacket,</b> which he cast onto the stage after singing the first verse for a reason which was non-apparent from the lyrical content of the song. At the close of voting [...] "2 Long" [...] had received only 11 points (5 from Germany, 3 from Slovenia, 2 from Sweden and 1 from Denmark), placing Poland 20th of the 23 entries.

The most valuable peltries come from eastern Canada which, although the smallest, are the silkiest and darkest.|$|R
50|$|Unfortunately, {{during the}} time the album was rocketing up the Billboard charts, Martin Fry was {{extremely}} ill with Hodgkin's Disease, so the band could only make limited promotional appearances.

Although Fiona was not allowed to sing, she did contribute to ABC in that she influenced them with the people she introduced Martin and Mark to, such as the avant garde jeweller and stylist Judy Blame, who became the subject of a B-side, 'Judy's Jewels'. One of Michael Clark's dancers, Les Childs, was brought in to choreograph the group, and various up-and-coming young designers dressed the rest of the band while Leigh Bowery designed Eden's fun <b>fur</b> <b>jacket</b> and double-brimmed super-high glittery military-style cap.|$|E
