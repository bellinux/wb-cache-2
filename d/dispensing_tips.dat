40|$|Dispensed {{organic polymer}} optical waveguides {{suitable}} for single-mode operation were recently fabricated. Different dispensing pressures, polymers, and <b>dispensing</b> <b>tips</b> {{were used in}} the drawing method. The waveguides were measured to be approximately 16 [mu] wide and 0. 8 [mu] tall. This is significantly smaller than previously reported dimensions of 300 [mu] x 3. 5 [mu] waveguides fabricated with a similar dispensed polymer method. The waveguides were also found to be suitable for single-mode operation through a series of approximate calculations. This is also something previously not achieved with the larger waveguides. This novel approach to waveguide fabrication could reduce the expense and time of creating single mode waveguides for rapid development applications. It will also allow the waveguides to be fabricated to be flexible as well as doped to be active devices...|$|E

40|$|An {{apparatus}} denoted a swab device {{has been}} developed as a convenient means of acquiring samples of contaminants from surfaces and suspending the samples in liquids. (Thereafter, the liquids can be dispensed, in controlled volumes, into scientific instruments for analysis of the contaminants.) The swab device is designed {{so as not to}} introduce additional contamination and to facilitate, simplify, and systematize the dispensing of controlled volumes of liquid into analytical instruments. The swab device is a single apparatus into which are combined all the equipment and materials needed for sampling surface contamination. The swab device contains disposable components stacked together on a nondisposable dispensing head. One of the disposable components is a supply cartridge holding a sufficient volume of liquid for one complete set of samples. (The liquid could be clean water or another suitable solvent, depending on the application.) This supply of liquid is sealed by Luer valves. At the beginning of a sampling process, the user tears open a sealed bag containing the supply cartridge. A tip on the nondisposable dispensing head is engaged with a Luer valve {{on one end of the}} supply cartridge and rotated, locking the supply cartridge on the dispensing head and opening the valve. The swab tip includes a fabric swab that is wiped across the surface of interest to acquire a sample. A sealed bag containing a disposable <b>dispensing</b> <b>tip</b> is then opened, and the swab tip is pushed into the <b>dispensing</b> <b>tip</b> until seated. The dispensing head contains a piston that passes through a spring-loaded lip seal. The air volume displaced by this piston forces the liquid out of the supply cartridge, over the swab, and into the <b>dispensing</b> <b>tip.</b> The piston is manually cycled to enforce oscillation of the air volume and thereby to cause water to flow to wash contaminants from the swab and cause the resulting liquid suspension of contaminants to flow into the <b>dispensing</b> <b>tip.</b> After several cycles to ensure adequate mixing, liquid containing the suspended contaminant sample is dispensed. The disposable components are then removed from the dispensing head, which may then be reused with a fresh set of disposable components...|$|R

40|$|A 3 -axis {{dispensing}} {{system is}} utilized {{to control the}} initiating and terminating fiber positions and trajectory via the dispensing software. The polymer fiber length and orientation {{is defined by the}} spatial positioning of the dispensing system 3 -axis stages. The fiber diameter is defined by the prescribed dispense time of the dispensing system valve, the feed rate (the speed at which the stage traverses from an initiating to a terminating position), the gauge diameter of the <b>dispensing</b> <b>tip,</b> the viscosity and surface tension of the polymer solution, and the programmed drawing length. The stage feed rate affects the polymer solution’s evaporation rate and capillary breakup of the filaments. The dispensing system consists of a pneumatic valve controller, a droplet-dispensing valve and a <b>dispensing</b> <b>tip.</b> Characterization of the direct write process to determine the optimum combination of factors leads to repeatedly acquiring the desired range of fiber diameters. The advantage of this robotic dispensing system is the ease of obtaining a precise range of micron/sub-micron fibers onto a desired, programmed location via automated process control. Here, the discussed self-assembled micron/sub-micron scale 3 D structures have been employed to fabricate suspended structures to create micron/sub-micron fluidic devices and bioengineered scaffolds...|$|R

40|$|A hollow {{cantilever}} is used {{in place}} of a conventional cantilever to dispense and aspirate liquids in the femto-litre (10 ^− 15 L) volume range in an atomic force microscope (AFM) set up. Unlike a conventional AFM cantilever, these cantilevers are made hollow with an on-chip reservoir. Fluid is dispensed through a micro/nanometer scale aperture on the AFM <b>tip.</b> <b>Dispensed</b> (or aspirated) liquid volume is a function of tip contact time, applied pressure in the reservoir, surface energy of the substrate, surface energy of the tip, and surface tension of the liquid. In a conventional AFM, these parameters are usually not taken into consideration, but these factors will influence the dispense (aspirate) process of the hollow cantilever. To control the dispensing and aspiration process of a hollow cantilever, the influence of various factors needs to be analyzed and a dynamic model should be developed. In the present thesis, initial experimental results on the dispensing process and an analytical dynamic model describing the process are reported. The model is based on the relation between the Laplace pressure and volume of the liquid bridge connecting the cantilever tip and the substrate. The model developed could describe the dispensing process with variance accounted for (VAF) larger than 90 %. Based on the model, four different controllers are designed : series PID controller, parallel PI controller, combination of feedback linearization and iterative learning control and model reference controller. It was found the combination of feedback linearization and iterative learning control can control the system to dispense desired liquid much fast without any overshoot, and model reference controller can control the system without using system identification.

40|$|A {{rapidly growing}} synergy between {{biological}} {{science and engineering}} technology is currently re-shaping the way we view the challenge of treating injury and disease. In particular, emerging biofabrication techniques that allow the precise construction of complex biological structures have reinvigorated the effort to engineer replacement tissues and organs. In addition to the potential for direct therapeutic approaches, advanced engineered tissues promise to significantly improve in vitro studies of fundamental cell biology and disease processes, and expedite drug development. Drop-on-demand cell printing technologies are {{at the forefront of}} these advances in biofabrication. These approaches offer the ability to place living cells, biomaterials and other factors in defined arrangements in two or three dimensions in order to reproduce the complex spatial interplay that regulates tissue function. Significant progress towards this goal has been made over the last decade, but the design of bioinks remains a key challenge due to the need to simultaneously satisfy disparate engineering and biological requirements. The aim of this thesis was to develop bioinks for drop-on-demand cell printing that enable the robust deposition of living cells. Specifically, a suitable bio-ink should be non-cytotoxic, prevent cell settling and aggregation, possess optimal fluid properties (i. e. viscosity and surface tension) for drop-on-demand printing and contain minimal dry mass. Bio-inks were developed by forming gellan gum (GG) microgel suspensions in cell culture media by applying shear during gelation. At a low polymer concentration (0. 05 % w/v) the bio-ink showed a yield stress (~ 43 mPa), while exhibiting a low viscosity (~ 1. 7 mPa. s) at high shear rates (103 s- 1). These properties were shown to prevent cell settling and aggregation without affecting printability. Surfactants were added to the formulation to achieve surface tension reduction for inkjet printing. Addition of the fluorosurfactant, Novec FC- 4430, allowed a suitable surface tension (~ 30 mN/m at 0. 05 % v/v) to be achieved, while Poloxamer 188 (P 188) was included (0. 1 % v/v) for its reported cell-protecting qualities. Neither surfactant significantly affected the bio-ink structure or rheology, and C 2 C 12 (skeletal muscle) and PC 12 (pheocromocytoma) cells exposed to the surfactant-containing bio-ink for 2 hr exhibited normal viability, proliferation and differentiation. The bio-ink formulations, with and without surfactants, proved suitable for cell deposition by microvalve and inkjet printing, respectively. The bio-ink enabled reproducible cell output over 1 hr printing periods from both a microvalve printer (Deerac Equator GX 1) and multiple-nozzle piezoelectric inkjet print heads (Xaar- 126). Printed cells exhibited phenotypic responses that were comparable to controls. It was also demonstrated that P 188 had a protective effect on cells during inkjet printing. Inkjet cell printing using the bio-ink was applied to the fabrication of two dimensional cell constructs. Cell microarrays were printed on glass slides and subsequently analysed by a novel surface-sampling mass spectrometry technique. The combination of the two techniques allowed the detection of characteristic lipid profile ‘fingerprints’ from single printed C 2 C 12, PC 12 and L 929 (fibroblast) cells. The bio-ink also enabled simultaneous printing of two cells types (C 2 C 12 and PC 12) from two inkjet print heads to create patterned co-cultures of viable cells on collagen substrates. Both cell printing techniques were applied in approaches to fabricate cell-laden hydrogel constructs. In a novel method, a microvalve printer <b>tip</b> <b>dispensed</b> cell-laden solutions while immersed in GG solutions. In another approach, cell-laden bio-ink and GG solutions were printed simultaneously from separate inkjet print heads. In both cases, cell-encapsulating hydrogels were formed through ionic crosslinking of GG by the cell solution. Encapsulated cells did not interact with the hydrogel matrix, however, and this observation was repeated in standard culture. Modification strategies to impart biofunctionality to GG hydrogels were therefore explored. Covalent conjugation of the peptide G 4 RGDSY to purified GG was optimised. The peptide conferred significant improvement in the attachment, proliferation and differentiation of surface-seeded and encapsulated C 2 C 12 cells, which was attributed to specific binding with the RGD domain. The work in this thesis shows that smarter design of bio-ink materials can yield important advances in drop-on-demand cell printing approaches. The bio-inks address some of the key challenges in the continuing evolution of these techniques towards becoming clinically relevant biofabrication tools...|$|R
