5|$|In {{baseball}} statistics tie-breakers {{count as}} regular season games, with all events in them added to regular season statistics. For example, the Chicago Sun-Times noted that Sammy Sosa could {{have added to}} his notable home run total in the game. Sosa did add to his league-leading strikeout total with one in the 4th inning. Beck also added to his league-leading total in games played and earned his 51st save of the season which finished 2nd to Trevor Hoffman's 53 but is tied for the 9th highest single-season save total in MLB history. Several Cubs and Giants won awards for their regular season performances including Rookie of the Year honors <b>for</b> <b>Kerry</b> Wood, a Silver Slugger Award for Sosa, and a Rawlings Gold Glove Award for J. T. Snow. Sosa also won the Most Valuable Player award, earning 30 out of 32 first place votes (with McGwire taking the remaining 2).|$|E

25|$|Kerry's Colm Cooper {{scored the}} opening {{point of the}} second half, with Cork's {{response}} consisting of several wides. Kerry captain Darren O'Sullivan then scored a dubious point which {{should not have been}} given as he bounced the ball twice before scoring. Kerry goalkeeper Diarmuid Murphy then preserved his team's four-point lead in the forty-seventh minute by saving Daniel Goulding's effort on goal. Donnacha O'Connor scored a free two minutes later to give Cork their first point for some time. Tadhg Kennelly was substituted for Donnacha Walsh. Goulding scored two more frees for Cork but Tommy Walsh followed up by scoring two frees <b>for</b> <b>Kerry.</b> Tomás Ó Sé scored what proved to be the final point of the match in the fifty-eighth minute. The remainder of the match consisted of wides and substitutes.|$|E
25|$|Their biggest {{test in the}} Championship came against Kerry in the semi-final. This was {{the first}} time Tyrone had met Kerry in the Championship since the All-Ireland Final in 1986. Many pundits believe this was Tyrone's {{definitive}} display of 2003. They deployed a 'blanket defence,' whereby as soon as they lost possession of the ball, all players were ready to win it back. Kerry players, from the full-back line to the forwards, found themselves harried by three or four players around them every time they got the ball, meaning they were under pressure for space, and time to release the ball. Detractors (famously, Pat Spillane, himself a Kerry player from the 1986 final) called this style 'puke football' because it stifled the flow of the game of Gaelic football. It was extremely effective however, and the 0–13 to 0–6 scoreline that Tyrone won by was flattering <b>for</b> <b>Kerry.</b>|$|E

25|$|He joined Senator John Kerry's 2004 presidential {{campaign}} soon after graduation from the College of the Holy Cross. While {{working for the}} Kerry campaign, {{his job was to}} assemble audio clips of talk radio programs for the Kerry camp to review for the next day. When the Kerry campaign began to falter at one point, they found themselves without a speechwriter, and Favreau was promoted to the role of deputy speechwriter. Following Kerry's defeat, Favreau became dispirited with politics, and was uncertain if he would do such work again. Favreau first met Obama (then an Illinois State Senator running for the U.S. Senate), while still working <b>for</b> <b>Kerry,</b> backstage at the 2004 Democratic National Convention as Obama was rehearsing his keynote address. Favreau, then 23 years old, interrupted Obama's rehearsal, advising the soon-to-be-elected Senator that a rewrite was needed to avoid an overlap with Kerry's address.|$|E
25|$|Khan {{made his}} Test cricket debut against England in 1971 Edgbaston. Three years later, he debuted in the One Day International (ODI) match, once again playing against England at Trent Bridge for the Prudential Trophy. After graduating from Oxford and {{finishing}} his tenure at Worcestershire, {{he returned to}} Pakistan in 1976 and secured a permanent place on his native national team starting from the 1976–1977 season, during which they faced New Zealand and Australia. Following the Australian series, he toured the West Indies, where he met Tony Greig, who signed him up <b>for</b> <b>Kerry</b> Packer's World Series Cricket. His credentials {{as one of the}} fastest bowlers of the world started to become established when he finished third at 139.7km/h in a fast bowling contest at Perth in 1978, behind Jeff Thomson and Michael Holding, but ahead of Dennis Lillee, Garth Le Roux and Andy Roberts.|$|E
25|$|Ó Sé {{made his}} debut on the inter-county {{scene at the}} age of sixteen when he was {{selected}} for the Kerry minor team in 1971. He enjoyed three championship seasons with the minor team, however, he was a Munster runner-up all three occasions. Ó Sé subsequently joined the Kerry under-21 team, winning back-to-back All-Ireland medals in 1975 and 1976. By this stage he had also joined the Kerry senior team, making his debut during the 1973-74 league. Over {{the course of the next}} fifteen seasons, Ó Sé won eight All-Ireland medals, beginning with a lone triumph in 1975, a record-equalling four championships in-a-row from 1978 to 1981 and three championships in-a-row from 1984 to 1986. He also won eleven Munster medals, four National Football League medals and five successive All-Stars. Ó Sé played his last game <b>for</b> <b>Kerry</b> in May 1988 before being dropped from the starting fifteen for the subsequent Munster final defeat by Cork, a move which effectively brought an end to his inter-county career.|$|E

25|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 1980s, Kerry {{went into}} decline and did not appear in an All-Ireland final for 11 years, between 1986 and 1997. The 1997 victory, however, would mark the {{beginning}} of a revival <b>for</b> <b>Kerry</b> which spanned roughly {{the first decade of the}} 21st century. Of the 15 All-Ireland finals between 1997 and 2011, Kerry contested ten and won six, including five titles in the 2000s. In 2006 and 2007, Kerry won consecutive All-Ireland titles (the first to do so since Cork in 1989 and 1990), while in 2009, they became only the third team to reach six consecutive All-Ireland finals (a feat last achieved by Dublin between 1974 and 1979), winning their 36th title by beating Cork in that final. Kerry quietly exited the 2010 and 2012 All-Ireland Senior Football Championships at the quarter-final stage, losing to Down and Donegal respectively, while Dublin defeated them in dramatic fashion on the last kick in the 2011 final. Dublin were also responsible for their exit at the semi-final stage in 2013 in a closely contested classic match.|$|E
25|$|Kerry {{were the}} first team to score, after just two minutes of the match, with Declan O'Sullivan fisting the ball over the bar. Nine minutes later, after several wides from both sides, Alan Brogan curled a shot inside the upright to equalise. Paul Flynn was booked for a high {{challenge}} on Aidan O'Mahony a minute later. In the 15th minute, Alan Brogan scored his second point of the match to give Dublin the lead. Two minutes later, Darren O'Sullivan broke through the Dublin defence and offloaded the ball to Colm Cooper who put it past Stephen Cluxton to score a goal <b>for</b> <b>Kerry.</b> With the score at Kerry 1-01 – 0-02 Dublin, Bernard Brogan got his first point of the day from a free. In the 24th minute, Rory O'Carroll was given a yellow card for an off-the-ball incident with Darren O'Sullivan. A minute later, Kerry made their first substitution, bringing on Paul Galvin for corner-forward Kieran O'Leary. In the 28th minute, goalkeeper Stephen Cluxton scored for Dublin from a free and then Bernard Brogan scored his second and third points, giving Dublin a two-point lead. Substitute Galvin then scored his first point, leaving the score Kerry 1-02 – 0-06 Dublin at half time.|$|E
