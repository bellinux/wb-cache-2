5|$|In 1986, {{a larger}} 100cc HA05E <b>engine</b> <b>model</b> was {{introduced}} especially for Asian markets. The newer 100cc model was developed exclusively for Southeast Asian market, especially in Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam, where underbones were very popular, with new {{features such as}} a telescopic front suspension to replace the older leading link suspension, and a four-speed transmission to replace the older three-speed transmission used in older Cub variants. The 100cc model was initially known as the Honda Dream in Thailand and Honda EX5 in Malaysia, before being standardised as the Honda EX5 Dream in 2003. In addition, Honda Japan began importing the made-in-Thailand Dream as the Super Cub C100EX in 1988. The Japanese C100EX was later being facelifted in 1993, while the Southeast Asian EX5 Dream retains the 1986 design until the present day, with only minor cosmetic changes. In 2011, the carbureted EX5 Dream was phased out in Thailand and being replaced with the fuel-injected Honda Dream 110i, with the powertrain being derived from the fuel-injected Honda Wave 110i.|$|E

25|$|As with Indonesia, the Corolla Altis was {{launched}} in March 2008 in Malaysia as well. It was offered in 5 variants – 1.8G, 1.8G Sporty, 1.8E, 1.8E Sporty and 1.6E.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} new {{procedure}} {{to reduce the}} order of control oriented turbocharged (TC) spark ignition (SI) <b>engine</b> <b>models.</b> The starting point of this work is a higher dimen-sional, fully validated model defined which is not appropriate for control design. The model reduction technique {{is based on the}} iden-tification of time scale separation within the dynamics of various engine state variables with pertinent use of perturbation theory. The model reduction is accomplished in two steps and exploits the dynamic and physical characteristics of engine design and opera-tion. In the first step, regular and singular perturbation theories are collectively employed to eliminate temperature dynamics and replace them with their quasi-steady state values. This is followed by the elimination of fast pressures. As a result, a library of <b>engine</b> <b>models</b> is obtained which are associated with each other on a sound theoretical basis {{and at the same time}} allow sufficient flexibility in terms of the reduced order modeling. Different assumptions under which this model reduction is justified are presented and their im-plications are discussed. The approximating properties of the pro-posed <b>engine</b> <b>models</b> with respect to the original higher dimen-sional model are quantitatively assessed through comprehensive simulations.
