50|$|The fight-or-flight {{response}} (also called hyperarousal, or {{the acute}} stress response) is a physiological reaction {{that occurs in}} response to a perceived <b>harmful</b> <b>event,</b> attack, or threat to survival. It was first described by Walter Bradford Cannon. His theory states that animals react to threats with a general discharge of the sympathetic nervous system, preparing the animal for fighting or fleeing. More specifically, the adrenal medulla produces a hormonal cascade that results in the secretion of catecholamines, especially norepinephrine and epinephrine. The hormones estrogen, testosterone, and cortisol, as well as the neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin, also affect how organisms react to stress.|$|E

30|$|The {{intrusion}} {{events in}} the optical fiber pre-warning system (OFPS) are divided into two types which are <b>harmful</b> intrusion <b>event</b> and harmless interference event. At present, the signal feature extraction methods of {{these two types of}} events are usually designed from the view of the time domain. However, the differences of time-domain characteristics for different <b>harmful</b> intrusion <b>events</b> are not obvious, which cannot reflect the diversity of them in detail. We find that the spectrum distribution of different intrusion signals has obvious differences. For this reason, the intrusion signal is transformed into the frequency domain. In this paper, an energy ratio feature extraction method of <b>harmful</b> intrusion <b>event</b> is drawn on. Firstly, the intrusion signals are pre-processed and the power spectral density (PSD) is calculated. Then, the energy ratio of different frequency bands is calculated, and the corresponding feature vector of each type of intrusion event is further formed. The linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier is used to identify the <b>harmful</b> intrusion <b>events</b> in the paper. Experimental results show that the algorithm improves the recognition rate of the intrusion signal, and further verifies the feasibility and validity of the algorithm.|$|R

In the Bier or Mines de Potasse case, the ECJ specified that the expression ‘place where the <b>harmful</b> <b>event</b> occurred‘ can encompass both “the place where the damage occurred and the place of the event giving rise to it”. Although this specification can be very helpful to the case, its implications, such as the possibility of a multitude of fora, have led to a rather extensive case-law governing the subject, making this provision a complex matter.|$|E

5000|$|People's {{emotions}} are {{also influenced by}} their secondary appraisal of situations. Secondary appraisal involves people's evaluation of their resources and options for coping (Lazarus, 1991). [...] One aspect of secondary appraisal is a person's evaluation of who should be held accountable. A person can hold herself, another, {{or a group of}} other people accountable for the situation at hand. Blame may be given for a <b>harmful</b> <b>event</b> and credit may be given for a beneficial event (Lazarus, 1991). In addition, an individual might also see the situation as due to chance. The way in which people view who or what should be held accountable directs and guides their efforts to cope with the emotions they experience. Another aspect of secondary appraisal is a person's coping potential. Coping potential is potential to use either problem-focused coping or emotion-focused coping strategies to handle an emotional experience. (Smith & Kirby, 2009). [...] Problem-focused coping refers to one's ability to take action and to change a situation to make it more congruent with one's goals (Smith & Kirby, 2009). Thus, a person's belief about their ability to perform problem-focused coping influences the emotions they experience in the situation. On the other hand, emotion-focused coping refers to one's ability to handle or adjust to the situation should the circumstances remain inconsistent with one's goals (Smith & Kirby, 2009). Again, the emotions people experience are influenced by how they perceive their ability to perform emotion-focused coping. The fourth component of secondary appraisal is one's future expectancy (Lazarus, 1991). [...] Future expectancy refers to one's expectations of change in the motivational congruence of a situation (for any reason). Thus, an individual may belief the situation will change favorably or unfavorably (Lazarus, 1991). One's future expectancy influences the emotions elicited during a situation as well as the coping strategies used.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} provides {{new insight}} into the nature, causes and costs of rollover casualties; and the economic benefits of basic countermeasures. The National Accident Sampling System (NASS) is {{a rich source of}} data on motor vehicle crashes, particularly if one goes beyond the electronic files. In this work, the author reviewed every NASS case from 2002 through 2004 in which a passenger car, SUV, pickup, or minivan that was less than eleven years old rolled over and produced an AIS 3 + injury (more than 500 cases). From this, we developed a useful new classification for these crashes with AIS 3 + injury: (1) cases with complete ejections, (2) cases in which there was a head or neck injury from roof crush, (3) other rollovers in which the rollover was the most <b>harmful</b> <b>event,</b> (4) cases in which a collision before the rollover was the most <b>harmful</b> <b>event,</b> and (5) cases in which a collision or major change in elevation during the rollover was the most <b>harmful</b> <b>event.</b> We used the NHTSA “Economic Impact of Motor Vehicle Crashes ” and the weighting factor for the crashes to determine the total cost of all of these crash injuries. We then estimated the effectiveness of three simple countermeasures – a strong roof, side window glazing that does not break out during the rollover, and an effective belt use reminder – in reducing the severity and cost of these injuries. The results were most dramatic for SUVs where the discounted potential savings were on the order of several thousand dollars per vehicle over its lifetime. Even for passenger cars, the savings would easily justify the cost of these countermeasures. This work demonstrates the high degree of benefit that would far outweigh the cost of the countermeasures even if the affected vehicles were equipped with electronic stability systems...|$|E

The approach detects, prevents, and heals <b>harmful</b> <b>events,</b> {{which are the}} actual reasons for damage {{of any of the}} system’s components. The proposed approach explores the design and implementation of artificial immune systems (AISs) inspired by the human immune system, in solving the problem of network security. A novel approach for network security based on the combination of biological intrusion prevention (IP) and self-healing concepts is proposed. The system integrates an artificial immune intrusion prevention system for network security inspired by the immunology theory known as danger theory and adaptive immune system. The approach is based upon data inspired by the human immune system (HIS), which applied to the autonomous defense system. The present model looks at the danger model and its application to attack defense {{in order to create a}} fully decentralized model. The intrusion prevention system (IPS) analyzes the behavior of system processes and network traffic to detect <b>harmful</b> <b>events.</b> Abnormal behaviors are the actual reason for damage of any of the system’s components. The detection of the damage caused by different types of malicious events or attack profiles is used to trigger the self- healing (SH) mechanism.

40|$|International audienceWhen {{modelling}} the pathophysiology of a disease, it {{is important}} to ă select a modelling approach that can adequately replicate its course. ă The objective of this paper was to compare the outcomes obtained by the ă Markov and discrete-time microsimulation modelling approaches using ă nalmefene clinical trial data. ă Markov and microsimulation modelling approaches assessing alcohol ă dependence treatment with psychosocial support with or without nalmefene ă were compared in terms of the modelled evolution of patients' alcohol ă consumption and the resulting occurrence of alcohol-attributable <b>harmful</b> ă <b>events</b> over 1 year. ă Comparison of the proportion of the modelled population at different ă levels of alcohol consumption over time revealed systematic differences ă arising from the different modelling techniques: a lower number of ă patients reaching abstinence, a higher number of patients at higher ă drinking levels, and, overall, a smoother evolution of alcohol ă consumption in the microsimulation. Reasons are discussed in the paper. ă While the models produced similar occurrences of alcohol-attributable ă <b>harmful</b> <b>events</b> as a whole, distinct results for the individual events ă were observed, explained by the specific pathophysiology of occurrence ă of these events and how their implementation was adapted to fit the ă limitations of the compared modelling approaches; however, these ă differences were only statistically significant for one of the eight ă events. ă For a general public health or health economic assessment of alcohol use ă disorders, it is possible to achieve similar results with the compared ă approaches. To assess a patients' disease course, taking into ă consideration alcohol-attributable <b>harmful</b> <b>events,</b> the microsimulation ă approach may provide more precise results.
