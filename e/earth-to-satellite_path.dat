40|$|In the {{framework}} of the ITALSAT campaign various European institutions carried out propagation measurements at V band. In this frequency band, signal reception in a satellite-to- Earth or <b>Earth-to-satellite</b> <b>path</b> may suffer severely from signal attenuation due to meteorological effects such as rain, snow, hail, fog, clouds, etc., where rain provides the most significant contribution. In this paper, a joint analysis of the ITALSAT propagation measurement campaigns at 39. 6 GHz (precisely 39. 592 GHz) carried out at both Oberpfaffenhofen, close to Munich, Germany, and Spino d’Adda, close to Milan, Italy, is presented. For both stations long-term attenuation statistics are available and reveal that signal attenuation due to meteorological effects depends very much on the season and on the time of the day. Signal attenuation can be compensated by an appropriate fade margin. In this paper, we show that the required fade margin to guarantee a target link availability has to be chosen very carefully, since it depends very much on the time interval upon which availability is defined. We consider complete years, ITU-R recommendations, all single months of the year, worst months, and spring, summer, fall, and winter. Furthermore, we evaluate diurnal variations for four time intervals: 00 : 00 – 06 : 00, 06 : 00 – 12 : 00, 12 : 00 – 18 : 00, and 18 : 00 – 24 : 00...|$|E
40|$|Complex {{physical}} models {{are necessary to}} interpret the patterns of microwave attenuation versus depolarization gathered from measurements along <b>Earth-to-satellite</b> <b>paths,</b> due to the layered structure of {{the atmosphere in the}} presence of precipitation or clouds. Here we show that a simulation tool previously developed and based on physical concepts achieves good results when checked against measured patterns in a few case studies. Upon further validation, the simulator could be useful in assessing the effects of interference in the design of satellite systems based on polarization diversity...|$|R
40|$|Rain {{attenuation}} {{is considered}} to be a dominant factor affecting the reliability of both terrestrial and <b>earth-to-satellite</b> <b>paths</b> operating at frequencies above 10 GHz. The subject of the present paper is the development of some efficient models for the prediction of the operational characteristics (such as the path enlargement factor, accumulation thermal noise, site diversity improvement) of microwave systems operating at these frequencies. The numerical results taken from the present models have been compared with available experimental data from operated links in USA, Europe, Japan and the agreement has been found to be quite encouraging. © 1990 Springer-Verlag...|$|R
