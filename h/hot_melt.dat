The anti-cancer drug Doxorubicin in liposome delivery system is formulated by extrusion, for example. <b>Hot</b> <b>melt</b> extrusion is also utilized in pharmaceutical solid oral dose processing to enable delivery of drugs with poor solubility and bioavailability. <b>Hot</b> <b>melt</b> extrusion has been shown to molecularly disperse poorly soluble drugs in a polymer carrier increasing dissolution rates and bioavailability. The process involves the application of heat, pressure and agitation to mix materials together and ‘extrude’ them through a die. Twin-screw high shear extruders blend materials and simultaneously break up particles. The resulting particle can be blended with compression aids and compressed into tablets or filled into unit dose capsules.|$|E

40|$|Several {{thermoanalytical}} {{methods were}} used to assess the compatibility of EBA (copolymer of ethylene and n-butyl acrylate) <b>hot</b> <b>melts</b> containing tackifiers of different nature (pentaerythritol rosin ester, polyterpene resin, aliphatic hydrocarbon resin, aromatic hydrocarbon resin, and cycloaliphatic-aromatic hydrocarbon resin). The influence of the compatibility of EBA <b>hot</b> <b>melts</b> on their rheological, viscoelastic, and adhesion properties to polar (aluminum foil) and nonpolar (polypropylene film) substrates were analyzed. The viscosity and shear thinning at 160 °C of EBA <b>hot</b> <b>melts</b> varied significantly by changing the tackifier nature; however, at 180 °C all EBA <b>hot</b> <b>melts</b> showed similar viscosities and shear thinning was absent because of the rupture of physical interactions between their components. EBA copolymer showed broad tackifier compatibility, even though aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon resins were less compatible. Compatibility was assessed by softening point and cloud point measurement, and dynamical mechanical thermal analysis. The most compatible EBA <b>hot</b> <b>melts</b> were obtained with rosin ester, polyterpene and cycloaliphatic-aromatic hydrocarbon tackifiers and they showed the highest tack and adhesion. On the contrary, the less-compatible EBA <b>hot</b> <b>melts</b> were obtained with aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon tackifiers, and they showed the lowest adhesion. EBA containing aliphatic hydrocarbon tackifier was exceptional because of even being incompatible, it showed high tack. Financial support by REPSOL (Móstoles, Madrid, Spain) is acknowledged...|$|R

40|$|Today, {{thermosetting}} polymer resins containing formaldehyde {{are mainly}} {{used in the}} production of plywood composites. These glues are toxic due to the generation of gaseous products, chiefly formaldehyde, during the production and exploitation of laminated materials, which pollute the environment. In order to decrease the emission of toxic products from these resins, natural product additives (lignins, tannins etc.) or fully biodegradable polymers such as starch, polylactides etc., are used. These glues are not toxic, but they have poor adhesion to wood, low water resistance and are more expensive. Our previous investigations have shown the possibility of using non-toxic virgin polyolefins as <b>hot</b> <b>melts</b> for plywood production. The aim of this work was to investigate the use of cheaper waste products, such as recycled thermoplastic polymers (polyolefins, polyamides), as glue <b>hot</b> <b>melts</b> for wood veneer bonding instead of traditional thermosetting resins, which are based on formaldehyde. Different recycled thermoplastic polymers produced from tetra package waste, domestic film waste, recycled polypropylene and recycled polyamide- 6 were used as <b>hot</b> <b>melts</b> for birch wood veneer bonding. The content of the recycled adhesives was determined using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and the tetra package waste content of different types of polyethylenes, with additives of polypropylene and polyethylene terephthalate (PET), was fixed. Virgin high-density polyethylene and polypropylene were used as references. The fluidity of all the recycled materials, using melt flow index (MFI) measurements, was 1. 96 g/ 10 min for polyethylenes and 1. 94 g/ 10 min for polypropylene; this adhesive fluidity is sufficient to form full contact with the surface of the wood veneer sheets. Adhesive activity of the recycled <b>hot</b> <b>melts</b> was evaluated by preparing single overlap joints and specimens were tested for shear strength. The optimal technological parameters for producing samples were noted: pressure 2 MPa, contact time 1 - 2 min and a temperature for polyethylenes of 130 °C, for polypropylene of 180 °C, for PA- 6 at 220 °C. The highest values of shear strength were observed for specimens glued with recycled polypropylene (10 MPa), in the case of polyethylenes, the maximum was 5 - 6 MPa. The mixed fracture mechanism of adhesive joints was fixed after visually examining the surface of the broken samples. It was shown that to reach high adhesive strength it is also necessary to improve the cohesive strength of the adhesive layer. Polyethylene terephthalate fabric waste was used as reinforcement for strengthening the adhesive layer, which improved the bending strength and modulus of the two layers laminate bonded with recycled polypropylene. Direct correlation between high adhesive properties and high bending strength was not observed on all occasions. Water exposure experiments (23 °C, 72 h) showed a decrease of adhesive strength to constant values of 2 - 2. 2 MPa, for all investigated adhesives, which are similar to observations using 4 mm thick industrial plywood, corresponding to the 3 rd class of water resistance. These investigations highlight the excellent prospects for the use of recycled polyolefins as <b>hot</b> <b>melts</b> for wood bonding...|$|R
