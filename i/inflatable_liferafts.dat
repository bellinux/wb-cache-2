50|$|<b>Inflatable</b> <b>liferafts</b> {{were also}} used {{successfully}} to save crews of aircraft that ditched in the sea; bombing, naval and anti-submarine aircraft flying long distances over water being much more common {{from the start of}} WWII.|$|E
50|$|These {{devices are}} {{distinct}} from traditional SAR radar transponders (SART), as they transmit AIS messages containing accurate GPS position information {{and include a}} GPS receiver and a transmitter on VHF AIS channels, so they show up on ship AIS receivers. They are lightweight {{and can be used}} to equip <b>inflatable</b> <b>liferafts.</b>|$|E
50|$|Modern {{lifeboats}} have a motor; liferafts {{usually do}} not. Large lifeboats use a davit or launching system (there might be multiple lifeboats on one), {{that requires a}} human to launch. Lifeboat launching takes longer and has higher risk of failure due to human factors. However lifeboats do not suffer from inflation system failures as <b>inflatable</b> <b>liferafts</b> do.|$|E
50|$|The ships {{lifeboat}} {{was unable}} to be launched due to the extreme list angle, however an <b>inflatable</b> <b>liferaft</b> was released into the sea by the bosun Stan Leary. Once inflated by its gas canister, the crew all managed to board {{it and it was}} cut free of the ship by young crewmember Michael Doleman. Very shortly after, the Blythe Stars bow lifted high and it sank stern-first into the Southern Ocean, approximately five miles west of South West Cape in 80 fathoms (480 feet; 150 metres) of water. No distress call had been made by the captain {{at the time of the}} sinking.|$|R
50|$|The vessel MV Blythe Star was {{a coastal}} {{freighter}} which foundered off south-western Tasmania in October 1973, {{leading to the}} largest maritime search operation conducted in Australia to that time. No sign of the vessel was ever found. The crew of ten successfully took to a small <b>inflatable</b> <b>liferaft,</b> {{but it was not}} until after 11 days and the deaths of three seamen that the survivors were found ashore in rugged terrain near Deep Glen Bay on Tasmanias south east coast. As a result of this tragedy, the AUSREP maritime position reporting system was introduced to the Australian Navigation Act.|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the results of}} an experimental investigation of the seakeeping characteristics of liferafts. The tests were exploratory in nature, to identify some of the factors or inherent design features that influence the survivability of an International Maritime Organization (IMO) canister-type <b>inflatable</b> <b>liferaft</b> (12 - 20 person capacity) in extreme wind and waves. In addition the program also investigated some potential modifications that improve the safety of the liferafts in extreme seas. The liferaft parameters that were investigated included the effects of free surface flood water, personnel loading, personnel distribution, ballast pocket operation, canopy operation and drogue type and operation.

50|$|Drawing on {{the parent}} company's {{expertise}} {{in the design of}} hydraulic equipment led to local manufacturer of the Fairey Microfilter, which had applications in industries beyond aviation. Yet another Fairey designed and manufactured component was the Safety Ohmmeter. This instrument had many applications in missiles, mining, quarrying and similar fields. The company was appointed agent for RFD Inflatable Marine Survival Equipment. This agency included sales, service inspection and repair of <b>inflatable</b> <b>liferafts.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{airborne}} lifeboat {{was developed}} for the RAF to provide a means of rescue for downed aircrew. A search and rescue aircraft would drop the lifeboat by parachute to the crew, who could then attempt {{to make their own}} way back to a friendly shore. Although aircraft carried their own <b>inflatable</b> <b>liferafts,</b> these merely protected the crew from drowning and were not navigable vessels. Crew taking to their liferafts near a hostile shore would often be captured, if they were not first rescued by air-sea rescue launches.|$|E
50|$|The 165 foot, 900 tonne {{icebreaker}} sank in calm seas in {{less than}} 20 minutes leaving 13 crew members dead and 19 survivors drifting in two <b>inflatable</b> <b>liferafts</b> {{for more than two}} days until rescued by the Canadian Coast Guard. The ship was chartered to Geophysical Service Inc., a seismic exploration company, which was owned by Texas Instruments at the time she sank. It was often incorrectly reported that the ship hit an iceberg. It appears that a ballast problem was the more likely cause.|$|E
50|$|The <b>inflatable</b> <b>liferaft</b> {{to which}} the crew escaped was 12 feet m in diameter, covered with an orange canopy, and {{equipped}} with tinned water, dry biscuits, some flares, two oars and a baling pail. In the rush to abandon ship, the emergency radio had been left on board the Blythe Star, however the crew expected to be quickly spotted by searchers or passing ships. This was not to be, and by several days into their ordeal the weather had worsened significantly. Keeping the raft upright and afloat took much effort, with big waves regularly collapsing the inflatable vessel onto itself, and water needing to be constantly bailed-out.|$|R
5|$|Some of {{the snakes}} attack Rick, and while fending them off he accidentally {{releases}} the oxygen masks throughout the plane, causing several snakes to {{drop into the}} cabin with them. Numerous passengers, including Agent Sanders, are killed when the snakes invade the cabin. The surviving passengers, who have {{made their way to}} the front of the plane, put up blockades of luggage in a desperate attempt to stop the snakes. Rick is attacked and the plane starts to dip downwards, causing a food trolley to crash through the luggage blockade. The passengers flee to the upstairs first class cabin before blocking the stairwell with an <b>inflatable</b> <b>liferaft.</b> Agent Flynn and Flight Attendant Claire regain control of the plane. Rick retakes the controls and has Flynn go into the cargo hold to restore the air conditioning/ventilation system. Agent Flynn contacts FBI Special Agent Hank Harris on the ground, who gets in touch with ophiologist Dr. Steven Price, Customs' main source for animal smuggling cases. Based on pictures of the reptiles emailed to him via a passenger's mobile phone, Price believes a Los Angeles snake dealer known for illegally importing exotic and highly dangerous snakes to be responsible. After a shootout, the dealer is bitten by one of his snakes and Harris withholds the antivenom if he does not give them details. The dealer finally reveals that Kim hired him to obtain the snakes and adds how the latter managed to smuggle them on board the plane. Price injects antivenom to the injured dealer and he commandeers the dealer's supply of antivenom for the plane's victims based on the list given to him, while Harris gives orders to have Eddie Kim arrested on multiple counts of murder and attempted murder.|$|R
50|$|Coates {{was born}} in Swansea, the son of Joseph Coates, Professor of Chemistry at the University College of Swansea. He was educated at Clifton College and took Engineering Science at The Queen's College, Oxford. He joined the Royal Corps of Naval Constructors and in 1943 saw sea service on the Arctic convoys. After the war, he {{continued}} {{to work in the}} Admiralty. An early project was the design of new <b>inflatable</b> lifejackets and <b>liferafts</b> for which he was appointed OBE in 1955. He was the leading ship design architect for the County-class destroyers. Coates remained in Admiralty service until 1979 when he retired for the post of Chief Naval Architect.|$|R
50|$|The captain {{brought the}} {{aircraft}} down smoothly. Although {{it took on}} water quickly, the passenger cabin remained in one piece, {{and all of those}} on board were able to depart safely, most using their seat cushions as makeshift flotation devices. The Air Force Grumman landed in the water near the ditching site ten minutes after the ditching and launched a number of <b>inflatable</b> <b>liferafts,</b> but not all passengers and crew were able to reach them; many remained in the freezing waters of Puget Sound hanging onto their seat cushions until they were rescued less than thirty minutes later by the Coast Guard vessel. Four passengers, including a six-year-old boy and his mother and one male flight attendant, were not recovered and were thought to have succumbed to hypothermia. The Stratocruiser sank 15 minutes after the ditching in approximately 430 ft of water.|$|E
40|$|<b>Inflatable</b> <b>liferafts</b> {{are used}} {{worldwide}} {{as a means}} of evacuation and survival from almost all ocean‐going vessels, regardless of their size, purpose or region of operation. Vessel size ranges from fishing and other commercial vessels with small crews to offshore oil installations and passenger ships with thousands of persons onboard. While International Maritime Organisation (IMO) standards currently require inflatable liferaft components to “provide insulation” or “be sufficiently insulated”, no performance criteria accompany these requirements. This paper will outline the methodology and results from a three year research project involving a multidisciplinary team which utilised human subjects and a thermally instrumented manikin to investigate the gaps in knowledge for the thermal performance of <b>inflatable</b> <b>liferafts</b> in cold environments. Tests were conducted in a controlled laboratory environment with a 16 person SOLAS‐approved liferaft and air and water temperatures as cold as 5 °C. The main variables investigated were clothing wetness (wet and dry) and liferaft floor insulation (insulated and uninsulated). The project’s four main objectives were to: 1) develop thermal protection criteria for <b>inflatable</b> <b>liferafts</b> assuming otherwise unprotected occupants, 2) propose an objective methodology for testing inflatable liferaft thermal protection performance, 3) develop tools for search and rescue planners to predict survival times of liferaft occupants and 4) provide guidance to training authorities and manufacturers. The study found that: 1) the thermal insulation of a combined system of clothing and liferaft using a thermal manikin gave good agreement with measurements using humans, as long as proper corrections for differences between manikin and humans are appropriately applied, 2) system insulation values coupled with a cold exposure survival model can be expected to give search and rescue planners reasonable predictions of survival time in liferafts where hypothermia is the main risk factor and 3) the factors substantially affecting the survival time of liferaft occupants are: whether any type of thermal protective aid (TPA) is worn,clothing wetness, liferaft floor insulation and liferaft ventilation rate...|$|E
40|$|<b>Inflatable</b> <b>liferafts</b> are {{currently}} used worldwide {{as a means}} of evacuation and survival from almost all ocean-going vessels, regardless of their size and purpose. This ranges from fishing and other commercial vessels with small crew sizes to offshore oil installations and passenger ships with thousands of persons onboard. While International Maritime Organization (IMO) standards currently require inflatable life raft components to 2 ̆ 01 cprovide insulation 2 ̆ 01 d or 2 ̆ 01 cbe sufficiently insulated 2 ̆ 01 d, no performance criteria accompany these requirements (IMO, 1996). This report outlines the methodology and results from an engineering and human factors research project which investigated the gaps in knowledge surrounding inflatable liferaft performance with respect to occupant thermal protection in cold environmental conditions. The research objectives of this project were to: 1. Develop thermal protection criteria for inflatable life rafts assuming otherwise unprotected occupants. 2. Propose an objective methodology for testing inflatable life raft thermal protection performance. 3. Develop tools for Search and Rescue (SAR) planners to predict survival times of liferaft occupants. 4. Provide guidance to training authorities and manufacturers. The research was conducted at the National Research Council 2 ̆ 019 s Institute for Ocean Technology in St. John 2 ̆ 019 s, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. This world-class facility allowed an interdisciplinary team of researchers to systematically examine the environmental, human and technological factors related to heat exchange within a liferaft-occupant system. This report details experimental protocols, empirical research findings and physical modelling approaches considered over a three-year period to address the project objectives. The project was undertaken in a multi-phased approach. A phase-by-phase summary of the project findings is provided below, followed by overall project findings and recommendations. Phase 1 Phase 1 was designed as a one-week pilot experiment with human subjects, aimed at better understanding the effects and sensitivity of the variables, to observe the rate of occupant heat loss, to validate the proper functioning of equipment and to collect data for preliminary investigation. The primary focus was to assess heat loss from direct contact with the raft floor through conduction. The air temperature and water temperature were 19 and 16 respectively. Phase 1 results informed the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 experiments. Phase 1 results summary: 7 The effect of wave height is less important with leeway and may be ignored as a first approximation {{to reduce the number of}} environmental variables. Heat conductance increases non-linearly with leeway but appears to level off above 0. 5 m/s leeway speed. Therefore, waves can be eliminated as an independent variable and leeway speed set to 0. 5 m/s for Phases 2 and 3. 7 It was observed during an 11 -person test that the CO 2 concentration inside the liferaft reached an uncomfortable level (over 5000 ppm) in less than an hour when the canopy was closed and no active ventilation system used. Phase 2 Phase 2 was designed to assess occupant heat loss and life raft thermal protection in mild conditions (19 air temperature and 16 water temperature) based on the findings of Phase 1, using human subjects. Tests were designed to assess floor insulation (inflated or uninflated) and clothing wetness (dry or wet) in four baseline cases (Phase 2 and again for Phase 3) : 1. Inflated raft floor; dry clothing (Idry) 2. Inflated raft floor; wet clothing (Iwet) 3. Uninflated raft floor; dry clothing (Udry) 4. Uninflated raft floor; wet clothing (Uwet) Phase 2 results summary: 7 During exposure in mild conditions inside an enclosed life raft, the wetness of the clothing worn by the occupants and the absence of floor insulation would both significantly decrease the occupant mean skin temperature. However, only the clothing wetness will increase the heat loss from the subjects. (Uwet = 67. 4111. 2 W/m 2; Iwet = 64. 9111. 0 W/m 2 compared to Udry = 55. 818. 9 W/m 2; Idry = 52. 415. 1 W/m 2). 7 The thermal stress induced by the different test conditions was not sufficient to significantly and consistently increase the metabolic rate of the occupants through shivering. Despite the mild responses to cold during the exposures (skin temperature above 300 C, Heat loss increased by < 15...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} the amount of ice {{coverage}} in the Arctic has receded opening up new avenues for marine vessels. Due to the economic advantages offered by these new avenues, Arctic traffic has increased and now includes cruise ships {{in addition to the}} normal commercial vessels. Recent marine accidents have called into question the impact of one in the Arctic where resources are limited and cruise ships can carry thousands of passengers who will need to survive in the harsh environment. As a result the passengers and crew of the cruise ship may be reliant on whatever supplies and equipment they carry on board with them. The thermal insulation of various clothing ensembles were measured to determine if they provided sufficient protection from hypothermia in order for people to survive in the Arctic until rescued. The thermal insulation values of the clothing ensembles were measured using thermal manikins in the following conditions: dry/still air; dry/wind; wet/still air; and wet/wind. These values were inputted into {{a modified version of the}} Cold Exposure Survival Model to give predicted survival times for 60 - 70 year old females, which were deemed to be the demographic that would cool the fastest. None of the clothing ensembles tested were able to provide a sufficient level of thermal protection when immersed in 00 C water. The majority of the clothing ensembles were able to provide enough thermal protection in - 150 C air but only in ideal conditions. With the exception of two, all the ensembles were very sensitive to wind and wetting and would experience a significant decrease in insulation therefore greatly reducing predicted survival time. Only the ensembles that incorporated sleeping bags did not experience a significant drop in insulation when exposed to wind. It was found that a minimum in-situ clo value of 2. 6 was required to ensure that people would not perish from hypothermia in the short term. The majority of the clothing ensembles tested will provide a sufficient level of thermal protection to prevent hypothermia in Arctic conditions but only if they are kept dry and out of the wind. It is recommended that these select clothing ensembles be used in conjunction with a wind break such as a tent or <b>inflatable</b> <b>liferaft.</b> Future work should investigate the possibility of creating a clothing ensemble specifically designed for survival in the Arctic that has an in-situ clo value of 2. 6.
