At the same time it also provides an underlying mechanism for avoiding repetitive behaviors and increases the “humanness” by minor random perturbations during the interaction process. Our implementation combines two available physical robots (Zeno, FACE) and their virtual representations with active perception in order to drive low- and high level reactive behaviors in support of interactive educational and pedagogical goals.

50|$|The Advanced Disc Filing System (ADFS) is a {{computing}} {{file system}} particular to the Acorn computer range and RISC OS-based successors. Initially {{based on the}} rare Acorn Winchester Filing System, it was renamed to the Advanced Disc Filing System when support for floppy discs was added (utilising a WD1770 floppy <b>disc</b> <b>controller)</b> and on later 32-bit systems a variant of a PC-style floppy controller.|$|E

5000|$|With {{additional}} software, it {{was possible}} to read and write to MS-DOS-formatted floppies as well. Numerous commercial and public-domain programs for this purpose became available, the best-known being SOGWAP's [...] "Big Blue Reader". Although the C128 could not run any DOS-based software, this capability allowed data files to be exchanged with PC users. Reading Atari 8-bit 130 kB or 180 kB disks was possible as well with special software, but the standard Atari 8-bit 90 kB format, which used FM rather than MFM encoding, could not be handled by the 1571 hardware without modifying the drive circuitry as the control line that determines if FM or MFM encoding is used by the <b>disc</b> <b>controller</b> chip was permanently wired to ground (MFM mode) rather than being under software control.|$|E
5000|$|Aster {{computers}} {{was based}} {{in the small town}} of Arkel near the town of Gorinchem.Initially Aster computer b.v. was called MCP (Music print Computer Product), because it was specialized in producing computer assisted printing of sheet music. The director of the company was interested in Microprocessor technology and noticed there was a market for selling kits to computer building amateurs, so they started selling electronic kits to hobbyists, and employed four persons at that time [...] They also assembled kits for people without soldering skills, especially the [...] "junior Computer" [...] from Elektor (a copy of the KIM-1), and the ZX80 from Sinclair. Among the kits sold there were also alternative floppy disk drives for TRS-80 computers. But these needed the infamous TRS-80 expansion interface, which was very expensive, and had a very unreliable floppy disk controller because it used the WD1771 floppy <b>disc</b> <b>controller</b> chip without an external [...] "data separator". To fix this problem MCP developed a small plugin board which could be plugged into the socket for the WD1771, and which contained a data separator, and a socket for the WD1791 to support dual-density operation. Still, the expansion interface was expensive and due to its design it was also unreliable. So they decided to also develop their own alternative in the form of an improved floppy disk controller and printer interface that could be built right into a floppy disk enclosure. The lack of RAM expansion offered by this solution was solved by a service in which the 16 KB RAM chips inside the base unit would be replaced by 64 KB RAM chips.While this went on MCP renamed itself to MCP CHIP but ran into problems with the German computer magazine CHIP, and had to return to its former name. At that time MCP did also sell imported home computers like the TRS-80, the Video Genie, (another TRS-80 clone), the Luxor ABC 80 and the Apple II.They also sold the exotic Olivetti M20, a very early 16-bit personal computer that was one of the very few systems to use a Z8000 CPU.|$|E
5000|$|During development, a bug was {{discovered}} that would randomly trigger hyperspace even when the corresponding button on the controller was not pressed. It was determined that simultaneously pressing the <b>controller</b> <b>disc</b> in a certain direction and using the controller's side action buttons was being interpreted by the console as pressing the key on the keypad that activated hyperspace. Ultimately, as the bug could not be removed completely, the developers added the [...] "black holes" [...] {{to explain why the}} player would sometimes jump to hyperspace at random.|$|R

40|$|Critical design issues when {{designing}} a fault-tolerant multiprocessor database server are identi ed as: 1) System design {{must be based}} on components with well defined states and state transitions. 2) Component redundancy is the foundation for a fault-tolerant design. 3) The system should be a shared nothing architecture using homogeneous coarse grained nodes. 4) Basic fault detection must be done in hardware. Fault masking and repair should be done in software to achieve flexibility and dynamic reconfigurability. 5) A database system is well-adapted to fault-tolerance because of its well-defined transaction concept. This concept is available externally and should be used internally. 6) The interconnection network should be multipath, have large communication capacity, and must be able to handle crashed nodes or channels.

50|$|Each player rules {{his or her}} own {{island and}} uses the <b>controller</b> <b>disc</b> to move a {{rectangular}} cursor around the screen.

40|$|Abstract — Pirn winding is an {{operation}} of winding yarn from supply yarn package onto pirns {{which are used}} for shuttle weft insertion. Firm and coherent winding tension is required to maintain in the pirn winding process to withstand the high forces produced by the deceleration of the shuttle {{at the end of}} each pick and to avoid permanent strains in yarns which will appears as fabric defects in weaving. The package size and its diameter vary due to subsequent winding of pirns. Hence the balloon effect varies and caused to change the thread tension at the winding point of the pirn. The thread tension variation is considerably significant from the first pirn wound from a package to the last pirn wound from the same if no tension controlling mechanism is devised. Placing dead weights on the <b>disc</b> tension <b>controller</b> which adds a tension to take off tension may help to compensate the yarn tension variation to some extent to combat with this problem. However, this is a stepwise manual compensation technique which needs the correct timing of compensation to avoid significant tension variations in pirn windings. The author attempted to theoretically analyze the tension variation in the yarn path of the pirn winding machine and theoretically model the tension variation with and without deadweight placement on the tensioners. Author also verified the accuracy and the validity of the model developed through the experimental results obtained at different locations along the yarn path. ...|$|R

Code-named Project Café, it was officially introduced on June 7, 2011 with its final name, Wii U. The console released in North America on November 18, and in Europe, Australia and New Zealand on November 30, 2012, officially starting the [...] "eighth generation" [...] of video game consoles. Features of the new console include HD graphics support (on Wii U only), and a controller, the Wii U GamePad, which features a 6.2 inch touch screen built-in that {{can be used as a}} second screen providing added info and interactivity, such as [...] "asymmetric gameplay". The Wii U GamePad allows some games to be played without needing a TV set, through Off-TV Play. Most peripheral hardware from its predecessor, the Wii, such as the Wii Remote and Wii Nunchuk, Classic Controller and Wii Balance Board are confirmed to work with the new console, and the console is backward compatible with all Wii and Virtual Console titles. The Wii U discontinues backward-compatibility support for GameCube <b>discs</b> and <b>controllers,</b> which also means that Wii games that support the GameCube's controller will instead require use of an alternate control scheme such as the Classic Controller when playing them on the Wii U. The Wii U also has its own more conventional controller, the Wii U Pro Controller, which resembles an Xbox 360 controller in form and function and is compatible with most Wii U and Virtual Console titles, but not original Wii games. The console is available in two sets. The basic set includes the Wii U console with 8 GB of internal memory, the Wii U GamePad, an AC adapter, an HDMI cable and the Wii Sensor Bar. The Deluxe set includes all of the items in the basic set, but it has 32 GB of internal memory instead of only 8 GB and is bundled with a GamePad charging cradle, stands for the GamePad and the console, as well as Nintendo Land. On November 30, 2012, the Wii U was released in Europe, Australia and New Zealand. A sensor bar is not included in the Basic set in Europe, Australia and New Zealand.|$|R
