40|$|The {{problem of}} {{shielding}} against high-energy neutrons has always attracted {{a great deal}} of attention. Neutron shielding requires slowing down energetic neutrons and absorbing with a shield material. Concrete {{is one of the best}} known materials for neutron shielding and <b>ferro-boron</b> is described as an alternative shielding material in this study. FLUKA Monte Carlo simulation code was used for the application of shielding calculation. When the simulation results are compared, it is clear that <b>ferro-boron</b> is more effective in neutron shielding than the concrete...|$|E
40|$|AbstractShields around {{core and}} {{blankets}} form {{major part of}} reactor assembly in fast reactors. Among the advanced shield materials considered for use in future FBRs, planned to be constructed in India, <b>Ferro-boron</b> is a cheap and indigenously available material. This paper reports the results of experiments conducted in the south end neutron beam of KAMINI reactor on the fast, epithermal and thermal neutron flux attenuation behaviour of <b>Ferro-boron</b> with different percentages of boron as well as boron carbide. The attenuation factors were found over a thickness of 20 - 30 cm for the measured reaction rates of Pt 195 (n,n’) Pt 195 m, Cd 111 (n, n’) Cd 111 m, Rh 103 (n,n’) Rh 103, In 115 (n,n’) In 115 m, Hf 180 (n,n’) Hf 180 m, Cu 63 (n,) Cu 64, Na 23 (n,) Na 24, Mn 55 (n,) Mn 56 and Au 197 (n,) Au 198 reactions representative of fast, epithermal and thermal neutron fluxes. A comparative analysis with the neutron attenuation behaviour measured in boron carbide powder is also made...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} the present study is to produce low ally PM steel without any {{addition}} and with addition of <b>ferro-boron</b> addition by conventional PM manufacturing route at the different sintering temperature. Design/methodology/approach: Fe-Ni-Cu-Mo-C sintered steel containing 0. 5 percent <b>ferro-boron</b> addition was used in this study. The compacts were prepared by powder metallurgy method involving powder mixing, cold pressing at 700 MPa pressure and sintering at temperatures of 1180, 1200 and 1250 °C in nitrogen+% 4 H 2 atmosphere for 30 minutes. The influence of sintering temperature and boron addition on the hardness and microstructure of P/M steels were investigated. Optical and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) techniques were used for characterization of the sintered steels. Findings: The results show that increasing sintering temperature resulted in increase in hardness values; however, those values were dropped after sintering temperature higher than 1180 °C. On the other hand, Boron addition contributed to hardness values at sintering temperature of 1200 °C. Those values were decreased with increasing sintering temperature. Research limitations/implications: The composition of the sintered steels effect on the density values. The composition of the grain boundaries were affected from sintering temperature. Boron, carbon, molybdenum were seen in the grain boundaries of the specimen having the highest hardness values. It is thought that those compositions strongly effects on hardness values of the specimens. Originality/value: Fe-Ni-Cu-Mo-C base powder with and without boron addition low alloy sintered steel were produced. The effects composition and sintering temperature were investigated...|$|E
40|$|This thesis work {{focus on}} {{evaluating}} the metallurgical bonding between the TiB 2 andiron grains in the Fe-TiB 2 composite. The starting materials were commercial materialsin form of <b>Ferro-boron</b> and Ferro-titanium that together with pure TiB 2 powder formeda material with the composition seen below:FeB + FeTi + TiB 2  52. 3 TiB 2 + 45. 7 Fe + 2 TiDuring sintering an iron liquid phase is formed where the boron from the FeB diffuse tothe titanium in FeTi which enables {{the formation of}} TiB 2. The temperature used in theliquid phase sintering was chosen just above the three phase region, Fe-TiB 2 -liquid inthe phase diagram, to get an adequate densification of the samples. However, thetemperature could not be too high because of the internal stress and deformation thesamples would have been exposed to. After sintering the material properties and microstructure were examined throughPalmqvist indentations, Fargo and Transverse-Rupture-Strength tests and SEM studiesincluding EBSD. Through these tests the hardness was measured to 1323 HV and the microstructureconsidered to be fine with well distributed phases. The EBSD also showed that thebrittle Fe 2 B phase is present close to the TiB 2 grains and that the porosity givesunreliable results for the Fargo and TRS-tests. The composite was impregnated withcopper {{to show that it}} may be possible to achieve wetting of the TiB 2 phase by castingand to perform new tests on the material with less porosity...|$|E
