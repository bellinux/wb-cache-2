After appearing on the show, Conner gave Comăneci his telephone number, but at the time, Comăneci, who was [...] "shy and suspicious of him [...] also sensed that he was being open and honest. For a second, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>tempted</b> to ask for help...I needed to move on and find a better life for myself. Bart told me later that he tried to call me after the show, but Constantin never let me know of his calls." [...] Of Conner's sudden appearance on the show, Comăneci later commented in her memoir, [...] "There was nothing romantic about [...] motivation. It was based on his desire to help a young woman he'd met once who was an icon in our shared sport." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cornered by his {{voicemail}} to Mike Jones requesting meth, Haggard {{told the}} press, [...] "I {{bought it for}} myself but never used it. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>tempted</b> but I never used it." [...] Haggard claimed he bought the meth but threw it away. Haggard claimed {{he had never met}} his accuser. Jones volunteered to take a polygraph test on a KHOW radio show hosted by Peter Boyles, where Jones first made the allegations. However, Jones's responses during the section of the polygraph test about whether he had engaged in sex with Haggard indicated deception. The test administrator, John Kresnik, discounted the test results because of Jones's stress and lack of eating or sleeping. Regardless, Haggard responded by saying, [...] "We're so grateful that he failed a polygraph test this morning, my accuser did." [...] Jones was not asked questions about drug use. Jones expressed doubt that he would retake the test, saying [...] "I've made my point. He's the one who has discredited himself. He should admit it and move on." [...] Eventually, Haggard acknowledged almost all of the allegations against him, including using meth and resigned from all of his leadership positions in religious organizations including the National Association of Evangelicals.|$|E
2500|$|Conner's plane {{arrived at}} LAX at 4:40 pm; he was flown by {{helicopter}} to CBS Studios and landed during a commercial break. After {{appearing on the}} show with Comăneci and Panait, Conner met with [...] Comăneci in the green room, later saying of the meeting:I think I can understand why Nadia said what she did ... She said, 'He (Panit) is my manager. We don't have a relationship, so it doesn't matter if he's married or not.' But it came off really awful. She regrets it, and I don't think she realized how misunderstood she would be. She really got burned. She said the Miami media was really not nice to her. Conner gave Comăneci his telephone number, but at the time, Comăneci, who wasshy and suspicious of him [...] also sensed {{that he was being}} open and honest. For a second, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>tempted</b> to ask for help... I needed to move on and find a better life for myself.

6000|$|Dare sighed whimsically. 'Badly in the morning, when <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> <b>tempted</b> {{to indulge}} overnight, and {{worse in the}} afternoon, when <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> <b>tempted</b> in the morning!' ...|$|R

60|$|LAVINIA. They say we Christians are the proudest devils on earth--that {{only the}} weak <b>are</b> meek. Oh, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> worse than you. I ought {{to send you}} to death; and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>tempting</b> you.|$|R
5000|$|Devon telling Ellie [...] "How could <b>I</b> <b>be</b> <b>tempted</b> by a {{hamburger}} when I have steak at home?" [...] is {{an homage to}} the famous quip by Paul Newman to his wife Joanne Woodward.|$|R
6000|$|SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. What {{this woman}} said is quite true. But, Gertrude, listen to me. You don’t realise how <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>tempted.</b> Let {{me tell you}} the whole thing. [Goes towards her.] ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{have in my}} pouch here, Egbert, some cakes, which I cooked this morning, and a capon {{which one}} of the monks of Croyland gave me. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>tempted</b> to throw it away as I ran." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Drink, man, drink!" [...] cried Nicholas impatiently, [...] "before <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>tempted</b> {{to change}} my mind. Christina, {{provided}} you marry her, is the richest bride in Zandam. There is the deed; read it; and read quickly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Poor Aunt!" [...] he said. [...] "Almost <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>tempted</b> to <b>be</b> {{sorry for}} her. Two girls--fighting {{one against the}} other for Elmhurst--and both fawning before a cruel and {{malicious}} old woman who could never love anyone but herself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Not much, {{but let me}} say it out, or I {{shall never}} say it. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>tempted</b> now to go away. There seem to be hands {{dragging}} me from the door. Let me come in, if you can trust me for this once!' ...|$|R

60|$|The {{occurrence}} interested me, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>tempted</b> {{to experiment}} further. But when I would have essayed it another new and entirely unaccountable force restrained me. For {{the first time}} in my life I felt embarrassment in the presence of a woman.|$|E
5000|$|... "I may {{be forgiven}} for reading between his lines. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>tempted</b> to think that Mr. Holbrooke is only {{discussing}} his own grievances against the English public, and that the real heading of his articles should be 'Holbrooke's v.

6000|$|... 'In the {{abstract}} {{but not in}} the concrete,' said Ursula. 'When it comes to the point, one isn't even tempted--oh, if <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>tempted,</b> I'd marry like a shot. I'm only tempted NOT to.' The faces of both sisters suddenly lit up with amusement.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, don't say that," [...] she protested {{with strange}} earnestness.

I suppose you can hardly understand what I mean." ...|$|R
60|$|This, however, was {{afterwards}} {{of use to}} me, {{the impression}} continuing on my mind; so that often, when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>tempted</b> to buy some unnecessary thing, I said to myself, Don't give {{too much for the}} whistle; and I saved my money.|$|E
