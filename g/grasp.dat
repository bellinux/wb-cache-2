40|$|Abstract — the {{analysis}} of human <b>grasping</b> movement is important in developing methodologies for controlling robots or understanding human motion programs. In analyzing human <b>grasping</b> movement, it is advantageous to classify movements. In previous papers, classifications of <b>grasping</b> patterns were proposed according to the posture. Among these classifications of <b>grasping</b> patterns, no unified view has been reached as yet. The measured quantities in <b>grasping</b> have included only the posture of the hand, force and its distribution. Few have pertained to classifications based on <b>grasping</b> force and its distribution. This paper first tries to analyze the effect of visual information on <b>grasping</b> movements, and then attempts to classify <b>grasping</b> movements broadly according to their purpose. For {{the elements of the}} purposes of <b>grasping</b> movements, movements that were decided upon were those which require attention, snapping or the adjustment of the wrist or movements which do not require any special action to achieve their purpose. Secondly, we focus on the tactile information to predict with a limitation of movement. Finally, we attempted to discuss the relation between human brain activity and <b>grasping</b> movement on cognitive tasks.

40|$|AbstractWhen {{the space}} robot captures a {{floating}} target, contact impact occurs inevitably and frequently between the manipulator {{hand and the}} target, which seriously impacts the position and attitude of the robot and <b>grasping</b> security. “Dynamic <b>grasping</b> area” is introduced to describe the collision process of manipulator <b>grasping</b> target, and <b>grasping</b> area control equation is established. By analyzing the impact of <b>grasping</b> control parameters, base and target mass on the <b>grasping</b> process and combining the life experience, {{it is found that}} if the product of speed control parameter and dB adjustment parameter is close to but smaller than the minimum <b>grasping</b> speed, collision impact in the <b>grasping</b> process could be reduced greatly, and then an ideal <b>grasping</b> strategy is proposed. Simulation results indicate that during the same period, the strategy <b>grasping</b> is superior to the accelerating <b>grasping,</b> in that the amplitude of impact force is reduced to 20 %, and the attitude control torque is reduced to 15 %, and the impact on the robot is eliminated significantly. The results would have important academic value and engineering significance...|$|R
5|$|Slow lorises have a {{powerful}} <b>grasp</b> with both their hands and feet due to several specializations. They can tightly <b>grasp</b> branches with little effort because of a special muscular arrangement in their hands and feet, where the thumb diverges at nearly 180° {{from the rest of}} the fingers, while the hallux (big toe) ranges between being perpendicular and pointing slightly backwards. The toes have a large flexor muscle that originates on the lower end of the thigh bone, which helps to impart a strong grasping ability to the hind limbs. The second digit of the hand is short compared to the other digits, while on the foot, the fourth toe is the longest. The sturdy thumb helps to act like a clamp when digits three, four, and five <b>grasp</b> the opposite side of a tree branch. This gives their hands and feet a pincer-like appearance. The strong grip can be held for hours without losing sensation due to the presence of a rete mirabile (network of capillaries), a trait shared among all lorises. Both slender and slow lorises have relatively short feet. Like nearly all lemuriforms, they have a grooming claw on the second toe of each foot.|$|E

40|$|We {{aimed at}} {{understanding}} the relative contribution of visual information and hand shaping to the neuronal activity of medial posterior parietal area V 6 A, a newly added {{area in the}} monkey cortical <b>grasping</b> circuit. Two Macaca fascicularis performed a Reach-to-Grasp task {{in the dark and}} in the light, <b>grasping</b> objects of different shapes. We found that V 6 A contains Visual cells, activated only during <b>grasping</b> in the light; Motor neurons, equally activated during <b>grasping</b> in the dark and in the light; Visuomotor cells, differently activated while <b>grasping</b> in the dark and in the light. Visual, Motor, and Visuomotor neurons were moderately or highly selective during <b>grasping,</b> whereas they reduced their selectivity during object observation without performing <b>grasping.</b> The use of the same experimental design employed in the dorsolateral <b>grasping</b> area AIP by other authors allowed us to compare the grasp-related properties of V 6 A and AIP.

40|$|This paper proposes {{the use of}} {{artificial}} neural networks (ANNs) {{in the framework of}} a biomechanical hand model for <b>grasping.</b> ANNs enhance the model capabilities as they substitute estimated data for the experimental inputs required by the <b>grasping</b> algorithm used.

Several neural network architectures are tested and compared in terms of prediction errors, leading to encouraging results. The performance of the overall proposal is also shown through simulation, where a <b>grasping</b> experiment is replicated and compared to the real <b>grasping</b> data collected by a data glove device. ...|$|R
