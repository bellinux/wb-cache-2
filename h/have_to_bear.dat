The group also exercises complete abstinence from expressing opinions on political and controversial issues mainly {{to avoid the}} disputes which would accompany these endorsements. As an organisation, Tabligh Jamaat does not seek donations and is not funded by anyone, in fact members <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> their own expenditures. Since there is no formal registration process and no official membership count has ever been taken, the exact membership statistics remain unknown. The movement discourages interviews with its elders and has never officially released texts, although there are publications associated with the movement (usually referred as TablighiNisaab (Tablighi Curriculum). The emphasis has never been on book learning, but rather on first-hand personal communication.|$|E

25|$|Many {{insects are}} pollinators, {{particularly}} bees, Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths), wasps, flies, ants and beetles. On the other hand, some plants are generalists, being pollinated by insects in several orders. Entomophilous plant species have frequently evolved mechanisms {{to make themselves}} more appealing to insects, e.g., brightly coloured or scented flowers, nectar, or appealing shapes and patterns. Pollen grains of entomophilous plants are generally larger than the fine pollens of anemophilous (wind-pollinated) plants, which has to be produced in much larger quantities because such a high proportion is wasted. This is energetically costly, but in contrast, entomophilous plants <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> the energetic costs of producing nectar.|$|E
25|$|An {{advantage}} of this design was that the main landing gear, which retracted through an 85-degree angle, {{was attached to the}} fuselage, making it possible to completely remove the wings for servicing without additional equipment to support the fuselage. It also allowed simplification of the wing structure, since it did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> the loads imposed during takeoff or landing. The one major drawback of this landing gear arrangement was its narrow wheel track, making the aircraft unstable while on the ground. To increase stability, the legs were splayed outward somewhat, creating another problem in that the loads imposed during takeoff and landing were transferred up through the legs at an angle.|$|E

Bianchi, Felisatti and cinematographer Franco Delli Colli would collaborate again the following year in La moglie di mio padre. Nude per l'assassino score was written by Berto Pisano, who would also go on to write the score for Bianchi's 1979 film Malabimba. Bianchi would later cast Femi Benussi, who portrayed one of the slain models, in two other films—La moglie di mio padre and Cara dolce niopte.|$|E

500|$|Males often adopt lekking as a {{strategy}} {{on the part of}} males to garner females for mating. Territories are established by males {{on the basis of the}} local distribution of female groups, which in turn is determined by the habitat, so as to ensure greater access to females. The males actively defend resources in their territories, nearly [...] in size; territories are marked with scent (using preorbital gland and interdigital gland secretions, faeces and urine) While other males are not allowed into these territories, females are allowed to visit these places to forage. The male can attempt mating with visiting females. Lekking is a demanding strategy, as the males often <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> injuries [...] thus it is a tactic typically adopted by strong, dominant males. Males may either defend their mates or try to forcibly copulate with them. Weaker males, who may not be dominant, might choose the second method.|$|E
500|$|On 18 February 1972 {{the state}} formed the Bangladesh Women's Rehabilitation Board, which was tasked with helping {{the victims of}} rape and {{to help with the}} {{adoption}} programme. Several international agencies took part in the adoption programme, such as Mother Teresa's Sisters of Charity. The majority of the war babies were adopted in the Netherlands and Canada as the state wished to remove the reminders of Pakistan from the newly formed nation. However, not all women wanted their child taken, and some were forcibly removed and sent for adoption, a practice which was encouraged by Rahman, who said, [...] "I do not want those polluted blood in this country". While many women were glad for the abortion programme, as they did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> a child conceived of rape, others had to go full term, filled with hatred towards the child they carried. Others, who had their children adopted out so as to return to [...] "mainstream life", would not look at their newborn as it was taken from them. In the 1990s many of these children returned to Bangladesh to search for their birth mothers. In 2008, D'Costa attempted to find those who had been adopted, however very few responded, one who did said [...] "I hated being a kid, and I am angry at Bangladesh for not taking care of me when I needed it most. I don’t have any roots and that makes me cry. So that is why I am trying to learn more about where I was born." ...|$|E
