5|$|According to Herodotus, {{after the}} Persian navy began its maneuvers, Aristides {{arrived at the}} Allied camp from Aegina. Aristides had been {{recalled}} from exile {{along with the other}} ostracised Athenians on the order of Themistocles, so that Athens might be united against the Persians. Aristides told Themistocles that the Persian fleet had encircled the Allies, which greatly pleased Themistocles, as he now knew that the Persians had walked into his trap. The Allied commanders seem to <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>this</b> news rather uncomplainingly, and Holland therefore suggests that they were party to Themistocles's ruse all along. Either way, the Allies prepared for battle, and Themistocles delivered a speech to the marines before they embarked on the ships. In the ensuing battle, the cramped conditions in the Straits hindered the much larger Persian navy, which became disarrayed, and the Allies took advantage to win a famous victory.|$|E
5|$|Harald's reign {{was marked}} by his {{background}} as a military commander, as he often solved disputes with harsh force. One of his skalds even boasted about how Harald broke settlements he had made, in his battles in the Mediterranean. While the sagas largely focus on Harald's war with Sweyn and the invasion of England, little is said about his domestic policies. Modern historians <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>this</b> as a sign that, despite his absolutism, his reign was one of peace and progress for Norway. Harald is considered to have instituted good economic policies, as he developed a Norwegian currency and a viable coin economy, which in turn allowed Norway to participate in international trade. He initiated trade with Kievan Rus' and the Byzantine Empire through his connections, {{as well as with}} Scotland and Ireland. According to the later sagas, Harald founded Oslo, where he spent much time.|$|E
5|$|Just to {{the south}} of the castle is the {{restored}} 18th-century castle watermill. In 2010 the castle received 128,242 visitors. Dunster Castle has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade I listed building and Scheduled Ancient Monument. The castle has required continuing maintenance work, in particular to its roof, itself an important historical feature. Efforts have been made to gradually redecorate the castle in a period style, using reproductions of original wallpapers and materials. The National Trust installed solar panels behind the battlements on the roof in 2008 to provide electricity and make the premises more environmentally friendly. This {{was the first time the}} National Trust <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>this</b> approach to a Grade I listed building, and it is expected to save 1,714kg (3,778lb) of carbon a year. In 2015, the National Trust announced plans to make the 19th-century reservoir open to the public.|$|E

25|$|Shaftesbury {{was nearly}} forty before he married, {{and even then}} he appears to <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>this</b> step at the urgent {{instigation}} of his friends, mainly to supply a successor to the title. The object of his choice (or rather of his second choice, for an earlier project of marriage had shortly before fallen through) was Jane Ewer, {{the daughter of a}} Hertfordshire gentleman. The marriage took place in the autumn of 1709, and on 9 February 1711, was born at his house at Reigate, in Surrey, his only child and heir, the fourth Earl, to whose manuscript accounts we are in great part indebted for the details of his father's life. The match appears to have been happy, though Shaftesbury had little sentiment on the subject of married life.|$|E

25|$|Among the Masoretic {{creation}} estimates or calculations for {{the date}} of creation Ussher's specific chronology dating the creation to 4004 BC became the most accepted and popular, mainly because this specific date {{was attached to the}} King James Bible. The youngest ever recorded date of creation within the historic Jewish or Christian traditions is 3616 BC, by Yom-Tov Lipmann Heller in the 17th century while the oldest proposed date was 6984 BC by Alfonso X of Castile. However some contemporary or more recent proponents of Young Earth Creationism <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>this</b> figure back further by several thousands of years by proposing significant gaps in the genealogies in chapters 5 and 11 of the Book of Genesis. Harold Camping for example dated the creation to 11,013 BC, while Christian Charles Josias Bunsen in the 19th century dated the creation to 20,000 BC.|$|E
25|$|As the {{consensus}} of Japanese jurists is that Japanese forces did not technically commit violations of international law, many right wing elements in Japan <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>this</b> to mean that war crimes trials were examples of victor's justice. They see those convicted of war crimes as , Shōwa being the name given {{to the rule of}} Hirohito. This interpretation is vigorously contested by Japanese peace groups and the political left. In the past, these groups have tended to argue that the trials hold some validity, either under the Geneva Convention (even though Japan hadn't signed it), or under an undefined concept of international law or consensus. Alternatively, they have argued that, although the trials may not have been technically valid, they were still just, somewhat in line with popular opinion in the West and in the rest of Asia.|$|E
25|$|Many {{scholars}} of Islam <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>this</b> as a classification of the sura as {{stemming from the}} earlier Meccan period and have shown the Pope to be mistaken {{by pointing out that}} Surah 2 was revealed in various stages and that this verse was revealed after Muhammad's hijra from Mecca, during his period of stay in Medina and hence is from the Medinan period which was the final stage of the revelation of the Qur'an when the Muslims were becoming numerous and increasingly powerful and safe from the immediate dangers that had overshadowed them for 13 years in Mecca. The scholars also point out that the Pope failed to mention that even if this verse was revealed when the Muslims were weak, they could have easily abrogated it with another verse which gave them permission to forcefully convert people once they finally conquered Mecca; this, however, did not happen.|$|E

25|$|There is no {{evidence}} that the Lode was navigable beyond Soham. Lighters brought cargoes of corn to a water mill at Soham, and later brought coal when steam engines replaced the water wheel. Barley and timber were other important cargoes. Railways did not reach Soham until 1879, and resulted in the rapid demise of water-borne transport. Commercial traffic ceased about 1900, and the lode was described as un-navigable in a report by H. Dunn in 1906. There was a sluice at the entrance to the lode, with two sets of mitre gates, pointing in opposite directions, one to prevent flood waters from the Great Ouse entering the lode, and the other to raise the water level in the lode to make navigation easier. When the Anglian Water Authority was created by Act of Parliament in 1977, the lode was not listed as a navigation, and their successors, the Environment Agency, <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>this</b> to mean that there is no right of navigation.|$|E

It was the second highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following Married... with Children. Since airing, the episode has received mixed reviews from television critics.

500|$|Stuart Jones of The Times {{concluded}} in his match report that The Football Association (FA) were given no choice, [...] "but to charge Arsenal and Manchester United with misconduct and with bringing the game into disrepute." [...] United took immediate action by conducting an internal enquiry. Ferguson ordered his players {{to the training}} ground, where they rewatched the match. It is believed the club later fined Irwin, McClair and Ince. Arsenal followed United's example; participants Davis, Rocastle, Thomas, Limpar and Winterburn were all penalised, as well as manager Graham, who was fined £9,000. Arsenal chairman Peter Hill-Wood said of his decision: [...] "Twice in two years is too often.

500|$|In {{anticipation}} of the annexation of the Republic of Texas, which had established independence in 1836, Taylor was sent in April 1844 to Fort Jesup in Louisiana. He was ordered to guard against any attempts by Mexico to reclaim the territory. There were more senior generals in the army who might <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>this</b> important command, such as Winfield Scott and Edmund P. Gaines. But both were known members of the Whig Party, and Harrison's apolitical reputation and friendly relations with Andrew Jackson made him the choice of Democratic President James K. Polk. Polk directed him to deploy into disputed territory in Texas, [...] "on or near the Rio Grande" [...] near Mexico. Taylor chose a spot at Corpus Christi, and his Army of Occupation encamped there until the following spring in {{anticipation of}} a Mexican attack.|$|E
500|$|Till-Holger Borchert {{observes that}} Francis's feet are {{positioned}} slightly too {{high above the}} rest of his body, making them [...] "so bizarrely placed as to look like a foreign body". Others <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>this</b> as an indication of a less experienced and weaker workshop painter, but Borchert draws a similarity to two works accepted as van Eyck originals. In the [...] "Adoration of the Mystic Lamb of God" [...] panel of the c.1432 Ghent Altarpiece, the prophets kneel in a similar way with their feet placed awkwardly behind them. The donor in the c.1435 Madonna of Chancellor Rolin is in a similar pose, although his feet are not visible. While some critics view the positioning of Francis's feet as a weakness, Joseph Rishel of the Philadelphia Museum of Art argues that the contortion is necessary to show both wounds, and that the unusual positioning adds to the mystical tone of the painting.|$|E

500|$|Natural {{theology}} was not {{a unified}} doctrine, and while some such as Louis Agassiz were strongly opposed to the ideas in the book, others sought a reconciliation in which evolution was seen as purposeful. In the Church of England, some liberal clergymen interpreted natural selection {{as an instrument of}} God's design, with the cleric Charles Kingsley seeing it as [...] "just as noble a conception of Deity". In the second edition of January 1860, Darwin quoted Kingsley as [...] "a celebrated cleric", and added the phrase [...] "by the Creator" [...] to the closing sentence, which from then on read [...] "life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms or into one". While some commentators <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>this</b> as a concession to religion that Darwin later regretted, Darwin's view at the time was of God creating life through the laws of nature, and even in the first edition there are several references to [...] "creation".|$|E
500|$|The {{questions}} about the veracity of Chatwin's writing are compounded by the revelation of his sexual orientation and the true cause of his death. Once it became known that Chatwin had been bisexual and had died of an AIDS-related illness, some critics viewed him as a liar and dismissed his work. Nicholas Shakespeare said, [...] "His denial [...] bred a sense that if he lied about his life, he must have lied about his work. Some readers <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>this</b> as a cue to pass judgement on his books – or else not to bother with them." [...] In 2010 The Guardian's review of Under the Sun: The Letters of Bruce Chatwin opened with the question, [...] "Does anyone read Bruce Chatwin these days?" [...] However, Rory Stewart has stated, [...] "His personality, his learning, his myths, and even his prose are less hypnotizing [...] And yet he remains a great writer, of deep and enduring importance.” In 2008 The Times [...] named Chatwin #46 on their list of [...] "50 Greatest British Writers Since 1945".|$|E
