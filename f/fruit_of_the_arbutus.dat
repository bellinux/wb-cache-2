Beekeeping is also common in the hills surrounding the parish, resulting in an itinerant economy in wax and honey collected from local beehives.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>fruits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{strawberry}} tree (<b>Arbutus</b> unedo L.) are consumed mainly as processed product, {{but may be}} a good source of antioxidants if consumed as fresh <b>fruit.</b> <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> present study was to identify and quantify the antioxidant components present in {{strawberry tree}} fruits, including flavonoids, vitamins C and E and carotenoids. The fruits are a very good source of antioxidants precisely because they have a high flavonoid content (32. 37 mg/ 100 g edible portion) and, within this group of antioxidant compounds, proanthocyanidins are the most abundant, representing more than 80 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total flavonoid contents. Anthocyanins are also present as glycosides of cyanidin and delphinidin, with cyanidin- 3 -galactoside the most abundant. Other antioxidants present in this fruit were ellagic acid and its diglucoside derivative. Vitamin C, vitamin E and carotenoids were also identified and quantified. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|In the Mediterranean region <b>the</b> <b>fruits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{strawberry}} tree (<b>Arbutus</b> unedo L.) may be fermented and distilled {{to produce a}} traditional beverage very much appreciated in Southern Europe. <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> present work was to study <b>the</b> diversity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> yeast population and <b>the</b> killer activity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> isolates identified as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, obtained during solid state industrial fermentations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>arbutus</b> berries. <b>The</b> identification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> isolates was performed by the 5. 8 S rRNA-ITS region restriction analysis and by sequencing the D 1 /D 2 region <b>of</b> <b>the</b> large subunit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rRNA gene. At <b>the</b> start <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fermentations, various non-Saccharomyces species were detected including Aureobasidium pullulans, Dothichiza pithyophila, Dioszegia zsoltii, Hanseniaspora uvarum and yeasts belonging to the genera Metschnikowia, Cryptococcus and Rhodotorula. However, as the biological processes progressed <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> different species decreased with S. cerevisiae and Pichia membranaefaciens becoming dominant at advanced stages <b>of</b> <b>the</b> must fermentation that is characterized by high concentrations of ethanol. Forty three isolates identified as S. cerevisiae were tested for killer activity against two sensitive reference strains and Zygosaccharomyces bailii. Their killer sensitivity in relation to five killer referenced toxins (K 2, K 5, K 8, K 9 and K 10) was also studied. Out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> isolates analyzed, 95. 3 % were sensitive and 4. 7 % were tolerant against the killer toxins tested. Only three isolates revealed killer activity against one sensitive strain and two <b>of</b> them against <b>the</b> spoiler yeast Z. bailii. The microbiota obtained revealed an interesting potential {{to be used as}} starter cultures to overcome unpredictable uncontrolled fermentations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>arbutus</b> <b>fruits</b> as well as in other applications of biotechnological interest.
