25|$|Chickens were domesticated {{at least}} 7,000 years ago, with fossils in China from c. 5400 BC. The chicken's wild {{ancestor}} is Gallus gallus, the red junglefowl of Southeast Asia, and another species, probably the <b>grey</b> <b>junglefowl</b> of India. It {{appears to have}} been kept initially for cockfighting rather than for food.|$|E
25|$|Advances in DNA {{sequencing}} technology allow the nuclear genome to be accessed and analyzed {{in a population}} genetics framework. The increased resolution of nuclear sequences has demonstrated that gene flow is common, not only between geographically diverse domestic populations {{of the same species}} but also between domestic populations and wild species that never gave rise to a domestic population. The yellow leg trait possessed by numerous modern commercial chicken breeds was acquired via introgression from the <b>grey</b> <b>junglefowl</b> indigenous to South Asia. African cattle are hybrids that possess both a European Taurine cattle maternal mitochondrial signal and an Asian Indicine cattle paternal Y-chromosome signature. Numerous other bovid species, including bison, yak, banteng, and gaur also hybridize with ease. Cats and horses have been shown to hybridize with many closely related species, and domestic honey bees have mated with so many different species they now possess genomes more variable than their original wild progenitors. The archaeological and genetic data suggests that long-term bidirectional gene flow between wild and domestic stocks - including donkeys, horses, New and Old World camelids, goats, sheep, and pigs - was common. Bidirectional gene flow between domestic and wild reindeer continues today.|$|E

500|$|Chickens are medium-sized, chunky {{birds with}} an upright stance and characterised by fleshy red combs and wattles on their heads. Males, known as cocks, are usually larger, more boldly coloured, {{and have more}} exaggerated plumage than females (hens). Chickens are gregarious, omnivorous, ground-dwelling birds that in their natural {{surroundings}} search among the leaf litter for seeds, invertebrates, and other small animals. They seldom fly except {{as a result of}} perceived danger, preferring to run into the undergrowth if approached. Today's domestic chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is mainly descended from the wild red junglefowl of Asia, with some additional input from [...] <b>grey</b> <b>junglefowl.</b> Domestication is believed to have taken place between 7,000 and 10,000 years ago, and what are thought to be fossilized chicken bones have been found in northeastern China dated to around 5,400 BC. Archaeologists believe domestication was originally for the purpose of cockfighting, the male bird being a doughty fighter. By 4,000 years ago, chickens seem to have reached the Indus Valley and 250 years later, they arrived in Egypt. They were still used for fighting and were regarded as symbols of fertility. The Romans used them in divination, and the Egyptians made a breakthrough when they learned the difficult technique of artificial incubation. Since then, the keeping of chickens has spread around the world for the production of food with the domestic fowl being a valuable source of both eggs and meat.|$|E

50|$|The {{other three}} members of the genus — Sri Lanka junglefowl (Gallus lafayetii), <b>grey</b> <b>junglefowl</b> (Gallus sonneratii), and the green junglefowl (Gallus varius) — do not usually produce fertile hybrids with the red junglefowl, {{suggesting}} that it is the sole ancestor of the domestic chicken. However, recent research has revealed the absence of the yellow skin gene in the wild red junglefowl found in domestic birds, which suggests hybridisation with the <b>grey</b> <b>junglefowl</b> during the domestication of the species. A culturally significant hybrid between the red junglefowl and the green junglefowl in Indonesia is known as the bekisar.|$|E

50|$|The {{species is}} {{mainly in the}} Indian Peninsula but extends into Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and south Rajasthan.

5000|$|Typical {{broilers}} have white {{feathers and}} yellowish skin.

50|$|The red junglefowl (Gallus gallus) is a {{tropical}} {{member of the}} family Phasianidae. It is the primary progenitor of the domestic chicken (though genetic evidence strongly suggests some past hybridisation with the <b>grey</b> <b>junglefowl</b> as well). The red junglefowl was first domesticated at least five thousand years ago in Asia. Since then it has spread around the world, and the domestic form is kept globally as a very productive food source of both meat and eggs.|$|E

Bird like red-whiskered bulbul, common iora, white-browed wagtail, grey wagtail, pied bush chat, Blyth's reed warbler, barn swallow, spotted dove, Asian paradise flycatcher, brahminy kite, long-tailed shrike and over 100 species of birds have been identified.|$|E

5000|$|They {{are found}} in thickets, {{on the forest floor}} and open scrub. Their loud calls of Ku-kayak-kyuk-kyuk (...) are loud and distinctive, and can be heard in the early mornings and at dusk. Unlike the red junglefowl, the male does not flap its wing before uttering the call. They forage in small mixed or single sex groups. They breed from February to May. They lay 4 to 7 eggs which are pale creamy in a scrape. Eggs hatch in about 21 days. Although mostly seen on the ground, <b>grey</b> <b>junglefowl</b> fly into trees to escape predators and to roost.|$|E
50|$|Domesticated birds principally mean poultry, {{raised for}} meat and eggs: some Galliformes (chicken, turkey, guineafowl) and Anseriformes (waterfowl: duck, goose, swan).
