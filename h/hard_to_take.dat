25|$|Paul Williams, who {{suffered}} from sickle-cell disease, fell into depression because of the stress of touring and personal issues. By the late 1960s, he had developed a serious case of alcoholism. Having never previously consumed anything stronger than milk, he began to drink quite heavily, and it was <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>take,</b> according to Otis Williams. As his {{physical and mental health}} began to decline sharply, it made performing increasingly difficult. Williams began traveling with oxygen tanks, and the other four Temptations made valiant efforts to raid and drain his alcohol stashes.|$|E
25|$|By 1992, the {{marriage}} of the Prince and Princess of Wales had broken down. The Queen and Philip hosted a meeting between Charles and Diana, trying to effect a reconciliation, but without success. Philip wrote to Diana, expressing his disappointment at both Charles's and her extra-marital affairs, and asking her to examine both his and her behaviour from the other's point of view. The Duke was direct and Diana was sensitive. She found the letters <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>take,</b> but nevertheless she appreciated that he was acting with good intent. Charles and Diana separated and later divorced.|$|E

25|$|Some educated parties {{note that}} the USL v. BSDi case had shown that the Unix {{copyrights}} are weak and unenforceable. SCO has not claimed patent infringement, as according to the US Patent and Trademark Office database, no AT or Novell patent was ever assigned to SCO. The UNIX trademark was not owned by SCO. That left arguing over trade secrets, which after some opposition, was <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> beyond a breach of contract between SCO and IBM, and consequentially a claim only against IBM. SCO {{was looking for something}} directed at the greater Linux community, and has since explicitly dropped all trade secret claims from their case.|$|E
25|$|Next, {{a girl of}} twenty-one {{lay dying}} on a stretcher. The father, a big, gentle Boer {{kneeling}} beside her; while, next tent, his wife was watching a child of six, also dying, and one of about five drooping. Already this couple had lost three children {{in the hospital and}} so would not let these go, though I begged <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> them out of the hot tent. I can't describe what it is to see these children lying about in a state of collapse. It’s just exactly like faded flowers thrown away. And one has to stand and look on at such misery, {{and be able to do}} almost nothing.|$|E
25|$|After {{a strong}} placing in the stage 1 time {{trial of the}} 2005 Tour de France, Voigt was only {{trailing}} race leader Armstrong by 1 minute and he tried <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the overall lead. He took part in many attacks, before the first rest day on the 9th stage, he finally got in a break-away that lasted to the line. He finished third, 3 minutes ahead of Armstrong. Voigt's time in the maillot jaune would be short-lived however, as he fell to 168th at stage 10 after a fever, and he was eliminated for failing to finish stage 11 within the time limit. Voigt ended 2005 as 29th on the UCI ProTour individual rankings.|$|E

25|$|The {{detailed}} analysis of CMBR data to produce maps, an angular power spectrum, and ultimately cosmological parameters is a complicated, computationally difficult problem. Although computing a power spectrum from a map is in principle a simple Fourier transform, decomposing {{the map of the}} sky into spherical harmonics, in practice it is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the effects of noise and foreground sources into account. In particular, these foregrounds are dominated by galactic emissions such as Bremsstrahlung, synchrotron, and dust that emit in the microwave band; in practice, the galaxy has to be removed, resulting in a CMB map that is not a full-sky map. In addition, point sources like galaxies and clusters represent another source of foreground which must be removed so as not to distort the short scale structure of the CMB power spectrum.|$|E
25|$|The {{pressure}} on CP-led unions intensified {{after the end}} of World War II. These pressures fell especially hard on the TWU: the government arrested Santo for immigration law violations, and began proceedings to deport him. At the same time, Quill found the CP's political line increasingly <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>take,</b> since it required him to oppose a subway fare increase that he considered necessary for wage increases in 1947, while the CP's support for the candidacy of Henry Wallace threatened to split the CIO. When William Z. Foster, then the general secretary of the CPUSA, told him that the party was prepared to split the CIO to form a third federation and that he might be the logical choice for its leader, Quill decided to break his ties to the CP instead.|$|E
500|$|David Walliams {{was asked}} to guest-star in the episode in an email and he agreed, having {{been a fan of}} the show. He had {{previously}} appeared in the Fifth Doctor audio drama Phantasmagoria where he played two separate characters. Matt Smith called his co-star [...] "hilarious" [...] and found it <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> him seriously, as {{when he was in his}} prosthetics for the part he resembled a giant mole. The prosthetics took about two hours to apply. Walliams felt the make-up was not limiting to his acting, finding it [...] "quite expressive".|$|E
50|$|In 2015, Henry Ford Health System of Detroit {{was working}} on its own design, similar to a {{bathrobe}} with cotton blend. In tests, patients liked the new design. But any update was likely to cost more, as well as <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> care of. The Model G design, {{to be made by}} Carhartt of Michigan, used snaps on the front and shoulders.|$|R
25|$|The {{decision}} {{also depends}} on the relative strengths of the team's batting and bowling. For instance in Test Cricket, a side with only fast bowlers may choose to bowl first <b>to</b> try <b>to</b> <b>take</b> advantage of any early moisture in the pitch, knowing {{that it will be}} <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> wickets later in the match. Similarly a side with a weak opening batting pair may choose to bowl first in order to protect their batsmen.|$|R

500|$|Several other reviews {{were more}} mixed. Kenneth Silber from Space.com was {{critical}} of the episode, noting that the main antagonist is [...] "a veritable caricature of backwoods stupidity and thus <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> seriously". He did, however, compliment the sympathetic qualities of Dr. Wieder and his family. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode two-and-a-half stars out of five, noting that the episode was [...] "just too unambitious an X-File to be {{anything more than a}} collection of moments, only some of which work".|$|E
500|$|Bleacher Reports' Andrew Nuschler observed: [...] "Maddon {{spent his}} tenure as the AL All Star manager finding new and inventive ways to give Ian Kinsler the middle finger." [...] And Sports Illustrateds Jacob Osterhout took note, writing: It is an {{absolute}} travesty that Ian Kinsler is not the starting second baseman for the American League. Dustin Pedroia, who IS the starting second baseman, has hit only three home runs and has 36 RBIs. Kinsler, on the other hand, has hit 20 home runs and has 63 RBIs. The fact that Kinsler isn't even a reserve makes it <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the All Star Game seriously.|$|E

500|$|The {{critical}} {{response to}} Strange Bird, unlike its brief chart history, was overwhelmingly positive. The enthusiastic response even caught the band by surprise; Williams told Rip It Up [...] "I {{could see a}} few holes in the album and I'd say, 'how come {{no one else has}} picked this up?'" [...] Reviewers, however, focused on the positives; Guy Garvey of The Independent said [...] "My favourite of the year is Augie March's Strange Bird", while David Fricke wrote in Rolling Stone of [...] "luxuriant melees of chiming guitars, mountain-stream voices and keyboard grandeur". Donovan said the band found it <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the positive reviews too seriously; [...] "if we did our heads would explode or overinflate", he told Beat.|$|E
500|$|Joe Kernan {{was adamant}} that Diarmuid Marsden {{did not deserve}} to be sent off and criticised players for pretending to be injured during the game. The player himself also {{disagreed}} with the decision: [...] "The umpire said I struck him but I just saw the man coming towards me and {{it was more a}} case of getting myself out of the way or protecting myself." [...] He added: [...] "I'd never been sent off for Armagh before and to be sent off in an All-Ireland final is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>take.</b> Hopefully I won't be remembered for that. And I wouldn't like to end the career on that note." [...] Kernan and Marsden contested the decision and subsequent ban, but the GAA's Games Administration Committee upheld the penalty. However, after taking their case to the Central Council, the ban was overturned.|$|E
500|$|Polygon's Russ Pitts {{found the}} game a {{frustrating}} exercise, his experience {{determined by the}} arbitrary quality of player designed houses, and further obstructed by the harsh consequences of failure. [...] Pitts felt the game valued its message over the player's time and yet found the message <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> seriously; he would describe the game as the most disturbing he had ever played. Keza MacDonald, in her review at IGN, shared these frustrations, finding that tackling player-constructed houses made the game over-reliant on trial and error. She also {{found it hard to}} empathize with the small, pixelated characters, leading her to believe that the game failed in [...] "communicating much of a message". Nick Capozzoli of GameSpot also gave the game a largely negative review, criticising the nihilistic feel, and saying that it did not bring out the emotions it was aimed to.|$|E

5000|$|Tom Sutcliffe of The Independent {{questioned}} {{the wisdom of}} commissioning an entire series of the show, writing: [...] "To my mind, the pilot of Ricky Gervais's comedy about an assistant in a retirement home had already fully explored its awkward - and testing - balance of comedy and emotion." [...] About the titular character, he wrote [...] "It’s Derek’s redeeming qualities that are the <b>hardest</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> - a sense of self-congratulation at the refinement of its own sentiments that {{has a little bit}} of the bully in it too." ...|$|R

500|$|... "Liberty Walk" [...] has {{received}} generally mixed reviews from music critics. Heather Phares of Allmusic commended the upbeat lyrics as being radio Disney-friendly. Similarly, Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly described the song as a [...] "thumping album opener". A reviewer from Sputnik Music noted that [...] "'Liberty Walk' showcases classic Miley spunk a la 'Hoedown Throwdown'". However some reviewers were {{critical of the}} song. Michelle Griffin of the Sydney Morning Herald concluded that [...] "Liberty Walk" [...] would [...] "make Glee's Mr Shue blush". Glenn Gamboa of Newsday labeled it as a [...] "loopy Jason DeRulo rip-off", and stated that [...] "where Cyrus raps, she's <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> seriously." [...] Donald Gibson of Seattle Post-Intelligencer was also unfavorable of the song, who called it a [...] "monotonous opener". Evan Sawdey of PopMatters noted that in [...] "Liberty Walk", Cyrus' [...] "search for a new identity renders her as anonymous and generic-sounding as ever." ...|$|E
500|$|Fred Fielder, {{police chief}} in Helena–West Helena, Arkansas, said the alleged plot in Tennessee {{particularly}} concerned him {{due to the}} fact that 66 percent of the city's 12,200 population are African American; he said to reporters, [...] "Predominantly black school, take your pick." [...] Mark Potok, director of the Southern Poverty Law Center, described the plans and weapons arsenal as frightening, but said, [...] "With the part about wearing top hats...it gets a bit <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> them seriously." [...] Nevertheless, Potok said [...] "the reality is, they might have walked into a black high school and killed 20, 30, 40 people before anybody knew who they were." [...] An editorial in The Daily News Journal in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, said the plot emphasized a dark undercurrent of racism still alive in the United States, but said their chances [...] of actually killing Obama were [...] "almost nil. Their plot was so disorganized they appear to be candidates for 'dumb criminals,' not calculating assassins." ...|$|E
500|$|West Ham manager Alan Pardew {{described}} the defeat {{as hard to}} take: [...] "It felt like a defeat when the third goal went in. We rallied and had a great chance in extra time. We had to dig in. This was a top team we were playing, but I felt {{we were going to}} win. Only a 35-yard Gerrard smasher was going to change that. The players have been magnificent – we are proud of the way we played." [...] Captain Nigel Reo-Coker found defeat <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> as he felt they had done enough to win the final: [...] "I can't describe it how I feel at the moment – gutted because I think we deserved to win this game. The players put in a fantastic effort, but it just wasn't to be for us. It was a marvellous FA Cup final and we gave all we could. I hope everyone was proud – it just wasn't our day." ...|$|E

But that's not only what I expect from Under the Dome, it's what I need. I couldn't be happier that this show is back. I just have one request: BRING BEN BACK NOW.
