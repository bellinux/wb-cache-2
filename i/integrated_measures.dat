40|$|For event-related data {{obtained}} from an experimental paradigm with a periodic design, spectral density at the fundamental frequency of the paradigm {{has been used as}} a template-free activation detection measure. In this article, we build and expand upon this detection measure to create an improved, <b>integrated</b> <b>measure.</b> Such an <b>integrated</b> <b>measure</b> linearly combines information contained in the spectral densities at the fundamental frequency as well as the harmonics of the paradigm and in a spatial correlation function characterizing the degree of co-activation among neighboring voxels. Several figures of merit are described and used to find appropriate values for the coefficients in the linear combination. Using receiver-operating characteristic analysis on simulated functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data sets, we quantify and validate the improved performance of the <b>integrated</b> <b>measure</b> over the spectral density measure based on the fundamental frequency as well as over some other popular template-free data analysis methods. We then demonstrate the application of the new method on an experimental fMRI data set. Finally, several extensions to this work are suggested. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

30|$|An <b>integrated</b> <b>measure</b> of {{uncertainty}} in RST includes both types {{of uncertainty}}. Intuitively, {{the value of an}} <b>integrated</b> roughness <b>measure</b> that includes {{both types of}} uncertainty should be larger than that of a measure that considers only one type of uncertainty. However, rough entropy does not satisfy this requirement: although rough entropy includes both types of uncertainty, the numerical values can be smaller than those of the knowledge uncertainty measure, as shown in Table  1.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} a {{combined}} modeling method using digitized points <b>measured</b> by multiple-sensor <b>integrated</b> <b>measuring</b> {{system with a}} touch probe and a optical scanning probe is presented. The optical scanning data {{in the form of}} triangulated mesh and the high precision data captured by a touch probe on an <b>integrated</b> <b>measuring</b> system are transformed into a common coordinate system by the worktable for registration and improved ICP algorithm. A data merging method is used to keep the high precision of feature surfaces. The merging data is unified into a precise 3 D model in CAD software environment based on the strategy for optimization reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method, which enhances the flexibility of digitizing while maintaining the accuracy of feature surfaces...|$|R

Beyond that, the ecological sustainability of the stadium building will be achieved by innovative <b>integrated</b> <b>measures</b> that will effect in symbiosis long lasting benefits for the stadium operator. This measures include an integrated sun protection by a screen façade helping to minimise the need of air conditioning, a grey water use for toilets and natural green (dual water supply + rainwater) to reduce potable water use by 50%+ and the use of recyclable and low energy building materials. Furthermore, a permanent use of local high efficient cogeneration energy supply for the stadium and the residential area around is scheduled to increase the efficiency of energy production from 60% to 95% - only emergency power supply will be guaranteed by general power grid. Last but not least roof mounted solar panels will save ecological resources and reduce energy costs.|$|E

30|$|This paper {{begins with}} an {{analysis}} of the limitations of the existing uncertainty measures for rough sets. Next, a knowledge uncertainty measure based on general binary relations is presented, which is applicable in classical systems as well, i.e., it is an effective technique to deal with complex data sets. Novel <b>integrated</b> <b>measures</b> based on general binary relations are proposed, and the properties of these <b>integrated</b> <b>measures</b> are analysed. At last, Examples are used to verify the validity of the proposed uncertainty measures.|$|E
3000|$|Comparing {{partitions}} (5) with (6) and (6) with (7), it can {{be observed}} that the boundary region and the classification granularity in the boundary region remain the same, and thus {{the uncertainty of the}} rough set X does not change. Accordingly, σ_P^' (X), ω_P^' (X), [...] H^' (P), [...] G^' (P), ρ_P^' (X) [...] and α_P^' (X) [...] all do not change, which shows that the new <b>integrated</b> <b>measures</b> are unassociated with subdivision of classification granularities unrelated to rough set X. Therefore, the new <b>integrated</b> <b>measures</b> are consistent with human cognition.|$|E

30|$|The {{extension}} of RST to incomplete information systems {{is important for}} making RST practical. Uncertainty measures are the basis for information processing and knowledge acquisition in an incomplete information system. At present, direct processing of an incomplete information system lacks a theoretical basis. By considering {{the nature of the}} roughness of sets, we developed new <b>integrated</b> <b>measures</b> based on general binary relations. Several desirable properties of the proposed measures have been shown. We have demonstrated that the new measures overcome the limitations of existing uncertainty measures and can be used to measure with a simple and comprehensive form the roughness and the accuracy of a rough set, and the results are logically consistent. Research on the application of our proposed <b>integrated</b> <b>measures</b> for rule acquisition is planned.|$|E
