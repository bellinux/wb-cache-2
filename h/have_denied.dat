In an interview, Jackie, Tito, Jermaine and Marlon have also denied that their father is abusive and according to Jermaine, he is, second to Michael, {{one of the most}} misunderstood people.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, the Polish Foreign Ministry {{asked the}} {{government}} of Russia about alleged footage of the massacre filmed by the NKVD during the killings, something the Russians <b>have</b> <b>denied</b> exists. Polish officials believe that this footage, as well as further documents showing cooperation of Soviets with the Gestapo during the operations, are the reason for Russia's decision to classify most of the documents about the massacre.|$|E
5|$|The {{court also}} found the {{affidavit}} of Parker to be insufficient as a factual matter {{to comply with the}} terms of the statute.

5|$|After meeting Tom Cruise {{during the}} filming of Collateral in 2004, Pinkett Smith and Smith donated $20,000 to the Hollywood Education and Literacy Program (HELP), Scientology's basis for homeschooling. The couple came under fire in 2008 {{when they decided to}} fund the now-defunct New Village Leadership Academy, a private {{elementary}} school located in Calabasas, California. The school employed teachers dedicated to Scientology and featured controversial methodologies like Study Technology, created by Church of Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard. The couple <b>have</b> <b>denied</b> claims that they are themselves Scientologists, although in 2017 actress and former Scientologist Leah Remini has stated that Pinkett Smith {{is a member of the}} Church.|$|E
5|$|I thus learnt {{my first}} great {{lesson in the}} inquiry into these obscure fields of knowledge, never to accept the disbelief of great men or their accusations of imposture or of imbecility, as of any weight when opposed to the {{repeated}} observation of facts by other men, admittedly sane and honest. The whole history of science shows us that whenever the educated and scientific men of any age <b>have</b> <b>denied</b> the facts of other investigators on a priori grounds of absurdity or impossibility, the deniers have always been wrong.|$|E
5|$|Marquinhos {{made his}} debut on 16 September in a 2–3 loss against Bologna at the Stadio Olimpico, sent on by manager Zdeněk Zeman to replace Iván Piris for the match's final 15 minutes. By October, Zeman decided to partner Marquinhos for his speed {{alongside}} former Corinthians teammate and fellow Brazilian Leandro Castán in central defence, demoting former starter Nicolás Burdisso to the substitutes' bench.

5|$|Shortly {{before leaving}} the case, Dompig gave an {{interview}} to CBS in which he stated that he believed Holloway probably died from alcohol and/or drug poisoning, was not murdered, and that someone later hid her body. Dompig also stated that Aruba had spent about $3million on the investigation, which was about 40% of the police operational budget. Dompig {{indicated that there was}} evidence that pointed to possession (though not necessarily use) of illicit drugs by Holloway. Members of Holloway's family <b>have</b> <b>denied</b> that she used drugs.|$|E
5|$|The {{second game}} was {{initially}} postponed, but was forfeited by the White Sox {{the next day}} by order of American League president Lee MacPhail. Disco Demolition Night preceded, and may have helped precipitate, the decline of disco in late 1979; some scholars and disco artists have described the event as expressive of racism and homophobia while others <b>have</b> <b>denied</b> this connection. Disco Demolition Night remains well {{known as one of}} the most extreme promotions in major league history.|$|E
5|$|In March 1994, the Washington Agreement was signed, {{ending the}} Croat–Bosniak War, and {{providing}} Croatia with US military advisors from Military Professional Resources Incorporated (MPRI). The US involvement reflected a new military strategy endorsed by Bill Clinton in February 1993. Because the UN arms embargo {{was still in}} place, MPRI was hired ostensibly to prepare the HV {{for participation in the}} NATO Partnership for Peace programme. MPRI trained HV officers and personnel for 14 weeks from January to April 1995. It has also been speculated in several sources, including an article in The New York Times by Leslie Wayne and in various Serbian media reports, that MPRI may also have provided doctrinal advice, scenario planning and US government satellite intelligence to Croatia, although MPRI, American and Croatian officials <b>have</b> <b>denied</b> such claims. In November 1994, the United States unilaterally ended the arms embargo against Bosnia and Herzegovina, in effect allowing the HV to supply itself as arms shipments flowed through Croatia.|$|E

5|$|On January 12, 2011 Itzhak and Meir Abergil {{and three}} {{associates}} were extradited to the United States. In a 77-page 32-count indictment filed on July 13, 2008 at {{federal court in}} Los Angeles, the Abergil family {{is considered one of}} the most powerful crime families in Israel, deriving that power, in part, “because of its propensity for violence in Israel and around the world.” They were charged with murder, laundering millions of dollars obtained from embezzlement at Israel Trade Bank, extortion of business people, and operating an ecstasy-distribution network for millions of ecstasy pills. The Abergils and their three associates <b>have</b> <b>denied</b> all charges. According to Israeli police sources, their crime organization has continued to operate in Israel after their extradition.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} limited debate on {{the place of the}} Holocaust in Lithuanian {{national}} memory; historically Lithuanians <b>have</b> <b>denied</b> national participation in the Holocaust or labeled the Lithuanian participants in genocide as fringe extreme elements. The memories of that time and the discussion of those events in Jewish and Lithuanian historiographies are quite different, although Lithuanian historiography {{in the past two decades}} has improved, compared to the Soviet historiography, with the works of scholars such as Alfonsas Eidintas, Valentinas Brandišauskas and Arūnas Bubnys, among others, being positively reviewed by the Western and Jewish historians. The issue remains controversial to this day. According to Lithuanian historians, the contentious issues involve the role of the Lithuanian Activist Front, the Lithuanian Provisional Government and participation of Lithuanian civilians and volunteers in the Holocaust.|$|E
