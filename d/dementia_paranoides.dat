5000|$|The fourth {{edition of}} his textbook, Psychiatrie, {{published}} in 1893, two years after his arrival at Heidelberg, contained some impressions of the patterns Kraepelin had begun to find in his index cards. Prognosis (course and outcome) began to feature alongside signs and symptoms {{in the description of}} syndromes, and he added a class of psychotic disorders designated [...] "psychic degenerative processes", three of which were borrowed from Kahlbaum and Hecker: <b>dementia</b> <b>paranoides</b> (a degenerative type of Kahlbaum's paranoia, with sudden onset), catatonia (per Kahlbaum, 1874) and dementia praecox, (Hecker's hebephrenia of 1871). Kraepelin continued to equate dementia praecox with hebephrenia for the next six years.|$|E
5000|$|Drawing on his {{long-term}} research, {{and using}} the criteria of course, outcome and prognosis, he developed the concept of dementia praecox, which he defined as the [...] "sub-acute development of a peculiar simple condition of mental weakness occurring at a youthful age". When he first introduced this concept as a diagnostic entity in the fourth German edition of his Lehrbuch der Psychiatrie in 1893, it was placed among the degenerative disorders alongside, but separate from, catatonia and <b>dementia</b> <b>paranoides.</b> At that time, the concept corresponded by and large with Ewald Hecker's hebephrenia. In the sixth edition of the Lehrbuch in 1899 {{all three of these}} clinical types are treated as different expressions of one disease, dementia praecox.|$|E
50|$|The Oedipus complex, in narcissistic terms, {{represents}} that {{an individual}} can lose {{the ability to take}} a parental-substitute into his ego ideal without ambivalence. Once the individual has ambivalent relations with parental-substitutes, he will enter into the triangulating castration complex. In the castration complex the individual becomes rivalrous with parental-substitutes and this will be the point of regression. In Psycho-analytic notes on an autobiographical account of a case of paranoia (<b>Dementia</b> <b>paranoides)</b> (1911), Freud writes that “disappointment over a woman” (object drives) or “a mishap in social relations with other men” (ego drives) is the cause of regression or symptom formation. Triangulation can take place with a romantic rival, for a woman, or with a work rival, for the reputation of being more potent.|$|E
5000|$|In the March 1896 fifth {{edition of}} Psychiatrie, Kraepelin {{expressed}} confidence that his clinical method, involving analysis of both {{qualitative and quantitative}} data derived from long term observation of patients, would produce reliable diagnoses including prognosis: What convinced me of {{the superiority of the}} clinical method of diagnosis (followed here) over the traditional one, was the certainty with which we could predict (in conjunction with our new concept of disease) the future course of events. Thanks to it the student can now find his way more easily in the difficult subject of psychiatry. In this edition dementia praecox is still essentially hebephrenia, and it, <b>dementia</b> <b>paranoides</b> and catatonia are described as distinct psychotic disorders among the [...] "metabolic disorders leading to dementia".|$|E
50|$|The {{description}} of simple schizophrenia is inter-changeable with describing symptoms {{as a form}} of dementia praecox known as simple dementing, at least in the time when the swiss psychiatrists Otto Diem and Eugen Bleuler were studying it. In 1893, Emil Kraepelin considered there were four types of schizophrenia, and was amongst the first to identify three of them (dementia hebephrenica, <b>dementia</b> <b>paranoides,</b> dementia catatonica). The simplex type was added by Eugen Bleuler to the earlier ones identified by Kraepelin in 1899 and subsequently given a basic outline in 1903 by Otto Diem publishing a monograph on dementia praecox in the simple dementing form. This was based on a survey of two males having had a relatively normal childhood but who then fell into patterns of living tending towards vagrancy.|$|E
40|$|Daniel Paul Schreber (1842 - 1911) was {{a lawyer}} and judge, who wrote and {{published}} an account of his experiences in an asylum. This account was analysed by Freud, who believed that Schreber 2 ̆ 7 s <b>dementia</b> <b>paranoides</b> {{was the result of}} his anxiety about his latent desire for his father, and his delusions reflected this desire. Other analysts have concluded that Schreber 2 ̆ 7 s hallucinations were the result of his cruel treatment at the hands of his father. This thesis offers an alternative: Schreber 2 ̆ 7 s delusional beliefs were a positive mechanism that allowed him to resume a near-normal existence in spite of his debilitating hallucinations...|$|E
