Indeed, since the Coalition's formation in 1923, the major non-Labor party had only been able to govern alone once, during Joseph Lyons' first ministry—and even then, Lyons' United Australia Party had come up four seats short of a majority and needed confidence and supply support from the Country Party to govern.|$|R

40|$|In 2007, {{adults in}} Australia were interviewed about their {{willingness}} to comply with potential health interventions during a hypothetical infl uenza outbreak. After the fi rst wave of pandemic (H 1 N 1) 2009 in Australia, {{many of the same}} respondents were interviewed about behavior and protection measures they actually adopted. Of the original 1, 155 respondents, follow-up interviews were conducted for 830 (71. 9 %). Overall, 20. 4 % of respondents in 2009 had recently experienced infl uenza-like illness, 77. 7 % perceived pandemic (H 1 N 1) 2009 to be mild, and 77. 8 % reported low anxiety. Only 14. 5 % could correctly answer 4 questions about infl uenza virus transmission, symptoms, and infection control. Some reported increasing handwashing (46. 6 %) and covering coughs and sneezes (27. 8 %) to reduce transmission. Compared with intentions reported in 2007, stated compliance with quarantine or isolation measures in 2009 remained high. However, only respondents who perceived pandemic (H 1 N 1) 2009 as serious or who had attained higher educational levels expressed intention to comply with social distancing measures. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared a public health event of international importance on April 24, 2009, after recognition of a novel pandemic influenza virus strain, pH 1 N 1, now called pandemic (H 1 N 1) 2009 virus, which caused serious disease and deaths in Mexico and other parts of North America.

50|$|The 1860 Democratic National Convention met in Charleston, South Carolina {{and a large}} bloc of Southern delegates {{walked out}} when the {{platform}} was insufficiently pro-slavery.

The U.S. government under President James Buchanan refused to relinquish its forts that were in territory claimed by the Confederacy.

40|$|The Bologna <b>declaration</b> (1999) <b>triggered</b> {{a series}} of changes to reconfigure the {{educational}} models of the European higher education space by 2010. From 2006 Portugal witnessed a generalised reduction of the average duration of the study-cycles and the definition of general and specific skills for courses and students, resulting from the creation and adjustment of the higher education courses to the Bologna model. This essay reflects upon the importance of information literacy. This evolving and comprehensive concept may {{be described as the}} ability to know when and why information needs occur, where to find information, how to assess it, use it and transmit it ethically using technological skills. This definition integrates the interdisciplinary area of Information Sciences which also comprehends informational behavior. Training of information literacy skills in higher education stands out as an advantage that will allow students to improve their skills and achieve full information literacy. We defend the need for a desired interaction between the multiple education agents enhancing the trilogy composed by students, librarians and teachers. The first should be regarded as active protagonists of their learning process and provided with information literacy competences – a key factor of success. The Librarian, having acquired new competencies, namely technologic, should act as a facilitator in the process literacy training - preferably integrated within a pedagogic and curricular project that articulates its educational action with both students and teachers. Supporting the educational extension of the Libraries and allying them to the inevitable use of the new information and communication technologies we should like to point out the role of the Digital Libraries. These can efficiently respond to the requirements of the users by comfortably, rapidly and inexpensively providing access to quality information, by customising on-line services, by allowing socialisation and interaction through collaborative edition tools of the web 2. 0...|$|R
5000|$|Case E-16/11 Icesave {{is widely}} {{considered}} to be the landmark case of the EFTA Court case, mainly due to its relation to the 2008 Icelandic financial crisis and Directive 94/19/EC on deposit-guarantee schemes, which had also been transposed into EEA law. This directive obliged EU and EEA EFTA states to create deposit-guarantee schemes. Deposit-guarantee schemes reimburse a limited amount of deposits to depositors where their bank has failed, as a way to protect a part of depositors’ wealth from bank failures. In Icesave, the EFTA Court dealt with an action by the EFTA Surveillance Authority against Iceland. The Authority claimed that Iceland had violated the transposed Directive and thus EEA law in the aftermath of its major economic crisis and the collapse of the Icelandic banking sector in 2008, by failing to ensure that British and Dutch depositors using the ‘Icesave’ accounts offered by Icelandic banks received the minimum amount of compensation set out in Article 7(1) of the Directive. The Court noted that the nature of the result to be achieved fell to be determined by the substantive provisions of the particular directive. Moreover, it noted {{that as a result of}} the economic crisis, the regulatory framework of the financial system had been subject to revision and amendment in order to enhance financial stability. But the Court held that the Directive did not envisage the alleged obligation of result to ensure payment to depositors in the Dutch and British branches of Icelandic banks in a systemic crisis of the magnitude experienced in Iceland or how to proceed in a case where the guarantee scheme was unable to cope with its payment obligations remained largely unanswered by the Directive, with its Article 7(6) being the only operative provision that deals with non-payment. Still, the relevant question in Icesave was whether the EEA States are legally responsible under the Directive in an event of such magnitude. The Court held that the principle of non-discrimination requires that there to be no difference in treatment of depositors by the guarantee scheme itself and the way in which it uses its funds. Discrimination under the Directive is prohibited but the transfer of domestic deposits from some entities to new ones was made before the Icelandic Financial Supervisory Authority, Fjármálaeftirlitið, rendered its <b>declaration</b> that <b>triggered</b> the application of the Directive. Thus, depositor protection under the Directive never applied to depositors in Icelandic branches of the affected banks. Accordingly, the transfer of domestic deposits did not fall within the scope of the non-discrimination principle as stipulated by the Directive and could not lead to an infringement of the aforementioned provisions of the Directive read in light of Article 4 EEA.|$|R
