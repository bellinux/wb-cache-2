5|$|After World War II the United States and the Soviet Union jockeyed {{for power}} during {{what became known}} as the Cold War, driven by an ideological <b>divide</b> <b>between</b> {{capitalism}} and communism and, according to the school of geopolitics, a <b>divide</b> <b>between</b> the maritime Atlantic and the continental Eurasian camps. They dominated the military affairs of Europe, with the U.S. and its NATO allies on one side and the USSR and its Warsaw Pact allies on the other. The U.S. developed a policy of containment towards the expansion of communist influence. While the U.S. and Soviet Union engaged in proxy wars and developed powerful nuclear arsenals, the two countries avoided direct military conflict.|$|E
5|$|The {{watershed}} of Briar Creek {{is located}} in the ridge and valley physiographic region. The top of Lee Mountain forms a drainage <b>divide</b> <b>between</b> the creek's watershed and another watershed. Several points along Briar Creek and its tributaries have erode with ease or moderate ease. The infiltration capacity of these points is mostly moderate to high.|$|E
5|$|Further north {{along the}} Continental Divide, a short portion of the {{combined}} Continental and Laurentian divides separate the Columbia watershed from the MacKenzie-Slave-Athabasca watershed, which empties into the Arctic Ocean. The Nelson and Mackenzie watersheds are separated by a <b>divide</b> <b>between</b> streams flowing to the Arctic Ocean {{and those of the}} Hudson Bay watershed. This divide meets the Continental Divide at Snow Dome (also known as Dome), near the northernmost bend of the Columbia River.|$|E

5|$|Reading Peak {{formed a}} second center from which ice moved north into Hat Creek and Summit Creek. Ice moving southward united {{with some of}} the above glaciers and emptied into Warner Valley. On the central plateau, the ridge {{connecting}} Hat Mountain with Crater Butte served as a <b>divide</b> <b>between</b> ice flowing northward to Badger Flat and Hat Creek and that moving southward to Corral Meadows, Kings Creek and Warner Valley. Ice from Mt. Harkness and Sifford Mountain also wound up in Warner Valley.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after their}} election, the <b>divide</b> <b>between</b> Chandler and Laffoon widened {{over the issue}} of {{implementing}} a state sales tax. Laffoon favored the tax; Chandler opposed it. As presiding officer of the state senate, Chandler worked with Speaker of the House John Y. Brown, Sr. to block passage of the tax. In retaliation, Laffoon's allies in the General Assembly stripped Chandler of some of his statutory power as lieutenant governor, after which they were able to pass the tax by a single vote in each house of the legislature.|$|E
5|$|Since {{at least}} the 1870s, American religious, medical, legislative, and legal {{commentators}} have debated contraception laws. Ana Garner and Angela Michel have found that in these discussions men often attach reproductive rights to moral and political matters, {{as part of an}} ongoing attempt to regulate human bodies. In press coverage between 1873–2013 they found a <b>divide</b> <b>between</b> institutional ideology and real-life experiences of women.|$|E

50|$|Ravano made no {{provision}} for his principality {{in light of his}} death and it was left to the Venetian bailiff to divide Euboea into sixths in 1217. The northern third, with capital at Oreoi, was <b>divided</b> <b>between</b> Ravano's nephews, Merino I and Rizzardo; the central third, with the island's capital, Chalkis, was <b>divided</b> <b>between</b> his widow, Isabella, and his daughter, Bertha; and the southern third, with capital at Karystos, was <b>divided</b> <b>between</b> Giberto's heirs, Guglielmo I and Alberto.|$|R

The Fargo LATA extends for some distance into northern Minnesota, as far east as Brainerd.|$|R
5|$|The castle's deer park, which {{merged into}} the larger Rising Chase, was {{positioned}} behind the castle {{in a similar way}} to that at Devizes Castle. The castle effectively formed an interface between the town and the park; the great hall in the keep faced the settlement, and the lord's chamber overlooked the park, creating a symbolic <b>divide</b> <b>between</b> the public and private aspects of the building.|$|E
5|$|The <b>divide</b> <b>between</b> the Dutch-speaking north (Flanders) and the French-speaking South (Wallonia) {{has caused}} the {{parliamentary}} democracy to become ethnically polarized. Though {{an equal number of}} seats in the Chamber of Representatives are prescribed to the Flemish and Walloons, Belgian political parties have all divided into two ideologically identical but linguistically and ethnically different parties. The political crisis has grown so bad in recent years that the partition of Belgium has been feared.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{prominent}} {{position in}} the party, Harper's relationship with the Reform Party leadership was frequently strained. In early 1994, he criticized a party decision to establish a personal expense account for Manning {{at a time when}} other Reform MPs had been asked to forego parliamentary perquisites. He was formally rebuked by the Reform executive council despite winning support from some MPs. His relationship with Manning grew increasingly fractious in the mid-1990s, and he pointedly declined to express any opinion on Manning's leadership during a 1996 interview. This friction was indicative of a fundamental <b>divide</b> <b>between</b> the two men: Harper was strongly committed to conservative principles and opposed Manning's inclinations toward populism, which Harper saw as leading to compromise on core ideological matters.|$|E

5|$|Hatfield {{joined the}} U.S. Navy after graduation, {{taking part in}} the World War II battles at Iwo Jima and Okinawa as a landing craft officer where he {{witnessed}} the carnage of the war. A lieutenant, he also witnessed the effects of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, {{as one of the first}} Americans to see the ruins of the city (later, as Senator, Hatfield opposed arms proliferation and the Vietnam War). After Japan, he served in French Indochina, where he witnessed firsthand the wealth <b>divide</b> <b>between</b> the peasant Vietnamese and the colonial French bourgeoisie. After his discharge, he spent one year at Willamette’s law school, but decided politics or teaching better suited him.|$|E
5|$|In 1884, McCreary {{was elected}} to the first of six {{consecutive}} terms in the U.S. House of Representatives. As a legislator, he was an advocate of free silver and a champion of the state's agricultural interests. After two failed bids for election to the Senate, McCreary secured the support of Governor J. C. W. Beckham, and in 1902, the General Assembly elected him to the Senate. He served one largely undistinguished term, and Beckham successfully challenged him for his Senate seat in 1908. The <b>divide</b> <b>between</b> McCreary and Beckham was short-lived, however, and Beckham supported McCreary's election to a second term as governor in 1911.|$|E
5|$|In the 18th century Royal Navy, {{rank and}} {{position}} on board ship {{was defined by}} a mix of two hierarchies, an official hierarchy of ranks and a conventionally recognized social <b>divide</b> <b>between</b> gentlemen and non-gentlemen. Boys aspiring for a commission were often called young gentlemen instead of their substantive rating to distinguish their higher social standing from the ordinary sailors. Generally, aboard most warships common seamen berthed in the fo'c'sle, while officers were quartered at the stern. Occasionally, a midshipman would be posted aboard a ship in a lower rating such as able seaman but would eat and sleep with his social equals in the cockpit.|$|E

5|$|NATO {{has added}} new members seven times since its {{founding}} in 1949 to include twenty-nine members. Twelve countries were part of the founding of NATO: Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The early years of the Cold War saw a stark <b>divide</b> <b>between</b> Capitalist ideologies, backed by NATO, and Communist satellite states of the Soviet Union. This divide encouraged the anti-Communist governments of Greece and Turkey to join NATO in 1952. Greece would suspend its membership in 1974, over the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, but rejoined in 1980 with Turkey's cooperation.|$|E
5|$|Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is {{the eighth}} studio album by English rock band the Beatles. Released on 26 May 1967 in the United Kingdom and 2 June 1967 in the United States, {{it was an}} {{immediate}} commercial and critical success, spending 27 weeks {{at the top of}} the UK albums chart and 15 weeks at number one in the US. On release, the album was lauded by the vast majority of critics for its innovations in music production, songwriting and graphic design, for bridging a cultural <b>divide</b> <b>between</b> popular music and legitimate art, and for providing a musical representation of its generation and the contemporary counterculture. It won four Grammy Awards in 1968, including Album of the Year, the first rock LP to receive this honour.|$|E
5|$|The Kirk {{that had}} been {{established}} at the Reformation, had been largely united since the Declaration of the Covenant in 1638. In the period after the defeat at Dunbar, it became divided, partly {{in the search for}} scapegoats for defeat. Different factions and tendencies produced rival resolutions and protests, which gave their names to the two major parties as Resolutioners, who were willing to make an accommodation with royalism, and more hard line Protesters who wished to purge the Kirk of such associations. Subsequently, the <b>divide</b> <b>between</b> rival camps became almost irrevocable. After 1655 both groups appointed permanent agents in London.|$|E

5|$|The entire Slavonia {{belongs to}} the Danube basin and the Black Sea {{catchment}} area, but it is divided in two sub-basins. One of those drains into the Sava—itself a Danube tributary—and the other into the Drava or directly into the Danube. The drainage <b>divide</b> <b>between</b> the two sub-basins runs along Papuk and Krndija mountains, in effect tracing the southern boundary of the Virovitica-Podravina County and the northern boundary of Požega-Slavonia County, cuts through the Osijek-Podravina County north of Đakovo and finally bisects the Vukovar-Syrmia County running between Vukovar and Vinkovci to reach Fruška Gora southwest of Ilok. The Entire Brod-Posavina County {{is located in the}} Sava sub-basin.|$|E
5|$|The second theme Garner {{identified}} was the <b>divide</b> <b>between</b> {{ideal and}} nonideal theory, which he understands {{as a way}} political theory {{may be used to}} contextualise animal ethics and further the debate. Ultimately, for Garner, Cochrane's theory serves as a challenge to abolitionism, which, Garner fears, both polarises the debate and is unrealistic. The themes of this review were built upon in Garner's 2013 book A Theory of Justice for Animals. In the course of his review of the book, Garner looked forward to the release of Cochrane's second book, Animal Rights Without Liberation, which offers a lengthier defence of the interest-based rights theory.|$|E
5|$|Warfare on the North American {{frontier}} was brutal, and {{the killing}} of prisoners, the targeting of civilians, and other atrocities were widespread. The ruthlessness and treachery of the conflict was {{a reflection of a}} growing <b>divide</b> <b>between</b> the separate populations of the British colonists and Native Americans. Contrary to popular belief, the British government did not issue the Royal Proclamation of 1763 in reaction to Pontiac's War, though the conflict did provide an impetus for the application of the Proclamation's Indian clauses. This proved unpopular with British colonists, and may {{have been one of the}} early contributing factors to the American Revolution.|$|E
