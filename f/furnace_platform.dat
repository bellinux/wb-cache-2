40|$|Integrated micro-CHP (Cooling, Heating and Power) system {{solutions}} represent {{an opportunity to}} address all of the following requirements at once: conservation of scarce energy resources, moderation of pollutant release into our environment, and assured comfort for home-owners. The objective of this effort was to establish strategies for development, demonstration, and sustainable commercialization of cost-effective integrated CHP systems for residential applications. A unified approach to market and opportunity identification, technology assessment, specific system designs, adaptation to modular product platform component conceptual designs was employed. UTRC's recommendation to U. S. Department of Energy is {{to go ahead with}} the execution of the proposed product development and commercialization strategy plan under Phase II of this effort. Recent indicators show the emergence of micro-CHP. More than 12, 000 micro-CHP systems have been sold worldwide so far, around 7, 500 in 2004. Market projections predict a world-wide market growth over 35 % per year. In 2004 the installations were mainly in Europe (73. 5 %) and in Japan (26. 4 %). The market in North-America is almost non-existent (0. 1 %). High energy consumption, high energy expenditure, large spark-spread (i. e., difference between electricity and fuel costs), big square footage, and high income are the key conditions for market acceptance. Today, these conditions are best found in the states of New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, New England states. A multiple stage development plan is proposed to address risk mitigation. These stages include concept development and supplier engagement, component development, system integration, system demonstration, and field trials. A two stage commercialization strategy is suggested based on two product versions. The first version [...] a heat and power system named Micro-Cogen, provides the heat and essential electrical power to the homeowner. In its proposed embodiment, the system has a 2 kW prime mover integrated to a <b>furnace</b> <b>platform.</b> The second version is a Micro-Trigen system with heating, cooling and power. It has the same Micro-Cogen platform integrated with a 14 kW thermally activated chiller. A Stirling engine is suggested as a promising path for the prime mover. A LiBr absorption chiller is today's best technology in term of readiness level. Paybacks are acceptable for the Micro-Cogen version. However, there is no clear economically viable path for a Micro-Trigen version with today's available technology. This illustrates the importance of financial incentives to home owners in the initial stage of micro-CHP commercialization. It will help create the necessary conditions of volume demand to start transitioning to mass-production and cost reduction. Incentives to the manufacturers will help improve efficiency, enhance reliability, and lower cost, making micro-CHP products more attractive. Successful development of a micro-CHP system for residential applications has the potential to provide significant benefits to users, customers, manufacturers, and suppliers of such systems and, in general, to the nation as a whole. The benefits to the ultimate user are a comfortable and healthy home environment at an affordable cost, potential utility savings, and a reliable supply of energy. Manufacturers, component suppliers, and system integrators will see growth of a new market segment for integrated energy products. The benefits to the nation include significantly increased energy efficiency, reduced consumption of fossil fuels, pollutant and CO{sub 2 } emissions from power generation, enhanced security from power interruptions as well as enhanced economic activity and job creation. An integrated micro-CHP energy system provides advantages over conventional power generation, since the energy is used more efficiently by means of efficient heat recovery. Foreign companies are readily selling products, mostly in Europe, and it is urgent to react promptly to these offerings that will soon emerge on the U. S. market as well. For all these reasons, UTC urges the U. S. Department of Energy to fund the Phase II Development Program in the nation's interest. The objective of this study of micro-CHP systems was to establish strategies for development, demonstration, and sustainable commercialization of cost-effective integrated Cooling, Heating and Power (CHP) systems for residential applications. Successful commercialization will ultimately involve component suppliers both for the micro-CHP system, and for the building electric power, heating, cooling, ventilation, and hot water supply systems. All of these components must be compatible and integrated as a system with their safe and reliable operation coordinated by an overall supervisory control system...|$|E

40|$|This {{method for}} {{determining}} aluminum in serum and urine is essentially free from matrix interference {{and gives a}} linear response with concentration to at least 500 zg/L. Use of a stabilized temperature platform (L’vov platform, Perkin-Elmer Corp.) to approach a “steady-state ” tem-perature, addition of matrix modifiers [especially Mg(N 03) 2], {{and the use of}} peak area integration all helped substantially diminish spectral interference. With the <b>platform</b> <b>furnace,</b> serum protein concentrations as great as 260 gIL did not interfere with the determination of Al. The within- and between-assay precision (CV) was 3. 5 % and 7. 4 %, respectively. Analytical recovery of Al added to serum ranged between 95 and 101 % throughout the linear calibration range (to 500 g/L), either when mea-sured directly from the standard curve or by the metho...|$|R

40|$|Graphite filter atomizers (GFA) for {{electrothermal}} {{atomic absorption}} spectrometry (ETAAS) show substantial advantages over commonly employed electrothermal vaporizers and atomizers, tube and <b>platform</b> <b>furnaces,</b> for direct determination of high and medium volatility elements in matrices associated with strong spectral and chemical interferences. Two factors provide lower limits of detection and shorter determination cycles with the GFA: the vaporization area in the GFA is separated from the absorption volume by a porous graphite partition; the sample is distributed over a large surface of a collector in the vaporization area. These factors convert the GFA into an efficient chemical reactor. The research concerning the GFA concept, technique and analytical methodology, carried out mainly in the author's laboratory in Russia and South Africa, is reviewed. Examples of analytical applications of the GFA in AAS for analysis of organic liquids and slurries, bio-samples and food products are given. Future prospects for the GFA are discussed in connection with analyses by fast multi-element AAS...|$|R
50|$|The {{graphite}} {{tubes are}} heated via their ohmic resistance using a low-voltage high-current power supply; {{the temperature in}} the individual stages can be controlled very closely, and temperature ramps between the individual stages facilitate separation of sample components. Tubes may be heated transversely or longitudinally, where the former ones have the advantage of a more homogeneous temperature distribution over their length. The so-called stabilized temperature <b>platform</b> <b>furnace</b> (STPF) concept, proposed by Walter Slavin, based on research of Boris L’vov, makes ET AAS essentially free from interference. The major components of this concept are atomization of the sample from a graphite platform inserted into the graphite tube (L’vov platform) instead of from the tube wall in order to delay atomization until the gas phase in the atomizer has reached a stable temperature; use of a chemical modifier in order to stabilize the analyte to a pyrolysis temperature that is sufficient to remove the majority of the matrix components; and integration of the absorbance over the time of the transient absorption signal instead of using peak height absorbance for quantification.|$|R
40|$|The Graphite furnace atomic {{absorption}} spectrometry (GF AAS) was the technique chosen by the inorganic contamination laboratory (INCQ/ FIOCRUZ) to be validated and applied in routine analysis for arsenic detection and quantification. The selectivity, linearity, sensibility, detection, and quantification limits besides accuracy and precision parameters were studied and optimized under Stabilized Temperature <b>Platform</b> <b>Furnace</b> (STPF) conditions. The limit of detection obtained was 0. 13 µg. L- 1 and the limit of quantification was 1. 04 µg. L- 1, with an average precision, for total arsenic, less than 15 % and an accuracy of 96 %. To quantify the chemical species As(III) and As(V), an ion-exchange resin (Dowex 1 X 8, Cl- form) was used and the physical-chemical parameters were optimized resulting in a recuperation of 98 % of As(III) and of 90 % of As(V). The method was applied to groundwater, mineral water, and hemodialysis purified water samples. All results obtained were lower than the maximum limit values established by the legal Brazilian regulations, in effect, 50, 10, and 5 µg. L- 1 para As total, As(III) e As(V), respectively.

A {{method has}} been {{developed}} for the determination of lead in wine by electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry without any sample preparation and calibration against aqueous standards, using 7. 5 g Pd as a chemical modifier. The results obtained for seven wines using the proposed method and an acid digestion procedure did not show any significant difference using a Student’s t-test. Atomization in a transversally heated filter atomizer (THFA) was compared with atomization in a conventional transversally heated <b>platform</b> <b>furnace.</b> The former provided a 2. 6 -fold higher sensitivity, improving the characteristic mass from 34 to 12 pg and a 1. 6 -fold better limit of detection (0. 3 gL− 1 compared to 0. 5 gL− 1) for aqueous solutions using the same injection volume of 20 L. However, the average precision, expressed as the relative standard deviation for the determination of lead in wine under routine conditions was improved from 4. 6 % with platform atomization to 0. 6 % in the THFA. The lead content found in seven arbitrarily chosen white and red wines, five from Brazil, one from Chile and one from Spain, ranged from 6 to 60 gL− 1 Pb with an average content of 11. 4 gL− 1 Pb for the wines from South America...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWorkplace health {{promotion}} {{is a business}} management system that aims to promote and improve the health situations of all employees in a comprehensive and sustainable mode, and {{should be seen as}} an equal partner for occupational health and safety. Certain industrial hazards (in particular chemical agents) display oxidant capacity in the human body acting via oxidative stress, caused by a cellular excess of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. Species like superoxide and hydrogen peroxide are involved in protein kinase regulation, while nitric oxide and peroxynitrite inactivate phosphatases as well as activating kinases, which are key agents for translating signals of cell needs into metabolic change through enzyme action, gene transcription, protein synthesis, and biochemical flux. These reactions are permanently balanced by the redox system, a nonequilibrium thermodynamic state as a basic part of aerobic life, determined by relative and constantly changing amounts of oxidative and antioxidative (reductive) agents. Review {{of a large number of}} studies shows that external sources of antioxidants, mainly fruits and vegetables, are a real benefit for human defense mechanisms, considering now that sufficient scientific evidence exists for public health policy to promote a plant-rich diet. In our investigation, we focused on anthocyanins, as highly potent phytochemical antioxidants expected to protect us from oxidative injury. Furthermore, these specific antioxidants were found to act against lipoperoxidation and oxidative stress induced by industrial chemicals like carbon tetrachloride, paraquat or heavy metals. Anthocyanin extracts of Vaccinium Myrtillus (bilberry) improve night vision and eye strain caused by excessive computer use. Because of the antioxidant skin protection against UVB radiation, these phytochemicals can be used (both local and oral administration) by workers from oil-bearing <b>platforms,</b> <b>furnaces</b> or agriculture. We think that such important findings may be used for workplace {{health promotion}} projects in chemical industry, in order to prevent occupational diseases or work-related diseases. The individual approach of workplace health promotion focuses on the health-related behaviors of employees, and is called risk factor reduction (educational approach). We focused our initiative on using dietary natural antioxidants by running health campaigns, and raising awareness of the harmful effects of chemical agents and xenobiotics, addressed both to employees and managers. We propose a one year project sustaining behavior change mainly through educational and informative sessions, based on assessment of workers’ needs and also on developing healthy lifestyles. We also want to encourage company managers to offer antioxidant supplements/fresh fruits/berries juices to those employees who are working in harmful conditions, considering a daily estimated intake of 200 mg anthocyanins. Health promotion on consuming anthocyanins-rich fruits and vegetables may contribute in reducing age-related neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, age-related metabolic diseases (especially cardiovascular diseases), and not at least, cancer. Designing potent antioxidant phytococktails and standardised mixtures of anthocyanins for human consumption will be a great challenge on essentially inter-disciplinary research topic involving interaction of nutritionists, physicians, chemists, pharmacists and others...|$|R
