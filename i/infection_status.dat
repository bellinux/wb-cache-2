2500|$|Chronic {{hepatitis}} C is a {{major cause}} of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. It is a common medical reason for liver transplantation due to its severe complications. It is estimated that 130–180 million people in the world are affected by this disease representing a little more than 3% of the world population. In the developing regions of Africa, Asia and South America, prevalence can be as high as 10% of the population. In Egypt, rates of hepatitis C infection as high as 20% [...] have been documented and are associated with iatrogenic contamination related to schistosomiasis treatment in the 1950s–1980s. Currently in the United States, approximately 3.5 million adults are estimated to be infected. Hepatitis C is particularly prevalent among people born between 1945–1965, a group of about 800,000 people, with prevalence as high as 3.2% versus 1.6% in the general U.S. population. Most chronic carriers of hepatitis C are unaware of their <b>infection</b> <b>status.</b> The most common mode of transmission of hepatitis C virus is exposure to blood products via blood transfusions (prior to 1992) and intravenous drug injection. A history of intravenous drug injection is the most important risk factor for chronic hepatitis C.

40|$|We {{formulate}} {{and analyze}} a hypothesis testing problem for inferring the edge structure of an infection graph. Our model is as follows: A disease spreads over a network via contagion and random infection, where uninfected nodes contract the disease {{at a time}} corresponding to an independent exponential random variable and infected nodes transmit the disease to uninfected neighbors according to independent exponential random variables with an unknown rate parameter. A subset of nodes is also censored, meaning the <b>infection</b> <b>statuses</b> of the nodes are unobserved. Given the statuses of all nodes in the network, {{the goal is to}} determine the underlying graph. Our procedure consists of a permutation test, and we derive a condition in terms of automorphism groups of the graphs corresponding to the null and alternative hypotheses that ensures the validity of our test. Notably, the permutation test does not involve estimating unknown parameters governing the infection process; instead, it leverages differences in the topologies of the null and alternative graphs. We derive risk bounds for our testing procedure in settings of interest; provide extensions to situations involving relaxed versions of the algebraic condition; and discuss multiple observations of infection spreads. We conclude with experiments validating our results. Comment: 28 pages, 5 figures, 1 tabl...|$|R

In this setting, ICUs require an increasing input from neurologists,especially {{with regard to}} the assessment of hypoxic brain damage and the neurological com-plications of organ failure, critical illness, and sepsis. In contrast, dedicated neurological intensive care units (NICUs) tend to deal largely with a different population of patients. Such units are pri-marily concerned with the management of primary encephalopathic patients, the control of raised intracranial pressure (ICP), the management of ventilatory, autonomic, and bulbar insufficiency, and the consequences of profound neuromuscular weakness.

Epidemiological features of inter-herd transmission of C. burnetii in cattle herds by wind and trade of cows are poorly understood. We present a novel dynamic spatial model describing the inter-herd regional spread of C. burnetii in dairy cattle herds, quantifying {{the ability of}} airborne transmission and animal trade in C. burnetii propagation in an enzootic region. Among all the new herd infections, 92 % were attributed to airborne transmission and the rest to cattle trade. Infections acquired following airborne transmission were shown to cause relatively small and ephemeral intra-herd outbreaks. On the contrary, disease-free herds purchasing an infectious cow experienced significantly higher intra-herd prevalence. The results also indicated that, for short duration, both transmission routes were independent from each other without any synergistic effect. The model outputs applied to the Finistère department in western France showed satisfactory sensitivity (0. 71) and specificity (0. 80) in predicting herd <b>infection</b> <b>statuses</b> {{at the end of}} one year in a neighbourhood of 3  km around expected incident herds, when compared with data.

40|$|Background. Epidemiological {{studies have}} {{suggested}} a link between chronic Helicobacter pylori infection and ischemic heart disease but the underlying mechanism remains elusive. We hypothesized that H. pylori-associated chronic gastritis causes impairment of absorption of vitamin cofactors that are essential in the metabolism of homocysteine and results in hyperhomocysteinemia. Materials and Methods. Forty-nine dyspeptic patients were studied. H. pylori infection was defined by rapid urease test and histology. Fasting serum homocysteine level, which was measured by a validated commercial fluorescence polarization immunoassay, was correlated with H. pylori <b>infection</b> <b>statuses</b> and gastric histology. H. pylori-infected patients were followed up for 24 weeks post eradication for changes in serum homocysteine concentration. Results. Univariate analyses showed that serum homocysteine level correlated with increasing age (p <. 001), male sex (p =. 003) and smoking habit (p =. 025). There {{was no significant difference}} in serum homocysteine levels between H. pylori infected and uninfected subjects (median 10. 5 vs. 10. 2 μmol/l). After successful eradication of the bacterium, there was no significant reduction in homocysteine level. Moreover, there was no correlation between homocysteine level and gastric histology including H. pylori density, activity and inflammation scores, presence of atrophy or intestinal metaplasia. Conclusions. The postulated link between H. pylori infection and ischemic heart disease, if it actually exists, is unlikely to be mediated through hyperhomocysteinemia. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

The intensity of infections, eosinophilia, allergy risk factors, <b>infections</b> <b>status</b> and anti-Der p 1 IgE levels before and 2  years (population 1) and 3  years (population 2) after anthelmintic treatment, were evaluated. It was observed that the population with lower prevalence and intensity of infection (population 2) had lower eosinophils counts (> 600 /mm 3) and higher animal contact than the population with higher parasites intensity (population 1). After anthelmintic treatment the intensity of S. mansoni single infection decreased, but no changes were observed in Hookworm and co-infected individuals. The anthelmintic treatment also enhanced anti-Der p 1 IgE optical density in ELISA on the subgroups that became negative for helminth infection regardless of their previous infection condition in population 1.

40|$|Emerging {{evidence}} shows that the human microbiota plays {{a larger role in}} disease progression and health than previously anticipated. Helicobacter pylori, the causative agent of gastric cancer and duodenal and gastric ulcers, was early associated with gastric disease, but it has also been proposed that the accompanying microbiota in Helicobacter pylori-infected individuals might affect disease progression and gastric cancer development. In this study, the composition of the transcriptionally active microbial community and H. pylori gene expression were determined using metatranscriptomic RNA sequencing of stomach biopsy specimens from individuals with different H. pylori <b>infection</b> <b>statuses</b> and premalignant tissue changes. The results show that H. pylori completely dominates the microbiota not only in infected individuals but also in most individuals classified as H. pylori uninfected using conventional methods. Furthermore, H. pylori abundance is positively correlated with the presence of Campylobacter, Deinococcus, and Sulfurospirillum. Finally, we quantified the expression {{of a large number of}} Helicobacter pylori genes and found high expression of genes involved in pH regulation and nickel transport. Our study is the first to dissect the viable microbiota of the human stomach by metatranscriptomic analysis, and it shows that metatranscriptomic analysis of the gastric microbiota is feasible and can provide new insights into how bacteria respond in vivo to variations in the stomach microenvironment and at different stages of disease progression...|$|R
