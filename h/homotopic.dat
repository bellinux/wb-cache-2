5|$|More generally, the i-th {{homotopy}} group, πi(X) {{begins with}} the pointed i-sphere (S'i,s), and otherwise follows the same procedure. The null <b>homotopic</b> class acts as {{the identity of the}} group addition, and for X equal to S'n (for positive n) — the homotopy groups of spheres — the groups are abelian and finitely generated. If for some i all maps are null <b>homotopic,</b> then the group πi consists of one element, and is called the trivial group.|$|E

25|$|No CTC can be {{continuously}} deformed as a CTC {{to a point}} (that is, a CTC and a point are not timelike <b>homotopic),</b> as the manifold {{would not}} be causally well behaved at that point.

25|$|Next, any map on the Möbius {{group is}} <b>homotopic</b> to the {{identity}}. The Lefschetz–Hopf theorem {{states that the}} sum of the indices (in this context, multiplicity) of the fixed points of a map with finitely many fixed points equals the Lefschetz number of the map, which in this case is the trace of the identity map on homology groups, which is simply the Euler characteristic.|$|E
25|$|Immersed plane curves have a {{well-defined}} turning number, {{which can be}} defined as the total curvature divided by 2π. This is invariant under regular homotopy, by the Whitney–Graustein theorem – topologically, it is the degree of the Gauss map, or equivalently the winding number of the unit tangent (which does not vanish) about the origin. Further, this is a complete set of invariants – any two plane curves with the same turning number are regular <b>homotopic.</b>|$|E
25|$|The above {{example of}} a curve winding around a point has a simple topological interpretation. The {{complement}} of {{a point in the}} plane is homotopy equivalent to the circle, such that maps from the circle to itself are really all that need to be considered. It can be shown that each such map can be continuously deformed to (is <b>homotopic</b> to) one of the standard maps , where multiplication in the circle is defined by identifying it with the complex unit circle. The set of homotopy classes of maps from a circle to a topological space form a group, which is called the first homotopy group or fundamental group of that space. The fundamental group of the circle is the group of the integers, Z; and the winding number of a complex curve is just its homotopy class.|$|E
25|$|Algebraic stacks can {{be further}} {{generalized}} and for many practical questions like deformation theory and intersection theory, this is often the most natural approach. One can extend the Grothendieck site of affine schemes to a higher categorical site of derived affine schemes, by replacing the commutative rings with an infinity category of differential graded commutative algebras, or of simplicial commutative rings or a similar category with an appropriate variant of a Grothendieck topology. One can also replace presheaves of sets by presheaves of simplicial sets (or of infinity groupoids). Then, in presence of an appropriate <b>homotopic</b> machinery one can develop a notion of derived stack as such a presheaf on the infinity category of derived affine schemes, which is satisfying certain infinite categorical version of a sheaf axiom (and to be algebraic, inductively a sequence of representability conditions). Quillen model categories, Segal categories and quasicategories {{are some of the}} most often used tools to formalize this yielding the derived algebraic geometry, introduced by the school of Carlos Simpson, including Andre Hirschowitz, Bertrand Toën, Gabrielle Vezzosi, Michel Vaquié and others; and developed further by Jacob Lurie, Bertrand Toën, and Gabrielle Vezzosi. Another (noncommutative) version of derived algebraic geometry, using A-infinity categories has been developed from early 1990s by Maxim Kontsevich and followers.|$|E
500|$|The first {{homotopy}} group, or fundamental group, π1(X) of a (path connected) {{topological space}} X thus begins with continuous maps from a pointed circle (S1,s) to the pointed space (X,x), where maps from one pair to another map s into x. These maps (or equivalently, closed curves) are grouped together into equivalence classes based on homotopy (keeping the [...] "base point" [...] x fixed), so that two maps {{are in the}} same class if they are <b>homotopic.</b> Just as one point is distinguished, so one class is distinguished: all maps (or curves) <b>homotopic</b> to the constant map S1↦x are called null <b>homotopic.</b> The classes become an abstract algebraic group with the introduction of addition, defined via an [...] "equator pinch". This pinch maps the equator of a pointed sphere (here a circle) to the distinguished point, producing a [...] "bouquet of spheres" [...] — two pointed spheres joined at their distinguished point. The two maps to be added map the upper and lower spheres separately, agreeing on the distinguished point, and composition with the pinch gives the sum map.|$|E
500|$|The {{distinguishing}} feature of a topological space is its continuity structure, formalized {{in terms of}} open sets or neighborhoods. A continuous map is a function between spaces that preserves continuity. A homotopy is a continuous path between continuous maps; two maps connected by a homotopy {{are said to be}} <b>homotopic.</b> The idea common to all these concepts is to discard variations that do not affect outcomes of interest. An important practical example is the residue theorem of complex analysis, where [...] "closed curves" [...] are continuous maps from the circle into the complex plane, and where two closed curves produce the same integral result if they are <b>homotopic</b> in the topological space consisting of the plane minus the points of singularity.|$|E
500|$|In 1938 Lev Pontryagin {{established}} an isomorphism between the homotopy group πn+k(S'n) {{and the group}} Ωkframed(S'n+k) of cobordism classes of differentiable k-submanifolds of S'n+k [...] which are `framed', i.e. have a trivialized normal bundle. [...] Every map fnof&:S'n+k → S'n is <b>homotopic</b> to a differentiable map with [...] a framed k-dimensional submanifold.

Until the advent of more sophisticated algebraic methods in the early 1950s (Serre) the Pontrjagin isomorphism was the main tool for computing the homotopy groups of spheres. In 1954 the Pontrjagin isomorphism was generalized by René Thom to an isomorphism expressing other groups of cobordism classes (e.g. of all manifolds) as homotopy groups of spaces and spectra. In more recent work the argument is usually reversed, with cobordism groups computed in terms of homotopy groups [...]|$|E
