We use the Bolivian 2003 - 2004 income and expenditure survey to estimate nonparametric and parametric elasticities of calorie consumption and price per calorie with respect to total expenditure. Our estimates control for potential correlated measurement error problems in both, the dependent and independent variables. We find significant non-linearities in both relationships. Poor people, whose income {{is not enough to}} buy sufficient food, have a much higher elasticity of calorie consumption and a lower elasticity of price per calorie than their counter parts whose income is enough to eat. Consistent mean estimates for the calorie consumption elasticity are between 44 and 48 and between 32 and 33 for the price per calorie elasticity.

40|$|Although the {{discovery}} of diamond has propelled Botswana {{from one of the}} poorest countries in 1966 to <b>its</b> current <b>economic</b> <b>status</b> as a middle-income country, the country still faces the problems of economic diversification, employment creation, income generation and distribution and poverty alleviation. Governmental and non- Governmental organizations have put many efforts on the development of small and medium Enterprises (SMEs) to diversify the economy away from mining, to create jobs, generate income and alleviate poverty. However, the pace of development of SMEs, after 30 years, is very slow. The small business failure rate is currently estimated to be over 80 %. There is a general consensus among policy makers, politicians and researchers in Botswana that this trend {{should not be allowed to}} continue indefinitely. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the Perceived Critical Success/Failure factors (PCSFs) affecting the development of SMEs by collecting primary data from 203 SMEs in 3 cities in the republic of Botswana through a questionnaire. Both descriptive and inferential statistics were employed to present the empirical data. The findings showed that ten PCSFs (human resources development; organizational development, managerial background; managerial leadership and competitive strategy) affect the performance of SMEs. The PCSFs are strongly related among themselves, indicating the need for a holistic and systematic approach in addressing them. Important relationships were also found between the PCSFs and firm-specific demographic variables such as ownership status, experience and operation period.
