5|$|The oldest {{unambiguous}} termite fossils date to {{the early}} Cretaceous, but given the diversity of Cretaceous termites and early fossil records showing mutualism between microorganisms and these insects, they likely originated earlier in the Jurassic or Triassic. Further evidence of a Jurassic origin <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>assumption</b> that the extinct Fruitafossor consumed termites, judging from its morphological similarity to modern termite-eating mammals.

5|$|Swami Gnanapragasar {{believes}} that the first Ariyacakravarti also called Cinkaiariyan (Ariyan from Cinkainakar) was Kalinga Magha himself. Three main arguments are adduced to support the claim that these kings were of Eastern Ganga descent. The first is the similar device on their coins; the bull couchant and the crescent surmounting it were struck on coins issued by the Eastern Gangas and Ariyacakravartis. The second is the traditions of their origins are almost identical. The last <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>assumption</b> of titles Kangkainaadan (From the country of Ganges) and Kangkaiariyan (Ariyan from the Ganga dynasty). According to S. Pathmanathan's history of the Jaffna kingdom, these only establish similarity, but not any conclusive direct connections. Pathmanathan {{believes that}} we cannot categorically link the Aryacakravarti dynasty with Eastern Gangas and can explain most of the similarities based on influence, even Western Ganga Dynasty descendants who had moved into Tamil lands after their defeat by the Chola Empire around the year 1000 and interpret them simply as reflecting a claim of origin from the Hindu holy city of Varanasi {{on the banks of}} the holiest river Ganges.|$|E

It is the situation in which females adjust their mating rate to balance the costs of male harassment. It has been suggested that convenience polyandry would increase when females are weaker than males, decreasing the costs of sexual aggression. Convenience polyandry is seen in several arthropod species, like water striders (Gerris buenoi).|$|E

25|$|Recently, an {{association}} between biofilms and tonsilloliths was shown. Central to the biofilm concept <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>assumption</b> that bacteria form a three dimensional structure, dormant bacteria being in the center {{to serve as a}} constant nidus of infection. This impermeable structure renders the biofilm immune to antibiotic treatment. By use of confocal microscopy and microelectrodes, biofilms similar to dental biofilms were shown to be present in the tonsillolith, with oxygen respiration at the outer layer of tonsillolith, denitrification toward the middle, and acidification toward the bottom.|$|E
25|$|A common {{method to}} achieve this is the self-consistent {{multiple}} scattering approach. One essential point in this approach <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>assumption</b> that the scattering properties of the surface, i.e. of the individual atoms, are known in detail. The main task then reduces to {{the determination of the}} effective wave field incident on the individual scatters present in the surface, where the effective field is the sum of the primary field and the field emitted from all the other atoms. This must be done in a self-consistent way, since the emitted field of an atom depends on the incident effective field upon it. Once the effective field incident on each atom is determined, the total field emitted from all atoms can be found and its asymptotic value far from the crystal then gives the desired intensities.|$|E
25|$|Another key {{concept in}} social {{cognition}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>assumption</b> that reality is too complex to easily discern. As a result, {{we tend to}} see the world according to simplified schemas or images of reality. Schemas are generalized mental representations that organize knowledge and guide information processing. Schemas often operate automatically and unintentionally, and can lead to biases in perception and memory. Expectations from schemas may lead us to see something that is not there. One experiment found that {{people are more likely to}} misperceive a weapon in the hands of a black man than a white man. This type of schema is actually a stereotype, a generalized set of beliefs about a particular group of people (when incorrect, an ultimate attribution error). Stereotypes are often related to negative or preferential attitudes (prejudice) and behavior (discrimination). Schemas for behaviors (e.g., going to a restaurant, doing laundry) are known as scripts.|$|E

25|$|An {{oversight}} in {{the application}} of the no-hair theorem <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>assumption</b> that the relevant degrees of freedom accounting for the entropy of the black hole must be classical in nature; what if they were purely quantum mechanical instead and had non-zero entropy? Actually, this is what is realized in the LQG derivation of black hole entropy, and {{can be seen as a}} consequence of its background-independence – the classical black hole spacetime comes about from the semiclassical limit of the quantum state of the gravitational field, but there are many quantum states that have the same semiclassical limit. Specifically, in LQG it is possible to associate a quantum geometrical interpretation to the microstates: These are the quantum geometries of the horizon which are consistent with the area, , of the black hole and the topology of the horizon (i.e. spherical). LQG offers a geometric explanation of the finiteness of the entropy and of the proportionality of the area of the horizon. These calculations have been generalized to rotating black holes.|$|E
500|$|Perhaps {{one reason}} for the {{pervasive}} belief that the medieval war horse had to be of draught horse type <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>assumption,</b> still held by many, that medieval armour was heavy.

500|$|Official {{municipal}} boundaries were first drawn up in 1832 in the Netherlands after a cadastre was formed. The Municipalities Act of 1851, written by prime minister Thorbecke, {{led to the}} disappearance of small municipalities. Throughout the years, less populous municipalities have been merged. They were either added to the larger neighbouring cities or multiple smaller municipalities merged into a larger new municipality with a new name. The number of municipalities reduced from 1,209 in 1850 to 537 in 2000; [...] there are 388 municipalities. During this time, multiple mergers occurred simultaneously in large parts of individual provinces; the {{municipal boundaries}} were basically redrawn in these regions. In the 19th and {{large parts of the}} 20th century, municipal mergers were forced by the central government. This policy changed in the end of the 20th century; local support for the merger is now {{a large part of the}} decision-making process. The larger, merged municipalities are intended to handle an increasing workload because more public services are delegated from higher levels of government to the municipalities. Another reason for municipal mergers <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>assumption</b> that larger municipalities are more efficient in performing their tasks than smaller ones.|$|E
