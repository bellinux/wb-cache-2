50|$|The {{essential}} {{feature of}} a <b>diode</b> <b>bridge</b> {{is that the}} polarity of the output is the same regardless of the polarity at the input. The <b>diode</b> <b>bridge</b> circuit was invented by Polish electrotechnician Karol Pollak and patented on 14 Jan, 1896 under the number DRP 96564.

40|$|By {{replacing}} a series resistor in active {{band pass filter}} (BPF) with an improved memristive <b>diode</b> <b>bridge</b> emulator, a third-order memristive BPF chaotic circuit is presented. The improved memristive <b>diode</b> <b>bridge</b> emulator without grounded limitation is equivalently achieved by a <b>diode</b> <b>bridge</b> cascaded with only one inductor, whose fingerprints of pinched hysteresis loop are examined by numerical simulations and hardware experiments. The memristive BPF chaotic circuit has only one zero unstable saddle point but causes complex dynamical behaviors including period, chaos, period doubling bifurcation, and coexisting bifurcation modes. Specially, it should be highly significant that two kinds of bifurcation routes are displayed under different initial conditions and the coexistence of three different topological attractors is found in a narrow parameter range. Moreover, hardware circuit using discrete components is fabricated and experimental measurements are performed, upon which the numerical simulations are validated. Notably, the proposed memristive BPF chaotic circuit is only third-order and has simple topological structure...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a control method for the Doubly-fed Induction Generator {{connected to a}} dc link through a <b>diode</b> <b>bridge</b> on the stator. In this system, the rotor is fed, at the slip frequency, by a PWM electronic converter and the stator is directly connected to the dc link using a simple <b>diode</b> <b>bridge.</b> The cost of power electronics is reduced in this system {{when compared with the}} classic DFIG machine because the system uses less one PWM inverter and additionally it uses a <b>diode</b> <b>bridge.</b> The application in mind is for microgrids. Microgrids need several elements that should work together. The usual way to connect these elements is to use power electronic devices in a common dc link.

30|$|Because of its {{simple system}} configuration, low EMI at input ac mains and reduced voltage rippled dc side, {{multi-pulse}} rectifier (MPR) {{is widely used}} in adjustable speed drives, electro-chemical processes, aircraft converter systems and renewable energy conversion systems [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. A MPR comprises a phase-shifting transformer and several three-phase <b>diode</b> <b>bridge</b> rectifiers, where the harmonics generated by one rectifier can be cancelled by other rectifiers [7]. The phase-shifting transformer produces a set of 3 N-phase voltages with proper phase-shift angle to feed the three-phase <b>diode</b> <b>bridge</b> rectifiers [8]. Therefore, the phase-shifting transformer is the necessary device in MPR.|$|R

This paper presents a {{brief review of}} some high power rectifiers structures and provides an assessment of each analyzed technology. As contribution, a novel hybrid high power rectifier topology is proposed and analyzed. An active unidirectional three phase rectifier is associated in parallel with a three-phase 6 -pulse <b>diode</b> <b>bridge.</b> The main objective is to achieve a unity power factor high power converter, so that 50 % of the total power are processed by the <b>diode</b> <b>bridge</b> and the other ones 50 % for the active rectifier. The mathematical analysis and simulation results for a 26 kW converter are presented...|$|R
50|$|A typical {{application}} of inrush current limiters {{is in the}} input stage of non-power factor corrected switching supplies, to reduce the initial surge of current from the line input to the reservoir capacitor. The most popular application is the inrush protection of the AC current in switching power supplies (SPS). The primary reason for having surge current suppression in a SPS {{is to protect the}} <b>diode</b> <b>bridge</b> rectifier as the input or charging capacitor is initially charged. This capacitor draws significant current during the first half AC cycle and can subject the components in line with the capacitor to excessive current. The initial equivalent series resistance (ESR) of the capacitor provides very little protection for the <b>diode</b> <b>bridge</b> rectifier.|$|R
40|$|For the TESLA Test Facility at DESY modulators, which {{generate}} high voltage, {{pulses of}} 130 kV with an electrical power {{of up to}} 16. 8 MW are used. The pulses have a repetition rate of up to 10 Hz and a width of 1. 7 ms. Since {{it is not possible}} to take the pulsed energy directly from the mains the required energy is stored in capacitor banks to be released during the pulse. Power supplies are needed to recharge the capacitor banks of the modulators without disturbing the mains. In particular the low repetition rate of the pulses has to be suppressed. Tobe independent from the repetition rate the power supplies have to operate in a constant power mode. The DC charging current into the capacitors decreases during the loading with the same factor with which the voltage increases. In this way the current taken from the threephase mains is constant. Different types of power supplies have been investigated at DESY and are described here. These types are antiductors with secondary <b>diode</b> <b>bridges,</b> switched mode power supplies, <b>diode</b> <b>bridges</b> plus series switched mode supplies, <b>diode</b> <b>bridges</b> with SCR bridges in sequential phase control...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a frequency regulation {{system and a}} sensorless method for the direct estimation of the slip position of the wound-rotor induction machine connected to a DC link, performing a torque control. Since the stator {{is connected to the}} DC link through a <b>diode</b> <b>bridge,</b> it is also necessary to implement the stator frequency regulation. Connecting the DFIG to a DC link using a <b>diode</b> <b>bridge</b> on the stator brings considerable benefits, because only a dc/ac power electronic inverter is required. In this system the magnetizing current is necessarily fed by the rotor: this makes the considered sensorless method particularly appropriate, because, under mismatched parameters, it gives small estimation errors. Simulation and experimental results are presented matching and showing good performances...|$|R
50|$|Modern {{regulated}} supplies mostly use a transformer, silicon <b>diode</b> <b>bridge</b> recitfier, {{reservoir capacitor}} and voltage regulator IC. There are variations on this theme, such as supplies with multiple voltage lines, variable regulators, power control lines, discrete circuits and so on. Switched mode regulator supplies also include an inductor.|$|R
40|$|The {{conventional}} power electronic converters {{used in the}} microgenerator based energy harvesting applications have two stages: a <b>diode</b> <b>bridge</b> rectifier and a dc-dc conveter. But it is less efficient and cant be used for electromagnetic microgenerators, as the <b>diode</b> <b>bridge</b> rectification is not normally feasible due to extreme low output voltage of the microgenerators. In this paper a direct ac-dc power electronic converter topology is proposed for efficient and maximum energy harvesting from low voltage microgenerators. The single stage ac-to-dc power conversion is achieved by utilizing the bidirectional conduction capability of MOSFETs. A suitable startup circuit,auxiliary dc supply circuit and a control circuit is proposed {{for the implementation of}} the converter.

A source of balanced alternating electrical energy for energizing the circuit is coupled between the commonly connected plates of the first pair of capacitors and the commonly connected plates of the second pair of capacitors. Due to {{the operation of the}} <b>diode</b> <b>bridge,</b> the sum of the resultant charges developed on the first pair of capacitors is proportional to the relationship between the respective capacitors of the second pair, and consequently, an output voltage taken across the first pair of capacitors will be proportional to that relationship...|$|R
40|$|With {{the advent}} of the More Electric Aircraft (MEA) Initiative, {{standards}} for performance and stability are becoming harder to meet. Loads are becoming increasingly harsh, with many now drawing constant power. These loads place a larger strain on the distribution system than other types of loads. Moreover, these loads are being cycled much more quickly than in years past, and as such the response time of the generator control strategy is an increasingly important consideration. The standard <b>diode</b> <b>bridge</b> rectifier system is typically very slow to respond, and presents a difficult problem in terms of control, given the non-linearities of the system in question. A new generator control scheme utilizing an active converter, set forth by Gries, Wasynczuk, Selby, and Lamm in 2008, is investigated here, and compared with more traditional <b>diode</b> <b>bridge</b> rectifier systems in terms of stability and bus voltage response. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{majority}} of industrial controlled induction machine drives {{are connected to}} the mains via a <b>diode</b> <b>bridge.</b> However, if reduction of harmonic currents and / or regenerative operation is desired, replacing the <b>diode</b> <b>bridge</b> by an active front-end (AFE) is required. This paper describes two models of an AFE: a power balance model disregarding switching effects, and an ideal switching model of a pulse width modulation (PWM) converter. Both models are controlled utilizing space phasors in a voltage oriented reference frame. Voltage oriented control (VOC) of the mains converter can be compared with field oriented control (FOC) of a machine converter.
