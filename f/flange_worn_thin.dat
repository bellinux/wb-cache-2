50|$|The {{circular}} {{nature of}} the Mulberry Island and James River subdivisions meant that the running of trains would concentrate <b>flange</b> <b>wear</b> on the outer wheels of cars and locomotives. To minimize excessive and uneven <b>flange</b> <b>wear,</b> all of the FEMRR rolling stock had to be turned through the wye each quarter. Every piece of rolling stock on the railroad had a red disc painted on one side, about 18 inches from the right end of the equipment as seen from that side. During {{the first two weeks}} of each calendar quarter, all rolling stock was moved through the wye to reverse the orientation of the equipment.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotive}} uses standard EMD components - an EMD 710 prime mover, D43 traction motors, radial (self-steering) bogies of patented design, which reduce wheel {{surface and}} <b>flange</b> <b>wear</b> and {{is said to}} improve adhesion and reduce track load.|$|R
50|$|During the 1970s doctor Herbert Scheffel of the SAR {{experimented with}} {{self-steering}} bogies {{which not only}} reduced <b>flange</b> <b>wear</b> on goods wagons, but also opened up the possibility of running at high speed in passenger service on Cape gauge.|$|R
50|$|During 1937, the Class 16C engines were {{fitted with}} Stone-Deuta speed indicators. As built, the second coupled axle had {{flangeless}} wheels, {{but these were}} later retyred with flanges to obtain better distribution of tyre <b>flange</b> <b>wear</b> and improved running.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Aimed {{to wheel}} <b>flange</b> partial <b>wear</b> problem, the heavy haul train dynamic model was setup, and the coupler and buffer system was setup in detail. The dynamic {{performance}} of the train under the longitudinal coupler press force was simulated. The wheel/rail lateral force and wheel <b>flange</b> <b>wear</b> were analyses. Simulation results shown that the front locomotive will suffer a big longitudinal press force for the delay of the brake force transfer; this will lead {{the rotation of the}} coupler. The lateral force will apply to the car body at the position of coupler, which was caused by the longitudinal coupler force and the rotation angle of the coupler, then the wheel <b>flange</b> partial <b>wear</b> were induced as a result...|$|R
50|$|The minimum {{curve radius}} that the {{locomotives}} can negotiate is : any curve tighter than this could cause severe <b>flange</b> <b>wear</b> on the wheels. In order to reduce flange forces, the bogies are linked by a tubular-framed spring-loaded inter-coupling and flange lubricators are fitted to each wheel.|$|R
50|$|Bogies {{for the new}} {{locomotives}} were of Bo-Bo-Bo wheel arrangement. This {{differed from}} the diesel-electrics of the day which had Co-Co wheel arrangement. This three bogie, two axle, arrangement gave better weight distribution of the much heavier locomotives as well as better tractive effort and wheel <b>flange</b> <b>wear.</b>|$|R
50|$|While {{sound in}} theory, the design has {{produced}} mixed results in practice. Increased <b>flange</b> <b>wear</b> and decreased ride quality {{have been observed}} and some feel radial steering trucks are {{the answer to a}} question that wasn't asked. Many locomotives have had the active steering disabled through removal of the main steering link.|$|R
5000|$|The {{locomotive}} used {{saturated steam}} and had flat [...] "D" [...] type slide valves, placed above the cylinders {{and operated by}} Stephenson Link valve gear through rocker shafts. The leading wheels were mounted in a spring control bogie {{which was designed to}} overcome the problems of excessive <b>flange</b> <b>wear</b> on the coupled wheels and rail cutting on curves.|$|R

40|$|Rail {{and rail}} wheel <b>flange</b> <b>wear</b> {{on the rail}} track {{has been a problem}} of {{attention}} for the last 30 years. The problems arise in curves and depend on increased traffic volume, heavier axle load and also higher speed. Axle loads of 22, 5 - 25 ton is common nowadays and the trend is towards heavier axle loads where the next step is 30 - 35 ton. <b>Flange</b> <b>wear</b> includes both wheel and rail flanges and is therefore a problem for the operating company as well as the infrastructure owner. The <b>flange</b> <b>wear</b> depend mainly on the number of passed axles, type of traffic, speed and curve radius but also the axle load contributes. Flange lubrication on high rail is a well known way to reduce wear since the middle of 70 th and a number of techniques to lubricate the rail flange are developed as grease, aerosol of oil and dry stick with solid lubricants. The trackside lubricator can not apply the grease on the rail flange when the climate is during the winter. The infrastructure owner in Sweden was interested {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the track side lubricator. The investment in trackside lubricators over 20 years was about 75 Mkr (7, 6 USD) and also an additional yearly costs to operate 3000 apparatuses. The work to evaluate effectiveness of the lubrication started 1997 there one of the important matter concern the possibility to use environmentally adapted lubricants without hazard the rail. This licentiate thesis concern effectiveness of trackside lubricators to reduce wear in sharp railroad curves. Also the environmentally aspects have been considered and therefore natural esters synthetic esters and additives suited for those kind of lubricants have been evaluated. The research proved that environmentally adapted lubricants could lubricate as good as earlier used greases. Some amount of metal removal is probably healthy for this kind of application. Lubricants as synthetic esters can be designed get those qualities. It was also found significant difference between the seasons concerning <b>flange</b> <b>wear.</b> This difference depends on the problem to apply grease on the rail flange during the winter...|$|R
50|$|During the trials, the {{locomotive}} gave some trouble due to broken plate frames {{on the engine}} units {{and it was also}} found that the absence of trailing carrying wheels on the engine units was a disadvantage since it led to excessive <b>flange</b> <b>wear</b> on the coupled wheels. As a result, no. 2140 remained the only representative of its Class. All subsequent Garratt models of the SAR were equipped with trailing Bissel trucks.|$|R
50|$|The ECR was {{the first}} railway company to use a two-wheel pony truck, in 1859, using the design of American {{inventor}} Levi Bissell. This innovation was patented in the USA on November 2, 1858 and on 1 December 1858 in Great Britain. In the summer of 1859 the ECR fitted the truck to locomotive 248, a Kitsons built 2-4-0 of 1855, and {{it was reported that}} the ride of the locomotive was improved and wheel <b>flange</b> <b>wear</b> noticeably reduced.|$|R
50|$|The {{distance}} between the locomotive's tyres, i.e. between the wheel flanges on the axle, was 3 ft. This was 3/8 in greater than for engines of the Cape Government Railways and Natal Government Railways and, although the flanges were somewhat thinner, the resulting tightness to gauge was blamed for the rather high rate of <b>flange</b> <b>wear.</b> To obtain greater life from the leading coupled wheels, they were occasionally exchanged with the trailing coupled wheels during overhauls.|$|R

30|$|The most {{important}} part of the wheel to be affected by <b>wear</b> is the <b>flange</b> area, which is used to maintain dynamic stability of the vehicle and prevent its removal from the line. According to published reports from wear situation on the London Underground, the factors affecting the deterioration flange, the most effective agent, are moving in severe arches [27]. The severity of wear is to the extent that the <b>flange</b> <b>wear</b> is reduced 16 – 21 times only by using appropriate lubrication in arches.|$|R

50|$|With the {{development}} of mining operations {{in the northern part}} of Korea, traffic volumes increased significantly, and Sentetsu found a need for a locomotive with strong pulling power suitable for use on mountainous lines with sharp curves and steep slopes. The locomotive designed in response to this need was not of the Mika type, which was Sentetsu's standard freight locomotive, but of the Mate type with 4-8-2 wheel arrangement; the leading bogie was designed to reduce <b>flange</b> <b>wear</b> on the wheels. The resulting Matei class locomotives became a mainstay on long-distance freight trains on mountainous lines.|$|R

In 1875 a second locomotive (no. 7) was similarly rebuilt, although this {{seems to have been}} a trial for new features adopted for the Skye bogies. The other 5 locomotives of this batch remained as 2-4-0s but were rebuilt with cabs and longer ( [...] stroke) cylinders between 1875 and 1880. All were withdrawn between 1893 and 1899.|$|R
