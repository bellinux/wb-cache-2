5|$|A small, unisex monastic {{community}} in Bithynia, near Constantinople, may {{have developed the}} cross-in-square plan church during the Iconoclastic period, which would explain the plan's small scale and unified naos. The ruined church of St. John at Pelekete monastery is an early example. Monks had supported the use of icons, unlike the government-appointed secular clergy, and monasticism would become increasingly popular. A new type of privately funded urban monastery <b>developed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 9th century on, which may help to explain {{the small size of}} subsequent building.|$|E

5|$|Cabbage was {{probably}} domesticated later in history than Near Eastern {{crops such as}} lentils and summer wheat. Because of {{the wide range of}} crops <b>developed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> wild B.oleracea, multiple broadly contemporaneous domestications of cabbage may have occurred throughout Europe. Nonheading cabbages and kale were probably the first to be domesticated, before 1000 BC, by the Celts of central and western Europe.|$|E
5|$|During the season, three hurricanes {{developed}} from five named storms. This was below {{the average of}} 10storms per season, and represented the fewest tropical storms since 1939. Four of the five storms <b>developed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> intertropical convergence zone. The decreased activity is partially due to the westerlies extending further south than usual, {{as well as a}} persistent ridge. In addition, temperatures in the eastern United States were cooler than usual. Activity through September10 was the quietest in 30years.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, {{a number of}} {{additional}} styles <b>developed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> already eclectic base of industrial music. These offshoots include fusions with noise music, ambient music, folk music, post-punk and electronic dance music, {{as well as other}} mutations and developments. The scene has spread worldwide, and is particularly well represented in North America, Europe, and Japan. Post-industrial subgenres include dark ambient, power electronics, Japanoise, neofolk, electro-industrial, electronic body music, industrial hip hop, industrial rock, industrial metal, industrial pop, martial industrial, power noise, and witch house.|$|E
50|$|The {{placenta}} {{functions as}} a fetomaternal organ with two components: the fetal placenta (Chorion frondosum), which <b>develops</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> same blastocyst that forms the fetus, and the maternal placenta (Decidua basalis), which <b>develops</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> maternal uterine tissue. It metabolises a number of substances and can release metabolic products into maternal and/or fetal circulations.|$|R

5|$|Several modern {{organizations}} {{of various sizes}} claim to follow the tenets of Thelema. The two most prominent are both organizations that Crowley headed during his lifetime: the A∴A∴, an Order founded by Crowley, based on the grades of the Golden Dawn system; and Ordo Templi Orientis, an order which initially <b>developed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Rite of Memphis and Mizraim {{in the early part}} of the 20th century, and which includes Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica as its religious arm.|$|E
5|$|The ACLU <b>developed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> National Civil Liberties Bureau (CLB), co-founded in 1917 during World War I by Crystal Eastman, an {{attorney}} activist, and Roger Nash Baldwin.

5|$|The Ilyushin Il-6 was a Soviet {{long-range}} bomber <b>developed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Ilyushin Il-4 during 1942. Originally {{intended as}} a high-speed replacement for the Il-4, it was recast as a very long-range bomber with fuel-conserving diesel engines before production of the single prototype began in December 1942. Flight testing showed controllability issues when landing at high weights and the engines proved {{to be hard to}} start at low temperatures and were slow to respond to throttle movements. Further development was canceled in 1944.|$|E
5|$|The M15 design <b>developed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> United States Army Coast Artillery Corps' T1A2 Multiple Gun Motor Carriage (MGMC) project, which added a 37mm gun to an M2 Halftrack Car. It was {{designated}} the T28 and tested at the Aberdeen Proving Grounds. The tests were deemed unsuccessful due to heavy recoil, {{and the project}} was canceled in 1942.|$|E

5|$|The M19 was <b>developed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> T65 {{which was}} based on the M5 light tank chassis. The {{original}} design was improved upon and designated the T65E1. It was accepted into service in May 1944 as the M19 MGMC, equipping several U.S. Army anti-aircraft units during World War II. The M19A1 was an improved variant with an auxiliary engine and spare barrels for the 40mm Bofors guns.|$|E
5|$|The MSE {{derives from}} an {{approach}} to psychiatry known as descriptive psychopathology or descriptive phenomenology, which <b>developed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> work of the philosopher and psychiatrist Karl Jaspers. From Jaspers' perspective {{it was assumed that}} the only way to comprehend a patient's experience is through his or her own description (through an approach of empathic and non-theoretical enquiry), as distinct from an interpretive or psychoanalytic approach which assumes the analyst might understand experiences or processes of which the patient is unaware, such as defense mechanisms or unconscious drives.|$|E
5|$|The Rolls-Royce R was a British {{aero engine}} {{designed}} and built specifically for air racing purposes by Rolls-Royce Limited. Nineteen R engines were assembled in a limited production run between 1929 and 1931. <b>Developed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Rolls-Royce Buzzard, it was a 37-litre (2,240cu in) capacity, supercharged V-12 capable of producing just under 2,800horsepower (2,090kW), and weighed 1,640pounds (770kg). Intensive factory testing revealed mechanical failures which were remedied by redesigning the components, greatly improving reliability.|$|E

5|$|The {{middle ear}} and its {{components}} <b>develop</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{first and second}} pharyngeal arches. The tympanic cavity and auditory tube <b>develop</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{first part of the}} pharyngeal pouch between the first two arches in an area which will also go on to develop the pharynx. This develops as a structure called the tubotympanic recess. The ossicles (malleus, incus and stapes) normally appear {{during the first half of}} fetal development. The first two (malleus and incus) derive <b>from</b> <b>the</b> first pharyngeal arch and <b>the</b> stapes derives <b>from</b> <b>the</b> second. All three ossicles <b>develop</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> neural crest. Eventually cells <b>from</b> <b>the</b> tissue surrounding the ossicles will experience apoptosis and a new layer of endodermal epithelial will constitute the formation of the tympanic cavity wall.|$|R
50|$|The {{seminiferous tubules}} are formed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> testis cords that <b>develop</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{primitive}} gonadal cords, formed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> gonadal ridge.|$|R
5|$|The Tupolev Tu-12 (development {{designation}} Tu-77) was {{an experimental}} Soviet jet-powered medium bomber <b>developed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> successful piston-engined Tupolev Tu-2 bomber {{after the end}} of World War II. It was designed as a transitional aircraft to familiarize Tupolev and the VVS with the issues involved with jet-engined bombers.|$|E
5|$|The Welara is a part-Arabian pony breed <b>developed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Arabian {{horse and}} the Welsh pony. It was {{originally}} bred in England by Lady Wentworth at the Crabbet Arabian Stud {{in the early}} 1900s from imported Arabian stallions and Welsh pony mares. Breeding then spread throughout North America. In 1981, a breed registry was formed in the United States, and a studbook began to be published. They are used for many disciplines of English riding, and {{are known for their}} refinement, hardiness and spirit.|$|E
5|$|The Yermolayev Yer-2 was a {{long-range}} Soviet medium bomber used during World War II. It was <b>developed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Bartini Stal-7 prototype airliner before the war. It {{was used to}} bomb Berlin from airbases in Estonia after Operation Barbarossa in 1941. Production was terminated in August 1941 to allow the factory to concentrate on building higher-priority Ilyushin Il-2 ground-attack aircraft, but was restarted {{at the end of}} 1943 with new, fuel-efficient, Charomskiy ACh-30B aircraft Diesel engines.|$|E
