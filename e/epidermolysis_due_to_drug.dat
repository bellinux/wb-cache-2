40|$|Experimental animal {{models of}} the two forms of toxic {{epidermal}} necrolysis have been reviewed: a murine model of staphylococcal-induced epidermolysis and a hamster model of graft-versus-host disease. In the former, a protein exotoxin, epidermolysin, has been purified and characterized. The exotoxin has a molecular weight of approximately 30, 000 and causes a split beneath the granular layer. It is effective at 3 × 10 - 12 moles. Epidermolysin does not require an intact complement system for its action since B 10 D 2 mice deficient in C 5 or mice injected with the decomplementing agent in cobra venom factor were susceptible to its epidermolytic effects. Neither are immunocompetent thymocytes required for {{the action of the}} toxin since hairless, athymic adult (nu/nu) mice are susceptible. A few reports of <b>epidermolysis</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> an exotoxin of group I Staphylococcus aureus have appeared. This toxin is antigenically different from the exotoxin of group II organisms. A model of drug-induced toxic epidermal necrolysis has been described in hamsters, but the toxic principle released from sensitized lymphoid cells has not yet been characterized...|$|R

Although, chances of gynecomastia could be more if these two drugs are coadministered, but no case report of this adverse effect is ever reported when both are prescribed concurrently.
