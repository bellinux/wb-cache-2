5|$|Freedom fries was a {{political}} <b>euphemism</b> <b>for</b> French fries in the United States. The term came to prominence in 2003 when the then Republican Chairman of the Committee on House Administration, Bob Ney, renamed the menu item in three Congressional cafeterias in response to France's opposition to the proposed invasion of Iraq. Although originally supported with several restaurants changing their menus as well, the term fell out of use due to declining support for the Iraq War. Following Ney's resignation as Chairman in 2006, it was quietly reverted.|$|E
5|$|Sonderbehandlung is a German noun meaning special {{treatment}} in English. While it {{can refer to}} any sort of preferential treatment, it is known primarily as a <b>euphemism</b> <b>for</b> mass murder used by Nazi functionaries and the SS, who commonly used the abbreviation S.B. in documentation. It first came to prominence during Action T4, where SS doctors killed mentally ill and disabled patients between 1939 and 1941, {{and was one of}} a number of nonspecific words the Nazis used to document mass murder and genocide. Another notable example was Sonderbehandlung 14f13.|$|E
5|$|Geheime Staatspolizei ("Secret State Police"; Gestapo) was {{the secret}} police force of Nazi Germany and German-occupied Europe. Formed in April 1933 by the {{aviation}} minister Hermann Göring, it was by the following year administrated by the SS and regarded as a sister organization of the SD. The Gestapo relied on members of other agencies, spies and a huge network of informants for information. It was led by Heydrich and Heinrich Müller. Whether trained as police originally or not, Gestapo agents themselves were shaped by their socio-political environment. Historian George C. Browder contends {{that there was a}} four-part process (authorization, bolstering, routinization, and dehumanization) in effect which legitimized the psycho-social atmosphere conditioning members of the Gestapo to radicalized violence. The power of the Gestapo included what was called, Schutzhaft ("protective custody"), a <b>euphemism</b> <b>for</b> the power to arrest and imprison people without judicial proceedings.|$|E

5|$|With the SA {{out of the}} way, Heydrich began {{building}} the Gestapo into an instrument of fear. He improved his index-card system, creating categories of offenders with colour-coded cards. The Gestapo {{had the authority to}} arrest citizens on the suspicion that they might commit a crime, and the definition of a crime was at their discretion. The Gestapo Law, passed in 1936, gave police the right to act extra-legally. This led to the sweeping use of Schutzhaft—"protective custody", a <b>euphemism</b> <b>for</b> the power to imprison people without judicial proceedings. The courts were not allowed to investigate or interfere. The Gestapo was considered to be acting legally {{as long as it was}} carrying out the leadership's will. People were arrested arbitrarily, sent to concentration camps, or killed.|$|E
5|$|But Beyoncé is {{far from}} being all sentiment. Because a large part of being Beyoncé in America in 2013 is being a sexual {{creature}} and not only being unafraid of that fact, but reveling— and reveling confidently— in it. The amorphous, shifting Houston-trap-meets-Noah Shebib trunk rattler 'Partition' exemplifies this particular sentiment. On the track, the Queen Bey tells her driver to put the partition up because 'I don’t need you seeing 'Yoncé on her knees'; uses Monica Lewinsky as a <b>euphemism</b> <b>for</b> her man finishing on her clothing; reveals that 'he like to call me Peaches when we get this nasty'; and repeats that it took her '45 minutes to get all dressed up / and we ain’t even gonna make it to this club'. And in maybe the wildest moment in an album full of bold moves, Beyoncé actually slips in the French translation of Julianne Moore's 'Feminists love sex' monologue from The Big Lebowski.|$|E

30|$|<b>Euphemisms</b> <b>for</b> {{disability}} are popular—so {{popular that}} style guides prescribe against using <b>euphemisms</b> <b>for</b> {{persons who have}} disabilities. For example, the American Psychological Association (2010, p. 76) tells writers to “avoid euphemisms” for disability, such as “special, physically challenged, handi-capable” because those euphemisms “are condescending.” Similarly, “bypass condescending euphemisms” is a primary recommendation of the Research and Training Center on Independent Living (2013), who note that “terms such as special, handi-capable, differently abled and challenged reinforce {{the idea that people}} cannot deal honestly with their disabilities.” The American Speech-Language-Hearing Association also prescribes against using <b>euphemisms</b> <b>for</b> disability because <b>euphemisms</b> cannot “hide disability, but they can produce confusion” (Folkins, 1992).|$|R

2500|$|As {{in other}} languages, <b>euphemisms</b> <b>for</b> {{genitalia}} abound: the penis may be alternately {{referred to as}} a saging (banana), an ahas (snake), or a talong (eggplant), among other names. Researcher Michael Tan notes that the <b>euphemisms</b> <b>for</b> the vagina are considered more vulgar than those for the penis, and as such are fewer; but noted among them are mani (peanut), bibingka and bulaklak (flower). He posits patriarchal norms as the reason for this discrepancy.|$|R

25|$|Though Hell's Half Acre {{became a}} popular <b>euphemism</b> <b>for</b> red-light districts {{throughout}} Texas, {{the most well-known}} district to use this name was the one in Fort Worth.

It quickly became populated with saloons, brothels, and other vice dens offering gambling, liquor, and prostitutes.|$|E

25|$|Those {{who favor}} the non-sexual {{interpretation}} argue against a denotation {{of sexual behavior}} in this context, noting that while the Hebrew word for know appears over 900 times in the Hebrew Scriptures, only approximately 1% (13–14 times) of those references is it clearly used as a <b>euphemism</b> <b>for</b> realizing sexual intimacy. Instead, those who hold to this interpretation usually see the demand to know as demanding the right to interrogate the strangers.|$|E
25|$|The salsa {{controversy}} is also {{closely tied to}} the decades-long estrangement between the governments of the United States and Cuba, and the United States embargo against Cuba. Radio stations in the United States would get bomb threats (presumably from Cuban exiles) for playing Cuban records over the air. Homegrown salsa on the other hand, was embraced. For a time the Cuban state media officially claimed that the term salsa music was a <b>euphemism</b> <b>for</b> authentic Cuban music stolen by American imperialists, though the media has since abandoned this theory.|$|E
25|$|Numerous bands {{have found}} their names in Burroughs's work. The most widely known of these is Steely Dan, a group named after a dildo in Naked Lunch.

The novel Nova Express {{inspired}} the names of Grant Hart's post-Hüsker Dü band Nova Mob, as well as Australian 1960s R band Nova Express. British band Soft Machine took its moniker from the Burroughs novel of the same name. Alt-country band Clem Snide is named for a Burroughs character. Thin White Rope took their name from Burroughs's <b>euphemism</b> <b>for</b> ejaculation.|$|E

25|$|According to Ikuhiko Hata and Fumio Takahashi, whom Hata {{depended}} on for his research, after the battalion commanders agreed to surrender, the other soldiers in Takenaga's unit were assembled {{to see whether}} they would agree with the plan. Takahashi and Hata say that according to one of the surviving company commanders, after being told that the surrender was an order from Takenaga, those in favour were asked to raise their hands. Then, when around half of the soldiers did not raise their hands, they were issued hand grenades and told that they should choose their own fate (a Japanese <b>euphemism</b> <b>for</b> suicide). After this, all of the soldiers agreed to the surrender plan.|$|E
25|$|It was the Spaniards {{who gave}} the world the notion that an aristocrat's blood is not red but blue. The Spanish nobility started taking shape around the ninth century in classic {{military}} fashion, occupying land as warriors on horseback. They were to continue the process {{for more than five}} hundred years, clawing back sections of the peninsula from its Moorish occupiers, and a nobleman demonstrated his pedigree by holding up his sword arm to display the filigree of blue-blooded veins beneath his pale skin—proof that his birth had not been contaminated by the dark-skinned enemy. Sangre azul, blue blood, was thus a <b>euphemism</b> <b>for</b> being a white man—Spain's own particular reminder that the refined footsteps of the aristocracy through history carry the rather less refined spoor of racism.|$|E
