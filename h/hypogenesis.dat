Materials, Methods, and Results: A 26 -year-old, primigravid woman was referred for amniocentesis at 30 weeks of gestation because of hydrocephalus and short limbs. Prenatal ultrasound showed macrocephaly, prominent forehead, ventriculomegaly, corpus callosum <b>hypogenesis,</b> micrognathia, and ambiguous external genitalia. Amniocentesis was performed, and array comparative genomic hybridization using uncultured amniocytes revealed a 22. 2 -Mb deletion of 1 p 32. 3 -p 31. 1 [arr cgh 1 p 32. 3 p 31. 1 (55, 500, 291 bp– 77, 711, 982 bp) × 1] encompassing the genes of NFIA, GPR 177, and 89 additional genes. Cytogenetic analysis revealed a karyotype of 46,XX,del(1) (p 31. 1 p 32. 3) dn. At 33 weeks of gestation, a dead fetus was delivered with a body weight of 1536  g (< 5 th centile); relative macrocephaly; a broad face; prominent forehead; hypertelorism; anteverted nostrils; micrognathia; low-set ears; and abnormal female external genitalia with labial fusion, labial hypertrophy, absence of vaginal opening, and clitoral hypertrophy. Polymorphic DNA marker analysis determined a paternal origin of the deletion. Conclusion: Prenatal diagnosis of ventriculomegaly with an abnormal corpus callosum should alert subtle chromosome aberrations and prompt molecular cytogenetic investigation if necessary.

In this experiment, the differences {{of the visual}} evoked potentials among the normal corpus callosum, callosal <b>hypogenesis</b> and agenesis in ddN strain mice were investigated. One-Hz- flash stimulations were given on the left eye through a glass fiber connector from the EEG stimulator. Under Nembutal anesthesia, two hundred times of average evoked field potentials were recorded from the contralateral and ipsilateral visual cortices.

40|$|Symptoms of interhemispheric {{disconnection}} {{are typically}} much less severe in callosal agenesis than after surgical {{section of the}} corpus callosum. Sperry [Sperry, R. W., Plasticity of neural maturation. Developmental Biology, 1968, 2 (Suppl.), 306 - 327. ] has attributed this difference to two interconnected factors: (1) the callosal section is usually performed after the brain has lost the maximal degree of functional plasticity associated with {{the early stages of}} development and (2) the removal of an already formed structure is more disruptive for functional brain organization than the failure of the same structure ta develop. It has been suggested that functional compensation is less efficient if callosal agenesis is partial rather than complete [Dennis, M., Impaired sensory and motor differentiation with corpus callosum agenesis: A lack of callosal inhibition during ontogeny? Neuropsychologia, 1976, 14, 455 - 469. ]. This suggestion is supported by the present findings of partial left-hand anemia, partial left-field alexia and poor tactile cross-localization in a subject with a congenital absence of the posterior part of the corpus callosum due to an arteriovenous malformation. In agreement with many previous studies, similar, though more severe, symptoms of interhemispheric disconnection were found in a subject with a complete section of the corpus callosum, but not in a subject with,complete callosal agenesis. Praxic control of the left hand on verbal commands was severely deficient in the callosotomy subject, but it was normal in the subject with callosal <b>hypogenesis.</b> The lesser degree of compensation in partial compared to complete callosal agenesis may be explained by a reduced pressure to develop extracallosal means of interhemispheric communication, contingent on the partial existence of callosal connections, {{as well as by the}} later occurrence in development of the causes of callosal <b>hypogenesis</b> compared to those of total callosal agenesis.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Prenatal ethanol {{exposure}} {{can cause}} development retardation and malformations in human off-spring. Before {{the formation of}} chorioallantoic placenta, yolk sac {{plays an important role}} in transporting nutrients from the mother to the embryo. Functional suppression of yolk sac is found to be relevant to the malformations in mammalian embryos. METHODS: Female 8. 5 -day C 57 BL/ 6 J mouse embryos were cultured in vitro and exposed to different doses of ethanol. The development of visceral yolk sac (VYS) was examined with light and electron microscopes. The expression profiles of some vasculogenesis-related genes were detected with reverse transcrip-tion–PCR. RESULTS: A dose-dependent toxicity to the VYS was found, including reduced diameter, decreased protein and DNA contents, and suppressed development of vitelline vessels. The <b>hypogenesis</b> of VYS agreed with the retarded development and/or malformations found in the embryos. Histological and functional alterations were found in the ethanol-exposed VYS endodermal cells. The expressions of vasculogenesis-related genes, fetal liver kinase 1 (Flk 1) and tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin and epidermal growth factor homology domains 2 (Tie 2), were repressed by ethanol. CONCLUSIONS: Impaired structural and functional development of VYS may contribute to the teratogenic action of ethanol in mice, which may also provide a clue to the study of fetal alcohol syndrome in humans.

40|$|Purpose: To {{identify}} novel {{mutation in}} the PAX 6 (paired box gene 6) gene and characterize new clinical features of severe ocular malformation in a Chinese patient with Peters ’ anomaly. Methods: A 10 -month-old male infant, who presented with corneal opacity and nystagmus, {{was referred to}} our pediatric clinic and underwent a complete general physical and ophthalmological examination, including anterior segment and retinal evaluation with slit-lamp microscopy, an A/B ultrasonic scan, and electroretinography (ERG). Genomic DNA was prepared from venous leukocytes. The coding regions and the adjacent intronic sequence of PAX 6 were amplified by a polymerase chain reaction, and subsequently analyzed by direct sequencing. The variation detected was further evaluated in 100 controls using heteroduplex- single strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. Results: The patient had bilateral Peters ’ anomaly showing congenital nystagmus, corneal leukoma with anterior synechia, anterior polar cataract, and his pupils could not be dilated because of posterior synechia. Electroretinography (ERG) demonstrated retina <b>hypogenesis</b> and an A/B ultrasonic scan showed microphthalmus. A novel mutation: C. 51 C>A (P.

Through fluorescence-tracing of the cranial NCC migration marker nrp 2 b, we observed reduced intensity of NCC-derived cells in the heart. In addition, p 53 was markedly up-regulated in the eif 3 ba mutant embryos, which correlated with pronounced apoptosis in the cranial area as shown by TUNEL staining. These findings suggest a novel function of eif 3 ba during embryonic development and a novel level of regulation {{in the process of}} cranial NCC development, in addition to providing a potential animal model to mimic congenital diseases due to cranial NCC defects. Furthermore, we report the identification of a novel transgenic fish line Et(gata 2 a:EGFP) pku 418 to trace the migration of cranial NCCs (including cardiac NCCs); this may serve as an invaluable tool for investigating the development and dynamics of cranial NCCs during zebrafish embryogenesis...|$|E
40|$|The {{cause of}} {{spontaneous}} abortion of normal conceptuses remains unknown in most cases. The study was aimed {{to reveal the}} latent abnormalities by using a large collection of embryo images from a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) database and novel phase-contrast radiographic computed tomography (PXCT). MRI from 1, 156 embryos between Carnegie stage (CS) 14 and CS 23 from the Kyoto Collection were screened by using {{the volume of the}} liver as the target organ. Embryos with liver volumes ≥ 2 SD above or below the mean for the stage of development were screened and examined precisely on MRI. Embryos with potentially abnormal livers were further analyzed by using PXCT. Liver abnormality was detected in all 7 embryos in the extra-small liver group and in 2 of 8 embryos in the extra-large liver group. The abnormalities in the extra-small liver group consisted of hepatic agenesis (2 embryos), hepatic <b>hypogenesis</b> (4), and liver lobe defect (1). Among the 7 extra-small liver group, 2 had only liver abnormalities and 5 exhibited complications in other organs. Of the 2 embryos in the extra-large liver group, one had only a single liver abnormality and the other had a morphologically abnormal liver with complications in other organs. Most of such liver abnormality cases are not survive, as liver function becomes essential. The prevalence of liver malformations in CS 18 and CS 21 in the intrauterine population of externally normal embryos is approximately 1. 7 %. The present study {{is the first step toward}} the elucidation of the latent abnormalities resulting in spontaneous abortion in externally normal embryos...|$|E
