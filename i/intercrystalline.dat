40|$|The {{influence}} of ageing on fatigue fracture of the alloy Cu- 35 %Ni- 3. 5 %Cr has been investigated. Fatigue cracks propagate in all conditions investigated at first in an <b>intercrystalline</b> {{and later in}} a transcrystalline manner. The <b>intercrystalline</b> fraction of the fracture surface increases with increasing cycle number. This {{is the reason why}} the improvement of fatigue strength through ageing will be smaller with increasing cycle number, because precipitation hardening can be not fully utilized in the case of pronounced <b>intercrystalline</b> crack propagation. The transition from <b>intercrystalline</b> to transcrystalline crack propagation is determined by a certain stress intensity factor which increases with increasing alternating stress. Because of precipitation hardening, this transition is more difficult in decomposed conditions than in the solution-treated condition. This behaviour is discussed together with the density of microcracks at grain boundaries. (orig.) Reprinted from Int. J.

The {{geometrical}} {{classification of}} the <b>intercrystalline</b> general type boundaries with various misorientations of contacting crystals and orientations of boundary planes was suggested previously. An arbitrary grain boundary breaks up into three families of thermodynamically stable boundaries {{as a result}} of fragmentation process due to annealing of polycrystalline sample.

Different kinetic processes responsible for <b>intercrystalline</b> sliding, migration are considered, and expressions for characteristics of the low-temperature and high-temperature internal friction grain boundary peaks are obtained.

30|$|Many {{previous}} studies have reported the porosity improvement by dolomitization (Moore 2001; Swei and Tucker 2012; Meng et al. 2014 a, b). In this context, in most grainy facies and mudstones, fine crystalline dolomite has replaced both micrite and non-skeletal grains, generally resulting in {{a significant increase in}} reservoir quality, particularly permeability, compared with the precursor limestone (Xu 2013). With the development of <b>intercrystalline</b> pores, dolomites are more resistant to burial-related effects which therefore cause little reduction in porosity relative to limestones (Rabbani 2004) and are more frequently affected by fracturing than limestones and sandstones (Sun 1995). In addition, the <b>intercrystalline</b> pores provided conduits for the influx of hydrocarbons and acidic fluids, enhancing porosity due to leaching.|$|E

Under cyclic loading conditions two different mechanisms contribute to crack propagation which are termed stress corrosion cracking (SCC) and intergranular corrosion fatigue (CF). In both cases, it is well established that <b>intercrystalline</b> crack propagation is influenced by hydrogen penetrating into the gb during each load cycle.

40|$|Mercier's {{thermobarometer}} (Mercier 1980) and Saxena's thermometer (Dal Negro et al. 1982) {{were applied}} to single pyroxenes of both porphyroclastic (PF) and protogranular (PR) spinel peridotitic nodules enclosed in alkaline products related to necks of North-Eastern Brazil. <b>Intercrystalline</b> temperatures obtained using both orthopyroxene (opx) and clinopyroxene (cpx) compositions were in agreement, and were lower in protogranular than in porphyroclastic nodules (1051 ± 57 and 1266 ± 19 °C respectively). In contrast, pressure estimates using cpx and opx were conflicting, in particular as regards PF nodules. In fact for PF nodules cpx compositions point to 27 – 32 kbar (mean 29 ± 2) whereas opx compositions point to 17 – 19 kbar (mean 18 ± 1). Conversely, PR nodule cpx and opx compositions point to similar values 17 – 24 and 15 – 18 kbar respectively (mean 19 ± 4). The result obtained for PF nodules using cpx composition clearly contrasts with petrographic evidence and it {{is due to the}} peculiar composition of PF cpx (e. g. low Ca content, from 0. 645 to 0. 737 atoms per formula unit, a. f. u.) that strongly affects the barometric formulation. The PR and PF cpxs reveal similar mean intracrystalline temperature estimates (712 ± 112 and 778 ± 217 °C, respectively). These, considering the difference of about 200 °C in the <b>intercrystalline</b> temperature estimates, indicate that the exchange cation reaction between the M 1 and M 2 sites was a faster process in PF than in PR cpx, favoured by the low Ca content of PF cpx. Thus alternatively, the composition of PF cpx, characterized by a high rate of Ca » Mg substitution in the M 2 site, may not affect the <b>intercrystalline</b> temperature. Therefore the difference of about 200 °C found in <b>intercrystalline</b> temperatures between PR and PF cpxs, in spite of their same pressure values, may be interpreted as indicating an anomalous temperature gradient in the region...|$|E

Over this same range of impurities and grain sizes, only partial filling of a monolayer of impurities exists at the grain boundaries.

30|$|Although {{a trivial}} explanation, the {{interaction}} strength between the nanotube and underlying substrate, which changes {{the value of}} COF for several times, has a drastic influence {{on the use of}} nanomaterials as lubricants. The effect explains the still confusing phenomena [12] of higher friction typical of intracrystalline slip (0.06) than of <b>intercrystalline</b> slip (0.025) obtained for thin and flat MoS 2 crystals. The values of COF show an also unexpected similarity, revealing a mechanism of friction, which is beyond the shape effects. On the first view, and neglecting role of defects, a shear (intracrystalline slip) should not differ from <b>intercrystalline</b> slip. It should be even less energetically costive due to known easy shear of basal planes of the MoS 2 crystal structure parallel to the sliding direction leading to superlubricity [2], but just the opposite trend was reported [12]. Our results reveal that the interaction strength between the nanotube and underlying substrate plays {{a crucial role in the}} <b>intercrystalline</b> slip. Weak interaction prevents that the shear deformations would contribute to the energy cost in the friction process. The energy released during the friction process cannot dissipate to the substrate as easy as in intracrystalline slip, which is what results in lower consumption of energy by gliding and therefore to lower COF. Local electronic perturbation is also possible. Periodic crystal potential and electron dipole oscillations intensified by breaking of bonds between atoms of counterparts are at the origin of electron-phonon coupling; therefore, a local increase of temperature is expected.|$|E
