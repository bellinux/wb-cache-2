5000|$|Distributed <b>document</b> <b>capture</b> is a {{technology}} {{which allows the}} scanning of documents into a central server {{through the use of}} individual capture stations. A variation of distributed capture is thin-client <b>document</b> <b>capture</b> in which documents are scanned into a central server through the use of web browser. One of these web-based products was reviewed by AIIM. They said, [...] "(this product) is a thin-client distributed capture system that streamlines the process of acquiring and creating documents." [...] The streamlining is a result of several factors including the lack of software which needs to be installed at every scanning station and the variety of input sources from which documents can be captured. This includes things like email, fax, or a watched folder.|$|E

50|$|The {{goal for}} {{implementing}} a <b>document</b> <b>capture</b> {{solution is to}} reduce the amount of time spent in the scanning and capture process, and produce metadata along with an image file, and/or OCR text.

40|$|The {{increase}} in availability of high performance, low-priced, portable digital imaging devices {{has created an}} opportunity for supplementing traditional scanning for document image acquisition. Cameras attached to cellular phones, wearable computers, and standalone image or video devices are highly mobile and easy to use; they can capture images making them much more versatile than desktop scanners. Should gain solutions {{to the analysis of}} <b>documents</b> <b>captured</b> with such devices become available, there will clearly be a demand in many domains. Images captured from images can suffer from low resolution, perspective distortion, and blur, as well as a complex layout and interaction of the content and background. In this paper, we present a survey of application domains and technical challenges for the analysis of <b>documents</b> <b>captured</b> by digital cameras. Each method is discussed in brief and then compared against other approaches...|$|R
