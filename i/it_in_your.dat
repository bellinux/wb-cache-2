500|$|The {{theme of}} [...] "failed or betrayed friendship", in Leng's words, is most evident {{midway through the}} third verse, with the lines [...] "You've got me {{wondering}} how I lost your friendship / But I see <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> eyes". Doggett interprets this statement as reflecting Harrison's [...] "decaying relationship" [...] with McCartney at the time. Lennon too had been a friend of Harrison's since school days, and Leng includes him {{as a source of}} Harrison's [...] "minibereavement" [...] at the Beatles' impending demise.|$|E
500|$|As a solo {{act with}} backing musicians, Butterfield {{continued}} to tour and recorded the misguided and overproduced Put <b>It</b> <b>in</b> <b>Your</b> Ear in 1976 and North South in 1981, with strings, synthesizers, and pale funk arrangements. [...] In 1986, he released his final studio album, The Legendary Paul Butterfield Rides Again, which again {{was a poor}} attempt at a comeback with an updated rock sound. On April 15, 1987, he participated in the concert [...] "B.B. King & Friends", with Eric Clapton, Etta James, Albert King, Stevie Ray Vaughan, and others.|$|E

[...] At the time, Laucke was impressed by a piece called Entre dos aguas (Between Two Seas) that de Lucía was creating, which has become arguably his best-known composition. Since deLucía did not read music, Laucke offered to teach him but he refused. When the question arose as to whether Laucke would ever play deLucía's compositions in public, he advised Laucke, [...] "you must do <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> own style".|$|E

500|$|Reviews of the ZX81 {{highlighted}} the great {{value for money}} offered by the machine but noted its technical shortcomings. As Tim Hartnell put <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>Your</b> Computer, [...] "the ZX81 is both a delight and a disappointment". He applauded the improvements {{that had been made}} over the ZX80, such as a much better manual, display and string handling, and called the ZX81 [...] "a very good first computer" [...] that [...] "will open the world of computing to many who would be denied access to it by cost." [...] However, the built-in memory was so small that use of a memory expansion pack was [...] "mandatory for any worthwhile use". He also found the ZX81 to be alarmingly unreliable, having to have his first two test machines replaced before getting one that worked properly.|$|E
500|$|During the Dublin sessions, Eno {{was sent}} tapes of the {{previous}} two months' work, which he called a [...] "total disaster". Joining U2 in the studio, he stripped away what he thought to be excessive overdubbing. The group believes his intervention saved the album. Eno theorised that the band {{was too close to}} their music, explaining, [...] "if you know a piece of music terribly well and the mix changes and the bass guitar goes very quiet, you still hear the bass. You're so accustomed to it being there that you compensate and remake <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> mind." [...] Eno also assisted them through a crisis point one month before the recording deadline; he recalled that [...] "everything seemed like a mess", and he insisted the band take a two-week holiday. The break gave them a clearer perspective and added decisiveness.|$|E
500|$|Pennington {{argues that}} American Beauty defines its {{characters}} through their sexuality. Lester's attempts to relive his youth are {{a direct result}} of his lust for Angela, and the state of his relationship with Carolyn is in part shown through their lack of sexual contact. Also sexually frustrated, Carolyn has an affair that takes her from [...] "cold perfectionist" [...] to a more carefree soul who [...] " [...] happily along with" [...] the music in her car. Jane and Angela constantly reference sex, through Angela's descriptions of her supposed sexual encounters and the way the girls address each other. Their nude scenes are used to communicate their vulnerability. By the end of the film, Angela's hold on Jane has weakened until the only power she has over her friend is Lester's attraction to her. Col. Fitts reacts with disgust to meeting Jim and Jim; he asks, [...] "How come these faggots always have to rub <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> face? How can they be so shameless?" [...] To which Ricky replies, [...] "That's the thing, Dad—they don't feel like it's anything to be ashamed of." [...] Pennington argues that Col. Fitts' reaction is not homophobic, but an [...] "anguished self-interrogation".|$|E

500|$|... "Angel" [...] {{begins with}} a laugh and an echo, panning from left to the right. The song is built on an {{ascending}} hook consisting of three chord sequence, which serves for the verse and chorus. It consists of a constant 8th rhythm throughout the song, making it sound similar to the songs of the band Machine. Vocal harmonies are also added beneath the main chorus. It is a two-bar phrase song, and laughter is again added as the song slowly fades out. Madonna sings in her lower register at the beginning, and shifts to the higher one in the line [...] "I can see <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> e-e-e-eyye-e-s". The line {{was taken from the}} song [...] "Death Disco" [...] (1979), by the British musical group Public Image Ltd. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com, by Alfred Publishing, the song is set in the time signature of common time, with a medium tempo of 133 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of G major, with Madonna's voice spanning from the high-note of G3 to the low-note of B4. The song has a basic sequence of Am–Bm–C as its chord progression. The lyrics continuously repeat the angel-like image of Madonna's saviour.|$|E
500|$|Kemp was {{a critic}} of {{association}} football, known as soccer in the United States. In 1986, during a House floor debate over whether the United States should host the 1994 FIFA World Cup, Kemp proclaimed: [...] "I {{think it is important}} for all those young out there—who someday hope to play real football, where you throw it and kick it and run with it and put <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> hands— a distinction should be made that football is democratic capitalism, whereas soccer is a European socialist sport." [...] Kemp compared his speech to George Carlin's 1984 comedy routine on the differences between baseball and American football and wrote that his [...] "tongue was firmly planted in cheek" [...] when making the speech. Despite the levity of the speech, it garnered significant backlash. However, he continued to insist that soccer's main problem is [...] "it doesn't have a quarterback". Kemp noted that about half of his grandchildren play or have played organized soccer and claimed to have [...] "changed" [...] his position on soccer. He even attended the 1994 FIFA World Cup with longtime soccer fan Henry Kissinger, although he wrote during the 2006 FIFA World Cup that soccer can be interesting to watch but is still a [...] "boring game".|$|E

Despite the laidback groove, West shows his vulnerable side, as he laments being loved and left." [...] "Devil in a New Dress" [...] contains lyrics about lust and heartache, with sexual and religious imagery described by one critic as [...] "part bedroom allure, part angelic prayer". Rap-Up called it a [...] "female-focused song" [...] and a [...] "soulful track, boasting a slow-rolling beat with a haunting vocal sample.” Alex Koening of Knightnews wrote [...] "over piano flourishes and a scintillating string section contain some of the funniest tongue-in-cheek lyrics about women Kanye ever managed: 'I hit the Jamaican spot, at the bar, take a seat/ I ordered the jerk, she said {{you are what you}} eat.' Kanye might be on his quest for love, but he still isn’t able to tolerate gold-digging girls who are only after his cash: 'And outta all the colors that are still up the skies/ You got green on your mind, I can see <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> eyes.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Producer Oren Koules told horror news website ShockTilYouDrop.com {{that there}} are eleven traps in the film, the most ever in the franchise. [...] There is one [...] "trap" [...] scene in the film that {{producers}} would not allow in previous Saw films that they described as [...] "too violent", [...] "too disgusting", and [...] "just wrong". [...] Melton later confirmed that was the [...] "Garage Trap", which involved a car and sets off a [...] "chain reaction" [...] with other characters. Gabby West {{was part of the}} trap. She told VH1, [...] "They molded my entire face, and basically my entire upper body after my belly button. They put layers and layers of different materials on you and you have two straws in your nose so you can breathe. It was so scary! They put so much of it on, you can't see and they put <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> ears so you can barely hear anything. That was part of the prep for the film, which was really cool, to have a dummy made of yourself. But scary." [...] Over 25 gallons of fake blood was used in the film, which was two and half times more than Saw II.|$|E
500|$|Olivia became {{concerned}} about her daughter after Hilda Doolittle, who also believed she was engaged to Pound, arrived in London in 1911. Olivia welcomed H.D. to her home, but she witnessed the interactions between Dorothy, Pound, H.D. and Richard Aldington, whom H.D. married in 1913. In September 1912 Olivia wrote a stern letter to Pound, in which she pointedly told him to break off his friendship with Dorothy:You {{told me you were}} prepared to see less of Dorothy this winter.
