5|$|During the screening, {{the court}} heard that Muhammad had {{raised his hand}} to his {{forehead}} and moved his leg after the cameraman <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> was dead, {{and that there was no}} blood on his shirt. Enderlin argued that the cameraman had not said the boy was dead, but that he was dying. A report prepared for the court by Jean-Claude Schlinger, a ballistics expert commissioned by Karsenty, said that had the shots come from the Israeli position, Muhammad would have been hit in the lower limbs only.|$|E
5|$|Gilchrist {{was traded}} to the Denver Broncos in February 1965, but the Bills {{continued}} to win, ending with a 10–3–1 record and winning the AFL championship {{for the second year in}} a row. In the 1965 AFL championship game against the Chargers, when offensive linemen Billy Shaw and Dave Behrman were injured, Saban inserted veteran Ernie Warlick opposite rookie Paul Costa in a double tight end formation, which helped the Bills win the game, 23–0. Saban was named coach of the year for the second time in a row, silencing critics who <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> was indecisive, did not use his players properly and was not a good play-caller.|$|E

History will judge me like it did others.". Crowds continued protesting in Tahrir Square, demanding that the president step down. There were reports that Mubarak's proclamation came after President Barack Obama's special envoy, Frank G. Wisner, told Mubarak the U.S. saw his presidency at an end and urged him to prepare for an orderly transition to real democracy. In the past, Mubarak <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> would continue to serve Egypt until his last breath.|$|E
5|$|On 17 April 1986—the day {{the bodies}} of the {{teachers}} were found and McCarthy was kidnapped—Ann Marie Murphy, a pregnant Irish chambermaid, was discovered in Heathrow airport with a Semtex bomb in the false bottom of one of her bags. She had been about to board an El Al flight from New York to Tel Aviv via London. The bag had been packed by her Jordanian fiancé Nizar Hindawi, who <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> would join her in Israel where they were to be married.|$|E
5|$|Johansen rapidly climbed {{prospect}} charts for the 2010 NHL Draft, {{starting the}} year as a potential second round selection, before rising to 16th among North American skaters when the NHL Central Scouting Bureau (CSB) released its mid-season ranking. Johansen's coach with Penticton noted that, {{as one of the}} younger players of his draft class, his skill was often overlooked. NHL scouts praised his speed, playmaking ability and vision on the ice but believed he needed to show more consistency and physicality. He had been compared to Ottawa Senators centre Jason Spezza, while Johansen <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> tried to model his game after San Jose Sharks centre Joe Thornton. He finished the season as the tenth ranked skater according to Central Scouting and was projected to be a top 20 pick, perhaps as high as top 10. With the fourth overall pick in the 2010 NHL Draft, Johansen was chosen by the Columbus Blue Jackets.|$|E

25|$|Although he <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> {{would not}} be running for president, {{published}} reports in 2007 indicated that billionaire and New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg had been considering a presidential bid as an independent with up to $1 billion of his own fortune to finance it. Bloomberg ultimately ended this speculation by unequivocally stating {{that he would not}} run.|$|E
25|$|I met Laughton only once, at a party. Of all {{the actors}} I have seen, I {{think he would}} have come closest to doing Nero Wolfe perfectly.

25|$|Dempsey did {{not defend}} his title {{for three years}} {{following}} the Firpo fight. There was pressure from {{the public and the}} media for Dempsey to defend his title against Black contender Harry Wills. Disagreement exists among boxing historians as to whether Dempsey avoided Wills, though Dempsey claimed he was willing to fight him. When he originally won the title, however, he <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> would no longer fight Black boxers.|$|E

The RUC later reported that three people {{had been killed by}} loyalists during the strike, 41 RUC officers had been injured, there had been thousands of reports of intimidation, and 115 people had been charged with offences.|$|E
25|$|Four of Wittgenstein's former {{students}} {{arrived at his}} bedside—Ben Richards, Elizabeth Anscombe, Yorick Smythies, and Maurice O'Connor Drury. Anscombe and Smythies were Catholics; and, at the latter's request, a Dominican friar, Father Conrad Pepler, also attended. They were at first unsure what Wittgenstein would have wanted, but then remembered he <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> hoped his Catholic friends would pray for him, so they did, and he was pronounced dead shortly afterwards.|$|E
25|$|At the trial, the {{prosecution}} revealed that Brian <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> {{was impressed by}} Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, who committed the Columbine High School massacre. Later Adamcik {{was said to have}} been inspired by the Scream horror film franchise. On April 17, 2007, Draper was found guilty. Adamcik's trial started on May 31, 2007; he was convicted on June 8, 2007. On August 21, 2007, based on being convicted of first-degree murder, each received a mandatory sentence of life in prison without the possibility for parole, and 30 years-to-life for being convicted of conspiracy to commit murder.|$|E
5000|$|James <b>has</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> {{believes}} taxes {{should be}} kept [...] "low, simple, broad, and predictable" [...] and that increases in government spending should be matched to inflation and population growth.

25|$|Harrod's wife, daughter, and {{son-in-law}} {{believed that}} Harrod {{had been killed}} by one of his fellow hunters, a man named Bridges. The family claimed that Harrod and his companions had not been hunting beaver, but were instead searching for a silver mine that a man named Jonathan Swift had claimed to have discovered years before. Ann Harrod claimed that she had warned her husband that she feared that Bridges was planning to murder him because of a dispute over some property that the two had some years earlier. Although Harrod <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> was not afraid, he made out the will. He also allowed a fellow explorer and friend, Michael Stoner, to accompany him on the trip.|$|E
25|$|During his 2002 campaign, Romney <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> backed age-appropriate, {{comprehensive}} {{sex education}} in public schools. In 2005, against {{the will of}} the state legislature, he introduced federally funded abstinence-only education programs developed by a subsidiary of a Christian anti-abortion organization into some public schools. Romney said that adoption of the programs would be voluntary for individual school districts and that the programs would supplement rather than replace existing comprehensive sex education curricula. Opponents argued that funding pressure would lead to schools dropping comprehensive sex education programs for the freely available abstinence-only ones, which under federal law were required to teach that any sexual activity outside of marriage is likely to have harmful psychological and physical effects, and which were prohibited from discussing the potential benefits of contraception.|$|E
25|$|His {{victory was}} short-lived, however. On 4 December 1980, while {{on his way}} to a presidential {{election}} rally in Porto, the Cessna 421 he was on crashed into a building in Camarate, Loures, soon after takeoff from Lisbon Airport. Eyewitnesses claimed they saw pieces falling from the plane just moments after it took off. Rumours have continued to fuel conspiracy theories that the crash was in fact an assassination, but no firm evidence has come to light. There were even different theories as to whom would have been the target of such an assassination, as Francisco de Sá Carneiro was travelling with the Defence Minister, Adelino Amaro da Costa, who <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> had documents relating to the October surprise conspiracy theory and was planning on taking them to the United Nations General Assembly.|$|E
