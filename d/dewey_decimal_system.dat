5|$|One of the {{innovations}} of the <b>Dewey</b> <b>Decimal</b> <b>system</b> {{was that of}} positioning books on the shelves {{in relation to other}} books on similar topics. When the system was first introduced, most libraries in the US used fixed positioning: each book was assigned a permanent shelf position based on the book's height and date of acquisition. Library stacks were generally closed to all but the most privileged patrons, so shelf browsing was not considered of importance. The use of the <b>Dewey</b> <b>Decimal</b> <b>system</b> increased during the early 20th century as librarians were convinced of the advantages of relative positioning and of open shelf access for patrons.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} {{to the needs of}} smaller libraries who were finding the expanded classification schedules difficult to use, in 1894, the first abridged edition of the <b>Dewey</b> <b>Decimal</b> <b>system</b> was produced. The abridged edition generally parallels the full edition, and has been developed for most full editions since that date. By popular request, in 1930, the Library of Congress began to print Dewey Classification numbers on nearly all of its cards, thus making the system immediately available to all libraries making use of the Library of Congress card sets.|$|E
5|$|The Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC), or <b>Dewey</b> <b>Decimal</b> <b>System,</b> is a {{proprietary}} library classification system {{first published in}} the United States by Melvil Dewey in 1876.

It is also available in an abridged version suitable for smaller libraries. It is currently maintained by the Online Computer Library Center (OCLC), a non-profit cooperative that serves libraries.

25|$|The library {{moved to}} a new two-story stone library {{building}} in 1893. The building cost $156,477, representing 27 years of fundraising, mostly by Deady. A large portion of the funds came from Ella M. Smith, daughter of Benjamin F. Smith, in 1889. The library was staffed by D. F. W.

25|$|Upon Elizabeth Fargo's {{retirement}} in 1923, John E. Goodwin took the helm as librarian for {{a collection of}} 42,000 volumes, tended to by 12 staff members.

He also opposed and eventually defeated a proposal to make the library at Los Angeles an adjunct collection of a main research library at UC Berkeley.|$|E
25|$|Currently Adult, Young Adults, Junior, and Large Print {{collections}} are subdivided {{in the traditional}} manner, into fiction and nonfiction areas with the latter arranged according to the <b>Dewey</b> <b>Decimal</b> <b>system.</b> Media other than books are generally collated as separate collections or subdivisions.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Melvil Dewey {{had a great}} {{influence}} on the way libraries classify books. Much research and planning was involved with his <b>Dewey</b> <b>Decimal</b> Classification <b>System.</b> Most school libraries today still use his classification system. Therefore, students need to {{gain an understanding of}} this system in their school careers. Research was conducted on Melvil Dewey, in order to gain more understanding about his life, his classification system, his influences, and his ideas, which are still being used in libraries today. After learning about Melvil Dewey's life and his classification system, it will be easier to teach the concepts to the students. The library unit was designed to help students see the different sections in the <b>Dewey</b> <b>Decimal</b> Classification <b>System.</b> The students are getting hands-on experiences with each lesson.

500|$|The {{second edition}} of the <b>Dewey</b> <b>Decimal</b> <b>system,</b> {{published}} in 1885 [...] with the title , comprised 314 pages, with 10,000 index entries. 500 copies were produced. Editions 314, published between 1888 and 1942, used a variant of this same title. Dewey modified and expanded his system considerably for the second edition. In an introduction to that edition Dewey states that [...] "nearly 100 persons hav [...] contributed criticisms and suggestions".|$|E
500|$|Despite its {{widespread}} usage, {{the classification}} {{has been criticized}} for its complexity and limited scope of scheme-adjustment. In particular, the arrangement of subheadings has been described as archaic and as being biased towards an Anglo-American world view. In 200708, the Maricopa County Library District in Arizona, abandoned the DDC in favor of the Book Industry Standards and Communications (BISAC) system, one that is commonly used by commercial bookstores, {{in an effort to make}} their libraries more accessible for patrons. Several other libraries across the United States, and other countries (including Canada and the Netherlands) followed suit. The classification has also been criticized as being a proprietary system licensed by a single entity (OCLC), making it expensive to adopt. However, book classification critic Justin Newlan stands by the <b>Dewey</b> <b>Decimal</b> <b>System,</b> stating newer, more advanced book classification systems [...] "are too confusing to understand for newcomers".|$|E
500|$|The {{growth of}} the {{classification}} to date had led to significant criticism from medium and large libraries which were too large to use the abridged edition but found the full classification overwhelming. Dewey had intended issuing the classification in three editions: the library edition, {{which would be the}} fullest edition; the bibliographic edition, in English and French, which was to be used for the organization of bibliographies rather than of books on the shelf; and the abridged edition. In 1933, the bibliographic edition became the Universal Decimal Classification, which left the library and abridged versions as the formal Dewey Decimal Classification editions. The 15th edition, edited by Milton Ferguson, implemented the growing concept of the [...] "standard edition", designed for the majority of general libraries but not attempting to satisfy the needs of the very largest or of special libraries. It also reduced the size of the Dewey system by over half, from 1,900 to 700 pages. This revision was so radical that an advisory committee was formed right away for the 16th and 17th editions. The 16th and 17th editions, under the editorship of the Library of Congress, grew again to two volumes. However, by now, the <b>Dewey</b> <b>Decimal</b> <b>system</b> had established itself as a classification for general libraries, with the Library of Congress Classification having gained acceptance for large research libraries.|$|E

2500|$|For example, a major {{section of}} the {{building}} is the [...] "Books Spiral," [...] (designed to display the library's nonfiction collection without breaking up the <b>Dewey</b> <b>Decimal</b> <b>System</b> classification onto different floors or sections).

2500|$|Others in the 17th century, such as George Dalgarno, {{attempted}} similar {{philosophical and}} linguistic projects, some {{under the heading}} of mathesis universalis. A notable example was John Wilkins, the author of An Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language, who wrote a thesaurus as a first step towards a universal language. He intended to add to his thesaurus an alphabet of human thought (an organisational scheme, similar to a thesaurus or the <b>Dewey</b> <b>decimal</b> <b>system),</b> and an [...] "algebra of thought," [...] allowing rule-based manipulation. The philosophers and linguists who undertook such projects often belonged to pansophical (universal knowledge) and scientific knowledge groups in London and Oxford, collectively known as the [...] "Invisible College" [...] and now seen as forerunners of the Royal Society.|$|E
2500|$|Moving {{the books}} from the former Margaret I. King Library to the new William T. Young Library {{was not an easy}} task. If {{stretched}} out from end-to-end, the number of books in the old library would snake from Lexington to St. Louis. [...] The university hired William B. Meyer, part of United Van Lines, to move 1.2 million volumes from four locations. The move took eight weeks to complete beginning on May 11, 1998 at a cost of $500,000; 74 part-time laborers were involved at a cost of 34,560 person-hours. During this time, all books were kept in circulation and if a student were to request a volume, it would be accessible [...] "within twenty-four hours." [...] Adding onto the complications was the fact that 700,000 of the existing volumes had to be converted from the antiquated <b>Dewey</b> <b>decimal</b> <b>system</b> to the Library of Congress Classification system.|$|E
