25|$|Several {{months before}} the Democratic and Republican conventions, Perot filled the vacuum of {{election}} news, as his supporters began petition drives to <b>get</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ballot in all 50 states. This sense of momentum was reinforced when Perot employed two savvy campaign managers in Democrat Hamilton Jordan and Republican Ed Rollins. In July, while Perot was pondering whether to run for office, his supporters established a campaign organization United We Stand America. Perot was late in making formal policy proposals, but most {{of what he did}} call for were intended to reduce the deficit, such as a gasoline tax increase and cutbacks to Social Security.|$|E
500|$|Scott played interscholastic {{football}} as {{a running}} back and free safety at Plymouth-Whitemarsh High School. He was moderately recruited, but Scout.com thought he was more suited {{to the position of}} wide receiver or cornerback at the intercollegiate level. In 2006, he enrolled at the University of Maryland, where he was moved to wide receiver, but he spent the entire season on redshirt status. The following season, he saw limited action as a reserve running back behind starters Lance Ball and Keon Lattimore. He also played on special teams as a kickoff returner, which was the coaching staff's attempt to <b>get</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> field in some capacity because of his speed (4.31 seconds in the 40-yard dash and sub 10.5 seconds in the 100 meters) ...|$|E

Miles then radios Ben again, saying they {{have made it to}} Hydra Island and about his plan about the plane. As he is talking, Claire comes out from the bushes and fires two warning shots to tell them not to come closer. Richard manages to calm her down but she refuses to go on the plane with them. Miles radios a third time. Kate picks up. He says to her they are patching up the plane and getting ready to take off. He tells Kate about Claire not wanting to come with them. Kate then smashes the radio she has. Miles asks Frank how the plane was doing. Frank says he has to check the electrical outlet before they take off. [...] Miles and Richard repair the hydraulics with duct tape, then rejoin Frank in the cockpit.|$|E

2500|$|Phil Collins of Genesis {{was brought}} in to {{contribute}} some percussion to one or more tracks, seemingly because he was a friend of Lynott's.

2500|$|After his {{own show}} ended, Allen became a regular {{attraction}} <b>on</b> NBC's <b>The</b> Big Show (1950â€“1952), hosted by Tallulah Bankhead. He appeared <b>on</b> 24 of <b>the</b> show's 57 installments, including the landmark premiere, and showed {{he had not}} lost his trademark ad-lib skill or his rapier wit. (The show's head writer, Goodman Ace, later told radio host Richard Lamparski that Allen's lucrative NBC contract was a large factor in <b>getting</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> show, though Allen also wrote <b>the</b> segments <b>on</b> which he appeared and consulted with the respected Ace and staff on other portions of the show.) ...|$|R

60|$|May 11.--Hogg {{called this}} morning to {{converse}} about trying to <b>get</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pecuniary list of the Royal Literary Society. Certainly he deserves it, if genius and necessity could do so. But I {{do not belong to}} the society, nor do I propose to enter it as a coadjutor. I don't like your royal academies of this kind; they almost always fall into jobs, and the members are seldom those who do credit to the literature of a country. It affected, too, to comprehend those men of letters who are specially attached to the Crown, and though I love and honour my King as much as any of them can, yet I hold it best, in this free country, to preserve the exterior of independence, that my loyalty may be the more impressive, and tell more effectually. Yet I wish sincerely to help poor Hogg, and have written to Lockhart about it. It may be my own desolate feelings--it may be the apprehension of evil from this political hocus-pocus, but I have seldom felt more moody and uncomfortable than while writing these lines. I have walked, too, but without effect. W. Laidlaw, whose very ingenious mind is delighted with all novelties, talked nonsense about the new government, in which men are to resign principle, I fear, on both sides.|$|E

5000|$|During recording, former bassist Chris Chaney re-joined {{the band}} for its live performances, and {{subsequently}} began recording bass guitar parts, alongside Sitek, for the forthcoming album. In May 2011, Farrell commented on Chaney's involvement stating: [...] "I {{have to keep}} Chris away from Queen, who want him and they're not gonna' <b>get</b> <b>him</b> unless we're not doing anything. Then they can have <b>him.</b> I'm <b>getting</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> record and then he's gonna' come out with us for eight months." [...] According to Navarro, [...] "There are a few moments on songs that I am playing bass parts, but overall the bass duties are split between Dave Sitek and Chris Chaney, both creative and talented players. Chaney will be touring with us when the tour to support the album begins. He is the only bassist that has recorded a full length album with us, and is truly {{a member of the}} Jane's Addiction family, besides Avery, especially <b>on</b> <b>the</b> road.
