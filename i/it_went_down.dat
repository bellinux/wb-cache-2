5|$|Already in the Middle Ages, the {{population}} of Kraków consisting of numerous ethnic groups, began to grow rapidly. It doubled between 1100 and 1300 from 5,000 to 10,000, and in 1400 counted 14,000 inhabitants. By 1550, {{the population}} of metropolitan Kraków was 18,000; although <b>it</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> to 15,000 in the next fifty years due to calamity. By the early 17th century the Kraków population had reached 28,000 inhabitants.|$|E

In February, 11 aircraft brought his tally to 57—four fell on the 16th. After achieving his 57th he probably downed a 58th—a Hannover CL.III—but <b>it</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> over enemy lines under control as McCudden's guns seized having already fired 300 rounds at his first victim.|$|E
5|$|Super Bowl XXV {{took place}} amidst a {{background}} of war and patriotism in front of 73,813 fans at Tampa Stadium, in Tampa, Florida. The Persian Gulf War had begun {{less than two weeks}} previous and the nation rallied around the Super Bowl as a symbol of America. Adding to the patriotism was Whitney Houston's stirring rendition of the National Anthem, which became {{known as one of the}} greatest renditions in Super Bowl history. The game lived up to the stirring Anthem, as <b>it</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> as the most competitive Super Bowl in history. The Giants got off to a quick 3–0 lead. However, the Bills scored the next 12 points, on a field goal, a touchdown by backup running back Don Smith, and a safety after Jeff Hostetler was sacked in the end zone by Bruce Smith, to give the Bills a 12–3 lead. The Giants then ran a drive that took almost 8 minutes, and culminated in a 14-yard touchdown pass from Hostetler to Stephen Baker making the score 12–10 at halftime.|$|E

25|$|Much of {{the focus}} of the season was off the field as the club {{prepared}} for a move to their new grounds at Talobilla Park by securing government and council grants. The club had a small decrease in size as <b>it</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> to six senior teams and seventeen junior teams, yet only managed to secure an U12 premiership. The Major C team also came close to breaking its own Greater Brisbane League record when they defeated Narangba Demons 41–1 to become minor premiers.|$|E
25|$|After {{the socialist}} revolution, the life {{expectancy}} for all age groups went up. This statistic in itself was seen by some that the socialist system was superior to the capitalist system. These improvements continued into the 1960s, when {{the life expectancy}} in the Soviet Union surpassed that of the United States. It remained stable during most years, although in the 1970s, <b>it</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> slightly, possibly because of alcohol abuse. At the same time, infant mortality began to rise. After 1974, the government stopped publishing statistics on this. This trend can be partly explained {{by the number of}} pregnancies rising drastically in the Asian part of the country where infant mortality was highest, while declining markedly in the more developed European part of the Soviet Union. The USSR had several centers of excellence, such as the Fyodorov Eye Microsurgery Complex, founded in 1988 by Russian eye surgeon Svyatoslav Fyodorov.|$|E

25|$|During the 2005–06 season, Pirès {{started the}} season poorly, and {{players such as}} Freddie Ljungberg, José Antonio Reyes and Alexander Hleb were {{preferred}} to him on both wings. As the season progressed, though, Pirès's form improved, outscoring his selection rivals overall mainly because of a bizarre penalty incident with Thierry Henry against Man City when Pires having scored from the spot earlier in the game tried passing it to Arsenal's star striker but Henry missed the ball and <b>it</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> as a penalty miss. Pirès was instrumental in Arsenal Quarter Final Champions League first leg against Juventus F.C., where Arsenal won 2–0. Pirès successfully tackled Patrick Vieira and fed the ball to Thierry Henry who passed to Fàbregas to score Arsenal's first goal, {{the first time that}} Pirès had gotten the better of Vieira. Pirès played his last game for Arsenal in the UEFA Champions league final against Barcelona, in which he was substituted for replacement goalkeeper Manuel Almunia after starter Jens Lehmann was sent off.|$|E
25|$|On August 23, 1952, a bi-plane piloted by Charles McKay and John Pretner {{took off}} from the island airport and crashed in the {{backyard}} of a home on Markham Street, near Dundas Street West in Toronto. Both men {{were killed in the}} crash and ensuing fire. The plane was used by owner Charles Catalano's Aerial Advertising Service to pull signs behind it over the annual Canadian National Exhibition (CNE). It was not pulling a sign {{at the time of the}} crash. McKay was a pilot for Catalano and Pretner was his guest aboard the plane. According to Catalano, the plane had passed an airworthiness test two weeks previous. According to witnesses, the pilot appeared to lose control of the plane when <b>it</b> <b>went</b> <b>down.</b> According to Donald Saunders, the Ontario District Air Regulations supervisor at the time, it was the first plane crash within Toronto since the island airport opened in 1938.|$|E
25|$|On 9 May 1918, {{observer}} Kemp {{and pilot}} Thomson, in Bristol F.2b (C4851) {{were cut off}} from their formation by an Albatros D.V. Kemp emptied a drum into the Albatros which side-slipped and nose-dived, and was destroyed, crashing between Comines and Wervicq. This was Kemp's first victory. His next four were all from Bristol (C859). On 14 May 1918, Kemp scored his second aerial victory. He and his pilot followed an Albatros D.V down to 4,000 feet and fired about 100 rounds at it over the Wervicq and Zillebeke, West Flanders. The enemy plane crashed and the crew was captured. While on a patrol with other Bristol Fighters on 17 May 1918, Kemp and Thomson engaged a formation of enemy aircraft. They dived on an Albatros D.V, and fired a burst of about 200 rounds into it. <b>It</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> in a vertical dive and was destroyed, crashing between Armentières and Lille. Kemp scored a double victory that day, as another Albatros D.V was sent out of control over Armentières. On 18 May 1918, Kemp scored his fifth victory when a Pfalz D.III was sent out of control south of Merville, Nord.|$|E

25|$|Spencer, {{along with}} the {{successive}} Chief Secretaries, Chichester Fortescue and Spencer's own cousin, Lord Hartington, supported coercive legislation {{to deal with the}} increase in agrarian crime, {{but at the same time}} supported a policy of releasing Fenian prisoners when possible. Spencer also had to deal during his tenure with Gladstone's Irish Universities Bill. In spite of Spencer's efforts to secure the support of the Catholic hierarchy for the bill, they opposed it, and <b>it</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> to defeat in the commons in March 1873. The government lingered on for a further year, until the election defeat of February 1874, when Spencer found himself out of office. When Gladstone returned to power for his second government in 1880, Spencer joined the Cabinet as Lord President of the Council, having responsibility for education policy, and was partially responsible for several major educational reforms of the period. The increasingly tense situation in Ireland, however, commanded an increasing portion of Spencer's time. In May 1882, Gladstone's decision to release the Irish Nationalist leader Charles Stewart Parnell from prison led to the resignation of the hardline Chief Secretary for Ireland, W. E. Forster. As a result, Spencer, while retaining his seat in the cabinet and position as Lord President, was again appointed Lord Lieutenant to take charge of the government's Irish policy.|$|E
25|$|Unperturbed by Piquet's mind games, Mansell went on {{to record}} five Grand Prix wins in 1986 and also {{played a part in}} one of the closest {{finishes}} in Formula One history, finishing second to Ayrton Senna in the Spanish Grand Prix at Jerez by a mere 0.014 seconds (Mansell later jokingly said they should give himself and Senna 7½ points each). The 1986 season was led mostly by Mansell in championship points, and <b>it</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> to the wire in Adelaide, Australia for the Australian Grand Prix with Prost, Piquet and Mansell all still in contention for the title. The equation was simple, Prost and Piquet needed to win and have Mansell finish no higher than fourth. After aiming for a third-place finish which would guarantee him the title, Mansell would narrowly miss out on winning it after his left-rear tyre exploded in spectacular fashion on the main straight with only 19 laps of the race to go. In a 2012 interview for Sky Sports Legends of F1 Mansell revealed that, had he hit the wall rather than wrestling the car safely to a halt in the run-off area {{at the end of the}} straight, the stewards would most likely have red flagged the race. As the race was over two thirds distance, he would have kept his position and won his first F1 world title. Instead Mansell ended the season as runner-up to Alain Prost. His efforts in 1986 led to his being voted the BBC Sports Personality of the Year.|$|E

500|$|A {{few moments}} after {{beginning}} the display, and while still ascending, the balloon {{was seen to}} be in flames.

Blanchard began to descend rapidly, but the balloon, caught in the wind, continued to move off from the pleasure gardens even as <b>it</b> <b>went</b> <b>down.</b> Some spectators thought these events {{were part of the}} show and applauded and shouted their approval. The balloon had not risen very high and, although the escaping gas was burning, the gas within the balloon maintained sufficient lift for a while to prevent the craft plummeting directly to the ground. By rapidly shedding ballast Blanchard was able to slow the descent. Most reports say she appeared to be calm during the descent, but she was said to be wringing her hands in despair as the craft approached the ground. Rumours later circulated that she had gripped the chair of her craft so tightly that [...] "several arteries had snapt through the effort." ...|$|E
