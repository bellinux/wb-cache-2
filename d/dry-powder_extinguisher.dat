The carbon adsorbed 50 to 100 {{percent and the}} silica gels, 30 to 50 percent of their own weight of Freon. Several adsorbed systems were tested in a standard <b>dry-powder</b> <b>extinguisher</b> on a 5 -sq-ft gasoline fire for their effectiveness in putting out a fire.

25|$|During World War II, various chloroalkanes were in {{standard}} use in military aircraft, although these early halons suffered from excessive toxicity. Nevertheless, {{after the war}} they slowly became more common in civil aviation as well. In the 1960s, fluoroalkanes and bromofluoroalkanes became available and were quickly recognized as being highly effective fire-fighting materials. Much early research with Halon 1301 was conducted {{under the auspices of}} the US Armed Forces, while Halon 1211 was, initially, mainly developed in the UK. By the late 1960s they were standard in many applications where water and <b>dry-powder</b> <b>extinguishers</b> posed a threat of damage to the protected property, including computer rooms, telecommunications switches, laboratories, museums and art collections. Beginning with warships, in the 1970s, bromofluoroalkanes also progressively came to be associated with rapid knockdown of severe fires in confined spaces with minimal risk to personnel.|$|R
5000|$|Pyrene Panorama Limited was {{established}} in 1959 when Pyrene purchased the business of Panorama Equipment Limited, which itself dated from 1941. This company was formed originally to manufacture an industrial wide-field vision safety goggle which {{gave rise to the}} name-"Panorama". Also in 1959 Pyrene acquired Roberts McClean who in 1931 introduced self-contained compressed air breathing apparatus to the UK and these two companies merged under the Pyrene Panorama flag. In 1976 Fireward Limited, manufacturers since 1964 of plastic-bodied portable <b>dry-powder</b> fire <b>extinguishers</b> also merged with Pyrene Panorama, to form the new Company, Chubb Panorama. A further addition to the Panorama Group came in 1976 when with the change from Pyrene Panorama to Chubb Panorama, Submarine and Safety Engineering Limited joined the team. Specialists in self-contained under-water breathing apparatus and diving equipment, their [...] "Dominair" [...] range added considerably to the company's comprehensive coverage of safety equipment.|$|R
