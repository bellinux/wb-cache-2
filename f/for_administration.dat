5|$|Access to {{the more}} northerly (Bakerloo) part of the station is via the {{original}} building, while the exit is via a new extension next to Skipton House. Between the entrance and two shops is the entrance to South London House, an office block above the station. The BS station building remains much as originally constructed and is a typical Leslie Green structure. The main alteration is a modern glass-sided and glass-topped flat-roofed extension abutting the original western elevation, giving access to three of the six arches. These arches, in a classic deep-red faience style, formed the original perimeter: two are infilled with street-facing shops. As the station also functions as a drivers' depot, London Underground uses the offices above the station <b>for</b> <b>administration</b> and drivers' accommodation.|$|E

5|$|After World War II, a large, undeveloped hill {{owned by}} the {{university}} was used to house returning veterans in military-style campus housing. During the 1970s, this housing was replaced by permanent two-level townhouses {{for two or three}} students each, or for graduate family housing. There are also three small residence halls which feature open doubles. South Campus is also home to the Institute for Sensory Research, Tennity Ice Pavilion, Goldstein Student Center, Skytop Office Building and 621 Skytop Road (<b>for</b> <b>administration),</b> and the InnComplete Pub, a graduate student bar.

5|$|Clindamycin {{preparations}} for oral administration include capsules (containing clindamycin hydrochloride) and oral suspensions (containing clindamycin palmitate hydrochloride). Oral suspension is not favored <b>for</b> <b>administration</b> of clindamycin to children, {{due to its}} extremely foul taste and odor. Clindamycin is formulated in a vaginal cream and as vaginal ovules for treatment of bacterial vaginosis. It is also available for topical administration in gel form, as a lotion, and in a foam delivery system (each containing clindamycin phosphate) and a solution in ethanol (containing clindamycin hydrochloride) and is used primarily as a prescription acne treatment.|$|E

30|$|Besides {{the volume}} the pH, osmolality, {{viscosity}} and addition of co-solvents are critical factors <b>for</b> substance <b>administration</b> [31, 32]. The recommended pH range <b>for</b> intravenous <b>administration</b> is 2 – 9. A slow rate of injection {{in the case}} of non-physiological conditions reduces the occurrence of adverse effects such as cardiovascular failure. Intraperitoneal administration is more sensitive to non-physiological conditions than intravenous administration where the injected volume is immediately diluted and buffered by the blood pool. <b>For</b> intraperitoneal <b>administration,</b> the pH should be physiological and vehicles limited to saline or water. Tolerated co-solvents <b>for</b> intraperitoneal <b>administration</b> include propylene glycol or polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG 400).|$|R
5|$|Four {{months after}} the {{outbreak}} of the Korean War, the Agency had produced no coordinated estimate of the situation in Korea. Smith created a new Office of National Estimates (ONE) under the direction of William L. Langer, the Harvard historian who had led the Research and Analysis branch of the wartime Office of Strategic Services (OSS). Langer's staff created procedures that were followed for the next two decades. Smith stepped up efforts to obtain economic, psychological, and photographic intelligence. By December 1, Smith had formed a Directorate <b>for</b> <b>Administration.</b> The Agency would ultimately be divided by function into three directorates: Administration, Plans, and Intelligence.|$|E
5|$|General Douglas MacArthur was {{appointed}} as the Supreme Commander, Southwest Pacific Area, on its creation on 18 April 1942. He created five subordinate commands: Allied Land Forces, Allied Air Forces, Allied Naval Forces, United States Army Forces in Australia (USAFIA), and the United States Army Forces in the Philippines. The last command disappeared when Corregidor surrendered on 6 May 1942, while USAFIA became the United States Army Services of Supply, Southwest Pacific Area (USASOS SWPA). In 1943, United States Army Forces in the Far East was reformed and assumed responsibility <b>for</b> <b>administration,</b> leaving USASOS as a purely logistical agency. Both were swept {{away in a}} reorganisation in 1945. The other three commands, Allied Land Forces, Allied Air Forces and Allied Naval Forces, remained until SWPA was abolished on 2 September 1945.|$|E

5|$|In 1821, {{revenue was}} 816,444 francs, {{and the company}} paid a {{dividend}} of 555,500 francs. The company was able to raise its rates without reducing traffic. In 1822, the canal earned almost a million francs from carrying 243,200 tons of coal and 96,000 tons of other merchandise. The concession holders had repaid most of the debts they had incurred to build the canal, including many improvements since it was opened, {{and were able to}} pay healthy dividends. By 1824, the canal was giving annual revenues of 850,000 francs.

5|$|In February 1941 the Commandos were reorganized in {{accordance}} with a new war establishment. Each Commando unit now consisted of a Headquarters and six troops (instead of the previous 10). Each troop would comprise three officers and 62 other ranks; this number was set so each troop would fit into two Assault Landing Craft. The new formation also meant that two complete Commando units could be carried in the 'Glen' type landing ship and one unit in the 'Dutch' type landing ship. The motor transport issued to each commando consisted of one car for the commanding officer, 12 motorcycles (six with sidecars), two 15 hundredweight (cwt) trucks, and one 3-ton truck. These vehicles were only provided <b>for</b> <b>administration</b> and training and were not intended to accompany the men on operations.|$|E

This merged the borough of Weymouth and Melcombe Regis with Portland urban district. For local elections the borough is divided into 15 wards, and three of them cover Portland. Elections {{take place in a}} four-year cycle; one third of the councillors in all but three wards retire or seek re-election in years one, two and three, and county council elections are held in year four.|$|E

Each state is organised into a number of districts, which are further subdivided into revenue divisions and taluks (or tehsils) <b>for</b> <b>administration.</b> Local bodies govern respective cities, towns and villages with each electing a mayor, municipal chairman and panchayat chairman respectively to head the same.|$|E
