So one could well imagine—again, {{it depends on what}} the blue-ribbon panel says—one could well imagine that for a certain classification for a certain type of waste, you don't want to have access to it anymore, so that means you could use different sites than Yucca Mountain, such as salt domes. Once you put <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>there,</b> the salt oozes around it. These are geologically stable for a 50 to 100 million year time scale. The trouble with those type of places for repositories is you don't have access to it anymore. But say for certain types of waste you don't want to have access to it anymore—that's good. It's a very natural containment. ...whereas there would be other waste where you say it has some inherent value, let's keep it around for a hundred years, two hundred years, because there's a high likelihood we'll come back to it and want to recover that.|$|E

Martin also earned $232,750 in race winnings. Montoya was somewhat frustrated with the result, saying: [...] "Martin just screwed me -- he just stopped {{the car on the}} apex, right on the bottom, and I had nowhere to go," [...] Montoya said. [...] "I could have pushed him out of the way ... but I respect him a lot." [...] Martin was delighted with his victory: [...] "Alan [...] won the race, Alan's the man. This is a dream come true. ... We still have the lotto at Talladega , and [...] think we'll run OK at Martinsville. We finished [...] in the spring, but I don't run good there -- but this is my hardest place. It's a tough place." [...] Martin also argued that his driving did not cause the final caution: [...] " [...] Once you got the lead, you need to make sure you don't drive <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> and turn it sideways (and) slide it up the racetrack. I mean, how stupid would I look then?" ...|$|E

500|$|Musically, {{the album}} sees the band {{moving away from}} nu metal and {{focusing}} on a style categorized as groove metal. With strong elements of groove metal on the album, All Hope is Gone also features elements of death metal and thrash metal. Magazine Yell! wrote that All Hope is Gone [...] "expands on" [...] Slipknot's [...] "thrash metal guitar work and vocal melodies." [...] Prior to the album's release, Slipknot's members displayed interest in making All Hope Is Gone their heaviest album, which Joey Jordison affirmed saying, [...] "It's going to be heavier than , but just as weird and as experimental." [...] Corey Taylor reiterated this, describing All Hope Is Gone as a [...] "very dark" [...] combination of the band's two previous studio albums, Iowa and Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses). In All Hope Is Gone, Slipknot expands on their use of traditional song structures, acoustics, and solos that they introduced on their previous album Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses). The song [...] "Snuff" [...] is led by acoustic guitars and has been dubbed as Slipknot's [...] "attempt at a power ballad", though it remains [...] "dark and ominous". In an interview with Artistdirect, Shawn Crahan stated, [...] "Everyone can feel the pain that's in there. It's not forced upon you. You have <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> innately." [...] Slipknot also retained a metal edge reminiscent of their earlier work. Stephen Erlewine of Allmusic wrote that [...] "Gematria (The Killing Name)" [...] goes from [...] "a cluster of cacophony" [...] to [...] "an onslaught of densely dark intricate riffs". Crahan compared it to the song [...] "(sic)" [...] from their debut album, explaining, [...] "The technique and the style are very reminiscent of the old, brutal shit that we've done." [...] Jim Kaz of IGN stated that the [...] "swaggering, cock-rock groove and an anthemic chorus" [...] of [...] "Psychosocial" [...] gives Slipknot the potential {{to reach out to}} new fans [...] "without sacrificing a lick of intensity". Crahan stated he [...] "loves" [...] his parts of [...] "Psychosocial", in which the band incorporates snare drums, reminiscent of [...] "Before I Forget". He also cited [...] "This Cold Black" [...] as one of his favorite songs, saying that it has a [...] "driving tempo and a lot of attitude". The track [...] "Gehenna" [...] incorporates elements of Slipknot's slower, more cerebral edge reminiscent of [...] "Prosthetics" [...] and [...] "Purity" [...] from their debut album, and [...] "Skin Ticket" [...] from Iowa. Crahan called it a [...] "trippy song", explaining, [...] "It's just somewhere we go." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 1995 {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, Jagger said, [...] "I {{think that was}} taken from an old idea of Baudelaire's, I think, but I could be wrong. Sometimes when I look at my Baudelaire books, I can't see <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>there.</b> But it was an idea I got from French writing. And I just {{took a couple of}} lines and expanded on it. I wrote it as sort of like a Bob Dylan song." [...] It was Richards who suggested changing the tempo and using additional [...] percussion, turning the folk song into a samba.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding the {{explicit}} {{shots in the}} final photo slide show in which his character is seen receiving fellatio in an elevator, Galifianakis confirmed that a prosthesis {{was used for the}} scene, and that he had been more embarrassed than anyone else during the creation of the shot. [...] "You would think that I wouldn't be the one who was embarrassed; I was extremely embarrassed. I really didn't even want <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>there.</b> I offered Todd's assistant {{a lot of money to}} convince him to take it out of the movie. I did. But it made it in there." ...|$|E

We cultivate it, too, and we're proud of <b>it.</b> <b>It's</b> definitely <b>in</b> <b>there,</b> but <b>it's</b> not like where we're from {{is the only thing that}} defines what we're trying to do.

2500|$|A serve (or, more formally, a [...] "service") {{in tennis}} is a shot {{to start a}} point. The serve is {{initiated}} by tossing {{the ball into the}} air and hitting it (usually near the apex of its trajectory) into the diagonally opposite service box without touching the net. The serve may be hit under- or overhand although underhand serving remains a rarity. If the ball hits the net on the first serve and bounces over into the correct diagonal box then it is called a [...] "let" [...] and the server gets two more additional serves to get <b>it</b> <b>in.</b> <b>There</b> can also be a let if the server serves the ball and the receiver isn't prepared. If the server misses his or her first serve and gets a let on the second serve, then they get one more try to get the serve in the box.|$|E
2500|$|His mixed {{feelings}} about the journey stemmed, in Bowie's words, from [...] "wanting to be {{up on the stage}} performing my songs, {{but on the other hand}} not really wanting to be on those buses with all those strange people... So Aladdin Sane was split down the middle." [...] This kind of [...] "schizophrenia", as Bowie described it, was conveyed on the cover by his makeup, where a lightning bolt represents the duality of mind, although he would later tell friends that the [...] "lad insane" [...] of the album's title track was inspired by his brother Terry, who had been diagnosed as a schizophrenic. Bowie himself came up with the idea of the lightning bolt over his face, but said the teardrop was Brian Duffy's idea: [...] "He [...] put on that afterward, just popped <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>there.</b> I thought it was rather sweet." [...] Regarded as one of the most iconic images of Bowie, Mick McCann writing for The Guardian called it [...] "The Mona Lisa of album covers." ...|$|E
2500|$|The closer, [...] "When I Needed You", {{was written}} in a session with Tavish Crowe in order to process a break up wherein she realizes the faults of her {{seemingly}} [...] "perfect" [...] relationship: [...] " [...] {{but in order to}} stay in it, I would have to be quite a different person than who I naturally am [...] and that sacrifice didn't seem worth it in the end." [...] Dan Nigro and Nate Campany composed the [...] "happier-sounding" [...] instrumental, to which Jepsen felt a sense of catharsis in concealing a [...] "very serious" [...] emotion. Ariel Rechsthaid reworked the chord progression in order to invoke a sense of [...] "desperation", droning through it with a series of bell notes that made the composition sound [...] "a little bit more somber". The [...] "five-string, funk-R" [...] bass line was played by Ethan Farmer, and the drum fill, [...] "an 80s kind-of snare with a big reverb on it," [...] was inspired by John Mellencamp's [...] "Jack & Diane". Rechsthaid further directed Jepsen's ad-libs on the track: [...] " [...] producers really love to capture those moments where you say an awkward thing and for their own, sick pleasure just keep <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>there,</b> tucked." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2000, vice {{president}} Tim Wildmon {{spoke out against}} gay-straight alliance clubs in schools, stating, [...] "We view these kinds of clubs as an advancement of the homosexual cause." [...] In 2003, the AFA filed an amicus curiae brief in Lawrence vs Texas, arguing against repeal of Texas sodomy laws. In 2004, the AFA raised concerns about the movie Shark Tale because the group believed the movie was designed to promote the acceptance of gay rights by children. [...] On the October 11, 2005, AFA broadcast, Tim Wildmon agreed with a caller that cable networks like Animal Planet and HGTV featured [...] "evidence of homosexuality and lesbian people" [...] and added that [...] "you {{have to watch out}} for children's programs today as well because they'll slip <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> as well." [...] In 2007, the AFA spoke out against IKEA for featuring gay families in their television ads. [...] In June 2008, the AFA protested a Heinz television advertisement, shown in the United Kingdom, which showed two men kissing, which Heinz then withdrew. [...] On January 28, 2015, the AFA wrote to the Southern Poverty Law Center that the AFA now rejected the policy that homosexual conduct should be illegal.|$|E
2500|$|Vol. 2 was {{the first}} film to be shot with an 8K {{resolution}} camera, the Red Weapon 8K. Gunn had wanted to use a different camera than the Alexa 65 {{that had been used}} for several other Marvel films, because he found it to be a [...] "very big and heavy camera". He wanted a camera that could deliver equivalent image quality to the Alexa 65, and tested multiple options. He eventually met with Red, whom he had a positive experience with working on The Legend of Tarzan, and they introduced him to an early prototype for the Weapon 8K. He, Gunn, and Marvel decided to use the camera in September 2015, when only that single prototype existed, and spent months working with Red to get the camera ready for filming. For the sequence where Rocket and Yondu escape from the Ravagers, a Phantom Camera was used to film scenes up to 2000 frames per second, with the footage able to be moved from slow-motion to high-speed within a single shot. Each shot using the camera had to be carefully set up and choreographed. Additional scenes were also shot in IMAX and its aspect ratio. Braham filmed almost 85 percent of the film using a stabilizing technology he had contributed to called Stabileye, which he called [...] "a handheld dolly" [...] which allowed [...] "a spontaneity to the way the camera moves that is different and that felt appropriate for this movie." [...] For filming the cockpits of spaceships, Braham surrounded the practical sets with video panels and other light sources that he could use to create realistic lighting no matter the environment outside the ship. Exteriors of the ships were filmed with the camera on a technocrane, but any shots inside the cockpits again used the Stabileye which is [...] "so small that you can get <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> next to the actors".|$|E
