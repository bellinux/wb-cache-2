30|$|In vitro {{studies have}} shown that {{material}} surface properties, including the negatively charged and hydrophilic TiO 2 layer, are of importance for protein adsorption [25]. One reported issue is that in vitro adsorption of the same protein on the same type of surface may vary considerably between different studies {{as a consequence of the}} different experimental conditions. However, some general characteristics of protein interaction with titanium surfaces can be found. Proteins in solution accumulate spontaneously at materials interfaces and, in the case of titanium surfaces, most of them adsorb irreversibly since the process is <b>highly</b> energetically <b>favorable</b> [26]. However, some adsorbed proteins can detach due to protein competition and displacement processes [26]. The replacement of initially adsorbed proteins with high mobility by new proteins with lower mobility but higher affinity for the surface is the so-called Vroman effect [4]. Different adsorption isotherms reported in the literature [1, 27, 28] showed high affinity of fibronectin to titanium surfaces.|$|R
25|$|A {{catabolic pathway}} {{is a series}} of {{reactions}} that bring about a net release of energy {{in the form of a}} high energy phosphate bond formed with the energy carriers Adenosine Diphosphate (ADP) and Guanosine Diphosphate (GDP) to produce Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) and Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP), respectively. The net reaction is, therefore, thermodynamically favorable, for it results in a lower free energy for the final products. A catabolic pathway is an exergonic system that produces chemical energy in the form of ATP, GTP, NADH, NADPH, FADH2, etc. from energy containing sources such as carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. The end products are often carbon dioxide, water, and ammonia. Coupled with an endergonic reaction of anabolism, the cell can synthesize new macromolecules using the original precursors of the anabolic pathway. An example of a coupled reaction is the phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate to form the intermediate fructose-1,6-bisphosphate by the enzyme phsophofructokinase accompanied by the hydrolysis of ATP in the pathway of glycolysis. The resulting chemical reaction within the metabolic pathway is <b>highly</b> thermodynamically <b>favorable</b> and, as a result, irreversible in the cell.|$|R

A mid-level anticyclone located over southern California was steering the storm towards the northwest. Early on September1, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) stated that Howard had an 80percent chance of undergoing rapid intensification based on further development of the storm and a <b>highly</b> <b>favorable</b> environment around the cyclone. Based on the formation of an eye feature, the NHC upgraded Howard to a hurricane early on September1 while the storm was located about 420mi (675km) southwest of Manzanillo, Colima. Later that day, the eye of Howard became apparent on satellite imagery, which organized into a pinhole eye surrounded by a ring of symmetric, deep convection. At 0600UTC on September2, Howard was upgraded to a major hurricanea storm with winds of 111mph (178km/h) or higher.

5|$|The fleet {{conducted}} {{a series of}} sorties into the North Sea during the war designed to lure out an isolated portion of the numerically superior British Grand Fleet. These operations frequently used the fast battlecruisers of the I Scouting Group to raid the British coast as the bait for the Royal Navy. These operations culminated in the Battle of Jutland, on 31 May–1 June 1916, where the High Seas Fleet confronted the whole of the Grand Fleet. The battle was inconclusive, but the British won strategically, as it convinced Admiral Reinhard Scheer, the German fleet commander, that even a <b>highly</b> <b>favorable</b> outcome to a fleet action would not secure German victory in the war. Scheer and other leading admirals therefore advised the Kaiser to order a resumption of the unrestricted submarine warfare campaign. The primary responsibility of the High Seas Fleet in 1917 and 1918 was to secure the German naval bases in the North Sea for U-boat operations. Nevertheless, the fleet continued to conduct sorties into the North Sea and detached units for special operations in the Baltic Sea against the Russian Baltic Fleet. Following the German defeat in November 1918, the Allies interned the bulk of the High Seas Fleet in Scapa Flow, where it was ultimately scuttled by its crews in June 1919, days before the belligerents signed the Treaty of Versailles.|$|E

40|$|We present {{persistently}} amassing {{evidence that}} the CMS and ATLAS Collaborations may indeed be already registering supersymmetry events at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Our analysis is performed {{in the context of}} a <b>highly</b> phenomenologically <b>favorable</b> model named No-Scale F-SU(5), which represents the unification of the F-lipped SU(5) Grand Unified Theory (GUT), two pairs of hypothetical TeV-scale vector-like supersymmetric multiplets derived out of F-Theory, and the dynamically established boundary conditions of No-Scale supergravity. We document highly suggestive correlations between the first inverse femtobarn of observations by CMS and ATLAS, where seductive excesses in multijet events, particularly those with nine or more jets, are unambiguously accounted for by a precision Monte-Carlo simulation of the F-SU(5) model space. This intimate correspondence is optimized by a unified gaugino mass in the neighborhood of M_{ 1 / 2 }= 518 GeV. We supplement this analysis by extrapolating for the expected data profile to be realized with five inverse femtobarns of integrated luminosity, as expected to be observed at the LHC by the conclusion of 2011. Significantly, we find that this luminosity may be sufficient to constitute a SUSY discovery for the favored benchmark spectrum.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{clarify the}} factors {{affecting}} postoperative outcomes {{in patients who}} have suffered spontaneous spinal epidural hematomas. METHODS: We review 330 cases of spontaneous spinal epidural hematomas from the international literature and three unpublished cases of our own. Attention was focused on sex, age, medical history, mortality, size and position of the hematoma, vertebral level of the hematoma, preoperative neurological condition, operative interval, and postoperative result. RESULTS: Sex, age, and size and position of the hematoma did not correlate with postoperative outcome. Mortality correlated highly with cervical or cervicothoracic hematomas, especially in patients with cardiovascular disease and those undergoing anticoagulant therapy. Incomplete preoperative sensorimotor deficit correlated <b>highly</b> with <b>favorable</b> outcomes (P < 0. 0005), and recovery was significantly better when decompression was performed in < or = 36 hours in patients with complete sensorimotor loss (P < 0. 05) and in < or = 48 hours in patients with incomplete sensorimotor deficit (P < 0. 005). CONCLUSION: The critical factors for recovery after spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma are the level of preoperative neurological deficit and the operative interval. The vertebral level of the hematoma did not correlate with postoperative results, which suggests that local compression, rather than vascular obstruction, is the main factor in producing neurological deficit...|$|R
40|$|A poptosis-associated s peck-like protein with C ARD domain (ASC), an adaptor protein {{composed}} of caspase recruitment and pyrin domains, can efficiently self-associate {{to form a}} large spherical structure, called a speck. Although ASC aggregation is generally involved with both inflammatory processes and apoptosis, the detailed dynamics of speck formation have not been characterized. In this report, speck formation in HeLa cells transfected with ASC is examined by time-lapse live-imaging by confocal laser scanning microscopy. The results show that ASC aggregation is a very rapid and tightly regulated process. Prior to speck formation, soluble ASC aggregation is a low probability event, and the affinity of ASC subunits for one another is very low. Following a speck nucleation event, the affinity for further addition of ASC subunits increases dramatically, and aggregation is a <b>highly</b> energetically <b>favorable</b> reaction (Gibbs free energy[*]∼[*]− 40 [*]kJ/mol). This leads to a rapid depletion of soluble ASC, making it highly unlikely that a second speck will form inside the same cell and assuring that speck formation is “all or none,” with a well-defined end point. Comparison with kinetic models of the aggregation process indicates diffusion, instead of active transport, is the dominant process for speck growth.

40|$|CEPR Discussion Paper Series n° 1520 This paper {{analyses}} corporate risk {{choice when}} firms and their managers have private information regarding firm quality. Managers representing themselves or shareholders {{have a short}} time horizon and wish to boost the firm's reputation in the market. Investors observe the firm's current earnings to assess firm quality. Each firm has an opportunity locus for trading off risk and expected return. We show that even risk-neutral managers will choose risk strategically to influence market perceptions. Our model employs the following sequence: (1) a manager learns the firm's type (good or bad), which determines its opportunity locus relating to risk and expected return; (2) the manager selects a level of risk; (3) a period payoff is reaped; (4) potential purchasers of the firm draw inferences from the period payoff; and (5) the firm is sold in a competitive auction. If firms' choices of risk are observed by the market, pooling behavior results. Among the pooling equilibria, we show that good firms prefer those with lower variance, which reveal more information, whereas bad firms prefer higher variance equilibria. If risk level choices can only be partially observed, as we expect, and if the market has no strong prior belief about whether firms are good or bad, then good firms will hedge and bad firms will gamble. The latter seek to masquerade as good firms; good firms in turn seek to distinguish themselves. If the markets prior beliefs are <b>highly</b> unfavorable (<b>favorable),</b> both types gamble (hedge) hoping to alter (avoid refuting) these beliefs. Our empirical evidence confirms our theoretical results when risk choices are not fully observed. Firms with higher returns on assets have less variable performance...|$|R
