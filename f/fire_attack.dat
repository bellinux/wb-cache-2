5|$|After Chi Bi, Wu {{continued}} their conquests. Depending on {{the result of}} the <b>fire</b> <b>attack,</b> they will either attack Wei or Shu. Before either, the Wu defeat Dong Zhuo and Meng Huo's combined forces at Chang Jiang ("Tales").|$|E
5|$|Liu Bei then attacks either Wei or Wu, {{depending}} on if the <b>fire</b> <b>attack</b> at Chi Bi succeeds or not. Either Wei or Wu {{will be the}} final battle where you attack their capital; the battles are the same.|$|E
5|$|After {{defeating}} Yuan Shao, Cao Cao {{proceeds to}} fight against Liu Bei, who is wandering the land {{in search of a}} master. Xiahou Dun pursues and defeats Guan Yu, Liu Bei's brother, who is trying to escape to boats on the Huang He ("Tales"). In 208 AD, Cao Cao wins victories over Zhuge Liang's trickery at Bo Wan Po, defeats a fleeing Liu Bei at Changban, and stops a <b>fire</b> <b>attack</b> ploy by an allied fleet of Sun Jian and Liu Bei at Chi Bi.|$|E

5|$|Although his {{southern}} foes {{were still}} very alive, Cao Cao focused {{to the north}} to crush Ma Chao and his rebels at Tong Gate in 211 AD ("Tales"). He also chooses to defend against Lu Bu, who is terrorizing Xiapi, and in a fireattack, he ends Lu Bu's Offensive ("Tales"). Cao Cao's generals then destroy {{the army of the}} alive Dong Zhuo piecemeal at Ji Province ("Tales"), and he eradicates all of his foes. Cao Cao then chooses to go after Shu or Wu, depending on the result of the Chibi <b>fire</b> <b>attack.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Wu secured Xiangyang, the Nan Territory, Jiangling, and Jing Province from Wei before Shu's Zhuge Liang could, {{and also}} {{defeated}} Meng Huo {{for a second}} (or third) time in the south. Their final battle against Shu is at Yiling, where they use a <b>fire</b> <b>attack</b> to force Liu Bei to retreat to Bai Di Castle, where he is then defeated (or killed). If Wei has fallen first, Wu will defeat the Shu at Chengdu and occupy the lands of Shu Han, killing their officers.|$|E
5|$|With {{their home}} base secured, Wu looked to {{external}} threats. Huang Zu, who had formerly supported Liu Biao, prepared a pirate fleet to attack. Nanman king Meng Huo had shown signs of revolt in the south. In the north, Cao Cao prepared an armada {{to invade the}} south. Sun Ce and Zhou Yu defeated Huang Zu with a naval <b>fire</b> <b>attack</b> at Xiakou and convinced Gan Ning to join them, and Zhou Yu inflicted a decisive defeat on Meng Huo's elephant troops in Nanman. To fix the problem with Cao Cao, Sun Jian allied with Liu Bei and defeated Cao Cao's fleet at Chi Bi.|$|E

50|$|In ancient China, {{the use of}} {{petroleum}} in warfare was the most effective during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period and the following four major dynasties and powers from Song through to Yuan, including the Jin Dynasty and Liao Dynasty. During this time a small dynasty in Vietnam paid tribute to the Chinese emperor with petroleum. Before this time, <b>fire</b> <b>attacks</b> were limited to burning wood or animal fat; using petroleum greatly increased the potency of <b>fire</b> <b>attacks,</b> {{and the fact that}} trying to douse the burning petroleum with water will only spread the fire more rapidly made burning oil an ideal weapon for destroying cities filled with wooden structures.|$|R
50|$|Japanese POW {{transport}} {{ships are}} {{often referred to}} as hell ships, due to their notoriously unpleasant conditions and the many deaths that occurred on board. The Japanese did not mark their prisoner transports, leading to numerous casualties from friendly <b>fire</b> <b>attacks.</b>|$|R
5|$|Liu Bei {{proceeds}} to {{campaign in the}} southlands {{to get rid of}} Wu's threat, as Wu had backed a Nanman rebellion by King Meng Huo. In Nanzhong, he systematically defeated Meng Huo for a total of seven times, as Zhuge Liang cleverly resisted the Nanman armor troops and also pacified the poison marshes. After taking down Meng Huo, Shu proceeded to capture Fan Castle from Wei's Cao Ren, and also defeated Wu reinforcements under Lu Meng and traitors under Mi Fang and Fu Shiren. The final battle with Wu was at the Battle of Yi Ling, where Liu Bei braved a Wu <b>fire</b> <b>attack</b> and defeated (if Wu falls first, kills) Sun Jian and his officers. If Wei has been defeated before Wu, Liu Bei {{proceeds to}} attack Jianye, and sees through Sun Jian's body double trickery and kills Sun Jian, Sun Ce, Sun Quan, and Sun Shangxiang.|$|E
5|$|After {{defeating}} Dong Zhuo, Liu Bei and his sworn brothers Zhang Fei and Guan Yu {{are forced}} to wander the land {{in search of a}} home. Since the people love Liu Bei, Cao Cao sets out to destroy him. In 200 AD, Guan Yu returns to Liu Bei after an escape ("Tales"), making it through many gates to ships on the river. At Ru Nan ("Tales"), Liu Bei is rejoined by Guan Yu and is now followed by Zhao Yun, who saves him from advancing infantry. Cao Cao is defeated, but Liu Bei must continue wandering. In 208 AD, Liu Bei finds talent in a strategist known as Zhuge Liang, who agreed to follow him after Liu Bei visited him three times. Zhuge Liang proves his worth by defeating Cao Cao's army in a series of ambushes at the Battle of Bo Wan Po and Liu Bei successfully manages to flee to Sun Jian in Wu after the Battle of Changban, where Zhao Yun saved his son. Sun Jian agrees to assist Liu Bei in his goal of defeating Cao Cao, and Wu strategist Zhou Yu teams up with Zhuge Liang to execute a <b>fire</b> <b>attack</b> that destroyed Cao Cao's fleet at the Battle of Chi Bi.|$|E
5|$|Pontoon bridge: The Zhou Dynasty Chinese {{text of the}} Shi Jing (Book of Odes) {{records that}} King Wen of Zhou {{was the first to}} create a pontoon bridge in the 11th century BC. However, the British scientist, sinologist and {{historian}} Joseph Needham has pointed out that in all likely scenarios, the temporary pontoon bridge was invented during the 9th or 8th century BC in China, as this part was perhaps a later addition to the book (considering how the book had been edited up until the Han Dynasty, 202 BC220 AD). Although earlier temporary pontoon bridges had been made in China, the first secure and permanent ones (and linked with iron chains) in China came first during the Qin Dynasty (221 BC207 BC). The later Song Dynasty (9601279 AD) Chinese statesman Cao Cheng once wrote a description of the early pontoon bridges in China. During the Eastern Han Dynasty (25220 AD), the Chinese created a very large pontoon bridge that spanned across the width of the Yellow River. There was also the rebellion of Gongsun Shu in 33 AD, where a large pontoon bridge with fortified posts was constructed across the Yangtze River, eventually broken through with ramming ships by official Han troops under Commander Cen Peng. During the late Eastern Han into the Three Kingdoms period, during the Battle of Chibi in 208 AD, the Prime Minister Cao Cao once linked the majority of his fleet together with iron chains, which proved to be a fatal mistake once he was thwarted with a <b>fire</b> <b>attack</b> by Sun Quan's fleet. The armies of Emperor Taizu of Song had a large pontoon bridge built across the Yangtze River in 974 in order to secure supply lines during the Song Dynasty's conquest of the Southern Tang.|$|E
5000|$|Contrary to many RTS titles, where fire plays a secondary, [...] "eye candy" [...] role, fire in Stronghold is {{an actual}} {{gameplay}} element. For instance, the player is subtly encouraged to build wells against enemies that {{like to use}} <b>fire</b> <b>attacks.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{machine gun}} {{mounted in the}} turret was not a belt-fed type but rather the Type 97 tank-mounted heavy machine gun that used 20-round {{magazine}} clips. This presented a limitation in sustaining continuous <b>firing</b> <b>attacks.</b> There was no alternative available to address the issue.|$|R

25|$|Later, in Chapter 47, Cao Cao sends Jiang Gan {{to spy on}} Zhou Yu again. When Jiang Gan shows up, Zhou Yu {{pretends to}} be angry at him for {{stealing}} the letter earlier and orders his men to deny Jiang entry into his camp. Jiang Gan wanders around and meets Pang Tong in a nearby temple by chance, without knowing that Pang has been expecting him. He escapes and brings Pang Tong back with him to meet Cao Cao. Pang Tong gives fake advice to Cao Cao by suggesting that he uses metal chains to link his warships together to reduce the chances of his troops falling seasick. The chained-linked ships later become vulnerable to the <b>fire</b> <b>attack</b> during the Battle of Red Cliffs.|$|E
25|$|In combat, Frodo {{has access}} to three melee weapons at {{different}} stages in the game. Initially, he is armed with a walking stick. Later, he acquires a dagger, and finally, he can use the short sword Sting. Frodo can also throw stones, and can turn invisible for limited periods of time by using the One Ring. Aragorn is initially armed with a basic longsword, but later acquires Andúril. He also possesses a bow, and he can kick out at enemies. Gandalf uses his sword Glamdring and has several magical abilities, such as a <b>fire</b> <b>attack,</b> chain lightning and healing. The player can also switch to first-person view {{at any time during}} the game. This can help targeting when Frodo is throwing stones or Aragorn is firing arrows. Movement during first-person view is limited to strafing left and right.|$|E

500|$|After {{the capture}} of the main trenches, some guns from the 60th (London) and 74th (Yeomanry) Divisions were to target defences {{north and south of}} the main attack; others were {{deployed}} forward into the captured position to pursue the Ottoman forces with <b>fire,</b> <b>attack</b> stubborn defenders and deal with counterattacks. A further advance by the 2/13th Battalion, London Regiment, 60th (London) Division, through the forward infantry battalions, attacked and captured two field guns beyond the final objective with Lewis Guns after forcing the Ottoman detachments to retreat. Desert Mounted Corps headquarters reported seeing Ottoman troops retiring into Beersheba at midday, {{but it was not until}} late in the afternoon that two infantry brigades of the 54th (East Anglian) Division and the Imperial Camel Brigade, monitoring these defences north of the Wadi es Saba, became uncertain that the trenches were still defended. The 230th Brigade (74th Division) was ordered to launch an attack at 18:00 and an hour later, the reserve 230th Brigade occupied the northern trenches [...] "with little difficulty". They had been abandoned by all but a few snipers, since Beersheba had already been captured by the light-horsemen's charge which had begun at 16:30. The 60th (London) and 74th (Yeomanry) Divisions bivouacked on the battlefield behind a line of outposts; the 53rd (Welsh) Division remained, covering the western flank while the 10th (Irish) Division bivouacked at Goz el Basal.|$|E

5000|$|In {{a chapter}} of the book Myth, Media, and Culture in Star Wars, Michael Kaminski, writing about the {{influence}} of Japanese director Akira Kurosawa on the Star Wars films, said that Kurosawa's Ran influenced the exchange of blaster fire. Like in Ran, color-coding and an [...] "onscreen sense of direction" [...] of blaster fire are used to depict opposing forces. In the Star Wars original trilogy, rebels employed red blaster <b>fire</b> and often <b>attacked</b> from the left, while the Empire employed green blaster <b>fire</b> and <b>attacked</b> from the right. In Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones, the second film of the prequel trilogy, the color and the direction were reversed.
