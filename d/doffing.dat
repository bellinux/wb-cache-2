25|$|<b>Doffing</b> {{has already}} been described.|$|E
25|$|The <b>doffing</b> {{took only}} a few minutes, the piecers would run {{the length of the}} mule gate thrutching five {{spindles}} a time, and the <b>doffing</b> involved lifting four cops from the spindles with the right hand and piling them on the left forearm and hand. To get a firm cop bottom, the minder would whip the first few layers of yarn. After the first few draws the minder would stop the mule at the start of an inward run and take it in slowly depressing and releasing the faller wire several times. Alternatively, a starch paste could be skillfully applied to the first few layers of yarn by the piecers – and later a small paper tube was dropped over spindle – this slowed down the <b>doffing</b> operation and extra payment was negotiated by the minders.|$|E

In 1907 the Serigiers moved into their splendid new summer residence in Genk. Inspired by the villagers, one family in particular, Neel <b>Doff</b> puts her pen to paper. Tallying {{her work and}} enjoying her life as ‘Grande Dame’ within a selected social circle, she published many short stories in various magazines and periodicals. She also translated three works from Dutch into French.|$|R

25|$|The flyer is the {{original}} type of mechanical spinning frame and {{is believed to be}} a direct development of the Saxony wheel used in hand spinning. It is suitable for producing thick smooth yarns from coarse quality wools and hairs, but is falling into disuse because of the low speed at which the spindles have to run. As the yarn leaves the front rollers it is guided through a porcelain ring {{to the top of a}} revolving spindle, around and down one of the arms of the flyer and onto the bobbin. The bobbin is carried on a lifter plate and moves up and down the spindle. As the flyer revolves, imparting twist to the yarn, the bobbin which is free to rotate on the spindle is pulled round by the spun yarn. A felt or cloth washer is placed between the lifter plate and bobbin to retard the revolving bobbin and create adequate yarn tension for the flyer to wind the yarn evenly on the bobbin. When the bobbins are full they are removed and replaced by empty ones. This action is termed <b>doffing</b> and is done manually on this machine.|$|E
500|$|Despite being a {{critical}} success throughout its run, criticisms {{began to emerge}} of the series in its third season. Keith McDuffee of TV Squad described the third season as [...] "disappointing", mainly because the episodes offered nothing new: [...] "most fans of Veronica Mars felt that season three was clearly its weakest." [...] Eric Goldman of IGN said that the main issue was the shift in the overall tone, with a lighter feeling than the previous seasons. He felt that Logan had been most affected by the tone change, robbed of his darker aspects and changed into an [...] "increasingly extraneous character." [...] Goldman felt that despite the concerns over final five episodes, the series ended with [...] "three very strong episodes, with lots of strong dialogue and Veronica proving again just how tough she can be, and what a strong character she is." [...] Goldman concluded that although the third season [...] "was very choppy", it still had [...] "plenty of witty dialogue and a continually engaging performance by Kristen Bell as the title character." [...] The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette opined that Veronica Mars had taken a dive [...] "creatively", from [...] "the mopier version of its theme song to stalled storylines." [...] The reviewer felt that [...] "the arcing mysteries had grown less convincing and compelling {{as time went on}} and were too drawn out." [...] Fox News Channel's Bridget Byrne pointed out that Veronica had [...] "gone from punky to—dare we say—preppy" [...] in the third season. Byrne further explained that [...] "with her quick, bright wit and sharp eye for life's darker moments [...] has left high school and is going to college, <b>doffing</b> her dark threads and spiked tresses for something a little more stylish." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Doffing</b> is {{performed}} by the piercers thrutching, that is raising, the cops partially up the spindles, whilst the carriage is out. The minder then depressing the faller, {{so far as to}} guide the threads upon the bare spindle below. A few turns are wound onto the spindle, to fix the threads to the bare spindles for a new set. The cops are removed and collected into cans or baskets, and subsequently delivered to the warehouse. The remainder of the [...] "draw" [...] or [...] "stretch," [...] as the length of spun yarn is called when the carriage is out, is then wound upon the spindles as the carriage is run up to the roller beam. Work then commences anew.|$|E

2500|$|Sacco and Vanzetti went {{on trial}} for their lives in Dedham, Massachusetts, May 21, 1921, at Dedham, Norfolk County for the Braintree robbery and murders. [...] Webster Thayer again presided; he had asked to be {{assigned}} to the trial. Katzmann again prosecuted for the State. Vanzetti was represented by brothers Jeremiah and Thomas McAnraney. Sacco was represented by Fred H. Moore and William J. Callahan. The choice of Moore, a former attorney for the Industrial Workers of the World, proved a key mistake for the defense. A notorious radical from California, Moore quickly enraged Judge Thayer with his courtroom demeanor, often <b>doffing</b> his jacket and once, his shoes. Reporters covering the case were amazed to hear Judge Thayer, during a lunch recess, proclaim, [...] "I'll show them that no long-haired anarchist from California can run this court!" [...] and later, [...] "You wait till I give my charge to the jury. I'll show them." [...] Throughout the trial, Moore and Thayer clashed repeatedly over procedure and decorum.|$|E
2500|$|A pair of [...] long {{self-acting}} mules with 1320 spindles {{each would}} be tended by three employees: the minder or operative spinner, the big piecer, {{and the little}} piecer. The little piecer would start in the mulegate on his fourteenth birthday, and rise {{to the status of}} a minder. All these men worked barefoot, wearing white light cotton trousers. There were four basic tasks: creeling, <b>doffing,</b> cleaning and piecing. Creeling and piecing would both be done while the mule was in motion. Creeling was about replacing the bobbins in the creel while piecing the old disappearing thread with the new; it was done from behind the mule. Piecing was about joining any ends that had broken.The piecer would catch the snarled fuzzy broken end {{at the top of the}} spindle in his right hand and pull out some clean thread and wrap it around the left forefinger. This would be pressed into clean roving emerging from the attenuating rollers, pulling the hand away when the two had twisted together. All this was done while walking back and forth with the carriage, contact being made using the three of four seconds when the piecer was close enough to lean over the frame and reach the rollers. At this moment, left arm and leg forward, his crotch was adjacent to the base of the spindles.|$|E
2500|$|On {{obtaining the}} summit of the ridge the allied column found itself facing the French {{infantry}} line. The French guards rose and advanced towards the crest, whereupon the two forces confronted each other at a distance of 30 paces. The moment was immortalised by Lord Charles Hay of the 1st Regiment of Guards who later wrote that he stepped forward, took out a hip flask and drank with a flourish, shouting out to his opponent, [...] "We are the English Guards, and we hope you will stand till we come up to you, and not swim the Scheldt as you did the Main at Dettingen." [...] He then led his men in three cheers. Voltaire's version of this famous episode has become proverbial. He wrote: [...] "The English officers saluted the French by <b>doffing</b> their hats … [...] the French, returned the greeting. My Lord Charles Hai, captain in the English Guards, cried, 'Gentlemen of the French Guards, fire.' The Comte d'Auteroche, then lieutenant of Grenadiers, shouted, 'Gentlemen, we never fire first; fire yourselves.'" [...] The French were the first to fire, the volley was somewhat ineffective but threw the Third Guards into some confusion and wounded George Churchill, the commander of the guards brigade. Captain Lord Panmure led the unbroken companies of the Third Guards to the flank of the First Guards. Up to this point the British column had not fired a single musket shot, but now the allied infantry poured a devastating discharge into the French. The volley of musketry with the battalion guns delivering numerous rounds of grape-shot, swept away the front rank of the ten battalions of the French first line, killing and wounding between 700–800 men, breaking the Gardes Françaises, while the Gardes Suisses and the four battalions of the Brigade Aubeterre were driven back by the British advance.|$|E
