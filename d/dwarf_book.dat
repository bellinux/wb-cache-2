This model line was discontinued at the end of 5th edition and is no longer supported by the main rules. Forge World is releasing new Chaos Dwarf models under their new Warhammer Forge line. Rules for Chaos Dwarfs are expected in their first Warhammer supplement.|$|R

Most of these cultures {{are more or less}} contradictory to Tolkien´s descriptions: they are shown as nomadic Horse people much similar to the historical Huns, Mongols and Scythians. The [...] "Easterlings with axes", who were described as bearded like <b>dwarves</b> in the <b>books,</b> inspired a distinct race of half-dwarves similar to the [...] "Mul" [...] of Dungeons & Dragons, known as [...] "Umli", possibly ancestors of the later [...] "Easterlings with axes".|$|R

They were responsible for the creation of spaceships, the colonisation of the Galaxy, and the introduction of holograms, GELFs and artificial intelligences such as mechanoids and Simulants throughout the Galaxy. The Space Corps is somewhat analogous to Star Trek’s Starfleet and is responsible for the administrative organisation of all space travel in the Red Dwarf Universe.|$|R
50|$|In February 2000, Graham {{started work}} for Games Workshop {{as a staff}} writer for games development, writing {{articles}} for White <b>Dwarf</b> and army-specific <b>books.</b> In May 2000 he started writing for the Warhammer 40,000 team, but has also kept up writing articles for White Dwarf.

50|$|Plotting revenge, Kang {{orders a}} small group of five draconians, {{including}} himself and Slith, to enter the dwarven town to find out who burned down their village. Slith and the other three shape shift into dwarven guards, while Kang turns invisible. However, when the dwarves discover one of the draconians, the five beat a hasty retreat. Slith managed to steal a book with the map secreted within it from Selquist before they retreated; however, Selquist now pursues the draconians. After he catches Kang, he drives a knife into Kang's leg, temporarily crippling him. The dwarf and the draconians squabble over the book, ending up with the <b>dwarf</b> regaining the <b>book,</b> but the draconians keeping the cover, which has the map hidden inside it. The draconians retreat into their camp, unbeknownst to the fact they have the map to the Nerakan treasures.|$|R
50|$|The Dark Sun game line {{came to an}} end {{abruptly}} in late 1996. When TSR {{released its}} product schedule in Dragon #236 (December 1996) no Dark Sun products were included. The final release was Psionic Artifacts of Athas (1996) though two books, Dregoth Ascending and Secrets of the Dead Lands were rumored to have been near completion to the point that early versions were reportedly given to some GMs at the 1997 Gen Con Game Fair (1997) before the plug was pulled on the setting. Designer Kevin Melka claimed that another halfling product, a <b>book</b> on the <b>dwarves,</b> and a <b>book</b> on the Order were part of his official proposals for 1997. An invasion of the Kreen Empire was also being considered, according to Melka, along with the mystery of the Messenger, and a product on the Silt Sea to expand the world further prior to the line's cancellation.|$|R
50|$|Segueing from comics to children's {{literature}} in the 1980s, Wenzel illustrated Robb Walsh's Kingdom of the <b>Dwarfs</b> for Centaur <b>Books,</b> and then illustrated a series of books about American colonial life for Troll Associates. A recommendation from college classmate Larry Marder was key to Wenzel's landing his next major project. Marder was working {{with the people who}} had secured the rights to adapt The Hobbit to comics, and he knew firsthand that Wenzel had devoted his senior year in college to drawing Tolkien's characters. And so Wenzel provided the fully painted art for The Hobbit: An Illustrated Edition of the Fantasy Classic, a three-part adaptation of The Hobbit, written by Chuck Dixon and Sean Deming. The work was originally published by Eclipse Comics in 1989. Published in a collected edition by Ballantine in 1990, The Hobbit: An Illustrated Edition of the Fantasy Classic {{is one of the most}} successful graphic format adaptations of a piece of classic literature. In 2001, it was updated by Del Rey Books with a new cover, larger format, and 32 new pages of artwork.|$|R
5000|$|As {{production}} {{went further}} along, Robin Allan {{wrote in his}} book Walt Disney and Europe, that [...] "Ken Anderson wept when he saw how his character concepts had been processed into stereotypes for the animation on Robin Hood." [...] According to Ward Kimball and Ollie Johnston, one such casualty was the concept of making the Sheriff of Nottingham a goat as an artistic experiment to try different animals for a villain, only to be overruled by the director who wanted to keep to the villainous stereotype of a wolf instead. Additionally, Anderson wanted to include the Merry Men into the film, which was again overridden by Reitherman because he wanted a [...] "buddy picture" [...] reminiscent of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, so Little John was the only Merry Man who remained in the film, whle Friar Tuck was put {{as a friend of}} Robin's who lived in Nottingham, and Alan-a-Dale was turned into the narrator. Because of the time spent on developing several settings and auditioning actors to voice Robin Hood, production fell behind schedule. In order to meet its deadline, the animators decided to recycle dance sequences from Snow White and the Seven <b>Dwarfs,</b> The Jungle <b>Book,</b> and The Aristocats.|$|R
