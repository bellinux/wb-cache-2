25|$|The {{question}} of using mechanical harvesting versus traditional <b>hand</b> <b>picking</b> {{is a source}} of contention in the wine industry. Mechanical harvesting of grapes {{has been one of the}} major changes in many vineyards in the last third of a century. First introduced commercially in the 1960s, it has been adopted in different wine regions for various economic, labor and winemaking reasons. In Australia, the reduced work force in the wine industry has made the use of mechanized labor almost a necessity.|$|E
25|$|The {{cultivated}} {{forms are}} of the species sweet cherry (P. avium) to which most cherry cultivars belong, and the sour cherry (P. cerasus), which is used mainly for cooking. Both species originate in Europe and western Asia; they do not cross-pollinate. Some other species, although having edible fruit, are not grown extensively for consumption, except in northern regions where the two main species will not grow. Irrigation, spraying, labor, and their propensity to damage from rain and hail make cherries relatively expensive. Nonetheless, demand is high for the fruit. In commercial production, cherries are harvested by using a mechanized 'shaker'. <b>Hand</b> <b>picking</b> is also widely used to harvest the fruit to avoid damage to both fruit and trees.|$|E

25|$|The Luftwaffe's Chief of the General Staff, Hans Jeschonnek, {{wanted to}} begin the air attacks before the German {{artillery}} started firing. However, Hitler and the OKW decided it may give the opportunity for the Soviets to disperse their air units, and his idea was rejected. Hitler gave the order for the air strikes on airfields {{to be carried out}} at dawn. Although many new German bomber crews had only limited training in instrument-flying, the Luftflotten overcame the problem by <b>hand</b> <b>picking</b> experienced crews, who would cross the border at high altitude, to swoop on their targets. The Germans deliberately targeted Soviet fighter air bases first, to knock out potential opposition to its bombers and dive bombers.|$|E
25|$|Fires have {{historically}} been a vital component of the grassland ecosystem, but {{pose a threat to}} human life and property. In the Milk River Natural Area, management policy is suppression of wildfires, with prescribed controlled burns allowed for ecosystem maintenance purposes to manage the grassland in its climax state. Campfires are permitted but discouraged. Following the 2007 wildfire, inventories were conducted which showed an increase in species richness and also good recovery of native species with little invasion of exotics. Invasive weed species that have been found in the area, such as nodding thistle, are being controlled by spot spraying and <b>hand</b> <b>picking.</b> Larger species like the Russian olive are cut down and spot-treated.|$|E
25|$|At harvest time, AOC {{regulations}} stipulate grapes for Grand Cru vineyard must {{be picked}} {{with a potential}} alcohol level of at least 11 percent, at least 10.5 percent for Premiers Crus and 9.5 percent for AOC Chablis vineyards. Yields in Grands Crus must be limited to 3.3 tons per acre (45 hectoliters per hectare) with a 20% allowance for increased yields. There is no official regulation {{on the use of}} mechanical harvesting, but most Grand Cru producers prefer <b>hand</b> <b>picking</b> because human pickers tend to be more delicate with the grapes and can distinguish better between ripe and unripe bunches. Over the rest of the Chablis region, mechanical harvesting was used by around 80% of the vineyards {{at the turn of the}} 21st century. The traditional style of vine training in Chablis is to have the vine trained low to the ground for warmth with four cordons stretching out sideways from the trunk.|$|E

[...] In July 2010, Winehouse was quoted as saying her next album would be released no later than January 2011, saying [...] "It's going to be very much the same as my second album, where there's a lot of jukebox stuff and songs that are... just jukebox, really." [...] Ronson said the same month however that he had not started to record the album. She performed [...] "Valerie" [...] with Ronson at a movie premiere but forgot some of the song's lyrics.
