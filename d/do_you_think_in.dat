Does it not exercise its rights upon {{the waters of the}} river, the fire that bakes the poor man's bread of grass and barley, on the wind that turns the mill? The peasant cannot take a step upon the road, cross a crazy bridge over a river, buy an ell of cloth in the village market, without meeting feudal rapacity, without being taxed in feudal dues. Is not that enough, M. le Marquis? Must you also demand his wretched life in payment for the least infringement of your sacred privileges, careless of what widows or orphans you dedicate to woe?

They are ripping types, old man; not in the 'best society,' you understand, but I know you'll like 'em. Be as good to 'em as you can without involving anybody. Little Mrs. Haney is a corker. Good start on a self-made career. They're both unsophisticated in a way, and a little real sympathy will drag their secret history to the light. Do a sketch of her for me. She's likely to be famous. Haney is rolling in dough these days--(miner)--and she's bound for some whooping big thing, I don't know what, but she's like a country boy with a stirring ambition. It wouldn't surprise me to see her on Fifth Avenue {{one of the}}se days. With these few burning words I commend them into your plastic hands. Don't let Sammy paint her, for God's sake.

6000|$|And so {{completely}} and unexceptionally is this so, that, if I had time to-night, I could {{show you that}} a nation cannot be affected by any vice, or weakness, without expressing it, legibly, and for ever, either in bad art, or by want of art; {{and that there is}} no national virtue, small or great, which is not manifestly expressed in all the art which circumstances enable the people possessing that virtue to produce. Take, for instance, your great English virtue of enduring and patient courage. You have at present in England only one art of any consequence--that is, iron-working. You know thoroughly well how to cast and hammer iron. Now, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>in</b> those masses of lava which you build volcanic cones to melt, and which you forge at the mouths of the Infernos you have created; do you think, on those iron plates, your courage and endurance are not written for ever--not merely with an iron pen, but on iron parchment? And take also your great English vice--European vice--vice of all the world--vice of all other worlds that roll or shine in heaven, bearing with them yet the atmosphere of hell--the vice of jealousy, which brings competition into your commerce, treachery into your councils, and dishonour into your wars--that vice which has rendered for you, and for your next neighbouring nation, the daily occupations of existence no longer possible, but with the mail upon your breasts and the sword loose in its sheath; so that, at last, you have realised for all the multitudes of the two great peoples who lead the so-called civilisation of the earth,--you have realised for them all, I say, in person and in policy, what was once true only of the rough Border riders of your Cheviot hills-- ...|$|E

40|$|Transcription begins] Saturday night 11 - 4 - 44 My darling, This evening I got {{ambitious and}} {{answered}} five letters: Lolly, Harriet Filiurin, Kitty Speert, Rhoda Menshel, and Fred Livingston. Gosh, Saturday night seems {{always to be}} just the night I’m {{in the mood for}} answering letters. No mail at all today. Are we slippin’? Well, I managed to live through a whole day of work today. Things didn’t go too badly even though we were short staffed. I took about six of the older children this morning down to the basement of the church and we explored the storage room, the basement proper, and the furnace room. It was a rainy day, so it was ideal for this type of excursion. The children really enjoyed themselves. They were thoroughly fascinated when they walked into the dark furnace room and saw the fire in the furnace making shadows on the coal bin. It was beautiful to see the red flames seemingly eating up the coal bin. The children haven’t stopped talking about it yet! Uk came down and helped out in the afternoon. Both of us took the kids (about 6 of them) for a short ride to the Art Museaum [sic] to see if the swans and the ducks were still in the pond although it was raining. They were. And the children, being smart, insisted if those white birds could stay in the rain, they could too. I had a hard time getting out of that one! Let Uk drive the car for awhile this afternoon. She is learning! We drove up to where Dad had the car fixed and he just rechecked the motor and told me that he finds everything in good condition, and that the car would have a little more “guts” as soon as some things (I forgot the name, but I believe he said “rings”) loosen up! He advised putting in some anti-freeze, since today was really, really cold. I took it up to Dad’s station on Kinsman and he did it up with Preston[e] for me. Cost me $ 5. But it is suppose[d] to be good for the whole winter. Hope so! Darling, I’ve been so busy, I haven’t had a chance to read anything but Coronet. Gosh, there are so many books I had hoped to read this winter. Bet you get more reading done than I will! Bubsie darling, remember our Saturday night parties in Lawton [...] gosh, we sure did entertain expensively, but it was fun, and you learned to be a “beer guzzler. ” <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>in</b> your middle age {{you will be able to}} cultivate a “beer belly?” I’m sure anything you will cultivate I will adore, because you [are] the most marvelous, wonderful husband I could ever wish for [...] even when you holler at me! Sweetheart, you also, have the cutest little “tushie” in the world. I’d show it off with the best of them, but there are none better. I love you and every little tiny part of you!
