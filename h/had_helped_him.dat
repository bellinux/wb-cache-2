5|$|During his {{run as a}} variety-show host, Moore {{was tapped}} to host CBS' weekly prime-time TV panel show I've Got a Secret. It premiered on June 19, 1952. On this show, Moore began his friendships with comedian Henry Morgan and game show host and {{panelist}} Bill Cullen, {{with whom he had}} a long working relationship. Morgan later stated that Moore <b>had</b> <b>helped</b> <b>him</b> keep his job as a celebrity panelist on the show.|$|E
5|$|In 1874, Tesla evaded {{conscription}} {{into the}} Austro-Hungarian Army in Smiljan by running away southeast of Lika to Tomingaj, near Gračac. There he explored the mountains wearing hunter's garb. Tesla {{said that this}} contact with nature made him stronger, both physically and mentally. He read many books while in Tomingaj and later said that Mark Twain's works <b>had</b> <b>helped</b> <b>him</b> to miraculously recover from his earlier illness.|$|E
5|$|Rakeysh Mehra took {{seven years}} to {{research}} and develop the story, including three to write the script. While some raised doubts about his morale following the failure of his last film, Aks, at the box office, he retorted by saying {{that it would not}} affect him at all. He added that not only did his storytelling technique improve, but past mistakes <b>had</b> <b>helped</b> <b>him</b> improve his filmmaking abilities.|$|E

5|$|Chambers {{was cleared}} {{to compete on}} 10 June 2006, {{although}} his return was dependent on an agreement to repay prize money he won while using banned substances. He returned to competition on 11 June 2006 at the British Grand Prix and took third in 10.07s, behind Asafa Powell who equalled his own world record. Chambers stated that his training regime with Bolt <b>had</b> <b>helped</b> <b>him</b> make a strong opening performance despite a long absence from competition. The result placed Chambers {{at the top of}} the British rankings and was the second fastest time by a European sprinter in 2006.|$|E
5|$|The boy's {{mother said}} that the video <b>had</b> <b>helped</b> <b>him</b> {{to deal with his}} depression. After {{watching}} Capaldi's message, Ross Goodall stated that his son's behaviour patterns changed markedly. This change included the ability to comfort his sister and step out of his day-to-day routine. Ross Goodall said that after watching the video, his son smiled {{for the first time since}} his grandmother's death. The family framed the letter from Capaldi that came before the video message, and Ross Goodall said that Thomas looked at it when he felt distressed.|$|E
5|$|After {{years in}} {{opposition}} in the parliament, in September 1848, the Party of Order was called upon by PedroII {{to form a new}} cabinet. The saquarema cabinet was composed of men with whom Caxias had close relationships, among them Eusébio de Queirós, who <b>had</b> <b>helped</b> <b>him</b> bring order to the streets of Rio de Janeiro in the late 1830s. Caxias was now a wealthy planter who owned slaves and was {{very much a part of}} the landed aristocracy that formed the backbone of the Party of Order. With the help of his wealthy mother-in-law, he purchased his first property—a coffee farm—in 1838. He acquired more lands in 1849, further expanding his plantation. Due to growing international demand, coffee had become the most valuable export commodity for Brazil.|$|E

5|$|In this way, much to Metternich's {{disappointment}} and to Franz Josef's embarrassment, Austria began the Second Italian War of Independence against the combined forces of Piedmont-Sardinia and its ally France. Though Metternich {{was able to}} secure the replacement of Buol with his friend Rechberg, who <b>had</b> <b>helped</b> <b>him</b> so much in 1848, involvement in the war itself was now beyond his capacity. Even a special task given him by Franz Josef in June 1859—to draw up secret papers addressing the event of Franz Josef's death—was now too taxing. Shortly afterwards Metternich died in Vienna on 11 June 1859, aged 86, and the last great figure of his generation. Almost everyone of note in Vienna came to pay tribute; in the foreign press his death went virtually unnoticed.|$|E
5|$|Part of {{the reason}} for the inefficacy of the 1914 session was that McCreary was engaged in a {{three-way}} primary race for the Democratic nomination to the U.S. Senate. The other major candidates were former Governor Beckham and Augustus O. Stanley; a fourth candidate, David H. Smith, withdrew early from the race. McCreary ran a mostly positive campaign, touting his own accomplishments and speaking cordially about his opponents. Beckham and Stanley, however, were bitter political and personal enemies, and the campaign reflected their animosity. Without the support of Beckham's political machine that <b>had</b> <b>helped</b> <b>him</b> in the gubernatorial contest, McCreary never had a realistic chance to win the nomination. Beckham secured the nomination with 72,677 votes to Stanley's 65,871 and McCreary's 20,257.|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving the}} Air Force, Barr {{remained}} in Mildura with his wife, Dorothy (Dot). They had {{met on a}} blind date in 1938 and been married only a few weeks when Nicky joined the RAAF. During the war she was told on three occasions that her husband was dead. The couple had two sons, born in 1945 and 1947. Barr's injuries prevented him from returning to a rugby career, and he took up yachting as a sport. He also briefly assisted fellow No.3 Squadron veteran Bobby Gibbes in an airline venture in New Guinea, before going into business as a company manager and director with civil engineering and pharmaceutical firms. Barr rejoined the RAAF on 20March 1951 as a pilot in the active Citizen Air Force (CAF), with the acting rank of wing commander. On 15April 1953, he transferred to the CAF reserve. A member of the Royal Air Forces Escaping Society, Barr began travelling to Italy with his wife on a regular basis in the late 1950s to seek out and offer assistance to those who <b>had</b> <b>helped</b> <b>him</b> during his wartime escape attempts.|$|E

5|$|Uttanka then {{wondered}} {{whether he could}} reach his guru Veda's ashram {{to hand over the}} earrings to the guru's wife before the prescribed time. The rider, noting Uttanka's concern, gave Uttanka his horse, which took Uttanka to the ashram. He reached the ashram just before sunset as the guru's wife {{was in the process of}} casting a curse on Uttanka for not arriving in time. When Uttanka narrated his experience in procuring the earrings, the guru and his wife blessed him. Veda then explained to Uttanka the significance of the sights he had seen in Nagaloka. The two women engaged in weaving were Dhata and Vidhata; they were creating the world and all its creatures. The threads were day and night. The wheel with twelve spokes was the year with 360 days. The six boys were the seasons. The giant and bullock were Indra and his elephant Airavata. Its dung was amrita (elixir of life), which kept Uttanka alive in Nagaloka. The rider and horse in Nagaloka were Indra and the fire-god Agni. Veda also explained to Uttanka that his friend, Indra, <b>had</b> <b>helped</b> <b>him</b> during his journey.|$|E
5|$|By August 1967, Baer and Harrison had {{completed}} a third prototype machine, but {{had found that}} to even come near to Baer's initial aim of a US$20 or $25 console would require {{so much to be}} excluded that the resulting console would not be very enjoyable. Baer additionally felt that he was not proving successful at designing fun games for the system; to make up for this he formally added Bill Rusch, who <b>had</b> <b>helped</b> <b>him</b> come up with the initial games for the console, to the project. Though the pair found Rusch difficult to work with, he soon proved his value to the team by coming {{up with a way to}} display three spots on the screen at once rather than the previous two, and proposing the development of a ping pong game. By November the team, now on their fourth prototype machine, had a ping pong game, a chasing game, a light gun game, and three types of controllers: joysticks for the chase game, a rifle for the light gun game, and a three dial controller for the ping pong game. Campman felt that the system was advanced enough to begin trying to find a manufacturer to buy it; they had decided to aim for selling the rights to produce the console, as Sanders was not in the business of making and selling commercial electronics.|$|E
5|$|The strongest {{support for}} Diệm {{came from the}} Australian Catholic media. Diệm was a Catholic in a {{majority}} Buddhist country, and he had close religious links with the Vatican, who <b>had</b> <b>helped</b> <b>him</b> rise to power. He had stayed in a seminary run by Cardinal Francis Spellman in the United States in the early 1950s before his elevation to power. Diệm's elder brother Archbishop Ngô Đình Thục was the leading Catholic figure in Vietnam and a classmate of Spellman when the pair studied in Rome. Spellman was {{widely regarded as the}} most powerful Catholic figure in the United States and he helped to organise support for Diệm among American politicians, particularly Catholics. In 1957, Diệm dedicated his country to the Virgin Mary and ruled {{on the basis of a}} Catholic doctrine known as personalism. His younger brother Ngô Đình Nhu ran the secret and autocratic Catholic Cần Lao Party (Personalist Labor Party), which provided a clandestine network of support and police-state mechanisms to protect Diệm's rule. It counted many leading public servants and military officers among its members. Diệm also maintained land policies that were preferential to the Roman Catholic Church, the largest property owner in the country. Their holdings were exempt from redistribution under land reform schemes, while the construction of Buddhist temples was restricted; military and civil service promotions were given preferentially to Catholics. Some Catholic priests ran their own private armies and in some areas, forced conversions, looting, shelling and demolition of pagodas occurred.|$|E

5|$|To {{counteract}} {{the power of}} the Imperial Household Department and the Manchu nobility, in July 1653 the Shunzhi Emperor established the Thirteen Offices (十三衙門), or Thirteen Eunuch Bureaus, which were supervised by Manchus, but manned by Chinese eunuchs rather than Manchu bondservants. Eunuchs had been kept under tight control during Dorgon's regency, but the young emperor used them to counter the influence of other power centers such as his mother the Empress Dowager and former regent Jirgalang. By the late 1650s eunuch power became formidable again: they handled key financial and political matters, offered advice on official appointments, and even composed edicts. Because eunuchs isolated the monarch from the bureaucracy, Manchu and Chinese officials feared a return to the abuses of eunuch power that had plagued the late Ming. Despite the emperor's attempt to impose strictures on eunuch activities, the Shunzhi Emperor's favorite eunuch Wu Liangfu (吳良輔; d. 1661), who <b>had</b> <b>helped</b> <b>him</b> defeat the Dorgon faction in the early 1650s, was caught in a corruption scandal in 1658. The fact that Wu only received a reprimand for his accepting bribes did not reassure the Manchu elite, which saw eunuch power as a degradation of Manchu power. The Thirteen Offices would be eliminated (and Wu Liangfu executed) by Oboi and the other regents of the Kangxi Emperor in March 1661 soon after the Shunzhi Emperor's death.|$|E
25|$|Several factors {{underlay}} {{the termination}} of the longest period of peace the Eastern Roman and the Sassanid Empire ever enjoyed. The Persian king Kavadh I needed money to pay his debts to the Hephthalites who <b>had</b> <b>helped</b> <b>him</b> regain his throne in 498/499. The situation was exacerbated by recent changes {{in the flow of}} the Tigris in lower Mesopotamia, sparking famines and flood. When the Roman emperor Anastasius I refused to provide any help, Kavadh tried to gain the money by force.|$|E
25|$|The Anglo-Saxon rulers paid large sums, Danegelds, to Vikings, who mostly {{came from}} Denmark (but many also from Sweden) and who arrived to the English shores during the 990s {{and the first}} decades of the 11th century. Some runestones relate of these Danegelds, such as the Yttergärde runestone, U 344, which tells of Ulf of Borresta who {{received}} the danegeld three times, and the last one he received from Canute the Great. Canute sent home most of the Vikings who <b>had</b> <b>helped</b> <b>him</b> conquer England, but he kept a strong bodyguard, the Þingalið, and its members are also mentioned on several runestones.|$|E

25|$|A manhunt for {{the other}} two {{suspects}} was conducted throughout the night and into the next day, when police located the two remaining suspects, who had been hiding in the woods; they were arrested without incident. The shootout between Lopez and the gunman had been videotaped by a camera in Lopez's cruiser. After the incident, Lopez told authorities that he believed the video of Lunsford's murder is what had saved his life that night. The video <b>had</b> <b>helped</b> <b>him</b> deal with the three suspects and he had learned {{not to make the}} same mistakes that Lunsford had made eight months earlier. For his actions, Trooper Lopez was awarded the Texas Department of Public Safety Medal of Valor, the highest award a commissioned trooper can receive.|$|E
25|$|Arlott {{was married}} three times - first to Dawn Rees (married 18 May 1940 – {{divorced}} 1958); {{they had two}} sons, James Andrew (1944–1965) and Timothy Mark (born 1950). His second marriage was to Valerie France (married July 1960 – died 1976) with a third son Robert, (born 1963). His third marriage was to Patricia Hoare (6 April 1977 – 1991) who survived him. Arlott's eldest son Jim {{was killed in a}} car accident on New Year's Eve 1965, driving home late at night from Southampton in a sports car which Arlott <b>had</b> <b>helped</b> <b>him</b> acquire.
