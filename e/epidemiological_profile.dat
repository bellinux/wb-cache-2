50|$|In Guatemala, {{communicable}} diseases for which treatment exists are {{still one of}} the major causes of death. Wealthy, more industrialized developed nations have been able to eliminate {{communicable diseases}} due to an epidemiological transition, in which death rates due to degenerative diseases have surpassed those of communicable and infectious diseases. The opposite is apparent in Guatemala. The high mortality rate for infants {{is a direct result of}} communicable and infectious diseases. Similarly, the <b>epidemiological</b> <b>profile</b> of Guatemala shows that some of the most prevalent infectious diseases, like diarrhea and acute respiratory infections, are a direct result of poverty. In Guatemala, 56 percent of the population lives below the poverty line. Poverty levels are greatest in the indigenous communities of Guatemala, which account for about 81 percent of those living in poverty, and make up about 43 percent of Guatemala's total population. High levels of poverty make the population more vulnerable to communicable diseases, which is why government funding of health care is necessary for the rural areas of Guatemala.|$|E

We describe a set of existing computational techniques that might improve our understanding of the dynamics within individual cells along with its <b>epidemiological</b> <b>profiling.</b> While HIV-contaminated cell mathematical modeling leads to constantly improved models, the study of the social spread of the disease will hopefully lead to ad-hoc regional and global policies for its control. Some mathematical models and their corresponding proven computer implementation, with their mutual interactions, are discussed and integrated within a coherent framework allowing their cross-comparison through an information-theoretic meta-model...|$|R

40|$|Context: It is {{well-known}} that every health problem, not only presents itself with different <b>epidemiological</b> <b>profiles</b> in different population settings, {{but is also}} perceived and managed differently. Having knowledge of these variations in its presentations and perceptions in different population settings, for example, in urban and rural settings, will be useful for its successful management. Aim: To study differences in <b>epidemiological</b> <b>profiles,</b> perceptions, socio economic losses, and quality-of-life losses and management of dysmenorrhoea in different settings for effective management. Design and Setting: A comparative cross-sectional study among adolescent school girls (101 girls in urban areas and 79 girls in rural areas) {{in the district of}} Karimnagar. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional survey using a pretested questionnaire was conducted among 180 adolescent girls in urban and rural settings. Statistical Analyses Used: Proportions and X 2 test. Results: The prevalence of dysmenorrhoea is 54 &#x 0025; (53 &#x 0025; in girls in urban areas and 56 &#x 0025; in girls in rural areas) (X 2 df = 0. 1, P = 0. 05). Sickness absenteeism (28 - 48 &#x 0025;), socio economic losses, and perceived quality of life losses are more prevalent among girls in urban areas than in girls in rural areas. Girls in rural areas resort to physical labor and other natural methods to obtain relief while the girls in urban areas are mainly depending on medications.

Few studies report clinical and <b>epidemiological</b> <b>profiles</b> regarding {{the experience of}} referral services. Objective To describe clinical characteristics of a non-traumatic myelopathy cohort.
