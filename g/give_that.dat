5|$|The {{first pick}} in Toronto Raptors' history was Damon Stoudamire, {{a point guard}} from the University of Arizona, who was the seventh overall pick in the 1995 NBA draft. People in the crowd were {{surprised}} by this pick because they expected the Raptors to pick Ed O'Bannon from UCLA. In their second pick of the same draft, Fab Five member Jimmy King from Michigan was drafted in the second round. The Raptors won the first overall pick in 1996, {{but they had to}} <b>give</b> <b>that</b> up due to the expansion agreement with the league. Chris Bosh was selected by the Raptors as the fourth pick overall in the 2003 NBA draft, and he went on to play in three all-star games, while starting in two. Andrea Bargnani, who was selected by the Raptors with the first overall pick of the 2006 NBA draft, became the first European to be picked first overall in the NBA draft.|$|E
5|$|The {{inauguration of}} the first Whig {{president}} would <b>give</b> <b>that</b> party the opportunity to fill federal jobs for the first time. This proved complicated, and Harrison was called to Washington in mid-January, nearly two months before his March 4, 1841 inaugural date, to be at hand. He made a very public progress from Ohio to Washington, getting little rest along the way: even those Whigs who were not seeking government employment wanted to see and meet the President-elect and celebrations often surrounded his hotel all night. He reached Washington on February 9, his 68th birthday. After consultation with Whig politicians, he filled his cabinet, to the disappointment of some, like Henry Clay, who saw his nominees passed over, and Thaddeus Stevens, who believed he had been promised the position of Postmaster General.|$|E

He argues that this corresponds to the period when games played on computers and arcade machines became ‘video (or computer) games’ in the sense we <b>give</b> <b>that</b> phrase today. As a social group formed in connection with the activity of playing the games, 'gamers' produced their own lexicon of game evaluation and appraisal, and their expectations and preferences shaped the subsequent development of gaming as a cultural practice.|$|E

However, Wardell's work was more than the design of two cathedrals, his work was versatile and skilful in both the Gothic and classical styles and has given both Sydney and Melbourne some of their most distinguished 19th-century buildings.|$|E

He was determined to place this industry on a solid foundation providing it a 'conceptional base and institutional support.' This was necessary to bring dynamism and cohesiveness into an industry, shunned by leaders in the past, ignored by investors who were inhibited {{by the lack of}} incentive to invest in projects which were uncertain of a satisfactory return. The new Minister Hon. J. R.

25|$|Furman {{may have}} been the most {{successful}} coach in the history of chess, although some would <b>give</b> <b>that</b> title to Mark Dvoretsky. Chess culture has traditionally and typically credited the player for chess success, with the coach recognized in a much lesser fashion, or not at all. Chess coaches were not commonly seen for top players until the post-World War II period, when competition became much stiffer. They were first developed in the Soviet Union and in other Eastern European countries; {{it is no coincidence that}} top players from these nations have dominated chess for the past sixty years. Furman, with a very significant role in Karpov's development from his late teens, building upon earlier roles with World Champion Botvinnik and world-class players such as Bronstein, Korchnoi, and Geller, may have done more than any other coach, from the early 1950s until the late 1970s, to help ensure Soviet dominance.|$|E

Previously, since the field runs east–west (rather than north–south {{as is the case}} in most other stadiums), the north stands were exposed to the full force of South Florida's oppressive heat early in the season. The issue became so problematic that Stephen Ross, who owns the Dolphins and the stadium, successfully petitioned the NFL to have all September home games start at 4 pm.

25|$|Returning {{home for}} their final home {{series of the}} regular season, the Blue Jays battled the Red Sox for 3 games. Marcus Stroman made his first home start in 2015, holding the Red Sox to 1 run over 7 innings in the first game, which Toronto won 6–1. The win gave Toronto a 4-game lead in their division, however they would <b>give</b> <b>that</b> game back the {{following}} day, losing 7–6 to Boston, coupled with the Yankees defeating the Mets. The Blue Jays led the game 4–2, heading into the ninth inning, however Roberto Osuna and Aaron Sanchez would combine to give up 5 runs to the Red Sox. In {{the bottom of the}} ninth, Jose Bautista hit a 2-run home run, however the comeback would fall short. The Blue Jays would lose another game off their division lead in the rubber match, losing 4–3 to Boston after committing 3 errors. Following their series loss to Boston, the Blue Jays faced the Yankees for the final time in the 2015 regular season. Toronto would take the first game, 4–2, after another quality start from David Price. Losing 3–2 in the ninth inning of the second game, Dioner Navarro hit a solo home run to tie the game. The Blue Jays would load the bases later in the inning, but were unable to score the winning run. In the top of the tenth, the Yankees scored 3 runs off a home run by Greg Bird, and the Blue Jays would go on to lose the game 6–4. In the final game, Toronto and New York battled to a scoreless tie through the first 5 innings. In the bottom of the sixth, Kevin Pillar broke the tie with an RBI single, and the Blue Jays took a 1–0 lead. In the seventh, Russell Martin hit a 3-run home run to lead Toronto to a 4–0 victory. Marcus Stroman earned his third win in as many starts, pitching 7 shutout innings against the Yankees and lowering his ERA to 1.89. Toronto's last 3 regular season home games would be played against the Rays. R.A. Dickey started {{the first game of the}} series and earned his 100th career win, 5–3 over Tampa Bay. The win also clinched a postseason berth for the Blue Jays, their first since the 1993 season. The second game featured a match between former Rays ace David Price and current ace Chris Archer, who was mentored by Price early in his career. Though many had thought the game would be a pitcher's duel, the two combined to allow 14 runs through the first 4 innings, with Toronto eventually coming out on top, 10–8. The Blue Jays would complete the sweep, winning the final game of the series 5–4 thanks to Josh Donaldson's franchise record third walk-off home run of the season.|$|E
