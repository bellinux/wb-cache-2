Production of TSH by the anterior pituitary gland is stimulated in turn by thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), released from the hypothalamus.

25|$|A natural {{development}} from digital delay-processing hardware was {{the appearance of}} software-based delay systems. In large part, this coincided with the popularity of both professional and consumer audio editing software. Software delays, in many cases, offer much greater flexibility than even the most recent digital hardware delays. Abundant system memory on modern personal computers offers practically limitless storage for the audio buffer, and the natural efficiency of audio delay algorithms has made the implementation trivial for delays offering shifting or random delay times, or the insertion of other audio effects during the <b>feedback</b> <b>process.</b> Many authors of software plugins have added functionality to emulate {{the sounds of the}} earlier analog units.|$|E

25|$|In the 1880s Meucci was {{credited}} with the early invention of inductive loading of telephone wires to increase long-distance signals. Unfortunately, serious burns from an accident, a lack of English, and poor business abilities resulted in Meucci's failing to develop his inventions commercially in America. Meucci demonstrated some sort of instrument in 1849 in Havana, Cuba, however, {{this may have been}} a variant of a string telephone that used wire. Meucci has been further credited with the invention of an anti-sidetone circuit. However, examination showed that his solution to sidetone was to maintain two separate telephone circuits and thus use twice as many transmission wires. The anti-sidetone circuit later introduced by Bell Telephone instead canceled sidetone through a <b>feedback</b> <b>process.</b>|$|E
25|$|At {{high speeds}} U, the flow is {{turbulent}} {{and in some}} studies the speed can be supersonic and the sound generated can be quite high level. One study has shown that several modes of oscillation (stages) can occur in a shallow cavity; the modes being related {{to the number of}} vortices in the distance L. For shorter cavities and lower Mach numbers, there is a shear-layer mode, while for longer cavities and higher Mach numbers there is a wake mode. The shear-layer mode is characterized well by the <b>feedback</b> <b>process</b> described by Rossiter. The wake mode is characterized instead by a large-scale vortex shedding with a Strouhal number independent of Mach number. There is an empirical equation for these data; it is called Rossiter’s formula.|$|E
25|$|In one case, a {{boy with}} H5N1 {{experienced}} diarrhea followed rapidly by a coma without developing respiratory or flu-like symptoms. There have been studies of the levels of cytokines in humans infected by the H5N1 flu virus. Of particular concern is elevated levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, a protein associated with tissue destruction at sites of infection and increased production of other cytokines. Flu virus-induced increases {{in the level of}} cytokines is also associated with flu symptoms, including fever, chills, vomiting and headache. Tissue damage associated with pathogenic flu virus infection can ultimately result in death. The inflammatory cascade triggered by H5N1 has been called a 'cytokine storm' by some, because of {{what seems to be a}} positive <b>feedback</b> <b>process</b> of damage to the body resulting from immune system stimulation. H5N1 induces higher levels of cytokines than the more common flu virus types.|$|E

40|$|Energetic {{feedback}} from supernovae (SNe) and from active galactic nuclei (AGN) are both important {{processes that are}} thought to control how much gas is able to condense into galaxies and form stars. We show that although both AGN and SNe suppress star formation, they mutually weaken one another's effect by up to {{an order of magnitude}} in haloes in the mass range for which both <b>feedback</b> <b>processes</b> are efficient (). These results demonstrate the importance of the simultaneous, non-independent inclusion of these two processes in models of galaxy formation to estimate the total feedback strength.

40|$|This article aims {{to review}} {{literature}} on feedback to teachers. Because research has hardly focused on feedback among teachers, the review’s scope also includes feedback in classrooms. The review proposes that {{the effectiveness of}} <b>feedback</b> and <b>feedback</b> <b>processes</b> depend on the learning theory adhered to. Findings show that regardless of the learning theory effective feedback is goal- or task-directed, specific, and neutral. In addition, four rules of thumb were formulated that reflect what a majority of learning theories suggested as effective for learning. Finally, some feedback characteristics were considered effective from only one learning theory. The article shows that <b>feedback</b> <b>processes</b> are complicated and many variables influence and mediate the processes. Most reviewed studies did not investigate the whole <b>feedback</b> <b>processes,</b> and therefore, we suggest that future {{research is needed to}} further understand feedback...|$|R
25|$|Computers {{have been}} playing an {{increasing}} role in PA for some time (Sulsky & Keown, 1998). There are two main aspects to this. The first is {{in relation to the}} electronic monitoring of performance, which affords the ability to record a huge amount of data on multiple dimensions of work performance (Stanton, 2000). Not only does it facilitate a more continuous and detailed collection of performance data in some jobs, e.g. call centres, but it has the capacity to do so in a non-obvious, covert manner. The second aspect is in mediating the <b>feedback</b> <b>process,</b> by recording and aggregating performance ratings and written observations and making the information available on-line; many software packages are available for this. The use of IT in these ways undoubtedly helps in making the appraisal process more manageable, especially where multiple rating sources are involved, but it also raises many questions about appraisees' reactions and possible effects on PA outcomes. Mostly, the evidence so far is positive.|$|E
500|$|The {{passage of}} a {{tropical}} cyclone over the ocean causes the upper layers of the ocean to cool substantially, which can influence subsequent cyclone development. This cooling is primarily caused by wind-driven mixing of cold water from deeper in the ocean with the warm surface waters. This effect results in a negative <b>feedback</b> <b>process</b> that can inhibit further development or lead to weakening. [...] Additional cooling may {{come in the form}} of cold water from falling raindrops (this is because the atmosphere is cooler at higher altitudes). Cloud cover may also play a role in cooling the ocean, by shielding the ocean surface from direct sunlight before and slightly after the storm passage. All these effects can combine to produce a dramatic drop in sea surface temperature over a large area in just a few days.|$|E

40|$|Palaeo {{data have}} been {{frequently}} {{used to determine}} the equilibrium (Charney) climate sensitivity S^a, and - if slow <b>feedback</b> <b>processes</b> (e. g. land ice-albedo) are adequately taken into account - they indicate a similar range as estimates based on instrumental data and climate model results.

Here we assess the dependency of the fast <b>feedback</b> <b>processes</b> on the background climate state using data of the last 800 kyr and a conceptual climate model for interpretation. Applying a new method to account for background state dependency, we find S^a= 0. 61 ± 0. 06 K(Wm^- 2) ^- 1 using the latest LGM temperature reconstruction and significantly lower climate sensitivity during glacial climates. Due to uncertainties in reconstructing the LGM temperature anomaly, S^a is estimated in the range S^a= 0. 55 - 0. 95 K(Wm^- 2) ^- 1. Comment: submitted to Geophysical Research Letter...|$|R
2500|$|In {{the case}} of communication, an {{important}} discussion by John Krebs and Richard Dawkins established hypotheses {{for the evolution of}} such apparently altruistic or mutualistic communications as alarm calls and courtship signals to emerge under individual selection.
