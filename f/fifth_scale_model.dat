40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a completely new}} design of a bogie-frame made of glass fibre reinforced composites and its performance under various loading conditions predicted by finite element analysis. The bogie consists of two frames, with one placed {{on top of the}} other, and two axle ties connecting the axles. Each frame consists of two side arms and a transom between. The top frame is thinner and more compliant and has a higher curvature compared with the bottom frame. Variable vertical stiffness can be achieved before and after the contact between the two frames at the central section of the bogie to cope with different load levels. Finite element analysis played a very important role in the design of this structure. Stiffness and stress levels of the full scale bogie presented in this paper under various loading conditions have been predicted by using Marc provided by MSC Software. In order to verify the finite element analysis (FEA) <b>models,</b> a <b>fifth</b> <b>scale</b> prototype of the bogie has been made and tested under quasi-static loading conditions. Results of testing on the <b>fifth</b> <b>scale</b> bogie have been used to fine tune details like contact and friction in the <b>fifth</b> <b>scale</b> FEA <b>models.</b> These conditions were then applied to the full <b>scale</b> <b>models.</b> Finite element analysis results show that the stress levels in all directions are low compared with material strengths...|$|R
40|$|When {{partially}} closed, {{steam turbine}} governing valves rely on flow {{separation from the}} valve head and seat to generate loss and throttle the flow. The aim {{of this type of}} valve is to avoid separation and therefore eliminate loss when the valve is fully open, and to have stable and controllable separations at all other valve lifts. Any significant unsteadiness in the valve flow can result in unacceptable mechanical vibration of the valve, which in extreme cases can lead to failure.;Results will be discussed from work that has been undertaken into valve flow instabilities at Leicester University Engineering Department in collaboration with Alstom Energy Ltd. At high lifts, the Mach number of the steam flow between the head and the seat is sufficiently low for the fluid to be considered as incompressible. Water was therefore used as the working fluid in the tests at Leicester to model accurately the flow in a <b>fifth</b> <b>scale</b> acrylic <b>model</b> valve under high lift conditions. Results from laser light sheet visualisation, Particle Image Velocimetry and transient pressure measurements of the valve flow are presented.;Laser light sheet illumination and high-speed Cine photography have been used to visualise the highly three dimensional valve flow. A range of valve head geometries has been tested. The results of the flow visualisation show the presence of stable and unstable separation zones and their influence on the valve flow. Particle Image Velocimetry has provided quantitative information on these features. Methods for stabilising the separation zones by modifying the valve head and seat have also been investigated and the results from these tests have shown improvements in reducing valve exit pipe unsteadiness...|$|R

Then, the scaling factor of external force (i. e., torque) required for the torsional forced vibration problems is determined based on the Newton’s second law. Numerical results show that the torsional free and forced vibration characteristics of a full-size rotor-shaft system can be accurately predicted from those of its <b>scale</b> <b>models</b> by using the foregoing scaling factors. For this reason, it is believed that the presented approach will be significant for investigating the relevant phenomenon in the <b>scale</b> <b>model</b> tests.
