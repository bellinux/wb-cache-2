40|$|We report {{here two}} cases of priapism. One {{of these cases}} was {{suspected}} to be drug induced and high and low flow mixed type. The patient had taken the drugs, alpha-blocker for hypertension and dysuria by BPH for a long time. He was treated by a caveno-glandular shunt. After surgery, detumescence was obtained for some time, but erection appeared again soon. Transcatheter embolization of the <b>internal</b> <b>pudendal</b> <b>arteries</b> was then performed, and detumescence became permanent. The other case was an idiopathic and high flow type.

40|$|Objective To compare {{computed}} tomography (CT) angiography (CTA) obtained by multi-slice CT (a new minimally invasive method) {{with the current}} standard of arterial imaging, digital subtraction angiography (DSA), in diagnosing arteriogenic erectile dysfunction (ED). Patients and methods Twenty-one patients with suspected arteriogenic ED underwent DSA and CTA after providing informed consent. Prostaglandin E 1 was injected into the penile cavernosal body and then non-ionic contrast medium was rapidly infused into the antecubital vein. The DSA and CTA images were diagnosed as showing a normal or abnormal status by three reviewers independently. CTA was undertaken on an outpatient basis but DSA required hospitalization. Results In the 42 <b>internal</b> <b>pudendal</b> <b>arteries,</b> DSA showed 28 normal and 14 impaired arteries; CTA showed 21 normal arteries and 21 occlusions. The CTA image correlated closely with the diagnosis of stenosis or occlusion in <b>internal</b> <b>pudendal</b> <b>arteries,</b> with a sensitivity of 93 %, a specificity of 71 % and an accuracy of 79 %. In the cavernosal arteries, DSA depicted 14 normal and 28 impaired arteries; CTA showed seven normal arteries and 35 occlusions. The CTA image agreed closely with the diagnosis of stenosis or occlusion in cavernosal arteries, with a sensitivity of 96 %, a specificity of 43 % and an accuracy of 79 %. Of the 42 inferior epigastric arteries, DSA could not depict 11 arteries but CTA showed all 42 inferior epigastric arteries. Conclusions CTA images correlated with DSA images; at present DSA is better than CTA in visualizing stenosis in fine arteries. However, CTA is less invasive and relatively inexpensive, and in future will probably provide even greater improvements in graphic quality. CTA would be an adequate replacement for DSA in evaluating <b>internal</b> <b>pudendal</b> arterial stenosis...|$|R

40|$|Androgen {{deficiency}} {{is strongly}} associated with erectile dysfunction (ED). Inadequate penile arterial blood flow {{is one of the}} major causes of ED. The blood flow to the corpus cavernosum is mainly derived from the <b>internal</b> <b>pudendal</b> <b>arteries</b> (IPAs); however, no study has evaluated the effects of androgen deprivation on IPA′s function. We hypothesized that castration impairs IPAs reactivity and structure, contributing to ED. In our study, Wistar male rats, 8 -week-old, were castrated and studied 30 days after orchiectomy. Functional and structural properties of rat IPAs were determined using wire and pressure myograph systems, respectively. Protein expression was determined by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. Plasma testosterone levels were determined using the IMMULITE 1000 Immunoassay System. Castrated rats exhibited impaired erectile function, represented by decreased intracavernosal pressure/mean arterial pressure ratio. IPAs from castrated rats exhibited decreased phenylephrine- and electrical field stimulation (EFS) -induced contraction and decreased acetylcholine- and EFS-induced vasodilatation. IPAs from castrated rats exhibited decreased internal diameter, external diameter, thickness of the arterial wall, and cross-sectional area. Castration decreased nNOS and α-actin expression and increased collagen expression, p 38 (Thr 180 /Tyr 182) phosphorylation, as well as caspase 3 cleavage. In conclusion, androgen deficiency is associated with impairment of IPA reactivity and structure and increased apoptosis signaling markers. Our findings suggest that androgen deficiency-induced vascular dysfunction is an event involving hypotrophic vascular remodeling of IPAs...|$|R

40|$|Oxidative stress {{plays an}} {{important}} role in diabetes mellitus (DM) –associated vascular injury. DM is an important risk factor for erectile dysfunction. Functional and structural changes in <b>internal</b> <b>pudendal</b> <b>arteries</b> (IPA) can lead to erectile dysfunction. We hypothesized that downregulation of nuclear factor E 2 –related factor 2 (Nrf 2), consequent to increased nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase 1 (NOX 1) -derived reactive oxygen species (ROS), impairs IPA function in DM. IPA and vascular smooth muscle cells from C 57 BL/ 6 (control) and NOX 1 knockout mice were used. DM was induced by streptozotocin in C 57 BL/ 6 mice. Functional properties of IPA were assessed using a myograph, protein expression and peroxiredoxin oxidation by Western blot, RNA expression by polymerase chain reaction, carbonylation by oxyblot assay, ROS generation by lucigenin, nitrotyrosine, and amplex red, and Rho kinase activity and nuclear accumulation of Nrf 2 by ELISA. IPA from diabetic mice displayed increased contractions to phenylephrine (control 138. 5 ± 9. 5 versus DM 191. 8 ± 15. 5). ROS scavenger, Nrf 2 activator, NOX 1 and Rho kinase inhibitors normalized vascular function. High glucose increased ROS generation in IPA vascular smooth muscle cell. This effect was abrogated by Nrf 2 activation and not observed in NOX 1 knockout vascular smooth muscle cell. High glucose also increased levels of nitrotyrosine, protein oxidation/carbonylation, and Rho kinase activity, but reduced Nrf 2 activity and expression of Nrf 2 -regulated genes (catalase [25. 6 ± 0. 05 %], heme oxygenase- 1 [21 ± 0. 1 %], and NAD(P) H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 [22 ± 0. 1 %]) and hydrogen peroxide levels. These effects were not observed in vascular smooth muscle cell from NOX 1 knockout mice. In these cells, high glucose increased hydrogen peroxide levels. In conclusion, Rho kinase activation, via NOX 1 -derived ROS and downregulation of Nrf 2 system, impairs IPA function in DM. These data suggest that Nrf 2 is vasoprotective in DM-associated erectile dysfunction...|$|R

40|$|Impotence is {{a common}} problem that has great impact {{on the quality of}} life. Clinical {{evaluation}} usually can exclude endocrinologic imbalance, neurogenic dysfunction, and psychological problems as the etiology. A patient who fails to get an erection after vasoactive medications which are injected probably, has hemodynamic impotence. Dynamic studies that include imaging techniques are now available to discriminate between arterial and venous pathology. Doppler ultrasound with color flow and spectral analysis,dynamic infusion corpus cavernosometry and cavernosography, and selective <b>internal</b> <b>pudendal</b> arteriography are outpatient diagnostic procedures that will differentiate, image and quantify the abnormalities in patients with hemodynamic impotence. Not all tests are needed in every patient. Each of these examinations is preceded with the intracavernosal injection of vasoactive medication. Papaverine hydrochloride, phentolamine mesylate, or prostaglandin El will overcome normal sympathetic tone and produce an erection by smooth muscle relaxation and arterial dilatation in a normal patient. Color-flow Doppler and spectral analysis will showthe cavernosal arteries and can identify the hemodynamic effects of stricture or occlusion. Peak systolic velocity is measured. Normal ranges are well established. Spectral analysis also is used to predict the presence of venous disease. Sizable venous leaks in the dorsal penile vein are readily imaged. While the technique may not adequately identify low-grade venous pathology, it will identify the size and location of fibrous plaque formation associated with Peyronie's disease. Cavernosography or cavernosometry is a separate procedure that will quantitate the severity of venousincompetence as well as specifically identify the various avenues of systemic venous return that must be localized if venous occlusive therapy is chosen. In this study, the peak arterial systolic occlusion pressure is quantified during erection,and the presence of arterial pathology can be confirmed. The arterial data are not as reliable as the ultrasound-obtained data because they rely on audible Doppler, which can be obscured in the underlying "noise" heard with erection. The arterial data obtained with both of these examinations are quantitative and replace the qualitative audible Doppler used previously. Specialized equipment allows dynamic data acquisition, ensuring that the needed information is obtained at peak stimulation. Arteriography is done only if reconstructive surgery is contemplated. The examination includes subselective catheterization of the <b>internal</b> <b>pudendal</b> <b>arteries,</b> magnification technique, and evaluation of the recurrent epigastric arteries, which will be harvested for revascularization. An arterial operation is usually successful in younger patients with perineal trauma with a single point of stenosis or occlusion but has been least successful in those patients with atherosclerosis because of the multifocal nature of this disease. Diagnostic information available today is more specific and reliable {{than at any time in}} the past and can realistically estimate the severity of the hemodynamic disorder and allow individual treatment options. Ongoing studies will show whether the data these studies provide make an important difference in the treatment of vascular impotence...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of the superficial external <b>pudendal</b> <b>artery</b> in cases of lower limb obstructive arteriopathies has been established, and a perfect knowledge of its anatomy is desirable {{for the creation of}} successful flaps involving it. However, little information is available on the morphometry of this artery. PURPOSE: In this study, we conducted a quantitative investigation of the superficial external <b>pudendal</b> <b>artery</b> as the basis for skin grafts. METHOD: Twenty-five right and left sides of the inguinal region of male cadavers were dissected. After retracting the skin at the inguinal region, the femoral vessels and the sapheno-femoral junction were exposed. The following aspects were then analyzed: 1) the presence of the superficial external <b>pudendal</b> <b>artery,</b> 2) the place of origin of the superficial external <b>pudendal</b> <b>artery</b> and the common trunk, 3) the duplication of the superficial external <b>pudendal</b> <b>artery,</b> 4) the distance from the superficial external <b>pudendal</b> <b>artery</b> or the common trunk to the inguinal ligament, and 5) the diameter of the superficial external <b>pudendal</b> <b>artery.</b> RESULTS: The results were the following: 1) superficial external <b>pudendal</b> <b>arteries</b> were found in 46 of 50 sides (92 %); 2) they originated from the femoral artery in 45 cases and from the deep femoral artery in only 1 case; 3) the arteries were found duplicated in 21 cases (46 %), as a common trunk in 11 cases (24 %), and as a single artery in 14 cases (30 %); 4) the distance from the superficial external <b>pudendal</b> <b>artery</b> to the inguinal ligament ranged from 0. 8 cm to 8. 5 cm; from the common trunk, it ranged from 3. 5 cm to 6. 7 cm; 5) the diameter of the superficial external <b>pudendal</b> <b>artery</b> ranged from 1. 2 mm to 3. 8 mm; and 6) the diameter of the common trunk ranged from 1. 35 mm to 5. 15 mm. CONCLUSION: The results show that the superficial external <b>pudendal</b> <b>artery</b> generally originates from the femoral artery.
