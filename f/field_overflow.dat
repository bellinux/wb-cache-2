40|$|The {{origin of}} water feeding large aufeis <b>fields</b> (<b>overflow</b> river ice) on the Arctic Slope of Alaska is analyzed. Field {{measurements}} of two large aufeis fields {{on the eastern}} Arctic Slope were taken during July of 1978 and 1979. Measurements of aufeis extent and distribution were made using LANDSAT Multispectral Scanner Subsystem (MSS) satellite data from 1973 through 1979. In addition, ice cores were analyzed in the laboratory. Results {{of the field and}} laboratory studies indicate that the water derived from aufeis melt water has a chemical composition different from the adjacent upstream river water. Large aufeis fields are found in association with springs and faults thus indicating a subterranean origin of the feed water. In addition, the maximum extent of large aufeis fields was not found to follow meteorological patterns which would only be expected if the origin of the feed water were local. It is concluded that extent of large aufeis in a given river channel on the Arctic Slope is controlled by discharge from reservoirs of groundwater. It seems probable that precipitation passes into limestone aquifers in the Brooks Range, through an interconnecting system of subterranean fractures in calcareous rocks and ultimately discharges into alluvial sediments on the coastal plain to form aufeis. It is speculated that only small aufeis patches are affected by local meteorological parameters in the months just prior to aufeis formation...|$|R

40|$|Soil-water {{conditions}} for ricefields located in valleys in micro-catchments are simulated using a daily soil-water balance model. The crop is primarily rainfed {{but there is}} also limited irrigation water. The simulation covers a complete year and includes features such as rainfall, irrigation releases, runoff from uplands, actual evaporation and evapotranspiration, percolation losses through the bed and bunds of the ricefield, standing water in the <b>field</b> and <b>overflows</b> from the ricefield. A specific location in Sri Lanka is selected to illustrate the approach. The impacts of different conditions are explored including alternative irrigation releases, increased losses through the bed and bunds of the ricefield and a lower overflow from the ricefield. Simulations indicate that ricefields which are towards the valley sides have an increased inflow due to runoff from adjacent uplands; this can lead to improved rice yields. However, reducing heights of the bunds to half the original value results in substantial overflows during periods of high rainfall while the number of days without submergence almost doubles. This uncomplicated model is consistent with the limited field data and information available; it provides a realistic representation of the important processes and indicates why poor crop yields often occur. ...|$|R

40|$|Results from a {{high-resolution}} (∼ 2 km) {{numerical simulation}} of the Irminger Basin during Summer 2003 are presented. The {{focus is on}} the East Greenland Spill Jet, a recently-discovered component of the circulation in the basin. The simulation compares well with observations of surface <b>fields,</b> Denmark Strait <b>Overflow</b> (DSO) and the hydrographic struc-ture of typical sections in the basin. The model reveals new aspects of the circulation on scales of O(0. 1 − 10) days and O(1 − 100) km. The model Spill Jet results from the cascade of dense waters over the East Greenland shelf. Spilling can occur in various locations southwest of the Strait and it is present through-out the simulation, but exhibits large variations on periods of O(0. 1 − 10) days. The Spill Jet sometimes cannot be distinguished in the velocity field from surface eddies or from the DSO. The vorticity structure of the Jet confirms its unstable nature with peak relative and tilting vorticity terms reaching twice the planetary vorticity term.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to assess turbulence modeling issues for rocket plumes with application to the Orion Launch Abort System (LAS). Turbulence models, used with the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations, are critically important for an accurate flow <b>field</b> prediction. NASA’s <b>OVERFLOW</b> code is used for computations of supersonic jets. First, baseline turbulence performance is assessed. Then, corrections for compressibility, temperature, and rotation/curvature effects are evaluated based on comparisons with experimental data. Test cases progressively increase in complexity and include axisymmetric jets, 3 -D jets with crossflow, and a full ”LAS-like” configuration. For the axisymmetric jets, the test cases are isothermal and heated, perfectly expanded and underexpanded axisymmetric jets with design Mach numbers around two. The 3 -D jet in crossflow is based on a NASA Glenn experiment and includes elevated conditions (higher Mach numbers and temperatures) more similar to the actual LAS. ^ The SST turbulence model shows the best performance and is chosen for the flows examined in this study. For the axisymmetric jet, results demonstrate that using a compressibility correction is important for a good prediction of the jet development. The temperature correction shows improved results for the heated cases, but its effect is not as significant. For the 3 -D jet in crossflow, conclusions from using corrections are not as decisive. While use of the compressibility correction improves the vorticity contours shape, the velocity decay is slightly underpredicted. The temperature and rotation/curvature corrections show little improvement. The overall recommendation is that the corrections must be used with caution, especially when approaching high temperature and high Mach number regimes. ^ Finally, two modified compressibility correction are introduced based on the notion that the growth rate in compressible free shear flows levels off at a certain turbulence Mach number. The modified corrections do not disturb the beneficial behavior of the standard corrections observed for the axisymmetric jets at the given conditions. For the 3 -D jet in crossflow, the modified corrections show significant improvement over the Sarkar and uncorrected models. The compressible boundary layer test case shows that there is still an underprediction of the wall skin friction coefficient, but this can be solved by using a simple modification in the turbulence model. Finally, analysis of the compressible mixing layer shows that the modified corrections exhibit the correct trend in limiting the growth rate, but do not match exactly with the experimentally-obtained results. ...|$|R
40|$|Side weirs, {{also known}} as a lateral weirs, and {{overflow}} dams are free overflow regulation and diversion devices commonly encountered in hydraulic engineering. They are set into the side of a channel or river allowing to spill a part of the discharge over their crest when the surface of the flow in the main-channel exceeds a certain level. The lateral loss of water is reducing the sediment transport capacity in the main-channel yielding to aggradation and the formation of a local sediment deposit in the downstream weir alignment. The reduced cross section generates backwater effects and additional contraction and expansion losses. As a consequence, the head over the side weir rises and the side overflow discharge as well. The design discharge to be diverted over the weir is increased by this flow-sediment transport interaction. Since the interaction of side overflow with bed-load and bed morphology in a channel has not been studied so far, systematic tests have been performed. Three test series and one reference experiment without side weir have been carried out in a 20. 00 m long, 1. 50 m wide and 1. 20 m high rectangular flume. The first test series consisted of a 3. 00 m long side weir, the second one had a 6. 00 m long weir and the third series was characterised by two weirs of 2. 50 m length each. The approach discharge varied between 0. 098 m 3 /s ≤ Q 1 ≤ 0. 222 m 3 /s. The overall flow regime has been subcritical. The average initial bottom slope was 0. 21 %. The mobile bed was characterized by a median particle size of d 50 = 0. 72 mm. During the experiments the water surface, the 2 D-velocity <b>field,</b> the side <b>overflow</b> discharge and sediment supply were measured. The final bed morphology has been recorded by means of digital photogrammetry. Based on the systematic experimental flume study a one- and a two-dimensional empirical model for the prediction of the mobile bed evolution near the side weir have been developed. The models allow a simple and straightforward estimation of the interaction of a side overflow with bed-load transport and bed morphology in engineering practice. The 1 D-model represents the overall mobile bed evolution in the weir reach. The model takes into account a deposit being uniform over the channel width. The height of the deposit only varies in longitudinal direction. In addition to the 1 D-approach the 2 D-model incorporates the variation of the deposit over the channel width. For the parameterisation of the two models a Maxwell-type distribution function is applied. Input parameters for both models such as the location and height of the maximum bed elevation and a shape factor are expressed in terms of non-dimensional geometric channel and side weir variables as well as hydraulic parameters and bed load transport relations. For the 2 D-approach an additional relationship considering the spanwise variation is developed. To implement the models in numerical flow simulations expressions for the location of the empirical deposit relative to the side weir are established. Regarding the impact of the deposit on the intensity of side overflow it has been found out that the spilled discharge might increase by a factor of up to ≈ 3 compared to fixed plane bed conditions. In this context about 25 % of the total increase are attributed to effects of form roughness and about 75 % to bed aggradation phenomena. In this regard the height of the deposit represents the most important parameter. The location of the deposit with respect to the position of the side weir has a smaller influence, whereas the downstream shape of the deposit is of minor importance. To test the prediction accuracy of the models they have been implemented into 1 D-flow calculations. The predicted side overflow was about 85 % for the 1 D-model and about 91 % for the 2 D-model. The difference is mainly caused due to the implementation of the spanwise variation in the 2 D-model. Besides the two models a simple relationship for direct estimation of side overflow discharge in presence of bed-load transport has been established. The empirical models have been applied in a case study on the Rhone river upstream of Lake Geneva in Switzerland. In the case of a flat bed without deposit a protection for a flood event with a hundred year return period persists. Taking into account the mobile bed evolution a protection even for an extreme flood might be obtained. This presumes a sufficiently large storage volume of the retention bassin. The skewed deposit induces the formation of an oscillatory erosion gutter downstream of the weir. For the description of the sine-generated evolution of the thalweg indicative expressions are proposed. In order to test the capability of a numerical tool to reproduce the bed aggradation phenomena observed in the experiments, 1 D-numerical simulations with bed-load transport have been performed (DUPIRO). From these computations it can be concluded that the most experimental phenomena are captured with reasonable accuracy...|$|R
