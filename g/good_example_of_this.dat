25|$|Attempts {{to reach}} {{political}} agreement on effective policies for climate change continue, and pro-nuclear environmentalists seek {{to reverse the}} traditionally anti-nuclear attitudes of environmentalists. Filmmaker Rob Stone's Pandora's Promise (2013) is a <b>good</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> trend.|$|E
25|$|Another major {{influence}} on Tolkien is riddle poetry from Anglo-Saxon England. Some {{of the oldest}} surviving Old English manuscripts contain riddle poems, such as the Leiden Riddle in the Leiden MS. The contest between Bilbo and Gollum is a <b>good</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>this.</b>|$|E
25|$|To {{a lesser}} extent dance and electronica music, which in Argentina have the largest scenes in Latin America, also {{influenced}} Argentine rock of the 2000s. A <b>good</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> is the internationally prominent techno-pop act Miranda!, a band that owes as much to current dance and electronica as the 1980s techno-pop of Virus and Los Encargados, electronic pioneers in Argentina.|$|E
50|$|<b>Good</b> <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> {{building}} type come from two major Greek sites: Olympia and Delphi.|$|R
50|$|<b>Good</b> <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> type <b>of</b> vehicle {{include the}} UK Trojan AVRE, the Russian IMR, and the US M728 Combat Engineer Vehicle.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Good</b> <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> {{model will}} have the {{original}} [...] "RSC" [...] tachometer, factory prop stand which lifts at the footrests, owners/service manual.|$|R
25|$|Airbrushes are {{commonly}} used by scale modeling enthusiasts because finer coats can be laid down, as well as opaque effects, like weathering, adding stains etc. The fine atomization of paint in modern airbrushes also {{makes it possible to}} accurately reproduce soft-edged mottled camouflage schemes, which are very hard to do convincingly by hand-brushing (Luftwaffe aircraft are a <b>good</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>this).</b>|$|E
25|$|Habituation – This is {{a process}} in which the brain learns to ignore repetitive, {{meaningless}} stimuli while remaining sensitive to others. A <b>good</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> is a person who can sleep through loud traffic in a large city, but is awakened promptly due to the sound of an alarm or crying baby. Reticular formation nuclei that modulate activity of the cerebral cortex are part of the ascending reticular activating system.|$|E
25|$|However, {{free trade}} {{does not prevent}} a nation from {{establishing}} some sort of emergency plan to become temporarily self-sufficient in case of war or that a nation could simply acquire what it needs from a different nation. A <b>good</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> is World War I, during which both Britain and Germany became partially self-sufficient. This is particularly important because Germany had no plan for creating a War economy.|$|E
50|$|The Gothic {{style is}} not as abundant, but there are <b>good</b> <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> style, such as the Cathedral of San Salvador in Oviedo.|$|R
50|$|An area of {{increasing}} popularity are multiplayer games {{different from the}} traditional family setting, bringing together total strangers. Those with an element <b>of</b> creativity are <b>good</b> <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>this.</b>|$|R
50|$|Some HLLCs {{have been}} {{particularly}} popular as developer machines (workstations), due to fast compiles and low-level control of the system with a high-level language. Pascal MicroEngine and Lisp machines are <b>good</b> <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>this.</b>|$|R
25|$|Since {{the late}} 1990s and early 2000s, female artists {{have taken a}} more visible role in the Finnish pop music scene, not only as performers, but also songwriters. A talented singer-songwriter Chisu writing Finnish lyrics for {{instance}} is a <b>good</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> phenomenon {{with a couple of}} her songs, that can very well be considered classics beside the songs of Eppu Normaali, Tuomari Nurmio and others in the future.|$|E
25|$|The {{story of}} Jonah has {{numerous}} theological implications, {{and this has}} long been recognized. In early translations of the Hebrew Bible, Jewish translators tended to remove anthropomorphic imagery {{in order to prevent}} the reader from misunderstanding the ancient texts. This tendency is evidenced in both the Aramaic translations (e.g. the Targums) and the Greek translations (e.g. the Septuagint). As far as the Book of Jonah is concerned, Targum Jonah offers a <b>good</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>this.</b>|$|E
25|$|Similarly, {{countries}} which use a single spoken language throughout may {{have two or}} more sign languages, or an area that contains more than one spoken language might use only one sign language. South Africa, which has 11 official spoken languages and a similar number of other widely used spoken languages, is a <b>good</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>this.</b> It has only one sign language with two variants due to its history of having two major educational institutions for the deaf which have served different geographic areas of the country.|$|E
50|$|Duns {{are similar}} to brochs, but are smaller and {{probably}} would not have been capable of supporting a very tall structure. <b>Good</b> <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> kind <b>of</b> dun {{can be found in the}} Outer Hebrides of Scotland, on artificial islands in small lakes.|$|R
50|$|Constructs, {{mechanical}} beasts, {{and particularly}} Warforged {{fall under the}} Artificer's area of influence. Specific infusions can be cast to Repair or inflict damage to any creature with a construct subtype. The feat 'craft construct' and the spell 'construct lock' are also <b>good</b> <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>this.</b>|$|R
25|$|The clean {{lines of}} the civil {{architecture}} in Edo influenced the sukiya style of residential architecture. Katsura Detached Palace and Shugaku-in Imperial Villa on the outskirts <b>of</b> Kyōto are <b>good</b> <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> style. Their architecture has simple lines and decor and uses wood in its natural state.|$|R
25|$|A major {{difference}} between the RN vessels and the RCN, USN, and other navies' vessels was the provision of upgraded ASDIC and radar. The RN was a world leader in developing these technologies, and thus RN Flowers were somewhat better-equipped for remote detection of enemy submarines. A <b>good</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> is the difficulty that RCN Flowers had in intercepting U-boats with their Canadian-designed SW1C metric radar, while the RN vessels were equipped with the technologically advanced Type 271 centimetric sets. In addition, RCN vessels were incapable of operating gyrocompasses, making ASDIC attacks more difficult.|$|E
25|$|After {{the fall}} of the Kamakura shogunate in 1333, the Ashikaga shogunate was formed, having later its seat in the Kyoto {{district}} of Muromachi. The proximity of the shogunate to the imperial court led to a rivalry in the upper levels of society which caused tendencies toward luxurious goods and lifestyles. Aristocratic houses were adapted from the simple buke-zukuri style to resemble the earlier shinden-zukuri style. A <b>good</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> ostentatious architecture is the Kinkaku-ji in Kyōto, which is decorated with lacquer and gold leaf, in contrast to its otherwise simple structure and plain bark roofs.|$|E
25|$|The {{representation}} of identity in forms of language can be subdivided into language, dialect, and accent. For example, {{the use of}} different dialects in an area can represent a varied social status for individuals. A <b>good</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> {{would be in the}} case of French. Until the French Revolution, the difference of dialects usage directly reflected ones social status. Peasants and lower class members spoke local dialects, while only nobles and higher class members were fluent with the official French language. Accents can reflect an area's inner conflict with classifications and authority within a population.|$|E
50|$|The Indo-Saracenic style {{developed}} {{in the second half}} of the 19th century, combining Islamic and Hindu architectural styles with its characteristic domes, arches, stained glasses, spires, and minarets. The Gateway of India and Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya are <b>good</b> <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> architectural type in the city.|$|R
30|$|For a <b>good</b> popular <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> phenomenon, see Harris 2014.|$|R
50|$|An {{alternative}} is to apply other measures than {{can be referred to}} as intermediate measures. Grass buffer strips along or within fields, a grassed waterway (in the thalwegs of dry valleys) or earthen dams are <b>good</b> <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> type <b>of</b> measures. They act as a buffer within landscape, retaining runoff temporarily and trapping sediments.|$|R
25|$|A <b>good</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> role of {{disturbance}} is in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) {{forests in the}} western United States, where surface fires frequently thin existing vegetation allowing for new growth. If fire is suppressed, douglas fir (Pesudotsuga menziesii), a shade tolerant species, eventually replaces the pines. Douglas firs, having dense crowns, severely {{limit the amount of}} sunlight reaching the forest floor. Without sufficient light new growth is severely limited. As the diversity of surface plants decreases, animal species that rely on them diminish as well. Fire, in this case, is important not only to the species directly affected but also to many other organisms whose survival depends on those key plants.|$|E
25|$|One feature {{found in}} shells {{of the modern}} Nautilus is the {{variation}} in the shape {{and size of the}} shell according to the sex of the animal, the shell of the male being slightly smaller and wider than that of the female. This sexual dimorphism is thought to be an explanation for the variation in size of certain ammonite shells of the same species, the larger shell (the macroconch) being female, and the smaller shell (the microconch) being male. This is thought to be because the female required a larger body size for egg production. A <b>good</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> sexual variation is found in Bifericeras from {{the early part of the}} Jurassic period of Europe.|$|E
25|$|To further sketch psychiatry's {{history shows}} a {{departure}} from structural neuropathology, relying more upon ideology (Sabshin, 1990). A <b>good</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> is Tourette syndrome, which Ferenczi (1921), although never having seen a patient with Tourette syndrome, suggested was the symbolic expression of masturbation caused by sexual repression. However, starting with the efficacy of neuroleptic drugs in attenuating symptoms (Shapiro, Shapiro and Wayne, 1973) the syndrome has gained pathophysiological support (e.g. Singer, 1997) and is hypothesized to have a genetic basis too, based on its high inheritability (Robertson, 2000). This trend can be seen for many hitherto traditionally psychiatric disorders (see table) and is argued to support reuniting neurology and psychiatry because both are dealing with disorders of the same system.|$|E
40|$|Public Institutions have to {{take into}} account, in their {{advertising}} campaignes, every kind of people. Then, social affairs institutions which work for children {{have to take}} special cares in their communications. New languages of communication can offer successful formula for this. In Spain there are <b>good</b> <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>this.</b> One <b>of</b> them is Andaluna program, from de andalusian government...|$|R
50|$|The {{church was}} built in a modern Gothic style, but based on 13th century French Gothic - the capitals {{of the front door}} columns are <b>good</b> <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> style. The East end of the church is however {{in the form of a}} half octagon, a {{compromise}} between the usual English square and the French semicircle.|$|R
50|$|Multi-party {{systems are}} {{political}} parties {{of three or}} more groups. Seats are awarded in legislature according to how many votes are received; therefore small parties can win seats. This encourages many small parties to form. Haiti, Suriname and Guyana are all <b>good</b> <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> practice. Haiti has approximately twenty-eight parties, Suriname twenty-six and Guyana fifteen.|$|R
25|$|One <b>good</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> is {{the quartz}} form of silicon dioxide, or SiO2. In the vast {{majority}} of silicates, the Si atom shows tetrahedral coordination by 4 oxygens. All but one of the crystalline forms involve tetrahedral {SiO4} units linked together by shared vertices in different arrangements. In different minerals the tetrahedra show different degrees of networking and polymerization. For example, they occur singly, joined together in pairs, in larger finite clusters including rings, in chains, double chains, sheets, and three-dimensional frameworks. The minerals are classified into groups based on these structures. In each of its 7 thermodynamically stable crystalline forms or polymorphs of crystalline quartz, only 2 out of 4 of each the edges of the {SiO4} tetrahedra are shared with others, yielding the net chemical formula for silica: SiO2.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the duties}} of the Czech President can be said to be {{ceremonial}} to one degree or another, especially since the President has relatively few powers independent of the will of the Prime Minister. A <b>good</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> is the status as {{commander in chief of the}} military. No part of these duties can take place but through the assent of the Prime Minister. In matters of war, he is in every sense merely a figurehead, since the constitution gives all substantive constitutional authority over the use of the armed forces to the parliament. In fact, the only specific thing the constitution allows the president to do with respect to the military is to appoint its generalsbut even this must be done with the signature of the Prime Minister.|$|E
25|$|Central Benghazi {{is where}} the {{majority}} of Benghazi's historical monuments are located, and has the city's most popular tourist attractions. Virtually all of Benghazi's theatres, libraries, best clothing stores, markets and old mosques can be found there. The Italian quarter is also located in the centre. The central districts are mostly residential and commercial areas such as Sidi Hsayn. The central suburbs are almost entirely residential and more like little towns in their own right; Al-Quwarsha is a <b>good</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>this.</b> The coastal districts (especially the southern districts) are where Benghazi's beaches can be found. Some sections have become more popular as residential areas in recent years (such as Qanfuda). These areas are still primarily recreational however, and many beach condominium resorts (known locally as chalets) have been built in previous years such as those at al-Nakheel beach, and the Nayrouz condominiums.|$|E
5000|$|As stated, talmide ha-Rambam {{differ from}} Dor Daim {{in that they}} are not {{confined}} to the Yemenite community and need not be committed to specifically Yemenite customs. Nonetheless Yemenite scholarship and practice are still a major resource for them. Two <b>good</b> <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> are seen in the works of Rabbi Yosef Qafiḥ and of Mechon-Mamre.org.|$|R
50|$|There {{are a few}} portraits by her in {{existence}} in which she set herself to copy the style of Anthony Stewart, a noted painter of babies at the time, and the portraits which she executed of the infant children of Lady Denbigh are <b>good</b> <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> special experiment. They possess many {{of the characteristics of}} Stewart's work.|$|R
50|$|Many {{diseases}} are also {{closely linked to}} animal domestication, making paleopathology an economically important factor. Many animals that have been domesticated by humans have limited genetic variation compared to wild cousins, making them particularly susceptible to disease both today and in the past. <b>Good</b> <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> limited genetic variation today include cattle ranches, beekeeping, horse racing, and dog breeding.|$|R
