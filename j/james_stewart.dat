5|$|The Volunteers' kickoff was {{returned}} to the Tech 22-yard line, and the Hokies began another drive. On the first play of the drive, however, Maurice DeShazo scrambled for a ten-yard gain but fumbled the ball. The loose ball was recovered by a Tennessee defender, and the Volunteers took over on offense from the Tech 32-yard line. Branndon Stewart came out onto the field in place of Manning, and completed an eight-yard pass to <b>James</b> <b>Stewart</b> to begin the drive. <b>James</b> <b>Stewart</b> then ran to the 20-yard line for a first down. On the next play, Tennessee executed a trick play in which <b>James</b> <b>Stewart</b> received the ball via a hand-off, imitating a running play, but threw the ball instead. The pass was caught by James Kendrick for a touchdown, and after the extra point, Tennessee had a 357 lead with 2:08 remaining in the first half.|$|E

5|$|In 1528, Margaret Tudor, now Regent of Scotland for {{her infant}} son James V, married Henry Stewart, 1st Lord Methven, a {{descendant}} of Albany. His brother, Sir <b>James</b> <b>Stewart</b> (c.1513–1554), was made Captain of Doune Castle, and Sir James' son, also James (c.1529–1590), was created Lord Doune in 1570. Lord Doune's son, another James (c.1565–1592), married Elizabeth Stuart, 2nd Countess of Moray around 1580, becoming Earl of Moray himself. The castle thus came to be the seat of its keepers, the Earls of Moray, who owned it until the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|James's father, Darnley, {{was murdered}} on 10 February 1567 at Kirk o' Field, Edinburgh, perhaps in revenge {{for the killing}} of Rizzio. James {{inherited}} his father's titles of Duke of Albany and Earl of Ross. Mary was already unpopular, and her marriage on 15 May 1567 to James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell, who was widely suspected of murdering Darnley, heightened widespread bad feeling towards her. In June 1567, Protestant rebels arrested Mary and imprisoned her in Loch Leven Castle; she never saw her son again. She was forced to abdicate on 24 July 1567 in favour of the infant James and to appoint her illegitimate half-brother, <b>James</b> <b>Stewart,</b> Earl of Moray, as regent.|$|E

5|$|Bryan Still fielded the Tennessee kickoff and {{returned}} it to the 19-yard line of Virginia Tech. After a short pass, DeShazo threw his second interception of the game. Tennessee defender John Summers returned the catch to the Tech 19-yard line, and backup quarterback Branndon Stewart returned to the game for Tennessee's offense. <b>James</b> <b>Stewart</b> took the first play of the Volunteers' drive, an eight-yard gain, then backup Jay Graham entered the game {{and ran to the}} five-yard line for a first down. After the next play—, a two-yard run by Graham—Tennessee committed a 15-yard personal foul penalty, pushing the Volunteers back to the 17-yard line. Branndon Stewart completed a pass to tight end David Horn, pushing Tennessee back to the three-yard line, but not gaining enough for a first down. Tennessee kicker John Becksvoort returned to the game, and his 19-yard field goal attempt was good, giving the Volunteers a 4516 lead with 9:41 to go in the game.|$|E
5|$|Cooper's {{social life}} {{generally}} centered on sports, outdoor activities, and dinner parties {{with his family}} and friends from the film industry, including directors Henry Hathaway, Howard Hawks, William Wellman, and Fred Zinnemann, and actors Joel McCrea, <b>James</b> <b>Stewart,</b> Barbara Stanwyck, and Robert Taylor. As well as hunting, Cooper enjoyed riding, fishing, skiing, and later in life, scuba diving.

Cooper owned several works by Pablo Picasso, whom he met in 1956. Cooper also had a lifelong passion for automobiles, with a collection that included a 1930 Duesenberg.|$|E
5|$|In 1940 Hitchcock transitioned to Hollywood productions, {{the first}} of which was the {{psychological}} thriller Rebecca starring Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine.

Hitchcock worked with Fontaine again the following year on the film Suspicion which also starred Cary Grant. In 1943 Hitchcock directed another psychological thriller Shadow of a Doubt which starred Teresa Wright and Joseph Cotten. Three years later he reunited with Grant on Notorious which also starred Ingrid Bergman. The film included a three-minute intermittent kissing scene between the leads shot specifically to skirt the Motion Picture Production Code which at the time limited such scenes to three seconds. In 1948 Hitchcock directed Rope which starred <b>James</b> <b>Stewart.</b> The film was his first in Technicolor and is remembered for its use of long takes to make the film appear to be a single continuous shot.
