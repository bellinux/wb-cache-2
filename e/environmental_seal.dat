40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the design of}} a prefabricated sustainable roof system for LionForce Systems. While being economical, environmentally sustainable, aesthetically pleasing, and easy to assemble on site, the design includes a sturdy and durable roof-to-wall joint that minimizes waste, insulates the interior, and locks out moisture. In addition, the design facilitates a 20 -foot unsupported roof span and a 4 -foot overhang beyond the exterior wall, with allowances for variation in roof pitch. The roof-to-wall joint was successfully designed and prototyped with less than half the $ 1200 allowable budget using galvanized steel with Expanded Polystyrene (EPS) insulation. Executive Summary LionForce Systems, a panelized pre-fabricated home construction company, requested {{the design of a}} system to create a structural and <b>environmental</b> <b>seal</b> between roof and wall panels of homes, increase unsupported roof span from 14 to 20 ft, and support an overhang of 4 instead of 2 ft. A successful design is structurally sound, impenetrable by moisture, critters, and air, and allows roof pitches from 2 / 12 to 8 / 12. Roof pitch is the ratio of vertical height to horizontal span. To improve LionForce’s product, a steel roof-to-wall joint in an L-shape was designed and prototyped. The L sits on the wall panel, and both extremes are in contact with the roof, providing structural support and an <b>environmental</b> <b>seal.</b> The L joint is filled with pre-cu...|$|E
40|$|This slide {{presentation}} {{reviews the}} considerations {{for the design}} of wiring for the Lunar Module. Included are a review of the choice of conductors and insulations, the wire splicing (i. e., crimping, and soldering), the wire connectors, and the fabrication of the wire harnesses. The problems in fabrication include the wires being the wrong length, the damage due to the sharp edges, the requried use of temproary protective covers and inadequate training. The problems in the wire harness installation include damge from sharp eges, work on adjacent harnesses, connector damage, and breaking wires. Engineering suggestions from the Apollo-era in reference to the conductors that are reviewed include: the use of plated conductors, and the use of alloys for stronger wiring. In refernce to insulation, the suggestions from Apollo era include the use of polymer tape-wrap wire insulation due to the light weight, however, other types of modern insulation might be more cost-effective. In reference to wire splices and terminal boards the suggestions from the Apollo Era include the use of crimp splices as superior to solder splices, joining multiple wire to a common point using modular plug-ins might be more reliable, but are heavier than crimp splicing. For connectors, the lessons from the Apollo era indicate that a rear <b>environmental</b> <b>seal</b> that does not require additional potting is preferred, and pins should be crimped or welded to the incoming wires and be removable {{from the rear of the}} connector...|$|E

40|$|AbstractLarge {{windows are}} being {{evaluated}} {{for use in}} high temperature concentrated solar receivers to reduce radiative and convective losses, maintain a differential pressure, and separate reactants from ambient air in receivers for chemical processing. The design of a 1. 7 meter diameter fused silica dome window is evaluated {{for its ability to}} maintain acceptable stresses when exposed to pressure differentials and large heat loads from solar irradiation and re-radiation from inside the receiver. The dome must be ableto withstand the operational pressure differential of 0. 5 MPa where the efficiency of the solar receiver combined with a recuperated gas turbine is maximized, and glass temperatures upwards to 800 °C may be observed. Brittle materials like glass need the tensile stresses to be reduced to maximize the reliability of the dome window. However, glass does not possess a characteristic strength and it is dependent on the flaw size. Careful attention to the dome mount must be taken to minimize tensile bending stresses that can cause a catastrophic or rapid failure while maintaining an <b>environmental</b> <b>seal.</b> The Weibull failure probability method is used to arrive at a projected lifetime of the window under a constant state of stress. This stress is used to determine the maximum design stresses allowed during operation of the solar receiver. Window heat fluxes from a Monte Carlo Ray Trace of the heliostat field and receiver re-radiation is utilized to couple the thermal mechanical effects of the window and its mount. A finite element analysis (FEA) is presented evaluating the stresses when considering the heat absorption in the window from transmitted light and re-radiation from within the solar receiver, combined with the applied pressure differential between the solar receiver and atmospheric conditions. The preliminary design of the window shape, thickness, and mounting strategy is presented...|$|E
40|$|NASA has {{expressed}} {{a need for}} reusable, environmentally friendly, phase change coating {{that is capable of}} withstanding the heat loads that have historically required an ablative thermal insulation. The Space Shuttle Program currently relies on ablative materials for thermal protection. The problem with an ablative insulation is that, by design, the material ablates away, in fulfilling its function of cooling the underlying substrate, thus preventing the insulation from being reused from flight to flight. The present generation of environmentally friendly, sprayable, ablative thermal insulation (MCC-l); currently use on the Space Shuttle SRBs, is very close to being a reusable insulation system. In actual flight conditions, as confirmed by the post-flight inspections of the SRBs, very little of the material ablates. Multi-flight thermal insulation use has not been qualified for the Space Shuttle. The gap {{that would have to be}} overcome in order to implement a reusable Phase Change Coating (PCC) is not unmanageable. PCC could be applied robotically with a spray process utilizing phase change material as filler to yield material of even higher strength and reliability as compared to MCC- 1. The PCC filled coatings have also demonstrated potential as cryogenic thermal coatings. In experimental thermal tests, a thin application of PCC has provided the same thermal protection as a much thicker and heavier application of a traditional ablative thermal insulation. In addition, tests have shown that the structural integrity of the coating has been maintained and phase change performance after several aero-thermal cycles was not affected. Experimental tests have also shown that, unlike traditional ablative thermal insulations, PCC would not require an <b>environmental</b> <b>seal</b> coat, which has historically been required to prevent moisture absorption by the thermal insulation, prevent environmental degradation, and to improve the optical and aerodynamic properties. In order to reduce the launch and processing costs of a reusable space vehicle to an affordable level, refurbishment costs must be substantially reduced. A key component of such a cost effective approach is the use of a reusable, phase change, thermal protection coating...|$|E
