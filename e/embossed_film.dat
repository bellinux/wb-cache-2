50|$|Film {{embossing}} is {{a mechanical}} {{process in which}} a flat film is transformed into an embossed product. During the process, thermal and stress fields are applied to the polymer, causing changes in the microstructure and physical dimensions of the material. The engineering analysis of the process requires the study of various aspects relating to the characterization of the microstructure before and after embossing, A variety of techniques were employed to characterize the properties and microstructure of the <b>embossed</b> <b>film</b> in relation to crystallinity, orientation, mechanical properties, and dimensions of the embossed films. The thermal treatment of the polymer film was shown {{to be the most}} significant factor in the process. By controlling the thermal treatment of the film, it is possible to manipulate the properties and dimensions of the <b>embossed</b> <b>film.</b> The important aspects: influencing thermal treatment include the radiation heater temperature, preheat roll temperature, line velocity, and film thickness. The initial film orientation and embossing pressure have a minor effect on the final properties of the <b>embossed</b> <b>film.</b> The main effect of the embossing pressure is on the bulk thickness of the <b>embossed</b> <b>film.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Embossed TiO 2 {{thin films}} with high surface areas are {{achieved}} using soft-templates composed of monolayer polystyrene beads. The form of {{links between the}} beads in the templates is controlled by varying the O 2 plasma etching time on the templates, resulting in various templates with close-linked, nano-linked, and isolated beads. Room-temperature deposition of TiO 2 on the plasma-treated templates and calcination at 550 ℃ result in <b>embossed</b> <b>films</b> with tailored links between anatase TiO 2 hollow hemispheres. Although all the <b>embossed</b> <b>films</b> have similar surface areas, the sensitivity of films with nano-linked TiO 2 hollow hemispheres to 500 ppm CO and ethanol gases are much {{higher than that of}} films with close-linked and isolated hollow hemispheres, and the detection limits of them are as low as 0. 6 ppm for CO and 0. 1 ppm for ethanol. The strong correlation of sensitivity with the form of links between hollow hemispheres reveals the critical role of potential barriers formed at the links. The facile, large-scale, and on-chip fabrication of <b>embossed</b> TiO 2 <b>films</b> with nano-linked hollow hemispheres on Si substrate and the high sensitivity without the aid of additives give us a sustainable competitiv...|$|R

40|$|Suzuki-Miyaura {{polycondensation}} (SPC) {{is widely}} used to prepare a variety of copolymers for {{a broad range of}} applications. Although SPC protocols are often used in many instances, the limits of this method and issues of molecular weight reproducibility are not often looked at in detail. By using a spiropyran-based (SP) mechanochromic copolymer, we present an optimized protocol for the microwave-assisted synthesis of a mechanochromic, alternating copolymer P(SP-alt-C- 10) via SPC that allows the reproduction of molecular weight distributions. Several parameters such as microwave power, temperature, stoichiometry, and ligand are screened, leading to molecular weights up to M-w similar to 174 kg mol(- 1). The process of optimization is guided by NMR end group analysis which shows that dehalogenation, oxidative deborylation and SP cleavage are the limiting factors that impede further increase of molar mass, while other classical side reactions such as protiodeborylation are not observed. <b>Embossing</b> <b>films</b> of P(SP-alt-C- 10) yields the colored merocyanine (MC) copolymer P(MC-alt-C- 10) that undergoes a thermally facilitated back reaction to P(SP-alt-C- 10). DFT suggests that the barrier of the SP -> MC transition has two contributions, with the first one being related to the color change and the second one to internal bond reorganizations. The barrier height is 1. 5 eV, which suggests that the ease of the thermally facilitated back reaction is either due to residual energy stored in the deformed polymer matrix, or arises from an MC isomer that is not in the thermodynamically most stable state...|$|R

40|$|We used {{mechanically}} <b>embossed</b> polyester <b>films</b> {{to analyze}} the dynamics of cell alignment and cell-specific factors modulating the response of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and of a rat myogenic cell line to the surface topography.

30|$|Nanoimprinting {{lithography}} (NIL) is investigated as {{a promising}} method to define nanostructure; however, finding a practical method to achieve large area patterning of conjugated polymer remains a challenge. We demonstrate here that {{a simple and}} cost-effective technique is proposed to fabricate the nanoimprinted P 3 HT nanograting by solvent-assisted room temperature NIL (SART-NIL) method with patterned ETFE film as mold. The patterned ETFE template is produced by <b>embossing</b> ETFE <b>film</b> into a patterned silicon master and is used as template to transfer nanogratings during the SART-NIL process. It indicates that highly reproducible and well-controlled P 3 HT nanograting film is obtained successfully with feature size of nanogratings ranging from 130 to 700  nm, due to the flexibility, stiffness, and low surface energy of ETFE mold. Moreover, the SART-NIL method using ETFE mold is able to fabricate nanogratings but not to induce the change of molecular orientation within conjugated polymer. The conducting ability of P 3 HT nanograting in the vertical direction is also not damaged after patterning. Finally, we further apply P 3 HT nanograting for the fabrication of active layer of OBHJ solar cell device, to investigate the morphology role presented by ETFE mold in device performance. The device performance of OBHJ solar cell is preferential to that of PBHJ device obviously.|$|R

40|$|Department of Materials Science and EngineeringWidespread energy harvesting, {{generating}} self-sufficient {{power from}} the surrounding environment, such as wind, solar and geothermal, have attracted increasing attention {{in the past decade}} due to the energy crisis and global warming. Among them, many technological devices converting mechanical energy into other forms of energy or vice versa have been proposed and investigated because of an extended life time, no recharging procedures, and their scalability. Generally, mechanical energy converted into electricity, namely, by using electromagnetic, electrostatic, and piezoelectric effects. Among many technologies, energy harvesting technologies based on the piezoelectric effect, named as piezoelectric nanogenerators (PENG), have been extensively investigated because of an extended life time, no recharging procedures, and scalability. A high flexibility or stretchability is essential in generating high-power continuous electric output signals. The high flexibility can provide an opportunity applicable to a target object without any limitation of its shape and movement. Most recently, a new type of power generating device, named as triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) based on triboelectric effects coupled with electrostatic effects have been demonstrated as powerful means of harvesting mechanical energy from living environment. In traditional TENGs, the two materials were chosen according to the difference in surface potentials, e. g., the polymer material (i. e. Teflon) terminated with the most electronegative functional group as the negative side and the low work function material (i. e. Al metal) as the positive side, apart from each other (named as airgap). When the two materials are contacted, the polymer material at the negative side tends to gain electrons from Al metal, resulting in being negative compared with Al. Thus, a key approach to improve the electrical output performance of the TENGs from the materials aspect is to increase the triboelectric surface charge density through material modification and surface functionalization. In this study, we introduce highly-ordered <b>embossed</b> thin <b>films</b> with hollow hemispheres as one of promising structures for nanogenerators and pressure sensors, as well as extremely stable and directional anisotropic power generation in the composite-type piezoelectric nanogenerators without any treatment of electrical poling. For triboelectric nanogenerators, the material modifications such as the dielectric constant, the compressibility, and the surface potential in TENGs have focused. Additionally, the increased density of surface charges primary determined by the intrinsic properties of the specific materials and the effective means to enhance the output power of TENGs have proposed, which are critically important for improving the output performance of TENGs. ope...|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{ultrasonic}} micro hot embossing {{is shown to}} be suitable for the fabrication of polymer micro structures and entire devices. Micro structures are generated {{in a couple of}} seconds. Similar as in hot <b>embossing,</b> a polymer <b>film</b> is softened by heating and a micro pattern is molded from a metal tool. Heating is achieved with an ultrasonic welding machine generating mechanical vibrations with up to several 10 µm amplitude at a frequency between 20 and 70 kHz. These vibrations are applied to the polymer film by pressing it with the horn of the ultrasonic machine onto the tool. The cyclical deformations of the polymer film generate local heating and melting of the polymer where it is in contact to protruding micro structures on the tool. After turning off the vibrations and cooling of the polymer within a few seconds the micro structure can be de-molded. Micro structures with feature sizes of down to 2 µm were produced this way at 35 kHz. With the same machine a micro channel was sealed by ultrasonic welding with a specially designed tool. The following parameters turned out to control the process significantly: frequency, amplitude, time, pressure, and polymer type. Process limits were observed with respect to the achievable aspect ratio, overall pattern size, and minimum and maximum structure height. The fabrication process is demonstrated by manufacturing micro fluidic devices, such as micro mixers and micro thermal flow sensors, and, corrugated membranes. Ridges on the mixing channel were used to enhance a mixing of two liquids. The micro structure of the ridges was molded onto the mixing channel 20 µm high, 250 µm wide, and orientated at an angle of 45 ° with respect to the channel walls. The mixing channel was designed 25 mm long, 100 µm high, and 500 µm wide with a Tjunction inlet and an outlet. Testing results show that the ridges decreased the mixing time by a factor of 4. The micro thermal flow sensor consists of a 100 µm high, 500 µm wide, and 1 cm long channel from polypropylene which is crossed by a gold wire with a diameter of 50 µm. The measurement results support theory. The reaction times of the sensor were measured to be 24 ms after switching on and 20 ms after switching off the piezo-actuated micro diaphragm pump at 0. 5 Hz. Furthermore, it was shown that this technique can be applied to generate molded interconnect devices (MID) also. A pattern of an electrically conducting metal was generated on a polymer substrate by welding a polymer layer with the metal on top onto the substrate where there were protruding micro structures on the tool. Sharp edges around the protruding structures cut the metal and ensure electrical insulation. The on-welded areas are mechanically removed after this process. A coil from a 10 µm thick aluminum layer was generated this way on a 250 µm thick polypropylene sheet. The coil was combined with a capacitor to a transponder which was excited with a primary coil to resonance oscillations at 1. 5 to 2. 5 MHz...|$|R
