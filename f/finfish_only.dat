40|$|Commercial fishery {{catches in}} Brunei Darussalam between 2000 and 2009 {{were used to}} examine changes in {{community}} structure of Brunei's marine ecosystem – a relatively lightly harvested system within a region chronically overexploited by fisheries. We found that Mean Trophic Level (MTL) has declined {{at a rate of}} 0. 08 trophic levels (TL) per decade, suggesting a ‘fishing down the marine food web’ process in Brunei waters. In order to focus on changes in relative abundance of the more threatened, higher TL <b>finfish</b> <b>only,</b> MTL was recalculated as 3. 30 MTL (to exclude catches of finfish and invertebrates species with TL less than 3. 30). Here, we found no overall trend in the 3. 30 MTL over the study period. However, a more in-depth analysis suggested that MTL fails to capture substantial changes in underlying species assemblage. Over the course of the study period, marked changes in fish community structure were observed. Analysis of official statistics showed an increase in total catch was driven primarily by an increase in pelagic catches, with a similar trend observed when the catches were aggregated into either high- or low-TL. This pattern is consistent with the increasing Fishing-in-Balance (FiB) index for the Brunei region. Whilst our study was not aimed at demonstrating overfishing as the cause of observed trends, there is a danger that current best practice fails to detect what may be an imminent fishery collapse. In many fisheries around the world, {{there is a need for}} detection methods able to identify potential problems within a time scale short enough to be able to react effectivel...|$|E

50|$|Donnelly {{entered the}} 40th Canadian Parliament during its third session, which lasted one year, {{during which time}} he served as the party's {{national}} fisheries critic. During that year he sponsored six private member bills, none of which advanced far enough to be voted upon. He sponsored two amendments to the Criminal Code, both of which Dawn Black had previously introduced in the previous parliament: Bill C-520 would have added the offence of luring a child to those offenses prosecutable in Canada even if committed outside Canada and Bill C-521 would have expanded the offence of luring a child to include all means of communication rather than solely through a computer. In March 2010, he introduced Bill C-502 that would prohibit oil tankers in the Dixon Entrance, Hecate Strait and Queen Charlotte Sound. In May 2010, he introduced Bill C-518 which proposed to amend the Fisheries Act to require commercial <b>finfish</b> aquaculture <b>only</b> take place in closed containment facilities. He also proposed Bill C-526 that would have expanded Employment Insurance coverage received {{as a result of}} illness, injury or quarantine from 15 to 52 weeks.|$|R
40|$|As {{aquaculture}} production expands, we must avoid mistakes made during increasing intensification of agriculture. Understanding environmental impacts and measures to mitigate them {{is important for}} designing responsible {{aquaculture production}} systems. There are four realistic goals that can make future aquaculture operations more sustainable and productive: (1) improvement of management practices to create more efficient and diverse systems at every production level; (2) emphasis on local decisionmaking, human capacity development, and collective action to generate productive aquaculture systems that fit into societal constraints and demands; (3) development of risk management efforts for all systems that reduce disease problems, eliminate antibiotic and drug abuse, and prevent exotic organism introduction into local waters; and (4) creation of systems to better identify more sustainably grown aquaculture products {{in the market and}} promote them to individual consumers. By 2050, seafood will be predominantly sourced through aquaculture, including not <b>only</b> <b>finfish</b> and invertebrates but also seaweeds...|$|R

40|$|The large {{yellow croaker}} (Larimichthys crocea), endemic to East Asia was {{once one of the}} three top {{commercial}} marine fishes of China PR. Heavily exploited since the 1950 s, wild stocks were so severely depleted by the 1980 s that most individuals subsequently sold originated from hatcheries. After peaking at about 200 000 tonnes in the mid- 1970 s, catches of the croaker in China PR declined by over 90 % within just 2 decades; according to most decline criteria this would categorize the croaker as "threatened" and management measures, including restocking, were developed. The extensive government-sponsored mariculture program introduced to address food supply and overfishing in the 1980 s, particularly of the croaker, was one of the earliest for marine <b>finfish,</b> not <b>only</b> in China PR, a nation with a rich and highly successful history in aquaculture, but globally. In this first, in-depth, profile of a key fishery and early mariculture development, we integrate ecological and biological information with the fishing, management, mariculture and economic history to trace the collapse of wild stocks and assess why management and mariculture did not result in wild stock recovery. Evidence strongly suggests that a combination of heavy exploitation of spawning and over-wintering aggregations, poor management and overfishing pressure were major factors in stock declines, with contributions from pollution, habitat degradation and marine ecosystem shift. Although the croaker proved a highly successful mariculture candidate, with approximately 70 000 tonnes produced in 2005, the highest of any marine fish cultured in China PR, mariculture and restocking have failed to restore croaker stocks and may have, inadvertently, led to biodiversity losses. The detailed history of the croaker is a sobering reminder that successful mariculture, albeit important for food production and livelihoods, is not necessarily a solution to overfishing, and moreover, may have compromised fishery recovery by competing for funds, attention, space, and maybe genetic resources. © 2008 The Authors. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
50|$|New electoral {{districts in}} the Greater Vancouver area, added for the 2015 election, {{resulted}} in Donnelly moving to the re-created Port Moody—Coquitlam riding, which effectively would shift his representative area northwards by removing New Westminster and adding the entirety of Port Moody. In the election, Donnelly was challenged by City of Vancouver's chief digital officer Jessie Adcock for the Liberal Party, Canadian Forces veteran Tim Laidler for the Conservative Party, and Green Party member Marcus Madsen, as well as Roland Verrier of the Marxist-Leninist again. Though Donnelly won his riding with 36% of the vote, the Liberal Party won the general election and formed a majority government with the Conservative Party taking over the official opposition status and the NDP as the third party. With a reduced number of MPs, party leader Tom Mulcair appointed Donnelly to be the NDP critic for Fisheries, Oceans, and the Canadian Coast Guard, again, a post he previously held in 2009-2012 and since acted as deputy to. In the 42nd Canadian Parliament he, again, sponsored the private member bill C-228 which proposed to amend the Fisheries Act to require commercial <b>finfish</b> aquaculture <b>only</b> take place in closed containment facilities {{and this time it}} was voted on, in December 2016, but defeated with a majority of the Liberal Party MPs (who were granted a free vote) and the Conservative Party voting against the bill, though all NDP, Bloc Quebecois and Green Party MPs voted in favour. In March 2016 Donnelly re-introduced the Ban on Shark Fin Importation Act (Bill C-251). It only received a first reading but was introduced into the senate by Conservative senator Michael L. MacDonald in April 2017. Donnelly did not re-introduce his previous bill to prohibit oil tankers off B.C.'s north coast, though the government house bill Oil Tanker Moratorium Act (Bill C-48) was introduced that would accomplish much the same except it would still allow small general purpose tankers.|$|R
40|$|White spot {{syndrome}} virus (WSSV) {{has become}} epidemic in Indonesia and affecting shrimp aquaculture interm of its production. White spot syndrome virus {{is transmitted from}} one to other ponds, through crustacean, included planktonic copepode as carrier for WSSV and through water from affected shrimp pond. A cluster model, consist of shrimp grow out ponds surrounded by non-shrimp pond as a role of biosecurity has been developed. The model aimed to prevent white spot virus transmission in extensive giant tiger shrimp pond. The {{study was conducted in}} two sites at Demak District, Central Java Province. As the treatment, a cluster consist of three shrimp ponds in site I, and two shrimp ponds in site II, each was surrounded by buffer ponds rearing <b>only</b> <b>finfish.</b> As the control, five extensive shrimp grow out ponds in site I and three shrimp grow out ponds in site II, with shrimp pond has neither applied biosecurity nor surrounded by non-shrimp pond as biosecurity as well considered as control ponds. The results found that treatment of cluster shrimp ponds surrounded by non-shrimp ponds could hold shrimp at duration of culture in the grow out pond (DOC) 105. 6 ± 4. 5 days significantly much longer than that of control that harvested at 60. 9 ± 16. 0 days due to WSSV outbreak. Survival rate in trial ponds was 77. 6 ± 3. 6 %, significantly higher than that of control at 22. 6 ± 15. 8 %. Shrimp production in treatment ponds has total production of  425. 1 ± 146. 6 kg/ha significantly higher than that of control that could only produced 54. 5 ± 47. 6 kg/ha.  Implementation of Better Management Practices (BMP) by arranging shrimp ponds in cluster and surrounding by non-shrimp ponds proven effectively prevent WSSV transmission from traditional shrimp ponds in surrounding area...|$|R
