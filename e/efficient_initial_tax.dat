40|$|We {{investigate}} the welfare effects of environmental tax reform, i. e. raising environmental taxes {{and using the}} proceeds to reduce distortionary taxes on labour. The framework of analysis is a small open economy with involuntary unemployment due to a rigid consumer wage. Environmental tax reform boosts not only environmental quality but also employment if substitution between labour and resources is easy, the production share of the fixed factor is large, and the <b>initial</b> <b>tax</b> rates on resources and profits are small.

40|$|This paper investigates {{whether it}} is {{possible}} to find Pareto-improving commodity tax reforms that harmonize taxes between two countries when governments supply public goods and thus have revenue requirements. To focus on the basic issues, we consider a Ricardian model of trade with elastic factor supply and two traded goods, and suppose that <b>initial</b> <b>taxes</b> are Nash equilibrium ones. This allows a complete characterization of the conditions under which Pareto-improving reforms exist using simple geometric arguments. These conditions are completely determined by: (i) the configuration of <b>initial</b> <b>taxes</b> across countries; and (ii) whether the two goods are substitutes or complements. An example suggests that harmonization is unlikely to be Pareto-improving if the revenue requirement is high, and the demand for imports relatively price elastic, in both countries. An alternative definition of harmonization, difference harmonization, which may yield Pareto-improvements under more general conditions, is proposed. Commodity Tax Reform; Tax Harmonization...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A direct-proportional length-based DNA {{computing}} {{approach for}} weighted graph problems {{has been proposed}} where the cost of each path is en-coded by the length of oligonucleotides in a proportional way. During the ini-tial pool generation, the hybridization/ligation phase is carried out where all the combinations are generated in the solution. However, this encoding suffers from biological behavior of hybridization since longer oligonucleotides {{are more likely to}} hybridize as oppose to the shorter ones. Recently, parallel overlap assembly (POA) has been recognized as an <b>efficient</b> <b>initial</b> pool generation of DNA computing for weighted graph problems. If POA is employed during the initial pool generation of direct-proportional length-based DNA computing, we expected that the biological influence contributed by various lengths of the oligonucleotides could be minimized as much as possible. Thus, in this paper we found that the hybridization/ligation method should be replaced with parallel overlap assembly, for a better and <b>efficient</b> <b>initial</b> pool generation of direct-proportional length-based DNA computing. ...|$|R

In this paper a fast access authentication process is implemented which is faster than current 802. 11 i.

Due to more number of round-trip messages in 802. 11 i authentication delay is intolerable under some scenarios. To overcome this, an <b>efficient</b> <b>initial</b> access authentication protocol FLAP is proposed which introduces two round-trip messages with authentications and key distribution. Proposed FLAP protocol scheme is more secure than 4 -way handshake protocol. Simulations are conducted using different scenarios like Authentication delay, Throughput, Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), Packet Drops are measured for different scenarios and compared between the 802. 11 i and FLAP protocol.

50|$|Ricardian {{equivalence}} has crucial {{importance in}} the fiscal policy considerations of new classical macroeconomics. When assessing Ricardian equivalence {{or any of the}} new classical doctrines, one should bear in mind the conditional character of these theses. Thus the equivalence theorem should not be separated from the assumptions on which it is based. In other words, Ricardian equivalence does not mean that any countercyclical efforts will fail, but outlines the necessary conditions for that failure and, naturally, for success at the same time. Governments do not have any potential to exert countercyclical efforts if the path of government expenditures is fixed and if agents form rational expectations. If these conditions hold, cuts in taxes imply a later pressure to rise taxes, since government has to fill the resource gap in the budget which {{is the result of the}} <b>initial</b> <b>tax</b> cut. So, rational agents will put the additional income from the tax cut into savings and consumption does not rise. In this story, public operations should stand in the focus of reasoning: if these processes can be changed by the government, or, in any way, the additional income can be believed not to be withdrawn later, the <b>initial</b> <b>tax</b> cut will induce a rise in public consumption expenditures.|$|R

Depreciation charges initially decrease over time, and after a number of periods the firm enters a steady state where depreciation is constant and equal to replacement investments. This way, the optimal solution trades off the benefits of accelerated depreciation (because of discounting) and of constant depreciation (because of the progressive tax system).
