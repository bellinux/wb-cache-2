New generation LS, IS, ES, GS, and RX models subsequently became available in Japan along with the SC 430, ending domestic sales of Toyota-branded models under the Celsior, Altezza, Windom, Aristo, Harrier, and Soarer nameplates, respectively. The Altezza and Aristo were previously exclusive to Japanese Toyota retail sales channels called Toyota Vista Store, the Windom was exclusive to Toyota Corolla Store, the Celsior and Harrier were exclusive to Toyopet Store, and the Soarer was previously available at both Toyota Store and Toyopet Store locations. Lexus models sold in Japan featured higher specifications and a price premium compared with their discontinued Toyota counterparts. Sales for the <b>first</b> <b>half-year</b> were slower than expected, affected by the contraction of the domestic auto market and price increases, but improved in subsequent months with an expanded lineup.|$|E

2500|$|A 2001 World Health Organization (WHO) {{report found}} that infant formula {{prepared}} in accordance with applicable Codex Alimentarius standards was a safe complementary food and a suitable breast milk substitute. In 2003, the WHO and UNICEF published their Global Strategy for Infant and Young Child Feeding, which restated that [...] "processed-food products for...young children should, when sold or otherwise distributed, meet applicable standards recommended by the Codex Alimentarius Commission", and also warned that [...] "lack of breastfeeding—and especially lack of exclusive breastfeeding during the <b>first</b> <b>half-year</b> of life—are important risk factors for infant and childhood morbidity and mortality". In particular, the use of infant formula in less economically developed countries is linked to poorer health outcomes because of the prevalence of unsanitary preparation conditions, including lack of clean water and lack of sanitizing equipment. UNICEF estimates that a formula-fed child living in unclean conditions is between 6 and 25 {{times more likely to}} die of diarrhea and four times more likely to die of pneumonia than a breastfed child. Rarely, use of powdered infant formula (PIF) has been associated with serious illness, and even death, due to infection with Cronobacter sakazakii and other microorganisms that can be introduced to PIF during its production. [...] Although C. sakazakii can cause illness in all age groups, infants are believed to be at greatest risk of infection. Between 1958 and 2006, there have been several dozen reported cases of E. sakazakii infection worldwide. The WHO believes that such infections are under-reported.|$|E

On 3 October 1856, today's {{lower part of the}} building was consecrated by Cardinal Joseph Othmar von Rauscher of the Immaculate Conception, which had just been proclaimed a Roman Catholic faith dogma. The house was occupied by 68 pupils. In 1857, the building was expanded by the present part of the gate and a mirrored part of the rectory. In 1858/59 the three-storey {{building of the}} hostel (today's Gymnasium) was completed. In 1875 a large fire from the former workshops destroyed part of the building. In {{the last quarter of the}} nineteenth century reconstructions were carried out, the reconstruction of the hostel and rectory as well as the construction of the music-house with a gymnasium before the hostel. The first edition of the Schulzeitschrift Kalksburger Korrespondenz was published in 1886. In 1897, the school received the right to publicize all classes as well as the legal maturity tests, after it had already been granted the public right for the first three classes in 1891. From 1902 until his death in 1931, Fr. Anton Straub served as chaplain and theologian there. In 1904 :de:Karl Maria von Andlau, S.J., (1865-1935) became the rector of the house. He later became the Jesuit Provincial Superior and a confidant of the Emperor Charles I of Austria.After the Anschluss in 1938 the Jesuit College was dissolved by the National Socialists. Until 1945, a police school was housed in the {{main building}}. The occupying troops after the Second World War left the house in 1947. In the autumn of the same year classes resumed, but from 1948 to 1951 part of the collegiate building was still used by the Red Army. In July 1954, the first post-war matriculation was held.

40|$|The {{financial}} year 2013 - 14 {{has been seen}} as a turning point for Australia Post. Over the period January to June 2014, Australia Post booked its <b>first</b> ever <b>half-year</b> loss since becoming a government owned enterprise in 1989. This was a direct result of heavy losses occurring in Australia Post’s mail business, losses that were in excess of profits generated across the rest of its operations. Losses in Australia Post 2 ̆ 7 s mail business, driven by declining mail volumes as people and organisations switch from traditional letters mail to digital alternatives, is having a major impact on the financial viability of Australia Post. There are also substantial costs associated with meeting Australia Post’s Community Service Obligations (CSOs) that govern delivery frequency, delivery timetables, public access, and pricing. Remarkably, Australia Post’s CSO requirements were last reviewed 16 years ago, well before the acceleration of digital transformation across the services sector. To offset these losses, Australia Post has been looking to grow its business in the developing digital environment, including through opportunities presented by the growth in e-commerce, and through strategies that make strategic use of Australia Post’s extensive network of retail outlets.  It has also asked the Government for new tools to reduce the scale of the losses in the letters business, including the freedom to set more cost-reflective prices and more freedom in scheduling deliveries.  ...|$|R

Unconscious of its effect upon others, he only saw in their actions evidence of certain things that the crafty Peleg had hinted on that eventful New Year's eve.

6000|$|There happen {{frequently}} {{little odd}} coincidences in time, that recall momentary {{faith in the}} notion of sympathies acting in absence. I heard of your brother's return, for the first time, on Monday last, the day on which your letter is dated, from Stoddart. Had it rained on my naked skin I could not have felt more strangely. The 300 or 400 miles that are between us seemed converted into a moral distance; and I knew that the whole of this silence I was myself accountable for; for I ended my last letter by promising to follow it with a second and longer one, before you could answer the first. But immediately on my arrival in this country I undertook to finish a poem which I had begun, entitled [...] "Christabel", for a second volume of the [...] "Lyrical Ballads". I tried to perform my promise, but the deep unutterable disgust which I had suffered in the translation of the accursed [...] "Wallenstein", seemed to have stricken me with barrenness; for I tried and tried, and nothing would come of it. I desisted with a deeper dejection than I am willing to remember. The wind from the Skiddaw and Borrowdale was often as loud as wind need be, and many a walk in the clouds in the mountains did I take; but all would not do, till one day I dined out at the house of a neighbouring clergyman, and some how or other drank so much wine, that I found some effort and dexterity requisite to balance myself on the hither edge of sobriety. The next day my verse-making faculties returned to me, and I proceeded successfully, till my poem grew so long, and in Wordsworth's opinion so impressive, that he rejected it from his volume, as disproportionate both in size and merit, and as discordant in its character. In the mean time I had gotten myself entangled in the old sorites of the old sophist,--procrastination. I had suffered my necessary businesses to accumulate so terribly, that I neglected to write to any one, till the pain I suffered from not writing made me waste as many hours in dreaming about it as would have sufficed for the letter writing of half a life. But there is something beside time requisite for the writing of a letter--at least with me. My situation here is indeed a delightful situation; but I feel what I have lost--feel it deeply--it recurs more often and more painfully than I had anticipated, indeed so much so, that I scarcely ever feel myself impelled, that is to say, pleasurably impelled to write to Poole. I used to feel myself more at home in his great windy parlour than in my own cottage. We were well suited to each other--my animal spirits corrected his inclination to melancholy; and there was something both in his understanding and in his affections, so healthy and manly, that my mind freshened in his company, and my ideas and habits of thinking acquired day after day more of substance and reality. Indeed, indeed, my dear, sir, with tears in my eyes, and with all my heart and soul, I wish it were as easy for us all to meet as it was when you lived at Upcott. Yet when I revise the step I have taken, I know not how I could have acted otherwise than I did act. Everything I promised myself in this country has answered far beyond my expectation. The room in which I write commands six distinct landscapes--the two lakes, the vale, the river and mountains, and mists, and clouds and sunshine, make endless combinations, as if heaven and earth were for ever talking to each other. Often when in a deep study, I have walked to the window and remained there looking without seeing; all at once the lake of Keswick and the fantastic mountains of Borrowdale, at the head of it, have entered into my mind, with a suddenness as if I had been snatched out of Cheapside and placed for the first time, in the spot where I stood--and that is a delightful feeling--these fits and trances of novelty received from a long known object. The river Greta flows behind our house, roaring like an untamed son of the hills, then winds round and glides away in the front, so {{that we live in a}} peninsula. But besides this etherial eye-feeding we have very substantial conveniences. We are close to the town, where we have respectable and neighbourly acquaintance, and a most sensible and truly excellent medical man. Our garden is part of a large nursery garden, which is the same to us and as private as if the whole had been our own, and thus too we have delightful walks without passing our garden gates. My landlord who lives in the sister house, for the two houses are built so as to look like one great one, is a modest and kind man, of a singular character. By the severest economy he raised himself from a carrier into the possession of a comfortable independence. He was always very fond of reading, and has collected nearly 500 volumes, of our most esteemed modern writers, such as Gibbon, Hume, Johnson, etc. etc. His habits of economy and simplicity, remain with him, and yet so very disinterested a man I scarcely ever knew. Lately, when I wished to settle with him about the rent of our house, he appeared much affected, told me that my living near him, and the having so much of Hartley's company were great comforts to him and his housekeeper, that he had no children to provide for, and did not mean to marry; and in short, that he did not want any rent at all from me. This of course I laughed him out of; but he absolutely refused to receive any rent for the <b>first</b> <b>half-year,</b> under the pretext that the house was not completely furnished. Hartley quite lives at the house, and it is as you may suppose, no small joy to my wife to have a good affectionate motherly woman divided from her only by a wall. Eighteen miles from our house lives Sir Guilfred Lawson, who has a princely library, chiefly of natural history--a kind and generous, but weak and ostentatious sort of man, who has been abundantly civil to me. Among other raree shows, he keeps a wild beast or two, with some eagles, etc. The master of the beasts at the Exeter 'Change, sent him down a large bear,--with it a long letter of directions, concerning the food, etc. of the animal, and many solicitations respecting other agreeable quadrupeds which he was desirous to send to the baronet, at a moderate price, and concluding in this manner: [...] "and remain your honour's most devoted humble servant, J.P. Permit me, sir Guilfred, to send you a buffalo and a rhinoceros." [...] As neat a postscript as I ever heard--the tradesmanlike coolness with which these pretty little animals occurred to him just at the finishing of his letter! You will in three weeks see the letters on the 'Rise and Condition of the German Boors'. I found it convenient to make up a volume out of my journey, etc. in North Germany--and the letters (your name of course erased) are in the printer's hands. I was so weary of transcribing and composing, that when I found those more carefully written than the rest, I even sent them off as they were.|$|E
