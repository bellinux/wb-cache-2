50|$|Water damage {{restoration}} {{is often}} prefaced by a loss {{assessment and evaluation}} of affected materials. The damaged area is inspected with water sensing equipment such as probes and other infrared tools {{in order to determine}} the source of the damage and possible extent of area affected. Restoration services would then be rendered to the residence in order to dry the structure, sanitize any affected or cross contaminated areas, and deodorize all affected areas and materials. After the labor is completed, water damage equipment including air movers, air scrubbers, dehumidifiers, wood <b>floor</b> <b>drying</b> systems, and sub <b>floor</b> <b>drying</b> equipment is left in the residence. Industry standards state that drying vendors should return at regular time intervals, preferably every twenty-four hours, to monitor the equipment, temperature, humidity, and moisture content of the affected walls and contents.|$|E
40|$|Purpose The {{water damage}} in {{buildings}} because of leaking pipes and increasingly because of floods and severe weather require professional help. Methods for improved repair and remediation techniques {{have to be}} developed. The water damage in buildings because of leaking pipes and increasingly because of floods and severe weather require professional help. Methods for improved repair and remediation techniques have to be developed. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach Therefore, large scale laboratory tests with four rooms, each with three types of masonry walls and typical floors for intermediate storeys with insulation were performed within a climate simulator. Artificial water damage was provoked through watering the floors, and the dispersion {{of water in the}} floors and the rising damp in the walls was measured. In the follow-up to the watering of the floors, a company specialized in drying wet buildings, installed systems for under <b>floor</b> <b>drying</b> and wall drying. Findings The drying process of the different components and layers of the floor construction and walls was monitored by a measuring system with more than 300 sensors for moisture content, relative humidity and temperature accompanied by thermography and demonstrated so {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the different tested drying systems. After providing an initial contamination that is typical for construction sites, the microbial load (mould infestation) within the wet components was monitored at different times by experienced biologists. So after three weeks under <b>floor</b> <b>drying</b> no mould growth could be asserted but more bacteria than expected were found. Originality/value The aim of the research was to gain more confidence in selecting appropriate drying procedures and systems in order to identify the right moment for terminating the drying process. A further intent was to acquire data for computer simulations...|$|E

500|$|Murray cod have {{soft skin}} and very fine scales that leave them {{vulnerable}} to infection from exotic disease organisms. The following exotic disease organisms all seriously affect wild Murray cod; {{all have been}} introduced by imports of exotic fish. Chilodenella is a single-celled, parasitic protozoa that infects the skin of Murray cod and has caused a number of serious kills of wild Murray cod. Saprolegnia is a fungus-like oomycete or [...] "water mould" [...] that frequently infects Murray cod eggs and the skin of Murray cod that have been roughly handled through poor catch and release technique. (It is essential that Murray cod intended for release only touch cool wet surfaces and are not put down on any hard, dry, rough or hot surfaces, e.g. boat gunwales, boat <b>floors,</b> <b>dry</b> grass, dry rocks, gravel banks, dry towels or mats, etc. Hands should also be wetted before touching them. They must not be hung vertically by the mouth or gill covers.) Wild Murray cod populations across their range suffer extremely severe infestations of Lernaea or [...] "anchor worm", a parasitic copepod vectored by introduced carp and that burrows into the skin of Murray cod. Lernaea puncture wounds are often secondarily infected by bacteria. Severe Lernaea infestations probably causes the death of many more adult Murray cod than commonly recognised. Ebner reports a young adult Murray cod seemingly killed by severe Lernaea infestation.|$|R

5000|$|The Tortus digital tribometer slip {{resistance}} test method {{is based on}} a proprietary or patented device, which makes it ineligible to become an ASTM standard. It is produced in the U.K., and is in a category of {{slip resistance}} tester devices known as [...] "drag-sled meters", which means that it travels across flooring under its own power at a constant speed with a piece of standardized rubber dragging on the flooring. The amount of friction created by this piece of rubber as it is dragged across the <b>flooring</b> (<b>dry</b> or wet) is recorded and calculated by the machine as it travels a predetermined path length. An average number of dynamic coefficient of friction (DCOF) is calculated by the machine after its run across the flooring has been completed. This is recorded as the [...] "DCOF", or the amount of friction necessary to drag (dynamic meaning [...] "in motion") the standardized rubber across the flooring. High numbers (e.g. above 0.50) indicate that it is difficult for the machine to drag the rubber across the flooring because it is anti-slip, and low numbers (e.g. below 0.50) means that the rubber easily slides across the flooring and is therefore slippery.|$|R

They tunnel into the wood and produce copious frass, which is often conspicuous {{on the outside of}} the affected branch. Many larvae often occur together in a single branch or log.|$|R
