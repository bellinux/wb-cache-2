The aim of the thesis is to survey the issue of <b>intermodal</b> <b>connection</b> with the ports, to evaluate the current status and future development options, including the barriers to this development. The result of the thesis is an analyzed current situation: the ports to which Czech Republic is connected have been determined as well as the modes of transport and the key players on the Czech market that provide the shipping services to the ports. A significant part of attention is paid to METRANS, a. s. which is the leading provider of intermodal transport services between Czech republic and the ports. A major problem associated with the development of combined transport is the harmonization of the conditions between road and rail transport. There is one chapter of the thesis which is devoted to this issue. Thanks to the information obtained from companies operating in the intermodal transport business, it was possible to calculate the costs related to the transport of the consignment by road and rail route, to highlight the problems in the daily operation of combined transport, to identify the weaknesses that may hinder the development of the METRANS or to bring other real outcomes...|$|E

Two distinct types of rail-air intermodal service are analyzed in this thesis. In transcontinental or international market rail can provide the short-to-mid distance 'feeder " leg to airport hub. Intercity trains could function as a comfortable, productive and reliable feeder service to airport hub with similar or even shorter trip time than feeder flights in short-mid distance corridor. This could not only enlarge the customer base for rail system, but also allow airports to release capacity both landside and airside. Better intermodal cooperation could also improve accessibility to intermediate regions where no aviation service is available. In large metro areas with multiple airports, a second type of intermodal cooperation is desirable, better rail connections to the urban core could provide faster and more reliable access/egress service to downtown residents than driving, taking a taxi, or riding the bus.

40|$|The {{intermodal}} hinterland {{transportation of}} maritime containers is {{under pressure from}} port authorities and shippers to achieve a more integrated, efficient network operation. Current optimisation methods in literature yield limited results in practice, though, as the transportation product structure limits the flexibility to optimise network logistics. Synchromodality aims to overcome this by a new product structure based on differentiation in price and lead time. Each product is considered as a fare class with a related service level, allowing to target different customer segments and to use revenue management for maximising revenue. However, higher priced fare classes come with tighter planning restrictions and must be carefully balanced with lower priced fare classes to match available capacity and optimise network utilisation. Based on the developments of intermodal networks in North West European, such as the network of European Gateway Services, the Cargo Fare Class Mix problem is proposed. Its purpose is to set limits for each fare class at a tactical level, such that the expected revenue is maximised, considering the available capacity at the operational level. Setting limits at the tactical level is important, as it reflects the necessity of long-term agreements between the transportation provider and its customers. A solution method for an intermodal corridor is proposed, considering a single <b>intermodal</b> <b>connection</b> towards a region with multiple destinations. The main purpose of the article {{is to show that}} using a limit on each fare class increases revenue and reliability, thereby outperforming existing fare class mix policies, such as Littlewood. </p...|$|E
40|$|In {{the time}} when the World can {{experience}} volatility of international trade due to World economic crisis, concentration of the shipping industry and liberalisation of transport markets, port competition is becoming fiercer over the time. In such an environment, freight forwarders’ role {{is becoming more and more}} important, representing a valuable link in the whole supply chain. This research attempts to analyse and benchmark port services based on the factors and criteria most important to freight forwarders’ port choice, the operational efficiency and performance benchmarking of container ports and terminals, situated in the area of the United Kingdom and Balkan Peninsula. It does so by applying different techniques, starting from questionnaire survey among freight forwarders in these regions in order to determine the most important port choice factors, followed by analytical benchmarking technique such as DEA to analyse impact of operating factors on port efficiency and concluded with productivity analysis to measure terminal productivity changes during, before and after the World economic crisis. The study found that region where freight forwarders are acting has impact on their port choice. Geographical location seems to be the most important factor while choosing a port, followed by terminal <b>intermodal</b> <b>connection</b> efficiency and reliability, frequency of ship calling, inland delivery cost, port accessibility, flexibility to answer freight forwarders demands and port working hours. Benchmarking analysis showed that most of the terminals from the sample are inefficient, where mainly larger terminals based in the UK depicted higher efficiency scores above 80 %. Study found terminal operational efficiency is positively related to both seaside and landside terminal connectivity and port customer service. Productivity analysis showed high volatility in productivity change during the World economic crisis, with overall productivity loss, suggesting that terminals were mainly focused on terminal expansion rather than rationalisation of input use.

40|$|Containers {{have become}} the {{standard}} for unitised cargo transport. In the past two decades, {{the emergence of the}} global economy has caused a boom in the volume of containers transported by sea. Maritime container transport can be divided into a global network of major shipping routes and numerous regional, short-sea services. In ports, container terminals link the different shipping lines and provide the <b>intermodal</b> <b>connection</b> between the maritime and continental transportation networks. On the major shipping routes, very large container ships operate the intercontinental services. Container terminals in gateway and hub ports, along these routes, annually handle throughputs of over 500, 000 TEU. The majority of these terminals is owned and operated by so called global terminal operators (GTO) that own and operate many terminals worldwide. Regional and short-sea services between regional and minor ports in the periphery of the network are operated by smaller vessels. For the majority of terminals in these ports, annual throughput is much less. Local, single terminal operators (STO) generally operate these container terminals. Public sector involvement is often large. Shipping lines are pressuring both larger and smaller terminals, to increase the level of services offered and, at the same time, reduce handling costs. Labour expenses take up a large part of those handling costs. For large terminals automated container handling has proven itself as a reliable and effective way to reduce operational costs. Especially in Europe, small and medium sized terminals face heavy competition. The number of ports that compete for the same hinterland is increasing. To stay ahead of the competition, terminals are forced to offer a very high level of services. Meanwhile, flexible routes of regional services makes business development forecasts uncertain. Investment risks are therefore high in this capital intensive industry. As a result conservativeness is considered a virtue among small and medium sized terminal operators, and scepticism towards innovative technology is widespread. The goal {{of this study is to}} inventory "off-the-shelf" automated container handling equipment and study the feasibility of automated container handling in small and medium sized terminals.

40|$|There are {{currently}} about 120 airport rail links existing or proposed to be constructed around the world. The {{growth in the}} number of airport rail links reflects the almost relentless growth in air travel and the associated worsening congestion and delays on both landside and airside of airports. Rail-Air Passenger Intermodal Development (RAPID) in the United States has lagged behind the world trend, especially in comparison with Europe and Japan. This paper consists of two tasks: to examine technical priorities for the competitiveness of rail a s a feeder to a irports, a nd to i dentify key b arriers a nd recommend changes for RAPID development in this nation. Having an effective <b>intermodal</b> <b>connection</b> has proved to be the prerequisite for the successfulness of RAPID. When such a connection is available, enhancing intermodal cooperation is likely to be more effective than operating high speed rail in terms of the competitiveness of railfor airport trips. The speed of trains only needs to be high enough to ensure door-to-door trip time advantages over highways and flights in short- to mid- distance corridors. All the necessary technical options for RAPID have been widely applied in the world for decades. Even without technical challenges, RAPID development might be expensive and complicated with with many stakeholders and interest groups directly and indirectly impacted. Lack of effective intermodal infrastructure has been the primary hurdle impeding RAPID development in this nation. Unbalanced development in this nation's intercity passenger transportation system has resulted in the inability of intercity railroads to promote RAPID and the unwillingness of air carriers to connect and cooperate with the rail system. (cont.) These problems make RAPID unlikely to be developed by relying solely on the private sector. Mode separation in the administrative framework and modal bias in policy generate further hurdles for RAPID from the public sector in terms of public funding, information, planning and cooperation. To succesfully achieve RAPID, the federal government must play a major role in terms of provding a) sufficient federal funding specifically for RAPID infrastructures and b) incentives to enhance the willingness of state and localities to support RAPID. The federal leadership and institutional support will also be necessary to increase modal integration to facilitate RAPID research, planning and decision making. by Dalong Shi. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Developments {{of the new}} ocean {{engineering}} technologies enhance the feasibility of the offshore port system construction projects. The offshore port systems have an increasing interest depending on ever-growing container trade and vessel size. In the literature, there are some existing proposals which aim to analyse the offshore port system in terms of technical and economic evaluation aspects. Although, applied examples of the offshore systems for liquid and dry bulk cargo shipping are in practice, there is no large scale implementation for container shipping industry. An ongoing study at University of Strathclyde examining location analysis of the offshore container port system is an inspiration of this research. According to this research point of view, offshore of West Coast of the North America may {{be considered as a}} potential location to construct a fixed or floating offshore container port system. In direction of this perspective, the target of this research work is to optimise door-to-door delivery of the container cargoes between several route alternatives. In this respect, container transport network for case of West North America Coast is analysed with the aid of the linear optimisation tools. The concept of offshore container port system is settled at the centre of the transportation network alternatives integrated to intermodal connections. By utilisation of an offshore port system, {{it would be possible to}} give a better logistical response to ship size enlargement trend of the liner container shipping industry. The adaptation of the short sea shipping and the <b>intermodal</b> <b>connection</b> alternatives to the offshore container port system concept have significant influence to optimise freight transport from shipper to consignee on the determined route alternatives. The objective function of the optimisation model aims to minimise time and cost of door-to-door transport for this specific case. Operational challenges helps to determine the constraints of the linear optimisation model. The assumed constraints for the mentioned optimisation problem are ship and port drafts, docking capacity of ports, intermodal integration limits, and maximum handling capacity of port equipment. The fundamental decision variables may be considered as speed, service frequency, port handling capacity, number of handling equipment, vehicle cargo capacities, and port prices affecting to reach time and cost based minimisation. The data collection is going to established based on real container traffic statistics and future forecasts. The present study targets to determine the impact of the proposed offshore container port on West Coast of North America. Therefore, it is going to be possible to provide a more energy efficient, environmentally friendly, and time and cost efficient freight transport through West Coast of North America...|$|E
