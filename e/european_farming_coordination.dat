40|$|The {{historical}} role of <b>European</b> <b>farming</b> {{in southern}} and central Africa {{is a delicate}} matter that has received {{a great deal of}} attention among scholars over the years. Going through this vast literature a striking consensus emerges: success or failure of <b>European</b> <b>farming</b> in southern Africa was to a large extent depending on their access and control over labour. These propositions have so far never been systematically and empirically tested. This paper is an attempt to do that by analyzing the ‘wage-burden’ European settler farmers faced. The wage-burden is identified by measuring wage shares (total amount paid in the form of wages as a share of total profits) on <b>European</b> <b>farms</b> in colonial Africa. Based on archival documents we construct time-series for value of output, transportation costs, investments and wage shares for European tobacco and tea farms in colonial Malawi. Our estimates show that the wage burden decreased significantly after 1930 s, i. e. the European farmers were able to capture a larger part of the rent over time. We argue that the developments cannot be explained by domestic colonial policies, but changes in regional migration patterns, which had a significant impact on the supply of farm labour...|$|R

40|$|Analysis of Financial Subsidies Allocated by the Common Agricultural Policy in <b>European</b> <b>Farms</b> in Reducing Economic-Territorial Inequalities by Indexes of Concentration. As a {{consequence}} of the European Union (EU) enlargement in 2004 there has been a reshaping of funds allocated by the EU both in favour of an endogenous rural development, part of Pillar 2 of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), and also in terms of direct payments towards ag-commodities financed by Pillar 1 of the CAP. The European Commission, in order to evaluate the impact, role and function of the CAP, has set up an annual survey on a sample of <b>European</b> <b>farms</b> belonging to the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN). By using the FADN dataset for the period 2004 - 2012 in 25 EU Member States, this paper has assessed by indexes of concentration whether funds allocated by Pillars 1 and 2 of the CAP have reduced economic disparities in some EU Member States. Findings have shown {{that there has been a}} drop of inequality distribution in terms of financial subsidies in <b>European</b> <b>farms</b> allocated to strengthen the rural development.

40|$|Abstract The present {{round of}} {{multilateral}} trade negotiations is still deadlocked over agricultural trade. The European Union (EU) is urged by its trading partners to open its agricultural markets. Economic evaluations of trade liberalisation scenarios unanimously conclude that a substantial opening of agricultural markets is required for a successful (welfare-improving) Doha Round. In this paper, we perform new evaluations to identify precisely {{the contributions of the}} <b>European</b> <b>farm</b> policy and to examine the robustness of these evaluations in the representation of this complex policy. Using the same specifications as in major previous studies, our first simulations show that the EU has a major responsibility in delivering significant gains to the developing countries. On the other hand, when we conduct the same experiments with a more relevant calibration and modelling of the <b>European</b> <b>farm</b> policy instruments, the gains that these developing countries may reap from the EU liberalisation are considerably reduced. Accordingly the current charge against the EU is simply inopportune. Copyright 2009 The Authors. Journal compilation 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. ...|$|R

40|$|Agricultural {{ecosystems}} produce food, fiber, and nonmarketed {{ecosystem services}} (ES). Agriculture also typically involves high negative external costs associated with, for example, fossil fuel use. We estimated, via field-scale ecological monitoring and economic value-transfer methods, {{the market and}} nonmarket ES value of a combined food and energy (CFE) agro-ecosystem that simultaneously produces food, fodder, and bioenergy. Such novel CFE agro-ecosystems can provide a significantly increased net crop, energy, and nonmarketed ES compared with conventional agriculture, and require markedly less fossil-based inputs. Extrapolated to the European scale, the value of nonmarket ES from the CFE system exceeds current <b>European</b> <b>farm</b> subsidy payments. Such integrated food and bioenergy systems can thus provide environmental value for money for <b>European</b> Union <b>farming</b> and nonfarming communities...|$|R

40|$|The {{historical}} role of <b>European</b> <b>farming</b> {{in southern}} and central Africa {{has received a}} great deal of attention among scholars over the years. A striking consensus emerges in the scholarly literature, namely that the success or failure of <b>European</b> <b>farming</b> in southern Africa was to a large extent dependent upon the colonizers’ access to and control over cheap labour, which they in turn could only access through strong support of the colonial state. Yet, these propositions have so far not been systematically and empirically tested. This paper is a first attempt to do that by analysing the ‘wage-burden’ European settler farmers faced. The wage-burden is identified by measuring wage shares (total amount paid in the form of wages as a share of total profits) on <b>European</b> <b>farms</b> in colonial Africa. Based on archival documents, we construct time-series for value of output, transportation costs, investments in agriculture, and wages paid for the European tobacco and tea sector in colonial Malawi. Our results contradict both previous research on settler colonialism in Africa and the historiography of Nyasaland. Our estimates show that settler farming did not collapse in the 1930 s as commonly assumed. On the contrary, the value of production on both tobacco and tea farms increased significantly. And so did the settler farmers’ capacity to capture the profits, which was manifest in a declining wage share over time. In contrast with previous research we argue that the declining wage share cannot be explained by domestic colonial policies but rather through changes in regional migration patterns, and global commodity markets. Migration patterns had a significant impact on the supply of farm labour and global commodity markets influenced value of production. Market forces rather than colonial policies shaped the development trajectory of settler farming in Nyasaland...|$|R
30|$|This seems {{important}} because {{of at least}} two main reasons. The first is the need to enlarge the scope of analysis in agricultural economics by considering the relevant changes of the relationships among the agents within the agribusiness sector. The second is the need to rethink the potential role of the Common Agricultural Policy in driving such processes. This is because these will have relevant implications for the economic performance and sustainability of the <b>European</b> <b>farming</b> sector.|$|R
40|$|The {{advent of}} {{biofuels}} {{offers a new}} opportunity for agriculture to contribute to society by reducing trade rivalry.

30|$|In this perspective, it is {{economically}} {{relevant to}} look at the farmers’ choice between committing themselves to the greening crop diversification requirements and giving up part of the direct support to their income. According to an evaluation of the European Commission (based on the original proposal), the greening impact on <b>European</b> <b>farms</b> income is relatively low, 43 euro per hectare on the average (European Commission 2011 a, b). Nevertheless, this amount can widely vary depending on local features, crops profitability and structural characteristics of farms (Cardillo et al., 2012).|$|R
