50|$|If no {{printer port}} is present at 0x3BC, the second port {{in the row}} (0x378) becomes logical {{parallel}} port 1 and 0x278 becomes logical parallel port 2 for the BIOS. Sometimes, printer ports are <b>jumpered</b> to share an interrupt despite having their own IO addresses (i.e. only one can be used interrupt-driven at a time). In some cases, the BIOS supports a fourth printer port as well, but the base address for it differs significantly between vendors. Since the reserved entry for a fourth logical printer port in the BIOS Data Area (BDA) is shared with other uses on PS/2 machines and with S3 compatible graphics cards, it typically requires special drivers in most environments.Under DR-DOS 7.02 the BIOS port assignments can be changed and overridden using the LPT1, LPT2, LPT3 (and optionally LPT4) CONFIG.SYS directives.|$|E
5000|$|All TI-99 models, {{from the}} {{earliest}} TI-99/4 to the unreleased TI-99/2 and TI-99/8, include plug and play support for all peripherals. Device drivers (called [...] "Device Service Routines", or DSRs) are built into ROMs in the hardware; when a new card was inserted, it is immediately available for any software which needed or wanted to use it. All device access utilize a generic file-based I/O mechanism, allowing new devices to be added without updating software to use it. The Communications Register Unit (CRU) can address 4096 devices; however, each TI card runs at a hard-wired address on the CRU bus, and so multiple cards of the same type cannot be supported without modification. The only official card known to be modifiable is the RS-232 card, which supports two different base addresses. This allows the system to support four RS-232 ports and two parallel printer ports. Four-line BBSes were being run, using properly <b>jumpered</b> serial cards, on TI-99/4A systems {{as recently as the}} mid-1990s.|$|E
50|$|Some {{documentation}} may {{refer to}} setting the <b>jumpers</b> to on, off, closed, or open.

40|$|A hanging <b>jumper</b> beam of a {{transmission}} tower is adopted as a countermeasure against a short fault of <b>jumper</b> conductors under strong winds. However {{it is thought}} that the hanging <b>jumper</b> beam may cause the vibration of transmission tower members due to its weight when the hanging <b>jumper</b> beam starts to vibrate under strong winds. The authors have conducted an excitation test of a strain transmission tower with the hanging <b>jumper</b> beam to comprehend the dynamic behaviors of the hanging <b>jumper</b> beam. In this paper the effects of the oscillation of hanging <b>jumper</b> beam on side members are investigated based on the excitation test data, and the information for estimating the vibration of the hanging <b>jumper</b> beam under a string wind is organized...|$|R

5000|$|When a <b>jumper</b> {{is placed}} over {{two or more}} <b>jumper</b> pins, an {{electrical}} connection is made between them, and the equipment is thus instructed to activate certain settings accordingly. For example, with older PC systems, CPU speed and voltage settings were often made by setting <b>jumpers.</b> Informally, technicians often call setting <b>jumpers</b> [...] "strapping". To adjust the SCSI ID <b>jumpers</b> on a hard drive, for example, is to [...] "strap it up".|$|R

Prior to the commission's disbanding in 2005, Geoff Clark, the chairman of ATSIC at the time, removed the framed <b>jumper</b> from the commission's offices in Canberra {{to his home in}} Warrnambool, Victoria. Clark was forced to return the <b>jumper</b> to Winmar, which was later donated to the National Museum of Australia, where it featured in Off the Walls, an exhibit of Indigenous Australian art. In May 2012, the <b>jumper</b> was auctioned by Sotheby's, but was passed in after the bidding reached A$95,000. In September of the same year, Museum Victoria purchased the <b>jumper</b> for $100,000, with the intention to display it at the First Peoples exhibition at Melbourne Museum in July 2013. However, the authenticity of the <b>jumper</b> has been questioned, with the St Kilda Football Club published a statement in March 2005 suggesting that the <b>jumper</b> given to ATSIC {{may not have been the}} actual <b>jumper</b> worn during the game, citing differences between sponsors' logos present on the <b>jumper.</b> Similar questions were raised prior to the <b>jumper's</b> auction in 2012.|$|R
