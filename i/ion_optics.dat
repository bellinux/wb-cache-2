50|$|The <b>ion</b> <b>optics</b> are {{constantly}} bombarded {{by a small}} amount of secondary ions and erode or wear away, thus reducing engine efficiency and life. Ion engines {{need to be able to}} run efficiently and continuously for years. Several techniques were used to reduce erosion; most notable was switching to a different propellant. Mercury or caesium atoms were used as propellants during tests in the 1960s and 1970s, but these propellants adhered to, and eroded the grids. Xenon atoms, on the other hand, are far less corrosive, and became the propellant of choice for virtually all ion thruster types. NASA has demonstrated continuous operation of NSTAR engines for over 16,000 hours (1.8 years), and tests are still ongoing for double this lifetime. Electrostatic ion thrusters have also achieved a specific impulse of 30-100 kN·s/kg, better than most other ion thruster types.

5000|$|Structures for {{lossless}} ion manipulations (SLIM) are a {{new form}} of <b>ion</b> <b>optics,</b> developed by Richard D. Smith and coworkers at PNNL, and generally fabricated from arrays of electrodes on evenly spaced planar surfaces, to which various rf and dc electric potentials can be applied, and used to enable a broad range of ion manipulations, such as separations based upon ion mobility spectrometry, reactions (unimolecular, ion-molecule, and ion-ion), and storage (i.e. ion trapping). [...] In SLIM ions can move in the space between the two surfaces, in directions controlled using electric fields, and also moved between different of multi-level SLIM, as can be constructed from a stack of PCBs. The lossless nature of SLIM is derived from the use of rf electric fields, and particularly the pseudo potential derived from the inhomogeneous electric fields resulting from rf of appropriate frequency applied to multiple adjacent electrodes, and that serves to prevent ions from closely approaching the electrodes and surface where loss would conventionally be expected. SLIM are generally used in conjunction with mass spectrometry for analytical applications.|$|E
