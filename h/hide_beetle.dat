40|$|The {{influence}} of male age on reproductive success after a single mating has been explored widely; however, {{few studies have}} investigated whether quantitative or qualitative differences in male sperm {{are responsible for the}} observed patterns. Moreover, the role of male age on sperm competitive ability has been largely ignored. We examined the importance of male age on the probability and amount of sperm transferred during a single mating and explored whether sperm competitive ability varies with male age in the <b>hide</b> <b>beetle</b> Dermestes maculatus, a species where sperm viability does not vary with male age. We also investigated whether sperm transfer rates varied with female age. We found that the probability of sperm transfer and the amount of sperm transferred varied with male, but not female, age. All males performed behaviorally successful copulations, but intermediate-age and old males were more likely to transfer sperm successfully and also transferred a greater quantity of sperm than young males. Old males were less likely to transfer sperm than intermediate-age males, but if they did transfer sperm successfully, they transferred comparable amounts. Sperm competitive ability varied with male age and reflected the quantity of sperm transferred. On average, intermediate-age males achieved greater fertilization success when competing against young or old males than when competing against other intermediate-age males. Old males were poor competitors against intermediate-age males, but they achieved significantly higher rates of fertilization when competing against young males.

40|$|Skins {{and hides}} are {{perishable}} {{resources that can}} be damaged by parasitic diseases and human error, which result in downgrading or rejection. This {{study was conducted to}} identify defect types and to determine their prevalence in pickled sheep and wet blue goat skins and wet blue hides. Each selected skin or hide was examined for defects in natural light and the defects were graded according to established quality criteria in Ethiopian standard manuals. Major defects were captured by digital photography. The major pre-slaughter defects included scratches (64. 2 %), cockle (ekek) (32. 8 %), wounds or scars (12. 6 %), lesions from pox or lumpy skin disease (6. 1 %), poor substance (5 %), branding marks (2. 3 %) and tick bites (1. 5 %). The presence of grain scratches in wet blue hides (76. 3 %) was significantly higher than in pickled sheep (67. 2 %) and wet blue goat (59. 1 %) skins. The major slaughter defects included flay cuts or scores, holes, poor pattern and vein marks, with a higher occurrence in wet blue goat skins (28. 7 %; P < 0. 001) than in wet blue hides (22. 8 %) and pickled sheep skins (11. 1 %). The most prevalent postslaughter defects were grain cracks (14. 9 %), <b>hide</b> <b>beetle</b> damage (8 %), damage caused by heat or putrefaction (3. 7 %) and machine-induced defects (0. 5 %).

40|$|ABSTRACT Air {{temperature}} and relative humidity (RH) in the manure pits of five central Pennsylvania high-rise poultry houses were measured {{for at least}} one year to evaluate the role of the pit environment in the development of manure breeding flies and litter beetles. Pit air temperatures had weekly means ranging between 18. 1 and 22. 2 C. Seasonal temperature trends were similar at all farms, decreasing in winter and rising in summer. Maximum pit temperatures ranged from 31. 7 to 33. 3 C and minimum temperatures from. 6 to 5. 6 C, but these extremes were rare. Three houses had weekly mean RH ca 65 %, one ca 61 %, and one ca 72 %. No seasonal RH trends were evident. Daily temperature fluctuations were lowest at ca 0600 to 0700 h, peaked ca 1700 h, and varied inversely with RH. Pit air temperatures dropped below house fly reproductive thresholds for several weeks during the winter, but were adequate for their survival all year around. Manure temperatures were affected by the shape of the manure pile, depth of the manure, and seasonal air temperature patterns. Manure temperatures differed significantly between houses with either shallow (without scraper boards, x ca 16 to 19 C) or deep (with scraper boards, x ca 30 to 40 C) manure profiles. Shallow manure profile temperatures severely limit fly larvae and litter beetle development.

Each of the plant materials was pulverized into powder and applied as a mix of 1 ml of oil and plant powder at 2. 5, 5. 0, 7. 5 and 10. 0 g per 100 g of dried fish, and allowed to dry for 6 h. Each of the four oil-mixed powder treatments evoked significant (P < 05) mortalities of the two insects compared with the control (oil only) at 1, 3 and 7 days post treatment. The oil-powder mixture dosages did not prevent insect egg hatchability but while the emergent larvae on the treated samples died, the emergent larvae in the control survived into adults. The application of oil-mixed powders effectively suppressed {{the emergence of the}} larvae of the beetles. Similarly, each of the oil-powder mixtures significantly reduced weight loss in smoked fish that were exposed to D. maculatus and N. rufipes when compared to the control (P < 05).

40|$|Polyandry-induced sperm {{competition}} {{is assumed to}} impose costs on males through reduced per capita paternity success. In contrast, studies focusing on the consequences of polyandry for females report increased oviposition rates and fertility. For these species, there is potential for the increased female fecundity associated with polyandry to offset the costs to males of shared paternity. We tested this hypothesis by comparing the proportion and number of offspring sired by males mated with monandrous and polyandrous females in the <b>hide</b> <b>beetle,</b> Dermestes maculates, both for males mating with different females and for males remating with the same female. In 4 mating treatments, monandrous females mated either once or twice with the same male and polyandrous females mated either twice with 2 different males or thrice with 2 males (where 1 male mated twice). Polyandrous and twice-mating monandrous females displayed greater fecundity and fertility than singly mating monandrous females. Moreover, males remated to the same female had greater paternity regardless of whether that female mated with another male. In both polyandrous treatments, male mating order did not affect paternity success. Finally, although the proportion of eggs sired decreased if a male mated with a polyandrous female, multiply mating females or females that remated with a previous mate laid significantly more eggs and thus {{the actual number of}} eggs sired was comparable. Thus, males do not necessarily accrue a net fitness loss when mating with polyandrous females. This may explain the absence of any obvious defensive paternity-protection traits in hide beetles and other species. 8 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Models of age-related mate choice predict female {{preference}} for older males {{as they have}} proven survival ability. However, these models rarely address differences in sperm age and male mating history when evaluating the potential benefits to females from older partners. We used a novel experimental design to assess simultaneously {{the relative importance of}} these three parameters in the <b>hide</b> <b>beetle,</b> Dermestes maculatus. In a two-part experiment we first explored age-related male mating success and subsequently examined the consequences of male age, sperm age and male mating history on female fecundity and fertilization success. In a competitive mating environment, intermediate-age males gained significantly higher mating success than younger or older males. To test the consequences for females of aged-related male mating success, a second set of females were mated to males varying in age (young, intermediate-age and old), in numbers of matings and in timing of the most recent mating. We found that male age {{had a significant impact on}} female fecundity and fertilization success. Females mated to intermediate-age males laid more eggs and attained consistently higher levels of fertilization success than females with young and old mates. A male's previous mating history determined his current reproductive effort; virgin males spent longer in copula than males with prior mating opportunities. However, differences in copulation duration did not translate into increased fecundity or fertilization success. There was also little evidence to suggest that fertilization success was dependent on the age of a male's sperm. The experiment highlights the potential direct benefits accrued by females through mating with particular aged males. Such benefits are largely ignored by traditional viability models of age-related male mating success...|$|E
50|$|Dermestes maculatus, <b>hide</b> <b>beetles,</b> {{also have}} the {{potential}} to offer investigators an estimation of the time since death in homicide or questionable cases.

Adults were exposed for 4, 8, 14, and 24 h, and then daily for 7 d, on untreated dishes or dishes treated with Temprid. In the untreated dishes, mortality of C. ferrugineus and O. surinamensis was lower when food was present, but food did not affect mortality of the other species. Presence of food did not affect mortality of any of the species tested in the treated dishes. C. ferrugineus, O. surinamensis, and the two psocid species were very susceptible to Temprid, with mortality of 97 - 100 % after 7 d of exposure. In contrast, D. maculatus, T. castaneum, and T. confusum were tolerant to Temprid, as mortality did not exceed 57, 25, and 17 %, respectively, at the 7 -d exposure. A separate series of similar bioassays with Tempo, a formulation that contains 11. 8 % beta-cyfluthrin alone, which was applied at the same dose rate as Temprid, was conducted using O. surinamensis and T. castaneum as the target insect species, and results showed that Tempo was at least as effective as Temprid.

40|$|Abstract Introduction The <b>hide</b> <b>beetle</b> Dermestes maculatus (Coleoptera: Dermestidae) feeds as {{an adult}} and larva on decomposing animal remains and {{can also be found}} on human corpses. Therefore, {{forensic}} entomological questions with regard to when and how the first receptive females appear on carcasses are important, as the developmental stages of their larvae can be used to calculate the post-mortem interval. To date, we know that freshly emerged males respond to the cadaver odour of post-bloated carcasses (approximately 9 days after death at T mean = 27 °C), being attracted by benzyl butyrate. This component occurs at its highest concentration at this stage of decay. The aim of our {{study was to determine the}} principle of attraction of virgin females to the feeding and breeding substrate. For this purpose, we tested the response of these females to headspace samples of piglet cadavers and male sex pheromones [(Z 9) -unsaturated fatty acid isopropyl esters] in a Y-olfactometer. Because we expected that such an odour combination is of importance for virgin female attraction, we tested the following two questions: 1) Are virgin female hide beetles attracted by a combination of cadaver odour and male sex pheromones? 2) During which decomposition stage do the first virgin females respond to cadaver odour when combined with male sex pheromones? Results We found that young virgin females were attracted to the cadaver by a combination of cadaver odour and male sex pheromones. Neither cadaver odour alone nor male sex pheromones alone was significantly more attractive than a solvent control. Our results also gave a weak indication that the first young virgin females respond as early as the post-bloating stage to its associated decomposition odour when combined with male sex pheromones. Conclusions Our results indicate that freshly emerged males possibly respond to cadaver odour and visit carcasses before virgin females. Being attracted to cadavers when male sex pheromone is perceived as well, virgin females can optimise their reproductive possibilities. </p...|$|E
40|$|Phoretic mites {{are likely}} the most {{abundant}} arthropods found on carcases and corpses. They outnumber their scavenger carriers in both number and diversity. Many phoretic mites travel on scavenger insects and are highly specific; they will arrive on a particular species of host and no other. Because of this, they may be useful as trace indicators of their carriers even when their carriers are absent. Phoretic mites can be valuable markers of time. They are usually found in a specialised transitional transport or dispersal stage, often moulting and transforming to adults shortly after arrival on a carcase or corpse. Many are characterised by faster development and generation cycles than their carriers. Humans are normally unaware, but we too carry mites; they are skin mites that are present in our clothes. More than 212 phoretic mite species associated with carcases {{have been reported in}} the literature. Among these, mites belonging to the Mesostigmata form the dominant group, represented by 127 species with 25 phoretic mite species belonging to the family Parasitidae and 48 to the Macrochelidae. Most of these mesostigmatids are associated with particular species of flies or carrion beetles, though some are associated with small mammals arriving during the early stages of decomposition. During dry decay, members of the Astigmata are more frequently found; 52 species are phoretic on scavengers, and the majority of these travel on late-arriving scavengers such as <b>hide</b> <b>beetles,</b> skin beetles and moths. Several species of carrion beetles can visit a corpse simultaneously, and each may carry 1 - 10 species of phoretic mites. An informative diversity of phoretic mites may be found on a decaying carcass at any given time. The composition of the phoretic mite assemblage on a carcass might provide valuable information about the conditions of and time elapsed since death...|$|R

The reserve is composed of land owned by the US Bureau of Land Management, US Bureau of Reclamation, Quail Ridge Wilderness Conservation, California Department of Fish and Game, and UC Regents. The University NRS continues to expand on the reserve as private property owners become willing to sell parcels, thereby increasing the size of this amazing protected wildlife and ecological study site. Vegetation on Quail Ridge consists primarily of mixed oak woodland, riparian, native and non-native grasslands, and chamise chaparral. The illustrated beetles and species and family list in this book are the product of a beetle survey conducted on the reserve. Beetles were collected by black light at the reserve field station and in Decker Canyon, on flowering vegetation, under logs and other harborage, and along roadsides during daytime and evening hours and reared from logs.

50|$|Larder beetles are {{infrequent}} household pests. Adults and larvae feed on raw {{skins and}} <b>hides.</b> Adult larder <b>beetles</b> are generally 1/3 to 3/8 {{of an inch}} long and are dark brown with a broad, pale yellow spotted band across the upper portion of the elytra. There are three black dots arranged in a triangle shape on each wing. The sternum and legs of the larder beetle are covered in fine, yellow setae. Adult larder beetles are typically found outdoors in protected areas during the winter, but during the {{spring and early summer}} they enter buildings. Females lay approximately 135 eggs near a food source, and the eggs will hatch in about 12 days. The life cycle of larder beetles lasts around 40 to 50 days.|$|R

40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} to the Faculty of Science, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. 25 th of July 2013, Johannesburg. The cave deposits at Malapa, on the Malapa Nature Reserve, Cradle of Humankind World Heritage Site, Gauteng Province, South Africa, have yielded the remains of two extremely well-preserved hominins (Australopithecus sediba) and associated fauna, dated by U/Pb methods and palaeomagnetism to 1. 977 - 1. 8 Ma. The state of preservation of the hominins {{and some of the}} non-hominin material, characterised by complete and near complete elements, antimeric sets of bones, specimens in articulation, and well-preserved bone surfaces, is remarkable in the context of Plio-Pleistocene fossil assemblages accumulated in caves, and indicates a unique combination of taphonomic processes, not yet observed in contemporaneous cave deposits in the region. A comprehensive approach, including palaeontological, physical, and spatial analyses of the hominins and associated fauna was undertaken to determine, describe and interpret the taphonomy of the faunal material, with particular reference to the holotype and paratype of Au. sediba, Malapa Hominin 1 (MH 1) and Malapa Hominin 2 (MH 2). An innovative combination of Computed-Tomography (CT), micro-CT scanning and virtual reconstruction techniques was applied to create a 3 D model of a selected area of the Malapa cave, with renderings of the two near-complete Au. sediba skeletons. The original burial position of the hominins was reconstructed, which necessitated the refitting of ex situ fossils into in situ deposits. The spatial distribution and orientation of the hominin remains illustrate a very low degree of dispersal of the bones, indicative of very little disruption between death and burial, due to an absence of damage by scavengers and possible natural mummification. The very few carnivore-damaged bones and relative abundance of complete and/or articulated specimens, the presence of antimeric sets of bones in the faunal assemblage, as well as the diversity of the faunal spectrum, and the significant percentage of animals with climbing proclivities (such as carnivores and hominins) indicate {{that the majority of the}} faunal material recovered was most likely accumulated via a natural death trap. Their bodies came to rest in a deep area of the cave system with restricted access to iii scavengers. Skeletons and bones accumulated in a talus cone below a vertical shaft. There, they decomposed, and became buried without major disruption by biotic or abiotic agents. A new forensic approach, referred to as palaeoforensic taphonomy, was followed in each step of the taphonomic analysis of the two hominins in order to reconstruct the processes of decay, disarticulation, burial and preservation. Results show that both individuals did probably not enter the cave system at the same time. They reached skeletonization and were slightly weathered before final burial, indicating several years of exposure before burial. Insects proved to be the primary modifiers of the hominin remains, pre- and post-depositional with <b>hide</b> <b>beetles</b> (Omorgus squalidus) providing the closest match for some of the fossil modifications observed. Based on the high number of articulated remains, the absence of preferential orientation for the elongated bones and of significant movement of the hominin remains inside the deposit, the debris flow hypothesis that was previously proposed as the principal agent to explain the burial of the hominins and other well-preserved animals is challenged. Evidence of natural mummification before burial for MH 1 and MH 2 suggests the possible preservation of soft tissue. The innovative 3 D techniques applied in this research to conduct the spatial analysis of the fossils proved useful to address taphonomic questions, and will serve as a guide for future excavations of the Malapa in situ deposits, especially for locating the missing skeletal elements of MH 1 and MH 2...|$|R
5000|$|The San Francisco {{setting was}} chosen to allow an {{elaborate}} comic spoof of the San Francisco car chase in the hit 1968 movie Bullitt. Bogdanovich claims the rousing chase sequence accounted for one-fourth of the film's $4 million budget. The classic [...] "plate glass" [...] scene, in which O'Neal and Streisand are pedaling on a stolen grocery store delivery bicycle, was filmed at Balboa and 23rd Avenue in the Richmond District. In another scene, their out of control bike ends up going down Clay Street in Chinatown. The Volkswagen Beetle is stolen from the curb in front of Saint Peter and Paul church at Washington Square park, and the <b>Beetle</b> <b>hides</b> on a car carrier on Sacramento St. just west of Van Ness Avenue {{in an area where}} many car dealerships were once located. The production did not have permission from the city to drive cars down the concrete steps in Alta Plaza Park in San Francisco; these were badly damaged during filming and still show the scars today. At the end of the car chase, almost everyone ends up foundering in San Francisco Bay — except O'Neal and Streisand, comfortably afloat in their Volkswagen Beetle. This was a play on Volkswagen print and TV ads from a few years earlier that championed the Beetle's remarkable (and real) ability to float on water. During the making of this scene, the actor Sorrell Booke almost drowned in the Bay.|$|R
