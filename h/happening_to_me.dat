Jack Thayer compared it to the sound of [...] "locusts on a summer night", while George Rheims, who jumped moments before Titanic sank, described it as [...] "a dismal moaning sound which I won't ever forget; it came from those poor people who were floating around, calling for help.

500|$|From April 1888, Frederick {{became so}} weak {{he was unable}} to walk, and was largely {{confined}} to his bed; his continual coughing brought up large quantities of pus. In early June, the cancer spread to and perforated his esophagus, preventing him from eating. He suffered from bouts of vomiting and ran high fevers, but remained alert enough to write a last diary entry on 11 June: [...] "What's <b>happening</b> <b>to</b> <b>me?</b> I must get well again; I have so much to do!" [...] Frederick III died in Potsdam at 11:30 a.m. on 15 June 1888, and was succeeded by his 29-year-old son Wilhelm II. Frederick is buried in a mausoleum attached to the Friedenskirche in Potsdam. After his death, William Ewart Gladstone described him as the [...] "Barbarossa of German liberalism". Empress Victoria went on to continue spreading Frederick's thoughts and ideals throughout Germany, but no longer had power within the government.|$|E
500|$|Further {{disappointment}} followed as the American 4 x 100m relay team, with Gay as anchor, {{failed to}} qualify for the final. Darvis Patton and Gay failed to pass on the baton in the heat. Gay personally took responsibility for the dropped baton but Patton denied this was true, saying [...] "That's Tyson Gay. He's a humble guy, but I know it's my job to get the guy the baton and I didn't do that." [...] After stating his desire to win four Olympic gold medals (by adding the 400 metres to his repertoire) earlier in the year, Gay finished the 2008 Olympics without a single medal. Having failed to reach the finals of the 100m sprint or relay, he reflected upon his failure to make the podium in Beijing: [...] " [...] then I went to grab it and there was nothing.

She later worked on these tracks in Trinidad, where she absorbed influences from the country's love of soca music. The lyrics of [...] "Boyz" [...] {{deal with the}} artist's time in Jamaica, and reference Jamaican dance moves. The song [...] "Hussel" [...] began as an image in M.I.A.'s head of refugees being smuggled in boats, which she expressed musically by imagining how [...] "if they banged that beat {{on the side of}} a boat, what would it sound like? [...] That's why it's all echo-y and submarine-y". The sounds on the intro were recorded from Keralan [...] fishermen chanting as they pull their fishing boats into the water. [...] "World Town" [...] used instrumentation from the temple music she recalled waking up to as a child in Sri Lanka. After playing the track to children in Liberia, she expressed a desire to record a video for the song there. M.I.A.'s [...] "flat, unaffected vocals and delivery of lyrics" [...] on some songs drew comparisons to British post-punk bands such as Delta 5 and The Slits. She says it [...] "was just what was <b>happening</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> naturally...I wanted it to be difficult and raw and not get into it so much".|$|E

But then you turn it on during the crisis, and they're like, 'We don't know what's going on!' It'd be like turning on The Weather Channel in a hurricane, and they're just doing this: 'Why am I wet?

Alexandra was strikingly beautiful, tall and slim and Konstantin was immediately eager to marry her.

2500|$|On October 23, 1971, Rîmaru {{was taken}} to Jilava prison in a van. He had to be dragged {{to the place of}} {{execution}} from the moment he left the van. Until he was dead, he was in a rage and vigorously tried to escape. The three officers charged with shooting him tied him to a post in the prison yard. Asked, in accordance with the law, if he had any last wishes, he said no. The men noticed him become more agitated, trying to bite off his clothes and twisting around the post. He yelled, [...] "Call my father, so he can see what's <b>happening</b> <b>to</b> <b>me!</b> Make him come! He's the only guilty one!" [...] and [...] "I want to live!" [...] Because of his constant movement, it was difficult to aim accurately and in the end, his backside was riddled with bullets (as he had turned all the way round). He was buried in the town cemetery; his grave remains unmarked.|$|E
2500|$|The {{influence}} of Iberian sculpture {{became an issue}} in 1939, when Alfred Barr claimed that the primitivism of the Demoiselles derived from the art of Côte d'Ivoire and the French Congo. Picasso insisted that the editor of his [...] "catalogue raissonne", Christian Zervos, publish a disclaimer: the 'Demoiselles,' he said, owed nothing to African art, everything to the reliefs from Osuna {{that he had seen}} in the Louvre a year or so before. Nonetheless, he is known to have seen African tribal masks while working on the painting, during a visit to the Ethnographic Museum of the Trocadero with Andre Malraux in June 1907, about which he later said [...] "When I went to the Trocadero, it was disgusting. The flea market, the smell. I was all alone. I wanted to get away, but I didn't leave. I stayed, I stayed. I understood that it was very important. Something was <b>happening</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> right. The masks weren't like any other pieces of sculpture, not at all. They were magic things." [...] Maurice de Vlaminck is often credited with introducing Picasso to African sculpture of Fang extraction in 1904.|$|E

It (the murder) is the only way of saving a situation that is almost hopeless.... You will serve as the lure.... Of course, not a word to anyone." [...] A frightened Irina suddenly backed out of the plan on 3 December 1916: [...] "I know that if I come, I shall certainly get sick... You don't know how things are with me.

2500|$|Giving {{the order}} to start {{production}} in spring 1962, Fellini signed deals with his producer Rizzoli, fixed dates, had sets constructed, cast Mastroianni, Anouk Aimée, and Sandra Milo in lead roles, and did screen tests at the Scalera Studios in Rome. He hired cinematographer Gianni Di Venanzo, among key personnel. But apart from naming his hero Guido Anselmi, he still couldn't decide what his character did for a living. The crisis {{came to a head}} in April when, sitting in his Cinecittà office, he began a letter to Rizzoli confessing he had [...] "lost his film" [...] and had to abandon the project. Interrupted by the chief machinist requesting he celebrate the launch of 8½, Fellini put aside the letter and went on the set. Raising a toast to the crew, he [...] "felt overwhelmed by shame… I was in a no exit situation. I was a director who wanted to make a film he no longer remembers. And lo and behold, at that very moment everything fell into place. I got straight {{to the heart of the}} film. I would narrate everything that had been <b>happening</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I would make a film telling the story of a director who no longer knows what film he wanted to make".|$|E
2500|$|Prior to obtaining {{his record}} deal, Mika sent demos to many record {{companies}} in Britain, but was never signed. One record label in particular claimed that Mika {{had a good}} voice, but insisted he write more conventional songs like Robbie Williams {{in order to become}} more commercial. Mika rejected this advice. [...] The song [...] "Grace Kelly" [...] was inspired by these problems. In 2006 Mika signed with Island Records and began recording his debut album. His musical influences are based in classical music. Before Mika released his debut album he promised the media that [...] "It was a magical world that you could live in. A parallel universe for people that is illusory and enchanting and amazing." [...] Some songs on the album are sexually ambiguous, prompting some questioning regarding Mika's sexuality. On this, Mika comments that he has no taboos about what he can use to tell a story or what stories he can actually tell. He believes that sexualizing music is great, but politically sexualizing music and making the artist's sexuality the defining point of someone's music is [...] "boring". He says about his own sexuality: [...] "...laying myself out on the table to almost a tabloid level and kind of sharing my entire personal life, I'm really not into that." [...] The songs on the album have different subjects. [...] "Grace Kelly", as stated before, is about the struggle of getting a record deal. Mika stated that the song is a very important song on the album mostly because:"...it's a flagpole for the record in terms of lyrical content and the whole pop vision I wanted to get across." [...] The cover for the album and booklet was designed by Mika's sister, Yasmine, who works under the pen name DaWack, Richard Hogg and Mika himself. In March 2007 the album was released in the United States. Before its release there was much publicity about the album, mainly due to its success in Europe. Mika commented on the hype by saying: [...] "I think I'm lucky. Hype can be good and hype can be bad. The good thing that's <b>happening</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> is that the hype is about the project, it's about the music ... I'm not the son of anyone famous, I haven't really slept with anyone particularly well known ... it's really just about music, and that's something I think is very healthy." ...|$|E
