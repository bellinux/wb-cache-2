40|$|A modular and {{reconfigurable}} hardware {{platform for}} analog optoelectronic signal acquisition is presented. Its intended application is for {{fiber optic sensing}} in electronic musical interfaces, however the flexible design enables its use {{with a wide range}} of analog and digital sensors. Multiple gain and multiplexing stages as well as programmable analog and digital hardware blocks allow for the acquisition, processing, and communication of single-ended and differential signals. Along with a <b>hub</b> <b>board,</b> multiple acquisition boards can be connected to modularly extend the system’s capabilities to suit the needs of the application. Fiber optic sensors and their application in DMIs are briefly discussed, as well as the use of the hardware platform with specific musical interfaces...|$|E
50|$|Update Channel Interface {{is a set}} of 10 {{differential}} signal pairs that interconnect two slots. Which slots are interconnected depends on the particular backplane design. These are signals commonly used to interconnect two <b>hub</b> <b>boards,</b> or redundant processor boards.|$|R

Players take turns moving their pieces around the Trivial Pursuit board answering questions in six different categories to win one differently colored [...] "pie piece" [...] in each category.

5000|$|Located on a {{triangular}} {{tract of land}} bounded by Main Street, Amherst Street and Parker Avenue, Amherst Street station {{is one of only}} four stations that does not offer an off-road bus loop, requiring passengers to board/debark using curbside stops (the other three being Humboldt-Hospital station, located 5,808 feet south, Summer-Best station, located 9,504 feet south and Allen/Medical Campus station, located 16,896 feet south). When the station opened in May 1985, bus routes were modified to stop on one of the three sides of the station. Route 23 buses heading toward Bailey/Abbott Loop and route 32 buses heading towards Black Rock/Riverside Transit <b>Hub</b> do not <b>board</b> at the curb on the same side as the station, which is served by three bus routes: ...|$|R
40|$|The {{upgraded}} HADES experiment {{will perform}} the measurements with heavy collision systems (up to Au+Au) at SIS 18 and then {{will move to}} the upcoming FAIR accelerator complex. The HADES Data Acquisition System combines readout electronics and TRB-Net [1] with off-the-shelf computers in a parallel architecture interconnected with Ethernet. The complete data-flow breaks down into the following elements: from the Front-Ends the data is transported over TRB-Net via optical 2 Gb/s links to <b>HUB</b> 2 -AddOn <b>boards</b> where the data is packed in a special HADES data format {{and sent to the}} Event Builders (EB) over Gigabit Ethernet (GbE). Event Builders merge subevents from the different detector subsystems to a complete event and write the event to a mass storage system. Detailed description of the HADES DAQ is given in [2...|$|R
40|$|The HADES {{experiment}} {{relies on}} an efficient {{data acquisition system}} to reach trigger rates from 20 kHz for heavy ion reactions up to 100 kHz for light collision systems. The main components of the HADES data acquisition system [1, 2] {{are designed to be}} capable of a total sustained throughput of 250 MB/s and a peak throughput of 400 MB/s. The HADES DAQ is illustrated in Fig. 1 with the emphasis on the data flow. TRB-Net [3] combines via optical 2 Gb/s links the Front-End Electronics (FEE) with <b>HUB</b> 2 -AddOn <b>boards</b> where the data is packed in a special HADES data format and sent to the Event Builders (EB) over Gigabit Ethernet (GbE).

40|$|ELIXIR is a {{distributed}} infrastructure, {{built around}} existing centres of excellence throughout the European member states represented through national Nodes, and incorporating the internationally supported European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI). There are currently over 160 institutes from 20 member states {{taking part in}} ELIXIR. Operating a large, distributed, ‘virtual’ organisation such as ELIXIR requires strong coordination capabilities with clear roles and effective and simple processes. Implementation of this organisation and integrating existing national networks and infrastructures is a significant management challenge and the core role of the secretariat at the ELIXIR Hub. Within the ELIXIR-EXCELERATE project, this development is supported through the establishment and annual updates of an ELIXIR-wide ELIXIR Handbook of Operations that captures the overall policies and processes in an easily accessible document (WP 12, D 12. 1). Here, {{the first version of}} the ELIXIR Handbook is presented. The structure is arranged according to the ELIXIR Hub operational modules, with separate sections for Governance, Nodes and the Service provision, the ELIXIR Programme, Project Management, Communications and External Relations, and Technical Operations. The handbook will be made available on the ELIXIR intranet, and is aimed for the whole ELIXIR community: staff in ELIXIR Nodes, ELIXIR <b>Hub</b> staff, ELIXIR <b>Board</b> members and national funders. While some sections in the handbook will necessarily remain internal to the ELIXIR community, the goal is to provide as much open access content as possible via the ELIXIR website. The handbook will have an annual release schedule as part of the EXCELERATE project and the final version will be released {{at the end of this}} project...|$|R
