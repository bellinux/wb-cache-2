Ryan White and his family {{strongly}} rejected the language of [...] "innocent victim" [...] because the phrase was often used to imply that gays with AIDS were [...] "guilty". Ryan's mother told The New York Times, Ryan always said, 'I'm {{just like everyone else}} with AIDS, no matter how I got it.' And he would never have lived as long as he did without the gay community. The people we knew in New York made sure we knew about the latest treatments way before we would have known in Indiana. I hear mothers today say they're not gonna work with no gay community on anything. Well, if <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> son's life, you better start changing your heart and your attitude around.|$|E

It was wrong, Amuba; and I have {{suffered}} horribly. Even though we are as brothers, why should you sacrifice yourself for me, especially when it is my life and not yours that is forfeited? I told myself a thousand times last night that I was base and cowardly in allowing you and Jethro to risk your lives for me, when by giving myself up the rage of the people will be satisfied, and you could make {{your way out of}} this land without great danger. It was bad enough that you should share my risk, but when <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> taking it all upon your shoulders that I should escape free, I can accept such sacrifice no longer; and to-morrow I will go down and surrender myself." ...|$|E
60|$|One {{generation}} after another fall like honey-bees upon this memorable forest, rifle its sweets, pack themselves with vital memories, {{and when the}} theft is consummated depart again into life richer, but poorer also. The forest, indeed, they have possessed, from that day forward it is theirs indissolubly, and they will return to walk in it {{at night in the}} fondest of their dreams, and use it for ever in their books and pictures. Yet when they made their packets, and put up their notes and sketches, something, it should seem, had been forgotten. A projection of themselves shall appear to haunt unfriended these scenes of happiness, a natural child of fancy, begotten and forgotten unawares. Over the whole field of our wanderings such fetches are still travelling like indefatigable bagmen; but the imps of Fontainebleau, as of all beloved spots, are very long of life, and memory is piously unwilling to forget their orphanage. If anywhere about that wood you meet my airy bantling, greet him with tenderness. He was a pleasant lad, though now abandoned. And when <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> own turn to quit the forest, may you leave behind you such another; no Antony or Werther, let us hope, no tearful whipster, but, as becomes this not uncheerful and most active age in which we figure, the child of happy hours.|$|E

I can't play this thing on you!--I can't let you play {{it on me}} any longer! You weren't in any danger,--you NEVER were! That bear was only a half-wild thing I helped to ra'r myself! It's taken sugar from my hand night after night {{at the door of}} this cabin as it might have taken it from yours here if it was alive now. It slept night after night in the brush, not fifty yards away. The morning's never come yet--till now," [...] he said hastily, to cover an odd break in his voice, [...] "when it didn't brush along the whole side of this cabin to kinder wake me up and say 'So long,' afore it browsed away into the canyon. Thar ain't a man along the whole Divide who didn't know it; thar ain't a man along the whole Divide that would have drawn a bead or pulled a trigger on it till now. It never had an enemy but the bees; it never even knew why horses and cattle were frightened of it. It wasn't much of a pet, you'd say, Miss Forester; it wasn't much to meet a lady's eye; but we of the woods must take our friends where we find 'em and of our own kind. It ain't no fault of yours, Miss, that you didn't know it; it ain't no fault of yours what happened; but when <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> THANKING me for it, why--it's--it's rather rough, you see--and gets me."

[...] I was content to be master, but she said there was better behind; [...] She took the chances I wouldn't, and I followed your mother blind. [...] She egged me to borrow the money, an' she helped me clear the loan, [...] When we bought half shares in a cheap 'un and hoisted a flag of our [...] own. [...] Patching and coaling on credit, and living the Lord knew how, [...] We started the Red Ox freighters--we've eight-and-thirty now.

[...] I went through his private papers; the notes was plainer than print; [...] And I'm no fool to finish if a man'll give me a hint. [...] (I remember his widow was angry.) So I saw what the drawings meant, [...] And I started the six-inch rollers, and it paid me sixty per cent. [...] Sixty per cent with failures, and more than twice we could do, [...] And a quarter-million to credit, and I saved it all for you.

[...] The things I knew was proper you wouldn't thank me to give, [...] And the things I knew was rotten you said was the way to live; [...] For you muddled with books and pictures, an' china an' etchin's an' [...] fans, [...] And your rooms at college was beastly--more like a whore's than a [...] man's-- [...] Till you married that thin-flanked woman, as white and as stale as a [...] bone, [...] And she gave you your social nonsense; but where's that kid o' your [...] own? [...] I've seen your carriages blocking the half of the Cromwell Road, [...] But never the doctor's brougham to help the missus unload.

[...] You're saved from soiling your fingers, and if you have no child, [...] It all comes back to the business. Gad, won't your wife be wild! [...] Calls and calls in her carriage, her 'andkerchief up to 'er eye: [...] "Daddy! dear daddy's dyin'!" [...] and doing her best to cry. [...] Grateful? Oh, yes, I'm grateful, but keep 'er away from here. [...] Your mother 'ud never ha' stood 'er, and, anyhow, women are queer.... There's women will say I've married a second time. Not quite! [...] But give pore Aggie a hundred, and tell her your lawyers'll fight. [...] She was the best o' the boiling--you'll meet her before it ends; [...] I'm in for a row with the mother--I'll leave you settle my friends: [...] For a man he must go with a woman, which women don't understand-- [...] Or the sort that say they can see it they aren't the marrying brand. [...] But I wanted to speak o' your mother that's Lady Gloster still. [...] I'm going to up and see her, without it's hurting the will. [...] Here! Take your hand off the bell-pull. Five thousand's waiting for [...] you, [...] If you'll only listen a minute, and do as I bid you do. [...] They'll try to prove me a loony, and, if you bungle, they can; [...] And I've only you to trust to! (O God, why ain't he a man?) [...] There's some waste money on marbles, the same as McCullough tried-- [...] Marbles and mausoleums--but I call that sinful pride. [...] There's some ship bodies for burial--we've carried 'em, soldered and [...] packed; [...] Down in their wills they wrote it, and nobody called them cracked. [...] But me--I've too much money, and people might.... All my fault: [...] It come o' hoping for grandsons and buying that Wokin' vault. [...] I'm sick o' the 'ole dam' business; I'm going back where I came. [...] Dick, you're the son o' my body, and you'll take charge o' the same! [...] I'm going to lie by your mother, ten thousand mile away, [...] And they'll want to send me to Woking; and that's where you'll earn [...] your pay. [...] I've thought it out on the quiet, the same as it ought to be done-- [...] Quiet, and decent, and proper--an' here's your orders, my son. [...] You know the Line? You don't, though. You write to the Board, and tell [...] Your father's death has upset you an' you're goin' to cruise for a [...] spell, [...] An' you'd like the Mary Gloster--I've held her ready for this-- [...] They'll put her in working order an' you'll take her out as she is. [...] Yes, it was money idle when I patched her and put her aside [...] (Thank God, I can pay for my fancies!)--the boat where your mother [...] died, [...] By the Little Paternosters, as you come to the Union Bank, [...] We dropped her--I think I told you--and I pricked it off where she [...] sank. [...] [Tiny she looked on the grating--that oily, treacly sea--] [...] Hundred and eighteen East, remember, and South just three. [...] Easy bearings to carry--three South--three to the dot; [...] But I gave McAndrews a copy in case of dying--or not. [...] And so you'll write to McAndrews, he's Chief of the Maori Line; [...] They'll give him leave, if you ask 'em and say it's business o' mine. [...] I built three boats for the Maoris, an' very well pleased they were, [...] An' I've known Mac since the Fifties, and Mac knew me--and her. [...] After the first stroke warned me I sent him the money to keep [...] Against the time you'd claim it, committin' your dad to the deep; [...] For you are the son o' my body, and Mac was my oldest friend, [...] I've never asked 'im to dinner, but he'll see it out to the end. [...] Stiff-necked Glasgow beggar, I've heard he's prayed for my soul, [...] But he couldn't lie if you paid him, and he'd starve before he stole. [...] He'll take the Mary in ballast--you'll find her a lively ship; [...] And you'll take Sir Anthony Gloster, that goes on his wedding-trip, [...] Lashed in our old deck-cabin with all three port-holes wide, [...] The kick o' the screw beneath him and the round blue seas outside! [...] Sir Anthony Gloster's carriage--our 'ouse-flag flyin' free-- [...] Ten thousand men on the pay-roll and forty freighters at sea! [...] He made himself and a million, but this world is a fleetin' show, [...] And he'll go to the wife of 'is bosom the same as he ought to go. [...] By the heel of the Paternosters--there isn't a chance to mistake-- [...] And Mac'll pay you the money as soon as the bubbles break! [...] Five thousand for six weeks' cruising, the stanchest freighter afloat, [...] And Mac he'll give you your bonus the minute I'm out o' the boat! [...] He'll take you round to Macassar, and you'll come back alone; [...] He knows what I want o' the Mary.... I'll do what I please with my own. [...] Your mother 'ud call it wasteful, but I've seven-and-thirty more; [...] I'll come in my private carriage and bid it wait at the door.... For my son 'e was never a credit: 'e muddled with books and art, [...] And 'e lived on Sir Anthony's money and 'e broke Sir Anthony's heart. [...] There isn't even a grandchild, and the Gloster family's done-- [...] The only one you left me, O mother, the only one! [...] Harrer an' Trinity College! Me slavin' early an' late, [...] An' he thinks I'm dyin' crazy, and you're in Macassar Strait! [...] Flesh o' my flesh, my dearie, for ever an' ever amen, [...] That first stroke come for a warning; I ought to ha' gone to you then, [...] But--cheap repairs for a cheap 'un--the doctors said I'd do: [...] Mary, why didn't you warn me? I've allus heeded to you, [...] Excep'--I know--about women; but you are a spirit now; [...] An', wife, they was only women, and I was a man. That's how. [...] An' a man 'e must go with a woman, as you could not understand; [...] But I never talked 'em secrets. I paid 'em out o' hand. [...] Thank Gawd, I can pay for my fancies! Now what's five thousand to me, [...] For a berth off the Paternosters in the haven where I would be? [...] I believe in the Resurrection, if I read my Bible plain, [...] But I wouldn't trust 'em at Wokin'; we're safer at sea again. [...] For the heart it shall go with the treasure--go down to the sea in [...] ships. [...] I'm sick of the hired women--I'll kiss my girl on her lips! [...] I'll be content with my fountain, I'll drink from my own well, [...] And the wife of my youth shall charm me--an' the rest can go to Hell! [...] (Dickie, he will, that's certain.) I'll lie in our standin'-bed, [...] An' Mac'll take her in ballast--and she trims best by the head.... Down by the head an' sinkin'. Her fires are drawn and cold, [...] And the water's splashin' hollow on the skin of the empty hold-- [...] Churning an' choking and chuckling, quiet and scummy and dark-- [...] Full to her lower hatches and risin' steady. Hark! [...] That was the after-bulkhead ... she's flooded from stem to stern.... Never seen death yet, Dickie?... Well, now is your time to learn! ...|$|E

5000|$|... • Ijara {{financing}} is a redeemable {{lease contract}} {{based on the}} Islamic principle of Ijara wa Iqtina, (lease to own). The process is simple: You identify a property and an independent Trust acquires it on your behalf and leases it back to you. You make monthly payments to the Trust that comprise of a Rent portion and an Acquisition payment. At {{the end of the}} contract term, the Trust transfers the house ownership to your name. You now own the property free and clear. The minimum down payment for Ijara contracts is typically 30%. Your payment on-account represents your beneficial rights in the property. Your monthly payments include rent and further payments on-account, thereby increasing your beneficial rights. You can acquire full title to the property when the sum of your payments on-account equals the original purchase price. The original purchase price is the goal toward which you are always working; we do not adjust it {{over the life of the}} lease. This eliminates gharar (doubtful practices), or any uncertainty when <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> financial arrangement.|$|E
