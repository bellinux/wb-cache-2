500|$|Arnold Wayne Jones {{from the}} Dallas Voice gave the album {{four out of}} five stars, writing that the show [...] "has all of the Material Girl's majesty and fetishistic eroticism, merged with lots of disturbing, violent imagery and a huge catalog of songs". Jones {{concluded}} that Madonna was more provocative than before with the release. Chuck Campbell from The Republic gave the album three and a half stars out of five, writing that [...] "an ambitious woman like Madonna will not let herself become a nostalgia act". He added that Madonna makes that clear every time she goes on tour: [...] "she's living in the moment, and she's all about her newest material." [...] The Advocates review for the release was positive, saying that the DVD affirms the fact that Madonna's [...] "musical reign continues". Entertainment Focus Pip Ellwood felt that the highlights of the record were the live performances of [...] "Human Nature" [...] and [...] "Like a Prayer". He concluded the review by saying that [...] " [...] Making perfect use of her dancers, the video screens and the sets, the MDNA World Tour is one of [...] most spectacular to date and she still performs with the passion and the energy she always has done. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> the show then get your copy of this and treat it like a souvenir. If you didn't you need to check it out as it's one of the best shows she's ever done." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic awarded the release three out of five stars, saying that [...] "there are unexpected musical moments that do make MDNA World Tour worth hearing", including the performance of [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] and [...] "Like a Prayer". However, he felt that the CD release was unnecessary since the album would be a better experience with its video.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his review}} for Time, Richard Corliss wrote, [...] "Wonder Boys {{reminds us of}} a distant age (the '70s) when bad movies were better: not stupid teen romps but sad, off-kilter studies of adults adrift. It is a rare current example of that {{endangered}} species, the honorable failure". Entertainment Weekly gave the film a [...] "C+" [...] rating and Owen Gleiberman wrote, [...] "Curtis Hanson may have {{wanted to make a}} movie that gleamed with humanity as much as L.A. Confidential burned with malevolence, but he's so intent on getting us to like his characters that he didn't give them enough juice." [...] Looking back in his Salon.com review, critic Andrew O'Hehir felt that Hanson, [...] "and cinematographer Dante Spinotti capture both Pittsburgh (one of the most serendipitously beautiful American cities) and the netherworld of boho academia with brilliant precision. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> a liberal-arts college anywhere in the United States, then the way Grady's ramshackle house looks in the wake of Crabs' enormous all-night party should conjure up vivid sense-memories".|$|E
2500|$|Wallace {{was raised}} as a Presbyterian. In college, however, he became {{increasingly}} dissatisfied with organized religion after reading William James' The Varieties of Religious Experience (1902). Around 1919 he stopped attending the Presbyterian church {{and spent the}} next ten years exploring other religious faiths and traditions, including spiritualism and esoteric religion. He later said, [...] "I know I am often called a mystic, and in the years following my leaving the United Presbyterian Church I was probably a practical mystic ... I'd say I was a mystic in the sense that George Washington Carver was – who believed God was in everything and therefore, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> God, you could find the answers." [...] Wallace joined the Theosophical Society on June 6, 1925, and that same year helped organize a Des Moines parish of the Liberal Catholic Church, a denomination with ties to theosophy, but which had no ties to the Roman Catholic Church. He resigned from the Theosophical Society on or before November 23, 1935, and in 1939 formally joined the Episcopal Church.|$|E

2500|$|Although Beckett {{refused to}} be drawn on the {{backgrounds}} of the characters, this has not stopped actors looking for their own motivation. Jean Martin had a doctor friend called Marthe Gautier, who {{was working at the}} Salpêtrière Hospital, and he said to her: [...] "'Listen, Marthe, what could I find that would provide some kind of physiological explanation for a voice like the one written in the text?' [...] said: 'Well, {{it might be a good}} idea <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> see the people who have Parkinson's disease.' So I asked her about the disease ... She explained how it begins with a trembling, which gets more and more noticeable, until later the patient can no longer speak without the voice shaking. So I said, 'That sounds exactly what I need.'" [...] "Sam and Roger were not entirely convinced by my interpretation but had no objections." [...] When he explained to Beckett that he was playing Lucky as if he were suffering from Parkinson's, Beckett said, [...] "'Yes, of course.' He mentioned briefly that his mother had had Parkinson's, but quickly moved on to another subject." ...|$|E
