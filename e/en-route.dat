5|$|As well as {{providing}} {{a home for}} some species of birds, Surtsey has also {{been used as a}} stopping-off point for migrating birds, particularly those <b>en-route</b> between Europe and Iceland. Species that have been seen briefly on the island include whooper swans, various species of geese, and common ravens. Although Surtsey lies {{to the west of the}} main migration routes to Iceland, it has become a more common stopping point as its vegetation has improved. In 2008, the 14th bird species was detected with the discovery of a common raven's nest.|$|E
5|$|After regrouping, Carter, Susan and Preacher go to a {{decompression}} {{chamber and}} swim to the surface. Carter {{realizes that the}} sharks made them flood the facility so they could escape through the weaker mesh fences at the surface. In an effort to distract the last shark from escaping to the open sea, Susan cuts herself and dives into the water. Although she manages to distract the shark, she is unable {{to get out of}} the water. Carter dives in, but is too late to save her from being devoured. While Carter is grabbing hold of the shark's dorsal fin, Preacher shoots the shark with a harpoon, but the spear also goes through Carter's thigh. As the shark breaks through the fence, Carter orders Preacher to connect the trailing wire to a battery, sending an electric current through the wire and to an explosive charge in the harpoon, killing the shark. In the end, Carter managed to free himself in time, and joins Preacher to see a workers' boat <b>en-route</b> on the horizon.|$|E
5|$|At 10:20, Wickson, the F-15C flight lead, {{reported}} entering northern Iraq to the AWACS controller {{responsible for}} air traffic inside the TAOR, USAF Lieutenant Ricky Wilson. The TAOR frequency that the F-15s were using {{was different from}} the <b>en-route</b> frequency being used by the two Black Hawks. Wilson, however, was monitoring both frequencies and being able to see both Black Hawks on his radar scope before they disappeared at 10:12. Wilson and the other AWACS crew members, many of whom were monitoring the F-15s' radio frequency, did not inform the F-15s that Black Hawks were currently operating in the TAOR. At 10:21, Wilson, believing that the Black Hawks had landed again, asked Wang if he could drop the friendly helicopter symbols from the AWACS's scopes and Wang approved the request. An AWACS crew instructor, Captain Mark Cathy, who was on the mission to assist the AWACS crew and supervise Wilson on this, his first mission into the TAOR, had retired {{to the back of the}} airplane at 10:00 to take a nap.|$|E
5|$|In 1882 Great Britain was {{converted}} into a sailing ship to transport bulk coal. She made her final voyage in 1886, after loading up with coal and leaving Penarth Dock for Panama on 8 February. After a fire on board <b>en-route</b> she was found on arrival at Port Stanley in the Falkland Islands to be damaged beyond economic repair. She was sold to the Falkland Islands Company and used, afloat, as a storage hulk (coal bunker) until 1937, when she was towed to Sparrow Cove, 3.5miles from Port Stanley, scuttled and abandoned. As a bunker, she coaled the South Atlantic fleet that defeated Admiral Graf Maximilian von Spee's fleet in the First World War Battle of the Falkland Islands. In the Second World War, some of her iron was scavenged to repair , one of the Royal Navy ships that fought the Graf Spee and was badly damaged during the Battle of the River Plate.|$|E
5|$|Macrinus' {{predecessor}} Caracalla {{was murdered}} on April 8, 217, {{during a period}} of war with the Parthians, near Carrhae while traveling <b>en-route</b> to visit a temple. His murderer was Justin Martialus, a soldier who was incensed after being declined the rank of centurion. Martialus was himself cut down by Caracalla's German Guards immediately afterwards, a convenient fact for Macrinus, at the time a Praetorian prefect, who was involved in the assassination. One reason for Macrinus to have intrigued against Caracalla was out of fear for the security of his own life. A story documented by Roman writer Herodian and supported by some later historians details the events leading to Caracalla's death. The story goes that Macrinus, {{in the course of his}} employment, was often tasked with reading dispatches sent to Caracalla for him. One such dispatch detailed a prophecy, perhaps fabricated, from the oracle at Delphi suggesting that Macrinus was destined to kill Caracalla and succeed him as the next emperor.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{has three}} autopilot modes. The standard mode for <b>en-route</b> navigation is LNAV, which navigates along a {{great circle route}} between waypoints, adjusting the aircraft's heading to compensate for wind. Other modes will maintain the aircraft's heading—direction the nose is pointed (flight path {{will be affected by}} winds)—or the aircraft's track—direction the aircraft travels (flight path in a straight direction). The latter two modes are further affected by whether the aircraft used magnetic (normal reference) or true north (typically only used at high latitudes) as the reference for the autopilot. Since Flight 370 flew near waypoints VAMPI, MEKAR, NILAM, and possibly IGOGU—all along air route N571—while traversing the Malacca Strait, investigators considered whether Flight 370 followed any air routes or intersected any waypoints in the Southern Indian Ocean. Waypoints MUTMI and RUNUT were considered possible points that Flight 370 may have traversed, but tracks through these waypoints did not correlate well with paths generated from the BTO and BFO analysis.|$|E

25|$|On 8 October 1947, the CAB {{established}} minimum <b>en-route</b> {{and approach}} altitudes which were uniform for all US air carriers. On 10 October 1947 the CAB required {{the installation of}} “absolute terrain warning indicators” in all air carrier scheduled aircraft.|$|E
25|$|She was {{returned}} to the United States in early 1946, by a Royal Navy crew. <b>En-route</b> she lost her port side screw {{and had to be}} towed by another LST to Norfolk, Virginia. She was turned back over to USN custody.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} daily (or multiple-daily) trains to Jaipur, Bikaner, Jodhpur, Kota, Ajmer, Indore, Kolkata, Nagpur, Solapur, Raipur, Bilaspur, Rourkela, Amritsar, Jalandhar, Ludhiana, Firozepur, Bhatinda, Ambala, Rohtak, Faridabad, Mathura, Dehradun, Pune, Goa, Mangalore, Kozhikode and Kochi (Ernakulam)- (and to several other {{stations}} <b>en-route).</b>|$|E

25|$|The Australian Forestry Group {{moved to}} Sussex in mid-1943. Shortly {{afterwards}} the Group departed the UK for Australia. By {{the time it}} left the UK the Australians had produced 30 million super feet of sawn timber. The foresters paraded through New York City in September 1943 while <b>en-route</b> to Australia. Following their return to Australia in November, the forest companies were deployed to the Northern Territory and New Guinea where they operated sawmills.|$|E
25|$|The {{investigation}} {{identified a}} combination of erroneous information, in relation to <b>en-route</b> reporting points {{and the existence of}} a radar echo from another aircraft that overflew the Sabadell NDB {{at the same time as}} the Dan-Air crew mistakenly reported passing it, as the accident's probable cause. This combination resulted in an involuntary error on the part of both ATC and aircraft that could not be corrected by the time the air traffic controller realised that his instructions to the aircraft's crew were given in response to a mutual misunderstanding, which resulted from a navigational error on the crew's part that had gone unnoticed.|$|E
25|$|Services to London {{are on the}} Stansted Express {{train to}} and from London Liverpool Street in Central London. This service {{operates}} every 15 minutes and the usual journey time is roughly 45 to 53 minutes. Liverpool Street is served by the Central, Circle, Hammersmith & City and the Metropolitan lines of the London Underground network, offering access throughout London. The Stansted Express also calls at Tottenham Hale, for the Underground's Victoria line and connections to various destinations in North London and the West End. Some Stansted Express services also call at Stansted Mountfitchet, Bishop's Stortford and/or Harlow Town <b>en-route</b> to London Liverpool Street.|$|E
25|$|Additionally WAAS {{works just}} as well between airports. This allows the {{aircraft}} to fly directly from one airport to another, as opposed to following routes based on ground-based signals. This can cut route distances considerably in some cases, saving both time and fuel. In addition, because {{of its ability to}} provide information on the accuracy of each GPS satellite's information, aircraft equipped with WAAS are permitted to fly at lower <b>en-route</b> altitudes than was possible with ground-based systems, which were often blocked by terrain of varying elevation. This enables pilots to safely fly at lower altitudes, not having to rely on ground-based systems. For unpressurized aircraft, this conserves oxygen and enhances safety.|$|E
25|$|Flight 267 was a scheduled, {{domestic}} service which {{was scheduled to}} fly from Stockholm Bromma Airport to Ängelholm–Helsingborg Airport, with intermediate stops at Hultsfred Airport and Halmstad Airport. Due to poor weather {{it was decided that}} the aircraft would not land at Hultsfred and the flight code was changed to FL267V to reflect this. The aircraft had a flight crew of four, of which one of the two flight attendants was under training. Thirty-nine passengers boarded the aircraft in Stockholm, including one child and three members of Parliament. It departed Bromma at 19:46. It cruised at an altitude of 3,600meters (12,000ft). While <b>en-route</b> increasing fog was observed at Halmstad and the meteorologist at Ängelholm recommended that the aircraft bypass Halmstad and fly directly to Ängelholm.|$|E
25|$|Along western Java, Banten and the Dutch {{settlement}} in Batavia remained outside of Agung's control. In {{his effort to}} unite Java, Agung claimed Mataram as the successor state of Demak, which historically held Banten as a vassal state. However, the Banten Sultanate opposed Agung's claim, preferring to remain as a sovereign state. Agung therefore considered military conquest {{as a means to}} coerce Banten into Mataram's hegemony. However if Agung were march his armies to Banten, the port city of Batavia would stand as a potential opponent too near to the proximity of the Banten region. This did not deter Agung from pursuing his claim as he already perceived Dutch rule of Batavia {{as a threat to the}} Mataram hegemony, thereby inciting further reason to march upon Batavia whilst <b>en-route</b> to Banten.|$|E
25|$|In February 1921, {{the same}} Lt Pearson and the 12th were again {{involved}} in a record-setting attempt, this time a planned transcontinental flight with only two stops {{to be completed in}} less than 24 hours. The flight was to be from Pablo Beach, Florida (near Jacksonville), to Rockwell Field, San Diego, with <b>en-route</b> servicing at Fort Worth and Biggs Field. Lt Pearson left Douglas for Florida on 7 February, but he was forced down in the desert with a broken crankshaft. Repairs were made the next day on the scene, and he flew on Biggs Field on the 9th, departing the next day for Kelly Field, San Antonio, but he didn’t make it. For the next six days, aircraft from five Texas bases searched for him in vain. Then, on the 16th, he arrived at Sanderson Border Patrol station on horseback, having made his way across country from his crash site in Mexico.|$|E
25|$|On 12 September 1947, the 9th {{along with}} the group {{deployed}} to Giebelstadt AB, Germany. This flight was the largest bomber formation flown from Fort Worth AAF overseas to date. <b>En-route</b> the aircraft flew to Maine over Greenland, Iceland, Great Britain and landing in Germany on 13 September. During the unit's ten-day deployment, they participated in training operations over Europe and redeployed to Fort Worth Army Air Field on 23 September 1947. On 2 November 1947, the 9th participated in a 30-day Far East Deployment and training exercise. However, the exercise was pushed back to 6 November and on that date the 9th deployed four B-29s to NAS Barbers Point, Hawaii, en route to Yokota AB, Japan. At Hawaii {{it was discovered that}} the fuel used in the Pacific was not compatible for the B-29s. Based on that, the aircraft returned to Fort Worth Army Airfield on 8 November 1947. In February 1948, the 9th deployed to Germany for temporary duty in three flights, flying three different routes to Europe. The first flight of three B-29s departed Carswell on 25 February by way of Westover AFB, Massachusetts; Keflavik AB, Iceland; and finally landing at Fürstenfeldbruck Air Base, Germany.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} was <b>en-route</b> to Campbeltown Airport in Argyll, Scotland, {{to pick up}} a ten year-old boy with acute abdominal pain, suspected to be appendicitis. After a flight that included many navigational irregularities, the pilot was flying the normal approach, which took the aircraft out to sea before turning back toward the airport. The pilot informed controllers that he had completed the turn, {{and that was the last}} transmission received from the aircraft. Investigators conclude the aircraft hit the water a few seconds after that transmission. Both occupants of the aircraft, the pilot and a paramedic seated at his station behind the pilot, were killed. The ensuing investigation concluded that the pilot allowed the aircraft to fly too low, and it descended unchecked into the sea. The pilot was also fatigued, overworked, lacked recent flying practise, and he might have suffered from an undetermined influence, such as disorientation, distraction, or subtle incapacitation, as evidenced by several navigational errors, miscommunications, and mismanagement of his instruments. Although the weather might have precluded a safe landing in Campbeltown, the weather was not a cause of the accident. The patient was eventually driven overland to a Glasgow hospital, where he was treated for a ruptured appendix.|$|E
500|$|The make-up for Kamal's scars was {{designed}} by Michael Westmore and Anil Premkarikar. The make-up process was completed in Los Angeles in April 2002 after Kamal filmed the song sequences for Panchathantiram (2002). When Kamal was <b>en-route</b> to Los Angeles from Toronto, he was detained by the authorities at the Toronto Pearson International Airport, who suspected him of being a terrorist because of his surname, which he described as sounding [...] "very Islamic". Kamal was left stranded at the airport until the authorities from the American Embassy at Toronto intervened and resolved the issue.|$|E
500|$|While Gannys had the {{numerical}} advantage, {{in the opening}} stages of the battle Macrinus' Praetorian Guards broke through Gannys' lines, and the latter's troops began to flee. In response, Elagabalus' mother and grandmother joined the battle and rallied the troops while Gannys led his own charge. [...] Gannys' troops turned and renewed the assault, causing Macrinus to flee the battle in fear and return to Antioch. He sent his son and co-emperor, Diadumenian, to Parthia and tried to return to Rome. Both he and his son were caught <b>en-route</b> and executed. Elagabalus entered Antioch as the new emperor of Rome, and with Macrinus dead, the Senate {{had no choice but}} to acknowledge the ascension of Elagabalus. By March 222 A.D., Elagabalus was himself killed by the disgruntled Praetorian Guard, declared an enemy of Rome and subjected to a damnatio memoriae.|$|E
500|$|By 01:20, the {{seriousness}} of the situation was now apparent to the passengers above decks, who began saying their goodbyes, with husbands escorting their wives and children to the lifeboats. Distress flares were fired every few minutes {{to attract the attention of}} any ships nearby and the radio operators repeatedly sent the distress signal CQD. Radio operator Harold Bride suggested to his colleague Jack Phillips that he should use the new SOS signal, as it [...] "may be your last chance to send it". The two radio operators contacted other ships to ask for assistance. Several responded, of which RMS Carpathia was the closest, at [...] away. She was a much slower vessel than Titanic and, even driven at her maximum speed of , would have taken four hours to reach the sinking ship. Another to respond was SS Mount Temple, which set a course and headed for Titanics position but was stopped <b>en-route</b> by pack ice.|$|E
500|$|The {{expedition}} regathered, {{and after}} obtaining a concession from the Costa Rican government, {{returned to the}} island the following year. He sailed the expedition's new yacht, Veracity, from England to Cocos Island in a troubled voyage, again accompanied by Jean. The expedition was underfunded and supplies were lacking. Mechanical failure while <b>en-route</b> also hampered the voyage. By {{the time of his}} arrival on Cocos, he had been appointed the controller of the expedition. [...] Despite extensive searching with a crude metal detector, no trace of the treasure had been found by September. Worsley, with a lecture season beginning in London in October, left the island in early September. This was his last involvement with the expedition which, after nine more months, failed to locate the treasure hunt. The expedition ended when funding ran out. Despite the lack of success, Worsley still believed treasure was to be found on the island and hoped to return. He never did, although his treasure hunting exploits provided plenty of material for his lecture tours.|$|E
500|$|The third storyline is {{concerned}} with the thoughts and motives of Rafael Leónidas Trujillo Molina himself. The chapters concerning The Goat recall the major events of his time, including the slaughter of thousands of Dominican Haitians in 1937. They also deal with the Dominican Republic's tense international relationships during the Cold War, especially with the United States under the presidency of John F. Kennedy, and Cuba under Castro. Vargas Llosa also speculates upon Trujillo's innermost thoughts and paints a picture of a man whose physical body is failing him. [...] Trujillo is tormented by both incontinence and impotence. Eventually, his storyline intersects with Urania's narrative when it's revealed that Urania was sexually assaulted by Trujillo. He is unable to achieve an erection with Urania, and, in frustration, he rapes her with his hands. This event is the core of Urania's shame, and hatred towards her own father. In addition, it's the cause of Trujillo's repeated anger over the [...] "anemic little bitch" [...] that witnessed his impotence and emotion, and the reason he is <b>en-route</b> to sleep with another girl on the night of his assassination.|$|E
