5|$|Melting of {{floating}} <b>ice</b> <b>shelves</b> (ice that originated on the land) {{does not in}} itself contribute much to sea-level rise (since the ice displaces only its own mass of water). However it is the outflow of the ice from the land to form the ice shelf which causes a rise in global sea level. This effect is offset by snow falling back onto the continent. Recent decades have witnessed several dramatic collapses of large <b>ice</b> <b>shelves</b> around the coast of Antarctica, especially along the Antarctic Peninsula. Concerns have been raised that disruption of <b>ice</b> <b>shelves</b> may result in increased glacial outflow from the continental ice mass.|$|E
5|$|Rohling's 2004 Bipolar model {{suggests}} that sea level rise lifted buoyant <b>ice</b> <b>shelves,</b> causing their destabilisation and destruction. Without a floating ice shelf to support them, continental ice sheets would flow out towards the oceans and disintegrate into icebergs and sea ice.|$|E
5|$|The Antarctic sheet {{is divided}} by the Transantarctic Mountains into two unequal {{sections}} known as the East Antarctic ice sheet (EAIS) and the smaller West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS). The EAIS rests on a major land mass but {{the bed of the}} WAIS is, in places, more than 2,500 metres below sea level. It would be seabed if the ice sheet were not there. The WAIS is classified as a marine-based ice sheet, meaning that its bed lies below sea level and its edges flow into floating <b>ice</b> <b>shelves.</b> The WAIS is bounded by the Ross Ice Shelf, the Ronne Ice Shelf, and outlet glaciers that drain into the Amundsen Sea.|$|E
5|$|Antarctica is {{intensely}} {{cold and}} arid. Most of the world's freshwater ice is contained within its sheets. Its most dramatic example of glacier retreat {{is the loss}} of large sections of the Larsen <b>Ice</b> <b>Shelf</b> on the Antarctic Peninsula.

5|$|Due to its {{location}} at the South Pole, Antarctica receives relatively little solar radiation. This {{means that it}} is a very cold continent where water is mostly in the form of ice. Precipitation is low (most of Antarctica is a desert) and almost always in the form of snow, which accumulates and forms a giant ice sheet which covers the land. Parts of this ice sheet form moving glaciers known as ice streams, which flow towards the edges of the continent. Next to the continental shore are many <b>ice</b> <b>shelves.</b> These are floating extensions of outflowing glaciers from the continental ice mass. Offshore, temperatures are also low enough that ice is formed from seawater through most of the year. It is important to understand the various types of Antarctic ice to understand possible effects on sea levels and the implications of global cooling.|$|E
5|$|New {{claims on}} Antarctica have been {{suspended}} since 1959, although in 2015 Norway formally defined Queen Maud Land as including the unclaimed area {{between it and the}} South Pole. Antarctica's status is regulated by the 1959 Antarctic Treaty and other related agreements, collectively called the Antarctic Treaty System. Antarctica is defined as all land and <b>ice</b> <b>shelves</b> south of 60° S {{for the purposes of the}} Treaty System. The treaty was signed by twelve countries including the Soviet Union (and later Russia), the United Kingdom, Argentina, Chile, Australia, and the United States. It set aside Antarctica as a scientific preserve, established freedom of scientific investigation and environmental protection, and banned military activity on Antarctica. This was the first arms control agreement established during the Cold War.|$|E
5|$|Gerard Bond {{suggests}} {{that changes in}} the flux of solar energy on a 1,500-year scale may be correlated to the Dansgaard-Oeschger cycles, and in turn the Heinrich events; however the small magnitude {{of the change in}} energy makes such an exo-terrestrial factor unlikely to have the required large effects, at least without huge positive feedback processes acting within the Earth system. However, rather than the warming itself melting the ice, it is possible that sea-level change associated with the warming destabilised <b>ice</b> <b>shelves.</b> A rise in sea level could begin to corrode the bottom of an ice sheet, undercutting it; when one ice sheet failed and surged, the ice released would further raise sea levels, and further destabilizing other ice sheets. In favour of this theory is the non-simultaneity of ice sheet break-up in H1, H2, H4, and H5, where European breakup preceded European melting by up to 1,500years (Maslin et al. 2001).|$|E

40|$|We {{assess how}} the {{propagation}} of high-frequency elastic-flexural waves through an <b>ice</b> <b>shelf</b> is modified {{by the presence of}} spatially periodic crevasses. Analysis of the normal modes supported by the <b>ice</b> <b>shelf</b> with and without crevasses reveals that a periodic crevasse distribution qualitatively changes the mechanical response. The normal modes of an <b>ice</b> <b>shelf</b> free of crevasses are evenly distributed as a function of frequency. In contrast, the normal modes of a crevasse-ridden <b>ice</b> <b>shelf</b> are distributed unevenly. There are "band gaps", frequency ranges over which no eigenmodes exist. A model <b>ice</b> <b>shelf</b> that is 50 km in lateral extent and 300 m thick with crevasses spaced 500 m apart has a band gap from 0. 2 to 0. 38 Hz. This is a frequency range relevant for ocean wave/ice-shelf interactions. When the outermost edge of the crevassed <b>ice</b> <b>shelf</b> is oscillated at a frequency within the band gap, the <b>ice</b> <b>shelf</b> responds very differently from a crevasse-free <b>ice</b> <b>shelf.</b> The flexural motion of the crevassed <b>ice</b> <b>shelf</b> is confined to a small region near the outermost edge of the <b>ice</b> <b>shelf</b> and effectively "blocked" from reaching the interior.

5|$|The strict {{definition}} of Heinrich events is the climatic event causing the IRD layer observed in marine sediment cores from the North Atlantic: a massive collapse of northern hemisphere <b>ice</b> <b>shelves</b> {{and the consequent}} release of a prodigious volume of icebergs. By extension, the name Heinrich events can also refer to the associated climatic anomalies registered at other places around the globe, at approximately the same time periods. The events are rapid: they last probably less than a millennium, a duration varying from one event to the next, and their abrupt onset may occur in mere years (Maslin et al. 2001). Heinrich events are clearly observed in many North Atlantic marine sediment cores covering the last glacial period; the lower resolution of the sedimentary record before this point {{makes it more difficult}} to deduce whether they occurred during other glacial periods in the Earth's history. Some (Broecker 1994, Bond & Lotti 1995) identify the Younger Dryas event as a Heinrich event, which would make it event H0 (table, right).|$|E
25|$|<b>Ice</b> <b>shelves</b> exert a {{dominant}} control in Antarctica, but are less important in Greenland, where the ice sheet meets {{the sea in}} fjords. Here, melting is the dominant ice removal process, resulting in predominant mass loss occurring towards {{the edges of the}} ice sheet, where icebergs are calved in the fjords and surface meltwater runs into the ocean.|$|E
25|$|A {{sea level}} rise is an {{increase}} in the volume of water in the world’s oceans, resulting in an increase in global mean sea level. Sea level rise is usually attributed to global climate change by thermal expansion of the water in the oceans and by melting of ice sheets and glaciers on land. Melting of floating <b>ice</b> <b>shelves</b> or icebergs at sea raises sea levels only slightly.|$|E

The crests of both domes are displaced {{east of the}} centre line of Greenland. The unconfined ice sheet does not reach the sea along a broad front anywhere in Greenland, so that no large <b>ice</b> <b>shelves</b> occur.|$|E
25|$|The Larsen D Ice Shelf {{is between}} Smith Peninsula {{in the south}} and Gipps Ice Rise. It is {{considered}} to be generally stable.

The most recent survey of Larsen D measured it at 22,600 km2. There is fast ice along the entire front. This makes it difficult to interpret the ice front because the semi-permanent sea ice varies in thickness and may be nearly indistinguishable from shelf ice.|$|E

500|$|In 1981 Terry Hughes {{proposed}} that the region around Pine Island Bay may be a [...] "weak underbelly" [...] of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.

500|$|Heinrich's {{original}} {{observations were}} of six layers in ocean sediment cores with extremely high proportions of rocks of continental origin, [...] "lithic fragments", in the 180μm to [...] size range (Heinrich 1988). The larger size fractions cannot be transported by ocean currents, {{and are thus}} interpreted as having been carried by icebergs or sea ice which broke off glaciers or <b>ice</b> <b>shelves,</b> and dumped debris onto the sea floor as the icebergs melted. Geochemical analyses of the IRD can provide information {{about the origin of}} these debris: mostly the large Laurentide ice sheet then covering North America for Heinrich events 1, 2, 4 and 5, and on the contrary, European ice sheets for the minor events 3 and 6. The signature of the events in sediment cores varies considerably with distance from the source region. For events of Laurentide origin, there is a belt of IRD at around 50° N, known as the Ruddiman belt, expanding some 3,000km (1,865mi) from its North American source towards Europe, and thinning by an order of magnitude from the Labrador Sea to the European end of the present iceberg route (Grousset et al., 1993). During Heinrich events, huge volumes of fresh water flow into the ocean. For Heinrich event 4, based on a model study reproducing the isotopic anomaly of oceanic oxygen 18, the fresh water flux has been estimated to 0.29±0.05Sverdrup with a duration of 250±150years (Roche et al., 2004), equivalent to a fresh water volume of about [...] or a [...] sea-level rise.|$|E

500|$|<b>Ice</b> <b>shelves</b> are not stable when {{surface melting}} occurs, and the {{collapse}} of Larsen Ice Shelf has been caused by warmer melt season temperatures that have led to surface melting and the formation of shallow ponds of water on the ice shelf. The Larsen Ice Shelf lost [...] of its area from 1995 to 2001. In a 35-day period beginning on January 31, 2002, about [...] of shelf area disintegrated. The ice shelf is now 40% the size of its previous minimum stable extent. In 2015 a study concluded that the remaining Larsen B ice-shelf will disintegrate {{by the end of the}} decade, based on observations of faster flow and rapid thinning of glaciers in the area. Jones Ice Shelf had an area of [...] in the 1970s but by 2008 it had disappeared. Wordie Ice Shelf has gone from an area of [...] in 1950 to [...] in 2000. Prince Gustav Ice Shelf has gone from an area of [...] to [...] in 2008. After their loss the reduced buttressing of feeder glaciers has allowed the expected speed-up of inland ice masses after shelf ice break-up. The Ross Ice Shelf is the largest ice shelf of Antarctica (an area of roughly [...] and about [...] across: about the size of France). Wilkins Ice Shelf is another ice shelf that has suffered substantial retreat. The ice shelf had an area of [...] in 1998 when [...] was lost that year. [...] In 2007 and 2008 significant rifting developed and led to the loss of another [...] of area and some of the calving occurred in the Austral winter. The calving seemed to have resulted from preconditioning such as thinning, possibly due to basal melt, as surface melt was not as evident, leading to a reduction in the strength of the pinning point connections.
