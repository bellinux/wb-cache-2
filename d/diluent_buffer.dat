40|$|When plasma {{proteins}} are diluted with buffer the {{ionic strength}} and ionic composition of that buffer affects {{the interactions between}} thyroxine (T 4) and its plasma protein-binding sites. Increases in phosphate, chloride or barbiturate ion concentration from 50 to 200 m-mol/l caused {{a significant decrease in}} the affinity of plasma proteins for T 4, and a con-current increase in the concentration of unbound T 4. These results cannot be completely accounted for by changes in ionic strength since at the same ionic strength different anions caused quantitatively different effects on unbound T concentration. The degree of de-pression of T 4 binding by the three anions studied was in the order barbiturate> chloride> phosphate. The results of a systematic study on the composition of <b>diluent</b> <b>buffer</b> systems indicated that when a 50 mM-sodium phosphate=n- 00 mM-NaCl buffer (pH 7 =.) was used as a plasma diluent, there were unlikely to be gross changes in the T 4 -binding properties of plasma proteins with dilution...|$|E
40|$|Summary. The {{motility}} of dog spermatozoa is depressed by high dilution. Dog spermatozoa survived {{best in a}} chloride <b>diluent,</b> <b>buffered</b> with phosphate. Citrate, tartrate and peptone diluents {{were less}} favour¬ able. Adding 2 to 25 % prostatic fluid to diluents partially prevented the effects of dilution on dog spermatozoa, but motility was depressed by neat prostatic fluid. There was little evidence for loss of protective substances from dog spermatozoa when left overnight, or after repeated freezing and thawing. Bovine globulin, casein, egg albumin and alanine were even more effective than prostatic fluid in preventing the dilution phenomenon, and motility in their presence {{was as good as}} in con¬ centrated suspensions.

Adding 1 mm-calcium or 5 to 51 mm-potassium to an isotonic dialysis fluid was beneficial and the effects on ICF were additive.

40|$|SUMMARY Indomethacin {{inhibits}} {{the synthesis}} of prosta-glandin {{and the release of}} renin. These effects were studied in normal rabbits and rabbits with two-kidney Goldblatt hyperten-sion (2 KGH) and one-kidney Goldblatt hypertension (1 KGH) by giving daily intravenous injections of indomethacin (3 mg/kg after two initial doses of 9 mg/kg), and in appropriate control rabbits given <b>diluent</b> phosphate <b>buffer</b> without indomethacin. In normal rabbits, indomethacin significantly decreased immunoreactive plasma prostaglandin E-like substance (IPGE) and plasma renin activity (PRA). Indomethacin did not change plasma creatinine (PCr) or mean blood pressure but it decreased renal blood flow (RBF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). In 2 KGH rabbits, responses depended on the level of renal function and, to a lesser extent, on the level of PRA.

Although many commercial arrays covering multitudes of biologically significant analytes are available, occasionally the development of custom arrays is necessary.

This array was required for the measurement of candidate biomarkers of vaccine safety in small volumes of mouse sera. Optimisation of this assay required a stepwise approach: testing cross-reactivity of the antibody pairs, the development of an in-house serum <b>diluent</b> <b>buffer</b> as well as heat-inactivation of serum samples to prevent interference from matrix effects. We then demonstrate the use of this array to analyse inflammatory mediators in mouse serum after immunisation.

40|$|AbstractPurpose: The {{mechanisms}} of venous thrombogenesis {{have been studied}} by using animal models and cells in culture. The results from these systems may not, however, be relevant to the human condition. The {{aim of this study}} was to develop a method by which thrombus could be safely produced in a human vein in vivo. The model that was developed was used as a means of studying the changes in soluble adhesion molecule expression in human venous thrombogenesis. Methods: An autologous thrombin extract was used to generate experimental thrombi in the disconnected portion of the long saphenous veins of 30 patients who were undergoing routine bilateral varicose vein surgery. The contralateral vein was perfused with thrombin extract <b>diluent</b> <b>buffer</b> to act as the control. The concentration of soluble P-, E- and L-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM- 1), and vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1 were measured by means of specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays in samples of blood taken from veins in which thrombus had formed and in contralateral control veins. Results: Thrombosis invariably formed when at least 100 IU of thrombin activity was administered. Thrombus formation was independent of the time that the thrombin extract was allowed to remain within the emptied vessel. Thrombosis never developed in control vessels that were similarly treated with the buffer used to dilute the thrombin extract. Experimental thrombi were composed mainly of red cells, with layers of fibrin next to platelet and leukocyte packages. These findings are similar to those observed in samples of established human venous thrombi. There were small but significantly higher levels of the adhesion molecules, soluble P-selectin, and vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1 in blood taken from veins in which experimental thrombi had formed, compared with controls (P =. 015 and. 007, respectively; Wilcoxon signed rank test). Serum levels of soluble L-selectin, E-selectin, and ICAM- 1 were not affected by thrombosis. Conclusion: This model is safe and reproducible. It produces thrombi with a morphology similar to that described for established human deep venous thrombi. The model may be appropriate for the study of the early changes that occur during human venous thrombogenesis and may also be of value in testing the efficacy of novel antithrombotic agents.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{concentration}} of hydrophilic (hydroxypropyl methylcellulose [HPMC]) and hydrophobic (hydrogenated castor oil [HCO]) products, fillers (lactose and dibasic calcium phosphate), and buffers (sodium bicarbonate, calcium carbonate, and sodium citrate) on naproxen release rate was studied. Matrix tablets were prepared by double compression, andIn vitro dissolution tests were performed. The dissolution results showed that an increased amount of HPMC or hydrogenated castor oil resulted in reduced drug release. The inclusion of buffers in the HPMC matrix tablets enhanced naproxen release. For HCO tablets, only sodium bicarbonate enhanced naproxen release. The presence of lactose on HPMC matrix tablets did not show a significantly different result from that obtained with the formulation containing dibasic calcium phosphate as a filler. However, for the tablets containing HCO, the presence of lactose significantly enhanced the naproxen release rate. The matrix-forming materials {{in this study were}} suitable for use in sustained-release tablets containing naproxen.

40|$|A computer-assisted, kinetics-based {{enzyme-linked}} immunosorbent assay {{was adapted}} {{for the detection of}} coronavirus antibodies in feline serum. An alkaline antigen <b>diluent</b> (carbonate-bicarbonate <b>buffer,</b> pH 9. 6) used in initial experiments produced diffuse, nonspecific color reactions in both viral and control antigen cuvettes which were correlated, paradoxically, with coronavirus antibody levels in test sera. These interfering reactions were minimized by use of lower-pH antigen diluents such as water and phosphate-buffered saline. Background kinetics-based {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} reactivity directed against a noncoronaviral component of antigen tissue culture fluids could then detected in numerous sera, particularly in samples with lower titers. Much of this reactivity was shown to be associated with bovine gamma globulins in cell culture fluid. It was not serum lot or species specific, since a variety of bovine serum lots as well as individual lots of serum from other mammalian and avian species reacted. Reactivity was markedly reduced when cells for antigen preparation were grown in gamma globulin-free bovine serum. Generation of corrected slope values from the kinetics-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay made it possible to correct for residual background reactivity in individual test sera and thus eliminate a potentially major source of false-positive reactions. Collectively, these studies indicated that the control of nonspecific reactivity in feline coronavirus serology is absolutely essential to obtain useful estimates of specific antibody responses...|$|R

40|$|It is {{well known}} that most viral agents lose some of their viability-often rapidly-if stored in {{ordinary}} <b>diluents</b> such as <b>buffered</b> saline or nutrient broth.

Control tests showed good survival of principal skin organisms with moderate or large initial populations and a disproportionately greater loss with an initial sparse population. Results of these studies are compared with earlier studies of the forehead flora of a Seattle urban population. On most Alaskan subjects Propionibacterium acnes was more abundant than staphylococci on both sites and both organisms had greater population densities on the forehead than on the back. Population densities for P. acnes varied from none detected to more than 106 per cm 2 on the forehead and 105 per cm 2 on the back. For coagulase-negative staphylococci the range was from none detected to more than 105 per cm 2 on the forehead and the back. The proportion of subjects with relatively abundant or relatively sparse populations of P. acnes and of staphylococci did not change seasonally. Of 51 staphylococcal isolates, 65 % were S. epidermidis, 22 % S. capitis, and 10 % S. hominis, P. saceharolyticus was found on a minority of subjects on both sites.

40|$|The {{extensive}} {{literature on}} the photosensitizing action of dyes on biological systems has been summarized by Blum (1941). Reference {{should be made to}} this book for the general principles of photodynamic action. Previous studies on photo-dynamic inactivation of phages have been made by Clifton (1931) and by Perdrau and Todd (1933). Burnet (1933) found that the relative sensitivity of phage strains to photodynamic inactivation was correlated with serological grouping and hence was of taxonomic signifi-cance. The present paper is a kinetic study of the variables affecting photodynamic ssitivity. MTEIALS AND METHODS The phage strains and bacterial hosts used are listed in table 1 with references to the ultimate source. Routine methods of phage technology have been described by Adams (1950). The saline <b>buffer</b> <b>diluent</b> contained 0. 85 per cent NaCl, 100 pg of gelatin per ml, 0. 001 M MgSO 4; and it was buffered at pH 7. 0 with the appropri-ate mixture of m/ 15 Na 2 HPO 04 and m/ 15 KH 2 PO 4.

We hypothesize that the molecular pathways regulating C. elegans dauer development also control L 3 i arrest and activation in S. stercoralis. This study aimed to determine the factors that regulate L 3 i activation, {{with a focus on}} G protein-coupled receptor-mediated regulation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) pathway signaling, including its modulation of the insulin/IGF- 1 -like signaling (IIS) pathway. We found that application of the membrane-permeable cGMP analog 8 -bromo-cGMP potently activated development of S. stercoralis L 3 i, as measured by resumption of feeding, with 85. 1 ± 2. 2 % of L 3 i feeding in 200 µM 8 -bromo-cGMP in comparison to 0. 6 ± 0. 3 % in the <b>buffer</b> <b>diluent.</b> Utilizing RNAseq, we examined L 3 i stimulated with DMEM, 8 -bromo-cGMP, or the DAF- 12 nuclear hormone receptor (NHR) ligand Δ 7 -dafachronic acid (DA) [...] a signaling pathway downstream of IIS in C. elegans. L 3 i stimulated with 8 -bromo-cGMP up-regulated transcripts of the putative agonistic insulin-like peptide (ILP) -encoding genes Ss-ilp- 1 (20 -fold) and Ss-ilp- 6 (11 -fold) in comparison to controls without stimulation. Surprisingly, we found that Δ 7 -DA similarly modulated transcript levels of ILP-encoding genes. Using the phosphatidylinositol- 4, 5 -bisphosphate 3 -kinase inhibitor LY 294002, we demonstrated that 400 nM Δ 7 -DA-mediated activation (93. 3 ± 1. 1 % L 3 i feeding) can be blocked using this IIS inhibitor at 100 µM (7. 6 ± 1. 6 % L 3 i feeding). To determine the tissues where promoters of ILP-encoding genes are active, we expressed promoter::egfp reporter constructs in transgenic S. stercoralis post-free-living larvae. Ss-ilp- 1 and Ss-ilp- 6 promoters are active in the hypodermis and neurons and the Ss-ilp- 7 promoter is active in the intestine and a pair of head neurons.
