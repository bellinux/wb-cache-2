Studies suggest that summarizing is intimately linked to reading comprehension {{in that the}} writer must, first of all, {{make sense of the}} target text (Kintsch & van Dijk 1978). Because of this, it has been frequently used as a measure of reading comprehension for both research and testing purpose (e.g., Cohen 1994; Yu 2008). However, Taylor (1986) has argued that summarizing “requires certain written language skills which are apart from and may be more complex than mere reading skills” (p. 206).
