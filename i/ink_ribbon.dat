25|$|The early Resident Evil {{video games}} used a {{typewriter}} as the save feature, and used one <b>ink</b> <b>ribbon</b> per save.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the [...] "typeball" [...] technology, Selectrics were associated with several innovations in <b>ink</b> <b>ribbon</b> design.|$|E
2500|$|The Centralograph {{was used}} for {{production}} monitoring and registration of {{the running of the}} spinning machines in workshop and offices. The Centralograph is a recording instrument equipped with a number of printing units which record data on a moving chart. The record appears in the form of dashes and numerical digits in a series of columns. The printing units have electromagnet coil which are actuated by external impulses. The chart and the <b>ink</b> <b>ribbon</b> are driven either by a synchronous motor or by an impulse motor. Synchronous motors are commonly used in analog electric clocks, timers and other devices where correct time is required.|$|E
50|$|In 1973, SCM {{introduced}} a cartridge ribbon which eliminated the long-standing problem of getting ink-stained fingers from hand-threading a replacement spool of <b>inked</b> <b>ribbon.</b>|$|R
50|$|A ‘card shield’ would {{grab the}} punched card {{to hold it}} in place and lower it a {{position}} almost touching the <b>inked</b> print <b>ribbon</b> and print wheel. At the correct time 60 ‘hammers’, under spring tension and controlled by a cam, would ‘fire’ pressing the card / <b>inked</b> <b>ribbon</b> onto the print wheel and leaving an inked impression of the character {{on the surface of the}} punched card. There is a blank space on the print wheel for non-printing columns.|$|R
5000|$|A {{letter-quality printer}} {{operates}} {{in much the}} same fashion as a typewriter. A metal or plastic printwheel embossed with letters, numbers, or symbols strikes an <b>inked</b> <b>ribbon,</b> depositing the <b>ink</b> (or carbon, if an expensive single-strike ribbon was installed) on the page and thus printing a character.|$|R

5000|$|The early Resident Evil {{video games}} used a {{typewriter}} as the save feature, and used one <b>ink</b> <b>ribbon</b> per save.|$|E
50|$|Programs {{and data}} could be stored on a {{cassette}} tape through an optional external tape interface unit. A printer/cassette interface was available, which used an <b>ink</b> <b>ribbon</b> on plain paper.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} an automap to help players navigate the {{different areas of}} the game. Additionally, the player can pick up maps of certain sections to reveal unexplored areas. To save their progress, players need to find <b>ink</b> <b>ribbons</b> and use them with a typewriter; the game features a limited supply of <b>ink</b> <b>ribbons,</b> so players cannot save their progress as many times as they want. The story of the game is slightly altered by the character the player chooses to play as, and certain choices the player makes in the game can impact the direction of the game and its ending. Upon completing the game under a certain difficulty setting and time limit, the player may unlock secret costumes for the main characters, bonus weapons, and special difficulty modes.|$|R
50|$|The Lettera 22 is {{an oblique}} frontstroke typebar typewriter. The typebars strike a red/black <b>inked</b> <b>ribbon,</b> which is {{positioned}} between the typebar {{and the paper}} by a lever whenever a key is pressed; a small switch located near the upper {{right side of the}} keyboard can be used to control the strike position of the ribbon, in order to print with black, red, or no ink (for mimeograph stencils).|$|R
50|$|The {{line printer}} could print 600 lines of 120 {{characters}} per minute. It used a print barrel {{made up of}} 120 print wheels each with 50 characters around its edge. Each of the 120 print positions had a print hammer which when fired squeezed the paper and an <b>inked</b> <b>ribbon</b> between itself and the rotating print barrel {{for a fraction of}} a second. It is reputed to be the first commercially produced barrel printer.|$|R

5000|$|Impact {{printers}} {{rely on a}} forcible {{impact to}} transfer ink to the media. The impact printer uses a print head that either hits {{the surface of the}} <b>ink</b> <b>ribbon,</b> pressing the <b>ink</b> <b>ribbon</b> against the paper (similar to the action of a typewriter), or, less commonly, hits the back of the paper, pressing the paper against the <b>ink</b> <b>ribbon</b> (the IBM 1403 for example). All but the dot matrix printer rely on the use of fully formed characters, letterforms that represent each of the characters that the printer was capable of printing. In addition, most of these printers were limited to monochrome, or sometimes two-color, printing in a single typeface at one time, although bolding and underlining of text could be done by [...] "overstriking", that is, printing two or more impressions either in the same character position or slightly offset. Impact printers varieties include typewriter-derived printers, teletypewriter-derived printers, daisywheel printers, dot matrix printers and line printers. Dot matrix printers remain in common use in businesses where multi-part forms are printed. An overview of impact printing contains a detailed description of many of the technologies used.|$|E
50|$|The <b>ink</b> <b>ribbon</b> {{was a long}} {{roll the}} width of the print area that was {{positioned}} between the print chain and the paper. The roll came in two parts, the feeder roll and take-up roll. The roll was constantly wound and rewound during printing.|$|E
50|$|This {{advancement}} {{was possible}} because many university computer terminals had switched by the mid-1970s to CRT screens, {{which could be}} refreshed with text {{in a few seconds}} instead of a minute or more. Earlier games printed game status for the player on Teletype machines or a line printer, at speeds ranging from 10 to 30 characters per second with a rat-a-tat-tat sound as a metal ball or belt with characters was pressed against paper through an <b>inked</b> <b>ribbon</b> by a hammer.|$|R
5000|$|An early {{drum printer}} was the [...] "Potter Flying Typewriter", in 1952. [...] "Instead of working laboriously, one {{character}} at a time, it prints whole lines at once, 300 lines per minute, {{on a paper}} band. ... Heart of the machine is a continuously spinning disk with the necessary letters and numbers on its rim. ... As the disk revolves, 80 electrically operated hammers tap {{the back of the}} paper against an <b>inked</b> <b>ribbon</b> in contact with the disk, thus printing the proper characters in the proper places on the line." ...|$|R
5000|$|Both line matrix and serial {{dot matrix}} printers, use pins to strike against the <b>inked</b> <b>ribbon,</b> making dots {{on the paper}} and forming the desired [...] characters. The {{differences}} are that line matrix printers use a hammer bank (or print-shuttle) instead of print head, this print-shuttle has hammers instead of print wires, and these hammers are arranged in a horizontal row instead in vertical column. The hammer bank uses the same technology as the permanent magnet print head with the small difference that instead of print wires the print-shuttle has hammers.|$|R
5000|$|The drum sat above an 18 in <b>ink</b> <b>ribbon.</b> Below {{the ribbon}} the [...] green-bar {{continuous}} form paper was moved {{into and out}} of the printer head on four tractor assemblies. Below the paper path were a set of 120 or 132 “hammers” that were triggered by electric solenoids.|$|E
50|$|A {{typewriter}} ribbon or <b>ink</b> <b>ribbon</b> is an expendable module {{serving the}} function of transferring pigment to paper in various devices for impact printing. Such ribbons were part of standard designs for hand- or motor-driven typewriters, teleprinters, stenotype machines, computer-driven printers and many mechanical calculators, before electronic alternatives replaced most of them.|$|E
50|$|It {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{low-cost}} color printers available to consumers and became a popular printer for printing computer art drawn with software packages such as KoalaPad, Deluxe Paint, Doodle! and NEOchrome but was criticized for its slowness and high cost of operation, as the wax-coated ribbon only lasted for one pass, unlike an <b>ink</b> <b>ribbon.</b> The Okimate 10 was succeeded by the Okimate 20.|$|E
50|$|Royal Talens is {{a company}} in Apeldoorn that specializes in artists {{accessories}} and hobby paint. In the past Talens has also produced fountain pen <b>ink,</b> typewriter <b>ribbon,</b> carbon paper and other office supplies.|$|R
50|$|PVB resins (provided by the {{manufacturer}} in powdered or granulated form) are also utilized {{in a range of}} applications including technical ceramic (temporary) binders, <b>inks,</b> dye transfer <b>ribbon</b> <b>inks,</b> paints & coatings (including wash primers), binders for reflective sheet and binders for magnetic media. PVB resin is particularly useful at bonding to metals, ceramics and other inorganics.|$|R
2500|$|Dry {{correction}} products (such as correction paper) under {{brand names}} such as [...] "Ko-Rec-Type" [...] were introduced in the 1970s and functioned like white carbon paper. A strip of the product was placed over the letters needing correction, and the incorrect letters were retyped, causing the black character to be overstruck with a white overcoat. Similar material was soon incorporated in carbon-film electric typewriter ribbons; like the traditional two-color black-and-red <b>inked</b> <b>ribbon</b> common on manual typewriters, {{a black and white}} correcting ribbon became commonplace on electric typewriters. But the black or white coating could be partly rubbed off with handling, so such corrections were generally not acceptable in legal documents.|$|R
50|$|Some games employ {{limits to}} saving {{in order to}} prevent players from using them as a primary means of {{succeeding}} in the game. In Tomb Raider save points are consumed upon use, Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest charges two banana coins to use a save point more than once, and in Resident Evil the player must find and expend an <b>ink</b> <b>ribbon</b> for each save.|$|E
50|$|The Caps Lock key {{originated}} as a Shift {{lock key}} on mechanical typewriters. An early innovation in typewriters was {{the introduction of}} a second character on each typebar, thereby doubling the number of characters that could be typed, using the same number of keys. The second character was positioned above the first on the face of each typebar, and the shift key caused the entire type apparatus to move, physically shifting the positioning of the typebars relative to the <b>ink</b> <b>ribbon.</b> Just as in modern computer keyboards, the shifted position was used to produce capitals and secondary characters.|$|E
50|$|MicroDry is a {{computer}} printing system developed by the ALPS corporation of Japan. It is a wax/resin-transfer system using individual colored thermal ribbon cartridges, and can print in process color using cyan, magenta, yellow, and black cartridges, as well as such spot-color cartridges as white, metallic silver, and metallic gold, {{on a wide variety}} of paper and transparency stock. Certain MicroDry printers can also operate in dye sublimation mode, using special cartridges and paper. ALPS licensed the technology to Citizen (Printiva series) and to Okidata (Oki DP series). Alps also produced the actual printer hardware and <b>ink</b> <b>ribbon</b> cartridges for those companies.|$|E
2500|$|The {{pinnacle}} {{of this kind}} of technology was the IBM Electronic Typewriter series. These machines, and similar products from other manufacturers, used a separate correction ribbon and a character memory. With a single keystroke, the typewriter was capable of automatically backspacing and then overstriking the previous characters with minimal marring of the paper. White cover-up ribbons were used with fabric <b>ink</b> <b>ribbons,</b> [...] or an alternate premium design featured plastic lift-off correction ribbons which were used with carbon film typing ribbons. [...] This latter technology actually lifted the carbon film forming a typed letter, leaving nothing more than a flattened depression in the surface of the paper, with the advantage that no color matching of the paper was needed.|$|R
5000|$|The console {{typewriter}} is {{the product}} of a company named Soroban Engineering. It uses an IBM Model B Electric typewriter mechanism, modified by the addition of switches to detect keypresses, and solenoids to activate the typebars. It uses a traditional typebar mechanism, not the [...] "golfball" [...] IBM Selectric typewriter mechanism, which was not introduced until the next year. Lettercase is selected by raising and lowering the massive type basket. The Soroban is equipped with a two-color <b>inked</b> <b>ribbon</b> (red and black), and the interface allows color selection. Programs commonly use color-coding to distinguish user input from machine responses. The Soroban mechanism is unreliable and prone to jamming, particularly when shifting case or changing ribbon color.|$|R
50|$|An Addressograph {{system of}} the 1960s was {{essentially}} a Graphotype debossing machine for preparing address plates, a cassette-style plate feeder, a heavy-duty, rapidly moving <b>inked</b> <b>ribbon,</b> a platten for hand-feeding the mail piece, and a foot pedal for stamping the address. The individual steel address plates were inserted into card-sized frames which {{had a series of}} slots along the top where colored metal flags could also be inserted for sorting purposes. The plate assemblies were placed in steel cassettes resembling library card catalogue drawers, which were manually inserted into the machine. At the press of the foot pedal the plate assemblies were swapped in sequence in a similar fashion to a slide projector, placing an impression of the raised type onto the mail piece.|$|R
50|$|The printer had an {{expansion}} socket under {{the front cover}} which could accommodate either Apple's AppleTalk network card or 32K memory buffer card, but not {{both at the same}} time. Sequential Systems produced a 2-in-1 solution card that combined both features into one card, as well as larger memory buffer cards up to 1 MB. With an optional AppleTalk networking card installed, it was a low-cost alternative to the vastly more expensive LaserWriter. Another third-party innovation was an add-on peripheral called the ThunderScan, which allowed the printer to work as a low-cost optical scanner (the scanner mechanism temporarily replaced the <b>ink</b> <b>ribbon</b> cartridge).|$|E
50|$|Game {{designers}} often {{attempt to}} integrate the save points into {{the style of the}} game using skeuomorphism. Resident Evil represents save points with old fashioned typewriters (which require an <b>ink</b> <b>ribbon</b> item for each save), the Grand Theft Auto series used representations appropriate to the era of the setting: audio cassettes for the mid-1980s (Grand Theft Auto: Vice City), 3½-inch disks for the early-1990s (Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas), and compact discs for the late-1990s (Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories). Many RPGs integrate saving into the form of a journal that the characters write into, or auto-save whenever the character stays at an inn or other resting place.|$|E

The chart and the <b>ink</b> <b>ribbon</b> are driven either by a synchronous motor or by an impulse motor. Synchronous motors are commonly used in analog electric clocks, timers and other devices where correct time is required.|$|E
500|$|In the machine's {{original}} 1868 design, {{paper was}} placed horizontally {{on the top}} of the machine, held in place by a movable square frame (to provide line and letter spacing). Above the paper and centered on the device, an arm held an <b>inked</b> <b>ribbon</b> which crossed over a small metal plate. Depressing a key caused a typebar to rise from underneath the paper, pressing the paper upwards against the ribbon and thus printing an inked character. This method of imprinting required use of very thin, nonstandard paper (such as tissue paper). Two variants were produced with alternative methods of actuating the typebars: one in which the keys and typebars were connected by a series of wires and one in which the keys directly [...] "kicked" [...] the typebars upwards.|$|R
50|$|In {{the game}} itself, the auto-aiming {{function}} was disabled {{and the numbers}} of <b>ink</b> <b>ribbons</b> found by the player were reduced. Capcom also planned to eliminate the interconnected nature of item boxes, meaning that items could only be retrieved from the locations where they were originally stored. This change made it in preview copies of the US version, but {{was removed from the}} retail release. This particular game mechanic would resurface in its remake as part of an unlockable difficulty setting. Shinji Mikami noted that they made the American version harder {{at the request of the}} American staff so that the game could be rented and not be completed in a few days. Mikami said that this version proved fairly difficult for Capcom staff, who had to play very carefully to complete it.|$|R
