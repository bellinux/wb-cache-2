25|$|Mature teratomas, or dermoid cysts, {{are rare}} tumors {{consisting}} of mostly benign tissue that develop after menopause. The tumors consist of disorganized tissue with nodules of malignant tissue, {{which can be}} of various types. The most common malignancy is squamous cell carcinoma, but adenocarcinoma, basal-cell carcinoma, carcinoid tumor, neuroectodermal tumor, malignant melanoma, sarcoma, sebaceous tumor, and struma ovarii can also {{be part of the}} <b>dermoid</b> <b>cyst.</b> They are treated with surgery and adjuvant platinum chemotherapy or radiation.|$|E
25|$|A {{physical}} examination, {{including a}} pelvic examination, and a pelvic ultrasound (transvaginal or otherwise) are both essential for diagnosis: physical examination may reveal increased abdominal girth and/or ascites (fluid within the abdominal cavity), while pelvic examination may reveal an ovarian or abdominal mass. An adnexal mass {{is a significant}} finding that often indicates ovarian cancer, especially if it is fixed, nodular, irregular, solid, and/or bilateral. 13–21% of adnexal masses are caused by malignancy; however, there are other benign causes of adnexal masses, including ovarian follicular cyst, leiomyoma, endometriosis, ectopic pregnancy, hydrosalpinx, tuboovarian abscess, ovarian torsion, <b>dermoid</b> <b>cyst,</b> cystadenoma (serous or mucinous), diverticular or appendiceal abscess, nerve sheath tumor, pelvic kidney, ureteral or bladder diverticulum, benign cystic mesothelioma of the peritoneum, peritoneal tuberculosis, or paraovarian cyst. Ovaries that can be felt are also a sign of ovarian cancer in postmenopausal women. Other parts of a physical examination for suspected ovarian cancer can include a breast examination and a digital rectal exam. Palpation of the supraclavicular, axillary, and inguinal lymph nodes may reveal lymphadenopathy, which can be indicative of metastasis. Another indicator may be {{the presence of a}} pleural effusion, which can be noted on auscultation.|$|E
60|$|The faces {{which are}} {{produced}} in this amazing way {{are worthy of}} study. They {{do not appear to}} have represented anyone who has ever been known in life by Doctor Geley.[8] My impression after examining them is that they {{are much more likely to}} be within the knowledge of the subject, being girls of the French lower middle class type, such as Eva was, I should imagine, in the habit of meeting. It should be added that Eva herself appears in the photograph as well as the simulacra of humanity. The faces are, on the whole, both pretty and piquant, though of a rather worldly and unrefined type. The latter adjective would not apply to the larger and most elaborate photograph, which represents a very beautiful young woman of a truly spiritual cast of face. Some of the faces are but partially formed, which gives them a grotesque or repellant appearance. What are we to make of such phenomena? There is no use deluding ourselves by the idea that there may be some mistake or some deception. There is neither one nor the other. Apart from the elaborate checks upon these particular results, they correspond closely with those got by Lombroso in Italy, by Schrenk-Notzing in Germany, and by other careful observers. One thing we must bear in mind constantly in considering them, and that is their abnormality. At a liberal estimate, it is not one person in a million who possesses such powers--if a thing which is outside our volition can be described as a power. It is the mechanism of the materialisation medium which has been explored by the acute brain and untiring industry of Doctor Geley, and even presuming, as one may fairly presume, that every materialising medium goes through the same process in order to produce results, still such mediums are exceedingly, rare. Dr. Geley mentions, as an analogous phenomenon on the material side, the presence of dermoid cysts, those mysterious formations, which rise as small tumors in any part of the body, particularly above the eyebrow, and which when opened by the surgeon are found to contain hair, teeth or embryonic bones. There is no doubt, as he claims, some rough analogy, but the <b>dermoid</b> <b>cyst</b> is, at least, in the same flesh and blood plane of nature as the foetus inside it, while in the ectoplasm we are dealing with an entirely new and strange development.|$|E

30|$|Benign cystic teratoma, or {{commonly}} known as <b>dermoid</b> <b>cysts,</b> are basically germ-cell tumors of the ovary. Pathologically, they are enrolled under a group of benign, mature teratomas. They account for about 20 – 25 % of all ovarian neoplasm and occur bilaterally in 10 – 15 % of cases [1]. The prevalence of malignant transformation in <b>dermoid</b> <b>cysts</b> has been reported as 1 – 3 %.[2, 3] Most <b>dermoid</b> <b>cysts</b> occur without significant clinical symptoms and are often discovered incidentally during pelvic examination or routine ultrasound. The potential for complications such as torsion, spontaneous rupture, risk of chemical peritonitis, and malignancy usually makes surgical treatment quite necessary upon diagnosis [4].|$|R
40|$|The full {{understanding}} of {{the natural history of}} intracranial <b>dermoid</b> <b>cysts</b> has long remained incom-plete owing to the infrequent occurrence of these tumours, but of recent years a sufficient-number of isolated case reports have appeared to explain many of their obscure but interesting features.

50|$|A <b>dermoid</b> <b>cyst</b> is {{a mature}} cystic {{teratoma}} containing hair (sometimes very abundant) and other structures characteristic of normal skin and other tissues {{derived from the}} ectoderm.

50|$|As dermoid cysts grow {{slowly and}} contain mature tissue, {{this type of}} cystic {{teratoma}} is nearly always benign.
