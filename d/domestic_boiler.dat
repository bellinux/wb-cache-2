50|$|In {{the heating}} sector {{the country has}} long used and {{continues}} to develop district heating (DH) networks. Hot water or steam is produced centrally and then distributed through a network of insulated pipes to high population areas. Houses within a district heating area have heat exchangers installed instead of boilers for their heating and hot water requirements. The heat exchanger keeps the two water systems separate and means that heat can be adjusted as with a familiar <b>domestic</b> <b>boiler.</b> One simple but important innovation in the district heating network was the development of internally insulated pipes. The two pipes taking and receiving the return of water are placed inside a much larger pipe and insulating material is set so as to fill the figure eight shaped void between the two smaller and the large pipe. In 2013 district heating supplied over 60% of all households in Denmark with heating and hot water. The development of district heating technology has led Denmark to become a world leader in industrial pump and thermostat designs and its products are used in many industries worldwide.|$|E
50|$|The energy survey {{needed to}} produce an EPC is {{performed}} by an assessor who visits the property, examines key items such as loft insulation, <b>domestic</b> <b>boiler,</b> hot water tank, radiators, windows for double glazing, and so on. He or she then inputs the observations into a software program which performs the calculation of energy efficiency. The program gives a single number for the rating of energy efficiency, and a recommended value {{of the potential for}} improvement. There are similar figures for environmental impact. A table of estimated energy bills per annum (and the potential for improvement) is also presented, but without any reference to householder bills. The householder will {{have to pay for the}} survey, which costs around £60 for a four bedroom house. The exercise is entirely non-invasive, so the software will make assumptions on the insulation properties of various elements of the property based on age and construction type. The assessor has the ability to over-ride these assumptions if visual or written evidence is provided to support the presence of insulation which may have been subsequently installed.|$|E

In the present study, an analysis {{has been carried out}} on the effect of {{domestic heating}} on natural gas consumption and pollutants emissions.

40|$|The European Union aims {{to fulfill}} 20 % {{of the primary}} energy {{consumption}} with renewable energy sources, by 2020. Biomass has a great potential for domestic and industrial heating applications and these are amongst the most promising uses for biomass as they combine high efficiency and ease of use. Pellets are a good method for biomass distribution due to its quality standards and energy density which make them attractive to distribution and handling. In addition to the traditional use of sawdust as a raw material, {{there has been a}} growing interest in the incorporation of residues from industry processing such as the furniture sector. This paper reports the application of pellets made of residues from the furniture industry as a fuel source in domestic heating applications. Pellets were characterized according to their chemical and physical composition. They were subsequently burned in an automatic boiler rated at 15 kW. A probe in the exhaust chimney was used to continuously analyze the flue gases. In addition, the ashes chemical composition was also analyzed. The results show that these pellets have a good thermal efficiency in <b>domestic</b> <b>boilers,</b> releasing however large emissions of NOx, originated from the high concentration of nitrogen in its chemical composition. The ash analysis confirms the slagging and fouling prediction, and these problems were verified in the grate, chamber combustion and heat exchanger.

40|$|A key {{method used}} to reduce the {{environmental}} impact of a product is to make it more energy efficient. Previous studies have found that the potential benefits from improved efficiency are often at least partially negated by increased use of the product. This is called the ‘rebound effect’. The logical extension of this theory is to consider what happens when efficiency savings from one product lead to the purchase of, or greater use of, another. This paper considers this issue, called the ‘re-spending effect’, and uses the illustration of the purchase of an energy-efficient fridge-freezer and the installation of a high-efficiency <b>domestic</b> <b>boiler</b> to demonstrate the loss of up to 27 % of the potential environmental benefit when monetary savings are spent on other products and services. The paper concludes that the development of high value, long-lasting, low resource-use products should be encouraged as a way of counteracting the ‘re-spending ’ effect thus producing an overall reduction in energy use and its attendant environmental damage...|$|E

40|$|A {{major part}} of urban traffic in many European cities is due to {{diesel-powered}} vehicles, which occasionally, albeit illegally, run on heating gas oil rather than the more expensive road diesel; this practice is no doubt abetted {{by the fact that}} the properties of the two fuels are quite similar. The purpose of the work described in this paper was to look into the possibility of altering the properties of heating oil so as to make it less desirable as a diesel fuel but without adverse environmental effects. Tests were run with two diesel-powered vehicles and a <b>domestic</b> <b>boiler</b> and included measurements of emissions of smoke, carbon monoxide, unburnt hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, and boiler thermal efficiency. Smoke opacity of diesel exhaust was found to have an almost linear relationship with many of the basic interrelated properties (cetane number, viscosity, density) of fuels with similar distillation characteristics, whereas the presence of heavier components tended to increase smoke. Addition of aromatic oxygenates (cresols) reduced the cetane number of diesel fuel but at the same time reduced smoke and NOx in diesel exhaust; the same materials appeared to enhance the thermal efficiency of the boiler and lower its smoke emissions, while slightly increasing the emitted NO. © 1994 American Chemical Society...|$|E
40|$|International audienceFully {{premixed}} burners featuring high air-to-gas ratios {{are currently}} used, {{in order to}} reduce the NOx emission of domestic natural gas boilers. These burner-boiler combinations are sensitive to variations in operational conditions, which can lead to quite high undesirable acoustic noise emissions. The combustion dynamics leading to this phenomenon are not yet fully understood and optical diagnostic methods can be used for the analysis of these dynamic processes. An experimental study has been performed in a <b>domestic</b> <b>boiler</b> with three low-NOx-burners.

The coupling of flame fluctuations with the acoustic emission of the system clearly appears from these comparisons.
