5|$|The {{earliest}} surviving home {{in which}} Poe lived is in Baltimore, preserved as the <b>Edgar</b> <b>Allan</b> Poe House and Museum. Poe {{is believed to}} have lived in the home at the age of 23 when he first lived with Maria Clemm and Virginia (as well as his grandmother and possibly his brother William Henry Leonard Poe). It {{is open to the public}} and is also the home of the <b>Edgar</b> <b>Allan</b> Poe Society. Of the several homes that Poe, his wife Virginia, and his mother-in-law Maria rented in Philadelphia, only the last house has survived. The Spring Garden home, where the author lived in 1843–1844, is today preserved by the National Park Service as the <b>Edgar</b> <b>Allan</b> Poe National Historic Site. Poe's final home is preserved as the <b>Edgar</b> <b>Allan</b> Poe Cottage in the Bronx.|$|E

5|$|Thomas Holley Chivers (October 18, 1809 – December 18, 1858) was an American doctor-turned-poet {{from the}} state of Georgia. He {{is best known for his}} {{friendship}} with <b>Edgar</b> <b>Allan</b> Poe and his controversial defense of the poet after his death.|$|E
5|$|William Henry Leonard Poe, often {{referred}} to as Henry Poe, (January 30, 1807 – August 1, 1831) was a sailor, amateur poet and the older brother of <b>Edgar</b> <b>Allan</b> Poe and Rosalie Poe.|$|E
5|$|At the 27th British Academy Film Awards, Anthony B. Richmond won for Best Cinematography, and Don't Look Now {{received}} further nominations in the Best Film, Direction, Actor, Actress, Sound Track and Film Editing categories.

5|$|Presumed Innocent {{received}} several nominations, with particular recognition for its screenplay by Alan J. Pakula and Frank Pierson. The film received an <b>Edgar</b> <b>Allan</b> Poe Award nomination for Best Motion Picture, and a USC Scripter Award nomination for Pakula, Pierson and {{the novel by}} Turow.|$|E
5|$|The Lives did not attract enough {{critical}} {{attention to}} become a bestseller. A fair number were printed and sold, however, and far more copies of the Lives circulated than of Shelley's novels. Some of the volumes were illegally copied in the United States, where they were praised by the poet and critic <b>Edgar</b> <b>Allan</b> Poe. Not reprinted until 2002, Mary Shelley's biographies have until recently received little academic appreciation.|$|E
5|$|Thunderball won an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects {{awarded to}} John Stears in 1966. Ken Adam the {{production}} director was also {{nominated for a}} Best Production Design BAFTA award. The film won the Golden Screen Award in Germany and the Golden Laurel Action Drama award at the 1966 Laurel Awards. The film was also nominated for an Edgar Best Foreign Film award at the <b>Edgar</b> <b>Allan</b> Poe Awards.|$|E
5|$|<b>Edgar</b> <b>Allan</b> Poe, whose poetry {{had been}} {{included}} in Griswold's anthology, published a critical response that questioned which poets were included. This began a rivalry which grew when Griswold succeeded Poe as editor of Graham's Magazine at a higher salary than Poe's. Later, the two competed {{for the attention of}} poet Frances Sargent Osgood. They never reconciled their differences and, after Poe's mysterious death in 1849, Griswold wrote an unsympathetic obituary. Claiming to be Poe's chosen literary executor, he began a campaign to harm Poe's reputation that lasted until his own death eight years later.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the overlap between the writers of Unknown and Astounding, {{there was a good}} deal of overlap between their readerships: Asimov records that during the war, he read only these two magazines. Sf historian Paul Carter has argued that the spectrum of fantastic fiction from Weird Tales through Unknown to Astounding was far less cleanly separated than is sometimes assumed: many stories in the early science fiction magazines such as Wonder Stories were more like the works of <b>Edgar</b> <b>Allan</b> Poe than they were tales of scientific imagination.|$|E
5|$|Irving, {{along with}} James Fenimore Cooper, {{was among the}} first American writers to earn acclaim in Europe, and Irving {{encouraged}} American authors such as Nathaniel Hawthorne, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Herman Melville, and <b>Edgar</b> <b>Allan</b> Poe. Irving was also admired by some European writers, including Lord Byron, Thomas Campbell, Charles Dickens, Francis Jeffrey, and Walter Scott. Also, as the United States' first internationally best-selling author, Irving advocated for writing as a legitimate profession and argued for stronger laws to protect American writers from copyright infringement.|$|E
5|$|Nathaniel Parker Willis (January 20, 1806 – January 20, 1867), {{also known}} as N. P. Willis, was an American author, poet and editor who worked with several notable American writers {{including}} <b>Edgar</b> <b>Allan</b> Poe and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. He became the highest-paid magazine writer of his day. For a time, he was the employer of former slave and future writer Harriet Jacobs. His brother was the composer Richard Storrs Willis and his sister Sara wrote under the name Fanny Fern.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the early}} 2000s, NYU has {{developed}} new facilities on and around its Washington Square Campus. The Kimmel Center for University Life {{was built in}} 2003 as the primary location for the university's student services offices. It also houses the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts, the Rosenthal Pavilion, the Eisner & Lubin Auditorium, and the Loeb Student Center. The School of Law built Furman Hall in 2004, incorporating elements of two historic buildings into the new facade, one {{of which had been}} occupied by poet <b>Edgar</b> <b>Allan</b> Poe.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by George Meyer and {{directed}} by David Silverman. Voice actor Greg Berg guest starred as Rory, one of the homeless people at the soup kitchen. The episode features cultural references to Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, and the three poets Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, and <b>Edgar</b> <b>Allan</b> Poe. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. It acquired a Nielsen rating of 11.9, and was the third highest-rated show on the Fox network the week it aired.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{the return}} of the ship on which Mälzel died, his various machines, {{including}} the Turk, fell into the hands of a friend of Mälzel's, the businessman John Ohl. He attempted to auction off the Turk, but owing to low bidding ultimately bought it himself for $400. Only when John Kearsley Mitchell from Philadelphia, <b>Edgar</b> <b>Allan</b> Poe's personal physician and an admirer of the Turk, approached Ohl did the Turk change hands again. Mitchell formed a restoration club and went about the business of repairing the Turk for public appearances, completing the restoration in 1840.|$|E
5|$|Beauchamp {{was convicted}} of the murder and sentenced to hang. The morning of the execution, {{he and his wife}} {{attempted}} a double suicide by stabbing themselves with a knife she had smuggled into prison. She was successful; he was not. Beauchamp was rushed to the gallows before he could bleed to death, and was hanged on July 7, 1826. The bodies of Jereboam and Anna Beauchamp were arranged in an embrace and buried in a single coffin, as they had requested. The Beauchamp–Sharp Tragedy inspired fictional works such as <b>Edgar</b> <b>Allan</b> Poe's unfinished play, Politian, and Robert Penn Warren's World Enough and Time (1950).|$|E
5|$|Born into {{a wealthy}} Georgia family, Chivers became {{interested}} in poetry at a young age. After he and his first wife separated, he received a medical degree from Transylvania University but focused his energy on publishing rather than medicine. In addition to submitting poems to various magazines and journals, Chivers published several volumes of poetry, including The Lost Pleiad in 1845, as well as plays. <b>Edgar</b> <b>Allan</b> Poe showed {{an interest in the}} young poet and encouraged his work. Chivers spent the last few years of his life defending the reputation of Poe, who had died in 1849, though he also thought Poe had been heavily influenced by his own poetry. Chivers died in Georgia in 1858.|$|E
5|$|Charles's wife, Isabeau of Bavaria, {{held the}} ball to honor the {{remarriage}} of a lady-in-waiting. Scholars {{believe it was a}} traditional charivari, with the dancers disguised as wild men, mythical beings often associated with demonology, that were commonly represented in medieval Europe and documented in revels of Tudor England. The event was chronicled by contemporary writers such as the Monk of St Denis and Jean Froissart, and illustrated in a number of 15th-century illuminated manuscripts by painters such as the Master of Anthony of Burgundy. The incident later provided inspiration for <b>Edgar</b> <b>Allan</b> Poe's short story Hop-Frog.|$|E
5|$|No {{childhood}} home of Poe is still standing, including the Allan family's Moldavia estate. The oldest standing home in Richmond, the Old Stone House, is in use as the <b>Edgar</b> <b>Allan</b> Poe Museum, though Poe never lived there. The collection includes many items that Poe used {{during his time}} with the Allan family, and also features several rare first printings of Poe works. 13 West Range is the dorm room that Poe {{is believed to have}} used while studying at the University of Virginia in 1826; it is preserved and available for visits. Its upkeep is now overseen by a group of students and staff known as the Raven Society.|$|E
5|$|The Beauchamp–Sharp Tragedy {{inspired}} fictional works, notably <b>Edgar</b> <b>Allan</b> Poe's unfinished play Politian and Robert Penn Warren's World Enough and Time. William Gilmore Simms wrote three works {{based on}} the Sharp's murder and aftermath: Beauchampe: or The Kentucky Tragedy, A Tale of Passion, Charlemont, and Beauchampe: A Sequel to Charlemonte. Greyslaer: A Romance of the Mohawk by Charles Fenno Hoffman, Octavia Bragaldi by Charlotte Barnes, Sybil by John Savage, and Conrad and Eudora; or, The Death of Alonzo: A Tragedy and Leoni, The Orphan of Venice both by Thomas Holley Chivers, all draw to some degree on the events that surround Sharp's murder.|$|E
5|$|The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket (1838) is {{the only}} {{complete}} novel written by American writer <b>Edgar</b> <b>Allan</b> Poe. The work relates {{the tale of the}} young Arthur Gordon Pym, who stows away aboard a whaling ship called the Grampus. Various adventures and misadventures befall Pym, including shipwreck, mutiny, and cannibalism, before he is saved by the crew of the Jane Guy. Aboard this vessel, Pym and a sailor named Dirk Peters continue their adventures farther south. Docking on land, they encounter hostile black-skinned natives before escaping back to the ocean. The novel ends abruptly as Pym and Peters continue toward the South Pole.|$|E
5|$|The United States Military Academy (USMA) is an {{undergraduate}} college in West Point, New York {{with the mission}} of educating and commissioning officers for the United States Army. The list is drawn from non-graduate former cadets and cadet candidates. It {{is not unusual for}} the service academies to have high dropout rates. Of the original 103 cadets in the Class of 1826, only 43 graduated. Non-graduates of the Academy have entered a variety of fields. Notable non-graduates include <b>Edgar</b> <b>Allan</b> Poe (literature), James Abbott McNeill Whistler (art), Maynard James Keenan (music), Adam Vinatieri (football), and even the military: Jacob Zeilin, Lewis Addison Armistead, and Courtney Hodges.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Eliza Clemm Poe (née Clemm; August 15, 1822 – January 30, 1847) was {{the wife}} of American writer <b>Edgar</b> <b>Allan</b> Poe. The couple were first cousins and {{publicly}} married when Virginia Clemm was 13 and Poe was 26. Biographers disagree as {{to the nature of}} the couple's relationship. Though their marriage was loving, some biographers suggest they viewed one another more like a brother and sister. In January 1842 she contracted tuberculosis, growing worse for five years until she died of the disease at the age of 24 in the family's cottage, at that time outside New York City.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with other}} family members, Virginia Clemm and <b>Edgar</b> <b>Allan</b> Poe lived {{together}} {{off and on}} for several years before their marriage. The couple often moved to accommodate Poe's employment, living intermittently in Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York. A few years after their wedding, Poe was involved in a substantial scandal involving Frances Sargent Osgood and Elizabeth F. Ellet. Rumors about amorous improprieties on her husband's part affected Virginia Poe so much that on her deathbed she claimed that Ellet had murdered her. After her death, her body was eventually placed under the same memorial marker as her husband's in Westminster Hall and Burying Ground in Baltimore, Maryland. Only one image of Virginia Eliza Clemm Poe has been authenticated: a watercolor portrait painted several hours after her death.|$|E
5|$|Born Elizabeth Fries Lummis, in New York, she {{published}} {{her first}} book, Poems, Translated and Original, in 1835. She married the chemist William Henry Ellet {{and the couple}} moved to South Carolina. She had published several books and contributed to multiple journals. In 1845 she moved back to New York and took {{her place in the}} literary scene there. She was involved with a public scandal involving <b>Edgar</b> <b>Allan</b> Poe and Frances Sargent Osgood and, later, another involving Rufus Wilmot Griswold. Ellet's most important work, The Women of the American Revolution, was published in 1845. The three volume book profiled the lives of patriotic women in the early history of the United States. She continued writing until her death in 1877.|$|E
5|$|Following Kurosawa's death, several posthumous works {{based on}} his unfilmed screenplays have been produced. After the Rain, {{directed}} by Takashi Koizumi, was released in 1998, and The Sea is Watching, directed by Kei Kumai, premiered in 2002. A script created by the Yonki no Kai ("Club of the Four Knights") (Kurosawa, Keisuke Kinoshita, Masaki Kobayashi, and Kon Ichikawa), around the time that Dodeskaden was made, finally was filmed and released (in 2000) as Dora-Heita, by the only surviving {{founding member of the}} club, Kon Ichikawa. Huayi Brothers Media and CKF Pictures in China announced in 2017 plans to produce a film of Kurosawa's posthumous screenplay of The Masque of the Black Death by <b>Edgar</b> <b>Allan</b> Poe for 2020. Patrick Frater writing for Variety magazine in May 2017 stated that another two unfinished films by Kurosawa were planned, with Silvering Spear to start filming in 2018.|$|E
5|$|In 1820, rumors {{surfaced}} that Sharp had fathered a stillborn {{illegitimate child}} with Anna Cooke, a planter's daughter. Sharp denied the charge, and the immediate political effects were minimal. When {{the charges were}} repeated during Sharp's 1825 General Assembly campaign, opponents publicized the allegation {{that the child was}} a mulatto. Whether Sharp made such a claim, or whether it was a rumor started by his political enemies, remains in doubt. Jereboam Beauchamp, who had married Cooke in 1824, avenged the honor of his wife by fatally stabbing Sharp at his home early on the morning of November 7, 1825. Sharp's murder inspired fictional works, most notably <b>Edgar</b> <b>Allan</b> Poe's unfinished play Politian and Robert Penn Warren's novel World Enough and Time (1950).|$|E
5|$|Sometimes {{the text}} {{can give a}} basic outline that {{correlates}} to the four-movement scheme of a symphony. For instance, the four-part structure of <b>Edgar</b> <b>Allan</b> Poe's The Bells, a progression from youth to marriage, maturity, and death, naturally suggested the four movements of a symphony to Sergei Rachmaninoff, which he followed in his choral symphony of the same name. The text can encourage a composer to expand a choral symphony past the normal bounds of the symphonic genre, as with Berlioz for his Roméo et Juliette, yet stay within the basic structural or aesthetic intent of symphonic form. It can also influence the musical content in parts {{where there is no}} singing, as in Roméo et Juliette. There, Berlioz allows the orchestra to express the majority of the drama in instrumental music and saves words for expository and narrative sections of the work.|$|E
5|$|While Beauchamp's primary motive {{in killing}} Sharp was {{to defend the}} honor of his wife, {{speculation}} raged that Sharp's political opponents had instigated the crime. Sharp was {{a leader of the}} New Court party during the Old Court – New Court controversy in Kentucky. At least one Old Court partisan alleged that Sharp denied paternity of Cooke's son by claiming the child was a mulatto, the son of a family slave. Whether Sharp made such a claim has never been verified. New Court partisans insisted that the allegation was concocted to stir Beauchamp's anger and provoke him to murder. The Beauchamp–Sharp Tragedy served as the inspiration for numerous literary works, most notably <b>Edgar</b> <b>Allan</b> Poe's unfinished Politian and Robert Penn Warren's World Enough and Time (1950).|$|E
5|$|After a {{rejection}} of his poems by an eastern periodical, Riley began to formulate a plot to prove his work was of good quality {{and that it was}} being rejected only because his name was unknown in the east. Riley authored a poem imitating the style of <b>Edgar</b> <b>Allan</b> Poe and submitted it to the Kokomo Dispatch under a fictitious name claiming it was a long lost Poe poem. The Dispatch published the poem and reported it as such. Riley and two other men who were part of the plot waited two weeks for the poem to be published by major newspapers in Chicago, Boston, and New York to gauge their reaction; they were disappointed. While a few newspapers believed the poem to be authentic, the majority did not, claiming the quality was too poor to be authored by Poe. An employee of the Dispatch learned the truth of the incident and reported it to the Kokomo Tribune, which published an expose that outed Riley as a conspirator behind the hoax. The revelation damaged the credibility of the Dispatch and harmed Riley's reputation.|$|E
