5|$|Lavelli {{was born}} {{and grew up in}} Hudson, Ohio, a small town in the northeastern part of the state. Both of his parents were Italian immigrants. His father Angelo Lavelli was a {{blacksmith}} who made shoes for horses on nearby farms. As a child, he practiced catching by throwing baseballs against walls and trying to catch them when they bounced back. He liked to <b>have</b> <b>friends</b> throw ping-pong balls at him {{to see if he could}} catch them.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} dream sequence, Buffy is woken by Anya in her dorm room. She then finds {{herself in her}} room at home, where Tara speaks cryptically about the future. At the university, Buffy talks to her mother, {{who lives in the}} walls, then meets Riley at the Initiative. He has been {{promoted}} to Surgeon General and is drawing up plans with Adam (now in ordinary human form) for world domination. The three of them are interrupted by a demon attack, and Riley and Adam start to make a pillow fort. When Buffy finds her weapons bag, the only thing in it is mud, which she smears on her face. She is then transported to the desert and finally confronts the pre-verbal First Slayer; Tara is present to speak for her. Through Tara, the First Slayer tells Buffy that she cannot <b>have</b> <b>friends</b> and must work alone, which Buffy rejects. The Slayers fight in the desert and then in Buffy's living room next to her dying friends until Buffy realizes that she can stop the fight mentally by simply ignoring the First Slayer. She refuses to fight and walks away from the First Slayer; the First Slayer vanishes, and everybody wakes up.|$|E
25|$|Tajiri first {{conceived}} {{the idea of}} Pokémon in 1990. The idea came together after he saw a Game Boy {{and the ability to}} communicate between Game Boys, and Tajiri decided Pokémon made the most sense on the handheld console. Tajiri pioneered the idea of connectivity between handheld game consoles, by suggesting that Game Boys could use their link cables in order to <b>have</b> <b>friends</b> do more than simply play against each other.|$|E

All of its {{subsequent}} appearances, beginning in You Gotta <b>Have</b> <b>Friends,</b> are as a Weezing. In the Pokémon Adventures manga, Koffing is seen as one of Koga's Pokémon. When Koga and Blue are ambushed by Agatha's Gengar in Volume 7, Koga uses Koffing's smoke to relay his tactical plan to Blue without Gengar noticing. Koga's daughter, Janine, also has a Weezing on her team.|$|E
25|$|An {{international}} community is created {{with one or two}} teenagers each from a range of countries such as Finland, Poland, Ethiopia, France, Japan, South Korea, Ecuador, Hungary, Australia, Barbados, Italy, Nigeria, Iceland, Indonesia, Israel, Lithuania, Germany, Bulgaria, Ghana, Dominican Republic and Malaysia with children from all across the United States. Campers live together in tents at the US camps, and in rooms at the European camp. Bunking assignments are changed every two weeks, so that each student shares accommodations with 16 different young people {{over the course of a}} summer, during the course of which he or she is exposed to many different cultures and individuals. Dining hall table assignments are changed weekly, further supporting the opportunity to learn about others and make new friendships.

25|$|In a {{study done}} by social {{psychologist}} Shawn Burn, {{it was found that}} personal contact with individuals within a neighborhood is {{the most effective way to}} increase recycling within a community. In his study, he had 10 block leaders talk to their neighbors and persuade them to recycle. A comparison group was sent fliers promoting recycling. It was found that the neighbors that were personally contacted by their block leaders recycled much more than the group without personal contact. As a result of this study, Shawn Burn believes that personal contact within a small group of people is an important factor in encouraging recycling. Another study done by Stuart Oskamp examines the effect of neighbors and friends on recycling. It was found in his studies that people who had friends and neighbors that recycled were much more likely to also recycle than those who didn't <b>have</b> <b>friends</b> and neighbors that recycled.|$|E

25|$|In late December, early January 1847, {{visits from}} a friend from Vienna who lived in Paris—Baron Eduard von Lannoy—resulted in a letter from Lannoy to Giuseppe Donizetti in Constantinople {{outlining}} {{what he saw as}} a better solution: rather than <b>have</b> <b>friends</b> travel the five hours to see his brother, Lannoy recommended that Gaetano be moved to Paris where he could be taken care of by the same doctors. Giuseppe agreed and sent Andrea back to Paris, which he reached on 23 April. Visiting his uncle the following day, he found himself recognized. He was able to go on to convince the Paris Prefect, by threats of family action and general public concern, and the composer should be moved to an apartment in Paris. This took place on 23 June and, while there, he was able to take rides in his carriage and appeared to be much more aware of his surroundings. However, he was held under virtual house arrest by the police for several more months, although able to be visited by friends and even by Verdi while he was in Paris. Finally—on 16 August—in Constantinople, Giuseppe filed a formal complaint with the Austrian ambassador (given that the composer was an Austrian citizen).|$|E
25|$|Phillips {{was arrested}} {{that day at}} his school. He was held in maximum {{security}} {{as he made his}} first court appearance. It was determined that Clifton's cause of death was due to stabbing and clubbing with a baseball bat. Phillips claimed the event happened one afternoon when he was home alone, Maddie came to his house asking him to come outside and play baseball, Phillips agreed even though he was not allowed to <b>have</b> <b>friends</b> over while his parents were not home. As the two were playing baseball, Maddie threw the ball at him and he hit it, which caused the ball to strike the 8-year-old's eye, causing her to bleed, leading Clifton to cry and scream. Phillips panicked, fearing the reaction that his father would give when he got home and saw the aftermath. Phillips proceeded to drag Clifton into his home and then into his room and strangle her with a phone cord for approximately 15 minutes. Soon after, he hit her again with the baseball bat and stashed her under his bed, not long after Josh's father entered the house, Phillips went to interact with his father for a short moment and then went back to his room and found that Clifton was still alive moaning under his bed, he took off the mattress and stabbed her 11 times, killing the 8-year-old.|$|E

500|$|Actor Jim Beaver {{described}} Bobby as a [...] "rough but warmhearted" [...] working-class {{man with}} the outlook that [...] "sometimes {{there are things that}} need to be done and they're not fun to do, but they gotta be done anyway". When the [...] "usually level-headed" [...] hunter must use a wheelchair in the fifth season, he becomes [...] "frustrated and angry"; instead of being able to join the battles, he is [...] "stuck at home manning the telephones". This feeling of uselessness eventually leads to thoughts of suicide, though he deems himself too much of a coward to go through with it. On the situation, Beaver commented, [...] "Bobby lives in a world where all kinds of strange things are possible. Somewhere along the line, he has a hope that one of these strange, miraculous things might happen to him. I think he is also a realist. He understands that even when you <b>have</b> <b>friends</b> that come back from the dead, not everything that you want to happen is going to happen." ...|$|E
500|$|Around {{the time}} he began {{recording}} his final album, Smith began to display signs of paranoia, often believing that a white van followed him wherever he went. He would <b>have</b> <b>friends</b> drop him off for recording sessions almost a mile away from the studio, and to reach the location, he would trudge through hundreds of yards of brush and cliffs. He started telling people that DreamWorks was out to get him: [...] "Not long ago my house was broken into, and songs were stolen off my computer which have {{wound up in the}} hands of certain people who work at a certain label. I've also been followed around for months at a time. I wouldn't even want to necessarily say it's the people from that label who are following me around, but it was probably them who broke into my house." [...] During this period, Smith hardly ate, subsisting primarily on ice cream. He would go without sleeping for several days and then sleep for an entire day.|$|E

500|$|While in prison, Cox mailed several {{letters to}} the St. Petersburg Times in 2008 in which he accused {{politician}} Kevin White of taking bribes from him during Cox's criminal career. He claims he made payoffs to White, an ultimately successful candidate for the Tampa City Council, in 2002 and 2003. Cox said White {{told him he could}} not receive the money directly, and suggested that Cox <b>have</b> <b>friends</b> donate $500 each, and then reimburse them. Records and statements from those who donated show that Cox did in fact make numerous contributions to White's campaign, and reimbursed others who did so as well. White, he claims, agreed to vote to rezone vacant properties in Tampa and Ybor City. When Cox was first arrested, the FBI talked to him about White, whom they were also investigating, and he told them the same information. He claimed to have paid him $7,000 in cash in addition to the recorded contributions he arranged. When White and a fellow City Council member were told Cox's contributions might have been illegal in 2004, his colleague told the police, while White kept silent. White has denied that he knew these contributions were reimbursed, and called Cox's accusations [...] "the jailhouse ramblings of a reputed con man." [...] White said he befriended Cox when he came to believe the con man was interested in revitalizing Tampa Heights. Cox had fled the Tampa area before White cast any rezoning votes, so there is no voting record which could help confirm the validity of his accusations. In 2012, White, who had gone on to serve as Hillsborough County Commissioner, was convicted of unrelated federal bribery and corruption charges and sentenced to three years in federal prison.|$|E
500|$|Eric Goldman of IGN {{scored the}} episode an 8.3 out of 10, praising the visual style, {{which he called}} [...] "less glossy" [...] than {{previous}} episodes, {{as well as the}} introduction of new characters and development of old ones, especially the introduction of Carl Creel and the [...] "nicely done FX showing off his power". He did note that the episode [...] "did little to actually give Hunter or Mack [...] " [...] and stated [...] "I don’t really buy that Fitz would even be there, working alongside the team, at this point. Doesn't he <b>have</b> <b>friends</b> or family he could be with?" [...] Marc Buston for Den of Geek scored the episode 4.5 stars out of 5, feeling that the series had finally reached its potential by incorporating Marvel elements such as Creel and Whitehall, while also creating a darker tone and developing the original characters. He specifically highlighted the changes made to Fitz's character, saying [...] "This lair of tragedy greatly deepens Fitz’s character and gives the comic relief of last season a heartbreaking edge." [...] James Hunt, also for Den of Geek, gave a positive review as well, stating [...] "The momentum of last season's finale hasn't been lost, and indeed, it's even been added to. Last year I criticised the pilot episode for, above all else, failing to recreate the feel of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This year, it's only fair that I praise the season opener for doing exactly that." [...] He did feel, however, that the opening sequence featuring Carter was [...] "by some distance, the most exciting part of the episode". Kevin Fitzpatrick at Screen Crush called the premiere [...] "unexpectedly good", noting that the series [...] "remains as serialized a show as it can over 22 episodes", introducing interesting ideas {{for the rest of the}} season, while also setting a high standard for subsequent episodes to meet. He concluded that the series [...] "definitely seems to have hit a major groove".|$|E
