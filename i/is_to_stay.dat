He, Maggie, and Jimmy (James Allen McCune) bring Rick to a forest swamp where two walkers are stuck.

5|$|Kanons story {{revolves}} around {{a group of}} five girls whose lives {{are connected to the}} same boy. Yuichi Aizawa is a second-year high school student who had visited the city where the story takes place seven years prior to Kanons beginning. The story opens on Wednesday January 6, 1999 when Yuichi arrives in the city and is very detached from it and its inhabitants. Prior to his return, it is decided that he <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> with his first cousin, Nayuki Minase, and her mother, Akiko. After his long absence, Yuichi has forgotten almost everything except minor details of what happened seven years before and is in need of being reminded of what he left behind. Nayuki initially tries repeatedly to jog his memory, but is unsuccessful. Throughout the story, as he learns about the supernatural undertones of the city, Yuichi is reminded of the events of seven years ago.|$|E
5|$|The vessels {{have four}} decks, upon {{which there are}} cabins and saloons for merchants. Several of these 'mysria' contain {{cupboards}} and other conveniences; they have doors which can be locked, and keys for their occupiers. (The merchants) take with them their wives and concubines. It often happens that a man can be in his cabin without others on board realizing it, {{and they do not}} see him until the vessel has arrived in some port. The sailors also have their children in such cabins; and (in some parts of the ship) they sew garden herbs, vegetables, and ginger in wooden tubs. The Commander of such a vessel is a great Emir; when he lands, the archers and the Ethiops (i.e. black slaves, yet in China these men-at-arms would have most likely been Malays) march before him bearing javelins and swords, with drums beating and trumpets blowing. When he arrives at the guesthouse where he <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay,</b> they set up their lances {{on each side of the}} gate, and mount guard throughout his visit.|$|E

25|$|The boxer or out-fighter {{tends to}} be most {{successful}} against a brawler, whose slow speed (both hand and foot) and poor technique makes him an easy target to hit for the faster out-fighter. The out-fighter's main concern <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> alert, as the brawler only needs to land one good punch to finish the fight. If the out-fighter can avoid those power punches, he can often wear the brawler down with fast jabs, tiring him out. If he is successful enough, he may even apply extra pressure in the later rounds {{in an attempt to}} achieve a knockout. Most classic boxers, such as Muhammad Ali, enjoyed their best successes against sluggers.|$|E
25|$|A heavily fictionalized {{version of}} Agrippa {{is one of}} the playable {{characters}} (the other being an equally fictionalized Augustus) in the video game Shadow of Rome. There, Agrippa is sentenced to become a gladiator after his father was wrongly sentenced for assassinating Caesar. Agrippa's goal <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> alive as a gladiator for as long as possible, while Augustus acts as an infiltrator who slowly exposes the conspiracy against Caesar. Eventually, Augustus is able to prove Vipsanius' innocence and both of them are pardoned. Then a civil war breaks out, because the direct successor was outraged by exposure of the conspiracy. Agrippa and Augustus fight against Antonius. Agrippa also appears as a Great Admiral in the computer game Sid Meier's Civilization V.|$|E
25|$|Tropico 2 is a city-building game. Though {{much of it}} {{is based}} on the {{original}} Tropico, the gameplay is very different. The player runs a pirate island and, as the Pirate King, must keep the pirates happy while stealing as much booty as possible. Workers, called captives, are taken on raids, from shipwrecks off the player's island, or from nations with which an alliance has been established. The captives are responsible for production and construction on the island. They can take on most of the jobs available, including farmer, lumberjack, and blacksmith, and can even be promoted to a pirate. Skilled captives may perform more specialized jobs which unskilled captives cannot. Still, the main goal of the game, other than the objectives stated in a scenario, <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> in power, much like the original Tropico.|$|E

25|$|Chase {{reports from}} orbit that an Ashiyyur warship is inbound at high speed. Then another appears, slowing to make orbit around Sim's world of exile. Alex warns Chase {{to abandon their}} rented ship for the Corsarius; she does so just before the first Ashiyyur warship destroys their rented ship. Alex joins her and learns that the Armstrong drive on the Corsarius won’t be fully charged for about a day. Their problem <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> alive until the Armstrong drive is ready. They borrow a classic {{maneuver}} from one of Sim’s battles and leave orbit at high speed headed directly toward the incoming Ashiyyur warship, which cannot slow its speed quickly enough to meet them. It uses lasers to disable Corsarius magnetic drives; Chase realizes too late that she has forgotten to raise the ship’s shields. The Ashiyyur warship reverses its trajectory and reaches them about ten hours before they can jump. It demands their surrender. Through a strategem, Alex and Chase are able to fire Corsarius’ major weapons at it, damaging it badly and forcing it to flee. Ten hours later, the interstellar drive activates. It is not an Armstrong drive but something else, product of Rashim Machesney’s genius. In an eye blink, Corsarius is in orbit around Rimway, and safe.|$|E

2500|$|The game {{of chicken}} models two drivers, both {{headed for a}} single-lane bridge from {{opposite}} directions. [...] The first to swerve away yields the bridge to the other.

[...] It is presumed that the best thing for each driver <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> straight while the other swerves (since the other is the [...] "chicken" [...] while a crash is avoided). [...] Additionally, a crash is presumed to be the worst outcome for both players. [...] This yields a situation where each player, in attempting to secure his best outcome, risks the worst.|$|E
2500|$|The pernicious Three Corpses/Worms work to harm their host's {{health and}} fate by {{initiating}} sicknesses, inviting other disease-causing agents into the body, and reporting their host's transgressions to the gods.

2500|$|Length – Boards for {{children}} are {{as short as}} boards for racers, or [...] "alpine" [...] riders, are as long as [...] Most people ride boards in the [...] range. Board length used to {{be judged by the}} height of your chin. If a board held next to the frontside of your body came to your chin then it was an acceptable length. Due to the development of new technologies and board shapes, people can now ride a wider range of board sizes. Rather, the length of a snowboard corresponds mainly to the style, weight, and preference of the rider. A good rule of thumb <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> within the recommended manufacturer weight range. The longer the board, the more stable it is at high speed, {{but it is also a}} bit tougher to maneuver. Another factor riders consider when selecting a snowboard is the type of riding it will be used for, freestyle boards being shorter than all-mountain boards.|$|E
