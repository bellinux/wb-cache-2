However, rather unusually, {{it is not}} specified what types of lights and sirens can be used. Since {{emergency vehicles}} are usually imported {{from other parts of}} the world, one can see a great variety of light colors and siren types in Colombia. Since most law enforcement duties are consolidated in the National Police, there is some uniformity in police vehicles. Until the early 1990s, these police vehicles were equipped with yellow lights, although today they are equipped with a single red and blue LED lightbar on the roof, and sometimes supplementary red, white, and blue grille lights. Other, more minor law enforcement vehicles (Military Police, CTI, UNP) generally follow the same scheme.|$|E

In current Ethernet implementations, a wire pair is dedicated to this task. By making network checking unnecessary, <b>demand</b> <b>priority</b> frees a wire pair. This is fortunate,because the 100BaseVG specifications use quartet signalling, which needs four available wire pairs.

As regards the real-time property of the <b>demand</b> <b>priority</b> network, unnecessary blocking time due to its round-robin-based MAC protocol may cause periodic messages to miss their hard deadlines and result in low schedulability of periodic messages. We propose a new message scheduling algorithm to enforce a priority-based preemptive message transmission on the frame basis. Before a node transmits a periodic message, it broadcasts the priority of message for all nodes to construct a networkwide ready queue in order of priority. A node can transmit a periodic message only when its message is {{at the head of}} the ready queue. We have derived sufficient and necessary conditions for both static and dynamic priority assignment in order to determine the schedulability of periodic messages. The simulation study shows that the proposed algorithm significantly improves the guarantee ratio of periodic messages. ...|$|E

In a country like India the rainfall being completely seasonal and the amount of rainfall being so less, {{it has been a}} tough task for engineers to find out innovative ways to keep water in abundance till the rain arrives. If the engineers were taking initiatives for preserving water for future use, a heavy constant rainfall for days may cause flood in the nearby areas. So an assessment became necessary to carry out observations using the previously recorded data of flow of water in a river so that they can predict amount of water to be present in a reservoir monthly so that water can be supplied for all <b>demands</b> including high <b>priority</b> <b>demand,</b> low <b>priority</b> <b>demand</b> and maintain a downstream flow.

This method provides a different view from one that starts with climate and projects it, in isolation, {{as the source of}} a hypothetical security burden. That said, the Arctic does appear to present high-priority security challenges. Uncertainty in the timing of an ice-free Arctic affects how quickly it will become a security priority.
