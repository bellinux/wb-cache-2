40|$|Discharge lamps {{that have}} {{electrodes}} are classified into two categories, <b>hot</b> <b>cathode</b> <b>lamps</b> (HCLs) and cold <b>cathode</b> <b>lamps</b> (CCLs). We investigated {{the relationship between}} the presence of Hg, the kinds of rare gases present, and the cathode fall voltage (CFV) of both CCLs and HCLs. The results show mainly two points. One is the difference in the CFV characteristics, that is CCLS' CFV is positive, while HCLs' is negative. This is because the emission mechanism of CCLs, due to the gamma effect, differs from that of HCLs due to the Schottky effect. The other main point is the influence of Hg on the CFV. The CFV of CCLs increases when Hg is present because of the difference between γ-coefficients for Ne^+and Hg^ due to the energy potentials. The CFV of HCL also increases when Hg is present because of the difference between the cathode temperatures in an Ar discharge and an Ar-Hg discharge...|$|R

40|$|To {{improve the}} {{efficiency}} of the cold <b>cathode</b> <b>lamp</b> (CCL), it is important to select the optimum electrode material to reducing the cathode fall voltage (CFV). Furthermore, it is necessary to understand the relationship between the electrode material and the CFV. Considering the above, we measured the CCL's CFV with an indirect CFV measurement method using a <b>hot</b> <b>cathode</b> fluorescent <b>lamp.</b> By observing the negative glow of the electrode, we investigated the relationship between the CFV and the negative glow condition. The results showed that there is a relationship between the CCL's CFV and the γ coefficient of the electrode. Moreover, they make it clear that there is a relation between the CFV and the negative glow condition of each electrode material. We conclude that the CFV measurement method is useful for estimating the performance of a CCL's electrode...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{characteristics}} of nanotip-enhanced plasma lamps (NTL) as a backlight for liquid crystal displays {{have been investigated}} on a 14 -in panel. Using a direct-current pulse bipolar waveform driving, the NTL operates with lower igni-tion and sustain voltages below 300 V compared with conven-tional plasma lamps due to the tiny discharge gap between the indium tin oxide electrode and nanotip electrodes. Lumi-nous efficiencies of 16 lm/W at the lowest ignition voltage of 150 V have been realized for NTL, which correspond to 3780 cd/m 2 of luminance in 260 V with 50 torr of pure xenon gas. Index Terms—Lamps, LCD, microdischarge. R ECENTLY, backlighting liquid crystal display (LCD) panels has become a key research issue for increasing the diagonal size for monitor to television applications. In increasing the diagonal size of the panel, cost is a major factor. Light-emitting diode backlight is still expensive compared with other backlights such as cold <b>cathode</b> fluorescent <b>lamp,</b> <b>hot</b> <b>cathode</b> fluorescent <b>lamp,</b> external electrode fluorescent lamp, and flat fluorescent lamp. Furthermore, the driving voltage of the existing backlights {{is higher than the}} 1 – 2 kV required to operate LCD. Producing difficulties in terms of luminous efficiency, cost, and electrical hazard. In this paper, we report on the nanotip-enhanced plasma lamp (NTL) using nanotip electrodes which are fabricated by semiconductor processes. The NTL ignites a wide and stable plasma along the indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode and silver electrodes on the front and rear panels, respectively [1]. The NTL excited the phosphor layer by vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) and generated visible white light at a lower ignition voltage because of the field emission at the nanotip electrodes. A plasma lamp has been reported, which used carbon nanotube as a needle electrode to converge the equipotential lines to improve the local electric field and generate the field emission [2]. The NTL uses xenon as a discharge gas to replace mercury. We investigated a 14 -in NTL mercury free flat plasma lamp for LCD backlight with low driving voltage, high luminance, and luminous efficiency...|$|R
25|$|However, {{there are}} also tubes that operate in cold cathode mode, whereby {{electrons}} are liberated into the tube only by the large potential difference (voltage) between the electrodes. This {{does not mean the}} electrodes are cold (indeed, they can be very hot), but it does mean they are operating below their thermionic emission temperature. Because cold <b>cathode</b> <b>lamps</b> have no thermionic emission coating to wear out, they can have much longer lives than <b>hot</b> <b>cathode</b> tubes. This quality makes them desirable for maintenance-free long-life applications (such as backlights in liquid crystal displays). Sputtering of the electrode may still occur, but electrodes can be shaped (e.g. into an internal cylinder) to capture most of the sputtered material so it is not lost from the electrode.|$|R
