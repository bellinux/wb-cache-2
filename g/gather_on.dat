5|$|With {{the closure}} of the rail terminus, Vauxhall Bridge's main source of revenue was {{visitors}} to the Vauxhall Gardens pleasure park.

A large crowd also assembled on the bridge in September 1844 to watch Mister Barry, a clown from Astley's Amphitheatre, sail from Vauxhall Bridge to Westminster Bridge in a washtub towed by geese.|$|E

5|$|As {{promised by}} Fillmore, treaty commissioners arrived in La Pointe in 1854 to {{conclude}} a final treaty. Recalling {{the experiences of}} 1837 and 1842, the Ojibwa leaders sought to control the negotiations in 1854. Ambiguity in those treaties had been partially to blame for ensuing problems, so Buffalo insisted he would accept no interpreter other than Armstrong, whom he referred to as his adopted son. The Ojibwa insisted on a guarantee {{of the right to}} hunt, fish, and <b>gather</b> <b>on</b> all the ceded territory, and on the establishment on several reservations across western Upper Michigan, northern Wisconsin, and northeastern Minnesota. In his mid-nineties and in failing health, Buffalo directed the negotiations but left most of the speaking to other chiefs. He entrusted Armstrong with taking care of the details in the written version.|$|E
5|$|As soon as {{they were}} ready, the charges were blown and Nuneaton started to tow Likomba out of the harbour. Aboard Duchessa d'Aosta, 11 men had managed to get aboard from Vulcan; while one group planted charges on the anchor chains, another searched below decks {{collecting}} prisoners. Blowing the anchor chains, Vulcan started to tow Duchessa d'Aosta out of the harbour. The explosions had alerted the population of the town, who started to <b>gather</b> <b>on</b> the pier, but no attempts were made to stop the ships from leaving. Several anti-aircraft emplacements opened fire at imaginary targets, believing the explosions to have been caused by an aerial attack, but the six-inch guns protecting the harbour itself remained silent. From entering the harbour to leaving with the ships under tow, the operation had taken 30 minutes, without any losses to the raiding party.|$|E
5|$|During the {{breeding}} season, sea lions <b>gather</b> <b>on</b> both sandy and rocky shores. On warm days, they lie {{closer to the}} water. At night or in cool weather, they travel farther inland or to higher elevations. Non-breeding individuals may gather at marinas, wharves, or even navigational buoys. California sea lions can also live in fresh water for periods of time, such as near Bonneville Dam, nearly 150 miles up the Columbia River. In 2004 a healthy sea lion was found sitting on a road in Merced County, California, almost a hundred miles upstream from the San Francisco Bay and {{half a mile from}} the San Joaquin River.|$|E
