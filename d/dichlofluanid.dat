40|$|Methyl-tert-butyl ether (MTBE), a fuel {{oxygenate}} that {{is added}} to gasoline, commonly contaminates aquatic systems, {{many of which are}} already contaminated with pesticides. The toxic effects (EC 50 value) of several pure pesticides (Diuron, Linuron, <b>Dichlofluanid,</b> Sea nine, Irgarol and tributyltin (TBT)) were measured and compared with the EC 50 value of the pesticide mixed with MTBE, using the Vibrio fischeri and Daphnia magna acute toxicity assays. The interaction between chemicals was evaluated in terms of the effects of mixing on the EC 50 value (i. e. the concentration (mg/L) of a compound or mixture that is required to produce a 50 % change in a toxic response parameter) and the time required to generate the toxic response. Presence of MTBE enhanced the EC 50 value of several pesticides (Diuron, <b>Dichlofluanid,</b> TBT and Linuron) and/or the toxic response manifested more rapidly than with pure pesticides. Toxicity enhancements were quite substantial in many cases. For example, the presence of MTBE increased the toxicity of Diuron by more than 50 % when tested with the V. fischeri assay (5, 15 and 30 min exposure). Also, the toxic response manifested itself within 5 min whereas without the MTBE the same response arose in 30 min.

40|$|The {{procedure}} for testing the emission of biocides {{into the air}} {{is based on an}} emission test chamber in combination with an appropriate sampling and analysis procedure. Especially a test chamber based on a 20 l - exsiccator has been found to have advantages against other test chambers under certain boundary conditions with regard to wall-sink-effects. For the sampling of the investigated biocides (Pentachlorophenole, Lindane, Furmecyclox, <b>Dichlofluanid,</b> Propiconazole, Tebuconazole, Permethrin, Deltamethrin) polyurethanefoam (PUF) as adsorbent has been used very successfully in combination with different desorption procedures (soxhletextraction, supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), elution). Under the aspect of time and apparative costs especially the simple elution of the PUF with acetone can be recommended. Analysis has been done by using capillary gaschromatography in combination with different detectors (FID, NPD, ECD, MSD, AED). If the analysis is done by capillary gaschromatrography generally also the use of other adsorbents (e. g. Tenax or glas wool) is possible in combination with thermal desorption, but only in a half qualitative way. If Tenax is used in combination with thermal desorption some of the higher volatile wood preservatives (Lindane, Furmecyclox, <b>Dichlofluanid)</b> can be quantitatively analysed and generally also other ingredients of the wood preservatives. This has been shown in some cases for solvents and plasticizers. With the test procedure it is possible to determine the emission of biocides like Lindane, Furmecyclox, <b>Dichlofluanid,</b> Propiconazole, Tebuconazole, Permethrin and with restrictions Deltamethrin and additionally Pentachlorophenole. It can be expected that the test procedure can also be used for other materials than wood and wood based products and for other biocides being in a comparable range of volatility. For special cases the suitability of the test method has to be validated. (orig.)

40|$|This study {{involved}} assessments of therapeutant effects on pollination and fruit set; of temperature effects on pollen germination and pollen tube growth in apples, peaches and kiwifruits; of flowerage effects on pollen germination and pollen tube growth in kiwifruit styles; and of hand pollination effects on fruit set, fruit weight and seed numbers per fruit in kiwifruit vines. From {{the point of}} view of their in vitro effects on pollen germination therapeutants can be listed in order of decreasing inhibitory effect as follows: (a) for apples - mancozeb plus dinocap, triforine, <b>dichlofluanid,</b> bupirimate, bayleton, citowett R captan and mancozeb; (b) for peaches - triforine, vinclozoline, streptomycin plus triforine, mancozeb, captafol, iprodione, <b>dichlofluanid,</b> streptomycin and benomyl; and (c) for kiwifruits - <b>dichlofluanid,</b> captan and vinclozoline. However, it appeared that while in vitro a therapeutant was very inhibitory, the application of a spray to anthers in an intact flower did not affect the germination of pollen subsequently released by those anthers. Fungicides proven to be toxic to pollen in vitro did not necessarily produce similarly toxic effects in vivo. Reasons for such varying effects of fungicides on pollen germination and pollen tube growth in vitro and in vivo are suggested. At 24 hours after pollination the number of pollen tubes growing more than 1 / 2 the style length of kiwifruit (Hayward) flowers one to two days old were 38 % and 27 % higher than in flowers less than one day old and more than three days old respectively. In apples 5 sprays of either bayleton or captan, 3 sprays of either of the therapeutants mancozeb, mancozeb plus dinocap, and triforine and a wetting agent citowett R applied during bloom period caused no effect in fruit set in Golden Delicious trees; and 3 bupirimate sprays during bloom period had no effect on the fruit set in Splendour trees. In peaches 6 sprays of either captafol, or benomyl or iprodione, 5 sprays of either mancozeb or vinclozoline or streptomycin or triforine during bloom period caused no effect on fruit set in Golden Queen trees. Three sprays of streptomycin or <b>dichlofluanid</b> caused no effect but 3 sprays of triforine, triforine plus streptomycin or of ethephon caused 50 %, 70 % and 90 % reduction in fruit set in Red Haven peach trees. In kiwifruits 3 sprays of either <b>dichlofluanid,</b> captan or vinclozoline reduced seed numbers per fruit by 37 % but did not affect fruit set or fruit weight. Thus in vitro and in vivo studies were useful in determining therapeutant effects on pollen but did not necessarily provide information on their effects on fruit set in apple, peach and kiwifruit and on fruit weight and seed numbers per fruit in kiwifruit. The germination of both apple and peach pollen was higher at 24 °C than at 16 °C, 20 °C, 28 °C and at 32 °C. After 18 hours incubation pollen tubes were longer at 28 °C and at 32 °C than at 16 °C, 20 °C and 24 °C. In vivo studies with kiwifruit (Matua) pollen showed that pollen germination at 14 °C, 18 °C, 22 °C and 26 °C did not differ significantly. Temperatures both higher and lower than the temperature range 18 to 22 °C were found to be inhibitory to pollen tube growth in kiwifruit (Hayward) styles. Hand pollination of flowers did not influence percentage fruit set but increased fruit weight and seed numbers per fruit in kiwifruit (Hayward) vines. Because fruit weight was positively correlated with seed number per fruit in fruits from both bee pollinated and bee plus hand pollinated flower clusters, supplementary pollination may play an important role in the production of fruit in kiwifruit orchards...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: A rapid, {{selective}} {{and sensitive}} gas chromatographic method is described {{for the analysis}} of four fungicides - pyrimethanil, metalaxyl, penconazol and <b>dichlofluanid,</b> widely used in vineyards - in must and wine, as well as samples during alcoholic fermentation. The effect of alcoholic fermentation on pyrimethanil concentration in synthetic and real musts was studied. RESULTS: The proposed method was based on liquid-liquid extraction followed by gas chromatography with nitrogen-phosphorus detector. n-Hexane was the most appropriate solvent for extracting the target fungicides in synthetic and real samples. Quality parameters of the proposed method presented good recovery (ca 78. 3 % for almost all compounds) and precision (between 1. 4 % and 6. 1 %), and quantification limits lower than maximum residue limits. However, for dichl of luanid recovery levels of well over 100 % were found. CONCLUSIONS: There was no matrix effect in the analysis of pyrimethanil, metalaxyl or penconazol, but this effect was observed for <b>dichlofluanid</b> in synthetic and real matrices. The application of the fermentative process on pyrimethanil fungicide caused a high decrease in the concentration of this compound, and no product appeared in degradation. The decrease of pyrimethanil in fermented samples was similar in both synthetic and real samples. Â© 2009 Society of Chemical Industry.

40|$|Exposure data on {{biocides}} {{are relatively}} rare in published literature, especially for secondary exposure. This {{is also the}} case for antifouling exposure. Therefore, a field study was carried out measuring exposure to antifouling paints. Both primary exposure (rolling and spraying) and secondary exposure (during sand blasting) were studied. Exposure during rolling was measured in boatyards where paints containing <b>dichlofluanid</b> (DCF) were applied. Spraying was measured in dockyards (larger than boatyards) where paints containing copper were applied. Furthermore, during sand blasting the removal of old paint layers containing copper was measured. A total of 54 datasets was collected, both for inhalation and dermal exposure data. For paint and stripped paint bulk analyses were performed. The following values are all arithmetic means of the datasets. Inhalation of copper amounted to 3 mg m- 3 during spraying and to 0. 8 mg m- 3 during sand blasting. Potential body exposure loading amounted to 272 mg h- 1 copper during spraying and 33 mg h- 1 during sand blasting. For <b>dichlofluanid</b> the inhalation exposure loading was 0. 14 mg m- 3 during rolling, whereas the potential body exposure loading was 267 mg h- 1 and potential hand exposure loading 277 mg h- 1. The results for primary exposure compare well to the very few public data available. For the secondary exposure (sand blasting) no comparable data were available. The present study shows that the exposure loading should be considered more extensively, including applicable protective gear.

Biofouling is a natural process that involves the settlement and growth of fouling organisms such as barnacles, bryozoans, hydroids and mussels on natural or man-made structures and finally leads to material deterioration (Pérez et al. 2014; Li et al. 2013). In the early years, paints containing toxic materials like copper, lead, mercury and arsenic were used to control biofouling until organotins such as tributyltin (TBT) and triphenyltin were introduced in the 1960 s (Qian et al. 2010; Omae 2003). However, because of the hypertoxicity to the marine ecological environment, fishery and aquaculture (Rittschof 2001), {{an increasing number of}} countries have ratified an international treaty to ban the application of antifouling coatings based on organotin compounds since early 2008 (Qian et al. 2010; Faӱ et al. 2007; Kitano et al. 2011). Biocide-based antifouling paints including Irgarol 1051, chlorothalonil and <b>dichlofluanid</b> were introduced as alternatives to organotins in antifouling products, but have also been found that they accumulate in marine environment and are deleterious to marine organisms (Konstantinou and Albanis 2004). Thus, the demand for environmentally benign, non-toxic or low toxic antifouling agents is urgently required.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Biocides are {{chemical}} substances that can deter or kill the microorganisms responsible for biofouling. The {{rapid expansion of}} the aquaculture industry is having {{a significant impact on}} the marine ecosystems. As the industry expands, it requires the use of more drugs, disinfectants and antifoulant compounds (biocides) to eliminate the microorganisms in the aquaculture facilities. The use of biocides in the aquatic environment, however, has proved to be harmful as it has toxic effects on the marine environment. Organic booster biocides were recently introduced as alternatives to the organotin compounds found in antifouling products after restrictions were imposed on the use of tributyltin (TBT). The replacement products are generally based on copper metal oxides and organic biocides. The biocides that are most commonly used in antifouling paints include chlorothalonil, <b>dichlofluanid,</b> DCOIT (4, 5 -dichloro- 2 -n-octyl- 4 -isothiazolin- 3 -one, Sea-nine 211 ®), Diuron, Irgarol 1051, TCMS pyridine (2, 3, 3, 6 -tetrachloro- 4 -methylsulfonyl pyridine), zinc pyrithione and Zineb. There are two types of risks associated with the use of biocides in aquaculture: (i) predators and humans may ingest the fish and shellfish that have accumulated in these contaminants and (ii) the development of antibiotic resistance in bacteria. This paper provides an overview of the effects of antifouling (AF) biocides on aquatic organisms. It also provides some insights into the effects and risks of these compounds on non-target organisms...|$|E

The inhibition of algal growth {{is an important}} regulatory endpoint for toxicity assessment of single compounds. However, in the aquatic environment, mixtures of compounds with unknown toxicities and mode of action (MoA) co-exist, making single toxicity assessment inadequate to ensure protection of the aquatic environment. This study aimed to characterize the combined toxicity of five environmentally relevant biocides—aclonifen, bifenox, <b>dichlofluanid,</b> metribuzin, and triclosan—with different MoA on growth and photosystem (PS) II efficiency of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. For growth inhibition, herbicides bifenox and metribuzin were the most toxic, whereas triclosan was least. Only aclonifen and metribuzin exerted {{a significant effect on}} PSII, which was also correlated with reduced algal growth. The combined effect of the five biocides on growth inhibition was predominantly additive and presumed to act by independent MoA with potential antagonism observed only at low concentrations and at shorter duration of exposure. The binary mixture of metribuzin and aclonifen exhibited additive effects on diminished PSII efficiency, and effects were apparently induced by an independent MoA. Potential synergy of this mixture on growth inhibition was identified at the highest concentrations. Growth inhibition was found to be a more valuable endpoint for regulatory studies than PSII inhibition due to its environmental relevance, integration of multiple MoA and sensitivity...|$|E

At present, these paints are widespread on the market for preserving boat hulls and various structures submerged in aquatic environments, and contain Cu 2 O, CuO, CuSCN, Sea-Nine 211, Irgarol 1051, Diuron, Chlorothalonil, <b>Dichlofluanid,</b> Zinc pyrithione, Zineb and Endosulfan as principal or booster biocides. Experiments were carried out on wood and steel panels immersed for one year in two stations of the southern basin of the Lagoon of Venice, differing in bathymetric, hydrodynamic and turbidity characteristics. The growth and development of biocoenoses on panels coated with antifouling paints were analysed monthly and compared with both control and TBT-treated panels. Some biodiversity indexes – species rich-ness, biocoenosis structure, covering-abundance index, and similarity index – were used to describe the evolution of the biocoenosis and compare the disturbing effects resulting in the selection of resistant species, often {{different from those of the}} natural relative climax. Results indicate that none of the assayed paints is more powerful than TBT-containing paints and the effects on the biocoenosis are potentiated by the type of matrix and presence of booster compounds, following the order of biocidal efficacy of paints containing TBT > organozinc > copper > Sea-Nine...|$|E
40|$|A {{case study}} on the {{behavioral}} responses of ambrosia beetles to some pesticidal formulations was carried out at a logging area in West Kalimantan in 1981. Each pesticide formulation was sprayed to debarked logs of fresh 1 % felled ramin trees (Gonystylus bancanus Kurz. }. The tested logs were, then, allowed for the beetle infestations for four weeks, and inspections were conducted weekly to count the beetle tunnels. A lower intensity of the beetle infestation on the treated logs than those on the controls was considered as an inhibitory response. in contrast, a higher intensity of the infestation on the treated logs was indicatively caused by a stimulatory response. These following conclusions are drawn from this study: 1. A highly inhibitory response on the ambrosia beetle attacks was shown by treatments with pesticide containing 50 % cypermethrin or 50 % fenithrotion. 2. Ramin logs treated with pesticide containing either 30 % TCMTB or a mixture of 90 % thiourea + 10 % quarternary ammonium + 0. 1 % diazenium dioxy seemed to be highly stimulating to the beetles. The stimulating effect of the second formulation initially decreased and lost afterwards if the diazenium dioxy component was increased by 0. 1 to 0. 2 %. A doubtful record was shown if the TCMTB was mixed with 2 % borax. 3. The pesticide containing 5 % Cu- 8 -oxyquinolinolate and 80 % <b>dichlofluanid</b> were also unaffected to the beetle response...|$|E

Some isolates had a low resistance to both fungicides (spore germination and mycelial growth occurred on medium containing 3 mu g iprodione ml(- 1) or 1 mu g carbendazim ml(- 1)). These isolates were insensitive to phenylcarbamates (spore germination and mycelial growth on 100 mu g diethofencarb ml(- 1)). Many isolates had a high resistance to benzimidazoles (spore germination and mycelial growth on medium containing 100 mu g carbendazim ml(- 1)); these isolates showed negative cross-resistance to phenylcarbamates (spore germination and mycelial growth inhibited on 1 mu g diethofencarb ml(- 1)). Some isolates exhibited reduced sensitivity to <b>dichlofluanid</b> (spore germination on medium containing 1 mu g fungicide ml(- 1)). Infections caused by isolates resistant to dicarboximides or to both dicarboximides and benzimidazoles were uncommon at the beginning of each new crop cycle. However, both disease incidence and frequencies of infection by such isolates increased substantially as the season progressed and then declined after cessation of fungicide sprays. In contrast, infections caused by isolates that showed high resistance to benzimidazoles but were sensitive to dicarboximides were frequent throughout the growing season. There were no infections caused by strains resistant to both benzimidazoles and phenylcarbamates at sites treated with carbendazim plus diethofencarb. The reduced efficacy of this mixture could be due to its inferior activity in vitro against isolates exhibiting high resistance to benzimidazoles and negatively correlated cross-resistance to diethofencarb.

40|$|Directive 2013 / 39 /EU {{amending}} the Environmental Quality Standards Directive 2008 / 105 /EC under the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) has introduced the new “Watch List” monitoring mechanism {{in order to}} collect high-quality Union-wide monitoring data {{for the purpose of}} supporting future prioritisation exercises. Diclofenac, 17 -beta-estradiol, and 17 -alpha-ethinylestradiol were identified in Directive 2013 / 39 /EU for inclusion in the 1 st Watch List. The Joint Research Centre (JRC) has been tasked with proposing seven substances as candidates for the completion of the 1 st Watch List and identifying analytical methods for their monitoring. The procedure and criteria used to identify a short-list of substances for possible inclusion in the Watch List is described in the JRC Science and Policy Report “Development of the 1 st Watch List under the Environmental Quality Standards Directive" (Carvalho et al., 2015). EU Member States and stakeholder groups had the opportunity to comment on the proposed substances and on the analytical methods, whose availability was a criterion for the selection of the compounds. The finally proposed 10 (groups of) substances for inclusion in the 1 st Watch List are diclofenac, 17 -beta-estradiol (E 2) and estrone (E 1), 17 -alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE 2), oxadiazon, methiocarb, 2, 6 -ditert-butyl- 4 -methylphenol, tri-allate, neonicotinoid insecticides as a group (imidacloprid, thiacloprid, thiamethoxam, clothianidin, acetamiprid), macrolide antibiotics (erythromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin), and 2 -ethylhexyl- 4 -methoxycinnamate. Analytical methods for additional substances were searched and investigated because they were among those considered for inclusion in the list, but either did not fulfil all selection criteria, in some cases because enough monitoring data were found to exist already, or were not ranked highly enough. These substances were trichlorfon, cyclododecane, aminotriazole (amitrole), dimethenamid-P, diflufenican, <b>dichlofluanid,</b> formaldehyde, triphenyl phosphate, tolylfluanid, ciprofloxacin, and free cyanide. Little or no information on analytical methods was found for trichlorfon, aminotriazole, cyclododecane, and tolylfluanid. For the other compounds analytical methods are available and published. Some of them have already been analysed in the aquatic environment. The analysis of free cyanide in water is difficult. The available analytical methods do not reach the proposed PNEC value of 0. 26 µg/l. JRC. H. 1 -Water Resource...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} the {{development}} of macrofouling biocoenoses is of particular interest because it might represent an instrument for the evaluation of the biodiversity. In the lagoon of Venice, these studies acquire a critic relevance owing to they allow to reveal, in the long term, quality and quantity changes of the fouling community attributable to environmental differences and improve the comprehension of the existing interactions between the organisms of the fouling and some physical-chemical factors of seawater and/or xenobiotics. We carried out an analysis of the temporal sequence of the macrofouling biocoenosis of hard substrates in the southern basin of the lagoon of Venice on steel and wood panels, with the aim of developing an environmental quality index (bioindex) which was cheap, easy to calculate, sensitive to many environmental conditions and considering the relationships between the biotic data and change of highly significant chemical-physical parameters as regards the lagoon environment. It is specific for the community of hard substrates, and represented by the following algorithm: Log 10 (R • A • IpH • IT • IS) where R = species richness, i. e., number of species by month present onto all panels of the same type; A = area extension for each species by months (cm 2); IpH = pH quality index; IT = temperature quality index; IS = salinity quality index. The development of a quality index in logarithmic scale, from 1 to 10 inclusive, allows to really evaluate the state of health of the lagoon environment assigning to it a numerical value. Moreover, we investigated the disturbing action on “Botryllus biocoenosis”, a benthic association of various ascidians where the colonial species are dominant, by eight antifouling paints of new generation containing Cu 2 O, CuO, CuSCN, Sea-Nine 211, Irgarol 1051, Diuron, Chlorothalonil, <b>Dichlofluanid,</b> Zinc pyrithione, Zineb and Endosulfan as principal or booster biocides. Experiments were carried out on wood and steel panels immersed for one year in two stations of the southern basin, differing in bathymetric, hydrodynamic and turbidity characteristics. The growth and development of biocoenoses were analysed monthly and compared with both control and TBT-treated panels.
