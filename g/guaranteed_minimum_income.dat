25|$|A <b>guaranteed</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>income</b> {{is another}} {{proposed}} system {{of social welfare}} provision. It {{is similar to a}} basic income or negative income tax system, except that it is normally conditional and subject to a means test. Some proposals also stipulate a willingness to participate in the labor market, or a willingness to perform community services.|$|E
25|$|These criticisms {{are also}} voiced by non-libertarian transhumanist advocates, {{especially}} self-described democratic transhumanists, {{who believe that}} the majority of current or future social and environmental issues (such as unemployment and resource depletion) need to be addressed by a combination of political and technological solutions (like a <b>guaranteed</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>income</b> and alternative technology). Therefore, on the specific issue of an emerging genetic divide due to unequal access to human enhancement technologies, bioethicist James Hughes, in his 2004 book , argues that progressives or, more precisely, techno-progressives must articulate and implement public policies (i.e., a universal health care voucher system that covers human enhancement technologies) in order to attenuate this problem as much as possible, rather than trying to ban human enhancement technologies. The latter, he argues, might actually worsen the problem by making these technologies unsafe or available only to the wealthy on the local black market or in countries where such a ban is not enforced.|$|E

[...] Future President James Monroe used his diplomatic connections to get Paine released in November 1794. He became notorious because of his pamphlets The Age of Reason, in which he advocated deism, promoted reason and free thought, and argued against institutionalized religion in general and Christian doctrine in particular. He also published the pamphlet Agrarian Justice (1797), discussing the origins of property, and introduced the concept of a <b>guaranteed</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>income.</b> In 1802, he returned to the U.S. where he died on June 8, 1809.

The GMI is viewed as a right to the Portuguese people, and proves independent of market influences. The GMI program aims at providing the low-income earners who are above 18 years social and economic autonomy to encourage them to participate in the economic growth of the country. In 2001 reports show that 32 percent of those that were previously approved to benefit from the GMI have been discontinued after attaining an income above the minimum threshold. This report shows GMI policy measures as effective in eradicating poverty and increasing income equality in Portugal ...|$|E

2500|$|Clark was {{the first}} Canadian {{politician}} to take a strong stand for decriminalization of marijuana in Canada, and for a <b>guaranteed</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>income</b> for everyone; both positions were characteristic of the Red Tories. In many ways his social liberalism was as bold in the 1970s as Trudeau's was in the 1960s. These positions put Clark {{at odds with the}} right-wing members of his caucus, several members of which were not afraid to confront him. For example, in the lead-up to the 1979 election, the bulk of Clark's riding was merged into the newly created riding of Bow River during a redistribution of ridings. [...] Fellow Tory MP Stanley Schumacher had much of his old riding of Palliser merged into Bow River as well.

2500|$|McGovern's {{platform}} {{also included}} an across-the-board, 37% reduction {{in defense spending}} over three years; and a [...] "demogrant" [...] program that would replace the personal income tax exemption with a $1,000 tax credit as a minimum-income floor for every citizen in America, to replace the welfare bureaucracy and complicated maze of existing public-assistance programs. Its concept {{was similar to the}} negative income tax long advocated by economist Milton Friedman, and by the Nixon administration in the form of Daniel Patrick Moynihan's Family Assistance Program, which called for a minimum family grant of $1,600 per year, later raised to $2,400. The personal income tax exemption later became $1,000 under President Reagan. (As Senator, McGovern had previously sponsored a bill, submitted by the National Welfare Rights Organization, for $6,500 <b>guaranteed</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>income</b> per year to families, based on need.) In addition, McGovern supported ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment.|$|E
2500|$|A <b>guaranteed</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>income</b> {{ensures that}} every citizen {{will be able}} to {{purchase}} a desired level of basic needs. A basic income (or negative income tax) is a system of social security, that periodically provides each citizen, rich or poor, with a sum of money that is sufficient to live on. Studies of large cash-transfer programs in Ethiopia, Kenya, and Malawi show that the programs can be effective in increasing consumption, schooling, and nutrition, whether they are tied to such conditions or not. Proponents argue that a basic income is more economically efficient than a minimum wage and unemployment benefits, as the minimum wage effectively imposes a high marginal tax on employers, causing losses in efficiency. In 1968, Paul Samuelson, John Kenneth Galbraith and another 1,200 economists signed a document calling for the US Congress to introduce a system of income guarantees. Winners of the Nobel Prize in Economics, with often diverse political convictions, who support a basic income include Herbert A. Simon, Friedrich Hayek, Robert Solow, Milton Friedman, Jan Tinbergen, James Tobin ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to analyze three <b>minimum</b> <b>income</b> programs, {{transformed}} into law on the federal level. The first, created during the Fernando Henrique Cardoso Administration, offers financial support to municipalities by creating programs to <b>guarantee</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>income</b> associated to social-educational activities. The second program is the Family Grant program instituted during the Lula government. The third program, drafted by Senator Eduardo Suplicy, institutes a basic citizens' income. The analysis is inserted in a broader debate related to defense of unconditional income, as a form of overcoming the social welfare state. The central argument is that Brazil, even during the Lula government, has emphasized focused policies at the cost of universal ones...|$|R
2500|$|McGovern ran on a {{platform}} of ending the Vietnam War and instituting <b>guaranteed</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>incomes</b> for the nation's poor. [...] The Vietnam issue, which remained the one McGovern was most passionate about, did not work for him overall; a majority of the electorate thought that Nixon was a strong leader who would secure [...] "peace with honor". [...] McGovern, in contrast, was seen as too strident and too tied to radical elements of the anti-war movement. [...] By 1972, Nixon's strategy of Vietnamization had resulted in the withdrawal of most U.S. troops, without appearing to have given in to the Communists, and thus popular dissatisfaction with the war did not accrue to McGovern's benefit.|$|R

25|$|McGovern ran on a {{platform}} of immediately ending the Vietnam War and instituting <b>guaranteed</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>incomes</b> for the nation’s poor. His campaign was harmed by his views during the primaries (which alienated many powerful Democrats), the perception that his foreign policy was too extreme, and the Eagleton debacle. With McGovern’s campaign weakened by these factors, the Republicans successfully portrayed him as a radical left-wing extremist incompetent to serve as president. Nixon led in the polls by large margins throughout the entire campaign. With an enormous fundraising advantage and a comfortable lead in the polls, Nixon concentrated on large rallies and focused speeches to closed, select audiences, leaving much of the retail campaigning to surrogates like Vice President Agnew. Nixon did not, by design, try to extend his coattails to Republican congressional or gubernatorial candidates, preferring to pad his own margin of victory.|$|R
50|$|<b>Guaranteed</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>income</b> (GMI), {{also called}} minimum income, {{is a system}} of social welfare {{provision}} that guarantees that all citizens or families have an income sufficient to live on, provided they meet certain conditions. Eligibility is typically determined by citizenship, a means test, and either availability for the labour market or a willingness to perform community services. The primary goal of a <b>guaranteed</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>income</b> is to reduce poverty. If citizenship is the only requirement, the system turns into a universal basic income.|$|E

40|$|Most Romanians {{believe that}} the state should assume more {{responsibility}} {{for the welfare of}} everyone. Social protection must actually be understood in the broader framework of gradual and more alert transfer of the responsibility from the individual to the state level. If {{in the case of a}} minimal state the individuals would be forced to save to cope with unforeseen situations like job loss, disability or illness, in the case of a welfare state, which <b>guarantees</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>incomes,</b> these reasons fade. Individuals have increasing expectations from the authorities, and largely decline their capabilities of helping others through charity or philanthropy. In the light of the lack of confidence in the strength of private actions to support those in need, public solutions are expected to eliminate poverty through social protection programs.
