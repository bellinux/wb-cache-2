25|$|The {{design of}} the {{electrodes}} is the key part: These are rod-like structures usually made of glass, with a bulb containing the sensor at the bottom. The glass electrode for measuring the pH has a glass bulb specifically designed to be selective to hydrogen-ion concentration. On immersion in the solution to be tested, hydrogen ions in the test solution exchange for other positively charged ions on the glass bulb, creating an <b>electrochemical</b> <b>potential</b> across the bulb. The electronic amplifier detects the difference in electrical potential between the two electrodes generated in the measurement and converts the potential difference to pH units. The magnitude of the <b>electrochemical</b> <b>potential</b> across the glass bulb is linearly related to the pH according to the Nernst equation.|$|E
25|$|The Fermi energy {{can only}} be defined for non-interacting fermions (where the {{potential}} energy or band edge is a static, well defined quantity), whereas the Fermi level (the <b>electrochemical</b> <b>potential</b> of an electron) remains well defined even in complex interacting systems, at thermodynamic equilibrium.|$|E

25|$|In {{secondary}} active transport, {{also known}} as coupled transport or co-transport, energy is used to transport molecules across a membrane; however, in contrast to primary active transport, {{there is no direct}} coupling of ATP; instead it relies upon the <b>electrochemical</b> <b>potential</b> difference created by pumping ions in/out of the cell. Permitting one ion or molecule to move down an electrochemical gradient, but possibly against the concentration gradient where it is more concentrated to that where it is less concentrated increases entropy and can serve as a source of energy for metabolism (e.g. in ATP synthase).|$|E
25|$|Plasmonic {{nanostructures}} with conductive polymers {{have also}} been suggested as one kind of electronic paper. The material has two parts. The first part is a highly reflective metasurface made by metal-insulator-metal films tens of nanometers in thickness including nanoscale holes. The metasurfaces can reflect different colors depending on {{the thickness of the}} insulator. The three primary colors red, green and blue can be used as pixels for full color displays. The second part is a polymer with optical absorption controllable by an <b>electrochemical</b> <b>potential.</b> After growing the polymer on the plasmonic metasurfaces, the reflection of the metasurfaces can be modulated by the applied voltage. This technology presents broad range colors, high polarization-independent reflection (>50 %), strong contrast (>30 %), fast response time (hundreds of ms), and long-term stability. In addition, it has ultralow power consumption (< 0.5nbsp&mW/cm2) and potential for high resolution (>10000 dpi). Since the ultrathin metasurfaces are flexible and the polymer is soft, the whole system can be bent.Desired future improvements for this technology include bistability, cheaper materials and implementation with TFT arrays.|$|E

40|$|Due {{to their}} high {{corrosion}} stability {{in combination with}} advantageous tribological performance, sintered silicon carbide ceramics are widely used in industrial applications. Both the corrosion stability and the tribological behavior can be affected by electrochemical processes. Tribological investigations were carried out using an electrochemical three electrode setup. The influence of <b>electrochemical</b> <b>potentials</b> on the friction and wear behavior of different sintered SiC materials in 1 M NaCl-solution was investigated to analyze the complex interplay between mechanical, chemical, and electrochemical interactions during tribo-corrosion.

40|$|<b>Electrochemical</b> <b>potentials</b> were {{measured}} {{as a function}} of myofilament packing density in crayfish striated muscle. The A-band striations are supramolecular smectic B 1 lattice assemblies of myosin filaments and the I-band striations are nematic liquid crystals of actin filaments. Both A- and I-bands generate potentials derived from the fixed charge that is associated with structural proteins. In the reported experiments, filament packing density was varied by osmotically reducing lattice volume. The <b>electrochemical</b> <b>potentials</b> {{were measured}} from the A- and I-bands in the relaxed condition over a range of lattice volumes. From the measurements of relative cross-sectional area, unit-cell volume (obtained by low-angle x-ray diffraction) and previously determined effective linear charge densities (Aldoroty, R. A., N. B. Garty, and E. W. April, 1985, Biophys. J., 47 : 89 - 96), Donnan potentials can be predicted for any amount of compression. In the relaxed condition, the predicted Donnan potentials correspond to the measured <b>electrochemical</b> <b>potentials.</b> In the rigor condition, however, a net increase in negative charge associated with the myosin filament is observed. The predictability of the data demonstrates the applicability of Donnan equilibrium theory to the measurement of <b>electrochemical</b> <b>potentials</b> from liquid-crystalline systems.

H+ was translocated by the Paracoccus denitrificans complex I, but in this case, H+ transport was not influenced by Na+, and Na+ transport was not observed. Possibly, the E. coli complex I has two energy coupling sites (one Na+ independent and the other Na+dependent), as observed for the Rhodothermus marinus complex I, whereas the coupling mechanism of the P. denitrificans enzyme is completely Na+ independent. It is also possible that another transporter catalyzes the uptake of Na+. [...] Complex I energy transduction by proton pumping may not be exclusive to the R. marinus enzyme.
