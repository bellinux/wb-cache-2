40|$|Vegetative <b>incompatibility</b> is a {{programmed}} {{cell death}} reaction that occurs when fungal cells of unlike genotypes fuse. Genes defining vegetative <b>incompatibility</b> (het genes) are highly polymorphic, and {{most if not all}} <b>incompatibility</b> systems include a protein partner bearing the fungus-specific domain termed the HET domain. The nonallelic het-C/het-E <b>incompatibility</b> system is the best-characterized <b>incompatibility</b> system in Podospora anserina. Cell death is triggered by interaction of specific alleles of het-C, encoding a glycolipid transfer protein, and het-E, encoding a HET domain and a WD repeat domain involved in recognition. We show here that overexpression of the isolated HET domain from het-E results in cell death. This cell death is characterized by induction of autophagy, increased vacuolization, septation, and production of lipid droplets, which are hallmarks of cell death by <b>incompatibility.</b> In addition, the HET domain lethality is suppressed by the same mutations as vegetative <b>incompatibility,</b> but not by the inactivation of het-C. These results establish the HET domain as the mediator of cell death by <b>incompatibility</b> and lead to a modular conception of <b>incompatibility</b> systems whereby recognition is ensured by the variable regions of <b>incompatibility</b> proteins and cell death is triggered by the HET domain...|$|R
40|$|The <b>incompatibility</b> {{properties}} of IncFII R plasmid NR 1 {{were compared with}} those of two of its copy number mutants, pRR 12 and pRR 21. pRR 12 produced an altered <b>incompatibility</b> product and also had an altered <b>incompatibility</b> target site. The target site appeared to be located within the <b>incompatibility</b> gene, which is located more than 1, 200 base pairs from the plasmid origin of replication. The <b>incompatibility</b> {{properties of}} pRR 21 were indistinguishable from those of NR 1. Lambda phages have been constructed which contain the <b>incompatibility</b> region of NR 1 or of one of its copy mutants fused to the lacZ gene. In lysogens constructed with these phages, beta-galactosidase was produced under the control of a promoter located within the plasmid <b>incompatibility</b> region. Lysogens containing prophages with the <b>incompatibility</b> regions from pRR 12 and pRR 21 produced higher levels of beta-galactosidase than did lysogens containing prophages with the <b>incompatibility</b> region from the wild-type NR 1. The introduction into these inc-lac lysogens of pBR 322 plasmids carrying the <b>incompatibility</b> regions of the wild-type or mutant plasmids resulted in decreased levels of beta-galactosidase production. For a given lysogen, the decrease was greater when the pBR 322 derivative expressed a stronger <b>incompatibility</b> toward the plasmid from which the fragment in the prophage was derived. This suggested that the <b>incompatibility</b> product acts on its target to repress gene expression in the plasmid replication region...|$|R

40|$|Disruption of {{interactions}} among ensembles of epistatic loci {{has been shown}} to contribute to reproductive isolation among various animal and plant species. Under the Bateson–Dobzhansky–Muller model, such interspecific <b>incompatibility</b> arises as a by-product of genetic divergence in each species, and the Orr–Turelli model indicates that the number of loci involved in incompatible interactions may “snowball” over time. We address the combined effect of multiple <b>incompatibility</b> loci on the rate of introgression at neutral marker loci across the genome. Our analysis extends previous work by accommodating sex specificity: differences between the sexes in the expression of <b>incompatibility,</b> in rates of crossing over between neutral markers and <b>incompatibility</b> loci, and in transmission of markers or <b>incompatibility</b> factors. We show that the evolutionary process at neutral markers in a genome subject to <b>incompatibility</b> selection is well approximated by a purely neutral process with migration rates appropriately scaled to reflect the influence of selection targeted to <b>incompatibility</b> factors. We confirm that in the absence of sex specificity and functional epistasis among <b>incompatibility</b> factors, the barrier to introgression induced by multiple <b>incompatibility</b> factors corresponds to the product of the barriers induced by the factors individually. A new finding is that barriers to introgression due to sex-specific <b>incompatibility</b> depart in general from multiplicativity. Our partitioning of variation in relative reproductive rate suggests that such departures derive from associations between sex and <b>incompatibility</b> and between sex and neutral markers. Concordant sex-specific <b>incompatibility</b> (for example, greater impairment of male hybrids or longer map lengths in females) induces lower barriers (higher rates of introgression) than expected under multiplicativity, and discordant sex-specific <b>incompatibility</b> induces higher barriers...|$|R

However, as the lines were expanded and passenger numbers increased, more rolling stock was needed, which made the network less uniform, particularly with regards to the problematic Line B, which used a different electrification system and measurements to the other lines.

40|$|Vegetative <b>incompatibility</b> is {{widespread}} in fungi but its molecular mechanism and biological function are still poorly understood. A way to study vegetative <b>incompatibility</b> is {{to investigate the}} function of genes whose mutations suppress this phenomenon. In Podospora anserina, these genes are known as mod genes. In addition to suppressing vegetative <b>incompatibility,</b> mod mutations cause some developmental defects. This suggests that the molecular mechanisms of vegetative <b>incompatibility</b> and development pathways are interconnected. The mod-E 1 mutation was isolated as a suppressor of the developmental defects of the mod-D 2 strain. We show here that mod-E 1 also partially suppresses vegetative <b>incompatibility,</b> strengthening the link between development and vegetative <b>incompatibility.</b> mod-E 1 is the first suppressor of vegetative <b>incompatibility</b> characterized at the molecular level.

40|$|International audienceIn fungi, {{heterokaryon}} <b>incompatibility</b> is a nonself recognition process occurring when filaments {{of different}} isolates {{of the same}} species fuse. Compatibility is controlled by so-called het loci and fusion of strains of unlike het genotype triggers a complex <b>incompatibility</b> reaction that leads to the death of the fusion cell. Herein, we analyze the transcriptional changes during the <b>incompatibility</b> reaction in Podospora anserina. The <b>incompatibility</b> response was found to be associated with a massive transcriptional reprogramming: 2231 genes were up-regulated by a factor 2 or more during <b>incompatibility.</b> In turn, 2441 genes were down-regulated. HET, NACHT, and HeLo domains previously found {{to be involved in the}} control of heterokaryon <b>incompatibility</b> were enriched in the up-regulated gene set. In addition, <b>incompatibility</b> was characterized by an up-regulation of proteolytic and other hydrolytic activities, of secondary metabolism clusters and toxins and effector-like proteins. The up-regulated set was found to be enriched for proteins lacking orthologs in other species and chromosomal distribution of the up-regulated genes was uneven with up-regulated genes residing preferentially in genomic islands and on chromosomes IV and V. There was a significant overlap between regulated genes during <b>incompatibility</b> in P. anserina and Neurospora crassa, indicating similarities in the <b>incompatibility</b> responses in these two species.
