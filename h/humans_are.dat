5|$|In {{biological}} classification <b>humans</b> <b>are</b> animals, a basic point {{which has been}} known for more than 2,000 years. The creationist J. Rendle-Short asserted in Creation magazine that if people are taught evolution they can be expected to behave like animals: since animals behave in all sorts of different ways, this is meaningless. In evolutionary terms, <b>humans</b> <b>are</b> able to acquire knowledge and change their behaviour to meet social standards, so humans behave in the manner of other humans.|$|E

50|$|The largest {{obstacle}} {{in the way}} {{of their}} mission is the Hinata Family, who must take care of the Keroro Platoon due to the Keron Army deserting the latter on Earth. Keroro is kept busy with manual labor and constant abuse, primarily from the family daughter, Natsumi. Each member of the platoon finds himself in the care of a human: Giroro's <b>human</b> <b>is</b> Natsumi Hinata, whom he falls in love with; Keroro's <b>human</b> <b>is</b> Fuyuki Hinata, who considers the Sergeant his only true friend; Kululu's <b>human</b> <b>is</b> Mutsumi Saburo, who discovered him; Dororo's <b>human</b> <b>is</b> Koyuki, a fellow ninja; and Tamama's <b>human</b> <b>is</b> his equal in bipolar insanity, Momoka Nishizawa.

5|$|Although <b>humans</b> <b>are</b> {{the only}} known natural hosts of poliovirus, monkeys can be {{experimentally}} infected and they have long been used to study poliovirus. In 1990–91, a small animal model of poliomyelitis was developed by two laboratories. Mice were engineered to express a human receptor to poliovirus (hPVR).|$|E
5|$|Although {{reports of}} {{poisoning}} in <b>humans</b> <b>are</b> rare, ingestion of ferric chloride {{can result in}} serious morbidity and mortality. Inappropriate labeling and storage lead to accidental swallowing or misdiagnosis. Early diagnosis is important, especially in seriously poisoned patients.|$|E

5|$|Benzodiazepines share {{a similar}} {{chemical}} structure, {{and their effects}} in <b>humans</b> <b>are</b> mainly produced by the allosteric modification of a specific kind of neurotransmitter receptor, the GABAA receptor, which increases the overall conductance of these inhibitory channels; this results in the various therapeutic effects as well as adverse effects of benzodiazepines. Other less important mechanisms of action are also known.|$|E
5|$|Immersion {{in water}} and {{exposure}} to high ambient pressure have physiological effects that limit the depths and duration possible in ambient pressure diving. <b>Humans</b> <b>are</b> not physiologically and anatomically well adapted to the environmental conditions of diving, and various equipment has been developed to extend the depth and duration of human dives, and allow different types {{of work to be}} done.|$|E

25|$|Examples of poor {{definition}} are {{the statements}} a <b>human</b> <b>is</b> an animal, {{combined with the}} statement that apes and reptiles are animals. If those statements are reversed, then animal <b>is</b> <b>human,</b> and so it is that the syllogism apes and reptiles <b>are</b> <b>human</b> results in a logical fallacy. A further example: if a <b>human</b> <b>is</b> a two-eyed animal, then a syllogism can result in the fallacy a buffalo <b>is</b> also <b>human.</b>|$|R

The dog conch is also preyed upon by vertebrates.

5|$|Mitochondria {{have their}} own genetic material, and the {{machinery}} to manufacture their own RNAs and proteins (see: protein biosynthesis). A published human mitochondrial DNA sequence revealed 16,569base pairs encoding 37 genes: 22tRNA, 2 rRNA, and 13peptide genes.

5|$|The {{scientific}} {{name of an}} organism is generated from its genus and species. For example, <b>humans</b> <b>are</b> listed as Homo sapiens. Homo is the genus, and sapiens the species.
