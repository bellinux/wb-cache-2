40|$|Trypanosomosis is a {{major cause}} of {{mortality}} for dogs in Nigeria and treatment with <b>diminazene</b> aceturate has steadily become less effective, either as a result of low quality of the locally available <b>diminazene</b> preparations or of drug resistance. To investigate these alternatives, samples of locally obtained drugs were analysed for <b>diminazene</b> aceturate content and a strain of Trypanosoma brucei brucei was isolated from a diminazene-refractory dog in Nsukka, south-eastern Nigeria, and used to infect albino rats. The quality of <b>diminazene</b> aceturate-based preparations was variable, with two preparations containing less than 95 % of the stated active compound. Rats infected with T. brucei isolated from the dog were treated 7 and 10 days after infection either with 7 mg/kg <b>diminazene</b> aceturate (intraperitoneally, once) or with 4 mg/kg pentamidine isethionate (intramuscularly, 7 consecutive days). Relapse rates were 100 % for both trypanocides in the groups of rat treated 10 days post-infection, and 83 % and 50 % of rats treated 7 days after infection relapsed to <b>diminazene</b> aceturate and pentamidine isethionate, respectively. Careful consideration of physiological parameters showed that pentamidine was only marginally superior to <b>diminazene</b> aceturate as applied in this study. It was concluded that dogs in Nigeria are infected with genuinely <b>diminazene</b> aceturate-resistant trypanosomes that appear to be cross-resistant to pentamidine isethionate...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of <b>diminazene</b> aceturate following intramuscular (i. m.) {{administration at}} 4. 2 mg/kg was evaluated in 8 healthy German Shepherd dogs. Blood {{samples were collected}} at 19 intervals {{over a period of}} 21 days. <b>Diminazene</b> plasma concentrations were measured using a validated HPLC method with UV detection and a sensitivity of 25 ng/m. The in vitro and in vivo binding of <b>diminazene</b> to blood elements was additionally determined. <b>Diminazene</b> pharmacokinetics showed a large inter-individual variation after i. m. administration. It had a short absorption half-life (K 01 -HL of 0. 11 + 0. 18 h), resulting in a Cmax of 1849 + 268. 7 ng/mℓ at Tmax of 0. 37 h and a mean overall elimination half-life (T 1 / 2 ÃŸ) of 5. 31 + 3. 89 h. A terminal half-life of 27. 5 + 25. 0 h was measured. At 1 h after i. m. injection, 75 % of the <b>diminazene</b> in whole blood was in the plasma fraction. The results {{of this study indicate that}} <b>diminazene</b> is rapidly distributed and sequestered into the liver, followed by a slower terminal phase during which <b>diminazene</b> is both redistributed to the peripheral tissues and/or renally excreted. It is recommended that <b>diminazene</b> administered i. m. at 4. 2 mg/kg should not be repeated within a 21 -day period...|$|E
40|$|African trypanosomiasis is {{a disease}} of humans and {{livestock}} in many areas south of the Sahara. Resistance to the few existing drugs is a major impediment to the control of these diseases, and we investigated how resistance to the main veterinary drug <b>diminazene</b> aceturate correlates with changes in drug transport in resistant strains. The strain tbat 1 (-/-), lacking the TbAT 1 /P 2 aminopurine transporter implicated previously in <b>diminazene</b> transport, was adapted {{to higher levels of}} <b>diminazene</b> resistance. The resulting cell line was designated ABR and was highly cross-resistant to other diamidines and moderately resistant to cymelarsan. Procyclic trypanosomes were shown to be a convenient model to study diamidine uptake in Trypanosoma brucei brucei given the lack of TbAT 1 /P 2 and a 10 -fold higher activity of the high-affinity pentamidine transporter (HAPT 1). <b>Diminazene</b> could be transported by HAPT 1 in procyclic trypanosomes. This drug transport activity was lacking in the ABR line, as reported previously for the pentamidine-adapted line B 48. The K(m) for <b>diminazene</b> transport in bloodstream tbat 1 (-/-) trypanosomes was consistent with uptake by HAPT 1. <b>Diminazene</b> transport in ABR and B 48 cells was reduced compared with tbat 1 (-/-), but their resistance phenotype was different: B 48 displayed higher levels of resistance to pentamidine and the melaminophenyl arsenicals, whereas ABR displayed higher resistance to <b>diminazene.</b> These results establish a loss of HAPT 1 function as a contributing factor to <b>diminazene</b> resistance but equally demonstrate {{for the first time that}} adaptations other than those determining the initial rates of drug uptake contribute to diamidine and arsenical resistance in African trypanosome...|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the influence of}} dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) daily supplementation on <b>diminazene</b> treatment of trypanosomosis. Four groups of Trypanosoma brucei brucei infected rats received 7. 0 mg/kg <b>diminazene</b> aceturate on day 7 post infection. Three of the four groups received different doses of DMSO (0. 5, 1. 0 and 2. 0 g/kg, respectively) in addition to <b>diminazene</b> treatment. The changes in hematological parameters and the weights of liver, spleen and heart caused by T. brucei infection were monitored and {{used to assess the}} efficacy of treatment. The prepatent period of infection was four days. Infection caused significant increases in WBC count, spleen and liver weights but it caused decreases in PCV, HB and RBC by day 7 post infection (PI 7). By PI 14, spleen weight and WBC counts were reduced from the PI 7 level without treatment. Diminazene/DMSO combination did not reduce liver weight or increased hematological parameters more significantly than <b>diminazene</b> treatment alone. Increase in the dose of DMSO caused increases in liver weight. Diminazene/DMSO combination reduced spleen weight more significantly than <b>diminazene</b> treatment alone. Diminazene/DMSO combination delayed re-emergence of parasites beyond PT 21 at which time parasites were detected in the blood of rats treated only with <b>diminazene.</b> The limited advantages of diminazene/DMSO combination over <b>diminazene</b> alone as well as the possible liver toxicity of DMSO at high doses would not make DMSO supplementation a viable addition to trypanosomosis chemotherapy...|$|E
40|$|The efficacies of <b>diminazene</b> {{aceturate}} {{alone and}} in separate combinations with levamisole and Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO) {{in the treatment}} of T. congolense infection in rats were assessed on day 7 post infection and days 7 and 14 post treatment using changes in the weights and histology of the liver, spleen, heart and brain as well as parasitemia as parameters. Infected rats were treated with 7. 0 mg/kg <b>diminazene</b> aceturate on day 7 post infection following which DMSO (0. 5, 1. 0 and 2. 0 g/kg, respectively) and levamisole (10, 20 and 40 mg/kg, respectively) were administered as daily supplements to different groups of rats. Trypanosoma congolense only caused significant increase in spleen weight. There were no histopathological lesions in any organ. Infection had no effect on heart weight. Liver and spleen weights were lower in the <b>diminazene</b> group by day 7 Post Treatment (PT), but this situation was reversed by day 14 PT. Increase in the dose of DMSO caused increased liver weight. Diminazene/DMSO combination was more effective at 14 days PT in reducing spleen weight than treatment with <b>diminazene</b> alone. On the contrary, diminazene/levamisole combination was less effective than <b>diminazene</b> alone in reducing spleen weight. Parasites disappeared after <b>diminazene</b> treatment but reappeared only in the <b>diminazene</b> and levamisole groups by day 14 PT. Early relapse and high virulence of the Basa strainof T. congolense used may be responsible for the ineffectiveness of the three treatment protocols...|$|E
40|$|<b>Diminazene</b> is {{the therapy}} {{of choice for}} canine {{babesiosis}} in South Africa. Differences in the dosage described for <b>diminazene</b> usage and the occurrence of mortality at doses equal to or close to the recommended treatment dose {{for the treatment of}} canine babesiosis have been described. This has necessitated the need to more fully understand the absorption and disposition of <b>diminazene</b> in dogs. An intravenous (i. v.) as well as an intramuscular (i. m.) pharmacokinetic study was conducted to determine the pharmacokinetics of diminazine in healthy dogs as well as to describe the binding characteristics of diminazine (in the blood) in vivo and in vitro. <b>Diminazene</b> pharmacokinetics showed a large inter-individual variation after i. m. administration at 4. 2 mg/kg (% CV 37 – 163) with a rapid absorption (K 01 -Hl - 6. 6 + 10. 8 min resulting in a Cmax of 1849 + 268. 7 ng/ml at Tmax of 20 min. There was a rapid distribution phase (T½a 21. 6 + 11. 4 min) with the distribution into the peripheral compartment being more rapid than the distribution back in to the central compartment. A mean elimination half-life (T½ b 5. 31 + 3. 89 h) was derived. At 1 h after i. m. injection, 75 % of the <b>diminazene</b> in whole blood was in the plasma fraction. Compartmental analysis of the i. v. data after <b>diminazene</b> administration at 2 mg/kg revealed a Cmax of 3725 + 1672. 8 ng/ml with a rapid distribution phase (T½a 7. 0 + 6. 2 min) with a long elimination half-life (T½ b - 32. 0 ± 28. 8 h). The distribution into the peripheral compartment was more rapid than the distribution back into the central compartment as measured by K 12 and K 21 (K 12 - 8. 78 + 8. 71; K 21 0. 32 + 0. 25). The i. v. pharmacokinetic results were very variable between the dogs with a % CV of 55. 5 – 137. 2. We hypothesize that the rapid distribution phase is a result of <b>diminazene</b> being sequestered into the liver, followed by a slow terminal phase were <b>diminazene</b> is both redistributed to the peripheral tissues and renally excreted. The T½ b of 32. 0 ± 28. 8 h in the i. v. study is considerably longer than the elimination half-life (T½ b - 5. 31 + 3. 89 h) found in the i. m. study. This is most likely due the 25 ng/ml limit of detection of the HPLC, detecting the i. v. tail but not the i. m. tail. This is not surprising as the Cmax levels following i. v administration were more than 2 times higher than after i. m. administration. Further pharmacokinetic studies with <b>diminazene</b> in dogs should take account of the rapid absorption of <b>diminazene</b> after i. m. administration and the low levels of <b>diminazene</b> in the terminal phases. The initial sequestration of <b>diminazene</b> in the liver and distribution to the peripheral compartment needs further clarification. With the knowledge gained of the pharmacokinetics of <b>diminazene</b> in healthy dogs, a population pharmacokinetic study in dogs with babesiosis is recommended. This will allow us to more fully appreciate alterations in the pharmacokinetics of <b>diminazene</b> in diseased populations and the potential covariants exerting an effect. It is our current recommendation that <b>diminazene</b> given i. m. at 4. 2 mg/kg not be repeated within a 21 day period. Dissertation (MMedVet(Med)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2006.

40|$|In this work, {{we used a}} {{preparation}} of <b>diminazene,</b> which belongs {{to the group of}} aromatic diamidines. This compound acts on the causative agents of blood protozoan diseases produced by both flagellated protozoa (Trypanosoma) and members of the class Piroplasmida (Babesia, Theileria, and Cytauxzoon) in various domestic and wild animals, and it is widely used in veterinary medicine. We examined the behavior of water-disperse <b>diminazene</b> (immobilized in Tween 80 micelles) at the cellular and organismal levels. We assessed the interaction of an aqueous and a water-disperse preparation with cells of the reticuloendothelial system. We compared the kinetic parameters of aqueous and water-disperse <b>diminazene</b> in sheep erythrocytes and plasma. The therapeutic properties of these two preparations were also compared. We found that the surface-active substances improved intracellular penetration of the active substance through interaction with the cell membrane.

40|$|The {{bioequivalence}} of the <b>diminazene</b> formulation Veriben (Centaur) {{was determined}} in cattle (n = 10) {{by means of}} a single-dose, randomized cross-over experiment.

Veriben was found to be equivalent to Berenil (Hoechst) with respect to the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve, but not in terms of the maximum plasma drug concentration and the time to maximum plasma drug concentration. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated in which bioequivalence data (n = 10) together with data from an additional four cattle were used. A two-compartment model best described the pharmacokinetic behaviour of <b>diminazene</b> in cattle. Peak concentrations of <b>diminazene</b> (3, 24 ± 0, 16 flg/m) were reached 49, 8 (± 7, 6) min after intramuscular injection of 3, 5 mg/kg drug, with absorption proceeding rapidly (t'lha = 1, 93 ± 0, 95 h). <b>Diminazene</b> was slowly eliminated (t'lhJl = 222 h), resulting in a mean residence time of 13, 27 d.

40|$|One {{third of}} the manufacturer's {{prescribed}} dose of <b>diminazene</b> has long been used to block treat the South African unfrozen Babesia bigemina and Babesia bovis (redwater) vaccine reactions, with no known adverse effects. It is known that the inhibitory effect of antibabesial drugs is more pronounced in animals inoculated with the frozen vaccine than those with the unfrozen vaccine. Reports of vaccine failures in some animals in which <b>diminazene</b> was used for block treatment of the reactions following inoculation with frozen South African redwater vaccine led us to reinvestigate the required waiting period before treatment and the reduced dose necessary for successful treatment and development of immunity.

40|$|Angiotensin (Ang) II {{contributes}} {{to the development of}} atherosclerosis, while Ang-(1 - 7) has atheroprotective actions. Accordingly, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2), which breaks-down Ang II and forms Ang-(1 - 7), has been suggested as a target against atherosclerosis. Here we investigated the actions of <b>diminazene,</b> a recently developed ACE 2 activator compound, in a model of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque. Atherosclerotic plaque formation was induced in the carotid artery of ApoE-deficient mice by a shear stress (SS) modifier device. The animals were treated with <b>diminazene</b> (15 mg/kg/day) or vehicle. ACE 2 was strongly expressed in the aortic root and low SS-induced carotid plaques, but poorly expressed in the oscillatory SS-induced carotid plaques. <b>Diminazene</b> treatment did not change the lesion size, but ameliorated the composition of aortic root and low SS-induced carotid plaques by increasing collagen content and decreasing both MMP- 9 expression and macrophage infiltration. Interestingly, these beneficial effects were not observed in the oscillatory SS-induced plaque. Additionally, <b>diminazene</b> treatment decreased intraplaque ICAM- 1 and VCAM- 1 expression, circulating cytokine and chemokine levels and serum triglycerides. In summary, ACE 2 was distinctively expressed in atherosclerotic plaques, which depends on the local pattern of shear stress.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to compare the}} absorption and distribution of the antitrypanosomal drug <b>diminazene</b> aceturate in plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and lymph of goats. The study comprised three groups of three goats each. Animals in each group were treated with a single intramuscular dose of 3. 5 mg <b>diminazene</b> base/kg body weight. Thereafter, samples of jugular blood were obtained from animals in the first group at 22 different time intervals within the first 48 h of drug administration. Over the same time intervals, samples of lumbar CSF and prescapular lymph were also obtained through cannulae, placed surgically in animals constituting {{the second and third}} groups respectively. Sequentially, <b>diminazene</b> in plasma, CSF and lymph was extracted by an ion-pair technique, and quantified by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The concentration-versus-time data obtained were then analysed by standard non-compartmental procedures. In general, concentrations of <b>diminazene</b> in plasma were 2 - 3 times higher than in lymph and CSF. The observed maximum concentration (Cmax) of <b>diminazene</b> in plasma, 4. 53 +- 0. 41 g/ml, was significantly higher than in the CSF, 0. 96 +- 0. 59 g/ml, lymph, 1. 21 +- 0. 58 g/ml. In addition, the occurrence of Cmax in plasma, at 0. 44 +- 0. 10 h, was earlier compared to 1. 33 +- 0. 58 h in CSF, and 1. 11 +- 0. 77 h in lymph. Total body clearance of <b>diminazene</b> determined for the plasma, 0. 69 +- 0. 11 ml/min/kg, was significantly greater than in the CSF, 0. 23 +- 0. 10 ml/min/kg, and lymph, 0. 13 +- 0. 11 ml/min/kg. Consequently, the mean residence time of the drug determined for the plasma, 57. 27 +- 16. 49 h, was shorter than in the CSF, 892. 72 +- 12. 34 h, and lymph, 2432 +- 3080. 39 h.

The proportion of cattle infections associated with drug-resistant trypanosomes was assessed in the nine villages with the highest trypanosome infection prevalence and one village with a confirmed history of drug-resistant infections. These studies showed that resistance to both isometamidium and <b>diminazene</b> was widespread.

40|$|Resistance to <b>diminazene</b> {{aceturate}} (Berenil) is {{a severe}} {{problem in the}} control of African trypanosomiasis in domestic animals. It has been speculated that resistance {{may be the result}} of reduced <b>diminazene</b> uptake by the parasite. We describe here the mechanisms by which [3 H]diminazene is transported by Trypanosoma brucei brucei bloodstream forms. <b>Diminazene</b> was rapidly accumulated through a single transporter, with a Km of 0. 45 ± 0. 11 μM, which was dose dependently inhibited by pentamidine and adenosine. The Ki values for these inhibitors were consistent with this transporter being the P 2 /TbAT 1 adenosine transporter. Yeast expressing TbAT 1 acquired the ability to take up [3 H]diminazene and [3 H]pentamidine. TbAT 1 -null mutants had lost almost all capacity for [3 H]diminazene transport. However, this cell line still displayed a small but detectable rate of [3 H]diminazene accumulation, in a nonsaturable manner. We conclude that TbAT 1 mediates [3 H]diminazene transport almost exclusively and that this explains the observed <b>diminazene</b> resistance phenotypes of TbAT 1 -null mutants and field isolates...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of <b>diminazene</b> in five female Boran (Bos indicus) cattle {{before and}} then during acute and chronic phases of experimental infections with Trypanosoma congolense were investigated.

There {{were no significant differences between}} the values of pharmacokinetic parameters for the noninfected cattle and the values for cattle with a chronic T. congolense infection. However, the maximum concentration of the drug in plasma during the acute phase of infection (8. 25 +/- 1. 72 micrograms/ml) was significantly (P < 0. 01) greater than that during chronic infection (5. 04 +/- 0. 26 micrograms/ml) and that in the noninfected state (4. 76 +/- 0. 76 micrograms/ml). Similarly, the time to maximum concentration of the drug in plasma when <b>diminazene</b> was administered during the acute phase of infection (18. 00 +/- 6. 71 min) was significantly (P < 0. 02) shorter than that for noninfected cattle (36. 00 +/- 8. 22 min) and that during chronic infection (33. 75 +/- 7. 50 min). The volume of distribution at steady state during acute infection (1. 01 +/- 0. 31 liter/kg) was significantly (P < 0. 01) smaller than that in the noninfected state (1. 37 +/- 0. 17 liter/kg) and that in chronic infection (1. 51 +/- 0. 24 liter/kg). Eight hours after the drug had been administered, the concentration-time data profiles for each of the three study phases were very similar.

Results of the present study indicate that the area under the concentration-time curve for <b>diminazene</b> in trypanosome-infected cattle did not differ significantly for noninfected cattle.

A mobile phase of acetonitrile/ 0, 005 M Na-octane sulphonate, 0, 1 % triethylamine, pH 3, 2 with acetic acid on a Nova Pak C 18 column {{was used for the}} analysis. Wavelength switching was used to determine the internal standard (imidocarb) and <b>diminazene</b> at their respective wavelengths of maximum absorbance, resulting in a fivefold increase in the limit of detection for <b>diminazene.</b> The modified method attained a detection limit of 2 ng/ml (peak 4 x baseline noise), limit of quantitation of 10 ng/ml (coefficient of variation 96 % over the range from 10 - 5000 ng/ml.

40|$|Isometamidium {{chloride}} (Samorin Trypamidium), <b>diminazene</b> aceturate (Berenil, Veriben), homidium chloride (Novidium), {{homidium bromide}} (Ethidium) and the salts of quinapyramine (Trypacide, Triquin) are all anti-trypanosomal compounds that are routinely used in domestic livestock. However, the salts of quinapyramine {{are restricted to}} use in horses and camels. All four compounds {{have been used in}} the field for at least 35 years and the incidence of resistance to each compound appears to be increasing. Furthermore, in some instances, multiple-drug resistance has been Reported and is a particular threat to livestock production. Because isometamidium, homidium, <b>diminazene</b> and quinapyramine are chemically closely related, cross-resistance has been suggested to occur between a number of these compounds and may therefore contribute to the multiple-drug resistance phenotypes observed in the field. However a clear definition of the cross-resistance relationships has not been possible {{due to the lack of}} trypanosome populations in which resistance to individual trypanocides has been unequivocally induced. Trypanosoma congolense IL 1180 is a cloned population that expressed a high level of sensitivity to isometamidium chloride, quinapyramine sulphate, homidium chloride and <b>diminazene</b> aceturate; the dose required to cure 50 percent of infected mice (CD 50 value) are 0. 018 mg/kg body weight (b. w.), 0. 23 mg/kg b. w., 0. 37 mg/kg b. w. and 2. 3 mg/kg b. w., respectively. In the work described here repeated subcurative treatment of infected Swiss white mice with either isometamidium chloride (Samorin) or quinapyramine sulphate (Trypacide) was used to independently increase the resistance of T. congolense IL 1180 to these two compounds. In the first experiment the resistance of T. congolense IL 1180 to isometamidium was increased to a CD 50 of 1. 7 mg/kg b. w. over an 11 -month period of drug selection to produce a population designated t. congolense IL 3343. Trypanosoma congolense IL 3341 and T. congolense IL 3342 were intermediate populations produced after 5 and 7 months drug selection, respectively. In order to determine whether Development of resistance to isometamidium resulted in cross-resistance to other anti-trypanosomal compounds, T. congolense IL 3343 was characterised in mice for its sensitivity to <b>diminazene</b> aceturate, homidium chloride and quinapyramine sulphate and had CD 50 values of 7. 8 mg/kg b. w., 12. 1 mg/kg b. w., respectively. Thus, a 94 -fold increase in resistance to isometamidium chloride was associated with a 3 -fold increase in resistance to <b>diminazene,</b> a 33 -fold increase in resistance to homidium, and a 4 -fold increase in resistance to quinapyramine. Values for T. congolense IL 3341 and T. congolense IL 3342 were intermediate between those of T. congolense IL 1180 and T. congolense IL 3343. In a second study, resistance to quinapyramine sulphate was induced in T. congolense IL 1180 over a 7 -month period of drug selection, resulting in a population designated T. congolense IL 1180 /Stabilate 12. This population had a quinapyramine sulphate CD 50 of > 9. 6 mg/kg b. w., and <b>diminazene</b> aceturate, homidium chloride and isometamidium chloride CD 50 values of 12. 7 mg/kg b. w., 10. g mg/kg b. w. and 0. 10 mg/kg b. w., respectively (Table 2). Thus, an approximately 40 -fold increase in resistance to quinapyramine was associated with a 6 -fold increase in resistance to isometamidium, 1 28 -fold increase in resistance to homidium and a 6 -fold increase in resistance to <b>diminazene.</b> In summary, these data indicate that Development of resistance to isometamidium in T. congolense IL 1180 was associated with a high level of cross-resistance to homidium, but low levels of cross-resistance to <b>diminazene</b> and quinapyramine. In contrast, the present data and those from goats indicate that Development of resistance to quinapyramine in the same trypanosome clone was associated with relatively high levels of cross-resistance to isometamidium, homidium and <b>diminazene.</b> These data therefore confirm the rationale for using isometamidium and <b>diminazene</b> as a "sanative" combination, and indicate that the use of quinapyramine in cattle, sheep and goats is contra-indicated since Development of resistance to the compound results in relatively high levels of cross-resistance to all three anti-trypanosomal compounds recommended for use in these livestock species. Finally, since resistance to <b>diminazene</b> is difficult to induce experimentally with <b>diminazene,</b> and such resistance usually occurs in the field as part of a multiple-resistance phenotype (Peregrine, 1994) ...|$|E
40|$|Reduced {{transcript}} {{levels of}} the heat shock protein 70 gene in <b>diminazene</b> aceturate-resistant Babesia gibsoni variants under low concentrations of <b>diminazene</b> aceturate In our previous report, we developed a <b>diminazene</b> aceturate (DA) -resistant Babesia gibsoni strain that was maintained in culture with 200 ng/ml DA. While developing this strain, we also obtained DA-resistant B. gibsoni variants, which were maintained in culture with DA from 1 to 175 ng/ml for more than 8 weeks. Because heat shock protein 70 (Hsp 70) seems to play important roles in adaptation to a stress environment in protozoan parasites, in the present study, we examined the copy number of B. gibsoni Hsp 70 (BgHsp 70) transcripts of those DA-resistant variants using quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. We found that when wild-type B. gibsoni was exposed to 1 ng/ml DA, the level of BgHsp 70 transcripts was decreased at day 14.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the antibabesial drug <b>diminazene</b> causes a rapid decline in haematocrit after treatment of dogs with high Babesia canis parasitaemias, compared with trypan blue. To test this, 19 dogs with clinically mild to moderate, uncomplicated babesiosis were placed in low, moderate or high parasitaemia groups, based on venous parasitaemias, and were allotted randomly to <b>diminazene</b> or trypan blue treatment groups. Haematocrit and parasitaemia were determined before treatment, and at 2, 6, 12, 18 and 24 hours. The drugs were compared for effects on haematocrit and parasite clearance. Changes in haematocrit after treatment were analysed. There {{were no significant differences between}} <b>diminazene</b> and trypan blue for haematocrit or parasite clearance. There was no correlation between initial parasitaemia and initial or post-treatment haematocrit. In all dogs, haematocrit fell following treatment. The maximum mean reduction from the baseline (0 h) was 0. 046 l/l (range 0. 02 - 0. 07 l/l); this most often occurred at 6 or 12 h. The 24 h haematocrit ranged from 70. 5 - 113. 6 % of baseline (mean absolute haematocrit 0. 019 l/l below baseline). All dogs improved clinically during the study period. It was concluded that either <b>diminazene</b> or trypan blue can be safely used to treat dogs with clinically mild or moderate, uncomplicated babesiosis. Parasitaemia need not be taken into account when deciding which antibabesial drug to administer and does not appear to be related to the degree of anaemia...|$|E
40|$|Over {{a period}} of 208 days a quinapyramine-resistant {{population}} was derived in vivo from a quinapyramine-susceptible clone of Trypanosoma congolense: IL 1180. While the dose of quinapyramine sulfate required to cure 50 % of mice infected with the parental clone was 0. 23 mg/kg of body weight, the 50 % curative dose for the resistant derivative, IL 1180 /Stabilate 12, was greater than 9. 6 mg/kg. This approximately 40 -fold increase in resistance to quinapyramine was shown {{to be associated with}} an 8 -fold increase in resistance to isometamidium, a 28 -fold increase in resistance to homidium, and a 5. 5 -fold increase in resistance to <b>diminazene.</b> Cross-resistance to homidium and <b>diminazene</b> was also demonstrated in goats. Two clones derived from the drug-resistant derivative underwent cyclical development in Glossina morsitans centralis, producing mature infection rates of 39. 6 and 23. 9 %. Thus, induction of resistance to quinapyramine in T. congolense IL 1180 was associated with cross-resistance to isometamidium, homidium, and <b>diminazene</b> and did not compromise the population's ability to undergo full cyclical development in tsetse flies...|$|E
40|$|Cationic {{compounds}} used in {{the treatment}} of veterinary African trypanosomiasis have structural properties similar to those of pentamidine, which has been {{used in the}} therapy of human trypanosomiasis and infection with Pneumocystis carinii. We have compared the activities of these drugs and other antimicrobial agents in an immunosuppressed rat model of P. carinii pneumonia. <b>Diminazene,</b> imidocarb, amicarbalide, quinapyramine, and isometamidium showed efficacy {{greater than or equal to}} that of pentamidine in the therapy of P. carinii infection, whereas ethidium and methylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone) were only slightly active against the organism. <b>Diminazene</b> and pentamidine also exhibited comparable efficacy in P. carinii prophylaxis, alpha-Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), a polyamine inhibitor, was ineffective therapy when used alone and did not improve the effectiveness of pentamidine or <b>diminazene.</b> Quinine, quinidine, quinacrine, chlorpromazine, spiramycin, Pentostam, Astiban, dehydroemetine, ampicillin, gentamicin, chloramphenicol, and spectinomycin also showed little or no activity against the organism. Thus, in this model anti-P. carinii activity appears to be a common property of veterinary cationic trypanocidal compounds. This should be important in studying structure-activity relationships and in developing new drugs for the treatment of P. carinii infection in humans...|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} of ensuring food safety through {{the reduction of}} chemical residues in our food supply cannot be overemphasized. Food safety remains a major challenge confronting contemporary society. To ensure wholesomeness of food of animal origin, the level of drug residues must be below the maximum residue limits (MRLs) set by World Health Organization (WHO) and Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). This calls for cost effective and efficient analytical methods for both quality assurance and monitoring. <b>Diminazene</b> aceturate {{is one of the}} few treatment drugs for animal trypanosomosis in the market. Because of its wide use in food producing animals, unwanted residues may be a risk to consumers. A competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (cELISA) for determination of <b>diminazene</b> residues in edible animal tissues after extraction in 0. 1 M borax pH 9. 7 is described.

40|$|<b>Diminazene</b> {{aceturate}} {{is one of}} {{a limited}} number of drugs currently being used in animals to treat the tsetse fly-transmitted protozoal disease, African trypanosomiasis. Efficacy of the drug at the recommended single IM administered doses of 3. 5 and 7. 0 mg/kg of body weight is widely acknowledged. However, resistance to the drug at these dosages has been reported. Although the mechanisms of resistance to <b>diminazene</b> are poorly understood, field and experimental data indicate that it may develop naturally through administration of subcurative doses, or as a result of cross-resistance. Evidence from other experimental studies indicates that there are additional mechanisms by which trypanosomes may develop resistance to <b>diminazene</b> aceturate. For instance, some populations ot Trypanosoma brucei and T. vivax are refractory to treatment because of their ability to invade the CNS, a site that is believed to be poorly accessible to <b>diminazene.</b> Furthermore, in recent studies carried out in goats, it has been documented that the ability of T. Congolense IL 3274 to survive treatment with <b>diminazene</b> depends on the stage of infection when treatment is administered; populations of the parasite reappeared in animals that were treated on day 19 after tsetse fly challenge, whereas all goats were cured when treated on day 1 of infection. Because trypanosomes are confined to the skin on day 1 after infection, but thereafter invade the blood circulation, {{it is possible that the}} efficacy of the treatment on day 1 is attributable to exposure of the small number of parasites, relative to later stages of infection, to higher concentrations of drug than those attained in blood. The objective of the study reported here was to determine whether diminazene's pharmacokinetics differ between plasma and lymph draining the skin of goats and therefore account for the variation in therapeutic activity of the drug at different stages of a tsetse fly-transmitted infection. Peripheral lymph was used for this work because it appears to be identical in composition to tissue interstitial fluid, into which trypanosomes are inoculated by infected tsetse flies when feeding...|$|E

40|$|Eleven {{groups of}} male cattle (39 on average per group) were {{monitored}} for presence of trypanosomes at 3 -weekly intervals for periods {{of up to}} 27 weeks at a feedlot of Ferkessedougou, northern Cote d'Ivoire, in an area supposedly free of tsetse. All animals originated from or grazed during transhumance in south west Mali. The groups were assigned to different treatment regimes {{as they enter the}} feed lot. All animals of six groups were treated with <b>diminazene</b> aceturate {{on the first day of}} sampling, three groups at a dose of 3. 5 mg/kg and three groups at 7 mg/kg body weight. Similarly three groups were treated with isometamidium chloride at a dose of 0. 5 mg/kg. As the feed lot ceased its operations, only one group was treated with the same drug at a dose of 1 mg/kg and an 11 th group was treated with homidium bromide at a dose of 1 mg/kg. Every animal was thus treated with either <b>diminazene</b> aceturate, isometamidum chloride or homidium bromide at the time of first sampling and with a "sanative pair" if detected parasitaemic again. No animals were detected parasitaemic at any time in the one group initially treated with homidium. Five animals were detected parasitaemic at week 0 in two groups treated with isometamidium chloride at 1 mg/kg bodyweight. Two of these animals were detected parasitaemic again, one at 3 weeks and one at 12 weeks following treatment. Infections were then treated with dimianzene aceturate at 7 mg/kg body weight and apparently cured. No animals were detected parasitaemic at any time in the other two groups treated with isometamidium chloride <b>diminazene</b> aceturate at 3. 5 mg/kg, and in 2 of the 22 animals detected parasitaemic 3 and receiving <b>diminazene</b> aceturate at 7 mg/kg body weight. There was 15 subsequent cases of parasitaemia in animals first treated with <b>diminazene</b> aceturate at 3. 5 mg/kg body weight that were sampled on at least three occasions following further treatment with isometamidum chloride. Parasitaemia was detected again in 8 animals (53 percent) within 9 weeks of treatment. These results provide evidence of a problem of drug resistance to isometamidum having developed among trypanosomes in two of the eleven groups of animals. <b>Diminazene</b> aceturate at 3. 5 mg/kg body weight had apparently failed to cure infections in 14 animals in these two groups. there was however less evidence of drug failure when the higher dose of 7 mg/kg body weight was used in two other groups...|$|E

At the first peak of parasitemia different groups of 200 teneral Glossina morsitans centralis were fed once on each animal, just prior to treatment with <b>diminazene</b> aceturate at a dose of 3. 5 mg kg- 1 body weight (b. w.). thereafter, all animals were monitored {{three times a week}} and retreated with the same drug dosage whenever the packed red blood cell volume (PCV) declined in three consecutive samples from {{one or more of the}} animals. After eight treatments at approximately two-week intervals the mean duration when parasites were not detected after each treatment did not increase, but remained at 7. 8 (+ or -) 1. 1 days. the mean PCV declined from 33. 2 (+ or -) 0. 6 percent at the time of the first treatment to a mean inter-treatment value of 23. 7 (+ or -) 2. 6 percent between the eighth at ninth treatment. Therefore, subsequent to the eighth treatment <b>diminazene</b> aceturate was administered as before but at a dose of 7. 0 mg kg- 1 b. w. After treatment with this higher dosage the mean inter-treatment PCV increased from 25. 4 (+ or -) 2. 4 percent following the first treatment to 32. 9 (+ or -) 1. 7 percent for the two-month period following the fifth treatment. At least 14 days after treatments with <b>diminazene</b> aceturate at 3. 5 mg kg- 1 b. w., and 30 days after treatments at 7. 0 mg kg- 1 b. w., similar numbers of flies as used for the first feed were fed on one occasion on each animal.
