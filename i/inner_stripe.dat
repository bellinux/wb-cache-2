A morphometric {{study was}} undertaken to quantitate the morphologic changes induced by ADH availability in the rat kidney. Homozygous Brattleboro rats with hereditary diabetes insipidus (DI) (no ADH) {{were compared to}} heterozygous Brattleboro control rats (HZ) and to DI rats after 5 to 6 weeks of continuous ADH infusion by implantable Alzet osmotic minipumps (TDI). ADH resulted in a 37 % increase in mass of kidney per unit body wt. All kidney zones and all nephron segments were not increased uniformly. The <b>inner</b> <b>stripe</b> was enlarged more than other renal zones. It represented 15. 5 ± 0. 7 % of the total kidney height along the cortico-papillary axis in DI and 22. 2 ± 1. 5 % in TDI (P < 0. 025). The volume of the <b>inner</b> <b>stripe</b> in DI and TDI amounted to 10. 9 ± 0. 9 and 18. 0 ± 1. 0 % of the total kidney volume, respectively (P < 0. 001). Selective increases in tubular diameter and cell height, due mostly to an hypertrophy of pre-existing cells, were observed in the earliest part of the thick ascending limbs (TAL) in the <b>inner</b> <b>stripe,</b> resulting in a twofold increase in epithelial volume per unit tubular length (P < 0. 001). Volume density of mitochondria and surface density of basolateral membranes were unchanged but, due {{to the increase in}} cell volume and <b>inner</b> <b>stripe</b> thickness, the amount of mitochondria and the surface area of basolateral membrane in the TAL were more than tripled in the <b>inner</b> <b>stripe</b> of treated rats.

Because {{of the recently}} observed augmentation of medullary hypoxic injury by calcium in isolated perfused rat kidneys (Kidney Int 34 : 186 – 194, 1988), renal morphology of chronic, prolonged hypercalcemia was investigated in vivo. Rats were treated with repeated injections of vitamin D 2 (400, 000 units/week) for two to eight weeks. Chronic elevation of plasma calcium from 2. 1 to 2. 8 mmol/liter (P < 0. 001) was associated by a fall in maximal urine osmolality with no change in glomerular filtration rate. The most significant morphological alterations occurred in the <b>inner</b> <b>stripe</b> of the outer medulla; these changes were characterized by a sequence of active injury with subsequent destruction and atrophy of the medullary thick ascending limbs, fibroblastic and lymphocytic infiltration, and secondary dilatation of collecting ducts.

The cellular localization of angiotensin II (Ang II) receptors in the <b>inner</b> <b>stripe</b> of {{the outer}} medulla of the rat kidney was investigated by using high resolution light and electron microscopic autoradiography. Fresh tissue blocks from the <b>inner</b> <b>stripe</b> {{of the outer}} medulla were incubated with 125 I-[Sar 1 Ile 8] Ang II and prepared for microscopic autoradiography. At the light microscopic level, 125 I-[Sar 1 Ile 8] Ang II was found to penetrate into the tissue and to bind specifically to sites outlining renal tubules and vasa recta bundles. Electron microscopic autoradiography revealed that silver grains were detected over interstitial cells located between the tubules and components of the vasa recta bundles, but no silver grains were detected overlying {{the cells of the}} thin descending or thick ascending limbs of the loop of Henle, the collecting ducts, the vasa recta, or other blood vessels. These interstitial cells contained abundant endoplasmic reticulum, microfilaments, occasional lipid droplets and extensive cytoplasmic processes which closely related to the basement membranes of the vasa recta and loops of Henle. The cells therefore closely resemble type 1 interstitial cells. Since Ang II binding sites are absent in the inner medulla, the cells labelled by this technique must be a subset of type 1 interstitial cells, distinct from the typical lipid-laden interstitial cells most abundant in the inner medulla. These findings demonstrate that type 1 interstitial cells are the primary sites for a high density of Ang II receptors located in the <b>inner</b> <b>stripe</b> of the outer medulla...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The <b>inner</b> <b>stripe</b> of {{the outer}} {{medullary}} collecting tubule is a major distal nephron segment in urinary acidification. To examine the mechanism of basolateral membrane H+/OH-/HCO ~ transport in this segment, cell pH was measured microfluorometrically in the <b>inner</b> <b>stripe</b> of the rabbit outer medullary collecting tubule perfused in vitro using the pH-sensitive fluorescent dye, (2 ', 7 ') bis(carboxyethyl) -(5, 6) -carboxyfluorescein. Decreasing peritubular pH from 7. 4 to 6. 8 (changing [HCO~] from 25 to 5 mM) caused a cell acidification of 0. 25 -+ 0. 02 pH units, while a similar luminal change resulted in a smaller cell acidification of only 0. 04 _+ 0. 01 pH units. Total replacement of peritubular Cl- with gluconate caused cell pH to increase by 0. 18 _+ 0. 04 pH units, an effect inhibited by 100 #M peritubular DIDS and independent of Na +. Direct coupling between C 1 - and base was suggested by the continued presence of peritubular CI- removal-induced cell alkalinization under the condition of a cell voltage clamp (K+-valinomycin). In addition, 90 % of basolateral membrane H+/OH-/HCO ~ permeability was inhibited by complete removal of luminal and peritubular CI-. Peritubular Cl [...] induced cell pH changes were inhibited two-thirds by removal of exogenous CO~/HCO~ from the system. The apparent K ~ for peritubular CI- determined {{in the presence of}} 25 mM luminal and peritubular [HCO~] was 113. 5 _+ 14. 8 mM.

Adriamycin (ADR) nephrosis and a model of unilateral ADR-induced proteinuria were produced in Sprague-Dawley (S. D.) rats to investigate the mechanism of sodium retention by the nephrotic kidney. Plasma volume, {{as measured by the}} dilution principle using radioiodinated serum albumin, was significantly higher in nephrotic animals than in control ones (NS: 69. 61 ± 15. 02 : control: 47. 05 ± 5. 32 ml/kg: P < 0. 01). Similarly plasma levels of immunoreactive ANP (iANP) were significantly higher in nephrotic animals compared to controls (NS 104. 22 ± 36. 41; control 59. 94 ± 20. 88 pg/ml; P < 0. 05). Using the unilateral model we found a markedly reduced diuretic and natriuretic response to the infusion of synthetic rat atrial natriuretic peptide (BNP 1 – 28) in proteinuric kidney but not in contralateral kidney, despite a comparable increase in glomerular filtration rate. To explain the blunted diuresis and natriuresis in the presence of normal glomerular response to BNP, we investigated the possibility of an abnormality at post-glomerular level by studying ANP receptor density and affinity of the <b>inner</b> <b>stripe</b> of outer medulla and the inner medulla in ADR- and vehicle-treated rats. The <b>inner</b> <b>stripe</b> of outer medulla and the inner medulla receptor density and affinity were not significantly different in ADR rats as compared to animals given the vehicle alone. These results show that: 1) plasma volume and plasma levels of iANP are significantly higher in ADR-treated rats as compared to control animals; 2) the reduced diuretic and natriuretic response to synthetic ANP in the unilateral model of ADR nephrosis is a consequence of an abnormal response of the proteinuric kidney and does not reflect systemic changes; and 3) the <b>inner</b> <b>stripe</b> of outer medulla and the inner medulla ANP receptor density and affinity are comparable in normal and nephrotic rats...|$|E

40|$|Hypothyroidism in the rat is {{associated}} with a decrease in kidney size and weight. We have shown previously that this decrease involves all nephron segments in the cortex and outer medulla and is especially pronounced in the medullary thick ascending limb (mTAL). Therefore, the present study was undertaken for examination of the effect of hypothyroidism on the ultrastructure of the rat mTAL. Hypothyroidism was induced by feeding aminotriazole (ATZ), 0. 5 g/kg of food, for 4 weeks. A second group of animals received ATZ plus a daily injection of L-thyroxine (T 4). A third group was fed a normal diet only and served as control animals. The kidneys were preserved by in vivo perfusion with 3 % glutaraldehyde, and tissue from the <b>inner</b> and outer <b>stripe</b> of the outer medulla was processed for electron microscopy. Morphometric analysis revealed a significant decrease in the cross-sectional area of the mTAL in both the <b>inner</b> and outer <b>stripe</b> of the outer medulla in hypothyroid animals. No changes were observed in the surface density of either the apical or basolateral plasma membranes following ATZ treatment. However, when calculated per millimeter tubule, there was a significant decrease in the surface area (SL) of both the apical and basolateral plasma membranes of the mTAL of hypothyroid animals in comparison with control animals. Simultaneous treatment with T 4 prevented the ATZ-induced reduction in both tubule cross-sectional area and in the SL of the plasma membrane. These findings suggest that the observed changes in SL of the plasma membrane of the mTAL are due to a regulatory role of thyroid hormone in membrane proliferation as well as in cell growth in general...|$|R

40|$|The outer {{medullary}} collecting duct (OMCD) absorbs HCO 3 - at high rates, {{but it is}} {{not clear}} if it responds to metabolic acidosis to increase H+ secretion. We measured net HCO 3 - transport in isolated perfused OMCDs taken from deep in the <b>inner</b> <b>stripes</b> of kidneys from control and acidotic (NH 4 Cl-fed for 3 d) rabbits. We used specific inhibitors to characterize the mechanisms of HCO 3 - transport: 10 microM Sch 28080 or luminal K+ removal to inhibit P-type H+,K+-ATPase activity, and 5 - 10 nM bafilomycin A 1 or 1 - 10 nM concanamycin A to inhibit H+-ATPase activity. The results were comparable using either of each pair of inhibitors, and allowed us to show in control rabbits that 65 % of net HCO 3 - absorption depended on H+-ATPase (H flux), and 35 % depended on H+,K+-ATPase (H,K flux). Tubules from acidotic rabbits showed higher rates of HCO 3 - absorption (16. 8 +/- 0. 3 vs. 12. 8 +/- 0. 2 pmol/min per mm, P < 0. 01). There was no difference in the H,K flux (5. 9 +/- 0. 2 vs. 5. 8 +/- 0. 2 pmol/min per mm), whereas there was a 61 % higher H flux in segments from acidotic rabbits (11. 3 +/- 0. 2 vs. 7. 0 +/- 0. 2 pmol/min per mm, P < 0. 01). Transport was then measured in other OMCDs before and after incubation for 1 h at pH 6. 8, followed by 2 h at pH 7. 4 (in vitro metabolic acidosis). Acid incubation in vitro stimulated HCO 3 - absorption (12. 3 +/- 0. 3 to 16. 2 +/- 0. 3 pmol/min per mm, P < 0. 01), while incubation at pH 7. 4 for 3 h did not change basal rate (11. 8 +/- 0. 4 to 11. 7 +/- 0. 4 pmol/min per mm). After acid incubation the H,K flux did not change, (4. 7 +/- 0. 4 to 4. 6 +/- 0. 4 pmol/min per mm), however, there was a 60 % increase in H flux (6. 6 +/- 0. 3 to 10. 8 +/- 0. 3 pmol/min per mm, P < 0. 01). In OMCDs from acidotic animals, and in OMCDs incubated in acid in vitro, there was a higher basal rate and a further increase in HCO 3 - absorption (16. 7 +/- 0. 4 to 21. 3 +/- 0. 3 pmol/min per mm, P < 0. 01) because of increased H flux (11. 5 +/- 0. 3 to 15. 7 +/- 0. 2 pmol/min per mm, P < 0. 01) without any change in H,K flux (5. 4 +/- 0. 3 to 5. 6 +/- 0. 3 pmol/min per mm). These data indicate that HCO 3 - absorption (H+ secretion) in OMCD is stimulated by metabolic acidosis in vivo and in vitro by an increase in H+-ATPase-sensitive HCO 3 - absorption. The mechanism of adaptation may involve increased synthesis and exocytosis to the apical membrane of proton pumps. This adaptation helps maintain homeostasis during metabolic acidosis...|$|R

40|$|A {{biologic}} role of HIF- 1 in the renal medulla. BackgroundActivation of hypoxia-inducible factor- 1 (HIF- 1) is {{the primary}} defensive mechanism against hypoxia. HIF- 1 activation generally occurs in pathologic disruption of tissue oxygenation. However, a biologic role of HIF- 1 in the medulla of the kidney, which is considered perpetually hypoxic under physiologic conditions due to its unique circulation, remains to be elucidated. MethodsThe expression of HIF- 1 α was detected by immunohistochemical analysis. Functional studies of HIF in medulla were carried out by gene transfer of various plasmids by retrograde injection via ureter. ResultsOur immunohistochemical analysis detected HIF- 1 α in the <b>inner</b> <b>stripe</b> and the inner medulla of normal rats. Water deprivation {{increased the number of}} HIF- 1 α–positive cells, which may be mediated by an increase in medullar workload and a decrease in local blood flow. To perform functional studies, we performed gene transfer. Efficient expression of the transgene was confirmed using an enhanced green fluorescent protein (E-GFP) expressing vector. Our histologic and immunoblotting analysis detected the transgene product at the inner medulla and the <b>inner</b> <b>stripe</b> 48 hours after injection. Administration of negative-dominant HIF induced severe damage in the medulla of normal rats.

Radiocontrast agents and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) {{are commonly used}} for the {{diagnosis and treatment of}} renal colic. We studied their impact during unilateral acute urinary outflow obstruction upon renal microcirculation and parenchymal integrity. Laser-Doppler and ultrasonic regional flow measurements demonstrated selective decline of outer medullary blood flow by 23 ± 2 % during an acute increase of intra-pelvic pressure to 50 to 55 cm H 2 O (N = 28, X ± SEM, P < 0. 01). In rats preconditioned with indomethacin, this manipulation reduced medullary blood flow by 50 ± 4 % (N = 16, P < 0. 01 vs. obstruction alone), with cortical and total renal blood flow declining by 18 ± 4 % and 16 ± 2 %, respectively (P < 0. 01). Unilateral obstruction alone for 24 hours in intact rats resulted in injury (hemorrhage and necrosis) to the papilla and fornix (formed laterally by <b>inner</b> <b>stripe</b> and medially by the inner medulla). These changes were detected as early as 30 minutes after ureteral ligature by staining for fragmented nuclear DNA (TUNEL). Mild damage of thick ascending limbs (mTALs) was associated with substantial medial fornix injury. Indomethacin markedly increased mTAL injury in obstructed kidneys, but attenuated inner medullary damage, both in the medial border of the urinary space and at the papilla. This latter protective effect, probably mediated by the decrease in intrapelvic pressure, was blunted by concomitant intravenous fluid load. Contrast media (iothalamate) and L-NAME (Nω nitro-L-arginine methyl ester) both augmented <b>inner</b> <b>stripe</b> and inner medullary damage in hydronephrotic kidneys. In rats concomitantly subjected to radiocontrast, indomethacin and L-NAME (an acute renal failure protocol, J Clin Invest 94 : 1069, 1994), unilateral obstruction augmented <b>inner</b> <b>stripe</b> hypoxic damage (65 ± 6 % vs. 24 ± 11 % of mTALs in contralateral kidneys, N = 7, P < 0. 01). Injury was maximal at the fornix (93 ± 6 % vs. 39 ± 14 % of mTALs in the mid-inner stripe, P < 0. 01) and extended to the outer stripe and medullary rays. Thus, in the rat acute ureteral obstruction alters medullary blood flow and within 24 hours produces medullary damage in both forniceal and inner medullary locations, that is exacerbated by concomitant measures which limit medullary oxygenation. Contrast studies, forced hydration and NSAIDs for renal colic are potentially harmful and their use should be re-evaluated...|$|E
40|$|Developmental {{changes in}} {{angiotensin}} II receptor subtypes and AT 1 receptor mRNA in rat kidney. The changes in angiotensin II receptor subtypes, type 1 (AT 1) and type 2 (AT 2) binding, and AT 1 mRNA levels during development were {{studied in the}} rat kidney using autoradiographic and in situ hybridization techniques. Autoradiographic analysis of 125 I-[Sar 1, Ile 8]Ang II binding to slide-mounted kidney sections from 2 and 5 day-old rats discerned AT 2 binding sites associated with advancing tubules and ampullae of the ureteric bud, and in the metanephric mass in the nephrogenic zone of the cortex. AT 1 binding was present in the metanephric mass and immature glomeruli on days 2, 5 and 7 after birth. Differentiating and mature kidneys of 14 -day, 21 -day and 14 -week old adult rats had solely AT 1 receptor binding over glomeruli in renal cortex and in the <b>inner</b> <b>stripe</b> of the outer medulla. AT 1 mRNA was expressed discretely as early as 2 days {{of age in the}} immature glomeruli and in a diffuse radiating pattern in the renal cortex. In the medulla, AT 1 receptor mRNA expression appeared discretely on day 7 and reached peak levels on day 21 in the <b>inner</b> <b>stripe</b> of the outer medulla. The data indicate that AT 1 receptor mRNA is developmentally regulated in rat kidney and its expression in the cortex precedes that of AT 1 receptor ligand binding. The temporal pattern of expression of binding for both receptor subtypes suggests that while AT 2 receptors may be involved in cell proliferation and early differentiation of the nephron, AT 1 receptors have a dual role, early in nephron differentiation and later in development in renal function...|$|E
40|$|The two LHC {{injection}} kicker magnet systems must each {{produce a}} kick of 1. 2 T. m with a flattop duration variable up to 7. 86 µs, and {{rise and fall}} times of less than 0. 9 µs and 3 µs, respectively. Each system is composed of four 5 Ω transmission line kicker magnets with matched terminating resistors and pulse forming networks (PFN). The LHC beam has a high intensity, hence a beam screen is required in the aperture of the magnets This screen consists of a ceramic tube with conducting “stripes ” on the <b>inner</b> wall. The <b>stripes</b> provide a path for the image current of the beam and screen the magnet ferrites against Wake fields. The stripes initially used gave adequately low beam impedance however stripe discharges occured during pulsing of the magnet: hence further development of the beam screen was undertaken. This paper presents options considered to meet the often conflicting needs for low beam impedance, shielding of the ferrite, fast field rise time and good electrical and vacuum behaviour...|$|R
40|$|Reticulated {{vitreous}} carbon (RVC) of different porosities (20, 45, 60, 80, and 100 ppi—pores per inch) {{has been used}} as a large surface area substrate for preparing 3 D-like PbO 2 coatings (RVC/PbO 2) as well as composite coatings with hydrothermally synthesized titanate nanotubes (RVC/PbO 2 /TiNT) by galvanostatic electrodeposition from baths containing lead(II) methanesulfonate and methanesulfonic acid. The effect of the RVC porosity on the coating thickness, the electrocatalytic behaviour and the ability to remove the colour and total organic carbon (TOC) from solutions containing the azo dye Methyl Orange has been systematically assessed. As shown from scanning electron micrographs, the greatest thickness (up to 120 ?m) was obtained using > 60 ppi, but the ?-PbO 2 nanocrystallytes mainly grew on the external surface, leaving mostly uncoated <b>inner</b> RVC <b>stripes</b> and ending in planar-like PbO 2 -based electrodes. In contrast, thinner but perfectly adherent and homogeneous coating of the inner and outer surface was achieved with 20 - 60 ppi, showing electrodes with an optimal three-dimensionallity. This was especially confirmed by cyclic voltammograms for the composite coatings, as deduced from their highest electroactivity that can be related to enhanced adsorption onto the TiNT clusters and the larger ability to produce active PbO 2 (radical dotOHOH). The comparative electro-oxidation of 0. 25 × 10 ? 3 mol dm? 3 Methyl Orange acidic solutions in 0. 05 mol dm? 3 Na 2 SO 4 at 0. 6 A demonstrated that RVC (45 ppi) /PbO 2 /TiNT was the optimum material. It allowed the quickest decolourisation, reaching 60 % in 2. 5 min and > 98 % at 45 min, and > 55 % TOC abatement at 240 min. The anode presented a perfect surface coverage, with no evidence of RVC degradation. The effect of dye concentration and supporting electrolyte nature was studied, revealing a very positive effect of NaCl...|$|R
5000|$|The {{character}} Static {{was developed}} into {{the lead of}} the animated series Static Shock with some changes in the material, generally to make the character more suitable for a younger and wider audience, but still with a focus on contemporary relevance. In the series' first two seasons, Static's outfit was a Blue coat with yellow <b>inner</b> lining and <b>stripes</b> on his coat sleeves, a white shirt with his trademark black lightning bolt symbol, black pants with a white mask, and yellow goggles. By season three, his wardrobe is mostly black and blue with some gold/yellow highlights, and the yellow goggles are replaced with dark blue shades; this wardrobe later appears in his Teen Titans comics appearance. His future self wears a similar, but slightly darker tone-wise, scheme. In the animated series, Virgil Hawkins (voiced by Phil LaMarr) is a fourteen-year-old honors student at Dakota Union High School who gains his powers by a mutagenic gas explosion, dubbed [...] "the Big Bang" [...] by the media, which grants numerous residents of Dakota superpowers; those affected are likewise dubbed [...] "Bang Babies". Virgil lives with his widowed father Robert Hawkins, a social worker {{and the head of the}} Freeman Community Center, and his sister Sharon Hawkins, a university student and hospital volunteer. His mother Jean Hawkins died a few years prior, the victim of a stray bullet while she worked as a paramedic during a riot; her death causes Virgil to develop an intense fear/hatred of guns. In [...] "Static in Africa," [...] it is revealed (or at least hinted at) that Virgil and his family are all of Ghana ancestry (although no relatives are mentioned). Static idolizes other positive black superheroes in his world, such as Soul Power, Anansi the Spider (who befriends Virgil and calls him [...] "his hero" [...] as well), and particularly the Green Lantern John Stewart. Over the course of the series, Static teams up with many DC heroes including Batman and Robin, Batman's future successor Terry McGinnis, the Justice League, and even Superman himself. The episode [...] "Future Shock" [...] reveals that by the time of Batman Beyond, Static is considered one of the world's greatest heroes; he also has a son who is hinted to be a hero as well.|$|R
