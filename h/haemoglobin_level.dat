Results: Although malaria {{was associated with a}} reduction in maternal haemoglobin (10. 8 g/dL vs. 12. 1 g/ dL, p < 0. 001), no reduction in cord haemoglobin and no significant relationship between maternal and cord <b>haemoglobin</b> <b>levels</b> were found. Cord blood markers of haematological and hypoxic statuses did not differ between malaria-infected and uninfected women. Maternal malaria was associated with decreased TGF- and increased cord ferritin, the latter of which was positively correlated with parasitaemia (r = 0. 474, p = 0. 009).

40|$|Glycated <b>haemoglobin</b> <b>levels</b> (HbA 1 and HbA 1 c) are {{established}} parameters of long-term glycaemic control in diabetic patients. Depending on the method used, fetal haemoglobin {{interferes with the}} assays for glycated haemoglobin.

Glycated (HbA 1 c) and fetal <b>haemoglobin</b> <b>levels</b> were measured by high pressure liquid chromatography in 60 (30 female) adult Type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetic patients of Swiss descent, and were compared with levels obtained from 60 normal, non-diabetic control subjects matched for age and sex.

The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the association between the <b>haemoglobin</b> <b>levels</b> and the dmft index in a random sample of paediatric dental patients who visit a teaching hospital in KSA. MethodsThis 11 -month cross sectional study was conducted at King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Jeddah, KSA from May 2014 to April 2015. A total of 160 children with dental caries were divided into 2 groups: non-anaemic and anaemic groups. The prevalence of caries was measured using the dmft index and was compared between the two groups. Statistical analyses were performed using the chi-square tests at a 0. 05 % significance level. ResultsOne hundred-sixty subjects were recruited in this study. Children with lower mean <b>haemoglobin</b> <b>levels</b> (anaemic children) had significantly higher mean dmft indices (11. 20  ±  2. 6) than the non-anaemic children (9. 66  ±  1. 2 %, p <  0. 05).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Although zidovudine-free regimens are {{increasingly}} used in pregnancy, their haematological effects in mothers and newborns are incompletely defined. METHODS: The haematological profiles of 119 HIV-infected {{women and their}} neonates with highly active antiretroviral regimens (HAART) in pregnancy including or not zidovudine (ZDV) were investigated. Three groups were compared: 1) women who started ZDV-lamivudine (3 TC) -based HAART during pregnancy (ZDVs, n = 60); 2) women on ZDV- 3 TC-based HAART from conception (ZDVc, n = 18); 3) women on ZDV-free HAART from conception (ZDVf, n = 41). RESULTS: At the beginning of pregnancy, <b>haemoglobin</b> <b>levels</b> were similar in the three groups. By week 36 compared to baseline, <b>haemoglobin</b> <b>levels</b> had a significantly greater decrease in ZDVf women compared to ZDVs women (ZDVf: - 2. 03 g/dl; ZDVs: - 1. 36 g/dl, p = 0. 036). A similar trend was observed for occurrence of maternal anaemia at 36 weeks. Newborns with no prenatal ZDV exposure had significantly higher <b>haemoglobin</b> <b>levels</b> at birth (ZDVf: 16. 1 ± 1. 4 g/dl, ZDVs: 14. 3 ± 2. 0 g/dl; ZDVc: 14. 6 ± 2. 4 g/dl, p = 0. 044 and 0. 003, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Half of ZDV-unexposed mothers had anaemia {{at the end of}} pregnancy, but their neonates had normal <b>haemoglobin</b> <b>levels.</b> ZDV initiation was associated with a lower occurrence of maternal anaemia during the third trimester and decreased <b>haemoglobin</b> <b>levels</b> in the newborns.

50|$|The body {{automatically}} detects {{the lower}} hemoglobin level, and compensatory mechanisms start up. The heart pumps more blood with each beat.

50|$|General {{people can}} develop {{short-term}} tolerance with careful physical preparation and systematic monitoring of movements, but the biological changes are quite temporary and reversible {{when they return}} to lowlands. Moreover, unlike lowland people who only experience increased breathing {{for a few days}} after entering high altitudes, Tibetans retain this rapid breathing and elevated lung-capacity throughout their lifetime. This enables them to inhale larger amounts of air per unit of time to compensate for low oxygen levels. In addition, they have high levels (mostly double) of nitric oxide in their blood, when compared to lowlanders, and this probably helps their blood vessels dilate for enhanced blood circulation. Further, their <b>haemoglobin</b> <b>level</b> is not significantly different (average 15.6 g/dl in males and 14.2 g/dl in females), from those of people living at low altitude. (Normally, mountaineers experience >2 g/dl increase in Hb level at Mt. Everest base camp in two weeks.) In this way they are able to evade both the effects of hypoxia and mountain sickness throughout life. Even when they climbed the highest summits like Mt. Everest, they showed regular oxygen uptake, greater ventilation, more brisk hypoxic ventilatory responses, larger lung volumes, greater diffusing capacities, constant body weight and a better quality of sleep, compared to people from the lowland.|$|E

50|$|Cynthia Beall is {{the leading}} {{scientist}} {{in the study of}} high-altitude adaptation in humans, particularly in places where there is little air to breathe. Among the Tibetans the first thing that she discovered was that they could live at high levels without having high hemoglobin concentrations or large chests, they had high birth-weighted babies, and no complications of mountain sickness. Unlike most humans who migrate to high altitude, the Tibetans do not exhibit the elevated haemoglobin concentrations to cope up with oxygen deficiency, but they inhale more air with each breath and breathe more rapidly, and retain this unusual breathing and elevated lung-capacity throughout their lifetime. Their high levels (mostly double) of nitric oxide in the blood increase their blood vessels to dilate for enhanced blood circulation. An astonishing discovery of Beall is the convergent evolution in humans from her studies on other highlanders such as the Amhara in the high-plateau regions of northwest Ethiopia, the Omro people in the southwest Ethiopia, and the Aymara of the American Andes. She found that these groups had adapted to low oxygen environment very differently from the Tibetans. Physiological conditions such as resting ventilation, hypoxic ventilatory response, oxygen saturation, and haemoglobin concentration are significantly different between the Tibetans and the Aymaras. The Amharans exhibit elevated haemoglobin levels, like Andeans and lowlander peoples at high altitudes, while the Andeans have increased <b>haemoglobin</b> <b>level</b> like normal people in the highlands. All these observations show that different people adapted to high altitude in different genetic and physiological responses.|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} to the Tibetans, the Andean highlanders, who have been living at high-altitudes {{for no more than}} 11,000 years, show different pattern of haemoglobin adaptation. Their haemoglobin concentration is higher compared to those of lowlander population, which also happens to lowlanders moving to high altitude. When they spend some weeks in the lowland their heamoglobin drops to average of other people. This shows only temporary and reversible acclimatisation. However, in {{contrast to}} lowland people, they do have increased oxygen level in their haemoglobin, that is, more oxygen per blood volume than other people. This confers an ability to carry more oxygen in each red blood cell, making a more effective transport of oxygen in their body, while their breathing is essentially at the same rate. This enables them to overcome hypoxia and normally reproduce without risk of death for the mother or baby. The Andean highlanders are known from the 16th-century missionaries that their reproduction had always been normal, without any effect in the giving birth or the risk for early pregnancy loss, which are common to hypoxic stress. They have developmentally acquired enlarged residual lung volume and its associated increase in alveolar area, which are supplemented with increased tissue thickness and moderate increase in red blood cells. Though the physical growth in body size is delayed, growth in lung volumes is accelerated. An incomplete adaptation such as elevated haemoglobin levels still leaves them at risk for mountain sickness with old age. Among the Quechua people of the Altiplano, there is a significant variation in NOS3 (the gene encoding endothelial nitric oxide synthase, eNOS), which is associated with higher levels of nitric oxide in high altitude. Nuñoa children of Quechua ancestry exhibit higher blood-oxygen content (91.3) and lower heart rate (84.8) than their counterpart school children of different ethnicity, who have an average of 89.9 blood-oxygen and 88-91 heart rate. High-altitude born and bred females of Quechua origins have comparatively enlarged lung volume for increased respiration. Blood profile comparisons show that among the Andeans, Aymaran highlanders are better adapted to highlands than the Quechuas. Among the Bolivian Aymara people, the resting ventilation and hypoxic ventilatory response were quite low (roughly 1.5 times lower), in contrast to those of the Tibetans. The intrapopulation genetic variation was relatively less among the Aymara people. Moreover, unlike the Tibetans, the blood <b>haemoglobin</b> <b>level</b> is quite normal among Aymarans, with an average of 19.2 g/dl for males and 17.8 g/dl for females. Among the different native highlander populations, the underlying physiological responses to adaptation are quite different. For example, among four quantitative features, such as are resting ventilation, hypoxic ventilatory response, oxygen saturation, and haemoglobin concentration, the levels of variations are significantly different between the Tibetans and the Aymaras. The Andeans, in general are the most poorly adapted, as particularly shown by their frequent mountain sickness and loss of adaptative characters when they move to lowlands.|$|E

To examine {{the effectiveness of}} a diabetes centre in restoring metabolic control in patients with poorly controlled diabetes. Design. Retrospective review of medical records. Setting. Diabetes centre of a district hospital, Hong Kong. Participants. Patients with poorly controlled diabetes referred to a diabetes centre. Main outcome measures. Primary endpoints were mean change in glycated <b>haemoglobin</b> <b>levels</b> and the number of patients who achieved glycated <b>haemoglobin</b> <b>levels</b> of 7. 0 % or lower, 7. 5 % or lower, and 8. 0 % or lower, respectively. Complementary endpoints were serial changes in body weight, blood pressure, and lipids. Results. One hundred and eighty-five patients, predominantly with type 2 diabetes (94. 6 %), were reviewed.
