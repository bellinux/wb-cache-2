40|$|In Ethiopia {{attempts}} have been made to brood chicks naturally with a portable hay-box brooder. A broody hen rearing and protecting only a few chicks ceases laying during incubation and brooding periods. Yet the success or failure of the brooding process depends on the maternal instinct of the hen and prevalence of predatory animals. A simple box consisting of a door, small ventilation holes wire enclosed run and a cen' tral nest with an opening to the door was constructed. Hay was closely stuffed between the sides of the box and the central nest. A sack filled with hay was used to cover the top of the box. Finally, day-old chicks were transferred to the box as well as to an <b>electric</b> <b>brooder</b> house for comparative study. Batches of up to 70 chicks were successfully raised by the box except during the rainy season. There were no significant differences between the hay-box and electric brooders in chick mortality, rate of maturity and egg production. The growth rate of the hay-box groups was slower during the first month, but rapid growth was achieved thereafter.

40|$|Goslings and ducklings can be {{successfully}} brooded by broody chicken hens and most breeds of ducks and geese. If the young birds were not hatched by the broody female, place them under her at night. Be certain broody birds {{are free of}} lice and mites. Provide the hen and her brood with a dry comfortable shelter. The hen will need grain and plenty of fresh, clean water supplied in a container that will not allow the young to get wet. Artificial brooding Today, hatcheries produce day-old ducklings and goslings in large numbers. Commercial growers brood and rear them in about {{the same way they}} would baby chicks. Ducks and geese are hardy and are not susceptible to many of the common poultry diseases. This makes them easy to raise. Brooding requirements are simple and special housing or equipment is not necessary. Because of their rapid growth and early feathering, they do not require as long a brooding period as do baby chicks. Types of brooders The infrared heat lamp type of <b>electric</b> <b>brooder</b> is recommended for brooding small groups of birds. Many commercial raisers use gas brooders, but any type of good baby chick brooder may be used successfully. When using infrared brooders, allow one 250 -watt lamp per 25 goslings or 30 ducklings. With other types, you can determine the number of birds per hover by cutting the brooder's rated chick capacity by half for ducklings and by one-third for goslings. Because ducklings and goslings are larger, it usually is necessary to raise the hover 3 to 4 inches higher than for chicks. Brooding temperature...|$|E
