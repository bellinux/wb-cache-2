5|$|His pale, heavy-boned face {{showed signs}} of sleeplessness. His strong body was bulging over {{the sides of the}} seat; <b>his</b> <b>legs</b> <b>were</b> spread wide over the pale, rose-colored velvet carpet. There was a little cup of black coffee, absurdly delicate, beside his gnarled work-warped hand.|$|E
5|$|Pistorius {{has been}} using the same Össur blades since 2004. He was born without fibulae and with malformed feet, and <b>his</b> <b>legs</b> <b>were</b> amputated about halfway between knee and ankle so he could wear {{prosthetic}} legs. He wears socks and pads which are visible above the sockets to reduce chafing and to prevent blisters, and the sockets have straps in the front that can be tightened to make the prosthesis fit more snugly.|$|E
5|$|Investigators {{believed}} the aircraft captain survived {{for a short}} time after the crash. His body was a short distance away from his seat and both were a few metres ahead of the wreckage where they had been thrown after the nose of the aircraft was split open in the impact with a large tree. The seat belt had not broken, but it had been undone. The captain's tunic was pulled up over his head as though to protect his face from the heat of the nearby inferno. Investigators believed he survived the crash and undid his seat belt to drag himself away from the fire. His body was not burnt, but autopsy showed both <b>his</b> <b>legs</b> <b>were</b> broken and he died from a fractured skull.|$|E

5|$|The film shows Luttrell (Wahlberg) {{being able}} to walk after the Taliban's ambush on the four-man SEAL team. In reality, Luttrell {{explained}} that <b>his</b> <b>legs</b> <b>were</b> numb immediately after the ambush, and when feeling did return to them, the pain from the shrapnel in his legs made it too painful to walk; he had to crawl seven miles looking for water and sanctuary. Luttrell {{also said that he}} did not witness the MH-47 Chinook helicopter being shot down, as seen in the film. At the end of the film, the Pashtun villagers fight off a Taliban attack in a firefight that never actually happened. In reality, the Taliban fighters were outnumbered by the villagers and had no intentions of attacking the village. They did, however, try to sneak in and capture Luttrell in secret. Luttrell also did not go into cardiac arrest after he was rescued, nor was he near death, as seen in the film.|$|E
5|$|Two months later, on August 5, 2000, at the Mohegan Sun in Connecticut, Judah {{defeated}} former IBF Light Welterweight Champion Terron Millett by fourth-round knockout. Judah {{was knocked}} {{down in the}} first round from a left hand. Judah rose quickly, and from that point on he dominated the fight. Judah hurt Millett with two combinations {{near the end of the}} first round. In round two, Judah sent Millett down with a right hand to the chin. Millett survived the round, but he was clearly hurt. In round four, Judah charged across the ring and inflicted a series of blows on Millett, knocking him down again. Millett got up, but Judah continued his assault and knocked Millett down again. Millett rose at the count of four, but <b>his</b> <b>legs</b> <b>were</b> unsteady and the referee decided to stop the bout.|$|E
5|$|The 1971–72 season brought several changes. Owner Jack Kent Cooke {{brought in}} Bill Sharman as head coach, and Elgin Baylor {{announced}} his retirement {{early in the season}} after realizing that <b>his</b> <b>legs</b> <b>were</b> not healthy enough. Sharman increased the team's discipline. He introduced the concept of the shootaround, where players would arrive at the arena early in the morning before a game to practice shots. They won 14 straight games in November and all 16 games played in December. They won three straight to open the year of 1972 but on January 9, the Milwaukee Bucks ended their winning streak by defeating the Lakers, 120–104. By winning 33 straight games, Los Angeles set a record for longest winning streak of any team in American professional sports. The Lakers won 69 games that season, which stood as the NBA record for 24 years until the Chicago Bulls won 72 games in 1995–96. Chamberlain averaged a low 14.8 points but led the league in rebounding at 19.2 a game. West's 9.7 assists per game (apg) led the league, he also averaged more than 25 points, and was named MVP of the 1972 NBA All-Star Game. The team failed to score 100 points just once all year, {{and at the end of}} the season, Bill Sharman was named Coach of the Year. The Lakers went on to reach the finals against the New York Knicks where they would avenge their 1970 finals loss by defeating them 4 games to 1. Chamberlain tallied 24 points and 29 rebounds in game five and won the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award.|$|E

25|$|Mynn {{suffered}} an ankle injury before the famous 1836 match. He batted with a runner and {{was unable to}} bowl.

Mynn's captain, Lord Frederick Beauclerk sent him back to London laid out {{on the top of a}} stagecoach.|$|E
25|$|Nithings {{were thought}} to be {{suffering}} of physical ailments and were associated with crippledness. Most notably were limping as an outer indication of being a nithing (such as in the story of Rögnvald Straightleg whose last name was in fact but an ironic offence as <b>his</b> <b>legs</b> <b>were</b> actually crippled), and the belief that sorcerers would not only give birth to animals but also to crippled human children.|$|E
25|$|Swayze {{was seriously}} injured in 1998 while filming HBO's Letters from a Killer near Ione, California, {{when he fell}} from a horse and hit a tree.

60|$|But, as I said, Mr. Badman quickly forgot all; his {{conscience}} <b>was</b> choked before <b>his</b> <b>leg</b> <b>was</b> healed. And, therefore, {{before he was}} well of the fruit of one sin, he tempts God to send another judgment to seize upon him. And so he did quickly after. For not many months after <b>his</b> <b>leg</b> <b>was</b> well, {{he had a very}} dangerous fit of sickness, insomuch that now he began to think he must die in very deed.|$|R
25|$|On April 11, {{the police}} took Serafín {{and the four}} other {{suspects}} to Santa Elena and asked Serafín to show the police where Kilroy's and others' remains were kept. That afternoon, they were forced at gunpoint to spend several hours digging up the graves. Once Kilroy's corpse had been exhumed, the police observed that <b>his</b> <b>legs</b> <b>were</b> missing; Serafín explained that the amputations were not a procedure of the ritual, but were done to simplify burial.|$|E
25|$|A nonprofessional {{performer}} named Richard Lacovara doubled for Basehart in long {{shots on}} the ledge, {{which had been}} enlarged to minimize risk of falling. Lacovara was protected by a canvas life belt hidden under his costume, connected to a lifeline, Even with the double, Basehart still had to endure over 300 hours of standing on the ledge with little movement during the 50 days of shooting in New York, {{even though he had}} a sprained ankle and <b>his</b> <b>legs</b> <b>were</b> ravaged by poison oak contracted on the grounds of his Coldwater Canyon home.|$|E
25|$|As {{the play}} began, {{everything}} appeared {{to go as}} planned. Jones ran with Wycheck up the field {{at the beginning of}} the play.

Jones switched directions and ran towards the Titans receiver. Dyson ran directly toward the end zone, but <b>his</b> <b>legs</b> <b>were</b> wrapped up by Jones with about two and a half yards left to the goal line.|$|E

25|$|Parantaka Chola II (son of Arinjaya, {{also known}} popularly as Sundara Chola {{as he was}} exotically {{handsome}} and ruled the kingdom particularly well), though later fell fatally ill as <b>his</b> <b>legs</b> <b>were</b> paralysed. He was the proud father of Rajaraja Cholan, Aditya karikala Cholan and Kundavai. Aditya II was the elder son of Parantaka II and was the heir apparent of the Chola dynasty after Paranthaka II. But before he could ascend the throne, he was taken by death due to the treachery. He is killed in kadambur Melakadambur sambuvarayar maaligai.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, a {{piece of}} acacia wood was located between the bones {{and the head of}} the nail, presumably to keep the {{condemned}} from freeing his foot by sliding it over the nail. <b>His</b> <b>legs</b> <b>were</b> found broken, possibly to hasten his death. It is thought that because in Roman times iron was rare, the nails were removed from the dead body to conserve costs. According to Haas, this could help to explain why only one nail has been found, as the tip of the nail in question was bent in such a way that it could not be removed.|$|E
25|$|Implied {{evidence}} for this comes mainly from two sources, namely, the Bible (in order to cause the victim to die faster, <b>his</b> <b>legs</b> <b>were</b> broken so they could not support his weight and he would suffocate) and iconography (all early depictions of the crucifixion show this arrangement, not the later with feet on top with single nail). It has also been pointed out by some experts that the nailed hands of a body crucified in the manner often shown in modern secular art would not support {{the weight of the}} body and would tear through. A platform for the feet would relieve this problem.|$|E
