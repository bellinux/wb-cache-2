5|$|A {{number of}} persons who {{associated}} themselves with <b>Europeans</b> <b>and</b> proved themselves useful to white people achieved positions in the native society through fraud and extortion.

5|$|While {{the first}} contact with <b>Europeans</b> <b>and</b> {{indigenous}} peoples in Canada had occurred {{a century or}} more before, {{the first group of}} permanent settlers were the French, who founded the New France settlements, in present-day Quebec and Ontario; and Acadia, in present-day Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, during {{the early part of the}} 17th century.|$|E

50|$|Finally {{in another}} study {{involving}} the North Western provinces of the country, a total of 1293 individuals from Jujuy, Salta, Tucumán, Santiago del Estero, Catamarca and La Rioja were used.

According to this study, Argentines from Jujuy were 53% Amerindian, 47% <b>European,</b> <b>and</b> 0.1% African ancestry. Argentines from Salta were 41% of Amerindian, 56% of <b>European,</b> <b>and</b> 3.1% of African ancestry.

5|$|Houphouët entered electoral {{politics}} in August 1945, when {{elections for the}} Abidjan city council were held for the first time. The French electoral rules established a common roll: half of the elected {{would have to be}} French citizens (who were mostly <b>Europeans)</b> <b>and</b> the other half non-citizens. Houphouët reacted by creating a multi-ethnic all-African roll with both non-citizens and citizens (mostly Senegalese with French citizenship). As a result, most of the African contenders withdrew and a large number of the French protested by abstaining, thus assuring a decisive victory for his African Bloc.|$|E
5|$|In September and October 1945 <b>Europeans</b> <b>and</b> pro-Dutch Eurasians were {{attacked}} {{and killed by}} Indonesian mobs. Ferocious fighting erupted when 6,000 British Indian troops landed in the city. Sukarno and Hatta negotiated a ceasefire between the Republicans and the British forces led by Brigadier Mallaby. Following the killing of Mallaby on 30 October, the British sent more troops into the city from 10 November {{under the cover of}} air attacks. Although the European forces largely captured the city in three days, the poorly armed Republicans fought on until 29 November and thousands died as the population fled to the countryside.|$|E

The earliest recorded lead production dates to 1621 in the English Colony of Virginia, fourteen years after its foundation. In Australia, the first mine opened by colonists on the continent was a lead mine, in 1841. In Africa, lead mining and smelting were known in the Benue Trough and the lower Congo Basin, where lead was used for trade with <b>Europeans,</b> <b>and</b> as a currency by the 17th century, well before the scramble for Africa.|$|E

5|$|There is {{evidence}} of hybridisation between homo sapiens and other human species of the genus Homo. In 2010, the Neanderthal genome project showed that 1–4% of DNA from all people living today, apart from most Sub-Saharan Africans, are of Neanderthal heritage. Analyzing the genomes of 600 <b>Europeans</b> <b>and</b> East Asians found that combining them covered 20% of the Neanderthal genome {{that is in the}} modern human population. Ancient human populations lived and interbred with Neanderthals, Denisovans, and at least one other extinct Homo species. Thus, Neanderthal and Denisovan DNA has been incorporated into human DNA by introgression.|$|E
5|$|With its {{increasing}} rarity, {{specimens of}} the great auk and its eggs became collectible and highly prized by rich <b>Europeans,</b> <b>and</b> {{the loss of a}} large number of its eggs to collection contributed to the demise of the species. Eggers, individuals who visited the nesting sites {{of the great}} auk to collect their eggs, quickly realized that the birds did not all lay their eggs on the same day, so they could make return visits to the same breeding colony. Eggers only collected the eggs without embryos and typically, discarded the eggs with embryos growing inside of them.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the trek}} found archaeological {{artifacts}} related to 19th-century <b>Europeans</b> <b>and</b> undisturbed disarticulated human remains, Beattie {{was disappointed that}} more remains were not found. Examining the bones of Franklin crewmen, he noted areas of pitting and scaling often found in cases of Vitamin C deficiency, the cause of scurvy. After returning to Edmonton, he compared notes from the survey with James Savelle, an Arctic archaeologist, and noticed skeletal patterns suggesting cannibalism. Seeking information about the Franklin crew's health and diet, he sent bone samples to the Alberta Soil and Feed Testing Laboratory for trace element analysis and assembled another team to visit King William Island. The analysis would find an unexpected level of 226parts per million (ppm) of lead in the crewman's bones, which was 10times higher than the control samples, taken from Inuit skeletons from the same geographic area, of 26–36ppm.|$|E

5|$|Beginning {{with small}} bands of nomadic hunter-gatherers, Native Americans have {{inhabited}} the Colorado River basin {{for at least}} 8,000 years. Between 2,000 and 1,000 years ago, the river and its tributaries fostered large agricultural civilizations – {{some of the most}} sophisticated indigenous cultures in North America – which eventually faded due to a combination of severe drought and poor land use practices. Most native peoples that inhabit the basin today are descended from other groups that settled in the region beginning about 1,000 years ago. Europeans first entered the Colorado Basin in the 16thcentury, when explorers from Spain began mapping and claiming the area, which later became part of Mexico upon its independence in 1821. Early contact between <b>Europeans</b> <b>and</b> Native Americans was generally limited to the fur trade in the headwaters and sporadic trade interactions along the lower river.|$|E
5|$|For Native Americans, Pontiac's War {{demonstrated}} {{the possibilities of}} pan-tribal cooperation in resisting Anglo-American colonial expansion. Although the conflict divided tribes and villages, the war also saw the first extensive multi-tribal resistance to European colonization in North America, {{and was the first}} war between <b>Europeans</b> <b>and</b> Native North Americans that did not end in complete defeat for the Native Americans. The Proclamation of 1763 ultimately did not prevent British colonists and land speculators from expanding westward, and so Native Americans found it necessary to form new resistance movements. Beginning with conferences hosted by Shawnees in 1767, in the following decades leaders such as Joseph Brant, Alexander McGillivray, Blue Jacket, and Tecumseh would attempt to forge confederacies that would revive the resistance efforts of Pontiac's War.|$|E
