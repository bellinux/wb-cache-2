5|$|The <b>green</b> <b>algae</b> are a {{large group}} of {{photosynthetic}} eukaryotes that include many microscopic organisms. Although some <b>green</b> <b>algae</b> are classified as protists, others such as charophyta are classified with embryophyte plants, which are the most familiar group of land plants. Algae can grow as single cells, or in long chains of cells. The <b>green</b> <b>algae</b> include unicellular and colonial flagellates, usually but not always with two flagella per cell, as well as various colonial, coccoid, and filamentous forms. In the Charales, which are the algae most closely related to higher plants, cells differentiate into several distinct tissues within the organism. There are about 6000 species of <b>green</b> <b>algae.</b>|$|E
5|$|Theodoxus fluviatilis feeds {{mainly on}} diatoms living on stones, {{scraping}} biofilms and also consuming detritus. It can also consume Cyanobacteria and <b>green</b> <b>algae</b> as a poor-quality food supply. Cyanobacteria contain toxins and indigestible mucopolysaccharides, and <b>green</b> <b>algae</b> have cellulose in their cell walls (Theodoxus species have no cellulase enzymes to digest cellulose). They also graze on zygotes and germlings of brown alga Fucus vesiculosus, when the alga is small up to 1mm. Peters and Traunspurger (2012) studied {{the effect of}} the grazing of Theodoxus fluviatilis on epilithic meiofauna and algae.|$|E
5|$|In {{a species}} of marine <b>green</b> <b>algae</b> Ulvaria obscura, a major {{component}} of some algal blooms, dopamine is present in very high concentrations, estimated at 4.4% of dry weight. There is evidence that this dopamine functions as an anti-herbivore defense, reducing consumption by snails and isopods.|$|E
25|$|Chlorarachniophyte chloroplasts are notable {{because the}} <b>green</b> <b>alga</b> they {{are derived from}} has not been {{completely}} broken down—its nucleus still persists as a nucleomorph found between {{the second and third}} chloroplast membranes—the periplastid space, which corresponds to the <b>green</b> <b>alga's</b> cytoplasm.|$|R

50|$|The fungi form lichens in a {{symbiotic}} relationship {{with one or two}} photosynthetic partners which may be a cyanobacterium such as Nostoc or a <b>green</b> <b>alga</b> such as Coccomyxa. The majority of species contain just a cyanobacterium, a smaller number have both a cyanobacterium and a <b>green</b> <b>alga</b> while only a few species have just a <b>green</b> <b>alga.</b> The thallus of the lichen may be foliose (leafy), subfruticose (somewhat shrubby) or granular-squamulose (scaly). The thallus attaches to a surface by means of small root-like rhizines. In some species, the thallus may vary in appearance depending on whether it contains a cyanobacterium or a <b>green</b> <b>alga.</b> Sometimes these different morphs of a single fungus were formerly thought to be separate species.|$|R
5|$|In nature, free oxygen is {{produced}} by the light-driven splitting of water during oxygenic photosynthesis. According to some estimates, <b>green</b> <b>algae</b> and cyanobacteria in marine environments provide about 70% of the free oxygen produced on Earth, and the rest {{is produced}} by terrestrial plants. Other estimates of the oceanic contribution to atmospheric oxygen are higher, while some estimates are lower, suggesting oceans produce ~45% of Earth's atmospheric oxygen each year.|$|E
5|$|Salinity {{differences}} between the sections of the lake separated by the railroad causeway result in significantly different biota. A phytoplankton community dominated by <b>green</b> <b>algae</b> or cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) tint the water south of the causeway a greenish color. North of the causeway, the lake is dominated by Dunaliella salina, a species of algae which releases beta-carotene, and the bacteria-like haloarchaea, which together give the water an unusual reddish or purplish color, and the bacteria converts non-toxic mercury into toxic methyl mercury, which then flows into the Southern portion of the lake in a heavy brine layer through the causeway.|$|E
5|$|The {{cells of}} most fungi grow as tubular, elongated, and thread-like (filamentous) {{structures}} called hyphae, which may contain multiple nuclei and extend by growing at their tips. Each tip contains {{a set of}} aggregated vesicles—cellular structures consisting of proteins, lipids, and other organic molecules—called the Spitzenkörper. Both fungi and oomycetes grow as filamentous hyphal cells. In contrast, similar-looking organisms, such as filamentous <b>green</b> <b>algae,</b> grow by repeated cell division within a chain of cells. There are also single-celled fungi (yeasts) that do not form hyphae, and some fungi have both hyphal and yeast forms.|$|E

5|$|The {{river is}} nutrient-poor and acidic (pH 4.33) which determines {{the type of}} plant life found there. Mosses and liverworts are the most common. Near the source {{compressed}} flapwort (Nardia compressa) and <b>green</b> <b>algae</b> are the most dominant species. Closer to the mouth water earwort (Scapania undulata), feather moss and bulbous rush (Juncus bulbosus) are also found. Holt's mouse-tail moss (Isothecium holtii) is very common on the banks; the Shimna River {{is one of only}} three known sites for this species in Northern Ireland. It is also the only known location in Northern Ireland where Portuguese feather-moss (Platyhypnidium alopecuroides) is found.|$|E
5|$|A typical {{sea anemone}} {{is a single}} polyp {{attached}} to a hard surface by its base, but some species live in soft sediment and a few float near {{the surface of the}} water. The polyp has a columnar trunk topped by an oral disc with a ring of tentacles and a central mouth. The tentacles can be retracted inside the body cavity or expanded to catch passing prey. They are armed with cnidocytes (stinging cells). In many species, additional nourishment comes from a symbiotic relationship with single-celled dinoflagellates, zooxanthellae or with <b>green</b> <b>algae,</b> zoochlorellae, that live within the cells. Some species of sea anemone live in association with hermit crabs, small fish or other animals to their mutual benefit.|$|E
5|$|Adamussium colbecki is a large, slow-growing scallop {{that lives}} on the seabed. The shell {{consists}} {{of a pair of}} ribbed calcareous valves which enclose the soft body and are joined by a ligament at a hinge. It feeds on microscopic <b>green</b> <b>algae</b> and is sometimes present in great numbers. It is able to move around by flapping its valves and to dart backwards to escape threats. The species is an important member of the Antarctic seabed community as the upper valve often acts as a substrate for seaweeds, sponges and other organisms. In addition, juveniles bind themselves by threads to the upper valve of older shells, using these as a base for several years as they grow. The adult scallops have been used in research to study the accumulation of heavy metals in marine organisms.|$|E

5|$|The Morrison Formation is {{interpreted}} as a semiarid environment with distinct wet and dry seasons, and flat floodplains. Vegetation varied from river-lining forests of conifers, tree ferns, and ferns (gallery forests), to fern savannas with occasional trees such as the Araucaria-like conifer Brachyphyllum. The flora of the period has been revealed by fossils of <b>green</b> <b>algae,</b> fungi, mosses, horsetails, ferns, cycads, ginkoes, and several families of conifers. Animal fossils discovered include bivalves, snails, ray-finned fishes, frogs, salamanders, turtles like Dorsetochelys, sphenodonts, lizards, terrestrial and aquatic crocodylomorphans like Hoplosuchus, several species of pterosaurs such as Harpactognathus and Mesadactylus, numerous dinosaur species, and early mammals such as docodonts (like Docodon), multituberculates, symmetrodonts, and triconodonts.|$|E
5|$|The smooth toadfish {{is found}} along Australia's eastern and {{southeast}} coast, from Moreton Bay in southeastern Queensland to Port Lincoln in South Australia {{as well as}} Kangaroo Island and Tasmania. It {{is one of the}} most abundant fishes in the muddy areas of Port Philip Bay. It generally lives in shallow water less than 3m (10ft) deep, often over mudflats in estuaries. In areas of seagrass beds, smooth toadfish are more commonly found in sand areas bordering on the seagrass patches. They are more commonly found in seagrass patches in water less than 1.5m (5ft) deep rather than deeper water of 3.5–6m (11–20ft). A South Australian field study on wrack and associated fauna found that the smooth toadfish was associated with larger volumes and aggregations containing <b>green</b> <b>algae.</b>|$|E
5|$|From {{about three}} billion years ago, prokaryotic selenoprotein {{families}} drive {{the evolution of}} selenocysteine, an amino acid. Selenium is incorporated into several prokaryotic selenoprotein families in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes as selenocysteine, where selenoprotein peroxiredoxins protect bacterial and eukaryotic cells against oxidative damage. Selenoprotein families of GSH-Px and the deiodinases of eukaryotic cells {{seem to have a}} bacterial phylogenetic origin. The selenocysteine-containing form occurs in species as diverse as <b>green</b> <b>algae,</b> diatoms, sea urchin, fish, and chicken. Selenium enzymes are involved in the small reducing molecules glutathione and thioredoxin. One family of selenium-bearing molecules (the glutathione peroxidases) destroys peroxide and repairs damaged peroxidized cell membranes, using glutathione. Another selenium-bearing enzyme in some plants and in animals (thioredoxin reductase) generates reduced thioredoxin, a dithiol that serves as an electron source for peroxidases and also the important reducing enzyme ribonucleotide reductase that makes DNA precursors from RNA precursors.|$|E

5|$|In {{spring and}} early summer, migrant birds {{including}} the little gull, black tern, Temminck's stint and garganey may pass through {{on their way to}} breed elsewhere. In the autumn, birds arrive from the north; some, such as whimbrels, curlew sandpipers and little stints, just pausing for a few days to refuel before continuing south, others staying for the winter. Offshore, great and Arctic skuas, northern gannets and black-legged kittiwakes may pass close by in favourable winds. Large numbers of ducks winter along the coast, including many Eurasian wigeons, Eurasian teals, mallards and gadwalls, goldeneyes and northern pintails. Red-throated divers are usually on the sea, and brent geese feed on sea lettuce and other <b>green</b> <b>algae.</b> Barn owls and sometimes hen harriers quarter the marshes in winter, and snow bunting flocks {{can be found on the}} beaches. Thousands of geese, mainly pink-footed, roost at Holkham.|$|E
5|$|Othnielosaurus {{was one of}} {{the smaller}} members of the diverse Morrison Formation dinosaur fauna, {{diminutive}} in comparison to the giant sauropods. The Morrison Formation is interpreted as a semiarid environment with distinct wet and dry seasons, and flat floodplains. Vegetation varied from river-lining gallery forests of conifers, tree ferns, and ferns, to fern savannas with rare trees. It has been a rich fossil hunting ground, holding fossils of <b>green</b> <b>algae,</b> fungi, mosses, horsetails, ferns, cycads, ginkgoes, and several families of conifers. Other fossils discovered include bivalves, snails, ray-finned fishes, frogs, salamanders, turtles, sphenodonts, lizards, terrestrial and aquatic crocodylomorphans, several species of pterosaur, numerous dinosaur species, and early mammals such as docodonts, multituberculates, symmetrodonts, and triconodonts. Such dinosaurs as the theropods Ceratosaurus, Allosaurus, Ornitholestes, and Torvosaurus, the sauropods Apatosaurus, Brachiosaurus, Camarasaurus, and Diplodocus, and the ornithischians Camptosaurus, Dryosaurus, and Stegosaurus are known from the Morrison. Othnielosaurus is present in stratigraphic zones 2-5.|$|E

Allosaurus is commonly found at the same sites as Apatosaurus, Camarasaurus, Diplodocus, and Stegosaurus. The Late Jurassic formations of Portugal where Allosaurus is present are interpreted as having been similar to the Morrison but with a stronger marine influence. Many of the dinosaurs of the Morrison Formation are the same genera as those seen in Portuguese rocks (mainly Allosaurus, Ceratosaurus, Torvosaurus, and Stegosaurus), or have a close counterpart (Brachiosaurus and Lusotitan, Camptosaurus and Draconyx).|$|E

5|$|The Morrison Formation records a {{time when}} the local {{environment}} was dominated by gigantic sauropod dinosaurs. Dinosaurs known from the Morrison Formation include the theropods Allosaurus, Ceratosaurus, Ornitholestes, Saurophaganax, and Torvosaurus; the sauropods Brontosaurus, Brachiosaurus, Camarasaurus, and Diplodocus; and the ornithischians Camptosaurus, Dryosaurus, and Stegosaurus. Apatosaurus is commonly found at the same sites as Allosaurus, Camarasaurus, Diplodocus, and Stegosaurus. Allosaurus accounted for 70–75% of theropod specimens and was at the top trophic level of the Morrison food web.
