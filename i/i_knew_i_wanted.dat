5|$|In Falls the Shadow (1988) Penman {{chronicles the}} family {{relationships}} of King Henry III and his brother-in-law Simon de Montfort. Falls the Shadow is a bridge novel as Penman uses the Simon de Montfort rebellion to lead {{her to the}} conclusion of the trilogy in The Reckoning. As Penman explains: '“After I’d finished Here Be Dragons, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to continue the story… At first I’d planned to write one book in which Simon de Montfort would share top billing with Llewelyn Fawr’s grandson, Llewelyn ap Gruffydd, who later wed Simon’s daughter. I soon realized, though, that this was too much to tackle in one book, that Simon and Llewelyn each deserved his own novel. So I decided to devote Falls the Shadow to Simon and The Reckoning to Llewelyn".|$|E

A Simple Plan marked the second on-screen collaboration between Paxton and Thornton after One False Move (1992). Thornton recalled, [...] "I {{got a call from}} one of my agents who said, 'John Boorman wants you to do a script that I sent you a year ago and you never read,' I said, 'Send it to me again, and this time I'll really read it.'

500|$|Nine Inch Nails' {{earliest}} influences include Ministry and Skinny Puppy, {{which helped}} shape what became 1989's Pretty Hate Machine. The album's liner notes also {{paid tribute to}} the hip-hop group Public Enemy and Prince. Another large influence on the band's sound is Gary Numan, which is evident as Reznor once said that [...] "after hearing 'Cars' <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to make music with synthesizers". The 2005 single [...] "Only" [...] exemplifies the disco-style beats and synthesizers drawn from Numan's persuasion. Other artists of significance to Nine Inch Nails encompass late 70s and 80s acts such as Queen, Devo, Joy Division, Adam Ant, and Soft Cell.|$|E

500|$|Jones became {{interested}} in programming in high school, and learned Applesoft BASIC and 6502 Assembly on an Apple II series computer. When Apple released its Macintosh line, Jones's family purchased a Macintosh 128K, but Jones never programmed much for it. After high school Jones got a job programming for a computer-aided design company on PCs, before going to college the next year. In his off time Jones said that all he ever did on the Apple II was write games, [...] "and it seemed logical to continue that on the Mac," [...] he said. [...] "The first thing I did on the Mac was to port a modem game I'd written called Minotaur from 6502 Assembly on the Apple II into MPW C on the Mac. I was still finishing that when I came to college. By that time, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to write games." ...|$|E

She said that [...] "I knew I {{wanted it to be}} sexy, so I thought no pants, because that's sexy, And <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> it to be futuristic, so I thought shoulder pads, because that's my thing." [...] The music video premiered on MTV UK on February 17, 2009. In some versions of the song, the words [...] "muffin" [...] (being a slang term for the woman's vagina), [...] "Russian Roulette" [...] and [...] "gun" [...] are censored out (bleeped). On June 21, 2009, the video won the Best International Artist Video at the 2009 MuchMusic Video Awards. The video received four nominations at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, in the categories of Video of the Year, Best New Artist, Best Female Video and Best Pop Video. Along with five other nominations for [...] "Paparazzi", Gaga was tied with Beyoncé for most nominations each for that year.|$|E

Turlington said of the album: I went to friends first, as I did with the first CD. Bono and Chris Martin were great supporters of the project the first time around, and when <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to include men on this album they were obvious choices. They are also both fathers to daughters. Others, such as Patti Smith and Rita Wilson, I've {{known for a long}} time, and some, like Edie Brickell and Paul Simon, I only met briefly but was a huge admirer. I generally wanted a diverse group of artists who were parents, {{or in the case of}} Edward Sharpe, who will be soon.

500|$|Sotomayor {{had wanted}} to become a judge since she was in {{elementary}} school, and in 1991 she was recommended for a spot by Democratic New York senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan. Moynihan had an unusual bipartisan arrangement with his fellow New York senator, Republican Al D'Amato, whereby he would get to choose roughly {{one out of every four}} New York district court seats even though a Republican was in the White House. Moynihan also wanted to fulfill a public promise he had made to get a Hispanic judge appointed for New York. When Moynihan's staff recommended her to him, they said [...] "Have we got a judge for you!" [...] Moynihan identified with her socio-economic and academic background and became convinced she would become the first Hispanic Supreme Court justice. D'Amato became an enthusiastic backer of Sotomayor, who was seen as politically centrist at the time. Of the impending drop in salary from private practice, Sotomayor said: [...] "I've never wanted to get adjusted to my income because <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to go back to public service. And in comparison to what my mother earns and how I was raised, it's not modest at all." ...|$|E
500|$|After meeting George Lamb on {{a holiday}} in Ibiza, Allen made him her manager. Lamb later {{introduced}} the singer to production duo Future Cut, {{with whom she}} had written and produced demos, which were sent to various labels. In 2005, Allen was signed to Regal Records, who gave her £25,000 to produce an album. The singer considered it to be a [...] "small development idea", as they were also unable to provide much support for it due to their preoccupation with other releases. Taking advice from Lady Sovereign, the singer created an account on MySpace and began posting demo songs in November 2005. By March 2006, they attracted thousands of listeners, and 500 limited edition 7" [...] vinyl singles of one of the demos, a song titled [...] "LDN", were rush-released and sold for as much as £40. Allen also produced two mixtapes to promote her work. As she accumulated tens of thousands of MySpace friends, The Observer Music Monthly took interest. Few people outside of her label's A department had heard of Allen, so the label was slow in responding to publications who wanted to report about her. Her label wasn't pleased with the sound of the demos, so they assigned the singer to [...] "more mainstream producers and top-line writers". After that, they finally approved some of her songs, being confident of their inclusion on the album. [...] "Smile" [...] was among the chosen ones, that Allen claimed she was happy with. It was the first song she had ever written, claiming:When I set out to do this <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to make songs that sounded a) up to date and now and b) really organic. Because you can't get really good players without spending loads of money these days, the only other option is to sample. The first song I ever wrote was 'Smile'. We just went through about seven or eight sample lyrics, found a beat, put it all in... Then when it comes to writing lyrics I write... like a rapper would, I suppose, with absolutely no melody involved whatsoever, I'm just getting my flow sorted. Then I write the whole text of the song and then ad lib the melody into the microphone. It's not terribly clever! ...|$|E

She has explained that fellow musical theatre actress Ruthie Henshall inspired her growing up: [...] " [...] was a success story from Suffolk … I think I identified with her because it was an actual story that I saw happen and was achievable.

2500|$|Sigler calls Stephen King a [...] "'master craftsman', {{who writes}} from the 'regular guy' strata {{from which he}} hails. His older stuff had no pretense, no 'higher message,' no 'I’m {{extremely}} important' attitude, just rock-solid storytelling and character development. He also would whack any character at any time, and that’s what hooked you in – when characters got into trouble, you didn’t know if they’d live, unlike 99% of the books {{out there that are}} trying to develop franchise characters." [...] According to Sigler, Jack London's [...] "The Sea Wolf totally changed my views on life". Sigler saw King Kong (1976 version) {{when he was a little}} kid.

2500|$|Gonet is an {{established}} actress in British television, {{known for her}} role in the 1990s BBC series The House of Eliott. Her casting as Jayne follows a trend of Holby City producers towards hiring established British actors - with Gonet joining a series 9 cast alongside former film actress Patsy Kensit as Ward Sister Faye Morton, comedian Adrian Edmondson as Consultant Surgeon Abra Durant and Jesus of Nazareth star Robert Powell as Nursing Consultant Mark Williams. Series creator Mal Young commented on the preference for established names when discussing Holby Citys inception, explaining: [...] "Soap actors are the best actors. There’s been so much snobbery before. The whole thing about typecasting was probably invented by actors who couldn’t get other work. From day one <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to put on screen people that viewers want to watch. There’s no downside to that." [...] Series producer Diana Kyle also addressed this trend in November 2007, when asked: [...] "When you cast an actor, do you actively seek out well-known names - like Jane Asher (Lady Byrne) and Patsy Kensit (Faye) - or will a role simply go to whoever's better suited?". She responded to this question: [...] "It's lovely when we have a new member of the cast come in and bring an audience with them. But we want the best actors, and the star names we cast are always the best - which is why we go for them!" ...|$|E

But <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to write for the theatre, so I wanted someone who did not disdain theatre music." [...] Barrow suggested that Sondheim study with Milton Babbitt, who Sondheim described as [...] "a frustrated show composer" [...] with whom he formed [...] "a perfect combination." [...] When he met Babbitt, {{he was working on}} a musical for Mary Martin based on the myth of Helen of Troy. Sondheim and Babbitt would meet once a week in New York City for four hours (at the time, Babbitt was teaching at Princeton University). According to Sondheim, they spent the first hour dissecting Rodgers and Hart or George Gershwin or studying Babbitt's favorites (Buddy DeSylva, Lew Brown and Ray Henderson). They then proceeded to other forms of music (such as Mozart's Jupiter Symphony), critiquing them the same way. Babbitt and Sondheim, fascinated by mathematics, studied songs by a variety of composers (especially Jerome Kern). Sondheim told Secrest that Kern had the ability [...] "to develop a single motif through tiny variations into a long and never boring line and his maximum development of the minimum of material". He said about Babbitt, [...] "I am his maverick, his one student who went into the popular arts with all his serious artillery". At Williams, Sondheim wrote a musical adaption of Beggar on Horseback (a 1924 play by George S. Kaufman and Marc Connelly, with permission from Kaufman) which had three performances. A member of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity, he graduated magna cum laude in 1950.|$|E
