40|$|General anesthetics abolish {{behavioral}} responsiveness in all animals, and {{in humans}} this {{is accompanied by}} loss of consciousness. Whether similar target mechanisms and behavioral endpoints exist across species remains controversial, although model organisms have been successfully used to study mechanisms of anesthesia. In Drosophila, {{a number of key}} mutants have been characterized as hypersensitive or resistant to general anesthetics by behavioral assays. In order to investigate general anesthesia in the Drosophila brain, local field potential (LFP) recordings were made during <b>incremental</b> <b>exposures</b> to isoflurane in wild-type and mutant flies. As in higher animals, general anesthesia in flies was found to involve a succession of distinct endpoints. At low doses, isoflurane uncoupled brain activity from ongoing movement, followed by a sudden attenuation in neural correlates of perception. Average LFP activity in the brain was more gradually attenuated with higher doses, followed by loss of movement behavior. Among mutants, a strong correspondence was found between behavioral and LFP sensitivities, thereby suggesting that LFP phenotypes are proximal to the anesthetic 2 ̆ 7 s mechanism of action. Finally, genetic and pharmacological analysis revealed that anesthetic sensitivities in the fly brain are, like other arousal states, influenced by dopaminergic activity. These results suggest that volatile anesthetics such as isoflurane may target the same processes that sustain wakefulness and attention in the brain.

5000|$|In 1989, the US Army {{released}} a report detailing {{the results of a}} study examining simulator sickness in UH-60 Blackhawk flight simulators, confirming the above hypothesis. [...] The report also found that longer periods between sessions of flight simulation training resulted in greater probability of detrimental symptoms appearing increased.Research suggests that this is the body's natural way of adjusting to these systems. The bodies of experienced pilots have adapted to different types of motion experienced during actual flight conditions. When placed into a flight simulator, visual and other stimuli cause their bodies to expect the same motions associated with actual flight conditions. But their bodies instead experience the imperfect motion of the simulator, resulting in sickness.A similar situation can arise for pilots who have long gaps between simulator uses. During simulation training, the body will eventually adapt to the environment to diminish the effects of simulator sickness. However, when long periods of time are spent outside of the simulator, the body is not able to adequately adapt and symptoms will reappear.Often, adaptation is the single most effective solution to simulator sickness. For most individuals, adaptation can occur within only a few sessions, with only a minority of individuals (3-5 percent) never being able to adapt. This adaptation occurs within the psyche of the individual with repeated, controlled exposures, without any required alteration to the simulator. Through <b>incremental</b> <b>exposures,</b> dispersed regularly over a series of days, adaptation can occur faster than that of an abrupt all-encompassing exposure. However, following adaptation to the novel simulator motion environment, simulator sickness symptoms can reoccur with a return to the former environment. For this reason, simulator sickness is commonly referred to as a phenomenon of maladaptation sickness, due to incessant conflict between current and past environmental conditions. [...] In flight training, this phenomenon can be a safety concern where it may lead to motion sickness hindering pilot performance in the real aircraft following flight simulator training.|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn 2013, we {{proposed}} a novel bottom-up approach to bounding low-dose cancer risks that may result from small exogenous exposures to chemicals that are always present in the body {{as a result of}} normal biological processes. The approach utilizes the background cancer risk and the background (endogenous) concentration of a cancer-related exposure biomarker in specific target tissues. After allowing for statistical uncertainty in these two parameters, the ratio of the background risk to background exposure provides a conservative slope factor estimate that can be utilized to bound the added risk that may be associated with <b>incremental</b> exogenous <b>exposures.</b> Our original bottom-up estimates were markedly smaller than those obtained previously by the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) with a conventional top-down approach to modeling nasopharyngeal cancer and leukemia mortality data from a US worker cohort. Herein we provide updated bottom-up estimates of risk for these two cancers that are smaller still, and rely upon more robust estimates of endogenous and exogenous formaldehyde-DNA adducts in monkeys and a more robust estimate of the DNA adduct elimination half-life in rats, both obtained very recently. We also re-examine the worker mortality data used by USEPA in developing its estimate of human leukemia incidence from lifetime exposure to 1  ppm airborne formaldehyde. Finally, we compare a new bottom-up slope estimate of the risk of rat nasal cancer with conventional top-down estimates obtained with empirical dose-response modeling of rat nasal cancer bioassay data...|$|R
40|$|A {{recent study}} {{performed}} for the Aerocapture Technology Area in the In-Space Propulsion Technology Projects Office at the Marshall Space Flight Center investigated {{the relative risk}} of various capture techniques for Mars missions. Aerocapture has been proposed as a possible capture technique for future Mars missions but has been perceived {{by many in the}} community as a higher risk option as compared to aerobraking and propulsive capture. By performing a probabilistic risk assessment on aerocapture, aerobraking and propulsive capture, a comparison was made to uncover the projected relative risks of these three maneuvers. For mission planners, this knowledge will allow them to decide if the mass savings provided by aerocapture warrant any <b>incremental</b> risk <b>exposure.</b> The study focuses on a Mars Sample Return mission currently under investigation at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). In each case (propulsive, aerobraking and aerocapture), the Earth return vehicle is inserted into Martian orbit by one of the three techniques being investigated. A baseline spacecraft was established through initial sizing exercises performed by JPL's Team X. While Team X design results provided the baseline and common thread between the spacecraft, in each case the Team X results were supplemented by historical data as needed. Propulsion, thermal protection, guidance, navigation and control, software, solar arrays, navigation and targeting and atmospheric prediction were investigated. A qualitative assessment of human reliability was also included. Results show that different risk drivers contribute significantly to each capture technique. For aerocapture, the significant drivers include propulsion system failures and atmospheric prediction errors. Software and guidance hardware contribute the most to aerobraking risk. Propulsive capture risk is mainly driven by anomalous solar array degradation and propulsion system failures. While each subsystem contributes differently to the risk of each technique, results show that there exists little relative difference in the reliability of these capture techniques although uncertainty for the aerocapture estimates remains high given the lack of in-space demonstration...|$|R
40|$|The use of <b>incremental</b> and {{repeated}} <b>exposures</b> regimens {{have been put}} forth as effective means to mitigating visually induced motion sickness based on the Dual Process Theory (DPT) (Groves & Thompson, 1970) of neural plasticity. In essence, DPT suggests that by incrementing stimulus intensity the depression opponent process should exert greater control over the net outcome (e. g. motion sickness) than the sensitization opponent process, thereby minimizing side effects. This conceptual model was tested by empirically validating the effectiveness of adaptation, incremental adaptation, habituation, and incremental habituation regimens to mitigate side effects arising from exposure to an optokinetic drum. Forty college students from the University of Central Florida participated in the experiment and {{were randomly assigned to}} a treatment with efforts taken to balance for gender and motion sickness susceptibility.

Furthermore, application of the Motion History Questionnaire (MHQ) (Graybiel & Kennedy, 1965) to identify high and low motion sickness susceptible individuals proved effective.

40|$|SummaryObjectiveThe {{symptomatic}} treatment of osteoarthritis (OA) {{remains to be}} improved, as many patients do not respond well to current palliative therapies and/or suffer unacceptable adverse events. Given the unmet need for innovative, effective and well-tolerated therapies, {{it is important to}} develop the means to estimate the ongoing safety profile of novel therapeutic agents over short- and longer term use. DesignMethods are presented to estimate the number of serious adverse events (SAEs) of interest considered as “acceptable” per 1000 patient-years exposure and to estimate the numbers of patient-years needed in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to meet objectives. As exposure is increased, more evidence is accrued that the overall risk is within study limits. It is equally important that requirements for delineating the safety of promising new therapies not create barriers that would preclude their development. Therefore, ongoing surveillance of occurrence of SAEs of interest during clinical development is proposed, for example after every <b>incremental</b> 500 patient-years <b>exposure</b> are accrued.

The military represents {{a segment of the}} young working population that faces unique hazards that may be worsened by previous adverse life experiences. To date, no comprehensive studies of childhood adversity have been conducted with military samples that have included combat troops before and after a combat deployment. Methods Surveys were administered in 2003 to 4529 male soldiers who had not deployed to Iraq, and in 2004 to a separate group of 2392 male soldiers 3 months after returning from Iraq. The main predictor was adverse childhood experiences, an aggregated construct representing <b>incremental</b> <b>exposure</b> to six types of traumatic childhood experiences. This construct correlated with depression and post-traumatic stress disorder rates, as well as symptom scores. For the post-Iraq sample, analyses were conducted to assess whether individuals with childhood trauma were affected differently by exposure to combat. Results The likelihood of screening positive for depression and post-traumatic stress disorder was significantly higher for individuals reporting exposure to two or more categories of childhood adversity. Core analyses showed that adverse childhood experiences were a significant predictor of mental health symptoms, beyond the expected contribution of combat. Conclusions This study confirms the high prevalence of adverse childhood experiences and the association of these experiences with key mental health outcomes.

The effect of PM 10 - 2. 5 remained positive after adjustment for the effects of the gaseous pollutants carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), sulfur dioxide (SO 2), and ozone (O 3). We did not find significant effects of fine particulate matter (PM 2. 5) or of thoracic particulate matter (PM 10) on asthma hospitalizations using either of these two analytic approaches. For the most part, relative risk estimates from the unidirectional case-crossover analysis were more pronounced compared with both bidirectional case-crossover and time-series analyses...|$|E
40|$|The {{corrosion}} behaviour of zirconium based alloys {{has been}} primarily investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). In-situ autoclave EIS experiments were performed in simulated primary coolant conditions {{in order to}} study the high temperature water corrosion of zirconium alloys in PWRs. In-situ impedance response of the corroding material was recorded throughout first kinetic transition. A physical model of the zirconium oxide was proposed {{in accordance with the}} microstructural observation' made by SEM analysis. Electrical properties of the oxide was evaluated with equivalent circuit model (ECM) which was constructed according to the physical oxide model. Evolution of various oxide parameters obtained from ECM was analysed in accordance with the microstructure observation made by SEM. A two layer structure consists of a outer porous oxide and an inner barrier oxide, was found to be the most accurate description for the autoclave formed oxide. Supporting evidence from the SEM cross-section and surface analysis of the oxide had shown cracks and pores that were linked and connected with the environment. This observation is also confirmed by the in-situ EIS measurement which has shown porous electrode behaviour throughout the course of oxidation. The porous oxide behaviour was also confirmed by the ex-situ soaking experiment on samples with <b>incremental</b> <b>exposure</b> time. Evolution of inner barrier layer oxide thickness was found to be correlated with kinetic transition which was determined from weight gain measurement. This indicated that barrier layer maybe the oxidation rate controlling layer and its thickness maybe reduced during transition. Thus, a thinner barrier layer would resulted in a rapid corrosion of zirconium alloys. Furthermore, maintaining the barrier layer thickness maybe the possible route to improve zirconium alloy corrosion resistance. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{physiological}} responses to hypoxaemia and cellular hypoxia are poorly understood, and inter-individual differences in performance at altitude and outcome in critical illness remain unexplained. We propose {{a model for}} exploring adaptation to hypoxia in the critically ill: the study of healthy humans, progressively exposed to environmental hypobaric hypoxia (EHH). The {{aim of this study}} was to describe the spectrum of adaptive responses in humans exposed to graded EHH and identify factors (physiological and genetic) associated with inter-individual variation in these responses. Methods Design Observational cohort study of progressive <b>incremental</b> <b>exposure</b> to EHH. Setting University human physiology laboratory in London, UK (75 m) and 7 field laboratories in Nepal at 1300 m, 3500 m, 4250 m, 5300 m, 6400 m, 7950 m and 8400 m. Participants 198 healthy volunteers and 24 investigators trekking to Everest Base Camp (EBC) (5300 m). A subgroup of 14 investigators studied at altitudes up to 8400 m on Everest. Main outcome measures Exercise capacity, exercise efficiency and economy, brain and muscle Near Infrared Spectroscopy, plasma biomarkers (including markers of inflammation), allele frequencies of known or suspected hypoxia responsive genes, spirometry, neurocognitive testing, retinal imaging, pupilometry. In nested subgroups: microcirculatory imaging, muscle biopsies with proteomic and transcriptomic tissue analysis, continuous cardiac output measurement, arterial blood gas measurement, trans-cranial Doppler, gastrointestinal tonometry, thromboelastography and ocular saccadometry. Results Of 198 healthy volunteers leaving Kathmandu, 190 reached EBC (5300 m). All 24 investigators reached EBC. The completion rate for planned testing was more than 99 % in the investigator group and more than 95 % in the trekkers. Unique measurements were safely performed at extreme altitude, including the highest (altitude) field measurements of exercise capacity, cerebral blood flow velocity and microvascular blood flow at 7950 m and arterial blood gas measurement at 8400 m. Conclusions This study demonstrates the feasibility and safety of conducting a large healthy volunteer cohort study of human adaptation to hypoxia in this difficult environment. Systematic measurements of a large set of variables were achieved in 222 subjects and at altitudes up to 8400 m. The resulting dataset is a unique resource for the study of genotype:phenotype interactions in relation to hypoxic adaptation. </p...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Running is {{a typical}} goal after {{anterior}} cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). Return to running (RTR) protocols are intended to provide a safe, <b>incremental</b> <b>exposure</b> to mechanical loads associated with running but none have been evaluated using existing injury prediction thresholds. Additionally, the influence of daily physical activity (PA) level and adherence to RTR protocol guidelines on predicted injury risk is unknown. Objectives: The {{purpose of this study}} was to estimate patellofemoral joint (PFJ), tibiofemoral joint (TFJ), and Achilles tendon (AT) injury risk associated with participation in three different RTR protocols as a function of overall daily PA level and protocol adherence. Methods: Average PFJ, TFJ, and AT force impulse/step during walking and running among 38 people with a history of ACLR were used to estimate cumulative impulse data at each site for each day for three RTR protocols. These RTR protocol impulse estimates were summed with the cumulative impulse at each site at progressively greater daily PA levels and input into two published injury prediction equations, the acute:chronic workload ratio (AC ratio) and percent change in daily load. A clinical scenario of nonadherence was evaluated by one week of no running followed by one week of doubling the mileage required in the protocol. Results: Assuming adherence, the AC ratio was below predicted injury risk thresholds at all sites, regardless of PA level (Figure 1 A). However, the percent change injury model predicted increased PFJ injury risk when daily PA levels were less than 3, 400 steps/day (Figure 1 B). The RTR nonadherence model resulted in an AC ratio exceeding injury risk thresholds with PA levels below 2, 300, 2, 700, and 7, 700 steps/day for the AT, TFJ, and PFJ, respectively, while the percent change model predicted increased injury risk at all sites regardless of PA level. The PFJ was at greatest risk for injury in each RTR protocol, regardless of adherence or daily PA level. Conclusions: The results of this study provide a basis for PA and protocol adherence recommendations and insight to the etiology of injuries associated with RTR after ACLR...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} mainly {{deals with}} some biochemical aspects regarding {{the efficacy of}} novel platinum anticancer compounds, {{as part of a}} broader study in which both chemistry and biochemistry are involved. Various novel diamine and N-S donor chelate compounds of platinum II and IV have been developed in which factors such as stereochemistry, ligand exchange rate and biocompatibility were considered as additional parameters. In the first order testing, each of these compounds was tested with reference to their “killing” potential by comparing their rate of killing, over a period of 48 hours with those of cisplatin and oxaliplatin. Some 80 compounds were tested in this way. Although only a few could be regarded as equal to or even better than cisplatin and oxaliplatin, the testing of these compounds on cancer cells provided useful knowledge for the further development of novel compounds. Four of the better compounds, namely Y 9, Y 14, Y 16 and Lt 16. 2 were selected for further studies to obtain more detailed knowledge of their anticancer action, including some flow cytometric studies. In addition to the above, cisplatin resistant cells were produced for each of the three different cell lines tested, namely, HeLa, HT 29 and MCF 7 cancer cell lines, by intermittent and <b>incremental</b> <b>exposure</b> to cisplatin (all the cell lines tested became resistant to cisplatin). Each of the selected compounds were exposed to the cells in the same manner, in order to attempt the induction of resistance against these compounds in the three cell lines tested (i. e. whether these cells will become resistant to the various compounds). Each of these selected platinum containing compounds were subsequently tested against the “cisplatin resistant” cell lines in order to determine their efficacy against such cells. One such compound could be singled out, since cervical cancer cells (HeLa cells) do not become resistant to it. This behaviour is similar to that of oxaliplatin against cervical cancer and colon cancer (HT 29) cells (oxaliplatin is the number one treatment for colon cancer at present). This compound also proved to be more active against cisplatin resistant cell lines. It was found that all the compounds induced apoptosis in the cell lines tested as well as inhibit the DNA cycle at one or more phase. Finally, an effort was made to evaluate the different compounds by comparing them with respect to their properties relating to anticancer action...|$|E
