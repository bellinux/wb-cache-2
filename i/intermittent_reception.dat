5000|$|The system {{experienced}} <b>intermittent</b> <b>reception</b> among field {{units and}} at the dispatch console. In one instance, the report describes an officer {{at the scene of}} a call. A dispatcher makes an announcement: the officer's hand-held radio hears the call while the vehicle radio does not. It also cites an event where two officers were in a [...] "potentially-deadly" [...] situation and had to shout to one another because their radios could not communicate. Because calls to dispatch were sometimes not heard, there was friction between officers and dispatchers: officers thought the dispatcher was ignoring their call.|$|E
50|$|Two B-17's were {{fit with}} the {{receivers}} and the first five test drops were carried out in July 1943 at Eglin Field in Florida. Further testing was carried out at the Tonopah Test Range and was increasingly successful. By 1944 the system was considered developed enough to attempt combat testing, and the two launch aircraft and {{a small number of}} GB-4 bombs were sent to England in June. These launches did not go well, with the cameras generally not working at all, failing just after launch, or offering <b>intermittent</b> <b>reception</b> that generally resulted in the images becoming visible only after the bomb had passed its target. After a series of failed launches the team returned home, having lost one of the launch aircraft in a landing accident.|$|E
5000|$|The station's main BBC National DAB {{transmitter}} {{is located}} in Quarndon, {{on the outskirts of}} Derby. A second transmitter, located in Lichfield, began operating {{in the early hours of}} 19 November 2014, in order to provide DAB coverage to the South Derbyshire and East Staffordshire areas. The third transmitter, located in North Derbyshire alongside the existing 95.3 FM transmitter at Stanton Moor, commenced operation in December of the same year. In addition, Digital One have a transmitter in Chesterfield. Services over most of the area come from the nearest BBC DAB transmitters at Sutton Coldfield and Waltham, plus Holme Moss in the north. North East Derbyshire and Chesterfield listeners can pick up <b>intermittent</b> <b>reception</b> of Yorkshire-based local and regional DAB services from a transmitter in Sheffield (Tapton Hill). A local Derbyshire DAB licence was advertised by OFCOM in January 2007, and has been awarded to [...] "Now Digital" [...] (with this Multiplex being known as NOW Derbyshire), with an [...] "on air" [...] date originally planned for July 2008, however this was delayed until July 2014. In addition to commercial services, BBC Radio Derby will be transmitted on the multiplex from five transmitter sites of Chesterfield, Drum Hill, Tibshelf, Stanton Moor, and Lichfield. There are also long term plans for further transmitters at Buxton, Ashbourne, and Glossop.|$|E
40|$|In a GSM network {{coverage}} area there exist locations where network signal reception is always either unsteady or blank. These problems are {{the cause of}} <b>intermittent</b> call <b>receptions</b> or no network reception at some locations in cell sites. This paper discusses a practical work carried out in a cell site located in a remote area in Eastern Nigeria to determine such locations. To do that, received signal field strength measurements were initially conducted at 3 m interval starting from 100 m away from the base Station to determine the suspected locations of unsteady and blank network receptions in the field. Further extensive measurements were then taken {{at each of the}} suspect locations. Analyses of the data obtained shows that a lot of such phenomenon may exist in cell sites...|$|R
40|$|This {{chapter is}} {{dedicated}} to the application of cooperative relaying in heterogeneous land mobile satellite (LMS) systems. Vehicular terminals are considered. We focus on a Urban scenario, an environment characterized by <b>intermittent</b> satellite <b>reception</b> due to the shadowing effect of surrounding buildings. We study benefits and limits of the cooperative approach adopting a network model that {{is at the same time}} tractable and of practical interest. We derive an analytical lower bound on the coverage and show that there is a trade-off between this and the rate at which the information can be injected in the network. We also describe a possible implementation scheme for cooperative coverage extension in heterogeneous satellite LMS systems adopting the ETSI Digital Video Broadcasting—Satellite services to Handheld (DVB-SH) standard in the space segment...|$|R
40|$|This article {{describes}} the principles used to generate global gap-free Leaf Area Index (LAI) time series from 2002 – 2012, based on MERIS (MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer) full-resolution Level 1 B data. It is produced {{as a series of}} 10 -day composites in geographic projection at 300 -m spatial resolution. The processing chain comprises geometric correction, radiometric correction, pixel identification, LAI calculation with the BEAM (Basic ERS & Envisat (A) ATSR and MERIS Toolbox) MERIS vegetation processor, re-projection to a global grid and temporal aggregation selecting the measurement closest to the mean value. After the LAI pre-processing, we applied time series analysis to fill data gaps and to filter outliers using the technique of harmonic analysis (HA) in combination with mean annual and multiannual phenological data. Data gaps are caused by clouds, sensor limitations due to the solar zenith angle (< 10 _), topography and <b>intermittent</b> data <b>reception.</b> We applied our technique for the whole period of observation (July 2002 –March 2012). Validation, carried out with VALERI (Validation of Land European Remote Sensing Instruments) and BigFoot data, revealed a high degree (R 2 : 0. 88) of agreement on a global scale...|$|R
40|$|Many {{possible}} Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) missions {{require a}} high degree of navigutional accuracy. The Global Positioning System (GPS) is capable of providing this accuracy. However, <b>intermittent</b> <b>reception</b> caused by either wave action or deliberate submergence will cause the loss of GPS position fix information for periods extending from several seconds to minutes. The SANS system is designed to demonstrate the feasibility of using a low-cost strapped-clown Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) to navigate between GPS fixes. It is anticipated that navigational accuracy comparable to GPS is possible between fixes. This research {{was supported in part by}} the National Science Foundation under Grant BCS- 9306252 to the Naval Postgraduate School...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we use a}} location-based {{model to}} predict the {{performance}} of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) over a varying wireless channel between a UAV and ground nodes. As a UAV traverses its flight path, the wireless channel may experience periods of significant packet loss, successful packet delivery, and <b>intermittent</b> <b>reception.</b> By capturing packet run-length and gap-length statistics at various locations on the flight path, the model can predict TCP throughput in spite of dynamically changing channel characteristics. We train the model by using packet traces obtained from flight tests in the field and validate it by comparing TCP throughput distributions for model-generated traces against those for actual traces randomly sampled from field data. 1...|$|E

40|$|The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a {{constellation}} of satellites that broadcast signals {{that can be used}} to derive precise timing, location, and velocity information. The derived information (time, position, and velocity) may be combined with other systems such as communications devices, computers, and software to perform a variety of tasks. The Global Positioning System (GPS) is capable of providing all range positioning accuracy in all situations where uninterrupted signal reception is possible and the general satellite geometry is within acceptable limits. It is also evident that other navigation technologies, such as Inertial Navigation Systems (INS), are currently not capable of providing similar accuracies at a comparable price, i. e. there is no real competition to GPS in a scenario of uninterrupted signal reception. This leaves two scenarios to be considered. The first one is that of <b>intermittent</b> signal <b>reception,</b> as for instance in heavily forested areas or in urban centres. The other one is that of no signal reception at all, as for instance in buildings, underground or underwater. In the first case, GPS has to be integrated with other sensors to bridge periods of no signa...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: MIMO for {{wireless}} communication is an antenna based technology where multiple antennas {{at each end}} are used to minimize the errors, optimize speed and data integrity also it meant for improvement of the efficiency and reliability of a system. Conventional technology which use single antenna at both source and destination results in problems such as fading, cut-off, <b>intermittent</b> <b>reception.</b> To extend coverage area, data rate, quality of service etc. several systems have been come up with goal of low complexity and having high gain.
