5|$|Interested {{in using}} sources other than archaeology, Grinsell {{made use of}} documents, place-names, folklore, and the {{accounts}} of antiquarians {{as part of his}} research. According to later archaeologists Amy Gazin-Schwartz and Cornelius Holtfdorf, Grinsell {{was one of the few}} archaeologists of his <b>generation</b> <b>who</b> was interested in the relationship between folklore and archaeology, comparing him in this way to continental European scholars Paul Saintyves, Horst Ohlhaver, and Karel C. Peeters.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1877, PedroII paid a {{visit to}} Caxias and ascertained that he could no longer remain in office. The entire cabinet {{resigned}} on 1 January 1878. His health problems had become so troubling that he had been asking repeatedly to resign since early 1876. Caxias was not only afflicted by concerns over his declining health, but increasingly felt a sense of alienation. He did not feel he could play a relevant role in politics. He belonged to an older <b>generation</b> <b>who</b> perceived the Emperor (and consequently, the monarchy) as essential for holding the nation together.|$|E
5|$|From {{the early}} repatriations, {{returned}} prisoners were generally treated with pity, suspicion and disdain by French civilians. Many {{believed that they}} had only been allowed to return in exchange for agreeing to collaborate. Later Vichy propaganda had implied that prisoners lived in good conditions, so many civilians believed that the prisoners had suffered much less than civilians during the conflict. As veterans of the 1940 Battle of France, the prisoners were blamed for the French defeat and portrayed as cowards who had surrendered, rather than fight to the death. They were also unfavourably compared with other men of their <b>generation</b> <b>who</b> {{had served in the}} Free French Forces or Resistance.|$|E
50|$|Southerners {{switched}} to the Republican Party for non-racial reasons as well, such as the increasingly liberal comprehensive positions of the national Democratic Party. In addition, the younger <b>generations,</b> <b>who</b> were politically conservative but wealthier and less attached to the Democratic Party, replaced the older <b>generations</b> <b>who</b> were still loyal to the party. The shift to the Republican Party took place slowly and gradually over almost a century.|$|R

5|$|In the 1990s, however, {{there was}} a {{resurgence}} of interest in World War I memorials. This was driven partially by a sequence of academic works on {{the social and cultural}} character of the conflict, aided by a sequence of artistic exhibits of some of more famous designers in the 1980s, and partially by generational change in many countries. As the <b>generation</b> <b>who</b> had lived and fought during the war died off, explaining the context of the memorials became more important. In France, veteran groups had begun to build memorial museums alongside the major monuments and battlefields from the late 1930s onwards.|$|E
5|$|Keynes's {{optimism}} {{was also}} cultural, in two senses: {{he was of}} the last generation raised by an empire still {{at the height of}} its power, and was also of the last <b>generation</b> <b>who</b> felt entitled to govern by culture, rather than by expertise. According to Skidelsky, the sense of cultural unity current in Britain from the 19th century to the end of World War I provided a framework with which the well-educated could set various spheres of knowledge in relation {{to each other and to}} life, enabling them to confidently draw from different fields when addressing practical problems.|$|E
5|$|Singers {{who have}} {{recorded}} individual numbers from Messager's operas include role creators such as Jean Périer (Véronique), Lucien Fugère (La basoche), Pierre Darmant and Yvonne Printemps (L'amour masqué), Koval (Passionnément), Marcelle Denya (Coups de roulis), and Maggie Teyte (Monsieur Beaucaire), {{as well as}} other contemporaries Aino Ackté, Emma Eames, and John McCormack whose recordings have been reissued on compact disc. Singers of the next <b>generation</b> <b>who</b> recorded Messager numbers included Georges Thill and Ninon Vallin. More recent singers who have recorded numbers from Messager's operas include Mady Mesplé, Susan Graham, Dame Felicity Lott and Anna Netrebko.|$|E

5000|$|Robert Anton Wilson theorized in {{his book}} Prometheus Rising that {{neophobia}} is instinctual in people after they begin to raise children. Wilson's views on neophobia are mostly negative, believing {{that it is the}} reason human culture and ideas do not advance as quickly as our technology. His model includes an idea from Thomas Kuhn's The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, which is that new ideas, however well proven and evident, are implemented only when the <b>generations</b> <b>who</b> consider them [...] "new" [...] die and are replaced by <b>generations</b> <b>who</b> consider the ideas accepted and old.|$|R

5|$|Khánh {{selected}} a cabinet of thirteen ministers and two Secretaries of State at ministerial level, and chose new provincial and district chiefs. He originally tried to include {{members of a}} variety of political and religious groups including representatives of the Cao Đài and Hòa Hảo sects, who still had remnants of their private armies intact after their defeat by Diệm in 1955. Although Khánh insisted that he had no party affiliation, the orientation of his government was toward the Đại Việt, who held many of the key posts in the government. This provoked bitterness from other anti-communist nationalists and groups that were banned under Diệm and were seeking a greater role in public life, as well as from a younger <b>generation</b> <b>who</b> felt that the established nationalist parties were responsible for dividing the people.|$|E
5|$|Much of Redemption's {{criticism}} {{focused on}} technical problems {{when it was}} released, undermining the game experience or making it unplayable. Several reviewers noted issues with the initial lack of a function to save game progress at any point, which meant that dying or technical issues with the game could necessitate them to reload a previous save, and then repeat up to 30 minutes of gameplay. CGW added that the repetitive gameplay meant that losing progress and having to repeat it was a particular downside. Next <b>Generation,</b> <b>who</b> provided {{the game with a}} score of 3 out of 5, said that Redemption was potentially only a few patches away from being a 5 out of 5 game, if not for technical issues. PC Gamers review even included recommended instructions for cheats that worked around the technical flaws.|$|E
5|$|List {{believed}} that the degradation of modern Western society was {{as a result of}} a conspiracy orchestrated by a secret organisation known as the Great International Party, an idea influenced by anti-semitic conspiracy theories. Adopting a millenarianist perspective, he believed in the imminent defeat of this enemy and the establishment of a better future for the Ario-German race. In April 1915 he welcomed the start of World War I as a conflict that would bring about the defeat of Germany's enemies and the establishment of a golden age for the new Ario-German Empire. Toward the war's end, he {{believed that}} the German war dead would be reincarnated as a <b>generation</b> <b>who</b> would push through with a national revolution and establish this new, better society. For List, this better future would be intricately connected to the ancient past, reflecting his belief in the cyclical nature of time, something which he had adopted both from a reading of Norse mythology and from Theosophy. Reflecting his monarchist beliefs, he envisioned this future state as being governed by the House of Habsburg, with a revived feudal system of land ownership being introduced through which land would be inherited by a man's eldest son. In List's opinion, this new empire would be highly hierarchical, with non-Aryans being subjugated under the Aryan population and opportunities for education and jobs in public service being restricted to those deemed racially pure. He envisioned this Empire following the Wotanic religion which he promoted.|$|E

It was then spread by his student Shuho Myocho (second generation) and Kanzan Egen (third <b>generation),</b> <b>who</b> made it an influential school.|$|E
25|$|He {{was one of}} {{the leading}} figures of the <b>generation</b> <b>who</b> {{at the turn of the}} twentieth century gave new {{intellectual}} life to Irish party politics, and to the constitutional movement towards All-Ireland Home Rule.

25|$|Jefferson's {{performances}} were distinctive {{because of his}} high-pitched voice and the originality of his guitar playing. His recordings sold well, {{but he was not}} a strong influence on younger blues singers of his <b>generation,</b> <b>who</b> could not imitate him as easily as they could other commercially successful artists. Later blues and rock and roll musicians, however, did attempt to imitate both his songs and his musical style.|$|E

25|$|Yasha – a young manservant, {{accompanying}} Lyubov on her {{way back}} from Paris and desperate to return.

A rude, inconsiderate and predatory young man, Yasha, like Dunyasha and Charlotta, is the best the Gayevs can afford. He toys with the girlish affections of Dunyasha, the maid.|$|E
25|$|Most {{commentators}} divide Numbers {{into three}} sections based on locale (Mount Sinai, Kadesh-Barnea and {{the plains of}} Moab), linked by two travel sections; an alternative is {{to see it as}} structured around the two generations of those condemned to die in the wilderness and the new <b>generation</b> <b>who</b> will enter Canaan, making a theological distinction between the disobedience of the first generation and the obedience of the second.|$|E
25|$|Jon Paulien has {{identified}} four brands of Adventism – evangelists and frontier missionaries whose beliefs are traditional yet creatively expressed, scholars concerned with an accurate {{understanding of the}} Bible, the typical church member (including most of the younger, postmodern <b>generation)</b> <b>who</b> is most concerned with what is relevant to ordinary life and not concerned with most doctrines, {{and those in the}} Third World who are similarly concerned for a minimal belief set and passionate about their faith.|$|E
