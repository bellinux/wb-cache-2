40|$|The {{expanded}} use of {{longwall mining}} systems has led, in particular, to different installation arrangements and combinations of <b>ground</b> <b>wire</b> monitors and <b>ground</b> <b>wire</b> devices {{for the purpose}} of monitoring the grounding circuit-These installation arrangements and combinations of <b>ground</b> <b>wire</b> monitors and <b>ground</b> <b>wire</b> devices were not evaluated at the time MSHA originally tested and accepted the <b>ground</b> <b>wire</b> monitor. Although these installation schemes differ from the accepted scheme, they can provide equivalent protection when their operation is coordinated with other electrical power system components. For this reason MSHA’s Approval and Certification Center developed an application procedure to evaluate these installation arrangements. To differentiate the procedure from the standard <b>ground</b> <b>wire</b> monitor or <b>ground</b> <b>wire</b> device application procedure, MSHA has identified this application procedure as the Monitor and Power System (MAPS) Program. This program includes tests and analyses to evaluate and assess various arrangements and combinations of proposed <b>ground</b> <b>wire</b> monitor and <b>ground</b> <b>wire</b> device installations...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} inter metal {{capacitors}} of <b>ground</b> <b>wires</b> are considered, {{for the first}} time in Elmore delay calculations of clock distribution interconnect networks. Analytical models for capacitance calculation of inter metal wires which are exponentially tapered are presented. In addition, the tapering of the <b>ground</b> <b>wire</b> for reducing this delay is proposed. The results show that by a exponentially tapering of the <b>ground</b> <b>wires</b> in the clock distribution networks, a 17 % reduction in the Elmore delay of interconnects is achieved in compare with not tapering <b>ground</b> <b>wires...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analize the effect of {{indirect}} lightning strikes on the 13. 8 kV distribution network at BOB PT. BSP - Pertamina Hulu Bandar Pedada by using ATP-EMTP. Maximum induced voltage of indirect lightning is computed by using Rusck theory, then indirect lightning strikes are simulated by using ATP-EMTP. In this paper, five conditions are simulated. The first condition is the distribution line without the indirect lightning strikes with 15 kV lightning arresters and the <b>ground</b> <b>wire</b> is installed, the second condition is the indirect lightning strikes without the 15 kV lightning arresters and <b>ground</b> <b>wire,</b> the third condition is indirect lightning strikes with the <b>ground</b> <b>wire</b> is installed and without the 15 kV lightning arrester, the fourth condition is the indirect lightning strikes with 15 kV lightning arresters are installed and without the <b>ground</b> <b>wire,</b> and the fifth condition is the indirect lightning strikes with the 15 kV lightning arresters and <b>ground</b> <b>wire</b> is installed. The simulation results show that the <b>ground</b> <b>wire</b> is able to reduce the effect of the induced voltage from the indirect lightning strikes, the 15 kV lightning arresters are able to reduce the effect of the induced voltage from the indirect lightning strikes, and the best results are obtained when the <b>ground</b> <b>wire</b> and the 15 kV lightning arresters are installed on the distribution line...|$|R

A comprehensive test is conducted. Against the interference, obstacles blocking and network congestion issues in a substation, proposes to increase routing nodes, adjust letter spacing, etc. to improve communication reliability. The system can achieve real-time monitoring of the status of temporary <b>ground</b> <b>wire</b> in a substation job site，with high reliability and good effect，which is worth being extended. ...|$|R
5000|$|Cheater plugs were {{previously}} available {{with a short}} flexible <b>grounding</b> <b>wire</b> rather than a screw tab. This allows use of the second duplex outlet {{that does not have}} a faceplate screw in the correct location for the screw tab. The <b>grounding</b> <b>wire</b> would be wrapped around the adapter to reach the faceplate screw. However, this ground-wire style of cheater plug was discontinued when it was noted that a loose unattached <b>grounding</b> <b>wire</b> could by accident become inserted into the [...] "hot" [...] blade socket of a nearby outlet, potentially leading to electrocution.|$|R

40|$|Given {{the fact}} that the {{installing}} costs of an optical <b>ground</b> <b>wire</b> on overhead lines directly depend on its cross-section, which in turn depends on the level of fault current it should withstand, in order to reduce these current values in the optical <b>ground</b> <b>wire,</b> I suggested performing its isolated descents from the end towers of the line with its transition to an optical cable. The research was carried out on the example of a 500 kV overhead line in the National Electric Power Grid. The Method of Symmetrical Components for calculating asymmetrical fault currents was not used; therefore, calculations were carried out on the base of presenting the line as a multi-wire system for the considered case as a five-wire system (optical <b>ground</b> <b>wire,</b> steel <b>ground</b> <b>wire,</b> and three phase wires). Such approach allows taking into account the initial asymmetry of the line parameters and modeling any kind of asymmetrical faults. The analyses of calculated results were performed. The conclusive evidence that the optical <b>ground</b> <b>wire</b> isolated descents from the end towers of the line give the possibility of reducing the level of maximal fault current distribution values in it and therefore its cross section, is presented...|$|R

5000|$|An NVIS antenna {{configuration}} is a horizontally polarized (parallel with {{the surface of}} the earth) radiating element that is from 1/20th wavelength (λ) to 1/4 wavelength above the ground. Optimum height is about 1/4 wavelength, and high angle radiation declines only slightly for heights up to about 3/8 wavelength. http://k9yc.com/AntennaPlanning.pdf That proximity to the ground forces the majority of the radiation to go straight up. Overall efficiency of the antenna can be increased by placing a <b>ground</b> <b>wire</b> slightly longer than the antenna parallel to and directly underneath the antenna. One source says that a single <b>ground</b> <b>wire</b> can provide antenna gain in the 3-6 dB range. Another source indicates 2 dB for a single wire and nearly 4 dB for multiple <b>ground</b> <b>wires.</b> [...] <b>Ground</b> <b>wires</b> are more necessary when using lower dipoles over poor soils as without them considerable energy goes into heating the ground.|$|R

50|$|Because {{an attic}} fan {{is made of}} metal, and is also subject to {{lightning}} strikes if mounted on a roof, grounding is extremely important.
