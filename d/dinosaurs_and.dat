5|$|Since the Cambrian {{explosion}} {{there have}} been five distinctly identifiable mass extinctions. The last mass extinction occurred some 66 million years ago, when a meteorite collision probably triggered the extinction of the non-avian <b>dinosaurs</b> <b>and</b> other large reptiles, but spared small animals such as mammals.

5|$|The {{growth in}} {{interest}} in dinosaurs since the Dinosaur Renaissance {{has been accompanied}} by depictions made by artists working with ideas at the leading edge of dinosaur science, presenting lively <b>dinosaurs</b> <b>and</b> feathered dinosaurs as these concepts were first being considered. Cultural depictions of dinosaurs have been an important means of translating scientific discoveries to the public.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} other {{skeletal}} features are shared by dinosaurs. However, because they are either common to other groups of archosaurs or were not present in all early dinosaurs, these features are {{not considered to be}} synapomorphies. For example, as diapsids, dinosaurs ancestrally had two pairs of temporal fenestrae (openings in the skull behind the eyes), and as members of the diapsid group Archosauria, had additional openings in the snout and lower jaw. Additionally, several characteristics once thought to be synapomorphies are now known to have appeared before dinosaurs, or were absent in the earliest <b>dinosaurs</b> <b>and</b> independently evolved by different dinosaur groups. These include an elongated scapula, or shoulder blade; a sacrum composed of three or more fused vertebrae (three are found in some other archosaurs, but only two are found in Herrerasaurus); and a perforate acetabulum, or hip socket, with a hole at the center of its inside surface (closed in Saturnalia, for example). Another difficulty of determining distinctly dinosaurian features is that early <b>dinosaurs</b> <b>and</b> other archosaurs from the late Triassic are often poorly known and were similar in many ways; these animals have sometimes been misidentified in the literature.|$|E
5|$|Archaeopteryx was {{the first}} fossil found that {{revealed}} a potential connection between <b>dinosaurs</b> <b>and</b> birds. It is considered a transitional fossil, in that it displays features of both groups. Brought to light just two years after Darwin's seminal The Origin of Species, its discovery spurred the nascent debate between proponents of evolutionary biology and creationism. This early bird is so dinosaur-like that, without a clear impression of feathers in the surrounding rock, at least one specimen was mistaken for Compsognathus. Since the 1990s, a number of additional feathered dinosaurs have been found, providing even stronger evidence of the close relationship between <b>dinosaurs</b> <b>and</b> modern birds. Most of these specimens were unearthed in the lagerstätte of the Yixian Formation, Liaoning, northeastern China, {{which was part of}} an island continent during the Cretaceous. Though feathers have been found in only a few locations, it is possible that non-avian dinosaurs elsewhere in the world were also feathered. The lack of widespread fossil evidence for feathered non-avian dinosaurs may be because delicate features like skin and feathers are not often preserved by fossilization and thus are absent from the fossil record.|$|E

5|$|As study {{caught up}} to the wealth of new {{material}} from western North America, and venues for depictions proliferated, dinosaurs gained in popularity. The paintings of Charles R. Knight were the first influential representations of these finds. Knight worked extensively with the American Museum of Natural History and its director, Henry Fairfield Osborn, who wanted to use <b>dinosaurs</b> <b>and</b> other prehistoric animals to promote his museum and his ideas on evolution.|$|E
5|$|Based {{on fossil}} and {{biological}} evidence, most scientists accept that birds are a specialised subgroup of theropod <b>dinosaurs,</b> <b>and</b> more specifically, they {{are members of}} Maniraptora, a group of theropods which includes dromaeosaurs and oviraptorids, among others. As scientists have discovered more theropods closely related to birds, the previously clear distinction between non-birds and birds has become blurred. Recent discoveries in the Liaoning Province of northeast China, which demonstrate many small theropod feathered dinosaurs, contribute to this ambiguity.|$|E
5|$|Bearing a large bony frill {{and three}} horns on its large four-legged body, and {{possessing}} similarities {{with the modern}} rhinoceros, Triceratops {{is one of the}} most recognizable of all <b>dinosaurs</b> <b>and</b> the best known ceratopsid. It shared the landscape with and was probably preyed upon by Tyrannosaurus, though it is less certain that the two did battle in the manner often depicted in traditional museum displays and popular images.|$|E

5|$|Comparisons {{between the}} scleral rings of <b>dinosaurs</b> <b>and</b> modern birds and {{reptiles}} {{have been used}} to infer daily activity patterns of dinosaurs. Although {{it has been suggested that}} most dinosaurs were active during the day, these comparisons have shown that small predatory dinosaurs such as dromaeosaurids, Juravenator, and Megapnosaurus were likely nocturnal. Large and medium-sized herbivorous and omnivorous dinosaurs such as ceratopsians, sauropodomorphs, hadrosaurids, ornithomimosaurs may have been cathemeral, active during short intervals throughout the day, although the small ornithischian Agilisaurus was inferred to be diurnal.|$|E
5|$|Dinosaurs began {{appearing}} in films {{soon after the}} introduction of cinema, the first being the good-natured animated Gertie the Dinosaur in 1914. However, lovable dinosaurs were quickly replaced by monsters as moviemakers recognized the potential of huge frightening monsters. D. W. Griffith in 1914's Brute Force provided the first example of a threatening cinematic dinosaur, a Ceratosaurus who menaced cavemen. This film enshrined the fiction that <b>dinosaurs</b> <b>and</b> early humans lived together, {{and set up the}} cliché that dinosaurs were bloodthirsty and attacked anything that moved.|$|E
5|$|During the 1970s, Walter Alvarez {{was doing}} {{geologic}} research in central Italy.

Walter told his father that the layer marked where the <b>dinosaurs</b> <b>and</b> much else became extinct and that nobody knew why, or what the clay was about — it was a big mystery and he intended to solve it.|$|E

5|$|Heinrich Mallison from Berlin's Museum of Natural History also {{presented}} a theory in 2011, suggesting that Tyrannosaurus {{and many other}} dinosaurs may have achieved relatively high speeds through short rapid strides instead of the long strides employed by modern birds and mammals when running, likening their movement to power-walking. This, according to Mallison, would have been achievable irrespective of joint strength and lessened {{the need for additional}} muscle mass in the legs, particularly at the ankles. To support his theory, Mallison assessed the limbs of various <b>dinosaurs</b> <b>and</b> found that they were different from those of modern mammals and birds; having their stride length greatly limited by their skeletons, but also having relatively large muscles at the hindquarters. He found a few similarities between the muscles in <b>dinosaurs</b> <b>and</b> race-walkers; having less muscle mass in the ankles but more at the hindquarters. John Hutchinson advised caution regarding this theory, suggesting that they must first look into dinosaur muscles to see how frequently they could have contracted.|$|E
5|$|Herrerasaurus had a long, narrow skull that lacked {{nearly all}} the specializations that {{characterized}} later <b>dinosaurs,</b> <b>and</b> more closely resembled those of more primitive archosaurs such as Euparkeria. It had five pairs of fenestrae (skull openings) in its skull, two pairs of which were for the eyes and nostrils. Between the eyes and the nostrils were two antorbital fenestrae {{and a pair of}} tiny, 1-centimeter-long (0.4in) slit-like holes called promaxillary fenestrae.|$|E
