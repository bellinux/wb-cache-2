5000|$|Title I, Escambia County, Florida Formerly the {{original}} [...] Title I would authorize Escambia County in Florida to convey certain property that it {{received from the}} federal government.

As a condition of that conveyance, Escambia County can reconvey the properties to the federal government or to the State of Florida. Title I would remove that condition and add new conditions. First, any conveyance of the specified properties would require the county to convey to Santa Rosa County any of the property that falls within the jurisdictional boundaries of Santa Rosa County. Second, any proceeds above the direct or <b>incidental</b> <b>costs</b> from conveyances would be transferred to the federal government. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that implementing title I would have no significant impact on the federal budget. Based on information provided by the National Park Service (NPS) and local government entities, CBO estimates that the proceeds from any conveyances would be used to cover those costs. [...] Title II, Anchorage, Alaska Formerly [...] Title II would require the Secretary of the Interior to convey the reversionary interest of the United States in three acres of land to the city of Anchorage, Alaska. Under current law, the city holds title to those lands and will retain title as long as the lands are used for public purposes. If the city stops using the lands for such purposes, title would revert to the federal government. [...] Based on information provided by the city of Anchorage, CBO expects that, under current law, the city would continue to use the affected lands for public purposes and hold title to those lands over the next 10 years. Furthermore, under title II, any administrative costs associated with conveying the reversionary interest in those lands would be paid by the city; therefore, CBO estimates that implementing title II would have no effect on the federal budget. [...] Title III, Fernley, NevadaFormerly [...] Title III would direct the Secretary of the Interior to sell up to 9,400 acres of federal land to the city of Fernley, Nevada.

40|$|Reported {{expenditures}} {{for environmental protection}} are often cited as {{an assessment of the}} burden of current regulatory efforts. However, the potential for both incidental savings and uncounted costs means that the actual burden could be either higher or lower than these reported values. Using a production cost model that considers the possible interaction between environmental and non-environmental expenditures, we directly estimate the dollar-for-dollar <b>incidental</b> savings/uncounted <b>costs</b> arising from a one-dollar increase in reported environmental expenditures. Although recent literature supports the idea that reported expenditures probably understate the actual burden, we find no such evidence in the manufacturing sector based on a large panel of plant-level data. In one industry, we find statistically significant overstatement. In three others, we find no significant deviation in either direction. We conclude that, although cost estimates are not overstated on average, variation and uncertainty exist at the industry level, with some plants experiencing savings and others possibly facing uncounted burdens. © 2001 by the President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology...|$|R

In 2007, Austria ranked 11 th in the international labour cost hierarchy. Labour was most expensive in Norway (one working hour in manufacturing was 33 percent more expensive than in Austria), followed by Belgium (+ 20 percent), Sweden (+ 17 percent), Denmark and Germany (+ 10 percent). Thanks to the exchange rate, Switzerland improved its position, although a working hour was still more expensive (by 8 percent) than in Austria. In France and the Netherlands the working hour cost more, in Finland the same as in Austria. In the UK and Ireland, manufacturers paid 10 percent less; in Italy the cost was one fifth lower than in Austria. The euro appreciation reduced the cost of a working hour in the USA; hence labour was in the USA by a quarter and in Japan by almost 40 percent cheaper than in Austria. In the new EU countries, labour cost a fraction of the Austrian rate: in Hungary, Estonia and the Czech Republic it was just about 20 percent, in Poland, Lithuania and Latvia 15 percent, and in Romania and Bulgaria less than 10 percent.

We consider gratis allocation (grandfathering), auctions, and their combination in so-called hybrid systems. Regarding the auctions, we also inquire for the ”appropriate design ” for carbon auctions. In a theoretical approach, where agents bid according to their marginal abatement costs, we show that the hybrid system of grandfathering and a one-sided auction (which is taken into account in the EU-ETS) does not generate reliable price signals, which should reflect the actual market scarcity of the allowances. This requirement, however, is met, if in the hybrid system the one-sided auction is replaced by a double auction or if a one-sided auction is used exclusively.

The bio-optical cruise departed from, and returned to, Ambon, and sampled in the Banda Sea.

40|$|This thesis {{work has}} been written both for and in {{co-operation}} with the company IAC Group Gothenburg. The main purpose of the report {{is to find a}} new alternative material replenishment system which will improve the internal material flow and eliminate unnecessary work activities such as manual call offs. The aim is to find a new system to reduce the <b>incidental</b> <b>costs</b> incurred and improve customer service in quality and performance. Observations and interviews were conducted and an analysis of the current situation was made. Waste was identified in the form of unnecessary transport, specifically in milk runs, where time was spent looking for materials to be loaded. This creates uncertainty and may contribute to increased costs and poor customer service. Three different options for a new replenishment system were developed which were compared with the theory and present situation. The proposal was evaluated with respect to cost, available support, complexity and future compatibility. The analysis of the theory and current state shows the importance of a long-term solution with few risks of waste. The solution that best cope with this is an e-Kanban system that automates the replenishment system and would make manual material call offs disappear completely. The conclusion is that an e-Kanban system is the best long term option for a manufacturing company like IAC because it is highly adaptable to change, and can be integrated in the company’s ERP system. The recommendation is to implement a new e-Kanban system. First, it should be tested on a pilot station and then introduced to the whole production process...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from Springer Verlag via the DOI in this record. The remains of a wooden V-shaped fish weir and associated structures have been discovered near Ashlett Creek on the tidal mudflats of Southampton Water in Hampshire, southern Britain. Radiocarbon dating of oak roundwood stakes taken from the main weir structure date it to the middle Saxon period. Clusters of as-yet undated roundwood posts within the catchment area of the weir are interpreted as the frames for fish traps that are assumed to pre- or post-date the operational period of the weir itself. The weir is contemporary with wooden V-shaped fish weirs found elsewhere in southern and central Britain, and also Ireland, but its circular catchment ‘pound’ remains restricted, in these islands, to the Solent and Severn estuaries: it has a close parallel with another Saxon-era weir on the nearby Isle of Wight. It also shows striking structural similarities with examples in use today in Basse Normandy, on the southern shore of the English Channel. The paper discusses the function and operation of the weir, and places it in its social and historical context. Regressive cartography demonstrates that the structures have become exposed {{as a result of}} saltmarsh retreat in this area of Southampton Water since the 19 th century. The radiocarbon dates returned for the posts demonstrate that this transgression of the marsh must have been preceded by a prolonged period of progradation, which covered and preserved the site; its subsequent re-exposure has negative implications for its survival. The fieldwork underpinning this research was carried out using equipment and facilities provided by the Centre for Maritime Archaeology of the University of Southampton.
