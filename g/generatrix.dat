While modeling, the authors have determined the theoretical dependency needed to estimate the mean life of working rolls according to the transverse strip gauge interference criterion. Gauge interference of tandem-rolled strip transverse section shall be derived from {{the sum of the}} values of current shape of upper and lower working rolls active <b>generatrixes,</b> which are calculated based on strip width. In its turn, an active section of each roll shall be calculated for every following strip as a difference between the current roll radius values at the crown middle and that above/below the strip edge, while the shape deterioration rate of active roll <b>generatrixes</b> shall be defined by the difference between the roll wear rates in these sections. To estimate the rate of roll wear during rolling every following strip of the specified gauge, the base dependency of the structure-energy concept describing wear of stationary tribocouplings is used, which has been obtained by simultaneous solution of fundamental equations of molecule-mechanical and structure-energy friction theories. The moment of working roll failure (expected life) is determined based on the condition of achieving the nominal limit by gauge interference of a current strip...|$|R

50|$|It is {{believed}} that the first definition of a conic section is due to Menaechmus (died 320 BCE) {{as part of his}} solution of the Delian problem (Duplicating the cube). His work did not survive, not even the names he used for these curves, and is only known through secondary accounts. The definition used at that time differs from the one commonly used today. Cones were constructed by rotating a right triangle about one of its legs so the hypotenuse generates the surface of the cone (such a line is called a <b>generatrix).</b> Three types of cones were determined by their vertex angles (measured by twice the angle formed by the hypotenuse and the leg being rotated about in the right triangle). The conic section was then determined by intersecting one of these cones with a plane drawn perpendicular to a <b>generatrix.</b> The type of the conic is determined by the type of cone, that is, by the angle formed at the vertex of the cone: If the angle is acute then the conic is an ellipse; if the angle is right then the conic is a parabola; and if the angle is obtuse then the conic is a hyperbola (but only one branch of the curve).|$|E

40|$|A {{translational}} sweep is the translating of a polygon, {{called the}} <b>generatrix</b> G, around another polygon, called the directrix D, under two conditions: (1) G {{is always in}} contact with D; and (2) the interiors of G and D do not intersect. Three classes of translational sweep are studied, including the case in which both G and D are convex; the case in which G is convex, D monotone; and the case in which both are monotone. Efficient algorithms for computing the trajectory and the swept area as well as geometric and computational properties are presented for each class. A notion called the inverse <b>generatrix,</b> which reveals a duality between the trajectory and the swept polygon, is introduced to reduce complexity. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.
