The rationale for introducing social health insurance in Russia in the early 1990 s was primarily to secure a reliable source of funding but also {{to improve the quality of}} care and introduce user entitlements known as patient rights. This paper discusses findings of a survey carried out in 1999 - 2000 to explore users' perceptions of reforms, changes in quality of care and their satisfaction with patient rights in Murmansk, Yaroslavl, Moscow Region and Moscow City, using a structured questionnaire and metric scales. Nearly half of the respondents thought that the quality of services had not changed significantly since the introduction of the MHI, although the majority accepted the necessity for reforms. Many reported having little or no information about health insurance or patient rights.

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the cost-utility of Vertebroplasty versus conservative therapy (Thoracolumbosacral orthosis) {{for treatment of}} post-traumatic non-osteoporotic and/or non-neoplastic fractures. Materials and Methods: A prospective, randomized, non-blinded, single-center study was carried out between 2010 and 2013. The study included 99 patients, aged from 18 years to 70 years, suffering from acute non-osteoporotic vertebral fracture. We compared costs and Quality-Adjusted Life Years and assessed the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio for the two arm groups. Health <b>insurance,</b> <b>patient</b> and societal perspectives are considered. Results: For health insurance perspective, total cost was € 7, 267 for the brace group versus € 7, 365 for the vertebroplasty group (mean difference € 75. 3; p < 0. 9). For patient perspective, total cost was € 5, 303 for the brace group and € 3, 435 for the vertebroplasty group (mean difference €- 1, 900. 7; p< 0. 02). For societal perspective, total cost was € 13, 071 for the brace group and € 14, 289 for the vertebroplasty group (mean difference € 1, 165, p < 0. 36). Differences between groups in QALY were non-significant: 0. 01 (95 % CI - 0. 01; 0. 04 p= 0. 5).

40|$|Introduction: The {{quality of}} life is an {{important}} topic in study of chronic diseases, especially cancer. Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women. Breast cancer survival rates is longand as a result patients are affected by cancer and its complications and consequences a longer time. It is therefore seems necessary to determine the {{quality of life}} and its related factors in these patients. Objective: This study aimed to determine The quality of life and its related factors in patients with breast cancer. Materials and Methods: This is a descriptive-analytical study to evaluate the quality of life and its influencing factors in patients with breast cancerreceiving chemotherapy was conductedon 100 patients referring to Ahvaz city Golestanand Shefahospitals. The data were collected by demographic variables questionnaire and information on the quality of life related to health were collected using a questionnaire (WHOQOLBREF) within 3 months and were analyzed using SPSS 19 software and descriptive statistics and t-test Pearson correlation coefficient and linear regression. Results:The study results showed that {{the mean age of the}} studied components is 46 / 85 (Standard deviation 11 / 55) and the average score of the quality of life in physical health is 0. 558 23. 867. Mental health 0. 359 14. 085, social communication 14. 56 0. 48, environmental health 0. 554 19. 945. and the total life quality score is 87. 952 2. 154.

40|$|Background—Medicaid and uninsured {{populations are}} a {{significant}} focus of current healthcare reform. We hypothesized that outcomes after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in the United States is dependent on primary payer status. Methods and Results—From 2003 to 2007, 1 250 619 isolated CABG operations were evaluated using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database. Patients were stratified by primary payer status: Medicare, Medicaid, uninsured, and private insurance. Hierarchical multiple regression models were applied to assess the effect of primary payer status on postoperative outcomes. Unadjusted mortality for Medicare (3. 3 %), Medicaid (2. 4 %), and uninsured (1. 9 %) patients were higher compared with private <b>insurance</b> <b>patients</b> (1. 1 %, P 0. 001). Unadjusted length of stay was longest for Medicaid patients (10. 90. 04 days) and shortest for private <b>insurance</b> <b>patients</b> (8. 00. 01 days, P 0. 001). Medicaid patients accrued the highest unadjusted total costs ($ 113 380386, P 0. 001).
