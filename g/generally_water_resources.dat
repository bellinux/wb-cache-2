Currently, accepted sources are being consumed {{at a higher}} rate than nature replenishes them. This is necessitating the need to find and develop new <b>water</b> <b>resources.</b> In conjunction with the proper treatment and management, wastewater is a <b>water</b> <b>resource,</b> known as reuse. Properly managed, reused water can augment the available water supply. Primary applications include irrigation of agricultural and landscaped areas, surface water recreational areas, and groundwater recharge. These uses relieve the demands on the <b>generally</b> accepted <b>water</b> <b>resources,</b> thus increasing the net water supply. The required level of treatment varies with the intended reuse application. Treatment levels for reuse range from secondary to tertiary treatment systems. Some reuse applications provide additional treatment to the water. The reuser must assure that the treatment system and reuse application provide an equal or improved water quality to that of the receiving body of water. Regardless of the application, stringent operation and maintenance of the reuse system is essential. A well planned management program will minimize hazards associated with reuse of wastewater. This program is required to keep the liabilities of both the treatment plant and reuse site owners to a minimum. Without this, reuse is not a viable option. The underlying questions remain to determine the feasibility of reuse for a community: Does the water supply require augmentation {{to meet the demands of}} the future?

However, leasing of fishing rights generally has been limited to “fish-out ponds,” where channel catfish, rainbow trout, or other species are stocked in specially designed (aquaculture) ponds. Other fee fishing systems include day and long-term leasing of ponds and reservoirs for sportfishing. The popularity of fishing leases as farm or ranch enterprises has not kept pace with hunting leases <b>generally</b> because <b>water</b> <b>resources</b> held {{in the public domain}} have been more readily available compared to state and federal land for sporthunting. Nevertheless, a new trend involving fee fishing is slowly developing across the South. An increasing number of landowners who lease hunting rights are realizing that ponds and reservoirs on their property are valuable resources with the potential to generate additional profits.

40|$|Snowmelt {{makes up}} {{a large portion of}} the streamflow in the mountainous western United States. The spatial {{distribution}} of snow water equivalent (SWE) can affect the magnitude and timing of the spring and summer runoff represented in the hydrograph. Hence, efforts to improve our understanding of the spatial distribution of SWE are vital for good management of our ecological and <b>water</b> <b>resources.</b> SWE is traditionally monitored at measuring stations spread across the western United States, but these stations have been shown to poorly represent the unsampled areas. Remote sensing from satellites has existed since the 1960 s but is still unable to measure SWE at scales relevant for <b>water</b> <b>resources.</b> This research utilizes spatio-temporal datasets to promote the use of historical observations of fractional snow covered area (fSCA) to improve estimates of SWE. First, I show that retrospective models of historical SWE distributions from observed fSCA depletion patterns augment existing ground observations of SWE to improve real-time estimates of SWE in unsampled locations. Second, I show that remotely sensed observations of fSCA improve the temporal transferability of the relationship between topography and SWE. Third, a high resolution spatio-temporal dataset is used to observe depletion curves for the first time and evaluate the topographic controls on the relationship between fSCA and snow depth inherent in these depletion curves. Each of these chapters leverages fSCA as an important component and together imply that fSCA has historically been an underutilized observation. Observations of fSCA are available globally for about three decades but necessitate spatially explicit observations of snow depth or SWE to make the most of this long record. Emerging technologies, such as Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR), that provide high resolution spatio-temporal observations of the snowpack and other environmental variables should continue to be exploited to provide insights regarding the physical processes controlling snow dynamics and more <b>generally</b> our <b>water</b> <b>resources.</b> Future adaptions to climate change rely on improving our understanding of the controlling processes and our ability to monitor them at the relevant scales...|$|R

Many industries generate waste products that contain high concentrations of heavy metals which are discharged directly or indirectly into water systems (Hang et al. 2009; Velea et al. 2008; Zhuang et al. 2009). In South Africa, the mining industry accounts for the largest portion of heavy metal contamination through acid mine drainage (AMD). The removal of these toxic metal ions is an important challenge {{taking into account that}} the current methods of remediating contaminated water such as ion-exchange resin, electrolytic or liquid extraction, electrodialysis, chemical precipitation, membrane filtration, and biosorption are sometimes inadequate due to the large quantities of these wastes, resulting in metal-bearing sludges which are difficult to dispose of. Furthermore, most of these traditional methods are expensive. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new feasible and cost effective methods (Ahmed et al. 2008; Ghoul et al. 2003).|$|R
40|$|Background: Healthy water {{passes through}} the {{pipelines}} from supply resources to consuming places in which passing from these stages may cause some cases of contamination like heavy metal contamination. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to evaluate the contamination of heavy metals (copper, lead, zinc, cadmium, iron, and manganese) in <b>water</b> <b>resources</b> of Nurabad city of Lorestan in 2013. Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional study, samples were collected from 7 wells of drinking water and 2 water storage tanks during 6 months in Nurabad. So that, heavy metal parameters such as copper, lead, zinc, cadmium, iron, and manganese were measured using an atomic absorption device and also electrical conductivity, sulfate, chloride and total dissolved solids were also measured in accordance with standard methods. Results: Results indicated that the concentration of studied metals in water sources was lower than the national standards and World Health Organization standard, and in the water supply system the concentration of some metals was more than standard level. Moreover, the results showed that the concentration of studied heavy metals were more in winter than in autumn. Conclusion: <b>Generally,</b> in the <b>water</b> <b>resources</b> of Nurabad city the concentration of studied heavy metals was lower than the national standards and World Health Organization standard and there are not problems for water consumers. However, due to public health and the presence of a high concentration of these metals in the distribution supply, the heavy metal concentration in drinking water of this region should be monitored regularly by responsible organizations...|$|R

It was yet brought up to people’s attention that <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> planning is a crucial element of urban planning, {{not to mention the}} effort that should be spent in investigating and exploring the potential value of water to economy, esthetics and social development. This paper introduced the practices of Singapore government in managing its local <b>water</b> <b>resources,</b> i. e. recovery of the polluted water environment in its early years, integrated planning of catchment and reservoirs for stormwater storage, acquiring new resource to supplement and replacing conventional <b>water</b> <b>resource,</b> establishing public outreach network for water demand management and <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> protection, adopting <b>water</b> sensitive urban design to rediscover the added value of <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> to urban development, etc. By reviewing the mechanism of Singapore’s practices on sustainable planning, the existing urban <b>water</b> <b>resources</b> shortage situation in China would be addressed and suggestion for urban <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> sustainable planning and use would also be given...|$|R

To reveal {{the nature of}} <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> issues under changing situations, the <b>water</b> <b>resources</b> system needs to be studied from a macro and systematic perspective. This report develops a <b>water</b> <b>resources</b> system into a <b>water</b> <b>resources</b> compound system that is constantly evolving under the combined action of the development, resistant, and coordination mechanisms. Additionally, the water quotient {{is defined as a}} quantitative representation of the sustainable development state of the <b>water</b> <b>resources</b> compound system. Four cities in China, Beijing, Fuzhou, Urumqi, and Lhasa, were selected as the study areas. The differences in the three types of mechanisms and the water quotient of the <b>water</b> <b>resources</b> compound system of each city in 2013 were compared. The results indicate that the different subsystems that comprise the compound system of a given area have different development mechanisms and resistant mechanisms. There are clear differences in the mechanisms and the water quotients for the <b>water</b> <b>resources</b> compound systems of different regions. Pertinent measures should be taken into account during integrated <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> management to improve the sustainable development status of regional <b>water</b> <b>resources</b> compound systems...|$|R

The management of the existing <b>water</b> <b>resources</b> is needed by developing computer base structural database management system. The design of database system is used for development of software for <b>water</b> <b>resources</b> database management. The developed software {{can be used as}} Decision Support System to help city management and useful for information system to find out the potential of all <b>water</b> <b>resources</b> in Samarina. The output of this activity is software formanaging <b>water</b> <b>resources</b> in Samarinda city...|$|R
