40|$|False results {{showing an}} {{outbreak}} of Pseudomonas aeruginosa with resistance to imipenem were traced to a <b>defective</b> <b>lot</b> of microdilution MIC testing panels. These panels contained two- to threefold lower concentrations of imipenem than expected and resulted in artifactual two- to fourfold increases in MICs of imipenem. The quality-control MIC results for Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 were 4 μg/ml, the highest value within the range recommended by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. We recommend that this value be considered out of the quality-control range...|$|E
30|$|For the consumer, FN is {{an error}} of {{disastrous}} proportions, and as stated above, DR calls {{the probability of}} this occurrence consumer risk. Accepting the <b>defective</b> <b>lot</b> means placing inadequate material {{on the assembly line}} or on the store shelves. On the other hand, the consumer who rejects good lots commits FP, a lesser error, even though the result may be costly in terms of unnecessary replacement costs and delays. DR and all posterior literature in acceptance sampling assume that the risk of rejecting acceptable lots has no relevance to the consumer. Even though this assumption may have been necessary to simplify the probability calculations in the early 1900 s, today’s calculators have made this assumption reasonably gratuitous. Logically, the sampling plan that satisfies the consumer will have as a sample cutoff {{a very small number of}} defective items c and a relatively large sample size n, facilitating rejection. This means that some good lots will be judged guilty as non-conforming and rejected, but this consequence is less troublesome to the consumer. For instance, when a multinational makes purchases from a small supplier, the multinational sets c at zero, compelling the small supplier to rectify some lots unjustly rejected (Squeglia 1994). Logically, since its repercussions are more severe, the decision maker should hold primary risk to lower levels when compared to secondary risk.|$|E
40|$|Rework is {{described}} as the transformation of production rejects into re-usable products of the same or lower quality. Rework can be very profitable, especially if disposal costs are high and if materials are expensive and limited in availability. Furthermore, rework can contribute to a ‘green image’. Although {{there is quite a}} lot of literature on logistic planning and control of rework, up to now no {{attention has been paid to}} rework of production rejects that deteriorate while waiting to be reworked. Such situations occur, for example, in the food industry. This paper deals with the above in a production line that is dedicated to a single product and that uses the same facilities for production and rework. Produced lots may be non-defective, reworkable defective or non-reworkable <b>defective.</b> Reworkable <b>defective</b> <b>lots</b> deteriorate over time, which effects the rework time and the rework cost. We consider a disposal strategy and two types of rework strategies. We derive expressions for the average profit per time unit, including costs for production, rework, disposal, procurement of input materials, and storage of reworkable <b>defective</b> <b>lots.</b> Using those expressions, the strategies can be compared numerically, as is illustrated for a few examples...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} a production line that {{is dedicated to}} a single product. Produced lots may be non-defective, reworkable defective, or non-reworkable defective. The production line switches between production and rework. After producing a fixed number (N) of <b>lots,</b> all reworkable <b>defective</b> <b>lots</b> are reworked. Reworkable defectives are perishable, i. e., worsen while held in stock. We assume that the rework time and the rework cost increase linear with the time that a lot is held in stock. Therefore, N should not be too large. On the other hand, N should not be too small either, since there are set-up times and costs associated with switching between production and rework. For a given N, we derive an explicit expression for the average profit (sales revenue minus costs). Using that expression, the optimal value for N can be determined numerically. batch production;perishability;rework...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} an {{analysis}} into {{the cause of the}} non-solderability of multiple <b>defective</b> part <b>lots</b> from two capacitor manufacturers are described. This analysis consisted of visual, scanning electron microscopic, surface, and metalographic examinations and analyses. The results indicated that non-solderability results from areas of excess porosity in the termination which are caused by segregation of ink constituents during manufacturing. This segregation can be minimized by proper monitoring and control of process variables; where excess porosity does occur, solderability can be improved by proper precleaning of parts...|$|R
40|$|Acceptance {{sampling}} is {{an important}} field of statistical quality control. This thesis proposed online algorithms to construct hypergeometric sampling plans using Chebyshev polynomials. The recurrence relationship of Chebyshev polynomials significantly reduces the combinatorial computations for hypergeometric distributions. This property can be extended to compute binomial probabilities. The online tables generated by the proposed algorithms are {{easy to use and}} precise compared with the Odeh and Owen (1983) 's table. One can readily check the required sample size and acceptance number for pre-specified producer's risk; consumer's risk, proportion <b>defective,</b> and/or <b>lot</b> size for hypergeometric and binomial samplings. The algorithms also cover the confidence limits for hypergeometric and OC curve for binomial sampling.

40|$|Artículo científico [...] Universidad de Costa Rica. Instituto de Investigaciones en Salud, 1990 The Lot Quality Assurance Sampling (LOAS) {{method was}} {{developed}} in industry to determine at reasonable cost whether each lot of a shipment is acceptable, based on samples of a few elements from the lot. Acting as inspectors of quality control, the field supervisors of the Costa Rican primary health care programme used the LOAS technique to assess performance {{in all of the}} programme's 758 delivery points (lots). They selected probability samples of 20 households and classified the lot as unacceptable when the sample contained more than four unserved households. This 20 - 4 LOAS rule was aimed to identify lots with less than 70 % coverage. Forty-three percent of lots were found unacceptable in their home visit schedule, and 25 % unacceptable in vaccination coverage. The probability of accepting <b>defective</b> <b>lots,</b> or consumer risk, was estimated at 4 %, and the probability of rejecting acceptable lots, or provider rik, was at 17 %. As side results, it was found that 84 % of children aged 1 – 2 years were fully vaccinated, and an estimated 58 % of households had been visited in the last six months. A household survey showed that clinic records, which serve as both a sampling frame and source of information for the LOAS assessment, produce accurate estimates of vaccination coverage but contain biased information about home visit dates. Given the chronic lack of timely and accurate information from service statistics, and the high costs of conventional sampling surveys, the LOAS technique appears to be a cost-efficient alternative for monitoring delivery points of primary health care in some circumstances.

40|$|Abstract: A {{quality control}} {{manufacturing}} process {{is designed to}} produce certain types of components (i. e. mechanical, electrical or chemical). The process is defined to be under control if the fraction of the items manufactured that are defective is reasonably small. The fraction of items <b>defective</b> varies from <b>lot</b> to lot, which is the main assumption that we will use in the mathematical development of our reliability model. It is logical to assume {{in this case that}} the mean of the lot is a random variable and so is the fraction defective. A relationship between the two quantities {{is the subject of this}} paper...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{classification}} of judgement in attribute acceptance sampling plan {{is based on}} binary classification such as defective or non-defective. However, in many practical cases {{it is difficult to}} classify the item as strictly conforming or nonconforming when quality data related to various items are expressed as good, almost good, bad, not so bad and so on. This introduces vagueness in the value of proportion <b>defective</b> in the <b>lot</b> / process. Fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic are powerful mathematical tools for modeling uncertain systems which has incomplete and imprecise information. Hence, in this paper special double sampling plan under fuzzy environment is studied. The performance measures operating characteristic (OC) function and average outgoing quality (AOQ) functions under fuzzy and non fuzzy environment are evalu-ated and presented...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} variable {{acceptance sampling}} plans {{that control the}} lot or process fraction defective, where a specification limit defines acceptable quality. The problem {{is to find a}} sampling plan that fulfils some conditions, usually on the operation characteristic. Its calculation heavily depends on distributional properties that, in practice, might be doubtful. If prior data are already available, we propose to estimate the sampling plan by means of bootstrap methods. The bias and standard error of the estimated plan can be assessed easily by Monte Carlo approximation to the respective bootstrap moments. This resampling approach does not require strong assumptions and, furthermore, is a flexible method that can be extended to any statistic that might be informative for the fraction <b>defective</b> in a <b>lot.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Batches of {{pharmaceutical}} are sometimes recalled {{from the market}} when a safety issue or a defect is detected in specific production runs of a drug. Such problems are usually detected when patients or healthcare providers report abnormalities to medical authorities. Here we test the hypothesis that <b>defective</b> production <b>lots</b> can be detected earlier by monitoring queries to Internet search engines. We extracted queries from the USA to the Bing search engine which mentioned one of 5, 195 pharmaceutical drugs during 2015 and all recall notifications issued by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) during that year. By using attributes that quantify the change in query volume at the state level, we attempted to predict if a recall of a specific drug will be ordered by FDA in a time horizon ranging from one to 40 days in future. Our results show that future drug recalls can indeed be identified with an AUC of 0. 791 and a lift at 5 % of approximately 6 when predicting a recall will occur one day ahead. This performance degrades as prediction is made for longer periods ahead. The most indicative attributes for prediction are sudden spikes in query volume about a specific medicine in each state. Recalls of prescription drugs and those estimated to be of medium-risk {{are more likely to}} be identified using search query data. These findings suggest that aggregated Internet search engine data can be used to facilitate in early warning of faulty batches of medicines...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a general EOQ model for items that are subject to {{inspection}} for imperfect quality. Each lot that is delivered to the sorting facility undertakes a 100 per cent screening {{and the percentage of}} <b>defective</b> items per <b>lot</b> reduces according to a learning curve. The generality of the model is viewed as important both from an academic and practitioner perspective. The mathematical formulation considers arbitrary functions of time that allow the decision maker to assess the consequences of a diverse range of strategies by employing a single inventory model. A rigorous methodology is utilised to show that the solution is a unique and global optimal and a general step-by-step solution procedure is presented for continuous intra-cycle periodic review applications. The value of the temperature history and flow time through the supply chain is also used to determine an efficient policy. Furthermore, coordination mechanisms that may affect the supplier and the retailer are explored to improve inventory control at both echelons. The paper provides illustrative examples that demonstrate the application of the theoretical model in different settings and lead to the generation of interesting managerial insights...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{study the}} {{economical}} manufacturing quality (EMQ) {{problem in the}} presence of an imperfect process. When the production process goes out of control, the production process produces some proportion of <b>defective</b> items. Thus, <b>lot</b> sizing and periodic inspection of the process are needed to operate the system economically. Performing a preventive maintenance (PM) action immediately after inspection and possible adjustment of the production process will be helpful to enhance the process reliability of a deteriorating production system; thus, an EMQ model for inspection/PM was proposed in the literature. However, {{it is not easy to}} derive the optimal lot sizing and inspection/PM policy simultaneously. Therefore, a two-dimensional search procedure is needed to find the optimal production/PM scheme. In this paper, we study the structural properties of the production/PM problem and show the uniqueness of the optimal inspection interval for a given number of inspections in a production run. To solve the production/PM problem, we provide lower and upper bounds for the optimal inspection interval when the number of inspections is given during a production run and use them to reduce the search ranges in a numerical solution procedure. Also, a criterion for stopping the process of searching for the optimal production/PM policy is provided...|$|R
40|$|Quality {{decisions}} {{are one of}} the major decisions in inventory management. It affects customer’s demand, loyalty and customer satisfaction and also inventory costs. Every manufacturing process is inherent to have some chance causes of variation which may lead to some <b>defectives</b> in the <b>lot.</b> So, in order to cater the customers with faultless products, an inspection process is inevitable, which may also be prone to errors. Thus for an operations manager, maintaining the quality of the lot and the screening process becomes a challenging task, when his objective is to determine the optimal order quantity for the inventory system. Besides these operational tasks, the goal is also to increase the customer base which eventually leads to higher profits. So, as a promotional tool, trade credit is being offered by both the retailer and supplier to their respective customers to encourage more frequent and higher volume purchases. Thus taking into account of these facts, a strategic production model is formulated here to study the combined effects of imperfect quality items, faulty inspection process, rework process, sales return under two level trade credit. The present study is a general framework for many articles and classical EPQ model. An analytical method is employed which jointly optimizes the retailer’s credit period and order quantity, so as to maximize the expected total profit per unit time. To study the behavior and application of the model, a numerical example has been cited and a comprehensive sensitivity analysis has been performed. The model can be widely applicable in manufacturing industries like textile, footwear, plastics, electronics, furniture etc...|$|R
