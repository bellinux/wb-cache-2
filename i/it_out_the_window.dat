5|$|In 1634, another tale with a trickster cat as hero was {{published}} in Giambattista Basile's collection Pentamerone although neither the collection nor the tale were published in France during Perrault's lifetime. In Basile, the lad is a beggar boy called Gagliuso (sometimes Cagliuso) whose fortunes are achieved {{in a manner similar}} to Perrault's Puss. However, the tale ends with Cagliuso, in gratitude to the cat, promising the feline a gold coffin upon his death. Three days later, the cat decides to test Gagliuso by pretending to be dead and is mortified to hear Gagliuso tell his wife to take the dead cat by its paws and throw <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> The cat leaps up, demanding to know whether this was his promised reward for helping the beggar boy to a better life. The cat then rushes away, leaving his master to fend for himself. In another rendition, the cat performs acts of bravery, then a fairy comes and turns him to his normal state to be with other cats.|$|E

500|$|In {{a parody}} of Dead Calm, Homer and Marge set sail on a romantic second honeymoon. Their time {{together}} is interrupted when they rescue a castaway. Introducing himself as Roger, the castaway explains {{that he was a}} chef on a yacht called the Albatross, and was knocked out after attempting to stop a poisoning on his ship. Roger makes them a pie, but Homer becomes convinced that Roger poisoned the guests on the Albatross. He grabs the pie from Marge and throws <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> Marge chastises Homer, but looks out a window and sees a dead shark with the pie pan in its mouth. Homer and Marge take {{matters into their own hands}} as they seemingly kill Roger using a metal pole, and knock his body overboard. However, finding the Albatross, they realize Roger was telling the truth and that some of the passengers are still alive, as one of the people administered an antidote. Roger appears and explains that the shark they saw had died from a fuel leakage from Homer and Marge's boat. Homer then kills Roger, the surviving Albatross crew, and a pelican, to cover their tracks. However, unable to bear the guilt, Marge eats the poisoned pie, much to Homer's horror. The story is then revealed to be Maggie's imagination while she is taking a bath. Homer asks Marge what Maggie thinks about while bathing, which she responds, [...] "Just sugar plums and buttercups." [...] Maggie then shadily moves her eyes (revealing eyeliner over one eye), puts on a hat, and drinks milk like Alex from A Clockwork Orange as the theme from the movie briefly plays in the background.|$|E

In [...] "The Beard", he starts to wear a wig, until Elaine throws <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> in disgust. He also tries to restore his hair in [...] "The Tape", when he starts using a Chinese cream that's said to be such a great cure for baldness that it'll make him [...] "look like Stalin".
