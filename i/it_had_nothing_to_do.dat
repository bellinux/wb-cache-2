25|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} {{interest in the}} faulty air temperature probe (the total air temperature sensor, located {{on the front of}} the aircraft near the cockpit) that initially caused the pilot to turn the plane back for maintenance before the second takeoff attempt. The mechanic simply deactivated the probe because the aircraft's Minimum Equipment List allowed it to be left inoperative. On 22 August investigators interviewed the mechanic, who defended his action by saying that <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the crash. Spanair has supported the mechanic's view that deactivation of the probe is an accepted procedure. On 1 September a report, quoting Spanair, stated that the problem detected on the first takeoff attempt was overheating caused by a temperature gauge's de-icing system, rather than a dysfunction of the temperature gauge itself, and that since icing was not a risk on that flight, the de-icing system had been deactivated by the mechanic with captain's approval.|$|E

Walsh recalled meeting and discovering Murphy: [...] "There was something about him– he was incredibly enigmatic and he would walk into a room with real presence and you'd go, [...] "My God". <b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with those bloody eyes that everyone's going on about all the time." [...] Murphy observed, [...] "I was unbelievably cocky and had nothing to lose, and it suited the part, I suppose." [...] Originally intended to run for three weeks in Cork, Disco Pigs ended up touring throughout Europe, Canada and Australia for two years, and Murphy left both university and his band. Though he had intended to go back to playing music, he secured representation after his first agent caught a performance of Disco Pigs, and his acting career began to take off.|$|E
500|$|According to David Prior, {{producer}} of the subsequent two-disc special edition, the initial bare bones edition [...] "was only reluctantly agreed to by Fincher because I needed {{more time on the}} bonus material. The studio was locked into their release date, so Fincher allowed that version to be released first. <b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with Fincher 'double dipping his own movie before it even makes it to stores' {{and everything to do with}} buying more time for the special edition". He stated that the theatrical cut would only be available on the single-disc edition. Prior elaborated further: [...] "Nobody wants fans feeling like they're being taken advantage of, and I know that double-dipping creates that impression. That's why it was so important to me that consumers be told there was another version coming. In this case it really was a rock-and-a-hard-place situation, and delaying the second release was done strictly for the benefit of the final product... But this is a very ambitious project, easily the most far-reaching I've ever worked on, and owing largely to studio snafus that I can't really elaborate on, I didn't have enough time to do it properly. Thus Fincher bought me the extra time by agreeing to a staggered release, which I'm very grateful for". [...] In its first week, rentals for the DVD earned $6.7 million.|$|E

According to Nielsen Soundscan, Napalm Death sold 367,654 units between May 1991 and November 2003, while Carcass sold 220,374 units in the same period. The inclusion of Napalm Death's [...] "Twist the Knife (Slowly)" [...] on the Mortal Kombat soundtrack brought the band much greater visibility, as the compilation scored a Top 10 position in the Billboard 200 chart and went platinum {{in less than a}} year.< The originators of the style have expressed some ambivalence regarding {{the subsequent}} popularity of grindcore. Pete Hurley, the guitarist of Extreme Noise Terror, declared that he had no interest in being remembered as a pioneer of this style: [...] "'grindcore' was a legendarily stupid term coined by a hyperactive kid from the West Midlands, and <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with us whatsoever. ENT were, are, and - I suspect - always will be a hardcore punk band... not a grindcore band, a stenchcore band, a trampcore band, or any other sub-sub-sub-core genre-defining term you can come up with." [...] Lee Dorian of Napalm Death indicated that [...] "Unfortunately, I think the same thing happened to grindcore, {{if you want to call}} it that, as happened to punk rock - all the great original bands were just plagiarised by a billion other bands who just copied their style identically, making it no longer original and no longer extreme." ...|$|E
500|$|The English {{language}} localization of Dragon Warrior VII began directly {{after the}} game's Japanese release.

Weeks prior to the game's US release, Enix released new information about the game's different mechanics on their website weekly to introduce players to the game. Paul Handelman, president of Enix America, commented on the game that [...] "All the talk this month about new systems with the latest technological wizardry doesn't diminish the fact {{that at the end of}} the day, compelling game play is what it's all about, and Dragon Warrior VII provides just that." [...] Dragon Warrior VII was released in the US on November 1, 2001 and was the last game in the series to have Warrior in its title instead of Quest. In 2003, Square Enix registered the Dragon Quest trademark in the US, with the intent to retire the Dragon Warrior name. Soon after the game's release, developer Heartbeat went on hiatus. Justin Lucas, product manager of Enix America, commented on the hiatus, saying that the developer merely [...] "worked their tails off on Dragon Warrior 7 and Dragon Warrior 4.

500|$|On May 1, 18 {{days after}} the episode's {{original}} airdate, a failed car bomb attempt was discovered by the New York City Police Department near the eastern corner of 1 Astor Plaza in New York City, on West 45 Street, on a side street near {{the location of the}} world headquarters of Viacom, Comedy Central's parent company. Some news outlets reported that police are looking into a possible link between the attempted bombing and the warnings of violence against Trey Parker and Matt Stone, although no such link has yet been established. Such speculation was also fueled by statements from U.S. Congressman Peter T. King, who described as one possible motive [...] "the whole issue with 'South Park,' which Islamic terrorists were threatening to have retribution for." [...] However, King stressed the theory was [...] "one possibility out of a hundred". Revolution Muslim has denied any involvement with the incident.

500|$|In 1982 the Cure {{recorded}} and released Pornography, {{the third and}} final album of an [...] "oppressively dispirited" [...] trio that cemented the Cure's stature as purveyors of the emerging gothic rock genre. Smith has said that during the recording of Pornography he was [...] "undergoing a lot of mental stress. But <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the group, it just had to do with what I was like, my age and things. I think I got to my worst round about Pornography. Looking back and getting other people's opinions of what went on, I was a pretty monstrous sort of person at that time". Gallup described the album by saying, [...] "Nihilism took over [...] We sang 'It doesn't matter if we all die' and that is exactly what we thought at the time." [...] Parry was concerned that the album did not have a hit song for radio play and instructed Smith and producer Phil Thornalley to polish the track [...] "The Hanging Garden" [...] for release as a single. Despite the concerns about the album's uncommercial sound, Pornography became the band's first UK Top 10 album, charting at number eight. The release of Pornography was followed by the Fourteen Explicit Moments tour, where the band finally dropped the anti-image angle and first adopted their signature look of big, towering hair and smeared lipstick on their faces. The tour also saw a series of incidents that prompted Simon Gallup to leave the Cure at the tour's conclusion. Gallup and Smith did not talk to each other for eighteen months following his departure.|$|E
500|$|In November 2009 Loretta {{became the}} centre of media {{controversy}} when various media outlets announced that Loretta {{would be part of}} a storyline which revealed that she had murdered a child in her past. The controversy began when tabloid newspaper The Sun compared the storyline to the real life murder of James Bulger. Bulger had been murdered when he was two years old by two young children. Being just 10 years of age they were handed small sentences to serve and were later released with new identities. Soon afterwards various other news sources and lifestyle magazines picked up the story and mimicked The Sun and its claims. Bulger's mother, Denise Fergus, condemned the storyline. While speaking to the news website Click Liverpool she criticised the decision to air a plot that allegedly mirrored her son's death, stating they should have consulted her first. She said, [...] "I'm shocked and disgusted at what Hollyoaks is doing. They have clearly based this story on what happened to James and it's outrageous that they should do this without consulting with me in any way." [...] She threatened to encourage a boycott of the show. Channel 4 released a statement defending the plot, explaining <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with any real life case: [...] "The forthcoming storyline is not based on any real-life case and it will in no way seek to recreate real events. The storyline focuses on the psychological repercussions for two characters in the show who were {{responsible for the death of}} a 12-year-old girl in the past." [...] The storyline would answer questions for viewers who had been speculating on Loretta's secret past. It would reveal that Loretta had spent time in prison for her crime, was born with the name Joanna Norman, and is living under a false identity.|$|E
500|$|The {{campaign}} {{between the}} two also saw racial dust-ups caused by perceptions of remarks made by campaign surrogates. [...] In March 2008 Ferraro gave {{an interview with the}} Daily Breeze in which she said: [...] "If Obama was a white man, he would not be in this position. And if he was a woman (of any color) he would not be in this position. He happens to be very lucky to be who he is. And the country is caught up in the concept." [...] (Ferraro had made a similar comment in 1988 disparaging Jesse Jackson's candidacy in the party's presidential primaries, saying that because of his [...] "radical" [...] views, [...] "if Jesse Jackson were not black, he wouldn't be in the race.") Ferraro justified the statements by referring to her own run for vice president. Echoing a statement she wrote about herself in 1988, Ferraro said that [...] "I was talking about historic candidacies and what I started off by saying (was that) {{if you go back to}} 1984 and look at my historic candidacy, which I had just talked about all these things, in 1984, if my name was Gerard Ferraro instead of Geraldine Ferraro, I would have never been chosen as a vice-presidential candidate. <b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with my qualification." [...] Her comments resonated with some older white women, but generated an immediate backlash elsewhere. There was strong criticism and charges of racism from many supporters of Obama and Obama called them [...] "patently absurd". Clinton publicly expressed disagreement with Ferraro's remarks, while Ferraro vehemently denied she was a racist. Again speaking to the Breeze, Ferraro responded to the attacks by saying: [...] "I really think they're attacking me because I'm white. How's that?" [...] Ferraro resigned from Clinton's finance committee on , 2008, two days after the firestorm began, saying that she didn't want the Obama camp to use her comments to hurt Clinton's campaign.|$|E
