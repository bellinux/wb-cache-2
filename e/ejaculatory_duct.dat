5|$|For males, the {{reproductive}} {{system is the}} testis, suspended in the body cavity by tracheae and the fat body. Most male insects have a pair of testes, inside of which are sperm tubes or follicles that are enclosed within a membranous sac. The follicles connect to the vas deferens by the vas efferens, and the two tubular vasa deferentia connect to a median <b>ejaculatory</b> <b>duct</b> {{that leads to the}} outside. A portion of the vas deferens is often enlarged to form the seminal vesicle, which stores the sperm before they are discharged into the female. The seminal vesicles have glandular linings that secrete nutrients for nourishment and maintenance of the sperm. The <b>ejaculatory</b> <b>duct</b> is derived from an invagination of the epidermal cells during development and, as a result, has a cuticular lining. The terminal portion of the <b>ejaculatory</b> <b>duct</b> may be sclerotized to form the intromittent organ, the aedeagus. The remainder of the male reproductive system is derived from embryonic mesoderm, except for the germ cells, or spermatogonia, which descend from the primordial pole cells very early during embryogenesis.|$|E

The vesicles produce semenogelin, a protein that causes semen to become sticky and jelly-like after ejaculation.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES To {{describe}} the prostatic and vesiculo-deferential lesions identified by ultrasound {{that may be}} the cause of masculine infertility in Cameroon. METHODS We conducted a descriptive cross sectional study in Yaounde between January and December 2012. Eligible patients were men who came for the management of masculine infertility. Clinical and biochemical tests were performed, along with transrectal prostate ultrasound. Recorded lesions were: cyst of the median zone of the prostate, dilation of the <b>ejaculatory</b> <b>ducts</b> greater than 2 mm, calcifications in the <b>ejaculatory</b> <b>ducts,</b> dilation of the seminal vesicles (antero-posterior diameter greater than 15 mm), hypoplasia or agenesis of th...|$|R
25|$|The sexes are {{distinct}} (females and males occur). Reproductive system: The penis is broad and blunt, has a weakly marked lateral lobe on its left side near the apex, {{a very small}} stylet, a penial duct running in a zigzag, and no visible trace of an <b>ejaculatory</b> <b>duct.</b> The female reproductive organs are of Hauffenia-type.|$|E
25|$|In {{the male}} the duct persists, and forms the tube of the epididymis, the ductus deferens and the <b>ejaculatory</b> <b>duct,</b> while the seminal vesicle arises {{during the third}} month as a lateral {{diverticulum}} from its hinder end. A {{large part of the}} head end of the mesonephros atrophies and disappears; of the remainder the anterior tubules form the efferent ducts of the testis; while the posterior tubules are represented by the ductuli aberrantes, and by the paradidymis, which is sometimes found in front of the spermatic cord above the head of the epididymis.|$|E
25|$|The male’s main {{reproductive}} {{function is}} to produce and store spermatozoa and provide transport to the reproductive tract of the female. Sperm development is usually completed {{by the time the}} insect reaches adulthood. The male has two testes, which contain follicles in which the spermatozoa are produced. These open separately into the sperm duct or vas deferens and this stores the sperm. The vas deferentia then unite posteriorally to form a central <b>ejaculatory</b> <b>duct,</b> this opens to the outside on an aedeagus or a penis. Accessory glands secrete fluids that comprise the spermatophore. This becomes a package that surrounds and carries the spermatozoa, forming a sperm-containing capsule.|$|E
25|$|In males, the Müllerian duct-inhibiting hormone MIH causes this {{duct system}} to regress. Next, androgens cause the {{development}} of the Wolffian duct system, which develops into the vas deferens, seminal vesicles, and <b>ejaculatory</b> <b>ducts.</b>|$|R
40|$|Cadherins {{constitute}} {{a family of}} calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion molecules the individual members of which are essential for the sorting of cells into tissues during development. In this study, we examined the expression of E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and P-cadherin in tissues obtained from radical prostatectomies. Epithelial cells of prostatic glands, <b>ejaculatory</b> <b>ducts,</b> and seminal vesicles expressed E-cadherin but not N-cadherin. P-cadherin was expressed in epithelial cells of the seminal vesicles and <b>ejaculatory</b> <b>ducts.</b> In the prostate it {{was limited to the}} basal cells of prostatic acini, glands with basal cell hyperplasia, and atrophic glands denuded of the luminal cells. All P-cadherin-positive cells were negative for prostatic-specific antigen. Prostatic cancers were mostly P-cadherin negative, but some tumors had P-cadherin-positive areas frequently located close to <b>ejaculatory</b> <b>ducts</b> and negative for prostatic-specific antigen. The mutually exclusive expression of P-cadherin and prostatic-specific antigen suggests that these proteins are involved in differential mechanisms of cell regulation in prostate cancer. P-cadherin may become a useful marker in the diagnosis and management of patients with prostate cancer and low levels of prostatic-specific antigen...|$|R
25|$|The {{excretory}} duct of each seminal gland unites {{with the}} corresponding vas deferens {{to form the}} two <b>ejaculatory</b> <b>ducts,</b> which immediately pass through {{the substance of the}} prostate gland before opening separately into the verumontanum of the prostatic urethra.|$|R
25|$|Most {{nematode}} {{species are}} dioecious, with separate {{male and female}} individuals, though some, such as Caenorhabditis elegans, are androdioecious, consisting of hermaphrodites and rare males. Both sexes possess one or two tubular gonads. In males, the sperm are produced {{at the end of}} the gonad and migrate along its length as they mature. The testis opens into a relatively wide seminal vesicle and then during intercourse into a glandular and muscular <b>ejaculatory</b> <b>duct</b> associated with the vas deferens and cloaca. In females, the ovaries each open into an oviduct (in hermaphrodites, the eggs enter a spermatheca first) and then a glandular uterus. The uteri both open into a common vulva/ vagina, usually located in the middle of the morphologically ventral surface.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{component}} of the male reproductive system is the testis, suspended in the body cavity by tracheae and the fat body. The more primitive apterygote insects have a single testis, and in some lepidopterans the two maturing testes are secondarily fused into one structure during the later stages of larval development, although the ducts leading from them remain separate. However, most male insects have a pair of testes, inside of which are sperm tubes or follicles that are enclosed within a membranous sac. The follicles connect to the vas deferens by the vas efferens, and the two tubular vasa deferentia connect to a median <b>ejaculatory</b> <b>duct</b> {{that leads to the}} outside.
