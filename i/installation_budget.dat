40|$|From {{a series}} of {{nationwide}} plant surveys dedicated to spill prevention, containment and countermeasure evaluation, coupled with spill response action activities, a need was determined for a spill prevention guideline manual. From Federally accumulated statistics for oil and hazardous substance spills, the authors culled information on spills of hydrocarbon products. In 1978, a total of 1456 oil spills were reported compared to 1451 in 1979. The 1978 spills were more severe, however, since 7; 289, 163 gallons of oil were accident~y discharged. In 1979, the gallons spilled was reduced to 3, 663, 473. These figures are derived from reported spills; it is highly possible that an equal amount was spilled and not reported. Spills effectively contained within a plant property that do not enter a n~vigational waterway need not be reported. Needless to say, {{there is a tremendous}} annual loss of oil products due to accidental spillage during transportation, cargo transfer, bulk storage and processing. As an aid to plant engineers and managers, Fe~eral workers, fire marshalls and fire and casualty insurance inspectors, the documen~ is offered as a spill prevention guide. The'manual defines state-of-the-art spill prevention practices and automation techniques that can reduce spills caused by human error. Whenever practical, the cost of implementation is provided to aid equipment acquisition and <b>installation</b> <b>budgeting.</b> To emphasize the need for spill prevention activities, historic spills are briefly described after which remedial action is defined in an appropriate section of the manual. The section on plant security goes into considerable depth since to date no Federal agency or traqe association has provided industry with guidelines on this important phase of plant operation. The intent of the document is to provide finger-tip reference material that can be used by interested parties in a nationwide effort to reduce loss of oil from preventable spills...|$|R

40|$|Problem statement: Wireless access {{networks}} can provide {{high level of}} quality of services at low network <b>installation</b> <b>budget</b> if the networks are planned by using proper methods. In this research, we developed efficient network planning methods for Wireless Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) networks in which the multiple hops of relay stations are deployed. Approach: An integer linear programming model {{was applied to the}} proposed problems for WiMAX networks. Our key contribution of the proposed model is two-fold. First, it aims at maximizing the quality of services of the networks, including the physical data rate and the received signal strength. Second, it aims at minimizing the cost to install the networks. The output from the proposed model is the optimal locations for the installation of the WiMAX base stations and the relay stations so that the network can accommodate user traffic demand over the target service area. Results: To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model, we conducted numerical experiments in the real network service environments. Conclusion: Applying our proposed model, performances of WiMAX networks can be improved in both the physical data rate and the service coverage area...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} novel {{optimization}} model {{to maximize the}} power system observability by placing phasor mea-surement units (PMUs) in a multistage manner. The problem is constrained by the financial budgets available at each <b>installation</b> stage. The <b>budget</b> may be spent on purchasing and installing new PMUs and relocating PMUs already installed in the power system. This problem {{is very difficult to}} solve when the problem size becomes big. Therefore, a newly developed meta-heuristic, called chemical reaction optimization (CRO), is used to solve this optimal multistage PMU placement problem (OMPP), and numerical studies are carried out on the IEEE 57 -bus, 118 -bus, and 300 -bus systems.

The commander-in-chief of the Ohio Army National Guard {{is the governor}} of the state of Ohio. If the Ohio Army National Guard is called to federal service, then the commander-in-chief becomes the President of the United States. The military commander of all forces in the State of Ohio is the Adjutant General, Major General Deborah A. Ashenhurst (the first woman to hold this position) is responsible for the command of 17,000 members, preparedness and readiness, <b>installation</b> management, and <b>budget</b> of the Ohio National Guard. The current Assistant Adjutant General for Army, with responsibility for overseeing the Ohio Army National Guard training and operations, is Major General John C. Harris Jr. The current Assistant Adjutant General for Air is Brigadier General Stephen E Markovich, with responsibility for overseeing the Ohio Air National Guard. Ohio Army and Air National Guard units can be mobilized at any time by {{the governor of the}} State of Ohio upon declaration of a state of emergency or by the presidential order to supplement regular armed federal forces. Unlike Army Reserve members, National Guard members cannot be mobilized individually (except through voluntary transfers and temporary duty assignment (TDY), but only as part of their respective units. However, there has been a significant amount of individual activations to support military operations since 2001. The legality of this policy has been a source of contention in some quarters. The Ohio Military Reserve and the Ohio Naval Militia constitute Ohio's state defense force, and augment the Ohio National Guard during stateside missions, especially when units of the National Guard are federalized.|$|R
