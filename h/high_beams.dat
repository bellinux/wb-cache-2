These hidden lights may not be apparent until they are activated. Additionally, some of the standard lights fitted to an ambulance (e.g. headlamps, tail lamps) may be programmed to flash. Flashing headlights (typically the <b>high</b> <b>beams,</b> flashed alternately) are known as a wig-wag.|$|E

40|$|Summary Visibility {{distances}} to obstacles {{on the right}} hand side of a straight two-lane road have been obtained. In <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> with opposing <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> of about the same intensity there are {{no significant differences in}} the visibility distance as a function of <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> intensity over about 50000 cd. In <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> with opposing <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> of intensity about three times as large or more there is a large loss in visibility distance (> 35 %) compared with the situation above. The optimum distance for switching from <b>high</b> to low <b>beam</b> varied between 250 m and 400 m when the two opposing vehicles had about the same <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> intensity. In <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> without opposing glare there is very little gain in visibility in relation to the amount of increase of intensity above 50 000 cd. ...|$|R

25|$|In 2005, the CR-V {{received}} a mid-cycle refresh. The 2005 CR-V was now equipped with 16inch wheels, the earlier models had 15inch wheels. Visual changes included new taillights and headlights with clear indicators. The new headlights now have two separate H1 bulbs for low beams and <b>high</b> <b>beams,</b> the previous setup used H4 single bulb for both low and <b>high</b> <b>beams.</b> The taillights now used clear lenses instead of amber for the turning indicators. The grille was also changed; it had two horizontal bars instead of one. The front bumper design was slightly changed, {{it now has}} round fog lights compared to the previous rectangle fog lights {{and in addition to}} the lower grill there are two horizontal bars instead of one. The rear bumper reflectors were longer and narrower.|$|E
25|$|Continual {{flashing}} of headlights or <b>high</b> <b>beams</b> after {{emerging from}} {{around a corner}} beside a high wall or from any roadway out of sight to oncoming traffic will alert a truck driver in the oncoming lanes to an accident or other obstruction ahead and will warn him to reduce speed or to proceed with caution.|$|E

50|$|At {{the same}} time, {{automatic}} beam switching (High-Beam Assistant) was introduced. This system detects oncoming light sources to automatically engage the <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> lights in dark areas and then dip the <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> lights to avoid dazzling oncoming traffic.|$|R
25|$|Headlight {{flashing}} is the act {{of either}} briefly switching on the headlights of a car, or of momentarily switching between a headlight's <b>high</b> <b>beams</b> and low beams, {{in an effort to}} communicate with another driver or drivers. The signal is sometimes referred to in car manufacturers' manuals as an optical horn, since it draws the attention of other drivers.|$|E
25|$|In Arizona, {{flashing}} <b>high</b> <b>beams</b> or headlights is {{a violation}} of A.R.S. Section 28-942.1 (Failure to Dim Headlights). However, A.R.S. Section 28-942.2. states: If the driver of a vehicle follows another vehicle within two hundred feet to the rear, except when engaged in the act of overtaking and passing, the driver shall use a distribution of light permissible under this article other than the uppermost distribution of light specified in section 28-941, paragraph 1.|$|E
25|$|Headlight {{flashing}} {{might have}} come into more common use {{as a means of}} attempting driver-to-driver communication by the mid-1970s, when cars began to come with headlight beam selectors located on the steering column—typically activated by pulling the turn signal stalk—rather than the previous foot-operated pushbutton switches. The signal stalk configuration was later wired to permit the momentary activation of the <b>high</b> <b>beams</b> regardless of whether the headlamp switch was turned on or off.|$|E

25|$|Adaptive Highbeam Assist is Mercedes-Benz' {{marketing}} {{name for}} a headlight control strategy that continuously automatically tailors the headlamp range so the beam just reaches other vehicles ahead, thus always ensuring maximum possible seeing range without glaring other road users. It was first launched in the Mercedes E-class in 2009. It provides a continuous range of beam reach from a low-aimed low beam to a high-aimed high beam, rather than the traditional binary choice between low and <b>high</b> <b>beams.</b>|$|E
25|$|Hella {{introduced}} ellipsoidal optics for acetylene headlamps in 1911, but {{following the}} electrification of vehicle lighting, this optical technique wasn't used for many decades. The first modern polyellipsoidal (projector) automotive lamp was the Super-Lite, an auxiliary headlamp produced {{in a joint}} venture between Chrysler Corporation and Sylvania and optionally installed in 1969 and 1970 full-size Dodge automobiles. It used an 85 watt transverse-filament tungsten-halogen bulb and was intended as a mid-beam, to extend the reach of the low beams during turnpike travel when low beams alone were inadequate but <b>high</b> <b>beams</b> would produce excessive glare.|$|E
25|$|An example {{arrangement}} {{includes the}} stacking of two headlamps {{on each side}} with low beams above <b>high</b> <b>beams.</b> Nash used this arrangement in the 1957 model year. Pontiac used this design starting in the 1963 model year; American Motors, Ford, Cadillac and Chrysler followed two years later. Also in the 1965 model year, the Buick Riviera had concealable stacked headlamps. The Mercedes-Benz W100, W108, W111, and W112 models sold in America used this arrangement because their home-market composite lamps were illegal in the US. The British firm Alvis and the French firm Facel Vega also used this setup for some of their cars, as did Nissan in Japan.|$|E

25|$|In Ohio, {{courts have}} held {{that the act of}} {{flashing}} one's headlights so as to alert oncoming drivers of a radar trap does not constitute the offense of obstructing a police officer in the performance of his duties, where there was no proof that the warned vehicles were speeding prior to the warning. In another case, where a driver received a citation under an ordinance prohibiting flashing lights on a vehicle, a court held that the ordinance referred to the noun of flashing lights and did not prohibit the verb of flashing the headlights on a vehicle. In a different case, a court held that a momentary flick of the <b>high</b> <b>beams</b> is not a violation of Ohio R.C. 4513.15 (which prohibits drivers from aiming glaring rays into the eyes of oncoming drivers).|$|E
25|$|Bike racks {{were tested}} at Wilson garage during 2005 and 2006 using the Orion V, VI and later VII bus models. TTC staff {{concluded}} that the pilot project was not a success and {{that it should be}} discontinued, but the Commission disagreed, and voted to not only continue it, but to direct that bike racks would be installed on all new buses starting in 2007. The Commission then directed staff to look into the cost of retrofitting the entire bus fleet with bike racks. The original bike rack model will not be used on newer buses, due to it blocking the <b>high</b> <b>beams</b> on the Orion VII, and a different model from the same manufacturer will be used starting on 2007 deliveries. None of this was included in the five-year capital budget.|$|E
25|$|Glare-free {{high beam}} is a camera-driven dynamic {{lighting}} control strategy that selectively shades spots and slices {{out of the}} high beam pattern to protect other road users from glare, while always providing the driver with maximum seeing range. The area surrounding other road users is constantly illuminated at high beam intensity, but without the glare that would result from using uncontrolled <b>high</b> <b>beams</b> in traffic. This constantly changing beam pattern requires complex sensors, microprocessors and actuators, because the vehicles which must be shadowed out of the beam are constantly moving. The dynamic shadowing can be achieved with movable shadow masks shifted within the light path inside the headlamp. Or, the effect {{can be achieved by}} selectively darkening addressable LED emitters or reflector elements, a technique known as 'Pixel light'.|$|E

40|$|The {{design of}} a high-luminosity e+e- collider, {{referred}} to as a “factory, ” involves significant physics and technology challenges. One category of physics challenges is related to the design of low-beta optics to tightly focus the two beams and steer them into separate rings while maintaining reasonable chromaticity, avoiding problems with parasitic beam-beam collisions, and minimizing detector backgrounds. A second category of physics issues involves beam instabilities associated with producing the required luminosity by means of very <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> currents and many bunches. Technology issues are also important. <b>High</b> <b>beam</b> currents give rise to substantial photodesorption gas loads and, at high energies, substantial thermal loads as well.

25|$|Trolls are {{the least}} {{intelligent}} of the non-magical creatures. Most of their decisions are based on their instincts. They are quick for their size and have large serrated tusks which produce a narcotic venom which renders the prey mindlessly—and defenselessly—happy. If they can, their preferred kill tactic is to slip their claws under the rib cage and pop the heart out before the muscles have time to tense up, rendering the meat mostly unharmed and tender. They have an extreme aversion to light, noise, and water. The largest pack of trolls were seen in the Eleven Wonders of the World Exhibit in a run-down part of Haven. Very few people have ever managed to single-handedly down a troll. Holly Short once did it with her helmet's eight-hundred-watt <b>high</b> <b>beams,</b> {{the shock of the}} light rendering the troll unconscious. Domovoi Butler became the only human ever to do so with a combination of medieval weaponry and modern combat techniques.|$|E
25|$|Each {{system has}} its {{advantages}} and disadvantages. The American system historically permitted a greater overall {{amount of light}} within the low beam, since the entire reflector and lens area is used, {{but at the same}} time, the American system has traditionally offered much less control over upward light that causes glare, and for that reason has been largely rejected outside the US. In addition, the American system makes it difficult to create markedly different low and high beam light distributions. The high beam is usually a rough copy of the low beam, shifted slightly upward and leftward. The European system traditionally produced low beams containing less overall light, because only 60% of the reflector's surface area is used to create the low beam. However, low beam focus and glare control are easier to achieve. In addition, the lower 40% of the reflector and lens are reserved for high beam formation, which facilitates the optimization of both low and <b>high</b> <b>beams.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 2013 {{the first}} {{digitally}} controlled, full-LED glare-free adaptive highbeam is introduced by Audi on the facelifted Audi A8, with 25 individual LED segments (Matrix LED). The system dims light that would shine directly onto oncoming and preceding vehicles, but continues to cast its full {{light on the}} zones between and beside them. This works because the LED <b>high</b> <b>beams</b> are split into numerous individual light-emitting diodes. High-beam LEDs in both headlights are arranged in a matrix and adapt fully electronically to the surroundings in milliseconds. They are activated and deactivated or dimmed individually by a control unit. In addition, the headlights also function as a cornering light. Using predictive route data supplied by the MMI navigation plus, {{the focus of the}} beam is shifted towards the bend even before the driver turns the steering wheel. In 2014: Mercedes-Benz introduced a similar technology on the facelifted CLS-Class in 2014, called MULTIBEAM LED, with 24 individual segments.|$|E
