5|$|Fund {{accounting}} is {{an accounting}} system for recording resources whose use {{has been limited}} by the donor, grant authority, governing agency, or other individuals or organisations or by law. <b>It</b> <b>emphasizes</b> accountability rather than profitability, and is used by Nonprofit organizations and by governments. In this method, a fund consists of a self-balancing set of accounts and each are reported as either unrestricted, temporarily restricted or permanently restricted based on the provider-imposed restrictions.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} critiques {{of the theory}} from several perspectives. Arguments include that <b>it</b> <b>emphasizes</b> justice to the {{exclusion}} of other moral values, such as caring; that there is such an overlap between stages that they should more properly be regarded as separate domains; or that evaluations of the reasons for moral choices are mostly post hoc rationalizations (by both decision makers and psychologists studying them) of essentially intuitive decisions.|$|E
5|$|Another early {{example is}} the 1981 Atari 2600 game Haunted House. Gameplay is typical of future {{survival}} horror titles, as <b>it</b> <b>emphasizes</b> puzzle-solving and evasive action, rather than violence. The game uses monsters commonly featured in horror fiction, such as bats and ghosts, {{each of which has}} unique behaviors. Gameplay also incorporates item collection and inventory management, along with areas that are inaccessible until the appropriate item is found. Because it has several features that have been seen in later survival horror games, some reviewers have retroactively classified this game as the first in the genre.|$|E

50|$|The Penitential Rite at the {{beginning}} of the Mass is a liturgical rudiment of this previously sacramental confession. This private confession became the normal way in which this sacrament was and is practiced, with a strict seal of secrecy on the part of the priest. Sometimes the practice of the sacrament emphasized doing acts of penance, sometimes <b>it</b> <b>emphasized</b> making one's sorrow or contrition authentic, sometimes <b>it</b> <b>emphasized</b> confessing all one's serious (mortal) sins, sometimes <b>it</b> <b>emphasized</b> the power of the priest, In Persona Christi, to absolve the penitent of sin, and currently there are forms that include simply one-on-one confession to a priest or communal preparation and then one-on-one confession to a priest.|$|R

5|$|The play The Reckoning of Kit and Little Boots, by Nat Cassidy, {{examines}} {{the lives of}} the Elizabethan playwright Christopher Marlowe and Caligula, with the fictional conceit that Marlowe was working on a play about Caligula around the time of his own murder. <b>It</b> <b>emphasizes</b> the similarities between the two characters—both stabbed to death at 29, both in part {{as a result of their}} controversial religious perspectives. The play focuses on Caligula's love for his sister Drusilla and his deep-rooted loathing for Tiberius. It received its world premiere in New York City in June 2008.|$|E
5|$|One {{criticism}} of Kohlberg's {{theory is that}} <b>it</b> <b>emphasizes</b> justice {{to the exclusion of}} other values, and so may not adequately address the arguments of those who value other moral aspects of actions. Carol Gilligan has argued that Kohlberg's theory is overly androcentric. Kohlberg's theory was initially developed based on empirical research using only male participants; Gilligan argued that it did not adequately describe the concerns of women. Kohlberg stated that women tend to get stuck at level 3, focusing on details of how to maintain relationships and promote the welfare of family and friends. Men are likely {{to move on to the}} abstract principles, and thus have less concern with the particulars of who is involved. Consistent with this observation, Gilligan's theory of moral development does not focus on the value of justice. She developed an alternative theory of moral reasoning based on the ethics of caring. Critics such as Christina Hoff Sommers, however, argued that Gilligan's research is ill-founded, and that no evidence exists to support her conclusion.|$|E
5|$|One {{definition}} sees language {{primarily as}} the mental faculty that allows humans to undertake linguistic behaviour: to learn languages and {{to produce and}} understand utterances. This definition stresses the universality of language to all humans, and <b>it</b> <b>emphasizes</b> the biological basis for the human capacity for language as a unique development of the human brain. Proponents of {{the view that the}} drive to language acquisition is innate in humans argue that this is supported by the fact that all cognitively normal children raised in an environment where language is accessible will acquire language without formal instruction. Languages may even develop spontaneously in environments where people live or grow up together without a common language; for example, creole languages and spontaneously developed sign languages such as Nicaraguan Sign Language. This view, which {{can be traced back to}} the philosophers Kant and Descartes, understands language to be largely innate, for example, in Chomsky's theory of Universal Grammar, or American philosopher Jerry Fodor's extreme innatist theory. These kinds of definitions are often applied in studies of language within a cognitive science framework and in neurolinguistics.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} the topic of various {{research}} studies to establish that organizational effectiveness depends on the creativity of the workforce to a large extent. For any given organization, measures of effectiveness vary, depending upon its mission, environmental context, nature of work, the product or service it produces, and customer demands. Thus, {{the first step in}} evaluating organizational effectiveness is to understand the organization itself — how it functions, how it is structured, and what <b>it</b> <b>emphasizes.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{self-determination}} theory (SDT) {{was developed}} by psychologists Edward Deci and Richard Ryan. SDT focuses {{on the importance of}} intrinsic and extrinsic motivation in driving human behavior and posits inherent growth and development tendencies. <b>It</b> <b>emphasizes</b> the degree to which an individual's behavior is self-motivated and self-determined. When applied to the realm of education, the self-determination theory is concerned primarily with promoting in students an interest in learning, a value of education, and a confidence in their own capacities and attributes.|$|E

25|$|The type of {{construction}} grammar associated with linguists like Goldberg and Lakoff looks mainly at the external relations {{of construction}}s {{and the structure of}} constructional networks.
