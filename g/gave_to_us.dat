2500|$|Larry Dell Alexander (born May 30, 1953) is an American artist, Christian {{author and}} Catechist from Dermott, Arkansas in Chicot County. Alexander {{is best known}} for his creations of {{elaborate}} colorful, and black & white [...] "pen and ink" [...] drawings in his [...] "crosshatching", or [...] "hatching" [...] technique, and his acrylic paintings. He also received notoriety and a personal presidential thanks for his personal rendition of a [...] "Clinton Family Portrait" [...] oil painting which he <b>gave</b> <b>to</b> <b>U.S.</b> President Bill Clinton in 1995. It is now a part of the collection at the Clinton Presidential Library in Little Rock, Arkansas. He is also known for the Arkansas Schools Tours that he did between 1996 and 2006. He has written nine devotional Bible studies commentaries on several New Testament books and one on the Old Testament book of Ezekiel of the Christian Bible, and has also created many drawings and paintings with strong Christian themes over the years. However, in recent years he is perhaps better known for his writings and teachings on Christianity ...|$|E

It also unveils the foundation of the rational order, which is <b>given</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> in the discovery of the first principles of the existence of being and of cognition. Metaphysics provides us also with knowledge concerning the structure of being. It shows us being as composite and plural; being which is “insufficient” in its structure and calls for an explanation.

The good horses that we rode from the last post they <b>gave</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> by the King's command, together with the sumpter beasts, since horses broken to the saddle were {{hard to come by}} in Egypt where they were trained to draw chariots. These we took, sending back my thanks to the King, and started on once more, Bes leading that beast which bore the gold and the hunters serving as a guard.|$|E
6000|$|The {{first thing}} that Mr. Hastings brings forward in his defence is, that, whereas the Company were obliged to pay a certain tribute to the Mogul, in {{consideration}} of a grant by which the Moguls <b>gave</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> the legal title under which we hold the provinces of Bengal, Bahar, and Orissa, he did stop the payment of that tribute, or acknowledgment, small as it was,--that, though bound by a treaty recognized by the Company and recognized by the nation, though bound by the very sunnud by which he held the very office he was exercising, yet he had broken the treaty, and refused to pay the stipulated acknowledgment. Where are we, my Lords? Is this merit? Good God Almighty! the greatest blockhead, the most ignorant, miserable wretch, a person without either virtue or talents, {{has nothing to do}} but to order a clerk to strike a pen through such an account, and then to make a merit of it to you. [...] "Oh!" [...] says he, [...] "I have by a mere breach of your faith, by a single dash of my pen, saved you all this money which you were bound to pay. I have exonerated you from the payment of it. I have gained you 250,000l. a year forever. Will you not reward a person who did you such a great and important service, by conniving a little at his delinquencies?" ...|$|E
60|$|Even {{this was}} not the worst of it. I disliked the abstruse studies of my new profession; but I {{absolutely}} hated the diurnal slavery of qualifying myself, in a social point of view, for future success in it. My fond medical parent insisted on introducing me to his whole connection. I went round visiting in the neat brougham--with a stethoscope and medical review in the front-pocket, with Doctor Softly by my side, keeping his face well in view at the window--to canvass for patients, in the character of my father's hopeful successor. Never have I been so ill at ease in prison, as I was in that carriage. I have felt more at home in the dock (such is the natural depravity and perversity of my disposition) than ever I felt in the drawing-rooms of my father's distinguished patrons and respectable friends. Nor did my miseries end with the morning calls. I was commanded to attend all dinner-parties, and to make myself agreeable at all balls. The dinners were the worst trial. Sometimes, indeed, we contrived to get ourselves asked to the houses of high and mighty entertainers, where we ate the finest French dishes and drank the oldest vintages, and fortified ourselves sensibly and snugly in that way against the frigidity of the company. Of these repasts I have no hard words to say; it is of the dinners we gave ourselves, and of the dinners which people in our rank of life <b>gave</b> <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> that I now bitterly complain.|$|E

6000|$|... "Let any one sit on {{the hill}} of the little church of St. Martin, and look on the view which is there spread before his eyes. Immediately below are the towers of the great abbey of St. Augustine, where Christian {{learning}} and civilization first struck root in the Anglo-Saxon race; and within which now, after a lapse of many centuries, a new institution has arisen, intended to carry far and wide, to countries of which Gregory and Augustine never heard, the blessings which they <b>gave</b> <b>to</b> <b>us.</b> Carry your view on--and there rises high above all the magnificent pile of our cathedral, equal in splendour and state to any, the noblest temple or church that Augustine could have seen in ancient Rome, rising on the very ground which derives its consecration from him. And still more than {{the grandeur of the}} outward buildings that rose from the little church of Augustine and the little palace of Ethelbert have been the institutions of all kinds of which these were the earliest cradle. From Canterbury, the first English Christian city,--from Kent, the first English Christian kingdom--has by degrees arisen the whole constitution of Church and State in England which now binds together the whole British Empire. And from the Christianity here established in England has flowed, by direct consequence, first the Christianity of Germany; then, after a long interval, of North America; and lastly, we may trust, in time, of all India and all Australasia. The view from St. Martin's Church is indeed one of the most inspiriting that {{can be found in the}} world; there is none to which I would more willingly take any one who doubted whether a small beginning could lead to a great and lasting good;--none which carries us more vividly back into the past, or more hopefully forward into the future." ...|$|E

Interrupt me not--I question not your will to be both; {{but you have}} hitherto neither had the light nor the opportunity necessary for the display of your principles, or the service of your country. You have lived when an apathy of mind, succeeding to the agitations of the Civil War, had made men indifferent to state affairs, and more willing to cultivate their own ease, than {{to stand in the}} gap when the Lord was pleading with Israel. But we are Englishmen; and with us such unnatural lethargy cannot continue long. Already, many of those who most desired the return of Charles Stewart, regard him as a King whom Heaven, importuned by our entreaties, <b>gave</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> in His anger. His unlimited licence--and example so readily followed by the young and the gay around him--has disgusted the minds of all sober and thinking men. I had not now held conference with you in this intimate fashion, were I not aware that you, Master Julian, were free from such stain of the times. Heaven, that rendered the King's course of license fruitful, had denied issue to his bed of wedlock; and in the gloomy and stern character of his bigoted successor, we already see what sort of monarch shall succeed to the crown of England. This is a critical period, at which it necessarily becomes the duty of all men to step forward, each in his degree, and aid in rescuing the country which gave us birth."

40|$|Abstract: The {{consideration}} of the N-body gravitational problem equations can <b>give</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> some class of boundary-value problems defined on the ”beem’s” construction. One can considere it as weak or so-called finite element method’s approximation with the linear function’s basis. So there are time and coordinate dependent beems as distances between points and unknown coordinate functions which are defined on the beems. The possible sample from this class is simple Lalplas equation where potential energy are maximal. Some computer simulations can <b>give</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> symmetries on spherical coordinates (similar for well known mathematical structures- configurations like Pascal or Desargus configurations). But in other hand, the {{consideration of}} the natural mass distribution can <b>give</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> evidence of the physical reality of the similar structures on the star sphere.
