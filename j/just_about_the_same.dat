500|$|The {{film was}} {{originally}} {{supposed to have}} been shot on film, though a last-minute change by the studio helped introduce a different technology. In 1997, during pre-production on Henry Selick's feature, Monkeybone, the film's cinematographer Pete Kozachik was looking for a type of filming that would streamline the process of integrating stop-motion characters with pre-filmed live actors. After finishing Monkeybone, Kozachik continued to test cameras for a practical means of shooting feature animation digitally. In early 2003, the production unit was not interested in digital capture for stop motion; the team was instead prepping the movie for a film shoot. Two weeks before filming was to begin, Kozachik and visual effects consultant Chris Watts came up with a solution using digital still cameras that was deemed viable by Warner Bros. senior vice president of physical production and visual effects Chris DeFaria. The production then became digital. After testing a dozen different models, Kozachik opted for a basic digital still camera, the Canon EOS-1D Mark II, an off-the-shelf model that was outfitted with adapters to allow the use of Nikon prime lenses (14mm-105mm). Kozachik spoke about why he chose the camera, saying: [...] "One reason I went with this particular camera is that its image chip is <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> size as Super 35 film negative, so we could use Nikon lenses and treat them like regular 35mm cine lenses and get the same effect—the same depth of field and angle of coverage. I knew {{that we were going to}} be fighting to make this look like a 'real' movie because we weren't shooting on film, so I wanted to at least have the optics look like movie optics." ...|$|E

30|$|This {{apparently}} surprising {{result can}} be explained by the opening mechanisms of both valves, and the operation principles of the Stark decelerator. The NPV is activated using only small voltages, and a moderate power of about 1 W is dissipated in the valve. This results in only a modest change of the beam’s mean speed during the opening of the valve, i.e., the beam that is formed when the valve <b>just</b> opens is <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as <b>the</b> mean speed that is found at later times. This behavior is very different for the JV. Here, large currents are needed to open the valve, resulting in significant power dissipation (about 20 W) and a hot valve body. Moreover, as the valve opens, gas flows through the hot current conductors, locally cooling the conductors. As a result, the mean speed of the beam shows a strong gradient during the valve opening time [42]. When the valve just opens, the beam is very fast. The later the molecules leave the valve, the lower their mean speed will be. The slowest mean speeds are found when the valve is almost fully closed. Here, beam speeds that are expected for room temperature expansions are found [42].|$|R
60|$|A {{situation}} so precarious and so unedifying {{was sure}} to lead to strange results in the relations of parties and leaders. In July 1843 the Speaker told Hobhouse that Peel had lost all following and authority; all but votes. Hobhouse meeting a tory friend told him that Sir Robert had got nothing but his majority. 'He won't have that long,' the tory replied. 'Who will make sacrifices for such a fellow? They call me a frondeur, {{but there are many}} such. Peel thinks he can govern by Fremantle and a little clique, but it will not do. The first election that comes, out he must go.' Melbourne, only half in jest, was reported to talk of begging Peel to give him timely notice, lest the Queen might take him by surprise. On one occasion Hobhouse wished a secondary minister to tell Sir Robert how much he admired a certain speech. 'I!' exclaimed the minister; 'he would kick me away if I dared to speak to him.' 'A man,' Hobhouse observes, 'who will not take a civil truth from a subaltern is but a sulky fellow after all; there is no true dignity or pride in such reserve.' Oddly enough, Lord John was complaining <b>just</b> as loudly <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time of his own want of hold upon his party.|$|R
50|$|Servetus was {{the first}} European to {{describe}} the function of pulmonary circulation, although his achievement was not widely recognized at the time, for a few reasons. One was that the description appeared in a theological treatise, Christianismi Restitutio, not in a book on medicine. However, the sections in which he refers to anatomy and medicines demonstrate an amazing understanding {{of the body and}} treatments. Most copies of the book were burned shortly after its publication in 1553 because of persecution of Servetus by religious authorities. Three copies survived, but these remained hidden for decades. In passage V, Servetus recounts his discovery that the blood of the pulmonary circulation flows from the heart to the lungs (rather than air in the lungs flowing to the heart as had been thought). His discovery was based on the colour of the blood, the size and location of the different ventricles, {{and the fact that the}} pulmonary vein was extremely large, which suggested that it performed intensive and transcendent exchange. However, Servetus does not talk <b>just</b> <b>about</b> cardiology. In <b>the</b> <b>same</b> passage, from page 169 to 178, he also talks of the brain, the cerebellum, the meninges, the nerves, the eye, the tympanum, the rete mirabile, etc., demonstrating a great knowledge of anatomy. In some other sections of this work he also talks of medical products.|$|R

This annual event is inextricably linked to the Old Temple at Jalan Trus. The exact date of the origin of this temple is rather hazy; but there are two artifacts within that pointed to its existence 140 years ago; one plaque bears the words [...] "8th year of the Tongzhi era" [...] (1870) and a bell has the engraving [...] "13th year of the Tongzhi era" [...] (1875). Historical records uncovered in the even older fane in Kangkar Tebrau shows that the early Teochew kangchu or River-mouth Chief (this kangchu and kangkar-system was innovated by Sultan Abu Bakar to encourage Chinese immigrants to settle inland to cultivate virgin land, which is why to this day there are numerous kangkars all over Johor which are rural Chinese settlements). Then the most convenient mode of transport was by the river and hence riparian settlements sprouted up at river-mouths and estuaries; but due to the proliferation of diseases such as malaria and also the dangers of wild animals and crocodiles, Tan Khai Soon the original kangchu of this old fane moved down to Tanjung Petri <b>just</b> at <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time when Sultan Abu Bakar had commissioned the ‘Yap Ah Loy’ of Johor Bahru; Wong Ah Fook to build the new capital. And so the old deity in Kangkar Tebrau, the Yuan Tian Shang Di found a new abode at the Jalan Trus Temple. As Johor Bahru was mostly populated by Teochews in its early history, naturally the Teochew faction dominated the cultural, social and religious aspects of the day-to-day life of JB Chinese community. As time went on the other dialect groups started to settle in JB and so with them came the deities they worshipped; this is common practice among Chinese communities overseas; they tend to bring their respective village or clan deities to the new lands they emigrated in order to seek the blessing and protection of their ‘patron saints’.|$|R
60|$|Next {{to these}} are men whose {{understandings}} are cast into a mould, and fashioned {{just to the}} size of a received HYPOTHESIS. The difference between these and the former, is, that they will admit of matter of fact, and agree with dissenters in that; but differ only in assigning of reasons and explaining the manner of operation. These are not at that open defiance with their senses, with the former: they can endure to hearken to their information a little more patiently; but will by no means admit of their reports in the explanation of things; nor be prevailed on by probabilities, which would convince them that things are not brought <b>about</b> <b>just</b> after <b>the</b> <b>same</b> manner that they have decreed within themselves that they are. Would it not be an insufferable thing for a learned professor, and that which his scarlet would blush at, to have his authority of forty years standing, wrought out of hard rock, Greek and Latin, with no small expense of time and candle, and confirmed by general tradition and a reverend beard, in an instant overturned by an upstart novelist? Can any one expect that he should be made to confess, that what he taught his scholars thirty years ago was all error and mistake; and that he sold them hard words and ignorance at a very dear rate. What probabilities, I say, are sufficient to prevail in such a case? And who ever, by the most cogent arguments, will be prevailed with to disrobe himself at once of all his old opinions, and pretences to knowledge and learning, which with hard study he hath all this time been labouring for; and turn himself out stark naked, in quest afresh of new notions? All the arguments that can be used will be as little able to prevail, as the wind did with the traveller to part with his cloak, which he held only the faster. To this of wrong hypothesis may be reduced the errors that may be occasioned by a true hypothesis, or right principles, but not rightly understood. There is nothing more familiar than this. The instances of men contending for different opinions, which they all derive from the infallible truth of the Scripture, are an undeniable proof of it. All that call themselves Christians, allow the text that says,[word in Greek], to carry in it the obligation to a very weighty duty. But yet how very erroneous will one of their practices be, who, understanding nothing but the French, take this rule with one translation to be, REPENTEZ-VOUS, repent; or with the other, FATIEZ PENITENCE, do penance.|$|R
