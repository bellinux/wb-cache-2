Presently when he glanced up he saw two dark-faced men, strangers who had not appeared before, and were peering in from a doorway.

It had a small <b>fire</b> <b>place</b> in it, and there was a table {{in the middle of the}} room, with a large portable writing-desk upon it. This desk was made of rosewood. The sides of the room were lined with book-shelves. There was one large window which looked upon the yard and garden behind. The books in this room were principally law-books, though there were some books of history and travels, and great dictionaries of various kinds. Forester conducted Marco into this room, a day or two after their arrival in the village, saying, ...|$|E
60|$|The brazen {{assurance}} {{with which}} the lad crossed the lawn and mounted {{the steps to the}} verandah suggested a familiarity with the habits and customs of the inmates of the house upon the hill which bespoke long and careful study of the contemplated job. An old timer could not have moved with greater confidence. No detail seemed to have escaped his cunning calculation. Though the door leading from the verandah into the reception hall swung wide to the balmy airs of late Spring the prowler passed this blatant invitation to the hospitality of the House of Prim. It was as though he knew that from his place {{at the head of the}} table, with his back toward the great <b>fire</b> <b>place</b> which is the pride of the Prim dining hall, Jonas Prim commands a view of the major portion of the reception hall.|$|E

The king had about his person a watch and some costly decorations, such as orders of knighthood set in jewels, which would betray his rank if found in his possession. These the king distributed among his friends, intrusting them to the charge of such as he judged most likely to effect their escape. They then cut off his hair short all over, thus making him a Roundhead instead of a Cavalier. They rubbed soot from the <b>fire</b> <b>place</b> over his face, to change the expression of his features and complexion. They gave him thus, in all respects, as nearly as possible, the guise of a squalid peasant and laborer of the humblest class, accustomed to the privations and to the habits of poverty.|$|E

60|$|The hour {{chosen for}} the rude {{ceremony}} was just {{as the sun was}} setting, and a moment and a scene more suited to paying the last offices to one of calm and pure spirit could not have been chosen. There are a mystery and a solemn dignity in death, that dispose the living to regard the remains of even a malefactor with a certain degree of reverence. All worldly distinctions have ceased; it is thought that the veil has been removed, and that the character and destiny of the departed are now as much beyond human opinions, as they are beyond human ken. In nothing is death more truly a leveller than in this, since, while it may be impossible absolutely to confound the great with the low, the worthy with the unworthy, the mind feels it to be arrogant to assume a right to judge of those who are believed to be standing at the judgment seat of God. When Judith was told that all was ready, she went upon the platform, passive to the request of her sister, and then she first took heed of the arrangement. The body was in the scow, enveloped in a sheet, and quite a hundred weight of stones, that had been taken from the <b>fire</b> <b>place,</b> were enclosed with it, in order that it might sink. No other preparation seemed to be thought necessary, though Hetty carried her Bible beneath her arm.|$|E
6000|$|For {{the benefit}} of any ardent damsel whose {{patriotic}} fancy may have surrounded hospital life with a halo of charms, I will briefly describe the bower to which I retired, in a somewhat ruinous condition. It was well ventilated, for five panes of glass had suffered compound fractures, which all the surgeons and nurses had failed to heal; the two windows were draped with sheets, the church hospital opposite being a brick and mortar Argus, and the female mind cherishing a prejudice in favor of retiracy during the night-capped periods of existence. A bare floor supported two narrow iron beds, spread with thin mattresses like plasters, furnished with pillows in the last stages of consumption. In a <b>fire</b> <b>place,</b> guiltless of shovel, tongs, andirons, or grate, burned a log inch by inch, being too long to to go on all at once; so, while the fire blazed away at one end, I did the same at the other, as I tripped over it a dozen times a day, and flew up to poke it a dozen times at night. A mirror (let us be elegant!) of the dimensions of a muffin, and about as reflective, hung over a tin basin, blue pitcher, and a brace of yellow mugs. Two invalid tables, ditto chairs, wandered here and there, and the closet contained a varied collection of bonnets, bottles, bags, boots, bread and butter, boxes and bugs. The closet was a regular Blue Beard cupboard to me; I always opened it with fear and trembling, owing to rats, and shut it in anguish of spirit; for time and space {{were not to be}} had, and chaos reigned along with the rats. Our chimney-piece was decorated with a flat-iron, a Bible, a candle minus stick, a lavender bottle, a new tin pan, so brilliant that it served nicely for a pier-glass, and such of the portly black bugs as preferred a warmer climate than the rubbish hole afforded. Two arks, commonly called trunks, lurked behind the door, containing the worldly goods of the twain who laughed and cried, slept and scrambled, in this refuge; while from the white-washed walls above either bed, looked down the pictured faces of those whose memory can make for us-- ...|$|E
60|$|It was not {{altogether}} {{the idea that}} it was her own that made Mary Erskine like her house. The interior of it was very pleasant indeed, especially after Albert had completed the furnishing of it, and had laid the floor. It contained but one room, it is true, but that was a very spacious one. There were, in fact, two apartments enclosed by the walls and the roof, though only one of them could strictly be called a room. The other was rather a shed, or stoop, and it was entered from the front by a wide opening, like a great shed door. The entrance to the house proper was by a door opening from this stoop, so as to be sheltered from the storms in winter. There was a very large <b>fire</b> <b>place</b> made of stones in the middle of one side of the room, with a large flat stone for a hearth in front of it. This hearth stone was very smooth, and Mary Erskine kept it always very bright and clean. On one side of the fire was what they called a settle, which was a long wooden seat with a very high back. It was placed {{on the side of the}} fire toward the door, so that it answered the purpose of a screen to keep off any cold currents of air, which might come in on blustering winter nights, around the door. On the other side of the fire was a small and \ very elegant mahogany work table. This was a present to Mary Erskine from Mrs. Bell on the day of her marriage. There were drawers in this table containing sundry conveniences. The upper drawer was made to answer the purpose of a desk, and it had an inkstand in a small division in one corner. Mrs. Bell had thought of taking this inkstand out, and putting in some spools, or something else which Mary Erskine would be able to use. But Mary herself would not allow her to make such a change. She said it was true that she could not write, but that was no reason why she should not have an inkstand. So she filled the inkstand with ink, and furnished the desk completely in other respects, by putting in six sheets of paper, a pen, and several wafers. The truth was, she thought it possible that an occasion might arise some time or other, at which Albert might wish to write a letter; and if such a case should occur, it would give her great pleasure to have him write his letter at her desk.|$|E

40|$|Fire. The first humans' {{synonym for}} light, sense of {{security}} and warmth. Since the beginning of its controlled use humans have assigned fire great meaning and powers – at times even some gods were depicted with a symbol of fire. The evolution of its controlled usage {{for the purpose of}} heating {{has come a long way}} from the first primitive <b>fire</b> <b>places</b> to the ones we know now – special places and devices, well designed for maximum fuel efficiency and maximum heat coverage. Even nowadays, when heating with gas or fuel oil is much more convenient as opposed to heating with solid fuels, there are a lot of buildings that are still being heated solely by solid fuels; many others are changing their heating devices to those that can accept two different types of fuels because of the ever-rising heating costs. Since <b>fire</b> <b>places</b> usually stood in the middle of the main areas of the early houses, there were tendencies that they should not just play the role of a heating element but become a part of the house – something that aesthetically complements other elements. During millennia, those once primitive <b>fire</b> <b>places</b> have evolved into beautiful pieces of art that are, in many cases, only serving as a decoration without being used for heating. In my thesis I will describe the stove as a representative of the early <b>fire</b> <b>places</b> in all its variations. I will describe what kinds of stoves we know and how they differentiate and also what technology drives them. Special emphasis will be made on the comparison of heating costs and ecologic impact of each individual stove type. The result of my thesis will thus also be applicable to broader public. Individuals who are installing heating systems for the first time or replacing the current ones can look at the price comparisons and ecologic impact of each individual fuel- and stove type. ...|$|R
