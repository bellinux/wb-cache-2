5|$|The Anglo-Egyptian <b>Darfur</b> Expedition of 1916 was a {{military}} operation by British Empire and the Sultanate of Egypt, launched as a preemptive invasion of the Sultanate of <b>Darfur.</b>|$|E
5|$|Organised armed fighters {{on horseback}} are {{occasionally}} seen. The best-known current examples are the Janjaweed, militia groups {{seen in the}} <b>Darfur</b> region of Sudan, who became notorious for their attacks upon unarmed civilian populations in the <b>Darfur</b> conflict. Many nations still maintain small numbers of mounted military units for certain types of patrol and reconnaissance duties in extremely rugged terrain, including the conflict in Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|Sudan {{has used}} Su-25s in attacks on rebel targets and {{possibly}} civilians in <b>Darfur.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Sultanate of <b>Darfur</b> {{was one of}} the kingdoms that {{stretched}} across the centre of Africa. In 1874, it was invaded by its Islamic neighbours from the south, which resulted in the country being annexed by Egypt and joined with Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. This lasted until the Mahdist War (1881–1889), when Anglo-Egyptian suzerainty was temporarily curtailed by the forces of Muhammad Ahmad, until Anglo-Egyptian control of the region was re-established following the battle of Omdurman on 2 September 1898. In 1899, Ali Dinar became the Sultan of <b>Darfur</b> with the approval of the then Sirdar Lord Kitchener, on the condition that he paid an annual tribute to the British. Relations between Dinar and the Anglo-Egyptians were assisted by the Inspector-General Rudolf Carl von Slatin who had knowledge of the <b>Darfur</b> region and its people.|$|E
5|$|According to the United Nations, Chad {{has been}} {{affected}} by a humanitarian crisis since at least 2001. , the country of Chad hosts over 280,000 refugees from the Sudan's <b>Darfur</b> region, over 55,000 from the Central African Republic, as well as over 170,000 internally displaced persons.|$|E
5|$|After the South Carolina debate, Biden campaigned in California {{to begin}} May 2007 {{attending}} events in San Francisco. Later {{in the month}} after President George W. Bush enacted economic sanctions against Sudan to pressure the government to end the genocide in <b>Darfur,</b> Biden momentarily shifted focus from Iraq to the crisis in <b>Darfur.</b> He released a statement {{on the campaign trail}} that expressed his belief that Bush was right to enact the sanctions. However, Biden argued that it was not enough, calling for a No-Fly Zone over the region and a possible commitment of United States forces to the nation.|$|E
5|$|After the expedition, the {{independent}} country of <b>Darfur,</b> and its inhabitants, {{became part of}} Sudan. The £500,000 bill {{for the cost of}} the expedition was sent to the Egyptian Government in Cairo for payment by the Egyptian taxpayers. The British commanders of the operation were also recognised. In 1917, Wingate became the British High Commissioner for Egypt. The commander of the Anglo-Egyptian expedition, Kelly, became the first Governor of the <b>Darfur</b> province with his office located in the Sultan's palace throne room until May 1917. He was then promoted to brigadier general and given command of the 5th Mounted Brigade, which was part of the Australian Mounted Division fighting in Palestine.|$|E
5|$|Bush also {{expressed}} U.S. {{support for the}} defense of Taiwan following the stand-off in April 2001 with the People's Republic of China over the Hainan Island incident, when an EP-3E Aries II surveillance aircraft collided with a People's Liberation Army Air Force jet, leading to the detention of U.S. personnel. From 2003 to 2004, Bush authorized U.S. military intervention in Haiti and Liberia to protect U.S. interests. Bush condemned the militia attacks <b>Darfur</b> and denounced the killings in Sudan as genocide. Bush said that an international peacekeeping presence was critical in <b>Darfur,</b> but opposed referring the situation to the International Criminal Court.|$|E
5|$|Gosling is {{supportive}} of various social causes. He {{has worked with}} PETA on a campaign to encourage KFC and McDonald's to use improved methods of chicken slaughter in their factories, and on a campaign encouraging dairy farmers to stop de-horning cows. Gosling volunteered in Biloxi, Mississippi in 2005, {{as part of the}} clean-up effort following Hurricane Katrina. He is a supporter of Invisible Children, Inc., a group that raises awareness about the LRA in Central Africa. In 2005, Gosling travelled to <b>Darfur</b> refugee camps in Chad. He was a speaker at Campus Progress's National Conference in 2008 where he discussed <b>Darfur.</b> As part of his work with the Enough Project, he visited Uganda in 2007 and eastern Congo in 2010.|$|E
5|$|In April 2007, {{he called}} for the United States and other {{countries}} to boycott the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, China to protest the Chinese government's support of the Sudanese government and, by extension, the genocide in <b>Darfur.</b>|$|E
5|$|McGovern {{has been}} a {{prominent}} voice against the Islamist governments of Sudan for its prosecution {{of the war in}} <b>Darfur.</b> He {{has been a}}rrested twice during protests outside the Sudanese Embassy in Washington D.C. On April 28, 2006, he was one of five members of Congress arrested while protesting atrocities in the <b>Darfur</b> region. Also arrested were U.S. Representatives Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas), Jim Moran (D-Virginia), Rep. John Olver (D-Massachusetts), and Tom Lantos (D-California). McGovern was arrested again at the Sudanese embassy on April 27, 2009, this time accompanied by Reps John Lewis (D-Georgia), Donna Edwards (D-Maryland), Lynn Woolsey (D-California), and Keith Ellison (D-Minnesota). He was arrested again on March 16, 2012 alongside George Clooney during a protest outside of the Sudanese embassy speaking out against the Bashir regime in the Sudan.|$|E
5|$|The {{sultan of}} <b>Darfur</b> Ali Dinar had been reïnstated by the British after their {{victory in the}} Mahdist War but during the First World War he grew restive, refusing his {{customary}} tribute to the Sudanese government and showing partiality to the Ottoman Empire in 1915.|$|E
5|$|While {{forced into}} exile {{and with his}} forces {{confined}} to the frontier zones of <b>Darfur,</b> Habré remained defiant. On 31 December he announced in Dakar he would resume fighting as a guerrilla against the GUNT.|$|E
5|$|As Africa's most {{populated}} country, Nigeria has repositioned {{its military}} as {{a peacekeeping force}} on the continent. Since 1995, the Nigerian military, through ECOMOG mandates, have been deployed as peacekeepers in Liberia (1997), Ivory Coast (1997–1999), and Sierra Leone (1997–1999). Under an African Union mandate, it has stationed forces in Sudan's <b>Darfur</b> region to try to establish peace.|$|E
5|$|Olver {{has been}} {{critical}} of the United States lack of involvement regarding the genocide in <b>Darfur.</b> Olver was one of five members of Congress arrested April 28, 2006 after protesting the genocide outside the Sudanese Embassy. Olver was arrested again in front of the Sudanese Embassy during a protest in 2012 along with other members of Congress and actor George Clooney.|$|E
5|$|The Emir who had {{commanded}} the Mahdist army at Rejaf, Arabi Dafalla, withdrew with {{what remained of}} his army northwest into Mahdist Sudan. He was ridiculed by his superiors for the defeat at Rejaf, and he later surrendered his army to Sultan Ali Dinar of <b>Darfur</b> after a failed attack on a French outpost in 1902.|$|E
5|$|Urban life is {{concentrated}} in the capital, whose population is mostly engaged in commerce. The other major towns are Sarh, Moundou, Abéché and Doba, which are considerably smaller but growing rapidly in population and economic activity. Since 2003, 230,000 Sudanese refugees have fled to eastern Chad from war-ridden <b>Darfur.</b> With the 172,600 Chadians displaced by {{the civil war in}} the east, this has generated increased tensions among the region's communities.|$|E
5|$|Damon was {{the founder}} of H2O Africa Foundation, the {{charitable}} arm of the Running the Sahara expedition, which merged with WaterPartners to create Water.org in July 2009. He, along with George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Don Cheadle, David Pressman, and Jerry Weintraub, {{is one of the}} founders of Not On Our Watch Project, an organization that focuses global attention and resources to stop and prevent mass atrocities such as in <b>Darfur.</b> Damon supports the ONE Campaign, which is aimed at fighting AIDS and poverty in Third World countries. He has appeared in their print and television advertising.|$|E
5|$|Horses {{have been}} used in warfare for most of {{recorded}} history. The first archaeological evidence of horses used in warfare dates to between 4000 and 3000 BC, and the use of horses in warfare was widespread {{by the end of the}} Bronze Age. Although mechanization has largely replaced the horse as a weapon of war, horses are still seen today in limited military uses, mostly for ceremonial purposes, or for reconnaissance and transport activities in areas of rough terrain where motorized vehicles are ineffective. Horses {{have been used}} in the 21st century by the Janjaweed militias in the War in <b>Darfur.</b>|$|E
5|$|Muhammad Ahmad died of typhus a {{few months}} after his victory, leaving power to his three deputies, or Kalifas. Abd al-Rahman was born on 15 July 1885 in Omdurman, three weeks after his father's death. His mother was granddaughter of a former Sultan of <b>Darfur,</b> Mohammed al-Fadl. As a child, Abd al-Rahman's only formal {{education}} was that of a religious school where the pupils memorized the Quran. By the age of eleven he had recited the Quran.|$|E
5|$|Since 1999 or earlier, an {{increasingly}} {{large number of}} migrants and refugees started to arrive {{in the vicinity of}} Calais, living in the Calais jungle, the nickname given to a series of makeshift camps. The people lived there while they attempted to enter the United Kingdom by stowing away on lorries, ferries, cars, or trains travelling through the Port of Calais or the Eurotunnel Calais Terminal. The people were a mix of refugees, asylum seekers and economic migrants from <b>Darfur,</b> Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq, Eritrea and other troubled areas of the world.|$|E
5|$|Boustead was {{promoted}} {{to the rank of}} captain on 1 March 1927 and served as a General Staff Officer, Third Grade from 22 July 1929 to 26 November 1930. He {{was promoted}} to local major on 3 February 1931, a secondment that culminated in his appointment as commander of the Sudan Camel Corps later that year. He was then promoted to local lieutenant colonel on 17 October 1931 and awarded a brevet majority on 1 January 1933. He was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1934 King's Birthday Honours. His secondment ended on 19 November 1934 and he returned to regimental duty with the Gordons in his substantive rank of captain. He retired in April 1935 to begin a career with the Sudan Political Service and spent five years as District Commissioner in <b>Darfur.</b>|$|E
5|$|Corzine was {{a sponsor}} of the Start Healthy, Stay Healthy Act. He {{supported}} providing a two-year tax break to victims of the September 11, 2001 attacks and help grant citizenship to victims who were legal resident aliens. He supported gun control laws, outlawing racial profiling, and subsidies for Amtrak. He was the chief sponsor, along with U.S. Senator Sam Brownback, of the <b>Darfur</b> Accountability Act. He voted against the Iraq War Resolution. Corzine was the prime sponsor, along with fellow New Jersey U.S. Senator Frank Lautenberg, of a federal version of John's Law, in memory of Navy Ensign John R. Elliott (a native of New Jersey), a U.S. Naval Academy graduate who {{was killed by a}} drunk driver. The legislation provides federal highway safety grant incentives to encourage states to impound the cars of DUI suspects. He was an early contributing blogger at The Huffington Post.|$|E
5|$|For example, Sudan’s {{famine in}} the 1980s was {{completely}} intentional, {{and was only}} a pawn for a varied collection of different elites to improve their political and economic statuses. These political parties weren’t the only beneficiaries, though. Merchants were also known to hoard grain and buy livestock at inappropriately low prices when the famines shifted the terms of trade. Western Sudanese merchants during the famine of 1987 were described as heartless because they refused to sell grain to needy villages in <b>Darfur</b> at reasonable prices. Ergo, the Sudanese Famine was another example of food power in which food was and used as a policy, and which completely ignored {{the needs of the}} people and fostered the political and power-hungry intentions of opposite warring forces in the country.|$|E
5|$|In 2006 Déby won a third mandate in {{elections}} {{that the opposition}} boycotted. Ethnic violence in eastern Chad has increased; the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has warned that a genocide like that in <b>Darfur</b> may yet occur in Chad. In 2006 and in 2008 rebel forces have attempted to take the capital by force, but have on both occasions failed. An agreement {{for the restoration of}} harmony between Chad and Sudan, signed 15 January 2010, marked the end of a five-year war. The fix in relations led to the Chadian rebels from Sudan returning home, the opening of the border between the two countries after seven years of closure, and the deployment of a joint force to secure the border. In May 2013, security forces in Chad foiled a coup against President Idriss Deby that had been in preparation for several months.|$|E
5|$|In {{the post-war}} period the Mahdi's family became wealthy from cotton {{production}} based on irrigation and migrant laborers, mainly their Baggara followers from <b>Darfur</b> and Kordofan. These western tribes {{had been the}} backbone of the original Mahdist movement. The riverine tribes were more inclined to side with the rival Khatmiyya movement. The government supported Abd al-Rahman in these commercial enterprises. Abd al-Rahman's economic activity, and the resulting wide range of contacts with merchants and owners of pump-schemes for irrigating cotton fields, gave him influence among Sudanese engaged in commerce. As of 1 January 1922 the government suspended payment of allowances to Mahdist notables other than the old and those whose movements were restricted. The allowance of Abd al-Rahman was increased somewhat, but only so that he could support old women and other incapable people whose allowances had been stopped.|$|E
5|$|On 16 March, five {{companies}} from the Camel Corps and mounted infantry scouts, {{supported by a}} 12-pounder artillery battery and a Maxim machine gun battery, crossed the <b>Darfur</b> frontier and four days later occupied Um Shanga. Their only opposition was from a small observation post which was forced to withdraw. Unexpectedly, upon arrival the Anglo-Egyptian force found the water supply at Um Shanga scarce. With {{the main body of}} his force expected to arrive that evening, having only two days supply of water with them, Kelly considered withdrawing back to Sudan. Instead, he divided his force, forming a fast moving column, consisting of thirty mounted infantry scouts, 240 men from the Camel Corps, two artillery pieces and eight Maxims, which left for Jebel el Hella at dawn on 22 March.|$|E
5|$|The {{chestnut}} sparrow {{is found}} in East Africa in mostly lower country from <b>Darfur</b> through Kordofan, South Sudan, Somalia, Uganda, and Kenya to north-central Tanzania. Its range also extends northeast into the southwest and Great Rift Valley of Ethiopia. Like the golden sparrows, it is sometimes nomadic when not breeding. Vagrants have been recorded as far from their breeding range as Dar es Salaam. It is found mostly in dry savanna and in fields and villages, but unlike its relations the golden sparrows, it is sometimes found in swamps of papyrus (certain Cyperus spp.). Its population has not been quantified, but {{it appears to be}} common across a very large range and it is assessed by the IUCN Red List as Least Concern for global extinction.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the 7th {{millennium}} BCE, {{human populations}} {{moved into the}} Chadian basin in great numbers. By {{the end of the}} 1st millennium AD, a series of states and empires had risen and fallen in Chad's Sahelian strip, each focused on controlling the trans-Saharan trade routes that passed through the region. France conquered the territory by 1920 and incorporated it as part of French Equatorial Africa. In 1960, Chad obtained independence under the leadership of François Tombalbaye. Resentment towards his policies in the Muslim north culminated in the eruption of a long-lasting civil war in 1965. In 1979 the rebels conquered the capital {{and put an end to}} the south's hegemony. However, the rebel commanders fought amongst themselves until Hissène Habré defeated his rivals. He was overthrown in 1990 by his general Idriss Déby. Since 2003 the <b>Darfur</b> crisis in Sudan has spilt over the border and destabilised the nation, with hundreds of thousands of Sudanese refugees living in and around camps in eastern Chad. Unsustainable high birth rates and a lack of agriculture let the country persist in poverty.|$|E
5|$|Biden is {{considered}} to be a moderate liberal, clocking a 77.5 percent liberal voting record in 2006 and lifetime score of 76.8 percent. Biden is Pro-Choice on abortion rated 100% by NARAL and supports a state's right to have civil unions. He favors a Balanced Budget Amendment and a rollback of the Bush tax cuts. He supports the PATRIOT Act, the war in Afghanistan and voted in favor of authorization of military force into Iraq. He believes a political solution can be met in Iraq through federalization. Biden would favor American military intervention into Sudan to end the <b>Darfur</b> genocide. He supports Gun control and was given an F by the NRA. He opposes the No Child Left Behind Act although he voted in favor of it in 2002. Biden opposes capital punishment and supports the continuation of the war on drugs. In 2007 he voted in favor of the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Bill and supports a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants. Biden opposes oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and believes that the government must take action against global warming.|$|E
5|$|Inside the Sudan, {{religion}} {{is an issue}} with growing the game. Most footballers wanting to play are required to wear the hijab and play while fully covered. While football was organised inside the country with 440 men's clubs in 2006, and the first ever women's game being played {{in the country that}} year in February between Tahadi and Sudan University at Sports’ City, Sudan University, development was hindered because a fatwa by the Fiqh Council of Islamic in 2006 condemning the creation of a women's league in Sudan. Still, in the South Sudan in 2006, the local government was indicating their support of women's football. By 2009, women's football programmes had been established in the Sudan. That year, there were ten senior women's teams, a school-based competition and a regional competition established. Young girls informally play the game in refugee camps in the <b>Darfur</b> region. Rights to broadcast the 2011 Women's World Cup in the country were bought by Al Jazeera.|$|E
25|$|On March 2, 2005, then Senator Jon Corzine {{presented}} the <b>Darfur</b> Peace and Accountability Act (S. 495) to the Senate. Durbin {{was one of}} 40 senators who co-sponsored the bill. The <b>Darfur</b> Accountability Act is noted as the premier legislative attempt to instill peace in <b>Darfur.</b> The bill asks that all people involved in or deemed in some way responsible for the genocide in <b>Darfur</b> be denied visas and entrance to the U.S.|$|E
25|$|The senator also is {{involved}} with legislation to address the <b>Darfur</b> genocide. In 2009, he co-sponsored two bills calling for peace in <b>Darfur.</b> Both bills, S.455 and S.684, passed in the Senate. He also {{voted in favor of}} measures to help increase the efficiency of peace keepers serving in <b>Darfur.</b>|$|E
25|$|Boxer was a cosponsor of S. 495, or the <b>Darfur</b> Accountability Act of 2005, {{which would}} impose {{sanctions}} against perpetrators {{of crimes against}} humanity in <b>Darfur.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 2007, Amnesty International {{issued a}} report accusing China and Russia of {{supplying}} arms, ammunition and related equipment to Sudan, some of which the government may have transferred to <b>Darfur</b> in violation of a UN arms embargo. The report claims that Sudan imported 10-20 combat aircraft from China in the early-mid-2000s, including three A-5 Fantan fighters that have been sighted in <b>Darfur.</b> The report provides evidence that the Sudan Air Force conducted indiscriminate aerial bombings of villages in <b>Darfur</b> and eastern Chad using ground attack fighters and repurposed Antonov transport planes. However, it does not specify whether the ground attack fighters in question are those purchased from China in the early-mid-2000s, and the Antonovs' origin remains unclear. The report also lists seven Soviet- or Russian-made Mi-24 Hind gunships that had been deployed to <b>Darfur,</b> though without specifying which country sold them to Sudan, or when. While noting that Russia sold arms worth {{tens of millions of}} dollars to Sudan in 2005 alone, the report does not specifically identify any weapons sold to Sudan by Russia after the outbreak of the <b>Darfur</b> conflict or after the imposition of the UNSC ban on arms transfers to <b>Darfur,</b> and it does not provide any evidence that any such weapons were deployed to <b>Darfur.</b>|$|E
25|$|On 9 March, it was {{announced}} that two more states would be established in Darfur: Central <b>Darfur</b> around Zalingei and Eastern <b>Darfur</b> around Ed Daein. The rebel groups protested and stated that this was a bid to further divide Darfur's influence.|$|E
