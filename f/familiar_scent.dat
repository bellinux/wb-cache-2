40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of medical technology, {{millions of dollars}} are being spent on discovering innovative methods of treating fatal diseases such as stroke that may also result in temporary paralysis. Physiotherapy treatments aimed at restoring brain function in patients paralyzed following a stroke is subjective to the patient and does not guarantee complete rehabilitation. While many practitioners have attempted to employ complementary and alternative methods of treatment such as massage therapy, acupuncture therapy, siddha, and marma therapy, none of them proved to be equally as effective as physiotherapy. However, prior studies {{support the notion that}} aromatherapy used in combination with music therapy showed promising results. Aromatherapy, defined as using extracted oils from plants and herbs to naturally treat the body through oral or skin absorption, has been effective in halting the process of apoptosis, or programmed cell death in cells. The inhibition of apoptosis may be principal in delaying the degeneration of brain cells. Music therapy, on the other hand, uses a process known as entrainment to access a paralyzed brain for rhythmic perception. These two processes are connected through transduction, which elaborates the relationship between the olfactory and auditory system that improves the efficiency of memory retention through <b>familiar</b> <b>scents</b> and sounds. Using aromatherapy in combination with music therapy is more effective because it is a self-paced treatment that does not require the administration of a trained professional. This alternative treatment for paralyzed stroke patients will be applicable to the general public if administered in reasonable doses under appropriate conditions. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|During {{foraging}} flights, honeybees learn {{visual and}} chemical cues {{associated with a}} food source. We investigated whether learned olfactory cues can trigger visual and navigational memories in honeybees that assist them in navigating back to a known food source. In a series of experiments, marked bees were trained to forage at one or more sugar water feeders, placed at different outdoor locations and carrying different scents or colours. We then tested the ability of these bees to recall the locations (or colours) of these food sites and to fly to them, when the training scents were blown into the hive, and the scents and food at the feeders were removed. The results show that (1) bees, trained to a single-scented feeder at a given location, can be induced to fly to the same location by blowing the scent into the hive; (2) bees, trained to two feeders, each placed at a different location and carrying a different scent, can be induced to fly to either location by blowing the appropriate scent into the hive; and (3) bees, trained to two feeders, each decorated with a different colour and carrying a different scent, can be induced to find a feeder of either colour by blowing the appropriate scent into the hive. Thus, <b>familiar</b> <b>scents</b> can trigger navigational and visual memories in experienced bees. Our {{findings suggest that the}} odour and taste of the nectar samples that are distributed by successful foragers on returning to the hive, may trigger recall of navigational memories associated with the food site in experienced recruits and, thus, facilitate their navigation back to the site...|$|R

40|$|Exposure of {{recently}} mated female rodents to unfamiliar male scents during daily prolactin surges results in pregnancy failure (the ‘Bruce effect’). Control of nasal contact with male scents during these narrow windows of sensitivity could allow females to maintain or terminate pregnancy, but female behavioural changes specifically during this critical period {{have not been}} investigated. We examined the approach or avoidance of familiar stud strain and unfamiliar male scents by recently mated female mice. Females that maintained pregnancy avoided both unfamiliar and <b>familiar</b> male <b>scent</b> during critical periods of susceptibility for the Bruce effect. By contrast, females that did not maintain pregnancy showed a sharp rise in the time spent with unfamiliar male scent during this critical period. Manipulation of the social status of unfamiliar and stud strain scent donors {{did not affect the}} likelihood of pregnancy block, although females spent more time with dominant male scents across all time periods. The ability to control the Bruce effect through behaviour during brief sensitivity just before dusk, when females are likely to be in nest sites, provides a mechanism by which females may adjust their reproductive investment according to nest site social stability and likelihood of offspring survival...|$|R
40|$|Our {{understanding}} of how floral visitors integrate visual and olfactory cues when seeking food, and how background complexity affects flower detection is limited. Here, we aimed to understand the use of visual and olfactory information for bumblebees (Bombus terrestris terrestris L.) when seeking flowers in a visually complex background. To explore this issue, we first evaluated the effect of flower colour (red and blue), size (8, 16 and 32 mm), scent (presence or absence) {{and the amount of}} training on the foraging strategy of bumblebees (accuracy, search time and flight behaviour), considering the visual complexity of our background, to later explore whether experienced bumblebees, previously trained in the presence of scent, can recall and make use of odour information when foraging in the presence of novel visual stimuli carrying a <b>familiar</b> <b>scent.</b> Of all the variables analysed, flower colour had the strongest effect on the foraging strategy. Bumblebees searching for blue flowers were more accurate, flew faster, followed more direct paths between flowers and needed less time to find them, than bumblebees searching for red flowers. In turn, training and the presence of odour helped bees to find inconspicuous (red) flowers. When bees foraged on red flowers, search time increased with flower size; but search time was independent of flower size when bees foraged on blue flowers. Previous experience with floral scent enhances the capacity of detection of a novel colour carrying a <b>familiar</b> <b>scent,</b> probably by elemental association influencing attention...|$|E
40|$|Social carnivores, such as {{wolves and}} coyotes, have {{distinct}} and well-defined home ranges. During {{the formation of}} these home ranges scent marks provide important cues {{regarding the use of}} space by familiar and foreign packs. Previous models for territorial pattern formation have required a den site as the organizational center around which the territory is formed. However, well-defined wolf home ranges have been known to form {{in the absence of a}} den site, and even in the absence of surrounding packs. To date, the quantitative models have failed to describe a mechanism for such a process. In this paper we propose a mechanism. It involves interaction between scent marking and movement behavior in response to <b>familiar</b> <b>scent</b> marks.

40|$|On {{the basis}} of studies of the {{olfactory}} bulb of a rabbit Freeman suggested that in the rest state the dynamics of this neural cluster is chaotic, but that when a <b>familiar</b> <b>scent</b> is presented the neural system rapidly simplifies its behaviour and the dynamics becomes more orderly, more nearly periodic than when in the rest state.

In this thesis we first study the general problem of modelling smooth systems and introduce a number of useful techniques relevant {{to the problem of}} modelling chaotic dynamics. After a preliminary review of chaotic dynamical systems and their control, and discussing several examples of neural chaos, we then construct a chaotic neural model. We show how this model can be successfully controlled using several different parametric control methods. However, such methods of control are external to the network and we are interested in the control of higher dimensional networks using a technique which is intrinsic to the neural dynamics.

40|$|Although male rats {{are known}} to display greater {{unconditional}} sexual arousal and mating preference to copulate with a novel female compared to a familiar one, {{research has shown that}} males given repeated copulatory trials in bi-level chambers with a random almond-scented female develop a conditioned ejaculatory preference (CEP) for females bearing this odor cue. These findings suggest that male rats can learn to associate cues with sexual reward and display preferences for partners that bear those familiar cues. Examination of the effect of copulation in pacing chambers bisected by a divider that either had one hole or four holes at the bottom that only allowed the female to cross, revealed that in 1 -hole pacing chambers, females spend more time away from the male than in 4 -hole pacing chambers. Males copulating in 1 -hole pacing chambers displayed longer ejaculation latencies than those in the 4 -hole condition. Interestingly, when animals were changed environments, the differences in ejaculation latencies were maintained suggesting that the pattern of copulation in these males had become conditioned by their initial environment of copulation. An examination of the preferred environment of copulation showed that males prefer to copulate in 4 -hole over 1 -hole pacing chambers perhaps because males can achieve their optimal rates of copulation in 4 -hole chambers. However, contrary to what would be expected, males trained to copulate in 4 -hole pacing chambers, with the same almond-scented female at every trial, failed to develop CEP for their familiar female. Instead, it is the males that were trained to copulate in 1 -hole pacing chambers that displayed CEP for their familiar female as opposed to the novel one. These findings suggest that copulation in environments in which the female withdraws away from the male {{for longer periods of time}} facilitate the development of CEP for a <b>familiar</b> <b>scented</b> female. An analysis of the components required for males to develop CEP for their familiar female revealed that copulation in 1 -hole pacing chambers with the same female bearing an olfactory cue and of the same strain as their own are necessary conditions for males to display CEP for their familiar female. Examination of the brain areas involved in the development of CEP for a familiar female, using immunohistochemistry, demonstrated that males that developed CEP for their familiar female displayed significantly more Fos immunoreactivity in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (Arc). Pharmacological analyses of the neurochemical mechanisms important for the development of CEP showed that intact opioidergic, but not dopaminergic system, are necessary for the development of CEP in male rats. Examination of neural structures involved in the development of CEP revealed that the VTA and the Arc play an important role in the development of this preference. The present findings shed light on the effect of context on the development of male copulatory behavior and on the development of CEP for a familiar female and its underlying mechanism...|$|R

40|$|Abstract In an agonistic interaction, the {{assessment}} of the probable outcome of future encounters with the same individuals may be the best way of decreasing costs of fighting, but this may only be accomplished if animals are able to recognize individual conspecifics. We staged encounters between male lizards, Podarcis hispanica, to examine whether odoriferous cues are involved in rival recognition during agonistic interactions. We experimen-tally manipulated the odour of intruding males, creating familiar males with their own odour or bearing odours of unfamiliar males, and unfamiliar males bearing unfamil-iar odours or odours of familiar males. The results showed that when familiar males were impregnated with scents from unfamiliar males, they elicited an aggressive response by resident unmanipulated males similar to that observed for a new unfamiliar male with unfamiliar odour. This suggests that resident males were unable to recognize familiar males when their own scents were removed. In contrast, responding males were less aggres-sive towards familiar males impregnated with their own odour and towards unfamiliar males impregnated with scents of familiar males, suggesting that when two males have already interacted, their scents become familiar for both males, and that the detection in successive encoun-ters of the <b>familiar</b> <b>scent</b> suffices to reduce the aggres-sive response of territorial males. Therefore, recognition mechanisms based on chemical cues during agonistic en-counters may contribute to reducing the intensity and the costs of fighting in P. hispanica and may play an impor-tant role in the organization of their social system...|$|E
40|$|For {{many species}} sexually {{selected}} signals {{are essential for}} communication between conspecifics. These signals produced by males are attractive to females and may reliably reflect competitive ability, health status and genetic identity. There is high diversity {{in the types of}} auditory, visual and olfactory signals that males produce, and males of many species invest in multiple signals. In mice, adult males invest in scent-marks and ultrasonic calls as sexual signals. Ultrasonic calls are emitted during encounters with female conspecifics, primarily during pre-copulatory sniffing and investigation. As a result, this sexually dimorphic and individually variable behaviour has been suggested to serve a specific courtship function in mice. Scent marks are also important for communication with conspecifics and provide long lasting signals of identity, health status and competitive ability to potential mates. Both male signals are therefore important in sexual communication, but it is unclear whether scent marking and calling serve separate functions. To address this, male scent marking and calling was recorded in response to female odours, a female behind a mesh barrier, a direct interaction with a female or no female cues. Male signalling investment varied according to female cue type. Further, cues that elicited a high rate of calling differed from those that elicited a high rate of scent marking. Ultrasonic calls were primarily emitted in interactions suggesting an important role in direct courtship. By contrast, the greatest number of scent marks was deposited when males were not in direct contact with female conspecifics. Consistent with the results obtained in the first experiment, scent marks are known to provide information to females {{in the absence of a}} male through long lasting cues present in urine. The distribution of scent marks also provides an honest signal of a male’s competitive ability to defend its territory. Females are highly attracted to spend time near male scent marks and are subsequently more attracted to the owners of these <b>familiar</b> <b>scent</b> marks than to equivalent unfamiliar males. Male scent can also condition a preference for its location, stimulated by a specific sex pheromone present in male urine. These acquired memories of male scent mark locations and individual scent signatures are likely to be important in allowing females to be selective and approach preferred males when ready to mate. In a natural context, females investigate multiple scent marks when territories of competing males are encountered. To reflect the complexity of scents encountered in a natural context and to assess how differences in male expression of specific scent components influence female spatial learning, conditioned place preference tests comprising multiple scents and locations were used. When multiple scents were presented simultaneously, females formed a learned preference for multiple locations of male but not female scents; darcin, a male-specific pheromone, was also required for male scent to condition a preference for its remembered location. Further, the relative amount of darcin influenced the strength of a remembered preference. The comparative composition of individual scents may therefore be important in determining female learned preferences for locations scent marked by competing males. Male scent from dominant territory owners also stimulates neurogenesis in the hippocampus and olfactory bulbs of female mice, areas of the mammalian brain associated with spatial learning and olfactory processing. In hippocampal neurogenesis, neurons are generated and remain in their mature form within this same structure; by contrast, the germinal area for olfactory neurons is present in the forebrain and newly generated cells must migrate over long distances before being incorporated into existing circuits. To investigate whether scent components that stimulate spatial learning also stimulate neurogenesis in females, immature hippocampal neurons and proliferating cells in the forebrain were quantified in female mice exposed to different male scents or scent components. The results suggest darcin, a male specific MUP that stimulates spatial learning, also stimulates hippocampal and olfactory neurogenesis in females. This male pheromone therefore appears to play a role in the immediate behavioural response and the long-term neurological change associated with exposure to male scents...|$|E

We combined behavioral habituation experiments with gas chromatography–mass spectrometry of glandular secretions from the left and right flank gland and midventral gland of the rat-like hamster, Tscheskia triton. We found that females became habituated to one scent and then could discriminate individuals via another scent source from the same individual only when <b>familiar</b> with the <b>scent</b> donor. However, this prior social interaction was not required for females to discriminate different individuals in single-stimulus habituation–dishabituation tests. Chemical analyses revealed a similarity in volatile compounds between the left and right flank gland and midventral gland scents. It appears that individually distinctive cues are integratively coded by a combination of both flank gland and midventral gland secretions, instead of a single scent, albeit animals show different preferences to the novel scent.

It can also be introduced to the tracking harness, which is put on just before the trail starts, and removed as soon as it is finished. On reaching the runner the puppy is given lavish praise and perhaps a reward. Generally in training the handler must know exactly where the runner went, so that he does not encourage the hound when it is wrong, or ‘correct’ it when it is on the scent, but he should not be too ready with his corrections if the hound goes astray, or it may come to rely on him. He should give the hound time to realise its mistake and put itself right, if possible. As training progresses the handler learns to ‘read’ his hound’s behaviour. The hound must trust its nose and the handler must trust the hound. From early hot trails on a familiar person, the young hound progresses to colder trails on the scents of strangers. Later training can be designed to teach particular lessons: crossing trails with false scents, having the runner start out with a companion, who leaves him somewhere along the trail, laying a trail on ground frequented by wild animals. This will teach the hound not to change on to other humans, or riot on animal scents (known as ‘staying clean’ , or ‘freedom from change’ [...] ). It also needs to work over a variety of ground and learn to cope with distractions of many kinds, as well as being introduced to 'negative trails': given a scent article which has not been handled by anyone in the area, so that it will learn to indicate to a handler that the required scent is not there. If it is becoming discouraged it can revert to simpler tasks to recover enthusiasm.|$|R
