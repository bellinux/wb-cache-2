40|$|In this work, we {{extend the}} {{construction}} of <b>dual</b> color decomposition <b>in</b> Yang-Mills theory to one-loop level, i. e., we show how to write one-loop integrands in Yang-Mills theory to the dual DDM-form and the <b>dual</b> trace-form. <b>In</b> <b>dual</b> forms, integrands are decomposed in terms of color-ordered one-loop integrands for color scalar theory with proper <b>dual</b> color coefficients. <b>In</b> <b>dual</b> DDM decomposition, The dual color coefficients can be obtained directly from BCJ-form by applying Jacobi-like identities for kinematic factors. <b>In</b> <b>dual</b> trace decomposition, the dual trace factors {{can be obtained by}} imposing one-loop KK relations, reflection relation and their relation with the kinematic factors <b>in</b> <b>dual</b> DDM-form.
