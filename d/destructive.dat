5|$|Due to its <b>destructive</b> impacts, {{the name}} Connie was retired, {{and will never}} again be used for an Atlantic hurricane.|$|E
5|$|November 25, 1888– A {{moderate}} hurricane {{passes to}} the east of the state, bringing high tides and <b>destructive</b> winds.|$|E
5|$|The 1980s saw <b>destructive</b> {{tropical}} cyclones {{pass through}} the state, {{as was the case}} with the previous decade.|$|E
5|$|The most <b>destructive</b> {{earthquake}} yet {{known in}} New England occurred in 1755, causing considerable damage across Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|The {{season was}} less <b>destructive</b> than below normal, causing an {{estimated}} $2.6billion (2002USD) in property damage and 23 fatalities.|$|E
5|$|There {{are other}} scales {{that are not}} officially used {{by any of the}} Regional Specialized Meteorological Centres or the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centres. However they are used by other organizations, such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. An example of such scale is the Integrated Kinetic Energy index, which {{measures}} the <b>destructive</b> potential of the storm surge; it works on a scale that ranges from one to six, with six having the highest <b>destructive</b> potential.|$|E
5|$|Although nearby GRBs hitting Earth with a <b>destructive</b> {{shower of}} gamma rays are only {{hypothetical}} events, high energy processes across the galaxy {{have been observed}} to affect the Earth's atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{findings}} {{prove that}} while ancient mankind used conventional weapons such as axes and clubs, and later swords, they sought more subtle, <b>destructive</b> means of causing death—something {{that could be}} achieved through poison.|$|E
5|$|Autocannons {{are often}} found in aircraft, where they {{replaced}} machine guns and as shipboard anti-aircraft weapons, as they provide greater <b>destructive</b> power than machine guns.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Donna {{was a very}} <b>destructive</b> {{hurricane}} {{that caused}} extensive damage from the Lesser Antilles to New England. At least 364 people {{were killed by the}} hurricane and property damage was estimated at $900 million (1960 USD).|$|E
5|$|On April29, 1963, {{less than}} half a year after Karen, Typhoon Olive caused {{extensive}} damage in Guam and the Mariana Islands. With many residents living in tents, and debris from the storm still scattered about, severe damage was anticipated. Schools, churches, and other structures were opened as shelters in order to protect those without homes. Ultimately, Guam was spared the worst of the storm though much of Saipan was devastated. The island was again devastated in 1976 by Typhoon Pamela which buffeted the island with <b>destructive</b> winds for 36hours. Though weaker than Karen, the longer lasting impact of Pamela was regarded as more <b>destructive.</b>|$|E
5|$|On September17, the Japanese {{military}} was mobilized {{to assist in}} relief efforts. In all, 87 fatalities, 158 injuries and $102million in damage was attributed to Typhoon Helen, making it the most <b>destructive</b> tropical cyclone to strike Japan in 1972.|$|E
5|$|Other mammals can be <b>destructive.</b> Possums {{tend not}} to eat {{the leaves of the}} tree, but are very fond of eating the sugar-rich {{flowering}} stalks as they emerge. They also like using the tree as a sleeping place. Rabbits can be more <b>destructive,</b> especially during periods of drought, when they have been seen to eat through the base until a tree falls, and then eating the fallen tree completely. Horses can also fell a tree by eating through the trunk.|$|E
5|$|Other pest {{include the}} coconut hispine beetle, Brontispa longissima, which feeds on young leaves, {{seedlings}} and mature coconut trees, causing serious economic {{damage in the}} Philippines. The mountain pine beetle is a <b>destructive</b> pest of mature or weakened lodgepole pine, sometimes affecting large areas of Canada.|$|E
5|$|Super Typhoon Pamela was {{not only}} a wet {{tropical}} cyclone for the island of Guam, but a <b>destructive</b> one as well. Since Pamela, wooden structures across Guam have been largely replaced by concrete structures in order to better weather typhoons.|$|E
5|$|The 2011 Super Outbreak was the largest, costliest, {{and one of}} {{the deadliest}} tornado {{outbreaks}} ever recorded, affecting the Southern, Midwestern, and Northeastern United States and leaving catastrophic destruction in its wake. The event affected Alabama and Mississippi the most severely, but it also produced <b>destructive</b> tornadoes in Arkansas, Georgia, Tennessee and Virginia, and affected many other areas throughout the Southern and Eastern United States. In total, 362 tornadoes were confirmed by NOAA's National Weather Service (NWS) and Government of Canada's Environment Canada in 21 states from Texas to New York to southern Canada. Widespread and <b>destructive</b> tornadoes occurred on each day of the outbreak, with April 27 being the most active day with a record of 218 tornadoes touching down that day from midnight to midnight CDT (0500 – 0500 UTC). Four of the tornadoes were <b>destructive</b> enough to be rated EF5, which is the highest ranking possible on the Enhanced Fujita scale; typically these tornadoes are only recorded about once each year or less.|$|E
5|$|The Pranatosini-Tantra version {{stresses}} Dhumavati's <b>destructive</b> aspect and hunger, {{which is}} satisfied {{only when she}} consumes Shiva, who himself contains or creates the universe. It brings out her inauspicious status as a widow and her self-assertion on her husband.|$|E
5|$|The eastern {{spruce budworm}} {{is an example}} of a <b>destructive</b> insect in fir and spruce forests. Birds are a natural form of {{biological}} control, but the Trichogramma minutum, a species of parasitic wasp, has been investigated as an alternative to more controversial chemical controls.|$|E
5|$|The episode focuses upon a thirteen-year-old girl, Maria Jackson, {{discovering}} {{the existence of}} aliens. After discovering that the Bane, creators of a soft drink called Bubble Shock!, harbour a <b>destructive</b> secret, she teams up with investigative journalist Sarah Jane Smith to prevent their plans.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the text, she {{contrasts}} the constructive, creative imagination with <b>destructive</b> commerce. By associating commercialism {{with the}} anonymous lover in the text, Wollstonecraft was also directly censuring Imlay, who she believed cared more for his business speculations than {{for her and}} their child.|$|E
5|$|Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege {{received}} positive reviews. Critics generally {{praised the}} game's <b>destructive</b> environment, tactical nature, map design, and {{its focus on}} teamwork. However, the lack of content and the game's microtransactions were subjected to criticism.|$|E
5|$|While the <b>destructive</b> tornadoes were {{affecting}} Connecticut, {{this part}} of the storm produced four brief F1 tornadoes in quick succession north of Worcester, which occurred between 4PM and 4:15PM. These tornadoes each produced damage paths less than 150feet (45m) wide, and less than 0.5miles (0.8km) long.|$|E
5|$|Yagdra {{was one of}} {{the primal}} zerg pack leaders of Zerus. Yagdra closely resembled an ash worm in appearance, and it was {{considerably}} larger in stature than most other primal zerg. It could spit gobs of <b>destructive</b> acid that burnt like fire.|$|E
5|$|After {{integration}} into the RISC, siRNAs base-pair to their target mRNA and cleave it, thereby preventing it from {{being used as a}} translation template. Differently from siRNA, a miRNA-loaded RISC complex scans cytoplasmic mRNAs for potential complementarity. Instead of <b>destructive</b> cleavage (by Ago2), miRNAs rather target the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) regions of mRNAs where they typically bind with imperfect complementarity, thus blocking the access of ribosomes for translation.|$|E
5|$|All in all, a GRB {{within a}} few parsecs, with its energy {{directed}} towards Earth, will mostly damage life by raising the UV levels during the burst itself {{and for a few}} years thereafter. Models show that the <b>destructive</b> effects of this increase can cause up to 16 times the normal levels of DNA damage. It has proved difficult to assess a reliable evaluation of the consequences of this on the terrestrial ecosystem, because of the uncertainty in biological field and laboratory data.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the first}} {{municipal}} council of Gaza {{was formed in}} 1893 under the chairmanship of Ali Khalil Shawa, modern mayorship began in 1906 with his son Said al-Shawa, who was appointed mayor by Ottoman authorities. Like other regions and cities in Palestine at the time, Gaza was economically and politically dominated {{by a number of}} powerful clans, particularly the Shawa, Husseini, and Sourani families. Two <b>destructive</b> earthquakes occurred in 1903 and 1914.|$|E
5|$|As Enterprise {{travels through}} the Delphic Expanse, {{the ship is}} damaged by <b>destructive</b> spatial anomalies. With most of the primary systems off-line, Ensign Mayweather notices another ship nearby but no life-signs are detected. Captain Archer leads Lieutenant Reed and several MACOs on an away mission, and {{discover}} the crew are all dead. Taking what they can, they return and resume their mission.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the third day of the trial, Wiens incurred a self-inflicted injury by banging his head against a table. He was diagnosed with haematomas and a suspected traumatic brain injury, but was judged fit to stand trial after a hospital-based medical examination. While continuing with noncompliant and <b>destructive</b> behaviour, Wiens was temporarily restrained by nine security officers in court.|$|E
5|$|Before Iris {{moved through}} the Lesser Antilles, {{tropical}} storm watches, and later warnings, were issued from Barbados through the British Virgin Islands. The storm produced tropical storm force winds across the eastern Caribbean, although the primary meteorological event occurred from heavy rainfall. Flooding prompted evacuations in communities in Saint Lucia, Dominica, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. Iris {{was the first of}} three storms in a three-week period to affect the region, preceding the more <b>destructive</b> hurricanes Luis and Marilyn.|$|E
5|$|Changing the {{relative}} {{phase of the}} subwoofer {{with respect to the}} woofers in other speakers may or may not help to minimize unwanted <b>destructive</b> acoustic interference in the frequency region covered by both subwoofer and main speakers. It may not help at all frequencies, and may create further problems with frequency response, but is even so generally provided as an adjustment for subwoofer amplifiers. Phase control circuits may be a simple polarity reversal switch or a more complex continuously variable circuits.|$|E
5|$|Domniile române... was {{simultaneously}} {{published in}} Bucharest (by Editura Socec), Leipzig (Otto Harrassowitz) and Vienna (Carl Gerold). It was then reprinted {{by the official}} Editura Academiei press, {{under the supervision of}} historian Nicolae Iorga. The encounter was confrontational: Iorga decided to cut out entire passages where, he argued, the author had gone into too much detail. The intervention was unwittingly <b>destructive,</b> as part of the documents cited by Filitti, and only by him, have since been destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Eighty-seven tornadoes {{occurred}} {{over the course of}} the outbreak, which lasted over 15 hours from the afternoon of February 5 until the early morning of February 6. The storm system produced several <b>destructive</b> tornadoes in heavily populated areas, most notably in the Memphis metropolitan area, in Jackson, Tennessee, and the northeastern end of the Nashville metropolitan area.|$|E
5|$|Elephants can exhibit {{bouts of}} {{aggressive}} behaviour {{and engage in}} <b>destructive</b> actions against humans. In Africa, groups of adolescent elephants damaged homes in villages after cullings in the 1970s and 1980s. Because of the timing, these attacks have been interpreted as vindictive. In parts of India, male elephants regularly enter villages at night, destroying homes and killing people. Elephants killed around 300 people between 2000 and 2004 in Jharkhand while in Assam, 239 people were reportedly killed between 2001 and 2006.|$|E
5|$|Four Everglade {{species of}} sea turtle {{including}} the Atlantic green sea turtle, the Atlantic hawksbill, the Atlantic loggerhead (Caretta caretta), and the Atlantic ridley (Lepidochelys kempii) are endangered. Also, the {{leatherback sea turtle}} (Dermochelys coriacea) is threatened. Numbers are difficult to determine, since males and juveniles do not return to their birthplace; females lay eggs in the same location every year. Habitat loss and illegal poaching and <b>destructive</b> fishing practices are the biggest threats to these animals.|$|E
5|$|Giant Schnauzers {{have been}} {{described}} as trustworthy with children. They are very intelligent, and can become bored easily. They are also very energetic and highly spirited, which, when coupled with boredom, can lead to unwanted and <b>destructive</b> behavior. They are easily trained, and deeply loyal to their owner. Some breeders believe that pepper and salt colored Giant Schnauzers are more docile than their black-furred counterparts.|$|E
5|$|Hoping to {{gain more}} control of Oscorp Industries, Osborn accuses Stromm of {{embezzlement}} and has his partner arrested. Searching his former mentor's possessions, Norman discovers an experimental strength/intelligence enhancement formula, but in attempting to create the serum, it turns green and explodes in his face. The accident greatly increases his intelligence and physical abilities as intended, but also has the side-effect of driving him into <b>destructive</b> insanity.|$|E
