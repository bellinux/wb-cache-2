40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze how a {{permanent}} magnet linear generator for wave power behaves when the stator <b>slots</b> are <b>closed.</b> The usual design of stator geometry is to use open slots to maintain a low magnetic leakage flux between the stator teeth. By doing this, harmonics are induced in the magnetic flux density in the air-gap due to <b>slotting.</b> The <b>closed</b> <b>slots</b> are designed to cause saturation, to keep the permeability low. This reduces the slot harmonics in the magnetic flux density, but will also increase the flux leakage between the stator teeth. An analytical model has been created to study the flux through the <b>closed</b> <b>slots</b> and the result compared with finite element simulations. The outcome shows a reduction of the cogging force and a reduction of the harmonics of the magnetic flux density in the air-gap. It also shows a small increase of the total magnetic flux entering the stator and an increased magnetic flux leakage through the <b>closed</b> <b>slots...</b>|$|R

40|$|Permanent magnet {{synchronous}} motors (PMSMs) are exceptionally promising {{thanks to}} their many advantages compared {{with other types of}} electrical machines. Indeed, PMSMs are characterized by their important torque density, light weight, high air gap flux density, high acceleration, high efficiency and strong power-to-weight ratio. A surface-mounted PMSM (SPMSM) is used in this work. The SPMSM is built using a 2 D finite element method (FEM). Cogging torque, torque ripples and back-EMF are examined during the design process in order to obtain sinusoidal back-EMF and to minimise torque ripples which are one of the major problems with PMSMs. Two procedures are used to reduce the cogging torque of SPMSM: the effect of slot opening and the influence of skewing the stator laminations. Cogging torque factor tc and the torque ripples factor tr have been calculated to compare the two configurations (open <b>slots</b> and <b>closed</b> <b>slots).</b> Then, the configuration with <b>closed</b> <b>slots</b> is utilised with skewing the stator laminations for different angle 0 °, 10 ° and 15 °...|$|R

40|$|Some {{methods for}} {{considering}} skewed slots are briefly discussed. It is shown {{that for a}} rigorous modelling of skew and of the ensuing axial variation of saturation, a 2. 5 D multi-slice model is {{a viable alternative to}} a fully 3 D model. The computational cost of time stepping such a FE model connected to an external electrical circuit using either a direct or an indirect coupling method is studied. The latter is applied to the simulation of a squirrel-cage induction motor, for which four different rotors (with unskewed or skewed slots and with open or <b>closed</b> <b>slots)</b> are available. A satisfactory agreement between measured and computed stator phase current waveforms has been obtained for both no-load and load. ICEM' 96 info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|This thesis studies {{wave energy}} {{converters}} developed at Uppsala University. The wave energy converters are of point absorbing type with direct driven linear generators. The aim {{has been to}} study generator design with <b>closed</b> stator <b>slots</b> as well as offshore experimental studies. By <b>closing</b> the stator <b>slots,</b> the harmonic content in the magnetic flux density is reduced {{and as a result}} the cogging forces in the generator are reduced as well. By reducing these forces, the noise and vibrations from the generator can be lowered. The studies have shown a significant reduction in the cogging forces in the generator. Moreover, by <b>closing</b> the <b>slots,</b> the magnetic flux finds a short-cut through the <b>closed</b> <b>slots</b> and will lower the magnetic flux linking the windings. The experimental studies have focused on the motion of the translator. The weight of the translator has {{a significant impact on the}} power absorption, especially in the downward motion. Two different experiments have been studied with two different translator weights. The results show that with a higher translator weight the power absorption is more evenly produced between the upward and downward motion as was expected from the simulation models. Furthermore, studies on the influence of the changing active area have been conducted which show some benefits with a changing active area during the downward motion. The experimental results also indicate snatch-loads for the wave energy converter with a lower translator weight. Within this thesis results from a comparative study between two WECs with almost identical properties have been presented. The generators electrical properties and the buoy volumes are the same, but with different buoy heights and diameters. Moreover, experimental studies including the conversion from AC to DC have been achieved. The work in this thesis is part of a larger wave power project at Uppsala University. The project studies the whole process from the energy absorption from the waves to the connection to the electrical grid. The project has a test-site at the west coast of Sweden near the town of Lysekil, where wave energy systems have been studied since 2004...|$|R
