500|$|As {{the matter}} {{involved}} the prince, Stacey consulted other {{officers in the}} regiment about what should be done, and found that opinion was divided between allowing Gordon-Cumming {{to remain in the}} regiment while he defended himself, or removing him straight away. The Colonel of the Scots Guards, the prince's younger brother, the Duke of Connaught, was also asked: according to Havers, Grayson and Shankland, the duke [...] "insisted that Gordon-Cumming must be crushed". Stacey disagreed, and thought that the whole story needed to be brought out before such a decision was taken. He reported the situation to the Adjutant-General to the Forces, General Sir Redvers Buller, and requested permission to let Gordon-Cumming retire on half-pay. Buller agreed to the request, but stated that if Gordon-Cumming's legal action failed, the permission would be reviewed. Stacey relayed the message to Gordon-Cumming and told him that signing the note was an error: [...] "Because you signed that document you will never put on a sword in the regiment. If you bring a successful action you will be allowed to retire: <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>fail,</b> you will be dismissed [...] the service". The Duke of Connaught strongly disapproved of Buller's decision, and he withdrew to Portsmouth, refusing to again be drawn on the affair, even after his brother requested further advice.|$|E
2500|$|Kelley responded, {{in a paper}} titled [...] "A Question of Sanction", by disputing Schwartz's {{interpretation}} of the sanction principle in particular and his {{interpretation of}} moral principles in general. Subsequently, in an essay appearing in The Intellectual Activist, Peikoff endorsed Schwartz's view and claimed that Kelley's arguments contradicted the fundamental principles of Objectivism. Peikoff maintained that many non-Objectivist systems of thought, such as Marxism, are based on [...] "inherently dishonest ideas" [...] whose advocacy must never be sanctioned. He attributed the fall of NBI and subsequent schisms not to [...] "differences in regard to love affairs or political strategy or proselytizing techniques or anybody's personality," [...] but to a [...] "fundamental and philosophical" [...] cause: [...] "if you grasp and accept the concept of 'objectivity,' in all its implications, then you accept Objectivism, you live by it and you revere Ayn Rand for defining it. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>fail</b> fully to grasp and accept the concept, whether your failure is deliberate or otherwise, you eventually drift away from Ayn Rand's orbit, or rewrite her viewpoint or turn openly into her enemy." [...] Those who criticized his position were to make their exit: [...] "if {{you agree with the}} Branden or Kelley viewpoint or anything resembling it—please drop out of our movement: drop Ayn Rand, leave Objectivism alone. We do not want you and Ayn Rand would not have wanted you [...] " ...|$|E

5000|$|We sold blood {{because we}} were poor. Wang Huaizhong was in power {{at that time and}} the {{government}} under him demanded that each farmer pay an extra agricultural tax. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>failed</b> to pay, the officials would take away your pigs, corn, and grain. So the harvest was only good enough for a basic living. But keeping children at school was expensive. Giving out gifts every year cost a family nearly ten thousand yuan. Building rooms to bring in a wife cost thirty thousand to forty thousand yuan. But if the government did not encourage blood selling, we would not have sold blood to make money.|$|R
