40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that the retinal {{eccentricity}} of target stimuli has surprisingly little effect on the latency of visually driven saccades. But up until now researchers have addressed this issue by presenting saccadic targets in an unstructured visual field. This contrasts with everyday vision in which eye movements are initiated to stimuli within a cluttered environment. The present experiment compared latencies for target onsets in an <b>empty</b> <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> with a condition in which continuously illuminated location markers "tagged" the possible target locations. Previous reports of no effect of eccentricity on latencies in an unstructured field were replicated. However, a significant effect of eccentricity was found when location markers were used. Interestingly this did not reflect a lengthening of latencies as would be predicted by a reduction in target discriminability. Instead, latencies were relatively facilitated to near-visual onsets in the location marker condition. It is concluded that under more natural viewing conditions the latency of saccades is likely to be modulated by the eccentricity of target stimuli. This effect can be explained by competitive attentional interactions in saccade target selection processes...|$|E
40|$|The {{simplest}} attentional task, detecting a cued stimulus in {{an otherwise}} <b>empty</b> <b>visual</b> <b>field,</b> produces complex patterns of performance. Attentional cues interact with backward masks and with spatial uncertainty, {{and there is a}} dissociation in the effects of these variables on accuracy and on response time. A computational theory of performance in this task is described. The theory links visual encoding, masking, spatial attention, visual short-term memory (VSTM), and perceptual decision making in an integrated dynamic framework. The theory assumes that decisions are made by a diffusion process driven by a neurally plausible, shunting VSTM. The VSTM trace encodes the transient outputs of early visual filters in a durable form that is preserved for the time needed to make a decision. Attention increases the efficiency of VSTM encoding, either by increasing the rate of trace formation or by reducing the delay before trace formation begins. The theory provides a detailed, quantitative account of attentional effects in spatial cuing tasks at the level of response accuracy and the response time distributions...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the effects of spatial preening on identification of a single object appearing in an otherwise <b>empty</b> <b>visual</b> <b>field.</b> A digit target was preceded by a valid, neutral, or invalid location cue, presented either peripherally or centrally. The target was followed by either a single mask or multiple masks covering the target and nontarget (empty) locations. Precuing significantly affected identification accuracy when multiple masks were used but had little effect when the target was followed by a single mask. The results strongly favor a model in which spatial precuing allows the contents of noncued locations to be excluded from decision (and possibly perception). Exclusion may or may hot facilitate performance, depending on what is there to be excluded. The role of spatial visual attention in modulating perception has intrigued psychologists for a long time. Helmholtz (1866 / 1924) noted that in a completely dark room, a person can concentrate his attention on any part of the room, so that when a spark of light illuminates the whole room, he will get an impression about the objects in that particular regio...|$|E

40|$|In three experiments, we {{investigated}} the spatial allocation {{of attention in}} response to central gaze cues. In particular, we examined whether the allocation of attentional resources is influenced by context information—that is, {{the presence or absence}} of reference objects (i. e., placeholders) in the periphery. On each trial, gaze cues were followed by a target stimulus to which participants had to respond by keypress or by performing a target-directed saccade. Targets were presented either in an <b>empty</b> <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> (Exps. 1 and 2) or in previewed location placeholders (Exp. 3) and appeared at one of either 18 (Exp. 1) or six (Exps. 2 and 3) possible positions. The spatial distribution of attention was determined by comparing response times as a function of the distance between the cued and target positions. Gaze cueing was not specific to the exact cued position, but instead generalized equally to all positions in the cued hemifield, when no context information was provided. However, gaze direction induced a facilitation effect specific to the exact gazed-at position when reference objects were presented. We concluded that the presence of possible objects in the periphery to which gaze cues could refer is a prerequisite for attention shifts being specific to the gazed-at position...|$|E
40|$|Subjects {{reached in}} {{three-dimensional}} space {{to a set}} of remembered targets whose position was varied randomly from trial to trial, but always fell along a "virtual" line (line condition). Targets were presented briefly, one-by-one and in an <b>empty</b> <b>visual</b> <b>field.</b> After a short delay, subjects were required to point to the remembered target location. Under these conditions, the target was presented in the complete absence of allocentric visual cues as to its position in space. However, because the subjects were informed prior to the experiment that all targets would fall on a straight line, they could conceivably imagine each point target as belonging to a single rigid object with a particular geometry and orientation in space, although this virtual object was never explicitly shown to the subjects. We compared the responses to repeated measurements of each target with those measured for targets presented in a directionally neutral configuration (sphere condition), and used the variable errors to infer the putative reference frames underlying the corresponding sensorimotor transformation. Performance in the different tasks was compared under two different lighting conditions (dim light or total darkness) and two memory delays (0. 5 or 5 s). The pattern of variable errors differed significantly between the sphere condition and the line condition. In the former case, the errors were always accounted for by egocentric reference frames. By contrast the errors in the line condition revealed both egocentric and allocentric components, consistent with the hypothesis that target information can be defined concurrently in both egocentric and allocentric frames of reference, resulting in two independent coexisting representations...|$|E

To investigate the influence of <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> initial sensitivity on the rate of <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> progression. Methods. A minimum of five <b>visual</b> <b>fields</b> were performed using computerized perimetry (Octopus) over a mean follow- up 4 -year period (48. 85 ± 17. 84 months) in 64 persons (114 eyes) with primary open angle glaucoma. The rate of change of the whole central <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> and each of the seven regions of the field were measured by linear regression analysis of the mean sensitivity value versus time. Based on the slope of the regression line of <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> mean sensitivity over time the eyes were divided into two groups: the group with stable and the group with progressive <b>visual</b> <b>field.</b> The comparison of the mean sensitivity of the whole central <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> between the groups was performed using the Mann-Whitney U-test. The Spearman rang correlation coefficient and the Spearman probability p values were calculated to assess the mean sensitivity of the whole central <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> and of each <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> regions determined {{at the beginning of the}} study. Results. The initial mean sensitivity of the whole central <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> was lower in the group with progressive <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> (16. 62 ± 6. 35 dB). Correlation between the initial mean sensitivity and the slope of the regression line was negative. The lowest mean sensitivity was in the group with progressive <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> in the upper temporal (13. 73 ± 7. 35 dB), nasal (14. 74 ± 7. 23 dB) and upper nasal (15. 03 ± 7. 75 dB) regions.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that attentional resolution is greater in the lower than in the upper visual lfield. As there is no corresponding asymmetry between the areas in the primary visual cortex where the input from upper and lower <b>visual</b> <b>fields</b> is processed, an 'attentional filter' has been proposed to act in one or more higher visual cortical areas in order to constrict the availability of visual information to the level of awareness. To investigate this, a visual search array was presented to the entire <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> and reaction times from upper and lower <b>visual</b> <b>fields</b> compared. In a second experiment, subjects were trained in detecting targets in different <b>visual</b> <b>fields.</b> There {{was no significant difference between}} reaction times for targets presented in either upper or lower <b>visual</b> <b>fields</b> when the array was presented to the entire <b>visual</b> <b>field.</b> However, when the array was restricted to either the upper or lower <b>visual</b> <b>fields,</b> reaction times were significantly slower for detection in the upper <b>visual</b> <b>field...</b>|$|R

40|$|AIM—To {{compare the}} {{frequency}} and site of <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> progression and changes in visual acuity in patients with normal pressure glaucoma (NPG) with and without pre-existing <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> loss.  METHOD—Patients with normal tension glaucoma were selected who had at least 10  visual fields over 5  or more years of follow up and no other condition that might influence the <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> or <b>visual</b> acuity. Alternate left and right eyes were selected from patients in random order. These eyes were then subdivided according to <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> defect threatening fixation, <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> defect not threatening fixation, and no <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> defect (fellow eyes). Eyes were defined as showing a threat to fixation {{according to the presence}} of a <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> defect involving one of more of four paracentral <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> locations. Pointwise linear regression analysis was applied to each <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> series using PROGRESSOR software. Progression of <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> loss was defined as the appearance of a regression slope 1  dB per year or more with a significance of p< 0. 01, which remained consistent with the addition of two of three successive <b>visual</b> <b>fields</b> to the series. The number of patients showing progression and the number where progression occurred in one of the four paracentral <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> locations was noted. The number of eyes losing two or more lines of Snellen visual acuity over the follow up period was also noted.  RESULTS— 174 eyes of 174  patients were selected. 106  eyes had <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> loss threatening fixation, 46  eyes had <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> loss that did not threaten fixation, and 22  were fellow eyes with normal <b>visual</b> <b>fields.</b> The median follow up was 7. 2  years. Eight eyes (36. 4 %) in the "normal visual fields" group, 31  eyes (67. 4 %) in the "visual field loss away from fixation" group, and 87  eyes (82. 1 %) in the "threat to fixation" group showed progression in any part of the <b>visual</b> <b>field.</b> Two eyes (9. 1 %) in the "normal visual fields" group, nine eyes (19. 6 %) in the "visual field loss away from fixation" group, and 45  eyes (42. 5 %) in the "threat to fixation" group showed progression at "threat to fixation". The Cox proportional hazards regression model showed an increased risk of progression at any part of the <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> for female sex and a decreased risk for eyes with normal <b>visual</b> <b>fields.</b> For progression at threat to fixation this model showed an increased risk with pre-existing threat to fixation. Eyes from older patients and those that went on to have progressive <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> loss at fixation were more likely to lose two lines of Snellen visual acuity over the follow up period.  CONCLUSION—Since 20 - 30 % of previously field damaged eyes and over 60 % without prior field loss fail to demonstrate progressive <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> damage over a long follow up it is recommended that normal pressure glaucoma patients be monitored for progression and that potentially harmful therapy be withheld until progression is demonstrated. Although the presence of <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> loss that threatens fixation does not constitute an increased risk of <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> progression it does indicate an increased risk of further loss of <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> close to fixation which is in turn associated with loss of central acuity. In the light of this finding, patients with <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> loss that threatens fixation should be managed more aggressively. ...|$|R

Areas under the ROC curve for loss and gain in <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> were. 78 and. 91, respectively, both reaching statistical significance (P< 0. 05). Comparisons of predicted vs. expected values showed no departure from goodness of fit for both losses and gains in <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> compared to no change (both P< 0. 05).; Conclusions: At the population level, <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> impairment and 4 -year loss in <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> increases the risk of disability. The effect of change in <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> on disability varies by and is greater in the presence of pre-existing levels of <b>visual</b> impairment (<b>visual</b> <b>field</b> and <b>visual</b> acuity). Routinely measured variables during ophthalmological consultations can help clinicians to predict future changes in <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> and help inform strategies to reduce the impact of visual impairment on future levels of disability...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{extent of}} the {{horizontal}} <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> was determined behaviourally in 4 pigmented and 5 albino ferrets (Mustela putorius furo, Carnivora, Mammalia) using perimetry. During binocular vision, all pigmented and three albino ferrets responded equally well to stimuli presented anywhere along the horizontal perimeter in the central 180 ° of the <b>visual</b> <b>field.</b> The remaining two albinos had a <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> defect in the right hemifield (> 30 ° eccentricity). During monocular vision, {{a significant difference between}} the <b>visual</b> <b>fields</b> of pigmented and albino ferrets became apparent. In pigmented ferrets, the <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> of each eye included the ipsilateral (temporal) and a substantial portion of the contralateral (nasal) hemifield. In albinos, the <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> of each eye was limited to the ipsilateral hemifield and reactions to visual stimuli abruptly declined directly beyond the vertical meridian...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> asymmetry and {{the orientation of}} Chinese words was investigated {{in the context of}} a threshold recognition task given to a sample of thirty one Singaporean Chinese. One-, two-, and three-character words were projected to the left or right <b>visual</b> <b>fields</b> in either horizontal or vertical format. A right <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> advantage was observed for all word sizes. The effect of orientation was complex. Performance under left <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> presentation was clearly superior for vertically oriented words. However, for right <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> presentation, performance in horizontal displays was critically dependent on word size. Two-letter words were identified significantly better than three-letter words. Two explanations of these effects were considered and it was concluded that orientation has marked implications for <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> asymmetries in decoding Chinese orthography...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> {{changes in}} patients with pituitary adenomas following trans-sphenoidal surgery. Methods: Eighteen patients with pituitary adenomas underwent a complete ophthalmic assessment and <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> analysis using the Humphrey Field Analyzer 30 - 2 program before and after trans-sphenoidal surgical resection at the Himalayan Institute of Medical Sciences over a one year period. Visual acuity, duration of symptoms, optic nerve head changes, pattern of <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> defects, and variables such as mean deviation and <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> index were compared. Results: Thirty-six eyes of 18 patients including 10 male and 8 female subjects with mean age of 35. 1 ± 9. 9 years and histologically proven pituitary adenoma were included. Mean visual acuity at presentation was 0. 29 logMAR which improved to 0. 21 logMAR postoperatively (P = 0. 305). Of 36 eyes, 24 (66. 7 %) had <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> defects including temporal defects in 12 eyes (33. 3 %), non-specific defects in 10 eyes (27. 8 %), and peripheral field constriction in 2 eyes (5. 6 %). Mean deviation of <b>visual</b> <b>fields</b> at presentation was - 14. 28 dB which improved to - 11. 32 dB postoperatively. The <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> index improved from 63. 5 % to 75 % postoperatively. Favorable <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> outcomes were correlated with shorter duration of symptoms and absence of optic nerve head changes at presentation. Conclusion: <b>Visual</b> <b>field</b> defects were present in two thirds of patients at presentation. An overall improvement in vision and <b>visual</b> <b>fields</b> was noted after surgical resection. An inverse correlation {{was found between the}} duration of symptoms and postoperative <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> recovery, signifying the importance of early surgical intervention...|$|R

To determine whether retinal vessel oxygen saturation is affected in primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) patients. METHODS. Retinal oxygen saturation in patients with POAG was measured in retinal vessels with a spectrophotometric retinal oximeter in darkness, and <b>visual</b> <b>fields</b> were obtained. Oxygen tension (Po(2)) was calculated from oxygen saturation values. Statistical analysis was performed using Pearson's correlation and Student's t-test. RESULTS. Mean oxygen saturation in venules was higher in persons with poor <b>visual</b> <b>fields</b> (68 % ± 4 %, mean ± SD) than in those with good <b>visual</b> <b>fields</b> (62 % ± 3 %; P = 0. 0018). The mean arteriovenous difference in oxygen saturation was lower in persons with poor <b>visual</b> <b>fields</b> (30 % ± 4 %, n = 9) than in those with good <b>visual</b> <b>fields</b> (37 % ± 4 %; P = 0. 0003; n = 12). No correlation was found between saturation in retinal arterioles and <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> mean defect (n = 31; r = - 0. 16; P = 0. 38). Oxygen saturation in retinal venules correlated positively with worsening <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> mean defect (r = 0. 43; P = 0. 015). Arteriovenous difference in oxygen saturation decreased significantly as the <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> mean defect worsened (r = - 0. 55; P = 0. 0013). Mean Po(2) in venules was 38 ± 3 mm Hg. It was significantly higher in persons with poor <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> fields (40 ± 3 mm Hg) than in those with good <b>visual</b> <b>fields</b> (36 ± 2 mm Hg; P = 0. 0016). CONCLUSIONS. Deeper glaucomatous <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> defects are associated with increased oxygen saturation in venules and decreased arteriovenous difference in retinal oxygen saturation. The data suggest that oxygen metabolism is affected in the glaucomatous retina, possibly related to tissue atrophy...|$|R
50|$|If {{the analogy}} of the eye's retina working as a sensor is drawn upon, the {{corresponding}} concept in human (and much of animal vision) is the <b>visual</b> <b>field.</b> It is defined as “the number of degrees of visual angle during stable fixation of the eyes”. Note that eye movements are excluded in the definition. Different animals have different <b>visual</b> <b>fields,</b> depending, among others, on {{the placement of the}} eyes. Humans have a slightly over 210-degree forward-facing horizontal arc of their <b>visual</b> <b>field,</b> while some birds have a complete or nearly complete 360-degree <b>visual</b> <b>field.</b> The vertical range of the <b>visual</b> <b>field</b> in humans is around 150 degrees.|$|R
