40|$|Enhancement {{of phase}} and {{intensity}} scintillation, as a radio {{line of sight}} scans through grazing incidence on the local L shell in the nightside diffuse-auroral ionosphere, {{has been well documented}} by means of data from the DNA Wideband satellite. In this paper we describe systematic behavior of the phase spectrum found in the <b>enhancement</b> <b>region</b> over Poker Flat, Alaska. Routine Wideband pro-cessing included spectral analysis of 20 -s (•,, 60 -km) segments of VHF and UHF phase records and log linear fits thereto. Tabulation of the resulting power law spectral indices, p, disclosed increased values in the scintillation <b>enhancement</b> <b>region.</b> It has been established that the increase in p is the signature of a physically real phenomenon and not merely an artifact of statistical nonstationarity arising from the narrowness of the scintillation strength enhancement. Moreover, it has been found that p is not increased in strength enhancements occurring close to the magnetic zenith. Indeed, in some cases, it is substantially decreased. A possible source of these unexpected spectral behaviors is size-dependent anisotropy, an idealization of the irregularities responsible being small-scale field-aligned rods imbed-ded in large-scale shell-aligned sheets. We also present examples of multiple-regime power law spectra, characterized by an increased spectral index at short structure wavelengths (less than a few hundred meters north-south) and, more frequently, by an increased index at large wavelengths (more than a few kilometers). These spectral breaks occur both separately and together and both within and outside the scintillation <b>enhancement</b> <b>region...</b>|$|E
30|$|Our {{strategy}} for fluorescence enhancement was to disperse as-synthesized Au 1 Ag 4 @SiO 2 NPs into FITC solution. The fluorescence of the FITC solution was improved {{with the addition}} of Au 1 Ag 4 @SiO 2 NPs due to PEF. However, the field <b>enhancement</b> <b>region</b> of metal NPs are confined in close vicinity to the surface of plasmonic metal NPs and the fluorescence enhancement is very sensitive to the surrounding environment of metal NPs [2], such as the space between fluorescent molecule and metal NPs. Thus, the previous enhanced fluorescence of FITC by the Au 1 Ag 4 @SiO 2 NPs was dramatically quenched again when Fe 3 + was dropped into the FITC/Au 1 Ag 4 @SiO 2 solution. The fluorescence quenching is possibly attributed to the complexation action between the isothiocyanate group of FITC and Fe 3 +, which resulted that FITC molecule was away from the field <b>enhancement</b> <b>region</b> of Au 1 Ag 4 @SiO 2 NPs (Fig.  1).|$|E

40|$|Crosses {{involving}} certain B-A translocations {{produce a}} reduced size of endosperm when those {{regions of the}} A chromosomes are missing in the sperm that fertilizes the polar nuclei. Previous studies involving the long arm of chromosome 10 showed that additional copies of this segment introduced through the maternal side could not rescue the reduced size phenotype conditioned by the corresponding deficiency in the paternal gamete. In this paper, experiments are described showing that other segments introduced maternally produce an even smaller kernel when fertilized by a sperm missing the same A chromosome segment or other ones that carry factors affecting endosperm size. —The example analyzed in detail involves reciprocal crosses between TB- 4 Sa and TB- 10 L 19. Extra doses of 4 S enhance the small kernel effect normally produced by TB- 10 L 19. The additional copies of 4 S {{have no effect on}} kernel mass when the 10 L segment is present in the paternal contribution to the endosperm. The maternal enhancement by 4 S is also effective with crosses by TB- 1 La but not by TB- 1 Sb. A survey of inter se crosses of B-A translocations shows that, when the maternal enhancement occurs, it is confined to those regions that themselves give a small kernel effect when used as a male. This correlation is strengthened by the observations that TB- 10 L 19 enhances the small kernel effect of TB- 1 Sb, but TB- 10 L 32 will not. Since these two B- 10 L translocations span the best localized small kernel effect region, this result supports the correlation of maternal <b>enhancement</b> <b>regions</b> with the paternal small kernel effect ones. —Because the enhancement can be attributed to a dosage effect and because the <b>enhancement</b> <b>regions</b> are coincident with the small kernel segments, it is postulated that this interacting system is analogous to aneuploid effects in diploid tissues but exhibits unique properties because of the evolutionary history and triploid condition of the endosperm...|$|R

This process is accompanied by the presence of a concentrated vortex {{off the edge of the}} side plate and diffuser effect of the wing. At a critical height, the vortex breaks down and its contribution to the downforce is lost. This creates a change in the gradient of the downforce slope. The force enhancement process continues as the height of the wing is reduced (region B); the main diffuser effect is still present. The downforce is lost below a height where the maximum downforce is reached, due to large separation on the wing (region C).

40|$|The bel 1 gene {{of human}} spumaretrovirus (HSRV) encodes a 300 -amino-acid nuclear protein termed Bel 1 {{that is a}} potent {{activator}} of transcription from the cognate long terminal repeat (LTR). Bel 1 can also efficiently activate the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) LTR. We have previously shown that the amino-terminal 227 -residue region (minimal activator region) of Bel 1 can activate the HSRV LTR at low levels and that two distinct domains within the carboxy-terminal 73 residues, from residues 255 to 266 and 272 to 300, that bear little sequence homology can independently enhance {{the activity of the}} minimal activator domain (L. K. Venkatesh, C. Yang, P. A. Theodorakis, and G. Chinnadurai, J. Virol. 67 : 161 - 169, 1993). We now report on the further characterization of these two transcriptional <b>enhancement</b> <b>regions.</b> Mutational analysis of the region comprising residues 255 to 266 indicates that a cluster of leucine residues is critical to the function of this region. Also, residues 273 to 287, which are identical in sequence to a 15 -amino-acid segment near the carboxy terminus of the simian foamy virus transcriptional activator Taf, can independently enhance the activity of the minimal activator region. To delineate the region(s) of Bel 1 that could function autonomously as an activator domain, we tested the activity of chimeric proteins comprising either wild-type or functionally defective forms of Bel 1 fused to the DNA binding domain, Gal 4 (1 - 147), of the yeast transcriptional activator Gal 4 on a synthetic promoter comprising Gal 4 DNA binding sites linked to the adenovirus E 1 B TATA box (minimal promoter). Gal 4 -Bel 1 was found to activate basal transcription from the E 1 B TATA box at least 35 -fold, and the region responsible for this activation function was localized to the carboxy-terminal 73 amino acids. When the transcriptional <b>enhancement</b> <b>regions</b> were tested for autonomous activator function as Gal 4 (1 - 147) chimeras, residues 272 to 300, but not 255 to 266, were found to activate transcription efficiently when targeted to the E 1 B TATA motif and also to HSRV and HIV- 1 LTRs. The highly conserved region between amino acids 273 and 287 alone was found to activate transcription efficiently when targeted to the HSRV LTR but not to the E 1 B TATA box or the HIV- 1 LTR. Thus, our results demonstrate that the carboxy-terminal 29 -amino-acid region (residues 272 to 300) contributes to Bel 1 transactivation by functioning as an autonomous activator of TATA motif-directed transcription {{in a manner similar to}} that of other modular transcriptional activators.

Methods: 23 GBM patients were assessed by [18 F]-FMISO PET and conventional and perfusion MRI prior to surgery. The level and location of hypoxia ([18 F]-FMISO uptake, evaluated by tumor/blood ratio, T/B), vascularization (cerebral blood volume, CBV) and vascular permeability (contrast enhancement after gadolinium injection) were analyzed. The spatial relationship between tumor hypoxia and angiogenesis was assessed by an overlap analysis of the volume of [18 F]-FMISO uptake and the volumes of the high CBV regions and the contrast <b>enhancement</b> <b>regions.</b> Results: A significant correlation was found between hypoxia and hypervascularization, especially for their maximum values (T/Bmax vs. rCBVmax: r = 0. 61, P = 0. 002) and their volumes (hypoxia vs. hypervascularization: r = 0. 91, P < 0. 001). A large proportion of the high CBV volumes collocated with hypoxia (81. 3 %) and with contrast enhancement (46. 5 %).

We impose the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) condition on the medium. Linear, cubic, and quintic susceptibilities, considered simultaneously with the dressing effect, {{are included in the}} analysis. Generally, the beams slowly expand during propagation and new vortices are induced, commonly appearing in oppositely charged pairs. We demonstrate that not only the form and the topological charge of the incident beam, but also its growing size in the medium greatly affect the formation and evolution of vortices. We formulate common rules for finding the number of induced vortices and the corresponding rotation directions, stemming from the initial conditions of various incident beams, {{as well as from the}} dynamical aspects of their propagation.

40|$|Growth {{factors and}} cytokines play an {{important}} role in supporting cellular viability of various tissues during development due to their ability to suppress the default cell death program in each cell type. To date, neither the triggering molecule nor the transduction pathway of these default apoptosis programs is understood. In this study, we explored the possibility that cytokine receptors are involved in modulating cytokine withdrawal-induced apoptosis (CWIA) in hematopoietic cells. Expression of the exogenous cytokine receptor common β chain (βc), but not the α chains, accelerated CWIA in multiple cytokine-dependent cell lines. Reduction of the expression level of endogenous βc by antisense transcripts resulted in prolonged survival during cytokine deprivation, suggesting a critical role of βc in modulating CWIA. Fine mapping of the βc subunit revealed that a membrane-proximal cytoplasmic sequence, designated the death <b>enhancement</b> <b>region</b> (DER), was critical to the death acceleration effect of βc. Furthermore, DER accelerated cell death either as a chimeric membrane protein or as a cytosolic protein, suggesting that DER functions independently of the cytokine receptor and membrane anchorage. Cross-linking of the chimeric membrane-bound DER molecules by antibody or of the FK 506 -binding protein–DER fusion protein by a synthetic dimerizing agent, AP 1510, did not abrogate the death acceleration effect. Transient transfection assays further indicated that DER promoted cell death in the absence of serum in the nonhematopoietic 293 cell line.

However, the electric fields were usually quite small during the period of observation, making the quest for an explanation for the structures all the more challenging. Keywords.

40|$|Image fusion {{integrates}} {{complementary information}} from various perspectives {{in order to}} provide a meaningful interpretation of useful features and textures in multisource images. Here, we present a multiresolution algorithm based on Stationary Wavelet Transform for fusion of two test images of same size. The algorithm uses a Gaussian low-pass filtering technique for the high frequency subbands of SWT decomposition. The new approach gave sharper edges and structural <b>enhancement</b> than <b>region</b> based approaches involving calculation of energy around salient features. The key feature of Gaussian filtering is the flexibility of using filters with different values for standard deviation depending on the application and the range of detail necessary for processing...|$|R
30|$|In {{differential}} diagnosis {{list of the}} tumors presenting in the third ventricle, {{there are plenty of}} tumors such as colloid cyst, meningioma, germinoma, craniopharyngioma, lymphoma, choroid plexus papilloma, subependymal giant cell astrocytoma, chiasmatic and hypothalamic benign astrocytoma. Ring <b>enhancement</b> of this <b>region</b> pathology is a peculiar sign for glioblastoma, yet not pathognomonic. Tumor histology is crucial to yield the final diagnosis.|$|R
