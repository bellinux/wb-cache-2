50|$|Because most {{commercial}} griddle {{plates are}} made from the same material the heat transfer characteristics of a <b>griddle</b> <b>plate</b> can commonly be inferred from its geometry. A carbon steel plate heated by an array of U-shaped or H-shaped burners does not distribute heat in a perfectly even pattern, even if all thermostats are set to the same temperature and are perfectly calibrated. As a result, temperature ‘islands’ can develop on the <b>griddle</b> <b>plate</b> surface, resulting in measurable hot and cold spots that can affect griddle performance.|$|E
5000|$|Griddles with manual {{controls}} require constant {{attention by}} an operator {{to control the}} temperature of the <b>griddle</b> <b>plate.</b> Without food products to remove the heat from a griddle surface, the unregulated heat source can cause the plate surface temperature to rise continuously until it levels out at temperatures well beyond those normally used for cooking (over [...] ). At these temperatures the <b>griddle</b> <b>plate</b> material may take on a bluish tint as the surface of the carbon steel plate oxidizes. Manual controls are not typically used on electric griddles.|$|E
5000|$|In {{residential}} applications a griddle may {{be composed}} of stainless steel, wrought iron, aluminum or carbon steel typically 1/16 to 1/8-inch (1.6 to 3.2mm) thick. Portable electric units with limited temperature control are most common, often with Teflon or other stick-resistant coatings. These units are highly portable and suitable for light-duty cooking. Portable <b>griddle</b> <b>plates</b> are commonly used on one or more gas or electric cooking zones (a single zone unit may be considered a [...] "frying pan"). Premium brand residential ranges offer griddle top options as well, which look much like those on commercial grade ranges.|$|R
5000|$|The MATS/2.6 is a scatterable Italian circular, plastic-cased minimum metal blast {{resistant}} anti-tank blast mine. It {{is very similar}} to the MATS/2, except that it uses a smooth pressure plate rather than a <b>griddle</b> pressure <b>plate.</b> It uses a pneumatic fuse which is resistant to shock and blast similar to the fuze fitted to the TS-50. The mine's plastic case is waterproof, and the mine can be scattered from a helicopter.|$|R
50|$|Introduced in 1955, the CG {{maintained}} {{the inner workings}} of the W-2, but had sleek modern styling. The CG features removable plates, allowing the waffle plate to be removed so it can be replaced by a sandwich grilling plate. The sandwich grilling plates also allow the CG to be used as a <b>griddle</b> or hot <b>plate,</b> in effect having three appliances in one.|$|R
50|$|Electric griddles are {{typically}} {{made of a}} thinner plate material than a similar gas griddle to improve the heat transfer between the bottom-mounted elements and the cooking surface. Elements used to heat the griddle {{are typically}} 4-5 kilowatt (kW) per linear foot, and made from round rod sheathed incoloy material whose geometry is designed to optimize temperature distribution across the plate. The round elements have a tangential point of contact with the <b>griddle</b> <b>plate</b> and are commonly {{held in place by}} a clamping bracket or plate. More than one element per linear foot is common, and an array of these elements is required to heat a <b>griddle</b> <b>plate</b> of any given width. Electric griddles tend to be less expensive than a gas unit of similar size, due largely to the reduced plate thickness, but also the generally lower cost of construction and reduced sophistication of most electric griddle control systems.|$|E
50|$|Another {{important}} aspect of this control is the bypass flame setting, which allows gas to bypass {{the control of the}} thermostat diaphragm and allows the burner to operate irrespective of thermostat set point. If the bypass setting is too high and the <b>griddle</b> <b>plate</b> is not being cooled by cooking loads, the surface temperature of the griddle can drift well beyond the thermostatic set point.|$|E
50|$|A common {{technique}} {{to reduce the}} time-to-response of a thermostat is to mill a slot into the bottom side of a <b>griddle</b> <b>plate</b> and “embed” the thermostat bulb in closer proximity to the griddle surface. This construction reduces the thermostat response time in approximate proportion to {{the distance to the}} griddle surface. Specification sheets or product literature will indicate embedded construction through use of key words like ‘embedded’ or indicate a specific probe proximity to the plate surface that is less than the plate thickness.|$|E
5000|$|Heavy chrome plating, {{known as}} “hard chrome” from {{hexavalent}} baths, {{is the more}} common form used on commercial <b>griddles.</b> As <b>plating</b> thickness is increased, the surface finish of the underlying steel must be smoother, as the plating {{does not have a}} leveling effect. [...] Also because chrome plating is so hard (65 to 69 Rockwell scale), it is subject to damage if the underlying surface deforms during impacts from metal spatulas or pots and pans. Consequently, a quenched and tempered alloy steel such as A514 is frequently used for commercial cooking applications. That type of steel has three times the yield strength of common structural steel such as A36 which might otherwise be used for griddles.|$|R
50|$|Grilling {{is a form}} {{of cooking}} that {{involves}} dry heat applied to the surface of food, commonly from above or below. Grilling usually involves a significant amount of direct, radiant heat, and tends to be used for cooking meat quickly. Food to be grilled is cooked on a grill (an open wire grid such as a gridiron with a heat source above or below), a grill pan (similar to a frying pan, but with raised ridges to mimic the wires of an open grill), or <b>griddle</b> (a flat <b>plate</b> heated from below).|$|R
25|$|<b>Griddles</b> {{are flat}} <b>plates</b> of metal used for frying, {{grilling}} and making pan breads such as pancakes, injera, tortillas, chapatis and crepes. Traditional iron griddles are circular, with a semicircular hoop fixed to opposite {{edges of the}} plate and rising above it to form a central handle. Rectangular griddles that cover two stove burners are now also common, as are griddles that have a ribbed area {{that can be used}} like a grill pan. Some have multiple square metal grooves enabling the contents to have a defined pattern, similar to a waffle maker. Like frypans, round griddles are generally measured by diameter (20–30cm).|$|R
50|$|A {{common side}} effect {{associated}} with the unregulated temperatures of these griddle products is for the front rail of the <b>griddle</b> <b>plate</b> (sometimes called a “bullnose”) to become exceptionally hot - often well in excess of surface temperature criteria outlined in UL 197 Section 50.2. This area of the griddle is open to casual contact by an operator, and can often lead to burns on unprotected skin. Some manufacturers have incorporated unique designs, sometimes called “cool bullnose technology”, to minimize temperature excess in this zone and reduce the potential for operator injury.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} {{construction}} for countertop griddle and range-top griddle thermostat applications is to fasten the bulb {{to the bottom}} of the <b>griddle</b> <b>plate</b> and protect the bulb from direct contact from the heating element (gas or electric) so that it can sense the change in the plate temperature. This is referred to as a “bottom mounted” thermostat, and discounting the control type, will result in the longest response time due to the thickness of the material. In general, if no mention is made of thermostat mounting or proximity to the griddle surface, the thermostat is bottom mounted.|$|E
50|$|Grooved griddle {{surfaces}} {{are a common}} plate modification for commercial applications. Typically done to allow a sufficiently hot griddle to create branding marks similar to what might be found on a grill, but without {{the need to maintain}} two pieces of equipment for that purpose. The geometry of the grooves is typically unique for each manufacturer, and tapered {{from the back of the}} <b>griddle</b> <b>plate</b> towards the front to facilitate the drainage of grease and other fluids. Effective cleaning of a grooved griddle can be performed with a wire or palmetto bristle brush, and many manufacturers provide a custom scraper designed to fit the geometry of the groove pattern.|$|E
50|$|The vast {{majority}} of commercial grade griddles are made from A36 steel from 3/8 to 1 in thick, though some are composed of stainless steel or even composites of aluminum and stainless steel of varying thicknesses. <b>Griddle</b> <b>plate</b> depth (front-to-back) is typically 24-inches (610mm), though compact units may be as shallow as 18 in, and deep units can be up to 30 in in depth. Typical commercial gas griddles have plates between 3/4 and 1-inch thick (19 to 25mm). Electric griddle plates are typically thinner, from 3/8 to 1/2 in thick, to reduce the response lag between the control and plate surface common in such designs (less material improves heat transfer time).|$|E
50|$|Clarke and Macrae {{took their}} {{prototype}} to Bedford Modern School baths, which were closed for such occasions. Clarke {{was an excellent}} swimmer {{and was able to}} propel himself through the water with a prototype bomb attached to a keeper plate on webbing around his waist. Clarke practised attaching the bomb to a metal <b>griddle</b> <b>plate</b> taken from the family kitchen that was used to simulate the hull of a ship. At first, the magnetic adhesion to the keeper plate proved so great that it was difficult to remove the bomb, so the plate was made smaller to reduce the strength of its hold. They also adjusted the bomb to have a slightly positive buoyancy, which was found to be advantageous. Having developed the weapon thus far, it was duly named the limpet mine after the marine sea creature - the limpet, a gastropod well known for its ability to adhere to rocks.|$|E
50|$|Solid-state {{controls}} {{are used in}} gas and electric applications at the high range of the performance and cost spectrum. Composed of two parts, the sensor probe and the control box, solid state thermostats are the most precise control available for griddle operation. The probe consists of two thermocouple wires mounted in a protective capillary tube body that is mounted (typically threaded) into the <b>griddle</b> <b>plate</b> material at a location {{near the center of}} the heating element being controlled. When a temperature variation is detected the probe sends an electrical signal to the control box, which consists of an electrical circuit board that then activates or deactivates the burner system. This control system can respond almost instantly to temperature changes on the griddle surface, which provides a far superior temperature control response to the fluid filled capillary bulb found in Modulating and Snap Action thermostats. Temperature consistency to set point of +/- 5F is typical.|$|E
5000|$|Thermostats {{are used}} to {{regulate}} the griddle surface around a temperature set point established by the operator. Ranges of operation can {{vary depending on the}} controls used and the construction of the griddle, but [...] is most common.Other than solid state controls, which are very sensitive across their entire range of control, snap-action and modulating (aka - throttling) thermostats have peak sensitivity across the middle two-thirds of their operating range. This can limit their overall performance {{at the low end of}} their temperature spectrum (at or below [...] ). This is due to the nature of the temperature control mechanism, which consists of a fluid-filled bulb (typically an oil) connected to the thermostat control via a long narrow capillary tube. The fluid in the bulb expands and contracts with temperature, activating a control response from the thermostat. There is a time lag between sensing the temperature change from the surface of the <b>griddle</b> <b>plate</b> to the response of the fluid within the bulb, to the thermostat control and turning the heat source on or off, up or down. This lag is referred to as hysteresis, and is a primary aspect of recovery time - an important griddle performance metric.|$|E
