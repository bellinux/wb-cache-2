5|$|Desiderius Erasmus's early sixteenth-century {{collection}} of Latin proverbs included Turdus malum sibi ipse cacat, (the thrush himself excretes his own trouble), {{which refers to}} the use of the sticky berries favoured by this species to make birdlime for trapping birds. The thrush <b>is</b> <b>literally</b> spreading the seeds of his own destruction.|$|E
5|$|Doctor Leonard McCoy (DeForest Kelley) is {{concerned}} that the increasing numbers of tribbles threaten to consume all the food aboard the Enterprise. It is discovered that they are entering ship systems, interfering with their functions, and consuming any edible contents present. Kirk realizes that if the tribbles are getting into the ship's stores, they are {{a threat to the}} grain aboard the station. He examines the holds but learns that it is already too late: The tribbles have indeed eaten the quadrotriticale, and Kirk <b>is</b> <b>literally</b> buried in grain-gorged tribbles when he opens a grain hold with an overhead hatch. Spock (Leonard Nimoy) and McCoy discover that about half the tribbles in the hold are dead and many of the rest are dying, alerting them that the grain has been poisoned.|$|E

25|$|The very {{functioning}} of language itself <b>is</b> <b>literally</b> a {{theme in the}} play, with particular emphasis placed {{on its ability to}} represent by means of signs (semiosis), the power of language to sway, the aggressive potential of language, the failure of language to adequately describe reality and the manipulation of language so as to hide the truth.|$|E
25|$|Central Maui {{consists}} {{primarily of}} Kahului and Wailuku. Kahului <b>is</b> <b>literally</b> {{the center of}} the island, and tends to keep steady, high temperatures throughout the year. The micro-climate in Kahului can be at times muggy, but it usually feels relatively dry and is often very breezy. The Wailuku area is set closer to the West Maui Mountain range. Here, more rainfall will be found throughout the year, and higher humidity levels.|$|E

25|$|Michael Benthall's 1955 Old Vic production, {{starring}} Katharine Hepburn and Robert Helpmann. Benthall {{had failed}} to cast Helpmann as Katherina in 1948, but in 1955, he cast him as Petruchio in a production noted for excess; Katherina <b>is</b> <b>literally</b> hung upside-down from the rafters, she beats Petruchio with a slipper, he spends much of the play leaping over furniture and brandishing his whip. After a successful run at the Old Vic, the play went on tour to Australia.|$|E
25|$|Paul {{describes}} God as declaring Jesus {{to be the}} Son of God {{by raising}} him from the dead, and Sanders argues Mark portrays God as adopting Jesus as his son at his baptism, although many others do not accept this interpretation of Mark. Sanders argues that for Jesus to be hailed as the Son of God {{does not mean that}} he <b>is</b> <b>literally</b> God's offspring. Rather, it indicates a very high designation, one who stands in a special relation to God.|$|E
25|$|This {{does not}} mean that Sanders {{believes}} God’s knowledge of the future is “limited” as some critics have charged. Rather, Sanders holds that what is referred to as “the” future is not an ontological reality—it does not exist. If it is does not exist then there <b>is</b> <b>literally</b> “no thing” or actuality for God to know. Open theists are not saying that there is a reality about which God is ignorant (which would be limited omniscience). The denial that God has exhaustive definite foreknowledge of future contingent events has been the single most controversial aspect of open theism.|$|E

25|$|In 2002, Kaurna scholar Georgina Yambo Williams (co-authoring a {{paper with}} Robert Amery), {{provided}} a revised {{origin of the}} town's name. Drawing from her own knowledge and various literary sources from the period of colonisation, she relates that Yankalilla comes from the words yerkandi, meaning to fall to, to join onto, {{much in the way}} a disease does, and lya and illa, which means 'place'. Thus 'Yankalilla' <b>is</b> <b>literally</b> 'place of the fallen bits'. This is considered by Yambo Williams to be in reference to the Dreaming story of Tjilbruke, who carried his dead nephew's disintegrating body from (what is now called) the Sturt River to Yankalilla and then collapsed.|$|E
25|$|In Sanskrit, grantha <b>is</b> <b>literally</b> 'a knot'. It is a {{word that}} was used for books, and the script used to write them. This stems from the {{practice}} of binding inscribed palm leaves using a length of thread held by knots. Although Sanskrit is now mostly written with Devanagari, Grantha was widely used to write Sanskrit in the Tamil-speaking parts of South Asia until the 19th century. Scholars believe that the Grantha script was used when the Vedas were first put into writing around the 5th century CE. In the early 20th century, it began to be replaced by Devanagari in religious and scholarly texts and the Tamil script (with the use of diacritics) in popular texts.|$|E
25|$|The team's home {{stadium is}} Stade Jean-Bouin {{which has a}} {{capacity}} of 12,000. Guazzini {{made a decision to}} take a European quarter final match against Newcastle to the significantly larger Parc des Princes, which <b>is</b> <b>literally</b> across the street from Stade Jean-Bouin. Guazzini booked the national stadium of France, the 80,000 Stade de France for a Top 14 fixture against Toulouse. The move was successful, with 79,502 officially turning up for the game, smashing the regular season attendance record in France. At the end of the match, Guazzini announced that he had booked the venue for the Biarritz match – a rematch of the 2004–05 final. Stade Français drew an even larger crowd to the game (79,604), toppling the previous record set that same season.|$|E

25|$|On one stormy night, the landlord, Huang Shiren, {{and several}} of his other {{servants}} come to the temple to worship and provide offerings. Their trip is stopped by the thunderstorm. It just so happens that Xi'er is now in the temple too, and by the light of a flash of lightning, the landlord sees her—with her long white hair and shabby clothes that have been weathered to nearly white. He thinks it is the reincarnation of a goddess who has come to punish him for his mistreatment of Xi'er and other despotisms. He is so frightened that he <b>is</b> <b>literally</b> paralyzed. Xi'er recognizes that it is her arch-enemy and seizes the opportunity to take further revenge. She picks up the brass incense burner and hurls it against the landlord. The landlord and his gang flee.|$|E
25|$|Tuesday 1stMay. Hazy, raw. Yesty {{was very}} {{unfavorable}} {{for the general}} moving of our great city. High rents, incommodious dwellings, & necessity combine to crowd our streets with carts overloaded with furniture & hand barrows with sofas, chairs, sideboards, looking glasses & pictures, so as to render the sidewalks almost impassable. The practice of all moving on one day, & give up & hiring Houses in Feby is of an antient custom & when the city was small & inhabitants few in number, almost every body owned or continued for years tenants in the same houses. Few instances of removals were seen, but now N York <b>is</b> <b>literally</b> in an uproar for several days before & after the 1stofMay. This practice of move all, to strangers appears absurd, but it is attended with the advantage of affording a greater choice of abodes in the Feby quarter.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{entering}} the forest, Maruyama has José whistle {{since he is}} apparently {{the only one who}} can, while Paifu practices his whistling since José will eventually get exhausted. José, instead of getting fatigued from whistling, suddenly falls ill to the Monster Flu as well. Their fear of the monster finding them becomes a reality and they are attacked by the forest monster Baroaba. Maruyama holds his own against the behemoth and tells Paifu to start learning how to whistle immediately before they are killed. Although several attempts had been unsuccessful, Paifu finally prospered in whistling and Baroaba <b>is</b> <b>literally</b> downsized by the sound, proving the weakness true, and is pounded by Maruyama. Before Maruyama finishes him off, he discovers that Baroaba only attacks to protect the forest's rare wildlife; Baroaba apologizes for the misunderstanding and decides to help them get to their destination, the witch's house.|$|E

25|$|The Stainforth Trophy was {{designed}} by Robin Beresford. The trophy depicts in silver three supersonic aircraft and spiralling vapour trails soaring into the stratosphere. The artist also tried to display {{an awareness of the}} achievements of the Schneider Trophy Team in the design, being aware that these achievements resulted in the improved design and development, by R. J. Mitchell, of the Spitfire, which played such a major role in Britain's victory in World War II. In the design of the trophy, the artist has tried to show the Earth as seen by the astronauts, vapour trails ending in arrows to depict high speed altitude flight, and with an outward sweep to infinity, which suggests that the sky <b>is</b> <b>literally</b> the limit of man's achievement in the air. Into his design, he has incorporated a star and its orbit to evoke the achievements of science and the Royal Air Force motto Per ardua ad astra.|$|E
25|$|Rats, {{like most}} mammals, also form family groups {{of a mother}} and her young. This applies to both groups of males and females. However, rats are {{territorial}} animals, meaning that they usually act aggressively or scared of strange rats. Rats will fluff up their hair, hiss, squeal, and move their tails around when defending their territory. Rats will chase each other, groom each other, sleep in group nests, wrestle with each other, have dominance squabbles, communicate, and play in various other ways with each other. Huddling is an additional important part of rat socialization. Huddling is often supposed to have a heat-conserving function. Nestling rats especially depend on heat from their mother, since they cannot regulate their own temperature. Huddling is an extreme form of herding. Other forms of interaction include: crawling under, which <b>is</b> <b>literally</b> the act of crawling underneath one another; walking over, also explained in the name; allo-grooming, so-called to distinguish it from self-grooming; and nosing, where a rat gently pushes with its nose at another rat near the neck.|$|E
