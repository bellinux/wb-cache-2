25|$|With {{favourable}} {{weather and}} winds, Arun (who is coughing up blood) decides {{to resume the}} climb. Aakash remains at Camp 4 since there is insufficient oxygen for six climbers, and teaches Chand to use the camera. When the climbers reach the Balcony, a dangerous storm hits. Although Sameer Khanna tells the climbers to stay in one place, Arjun leaves for the south summit without telling anyone. Anjali notices that Arjun is missing; Arun tells Anjali and Tashi to go one way while he and Chand go the other. Arjun, who wanted to climb Everest without oxygen, passes out and is buried by snow. After a two-hour search, Arun and Chand tell Tashi and Anjali to stop; Arjun is probably dead. Searching a bit longer, Anjali and Tashi find Arjun's water bottle and his hand poking out of the snow. They dig him out; Arun and Chand join them, but Arjun refuses water and oxygen. Anjali calls Reena, a BNTV reporter <b>in</b> <b>Everest</b> base camp and Arjun's former lover. After Reena talks to him, Arjun accepts oxygen. When he tells mission sponsor Ramesh Roongta {{that he will not}} continue, Ramesh fears damage to his reputation and is furious. Aakash arrives from Camp 4 with three oxygen cylinders.|$|E
