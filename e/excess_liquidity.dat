Following the financial crisis of 2007–2008, governments in these countries found it necessary to bail out or nationalise their privately held banks to prevent systemic failure of the banking system when underlying hard or financial asset values were found to be grossly inflated and sometimes so near worthless there was no liquid market for them. This further increased the already high levels of public debt to a level the markets began to consider unsustainable, via increasing government bond interest rates, producing the ongoing European sovereign-debt crisis.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effects of <b>excess</b> global <b>liquidity</b> on a small open economy with {{vertical}} trade in a stochastic general equilibrium sticky price model. When a small open economy is characterized by vertical trade, then <b>excess</b> global <b>liquidity</b> may generate a contractionary effect on the economy. This is because <b>excess</b> global <b>liquidity</b> causes not only {{a reduction in the}} world interests rate but also global inflation, particularly, sharp increases in the price of commodities or raw materials, which inevitably cause a contraction in the economy from the intermediate goods trade. We develop a simple analytical two-sector sticky price model to show that {{the effects of}} global liquidity shocks through the vertical trade channel depend critically on the structure of vertical trade and the exchange rate policy regime. Furthermore, we show that, in a general infinite-period two-sector model, the dynamic effects of global liquidity through the vertical trade channel also depend on the degree of financial integration of the economy {{with the rest of the}} world. Finally, we find that the quantitative global liquidity spillover effects from vertical trade channel are larger than those from the interest rate channel...|$|R

40|$|We {{construct}} {{a model of}} valuation to assess the financial fragility {{of a set of}} firms in a closed economy. A firm is identified with a possibly infinite random sequence of benefits. Firms with negative benefits in a given period are said to be in distress and need liquidity to refinance their projects. Those liquidities must be obtained from firms with positive benefits (which represent <b>excess</b> <b>liquidities).</b> Distressed projects are refinanced to the extend that their need for liquidity does not exceed their endogenous continuation value. This value is, in turn, affected by current and future refinancing possibilities. We provide a recursive proceduure to compute this value when there is an aggregate liquidity constraint. We compare the allocation under a centralized coalition of firms with that of a decentralized competitive liquidity market. We show that the competitive market is more fragile because it does not value the possibility that a currently distressed firm could become a provider of liquidity some period in the future. That is, the market value of a firm can diverge from its social value due to externalities involving the ability of that firm to refinance other distressed firms in the future.
