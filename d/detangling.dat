25|$|Africans {{captured}} {{as slaves}} {{no longer had}} the sort of resources to practice hair grooming that they had had when home. Slaves adapted as best they could under the circumstances, finding sheep-fleece carding tools particularly useful for <b>detangling</b> their hair. They suffered from scalp diseases and infestations due to their deplorable living conditions. Slaves used varying remedies for disinfecting and cleansing their scalps, such as applying kerosene or cornmeal directly on the scalp with a cloth as they carefully parted the hair. For field work, male slaves shaved their hair and wore hats to protect their scalps against the sun. House slaves had to appear tidy and well-groomed. The men sometimes wore wigs mimicking their masters', or similar hairstyles, while the women typically plaited or braided their hair. During the 19th century, hair styling, especially among women, became more popular. Cooking grease such as lard, butter and goose grease, were used to moisturize the hair. Female slaves sometimes used hot butterknives to curl their hair.|$|E

40|$|Studies on the agreement, or {{congruence}}, between {{voters and}} parties have often found more congruence between higher educated voters and the parties {{for which they}} vote than between lower educated voters and their party selections. The literature offers two explanations for this finding. The first argues that lower educated voters vote ‘incorrectly’, selecting less congruent parties at the ballot box, {{despite the presence of}} a better alternative. The second posits that they lack policy offers for which to vote. This paper seeks to <b>detangle</b> these two explanations. Based on a dataset containing the positions of Belgian voters and parties on 23 policy statements, we find that inequality in opinion congruence is primarily the result of incorrect voting by lower educated voters. However, given Belgium’s political system—which increase the likelihood of policy offers attuned to lower educated voters, the education bias in parties’ policy offers is surprisingly high...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{the rapid}} {{accumulation}} of systems-level biological data, understanding the dynamic nature of cellular activity remains a difficult task. The {{reason is that}} most biological data are static, or only correspond to snapshots of cellular activity. In this study, we explicitly attempt to <b>detangle</b> the temporal complexity of biological networks by using compilations of time-series gene expression profiling data. We define a dynamic network module to be a set of proteins satisfying two conditions: (1) they form a connected component in the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network; and (2) their expression profiles form certain structures in the temporal domain. We develop an efficient mining algorithm to discover dynamic modules in a temporal network. Using yeast as a model system, we demonstrate {{that the majority of}} the identified dynamic modules are functionally homogeneous. Additionally, many of them provide insight into the sequential ordering of molecular events in cellular systems. Finally, we note that the applicability of our algorithm is not limited to the study of PPI networks, instead it is generally applicable to the combination of any type of network and time-series data. 1...|$|R

40|$|Values' {{have become}} a topic of {{discussion}} at the European level. This article tries to briefly track {{the reasons for this}} phenomenon as well as to <b>detangle</b> the foggy notion of 'values' in this context. The author differentiates between founding values, European ideas and common legal principles. All these different forms of European values differ in their respective legal and political character. Most importantly, they require a different level of European conformity. Special emphasis is given to the value of cultural diversity which can be considered, at most, a 'self-restrictive' value since it can be perceived from an inclusive perspective (including diversity within the states) or from an exclusive perspective (diversity amongst the states). Placing too much emphasis on the inclusive reading endangers the exclusive reading, and vice versa. In this context, the author refers to the new constitutional motto of the European Union as proposed by the constitutional treaty. Unlike the situation in Indonesia and South Africa (which both use the same motto) {{it does not seem to}} address subnational diversity. Instead, “United in diversity” aims at protecting national identities against excessive integration,and thus seems the very opposite of the US constitutional motto of “E pluribus unum”...|$|R

40|$|Natural fibers can be {{attractive}} reinforcing materials in thermosetting polymers {{due to their}} low density and high specific mechanical properties. Although the research effort in this area has grown substantially over the last 20 years, manufacturing technologies {{to make use of}} short natural fibers in high volume fraction composites; are still limited. Natural fibers, after retting and preprocessing, are discontinuous and easily form entangled bundles. Dispersion and mixing these short fibers with resin to manufacture high quality, high volume fraction composites presents a significant challenge. In this paper, a novel pneumatic design for dispersion of natural fibers in their original discontinuous form is described. In this design, compressed air is used to create vacuum to feed and convey fibres while breaking down fibre clumps and dispersing them in an aerosolized resin stream. Model composite materials, made using proof-of-concept prototype equipment, were imaged with both optical and X-ray tomography to evaluate fibre and resin dispersion. The images indicated that the system was capable of providing an intimate mixture of resin and <b>detangled</b> fibres for two different resin viscosities. The new pneumatic process could serve as the basis of a system to produce well-dispersed high-volume fraction composites containing discontinuous natural fibres drawn directly from a loosely packed source...|$|R
40|$|A {{transition}} in source-drain current vs back gate voltage ID - VBG characteristics from extrinsic polar molecule dominant hysteresis to anti-hysteresis induced by an oxygen deficient surface layer that is intrinsic to the ferroelectric thin films {{has been observed}} on graphene field-effect transistors on Pb 0. 92 La 0. 08 Zr 0. 52 Ti 0. 48 O 3 gates GFET/PLZT-Gate during a vacuum annealing process developed to systematically remove the polar molecules adsorbed on the GFET channel surface. This allows <b>detangle</b> of the extrinsic and intrinsic hysteresis on GFET/PLZT-gate devices and detection of the dynamic switch of electric dipoles using GFETs, taking advantage of their high gating efficiency on ferroelectric gate. A model of the charge trapping and pinning mechanism is proposed to successfully explain the transition. In response to pulsed VBG trains of positive, negative, as well as alternating polarities, respectively, the source-drain current ID variation is instantaneous with the response amplitude following the ID - VBG loops measured by DC VBG with consideration of the remnant polarization after a given VBG pulse when the gate electric field exceeds the coercive field of the PLZT. A detection sensitivity of around 212 dipole/um 2 has been demonstrated at room temperature, suggesting the GFET/ferroelectric-gate devices provide a promising high-sensitivity scheme for uncooled detection of electrical dipole dynamic switch...|$|R
40|$|Joint {{modeling}} of {{the intensity of}} facial action units (AUs) from face images is challenging due to {{the large number of}} AUs (30 +) and their intensity levels (6). This is in part {{due to the lack of}} suitable models that can efficiently handle such a large number of outputs/classes simultaneously, but also due to the lack of labelled target data. For this reason, majority of the methods proposed so far resort to independent classifiers for the AU intensity. This is suboptimal for at least two reasons: the facial appearance of some AUs changes depending on the intensity of other AUs, and some AUs co-occur more often than others. Encoding this is expected to improve the estimation of target AU intensities, especially in the case of noisy image features, head-pose variations and imbalanced training data. To this end, we introduce a novel modeling framework, Copula Ordinal Regression (COR), that leverages the power of copula functions and CRFs, to <b>detangle</b> the probabilistic {{modeling of}} AU dependencies from the marginal modeling of the AU intensity. Consequently, the COR model achieves the joint learning and inference of intensities of multiple AUs, while being computationally tractable. We show on two challenging datasets of naturalistic facial expressions that the proposed approach consistently outperforms (i) independent modeling of AU intensities, and (ii) the state-ofthe-art approach for the target task...|$|R
