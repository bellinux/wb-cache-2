25|$|A {{heat sink}} (also {{commonly}} spelled <b>heatsink)</b> is a passive heat exchanger that transfers the heat generated by an electronic or a mechanical device to a fluid medium, often air or a liquid coolant, {{where it is}} dissipated away from the device, thereby allowing regulation of the device's temperature at optimal levels. In computers, heat sinks are used to cool central processing units or graphics processors. Heat sinks are used with high-power semiconductor devices such as power transistors and optoelectronics such as lasers and light emitting diodes (LEDs), where the heat dissipation ability of the component itself is insufficient to moderate its temperature.|$|E
50|$|The output {{transistors}} of solid-state amplifiers can be passively cooled {{by using}} metal fins called <b>heatsinks</b> to radiate away the heat. For high-wattage amplifiers (over 800 watts), a fan {{is often used}} to move air across internal <b>heatsinks.</b>|$|R
40|$|Due {{to their}} size and complex geometry, large <b>heatsinks</b> such as those used in the power {{electronics}} industry may enhance the radiated emissions produced by the circuits employing them. Such enhancement of the radio frequency (rf) radiation could cause the equipment to malfunction or to contravene current EMC regulations. In this paper, the electromagnetic resonant effects of <b>heatsinks</b> are examined using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method and recommendations are made concerning the optimum geometry of <b>heatsinks</b> and the placement of components so as to mitigate potential EMC effects...|$|R

25|$|Heat production: The {{ever-increasing}} {{density of}} MOSFETs on an integrated circuit creates problems of substantial localized heat generation that can impair circuit operation. Circuits operate more slowly at high temperatures, and have reduced reliability and shorter lifetimes. Heat sinks and other cooling devices and methods are now required for many integrated circuits including microprocessors. Power MOSFETs {{are at risk}} of thermal runaway. As their on-state resistance rises with temperature, if the load is approximately a constant-current load then the power loss rises correspondingly, generating further heat. When the <b>heatsink</b> is not able to keep the temperature low enough, the junction temperature may rise quickly and uncontrollably, resulting in destruction of the device.|$|E
2500|$|Most Raspberry Pi chips {{could be}} overclocked to 800MHz, and some to 1000MHz. There are reports the Raspberry Pi2 can be {{similarly}} overclocked, in extreme cases, even to 1500MHz (discarding all safety features and over-voltage limitations). In the Raspbian Linux distro the overclocking options on boot {{can be done}} by a software command running [...] "sudo raspi-config" [...] without voiding the warranty. In those cases the Pi automatically shuts the overclocking down if the chip reaches , but it is possible to override automatic over-voltage and overclocking settings (voiding the warranty); an appropriately sized <b>heatsink</b> is needed to protect the chip from serious overheating.|$|E
2500|$|The power {{connectors}} on {{the back}} of these systems incorporate a [...] "keying" [...] system that will prevent plugging a (newer) lower-rated power supply into an older system (which needs more power). The keying system does, however, allow older power supplies to be connected to newer systems, as this poses no problem. [...] The initial motherboard version was known as [...] "Xenon" [...] and used a 203watt power supply, and lacked a HDMI video port. The [...] "Zephyr" [...] revision was largely the same aside from the addition of the HDMI port, and an improved GPU <b>heatsink.</b> The [...] "Falcon" [...] incorporated a newer 65nm CPU, 80nm GPU and eDRAM, and it required less power so it came packaged with a 175watt power supply. [...] "Jasper" [...] (released late August or early September 2008) used both a 65nm CPU and GPU, as well as 16, 256 or 512MB of on-board flash memory. (This was to help run a then-recent Dashboard update. Without the addition of this internal memory, a hard disk drive or memory card is required.) The [...] "Jasper" [...] revision required even less power, and so the power supply was also reduced to 150 watts. Xbox 360 S introduced a new motherboard version called [...] "Trinity" [...] with a 45nm integrated CPU, GPU, and eDRAM (i.e. all in the same chip package). In 2011 a second model of the Xbox 360 S motherboard has been released known as [...] "Corona" [...] which integrates the HANA chip into the southbridge chip.|$|E

50|$|Many modern {{motherboard}} chipsets have hot northbridges {{which may}} come with active cooling, {{in the form}} of a small, noisy fan. Some motherboard manufacturers have replaced these fans by incorporating large <b>heatsinks</b> or heatpipe coolers, however they still require good case airflow to remove heat. Motherboard voltage regulators also often have <b>heatsinks</b> and may need airflow to ensure adequate cooling.|$|R

50|$|Since {{the release}} of AMD's Thunderbird CPU in 2002, Thermalright has been making {{high-performance}} heat sinks, not only for AMD processors, but Intel as well. Their current product line includes <b>heatsinks</b> for CPUs, GPUs, RAM, and Motherboard components. Thermalright's primary focus is fanless <b>heatsinks</b> {{which can be used}} passively, making quiet computers; however many enthusiasts choose to use the heat sinks with a fan for better heat dissipation.|$|R

The primary level systems {{have two or three}} redundant trains of safety. The secondary level systems are 3x50% or 2x100%. and have their own <b>heatsink</b> separate from the primary <b>heatsink.</b> The primary <b>heatsink</b> is the Meuse river while the secondary <b>heatsink</b> is water from underground water tables.|$|E
50|$|Ultra120 extreme (also called U120E) has six thermal conductors. From the appearance, we {{can tell}} Ultra120E is {{an updated version of}} old <b>heatsink.</b> However, not only is it a brand new one, but also, from the {{efficiency}} test report issued by Anandtech, the efficiency of U120E was proved to be a better version. Thermalright then declared that the copper-base <b>heatsink</b> is manufactured with protruding face, not flat one, which is different from the concept of thermal conduct as convention would have it. Afterwards, Thermalright manufactured the Ultra120E <b>heatsink</b> with protruding face, fascinating other <b>heatsink</b> manufacturers following with this concept.|$|E
40|$|Here let us {{describe}} the trends in <b>heatsinks</b> focusing on those for personal computers. At first, the heat generation rate itself of CPUs {{was small and}} hence the heat density was low necessitating no <b>heatsinks,</b> and conventionally the heat was dissipated into the printed circuit board, {{taking advantage of the}} CPU package made of plastics, through the socket. Then, as CPUs upgraded in integration scale and the design rule for circuit patterns improved in preciseness together with the increasing clock frequency, the heat generation rate continued to upsurge. Consequently, a need for cool-ing using <b>heatsinks</b> arose, and <b>heatsinks</b> based on extru-sions and die-castings were employed for desktop PCs. Later on, as the heat generation rate of CPUs increased higher, these blower-less air-cooling devices were found to be insufficient, so that forced air-cooling using a motor-driven fan was introduced, and this cooling method continues to be used up until now experiencing many improvements 2), 3). On the other hand, with respect to notebook PCs, the heat was at first diffused over the entire casing using its aluminum sheet metal to be naturally dissipated into the air. In the meantime, in 1993, heatpipe was combined with the casing to improve the heat-diffusing perfor-mance, and further, motor-driven fan was introduced thus achieving performance improvements year by year. As it is now some CPUs generate a heat rate of more than 100 W, and those developed for notebook PCs in excess of 30 W. Moreover, the heat generation rate of other devices such as GPU now exceeds 10 W, producing a tendency toward increased temperature within the casing. As described above, the <b>heatsinks</b> of today are used in many crucial places where extremely high performance is required. Accordingly, it is essential for <b>heatsinks</b> to maxi-mize the fin efficiency by adopting heatpipes that outper- 1...|$|R

50|$|Several {{brands of}} DDR2,DDR3,DDR4 and the {{upcoming}} DDR5 DRAM memory modules are {{fitted with a}} finned <b>heatsink</b> clipped onto {{the top edge of}} the module. The same technique is used for video cards that use a finned passive <b>heatsink</b> on the GPU.|$|E
50|$|CPU shims are {{not common}} {{at all in}} OEM {{computer}}s, but are used by some computer hardware enthusiasts who may use heavier heatsinks because they wish to have a cooler or less noisy system or perhaps to overclock the CPU for better performance. A heavy <b>heatsink</b> puts more pressure on the CPU and motherboard. Shims are very useful for people who often change CPU, <b>heatsink</b> and/or cooling solutions, or use a <b>heatsink</b> that is heavier than the CPU manufacturer's recommended weight.|$|E
