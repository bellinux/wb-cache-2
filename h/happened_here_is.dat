Morris first became interested in the case in the early 1990s and believes that MacDonald is not guilty after undertaking extensive research. Morris explained in a July 2013 interview, prior to the reopening of the case: [...] "What <b>happened</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> wrong. It's wrong to convict a man under these circumstances. And if I can help correct that, I will be a happy camper." ...|$|E

It’s plausible that we didn’t see an effect because the wolves were suffering from some other trouble that disguised the benefit. What if wolf No. 93 had never arrived? Dr. Vucetich said {{that it is impossible to}} know for sure, but the Isle Royale wolves might have disappeared completely. It may be that the Old Gray Guy arrived just in time." ...|$|E

The film is based on the testimonies of those who survived and now share their painful memories with the director. The characters are people with opposite stands on the military conflict. Some became more involved, others definitely less, but the hell of war affected them to the same extent. Nothing Has Ever <b>Happened</b> <b>Here</b> <b>is</b> a devastating documentary showing the havoc that the war wreaks on people..|$|E

[...] "She {{kept coming back to}} it time and time again, obviously trying to trap Governor Palin into saying something stupid or extreme. Everything after that has to be seen in the context of that episode, because Governor Palin never trusted Katie Couric after that.

5000|$|In 1982 Atari, which {{licensed}} {{the home}} rights to Pac-Man, unsuccessfully sought an injunction against {{the sale of}} Jawbreaker and Gobbler, another On-Line computer game, which Atari claimed unduly resembled Pac-Man.

5000|$|The first {{reason is}} that if we want to {{estimate}} and account for the value of the net new output created by a country in a year, we must be able to distinguish between sources of new value added and conserved or transferred value. In other words, we need a value-theoretic principle which guides us in relating, grouping and computing price-aggregates. It is obvious that if products or incomes are merely exchanged or transferred between A and B, then the total product value, or total income, does not increase; all that has <b>happened</b> <b>here</b> <b>is,</b> that they have been shifted around, and redistributed. Total wealth has not increased, no new value was added. By implication, some activities add new value, others do not.|$|E
5000|$|Now, {{reduction}} in contrast in a vowel system (for {{that is what}} has <b>happened</b> <b>here)</b> <b>is</b> very commonly associated with position in atonic (unaccented) syllables, but in Latin the tonic accent of say reficiō and refectus is on the same syllable as simplex faciō, factus, and that is true of almost all of the examples given (cólligō, rédimō, īlicō (initial-syllable accent) are the only exceptions), and indeed for most of the examples of these alternations throughout the language. Obviously the reduction of contrast points in the vowel system (-a- and -o- fall together with -i- before a single consonant, with -e- before two consonants; long vowels replace diphthongs) cannot {{have anything to do with}} the location of the accent in attested Latin: ...|$|E
50|$|Morton, {{a former}} circus wrestler, had a {{reputation}} for his sexual exploitation of Aboriginal women and violence against both his white employees and Aboriginal people. On 27 August, he left his camp to punish Aboriginal people for spearing his cattle. At Boomerang waterhole he found a large Warlpiri camp; what <b>happened</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> unknown but the Warlpiri decided to kill Morton. During the night they surrounded his camp and at dawn 15 men armed with boomerangs and yam sticks rushed Morton. His dogs attacked the Aboriginals and after breaking free Morton shot one and the rest fled. Morton returned to his main camp and was taken to the Ti Tree Well mission where a nurse removed 17 splinters from his head and treated him for a serious skull fracture.|$|E
5000|$|In {{an article}} for The Japan Times, titled: [...] "AKB48 member’s ‘penance’ shows flaws in idol culture", Ian Martin noted: [...] "What <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> that the {{protection}} of fans’ fragile fantasies automatically trumps the basic human right to a life outside that fantasy framework.

5000|$|Loyalty to the Resistance Bloc's Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah's assistant, Hussein Khalil, said: [...] "What <b>happened</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> a crime...this {{battle against}} terrorists will {{continue}} {{and it is}} a long war between us." [...] Nasrallah himself later said that such incidents only increase [...] "our determination to fight" [...] in the Syrian Civil War and that the goal of the attack [...] "is to put pressure on Hezbollah withdraw from Syria, but they know very well these bombings will not benefit them at all. This will have the opposite effect." [...] He further noted: [...] "Palestinians and Syrians were among the martyrs and wounded. This terrorism does not differentiate its victims. If Daesh assume that killing our men and women and children and burning our markets could weaken our determination, then they are mistaken;" [...] while adding that the arrests of two Palestinians and a Syrian over the attack were inaccurate and were intended to raise discord. He added his gratitude to the security forces and civilians who offered aid following the attack.|$|E
50|$|Later, the Doctor and Peri {{landed on}} the devastated planet Ravolox, which they {{discovered}} was actually Earth, moved across space with devastating consequences. Before they could discover {{the reason for this}} disaster, the TARDIS landed on Thoros Beta. What actually <b>happened</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> unclear, but initial accounts suggest that Peri was killed after being cruelly used as a test subject in brain transplant experiments and the Doctor was pulled out of time to a Time Lord space station where he was put on trial for the second time by his own race, the Time Lords. In reality the trial was a cover-up organised by the High Council. A race from Andromeda had stolen Time Lord secrets and hidden on Earth, so to protect themselves the Time Lords had moved Earth through space, burning the surface in a massive fireball and leaving it as Ravolox. The prosecutor at that trial, the Valeyard, {{turned out to be a}} possible future evil incarnation of the Doctor himself who was out to steal his remaining lives. He had also edited the Matrix recordings of the Doctor's travels; in reality Peri had survived events on Thoros Beta. The events of the trial tangled the Doctor's timeline slightly, as he left in the company of Mel, whom he technically had not yet met.|$|E
