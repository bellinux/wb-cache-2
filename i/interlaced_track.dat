2500|$|The {{section of}} Route 3 between Wimbledon and West Croydon mostly follows the {{single-track}} British Rail route, closed on 31 May 1997 {{so that it}} could be converted for Tramlink. Within this section, from near Phipps Bridge to near Reeves Corner, route 3 follows the Surrey Iron Railway, giving Tramlink a claim to one of the world's oldest railway alignments – [...] beside Mitcham tram stop had its name long before Tramlink. A partial obstruction near this point (reinforcement to a retaining wall below a car park) has necessitated the use of <b>interlaced</b> <b>track.</b>|$|E
50|$|In Potsdam, a short {{section of}} <b>interlaced</b> <b>track</b> takes trams through the {{historic}} Nauener Tor {{into the old}} city.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Metrocentro T1" [...] {{tram line}} of the Seville Metro that opened in 2007 {{features}} a 300 m section of <b>interlaced</b> <b>track</b> along the city's main pedestrian street. The section runs down , past the Seville Cathedral and World Heritage Site.|$|E
50|$|When {{the tracks}} were relaid in the 1990s, the <b>interlaced</b> <b>tracks</b> were {{replaced}} with a single track over the viaduct and points at each side.|$|R
50|$|An {{arrangement}} {{similar to}} gauntlet track is sometimes used to allow trains of different gauges {{to use the}} same track. In that case, the two <b>interlaced</b> <b>tracks</b> will have different gauges, sometimes sharing one of the rails for a total of three rails.|$|R
50|$|The Longchamp Racecourse (Hippodrome de Longchamp) is a 57 hectare horse-racing {{facility}} {{located on}} the Route des Tribunes in the Bois de Boulogne in Paris, France. Built {{on the banks of}} the Seine River, it is used for flat racing and is noted for its variety of <b>interlaced</b> <b>tracks</b> and a famous hill that provides a real challenge to competing thoroughbreds. It has several racetracks varying from 1,000 to 4,000 metres in length with 46 different starting posts. The course is home to more than half of the group one races held in France, and has a capacity of 50,000. The highlight of the calendar is the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. Held on the first weekend in October, the prestigious event attracts the best horses from around the world.|$|R
5000|$|Linz's tram {{network is}} built to [...] and is {{electrified}} using overhead line. The network is largely double track, with single-track on the Pöstlingbergbahn, and {{a stretch of}} <b>interlaced</b> <b>track</b> at a bottleneck in the road through Ebelsberg. Most of the track is at grade, {{with the exception of}} a tunnelled section, serving three stops, at Hauptbahnhof. A large part of the network is segregated, often on grassed right of way.|$|E
50|$|In narrow {{situations}} double-track tram lines sometimes {{reduce to}} single track, or, to avoid switches, have the tracks interlaced, e.g. in the Leidsestraat in Amsterdam on three short stretches (see map detail); {{this is known}} as interlaced or gauntlet track. There is a UK example of <b>interlaced</b> <b>track</b> on the Tramlink, just west of Mitcham Station, where the formation is narrowed by an old landslip causing an obstruction. (See photo in Tramlink entry).|$|E
50|$|Gauntlet track or <b>interlaced</b> <b>track</b> (also gantlet track) is an {{arrangement}} in which railway tracks run parallel {{on a single}} track bed and are interlaced (i.e., overlapped) such that only one pair of rails may be used at a time. Since this requires only slightly more width than a single track, all rails can be carried on the same crossties/sleepers. Trains run on the discrete pair of rails appropriate to their direction, track gauge or loading gauge.|$|E
50|$|Caribbean Corkscrew is a single-rider {{water slide}} at Adventure Island in Tampa, Florida, {{operated}} by SeaWorld Parks and Entertainment. The purple tube slide {{consists of two}} mirrored, twin-helix <b>tracks</b> <b>interlacing</b> each other. The slides are both entirely enclosed, until reaching a splash pool {{at the base of}} the ride. The ride opened in 1989.|$|R
50|$|An unusual {{piece of}} track {{work has been}} {{installed}} at Wirksworth (and {{can be seen at}} Platform 3). The <b>track</b> is <b>interlaced</b> (overlapping) to allow either the platform to be used for passenger trains or to allow wagons to collect stone from the adjacent dock. The <b>interlaced</b> section of <b>track</b> is operated by a manual tight point but still comes {{under the control of the}} Wirksworth to Ravenstor train token.|$|R
5000|$|The {{layout of}} the line {{was found to be}} dangerous. Above and below the passing loop, the cars worked on a single track. They were guided into the passing loop by sprung-operated points, such that the car would always take {{the same side of the}} passing loop. This was {{seemingly}} in contravention of the 1896 Order for the line's construction, which specified that the cars operate on separate <b>tracks,</b> <b>interlaced</b> above and below the passing loop. The Board of Trade felt that ...|$|R

5000|$|Under {{the terms}} of the {{building}} contract the company was allowed to claim from the building contractors the cost of any improvements or rectifications if the line was found to be unsatisfactory; this they did. It is unclear what changes may have taken place, particularly to the track layout, as while the Board of Trade raised serious issues of the single-track layout there is no record of it having been altered to <b>interlaced</b> <b>track.</b> However, some kind of new brake referred to as a [...] "Scotch brake" [...] was fitted to the cars.|$|E
50|$|The {{lower section}} is built in or {{alongside}} the public road and has gradients as steep as 1 in 3.8 (26.15%). The track throughout this section is laid as grooved rail within the road surface, and the cable lies below the road surface in a conduit between the rails. The {{bottom half of}} the section is single-track, but above the passing loop it has <b>interlaced</b> double <b>track.</b> By contrast, the upper section is less steep, with a maximum gradient of 1 in 10 (10%). The track is laid on sleepers and ballast, and the cable runs between the rails as is normal for most funiculars. The track is single apart from a short double track passing loop equipped with points actuated by the flanges of the passing cars. The rails are interrupted to accommodate the cable.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{shortly before}} the opening of line 9 HKL stated the {{continuation}} to Merikatu had been abandoned permanently, within weeks of {{the opening of the}} line, extending the route to Merikatu was again proposed, due to complaints from inhabitants of Ullanlinna following the termination of bus line 17. Subsequently, HKL stated they would be [...] "actively acting to expand the tramline to Merikatu". <b>Interlacing</b> the <b>tracks</b> on some sections on Korkeavuorenkatu is under consideration as a space-saving measure, allowing a larger amount of parking space to be maintained along the street. At the time in 2008, HKL stated that a different line would be routed to Merikatu in the case that line 9 would go to Jätkäsaari instead. The southern terminus of line 9 was ultimately extended to the West Harbour ferry terminal in Jätkäsaari and opened for traffic on 13 August 2012.|$|R
50|$|During {{the early}} 1970s, port traffic {{averaged}} about 3 million tons a year, {{compared with an}} overall capacity of about 3.8 million tons. Exports were somewhat more than 1 million tons and imports about 2 million tons; {{about half of the}} latter was petroleum and petroleum products. By the mid-1970s, stepped up economic development had raised traffic to capacity levels. However, in 1985, {{largely as a result of}} the civil war, exports were down to 663 thousand tons (down 51% from the previous year) and imports were 2.3 million tons (down 25% from the previous year). Physical expansion of the harbor and adjacent areas was generally precluded by natural features and the proximity of the city of Port Sudan. However, surveys showed that use could be increased considerably by modernization and improvement of existing facilities and the addition of further cargo-handling equipment. In 1978, with the assistance of a loan from the IDA, work began on adding deep-water berths and providing roll-on-roll-off container facilities. A loan to purchase equipment was made by a West German body. The first phase was completed in 1982, and the second phase began in 1983, aided by a US$25-million World Bank credit. One of the major improvements has been to make the port more readily usable by road vehicles. Developed almost entirely as a rail-serviced facility, the port had large areas of <b>interlacing</b> railroad <b>tracks</b> that were mostly not flush with surrounding surfaces, thereby greatly restricting vehicular movement. Many of these tracks have been removed and new access roads constructed. Much of the cleared area has become available for additional storage facilities.|$|R
40|$|Drop {{motion in}} a {{turbulent}} flow is studied using {{a model of}} homogeneous and isotropic turbulence. The model permits us to generate different realizations of the random velocity field component with given latitudinal and lateral correlation functions and a spatial structure which obeys the Kolmogorov theory. For the generation of the turbulent flow, the structure function of the flow in the form suggested by Batchelor was chosen. This function describes the spectrum of turbulence both in the viscous and inertial subranges. Numerous examples of drop tracks for drops of different size demonstrate a significant influence of turbulence on different aspects of drop (as well as ice and aerosol particle) motion. The tendency of drop tracks to collect along isolated paths is demonstrated. The existence of areas of two types within a turbulent flow is revealed. Drops (aerosol particles) tend to leave the areas of enhanced turbulent flow vorticity and curvature apparently due to their inertia. At the same time, drops tend to "avoid " these areas. <b>Interlacing</b> of the <b>tracks</b> of small drops attributed to different deviations from the velocity of the flow due to the difference in drop inertia is demonstrated...|$|R
5000|$|A {{more recent}} example is Monty Python's Matching Tie and Handkerchief. Also Tool's 1992 EP release, Opiate {{featured}} on the second side a double groove that would either play the first track of side two or the hidden song that was found {{at the end of}} the CD version. The Marillion Brave vinyl has a double groove on side four, ending the album either happily with the track Made Again or less so with water noise. In 2005 a 7-inch single titled [...] "The Road Leads Where It's Led" [...] by The Secret Machines was released in UK that contained both tracks on one side on parallel grooves. The Summer 1980 Mad magazine Super Special included a one-sided sound sheet (see [...] "flexidisc" [...] above), playable on a standard turntable. It had eight <b>interlaced</b> grooves, each <b>track</b> starts with the same happy and upbeat [...] "Super Spectacular Day" [...] beginning of the song but have eight different dark and gloomy endings. In the 1980s, Rhino Records re-released the Henny Youngman comedy album 128 Greatest Jokes as a series of concentric grooves, which they call a [...] "Trick-Track Master". Each side of the album has four grooves. In the 1980s, the band Pink Slip Daddy released a 10-inch single called [...] "LSD" [...] on clear pink vinyl with pink glitter inside the vinyl. One side of the single had one song that played from inside out and, on the other side, there were two songs that were pressed as concentric grooves. Many of The Shins' 7-inch records have parallel grooves (such as their 2007 single [...] "Phantom Limb," [...] which has [...] "Nothing at All" [...] and [...] "Split Needles (Alt. Version)" [...] on the b-side.) The band None of Your Fucking Business released a one-sided 7-inch called [...] "NOYFB Escapes from Hell" [...] (side 2 has a groove, but there is no audio encoded in the groove), with 2 grooves that started from the center and ended on the outside of the disc. One groove ran at 45 RPM, while the other ran at 33 RPM. UK punk rocker Johnny Moped's debut album Cycledelic has a lead track with a parallel groove listed on the label as [...] "0. Mystery Track," [...] which runs parallel to the track. The 12-inch single for rap group De La Soul's 1989 song [...] "Me Myself and I" [...] has two different tracks in a parallel groove on the B-side. One groove has the Oblapos remixes of [...] "Me Myself and I," [...] while the other has [...] "Brain Washed Follower." ...|$|R
