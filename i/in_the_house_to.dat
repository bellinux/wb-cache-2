5|$|A motion <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>to</b> extend Canada's {{mission in}} Afghanistan by two years was successful. The motion was {{supported}} by the Conservatives and 30 Liberal MPs, allowing it to narrowly pass 149–145 on May 17, 2006. Even outside of government bills, the Prime Minister's support of Canada's action has been a recurring topic, gaining him both supporters and critics among the Canadian population. On March 13, 2008, the mission was further extended until July 2011 by a vote of 197–77, with Conservative and Liberal MPs in favour, and Bloc and NDP MPs opposed.|$|E
5|$|After {{the final}} result, Miller refused to endorse McEwen, though McEwen tried to soothe {{feelings}} by introducing H.R. 5727 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>to</b> name the dam and locks on the Ohio River near Gallipolis after Miller. Miller carried an unsuccessful legal {{challenge to the}} redistricting to the United States Supreme Court, insisting district lines should be drawn on a politically neutral basis.|$|E

During this time, she shadowed Tony Abbott, with the rivalry between the two often attracting attention from the media. She was later given additional responsibility for managing opposition business in the House of Representatives by Latham, who had succeeded Beazley as Labor Party leader.|$|E

5|$|While {{still living}} in Mayagüez, Betances built a house {{for himself and his}} wife, which they only lived in for less than two years; the house, named the Casa de los Cinco Arcos (House of the Five Arches), still stands on the street that bears his name near the corner with Luis Muñoz Rivera street, south of the city's center. Apparently a single, elderly man lives <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>to</b> this day.|$|E
5|$|The Senate {{began work}} on its own {{proposals}} while the House was still working. The United States Constitution requires all revenue-related bills to originate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House.</b> <b>To</b> formally comply with this requirement, the Senate used H.R. 3590, a bill regarding housing tax changes for service members. It had been passed by the House as a revenue-related modification to the Internal Revenue Code. The bill became the Senate's vehicle for its healthcare reform proposal, discarding the bill's original content. The bill ultimately incorporated elements of proposals that were reported favorably by the Senate Health and Finance committees. With the Republican Senate minority vowing to filibuster, 60 votes {{would be necessary to}} pass the Senate. At the start of the 111th Congress, Democrats had only 58 votes; the Senate seat in Minnesota ultimately won by Al Franken was still undergoing a recount, while Arlen Specter was still a Republican (he became a Democrat in April, 2009).|$|E
5|$|When Randall {{returned}} to Washington in 1881 {{to begin his}} term in the 47th Congress, the legislature was controlled by Republicans. After Garfield's assassination later that year, Vice President Chester A. Arthur assumed the presidency. Arthur, like most Republicans, favored high tariffs, but he sought to simplify the tariff structure and to reduce excise taxes. Randall, who had {{returned to}} his seat on the Appropriations Committee, favored the president's plan, and was among the few Democrats <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>to</b> support the it. The bill {{that emerged from the}} Ways and Means Committee, dominated by protectionists, provided for only a 10 percent reduction. After conference with the Senate, the resulting bill had an even smaller effect, reducing tariffs by an average of 1.47 percent. It passed both houses narrowly on March3, 1883, the last full day of the 47th Congress; Arthur signed the measure into law. Toward the end, Randall took less part in the debate, feeling the tension between his supporters in the House, who wanted more reductions, and his constituents at home, who wanted less.|$|E

25|$|The primary chamber was {{a private}} room and was less ornate than the public rooms. Toward the end of Mason's life, it was painted in emerald green, which was {{considered}} a desirable color.

25|$|Although the Greens {{no longer}} had any input into the budget, they {{maintained}} a close working relationship with the government, and the Greens remained involved in the legislation process.

However, both trainers still remained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>to</b> train their former rival contestants.|$|E
25|$|Ros-Lehtinen {{played a}} key role in keeping the International Protecting Girls by Preventing Child Marriage Act of 2010 from being passed into law. Although the bill had {{unanimously}} passed the Senate with bipartisan support, she persuaded enough Republicans <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>to</b> vote against the bill so that it did not receive the required two-thirds majority. She reportedly invoked concerns about the legislation's cost and that funds could be used to promote abortion.|$|E

25|$|Tatami are {{the basis}} of {{traditional}} Japanese architecture, regulating a building's size and dimensions. They originated in ancient Japan when straw was laid on bare earth as a softener and warmer. In the Heian Period (794–1185), this idea developed into moveable mats that could be laid anywhere <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>to</b> sit or sleep on before becoming a permanent floor covering in the fifteenth century. Tatami are suitable for the Japanese climate because they let air circulate around the floor.|$|E
25|$|In 1971, O'Neill was {{appointed}} Majority Whip in the House, the number three {{position for the}} Democratic Party in the House.
