40|$|Globalization {{presents}} an important opportunity for police and justice officials {{around the world}} to cooperate with one another to bring offenders of serious transnational organized crime to justice. Numerous trends and developments are emerging in Europe—especially in the cross-border Meuse–Rhine Euregion, where the three countries of Belgium, The Netherlands, and Germany meet. Indeed, the police and justice officials of the Meuse–Rhine Euregion are acknowledged as the “pioneers” of routine cross-border police and <b>judicial</b> <b>cooperation,</b> and due to various factors, their work is arguably among the most long-standing, advanced, and intense in the world. Despite an expanding legal framework, however, operational problems still arise in practice. Therefore, one question becomes: how may <b>international</b> police and <b>judicial</b> <b>cooperation</b> in the Meuse–Rhine Euregion be improved? The Meuse–Rhine Euregion frames this multi-site case study, which uses the Organizational Behavior (OB) approach to examine the state-of-the-art. Specifically, the analysis of scholarly literature, international law, and in-depth personal interviews with 44 English-speaking police detectives, senior police commanders, prosecutors, and examining magistrates from 21 organizations across the three countries in this Euregion provides the data to answer this study’s four main research questions, namely: (1) What is the status quo with respect to <b>international</b> police and <b>judicial</b> <b>cooperation</b> aimed at combating serious transnational organized crime in the Meuse–Rhine Euregion, according to police and justice officials?; (2) How does the process of <b>international</b> police and <b>judicial</b> <b>cooperation</b> aimed at combating serious transnational organized crime in the Meuse–Rhine Euregion operate in practice, according to police and justice officials?; (3) What variables affect (facilitate/impede) <b>international</b> police and <b>judicial</b> <b>cooperation</b> aimed at combating serious transnational organized crime in the Meuse–Rhine Euregion, according to police and justice officials?; and (4) How can <b>international</b> police and <b>judicial</b> <b>cooperation</b> aimed at combating serious transnational organized crime in the Meuse–Rhine Euregion be improved? The findings of this study may help improve <b>international</b> police and <b>judicial</b> <b>cooperation</b> in the Meuse–Rhine Euregion, and inspire similar cooperative efforts around the world...|$|R

Approximation is interpreted in a very broad manner, encompassing both EU and non-EU instruments.

Both mutual recognition and Eurojust are considered to have a symbolic value in the field of <b>judicial</b> <b>cooperation</b> and have a clear link with approximation: the double criminality requirement and the delineation of competence scope. Analysis reveals that approximation is not used to its full potential when it comes to facilitating <b>judicial</b> <b>cooperation</b> even though this is the main function of approximation.

The innovations and the value of the work consist of the examination of the European legal instrument, the comparative examination and the critical opinions and the proposals of de lege ferenda.

At the same time the European legislative act establishes a general procedure that needs to be respected by each Member State, which entails the obligation for Member States to ensure at least the same rights as for the citizen or the conditions under which a national of another Member State is suspected, accused or arrested for the commission of a crime.

40|$|Abstract: Due to {{cross-border}} crimes rise, the EU {{is working}} on the development of <b>international</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>cooperation</b> between Member States. Increase of illegal immigration, trafficking of drugs, weapons and human beings, and the advent of terrorism, made necessary a stronger judicial collaboration between States. Particular attention is paid on judicial collaboration between Western Balkans and the EU. CARDS program is a suitable evidence of it. Judicial cooperation includes mutual recognition of judicial decisions, cooperation in investigations, approximation of penal legislation of involved states, including the penalties. During the investigations, prior to an international request for warrant of arrest, an exchange of information on criminal offences and administrative infringements takes place between magistrates belonging to different countries.; this create new need for judicial cooperation environment supporting a cross-border judicial cooperation between EU and Countries of enlarging Europe. 1. Reference frame and objectives. An efficient cross-border judicial cooperation is a key success factor for fighting against the globalisation trend of criminal and terrorist organisations. Their borderless and networked structures and capabilities to use IT and communication technologies constitute serious challenges for judicia...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we have {{examined}} the institution of recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments, if the sentenced person is in Romania, according to the Romanian special law provisions in force.

Among these drawbacks of the Romanian law we mention the absence of compulsory insurance of defense in the trial stage of the application for recognition to the trial court and the absence of the person from hearing an appeal, the obligatory presence being only for the prosecutor. The paper continues the research of the <b>international</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>cooperation</b> forms in criminal matters conducted by the publication of other similar studies, and the innovations consist precisely in the examination of institution and identification of provisions of the law that can cause dysfunctions in the procedure of recognition and enforcement of such judgments.
