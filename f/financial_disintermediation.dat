50|$|A {{financial}} intermediary is typically {{an institution that}} facilitates the channeling of funds between lenders and borrowers indirectly. That is, savers (lenders) give funds to an intermediary institution (such as a bank), and that institution gives those funds to spenders (borrowers). This {{may be in the}} form of loans or mortgages. Alternatively, they may lend the money directly via the financial markets, and eliminate the {{financial intermediary}}, which is known as <b>financial</b> <b>disintermediation.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{rationale}} for P2P asset management is <b>financial</b> <b>disintermediation.</b> When multiple intermediaries {{participate in an}} investment management transaction, there {{is the potential for}} a conflict of interest between providers and buyers of the service, in a well documented sequence described in economic theory as the principal-agent problem. Intermediaries seek profit maximization. In the context of investment management, they offer the most attractive risk/return propositions to larger, more sophisticated customers. This maximizes their commission revenue for a given distribution effort. Further, given the option between two comparable investment opportunities, an intermediary enticed by investment management kickbacks will recommend the option most lucrative to him, perhaps {{at the expense of the}} best interests of non-sophisticated investors.|$|E
50|$|With two World Wars, the Stock-Market Crash of 1929 and the Great Depression, {{the first}} half of the 20th century was a {{difficult}} period for private bankers. However, the end of the Second World War allowed private bankers to grow more vigorously than ever before and to position themselves as ‘the recognised specialists in wealth management’. Several factors contributed to their success: the fact that Switzerland had remained outside the conflicts that ravaged the rest of Europe, ‘the country's exceptional political stability’, the acceleration of banking and <b>financial</b> <b>disintermediation</b> in the 1980s and 1990s, the globalisation and deregulation of financial markets, and the liberalisation of capital flows.

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to provide a}} step towards understanding the role of financial intermediaries ("banks") in aggregate economic activity. We first develop {{a model of the}} intermediary sector which is highly simplified, but rich enough to motivate several special features of bauks. Of particular importance in our model is the assumption that banks are more efficient than the public in evaluating and auditing certain information [...] intensive loan projects. Banks are also assumed to have private information about their investments, which motivates the heavy reliance of banks on debt rather than equity finance and their need for buffer stock capital. We embed this intermediary sector in a general equilibrium framework, which includes consumers and a non-banking investment sector. Mainly because banks have superior access to some investments, factors affecting the size or efficiency of banking will also {{have an impact on the}} aggregate economy. Among the factors affecting intermediation, we show, are the adequacy of bank capital, the riskiness of bank investments, and the costs of bank monitoring. We also show that our model is potentially useful for understanding the macroeconomic effects of phenomena such as <b>financial</b> crises, <b>disintermediation,</b> banking regulation, and certain types of monetary policy. ...|$|R

40|$|Many {{economies of}} the former Soviet Union have {{experienced}} cash shortages: people with demand and savings deposits in the banking system are unable to convert them into currency. Usually this is attributed to the common use of the ruble. The author argues otherwise. According to him: (a) cash shortages are manifestations of financial disintermediation: the banking sector is unable to attract enough voluntary deposits; (b) cash shortages allow the government to hold inflationary pressures in check; (c) solutions to the cash shortage problems that rely on printing newcurrency will lead to accelerating inflation. More appropriate solutions (increasing the nominal interest rates, for example) involve reversing the economic incentives to <b>financial</b> <b>disintermediation.</b> Excess demands for cash reflect conditions in financial markets. The phenomenon of cash shortage {{is related to the}} concept of shallow formal financial markets. This shallowness is recent in the former Soviet Union. The burst of inflation in early 1992 removed the"ruble overhang"and greatly reduced all indicators of financial depth.

40|$|Over {{the past}} 50 years, {{one of the}} key {{elements}} of the evolution of the world economy has been the increasing complexity of financial transactions.

International banks are generally more efficient and more active in lending than domestic banks.

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the {{evolution}} of the Japanese financial structure, in order to challenge the expected incidences of the financial liberalization. We compute financial intermediation ratios for Japan (1979 - 2004) on a book value basis. According to our results, the intermediation ratio has remained quite stable, at around 85 %. This stability is the result of two opposite trends: a decrease in credits and an increase in financial securities owned by financial (mostly, non-banking) institutions. These two trends are partly the consequence of the heavier weight of the Government in domestic external financing, which is traditionally less financed by credits than companies are. Besides, these two trends would not have appeared if we had used intermediation ratios in market value or other traditional indicators (Deposits/GDP, Loans to private sector/GDP, stock market capitalization/GDP, etc.). Our results provide evidence for a very close relationship between intermediate financings and market financings and tend to reject the hypothesis of the Japanese financial system's convergence toward a capital market-based system. <b>Disintermediation,</b> <b>financial</b> system, intermediaries, capital markets...|$|R

Based on the study of eight countries (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Peru, Mexico, and Venezuela), the magnitude of the slowdown is documented, comparing it to historical behavior and to slowdown episodes in other regions of the world. Second, changes in bank balance sheets are examined to determine whether the credit slowdown is merely a reflection of a slowdown in bank deposits, or whether the asset side has changed. Third, following an econometric disequilibrium approach used in recent studies of credit slowdowns in East Asia and Finland, the paper investigates possible causes for the slowdown in three countries: Colombia, Mexico, and Peru.

40|$|This {{paper is}} a draft for the chapter "German banks and banking structure" of the {{forthcoming}} book "The German financial system" edited by J. P. Krahnen and R. H.

Given the presented empirical evidence it then ar-gues that great care has to be taken when generalising structural trends from one financial system to another. Whilst conventional commercial banking is clearly in decline in the US, it is far from clear whether the dominance of banks in the German financial system has been significantly eroded over the last decades. We interpret the immense stability in intermedia-tion ratios and financing patterns of firms between 1970 and 2000 as strong evidence for our view that the way in which {{and the extent to which}} German banks fulfil the central functions for the financial system are still consistent with the overall logic of the German financial sys-tem. In spite of the current dire business environment for financial intermediaries we do not expect the German financial system and its banking industry as an integral part of this system to converge to the institutional arrangements typical for a market-oriented financial system.

However, the cost is high—in 2013, the total revenue of China’s commercial banks was 2.28 trillion yuan (Deloitte 2014), which is mainly from the difference of interests between saving and financing.

40|$|This paper {{stresses}} {{three factors}} that amplified the 1990 s financial crisis in Ecuador, namely institutional weaknesses, rigidities in public finances, and high financial dollarization.

Public finance rigidities limited the government''s capacity to correct existing imbalances and the deteriorating fiscal stance associated with the costs of the financial crisis. Financial dollarization increasingly reduced the effectiveness of financial safety nets, fostered foreign currency demand, and accelerated a currency crisis, thereby further worsening the solvency of banks.
