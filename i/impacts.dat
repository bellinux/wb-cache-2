40|$|Due to {{the large}} volume {{consumption}} of polyolefins, {{the treatment of the}} resulting solid waste is becoming a major concern. One possible utilization of the polyolefin wastes is to form blends from recycled polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE). This study is a preliminary investigation on the <b>impact</b> fracture behaviour for the PP/PE blends. The <b>impact</b> testing method employed in this study includes the conventional and instrumented Izod <b>impact</b> tests, the instrumented Charpy <b>impact</b> test, and the instrumented drop weight plate <b>impact</b> test (IDWPIT). In both conventional and instrumented Izod <b>impact</b> testing, PP homopolymer and PP/LDPE blend have similar <b>impact</b> strengths, while PP/HDPE blend exhibits slightly lower <b>impact</b> strength. However, the instrumented Charpy <b>impact</b> test indicates that both PP/LDPE and PP/HDPE have similar <b>impact</b> strengths, and both are slightly lower than PP homopolymer. This suggests that the type of <b>impact</b> test employed is playing {{an important role in the}} <b>impact</b> fracture behaviour of the PP/PE blends. The effect of temperature on the <b>impact</b> fracture behaviour for the PP/PE blends was evaluated by means of the Charpy and drop weight plate <b>impact</b> tests. During the tests, <b>impact</b> strengths reduced with decreasing testing temperature. In the Charpy <b>impact</b> test, the <b>impact</b> strength for PP homopolymer was higher than those of the two PP/PE blends at both 20 and 0 °C.
