This alleged shooting happened after a triple lynching of Hardin's cousin and two ranch hands. He also claimed to have driven off another group of men after killing one of them. There are no contemporary reports to confirm these stories. However, on June 1, 1874, a Texas Ranger's company did kill Hardin's cousins, Alexander Barekman and Alexander Anderson, in a gunfight and claimed to have wounded Hardin as well. Hardin wrote about his cousins' killings but does not confirm that he was wounded at all, and claimed to <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> their deaths later.|$|E

25|$|Many farmers {{around the}} world are unaware of fair trade {{practices}} that they could be implementing to earn a higher wage.

When surveyed, farmers from Cooperativa Agraria Cafetalera Pangoa (CAC Pangoa) in San Martín de Pangoa, Peru, could answer positively that they <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> fair trade, but were not able to give a detailed description about what fair trade is. They could, however, identify fair trade based on some of its possible benefits to their community. When asked, overall, farmers cited that fair trade has had a positive effect on their lives and communities. They also wanted consumers to know that fair trade is important for supporting their families and their cooperatives.|$|E

25|$|In his What About Those Who Have Never Heard? Sanders tells a {{story about}} a college student who {{rejected}} Christianity because, he claimed, it “damns to hell all those who never hear about Jesus.” Sanders replied that though some Christians held that position there are several other views which have been affirmed by Christians throughout history. In his book, No Other Name, he discusses a range of views affirmed by Christians. Sanders coined the term “restrictivism” for the view that Christian salvation is possible only for those who <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> the gospel of Jesus and put their faith in Jesus prior to their death. Those who die without knowing about Jesus cannot inherit eternal life. The second view he discusses is universalism (or apokatastasis) according to which every human who has ever lived will be redeemed. Between these polar views are what Sanders calls the “wider hope” and he spends the most time on two views in this category. One is what he calls eschatological evangelization or postmortem salvation. In this view if a person dies without having heard of Jesus then he or she will encounter Jesus after death and be provided an opportunity to put their faith in Jesus. The final position Sanders covers is the one he affirms: inclusivism. The unevangelized are saved by the work of Jesus if they respond in faith to God based on the revelation they have available.|$|E
500|$|The {{conductor}} John Eliot Gardiner describes Grainger as [...] "a true original {{in terms}} of orchestration and imaginative instrumentation", whose terseness of expression is reminiscent in style both of the 20th-century Second Viennese School and the [...] Italian madrigalists of the 16th and 17th centuries. [...] Malcolm Gillies, a Grainger scholar, writes of [...] Grainger's [...] style [...] that [...] "you know it is 'Grainger' when you <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> one second of a piece". The music's most individual characteristic, Gillies argues, is its texture – [...] "the weft of the fabric", according to Grainger. Different textures are defined by Grainger as [...] "smooth", [...] "grained" [...] and [...] "prickly".|$|E
500|$|Sukumar {{then began}} working on the script of Jagadam (2007), a crime film {{starring}} Ram Pothineni and Isha Sahni. Unlike Arya, Jagadam focused more on violence and {{in an interview with}} South Scope, Sukumar called the film an [...] "act of bravado", adding that he [...] "made it with an innocent passion", without thinking about the audience's response. Jagadam received mixed reviews and was a commercial failure. While Sify called the film a [...] "not so much a plot-driven film" [...] albeit praising the work of its technical crew, Rediff called it a [...] "good effort". He then wrote and directed Arya 2 (2009), which was promoted as the namesake sequel of his debut Arya. It featured Allu Arjun, Kajal Aggarwal, and Navdeep in the lead roles and narrated the story of Arya, a psychotic orphan whose love for his friend Ajay and his colleague Geetha is never reciprocated. Sify called it Sukumar's [...] "another celluloid misadventure" [...] after Jagadam and stated that he [...] "fails both as a writer and director as his plotline is confusing and his hero's characterization is negative". However, Arya 2 became one of the few successful Telugu films of the year, and was praised for its style quotient and music. Sukumar received a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Director– Telugu at the 57th Filmfare Awards South ceremony, but lost it to S. S. Rajamouli for Magadheera. Rajamouli stated that he regards Sukumar as the best of the lot after watching Arya 2, which was Sukumar's [...] "most precious and sweetest thing I <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> myself".|$|E

500|$|Shakur {{was shot}} {{multiple}} {{times in a}} drive-by shooting in Las Vegas, Nevada, on September 7, 1996, and died six days later on September 13, 1996 of complications from the gunshot wounds. Rumors of Wallace's involvement with Shakur's murder were reported almost immediately. A two-part series Chuck Philips wrote for the Los Angeles Times in 2002, [...] "Who Killed Tupac Shakur?", based on police reports and multiple sources reported that [...] "the shooting {{was carried out by}} a Compton gang called the Southside Crips to avenge the beating of one of its members by Shakur a few hours earlier" [...] and that Wallace paid for the gun. His family publicly denied the report, producing documents purporting to show that the rapper was in New York and New Jersey at the time. The New York Times called the documents inconclusive, stating: The pages purport to be three computer printouts from Daddy's House, indicating that Wallace was in the studio recording a song called Nasty Boy on the night Shakur was shot. They indicate that Wallace wrote half the session, was In and out/sat around and laid down a ref, shorthand for a reference vocal, the equivalent of a first take.

He could not recall the date of the session but said it was likely not the night Shakur was shot. We would <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> it, Mr. Alfred said." [...] Moreover, Philips' article was based on multiple sources. As the Assistant Managing Editor of the LA Times Mark Duvoisin wrote: [...] "Philips' story has withstood all challenges to its accuracy, ... remains the definitive account of the Shakur slaying." [...] Faith Evans remembered her husband calling her the night of Shakur's death and crying due to him being in shock. Evans added, [...] "I think it’s fair to say he was probably afraid, given everything that was going on at that time and all the hype that was put on this so-called beef that he didn’t really have in his heart against anyone." [...] Wayne Barrow, Wallace's co-manager at the time, said Wallace was recording the song [...] "Nasty Girl" [...] the night Shakur was shot. Shortly after Shakur's death, he met with Snoop Dogg, who claimed that Wallace played the song [...] "Somebody Gotta Die" [...] for him, in which Snoop Dogg was mentioned, and declared he never hated Shakur.|$|E
