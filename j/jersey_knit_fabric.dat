Derivatives of single jersey knit fabrics are found by using tuck and miss loops in corporate with knit loops in wales direction. Higher presence of tuck and miss loops in wales direction affect the bursting strength.

It {{has been found that}} the polylactide acid/poly (hydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate) (PLA/PHBV) filament yarn has adequate thermal and mechanical properties for normal textile and coloration/finishing processes. The Young's modulus of polylactide acid/poly (hydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate) (PLA/PHBV) multi-filament yarn is the lowest among all the candidates investigated except for polyamide 6 (PA 6).

To achieve different functional effects of the cotton <b>knitted</b> <b>fabric,</b> chemical treatments are commonly used, but due to increased environmental restrictions, physical treatment, e. g., with a laser, has recently been introduced to the market as an environmentally friendly way to treat the surface of cotton fabric. Thus, {{the aim of the}} present study is to evaluate the impact of laser treatment on the physical and mechanical properties of 100 % cotton single <b>jersey</b> <b>knitted</b> <b>fabrics</b> with different yarn counts. The fabrics had been treated using a carbon dioxide laser (CO 2) with different levels of intensity in terms of the resolution and treatment time, i. e., the resolution (28, 32, 36, 40 dpi) and pixel time (100, 110, 120, 130 mu s). The laser power density resulting from the different combinations of laser variables was measured. Various evaluation tests including scanning electron microscopy, fabric weight, fabric thickness and fabric bursting strength were used to study the effect of laser treatment on the <b>knitted</b> <b>fabrics.</b> Grooves and micro-cracks appeared on the fibers after laser treatment.

40|$|The {{demand of}} viscose <b>knitted</b> <b>fabrics</b> is {{increasing}} rapidly {{due to its}} lower price and exclusive quality characteristics.

Moreover, automatic control of knitting & dyeing process are developing slowly due to the complexity of that manufacturing process. Process optimization and quality characteristics modeling {{is one of the most}} viable and efficient alternative technique to meet the customers requirement. Conventional trial-and-error approaches, full factorial experimental design as well as artificial neural network (ANN) and genetic algorithm for optimization did not succeed due to the large volume of works, longer experimental time and huge raw material availability. In this context, Taguchi method is an efficient tool for process optimization in quality engineering. Moreover, various factors affecting the quality characteristics of <b>knitted</b> <b>fabrics</b> are non-linear and interactive with each other‘s. In this background, Fuzzy logic (FL) is a scientific and engineering solution for quality modeling because FL model performs remarkably well in non-linear domain with smallest amount of experimental data.

The method is based on integrating the number of pixels for distances incremented by a pixel size from the yarn core edge. The experiments with various yarns showed that the hair density distribution profile (HDDP) exhibits two different exponential behaviors one below and the other above approximately 0. 75 mm from the core. A total hairiness index (THw) is also calculated using the total number of hair pixels. A good correlation is observed between the proposed THw and Uster’s H index especially for grey cotton and cotton/polyester samples.

However, these lower temperature dyeing processes often have a long dyeing time and/or require the addition of chemicals to achieve adequate dye exhaustion and migration. The use of ultrasonic irradiation was used to reduce dyeing times and temperatures whilst increasing dye migration and fastness. It has used 30  kHz frequency level, effective power of 120 and 350  W heating power in ultrasonic machine. In this work, wool dyeing was carried out on single <b>jersey</b> <b>knitted</b> <b>fabric</b> using an acid dye with and without ultrasonic irradiation at 60, 70, and 80  °C. Dye exhaustion was measured using UV/visible absorbance of the dye bath {{before and during the}} dyeing cycle. For the measurement of nodal/anti-nodal point of energy, at 60, 70, and 80  °C dyeing was done in open bath of ultrasonic machine with and without sonication at high liquor ratio. To compare the dye uptake (%) at high/conventional process, sample was dyed at 95  °C. Optical and scanning electron microscopy were used to measure the diameter and surface changes of the fiber, respectively. Wash and rub fastness was measured on the dyed fabrics after rinsing and drying. Ultrasonic irradiation during the dyeing of wool caused an increase in the dye exhaustion rate for acid dye. This change in rate {{is believed to have been}} caused by a reduction in the viscous boundary layer of liquor surrounding the fiber present in an ultrasonic irradiated environment. An increased dye migration due to cuticle cracking and fiber swelling was not deemed to have occurred as wet fiber diameter was not changed by submersion in the dye liquor in the presence of ultrasound and no surface cracking was evident in scanning electron microscopy images. Some cuticle structure changes occurred with turning up or ripping off of the cuticle tips evident. Both wash and rub fastness were improved for ultrasonically dyed fiber with dyeing temperatures of 70 and 80  °C being suitable for the low-temperature dyeing of wool.|$|R
40|$|Eight {{functional}} single <b>jersey</b> plain <b>knitted</b> <b>fabrics</b> {{have been}} developed {{in order to assess}} a quantitative analysis of various comfort-related properties in terms of thermal control, air and water vapor permeability, wickability, coefficient of kinetic friction and antimicrobial efficiency, using eight different commercially available functional yarns: Polyester Craque and viscose Craque conventional yarns as controls; Finecool and Coolmax polyester yarns for moisture management and quick drying; Holofiber polyester yarns containing an optical responsive material that the producer claims to improve body oxygenation; Airclo polyester hollow yarns for efficient control of body temperature; and, finally, polyester Trevira and viscose Seacell for antimicrobial activity. According to the results, Coolmax for moisture management, Airclo for thermal control and Seacell for antimicrobial activity present the best performances as technical textiles for sportswear for the respective specific functional property.
