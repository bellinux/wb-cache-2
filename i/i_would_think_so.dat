Intelligence is important, but as a stand-alone tool for leadership, it lacks penetrating substance. For instance, someone can be intelligent, but awkward with relationships, thus, lacking social intelligence. Someone can be intelligent, but lack self-mastery or character intelligence, and someone can possess superior intellectual capacity, but from Divinity’s point of view this is meaningless (1 Corinthians 1 : 19 - 29). You can have a high I. Q., yet be inept in practical matters. Don’t get me wrong, intelligence is important; we should all strive to sharpen our minds and acquire more acumen, but not {{at the expense of the}} other four intelligences. There is more to intelligence than getting a high score in an aptitude test or solving enigmas others are unable to solve. Intelligence comes in many forms; it’s just not limited to mental capacity. There are other ‘intellectual ’ factors perhaps more important at work in a leader’s life. I call them The 4 Intelligences of a Leader; they are wisdom, character, social and spiritual intelligence. # 1 : Wisdom Intel l igence Wisdom, as a form of intelligence, is so needed in today’s world. Wisdom intelligence is having a deep understanding of the reality of people, things, events or situations, resulting in the ability to choose or act accordingly to produce optimum results. Isn’t everyone looking for optimum outcomes from their personal choices? <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>so!</b> You can have these results, but first, you must understand the two roads of wisdom. Wisdom has two roads; a long and short road. What I mean is, wisdom can be gained by experience (the long road) or it can be imparted instantly from above (th...|$|E

6000|$|I {{have the}} {{greatest}} difficulty in believing that Shakespeare wrote the first “mermaids.” He never, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>would</b> have <b>so</b> weakened by useless anticipation the fine image immediately following.

I therefore freely confess that I have allowed probability to weigh too much with me in my estimation of these young men."

6000|$|It {{makes me}} dizzy, {{to think of}} the Vatican--of its {{wilderness}} of statues, paintings, and curiosities of every description and every age. The [...] "old masters" [...] (especially in sculpture,) fairly swarm, there. I can not write about the Vatican. I think I shall never remember any thing I saw there distinctly but the mummies, and the Transfiguration, by Raphael, and some other things {{it is not necessary to}} mention now. I shall remember the Transfiguration partly because it was placed in a room almost by itself; partly because it is acknowledged by all to be the first oil painting in the world; and partly because it was wonderfully beautiful. The colors are fresh and rich, the [...] "expression," [...] I am told, is fine, the [...] "feeling" [...] is lively, the [...] "tone" [...] is good, the [...] "depth" [...] is profound, and the width is about four and a half feet, I should judge. It is a picture that really holds one's attention; its beauty is fascinating. It is fine enough to be a Renaissance. A remark I made a while ago suggests a thought--and a hope. Is it not possible that the reason I find such charms in this picture is because it is out of the crazy chaos of the galleries? If some of the others were set apart, might not they be beautiful? If this were set in the midst of the tempest of pictures one finds in the vast galleries of the Roman palaces, <b>would</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it <b>so</b> handsome? If, up to this time, I had seen only one [...] "old master" [...] in each palace, instead of acres and acres of walls and ceilings fairly papered with them, might I not have a more civilized opinion of the old masters than I have now? I <b>think</b> <b>so.</b> When I was a school-boy and was to have a new knife, I could not make up my mind as to which was the prettiest in the show-case, and I did not think any of them were particularly pretty; and so I chose with a heavy heart. But when I looked at my purchase, at home, where no glittering blades came into competition with it, I was astonished to see how handsome it was. To this day my new hats look better out of the shop than they did in it with other new hats. It begins to dawn upon me, now, that possibly, what I have been taking for uniform ugliness in the galleries may be uniform beauty after all. I honestly hope it is, to others, but certainly it is not to me. Perhaps the reason I used to enjoy going to the Academy of Fine Arts in New York was because there were but a few hundred paintings in it, and it did not surfeit me to go through the list. I suppose the Academy was bacon and beans in the Forty-Mile Desert, and a European gallery is a state dinner of thirteen courses. One leaves no sign after him of the one dish, but the thirteen frighten away his appetite and give him no satisfaction.|$|R
