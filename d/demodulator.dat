40|$|Abstract–In this paper, {{a theory}} of optimaf {{nonlinear}} estimation from sampIed data signals where the a posterion probability densities are approximated by Gaussian sums is adapted for application to phase and frequency estimation in high noise. The nonlinear estimators (<b>demodulators)</b> require parallel processing of the received signsf. In the limit {{as the number of}} parallel processors becomes infinite the FM <b>demodulators</b> become optimum in a minimum mean square error sense and the PM <b>demodulators</b> become optimum in some well defined sense. For the clearly suboptimaf case of one processor, the <b>demodulators</b> can be readily simplified to the familiar phase-locked loop. On the other hand, for the intermediate case, significant extension of the phase-Iocked loop threshold is actieved where (say) six parallel processors are involved. 1...|$|R

25|$|Many FM {{detector}} circuits exist. A common {{method for}} recovering the information signal {{is through a}} Foster-Seeley discriminator. A phase-locked loop {{can be used as}} an FM <b>demodulator.</b> Slope detection demodulates an FM signal by using a tuned circuit which has its resonant frequency slightly offset from the carrier. As the frequency rises and falls the tuned circuit provides a changing amplitude of response, converting FM to AM. AM receivers may detect some FM transmissions by this means, although it does not provide an efficient means of detection for FM broadcasts.|$|E
25|$|The {{received}} {{signal is}} now processed by the <b>demodulator</b> stage where the audio signal (or other baseband signal) is recovered and then further amplified. AM demodulation requires the simple rectification of the RF signal (so-called envelope detection), {{and a simple}} RC low pass filter to remove remnants of the intermediate frequency. FM signals may be detected using a discriminator, ratio detector, or phase-locked loop. Continuous wave (Morse code) and single sideband signals require a product detector using a so-called beat frequency oscillator, {{and there are other}} techniques used for different types of modulation. The resulting audio signal (for instance) is then amplified and drives a loudspeaker.|$|E
40|$|One of the {{objectives}} of a demodulation strategy is to minimize the proliferation of redundant information by keeping facts in a normal or canonical form.

2500|$|On reception, the FSK {{signal is}} {{converted}} to the original tones by mixing the FSK signal with a local oscillator called the BFO or beat frequency oscillator.

2500|$|The diagram {{at right}} shows the block diagram {{of a typical}} single-conversion {{superheterodyne}} receiver. The diagram has blocks that are common to superheterodyne receivers. The antenna collects the radio signal. [...] The tuned RF stage with optional RF amplifier provides some initial selectivity; {{it is necessary to}} suppress the image frequency (see below), and may also serve to prevent strong out-of-passband signals from saturating the initial amplifier. A local oscillator provides the mixing frequency; it is usually a variable frequency oscillator which is used to tune the receiver to different stations. [...] The frequency mixer does the actual heterodyning that gives the superheterodyne its name; it changes the incoming radio frequency signal to a higher or lower, fixed, intermediate frequency (IF). [...] The IF band-pass filter and amplifier supply most of the gain and the narrowband filtering for the radio. [...] The <b>demodulator</b> extracts the audio or other modulation from the IF radio frequency; the extracted signal is then amplified by the audio amplifier.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} {{vacuum tubes}} evolved from incandescent light bulbs, containing a filament sealed in an evacuated [...] glass envelope. When hot, the filament releases electrons into the vacuum, {{a process called}} thermionic emission, originally known as the [...] "Edison Effect". A second electrode, the anode or plate, will attract those electrons if it is at a more positive voltage. The result is a net flow of electrons from the filament to plate. However, electrons cannot flow in the reverse direction because the plate is not heated and does not emit electrons. The filament (cathode) has a dual function: it emits electrons when heated; and, together with the plate, it creates an electric field due to the potential difference between them. Such a tube with only two electrodes is termed a diode, and is used for rectification. Since current can only pass in one direction, such a diode (or rectifier) will convert alternating current (AC) to pulsating DC. Diodes can therefore {{be used in a}} DC power supply, as a <b>demodulator</b> of amplitude modulated (AM) radio signals and for similar functions.|$|E
