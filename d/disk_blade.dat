40|$|To {{develop the}} high {{performance}} and high reliability of turbomachinery {{just like an}} aeroengine, distributed collaborative time-varying least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) (called as DC-T-LSSVM) method was proposed for the dynamic probabilistic analysis of high-pressure turbine blade-tip radial running clearance (BTRRC). For structural transient probabilistic analysis, time-varying LSSVM (called as T-LSSVM) method was developed by improving LSSVM, and the mathematical model of the T-LSSVM was established. The mathematical model of DC-T-LSSVM was built based on T-LSSVM and distributed collaborative strategy. Through the dynamic probabilistic analysis of BTRRC {{with respect to the}} nonlinearity of material property and the dynamics of thermal load and centrifugal force load, the probabilistic distributions and features of different influential parameters on BTRRC, such as rotational speed, the temperature of gas, expansion coefficients, the surface coefficients of heat transfer and the deformations of <b>disk,</b> <b>blade</b> and casing, are obtained. The deformations of turbine <b>disk,</b> <b>blade</b> and casing, the rotational speed and the temperature of gas significantly influence BTRRC. Turbine disk and blade perform the positive effects on the BTRRC, while turbine casing has the negative impact. The comparison of four methods (Monte Carlo method, T-LSSVM, DCERSM and DC-T-LSSVM) reveals that the DC-T-LSSVM reshapes the possibility of the probabilistic analysis of complex turbomachinery and improves the computational efficiency while preserving the accuracy. The efforts offer a useful insight for rapidly designing and optimizing the BTRRC dynamically from a probabilistic perspective. Department of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|Parts {{made from}} fibre {{reinforced}} plastics (FRP) are first laid up on a polystyrene mould. Hence dimensional accuracy {{is dependent on}} the quality of the mould. If the parts are oversize, larger than a metre or so, the moulds must be machined in sections and fitted together. There is therefore substantial advantage in a new machining system that can manufacture the mould as one piece. Currently, moulds are machined on a multi-axis robotic or CNC machine that removes material using a milling cutter. When an observation of the current system was conducted on site, the industrial partner gave permission to use their CNC milling robot for cutting expanded polystyrene. A medium density board was also tested. The cutting forces were recorded. It was found that adapting the same cutting strategy was inefficient. The design of such a machine must be based on a new set of requirements. A number of design factors must be considered. The new machine would be massive and expensive unless three critical issues were resolved at the design stage; cutting approach, instrumentation for control of accuracy, and innovation in the drive. For removing polystyrene, slicing was considered as an alternative to milling. The fundamental operations of slicing are discussed, from simple pushing of the blade to the incorporation of sideways forces and motions. When using a straight blade, the cutting action can be assumed to act along a straight line. For a curved blade, the straight line was replaced by an effective sector curve, measured from an imaginary centre. While a curved blade and a <b>disk</b> <b>blade</b> work with the same principle, the central axis of a <b>disk</b> <b>blade</b> is fixed, thus the effective sector curve is constant. This allows the <b>disk</b> <b>blade</b> to provide constant sideways force uni-directionally. For slicing, the cutting surface has been evaluated by carving polystyrene with a variety of blades. Later, the force required for cutting with a <b>disk</b> <b>blade</b> was analysed. It was confirmed that a higher cutting speed generated higher cutting forces, but for equal feed rates the cutting force was substantially lower than that required for milling. The size of the machine was set at five metres by five in plan and two metres in height. It was necessary to devise a position transducer that could operate over these distances, while giving a resolution of a tenth of a millimetre. A transducer was devised based on the visual interpretation of graduations on a precision tape with markings at two millimetre intervals. The concept was embodied using a self-built line-scan camera. The camera performed scans at one or two millisecond intervals, leading to the choice of two millimetre graduations as a compromise between precision and the risk of aliasing at a speed of up to half a metre per second. A Cartesian gantry configuration was selected as the base platform for the cutting machine. A light weight solution was studied. Traction was provided to each axis using a soft rubber wheel and a pair of DC motors, mounted on the slider. It was possible to combine more than one motor for actuating the slider, if necessitated by heavier loads. In the development of the transducer, a displacement of five metres was achievable with the required placement accuracy. The embedded microcontroller that formed part of the transducer was equipped with an algorithm for precise movement control. Using a nonlinear velocity demand strategy enabled the motion parameters to be optimized. In summary, construction of a full-sized prototype axis has enabled the critical issues to be researched thoroughly. This had created a clear path to the final design. ...|$|E

40|$|Introduction Direct {{planting}} {{becomes more}} common in the recent years, because it conserves soil and water as well as it saves energy and time. However, this technology needs special implements such as seed planter. Given that direct planting is practiced in undisturbed lands, so it was needed to design a special furrow opener. In order to obtain a suitable furrow opener this experiment was conducted in rain-fed Agricultural Research Institute in Maragheh. Materials and Methods Most of seed planters that are used for cultivation in rain fed conditions are equipped by hoe-type furrow opener. Hoe-type furrow openers have good penetration in hard and dry soils. However, {{they do not have the}} ability for direct planting. Hoe-type furrow opener was chosen as a model. Then by changing the geometric form of the depth to width ratio (d/w), the two openers were designed. In the first design, which was called O 1 two wings and a narrow blade acting as a coulter were added in front of the hoe-type furrow opener. In the second design, which was called O 2, in addition to the O 1 modification, furrow opener width was decreased and a <b>disk</b> <b>blade</b> was added for seed sowing (Fig. 1). The performance of O 1 and O 2 openers were compared with the conventional hoe-type furrow opener (check) in soil bin and in field conditions. At three different forward speeds (1, 1. 5 and 2 m. s- 1) with 3 replications, the effects of the openers designs of vertical and horizontal soil forces were evaluated in soil-bin conditions. In order to evaluate the performance of the furrow opener in field conditions, an experiment was conducted using a split plot design based on RCBD at 4 replications. Furrow openers formed the main plots and forward speeds formed the sub plots. Each plot size was 22 meters long in two rows for each treatment. After germination of wheat crop, the numbers of seedlings in two rows were counted (along a one meter). After crop maturity, all plots were harvested by hand and grain and biological yield was measured. ANOVA test, uniformity test and mean comparison were conducted by using Genstat software. Results and Discussion The soil bin test results showed that opener design and forward speed both have significant influences on the horizontal force (p< 0. 01). Horizontal force was increased with increasing of forward speeds. The same result was reported by Wheeler and Godwin, 1996 and Astafford, 1979. The lowest horizontal force (average 1. 66 kN) occurred at 1 m. s- 1 and the highest (average 1. 94 kN) occurred at 2 m. s- 1 forward speeds. Horizontal force increased in O 2 (2. 8...|$|E

40|$|An {{efficient}} {{method is}} {{proposed for the}} early assessment of <b>bladed</b> <b>disk</b> designs with respect to blade mis-tuning effects. Structural and material differences among blades, known as blade mistuning, often cause sig-nificant increases in blade forced vibration amplitudes relative to ideal (tuned) <b>bladed</b> <b>disks,</b> and such effects are most pronounced when the <b>blades</b> and the <b>disk</b> share vibration energy actively. In this paper, it is shown that the flow of vibration energy between the <b>blades</b> and the <b>disk</b> of tuned <b>bladed</b> <b>disks</b> {{can be used to}} char-acterize disk-blade dynamic interaction, and consequently it is proposed as a means to assess blade mistuning effects. Power flow is first calculated for a simple lumped-parameter model, and it is shown to provide a phys-ical explanation for the sharp increases in blade forced response amplitudes that take place when disk-blade dynamic interactions are strong. The power flow analysis is then extended to parametric design studies of finite element models for industrial <b>bladed</b> <b>disks.</b> The calculation of coupling power flow between the <b>blade</b> and the <b>disk</b> segment for a nominal <b>bladed</b> <b>disk</b> sector is shown to enable the rapid, albeit approximate, assessment of mistuning effects on blade vibration response for the nominal <b>bladed</b> <b>disk</b> design as well as for a variety of alternate designs obtained by varying disk structural parameters.

40|$|In turbomachinery, blade crack {{detection}} methods are beneficial for condition-based maintenance and {{for reducing the}} risk of catastrophic failures due to high cycle fatigue of <b>bladed</b> <b>disks.</b> A crack can be more easily detected in a perfectly tuned <b>bladed</b> <b>disk</b> (i. e., with identical blades and sectors). That is because the crack causes mode distortion and possibly response localization. Unfortunately, perfectly tuned <b>bladed</b> <b>disks</b> are an idealization since small blade mistuning is unavoidable and it can also cause mode distortion and response localization in <b>bladed</b> <b>disks.</b> A detection method has been recently developed to detect the presence of a crack in a mistuned <b>bladed</b> <b>disk</b> and to identify which blade is cracked.

This paper introduces a method which uses a similar physical basis for detection, but requires fewer measurements, namely one measurement location per blade (e. g., obtained using tip-timing methods). The key idea is to focus on isolated modes (or isolated mode pairs) which are sensitive to the presence of a crack rather than on an entire mode family (with high modal density).

This paper investigates mistuning using a transfer function approach where the frequency response functions (FRFs) are described by natural frequencies and antiresonant frequencies.

A {{detailed description of the}} derivation of the asymptotic mistuning model for a realistic <b>bladed</b> <b>disk</b> configuration is presented. The asymptotic mistuning model results for several different mistuning patterns and forcing conditions are compared with those from a high-resolution finite element model. The asymptotic mistuning model produces quantitatively accurate results, and, probably more relevant, it gives precise information about the factors (tuned modes and components of the mistuning pattern) that actually {{play a role in the}} vibrational forced response of mistuned <b>bladed</b> <b>disks...</b>|$|R

40|$|Advanced {{structural}} dynamic {{models for}} both wedge and split underplatform dampers have been developed. The new damper models {{take into account}} inertia forces {{and the effects of}} normal load variation on stick-slip transitions at the contact interfaces. The damper models are formulated for the general case of multiharmonic forced response analysis. An approach for using the new damper models in the dynamic analysis of large-scale finite element models of <b>bladed</b> <b>disks</b> is proposed and realized. Numerical investigations of <b>bladed</b> <b>disks</b> are performed to demonstrate the capabilities of the new models and an analysis of the influence of the damper parameters on the forced response of <b>bladed</b> <b>disks</b> is mad...|$|R
40|$|Forecasts of {{the proper}} {{frequencies}} of vibration of a thick-bladed disk are difficult, because the interaction between <b>disk,</b> <b>blades,</b> ond shrouding is complex; also {{it may be necessary}} to consider modes where the wavelength at the rim is comparable with the thickness. Here a contribution is given to the solution of the problem. The case is considered when: (a) The blades have constant cross section; (b) the principal axes of inertia of the cross section of each blade are in the axial and transverse direction (these directions being specified with reference to the disk); (c) the shrouding is continuous ond joins the tips of the blades...|$|R
