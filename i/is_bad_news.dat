[...] The Wall Street Journal deemed Lomborg's work [...] "a superbly documented and readable book.". A Washington Post review claimed that [...] "Bjørn Lomborg's good news about the environment <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> for Green ideologues. His richly informative, lucid book is now the place from which environmental policy decisions must be argued. In fact, The Skeptical Environmentalist {{is the most significant}} work on the environment since the appearance of its polar opposite, Rachel Carson's Silent Spring, in 1962. It's a magnificent achievement." [...] Rolling Stone wrote that [...] "Lomborg pulls off the remarkable feat of welding the techno-optimism of the Internet age with a lefty's concern for the fate of the planet." ...|$|E
2500|$|In January 2014, Dot's lodger Poppy Meadow {{receives}} {{a phone call}} from Nick, who wants to speak to Dot. After being told by Sharon Rickman that Nick <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> <b>news,</b> she refuses to let him talk to her. Two months later, Dot is told by the police that Nick has died of respiratory failure from a heroin overdose the previous week. One of the police officers who breaks the news to Dot is Nick's son Charlie Cotton. Charlie explains that he was conceived from a brief marriage Nick had with his mother Yvonne back in the 1980s. During the funeral, Charlie and undertaker Les Coker prevent Dot from looking in the coffin. Dot is suspicious and invites Yvonne to tell the truth and she assures Dot that Charlie is her grandson. A few weeks later, Carol Jackson asks Charlie for advice, when he leaves his phone at her house, she answers a call and discovers that Nick is still alive. Following this, it is revealed that Charlie has been [...] impersonating a police officer and is actually a caretaker at a care home where Yvonne works. Charlie leaves work to find his car windows have been smashed, with a message from Nick, confirming he done it.|$|E

6000|$|You may {{say this}} <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> <b>news.</b> I {{do not believe}} it is. I believe it is good news, and the very best of news: but if it <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> <b>news,</b> I cannot help it. I did not make it so. God made it so. And God must know best. [...] God is love. And we are His children, and He loves us.
