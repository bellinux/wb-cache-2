However, operational {{factors such as the}} extracted herbal component, preparation method or concentration levels, might influence their biological activity. To assess this effect, the antioxidant activity of beverages prepared with Camellia sinensis, Aspalathus linearis or Cochlospermum angolensis, used solely or mixed with different fruit, plant or algae extracts, was studied using different formulations (bags, leaves, roots, granulates, powders, liquids) and different preparation methods (infusion, solubilisation or promptly used). The <b>DF</b> 50 (<b>dilution</b> <b>factor</b> responsible for 50 % of antioxidant activity) values were calculated to compare their antioxidant activity. A linear discriminant analysis was used to categorize the assayed samples according to their antioxidant activity and bioactive molecules profiles. The results indicated that antioxidant activity and antioxidant compounds are significantly affected by formulation and preparation method, but overall the labelled antioxidant benefits were validated. Green tea showed the highest activity, but with different behaviour within each used formulation. The high DF 50 values calculated for some products might be used to adjust the dietary dose or formulation, preventing also putative pro-oxidant effects. Hence, the obtained results might be useful to define the formulation of these highly consumed herbal beverages, enhancing their health effects...|$|R

Domestic wastewater effluents were derived from national per capita domestic water use estimates and gridded population. Monthly and annual river flows were estimated by accumulating runoff estimates using topographically derived flowdirections.

40|$|An {{atmospheric}} {{explosion of}} a low-yield nuclear device {{will produce a}} large number of radioactive isotopes, some of which can be measured with airborne detection systems. However, properly equipped aircraft may not arrive in the region where an explosion occurred for a number of hours after the event. Atmospheric conditions will have caused the radioactive plume to move and diffuse before the aircraft arrives. The science behind predicting atmospheric plume movement has advanced enough that the location of the maximum concentrations in the plume can be determined reasonably accurately in real time, or near real time. Given the assumption that an aircraft can follow a plume, this study addresses the amount of atmospheric dilution expected to occur in a representative plume as a function of time past the release event. The approach models atmospheric transport of hypothetical releases from a single location for every day in a year using the publically available HYSPLIT code. The effective <b>dilution</b> <b>factors</b> for the point of maximum concentration in an elevated plume based on a release of a non-decaying, non-depositing tracer can vary by orders of magnitude depending {{on the day of the}} release, even for the same number of hours after the release event. However, the median of the <b>dilution</b> <b>factors</b> based on releases for 365 consecutive days at one site follows a power law relationship in time, as shown in Figure S- 1. The relationship is good enough to provide a general rule of thumb for estimating typical future <b>dilution</b> <b>factors</b> in a plume starting at the same point. However, the coefficients of the power law function may vary for different release point locations. Radioactive decay causes the effective <b>dilution</b> <b>factors</b> to decrease more quickly with the time past the release event than the <b>dilution</b> <b>factors</b> based on a non-decaying tracer. An analytical expression for the <b>dilution</b> <b>factors</b> of isotopes with different half-lives can be developed given the power law expression for the non-decaying tracer.

40|$|Capture zone {{delineation}} is {{a simple}} analytical tool that has been employed in many aspects of hydrological sciences throughout recent history. While using capture zone remediation techniques, the dilution of the source contaminant is closely examined and monitored. The <b>dilution</b> <b>factor</b> is {{the ratio of the}} contaminant concentration in the pumped water over the contaminant source concentration (assumed to be constant) in a pump-and-treat setup. It is important because it provides critical information about the fluid dynamics within the aquifer, and shows how much the source has been diluted within the aquifer. The objective of this thesis is to investigate how changing the source geometry and orientation impacts the <b>dilution</b> <b>factor.</b> The scenario includes an arbitrary line-source length and orientation, fully vertically penetrating well in a homogeneous, horizontally isotropic, confined aquifer. The experiment is set under steady-state conditions. Two analytical models are performed, the first dealing with three subcases consisting of constant source concentrations (cases 1 - 3), and the second dealing with three subcases cases involving time-dependent source concentrations (cases 4 - 6). The integrals associated with cases 4 - 6 are solved in MATLAB using Gaussian quadrature and Gaussian Kronrod integration methods and demonstrate how each of these source types impacts the <b>dilution</b> <b>factor</b> calculation. After analyzing the results for the first analytical model, the overall conclusion is that the distance between the pumping well and the source is the dominant variable for increasing or decreasing the <b>dilution</b> <b>factor.</b> The source angle and source length also {{have an impact on the}} <b>dilution</b> <b>factor.</b> As these values decrease, so do the <b>dilution</b> <b>factor</b> values. The MATLAB model shows differing trends for both of the integration methods (Gaussian quadrature and Gaussian Kronrod) and the source types influence the <b>dilution</b> <b>factor.</b> The finite source decreases rapidly as the last of the source reaches the well, and then slowly flattens out until there is no longer a concentration in the system. The radioactive source and the Gaussian type source decrease with increasing time measurements. The models can be retrofitted for other source types and different variables to fit differing scenarios. Overall, the results will help with planning for future remediation projects, and these models allow for an initial screening test to be done before more robust, time intensive and expensive models can be put into place...|$|R

40|$|Of {{the many}} factors which {{influence}} {{the exposure of}} the freshwater aquatic environment to contaminating chemicals none has a more dramatic effect than dilution. Both where and when a chemical enters surface water will make an enormous difference to its impact on wildlife. This is of particular importance for "down-the-drain” chemicals as these substances are discharged to freshwaters via sewer systems after consumer use. However, too often, this dilution capacity is fixed to a “generic” value. Although the spatial variability of <b>dilution</b> <b>factors</b> is often acknowledged, temporal variability is often unaccounted for which may potentially lead to underestimating the environmental risk. To address the magnitude of these dilution differences across the world, estimates of <b>dilution</b> <b>factors</b> were developed globally at a 0. 5 ° resolution using gridded data. Thus, the focus here is on the numbers and location of the human population and the river water available to dilute their waste. The river flows estimates are calculated at both annual and monthly resolution based on readily available annual and monthly runoff estimates. The domestic waste water effluent is derived from combining gridded population and national per capita domestic water use estimates. For each grid cell both annual and monthly <b>dilution</b> <b>factors</b> were generated. This approach allowed the quantification of temporal and spatial variability of <b>dilution</b> <b>factors</b> not only at a catchment level but also at a national level, by means of statistical measures such as median and percentiles.
