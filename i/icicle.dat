5|$|Keene came to Alaska for {{the first}} time in the early 1970s to attend a cousin's wedding. Attracted by the state's beauty, she {{returned}} for several visits before making the decision in 1977 to move there — alone. Her son Lonnie was deemed old enough to make his own decisions, and he chose to remain in Minnesota. Keene took a week to drive from Minnesota to Alaska in a secondhand motorhome, ending in Homer, where she parked the motorhome at the end of Homer Spit in the Homer Spit Campground, where it remained for many years. She took a job at a fish processing facility on the Spit, the <b>Icicle</b> Seafoods subsidiary Seward Fisheries, in the spring of 1977, where she later became a foreman.|$|E
5|$|Enraged by the deception, Fionna {{takes out}} the crystal sword to fight. The sword {{turns out to be}} another one of Ice Queen’s tricks and turns into a ball of ice around Fionna’s hands. Cake hears noises from downstairs and senses Fionna is in trouble. Undaunted, Fionna uses the ice to beat Ice Queen over the head. Ice Queen pushes her off with a burst of snow which allows Fionna to get close to enough to break Prince Gumball free and knock out the Ice Queen with a broken <b>icicle.</b> Cake bursts in and sees Gumball {{standing}} next to Fionna in her torn dress; she jumps to the wrong conclusion and lunges at him but Fionna stops Cake and tells her it was the Ice Queen all along. Just then Ice Queen recovers and blasts Cake away from Fionna only to have Fionna knock her magic tiara off which negates her powers. The real Gumball asks Fionna on a date and is turned down; Fionna notes that she does not need a boyfriend at the moment.|$|E

There, they discover Eve's decapitated head inside her car. Realizing there is a killer out there, Kelli calls 9-1-1, {{only to be told}} that due to the snowstorm, help would be unavailable for at least two hours. When their housemother Mrs. Mac and Heather decide to take the car and reach the police station on their own, Kelli, Leigh and Melissa all go to Lauren's room to see them through their window and make sure they leave safely. Noticing that the car has started but they're not leaving, Kelli and Leigh go to check on them through the basement where Leigh slips on Mrs. Mac's blood, who had gotten killed by a falling <b>icicle.</b> Going back to Lauren's room, after a quick confrontation between Leigh and Kyle, they realize that Lauren has also been killed and despite protest from Kyle, decide to go to the attic in case any of the girls are still alive.|$|E

25|$|The federally {{controlled}} {{fur seal}} industry dominated {{the economy of}} the Pribilofs until 1985. St. Paul is a port for the Central Bering Sea fishing fleet, and major harbor improvements have fueled economic growth. Trident Seafoods and <b>Icicle</b> Seafoods process cod, crab, halibut and other seafoods in St. Paul. 30 residents hold commercial fishing permits for halibut. Several offshore processors are serviced out of St. Paul. The community is seeking funds to develop a halibut processing facility. Fur seal rookeries and more than 210 species of nesting seabirds attract almost 700 tourists annually. There is also a reindeer herd on the island from a previous commercial venture. Residents subsist on halibut, fur seals (1,645 may be taken each year), reindeer, marine invertebrates, plants and berries.|$|E

50|$|<b>Icicles</b> {{can pose}} both safety and {{structural}} dangers. <b>Icicles</b> that hang from an object may fall and cause injury and/or damage to whoever or whatever is below them. In addition, ice deposits can be heavy. If enough <b>icicles</b> form on an object, {{such as a}} wire or a beam or pole, {{the weight of the}} ice can severely damage the structural integrity of the object and may cause the object to break. This can also happen with roofs, where failure can damage nearby parked vehicles or the contents and occupants of the structure. <b>Icicles</b> on roofs can also be associated with ice dams, which can cause water damage as the water penetrates below the shingles.|$|R
40|$|Natural <b>icicles</b> often exhibit ripples {{about their}} {{circumference}} which {{are due to}} a morphological instability. We present an experimental study that explores {{the origin of the}} instability, using laboratory-grown <b>icicles.</b> Contrary to theoretical expectations, <b>icicles</b> grown from pure water do not exhibit growing ripples. The addition of a non-ionic surfactant, which reduces the surface tension, does not produce ripples. Instead, ripples emerge on <b>icicles</b> grown from water with dissolved ionic impurities. We find that even very small levels of impurity are sufficient to trigger ripples, and that the growth speed of the ripples increases very weakly with ionic concentration.

500|$|Later, it is {{revealed}} that Edea {{is actually the}} wife of Headmaster Cid, and was known as [...] "Matron" [...] to Squall and the other kids that lived at the orphanage. It is eventually explained that Edea was not acting of her own will, but was possessed by a sorceress from the future named Ultimecia. When Ultimecia's control is broken, Edea takes {{the side of the}} SeeDs in the struggle and joins Squall's party for a short time. However, she accidentally gives her powers to Rinoa, making her a sorceress. Being a sorceress, Edea attacks with magical bursts of energy and her Limit Break, Ice Strike, consists of a magically conjured <b>icicle,</b> hurled like a javelin. This Limit Break is depicted in a cutscene during Edea's coronation as head of Galbadia, when she (possessed by Ultimecia) attacks Squall with it.|$|E

[...] After the Spanish film development lab discovered that telephone lines, helicopters, and cars could be seen in the footage Bakshi had shot, they tried to incinerate the footage, telling Bakshi's first assistant director that [...] "if that kind of sloppy cinematography got out, no one from Hollywood would ever come back to Spain to shoot again." ...|$|E
500|$|Fionna and Cake {{are helping}} Prince Gumball {{decorate}} for the Biennial Gumball Ball when Gumball asks Fionna {{if she would}} like to go to it tonight with him. Their conversation is interrupted when the Ice Queen breaks into the castle and tries to kidnap Gumball. Fionna and Cake start to fight her before she mysteriously disappears. Gumball (who is apparently unharmed) arranges a date with Fionna. At the Tree Fort, Fionna and Cake argue over whether or not Gumball asked Fionna on a date. Cake decides to come along to help Fionna out. At the Castle Gardens, the two are met by Gumball and his steed Lord Monochromicorn. The group then flies through the air while Gumball serenades Fionna with the song [...] "Oh, Fionna" [...] and eventually asks her to be his girlfriend. When Fionna and Cake get to the ball, Prince Gumball takes Fionna to his room (decorated with candles and rose petals) and locks the door. She becomes flustered and backs away when he begins to take his shirt off. A drop of water lands on her shoulder, she looks up to see the real Prince Gumball trapped inside a giant <b>icicle</b> on the ceiling. The fake prince is revealed to be Ice Queen. Fionna is soon incapacitated; Cake senses trouble and rushes to her rescue.|$|E

500|$|Oasis {{recorded}} {{for a couple}} of months in 2007 – between July and September — completing work on two new songs and demoing the rest. Zak Starkey was made official member of the band during sessions. They took a two-month break, because of the birth of Noel's son. The band re-entered the studio on 5 November 2007 and finished recording around March 2008 with producer Dave Sardy. In May 2008, Zak Starkey left the band after recording Dig Out Your Soul, the band's seventh studio album. He was replaced by former <b>Icicle</b> Works drummer Chris Sharrock on their tour but Chris was not an official member of the band and Oasis remained as a four-piece. The first single from the record was [...] "The Shock of the Lightning" [...] written by Noel Gallagher, and was pre-released on 29 September 2008. Dig Out Your Soul, the band's seventh studio album, was released on 6 October and went to numberone in the UK and numberfive on the Billboard 200. The band started touring for a projected 18-month-long tour expected to last till September 2009, with support from Kasabian, The Enemy and Twisted Wheel. On 7 September 2008, while performing at Virgin Festival in Toronto, a member of the audience ran on stage and physically assaulted Noel. Noel suffered three broken and dislodged ribs as a result from the attack, and the group had to cancel several shows while he recovered. In June 2008, the band re-signed with Sony BMG for a three-album deal.|$|E
500|$|Yang meets Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd), an army trauma surgeon, when he patches her up {{from being}} {{stabbed in the}} stomach by a falling <b>icicle.</b> The pair are {{immediately}} attracted {{to each other and}} share a brief kiss. After Owen Hunt is honorably discharged, he is hired as Seattle Grace's chief of trauma surgery and he and Yang begin a flirtation. Yang grows emotionally when she decides to support Meredith in her relationship with Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), despite her logical misgivings about their staying power, and begins to be more emotionally open towards Hunt. However, Hunt has repressed memories of his time in Iraq and PTSD which causes Hunt to behave erratically, and attack and strangle her while asleep. Yang attempts to be emotionally supportive, but ends their relationship as she is afraid of sleeping next to him. Cristina loses her shot at being the first resident to perform a solo surgery despite being unanimously chosen by the attending surgeons, having been disciplined from failing to report the irresponsible behavior of the new interns. Meredith and Cristina have a fight during the intern scandal, and Cristina chooses Alex to be her replacement. They eventually reconcile. When Izzie Stevens discovers her life-threatening cancer, Yang is the one she confides in over her other friends due to Yang's ability to remain emotionally distant. Yang saves Izzie's life by coming up with a treatment plan and forcing Izzie to tell their friends of her diagnosis. Hunt begins seeing a therapist, and Yang confesses her love for him. The pair begin a tentative relationship, hampered by Hunt's therapeutic progress and his hot and cold professional behavior, wherein he frequently ignores or penalizes Yang to avoid the appearance of favoritism.|$|E
