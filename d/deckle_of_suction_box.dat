40|$|AbstractOptimal {{hydraulic}} {{design is}} very important in the selection of pumping station design schemes. Through optimal hydraulic design of pumping system it is possible to generate better flow conditions for pump, to reduce hydraulic losses both in <b>suction</b> <b>box</b> and discharge passage and improve pumping system efficiency. Guiding principles and evaluation indexes for optimal hydraulic design of pumping system was proposed, and a case study was given to illustrate the effect of optimal design on the pumping system performances. The time-averaged three dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations were closed by RNG turbulence model and SIMPLEC arithmetic was adopted to couple pressure and velocity fields. Computed results indicate that with the given water level data and within the limitations of civil construction dimensions, the flow conditions of pump in terms of bias angle and distribution uniformity of axial velocity are effectively improved through optimal design, and hydraulic losses <b>of</b> <b>suction</b> <b>box</b> and discharge passage are decreased by 0. 115 m and the pumping system efficiency are improved by 2. 02 %. The validity of optimal method by means of computational fluid dynamics is verified by a model pumping system test...|$|R

Dual {{purpose of the}} investigation was to develop an impeller/pump case combination showing significantly less cavitation at the impeller leading-edges than the original design, and realize specific rate objectives for meeting new duty points to eliminate high pressure throttling over the discharge valve. New impeller designs were tested in a full scale model test pump running at reduced speed, which was equipped with an acrylic viewing window for direct observation of the impeller blade cavitation. Elements of the experimental effort included determination {{of the effect of}} impeller (vane) design changes, along with the effect <b>of</b> <b>suction</b> <b>box</b> changes introduced at the splitter vanes. Initially, a total of four alternative impeller designs were considered, form which potentially best design was selected and tuned to specification. The new impeller design developed typically had sharp elliptic leading-edges to overcome the cavitation problem. Compared with the original design, in which impellers were replaced/repaired after less than one year of operation, the new impeller lifetime was calculated to be improved by at least a factor of eight, on the basis of cavitation bubble length. The NPSH required for the new design proved to be much better than for the original design, and, additionally the efficiency was established to be improved by one to two percent. Furthermore, a <b>suction</b> <b>box</b> splitter vane modification has led to less (cavitation) bubble activity in the eye area...|$|R

After the dry line are the <b>suction</b> <b>boxes</b> with applied vacuum. <b>Suction</b> <b>boxes</b> extend up to the couch roll. At the couch the sheet consistency should be about 25%.|$|R
50|$|Two large rolls {{typically}} {{form the}} ends of the drainage section, which is called the drainage table. The breast roll is located under the flow box, the jet being aimed to land on it at about the top centre. At {{the other end of the}} drainage table is the suction (couch) roll. The couch roll is a hollow shell, drilled with many thousands of precisely spaced holes of about 4 to 5 mm diameter. The hollow shell roll rotates over a stationary <b>suction</b> <b>box,</b> normally placed at the top centre or rotated just down machine. Vacuum is pulled on the <b>suction</b> <b>box,</b> which draws water from the web into the <b>suction</b> <b>box.</b> From the <b>suction</b> roll the sheet feeds into the press section.|$|R
40|$|In {{previous}} studies on <b>suction</b> <b>box</b> dewatering, three mechanisms were identified that determine the dry {{content of a}} web, viz. web compression, displacement of water by air and rewetting. In the present work, {{the relative importance of}} the three mechanisms was investigated through direct measurement of the web deformation, the dry content changes during and after the suction pulse, the air flow through the fibre network and the saturation of the web after the suction pulse. Suction pressure, suction time and rewetting time were varied. The experiments were done with chemical and mechanical pulp webs of various grammages. It was found that a large web deformation took place during the suction pulse, particularly at its beginning. Compression dewatering was found to be the most dominant dewatering mechanism. Displacement dewatering started after most of the web compression had occurred. Its contribution to the increase in dry content was most pronounced for higher suction pressures, longer suction times and for chemical pulp webs. A surprisingly large expansion of the web was observed immediately after the suction pulse. This expansion was the effect of rewetting. This rewetting strongly reduced the dry content of the web if the web had not been immediately separated from the forming fabric at the end <b>of</b> the <b>suction</b> pulse. Under the conditions studied, the decrease in dry content amounted to the order of 3 to 6 %. Rewetting was smaller for longer suction times and higher suction pressures. A considerable air flow through the web occurred under these conditions. This air flow apparently moved water from the forming fabric into the <b>suction</b> <b>box,</b> thus making less water available for rewetting. Rewetting for mechanical pulp webs was more pronounced and took place faster than for chemical pulps. The use of a membrane on top of the web during <b>suction</b> <b>box</b> dewatering proved to be advantageous for reducing the air flow through the web. However, under the conditions investigated, the dry content could not be improved. Although the web compression was increased when using a membrane, especially at a higher suction pressure, rewetting after the suction pulse had an even larger negative impact on the dry content, which, as a result, was lower.

40|$|The {{underlying}} {{motives of}} the research undertaken here are twofold: to obtain {{a deeper understanding of}} the dewatering mechanisms at the forming section of a papermaking machine and to develop numerical models that describe the flow through forming fabrics. More comprehensive knowledge of dewatering in the forming section allows suggestions to be made for improvements that reduce the amount of energy used in the process without affecting the quality of the end product.   The objective of this thesis is to answer the following questions: How and why does rewetting occur at the high vacuum <b>suction</b> <b>boxes?</b> How does the structure of the forming fabric affect dewatering at the forming section? Is it possible to create accurate numerical models for forming fabrics, and can these be used to predict the dewatering behaviour of new types of fabrics?   Laboratory and pilot studies simulating high vacuum <b>suction</b> <b>boxes</b> were performed together with numerical modelling of the flow of air and water through both the forming fabric and the paper sheet.   The conclusion drawn from the pilot study is that rewetting significantly lowers the dryness of the paper sheet exiting the <b>suction</b> <b>boxes.</b> The phenomenon is extremely rapid and is most likely driven by capillary forces. The high speed at which this rewetting occurs makes it difficult to impede by placing the <b>suction</b> <b>boxes</b> closer to the couch pick-up: the solution is more likely to be the use of new and improved designs of the forming fabric. The structure of the forming fabric has been shown to affect the dewatering rate at certain conditions of vacuum dewatering, and can possibly be connected partly to the fact that fibres penetrate the surface of the fabric to varying degrees and partly to the flow resistance of the different fabric structures. Numerical models of high accuracy can be constructed and used to predetermine how new fabric designs would affect dewatering at the forming section.   This thesis quantifies aspects of dewatering such as rewetting and the influence of the forming fabric. Understanding these dewatering aspects further provides for the potential enhancement of energy efficiency in the forming section, and thereby the entire papermaking process. The forming fabric can play an important role in improving energy efficiency: rewetting after the high vacuum <b>suction</b> <b>boxes</b> occurs more rapidly than was previously known, so its design might be the only possible way of impeding it. The forming fabric can also improve the rate of dewatering: it is therefore likely that its design will be important in the next stage of developing energy efficiency and thereby play a part in achieving a more sustainable future.

40|$|In {{previous}} studies {{it has been}} corroborated that rewetting occurs after <b>suction</b> <b>boxes</b> and couch rolls. A certain amount of water is left in the forming fabric after the suction zone, resulting in external rewetting which decreases the dry content of the web with 3 - 5 % - units. In the present work different super absorbents with high absorption capacity were used with the intension to absorb the water left in the forming fabric after a suction pulse before it flowed back into the web. First the possibility of reducing rewetting was investigated in laboratory scale. A super absorbent was placed underneath the forming fabric and the web in a laboratory <b>suction</b> <b>box</b> during a <b>suction</b> pulse. A number of different absorbents were tested and several of them did significantly reduce the rewetting of the web. In some trials the reached dry content did not decrease at all after the suction pulse. Second the idea was verified in pilot scale. The rewetting was unfortunately not reduced in the same extent in the pilot trials as in the laboratory trials. But with the proposed justifications of the method it could be proved to work in also pilot scale. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} study the effect <b>of</b> <b>suction</b> on shear {{strength}} and dilatancy of an unsaturated expansive soil, suction-controlled direct shear tests were carried out on both the natural and re-compacted specimens. The soil was a silty clay with an intermediate plasticity and a medium expansion potential. It was clearly shown that the dilatancy of the expansive clay increased with the increase <b>of</b> applied <b>suction</b> for both the natural and compacted specimens. Metric suction contributed to the shear strength of the expansive clay via two different mechanisms: one was the contribution of capillary force on inter-particle normal stress, {{the other was the}} effect <b>of</b> <b>suction</b> on soil dilatancy. As a result of the second mechanism, the contribution <b>of</b> <b>suction</b> to the peak shear strength for the clay was more significant than that to post-failure shear strength, particularly at high suction range. As compared with the compacted specimens, the natural specimens were higher in the peak shear strength and the dilatancy due to the cementation effect of the iron and manganese oxides.
