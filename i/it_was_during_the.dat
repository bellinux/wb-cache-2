With the exception of plural forms of verbs and a slightly different syntax, particularly in the written language, the language was the same as the Swedish of today. The plural verb forms appeared decreasingly in formal writing into the 1950s, when their use was removed from all official recommendations.|$|E

5|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> {{first half}} of the twentieth century that the first women's fraternities were established.

A Kappa Delta chapter followed in 1932, and a chapter of Zeta Tau Alpha was established twenty years later in 1952.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> {{last years}} of the 18th century that the area {{developed}} from a loose collection of hamlets into the town of Coatbridge. The town's development and growth have been intimately connected with the technological advances of the industrial revolution, and in particular with the hot blast process. Coatbridge was a major Scottish centre for iron works and coal mining during the 19th century and in this period was described as 'the industrial heartland of Scotland' and the 'Iron Burgh'.|$|E

Without Wallez, Hergé became despondent, and in March 1934 he tried to resign, but was encouraged to stay after his monthly salary was increased from 2000 and 3000 francs and his workload was reduced, with Jamin taking responsibility for the day-to-day running of Le Petit Vingtième.|$|E

5|$|Moreover, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> Komnenian {{period that}} contact between Byzantium and the 'Latin' Christian West, {{including}} the Crusader states, {{was at its}} most crucial stage.

Above all, the cultural impact of Byzantine art on the west at this period was enormous and of long lasting significance.|$|E

5|$|The pre-dreadnought {{battleship}} in {{its heyday}} was {{the core of a}} very diverse navy. Many older ironclads were still in service. Battleships served alongside cruisers of many descriptions: modern armoured cruisers which were essentially cut-down battleships, lighter protected cruisers, and even older unarmoured cruisers, sloops and frigates whether built out of steel, iron or wood. The battleships were threatened by torpedo boats; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> pre-dreadnought era that the first destroyers were constructed to deal with the torpedo-boat threat, though {{at the same time the}} first effective submarines were being constructed.|$|E
