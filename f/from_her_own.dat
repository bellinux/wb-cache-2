5|$|Kann {{asserts that}} she {{nevertheless}} possessed qualities appreciated in a monarch: warm heart, practical mind, firm determination and sound perception. Most importantly, {{she was ready}} to recognise the mental superiority of some of her advisers and to give way to a superior mind while enjoying support of her ministers even if their ideas differed <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>own.</b> Joseph, however, was never able to establish rapport with the same advisers, even though their philosophy of government was closer to Joseph's than to Maria Theresa's.|$|E
5|$|Marie St. Clare – Wife of Augustine, {{she is a}} self-absorbed woman {{without a}} hint of {{compassion}} for those around her, including her own family. Given to an unending list of (apparently imaginary) physical maladies, she continually complains about the lack of sympathy she is receiving. She has separated her personal maid, Mammy, <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> two children because they would interfere with her duties. As Marie drives Mammy to exhaustion, she criticizes her for selfishly seeking to attend her own family. Upon the unexpected death of Augustine, Marie countermands the legal process that would have given Tom his freedom.|$|E

A peasant woman {{with none of}} the {{physical}} beauty of her cousin, Bette has rejected a series of marriage proposals from middle-class suitors, and remains unmarried at the age of 42.

5|$|Akane Tsunemori {{was created}} by the Production I.G staff to be the most {{relatable}} character in the series. She would question the setting from the audience's point of view and have it explained to them. She was written as the heroine, who would come between the main character, Shinya Kogami, and his main rival, Shogo Makishima, and see their conflict <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> viewpoint. One of the staff's main objectives was Akane's growth. Akane appears {{at the start of the}} first season as an innocent rookie who matures through her experiences. This was affirmed by Japanese female actor Kana Hanazawa, who voices Akane in Japanese. Hanazawa said one of the focal points of the series after the third episode was the changes Akane would undergo; she would be influenced by many unfamiliar, traumatic experience she must endure as part of her policing role.|$|E
5|$|Dorset House had {{space for}} 800 {{patients}} in residence during the 1930s, moving to Bromsgrove during World War II. The building was damaged during the war, so in 1946, the School of Occupational Therapy moved to Oxford, whilst the patients moved to Clevedon. To ensure costs were kept {{down for the}} patients, Casson subsidised their treatment <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> funds. She began to release control of the projects in 1948, first by passing the school to a nonprofit company with her as vice-president and remaining as medical director. Then, in 1949, Casson created the Elizabeth Casson Trust which focused on occupational therapy treatment and education, {{with the majority of}} funds going to Dorset House school. In 1992, the school became part of Oxford Brookes University.|$|E

5|$|During {{the reign}} of King Henry I, in 1100, his wife Queen Matilda (or Maud), {{directed}} that the road should be routed further south, and paid for two bridges, one to cross the Lee {{and the other to}} cross the Channelsea River, <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> funds. She also paid for the road to be built between them, and the location of the bridge became known as Stratford-atte-Boghe, later Stratford-le-Bow, and finally dropped Stratford to become Bow or Bow Bridge. John Leland, writing in the 1500s, gives a more fanciful account, in which the queen falling into the water prompted the action. The addition of le-Bow probably had less to do with the shape of the bridge than the fact that arch was derived from arcus, meaning bow. This was the style of French bridges rather than the Anglo Saxon straight construction, and its design gave it its name.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth grew camellias {{in every}} one of her gardens, and before her flag-draped coffin was taken from Windsor to lie in state at Westminster Hall, an {{arrangement}} of camellias <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> gardens was placed on top. An estimated 200,000 people over three days filed past as she lay in state in Westminster Hall at the Palace of Westminster. Members of the household cavalry and other branches of the armed forces stood guard at the four corners of the catafalque. At one point, her four grandsons Prince Charles, Prince Andrew, Prince Edward and Viscount Linley mounted the guard as a mark of respect—an honour similar to the Vigil of the Princes at the lying in state of King George V.|$|E

When Lisa's aunt, Linda, arrives at Karin's house to retrieve her niece, she is attacked and killed by an unseen force as tree branches sway in the wind above her.

5|$|On 4 September, Mary Kom had {{its world}} premiere at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival, where {{it became the}} first Hindi film to be {{screened}} on the opening night of the film festival. It was initially released to 1500 screens worldwide. The film was released in overseas markets by Eros International {{as part of a}} four-film deal between Eros and Viacom 18 studios. The rights to television broadcasting belonged to Viacom18's flagship general entertainment channel Colors. The film was not released in Kom's home state of Manipur because of the ban on Bollywood films by the Imphal-based separatist militant group, Revolutionary Peoples Front (RPF) since 2000. In an interview with Press Trust of India, Kom expressed her sadness that people <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> state {{would not be able to}} see her biopic. However, unauthorised DVDs and VCDs flooded the state, with the DVD format in great demand as the only option for native people to watch the film.|$|E
5|$|Pitman was a hapa-haole, of part Hawaiian {{and part}} Caucasian descent. His father {{was white and}} his {{native-born}} mother was also part Caucasian <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> mother, who {{was the daughter of}} Captain Cox and a Hawaiian chiefess. Despite his mixed-race ancestry, Pitman avoided the racial segregation imposed on other Native Hawaiian volunteers in this period. Most Native Hawaiians who participated in the war were assigned to colored regiments, but Pitman's fair skin color meant he was able to serve in a white unit, indicating that unit assignment may have been influenced by how dark Hawaiians appeared. Historians Bob Dye, James L. Haley and others claimed Pitman was placed in the colored regiments because of his mixed race, but regiment records indicate otherwise.|$|E
5|$|Angel {{finds that}} he cannot {{stop talking about}} his divorce when trying to meet new women at a bar. After he meets a woman {{recovering}} <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> divorce, he has to leave her {{to speak to a}} prostitute whom he sees across the room with a prosthetic hand and fingernails painted {{in the same way as}} the Ice Truck Killer's first victim. Working on a hunch that the Ice Truck Killer is an acrotomophiliac, Angel decides to speak to Debra's boyfriend, Rudy Cooper, a prosthetics specialist and (unbeknownst to anyone else) the actual Ice Truck Killer. Rudy cooperates with the interview upon realizing that Angel does not know his identity. Later, Angel is stabbed in a parking lot by a masked man. Angel manages to elbow him in the face before two men scare the attacker off. Minutes later, Rudy - who had earlier fallen out with Debra due to secretly having dinner with Dexter - arrives with flowers. They kiss, but Rudy backs away complaining of a cut lip, suggesting that he was Angel's attacker.|$|E

5|$|Because of his father's {{success in}} {{business}} and his mother's descent from Hawaiian royalty, the Pitman family was considered quite prosperous and were host to the royal family when they visited Hilo. Besides {{being one of the}} leading merchants in town, his father also served the government as district magistrate of Hilo. Henry's mother, Kinoʻole, had inherited control over much of the lands in Hilo and Ōlaʻa <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> father, and King Kamehameha III had granted her use of the ahupuaʻa of Hilo after her marriage. During Henry's early childhood, the family lived in the mansion that Benjamin Pitman had built in 1840, in an area known as Niopola, one of the favored resort spots of ancient Hawaiian royalty. The residence also became known as the Spencer House after Pitman sold it to his business partner Captain Thomas Spencer. The property later became the site of the Hilo Hotel, built in 1888 and torn down in 1956. In the 1850s the family moved to the capital of Honolulu where Benjamin Pitman took up banking and built a beautiful two-story house that he named Waialeale ("rippling water") at the corner of Alakea and Beretania Streets.|$|E

5|$|Their engagement, {{announced}} in May 1901, was unexpected {{by family and}} friends, as Peter had shown no prior interest in women, and members of society assumed he was homosexual. At the age of 19, on 9 August 1901, Olga married 33-year-old Peter. After the celebration the newlyweds left for the Oldenburg palace on the Field of Mars. Olga spent her wedding night alone in tears, while her husband left for a gambling club returning the next morning. Their marriage remained unconsummated, and Olga suspected that Peter was pushed into proposing by his ambitious mother. Biographer Patricia Phenix thought Olga may have accepted his proposal to gain independence <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> mother, the Dowager Empress, or avoid marriage into a foreign court. The couple initially lived with her in laws Alexander Petrovich and Eugénie Maximilianovna of Oldenburg. It was not an harmonious arrangement as Peter's parents, both well known for their philanthropic work, berated their only son for his laziness. Eugénie, {{a close friend of}} the Dowager Empress, showered her daughter-in-law with gifts including a ruby tiara that had been a present to Joséphine de Beauharnais from Napoleon, but Olga took a dislike towards her mother-in-law. A few weeks after the wedding, Olga and her husband traveled to Biarritz, France, from where they sailed to Sorrento, Italy, on a yacht loaned to them by King Edward VII of Great Britain.|$|E
