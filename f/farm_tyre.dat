50|$|On December 31, 1972 the <b>farm</b> <b>tyre</b> {{plant was}} put into service. Truck and car tyre plant began to roll out tyres on September 30, 1976. On January 31, 1985 a fourth plant joined Belshina family, it was the {{earthmover}} tyre plant. In May 1992 the State Committee on Industry of the Republic of Belarus issued a decree transforming the Belshina Production Amalgamation into Belarus Tyre Works Belshina. On September 26, 2002 the Executive Committee of Mogilev Province adopted resolution No.18-13 on registering an open joint stock company Belshina (Certificate of Registration No.700016217 of 2003-09-27).|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} {{experimental}} activities designed and undertaken for deriving {{the characteristics of}} <b>farm</b> tractor <b>tyres</b> are presented. By means of a proprietary measuring hub the three forces and the three moments acting at the hub of a farm tractor wheel have been measured, at different combinations of lateral and longitudinal tyre slips. Tyre steady state characteristics have been derived both on hard asphalt road and on soft soil. The validation of the measurements of tyre characteristics has been performed indirectly by introducing the data referring to tyre characteristics into a detailed mathematical model of a farm tractor. A number of actual manoeuvres have been simulated. The satisfactory agreement between simulated and measured results has provided the necessary condition for the validation of the tyre characteristic measureme nt process...|$|R
50|$|The Vanguard Way, {{a long-distance}} walk, {{goes through the}} village, and the South Downs Way passes along the Downs just above it. Walkers often stop and travel down into the village. A common walk {{in this area is}} to start at the village car park, walk down the road known as The Village, past Church <b>Farm</b> and the <b>tyre</b> heap, and on to the {{dilapidated}} New Barn, {{just a few years ago}} an important store for hay from the surrounding fields, but now falling apart. This building is made of attractive red-rusting iron and next to it is an old stone farmhouse - currently unused and overgrown with plants, but in good condition, it is home to wood warblers in the summer and grey wagtails often feed by it. The hedgerows in this area are excellent for bird life and a lot of rabbits can be seen hopping around. Walks can continue from the New Barn up along a shaded avenue to a large hedgerow full of blackberries in autumn. From here there is a winding path up onto the Downs and this is where the walker meets the South Downs Way. One can then continue into Alfriston. The area at the end of this walk is home to red foxes.|$|R
