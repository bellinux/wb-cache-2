5000|$|Musick and {{his crew}} of six died in {{the crash of the}} S-42 Samoan Clipper near Pago Pago, American Samoa, on a cargo and survey flight to Auckland, New Zealand. About one hour after {{take-off}} the aircraft reportedly experienced an engine oil leak and Musick turned back toward Pago Pago. After the crew reported they were <b>dumping</b> <b>fuel</b> in preparation for a precautionary landing, an explosion tore the aircraft apart in flight. Pan American stated {{at the time that the}} <b>fuel</b> <b>dump</b> <b>valves</b> underneath the wings likely vented vaporized fuel near the engines' exhaust ports, causing the explosion and loss of the flying boat. Floating wreckage from the plane was later found about 14 miles northwest of Pago Pago by the U.S. naval seaplane tender [...] The bodies of the seven crewmen were not recovered.|$|R

25|$|<b>Dump</b> <b>valves</b> {{are used}} to release air from the bag when in the water. They can be {{operated}} manually at the valve by a diver or may be remotely operated by a pull-cord, which may be operated by a diver or attached to a weight which will automatically open the valve if the weight is lifted off the bottom. Some <b>dump</b> <b>valves</b> can be operated in both these ways. One system operates by pressing on the top or pulling a line attached to the bottom to actuate the spring-loaded <b>valve.</b> The <b>dump</b> <b>valve</b> may be a screw-in quick change system, and the spring tension may be adjustable.|$|R

50|$|Double <b>dump</b> <b>valves,</b> {{also known}} as double flap valves or double flap gates, are a type of airlock valve {{commonly}} used in industrial applications as a component in bulk material handling applications. Double <b>dump</b> <b>valves</b> are primarily used to discharge chunky or fibrous, bulk materials from hoppers, bins, and cyclones operating under positive or negative pressure. Double <b>dump</b> <b>valves</b> are used to discharge a flow of material {{while at the same}} time serving as an airlock transition point to preserve the pressure differential above and below the valve. This type of material handling valve is ideal for use with bulky or abrasive materials that would tend to jam or damage a rotary feeder.|$|R

50|$|This type {{of double}} <b>dump</b> <b>valve</b> works essentially, like a stacked pair of trickle valves. Each flap plate is held {{closed with a}} {{counterweighted}} arm. As material builds up on the top plate {{the weight of the}} head of material pushes it open where it dumps onto the bottom plate. This type of double <b>dump</b> <b>valve</b> has no electrical or pneumatic controls and is the least expensive method of operation. However, it is difficult to sustain a properly timed cycle.|$|R
