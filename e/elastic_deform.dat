According to {{characteristics}} of WN gear multi-point meshing and double-arc tooth contact, the {{finite element analysis}} model of the WN gear drive is established by Pro/E and ANSYS modeling techniques. The contact way and meshing feature of the WN gear under the different conditions and parameters are studied by three-dimensional dynamic meshing simulation analysis of gear drive. The analysis model of contact strength at loading driving is established by three dimensional geometric contact characteristics and <b>elastic</b> <b>deform</b> theory. Impact of helix angle and center distance error in the calculation of WN gear contact strength on maximum contact stress is analyzed. The results show that increase of the helix angle and a slight decrease of the center distance can improve the contact strength...|$|E

40|$|The phase {{transformation}} of GaN bulk from the Wurtzite phase (WZ) to the hexagonal phase (HX) is studied by molecular dynamics simulation. The mechanical response and atomic structural evolution of transition are analyzed in detail. In addition, the loading rate {{effect on the}} phase transition is determined, that is, the phase transition ratio declines with a decrease of the strain rate. The WZ GaN bulk completely transforms into the HX phase {{in the case of}} compression at an ultrahigh strain rate. However, at a relatively slower strain rate, the HX phase of GaN partly nucleates and the untransformed regions are proved to be <b>elastic</b> <b>deformed</b> regions. Combined with an energy analysis, two atomic movement modes are recognized as the inducements for the phase transition and formation of <b>elastic</b> <b>deformed</b> regions. The first mode, which is responsible for the formation of <b>elastic</b> <b>deformed</b> regions, is an atomic sliding motion along the c { 0001 } planes. The second mode is a radial stretching atomic motion. The radial stretching motion, which requires a lot of energy, induces the WZ-HX phase transition. Moreover, the phase transition is affected drastically by the rise of temperature...|$|R

50|$|Both {{leaf blade}} and petiole {{structure}} influence the leaf's response to forces such as wind, allowing {{a degree of}} repositioning to minimise drag and damage, as opposed to resistance. Such leaf movement may also increase turbulence of the air {{close to the surface}} of the leaf, which thins the boundary layer of air immediately adjacent to the surface, increasing the capacity for gas and heat exchange, as well as photosynthesis. Strong wind forces may result in diminished leaf number and surface area, which while reducing drag, involves a trade off of also reduces photosynthesis. Thus, leaf design may involve compromise between carbon gain, thermoregulation and water loss on the one hand, and the cost of sustaining both static and dynamic loads. In vascular plants, perpendicular forces are spread over a larger area and are relatively flexible in both bending and torsion, enabling <b>elastic</b> <b>deforming</b> without damage.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{this article}} we obtain rigorously the {{homogenization}} limit for a fluid-structurereactive flow system. It consists of cell tissue and intercellular liquid, transporting solutes. The cell tissue is supposed linearly <b>elastic</b> and <b>deforming</b> with a viscous non-stationary flow. The elastic moduli of the tissue change with cumulative concentration value. In the limit, when the scale parameter goes to zero, we obtain the quasi-static Biot system, coupled with the upscaled reactive flow. Effective Biot’s coefficients depend on the reactant concentration. Additionally to the weak two-scale convergence results, we prove convergence of the elastic and viscous energies. This then implies a strong two-scale convergence result for the fluid-structure variables. Next we establish the regularity of the solutions for the upscaled equations. In our knowledge, {{it is the only}} known study of the regularity of solutions to the quasi-static Biot system. The regularity is used to prove the uniqueness for the upscaled model...|$|R
40|$|The dynamic {{stability}} of rotating elastic circular rings subject to magnetic levitation and radially recentering magnetic forces is studied.

A Lagrangian description of the motion is obtained with respect to the rotating frame. The equations of motion are transformed into a set of ODEs according to a Faedo–Galerkin discretization. The effects of the magnetic and gyroscopic forces on the equilibrium states of the ring are investigated together with the loss of stability of the low-frequency modes. Circular elastic rings with open and closed thin-walled cross sections (i. e., L-shaped and boxed cross sections) are considered.

40|$|In many {{industries}} particulate solids {{are handled}} in different forms. When producing particles breakage {{is an important}} wanted, {{in the case of}} grinding, or unwanted phenomenon. Granules often consist of more than one component and multiple phases. This means that granules are strongly anisotropic and inhomogeneous which makes mechanical characterization difficult, so the strength is difficult to measure. The objective of this thesis is to develop and validate new particle breakage testers from an industrial point of view. The philosophy behind the breakage testers is to isolate the forces that cause damage to the particles. This requires repeated stress cycles to be transfered to the test particles. To validate the improved attrition tester with an industrial application, the damage per unit energy is compared to the damage caused during dilute phase pneumatic conveying. Wear observed during Pneumatic conveying correlates well with results from the improved attrition tester for particles having surface asperities. But only during the so called rounding off phase. The asperities act as a fracture buffer absorbing energy from the impact. First the attrition process removes asperities. Then fracture occurs. Besides the validation of the attrition tester a new breakage tester testing tangential forces is developed in this work. The abrasion tester, is based on a particle box following a planetary motion. This motion causes the particles to rotate continuously over the particle box wall. The particle wear during abrasion testing, expressed in mass loss over transferred kinetic energy is in the same order as during attrition testing. This is explained by the same efficiency at which the kinetic energy is converted into particle deformation. The kinetic energy is converted into newly created surface energy. And the efficiency at which this occurs is a particle property. The major difference between abrasion and attrition testing is the absence of the accelerated removal of surface asperities. A qualitative difference between abrasion and attrition testing is also presented. Abrasion is characterized by the gentle polishing of the particles. Whereas attrition testing results in the removal of the asperities and "craters" are visible of the impact sites of the particle with the wall. Often granules are coated with a water soluble polymeric coating in order to improve the mechanical strength. The question arises what polymeric properties are important to form a mechanically strong coating on a particle? The work of Rowe is cited about the adhesion of the coatings to the particles. Rowe found an inverse relation between coating thickness and film adhesion. Indicating that a thick coating does not necessarily leads to stronger granules. To study the influence of different coating polymers on the overall particle strength, particle formulations are made using fluidised bed coating. The formulated particles are then tested using the developed attrition, abrasion and compression tester. Three attrition sub regimes are identified, the peeling, erosion and layer fatigue modes. The conclusion is that for an <b>elastic</b> <b>deforming</b> brittle polymer, the layer fatigue attrition sub mechanism is expected. Applying a plastic deforming coating leads to a reservoir system where the fragments are held together by the plastic deforming coating. A plastic deforming coating on sodium benzoate shows the erosion mechanism during attrition testing. The coated granules are abrasion tested. A linear relation between remaining mass and transfered energy is observed. During abrasion testing {{it was not possible to}} remove all the coating completely. Apparently the rate of strain in the abrasion tester is not high enough for the coatings to be removed. Applying higher strain rates by increasing the centripetal force could overcome this. At this moment it is mechanically not possible. Also the coated particles are much stronger towards abrasion testing than to attrition testing. This is explained by the perceived thickness of the coating. The compression strength of coated granules is not easy to quantify since there is a large spread in the observed critical stress. This large spread is due to the heterogeneous nature of the granules. Weibull statistics are successfully applied to statistically describe the observed strength of the coated granules. Using Weibull statistics a ranking can be made between the coatings and the compression strength. A plastic deforming coating tends to hold the particle together as a reservoir upon compression. An <b>elastic</b> <b>deforming</b> coating has a higher initial strength without regions of plastic deformation. Individual failure of different layers is observed. This compares also to the layer fatigue attrition mechanism where initially no attrition is observed but after a while the granules start to fail. Chemical engineeringApplied Science...|$|R
