For the purpose of the study 6 intervarsity level male hockey players who represented University of Lucknow, Lucknow, India were selected as the subjects. The mean age, height and body weight of the selected subjects were 20 yrs, 169. 67 cm and 59. 5 kg, respectively. One high speed camcorder was used to capture the <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> <b>penalty</b> stroke. The camcorder was placed at 10 meters away from the penalty spot on the saggital plane of the subjects and perpendicular to the backline. The height of the camcorder was adjusted as required 1. 5 meters from the ground. At each critical corner of the goal post i. e. right top corner (RTC), left top corner (LTC), right ground corner (RGC) and left ground corner (LGC), specially designed (2 × 2 feet) targets were placed to determine the ball accuracy. After experimental setup the subjects were asked to perform 3 penalty strokes each for all four corners of the goalpost with 45 degree stance (DS). Their movements during the execution were recorded in the camcorder. After recording all the video footages were downloaded into personal computer and subjected to biomechanical analysis.

40|$|Background: Sexual	harassment	is	a	problematic	issue	where	women	and	men	work	together. It	is	being	recognized as a	violation	of	human	rights	and	human	dignity	which	undermines	the	equality	of	opportunity	and	treatment between men	and	women. So,	 this	study	was	conducted	in	Kathmandu	which	helps	to	find	out	women's	experience	of sexual harassment	and	its	impact	on	them. Methods: Descriptive	study	was	conducted	in	six	carpet	factories,	 selected	purposively. A	semi-structured {{questionnaire}} was	used	to	find	out	experience	of	sexual	harassment	and	its	impact	on	their	job,	 mental	and	physical health. The	organizational	context	and	job	context	of	those	factories	were	also	studied. Results: From	the	study,	 72 %	 workers	had	heard	about	Sexual	Harassment	and	among	them,	 52 %	 had	faced	it	in their workplace. The	most	frequent	type	of	sexual	harassment	was	passing	vulgar	jokes,	 remarks	or	teasing	obscenely (87 %). Twenty	three	percent	of	the	workers	felt	disruption	on	their	job,	 61 %	 were	affected	mentally	and	 8 %	 {{were affected}} physically	after	harassment. All	the	workers	felt	provision	and	<b>execution</b>	<b>of</b>	<b>penalty</b>	to	the	perpetrator. But none of	the	factory	had	policy	on	sexual	harassment	or	none	of	the	worker	had	complained	about	sexual	harassment to the	authority	yet. Conclusions: Female	workers	are	very	much	vulnerable	to	sexual	harassment	by	their	male	co	workers. It	negatively impacts their	performance,	 mental	and	physical	health.

40|$|The author explores a {{scarce and}} unusual {{phenomenon}} for the 19 th century Serbia, of the emphasized nexus between crime and penalty. The author marks that special, symbolical relation <b>of</b> <b>penalty,</b> {{on the one}} hand, and sanction on the other, as 'penal symbolism'. This term refers to penalization which reflects the ties between crime and punishment by copying crime in terms of modus or place <b>of</b> <b>execution,</b> or by 'punishing' those body parts which partook in committing a crime. The author classifies the examples of preserved judgments and legislations containing penal symbolism to those referring to modus or place <b>of</b> <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> death <b>penalty,</b> those which are examples of penal symbolism related to other sanctions, and those which are examples of the symbolic talion. The author raises the questions {{of the origin of}} this phenomenon, as well as of its justification, and aims at providing answers by reconstructing legal and social framework of Serbia {{in the first half of}} the 19 th century. With this objective in mind, she discusses the development of Criminal Law and its basic features, as well as the development of judiciary, the systematic institutionalization of the network of criminal courts, and, especially, the composition thereof. In the conclusion, the author rejects the possibility that penal symbolism is a product of legal transplantation or that of the continuity of Serbian medieval law. She asserts that the scarcity of material criminal law sources led to judging by 'justice and fairness', and that those facts created conditions for the primitive sense of justice to find its way into judgments and legislations as penal symbolism...|$|R
