25|$|The <b>Jean</b> <b>Monnet</b> House {{is located}} in Houjarray, Yvelines, 80 {{kilometers}} (50 miles) outside of Paris. This old farm became <b>Jean</b> <b>Monnet’s</b> property in 1945, upon his return to France. It is even here that <b>Jean</b> <b>Monnet</b> and his advisors, {{in the last days}} of April 1950, drew up the historic declaration that Robert Schuman used to address Europe on 9 May 1950, proposing the creation of the CECA (European Coal and Steel Community) as well as creating the basis of the European Community. In his office, Robert Schuman, Walter Hallstein, Paul-Henri Spaak, Konrad Adenauer, René Pleven, Helmut Schmidt, and many others exchanged their views with <b>Jean</b> <b>Monnet</b> on our common future. On Sundays, he had friends passing by come to his house; among them were Dwight Eisenhower, George Ball, and Edward Heath. He liked fireside conversations with famous journalists such as Walter Lippman, Hubert Beuve-Méry, or his neighbor Pierre Viansson-Ponté. This house was also where <b>Jean</b> <b>Monnet</b> died on 16 March 1979. In 1982, even though the house had deteriorated {{because of a lack of}} upkeep, the European Parliament considered Monnet’s home to be a symbolic place loaded with memories, thus being common heritage for Europeans. The Parliament acquired it and entrusted its reconstitution, management, and organization to the <b>Jean</b> <b>Monnet</b> Association. Since 2000, a multimedia conference room has welcomed bigger groups of visitors. The <b>Jean</b> <b>Monnet</b> Association team organizes about 250 conferences on European history and current events each year.|$|R
