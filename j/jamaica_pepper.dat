This importation consists chiefly of sugars and tobacco, of which the consumption in Great Britain is scarcely to be conceived of, besides the consumption of cotton, indigo, rice, ginger, pimento or <b>Jamaica</b> <b>pepper,</b> cocoa or chocolate, rum and molasses, train-oil, salt-fish, whale-fin, all sorts of furs, abundance of valuable drugs, pitch, tar, turpentine, deals, masts, and timber, and many other things of smaller value; all which, besides the employing a very great number of ships and English seamen, occasion again a very great exportation of our own manufactures of all sorts to those colonies; which being circulated again for consumption there, that circulation is to be accounted a branch of home or inland trade, as those colonies are on all such occasions esteemed as a branch of part of ourselves, and of the British government in the world.|$|E

60|$|This Clash {{itself is}} the one picturesque and novel feature of our {{otherwise}} somewhat prosaic and machine-made epoch; and, therefore, it has been eagerly seized upon, with one accord, by all the chief purveyors of recent literature, and especially of fiction. They have espied in it, with technical instinct, the best chance for obtaining that fresh interest which {{is essential to the}} success of a work of art. We were all getting somewhat tired, it must be confessed, of the old places and the old themes. The insipid loves of Anthony Trollope's blameless young people were beginning to pall upon us. The jaded palate of the Anglo-Celtic race pined for something hot, with a touch of fresh spice in it. It demanded curried fowl and <b>Jamaica</b> <b>peppers.</b> Hence, on the one hand, the sudden vogue of the novelists of the younger countries--Tolstoi and Tourgenieff, Ibsen and Bjornson, Mary Wilkins and Howells--who transplanted us at once into fresh scenes, new people: hence, on the other hand, the tendency on the part of our own latest writers--the Stevensons, the Hall Caines, the Marion Crawfords, the Rider Haggards--to go far afield among the lower races or the later civilisations for the themes of their romances.|$|R

The factors responsible for the pathogenesis of American foulbrood disease are still not fully understood, and the increasing resistance of P. larvae to commonly used antibiotics necessitates a search for new agents to control this disease. The in vitro antibacterial activities of 28 plant essential oils against P. larvae ATCC 9545 were evaluated. Out of the 28 plant essential oils tested, 20 were found to be effective in killing P. larvae. Based on their minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) values, the effective oils were grouped into three categories: highly effective, moderately effective and minimally effective. <b>Jamaica</b> <b>pepper</b> oil, mountain pepper oil, ajwain oil, corn mint oil, spearmint oil, star anise oil, nutmeg oil and camphor oil were highly effective, with MBC values between 162. 0 and 375. 0 µg/mL. <b>Jamaica</b> <b>pepper</b> oil was the most effective essential oil, with an MBC value of 162. 0 µg/mL. The results of the time-response effect assays showed that no viable P. larvae cells were observed after 24  h of treatment with <b>Jamaica</b> <b>pepper</b> oil (162. 0 µg/mL), 36  h of treatment with mountain pepper oil (186. 0 µg/mL), 48  h of treatment with ajwain oil (224. 8 µg/mL) or 48  h of treatment with oxytetracycline (5. 89 µg/mL). The tested essential oils exhibited significant antimicrobial activities against P. larvae, and they may contain compounds that could play an important role in the treatment or prevention of American foulbrood disease...|$|E
