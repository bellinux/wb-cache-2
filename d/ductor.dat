Small groups of adult females have been seen in deep water. Individual silvertip sharks behave very aggressively towards one another, and many are heavily scarred. They are also reported to dominate Galapagos sharks (C. galapagensis) and blacktip sharks (C. limbatus) of equal size when competing for food. This shark sometimes forms mixed-species aggregations with grey reef sharks. Rainbow runners (Elagatis bipinnulata) have been observed rubbing against silvertip sharks, using the sharks' rough skin to scrape off parasites.

The case of magnesium diboride, which is the conventional superconductor with the highest critical temperature, is discussed in detail. Once the effect of the substrate is considered, we still observe quantum size effects such as the oscillation of the critical temperature with the thickness but without a significant enhancement of superconductivity. In thin films with a sufficiently longer superconducting coherence length, it is, however, possible to increase the critical temperature above the bulk limit by tuning the film thickness or lateral size.

These tend {{to arrange}} in a triangular flux-line lattice (FLL) which {{is more or less}} perturbed by material inhomogeneities that pin the flux lines, and in high-$T_c$ supercon- <b>ductors</b> (HTSC's) also by thermal fluctuations. Many properties of the FLL are well described by the phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau theory or by the electromagnetic London theory, which treats the vortex core as a singularity. In Nb alloys and HTSC's the FLL is very soft mainly because of the large magnetic penetration depth: The shear modulus of the FLL is thus small and the tilt modulus is dispersive and becomes very small for short distortion wavelength. This softness of the FLL is enhanced further by the pronounced anisotropy and layered structure of HTSC's, which strongly increases the penetration depth for currents along the c-axis of these uniaxial crystals and may even cause a decoupling of two-dimensional vortex lattices in the Cu-O layers. Thermal fluctuations and softening may melt the FLL and cause thermally activated depinning of the flux lines or of the 2 D pancake vortices in the layers. Various phase transitions are predicted for the FLL in layered HTSC's. The linear and nonlinear magnetic response of HTSC's gives rise to interesting effects which strongly depend on the geometry of the experiment. Comment: Review paper for Rep. Prog.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The gluteus medius and minimus mus des were {{transferred}} in twenty-six patients (forty-two hips) with spastic cerebral palsy. The {{transfer of the}} in sertion of these muscles from the greater trochanter to the anterior part of the femur was done to change their function from that of inward rotators to that of out ward rotators of the hip. In the follow-up period, rang ing from three to eleven years, the transferred muscles functioned as outward rotators without sacrificing their abduction strength in 90 per cent of the patients. The failures were due primarily to lack of integrity of the transferred muscle insertion. No increase in valgus angulation of the femoral neck was recorded except when {{the integrity of the}} trochanteric apophysis had been compromised. Additionally, in ten patients (thir teen hips) who were operated on when they were from five to eight years old and were followed to skeletal maturity, the angle of anteversion was reduced to at least 25 degrees (range, 18 to 36 degrees). This proce dure is indicated in the patient with spastic cerebral palsy to correct an inward-rotation gait caused by hyperexcitable gluteus medius and minimus muscles. It has been useful in eliminating the problems of clumsi ness on running and walking associated with tripping, falling, fatigability, and excessive shoe-wear without compromising the abduction power of the gluteus medius and minimus. Advancement of the gluteus medius and minimus in sertion has as its goal correction of the inward-rotation gait of the cerebral palsy patient without sacrificing abduction strength. The operation is designed to convert the gluteus medius and minimus muscles from inward rotators to out ward rotators.

40|$|The {{field of}} shape {{optimization}} problems {{has received a}} lot of attention in recent years, particularly in relation to a number of applications in physics and engineering that require a focus on shapes instead of parameters or functions. In general for ap- plications the aim is to deform and modify the admissible shapes in order to optimize a given cost function. The fascinating feature is that the variables are shapes, i. e., domains of R^d, instead of functions. This choice often produces additional dicul- ties for the existence of a classical solution (that is an optimizing domain) and the introduction of suitable relaxed formulation of the problem is needed {{in order to get a}} solution which is in this case a measure. However, we may obtain a classical solution by imposing some geometrical constraint on the class of competing domains or requiring the cost functional verifies some particular conditions. The shape optimization problem is in general an optimization problem of the form min{F(Î©) : Î©â O}; where F is a given cost functional and O a class of domains in R^d. They are many books written on shape optimization problems. The thesis is organized as follows: the first chapter is dedicated to a brief introduction and presentation of some examples. In Academic examples, we present the isoperimetric problems, minimal and capillary surface problems and the spectral optimization problems while in applied examples the Newton's problem of optimal aerodinamical profile and optimal mixture of two con- <b>ductors</b> are considered. The second chapter is concerned with some basics elements of geometric measure theory that will be used in the sequel. After recalling some notions of abstract measure theory, we deal with the Hausdorff measures which are important for defining the notion of approximate tangent space. Finally we introduce the notion of approximate tangent space to a measure and to a set and also some differential op- erators like tangential differential, tangential gradient and tangential divergence. The third chapter is devoted to the topologies on the set of domains in R^d. Three topologies induced by convergence of domains are presented namely the convergence of charac- teristic functions, the convergence in the sense of Hausdorff and the convergence in the sense of compacts as well as the relationship between those different topologies. In the fourth chapter we present a shape optimization problem governed by linear state equations. After dealing with the continuity of the solution of the Laplacian problem with respect to the domain variation (including counter-examples to the continuity and the introduction to a new topology: the gamma-convergence), we analyse the existence of optimal shapes and the necessary condition of optimality in the case where an optimal shape exists. The shape optimization problems governed by nonlinear state equations are treated in chapter ve. The plan of study is the same as in chapter four that is continuity with respect to the domain variation of the solution of the p-Laplacian problem (and more general operator in divergence form), the existence of optimal shapes and the necessary condition of optimality in the case where an optimal shape exists. The last chapter deals with asymptotical shapes. After recalling the notion of Gamma-convergence, we study the asymptotic of the compliance functional in different situations. First we study the asymptotic of an optimal p-compliance-networks which is the compliance associated to p-Laplacian problem with control variables running in the class of one dimensional closed connected sets with assigned length. We provide also the connection with other asymptotic problems like the average distance problem. The asymptotic of the p-compliance-location which deal with the compliance associ- atied to the p-Laplacian problem with control variables running in the class of sets of finite numbers of points, is deduced from the study of the asymptotic of p-compliance- networks. Secondly we study the asymptotic of an optimal compliance-location. In this case we deal with the compliance associated to the classical Laplacian problem and the class of control variables is the class of identics n balls with radius depending on n and with fixed capacity...|$|R
40|$|The {{topic of}} this thesis is vortex-physics in multi {{component}} Ginzburg- Landau models. These models describe a newly discovered class of super- conductors with multiple superconducting gaps, and possess many properties that set {{them apart from}} single component models. The work presented here relies on large scale computer simulations using various numerical techniques, but also on some analytical methods. In Paper I, Type- 1. 5 Superconducting State from an Intrinsic Proximity Effect in Two-Band Superconductors, we show that in multiband supercon- <b>ductors,</b> even an extremely small interband proximity effect {{can lead to a}} qualitative change in the interaction potential between superconducting vor- tices, by producing long-range intervortex attraction. This type of vortex interaction results in an unusual response to low magnetic fields, leading to phase separation into domains of two-component Meissner states and vortex droplets. In paper II, Type- 1. 5 superconductivity in two-band systems, we discuss the influence of Josephson coupling and show that non-monotonic intervortex interaction can also arise in two-band superconductors where one of the bands is proximity induced by Josephson interband coupling. In paper III, Type- 1. 5 superconductivity in multiband systems: Effects of interband couplings, we investigate the appearance of Type- 1. 5 superconduc- tivity in the case with two active bands and substantial inter-band couplings such as intrinsic Josephson coupling, mixed gradient coupling, and density- density interactions. We show that in the presence of these interactions, the system supports type- 1. 5 superconductivity with fundamental length scales being associated with the mass of the gauge field and two masses of normal modes represented by linear combinations of the density fields. In paper IV, Semi-Meissner state and nonpairwise intervortex interactions in type- 1. 5 superconductors, we demonstrate the existence of nonpairwise in- tervortex forces in multicomponent and layered superconducting systems. We also consider the properties of vortex clusters in a semi-Meissner state of type- 1. 5 two-component superconductors. We show that under certain conditions nonpairwise forces can contribute to the formation of complex vortex states in type- 1. 5 regimes. In paper V, Length scales, collective modes, and type- 1. 5 regimes in three- band superconductors, we consider systems where frustration in phase dif- ferences occur due to competing Josephson inter-band coupling terms. We show that gradients of densities and phase differences can be inextricably intertwined in vortex excitations in three-band models. This can lead to long-range attractive intervortex interactions and the appearance of type- 1. 5 regimes even when the intercomponent Josephson coupling is large. We also show that field-induced vortices can lead to a change of broken symmetry from U (1) to U (1) â¥ Z 2 in the system. In the type- 1. 5 regime, it results in a semi-Meissner state where the system has a macroscopic phase separation in domainswithbrokenU(1) andU(1) â¥Z 2 symmetries. In paper VI, Topological Solitons in Three-Band Superconductors with Broken Time Reversal Symmetry, we show that three-band superconductors with broken time reversal symmetry allow magnetic flux-carrying stable topo- logical solitons. They can be induced by fluctuations or quenching the system through a phase transition. It can provide an experimental signature of the time reversal symmetry breakdown. In paper VII, Type- 1. 5 superconductivity in multiband systems: Magnetic response, broken symmetries and microscopic theory â A brief overview, we give an overview of vortex physics and magnetic response in multi component Ginzburg-Landau theory. We also examine Type- 1. 5 superconductivity in the context of microscopic theory. In paper VIII, Chiral CP 2 skyrmions in three-band superconductors, we show that under certain conditions, three-component superconductors (and, in particular, three-band systems) allow stable topological defects different from vortices. We demonstrate the existence of these excitations, charac- terised by a CP 2 topological invariant, in models for three-component super- conductors with broken time-reversal symmetry. We term these topological defects âchiral GL(3) skyrmions,â where âchiralâ refers to the fact that due to broken time-reversal symmetry, these defects come in inequivalent left- and right-handed versions. In certain cases, these objects are energetically cheaper than vortices and should be induced by an applied magnetic field. In other situations, these skyrmions are metastable states, which can be produced by a quench. Observation of these defects can signal broken time-reversal sym- metry in three-band superconductors or in Josephson-coupled bilayers of sÂ± and s-wave superconductors. In paper IX, Phase transition in multi-component superconductors, we ex- amine the thermodynamics of frustrated multi-components superconductors and show that their highly complex energy landscape can give rise new types of phase transitions not present in single component superconductors.
