A consideration of material presented here suggests that such descriptions may not indicate the presence of stratospheric aerosols emitted in massive volcanic eruptions, which may be capable of affecting hemispheric climate for several years. Such descriptions may instead record the concentration of volcanic gases in the lower atmosphere from relatively minor, climatically ineffective but environmentally significant, volcanic eruptions.

Medieval chronicles say that in 1258 the summer was cold and rainy, resulting in floods and bad harvests, with cold lasting from February to June. In both Europe and the Middle East, changes in atmospheric colours, storms, cold and severe weather were reported in 1258-1259. In Europe, too much rain damaged crops and caused famines followed by epidemics. Reports {{of the effects of the}} eruption, including failure of crops and famine as well as weather changes, exist for northwest Europe. Crop failures, and a famine in London have been linked to this event. Witnesses reported a death toll of 15,000 to 20,000 in London.A mass burial of famine victims was found in the 1990s in the centre of London. Matthew Paris of St Albans retells how until mid-August in 1258, the weather alternated between cold and strong rain, causing high mortality. Swollen and rotting in groups of five or six, the dead lay abandoned in pigsties, on dunghills, and in the muddy streets. [...] The resulting famine was severe enough that grain was imported from Germany and Holland. The price for cereal increased in Britain, France and Italy. Outbreaks of disease occurred during this time in the Middle East and England. With and after winter 1258-1259, exceptional weathers were reported less commonly, but the winter 1260-1261 was very severe in Iceland, Italy and elsewhere.|$|E

40|$|In {{the year}} 1783 a fissure {{eruption}} from Laki {{in the southern}} part of Iceland produced a large amount of volcanic gases during a period of eight months. The volcanic gases and aerosols spread across the northern hem sphere due to ideal weather conditions and had a substantial impact on the environment, human health and also climate effects. This, so called <b>dry</b> <b>fog,</b> caused severe health problems, which led to death casualties, killing animals, crops and other vegetation. The consequence was a widespread famine which was aggravated by a hard and long winter in 1783 / 84. Analysis shows that the Icelandic volcanoes are the primary risk to produce <b>dry</b> <b>fog</b> that can affect Sweden. The fog will most likely cause severe health effects, such as respiratory and cardiovascular problems. It will also cause damage to the vegetation, especially coniferous trees, and it may affect the water by acid chock. The fog may have great impact on the critical infrastructure in Sweden, depending on magnitude and duration. These types of volcanic hazards are difficult to predict and evaluate due to their sporadic nature and the sparse amount of data that is available.

Subgenus Vermilacinia, which includes 20 species (type: same as for the genus: Vermilacinia combeoides (Nyl.) Spjut & Hale) that grow on rocks (saxicolous) and soil (terricolous), is distinguished by a relatively thick crusty cortex (like a dry pie crust) overlying a medulla with rigid lattice of hyphae. The firmer cortex of subgenus Vermilacinia undoubtedly adds support to the thallus that allows its branches to grow upright from the substrate.|$|R

40|$|In {{the year}} 1783, an unusual fog covered the {{atmosphere}} {{over a large}} part of the Northern Hemisphere, persisting for a period of up to three months. In particular, the summer in Europe was characterized by the appearance of this phenomenon.

This research focuses on the environmental impact of the eruption in Iceland and Europe, and analyzes how contemporaries reacted to its influence and what meaning they derived from it. The event is known to be one of the largest fissure eruptions in historical times. As a result of the volcanic activity, notorious amounts of volcanic gases were released into the atmosphere which formed the infamous fog. In Iceland, the volcanic pollution damaged crops and vegetation, and had a disastrous consequence for livelihood in the country. In that sense, the eruption was one of the primary causes of the Haze Famine of 1783 - 1785, where one-fifth of the Icelandic population perished.

Mid-tropospheric systems, such as the subtropical ridge, deflect tropical cyclones around their periphery and cause a temperature inversion inhibiting free convection near their center, building up surface-based haze under their base.

40|$|Somewhere in the tropics, {{a volcano}} {{exploded}} violently {{during the year}} 1258, producing a massive stratospheric aerosol veil that eventually blanketed the globe. Arctic and Antarctic ice cores suggest {{that this was the}} world's largest volcanic eruption of the past millennium. According to contemporary chronicles, the stratospheric <b>dry</b> <b>fog</b> possibly manifested itself in Europe as a persistently cloudy aspect of the sky and also through an apparently total darkening of the eclipsed Moon. Based on a sudden temperature drop for several months in England, the eruption's initiation date can be inferred to have been probably January 1258. The frequent cold and rain that year led to severe crop damage and famine throughout much of Europe. Pestilence repeatedly broke out in 1258 and 1259; it occurred also in the Middle East, reportedly there as plague. Another very cold winter followed in 1260 - 1261. The troubled period's wars, famines, pestilences, and earthquakes appear to have contributed in part to the rise of the European flagellant movement of 1260, one of the most bizarre social phenomena of the Middle Ages. Analogies can be drawn with the climatic aftereffects and European social unrest following another great tropical eruption, Tambora in 1815.

Our study tested NS efficacy in disinfecting a 45 m 3 room (without aeration) contaminated with increasing concentrations of ATCC bacterial strains (Staphylococcus aureus 29213, Escherichia coli 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 27853, Enterococcus faecalis 29212). Methods: Volumes of bacterial suspensions at different concentrations (104, 105, 106 CFU/ml) were distributed with a sterile spatula on selected surfaces (area 50 - 200 cm 2) : floor, wall, doorway, counters, and shelves. Thereafter, the room was treated with NS, delivering NOCOLYSE® for 3 ’ at the highest concentration (4 ml/m 3). After 30 ’ the surfaces were brushed with moistened sterile swabs, that were immediately inoculated on blood agar plates (bioMérieux, Marcy l’Etoile, France). Results: After aerobically incubation at 35 °C for 18 - 24 h, bacterial grown measured as total colony numbers was significantly lower than controls. In case of low inocula, bacterial grown was 100 % inhibited on floors, counters and shelves, whereas this percentage dropped to 80 % with an inoculum of 106 CFU/ml. On walls and door the percentage of reduction of bacterial contamination was 100 % regardless of the initial bacterial number. Conclusions: Our data confirm the efficacy of NS to determine eradication for low bacterial inocula and significant reduction when using high concentrations, allowing to appreciate the real decrease of surface contamination at different inocula...|$|E
