This paper evaluates three open-source {{static analysis}} tools; Flawfinder, Cppcheck and Yasca. Each tool is analyzed {{with regards to}} usability, IDE integration, performance, and accuracy. Special {{emphasis is placed on}} the integration of these tools into the development environment to enable analysis during all phases of development as well as to enable <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> and other improvements within the tools. It is shown that Flawfinder be the easiest to modify and extend, Cppcheck be inviting to novices, and Yasca be the most accurate and versatile...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Variables make {{rule-based}} systems {{more abstract}} and expressive, as witnessed by term rewriting systems and two-level grammars. In this paper {{we show that}} variables {{can be used to}} define advanced ways of graph transformation as well. Taking the gluing approach to graph transformation [7, 3] as a basis, we consider <b>extensions</b> <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> with attribute variables, clone variables, and graph variables, respectively. In each case, the variables in a rule are instantiated in order to obtain a set <b>of</b> <b>rule</b> instances that in turn defines the transformation relation. By combining different kinds of variables, we define very expressive rules, and reduce them to plain rules by instantiation. Since gluing graph transformation has a well developed theory, this opens the door to lift results of that theory from instances to rules with variables. ...|$|R

40|$|We analyze {{bargaining}} {{situations where}} the agents' payoffs from disagreement depend on who among them breaks down the negotiations. We model such problems as a superset of the standard domain of Nash (1950). We first show that this domain extension creates {{a very large number}} <b>of</b> new <b>rules.</b> In particular, decomposable <b>rules</b> (which are <b>extensions</b> <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> from the Nash domain) constitute a nowhere dense subset <b>of</b> all possible <b>rules.</b> For them, we analyze the process through which "good" properties <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> on the Nash domain extend to ours. We then enquire whether the counterparts of some well-known results on the Nash (1950) domain continue to hold for decomposable rules on our extended domain. We first show that an <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> the Kalai-Smorodinsky bargaining rule uniquely satisfies the Kalai and Smorodinsky (1975) properties. This uniqueness result, however, turns out to be an exception. We characterize the uncountably large classes <b>of</b> decomposable <b>rules</b> that survive the Nash (1950), Kalai (1977), and Thomson (1981) properties. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{two kinds}} of refinement relations between graph transformation systems. In a spatial refinement each <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> the first system is refined by an amalgamation <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> the second system, in a temporal refinement it is refined by a sequence <b>of</b> <b>rules.</b> Types for graph transformation systems are used as a structuring means that allows uniform restrictions and <b>extensions</b> <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> and derivations.

The background of these investigations {{is the development of}} a module concept for graph transformation systems, with export and import interfaces, and a body implementing the services offered at the export interface. 1 Introduction Module concepts for algebraic specifications have been introduced to allow modularization as known from programming languages also for formal specification (see e. g.
