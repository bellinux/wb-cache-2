However, the concept of a <b>floor</b> <b>limit</b> may still come into play in certain cases. A few merchants still use the older system of taking a physical imprint of the card.

40|$|We use {{transactions}} data {{to explore}} the magnet effects of price limit rules on the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SHSE). When limit hits are imminent, stock prices are found to approach the price limits at faster rates, with higher trading intensity and larger price variation, supporting the magnet effect hypothesis of Subrahmanyam [Subrahmanyam, A., 1994.

Moreover, when stock prices approach the <b>floor</b> <b>limits,</b> we observe lower than normal market conditions' trading volume and trade size but a wider spread. The panic selling psychology of individual investors for fear of illiquidity and the strategic trading decisions of discretionary traders during periods prior to price limit hits at the floors are conjectured as possible explanations for the observed price behaviors.

40|$|Credit card fraud losses {{within the}} South African credit card market in 2006 {{exceeded}} R 257 M. A portion of these losses (R 179 M) {{are within the}} borders of South Africa and its common monetary area partners. This represents a startling 70 % of credit card fraud on magnetic stripe cards used within the borders of South Africa. The South African credit card industry adopts floor limits at certain merchants and merchant categories. South Africa {{is one of a}} few countries in the world that still adopt floor limits on credit cards within its payment card industry. Credit card transactions on magnetic-stripe cards conducted below the merchant’s designated <b>floor</b> <b>limit</b> do not go to the issuing bank for authorization. The first time the issuing bank acknowledges these transactions is when they are settled on average two days later. The rationale for not adopting zero floor limits within the South African credit card market is the supposed inability of the existing telecommunications infrastructure to handle the volume and frequency of data submitted by merchants for authorization. The impact of reduced fraud and bad debt losses through adopting a zero <b>floor</b> <b>limit</b> in relation to merchant operational costs is the basis of the research. The research also aims to examine the Proposition that the existing telecommunications infrastructure is unable to support a zero <b>floor</b> <b>limit</b> proposal...|$|E

40|$|The Low-Background Infrared (LBIR) Facility at The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is {{interested}} in making ~ 1 pW absolute IR power measurements with 0. 1 % uncertainty. Given {{that there are no}} commercially available Absolute Cryogenic Radiometer (ACR) controllers that operate in this power regime, the LBIR Facility investigated the use of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) electronics components, such as AC resistance bridges and tabletop voltmeters, to develop a research-grade ACR controller with an open architecture that could be configured and tuned to operate at lower power levels than commercial controllers. Last year at CALCON we presented the preliminary results of this project and showed that an electronics control system that was made of COTS components could be used for optical power measurements down to a noise floor of ~ 16 pW. This noise floor was the limit of both the commercial ACR control electronics and the optical receiver cavity that was used as the optical sensor for the testing. In order to improve the testing of the COTS ACR electronics, a new receiver cavity was made with ~ 30 times greater optical signal responsivity and a heater resistor with ~ 70 times greater resistance for improved electrical power measurement. In addition, this year LBIR has acquired the latest model commercial ACR control electronics which has a noise floor that is ~ 10 times lower. In this presentation we will discuss the low noise <b>floor</b> <b>limit</b> of the COTS ACR electronics when combined with the higher sensitivity receiver cavity and compare the power measurement accuracy of the COTS ACR electronics with those from the latest model commercial ACR electronics...|$|E
40|$|The first direct {{detection}} {{of dark matter}} is anticipated in coming years by one {{of a range of}} experimental strategies. Because the identity of dark matter remains unknown, the strategy that will be successful in this one cannot say. However beneath this fundamental particle physics uncertainty lies another uncertainty with regard to the structure of the dark matter halo of the Milky Way that must be confronted when interpreting data from terrestrial experiments. However these astrophysical uncertainties might only be resolved with the very same experiments; in fact, directly detecting dark matter represents the only way to probe the ultralocal structure of the halo. This thesis explores the impact of astrophysical uncertainties on the particle physics goals of dark matter detection but also the extent to which we might in the future be able to resolve those uncertainties. The discussion is framed around the {{detection of}} three types of particle, two of which are dark matter candidates: weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), neutrinos and axions. In the case of WIMPs I consider how upcoming directionally sensitive experiments can be used to probe the full 3 -dimensional velocity distribution to learn about dark matter substructure. A range of model dependent and independent statistical approaches are tested under various astrophysical benchmarks. I also explore prospects for WIMP direct detection when faced with the ultimate neutrino background, as expected in the next generation of experiment. In this eventuality the uncertainties in the neutrino flux are essential in predicting the WIMP models inaccessible due to the background. However {{the same is true of}} astrophysical uncertainties. Once astrophysical uncertainties are accounted for the neutrino <b>floor</b> <b>limit</b> is raised in cross section by up to an order of magnitude and the accuracy of any potential WIMP particle measurement is greatly increased. Addressing these concerns, I demonstrate how one should go about subtracting the neutrino background. This involves a return to directional detection. I find that even non-ideal circumstances, the neutrino and WIMP signals can be distinguished and the neutrino floor overcome. Finally in the context of axions, I discuss the prospects for microwave cavity haloscope experiments to perform "axion astronomy". Haloscopes measure the direct conversion of axions into photons and hence can make potentially much finer measurements of the dark matter halo compared with WIMPs. I develop a technique to extract astrophysical parameters, such as the halo velocity dispersion and laboratory velocity, as well as learn about properties of substructure from tidal streams and axion miniclusters. I show that a level of precision can be achieved in relatively short duration haloscope experiments that can match or improve upon that of astronomical observations...|$|E
