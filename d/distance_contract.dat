It {{focuses on the}} phenomenon of commercial terms and conditions, their unilateral changes, the adhesion method of negotiating contracts and related customer protection against the abuse of standardization and simplification {{of the process of}} negotiation and conclusion of contract amendments. The second part focuses on the process of concluding a <b>distance</b> <b>contract</b> with a consumer and it discusses the different phases of the process of concluding agreements and the practice of deviation from standard procedures foreseen by law on a practical example of an e-shop. The aim is to evaluate the current legal situation and its development regarding to the transposed European directives and adumbrate the interpretation of certain provisions...|$|E
30|$|The second {{article by}} Martin Abraham, Katrin Auspurg, Sebastian Bähr, Corinna Frodermann, Stefanie Gundert and Thomas Hinz {{utilizes}} an innovative feature of PASS: In wave 5 {{of the panel}} survey a factorial survey module was implemented. It was conceptualized by Martin Abraham, Katrin Auspurg and Thomas Hinz and successfully proposed within the yearly PASS call for questionnaire modules. It is a fruitful example of combining survey research with experimental research. By confronting respondents with randomized stimuli—in this special case job offers with eight randomized traits—it overcomes {{one of the main}} weaknesses of survey designs: The “treatment” under scrutiny is in this case not confounded with a set of other measured and unmeasured variables that additionally influence the outcome. The paper investigates how different dimensions of the quality of a job offer (e.g. income, commuting <b>distance,</b> <b>contract</b> duration) influence the stated willingness to accept job offers. It focuses on differences between the employed and unemployed with respect to this willingness and on inter-regional mobility. While it makes use of only the most recent panel wave (wave 5) it still serves as {{a good example of how}} the innovative design of PASS can be used in labour market sociology.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyse the legislation, doctrinal {{opinions}} and relevant case law regarding the consumer's right of withdrawal from contracts concluded by electronic means (e-contracts). The objectives pursued by the author are:- establishing the juridical nature of consumer's right of withdrawal from e-contracts;- identification of problems that could arise from law’s interpretation,- issuing of the de lege ferenda proposals. Governmental Ordinance no. 130 / 2000 introduces a new exception to the principle of irrevocability of contracts in Romanian law: the consumer's right of withdrawal from distance contracts. The same Ordinance sets the scope and conditions for the applicability of this right. Consumer's right of withdrawal from e-contracts, as a type of distance contracts, can be exercised without the need to give any specific reason and without penalties, within 10 working days from the date of receiving the goods or from the another moment depending on the specifics set out in GO no. 130 / 2000. If consumer cancels the <b>distance</b> <b>contract</b> on the basis that he does not like the goods, the withdrawal from the contract is valid, even if the withdrawal solely depended on the will of the consumer, this sets out a legal exception from the provisions of art. 1010 of Civil Code which stipulate the nullity of the obligations undertook by the liable person under the condition “if I want”. Sales of goods by electronic means, as a particular case of a distance contracts, is, therefore, a new form of selling, governed by its own specific legal regime...|$|E

40|$|Research into {{sustainable}} distribution {{has largely}} focussed on improving {{the delivery of}} products through the supply chain from manufacturer to end customer by developing fundamental understanding of the various supply chain operations at work in urban centres. The logistics activities associated {{with the return of}} damaged, unsold or returned consumer products back up the supply chain, and the consolidation, handling and disposal of waste products that may result, is becoming of increasing interest in the drive to reduce costs and maximise efficiency within the distribution sector. With the introduction of the EC Directives on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) (2002 / 96 /EC), the Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances (RoHS) in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (2002 / 95 /EC), and Packaging and Packaging Waste (94 / 62 /EC), the onus is on retailers and manufacturers to reduce their waste output and better manage their respective logistics operations in this area by participating in specific waste take-back schemes. The need to effectively manage product returns as part of the supply chain process has become more pronounced since the introduction of the Directive on <b>Distance</b> <b>Contract</b> (97 / 7 /EC), which stipulates that anyone who makes a purchase via the Internet, telephone, fax or mail order is able to change their mind during a ‘cooling-off’ period of seven working days after the goods have been received with no explanation for their return being required. Under this backdrop of increasingly liberal returns policies coupled with a ‘throw away’ consumer culture, the extent to which product returns contribute to increasing waste and recyclate generation needs to be explored. With a variety of centralised and decentralised supply chain mechanisms being employed to service retailers, there is potential scope for co-ordinating reverse processes to both reduce collective transport impacts and maximise re-use value from the recyclate generated. <br/...|$|E
40|$|With the {{expansion}} of global communication the commercial world has changed its proceedings. The Internet has {{played a crucial role}} in the development of new ways of doing business, by creating a major global market. E-commerce is one of the main subjects discussed in legal environments last years. The need to develop legal elaboration with the same pace as the technology innovation brought a legal revolution in electronic commerce. In Albania the elements of this revolution switched sides: the legal regulation came before the practical usage. The Albanian legislation has responded to this inclination by creating a complete legal framework regarding electronic commerce. One of the most important legal aspects of the electronic revolution is the development of <b>distance</b> <b>contracts.</b> <b>Distance</b> <b>contracts</b> have the same legal validity as the traditional paper contracts, but as we will show the implementation in practice of this principle is by all means more complicated. Information technology is becoming one of the most influencing factors in the global economy structure, so its development will inevitably help Albania in having a smoother transition. In this paper after a theoretical discussion of <b>distance</b> <b>contracts</b> and their legal validity we aim to investigate the way in which information technology regarding electronic documents and especially electronic signature, influences the development of new ways of contracting, with a special focus regarding the increase of public trust in these innovations...|$|R

40|$|The {{understanding}} of the negative thermal expansion (NTE) mechanism remains challenging but critical {{for the development of}} NTE materials. This study sheds light on NTE of ScF 3, one of the most outstanding materials with NTE. The local dynamics of ScF 3 has been investigated by a combined analysis of synchrotron-based X-ray total scattering, extended X-ray absorption fine structure, and neutron powder diffraction. Very interestingly, we observe that (i) the Sc−F nearest-neighbor distance strongly expands with increasing temperature, while the Sc−Sc next-nearest-neighbor <b>distance</b> <b>contracts,</b> (ii) the thermal ellipsoids of relative vibrations between Sc−F nearest-neighbors are highly elongated in the direction perpendicular to the Sc−F bond, indicating that the Sc−F bond is much softer to bend than to stretch, and (iii) there is mainly dynamically transverse motion of fluorine atoms, rather than static shifts. These results are direct experimental evidence for the NTE mechanism, in which the rigid unit is not necessary for the occurrence of NTE, and the key role is played by the transverse thermal vibrations of fluorine atoms through the “guitar-string” effect...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} has highlighted the significance and {{the complexity of}} the questions linked to the consumer right of withdrawal from <b>distance</b> and off-premises <b>contracts</b> for services: a) such significance is revealed by the spread of service contracts in today’s consumer market and the related growing interest of European institutions for the right of withdrawal as an instrument to offer consumers an adequate protection against ‘aggressive’ practices; b) the complexity lies in the deficient provisions of the consumer code implementing directives 85 / 577 /EEC and 97 / 7 /EC, which compel the lawyer to arduously coordinate the rules derived from the European legal order and those of the domestic legal system. In this context, the central questions dealt with by the researcher concern: 1) Problems of classification of the right of withdrawal within the systematics of the law of obligations. 2) Analysis of the conditions for the exercise of the right of withdrawal in off-premises and <b>distance</b> <b>contracts.</b> 3) Analysis of the contents of the consumer obligations flowing from the exercise of the right of withdrawal. 4) Critical analysis of the provisions of the recent directive 2011 / 83 /EU on consumer rights with regard to the scope, the conditions and the economic and legal consequences of the exercise of the right of withdrawal in distance and off-premises “contracts for services”.

40|$|Quantum {{mechanical}} techniques based on density functional theory {{have been used}} to investigate the mechanism and energetics of proton transport in the perovskite-structured CaZrO 3. The calculations demonstrate that the observed orthorhombic crystal structure (comprised of tilting [ZrO 6] octahedra) is reproduced accurately. Quantum mechanical molecular dynamics simulations confirm that the diffusion mechanism involves proton transfer from one oxygen ion to the next (Grotthuss-type mechanism) and also indicate the importance of the vibrational dynamics of the oxygen sublattice. For each hopping event, the oxygen-oxygen <b>distance</b> <b>contracts</b> to about 2. 4 - 2. 5 Hi so as to assist proton transfer. By exploration of the energy profiles for proton transfer, a very low energy barrier is found for the O(1) -O(1) interoctahedra path. However, long-range proton conduction may involve O(1) -O(2) proton transfer as the rate-limiting step with a calculated energy barrier of 0. 74 eV.

It implies a complete, though “announced”, paradigm shift in EU consumer law from “minimum” to “full harmonization”, while at the same time considerably reducing the protective ambit of prior EC directives against the objectives of Article 153 EC. So far, the proposal seems to be inspired more by the unspecified and unproven belief that the completion of the internal market depends on identical rules in key areas of consumer contract law, such as pre–contractual information, sales law, and unfair terms, while it may only be acceptable in such specific cases as off–the–premises and <b>distance</b> <b>contracts.</b> The paper demonstrates how many open questions will arise the proposal is put onto the EU statute books.

For the dithionite-reduced Azotobacter uinelandii Mo-Fe protein, the dominant EXAFS Fourier transform peaks are assigned to F e 4 and Fe-Fe interactions at- 2. 32 and 2. 64 A, as expected for F e S clusters. An additional Fe-Mo component at 2. 73 A is required to completely fit the EXAFS in the 1 - 3 -A region. In the 3 - 5 -A region, a 3. 8 -A Fe-Fe component is identified, with an amplitude corresponding to almost one long Fe-Fe interaction, averaged over all of the iron in the sample. Features that can be explained as F e S and Fe-Fe interactions at 4. 3 and 4. 7 8, are also observed. A similar pattern of Fe interactions is observed for the reduced A. uinelandii V-Fe protein, except that the short Fe-Mo interaction is no longer required.
