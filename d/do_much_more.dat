Examples include marketing carpool lane stickers, enrolling buyers in charging networks, and preparing incentive paperwork for customers. Some dealers assign seasoned sales people as plug-in experts, many of whom drive plug-ins themselves to learn and be familiar with the technology and relate the carâ€™s benefits to potential buyers. The study concluded also that carmakers could <b>do</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> to support dealers selling PEVs.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{maintained}} {{peace with}} Scotland during his reign, {{where he was}} the feudal lord of Alexander II. Henry assumed that he had the right to interfere in Scottish affairs and brought up the issue of his authority with the Scottish kings at key moments, but he lacked the inclination or the resources to <b>do</b> <b>much</b> <b>more.</b> Alexander had occupied parts of northern England during the First Barons' War but had been excommunicated and forced to retreat. Alexander married Henry's sister Joan in 1221, and after he and Henry signed the Treaty of York in 1237, Henry had a secure northern frontier. Henry knighted Alexander III before the young King married Henry's daughter Margaret in 1251 and, despite Alexander's refusal to give homage to Henry for Scotland, the two enjoyed a good relationship. Henry had Alexander and Margaret rescued from Edinburgh Castle when they were imprisoned there by a rebellious Scottish baron in 1255 and took additional measures to manage Alexander's government during the rest of his minority years.|$|E

Advocates of the society of states are concerned about rogue states and about the imperial ambitions of the powerful. Cosmopolitans believe that the contemporary world badly fails to live up to their standards, and that doing so would require considerable changes in the actions of wealthy individuals and states. It might, for instance, require them to transfer most of their wealth to the poor. It might require the building of international institutions able to limit, or even replace, the self-interested action of powerful states and corporations.

25|$|When {{first-class}} cricket resumed {{after the}} Second World War in the 1946 season, Sinfield had retired and Goddard was 45 years old. But though that gave Cranfield a more reliable {{place in the}} Gloucestershire side, he did not <b>do</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> bowling than before, as Sam Cook emerged as a slow left-arm spin bowler to partner Goddard. In the match against Cambridge University at Gloucester, however, Cranfield took the bowling honours, with eight for 45 from his off breaks in the first Cambridge innings and five for 9 as the university was dismissed for just 34 in the second innings; Cranfield's match figures were 13 wickets for 54 runs and both the first innings and the match figures were {{the best of his}} career. The other seven Cambridge wickets in the match were taken by Cook at a cost of 54 runs also. Those 13 wickets took him to a season total of 47 wickets at the for-him low average of 20.44.|$|E
25|$|In the meantime, Nomura {{was also}} {{responsible}} for the main character designs and orchestration of The World Ends with You for the Nintendo DS. In 2009, {{he was also the}} main character designer of Final Fantasy XIII. The graphics capabilities of the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 compared to previous consoles allowed Nomura to use more complex elements in the character designs than before, such as Lightning's cape and detailed facial features. This in turn meant that the art team had to <b>do</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> work for each character or area than in previous games. Nomura did not take an involved role {{in the creation of the}} non-playable characters. In 2008, he was the character designer of Dissidia Final Fantasy. The game was originally envisioned by Nomura as a Kingdom Hearts spin-off featuring a cast of Disney characters. He later felt uncomfortable with the Disney characters fighting each other and instead opted to use Final Fantasy characters. Nomura was responsible for the character designs, which changed much of the look and style of Amano's illustrations.|$|E

Immediately after the declaration of war, FVdG tried to continue its antiwar demonstrations to no avail. Although it constantly criticized the Burgfrieden and militarism in general, industrial action was not possible {{except for a few}} minor cases (most notably resistance by the carpenters' union to Sunday work). The FVdG also received support from abroad. The faction in the Italian USI led by Armando Borghi, an antimilitarist minority in the French CGT, the Dutch NAS, as well as Spanish, Swedish, and Danish syndicalists were all united with the FVdG in their opposition to the war.|$|E
500|$|Toriyama wanted Lightning to be a {{new type}} of female {{character}} with an athlete's body and a less feminine nature than some of the previous female characters of the series. His guideline to Nomura was to make her [...] "strong and beautiful", and she was intended to be reminiscent of Final Fantasy VIIs Cloud Strife. Fang was initially meant to be a male character, but the gender was changed to coincide with the updated character designs during the latter part of development. The graphics capabilities of the PS3 and Xbox 360 compared to previous consoles allowed Nomura to use more complex elements in the character designs than before, such as Lightning's cape and detailed facial features.

500|$|By {{end of the}} 15th century, several {{technological}} advancements were made, making cannon more mobile. Wheeled gun carriages and trunnions became common, and {{the invention of the}} limber further facilitated the transportation of artillery. As a result, field artillery became viable, and began to emerge, often used alongside the larger cannon intended for sieges. The better gunpowder, improved, cast-iron projectiles, and the standardization of calibers meant that even relatively light cannon could be deadly. In The Art of War, NiccolÃ² Machiavelli observed that [...] "It is true that the arquebuses and the small artillery <b>do</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> harm than the heavy artillery." [...] This was the case at Flodden, in 1513: the English field guns outpaced the Scottish siege artillery, firing twice, or even thrice, as many rounds. Despite the increased maneuverability, however, cannon were still much slower {{than the rest of the}} army: a heavy English cannon required 23 horses to transport, while a culverin, nine, yet, even with this many animals transporting them, they still moved at a walking pace. Due to their relatively slow speed, and lack of organization, discipline, and tactics, the combination of pike and shot still dominated the battlefields of Europe.|$|E
