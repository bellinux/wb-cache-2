Graham Coxon recorded a string of solo albums, while Damon Albarn dedicated his time to Gorillaz, the animated band <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>created</b> with Jamie Hewlett. Alex James worked with Fat Les and co-wrote several songs with Sophie Ellis-Bextor and Marianne Faithfull.|$|E
5|$|Following The Painted Hills in 1951, MGM {{executives}} felt Lassie had run her {{course and}} planned no future films featuring the character. MGM executives then sought {{a way to}} break Weatherwax's contract. Weatherwax was concerned about protecting Pal and the Lassie image <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>created</b> from future diminishment {{at the hands of}} others. In lieu of US$40,000 in back pay owed him by the studio, Weatherwax bargained for and received the Lassie name and trademark.|$|E

5|$|In 1934, Horch {{arranged}} to have Master Institute of United Arts, Inc., the educational corporation <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>created</b> in 1923, take over responsibility for the building from the organization he had previously used to run it. He did this because the Institute was free of debt and, due to its status as an educational organization, was tax-exempt.|$|E
5|$|In 2011 Ne-Yo was {{approached}} by Cartoon Network to help create an animated series. Ne-Yo announced that the show would be titled I Heart Tuesday and that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>created</b> it for his sister. He also stated {{that he wanted to}} avoid having the show resemble the anime art style of The Boondocks due to the potential cost of the show's animation style.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the previous Tintin books, Hergé deliberately broke the adventure formula <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>created.</b> It is the only book in the Tintin series where the characters remain at home in Marlinspike Hall, Captain Haddock's family estate in Belgium, and do not travel abroad or confront dangerous criminals. The plot concerns the visit of the opera singer Bianca Castafiore and the subsequent theft of her emerald.|$|E

5|$|In the {{interest}} of time (the striking of the new coin was to begin in January 1964), Roberts modified the existing bust of Kennedy <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>created</b> for use on the Kennedy medal in the Mint's Presidential series, while Frank Gasparro began modifications to the reverse <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>created</b> for the same medal. Both Roberts' and Gasparro's designs had been approved by Kennedy. Roberts had met with Kennedy in person to show him early models of the design; although the President expressed no opinion regarding the depiction, Roberts decided {{to make some changes}} after meeting him. After the Mint produced trial strikes, Jacqueline and Robert Kennedy were invited to view them. Mrs. Kennedy viewed the designs favorably, but suggested that the hair be altered slightly. It was also suggested that a full or half figure of the president be used instead of the profile, but Roberts noted that there was not enough time to produce an entirely new design because of the project's time constraints, and also that he believed the left profile would give a more attractive appearance.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{music was}} {{composed}} by Tsukasa Masuko, with arrangements by Masuko and Tatsuya Nishiwaki. Masuko considered Shin Megami Tensei {{to be an}} experimental work: {{it was the first}} time <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>created</b> music for the Super Famicom, so he was not familiar with the console's specifications. During composition, he needed to check the specifications repeatedly to see what he could do within the hardware limitations. For the PC Engine port, the music was arranged by Hitoshi Sakimoto.|$|E
5|$|With 1,300 deputies {{still in}} Cripple Creek, Sheriff Bowers {{was unable to}} control the army <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>created.</b> On June 5, the deputies moved into Altman, perhaps {{as a prelude to}} {{storming}} Bull Hill. The deputies cut the telegraph and telephone wires leading out of town, and imprisoned a number of reporters. Concerned that the paramilitary force might get out of hand, Waite again dispatched the state militia, this time under the command of General E.J. Brooks.|$|E

5|$|As soon as {{he arrived}} home, Etty began to work on {{ensuring}} he {{had at least one}} picture ready for the 1824 Summer Exhibition. He decided to return to a theme for which <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>created</b> a sketch in 1820, that of the story of Pandora and in particular the passage in Hesiod in which the seasons crown her with a wreath. He had exhibited a sketch in 1820 on the same theme, and had already decided on the arrangement of the figures. His first attempt in 1824 was abandoned half-finished, and he began again on a smaller canvas with different positioning of the key figures of Pandora, Vulcan and Venus.|$|E
5|$|Blessed be God's name? Why, but {{why would}} I bless Him? Every fiber in me rebelled. Because He caused {{thousands}} of children to burn in His mass graves? Because He kept six crematoria working day and night, including Sabbath and the Holy Days? Because in His great might, <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>created</b> Auschwitz, Birkenau, Buna, {{and so many other}} factories of death? How could I say to Him: Blessed be Thou, Almighty, Master of the Universe, who chose us among all nations to be tortured day and night, to watch as our fathers, our mothers, our brothers end up in the furnaces?...|$|E
5|$|In August 1863, {{as part of}} {{his duties}} as aide-de-camp to General Barnard, Alexander was named {{as a member of a}} board of {{military}} officers who would examine the defenses of Washington and suggest improvements as needed. The board, created by the Secretary of War, Edwin M. Stanton, was designed to replace a civilian board that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>created</b> in 1862. In a November 1863 meeting, this board recommended final allotments of guns and ammunition for the forts protecting Washington, D.C., thus establishing the number of guns that would be in place during the Battle of Fort Stevens eight months later.|$|E

5|$|On 1 August 1931 Heydrich {{began his}} job as chief of the new 'Ic Service' (intelligence service). He set up office at the Brown House, the Nazi Party {{headquarters}} in Munich. By October <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>created</b> a network of spies and informers for intelligence-gathering purposes and to obtain information {{to be used as}} blackmail to further political aims. Information on thousands of people was recorded on index cards and stored at the Brown House. To mark the occasion of Heydrich's December wedding, Himmler promoted him to the rank of SS-Sturmbannführer (major).|$|E
5|$|Rundgren {{had become}} {{confident}} enough at other instruments beyond his standard guitar and keyboards {{that he had}} tackled in earlier releases, and this, coupled with a general dissatisfaction with other studio musicians, led him to temporarily relocate to Los Angeles {{in an attempt to}} record an entire album single-handedly. After <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>created</b> significantly more material than would fit on a standard LP, an earthquake struck LA. He decided to head back to New York for some live sessions, with the help of Moogy Klingman, to lighten the mood. The final sessions were in Bearsville, where the remainder of the recording and mixing took place, and this created enough material for a double album.|$|E
5|$|The {{animated}} film {{was produced by}} Shinkai Creative, CoMix Wave Films, and the producer was Noritaka Kawaguchi. Kenichi Tsuchiya was the animation director and was responsible for character design, while Hiroshi Takiguchi was the art director. Planning for the film began {{in the spring of}} 2012 and was announced on December 24 of that year. The Japanese release was initially slated {{for the first half of}} 2013. Production took only six months, starting with location scouting by Shinkai around Shinjuku. Production officially started after <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>created</b> storyboards based on the photos he took.|$|E

5|$|After Burebista's death, {{the empire}} <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>created</b> {{dissolved}} into smaller kingdoms. From {{the reign of}} Tiberius to Domitian, Dacian activity was reduced into a defensive state. The Romans abandoned plans of mounting an invasion against Dacia. In 86 AD, however, the king Decebalus successfully re-united the Dacian kingdom under his control. Domitian attempted a hasty invasion against the Dacians which ended in disaster. A second invasion later brought peace between Rome and Dacia for nearly a decade, until in 98 AD Trajan became emperor. Trajan also pursued two conquests of Dacia, the first in 101–102 AD which concluded in a Roman victory. Decebalus was forced to agree to harsh terms of peace, but did not honour them. This sparked a second invasion of Dacia in 106 AD which ended {{the independence of the}} Dacian kingdom, and brought about its break-up.|$|E
5|$|At {{one point}} Hideki {{considers}} {{having to take}} on a second job due to his poor financial state. He is eventually able to convince his former employer Hiroyasu Ueda to hire Chi at his bakery during his anniversary sale. Chi eventually finds herself kidnapped by Yoshiyuki Kojima. Yoshiyuki initiates a program that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>created</b> especially for Chi, which is designed to break through her firewalls, and when he embraces and gropes her, Freya intervenes by binding him with wires connected to Chi and releasing a powerful, concussive blast. Hideki and Shinbo find her, and Freya vanishes, causing Chi to collapse from the energy used. She recovers and briefly reunites with Hideki, before losing consciousness. Shinbo then forces Yoshiyuki to transfer his persocom Kotoko's registration to Hideki to prevent Yoshiyuki from deleting her memories, so that a record of his kidnapping exists.|$|E
5|$|For Seiken Densetsu 3, Kikuta was {{assisted}} by a sound programmer, Hidenori Suzuki, which {{allowed him to}} compose over three {{times the amount of}} music <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>created</b> for Secret of Mana. The move to the PlayStation for Soukaigi allowed Kikuta to focus on creating live music for the soundtrack, rather than tweaking the synthesizer instruments to make the music files fit in the game cartridge as he had to for the Super Nintendo. He used the added audio processing power to expand his musical creativity, including pieces such as songs in unintelligible Thai and Malaysian by Japanese singers. The game itself, however, was not a success, and Kikuta decided that he wanted more direct control over the next project he worked on.|$|E
