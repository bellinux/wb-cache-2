For 1914 the car changed over to steel channel frame carried on four semi-elliptic leaf springs. The car had worm and sector steering, and the brakes comprised a pedal operated transmission brake and two hand-lever operated <b>external</b> <b>contracting</b> <b>brakes.</b> The two-seater body had the seats slightly staggered, and the specification included the hood, adjustable windscreen, a boot, mudguards, running boards, and an acetylene lighting set. The engine remained at 970cc and was fitted with an Eisemann magneto and Claudel carburettor. The clutch was a leather lined cone type fitted into the external flywheel. The petrol tank was placed behind the dashboard and fed the carburettor by gravity.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{explores the}} {{productivity}} effects {{of investment in}} <b>external</b> (<b>contract)</b> vs. internal (in-house) R&D {{in a sample of}} West-German Manufacturing Industries. The results provide strong evidence of a positive relationship between productivity and the share of external R&D in total R&D. This result is robust to alternative econometric specifications. Thus, findings suggest that the decision between internal and external R&D does matter. Moreover, results imply a nonlinear relationship between productivity and the share of external R&D for higher-technology industries, hinting at decreasing productivity effects of an increasing share of external in total R&D.

Due {{to the construction of}} new lines between 1906 and 1908, Queensland Railways found it necessary to let <b>external</b> <b>contracts</b> to private firms to build the required additional engines. Between 1909 and 1910, ninety engines were ordered from private firms including the Toowoomba Foundry, and between 1912 and 1913, the Foundry constructed an additional twenty locomotives of the light PB15 class for Queensland Railways. A further fifteen C16 class locomotives were ordered from the Foundry during 1914 -15, one of which survives as part of the Queensland Rail Museum collection at Redbank.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Contract {{enforcement}} {{problems are}} a significant constraint on investment and growth, especially so in developing and transition economies. Evidence on these effects is mostly limited to case studies. This paper analyses the impact of contractual breaches on capital investment, using a unique dataset of Hungarian agricultural enterprises who contract production to processing firms. Contract breaches, under the form of delayed payments for supplied products, have a significant negative effect on investment at the primary production level. They occur more when the expected benefits from breaching are larger, e. g. {{when the price of}} capital is high, and when expected costs are lower, due to poor <b>external</b> <b>contract</b> enforcement or lower private enforcement capital...|$|R
40|$|The {{screening}} {{files of}} many large companies, including Pfizer, have grown considerably due to internal chemistry efforts, company mergers and acquisitions, <b>external</b> <b>contracted</b> synthesis, or compound purchase schemes. In order to screen {{the targets of}} interest in a cost-effective fashion, we devised an easy-to-assemble, plate-based diversity subset (PBDS) that represents almost the entire computed chemical space of the screening file whilst comprising {{only a fraction of}} the plates in the collection. of both library chemistry and legacy chemistry space. This paper describes the rationale, design, construction, and performance of the PBDS, that has evolved into the standard paradigm for singleton (one compound per well) high throughput screening in Pfizer since its introduction in 2006...|$|R
5000|$|It had an {{integral}} chassis/body made largely of plywood, with a tubular frame {{at the rear}} for the engine and transmission. The engine was a rear-mounted, air-cooled (fan-assisted), 10 hp vee-twin engine made by Precision and equipped with a Degory carburettor. Transmission was via a four speed Jardine gearbox. Final drive to the rear axle was by chain, the rear chain tension being adjusted by moving the axle in the frame. A lever offered a combined exhaust lifter and connection by rod to a [...] "kick-starter". As regards the brake and clutch pedals the pivot point can be moved so as to adjust the leverage to suite the driver. The brakes (on two wheels) were of <b>external</b> <b>contracting</b> type.|$|R

40|$|Please do not cite without {{permission}} from the authors. This paper aims to investigate the incentives of German private firms to adopt IFRS voluntarily. Financial statements prepared according to IFRS compared with German GAAP provide readers with higher quality information since managerial discretion in using accounting method choices is restricted and additional disclosures are required under IFRS. Related research based on public companies reports many motivations why firms choose to apply IFRS instead of local GAAP. These public companies switch to IFRS for instance to lower the political costs, to facilitate the monitoring role of stakeholders or to respond to external pressures related to <b>external</b> <b>contracting.</b> Our paper confirms {{to a large extent}} these findings in our sample of German private companies.
