50|$|From the owner's manual:The {{adoption}} of a single-stage differential amplifier with low-noise dual transistors, a current mirror load and a 3-stage Darlington triple SEPP circuit provides a bumper power output of 270 watts + 270 watts (20 Hertz to 20,000 Hertz {{with no more than}} 0.03% THD) which is extremely stable. The power amplifier is configured as a DC power amplifier with the capacitors removed from the NFB circuit for a flat <b>gain</b> <b>response.</b> The large-sized toroidal transformers with their superb regulation employ 22,000 µF large-capacity electrolytic capacitors (two per each channel). There are independent dual power supply circuits with separate power transformer windings to provide power for the left and right channels. The FM front end incorporates a two-stage RF circuit that employs a 5-gang tuning capacitor and three dual gate MOS FETs for high gain and low noise. This configuration excels in ridding the sound of undesirable interference. The FM IF amplifier combines five dual-element ceramic filters…for high selectivity (80 dB) and low distortion… The local oscillator includes Pioneer’s very own quartz sampling locked APC (Automatic Phase Control). This output of this extremely precise quartz oscillator is divided into frequencies of 100 kHz and so reception frequencies which are a multiple of 100 kHz are locked at every 100 kHz.|$|E

It is also shown that the accuracy can be significantly improved using appropriate extrapolation of the relevant expressions and functions at high and low frequencies.

40|$|The UGY 1088 MMIC is {{a device}} which covers all {{push-pull}} applications. Dependent {{on the application}} circuit, the gain can be set between 21 dB and 35 dB power gain with a flat power <b>gain</b> <b>response</b> and excellent input and output return loss over the 40 MHz to 1003 MHz frequency range. It is especially suited for CATV amplifiers. The UGY 1088 is a highly linear, monolithic GaAs RF amplifier that has been developed to replace standard CATV hybrid amplifiers. Offered in a HVQFN 32 surface mount package, the MMIC consists of 3 stages of balanced amplifiers that are optimized for exceptionally low distortion and noise figure. The flat power <b>gain</b> <b>response</b> and excellent input and output return loss over the 40 MHz to 1003 MHz CATV downstream band is formed when one UGY 1088 is cascaded between transmission line baluns.
