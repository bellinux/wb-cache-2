40|$|The use of forward {{models as}} an {{alternative}} approach to compare models with observations contains advantages and challenges. Radar <b>Doppler</b> <b>spectra</b> simulators are not new; their application in high- resolution models with bin microphysics schemes could help to compare model output with the <b>Doppler</b> <b>spectra</b> recorded from the vertically pointing cloud radars at the ARM Climate Research Facility sites. The input parameters to a <b>Doppler</b> <b>spectra</b> simulator are both microphysical (e. g., particle size, shape, phase, and number concentration) and dynamical (e. g., resolved wind components and sub-grid turbulent kinetic energy). Libraries for spherical and non-spherical particles are then used to compute the backscattering cross-section and fall velocities, while the turbulence is parameterized as a Gaussian function with a prescribed width. The Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) is {{used to determine the}} amount of noise added throughout the spectrum, and the spectral smoothing due to spectral averages is included to reproduce the averaging realized by cloud radars on successive returns. Thus, realistic <b>Doppler</b> <b>spectra</b> are obtained, and several parameters that relate to the morphological characteristics of the synthetically generated spectra are computed. Here, the results are compared to the new ARM microARSCL data products in an attempt to validate the simulator. Drizzling data obtained at the SGP site by the MMCR and the AMF site at Azores using the WACR are used to ensure the liquid part and the turbulence representation part of the simulator are properly accounted in the forward model...|$|R
50|$|The Doppler width, or <b>Doppler</b> <b>spectrum</b> width, is the {{standard}} deviation of the spectrum. Accordingly, small values stand for narrow spectra, while higher spectrum width corresponds to a bigger spreading of the hydrometeors over the velocity domain (frequency domain). Reasons for a higher width could be bi- or multiple-modal spectra. This means that the measured volume contains more than one hydrometeor population, which leads to two or more modes in the <b>Doppler</b> <b>spectrum</b> because of the different terminal velocities. A rapid change in Doppler width {{in combination with the}} mean Doppler velocity {{can also be used to}} separate two hydrometeor population.|$|E
50|$|If a <b>Doppler</b> <b>spectrum</b> {{would be}} exactly normal {{distributed}} its kurtosis would be 3. If {{in general the}} kurtosis is positive the spectrum is called leptokurtic, or leptokurtotic.Most known distribution shapes would be those that follow a normal distributed spectra shape. It can be assumed that the <b>Doppler</b> <b>spectrum</b> is dominated by one single particle population {{that leads to a}} strong and narrow peak. If the spectrum has a negative kurtosis it is called platykurtic, or platykurtotic. The shape of such a spectrum has a has lower, wider peak around the mean and thinner tails. Examples of such shapes can be find in the kurtosis wiki entry.|$|E

30|$|Because the estimations of Doppler {{velocity}} and, to {{a greater}} extent, width of <b>Doppler</b> <b>spectra</b> {{are very sensitive to}} contaminations (e.g., ground clutter, airplane echoes, electromagnetic interferences), especially with the moment method, all the <b>Doppler</b> <b>spectra</b> obtained from the six beam directions were edited and carefully corrected manually by replacing contaminated portions of the spectra by an average noise level. The procedure was tedious but necessary, especially for removing the UAV echo contaminations. It was only possible when the UAV echo peak did not overlap the Doppler peak of atmospheric echoes. Overlapping could be avoided most of the time, owing the configuration of flight used but not always. In such cases, the data were discarded.|$|R
50|$|The Doppler radar {{kurtosis}} analysis started quite recently, {{so there}} are still few scientific publications dealing with this parameter.

An average of 10 <b>Doppler</b> <b>spectra</b> are shown which are calculated {{from a time}} series of seven min of complex data. A proper Gaussian fit to the background distribution is possible by neglecting the strong amplitude spikes. If this background distribution is due to beam width broadening, either diffuse reflection or rather isotropic scattering is required. If beam width broadening is neglected, {{the width of the}} distribution is given by turbulent velocity fluctuations. The reflected component is about 1 / 3 of the scattered component. It is assumed that the amplitude spikes due to diffuse reflection indicate a Gaussian frequency distribution such as for the amplitudes due to scattering...|$|R
50|$|This {{parameter}} {{relates the}} location of the spectrum peak in respect to the mean spectrum value. Therefore, a positive skewness value indicates that the peak is located to the left with respect to the mean. A negative skewed spectrum has its peak on the right side with respect to the spectrum mean. A value around zero indicates a symmetric spectrum. In this way, the shape of a Doppler gives information on changes of cloud microphysics or of dynamical changes within the measured volume. The higher the elevation of the radar is, the higher are the dynamical influences on this parameter. Because wind shears lead to a broadening of the <b>Doppler</b> <b>spectrum</b> width, they can lead to rapid changes in skewness as well. To be able to relate the change in skewness of the <b>Doppler</b> <b>spectrum,</b> the Doppler width should be cross-checked as well.|$|E

30|$|The <b>Doppler</b> <b>spectra</b> {{are first}} {{calculated}} {{for each of the}} 128 radar gates from complex time series of 128 points weighted by a Hanning window. The noise level for each radar gate is then estimated from Hildebrandt and Sekhon’s method. The noise profile of 128 points is sorted and the average of the 3 smallest values are used a proxy of the noise level for all the radar gates. The moment method is then used to estimate the primary parameters (power, Doppler shift and spectral width). Because the <b>Doppler</b> <b>spectra</b> can be contaminated by any kind of outliers and in particular, UAV echoes (see Luce et al. 2017), all the <b>Doppler</b> <b>spectra</b> have been edited and manually corrected in order to reject, as far as possible, these contaminations. Most of time, the Doppler shift of UAV echoes did not coincide with the Doppler shift of atmospheric echoes, so {{that it was possible to}} reject these echoes by Doppler sorting. The rejection consisted in replacing the Doppler ranges on both sides of clear air atmospheric peak by the average noise power density defined above. The moment method was finally applied again, in order to get the definitive estimates of the primary parameters.|$|R
40|$|SuperDARN radars are {{sensitive}} to the collective Doppler characteristics of decametre-scale irregularities in the high latitude ionosphere. The radars routinely observe a distinct transition from large spectral width (&gt; 100 m s&minus; 1 ) located at higher latitudes to low spectral width (&lt; 50 m s&minus; 1 ) located at lower latitudes. Because of its equatorward location, the TIGER Tasmanian radar is very sensitive to the detection of the spectral width boundary (SWB) in the nightside auroral ionosphere. An analysis of the line-of-sight velocities and 2 -D beam-swinging vectors suggests the meso-scale (~ 100 km) convection is more erratic in the high spectral width region, but slower and more homogeneous in the low spectral width region. The radar autocorrelation functions are better modelled using Lorentzian <b>Doppler</b> <b>spectra</b> in the high spectral width region, and Gaussian <b>Doppler</b> <b>spectra</b> in the low spectral width region. However, paradoxically, Gaussian <b>Doppler</b> <b>spectra</b> are associated with the largest spectral widths. Application of the Burg maximum entropy method suggests the occurrence of double-peaked <b>Doppler</b> <b>spectra</b> is greater in the high spectral width region, implying the small-scale (~ 10 km) velocity fluctuations are more intense above the SWB. These observations combined with collective wave scattering theory imply there is a transition from a fast flowing, turbulent plasma with a correlation length of velocity fluctuations less than the scattering wavelength, to a slower moving plasma with a correlation length greater than the scattering wavelength. Peak scaling and structure function analysis of fluctuations in the SWB itself reveals approximately scale-free behaviour across temporal scales of ~ 10 s to ~ 34 min. Preliminary scaling exponents for these fluctuations, &alpha;GSF= 0. 18 &plusmn; 0. 02 and &alpha;GSF= 0. 09 &plusmn; 0. 01, are even smaller than that expected for MHD turbulence...|$|R

Thus, measurements are independent of the left and right ventricular outflow tract area. In 20 normal subjects, aortic regurgitant fraction ranged between − 2. 9 % and + 12. 0 % (mean + 4. 3 %), the physiologic value being + 2 %. In 20 patients with pure aortic regurgitation, aortic regurgitant fraction obtained by <b>Doppler</b> <b>spectra</b> (y) was compared with that calculated from biplane left ventriculography and cardiac output determined with the Fick method (x).
