5|$|In May 2014, {{after much}} trouble with disease and stability, the surface was removed and {{replaced}} with a more resilient <b>interwoven</b> sand based Desso pitch.|$|E
5|$|The {{spore print}} is white. Spores are {{elliptic}} (or narrowly so), and measure 8–12 by 4.8–6.2µm. There are clamp connections {{present in the}} hyphae. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored, club-shaped, and measure 23–30 by 8–10µm. The hymenium lacks cystidia. The cap flesh comprises homogenous, <b>interwoven</b> hyphae that are 3–5µm in diameter, while the cap cuticle is a 200–300-micrometer thick layer of <b>interwoven,</b> gelatinous hyphae up to 4µm in diameter.|$|E
5|$|The spores are spindle {{shaped and}} measure 10.5–19 by 4–7μm. The pileipellis is a trichodermium of <b>interwoven</b> septate hyphae, with long {{cylindrical}} cells.|$|E
5|$|Tricholoma vernaticum is {{classified}} in the subgenus Contextocutis of the genus Tricholoma on account of its clamp connections and <b>interwoven</b> hyphae in the cap cuticle.|$|E
5|$|Wattle and daub {{is an old}} {{building}} technique in which vines or smaller sticks are <b>interwoven</b> between upright poles, and then mud mixed with straw and grass is plastered over the wall.|$|E
5|$|Another {{aspect of}} the hospice {{philosophy}} is that the care is patient-centered, to treat the whole patient. Many healthcare agencies in the US market themselves as patient-centered; for hospice, this patient-directed care is integral and <b>interwoven</b> throughout the care which is provided. Related Medicare regulations reflect this philosophy.|$|E
5|$|Big Girls Don't Cry {{is divided}} into twelve chapters, telling a roughly chronological recount of the 2008 election, <b>interwoven</b> with Traister's own {{experiences}} and perspectives as well as analysis from other political commentators. She focuses on four key women involved in the election: Hillary Clinton, Sarah Palin, Michelle Obama and Elizabeth Edwards.|$|E
5|$|In deposit, the spore {{color is}} white. The spores are smooth, {{ellipsoidal}} to tear-shaped, hyaline (translucent), not amyloid, and measure 3.9–5.2 by 2.6–3.3μm. The basidia (spore-bearing {{cells in the}} hymenium) are four-spored and hyaline, with dimensions of 16–20 by 4–5μm. They have clamps at their bases. There are no cystidia on either the edges (cheilocystidia) or faces (pleurocystidia) of the gills. The arrangement of the hyphae in the hymenophoral tissue varies from regular to <b>interwoven.</b> The cap cuticle is a cutis (a type of tissue where the hyphae are arranged more or less parallel to the surface), formed by hyphae with septa, roughly 4–9μm in diameter. Clamp connections {{are present in the}} hyphae. The sclerotium is made of hyphae that have yellow pigment in their walls that appear in cross-section to be pseudoparenchymatous (compactly <b>interwoven</b> short-celled hyphae that resemble parenchyma of higher plants), and measure 5–10μm in diameter.|$|E
5|$|The book, {{published}} in February 2005 by Jonathan Cape in the United Kingdom and in April in the United States, was critically and commercially successful. Critics noted McEwan's elegant prose, careful dissection of daily life, and <b>interwoven</b> themes. It won the 2005 James Tait Black Memorial Prize for fiction. It has {{been translated into}} eight languages.|$|E
5|$|The {{flesh of}} the cap {{consists}} {{of a number of}} microscopically distinct layers of tissue. The cuticle of the cap (known as the pileipellis) is between 8–10µm thick, and is made of a loose textura intricata, a type of tissue in which the hyphae are irregularly <b>interwoven</b> with distinct spaces between them. The cuticle hyphae are thick-walled to thin-walled, with scattered inconspicuous cystidia measuring 40–55 by 3.5–5.5µm. These cystidia located in the cap (pileocystidia) are cylindrical, thin-walled, yellow in Melzer's reagent, hyaline in KOH, sometimes with amorphous dingy brown material coating the walls. Beneath the cuticle layer is a zone 54–65µm thick, made of very loosely entwined, thin-walled hyphae, 2–3µm in thickness, with clamps at the septa. Below this is a zone 208–221µm in thickness, in which the densely compacted hyphae, 3–8µm in diameter, have swollen, gelatinized walls, and often more or less a vertical orientation. This in turn is followed by a layer 520µm in thickness, formed of loosely <b>interwoven</b> hyphae, 2–8µm in width, some of which have thin walls with clamps at the septa, whilst others have somewhat thickened gelatinized walls. The {{flesh of the}} cap has a layer of upright hyphae bending into a lower layer of <b>interwoven</b> hyphae with diameters of 2.5–8µm. The flesh of the gills {{is similar to that of}} the lower cap.|$|E
5|$|The spore dust is olive to {{brownish}} olive. The spores are oval to somewhat -shaped, measuring 11–15μm long by 4.5–6.5μm wide. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped and four-spored, {{and measure}} 29.2–36.5 by 11.0–12.4μm. Cystidia {{on the sides}} of the tubes (pleurocystidia) are fuse-shaped with swollen middles and long necks, measuring 33–48 by 7.3–13.5μm; cheilocystidia (on the edges of the pores) have a similar morphology. The cap cuticle is made of cylindrical hyphae 3.7–5.8μm wide that are <b>interwoven</b> compactly, and the hyphal tips are erect and arranged in bundles. In contrast, the hyphae of the cap flesh is loosely <b>interwoven</b> with hyphae that are cylindrical and branched, measuring 3.7–8.8μm. Hyphae do not contain clamp connections. The mycelium is an unusual yellow colour.|$|E
5|$|The {{thick-walled}} spores {{are roughly}} spherical, rusty-brown, finely and densely warted, and have diameters of 5–6.5µm. Elaters are 50–80 by 4–6µm, and have ring-like or spiral thickenings. The endoperidium consists of densely <b>interwoven</b> hyphae that are 3–9µm {{in diameter and}} walls less than 1µm thick; they are septate, branched, pale yellow, with clamp connections.|$|E
5|$|The three {{story lines}} are told nonlinearly, each {{separated}} by five centuries. The three periods are <b>interwoven</b> with match cuts and recurring visual motifs; Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz play {{the main characters}} in all three narratives. Even within a given narrative, the elements of that particular story are not told in chronological order.|$|E
5|$|A {{piece of}} a garment signed by Ivan Alexander and <b>interwoven</b> with gold was {{discovered}} in a noble's grave near Pirot in the 1970s; today it is preserved in the National Museum of Serbia in Belgrade. It is the first find of its kind, demonstrating a medieval tradition attested in writing according to which Orthodox rulers would present their most eminent dignitaries with a {{piece of a}} garment they had worn.|$|E
5|$|British {{immersive}} theatre company Punchdrunk {{took inspiration}} from the Paisley witch trials for their ongoing New York City production, Sleep No More. Gallow Green, {{the name of the}} fictitious Scottish town that serves as the show's setting, as well as many of the characters (including Fulton, Bargarran, Reid, Agnes Naismith, Catherine Campbell, James Lindsey, and Nurse Christian Shaw) were all taken from the witch trials and <b>interwoven</b> with the elements of William Shakespeare's Macbeth found throughout the immersive production.|$|E
5|$|For the {{restoration}} of the Gamla stan metro station in 1998 the artist Göran Dahl furnished the walls and floors with motifs from various medieval textiles and manuscripts, including the Överhogdal tapestries and the 14th-century Nobilis humilis (Magnushymnen) from the Orkney Islands. Vädersolstavlan is prominently featured on the eastern wall just south of the platform where the terrazzo wall depicts the emblematic sun dog arcs <b>interwoven</b> with enlarged fragments of textiles.|$|E
5|$|In early {{editions of}} the setting, The Realms shared a unified {{cosmology}} with various other campaign settings called the Great Wheel. In this way each of the Dungeons & Dragons campaign settings were linked together to form one <b>interwoven</b> world connected by various planes of existence. With {{the release of the}} 2001 Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting, the setting was given its own distinct and separate cosmological arrangement, with unique planes not explicitly connected to those of the other settings.|$|E
5|$|Navigator {{training}} was historically <b>interwoven</b> with culture and ritual. Great discretion {{had to be}} shown in candidate selection so that the knowledge preserved through oral tradition would have the greatest chance of survival. A master navigator's rank was equal or superior to a village chief's rank. Prudent navigation relies on no single technique but instead synthesizes position from multiple inputs. Underway, this constant synthesis {{makes it easy to}} spot the navigator by being the one with red eyes from sleep deprivation.|$|E
5|$|Spores are spherical, hyaline (translucent), {{and measure}} 2.5–3.4μm in diameter. They are {{thick-walled}} {{with a short}} pedicel (a tubelike extension), and are ornamented with tiny spines (verrucae) that are roughly equidistant from each other. Capillitial threads are long, hyaline, and branched, measuring 2.4–4μm thick. They are septate and occasionally have pits on their walls. The exoperidium comprises thick-walled, inflated hyphae mixed with sphaerocysts (spherical cells), while the endoperidium is made of tightly <b>interwoven,</b> thick-walled hyphae. In the rhizomorphs, the hyphae in the central core are several times as thick {{as those in the}} surrounding subcortex.|$|E
5|$|Spores of R.brevipes are egg-shaped to {{more or less}} spherical, {{and measure}} 7.5–10 by 6.5–8.5µm; they have a {{partially}} reticulate (network-like) surface dotted with warts measuring up to 1µm high. The cap cuticle is arranged {{in the form of}} a cutis (characterized by hyphae that run parallel to the cap surface) comprising <b>interwoven</b> hyphae with rounded tips. There are no cystidia on the cap (pileocystidia).|$|E
5|$|The film's {{visual effects}} were {{completed}} by seven special effects studios, including Double Negative and Luma Pictures. Blur Studio {{was the lead}} studio behind the film's prologue sequence taking place 5,000 years {{before the start of}} the film, on the Dark Elves homeworld of Svartalfheim. The sequence consisted mostly of computer graphics with live-action shots <b>interwoven</b> throughout. The use of CG allowed for greater freedom of movement by the characters as the live-action costumes were too constrictive.|$|E
5|$|The gill {{tissue is}} made of {{thin-walled}} hyphae containing a septum, which are hyaline to pale yellow, and measure 3–15µm wide. The cap tissue comprises <b>interwoven,</b> inflated hyphae with widths between 2 and 25µm. Neither the gill tissue nor the cap tissue show any color reaction when stained with Melzer's reagent. Clamp connections are rare in the hyphae of Lepiota babruzalka.|$|E
5|$|The {{spore print}} is olive-brown. The smooth oval spores measure 12–15 by 5–6μm, and {{sometimes}} have an internal oil drop. Basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 22–34 by 8–9μm. The fusiform (fuse-shaped) cystidia are colourless with oil droplets, and have dimensions of 40–50 by 7–8μm. Cap cuticle tissue {{is in the}} form of a trichoderm, where the outermost hyphae emerge roughly parallel, like hairs, perpendicular to the cap surface. These cylindrical, <b>interwoven</b> hyphae contain septa.|$|E
5|$|The spores {{are roughly}} spherical to ellipsoidal, {{measuring}} 7.9–9.5 by 8.0–8.8µm. They feature surface ornamentations up to 0.8µm high {{and an almost}} complete reticulum comprising broad, rounded ridges. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are somewhat cylindrical, four-spored, and measure 50–70 by 9–11µm. The cap cuticle is an ixocutis (made of gelatinous hyphae that run parallel to the cap surface) up to 60µm thick, with hyphae that are 2–6wide that are usually branched and <b>interwoven.</b>|$|E
5|$|This model, {{known as}} the nebular hypothesis, was first {{developed}} in the 18th century by Emanuel Swedenborg, Immanuel Kant, and Pierre-Simon Laplace. Its subsequent development has <b>interwoven</b> a variety of scientific disciplines including astronomy, physics, geology, and planetary science. Since {{the dawn of the}} space age in the 1950s and the discovery of extrasolar planets in the 1990s, the model has been both challenged and refined to account for new observations.|$|E
5|$|Altar 13 {{is another}} early Maya {{monument}} {{dating to the}} Late Preclassic. Like Altar12 it was probably originally erected as a vertical stela. At some point it was deliberately broken, with severe damage inflicted upon the main portion of the sculpture, obliterating the central and lower portions. At a later date it was reused as a horizontal altar. The remains of two figures can be seen flanking the damage lower portion of the monument and the large head of the sacred bird survives above the area of damage. The right hand figure is wearing an <b>interwoven</b> skirt and is probably female.|$|E
5|$|Behavior {{is known}} {{mainly from the}} marsh rice rat and O.couesi, with some {{scattered}} data from the other species. Oryzomys are semiaquatic, spending {{much time in the}} water, and otherwise mainly live on the ground; both the marsh rice rat and O.couesi are known to be excellent swimmers and will flee into the water when disturbed. Both are also active during the night and build nests of <b>interwoven</b> vegetation, which may be suspended above the water. Breeding may occur throughout the year in both species, but is known to be seasonally variable in the marsh rice rat. In both, gestation takes about 21 to 28days and litter size is usually one to seven, averaging three to five. Young marsh rice rats and O.couesi become reproductively active when about 50days old.|$|E
5|$|By the 1940s, {{the castle}} {{structures}} were mostly covered with rubble and debris, <b>interwoven</b> with pathways {{created by the}} movement of visitors over the years. During the Second World War, the castle {{was used by the}} British Army, possibly as an early warning site fitted with anti-aircraft searchlights. In an area just {{to the north of the}} castle, the Starfish and Naval decoy sites were created to distract incoming German bombers from the town of Rye itself. Trenches were dug in the north bastion, and military training may have been conducted around the outskirts of the castle.|$|E
5|$|In retrospect, {{being sent}} {{far from the}} Middle East (Egypt) he viewed as a parental {{decision}} much influenced by “the prospects of deracinated people, like us the Palestinians, being so uncertain {{that it would be}} best to send me as far away as possible.” The realities of peripatetic life—of <b>interwoven</b> cultures, of feeling out of place, and of homesickness—so affected the schoolboy Edward that themes of dissonance feature in the work and worldview of the academic Said. At school’s end, he had become Edward W. Said—a polyglot intellectual (fluent in English, French, and Arabic) who had earned a Bachelor of Arts (1957) degree at Princeton University, and Master of Arts (1960) and Doctor of Philosophy (1964) degrees in English Literature from Harvard University.|$|E
5|$|Nablus costume {{was of a}} {{distinctive}} style that employed colorful combinations of various fabrics. Due to its position as important trade center with a flourishing souk ("market"), in late 19th century, {{there was a large}} choice of fabrics available in the city, from Damascus and Aleppo silk to Manchester cottons and calicos. Similar in construction to the garments worn in the Galilee, both long and short Turkish style jackets were worn over the thob ("robe"). For daily wear, thobs were often made of white cotton or linen, with a preference for winged sleeves. In the summer, costumes often incorporated <b>interwoven</b> striped bands of red, green and yellow on the front and back, with appliqué and braidwork popularly decorating the qabbeh ("square chest piece").|$|E
5|$|Peridioles are {{attached}} to the fruit body by a funiculus, a complex structure of hyphae that may be differentiated into three regions: the basal piece, which attaches it to the inner wall of the peridium, the middle piece, and an upper sheath, called the purse, connected to the lower surface of the peridiole. In the purse and middle piece is a coiled thread of <b>interwoven</b> hyphae called the funicular cord, attached at one end to the peridiole and at the other end to an entangled mass of hyphae called the hapteron. In some species the peridioles may be covered by a tunica, a thin white membrane (particularly evident in C.striatus and C.crassimurus).|$|E
5|$|Peridioles {{are often}} {{attached}} to the fruiting body by a funiculus, a structure of hyphae that is differentiated into three regions: the basal piece, which attaches it to the inner wall of the peridium, the middle piece, and an upper sheath, called the purse, connected to the lower surface of the peridiole. Inside the purse and middle piece is a coiled thread of <b>interwoven</b> hyphae called the funicular cord, attached at {{one end to the}} peridiole and at the other end to an entangled mass of hyphae called the hapteron. C.olla has a wide purse with an upper portion not easily distinguishable from the lower part.|$|E
5|$|The ancient Egyptians {{produced}} art {{to serve}} functional purposes. For over 3500 years, artists adhered to artistic forms and iconography that were {{developed during the}} Old Kingdom, following a strict set of principles that resisted foreign influence and internal change. These artistic standards—simple lines, shapes, and flat areas of color combined with the characteristic flat projection of figures with no indication of spatial depth—created a sense of order and balance within a composition. Images and text were intimately <b>interwoven</b> on tomb and temple walls, coffins, stelae, and even statues. The Narmer Palette, for example, displays figures that can also be read as hieroglyphs. Because of the rigid rules that governed its highly stylized and symbolic appearance, ancient Egyptian art served its political and religious purposes with precision and clarity.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle was}} also immortalized in the Hungarian epic poem Szigeti Veszedelem ("Peril of Sziget"), written in fifteen parts by Zrinski's {{great-grandson}} Nicholas VII of Zrin (also a Ban of Croatia) in 1647 {{and published in}} 1651. This {{was one of the}} first such epics in the Hungarian language and was also inspired by Marulić's Judita. Kenneth Clark's renowned history Civilisation lists the Szigeti Veszedelem as one of the major literary achievements of the 17th century. In spite of the author and other members of Zrinski family being fierce enemies of the Turks, the poem never demonizes them. The Turks are portrayed as human beings and a love story between Deliman the Tatar and the Sultan's daughter Cumilla is <b>interwoven</b> into the main plot.|$|E
5|$|The capillitium {{refers to}} coarse, late-maturing, {{thick-walled}} {{cells in the}} gleba that develop pores or slits in their thick secondary walls. The capillitial hyphae are 1.5–9.5µm wide, thick-walled, often with a narrow lumen, and with or without surface ornamentation. The columella hyphae are 1.5–14µm wide (occasionally wider, up to 34µm), thick-walled, often with narrow lumen. Single thin-walled, about 1.5µm wide hyphae with clamps can be observed. The endoperidial hyphae are densely <b>interwoven,</b> thick-walled, and about 2–6µm wide. The whitish powder on newly expanded specimens consists of crystalline matter and thin-walled, 1.5–4µm wide, branched hyphae with clamps. The peristome hyphae are thick-walled, 2–11µm wide. The pseudoparenchymatous layer is built up by bladder-like, thin-walled hyphae of varying size. On the surface of newly expanded specimens crystals and thin-walled hyphae {{of the same kind}} as on the endoperidium are present. The crystals are calcium oxalate dihydrate that have the crystalline structure of a pyramid, and are arranged singly or in loose aggregates, 11 to 30µm in size. The fibrous layer has thick-walled hyphae 1.5–4µm wide. The mycelial layer in the inner, very thin part (seen as a glossy lining on the fibrous layer of newly expanded fruit bodies) consists of a dense web of thin-walled, 1.5–4µm wide, clamped hyphae. Thick-walled hyphae are also present, measuring 2–11 (sometimes up to 19)µm wide. The outer part (the mycelial cup) consists of thick-walled, branched and densely <b>interwoven</b> hyphae (often with a narrow lumen) that measure 1.5–4µm wide.|$|E
5|$|The glyphs {{are divided}} into three categories: in{{dependent}}, compound, and dependent (glyphs that only appear in combination with others). He sees other groupings as being arbitrary, as well as detrimental to the proper understanding of rongorongo. Contrary to other scholars who do not place importance on compound glyphs, Dietrich sees compounding as a major aspect of the system. In fact, Dietrich describes rongorongo as a network in which the characters are <b>interwoven</b> together through various combinations. He speculates {{that it was his}} background in graphic design that allowed him to perceive this pattern, while other researchers relied too heavily on linguistics and epigraphy.|$|E
