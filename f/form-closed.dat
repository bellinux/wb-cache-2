40|$|To {{solve the}} indetermination of forces {{existing}} in a <b>form-closed</b> cam mechanism formed by conjugate cams, where the {{contact between the}} cams and the follower rollers is constantly ensured by only the geometry of the elements, dynamic models that consider the elasticity of the elements must be proposed. Because the stiffness {{of the main elements}} is associated with the elasticity of the solids, tight variations in manufacturing and assembly errors modify the effective interference fit, which significantly affects the expected fatigue life of the mechanism, leading to a premature failure of the elements due to surface fatigue. Based on a real industrial application of a conjugate cam mechanism and using lumped-parameter models, the objectives of this paper are: first, to show {{that it is difficult to}} achieve a pure <b>form-closed</b> conjugate cam mechanism, with the expected fatigue life of the mechanism, by using only standard tolerance specifications; second, to compare the expected fatigue life and motor torque with other cam mechanism design strategies such as force-closed and the combination of force-closed and <b>form-closed</b> strategies, known as force-closed conjugate cam strategy. This paper based on simulation results demonstrates that this latest strategy can, thanks to a better control of the preload, easily achieve results very similar to the theoretical ones of a <b>form-closed</b> conjugate cam mechanism. A prototype of the mechanism of the force-closed conjugate cam strategy is also built. Postprint (author's final draft...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a new method {{to study the}} capability of an underactuated hand to produce <b>form-closed</b> grasps. First, the stability behaviours of different underactuated parallel-jaw grippers are analyzed and compared according to their actuation and transmission mechanisms. Then, both notions of 1 st order and 2 nd order form-closure are revisited for underactuated hands, since {{in this particular case}} the assumption of fixed contacts made in the original definition is false. Therefore, constraints imposed by non-backdrivable mechanisms are introduced into the model of the whole grasp. Finally, a simple geometrical condition, necessary and sufficient for 1 st order form-closure is proposed. This permits to conclude on the minimum number of non-backdrivable mechanisms required to produce 1 st order <b>form-closed</b> grasps using an underactuated hand...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{conventional}} clinching of steels {{is currently}} limited to tensile strength less than 800 N/mm and to {{elongation at fracture}} more than 14 %. To realise the clinching of high-strength steels, the sheet can be heated locally at the joint, to improve ductility. Thereby the material characteristics outside the joint should be maintained. This could be achieved by means of short-time laser heating. The short-time tempering behaviour of press hardened steel 22 MnB 5 has been analysed. The mechanical properties during a short-time heat treatment were investigated by thermo-mechanical analysis in a deformation dilatometer. Thereby laser-assisted clinching shall be established and an efficient <b>form-closed</b> and force-closed connection shall be produced. As a result, the press hardened steel 22 MnB 5 could be clinched by laser assistance {{for the very first}} time...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a new pneumatically driven underactuated hand with two fingers and 3 phalanxes per finger. Two evidences {{have led the}} design of this hand. Firstly, the use of pneumatic energy facilitates the underactuation of the hand, indeed a single T-connector suffices to share out one input among two outputs. Secondly, non-backdrivable mechanisms have {{to be used in}} the transmission of phalanx’s motion so that the hand is capable of producing <b>form-closed</b> grasps. This latter design principle is justified using a newly developed method that permits to study the form-closure property of a grasp exerted by an underactuated hand. Moreover, the intriguing ejection phenomenon is avoided thanks to non-backdrivable mechanisms that prohibit any backward motion of phalanxes when correctly positioned. An original mechanism called the “pneumatic parallelogram ” is described, it enables the hand to perform fine pinch grasps. Finally, the optimal design of both fingers is addressed with respect to the force-isotropy of the finger and the positiveness of phalanx forces...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMori et al. (2013) {{identified}} the current commercial requirements for higher performance, higher productivity, lower cost and joining of dissimilar materials {{to lead to}} a strong demand for new joining and especially joining by forming processes. When joining a shaft-hub-connection by lateral extrusion of the shaft a combination of form- and friction locked join is established. The internal hub profile which defines the <b>form-closed</b> joint in circumferential direction significantly affects the forming process and hence connection properties. The internal hub profile is mainly characterized by the profile eccentricity e, the number of teeth n and type of profile. This study mainly deals with the experimental investigations concerning the influence of the internal hub profile parameters on the forming process and part properties. To identify a suitable internal hub profile characterized by low punch forces, minimal and homogeneous radial deformations and high hub cavity filling numerous joining by forming processes are carried out wherein the mentioned profile parameters are varied. To evaluate the influence of internal hub profile the punch force-stroke curves, the roundness deviation of the hub and the hub cavity filling are used...|$|E
40|$|The {{worldwide}} {{incidence of}} asthma yields 250 000 deaths annually, being {{almost all of}} these deaths avoidable. The inhalation therapy is the preferable route to deliver bronchodilator/antiinflammatory drugs to the patient lungs. Within this route of treatment, pressurized metered dose inhalers (pMDI’s) are the cornerstone devices. When coupled with a valved holding chamber (VHC), its efficiency increases and the limitations almost vanish. The VHC devices efficiency is something of interest to measure. For that, it is necessary an experimental setup that evaluates the amount of drug delivered by the device. This setup shall replicate a human breath waveform as input, therefore a breath simulator machine was build. The report herein describes the project process of the <b>form-closed</b> cam-follower mechanism necessary to replicate the waveform. The design and dimensional constrains are input in the cam design, leading to a piston diameter of 63. 0 mm and a cam base diameter of 250. 0 mm. A performance analysis to the pressure angle, curvature radius and backlash impact force, is reported. It can be concluded that a larger diameter would improved the performance results substantially. A future experimental validation will be in order, with the resource to a LVDT sensor.

40|$|International audienceThe {{property}} of form-closure of a grasp, as generally {{defined in the}} literature, {{is based on the}} assumption that contact points between the hand and the object are fixed in space. However, this assumption is false when considering a grasp exerted by an underactuated hand, since in this case, it is not possible to control the position of each phalanx independently. In spite of researchers' interest in studying form-closure, none of the available published work on this subject takes into consideration the particular kinematics of underactuated hands. Actually, there are few available tools to qualify or quantify the stability of a grasp exerted by an underactuated hand, thus the design of underactuated hands mostly results from an intuitive approach. This paper aims to reduce this gap. A classification of underactuated hands is proposed, based on the expression of contact forces. This highlights the influence of non-backdrivable mechanisms introduced in the transmission of the closing motion of the hand on the stability of the grasp. The way to extend the original definition of form-closure to underactuated grasps is illustrated. A more general definition is formulated, which checks the stability of the set "object + hand".

40|$|Due to dynamic effects, clearances, {{manufacturing}} and assembly errors in <b>form-closed</b> cam mechanisms, the follower jump can also occur. For conjugate cam mechanisms {{a technique to}} avoid the follower jump {{without the use of}} a spring involves making the conjugate cam profiles bigger than the kinematical ones by adding an external offset. This strategy produces an interference fit between the conjugate cam profiles and the follower train. This paper presents an ordered procedure to study the influence that the planned interference fit has on the evaluation of the contact forces, the expected fatigue life of the rollers, contact pressures and the lubrication conditions. The study is based on a conjugate cam mechanism with translational roller followers used in a real automatic process for manufacturing muselets. A three-degree-of-freedom dynamic model is proposed and the Hertzian theory for general profiles is used to model the nonlinear contact stiffness between the cams and the crowned rollers. The dynamic model predicts {{that it is difficult to}} obtain conjugate cam mechanisms with an infinite expected fatigue life of the rollers just by considering typical achievable manufacturing errors or clearances, and as happens in reality, a set-up process is highly recommended. The procedure is also tested with measured manufacturing errors on a coordinate measure machine—CMM—and with measured radial internal clearances for the rollers measured by an experimental apparatus. Also, to evaluate lubrication conditions, surface finishing measurements have been taken of the cams and the rollers with a surface profiler. Postprint (published version...|$|E

40|$|Blade–disc fixings in the fan of {{aeroplane}} turbo–engines {{are highly}} loaded <b>form–closed</b> connections that allow micrometer size relative movement between blade and disc. This loading type is called fretting, the encountered damage mechanisms are wear and cracking. To reduce damage, palliative coatings are applied. To assure {{the reliability of}} the engine these coatings need to be reapplied during regular maintenance operations. The prediction of wear and fissuration in the fixings is a challenging task. Better tools for damage prediction will allow an optimisation of the maintenance intervals and the design of more damage resistant blade–disc fixings. The goal of this work is the construction of a finite element (FE) model that is suitable for an accurate prediction of fretting damage in blade–disc fixations. With this goal in mind, methods are elaborated to take (i) the change of the friction coefficient, (ii) cyclic plastic material deformation, (iii) crack initiation, (iv) wear and related contact geometry change and (v) wear–fissuration interaction into account. Integrating some of the models into a finite element analysis of the blade–disc contact, an attempt to predict wear and fatigue in a blade–disc fixation is made. To describe the change of the apparent friction coefficient during the wear of the coatings, analytical and FE models are made. In these the apparent friction coefficient is regarded to be the mean value of a micro–structurally heterogeneous contact. For the description of the cyclic plastic deformation of Ti 6 Al 4 V a multikinematic von Mises material model and a polycrystal plasticity material model is used. Both models are suitable for the description of ratchetting, additionally the polycrystal plasticity model takes micro–scale plastic deformation, crystallographic texture and mean stress relaxation into account. Crack initiation is computed using the Dang Van high cycle fatigue criterion. For the use with polycrystal plasticity models the criterion is reassessed. As a wear criterion the dissipated energy approach is used. Contact geometry change by wear is taken into account in FE computations by iteratively updating the mesh by the computed wear. An attempt to describe the interaction of wear and fatigue is made using polycrystal plasticity and the Dang Van criterion in FE fretting computations with a cylinder–plate contact pair. The computations are compared to corresponding fretting experiments provided by partners from LTDS – Ecole Centrale de Lyon. Finally geometry change by wear, cyclic plastic deformation and fissuration of the blade–disc assembly are calculated in 2 D and 3 D FE computations. A main result is the circumstance that wear, fatigue and their interaction can be qualitatively described using a polycrystal plasticity material model and the Dang Van criterion without the use of a classical wear model. The fact that this is not possible with von Mises material models shows that replacing macro–scale phenomenological models by more physically based micro–scale models increases predictive power. In all FE computations with the blade–disc fixing including geometry change by wear and von Mises plasticity, wear increases fatigue life, cyclic plastic deformation can have the opposite effect. It is shown that a 2 D simplification of the blade–disc model yields unrealistic results. This means that 3 D modelling is indispensable. A macro–scale model for the prediction of wear and cracking in the blade–disc fixing has been constructed in this thesis. An integration of the micro–scale models developed in this thesis into the blade–disc fretting model will further increase the predictive power. xx...|$|E
