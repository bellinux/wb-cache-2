It permits to elucidate both a discrepancy between calculated values for duration of developer application stage and the corresponding experimental data and some other discrepancies. It is established that the process of drawing out of a penetrant from defects by developer’s layer is characterized, as a rule, by three basic stages for wet developer and by two stages for <b>dry</b> <b>developer.</b> For wet developer the first stage corresponds to the interaction of two liquids: a penetrant and liquid phase of a developer. Classical capillary penetration of a penetrant into the developer layer represents the second stage. In the most cases this stage is very short-term (maximum some seconds). The longest-duration stage is the third one. Two processes of different nature characterize it. The first process is caused by the diffusion-dissolution of a gas in entrapped penetrant. The second process was recently established in our experiments. The physical mechanism, underlying this development process, is based on a liquid film flow. For <b>dry</b> <b>developer</b> the process of penetrant’s drawing out from defects is similar to the considere...|$|E

5000|$|The {{company was}} {{established}} in 1918 as a basketball hoop and <b>dry</b> line <b>developer,</b> and created the first football faceguard in 1935. In 2008, competitor Riddell sued Schutt for infringing on three patents. The three products identified were branded by Schutt under the names [...] "DNA", [...] "ION", and [...] "AIR XP". Two years later, the company sued Riddell, also for patent-infringement. However, Schutt ended up losing in the lawsuit, forcing them to file bankruptcy. Despite this, football helmets and facemask sales in 2011 increased by 15%. After the bankruptcy, Platinum Equity acquired {{the assets of the}} company.|$|R
50|$|This type of {{apartment}} {{developed in}} North America {{during the middle}} of the 20th century. The term initially described a living space created within a former industrial building, usually 19th century. These large apartments found favor with artists and musicians wanting accommodation in large cities (New York for example) and is related to unused buildings in the decaying parts of such cities being occupied illegally by people squatting. These loft apartments were usually located in former highrise warehouses and factories left vacant after town planning rules and economic conditions in the mid 20th century changed. The resulting apartments created a new bohemian lifestyle and are arranged in a completely different way from most urban living spaces, often including workshops and art studio spaces. As the supply of old buildings of a suitable nature has <b>dried</b> up <b>developers</b> have responded by constructing new buildings in the same aesthetic with varying degrees of success.|$|R
50|$|After excess {{penetrant}} {{has been}} removed, a white developer {{is applied to}} the sample. Several developer types are available, including: non-aqueous wet <b>developer,</b> <b>dry</b> powder, water-suspendable, and water-soluble. Choice of developer is governed by penetrant compatibility (one can't use water-soluble or -suspendable developer with water-washable penetrant), and by inspection conditions. When using non-aqueous wet <b>developer</b> (NAWD) or <b>dry</b> powder, the sample must be dried prior to application, while soluble and suspendable developers are applied with the part still wet from the previous step. NAWD is commercially available in aerosol spray cans, and may employ acetone, isopropyl alcohol, or a propellant that is a combination of the two. Developer should form a semi-transparent, even coating on the surface.|$|R
