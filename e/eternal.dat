5|$|The {{concept for}} <b>Eternal</b> Punishment {{emerged during the}} writing for Persona 2: Innocent Sin. Halfway through writing the latter's script, Tadashi Satomi felt that the draft gave him the {{impression}} of needing an alternate point of view {{to that of the}} main hero. This concept formed the basis for <b>Eternal</b> Punishments plot. To foreshadow this, the team showed the main characters from <b>Eternal</b> Punishment through minor roles in Innocent Sin. <b>Eternal</b> Punishment began full development after the release of Innocent Sin. Innocent Sin and <b>Eternal</b> Punishment both used the same game engine and structure. Kouji Okada, Innocent Sins producer, returned in the same role. When developing <b>Eternal</b> Punishment, the development team took what they learned from Innocent Sin and used it to improve the gameplay and the Rumor system. One of the biggest concerns when making <b>Eternal</b> Punishment was how much the development staff wanted to include, which went well beyond their original plans.|$|E

5|$|Branham {{became more}} {{controversial}} {{in his later}} years and this was particularly evident in his development of a theology that emphasized a few select doctrines. His theology seemed complicated and bizarre to many people who admired him personally. Although not always consistent with each other, his primary concerns were eschatology, the denial of an <b>eternal</b> hell, Oneness Pentecostalism, predestination, <b>eternal</b> security and the serpent's seed. Branham asserted that his doctrinal teachings were given to him by divine revelation.|$|E

5|$|The Assembly {{worked in}} the Reformed Protestant {{theological}} tradition, also known as Calvinism. It took the Bible as the authoritative word of God, from which all theological reflection must be based. The divines were committed to the Reformed doctrine of predestination—that God chooses certain men to be saved and enjoy <b>eternal</b> life rather than <b>eternal</b> punishment. There was some disagreement at the Assembly over the doctrine of particular redemption—that Christ died only for those chosen for salvation. The Assembly also held to Reformed covenant theology, a framework for interpreting the Bible. The Assembly's Confession {{is the first of}} the Reformed confessions to teach a doctrine called the covenant of works, which teaches that before the fall of man, God promised <b>eternal</b> life to Adam on condition that he perfectly obeyed God.|$|E
