50|$|Focusing on macro-societal phenomena, Friedland and Alford (1991: 232) {{identified}} several key Institutions: the Capitalist market, bureaucratic state, democracy, nuclear family, and Christianity that are each {{guided by a}} distinct institutional logic. Thornton (2004) revised Friedland and Alford’s (1991) inter-institutional scheme to six institutional orders, i.e., the market, the corporation, the professions, the state, the family, and religions. More recently, Thornton, Ocasio and Lounsbury (2012), in more fully fleshing out the institutional logic perspective, added community as another key institutional order. This revision to a theoretically abstract and analytically distinct set of ideal types makes it useful for studying multiple logics in conflict and consensus, the hybridization of logics, and institutions {{in other parts of}} society and the world. While building on Friedland and Alford’s scheme, the revision addresses the confusion created by conflating <b>institutional</b> <b>sectors</b> with ideology (democracy) and means of organization (bureaucracy), variables that can be characteristic several different <b>institutional</b> <b>sectors.</b> The institutional logic of Christianity leaves out other religions in the US and other religions that are dominant {{in other parts of the}} world. Thornton and Ocasio (2008) discuss the importance of not confusing the ideal types of the inter-institutional system with a description of the empirical observations in a study—that is to use the ideal types as meta theory and method of analysis.|$|E

It demonstrates {{the extent to}} which operating surpluses are distributed (for example by dividends) to the owners of the enterprises. Also recorded in this account is the property income received by an owner of a financial asset in return for providing funds to, or putting a tangible non-produced asset at the disposal of, another unit. The receipt by government of taxes on production less subsidies is shown in resources.The resources side of this account includes the components of the income approach to measuring gross domestic product and is the starting point for the quarterly sector accounts. The accounts also include property income recorded as both resources for receipts and uses for payments.The balance of this account is the gross balance of primary income for each sector. If the gross balance of primary income is aggregated across all sectors of the UK economy, the result is gross national income.|$|E
50|$|Transactions can {{be grouped}} broadly {{according}} to {{purpose in the}} following accounts;the production account displays the transactions involved in the generation of income by the production of goods and services. For {{each of the four}} sectors (the rest of the world does not have a production account), the balancing item, gross value added, is shown as output less intermediate consumption.Gross value added at basic prices for each sector differs from gross domestic product for the UK total economy. The difference occurs because taxes less subsidies on products are not included in the production account by sector and are instead included within resources for the UK total economy. The sum of gross value added and taxes less subsidies on products for the UK economy is equal to GDP at market prices.The distribution and use of income accounts exist for all the <b>institutional</b> <b>sectors.</b> These accounts describe the distribution and redistribution of income and its use in the form of final consumption. The distribution and use of income are analysed in four stages, each of which is presented as a separate account.|$|E

40|$|Recent major {{disaster}} events at {{colleges and universities}} around the nation have demonstrated that change is needed {{in the way that}} higher education institutions (HEIs) approach disaster preparation. The comforting notion that HEIs are immune to natural and manmade hazards has been shattered by events such as the Virginia Tech massacre and Hurricane Katrina’s assault on Mississippi’s coastal campuses. Reports of many other institutional responses to a variety of disaster incidents demonstrate that these two {{major disaster}}s are not isolated events on the campuses of the American academy. This study developed a snapshot view of disaster preparation in American HEIs, using National Incident Management System (NIMS) compliance as a proxy for disaster preparedness. This quantitative, retrospective study, with a non-experimental design, used a scientific approach that employed both archival and survey data from a stratified random sample of 108 HEIs that were categorized based on organization and governance, as well as <b>institutional</b> <b>sector,</b> to establish a benchmark measurement of disaster preparation in the various types of institutions. Further, the study examined institutional context factors to investigate the degree of NIMS compliance in place at American HEIs, including organization and governance, previous disaster experience, institutional size, legal representation on the planning and response team, <b>institutional</b> <b>sector,</b> and composite economic losses by state, to see if any of these factors was statistically associated with NIMS compliance. Results indicate that two of the study variables were statistically significant; institutional size and <b>institutional</b> <b>sector.</b> These findings expose that smaller institutions are lagging behind in disaster preparedness. Additionally, the outcomes reveal that private institutions are facing difficulty keeping pace with their public counterparts in disaster preparation.

40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to apply a new {{backward}} and forward dispersion approach, starting from the original Rasmussen definition, which can give further insight into the interactions between industries and <b>institutional</b> <b>sectors</b> in a multiregional framework.

From such representation, we derive a set of indices of intraregional and interregional backward and forward dispersion that identifies key groups of industries and <b>institutional</b> <b>sectors.</b> The strength of these groups is further evaluated in terms of correlation of the impact components within the groups and cross-correlation between industry and <b>institutional</b> <b>sectors</b> groups.

40|$|Abstract: Nowadays, {{covering}} the financial deficit of public administration in Romania {{is a difficult}} task, taking into consideration {{the fact that in}} a continous way, this <b>institutional</b> <b>sector</b> must implement and manage investment projects, that suit the local needs of Romanian colectivity and dynamize their adaption to the social,economical and political requirements of the integration in the European Union. Therefore, the alternative of financing through the capital market is well received by the public authorities, especially because {{there is a lack of}} flexibility and variety of financing possibilities for the public administration. The interest for this type of financing has increased over the time, once with becoming familiar with the mechanisms and advantages of such a type of financing by all entities that operate on the market (issuers, investors, intermediaries).
