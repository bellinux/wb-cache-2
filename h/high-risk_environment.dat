40|$|National and {{international}} crises {{in the early}} 21 st Century, whether natural, technological or man-made, emphasize the need for highly reliable organizations (HROs) to conduct emergency response in a relatively error-free way. Urban search and rescue units provide a pivotal intermittent role in these <b>high-risk</b> <b>environments.</b> Traditional HRO research focuses on a concept known as "collective mind" [...] heedful interactions of responders that accomplish reliability. Rather than focusing on collective mind, this study uses a practice-based communication approach to examine the material interplay of bodies, objects, and sites using ethnography and grounded theory. In-depth interviews, participant observations, and organizational documents were coded and contrasted to find patterns in material interplay. More specifically, this study examines how these material features interact to orchestrate reliable practices through ecological coherence, a bonding of multiple forces to construct meaning and improvisation. The study has implication for HRO theory through focusing {{on the role of}} the body rather than emphasizing cognitive judgment in collective action. Collective body shifts the discussion of mindful processes to embodied practices and offers insights into the ways responders enact safety and perform responses in dynamic, <b>high-risk</b> <b>environments...</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} an effort to develop and {{validate}} a model for constructing job performance aids for use in high risk environments. The study resulted {{in the development of a}} generic conceptual design model that was applicable to a wide variety of job performance aid designs and the development of a task-specific procedural design model targeted to high risk situations. The models were based upon a synthesis of instructional technology and human factor literature and a series of interviews with instructional design and human factor experts. A job performance aid was developed using the procedural design model for use by corporate aviation cabin crewmembers. The procedural design model was then validated by comparing the performances of an experimental group and a control group of professional cabin crewmembers who conducted an emergency procedure in an aircraft cabin simulator. The experimental group used the job performance aid and the control group did not. The findings of this study indicated that: (a) the development of a conceptual model was an important factor in the development of a procedural model, (b) project analysis was a critical step in job performance aid design for <b>high-risk</b> <b>environments,</b> (c) the job performance aid improved performance, and (d) training was an important consideration for job aid design and that it was an important factor in job aid implementation into <b>high-risk</b> <b>environments.</b> The study discussed modeling, the role of imagination, and implementation considerations for the successful creation and use of job performance aids. It was argued that it was necessary to identify and explore the variables that influenced job performance aid design. Furthermore, it was argued that imagination took a new role in job performance aid design which included the prediction of potential design errors. And, it was argued that training was a necessary ingredient for successful implementation of job performance aids in <b>high-risk</b> <b>environments.</b> Based on the findings of this study, recommendations were made to practitioners in the field and recommendations were made to researchers for areas that warranted future study...|$|R

40|$|In sub-Saharan Africa, {{truck drivers}} and fisherfolk are two mobile populations that are disproportionately {{affected}} by the HIV/AIDS epidemic. What individual behaviors or structural environments influence these populations’ vulnerability to HIV/AIDS? After reviewing truckers’ and fisherfolks’ sexual behaviors through primary epidemiological studies and comparing them {{to those of the}} general population through Demographic Health Surveys, I found that truck drivers and fisherfolk have multiple sex partners and high rates of commercial sex which increase their vulnerability to HIV/AIDS. But they exhibit safer sex practices than the general population, proving that individual sexual behaviors cannot solely explain their sustained HIV/AIDS vulnerability. It is important to recognize the <b>high-risk</b> structural <b>environments</b> in which they are embedded; this includes fish-for-sex transactions for fisherfolk and lengthy border delays for truckers. I conclude that <b>high-risk</b> <b>environments</b> are more important than individual behaviors in explaining both truck drivers’ and fisherfolks’ vulnerability to HIV/AIDS. It is only by focusing on these structural factors that public health programs will decrease these populations’ vulnerability to HIV/AIDS...|$|R
