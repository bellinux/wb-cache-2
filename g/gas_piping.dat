25|$|Aerodynamics is {{important}} {{in a number of}} applications other than aerospace engineering. It is a significant factor in any type of vehicle design, including automobiles. It {{is important}} in the prediction of forces and moments acting on sailing vessels. It is used in the design of mechanical components such as hard drive heads. Structural engineers also use aerodynamics, and particularly aeroelasticity, to calculate wind loads in the design of large buildings and bridges. Urban aerodynamics seeks to help town planners and designers improve comfort in outdoor spaces, create urban microclimates and reduce the effects of urban pollution. The field of environmental aerodynamics describes the ways atmospheric circulation and flight mechanics affect ecosystems. The aerodynamics of internal passages {{is important in}} heating/ventilation, <b>gas</b> <b>piping,</b> and in automotive engines where detailed flow patterns strongly affect the performance of the engine.|$|E

50|$|In August 1933 {{the works}} on {{construction}} of <b>gas</b> supply <b>piping</b> from Zagłębie Lwowskie and Krośnieńskie to Mościce were started. The investment {{was a part}} of the gasification program for the Central Industrial District. The works connected with supplying gas to Mościce were completed in 1937. At first, gas was used to burn boilers of the power plant in the factory, which contributed to decrease in transport and coal storage costs. Next, the tests of methane decomposition in generators were conducted. Upon achievement of positive results, the hydrogen content in raw gas increased, which contributed to the increase in ammonia production by ca. 10% in Mościce. It also initiated the start of using natural as the primary material, at the same time, decreasing the production costs. At the end of 30’s of XX c. the ammonia production in factory in Mościce was based on gas obtained from the generators gasifying coke and, additionally, two generators adjusted to gasifying coke and methane.|$|R
