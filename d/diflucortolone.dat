40|$|Infantile digital fibromatosis (IDF) {{is a rare}} benign fibroproliferative tumor {{of early}} childhood. IDF {{preferentially}} affects the fingers and the toes. Malignant transformation or metastases habe never been reported. Surgical treatment has been advocated previously but local recurrences were frequently observed. Recent literature supports clinical surveilllance without any medical or surgical intervention as spontaneous regression usually occurs after two to three years. A six-month-old Caucasian girl with IDF on the left fourth digit is presented here. The tumor progressively increased in size after birth. Topical imiquimod cream and <b>diflucortolone</b> valerate cream, both displaying antifibrotic properties, {{had no effect on}} tumor growth. Currently, the lesion size remains stable without any treatment. Early recognition of IDF is important in order to avoid unnecessary surgical intervention that may prove to be potentially aggravating, unless serious functional or cosmetic concerns intervene.

40|$|Dorsal skin {{reactions}} to continuous topical treatment with {{different types of}} corticosteroids were histologically investigated in hairless descendants of Mexican hairless dogs. The preparations tested were prednisolone (ST- 1; weak), fluocinolone acetonide (ST- 2; moderate), <b>diflucortolone</b> valrerate (ST- 3; strong), and mometasone furoate (ST- 4; very strong). Grossly, the sites treated with ST- 3 and ST- 4 showed moderate inflammatory reactions. After completion of the corticosteroid treatment, both sites were less pigmented and had a thin texture. The severity of histologic changes in the skin was dependent on {{the efficacy of the}} corticosteroids. The epidermis was prominently thinned from 1 wk after treatment with the corticosteroids, resulting in a flat dermis-epidermis junction.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} whether “natural creams” sold for treatment of childhood atopic eczema illegally contain corticosteroids with a newly developed rapid and simple HPLC analysis with UV detection. Material and Methods: HPLC analysis was performed using a Schimadzu LC- 2010 chromatographic system (Schimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) consisting of a LC- 20 AT Prominence liquid chromatography pump with DGU- 20 A 5 Prominence degasser, a SPD-M 20 A Prominence Diode Array Detector, and a SIL- 20 AC Prominence auto sampler. Data analyses were done using Class VP 7. 3 Software. The elution was carried out on a column Purospher STAR® RP 18 e (250 x 4. 6 mm i. d., particle size 5 m), with a mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile and water in a gradient mode, at a flow rate of 1. 0 mL min- 1, at controlled column temperature (25 oC). Detection of nine different corticosteroids (dexamethasone, prednisolone, methylprednisolone, fluocortolone, hydrocortisone, mometasone, betamethasone, beclomethasone, and <b>diflucortolone)</b> was carried out with DAD detector at a wavelength of 240 nm. The injection volume was 10 μl. The samples were five different creams sold for the treatment of childhood atopic eczema (marketed as steroid free) and were submitted by the state regulatory authority, Bureau of the medicines. Results: The method was fully validated according to the ICH (International Conference on Harmonization) guidelines by the determination of linearity, precision, and accuracy, limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ). Selectivity of the method was proved with the chromatographic peak resolution obtained between each of the nine different corticosteroids and the characteristic UV spectra. Linearity of the method was tested in the range of 0. 4 – 8 μg mL- 1 for all substances analyzed. Experimental data showed high level of linearity for all corticosteroids (R 2 = 0. 9981 for <b>diflucortolone,</b> R 2 = 0. 9985 for methylprednisolone, R 2 = 0. 9992 for betametason, R 2 = 1. 0 for dexamethasone, prednisolone, fluocortolone, hydrocortisone, mometason, and beclomethasone). The high sensitivity of the method was demonstrated by the values obtained for the limit of detection for the corticosteroids tested.

For topical administration, they are usually incorporated into gel or cream to increase their residence time, which is time-consuming process and could affect their stability and characteristics. Preparation of solid lipid nanoparticles based semisolid formulations could have potential pharmaceutical applications. The {{aim of this study}} was to formulate the corticosteroidal drug, <b>diflucortolone</b> valerate (DFV) into topical semisolid SLN formulations using a rapid cheap one-step process. SLN formulations were developed using a high-shear homogenization combined with sonication, using different types of solid lipids (e. g., Geleol®, Precirol® ATO 5, Tristearin® and Compritol® 888 ATO) and Poloxamer® 407 as a surfactant. Selection of the lipids and using high lipid concentration were the key elements to get semisolid formulation immediately after sonication without incorporating the nanoparticles into a gel or a cream base. DFV SLN formulations possessed average particle size ranging from 203. 71 ± 5. 61 to 1421. 00 ± 16. 32 nm with a narrow size distribution and possessed shear thinning behavior. Incorporation of lipid based surfactants (Labrasol® or Labrafil®) was found to significantly increase DFV encapsulation efficiency (up to 45. 79 ± 4. 40 %).

Drug-loaded lecithin/chitosan nanoparticles with high entrapment efficiency (86. 8 %), were successfully prepared by ionic interaction technique. Sustained release of DFV was achieved without any initial burst release. Nanoparticles were also incorporated into chitosan gel at different ratios for preparing a more suitable formulation for topical drug delivery with adequate viscosity. In ex-vivo permeation studies, nanoparticles increased the accumulation of DFV especially in the stratum corneum + epidermis of rat skin without any significant permeation. Retention of DFV from nanoparticle in chitosan gel formulation (0. 01 %) was twofold higher than commercial cream, although it contained ten times less DFV. Nanoparticles in gel formulations produced significantly higher edema inhibition in rats compared with commercial cream in in-vivo studies. Skin blanching assay using a chromameter showed vasoconstriction similar to that of the commercial product. There were no barrier function changes upon application of nanoparticles. In-vitro and in-vivo results demonstrated that lecithin/chitosan nanoparticles in chitosan gel may be a promising carrier for dermal delivery of DFV in various skin disorders.

40|$|ABSTRACTUsing a murine model, topical {{application}} of glucocorticoid ([GC], 50 μg <b>diflucortolone</b> valerate in ethanol) on a sensitized site (flank skin) for 7 times before and 2 times after sensitization on alternate days, augmented expression of contact sensitivity reactions on the challenged site (ear skin). This augmentation {{was due to}} the systemic effect of percutaneously absorbed GC, because topical GC also augmented the skin reaction in mice that had been sensitized on a separate site from that of the GC application. In contrast, {{topical application}} of GC inhibited the contact sensitivity skin reaction when applied on the challenged sites. Intraperitoneal injection of the same dose of GC also failed to augment the skin reactions. Glucocorticoid augmented the contact sensitivity skin reactions and these persisted for 96 h after the control skin reactions subsided. Early phase (1 – 6 h) skin reactions were also induced or augmented when dinitrofluorobenzene or trinitrochlorobenzene but not oxazolone were used as the sensitizer; GC also augmented the non-specific reactions to croton oil or to suboptimal concentration of hapten in normal mice. The numbers of Langerhans cells (LC) were reduced in both the GC-application and challenged sites. Haptenated LC from GC-treated skin showed a rather weak sensitizing ability, which was not statistically significant. Transfer of lymph node cells and/or spleen cells or serum from GC-pre-treated mice failed to induce a contact sensitivity reaction in normal recipient mice. These results suggest that topical GC might augment cutaneous inflammation through a possible modulation of local cytokine production, regardless of the number of LC or the presence of sensitized lymphocytes...|$|E
