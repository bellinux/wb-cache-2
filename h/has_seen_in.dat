500|$|In 2014, CIM {{began moving}} forward with adding a rental {{residential}} tower atop Block 37. In March 2014, rumors began that an apartment building exceeding 500 units was being planned. On September 11, CIM issued a press release that it had obtained permits for a 34-story, 690-unit apartment tower, which Crain's Chicago Business described as [...] "the biggest apartment tower the Loop <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> decades".

The theatre is Chicago's first Dine-In Theatre in which patrons order food by the touch of a button from their seats.
