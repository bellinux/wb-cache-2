Methodology/Principal Findings: Cross-sectional serological, coprological and demographic data were obtained from the 2004 nationwide periodic epidemiologic survey for Hunan Province. Environmental data were downloaded from the USGS <b>EROS</b> <b>data</b> <b>centre.</b> Bayesian geostatistical models were employed for spatial analysis of the infection prevalence among study participants. A total of 47, 139 participants from 47 administrative villages were selected. Age, sex and occupation of residents and the presence of infected buffaloes and environmental factors, i. e. NDVI, distance to the lake and endemic type of setting, were significantly associated with S. japonicum infection prevalence. After taking into account spatial correlation, however, only demographic factors (age, sex and occupation) and the presence of infected buffaloes remained significant indicators.

40|$|Abstract- Computing {{today is}} used to migrate from hosting {{services}} using servers {{owned and operated by}} individual organizations to large-scale <b>data</b> <b>centres</b> which provide resources on-demand to different organizations using a shared infrastructure. One commonly used form of such on-demand computing, is an Infrastructure as a Service (Iaas) cloud, which provides low level access to virtualized resources. Scalable and qualitative management of these <b>data</b> <b>centres</b> is becoming {{one of the most important}} challenges (to achieve) because the scale of <b>data</b> <b>centres</b> is becoming larger. Centralized management can make good load balancing in small <b>data</b> <b>centres,</b> but if <b>data</b> <b>centres</b> grow in size, centralized management systems perform badly due to the bad scalability of this type of solutions. A possible solution is fully-distributed management which improves scalability. However, this type of management loses the complete view of the <b>data</b> <b>centre</b> state, so it is more difficult to make a good global load balancing. In this paper, we evaluate a hierarchical management solution which consists in organizing the hosts of the <b>data</b> <b>centre</b> in tree form. This solution has better scalability than centralized solutions, and has better <b>data</b> <b>centre</b> overview than fully-distributed solutions. As experimenting with real physical <b>data</b> <b>centres</b> is impractical, simulation can be used to analyze, in a rapid way, the behavior of <b>data</b> <b>centres</b> using different management approaches. Through the help of an IaaS simulator called DCSim, we created a framework for analyzing <b>data</b> <b>centre</b> performances using hierarchical management techniques...|$|R
