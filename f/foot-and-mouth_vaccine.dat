40|$|Binding of {{foot-and-mouth disease}} virus (FMDV) to cells {{requires}} an arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) sequence in the capsid protein VP 1. We have genetically engineered an FMDV in which these three amino acids have been deleted, producing a virus particle which is unable to bind to cells. Cattle vaccinated with these receptor binding site-deleted virions were protected from disease when challenged with a virulent virus, demonstrating that these RGD-deleted viruses could {{serve as the basis}} for <b>foot-and-mouth</b> disease <b>vaccines</b> safer than those currently in use. This strategy may prove useful in the development of vaccines for other viral diseases. Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), which comprises the Aphthovirus genus of the family Picornaviridae, causes a devastating disease of livestock (2, 18).

40|$|The {{adaptation}} of the pig kidney cell line IB-RS- 2, clone 60, to growth in suspension culture is described. When fully adapted, an approximate threefold increase in viable cells was obtained within 72 hr from initial cell concentrations of 5 × 105 per ml in culture volumes up to 1, 500 ml. The monolayer cells (99 th passage level) used to initiate the suspension cultures and the fully adapted suspension cells were shown to have an aneuploid chromosome karyotype, whereas earlier monolayer cultures (32 nd passage level) had a pseudodiploid karyotype. Replicate virus titrations in monolayers prepared from suspension-adapted cells, IB-RS- 2 monolayer cells, BHK monolayer cells, and in suckling mice showed that the suspension cells had retained sensitivity to foot-and-mouth disease virus. The geometric mean peak infectivity of seven strains of foot-and-mouth disease virus grown in IB-RS- 2 suspension cells was 108. 2 plaque-forming units per ml, with a mean complement-fixing activity of approximately 135 complement-fixing units per ml.

40|$|We have rationally {{engineered}} {{foot-and-mouth disease}} virus to increase its stability against thermal dissociation into subunits without disrupting the many biological functions needed for its infectivity. Amino acid side chains located near the capsid intersubunit interfaces and either predicted or found to be dispensable for infectivity were replaced by others that could establish new disulfide bonds or electrostatic interactions between subunits. Two engineered viruses were normally infectious, genetically stable, and antigenically indistinguishable from the natural virus but showed substantially increased stability against irreversible dissociation. Electrostatic interactions mediated this stabilizing effect. For {{foot-and-mouth disease virus}} and other viruses, some evidence had suggested that an increase in virion stability could be linked to an impairment of infectivity. The {{results of the present}} study show, in fact, that virion thermostability against dissociation into subunits may not be selectively constrained by functional requirements for infectivity. The thermostable viruses obtained, and others similarly engineered, could be used for the production, using current procedures, of <b>foot-and-mouth</b> disease <b>vaccines</b> that are less dependent on a faultless cold chain.

40|$|There {{has been}} much debate {{about the use of}} the {{so-called}} ¿vaccinate-to-live¿ policy for the control of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in Europe, according to which, spread of the FMD virus (FMDV) from future outbreaks could be controlled by a short period of ¿emergency¿ vaccination of surrounding herds, reducing the need for large-scale pre-emptive culling of at-risk animals. Since vaccinated animals may become subclinically infected with FMDV following challenge exposure, it is necessary to either remove all vaccinates (vaccinate-to-kill) or to detect and remove vaccinates in which virus is circulating or has established persistent infections (vaccinate-to-live), in order to rapidly regain the most favoured trading status of FMD-free without vaccination. The latter approach can be supported by testing vaccinated animals for the presence of antibodies to certain non-structural proteins (NSP) of FMDV, which are induced by infection with the virus, but not by vaccination with purified FMD vaccines. Using test sensitivity and specificity data established at a recent workshop on NSP assays [Brocchi E, Bergmann I, Dekker A, Paton DJ, Sammin DJ, Greiner M, et al. Comparative performance of six ELISAs for antibodies to the non-structural proteins of <b>foot-and-mouth</b> disease. <b>Vaccine,</b> in press], this paper examines the ways in which serological testing with NSP ELISAs can be used and interpreted and the effect that this will have on the confidence with which freedom from infection can be demonstrated within guidelines specified by the World Animal Health Organisation and the European Commission...|$|R

Reaginic antibodies demonstrated by passive cutaneous anaphylaxis in goats, were directed against BHK 21 cell extracts (20), hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (3) and an unidentified vaccine component (3), and distributed in 0, 5, 19 and 75 per cent of the cattle vaccinated 0, 1, 2 and 3 times. None of the animals showed clinical signs of allergy after vaccination. When BHK 21 cell extract was injected intradermally a significant correlation was noted between the development of large weals {{and the presence of}} reagins although the size of the weals was not correlated with the reagin titres. In the case of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose a similar trend was evident. The majority of cattle with large dermal weals possessed reagins but the number of reactions was too small for statistical evaluation. Dermal reactions to sodium penicillin, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, saponin and whole vaccine occurred in both unvaccinated and vaccinated cattle but BHK 21 cell lysate and normal bovine serum provoked weals which increased in frequency according to the number of vaccinations experienced.

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of an inactivated <b>foot-and-mouth</b> disease (FMD) <b>vaccine</b> is mainly {{dependent on the}} integrity of the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) particles. At present, the standard method to quantify the active component, the 146 S antigen, of FMD vaccines is sucrose density gradient (SDG) analysis. However, this method is highly operator dependent and difficult to automate. In contrast, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is a time-saving technique that provides greater simplicity and sensitivity. To establish a valid method to detect and quantify the 146 S antigen of a serotype O FMD vaccine, a double-antibody sandwich (DAS) ELISA was compared with an SDG analysis. The DAS ELISA was highly correlated with the SDG method (R 2 = 0. 9215, P< 0. 01). In contrast to the SDG method, the DAS ELISA was rapid, robust, repeatable and highly sensitive, with a minimum quantification limit of 0. 06 μg/mL. This method can be used to determine the effective antigen yields in inactivated vaccines and thus represents an alternative for assessing the potency of FMD vaccines in vitro. But it still needs to be prospectively validated by analyzing a new vaccine preparation and determining the proper protective dose followed by an in vivo vaccination-challenge study to confirm the ELISA findings...|$|R

Due to underreporting of FMD, the current strains circulating throughout sub-Saharan Africa are in many cases unknown. For SAT 1, SAT 2, and serotype A viruses, the genetic diversity is reflected in antigenic variation, and indications are that vaccine strains may be needed for each topotype. This has serious implications for control using vaccines and for choice of strains to include in regional antigen banks. The epidemiology is further {{complicated by the fact that}} SAT 1, SAT 2, and SAT 3 viruses are maintained and spread by wildlife, persistently infecting African buffalo in particular. Although the precise mechanism of transmission of FMD from buffalo to cattle is not well understood, it is facilitated by direct contact between these two species. Once cattle are infected they may maintain SAT infections without the further involvement of buffalo. No single strategy for control of FMD in Africa is applicable. Decision on the most effective regional control strategy should focus on an ecosystem approach, identification of primary endemic areas, animal husbandry practices, climate, and animal movement. Within each ecosystem, human behavior could be integrated in disease control planning. Different regions in sub-Saharan Africa are at different developmental stages and are thus facing unique challenges and priorities in terms of veterinary disease control. Many science-based options targeting improved vaccinology, diagnostics, and other control measures have been described. This review therefore aims to emphasize, on one hand, the progress that has been achieved in the development of new technologies, including research towards improved tailored vaccines, appropriate vaccine strain selection, vaccine potency, and diagnostics, and how it relates to the conditions in Africa. On the other hand, we focus on the unique epidemiological, ecological, livestock farming and marketing, socioeconomic, and governance issues that constrain effective FMD control. Any such new technologies should have the availability of safe livestock products for trade as the ultimate goal.

40|$|Inactivated {{whole virus}} <b>foot-and-mouth</b> disease (FMD) <b>vaccines</b> are used {{worldwide}} for protection against FMD, {{but not all}} vaccines induce protection against all genetic variants of the same FMD virus serotype. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate whether the “breadth” of the antibody response against different strains of the same FMD virus serotype in cattle could be improved by using a different adjuvant, a mix of antigens and/or different routes of administration. To this end, six groups of five cattle were vaccinated with different FMD virus serotype A strain vaccines formulated with Montanide ISA 206 VG adjuvant. Antibody responses for homologous and heterologous cross-reactivity against a panel of 10 different FMD virus serotype A strains were tested by a liquid-phase blocking ELISA. Results of cattle vaccinated with ISA 206 VG adjuvanted vaccine were compared with results obtained in a previous study using aluminium hydroxide-saponin adjuvant. No significant effect of adjuvant on the breadth of the antibody response was observed, neither for mixing of antigens nor for the route of administration (subcutaneous vs. intradermal). Comparison of antigen payload, however, increased both homologous and heterologous titres; a 10 -fold higher antigen dose resulted in approximately four times higher titres against all tested strains. Our study shows that breadth of the antibody response depends mainly on the vaccine strain; we therefore propose that, for vaccine preparation, only FMD virus strains are selected that, among other important characteristics, will induce a wide antibody response to different field strains...|$|R

Clinical disease was apparent only in the animal given A 12 -IC and euthanized at 72 hpe. In situ hybridization revealed that the animal infected with A 12 -IC and euthanized at 24 hpe had abundant viral nucleic acid in the lung, present in clusters of positive cells in the respiratory bronchiolar epithelium and associated subepithelial regions. At 72 hpe in the A 12 -IC-infected calf, viral nucleic acid in the lung was present in interstitial areas, and in addition, viral nucleic acid was detectable in epithelial tissues around histologically apparent vesicles. In animals infected with A 12 -LLV 2, viral nucleic acid was detectable in the lung at both 24 and 72 hpe, but staining revealed a more localized distribution with less nucleic acid than was found in animals given A 12 -IC. Therefore, it appears that after aerosol exposure to A 12 -IC, early replication is {{in the region of}} the lung, with subsequent dissemination to distal sites.

Findings were used to identify priority areas for future FMD vaccine research. Vaccines {{play a vital role in}} FMD control, used both to limit the spread of the virus during epidemics in FMD-free countries and as the mainstay of disease management in endemic regions, particularly where sanitary controls are difficult to apply. Improvements in the performance or cost-effectiveness of FMD vaccines will allow more widespread and efficient disease control. FMD vaccines have changed little in recent decades, typically produced by inactivation of whole virus, the quantity and stability of the intact viral capsids in the final preparation being key for immunogenicity. However, these are exciting times and several promising novel FMD vaccine candidates have recently been developed. This includes the first FMD vaccine licensed for manufacture and use in the USA; this adenovirus-vectored FMD vaccine causes in vivo expression of viral capsids in vaccinated animals. Another promising vaccine candidate comprises stabilized empty FMDV capsids produced in vitro in a baculovirus expression system. Recombinant technologies are also being developed to improve otherwise conventionally produced inactivated vaccines, for example, by creating a chimeric vaccine virus to increase capsid stability and by inserting sequences into the vaccine virus for desired antigen expression. Other important areas of ongoing research include enhanced adjuvants, vaccine quality control procedures and predicting vaccine protection from immune correlates, thus reducing dependency on animal challenge studies. Globally, the degree of independent vaccine evaluation is highly variable, and this is essential for vaccine quality.

To assess the relevance of B-cell epitope multivalency, dendrimers bearing two (B 2 T) or four (B 4 T) copies of the B-cell epitope from type O FMDV (a widespread circulating serotype) were tested in CD 1 mice and showed that multivalency is advantageous over simple B-T-epitope juxtaposition, resulting in efficient induction of neutralizing antibodies and optimal release of IFN γ. Interestingly, the bivalent B 2 T construction elicited similar or even better B- and T-cell specific responses than tetravalent B 4 T. In addition, {{the presence of the}} T-cell epitope and its orientation were shown to be critical for the immunogenicity of the linear juxtaposed monovalent peptides analyzed in parallel.

40|$|The {{foot-and-mouth disease}} virus (FMDV) capsid protein precursor, P 1 - 2 A, is cleaved by 3 Cpro to {{generate}} VP 0, VP 3, VP 1, and the peptide 2 A. The capsid proteins self-assemble into empty capsid particles or viruses which do not contain 2 A. In a cell cul-ture-adapted strain of FMDV (O 1 Manisa [Lindholm]), three different amino acid substitutions (E 83 K, S 134 C, and K 210 E) were identified within the VP 1 region of the P 1 - 2 A precursor compared to the field strain (wild type [wt]). Expression of the O 1 Manisa P 1 - 2 A (wt or with the S 134 C substitution in VP 1) plus 3 Cpro, using a transient expression system, resulted in efficient capsid protein production and self-assembly of empty capsid particles. Removal of the 2 A peptide from the capsid protein pre-cursor {{had no effect on}} capsid protein processing or particle assembly. However, modification of E 83 K alone abrogated particle assembly with no apparent effect on protein processing. Interestingly, the K 210 E substitution, close to the VP 1 / 2 A junction, completely blocked processing by 3 Cpro at this cleavage site, but efficient assembly of “self-tagged ” empty capsid particles, con-taining the uncleaved VP 1 - 2 A, was observed. These self-tagged particles behaved like the unmodified empty capsids in antigen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and integrin receptor binding assays. Furthermore, mutant viruses with uncleaved VP 1 - 2 A could be rescued in cells from full-length FMDV RNA transcripts encoding the K 210 E substitution in VP 1.
