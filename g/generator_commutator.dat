40|$|AbstractThe paper {{continues}} {{the study of}} the orthogonal group of a free symmetric inner product space V over a full ring R which was initiated in [4]. If 2 and 3 are units in R and V has dimension 3 or ⩾ 5 and hyperbolic rank ⩾ 1, then the normal subgroups of the orthogonal group of V lie between congruence subgroups. This paper also examines the theory of the special orthogonal group SO(V) of a symmetric inner product space V over a full ring R with 2 a unit. If V has hyperbolic rank ⩾ 1 and dimension ⩾ 3, we determine <b>generators,</b> <b>commutator</b> subgroups and the special congruence subgroups.

5000|$|The {{origins of}} {{electromechanical}} inverters explain {{the source of}} the term inverter. Early AC-to-DC converters used an induction or synchronous AC motor direct-connected to a generator (dynamo) so that the <b>generator's</b> <b>commutator</b> reversed its connections at exactly the right moments to produce DC. A later development is the synchronous converter, in which the motor and generator windings are combined into one armature, with slip rings at one end and a commutator at the other and only one field frame. The result with either is AC-in, DC-out. With an M-G set, the DC can be considered to be separately generated from the AC; with a synchronous converter, in a certain sense it can be considered to be [...] "mechanically rectified AC". Given the right auxiliary and control equipment, an M-G set or rotary converter can be [...] "run backwards", converting DC to AC. Hence an inverter is an inverted converter.|$|R

50|$|Commutators {{are used}} in direct current (DC) machines: dynamos (DC generators) and many DC motors as well as {{universal}} motors. In a motor the commutator applies electric current to the windings. By reversing the current direction in the rotating windings each half turn, a steady rotating force (torque) is produced. In a <b>generator</b> the <b>commutator</b> picks off the current generated in the windings, reversing {{the direction of the}} current with each half turn, serving as a mechanical rectifier to convert the alternating current from the windings to unidirectional direct current in the external load circuit.

40|$|In a {{classical}} educational approach the DC <b>commutator</b> <b>generator</b> {{is presented in}} the schematic form, as given in Fig. 1, and run of its electromotive force- in Fig. 2. The DC <b>commutator</b> <b>generator</b> is consisted of: − the motionless stator which can be schematically presented in the form of pair of permanent magnets (Fig. 1, where: „N” – north pole, „S ” – south pole), producing constant magnetic field of B intensity and the sense from „N ” to „S” − the rotor rotated with ω 2 velocity by an external mechanical force. On the rotor winding turns are winded in which the electromotive force e, (EMF), is induced. The force can be described as follows: e = ⏐k · B · sin(ω 2 t) ⏐ (1) where: k – design coefficient of a given generator B – magnetic field intensity ω 2 – instantaneous angular velocity of generator rotor − the commutator, i. e. the ring fastened on the rotor and made of a conductive material.

40|$|The {{low-energy}} {{physics of}} systems with spontaneous symmetry breaking {{is governed by}} the associated Nambu-Goldstone (NG) bosons. While NG bosons in Lorentz-invariant systems are well understood, the precise characterization of their number and dispersion relations in a general quantum many-body system is still an open problem. An inequality relating the number of NG bosons and their dispersion relations {{to the number of}} broken symmetry generators was found by Nielsen and Chadha. In this paper, we give a presumably first example of a system in which the Nielsen-Chadha inequality is actually not saturated.

From the onset of the electrical grid, electrified populations have been exposed to dirty electricity. Diesel generator sets are a major source of dirty electricity today and are used almost universally to electrify small islands and places unreachable by the conventional electric grid.

40|$|The {{concept of}} a C-approximable group, for a class of finite groups C, is a common {{generalization}} of the concepts of a sofic, weakly sofic, and linear sofic group. Glebsky raised the question whether all groups are approximable by finite solvable groups with arbitrary invariant length function. We answer this question by showing that any non-trivial finitely generated perfect group does not have this property, generalizing a counterexample of Howie. Moreover, we discuss the question which connected Lie groups can be embedded into a metric ultraproduct of finite groups with invariant length function. We prove that these are precisely the abelian ones, providing a negative {{answer to a question}} of Doucha. Referring to a problem of Zilber, we show that a the identity component of a Lie group, whose topology is generated by an invariant length function and which is an abstract quotient of a product of finite groups, has to be abelian. Both of these last two facts give an alternative proof of a result of Turing. Finally, we solve a conjecture of Pillay by proving that the identity component of a compactification of a pseudofinite group must be abelian as well.

50|$|Automotive alternators {{require a}} voltage {{regulator}} which operates by modulating the small field current to produce a constant voltage at the battery terminals. Early designs (c.1960s-1970s) used a discrete device mounted elsewhere in the vehicle. Intermediate designs (c.1970s-1990s) incorporated the voltage regulator into the alternator housing. Modern designs {{do away with the}} voltage regulator altogether; voltage regulation is now a function of the electronic control unit (ECU). The field current is much smaller than the output current of the alternator; for example, a 70 A alternator may need only 7 A of field current. The field current is supplied to the rotor windings by slip rings. The low current and relatively smooth slip rings ensure greater reliability and longer life than that obtained by a DC <b>generator</b> with its <b>commutator</b> and higher current being passed through its brushes.|$|R
50|$|A {{commutator}} {{consists of}} a set of contact bars fixed to the rotating shaft of a machine, and connected to the armature windings. As the shaft rotates, the commutator reverses the flow of current in a winding. For a single armature winding, when the shaft has made one-half complete turn, the winding is now connected so that current flows through it in the opposite of the initial direction. In a motor, the armature current causes the fixed magnetic field to exert a rotational force, or a torque, on the winding to make it turn. In a generator, the mechanical torque applied to the shaft maintains the motion of the armature winding through the stationary magnetic field, inducing a current in the winding. In both the motor and <b>generator</b> case, the <b>commutator</b> periodically reverses the direction of current flow through the winding so that current flow in the circuit external to the machine continues in only one direction.|$|R

Introduction Let Γ = hA; Bi be a two-generator subgroup of PSL(2; C). We study the following question: when Γ is discrete?

40|$|Let Φ be {{a reduced}} {{irreducible}} root system of rank > 2, let R be a commutative ring and let I,J be two ideals of R. In {{the present paper}} we describe <b>generators</b> of the <b>commutator</b> groups of relative elementary subgroups [E(Φ,R,I),E(Φ,R,J) ] both as normal subgroups of the elementary Chevalley group E(Φ,R), and as groups. Namely, let x_(ξ), ∈Φ, ξ∈ R, be an elementary generator of E(Φ,R). As a normal subgroup of the absolute elementary group E(Φ,R), the relative elementary subgroup is generated by x_(ξ), ∈Φ, ξ∈ I. Classical results due to Michael Stein, Jacques Tits and Leonid Vaserstein assert that as a group E(Φ,R,I) is generated by z_(ξ,η), where ∈Φ, ξ∈ I, η∈ R. In the present paper, we prove the following birelative analogues of these results. As a normal subgroup of E(Φ,R) the relative commutator subgroup [E(Φ,R,I),E(Φ,R,J) ] is generated by the following three types of generators: i) [x_α(ξ),z_α(ζ,η) ], ii) [x_α(ξ),x_-α(ζ) ], and iii) x_α(ξζ), where α∈Φ, ξ∈ I, ζ∈ J, η∈ R. As a group, the generators are essentially the same, only that type iii) should be enlarged to iv) z_α(ξζ,η). For classical groups, these results, with much more computational proofs, were established in previous papers by the authors. There is already an amazing application of these results, namely in the recent work of Alexei Stepanov on relative commutator width...|$|R
5000|$|The first long-distance {{transmission}} of electric power was demonstrated using direct current in 1882 at Miesbach-Munich Power Transmission, but only 1.5 kW was transmitted. An early method of high-voltage DC transmission {{was developed by}} the Swiss engineer René Thury and his method was put into practice by 1889 in Italy by the Acquedotto De Ferrari-Galliera company. This system used series-connected motor-generator sets to increase the voltage. Each set was insulated from electrical ground and driven by insulated shafts from a prime mover. The transmission line was operated in a 'constant current' mode, with up to 5,000 volts across each machine, some machines having double commutators to reduce the voltage on each commutator. This system transmitted 630 kW at 14 kV DC over a distance of 120 km. The Moutiers-Lyon system transmitted 8,600 kW of hydroelectric power a distance of 200 km, including 10 km of underground cable. This system used eight series-connected <b>generators</b> with dual <b>commutators</b> for a total voltage of 150,000 volts between the positive and negative poles, and operated from c.1906 until 1936.

40|$|The {{classical}} Kepler-Coulomb {{system in}} 3 dimensions {{is well known}} to be 2 nd order superintegrable, with a symmetry algebra that closes polynomially under Poisson brackets. This polynomial closure is typical for 2 nd order superintegrable systems in 2 D and for 2 nd order systems in 3 D with nondegenerate (4 -parameter) potentials. However the degenerate 3 -parameter potential for the 3 D extended Kepler-Coulomb system (also 2 nd order superintegrable) is an exception, as its quadratic symmetry algebra doesn't close polynomially. The 3 D 4 -parameter potential for the extended Kepler-Coulomb system is not even 2 nd order superintegrable. However, Verrier and Evans (2008) showed it was 4 th order superintegrable, and Tanoudis and Daskaloyannis (2011) showed that in the quantum case, if a second 4 th order symmetry {{is added to the}} <b>generators,</b> the double <b>commutators</b> in the symmetry algebra close polynomially. Here, based on the Tremblay, Turbiner and Winternitz construction, we consider an infinite class of classical extended Kepler-Coulomb 3 - and 4 -parameter systems indexed by a pair of rational numbers $(k_ 1,k_ 2) $ and reducing to the usual systems when $k_ 1 =k_ 2 = 1 $. We show these systems to be superintegrable of arbitrarily high order and work out explicitly the structure of the symmetry algebras determined by the 5 basis generators we have constructed. We demonstrate that the symmetry algebras close rationally; only for systems admitting extra discrete symmetries is polynomial closure achieved. Underlying the structure theory is the existence of raising and lowering constants of the motion, not themselves polynomials in the momenta, that can be employed to construct the polynomial symmetries and their structure relations...|$|R
