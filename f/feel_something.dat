25|$|Although {{there are}} many {{contributing}} factors and risks associated with strokes, {{there are very few}} associated with Dejerine–Roussy syndrome and thalamic lesions specifically. In general, strokes damage one hemisphere of the brain, which can include the thalamus. The thalamus is generally believed to relay sensory information between a variety of subcortical areas and the cerebral cortex. It is known that sensory information from environmental stimuli travels to the thalamus for processing and then to the somatosensory cortex for interpretation. The final product of this communication is the ability to see, hear or <b>feel</b> <b>something</b> as interpreted by the brain. Dejerine–Roussy syndrome most often compromises tactile sensation. Therefore, the damage in the thalamus causes miscommunication between the afferent pathway and the cortex of the brain, changing what or how one feels. The change could be an incorrect sensation experienced, or inappropriate amplification or dulling of a sensation. Because the brain is considered plastic and each individual's brain is different, {{it is almost impossible to}} know how a sensation will be changed without brain mapping and individual consultation.|$|E

Sundsbø had been hired by fashion magazine Dazed & Confused in the late 1990s to produce a shot with a [...] "technological <b>feel,</b> <b>something</b> all white", according to himself. As an artist, Sundsbø attempted to do a unique original piece, creating a shot {{that had never been}} seen before; He suggested taking shots using a three-dimensional scanning machine to fulfil his vision.|$|E

Most of the sentiments are understated, and Burshtein avoided having any of the characters break down or openly become angry when pressured. Yaron described a scene between Yochay and Rivka as her favorite, saying, [...] "I think it's {{because there is so much}} pain there; it touches you the most when people <b>feel</b> <b>something</b> and try to hide it and you see it." ...|$|E

500|$|Erik Adams of The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} episode a [...] "C+" [...] {{and felt that}} the finale scene, while set up to be emotional, was [...] "hollow". He argued that the tension does not feel as {{threatening}} as it should; he compared it to the second season episode [...] "Casino Night", which had invoked real fears {{about the future of}} Jim and Pam. He summed up: [...] "I wish the final scene of 'Paper Airplane' made me <b>feel</b> <b>something</b> deeper." [...] Adams also was not impressed with the Dwight-Angela storyline, but was [...] "enjoying Andy's day on the industrial-safety film—much more so than [...] anticipated" [...] due to the [...] "unintentional hilarity" [...] that ensued.|$|E
500|$|According to Ocean, {{the music}} video for [...] "Novacane" [...] {{was a simple}} process. Talking about {{the concept of the}} video, he stated [...] "I was just trying to connect or {{articulate}} visually the feeling of being numb. The feeling of wanting to <b>feel</b> <b>something</b> you can't feel. A lot of things can cause that numbing, but in the video it was some sort of topical aesthetic {{and a little bit of}} special effects." [...] The video doesn't last the entirety of the song, which director Nabil Elderkin stated was for artistic reasons. In an interview with Pitchfork, he reasoned [...] "to me, videos don't always have to be the length of the song. I like the idea of people thinking, 'What was that?'" ...|$|E
500|$|Writer Barry Ulanov commented in 1946 that Tristano [...] "was {{not content}} merely to <b>feel</b> <b>something,</b> [...] {{he had to}} explore ideas, to {{experience}} them, to think them through carefully, thoroughly, logically until he could fully grasp them and then hold on to them." [...] Tristano criticized the free jazz {{that began in the}} 1960s for its lack of musical logic as well as its expression of negative emotions. [...] "If you feel angry with somebody you hit him on the nose – not try to play angry music", he commented; [...] "Express all that is positive. Beauty is a positive thing." [...] He expanded on this by distinguishing emotion from feeling, and suggested that playing a particular emotion was egotistical and lacking in feeling.|$|E

500|$|Madonna worked {{primarily}} with Orbit after Guy Oseary, Maverick Records's partner, phoned Orbit {{and suggested that}} he send some songs to the singer. He sent a 13-track digital audio tape (DAT) to Madonna, and [...] "Frozen" [...] was among these tracks. [...] "I was {{a huge fan of}} William's earlier records. [...] I also loved all the remixes he did for me and I was interested in fusing a kind of futuristic sound but also using lots of Indian and Moroccan influences and things like that, and I wanted it to sound old and new at the same time", Madonna said. The singer drew inspiration from Bernardo Bertolucci's 1990 British-Italian drama film, The Sheltering Sky, which dealt with a couple trying to save their marriage during a trip to Africa. She wanted to have the [...] "whole Moroccan/orchestral/super-romantic/man-carrying-the-woman-he-loves-across-the-desert vibe" [...] for the track. Still continuing work with Leonard on some of the tracks, Madonna asked him to give her a composition with [...] "tribal <b>feel,</b> <b>something</b> really lush and romantic". They composed the melody on the DAT and recorded the demo, which stretched to over 10 minutes due to Madonna continuing writing the track.|$|E

2500|$|Those {{who knew}} Oughton {{recognized}} this period {{as the major}} turning point in her life; according to Powers, Oughton came to <b>feel</b> <b>something</b> close {{to a sense of}} shame at being American.

[...] She now sometimes suffered the full flood of her experiences." [...] Oughton became much more aware of the United States' impact on foreign countries, and she did not return to Philadelphia the same Midwest Republican. Oughton's old friends from college noticed upon her return to the United States how she had matured, while also displaying sadness regarding the poverty she encountered in Guatemala in the previous two years.|$|E

It's an unmistakably cardiac event, the kind that great art can elicit when something profound and undeniably true is conveyed about the human condition. That's when you say to yourself: are stick figures supposed {{to make me feel}} this way? In the hands of a master, yes. And Hertzfeldt is to stick figures what Franz Liszt was to planks of ebony and ivory and what Ted Williams was to a stick of white ash: someone so transcendentally expert that to describe what they do in literal terms is borderline demeaning." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{book was}} a minor success when {{published}} in 1935, retelling the true-life affair of four French soldiers who were executed {{to set an example}} {{to the rest of the}} troops. The novel was adapted to the stage the same year by World War I veteran Sidney Howard. The play was a flop on Broadway because of its harsh anti-war scenes that alienated the audience. Nonetheless, Howard continued to believe in the relevance of the subject matter and thought it should be made into a film, writing, [...] "It seems to me that our motion picture industry must <b>feel</b> <b>something</b> of a sacred obligation to make the picture." [...] Fulfilling Howard's [...] "sacred obligation", Stanley Kubrick decided to adapt it to the screen after he remembered reading the book when he was younger.

Fact is, I did <b>feel</b> <b>something.</b> That's why I was so angry. I was angry that five soldiers—the real heroes in my mind—were killed the same day and got far lower billing in the newscasts.
