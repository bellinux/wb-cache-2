The use of various definitions defining <b>HIV</b> <b>wasting</b> <b>syndrome</b> has made it difficult to determine its actual prevalence. Despite the use of highly active antiretroviral therapy, it is estimated that the prevalence of <b>HIV</b> <b>wasting</b> <b>syndrome</b> is between 14 % and 38 %. <b>HIV</b> <b>wasting</b> <b>syndrome</b> may stem from conditions affecting chewing, swallowing, or gastrointestinal motility, neurologic disease affecting food intake or the perception of hunger or ability to eat, psychiatric illness, food insecurity generated from psychosocial or economic concerns, or anorexia due to medications, malabsorption, infections, or tumors. Treatment of <b>HIV</b> <b>wasting</b> <b>syndrome</b> may be managed with appetite stimulants (megestrol acetate or dronabinol), anabolic agents (testosterone, testosterone analogs, or recombinant human growth hormone), or, rarely, cytokine production modulators (thalidomide). The goal of this review is to provide an in-depth evaluation based on existing clinical trials on the clinical utility of dronabinol in the treatment of weight loss associated with HIV/AIDS. Although total body weight gain varies with dronabinol use (– 2. 0 to 3. 2 kg), dronabinol is a well-tolerated option to promote appetite stimulation. Further studies are needed with standardized definitions of HIV-associated weight loss and clinical outcomes, robust sample sizes, safety and efficacy data on chronic use of dronabinol beyond 52 weeks, and associated virologic and immunologic outcomes.

40|$|Myostatin is {{the main}} {{negative}} regulator of skeletal muscle growth. AIM:To investigate {{the contribution of the}} myostatin in wasting of MDS patients. MATERIALS: Eighty-one(51 males and 30 females),MDS patients(median age 71,range 33 - 85), and 17 age and sex matched healthy were included. All gave informed consent. METHODS:RNA was extracted from left arm muscle. RT-PCR and Real time PCR were used with actin gene as reference gene. Mutation analysis was performed by direct sequencing. Serum levels of TNFa, IL- 1, IL- 2, Il- 6, TGF-β and leptin were measured using ELISA. Muscle cells were grown under varying quantities of cytokines and the myostatin RNA was determined. RESULTS: Myostatin RNA was higher in patients with RA,RAEB,RAEB-T in comparison to CMML,RARS and healthy controls. Patients with <b>wasting</b> <b>syndrome</b> had significantly higher copies of myostatin RNA(46997. 45 ± 8934. 09) compared to the patients without <b>wasting</b> <b>syndrome</b> (10702. 97 ± 3885. 59) (p 1 = 0. 00102) and healthy individuals (12657. 12 ± 3231. 873) (p 2 = 0. 000512). Patients without <b>wasting</b> <b>syndrome</b> did not differ statistically from healthy controls(p 3 = 0. 52). Mutations or polymorphisms in the myostatin gene were not found. TNF-α level in MDS patients with <b>wasting</b> <b>syndrome</b> was higher(p 1 = 0. 0047, p 2 = 0. 0191) and so was IL- 1 (p 1 = 0. 000114, p 2 = 1. 7546 x 10 - 8). H IL- 6 in MDS patients with <b>wasting</b> <b>syndrome</b> was also higher(p 1 = 0. 0103, p 2 = 0. 0267). TGF-β was higher in MDS patients with <b>wasting</b> <b>syndrome</b> compared to the controls(p 2 = 1. 09182 x 10 - 5). IL- 2 in the 1 st group was higher than the 2 d(p 1 = 0. 0478) and the 3 d(p 2 = 4. 48915 x 10 - 7). As well as myostatin in the 1 st group compared to the 2 d and 3 d(p 1 = 0. 0011,p 2 = 0. 0373). Leptin was also higher in the 1 st group compared to the 2 d and 3 d(p 1 = 3. 378 x 10 - 10, p 2 = 1. 97 · 10 - 8). TNF-α in concentrations > 500 ng/ml causes overexpression of the myostatin gene in cultures of human muscle cells and therefore it may participate through this pathway in the appearance of the <b>wasting</b> <b>syndrome.</b> We cannot exclude the action of TNF-α through another mechanism. The other cutokines did not change the myostatin expression. CONCLUSIONS: We found 1) increased expression of myostatin in MDS patients with <b>wasting</b> <b>syndrome.</b> 2) increased levels of TNF-α, TGF-β IL- 1, IL- 2, IL- 6 and leptin in the serum of the same group of patients 3) Indication of activation of the myostatin gene from the TNF-α.

40|$|Abstract. Porcine circovirus 2 (PCV 2) is {{the cause}} of postweaning {{multisystemic}} <b>wasting</b> <b>syndrome</b> (PMWS). The most common lesions of PMWS are lymphohistiocytic to granulomatous lymphadenitis, interstitial pneumonia and interstitial nephritis, with intracytoplasmic amphophilic botryoid inclusion bodies in macrophages. In addition to these typical changes, intracytoplasmic botryoid inclusion bodies were observed in bronchial, bronchial glandular, and renal tubular epithelium of several pigs from 4 different farms in Western and Eastern Canada. PCV 2 inclusion bodies were demonstrated to be located in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells by immunohistochemical staining for PCV 2 and cytokeratin antigens and by ultrastructural demonstration of viral particles in the inclusion bodies within renal tubular epithelium. Key words: Intracytoplasmic epithelial inclusion bodies; porcine circovirus 2 (PCV 2); postweaning multisystemic <b>wasting</b> <b>syndrome</b> (PMWS).

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{assess the}} {{contribution}} of tuberculosis to the aetiology of the <b>HIV</b> <b>wasting</b> <b>syndrome</b> (slim) in Africa, a condition usually considered an enteropathy. METHODS [...] Clinical examination and representative necropsy study of adult patients positive for HIV. SETTING [...] Hospital medical wards in Abidjan, Ivory Coast. SUBJECTS [...] Adults positive for HIV. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] CD 4 T lymphocyte counts before death, clinical and anthropometric data, and gross and microscopic pathology. RESULTS [...] Necropsy was done on 212 HIV positive adults. Tuberculosis was found in 41 of 93 with the clinical <b>HIV</b> <b>wasting</b> <b>syndrome</b> and in 32 of 119 without (odds ratio 2. 1, 95 % confidence interval 1. 2 to 4. 0). A significant association existed between the prevalence of tuberculosis at necropsy {{and the degree of}} cadaveric wasting (no wasting 25 % (15 / 59); moderate wasting 40 % (23 / 58); skeletal wasting 44 % (42 / 95); P = 0. 02). Wasting was also associated with a history of chronic diarrhoea, but no association existed between diarrhoea and tuberculosis. Median CD 4 T lymphocyte counts were lowest in wasted patients irrespective of findings at necropsy and in those with chronic diarrhoea (< 60 x 10 (6) /l). CONCLUSION [...] Wasting and chronic diarrhoea are late stage manifestations of HIV disease in Africa. The importance of tuberculosis as a contributing factor in the pathogenesis of the slim syndrome has been underestimated.

40|$|Objectives: To {{identify}} {{associations between}} specific WHO stage 3 and 4 conditions diagnosed after ART initiation and all cause mortality for patients in resource-limited settings (RLS). Design, Setting: Analysis of routine program data collected prospectively from 25 programs in eight countries between 2002 and 2010. Subjects, Participants: 36, 664 study participants with median ART follow-up of 1. 26 years (IQR 0. 55 – 2. 27). Outcome Measures: Using a {{proportional hazards model}} we identified factors associated with mortality, including the occurrence of specific WHO clinical stage 3 and 4 conditions during the 6 -months following ART initiation. Results: There were 2922 deaths during follow-up (8. 0 %). The crude mortality rate was 5. 41 deaths per 100 person-years (95 % CI: 5. 21 – 5. 61). The diagnosis of any WHO stage 3 or 4 condition during the first 6 months of ART was associated with increased mortality (HR: 2. 21; 95 % CI: 1. 97 – 2. 47).

40|$|Background: High {{rates of}} HIV {{infection}} have decreased life expectancy in many African countries. Regardless of worldwide efforts to escalate treatment, care and prevention strategies, {{the number of}} deaths due to AIDS-related disorders is still high. Local healthcare workers suspect that there are modifiable factors in the care of HIV and/or AIDS patients which can be identified and improved. Aim: To describe the HIV and/or AIDS-related causes of adult mortality and identify modifiable factors amongst patients admitted to Oshakati Intermediate Hospital, northern Namibia. Methods: Data was extracted retrospectively and coded using the modified CoDe protocol for AIDS. Modifiable factors relating to the patient, health system or clinical care were identified using a standardised data collection tool. Results: A total of 177 HIV and/or AIDS patients were identified, 94 (53. 1 %) were male and 120 (68 %) had a CD 4 count of less than 200 cells/mL. The common HIV-related causes of death were tuberculosis (25. 9 %), renal failure (15. 8 %), Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (11. 3 %), cryptococcal meningitis (9 %), <b>HIV</b> <b>wasting</b> <b>syndrome</b> (7. 9 %) and AIDS-defining malignancy (7. 9 %). The analysis revealed 281 modifiable factors; patient-related factors were the most common (153 [54. 4 %]), followed by health system factors (97 [34. 5 %]) and healthcare personnel factors (31 [11 %]). Conclusion: Our findings have highlighted the challenges in overall HIV and/or AIDS inpatient care and surrounding primary care facilities. The identification of specific modifiable factors can be used to reduce mortality by providing training as well as rational monitoring, planning and resource allocation. </p...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} {{the incidence of}} WHO clinical stage 3 and 4 conditions during early anti-retroviral therapy (ART) in resource limited settings (RLS). DESIGN/SETTING: A descriptive analysis of routine program data collected prospectively from 25 Médecins Sans Frontières supported HIV treatment programs in eight countries between 2002 and 2010. SUBJECTS/PARTICIPANTS: 35, 349 study participants with median follow-up on ART of 1. 33 years (IQR 0. 51 - 2. 41). OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence in 100 person-years of WHO stage 3 or 4 conditions during 5 periods after ART initiation. Diagnoses of conditions were made according to WHO criteria and relied upon clinical assessments supported by basic laboratory investigations. RESULTS: The incidence of any WHO clinical stage 3 or 4 condition over 3 years was 40. 02 per 100 person-years (31. 77 for stage 3 and 8. 25 for stage 4). The incidence of stage 3 and 4 conditions fell by over 97 % between months 0 - 3 and months 25 - 36 (77. 81 to 2. 40 for stage 3 and 28. 70 to 0. 64 for stage 4). During months 0 - 3 pulmonary tuberculosis {{was the most common}} condition diagnosed in adults (incidence 22. 24 per 100 person-years) and children aged 5 - 14 years (25. 76) and oral candidiasis was the most common in children < 5 years (25. 79). Overall incidences were higher in Africa compared with Asia (43. 98 versus 12. 97 for stage 3 and 8. 98 versus 7. 05 for stage 4 conditions, p< 0. 001). Pulmonary tuberculosis, weight loss, oral and oesophageal candidiasis, chronic diarrhoea, <b>HIV</b> <b>wasting</b> <b>syndrome</b> and severe bacterial infections were more common in Africa. Extra-pulmonary tuberculosis, non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection, cryptococcosis, penicilliosis and toxoplasmosis were more common in Asia. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of WHO stage 3 and 4 conditions during the early period after ART initiation in RLS is high, but greatly reduces over time. This is likely due to both the benefits of ART and deaths of the sickest patients occurring shortly after ART initiation. Access to appropriate disease prevention tools prior to ART, and early initiation of ART, are important for their prevention...|$|E

40|$|In sub-Saharan Africa, resource-limitation {{results in}} scarce {{availability}} of HIV prognostic {{tools such as}} CD 4 + T-Lymphocyte (CD 4) count and HIV viral load. To facilitate counselling and clinical decisions in this setting, widely available and inexpensive markers of prognosis are required. Chapter one gives {{an overview of the}} epidemiology and pathophysiology of HIV infection (with particular reference to sub-Saharan Africa), and its clinical manifestations. Staging systems for HIV infection and aspects of management in resource-poor environments are briefly discussed. Chapter two describes the epidemiological, pathophysiological and clinical aspects of tuberculosis (TB) in HIV infected patients, the commonest opportunistic infection in sub-Saharan Africa. It further provides HIV and TB prevalence data from the Western Cape, South Africa. In chapter three a study is presented demonstrating the usefulness of the total lymphocyte count (TLC) in combination with the World Health Organisation (WHO) clinical staging system to predict outcome in 831 HIV positive patients. A TLC of 1250 /μL was found to be the equivalent of a CD 4 count of 200 /μL. Patients with early HIV disease (WHO stage 1 & 2) had low annual rates of progression to AIDS : 3 - 4 % if the TLC was above 1250 /μL, 12 - 14 % if the TLC was below 1250 /μL. Annual progression to AIDS increased to 25 % and 46 % in patients with clinical stage 3 and a TLC above or below 1250 /μL respectively. Patients with AIDS had 30 - 55 % one-year mortality rates depending on the TLC. Chapter four illustrates that pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) in HIV infected patients presents with a radiographic spectrum reflecting the degree of HIV induced immune suppression. Chest radiographs and pre-treatment total lymphocyte counts provide prognostic information. Upper zone cavitatory infiltrates typical of reactivation PTB were associated with a preserved CD 4 count (mean 389 /μL) and predicted a 100 % two-year survival. Pleural effusions were associated with a mean CD 4 count of 184 /μL and predicted 65 % two-year survival. Patients with atypical radiographic presentation, including lower and mid-zone infiltrates, hilar and mediastinal adenopathy or interstitial patterns, had low CD 4 counts (mean 105 /μL) and a 36 % survival at two years. Rather than classifying every patient with pleura-pulmonary tuberculosis as WHO stage 3, incorporation of the prognostic value of the chest radiograph into the clinical staging system, such that typical reactivation PTB becomes stage 2, tuberculous pleural effusion stage 3 and atypical PTB stage 4, would enhance the prognostic accuracy of HIV related tuberculosis. Chapter five demonstrates that patients with AIDS could be categorized accord ing to one of three survival patterns, relating to the type of opportunistic illness. One-year survival rates were highest for extra-pulmonary tuberculosis and herpes simplex virus infection (70 %); intermediate for oesophageal candidiasis, cryptococcal meningitis, kaposi sarcoma and pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (45 %); and poorest for the <b>HIV</b> <b>wasting</b> <b>syndrome,</b> AIDS-dementia complex and performance status 4 (20 %). Despite the overall poor prognosis associated with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, a substantial proportion of patients survive, {{even in the absence of}} anti-retroviral therapy, for a number of years.
