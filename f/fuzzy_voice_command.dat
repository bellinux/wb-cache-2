5000|$|As car {{technology}} improves, more features will {{be added}} to cars and these features will most likely distract a driver. <b>Voice</b> <b>commands</b> for cars, according to CNET, should allow a driver to issue commands and not be distracted. CNET states that Nuance is suggesting that in the future they will create a software that resembles Siri, but for cars. [...] Most speech recognition software on the market today only have about 50 to 60 <b>voice</b> <b>commands,</b> but Ford Sync has 10,000. However, CNET suggest that even 10,000 <b>voice</b> <b>commands</b> is not sufficient given the complexity and the variety of tasks a user may want to do while driving. <b>Voice</b> <b>command</b> for cars is different from <b>voice</b> <b>command</b> for mobile phones and for computers because a driver may use the feature to look for nearby restaurants, look for gas, driving directions, road conditions, and the location of the nearest hotel. Currently, technology allows a driver to issue <b>voice</b> <b>commands</b> on both a portable GPS like a Garmin and a car manufacturer navigation system.|$|R
40|$|The {{proposed}} paper {{presents the}} design and implementation of a wireless home automation system with acoustic controlling. In this system, one voice recognition module {{has been added to}} the wireless network. The automation process will be done using recognition of <b>voice</b> <b>commands</b> and the Radio Frequency technology. The <b>voice</b> <b>commands</b> in this system are person independent. The proposed system has transmitting and receiving sections. Initially, the <b>voice</b> <b>command</b> is stored in the memory of voice module using the functions keys arranged. The input voice fed is processed in the voice recognition system where the feature of the <b>voice</b> <b>command</b> is extracted and matched with the pre-loaded <b>voice</b> <b>commands.</b> The module recognizes the voice and sends control messages to the microcontroller. The receiving microcontroller then processes the received data and switches the respective appliances via connected driver circuits...|$|R
40|$|Voice assistants like Siri {{enable us}} to control IoT devices {{conveniently}} with <b>voice</b> <b>commands,</b> however, they also provide new attack opportunities for adversaries. Previous papers attack voice assistants with obfuscated <b>voice</b> <b>commands</b> by leveraging the gap between speech recognition system and human voice perception. The limitation is that these obfuscated commands are audible and thus conspicuous to device owners. In this paper, we propose a novel mechanism to directly attack the microphone used for sensing voice data with inaudible <b>voice</b> <b>commands.</b> We show that the adversary can exploit the microphone's non-linearity and play well-designed inaudible ultrasounds to cause the microphone to record normal <b>voice</b> <b>commands,</b> and thus control the victim device inconspicuously. We demonstrate via end-to-end real-world experiments that our inaudible <b>voice</b> <b>commands</b> can attack an Android phone and an Amazon Echo device with high success rates at a range of 2 - 3 meters...|$|R

The most positive conceived aspects of <b>voice</b> <b>commands</b> are the speed of control {{and the ability to}} free your hands for something else. Voice feedback, however, is really appreciated. Especially it is welcomed instead of alarm beeps and blinking lights. It is possible that users need first to get accustomed that a device speaks to them. Finally, our studies show major changes in user attitudes when they actually use speech applications. Index Terms: smart home, speech interface, <b>voice</b> <b>command,</b> consumer surve...|$|R

After the training, the commands are recognized and transferred to the controlled system. Intelligent techniques are used with a combination of Hidden Markov Models and Dynamic Time Wrapping for the training and the recognition. The LEGO MINDSTORMS NXT robotics platform controlled by custom software developed under max/msp program is the evaluation tool of the system.

40|$|Speech {{recognition}} (SR) {{systems such}} as Siri or Google Now have become an increasingly popular human-computer interaction method, and have turned various systems into voice controllable systems(VCS). Prior work on attacking VCS shows that the hidden <b>voice</b> <b>commands</b> that are incomprehensible to people can control the systems. Hidden <b>voice</b> <b>commands,</b> though hidden, are nonetheless audible. In this work, we design a completely inaudible attack, DolphinAttack, that modulates <b>voice</b> <b>commands</b> on ultrasonic carriers (e. g., f > 20 kHz) to achieve inaudibility. By leveraging the nonlinearity of the microphone circuits, the modulated low frequency audio commands can be successfully demodulated, recovered, and more importantly interpreted by the speech recognition systems. We validate DolphinAttack on popular speech recognition systems, including Siri, Google Now, Samsung S Voice, Huawei HiVoice, Cortana and Alexa. By injecting a sequence of inaudible <b>voice</b> <b>commands,</b> we show a few proof-of-concept attacks, which include activating Siri to initiate a FaceTime call on iPhone, activating Google Now to switch the phone to the airplane mode, and even manipulating the navigation system in an Audi automobile. We propose hardware and software defense solutions. We validate that it is feasible to detect DolphinAttack by classifying the audios using supported vector machine (SVM), and suggest to re-design voice controllable systems to be resilient to inaudible <b>voice</b> <b>command</b> attacks.
