500|$|The {{first single}} <b>from</b> <b>Where</b> <b>You</b> Want to Be was [...] "A Decade Under the Influence," [...] which was {{released}} to radio in late June 2004. While Taking Back Sunday {{was on the}} 2004 Warped Tour, Where You Want to Be was released in late July on Victory Records. After an appearance at the Reading Festival in England, the group toured Europe and began a U.S. fall tour. They worked with Blink-182 member Tom DeLonge to create a music video, [...] "This Photograph Is Proof (I Know You Know)," [...] which was filmed in 48 hours. The band went on a winter tour with Atreyu and Funeral for a Friend, and [...] "This Photograph Is Proof (I Know You Know)" [...] was released to radio in early January 2005. Taking Back Sunday then began a co-headlining tour with Jimmy Eat World.|$|E
500|$|According {{to music}} {{journalist}} Jon Pareles, Songs of Innocence features U2 strictly playing rock music, particularly arena rock, whose elaborate production [...] "puts a higher gloss, {{and sometimes a}} heavier fuzz tone, on the band's instantly recognizable sound". Thematically, Songs of Innocence revisits the group members' youth in Ireland in the 1970s, touching on childhood memories, loves, and losses, while paying tribute to their musical inspirations. Bono described it as [...] "the most personal album we've written". In an interview with Gus Wenner of Rolling Stone, he said, [...] "Let's {{try to figure out}} why we wanted to be in a band, the relationships around the band, our friendships, our lovers, our family. The whole album is first journeys—first journeys geographically, spiritually, sexually." [...] He said that he felt challenged to write about more personal themes and why he wanted to be in a rock band after producer Jimmy Iovine told him, [...] "The person you need to be to make the album that you wanna make is a long way <b>from</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> live." [...] Rolling Stone deemed Songs of Innocence as having the feeling of a concept album, a notion that Bono rejected, although he did opine it was lyrically cohesive in a way the group's other records were not. For the album, the group revisited adolescent musical influences, such as punk rock band Ramones and electronic music group Kraftwerk, for inspiration.|$|E

That has allowed us to maintain extremely high degree of security, which is frankly our number one issue. The only way that we are aware of you can do that is to have tight configuration management and tight central control. So that is where a lot of the complaints came from. To that note, what have we done to lessen blow in future? I think the answer is we don't need to because we are already there." ...|$|E
