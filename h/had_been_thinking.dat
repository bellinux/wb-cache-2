5|$|After {{the success}} of Platoon (1986), Stone wanted film school friend and Los Angeles screenwriter Stanley Weiser to {{research}} and write a screenplay about quiz show scandals in the 1950s. During a story conference, Stone suggested making a film about Wall Street instead. The director pitched the premise of two investment partners getting involved in questionable financial dealings, using each other, and they are tailed by a prosecutor as in Crime and Punishment. The director <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>thinking</b> {{about this kind of}} a movie as early as 1981 and was inspired by his father, Lou Stone, a broker during the Great Depression at Hayden Stone.|$|E
5|$|Although Steinitz's play changed abruptly, he said <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>thinking</b> along such {{lines for}} some years: Some {{of the games}} which I saw Paulsen play during the London Congress of 1862 gave a still {{stronger}} start to the modification of my own opinions, which has since developed, and I began to recognize that Chess genius {{is not confined to}} the more or less deep and brilliant finishing strokes after the original balance of power and position has been overthrown, but that it also requires the exercise of still more extraordinary powers, though perhaps of a different kind to maintain that balance or respectively to disturb it at the proper time in one's own favor.|$|E
5|$|At the April 2017 Chicago Comic & Entertainment Expo, a film {{adaptation}} was announced. It will be co-written by Seeley and Sarah Fischer, {{directed by}} Luke Boyce and produced by Shatterglass Films, an independent film {{company based in}} Champaign, Illinois. Larger production firms also expressed interest, but Seeley would have had less input into the film if it were made by them. Boyce said he had enjoyed Revival since its debut, and <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>thinking</b> about adapting it long before he met the creators. A two-minute proof of concept teaser was shown at the expo.|$|E

5|$|Even Born was {{surprised}} to discover that Paul Dirac <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>thinking</b> along the same lines as Heisenberg. Soon Wolfgang Pauli used the matrix method to calculate the energy values of the hydrogen atom, and found that they agreed with the Bohr model. Another important contribution was made by Erwin Schrödinger, who looked at the problem using wave mechanics. This {{had a great deal of}} appeal to many at the time, as it offered the possibility of returning to deterministic classical physics. Born would have none of this, as it ran counter to facts determined by experiment. He formulated the now-standard interpretation of the probability density function for ψ*ψ in the Schrödinger equation, which he published in July 1926.|$|E
5|$|One of Simpson's first tasks was {{to confer}} with the Chief Signals Officer at General Douglas MacArthur's General Headquarters (GHQ) South West Pacific Area, Brigadier General Spencer B. Akin. The two {{established}} mechanisms to divide responsibility for the theatre's communications between the two armies, which often worked together on the same projects. An important outcome of their first meeting {{was the creation of}} the Central Bureau as a combined signals intelligence organisation. Simpson <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>thinking</b> about such an organisation while on the Orcades. Blamey had an appreciation of signals intelligence from his time as Deputy Commander in Chief in the Middle East, and readily gave his support. After a slow start, signals intelligence became an important element of the war in the South West Pacific.|$|E
25|$|The {{life story}} of Maria took another {{dramatic}} turn on 16 August 1976, when Maria found herself {{on trial in}} a Dutch court charged with plotting to murder her husband. She admitted in court that she <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>thinking</b> about leaving her husband but was afraid to start divorce proceedings in case she lost custody of her children. She {{came into contact with}} two regular customers at her husband's café bar. The trio bought a revolver and recruited a fourth accomplice to carry out the actual murder. However, the last member got cold feet and gossiped about the murder plan. The police quickly learnt of it and arrested all four conspirators.|$|E

25|$|After a {{four-year}} absence, Lucy Speed {{decided that she}} wanted to return to the series. She mentioned this to her former castmate Ross Kemp, who played Grant Mitchell in the serial and he initiated contact between Speed and then executive-producer, Matthew Robinson. Robinson <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>thinking</b> of introducing a new love-interest for the character Barry Evans (Shaun Williamson) and he had already considered the possibility that the love interest could be Natalie. Speed has commented “It was good timing. He thought I and the character fit the bill.” Natalie made her reappearance on-screen on 8 March 1999 and a relationship between the two characters was developed. A friendship was also re-established between the characters Natalie and Bianca in a special four-hander episode – although “the closeness was never quite the same”.|$|E
25|$|Maxis {{went public}} in 1995 with revenue of US$38 million. The stock reached $50 a share and then dropped as Maxis posted a loss. EA bought Maxis in June 1997. Wright <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>thinking</b> about making a virtual doll house ever since the early 1990s, similar to SimCity but focused on {{individual}} people; after losing his home during the Oakland firestorm of 1991, he was inspired to turn his experiences of rebuilding his life into a game. Sims {{would be based on}} Wright's focus on building homes, which came from inspiration he found first-hand. Wright, was even sure to include many fires in the game, which were extra difficult for the player to extinguish. Themes like carpentry, home construction, and bare ground in need of landscaping, are common throughout the game. Originally conceived of as an architectural design game called Home Tactics, Wright's idea changed when someone suggested the player should be rated on the quality of life experience by the homeowners. It was a difficult idea to sell to EA, because already 40% of Maxis's employees had been laid off.|$|E
500|$|... "John Doe" [...] {{was written}} after Gilligan <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>thinking</b> {{of a story}} {{involving}} a [...] "memory vampire" [...] for months. Furthermore, the episode was MacLaren's directorial debut. Noted director Kim Manners helped guide her through the process. Director of photography Bill Roe used specific lighting for the episode; indoor scenes are dark and hard to make out whereas outside scenes are bright and over-saturated with light. The Mexican hotel apartment was created from Fox Mulder's (David Duchovny) old apartment set.|$|E

[...] He told speechwriter Jeff Greenfield, [...] "You know, the death of Martin Luther King isn't the worse thing that ever happened in the world."

500|$|The {{two were}} {{inspired}} by gospelmusic and both have described their music as [...] "electronicgospel"—in particular the tracks [...] "LifeIsLong" [...] and [...] "OneFineDay". In addition to subtle Biblical themes in the lyrics, Eno was influenced by gospel musicality, which he initially discovered through Talking Heads while working on MoreSongsAboutBuildingsandFood by listening to [...] "SurrendertoHisWill" [...] by ReverendMaceoWoods and The ChristianTabernacleChoir. For several {{years leading up to}} this project, Eno had primarily listened to gospelmusic—even joining a gospelchoir—and was attracted to the music's unrestrained vocals and lack of pessimism as well as its inclusive nature. Eno <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>thinking</b> about gospel for several years, but could not write lyrics to hopeful songs.|$|E
500|$|Eno {{has also}} said the album is about [...] "paint {{a picture of the}} human trying to survive in an {{increasingly}} digital world;" [...] themes that are explored in this song. [...] "Strange Overtones" [...] has been described as [...] "a song about writing a song"—the subject of the song struggles to write innovative music, but is overheard by a neighbor using beats that are [...] "twenty years old." [...] In terms of the genre of music, both Byrne and Eno have called it [...] "electronic Gospel"—the backing tracks are the kind of electronic music for which Eno is known, paired with hopeful and inspiring lyrics from Byrne— this song in particular features an uptempo backing track. Eno <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>thinking</b> about Gospel for several years, but couldn't write lyrics to hopeful songs.|$|E
500|$|Beahan <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>thinking</b> of {{releasing}} a tribute record through his {{company for a}} long time, {{following the death of}} musicians Arthur Lee and Syd Barrett in 2006. However, he changed his mind and instead chose Madonna, believing her songs could be recorded as serious sounding tracks, thereby eliminating chances of it being a novelty release. The idea for Through the Wilderness originated from an epiphany Beahan had about Madonna. Although not a fan of the singer, he was intrigued about how her songs would sound when treated by alternative musicians. [...] "The Madonna tribute came to me in a dream last fall, and I immediately started making calls and emails to Winter Flowers, Chapin Sisters, and Banhart asking them to record a song for it," [...] Beahan clarified to Spin magazine.|$|E

500|$|On February 3, 2015, Dylan {{released}} Shadows in the Night, featuring ten songs written between 1923 and 1963, {{which have}} been described as part of the Great American Songbook. All the songs on the album were recorded by Frank Sinatra but both critics and Dylan himself cautioned against seeing the record as a collection of [...] "Sinatra covers". Dylan explained, [...] "I don't see myself as covering these songs in any way. They've been covered enough. Buried, as a matter a fact. What me and my band are basically doing is uncovering them. Lifting them out of the grave and bringing them into the light of day." [...] In an interview, Dylan said he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>thinking</b> about making this record since hearing Willie Nelson's 1978 album Stardust.|$|E

Henderson is a person with dwarfism from England, who was badly injured by being tossed by a rugby fan in a bar. The speech by Dinklage brought media and public attention to the act of dwarf-tossing with Henderson's name being trended worldwide on social media. Dinklage turned down offers from talk shows to discuss the topic. He later explained that 20 years earlier he might have accepted these offers but that he's a [...] "little bit more at peace with things now and I—said what I wanted to say.

500|$|In 2010, West sparked {{controversy}} by {{criticizing the}} slow pace of the recently completed series between the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox, which he called [...] "pathetic and embarrassing."

[...] Columnist Wallace Matthews defended West, saying the umpire was simply expressing what people <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>thinking</b> for a long time. West was not fined by MLB for his comments, but was [...] "admonished firmly," [...] according to press reports. On May 26, 2010, West made two controversial balk calls on Mark Buehrle and consequently ejected White Sox manager Ozzie Guillén for arguing and Buehrle for throwing his glove. On August 26, 2010, West was the plate umpire for Albert Pujols’ 400th career home run.|$|E
