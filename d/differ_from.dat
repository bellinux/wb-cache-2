25|$|Examination of this genus by Sues et al. (2011) {{demonstrates}} that Daemonosaurus is {{separate and distinct}} from its other contemporaries. Daemonosaurus <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> Herrerasaurus based on key features in the skull and because it has much larger teeth in the premaxilla. Daemonosaurus <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> Eodromaeus based on features of the jaw bone, skull, cheek bones, and because it has much larger teeth in the premaxilla. Daemonosaurus <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> Eoraptor lunensis based {{on the presence of}} much larger premaxillary and anterior maxillary teeth and a much more restricted antorbital fossa on the maxilla. Daemonosaurus <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> Tawa hallae and Coelophysis bauri in features of the skull bones. Daemonosaurus <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> Chindesaurus bryansmalli in features of the cervical vertebrae.|$|R

40|$|Mirror neurons become instigated {{when the}} spectator empathizes with the principal’s intention. But when they involve imitation, empathy ({{understanding}}) is irrelevant. While understanding may attenuate the principal’s emotion, imitation escalates it. A {{solution of the}} contradictory attenuation/escalation pathways of fellow-feeling is to distinguishing two axes: “rationality axis ” concerns whether the action is efficient or suboptimal; “intentionality axis” concerns whether the intention is wellbeing or evil. The solution shows how group solidarity <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> altruism and fairness; how revulsion <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> squeamishness; how sympathy <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> adulation; how evil <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> selfishness; and how racia...|$|R

40|$|The mirror-neuron system (MNS) becomes instigated {{when the}} spectator empathizes with the principal’s intention. MNS also {{involves}} imitation, where empathy is irrelevant. While the former may attenuate the principal’s emotion, the latter paradoxically reinforces it.

5|$|Cicadas {{are large}} insects made {{conspicuous}} by the courtship calls of the males. They are characterised by having three joints in their tarsi, and having small antennae with conical bases and {{three to six}} segments, including a seta at the tip. The Auchenorrhyncha <b>differ</b> <b>from</b> other hemipterans by having a rostrum that arises from the posteroventral part of the head, complex sound-producing membranes, and a mechanism for linking the wings that involves a down-rolled edging on {{the rear of the}} forewing and an upwardly protruding flap on the hindwing. Cicadas lack the ability to jump as exhibited by other members of the Auchenorrhyncha. Another defining characteristic is the adaptations of the forelimbs of nymphs for underground life. The relict family Tettigarctidae <b>differ</b> <b>from</b> the Cicadidae in having the prothorax extending as far as the scutellum, and by lacking the tympanal apparatus.|$|E

5|$|Many {{eukaryotic}} organisms have electron transport chains that <b>differ</b> <b>from</b> the much-studied mammalian enzymes described above. For example, {{plants have}} alternative NADH oxidases, which oxidize NADH in the cytosol {{rather than in}} the mitochondrial matrix, and pass these electrons to the ubiquinone pool. These enzymes do not transport protons, and, therefore, reduce ubiquinone without altering the electrochemical gradient across the inner membrane.|$|E

5000|$|Because {{the concept}} of {{adaptive}} intelligent machine is central to developmental robotics, it has relationships with fields such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, cognitive robotics or computational neuroscience. Yet, while it may reuse some of the techniques elaborated in these fields, it <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> them from many perspectives. It <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> classical artificial intelligence {{because it does not}} assume the capability of advanced symbolic reasoning and focuses on embodied and situated sensorimotor and social skills rather than on abstract symbolic problems. It <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> traditional machine learning because it targets task- independent self-determined learning rather than task-specific inference over [...] "spoon fed human-edited sensori data" [...] (Weng et al., 2001). It <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> cognitive robotics because it focuses on the processes that allow the formation of cognitive capabilities rather than these capabilities themselves. It <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> computational neuroscience because it focuses on functional modeling of integrated architectures of development and learning. More generally, developmental robotics is uniquely characterized by the following three features: ...|$|R
