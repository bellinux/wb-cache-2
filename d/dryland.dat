As many as 70 percent of today’s Australian Merinos are said to be directly descended from the Peppin-developed sheep. The Riverina is home to many Merino studs and the saltbush plains are regarded as one of Australia's best wool growing regions.|$|E
5|$|The native {{environment}} stayed relatively intact until settlers {{began to}} arrive in western Idaho in great numbers in the 1870s, and miners also were attracted by a gold strike at nearby Orofino, {{on the banks of}} the Clearwater River. Many of these emigrants set up <b>dryland</b> farms and ranches in the prairies surrounding the Potlatch River. Soil conditions generally improve as one travels southwards through the watershed, but there was a major drawback to growing crops in the southern part of the basin: the inaccessibility of water. Already scarce in the arid Potlatch River drainage, the river's water was hard to reach because of the steep canyon it passes through in most of its lower course. Farmers were restricted to growing crops that did not require irrigation, and many of the lands that did not have access to abundant-enough water were relegated to pasture or hay producing status.|$|E

40|$|<b>Drylands</b> cover 40 % of {{the global}} {{terrestrial}} surface and provide important ecosystem services. While <b>drylands</b> as a whole are expected to increase in extent and aridity in coming decades, temperature and precipitation forecasts vary by latitude and geographic region suggesting different trajectories for tropical, subtropical, and temperate <b>drylands.</b> Uncertainty {{in the future of}} tropical and subtropical <b>drylands</b> is well constrained, whereas soil moisture and ecological droughts, which drive vegetation productivity and composition, remain poorly understood in temperate <b>drylands.</b> Here we show that, over the twenty first century, temperate <b>drylands</b> may contract by a third, primarily converting to subtropical <b>drylands,</b> and that deep soil layers could be increasingly dry during the growing season. These changes imply major shifts in vegetation and ecosystem service delivery. Our results illustrate the importance of appropriate drought measures and, as a global study that focuses on temperate <b>drylands,</b> highlight a distinct fate for these highly populated areas...|$|R
50|$|<b>Drylands</b> {{are defined}} by a {{scarcity}} of water. <b>Drylands</b> are zones where precipitation is balanced by evaporation from surfaces and transpiration by plants (evapotranspiration). UNEP defines <b>drylands</b> as tropical and temperate areas with an aridity index of less than 0.65. The <b>drylands</b> can be classified into four sub-types: dry sub-humid lands, semi-arid lands, arid lands, and hyper-arid lands. Some authorities consider Hyper-arid lands as deserts (UNCCD) although {{a number of the}} world’s deserts include both hyper arid and arid climate zones.

This paper reviews the findings of some long-term studies of <b>drylands</b> area development in East Africa and in the West African Sahel. The broad findings are that <b>drylands</b> people are remarkably resilient and have succeeded in increasing their incomes in sustainable ways, and in coping with all but the most severe natural calamities. Coping has entailed on-farm innovation in risk-reducing and productivity-enhancing techniques and activities, and developing off-farm income sources, which are often, but not always, invested in on-farm activities. A thriving agricultural economy promoted by sound policy is clearly necessary, but is not a sufficient condition for successful <b>drylands</b> development...|$|R
