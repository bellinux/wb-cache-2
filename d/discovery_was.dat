5|$|The National Antarctic Expedition, {{known as}} the Discovery Expedition after the ship <b>Discovery,</b> <b>was</b> the brainchild of Sir Clements Markham, {{president}} of the Royal Geographical Society, and had been many years in preparation. It was led by Robert Falcon Scott, a Royal Navy torpedo lieutenant lately promoted Commander, and had objectives that included scientific and geographical discovery.|$|E
50|$|<b>Discovery</b> <b>is</b> an unincorporated {{community}} in St. Mary's County, Maryland, United States. <b>Discovery</b> <b>is</b> located near Maryland Route 235 northwest of Lexington Park and southeast of California.|$|R
50|$|<b>Discovery</b> <b>is</b> an unincorporated {{community}} in Frederick County, Maryland, United States. <b>Discovery</b> <b>is</b> located along Maryland Route 194 near {{the southern border}} of Walkersville. Prior to 2010, the community {{was part of the}} Discovery-Spring Garden census-designated place.|$|R
50|$|In essence, Intel {{held that}} section 1782 <b>discovery</b> <b>is</b> {{available}} to a non-US litigant almost as freely as <b>discovery</b> <b>is</b> available {{in connection with a}} lawsuit that is pending entirely before a court in the United States.|$|R
5|$|The <b>discovery</b> <b>was</b> significant, {{because it}} {{represented}} the first ceratopsid known from China, {{and possibly the}} only ceratopsid from Asia. The only other possible Asian ceratopsid is Turanoceratops, but recently, its identification as a ceratopsid has been questioned.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} morning, it {{was confirmed}} {{that this was}} a new comet, and it was given the designation C/1995O1. The <b>discovery</b> <b>was</b> announced in International Astronomical Union circular 6187.|$|E
5|$|This careful {{treatment}} of the Haraldskær Woman's remains explains the excellent state of conservation of the corpse; conversely, Tollund Man, a later <b>discovery,</b> <b>was</b> not properly conserved {{and most of the}} body has been lost, leaving only the head as original remains in his display.|$|E
50|$|Lombard's <b>discovery</b> <b>is</b> {{important}} for four reasons.|$|R
25|$|From {{ancient times}} through the Middle Ages, periods of {{mathematical}} <b>discovery</b> <b>were</b> often followed by centuries of stagnation. Beginning in Renaissance Italy in the 16th century, new mathematical developments, interacting with new scientific <b>discoveries,</b> <b>were</b> made at an increasing pace that continues through the present day.|$|R
50|$|<b>Discovery</b> <b>is</b> a {{major part}} of this series.|$|R
5|$|This <b>discovery</b> <b>was</b> further {{substantiated}} {{by their}} detailed {{measurements of the}} alpha decay chain of the produced bohrium atoms to previously known isotopes of fermium and californium. The IUPAC/IUPAP Transfermium Working Group (TWG) recognised the GSI collaboration as official discoverers in their 1992 report.|$|E
5|$|This <b>discovery</b> <b>was</b> preceded {{nearly eight}} years earlier by {{a report that}} {{treatment}} of unactivated ketones with palladium acetate yielded the same products in low yields. The major improvement provided by Saegusa and Ito was the recognition that the enol form was the reactive species, developing a method based on silyl enol ethers.|$|E
5|$|A {{controversy}} that has occupied scholars {{for more than}} a century concerns whether Cabral's <b>discovery</b> <b>was</b> by chance or intentional. If the latter, that would mean that the Portuguese had at least some hint that a land existed to the west. The matter was first raised by Emperor Pedro II in 1854 during a session of the Brazilian Historic and Geographic Institute, when he asked if the discovery might have been intentional.|$|E
40|$|Subgroup <b>discovery</b> <b>is</b> a {{data mining}} {{technique}} which extracts interesting rules {{with respect to}} a target variable. An important characteristic of this task is the combination of predictive and descriptive induction. In this paper, an overview about subgroup <b>discovery</b> <b>is</b> performed. In addition, di erent real-world applications solved through evolutionary algorithms where the suitability and potential of this type of algorithms for the development of subgroup <b>discovery</b> algorithms <b>are</b> presented...|$|R
50|$|The Sheikh Adi <b>discovery</b> <b>is</b> {{particularly}} significant because Gulf has an 80% interest in it. A Field Development Plan for the <b>discovery</b> <b>is</b> {{due to be}} put to the Kurdistan Regional Government during the fourth quarter of 2015, and the <b>discovery</b> has <b>been</b> described by Gulf as a significant side-lobe to the Shaikan oilfield. The oil in Sheikh Adi is intended to be processed using surface facilities within the Shaikan block.|$|R
5000|$|Local Peer <b>Discovery</b> <b>is</b> {{implemented}} with HTTP-like {{messages on}} User Datagram Protocol (UDP) multicast group 239.192.152.143:6771 {{which is an}} administratively scoped multicast address. Since implementation is simple, Local Peer <b>Discovery</b> <b>is</b> implemented in several clients (µTorrent, BitTorrent/Mainline, MonoTorrent, libtorrent and its derivatives, Transmission 2.0, aria2 [...] ). An alternative multicast peer <b>discovery</b> protocol <b>is</b> published as BEP 26, but is not widely adopted since it is considered too complex in comparison.|$|R
5|$|A paper {{documenting the}} <b>discovery</b> <b>was</b> {{prepared}} by the team {{and sent to the}} journal Physical Review in March 1941, but publication was delayed until a year after the end of World War II due to security concerns. At the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge, Egon Bretscher and Norman Feather realized that a slow neutron reactor fuelled with uranium would theoretically produce substantial amounts of plutonium-239 as a by-product. They calculated that element 94 would be fissile, and had the added advantage of being chemically different from uranium, and could easily be separated from it.|$|E
5|$|A six-page writeup {{about the}} {{building}} appeared in Architect and Engineer in December 1937. The article listed {{the owners and}} the structural engineer, but did not name the architect. In the early 1980s, geologist and architectural historian Gray Brechin discovered that Irvin Goldstine had designed the building; Brechin subsequently interviewed Goldstine regarding his career. An article about the <b>discovery</b> <b>was</b> printed in Metro Magazine, a defunct San Francisco magazine. Until that time, the building {{was thought to be}} designed by the Mallochs.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1870, chemists {{thought that there}} should be an alkali metal beyond caesium, with an atomic number of 87. It was then {{referred}} to by the provisional name eka-caesium. Research teams attempted to locate and isolate this missing element, and at least four false claims were made that the element had been found before an authentic <b>discovery</b> <b>was</b> made.|$|E
40|$|This paper compares two {{contrasting}} {{conceptions of}} discovery through writing. The first - the classical position - claims that <b>discovery</b> <b>is</b> {{a consequence of}} planned rhetorical organisation. The second - the romantic position - claims that <b>discovery</b> <b>is</b> {{a consequence of the}} spontaneous spelling-out of ideas in continuous prose. An experiment is described in which two variables distinguishing between the positions are manipulated, and the effect on <b>discovery</b> <b>is</b> measured. The results support the romantic position. The implication of these findings, and the methods used, for computer-based writing are discussed...|$|R

5|$|At Cape Canaveral, {{the space}} shuttle <b>Discovery</b> <b>was</b> {{considered}} to be safe on its launching pad after concerns of unfavorable weather, and NASA rescheduled a liftoff the following week; however, shuttle managers eventually decided to begin moving Discovery from the launching pad to ride out the storm. In Miami, the Booker T. Washington Senior High School opened as a voluntary evacuation shelter for all pre-registered special needs residents. Also, the MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa evacuated its aircraft to McConnell Air Force Base near Wichita.|$|E
5|$|Cryolophosaurus {{originally}} was {{collected during the}} 1990–91 austral summer on Mount Kirkpatrick in the Beardmore Glacier region of the Transantarctic Mountains. The <b>discovery</b> <b>was</b> made by Hammer, a professor at Augustana College, and his team. The fossils {{were found in the}} siliceous siltstone of the Hanson Formation, formerly the upper Falla Formation, and dated to the Pliensbachian stage of the early Jurassic. Cryolophosaurus was the second dinosaur, and first theropod, to be discovered in Antarctica. It was discovered after Antarctopelta, but named earlier.|$|E
5|$|Curium is a {{transuranic}} radioactive {{chemical element}} with symbol Cm and atomic number 96. This {{element of the}} actinide series was named after Marie and Pierre Curie – both were known for their research on radioactivity. Curium was first intentionally produced and identified in July 1944 by the group of Glenn T. Seaborg at the University of California, Berkeley. The <b>discovery</b> <b>was</b> kept secret and only {{released to the public}} in November 1945. Most curium is produced by bombarding uranium or plutonium with neutrons in nuclear reactors – one tonne of spent nuclear fuel contains about 20grams of curium.|$|E

50|$|<b>Discovery</b> <b>is</b> a {{software}} synthesizer VSTi and Audio Units plugin designed and distributed by discoDSP originally released on February 10, 2003. On September 4, 2008, discoDSP released a version for Linux marking {{the first commercial}} VSTi plugin available on Linux platform. <b>Discovery</b> <b>is</b> also available for Windows and Mac OS X.|$|R
50|$|Archaeological <b>discoveries</b> <b>were</b> {{frequent}} {{during the}} work, {{in particular in}} the area of Piazza della Repubblica, and required changes to the planning. The uncovered remains were put on show in protective glass display cases in Repubblica station. The tunnelling work and connected archaeological <b>discoveries</b> <b>were</b> portrayed in Federico Fellini's film Roma.|$|R
5|$|Galileo {{initially}} {{called his}} discovery the Cosmica Sidera ("Cosimo's stars"), {{in honour of}} Cosimo II de' Medici (1590–1621). At Cosimo's suggestion, Galileo changed the name to Medicea Sidera ("the Medician stars"), honouring all four Medici brothers (Cosimo, Francesco, Carlo, and Lorenzo). The <b>discovery</b> <b>was</b> announced in the Sidereus Nuncius ("Starry Messenger"), published in Venice in March 1610, {{less than two months}} after the first observations.|$|E
5|$|HAT-P-33b is {{a planet}} in the orbit of HAT-P-33, which lies 1,367 light years away from Earth. Its <b>discovery</b> <b>was</b> {{reported}} in June 2011, although it was suspected to be a planet as early as 2004. The planet is about three-fourths the mass of Jupiter, but is almost eighty percent larger than Jupiter is; this inflation has, as {{with the discovery of}} similar planets WASP-17b and HAT-P-32b, raised the question of what (other than temperature) causes these planets to become so large.|$|E
5|$|HD 154672 is {{a yellow}} subgiant (spectral type G3 IV). It is about 65 parsecs {{away from the}} Sun that is larger than, but of a similar mass to, the Sun. However, HD 154672 is much older. The star is very metal-rich, {{which is one of}} the reasons why it was {{targeted}} for a planet search by the N2K Consortium, which discovered the gas giant planet HD 154672 b using Doppler Spectroscopy; the <b>discovery</b> <b>was</b> reported in October 2008. The N2K collaboration chose HD 154672 primarily because it aimed to discover the correlation between a star's metallicity and the mass of orbiting planets.|$|E
50|$|Its <b>discovery</b> <b>is</b> widely {{accredited}} to the biologist Chris Rouse.|$|R
50|$|The {{history of}} these <b>discoveries</b> <b>was</b> {{summarized}} by Paraense (2001).|$|R
30|$|All the <b>discoveries</b> <b>were</b> made {{in places}} {{shown on the}} {{prognostic}} map as promising (see Fig.  1). Moreover, all {{the oil and gas}} <b>discoveries</b> <b>were</b> located in basins without the existing big oil or gas fields at the time of prediction. Each promising site is a circle with a radius of 45 miles.|$|R
