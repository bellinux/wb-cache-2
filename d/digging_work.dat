25|$|The {{city had}} been under Union naval attack before. Admiral David Farragut moved up the river after his capture of New Orleans and on May 18, 1862, demanded the {{surrender}} of Vicksburg.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{interest}} in unmanned excavator is growing {{more and more}} {{for the sake of}} work efficiency and safety of the operator. It is general understanding that an optimal working path planning and inverse dynamic control should be resolved first for the realization of the unmanned excavator. In this paper, the methods to determine the optimal working path based on minimum torque or time and to simulate <b>digging</b> <b>works</b> tracking on the designed working path are proposed. In case of the minimum torque, the optimal working path is determined to minimize the joint torques of attachments. On the other hand, in case of minimum time, the optimal working path is decided to minimize time duration for one-cycle working considering the hydraulic constraints such as oil flow rate and relief pressure etc. In order to verify the inverse dynamic code used in the optimization and the optimized path, field measurements were carried out for the various parameters such as swing angle, cylinder lengths, and pressures of a swing motor and hydraulic cylinders during <b>digging</b> <b>works.</b> The modified FEE(Fundamental Earthmoving Equation) is adopted for the modeling of soil-tool interaction in digging process and the inverse dynamics with external force such as constant and reducing lifting weights is used in lifting and dumping process. Finally, all the simulated data were compared with the measured data in order to examine the effectiveness of the proposed methods in view of the development of the unmanned excavator...|$|R

50|$|The {{earliest}} {{traces of}} settlement {{in and around}} Odenbach {{go back to the}} New Stone Age. Archaeological ﬁnds from the Bronze Age that followed, however, have been rather sparse, but they become richer again with the rise of the Celts. From the early Iron Age (Hallstatt times, about 800-500 BC) comes the burying ground that was unearthed on the Galgenberg. Furthermore, <b>digging</b> <b>work</b> in 1934 at the “Hellerwald” sporting ground brought to light another burying ground, this one from the later Iron Age (La Tène times, about 500 BC to AD 1), which long lay on a homestead in the cadastral area known as “Im hintern Spitzwasen”, whose foundation remnants are known. Finds of ancient coins show that there was uninterrupted settlement here in the transitional period between Celtic and Roman times. Indeed, Roman roads once ran along the heights to the Roßberg and the Ebernburg either side of the Glan. Unearthed during clearing work in the cadastral area known as “Im Neuberg” {{was one of the most}} important troves: some 150 gold coins attributed to the East Celtic tribe of the Leuker. After Julius Caesar conquered Gaul, the inhabitants adopted Roman culture. The State Museum in Speyer keeps a bronze statuette of Minerva found in Adenbach and another of Mercury found in Odenbach. During the Migration Period, between about AD 375 to 550, the Medard-Odenbach area must have been a refuge.|$|E
50|$|A prehistoric barrow, {{about which}} there were once reports, is now no longer to be found. Of {{particular}} interest, however, are the ﬁnds of two little stone hatchets, which might date from the New Stone Age, although {{on the other hand}} they might also be of Roman origin. One of these ﬁnds was owned by Friedrich W. Weber and is today kept at the Kusel district administration. It is a trapezoidal hatchet blade made of jade with a wholly intact edge and workmanship that shows masterful skill in grinding and polishing. It was found in the bed of the Grundbach. Another stone hatchet of similar quality was found near the graveyard and is today still in private ownership. While <b>digging</b> <b>work</b> was being done at the Klosterﬂur (rural cadastral area), workers struck some old walling made of limestone mortar, some thick bits of tile and a great number of potsherds and artefacts from Roman times. A Gallo-Roman settlement likely stood here, which may have some link with the Roman ﬁnds in neighbouring Sankt Julian. Furthermore, a sewer made of stone slabs, open at the top and leading to the Grundbach was also struck. The village’s farmers are always telling of building blocks being brought up by their ploughs in the ﬁelds, and of light stripes seen running across the earth in their seeded ﬁelds in times of drought. It could mean that a Gallo-Roman villa rustica lies buried underneath, or perhaps a monasterial estate from {{the early days of the}} so-called Remigiusland.|$|E

50|$|The {{area around}} Reichweiler has been settled since ancient times. Archaeological ﬁnds from prehistoric times {{bear witness to}} this. A ploughshare from the New Stone Age, some 4,000 years old, found within {{neighbouring}} Schwarzerden’s limits, is a particularly ﬁne example. Frequent ﬁnds from early La Tène times {{and the time of}} the Treveri (a people of mixed Celtic and Germanic stock, from whom the Latin name for the city of Trier, Augusta Treverorum, is also derived) within Schwarzerden’s or Reichweiler’s limits behind the Mithraic monument, mainly in the shape of urns, human remains and wartime equipment such as sword tips, shield bosses and items for daily needs, even if they are not well preserved, show that the land was settled by more or less sedentary people in those days. More light is shed into the shadows of the past by the many ﬁnds from Roman times that have been unearthed in the same lands as the prehistoric ﬁnds. A stone ﬁgure depicting the Roman smith god Vulcan can now be found in the Saarländisches Landesmuseum (State Museum) in Saarbrücken. Terra sigillata vessels, clay jars, a wine ladle and the like were found during <b>digging</b> <b>work</b> in the 1920s and 1930s. Given that the cult was never thoroughly widespread in Roman times (about the 1st century AD), even though soldiers in Roman legions adopted it and spread it far into the west from its eastern origins, the Mithraic monument (Mithrasdenkmal) represents a peculiarity. It is a religious icon that was originally part of a temple in a Roman settlement. Riding on a ﬂeeing bull is the Persian god and personiﬁcation of heavenly light, Mithra, stabbing the bull in the neck, accompanied by a lion, a dog, a snake and a scorpion. Above in a semicircular arch are the sun god and the moon goddess. The youngling killing the bull stands between the god of everlasting light, Ahuramazda (the ﬁgure with the upraised torch), and the god of darkness, Ahriman (the ﬁgure with the lowered torch), at least according to Mithraic researchers and interpreters of this cult. Similarities to Christianity are unmistakable. Further, it should be mentioned that these rich ﬁnds have come from both Celtic and Roman times, and that they, along with the Mithraic monument, were originally grouped into the municipality of Schwarzerden, but owing to an arbitrary boundary adjustment, perhaps in the Middle Ages, they have found themselves within Reichweiler. The current boundary between the two is the river formerly known as the Weißwieserbach, now known as the Pfeffelbach.|$|E
50|$|Pfeffelbach {{belonged to}} the Restkreis until 1937, when it was {{transferred}} to the Birkenfeld district. This was created by uniting the Restkreis with a hitherto Oldenburg district of that same name. The new, bigger district was grouped into the Prussian Regierungsbezirk of Koblenz. After the Second World War, the village at ﬁrst lay in the Regierungsbezirk of Koblenz in the then newly founded state of Rhineland-Palatinate. In the course of administrative restructuring in this state in 1969, the Amt of Burglichtenberg was dissolved. Pfeffelbach passed to the newly founded Verbandsgemeinde of Kusel and to the Kusel district, in which it remains today. It also found itself in the new Regierungsbezirk of Rheinhessen-Pfalz, although this has since been dissolved. According to an 1816 report, Pfeffelbach had 63 bungalows, 20 two-storey houses and 10 “wooden houses” (this likely meant timber-frame houses) with 474 inhabitants. Among the village’s craftsmen were three millers, one shoemaker, two tailors, one bricklayer, one cabinetmaker, one smith and one knacker. Between 1841 and 1877, the geometer Efferz undertook a cadastral survey. One soldier from Pfeffelbach fell in the Franco-Prussian War in 1870. That same year, Peter Aulenbacher, Jakob Braun and Jakob Heß opened Pfeffelbach’s ﬁrst stone quarry. Paving stones from this quarry and others that were subsequently opened were shipped by horse and cart to Kusel and for a time even to Sankt Wendel. A threshing cooperative was founded in 1872, a threshing shed was built and a threshing machine was bought. In 1893, the church at Pfeffelbach acquired the organ that it still has now. On 10 May 1896, to commemorate the conclusion of a peace treaty with France that {{put an end to the}} Franco-Prussian War on 10 May 1871 - thus on the 25th anniversary of its signing - the veterans’ association, which had been established only the year before, planted the so-called Bismarckeiche (“Bismarck Oak”). It was a gift from Otto von Bismarck himself to the local veterans’ association and came from the Sachsenwald near Friedrichsruh. In 1900 there were for the ﬁrst time miners and foundry workers in Pfeffelbach who were employed in the Saar area. In 1914, the First World War broke out. On 16 August 1917, a commercial survey was undertaken, which yielded the following data: two stone quarrying businesses, three innkeepers, four traders, two bakers, two cabinetmakers, two smiths, one turner, one plumber, two butter and milk dealers, two shoemakers, three gristmills, two butchers, one insurance agent, three wheelwrights, one sculptor, one tailor, one shaver, one house painter and two midwives. Those who were not self-employed worked in crafts, business, stone quarries, Saar mines, the ironworks in Neunkirchen am Potzberg and in a few cases even in the building trade. The greater part of the population, though, worked mainly in agriculture. The First World War also saw the local church lose its bell, which had to be given up for war requirements. In October 1918, the village was gripped by an influenza epidemic. Fully half the villagers became ill, and 21 of them died. On 11 November of that same year came the Armistice; 54 soldiers from Pfeffelbach had fallen in the Great War. A memorial to them was dedicated on 18 September 1921. The autumn of 1919 was very dry, so dry that the brooks all stopped running, forcing the miller to suspend the pursuit of his craft. The potato harvest was bad, but on the other hand, there was quite an ample fruit harvest. The dry autumn was followed by a very wet winter when on 17 January 1920, Pfeffelbach and the surrounding area were stricken with a formidable flood. In 1921, an electrical supply network was built in the village. The year 1931 marked the end of an era in Pfeffelbach when Adam Schäfer wove the very last homemade linen on his own loom at his own house. The cottage spinning and weaving industry had once been the norm, with spinning wheels, looms and other equipment for making textiles in every farmhouse. The 1930s saw a spate of railway building. The line from Kusel to Ottweiler opened in 1935. On 16 November of the following year, the whole line from Kusel to Türkismühle opened. The stretch of the Ostertalbahn between Schwarzerden and Ottweiler followed on 15 May 1938. The 1930s also saw the rise of the Third Reich after Adolf Hitler’s seizure of power in Germany in 1933, and the outbreak of the Second World War. Upon Germany’s defeat in 1945, Pfeffelbach found itself in the French zone of occupation. A memorial to the men from Pfeffelbach who had fallen or gone missing in the war was dedicated on 19 November 1961. Sadly, the war had not claimed its last victim by 1945. At about eight o’clock on the morning of the Harvest Festival in 1952, the village was shaken by an explosion. Two young men, Ewald Aulenbacher and Hans Wagen, who had been doing some <b>digging</b> <b>work</b> beside one of the houses, struck a buried Teller mine, which blew up, tearing both men to bits. In 1964, passenger rail service between Kusel and Schwarzerden came to an end, and beginning on 1 June 1967 the railway line closed entirely with the suspension of goods transport as well. On 20 September 1965, preparatory work began for Flurbereinigung. In 1968, the new water cistern was ﬁnished. In August 1991, in the course of the village renewal project, council decided upon an overhaul of the village centre. This included a new fountain complex, a bus waiting hall and parking. In 1992, the contract for this work was awarded to the ﬁrm Alpha-Bau, Kusel, for DM 282,000. A further DM 27,000 contract went to the Peters nursery for the plants. The fountain complex was dedicated on 4 December 1993. The ﬂooding problem in Pfeffelbach’s “Pfarracker” led in October 1995 to a planning contract being awarded to the engineering ofﬁce of Schöer from Waldmohr. On 15 and 16 May 1999, the municipality of Pfeffelbach held its 875-year jubilee celebration. In May 2000, it was decided to renaturate the Oderbach. Also in 2000, plans for a new building zone, “Im Damm”, were set forth. The contract for the work was awarded to the ﬁrm Adams from Halsenbach in August 2002. In December 2004, the municipality decided to establish a website and have an email address.|$|E
