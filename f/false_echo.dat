40|$|The {{effective}} {{radar reflectivity}} Ze {{measured by a}} radar is the convolution of the actual distribution of reflectivity with the beam radiation pattern. Because of the nonlinearity between Z and rain rate R, Ze gives a biased estimator of R whenever the reflectivity field is nonuniform. In the presence of sharp horizontal reflectivity gradients, the measured pattern of Ze extends beyond the actual precipitation boundaries to produce false precipitation echoes. When integrated across the radar image of the storm, the <b>false</b> <b>echo</b> areas contribute to the sum to produce overestimates of the areal rainfall.

5000|$|The idea {{of using}} chaff {{developed}} independently in the United Kingdom, Germany and the United States. In 1937, British researcher Gerald Touch, while working with Robert Watson-Watt on radar, suggested that lengths of wire suspended from balloons or parachutes might overwhelm a radar system with <b>false</b> <b>echoes</b> and R. V. Jones had suggested that pieces of metal foil falling through the air might do the same. In early 1942, a Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE) researcher named Joan Curran investigated the idea {{and came up with}} a scheme for dumping packets of aluminium strips from aircraft to generate a cloud of <b>false</b> <b>echoes.</b> An early idea was to use sheets the size of a notebook page; these would be printed so they would also serve as propaganda leaflets. It was found the most effective version used strips of black paper backed with aluminium foil, exactly 27 × 2 cm and packed into bundles each weighing 1 lb. The head of the TRE, A. P. Rowe, code-named the device [...] "Window". In Germany, similar research had led to the development of Düppel. The German code name came from the estate where the first German tests with chaff took place, circa 1942. Once the British had passed the idea to the US via the Tizard Mission, Fred Whipple developed a system (according to Harvard Gazette Archives) for dispensing strips for the USAAF, but it is not known if this was ever used.|$|R

40|$|With a {{very modest}} {{investment}} in computer hardware and the open source local data manger (LDM) software from UCAR's Unidata Program Center, an individual researcher can receive a variety of NEXRAD Level III gridded rainfall products, and the unprocessed Level II data in real-time from most NEXRAD radars. Additionally, the National Climatic Data Center has vast archives of these products and Level II data. Still, significant obstacles remain in order to unlock the full potential of the data. One set of obstacles is related to effective management of multi-terrabyte data sets: storing, compressing, and backing up. A second set of obstacles, for hydrologists and hydrometeorologists in particular, is that the NEXRAD Level III products are not well suited for application in hydrology. There is a strong need for the generation of high-quality products directly from the Level II data with well-documented steps that include quality control, removal of <b>false</b> <b>echoes,</b> rainfall estimation algorithms with variety of corrections, coordinate conversion and georeferencing, conversion to a convenient data format(s), and integration with GIS.

40|$|The most {{fundamental}} problem in radar is {{the detection of}} an object or a physical phenomenon. This requires proper discrimination between signal and noise content at the receiver even after the echo containing target information is surrounded by clutter. Traditionally, a series of signal processing operations are carried out to perform this discrimination with varying levels of success. These series of signal processing operations can be supplemented by an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), which is a non-parametric prediction tool {{with the ability to}} retain the learning acquired from the surroundings. The Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is a dynamic ANN which can track time variations in the input patterns. The RNN captures time-varying contextual information and use this knowledge subsequently to make discrimination between adjacent patterns. As viewed from the time domain, the target waveform can also be regarded as a time sequence such that it can be classified using RNN which is suitable for time sequence processing. This work describes the processing steps of signals from pulse radars so that these can be used to train a RNN for use to discriminate between target and <b>false</b> <b>echoes.</b> The experimental results show that the proposed system works effectively while dealing with target echoes surrounded by thermal noise and ground clutter at varying distances [1]...|$|R
40|$|The {{principal}} {{effects that}} have been investigated are the attenuation due to shadowing and the occurrence of <b>false</b> <b>echoes</b> in a radar system. For a communication system, the attenuation due {{to the presence of}} the turbine and the modulation due to the movement of the blades and nacelle have been investigated. Some agencies (most Air Navigation Service Providers, for instance) require very large distances to be maintained from their installations, to allow them to follow all air traffic clearly. For special applications however, it is possible to install turbines much closer to the RF installations than one might expect from general rules. The first aspect that has to be noted is that the near-field radar cross section (RCS) [1] of a turbine is much smaller than the far-field formulas [2]. Indeed, the far-field of a turbine is only reached when the turbine is out of view of the installations due to the curvature of the earth. So, the interaction with the turbine happens in the Fresnel zone of the turbine. Approximated formulas for turbines in the far-field of the RF system have already been published in [3]. In this paper, we will investigate a turbine which is even closer namely in the Fresnel zone of an RF system antenna, which has not yet been investigated up to now. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Dynasonde is {{a generic}} {{name for a}} unique {{ideology}} of ionospheric radio sounding which commenced development in the mid 60 ’s at NOAA's forerunner in Boulder, Colorado, the Institute for Telecommunication Sciences and Aeronomy. The name itself was chosen in 1969 to denote “a system competent to sound {{the full range of}} dynamic variation of the ionosphere ” [1]. The distinguishing properties of this ideology are: a) Limited impact to other uses of the radio spectrum. The Dynasonde avoids application of long sequences of pulses at the same base frequency. Instead, short sequences (3 to 8) of narrowband (30 kHz) pulses are used. In these pulse sets the radio frequencies are slightly offset (by 1 - 4 kHz) from the base frequency in a carefully designed pattern to enable precision range measurements (to within a few meters) by the Stationary Phase principle. b) Direct attention to physical properties of the raw data. Mathematical procedures which can have undesirable consequences, such as Fourier transforms, pulse coding, or coherent summation, are not used. Instead, the phase and amplitude of received signals (from raw I&Q) are used directly. As a consequence, low-level Dynasonde data processing yields excellent statistics of recognized echoes characterized by accurate physical parameters, each with its individual error estimate. The same echo recognition and characterization process rejects <b>false</b> <b>echoes</b> and noise. c) Diverse and sophisticated methods of higher-level data processing.

5000|$|Examination of the Würzburg radar {{equipment}} {{brought back to}} the UK during Operation Biting (February 1942) and subsequent reconnaissance revealed to the British that all German radars were operating in no more than three frequency ranges, making them prone to jamming. [...] "Bomber" [...] Harris, Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C) of RAF Bomber Command, finally got approval to use Window as part of Operation Gomorrah, the fire raids against Hamburg. The first aircrew trained to use Window were in 76 squadron. Twenty-four crews were briefed on how to drop the bundles of aluminised-paper strips (treated-paper was used to minimise the weight and to maximise the time that the strips would remain in the air, prolonging the effect), one every minute through the flare chute, using a stopwatch to time them. The results proved spectacular. The radar-guided master searchlights wandered aimlessly across the sky. The anti-aircraft guns fired randomly or not at all and the night fighters, their radar displays swamped with <b>false</b> <b>echoes,</b> utterly failed to find the bomber stream. Over a week of attacks, Allied attacks devastated a vast area of Hamburg, resulting in more than 40,000 civilian deaths, with the loss of only 12 out of the 791 bombers on the first night. Squadrons quickly had special chutes fitted to their bombers to make chaff deployment even easier. Seeing this as a development that made it safer to go on operations, many crews got in as many trips as they could before the Germans found a countermeasure.|$|R
30|$|The STCW Convention {{provides}} required {{components for}} seafarer training, which use the radar simulator {{as a tool}} of training and assessment. These highlights include (Ali 2006; Organization 2006; Teel et al. 2009): factors affecting performance and accuracy; detection of misrepresentation of information, including <b>false</b> <b>echoes</b> and sea returns; setting up and maintaining displays; range and bearing; plotting techniques and relative motion concepts; identification of critical echoes; course and speed of other ships; time and distance of the closest approach to crossing, meeting or overtaking ships; detecting course and speed changes of other ships; effects on the changes of the own ship’s course or speed or both; and application of the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea. To fulfill all of these training requirements, a high performance marine radar simulator is needed. In the current marine radar simulator market, the major developing teams include Nautical Software (2016), Bridge Command (2016), Kongsberg Maritime (2016), Landfall (2016), and Dalian Maritime University Institute of Navigational Technology (2016). In addition, some previous research investigates methods to improve the marine radar simulator. For example, Arnold-Bos et al. developed a versatile bistatic and polarimetric marine radar simulator. In their simulator, realistic sea surfaces are generated using the two-scale model on a semi-deterministic basis, so as to incorporate the presence of ship wakes in the simulation (Arnold-Bos et al. 2006). Yin et al. designed a radar simulator using a PC to generate radar echoes and a radar interface board to generate radar signals. Their simulator has a more flexible and realistic operation interface than other simulators (Yin et al. 2007). Zhang et al. put forward a coastline echo intensity algorithm based on RGB and HIS color models and applied this algorithm on the marine radar simulator. The simulation results from this model are consistent with the electronic chart (Zhang et al. 2010).|$|R
40|$|We {{show the}} results {{obtained}} {{by means of a}} seabed reduction technique on the intensity of geomagnetic anomaly fields applied to a synthetic case and then to the real case of a geomagnetic survey of eastern Ligurian Sea (Italy). The eastern Ligurian Sea has very intense short waves anomaly fields and a sea bed that varies greatly in depth. As a result the geomagnetic space signal is characterized by a very large spectral content; in these conditions {{it is not possible to}} obtain a full sampled marine survey and vertical continuation analytic procedures and standard numerical bottom reduction based on a single vertical incremental parameter, whichever is applicable, fails to give accurate results. The present technique, which has been fine-tuned over 4 years of experimentation in environmental researchs, aims to provide a simple and efficient means to reduce the distortion of geomagnetic anomalies field caused by the variation of distance between survey plane and magnetic outcrop source position. The compensation procedure is based on evaluation, by comparison of two measurements carried out at different altitudes, of the mean vertical increment typical of each anomaly field principal frequency component bands. The component anomaly fields are then corrected by application of the corresponding vertical increments and lastly, the anomaly geomagnetic field reduced to the sea-bed is computed as Inverse Fourier Transform of a spectrum built as synthesis of the component anomaly fields' spectra. The results obtained have shown a notable increase in definition of anomaly field intensity without the production of appreciable distortions or <b>false</b> geomagnetic <b>echoes...</b>|$|R

Detecting and classifying odontocete species {{through their}} echolocation clicks {{has been proven}} successful by other studies, but {{the differences between the}} recordings can impact the accuracy of the classification. This thesis studies the means of properly removing background noise from the recordings and the effects of the detection and classification algorithm on the resulting echolocation clicks, using the species of Pacific White-Sided Dolphins and Risso's Dolphins. Differentiating between echolocation clicks and ambient noise is done using a function of the relative energy in the recording. An inverse transfer function is retrieved from a separate server based on the location and time at which the recording was taken, and applied to each recording in order to undo the changes made by the recording equipment's preamplifier. Echolocation clicks are further validated based on their length, energy, and frequency values to eliminate <b>false</b> detections. <b>Echo</b> sounders are also detected and removed through auto-correlating the times of the detected echolocation clicks and removing those found at regular intervals. The remaining detected clicks were grouped based on various criteria, including sighting, preamplifier setting, and recording site, and subjected to a 3 -fold experiment that trains GMM's with the clicks of a few groups and tests the remaining groups using the probabilities of the models. The results show that in all groupings, removal of the background noise from the echolocation clicks improves the error rate over 100 tests. The baseline grouping, by sighting, showed an improved error rate from 1. 9 % to 0. 4 %...|$|R
40|$|The {{planetary}} radar (e. g. MARSIS) {{data inversion}} {{is based on}} the selection of groups of stationary frames, within the area under investigation, that shall be statistically analyzed after suitable correction. The selection step includes the recovery of bad/poor data and the estimation of the geometrical surface and subsurface features; these feature shall be utilized in order to obtain data that are only dependent by the material nature of the inclusion, within the layer, and of the interface. This paper is addressed to the techniques used for the frames selection, recovery and their geometric estimation content. As first step, frames have been selected in Mars areas where the surface and subsurface have a physical optics behavior (i. e. quite flat); the surface flatness has been estimated according to a simulator based on MOLA (Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter) data while the subsurface has been estimated taking into account the Doppler filters content (i. e. filter 0, + 1, - 1). Being the surface and subsurface quite flat only small geometric contribution have been estimated and used for correction of the received echoes. To perform this task surface and subsurface models have been developed, under the Kirchhoff approximation hypothesis, to be compared with the experimental data. A figure showing the different material nature of different areas of the Mars South Pole has been drawn. The discovery of areas with an high dielectric constant led geologists to analyze those areas with other instrument to confirm the results obtained by MARSIS. This paper outlines also the way out for future works in order to analyze more complex surface and subsurface scenarios where conditions for geometric optics or fractal can be present. In this case, it will be mandatory to develop a clutter cancellation technique to avoid the presence of <b>false</b> subsurface <b>echoes</b> generated by surface and subsurface features not immediately below the nadir direction of observation. It will be also necessary to improve the access to the simulator for a quickly accomplishment of this task. In addition it is necessary a deeper analysis of the volumetric clutter including its distribution within the layer thickness. A fully automation of the frames selection will be set for a fast analysis of wide areas of Mars. Finally a data fusion with SHARAD data will improve the reliability and the validity of the obtained results...|$|R
