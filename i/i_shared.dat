5|$|The {{pre-production}} Griffon <b>I</b> <b>shared</b> the R engine's bore and stroke, but {{was otherwise}} {{a completely new}} design that first ran in the Experimental Department in November 1939. Although this single engine was never flown, the production version, the Griffon II, first flew in 1941 installed in the Fairey Firefly. A {{significant difference between the}} R and the production Griffon was the re-location of the camshaft and supercharger drives {{to the front of the}} engine to reduce overall length. Another length-reducing measure was the use of a single magneto (the R had two, mounted at the rear), this again was moved to the front of the engine.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} his reign, Neferhotep <b>I</b> <b>shared</b> {{the throne}} with his brother Sihathor, a coregency that lasted a few months to a year. Sihathor died shortly before Neferhotep, who {{probably}} then appointed another brother, Sobekhotep IV, as coregent. In any case, Sobekhotep IV succeeded Neferhotep I soon afterwards, and reigned over Egypt for almost a decade. The reigns of the two brothers mark the apex of the 13th Dynasty.|$|E

25|$|The Stirling Castle {{was still}} {{under the control of}} War Transport and was {{equipped}} more or less as a troopship - no luxury cabins as the case for the team now. Laurie Fishlock and <b>I</b> <b>shared</b> a cabin so small that we could hardly turn round. The ship was 'dry' and on board were some 700 war brides returning to Australia.|$|E
25|$|Among his {{personal}} interests was the accumulation and breeding of Arabian horses. In horses obtained as taxes and tribute, Muhammad Ali recognised the unique characteristics and {{careful attention to}} bloodlines of the horses bred by the Bedouin, particularly by the Anazeh in Syria and those bred in the Nejd. While his immediate successor had minimal interest in the horse breeding program, his grandson, who became Abbas <b>I</b> <b>shared</b> this interest and further built upon his work.|$|E
25|$|Maximilian <b>I</b> <b>shared</b> rule {{with his}} father during the latter year of Frederick's reign, being elected King of the Romans in 1486. By {{acquiring}} the lands of the Tyrolean line of the Habsburgs in 1490 he finally reunited all the Austrian lands, divided since 1379. He also needed {{to deal with the}} Hungarian problem when Mathias I died in 1490. Maximilian reconquered the lost parts of Austria and established peace with Mathias's successor Vladislaus II at the Peace of Pressburg in 1491. However the dynastic pattern of division and unification would be one that kept repeating itself over time. With unsettled borders Maximilian found Innsbruck in the Tyrol a safer place for a capital, between his Burgundian and Austrian lands, although he was rarely in any place for very long, being acutely aware of how his father had been repeatedly besieged in Vienna.|$|E

One reviewer even speculated {{it to be an}} allusion by the vehicle's French-born designer Olivier Boulay to the Renault 4CV, France's popular post-war [...] "people's car" [...] with which the <b>i</b> <b>shared</b> its four-seat, rear-engined layout. Its styling was formally lauded when the i won the Grand Prize at the 50th anniversary Good Design Awards from the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry in October 2006, the first kei car to win the award.|$|E

Upset that Donald Trump won the election, Madonna spoke out against him at the Women's March on Washington, a day after his inauguration. The singer sparked controversy {{when she said that}} she [...] "thought a lot about blowing up the White House". The following day, she asserted she was [...] "not a violent person" [...] and that her quote had been [...] "taken wildly out of context", adding [...] "I spoke in metaphor and <b>I</b> <b>shared</b> two ways of looking at things — one was to be hopeful, and one was to feel anger and outrage". In February 2017, Madonna adopted four-year-old twin sisters from Malawi named Esther and Stella. In late summer 2017, Madonna moved to Lisbon, Portugal with her adoptive children.|$|E

2500|$|When {{the news}} of the Greek Revolution was first received, the {{reaction}} of the European powers was uniformly hostile.

However, Walker's girlfriend Louise, who was present on the night of his murder, said she never would forgive them adding, [...] "I hate them for what they have done. Anthony and <b>I</b> <b>shared</b> something special. Now he has been taken away from me by those two evil young men. I still feel that he (Anthony Walker) is around.

2500|$|Promoted to full {{general in}} 1962, he was {{assigned}} as vice {{chief of staff of}} the U.S. Army amid speculation that he would soon succeed Army chief of staff George H. Decker, who was not expected to be reappointed. As vice chief of staff, Hamlett negotiated the creation of U.S. Strike Command with Air Force chief of staff Curtis E. LeMay, played a key role in Army operations during the Cuban Missile Crisis, and participated in the escalation of the Vietnam War. Reflecting on this period later, Hamlett said, [...] "I think the most important thing was something I didn't recommend; and that was that we didn't become involved in Vietnam to the point where we would have to commit combat forces. I think it was a failure, and I would have to say that <b>I</b> <b>shared</b> the responsibility because I didn't see far enough ahead to speak out." ...|$|E
2500|$|Former {{legislative}} colleague Ron Gomez described Gunter {{as having}} what urban people call [...] "street smarts, that innate ability, also common to many rural folk, to smell a phony an acre away, {{to be suspicious}} of everyone who didn't dress or talk like him and to cut {{to the heart of}} a matter with cold precision. His politics were populist in nature. He was regularly graded high by organized labor and low by business and professional associations", such as the Louisiana Association of Business and Industry. Gomez said that he and Gunter did not become friends but [...] "shared a mutual respect. Whether <b>I</b> <b>shared</b> Carl's beliefs or he disliked the way I talked, we realized that we both got to the House the same way and for the same reason: we were there to represent the people of our respective districts. I hoped that all {{the other members of the}} House practiced that philosophy." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{spent his}} early {{childhood}} {{years on the}} family farm, and acquired a taste for reading from his father's extensive library, which included Homer and Shakespeare. His father died in August 1914. [...] In 1918 van der Post went to school at Grey College in Bloemfontein. There, he wrote, {{it was a great}} shock to him that he was [...] "being educated into something which destroyed the sense of common humanity <b>I</b> <b>shared</b> with the black people". In 1925 he took his first job as a reporter in training at The Natal Advertiser in Durban, where his reporting included his own accomplishments playing on the Durban and Natal field hockey teams. In 1926 he and two other rebellious writers, Roy Campbell and William Plomer, published a satirical magazine called Voorslag (...) which criticised imperialist systems; it lasted for three issues before being forced to shut down because of its controversial views. Later that year he took off for three months with Plomer and sailed to Tokyo and back on a Japanese freighter, the Canada Maru, an experience which produced books by both authors later in life.|$|E
