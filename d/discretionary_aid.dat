40|$|Updated October 2004 Should a donor {{delegate}} {{the responsibility}} for allocating its aid budget to a less inequality-averse agent to alleviate {{the consequences of the}} Samaritan’s Dilemma it is facing? I show that when aid impact differs across recipients the optimal type of agent depends on whether or not committing to a greater share for countries where the productivity of aid is low raises the combined domestic incomes of recipients. This is the case for donors too concerned with efficiency ex post. They therefore delegate the decision on the <b>discretionary</b> <b>aid</b> allocation rule to agents more sensitive to distributional issues than themselves...|$|E
40|$|The first {{historical}} {{account of}} federal crime control policy, "From Social Welfare to Social Control" contextualizes the mass incarceration of marginalized Americans by illuminating {{the process that}} gave rise to the modern carceral state in the decades after the Civil Rights Movement. The dissertation examines the development of the national law enforcement program during its initial two decades, from the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, which established the block grant system and a massive federal investment into penal and juridical agencies, to the Omnibus Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, which set sentencing guidelines that ensured historic incarceration rates. During this critical period, Presidential Administrations, State Departments, and Congress refocused the domestic agenda from social programs to crime and punishment. To challenge our understanding of the liberal welfare state and the rise of modern conservatism, "From Social Welfare to Social Control" emphasizes the bipartisan dimensions of punitive policy and situates crime control as the dominant federal response to the social and demographic transformations brought about by mass protest and the decline of domestic manufacturing. The federal government's decision to manage the material consequences of rising unemployment, subpar school systems, and poverty in American cities as they manifested through crime reinforced violence within the communities national law enforcement legislation targeted with billions of dollars in grant funds from 1968 onwards. By highlighting the role of race-neutral language in federal policy following civil rights legislation, the study also exposes the way structural racism endured after racism in the public sphere was no longer acceptable. Tracking the discretionary portion of the law enforcement budget that Congress permitted the White House to spend autonomously illustrates the way racism grounded color-blind crime control programs over time. With novel use of <b>discretionary</b> <b>aid,</b> White House Officials enlarged the federal government's influence over local authorities while still operating through the new states' rights paradigm the Safe Streets Act created via block grants. On the ground, federal law enforcement assistance heightened patrol forces in black urban neighborhoods and social institutions, causing disproportionate arrest rates and the unprecedented entrance of young Americans from areas of segregated poverty into state and federal penitentiaries. At the close of the first twenty years of the national law enforcement program, the number of inmates in American prisons had more than tripled. Ultimately, the dissertation questions the way the federal government helped to facilitate the process through which the state apparatus of punishment [...] including law enforcement, criminal justice, border management, and prison systems [...] quickly developed into its own viable industry in the context of urban deindustrialization and disinvestment. In contributing to debates about the persistence of poverty in the United States and drawing our attention to the federal government's role in sustaining punitive policy that first emerged in the 1960 s, "From Social Welfare to Social Control" provides critical insight {{to one of the most}} important questions facing our society: why, in the land of the free, are more than one in a hundred American citizens in prison or jail...|$|E
40|$|Analyzing the “sophomore slump” has plagued {{researchers}} for decades. This {{consultancy project}} analyzed some {{quantitative and qualitative}} data from a small, private university and developed key recommendations to help address sophomore attrition. The analysis contained a quantitative component {{which led to the}} collection of student profiles that were used to examine specific phenomenon from a more qualitative perspective. Through the process, the project underwent constant revision but maintained the initial scope and boundaries. Work plans, financial assessments, and risk mitigation plans were developed throughout the lifecycle of the project and communicated to key stakeholders. Several challenges included the collection of qualitative data as well as waning support from the university administration concerning the effectiveness of retention planning. The resulting recommendations included (1) reexamining the pre-nursing pathway and academic advising, (2) releasing non-scholarship athletes from all the requirements of scholarship athletes, particularly while out of season, (3) reevaluation of words like “home” and “family” as part of university marketing, (4) releasing additional <b>discretionary</b> financial <b>aid</b> sums to target sophomores, and (5) reinvesting in personnel and infrastructure for the Office of Student Success...|$|R
40|$|For {{the last}} two decades, the primary {{instruments}} for UK regional policy have been <b>discretionary</b> subsidies. Such <b>aid</b> is targeted at "additional" projects - projects {{that would not have}} been implemented without the subsidy - and the subsidy should be the minimum necessary for the project to proceed. Discretionary subsidies are thought to be more efficient than automatic subsidies, where many of the aided projects are non-additional and all projects receive the same subsidy rate. The present paper builds on Swales (1995) and Wren (2007 a) to compare three subsidy schemes: an automatic scheme and two types of discretionary scheme, one with accurate appraisal and the other with appraisal error. These schemes are assessed on their expected welfare impacts. The particular focus is the reduction in welfare gain imposed by the interaction of appraisal error and the requirements for accountability. This is substantial and difficult to detect with conventional evaluation techniques...|$|R
