5000|$|Reed valves, of the <b>feather</b> <b>valve</b> type, {{are used}} in small, single acting {{compressors}} that have relatively high revolutions per minute. In air brake compressors, the cantilevered reed valve is used. These type of reed valves result in high losses and are difficult to service ...|$|E
40|$|In this research, {{a method}} {{previously}} applied to improve a digital simulation of the avian syrinx {{is adapted to}} the geometry of the clarinet reed. The clarinet model is studied with {{particular attention to the}} case when the reed beats again the lay of the mouthpiece, closing off air flow to the bore once each period. In place of the standard reed table which gives steady-state volume flow as a function of constant pressure difference across the reed, a more realistic dynamic volume flow model is proposed. The differential equation governing volume flow dynamics is seen to have a singularity at the point of reed closure, where both the volume flow and reed channel area become zero. The feathered clarinet reed refers to the method, first used in the syrinx, to smooth or feather the volume flow cutoff in a closing <b>valve.</b> The <b>feathered</b> <b>valve</b> eliminates the singularity and reduces artifacts in the simulated clarinet output. 1...|$|R
50|$|Continuous {{combustion}} engines—as well as piston engines—usually have valves {{that open}} and close to admit the fuel and/or air at the startup and shutdown. Some <b>valves</b> <b>feather</b> to adjust the flow to control power or engine speed as well.|$|R
50|$|On 1 July 1992, a Kendell Airlines, SAAB 340A, VH-EKT, on a {{scheduled}} passenger service from Melbourne, Victoria to Devonport, Tasmania with 17 passengers and 3 crew lost directional control on landing. The aircraft departed the runway and ran through a ditch in soft muddy ground. Substantial damage was sustained to the aircraft {{but there were}} no injuries to passengers or crew. The cause, a severe asymmetric thrust condition developed after landing when reverse thrust was selected but the right propeller remained at a positive blade angle. This was due to the right propeller control unit being defective from an internal oil leakage across the <b>feathering</b> solenoid <b>valve.</b> The aircraft was repaired and returned to service. It still flies today as a cargo aircraft.|$|R
50|$|These valves {{coincided with}} a change in firing behaviour. Rather than demonstrating their {{virility}} by always showing a <b>feather</b> at the <b>valve,</b> firemen now tried to avoid noisy blowing off, especially around stations or under the large roof of a major station. This was mostly {{at the behest of}} stationmasters, but firemen also realised that any blowing off through a pop valve wasted several pounds of boiler pressure; estimated at 20 psi lost and 16 lbs or more of shovelled coal.|$|R
50|$|Developments in {{high-pressure}} water-tube boilers {{for marine}} use placed more demands on safety valves. Valves of greater capacity were required, to vent safely the high steam-generating capacity of these large boilers. As the force on their valves increased, {{the issue of}} the spring's increasing stiffness as its load increased (like the Naylor valve) became more critical. The need to reduced <b>valve</b> <b>feathering</b> became even more important with high-pressure boilers, as this represented both a loss of distilled feedwater and also a scouring of the valve seats, leading to wear.|$|R
6000|$|... "At {{half past}} nine I tried the {{experiment}} of throwing out {{a handful of}} <b>feathers</b> through the <b>valve.</b> They did not float as I had expected; but dropped down perpendicularly, like a bullet, en masse, and with the greatest velocity--being {{out of sight in}} a very few seconds. I did not at first {{know what to make of}} this extraordinary phenomenon; not being able to believe that my rate of ascent had, of a sudden, met with so prodigious an acceleration. But it soon occurred to me that the atmosphere was now far too rare to sustain even the feathers; that they actually fell, as they appeared to do, with great rapidity; and that I had been surprised by the united velocities of their descent and my own elevation.|$|R
