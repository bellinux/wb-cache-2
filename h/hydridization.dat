The <b>hydridization</b> between the local moments and conduction electrons can weaken near the surface, and this enables the local moments to form spin liquids.

We have developed a method to isolate Escherichia coli mRNA by polyadenylating it in crude cell extracts with E. coli poly(A) polymerase I and purifying it by oligo(dT) chromatography. Differences in lacZRNA levels were similar with purified mRNA and total RNA in dot blot <b>hydridizations</b> for cultures grown with or without gratuitous induction of the lactose operon. More broadly, changes in gene expression upon induction were similar when cDNAs primed from mRNA or total RNA with random hexanucleotides were hydridized to DNA microarrays for the E. coli genome. Comparable signal intensities were obtained with only 1 % as much oligo(dT) -purified mRNA as total RNA, and hence in vitro poly(A) tailing appears to be selective for mRNA. These and additional studies of genome-wide expression with DNA microarrays provide evidence that in vitro poly(A) tailing works universally for E. coli mRNAs...|$|R

Astronomical observations {{have shown that}} this feature is composed of two separate bands at 3. 28 and 3. 30 μm and the origin of these two bands is unclear. In this paper, we perform vibrational analyses based on quantum mechanical calculations of 153 organic molecules, including both pure aromatic molecules and molecules with mixed aromatic/olefinic/aliphatic <b>hydridizations.</b> We find {{that many of the}} C-H stretching vibrational modes in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules are coupled. Even considering the un-coupled modes only, the correlation between the band intensity ratios and the structure of the PAH molecule is not observed and the 3. 28 and 3. 30 μm features cannot be directly interpreted in the PAH model. Based on these results, the possible aromatic, olefinic and aliphatic origins of the 3. 3 μm feature are discussed. We suggest that the 3. 28 μm feature is assigned to aromatic C-H stretch whereas the 3. 30 μm feature is olefinic. From the ratio of these two features, the relative olefinic to aromatic content of the carrier can be determined. Comment: 33 pages, 14 figures. Accepted for publication in Ap...|$|R

These physical properties {{appear to be in}} contradiction, since both depend on G + C content. In order to resolve this anomaly, base compositions were directly determined for isolated fractions. the low-"melting" component S contains 41. 8 % G + C, with 6 % of C present as 5 -methylcytosine, whereas Q DNA contains 54 % G + C, with 41 % of C methylated. Analyses of restriction site loss agreed well with the direct determinations of methylation and divergence, and indicated some clustering of methylated sites in Q DNA. Analysis of restricted main-band DNA by <b>hydridization</b> with RNA complementary to Q satellite DNA ("Southern transfer") showed satellite Q tandem arrays interspersed in DNA of main-band density. Sequence divergence and extent of methylation did not appear to depend on whether a repeat array was present as satellite or interspersed in main-band DNA. <b>Hydridization</b> in situ indicated considerable heterogeneity in the genomic proportion of the Q-DNA sequences in melon fruit nuclei, implying over- and under-representation consistent with extensive unequal recombination in satellite Q tandem arrays.

The electronic energy gap (band gap) closes at 20, 000 K at a density half that of zero-temperature metallization, resulting in electrical conductivities greater than the minimum metallic value. Gap closure is achieved by a broadening of the valence band via increased s–p <b>hydridization</b> with increasing temperature, and this influences the equation of state: The Grüneisen parameter, which determines the adiabatic temperature–depth gradient inside a planet, changes only modestly, decreasing with compression up to the high-temperature metallization and then increasing upon further compression.

C-ros gene encodes a receptor-type protein tyrosine kinase that is expressed in adult mice exclusively in the epithelial cells of the initial segment of the epididymis.

Both parameters are shown to be intrinsic material properties. Reducing the specific surface area {{can be accomplished by}} making use of non-stoichiometric compounds in which the A-type atoms in the crystal lattice are partly replaced by dumbell pairs of B-type atoms. Electrochemically stable non-stoichiometric compounds are characterized by the absence of a clear discrete a-to-ß phase transition upon <b>hydridization,</b> through which particle size reduction of the powder during electrochemical activation remains limited. Compounds with a composition close to or above the as-denoted 2 ̆ 2 critical composition 2 ̆ 2 meet this requirement. On the other hand, lowering the oxidation rate constant can successfully be achieved by replacing part of the A-type atoms by other lanthanides and/or part of the B-type atoms by other transition metals within the AB 5 stoichiometry. This leads to so-called multicomponent compounds. Although the hydride-formation/decomposition reaction mechanism for this type of compound is shown to be accompanied by a pronounced discrete phase transition, a relatively low oxidation rate constant ensures a good overall electrochemical cycling stability...|$|E
40|$|Covariation in the {{structural}} {{composition of the}} gut microbiome and the spectroscopically derived metabolic phenotype (metabotype) of a rodent model for obesity were investigated using a range of multivariate statistical tools. Urine and plasma samples from three strains of 10 -week-old male Zucker rats (obese (fa/fa, n = 8), lean (fal-, n = 8) and lean (-/-, n = 8)) were characterized via high-resolution H- 1 NMR spectroscopy, and in parallel, the fecal microbial composition was investigated using fluorescence in situ <b>hydridization</b> (FISH) and {{denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis}} (DGGE) methods. All three Zucker strains had different relative abundances of the dominant members of their intestinal microbiota (FISH), with the novel observation of a Halomonas and a Sphingomonas species being present in the (fa/fa) obese strain on the basis of DGGE data. The two functionally and phenotypically normal Zucker strains (fal- and -/-) were readily distinguished from the (fa/fa) obese rats {{on the basis of their}} metabotypes with relatively lower urinary hippurate and creatinine, relatively higher levels of urinary isoleucine, leucine and acetate and higher plasma LDL and VLDL levels typifying the (fa/fa) obese strain. Collectively, these data suggest a conditional host genetic involvement in selection of the microbial species in each host strain, and that both lean and obese animals could have specific metabolic phenotypes that are linked to their individual microbiomes...|$|E
