40|$|Bacteria {{are able}} to induce {{carbonate}} precipitation although the participation of microbial or chemical processes in speleothem formation remains a matter of debate. In this study, the origin of carbonate depositions such as moonmilk, an unconsolidated microcrystalline formation with high water content, and the consolidation of carbonate precipitates into hard speleothems were analyzed. The utilized methods included measurements of the composition of stable isotopes in these precipitates, <b>fluorimetric</b> <b>determinations</b> of RNA/DNA ratios and respirometric estimations in Altamira Cave. Results from isotope composition showed increases of the δ 18 O and δ 13 C ratios from moonmilk {{in the very first}} stages of formation toward large speleothems. Estimates of RNA/DNA ratios suggested an inactivation of microorganisms from incipient moonmilk toward consolidated deposits of calcium carbonate. Respiratory activity of microorganisms also showed a significant decrease in samples with accumulated calcite. These results suggest that bacterial activity induces the conditions required for calcium carbonate precipitation, initiating the first stages of deposition. Progressive accumulation of carbonate leads towards a less favorable environment for the development of bacteria. On consolidated speleothems, the importance of bacteria in carbonate deposition decreases and chemical processes gain importance in the deposition of carbonates.

40|$|Abstract Background Lenalidomide (LND) is {{a potent}} novel {{thalidomide}} analog which demonstrated remarkable clinical activity in treatment of multiple myeloma disease via a multiple-pathways mechanism. The strong evidences-based clinical success of LND in patients has led to its recent approval by US-FDA under the trade name of Revlimid® capsules by Celgene Corporation. Fluorimetry is a convenient technique for pharmaceutical quality control, however there was a <b>fluorimetric</b> method for <b>determination</b> of LND in its bulk and capsules. Results A novel highly sensitive and simple fluorimetric method has been developed and validated for the determination of lenalidmide (LND) in its bulk and dosage forms (capsules). The method was based on nucleophilic substitution reaction of LND with fluorescamine (FLC) in aqueous medium to form a highly fluorescent derivative that was measured at 494 nm after excitation at 381 nm. The factors affecting the reaction were carefully studied and optimized. The kinetics of the reaction was investigated, and the reaction mechanism was postulated. Under the optimized conditions, linear relationship with good correlation coefficient (0. 9999) {{was found between the}} fluorescence intensity and LND concentration in the range of 25 – 300 ng/mL. The limits of detection and quantitation for the method were 2. 9 and 8. 7 ng/mL, respectively. The precision of the method was satisfactory; the values of relative standard deviations did not exceed 1. 4 %. The proposed method was successfully applied to the determination of LND in its bulk form and pharmaceutical capsules with good accuracy; the recovery values were 97. 8 – 101. 4 ± 1. 08 – 2. 75 %.

40|$|MastersThe study {{described}} {{the development and}} validation of two analytical methods for the determination of three therapeutically important and widely used selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant drugs (SSRIs). These drugs were fluvoxamine (FXM), fluoxetine (FLX), and paroxetine (PXT). The drawbacks encountered in the analytical methods reported in literatures {{for the analysis of}} these drugs were behind the interest in selection of these drugs to be the targets of the study. The two methods developed in the present study include spectrophotometric and fluorimetric methods: SPECTROPHOTOMETRIC METHOD This method was based on nucleophilic substitution reaction of the investigated SSRI drug with 1, 2 -naphthoquinone- 4 -sulphonate (NQS) in an alkaline medium to form an orange-colored product of maximum absorption peak (max) at 470 nm for FXM, and at 490 nm for FLX and PXT. The factors affecting the reactions were investigated and optimized. The stoichiometry and kinetics of the reactions were studied, and the reaction mechanisms were postulated. Under the optimized reaction conditions, Beer`s law correlating the absorbance (A) with SSRI concentrations (C) was obeyed in the range of 0. 3 - 8 μg/ml with good correlation coefficients (0. 9992 – 0. 9997). The molar absorptivities () were 4. 8 × 105, 5. 9 × 105, and 5. 8 × 105 l/mol/ 1 cm for FXM, FLX, and PXT, respectively. The limits of detection were 0. 1 μg/ml for FLX, and 0. 2 μg/ml for FXM and PXT. The limits of quantitation were 0. 3 μg/ml for FLX, and 0. 6 μg/ml for FXM and PXT. The precision of the method was satisfactory; the values of relative standard deviations did not exceed 2 %. The proposed method was successfully applied to the determination of the investigated SSRIs in their pharmaceutical tablets with good accuracy and precisions; the label claim percentages were 99. 2 – 100. 5  0. 96 – 1. 61 %. The results obtained by the proposed method were compared with that those obtained from the official method by statistical analysis with respect to the accuracy (by t-test) and precision (by F-test). No {{significant differences were found between}} the calculated and theoretical values of t- and F-tests at 95 % confidence level proving similar accuracy and precision in the determination of SSRIs by both methods. FLUORIMETRIC METHOD This method was based on nucleophilic substitution reaction of the investigated SSRI drug with 4 -chloro- 7 -nitrobenzo- 2 -oxa- 1, 3 -diazole (NBD-Cl) in an alkaline medium (pH 8) to form highly fluorescent derivatives. The fluorescence intensities were measured at 535 nm (for FXM) and 545 nm (for FLX and PXT) after their excitation at maximum wavelength (ex) at 470 nm (for FXM) and 490 nm (for FLX and PXT). The factors affecting the reactions were carefully studied and optimized. The kinetics of the reactions were investigated, and the reaction mechanisms were presented. Under the optimized conditions, linear relationship with good correlation coefficients (0. 9992 – 0. 9995) were found between the fluorescence intensity and SSRI concentrations in the general range of 35 – 800 ng/ml. The limits of detection were 11, 21, and 25 ng/ml for FLX, FXM, and PXT, respectively. The limits of quantitation were 33, 64, and 77 ng/ml FLX, FXM, and PXT, respectively. The precision of the method was satisfactory; the values of relative standard deviations did not exceed 3 %. The proposed method was successfully applied to the determination of the investigated SSRIs in their pharmaceutical tablets with good accuracy and precisions; the label claim percentages were 99. 2 – 100. 8  1. 32 – 1. 83 %. This results were compared with those obtained from the official method by statistical analysis with respect to the accuracy (by t-test) and precision (by F-test). No significant differences were found between the calculated and theoretical values of t- and F-tests at 95 % confidence level proving similar accuracy and precision in the determination of SSRIs by both methods. The proposed fluorimetric method was superior to the previously reported <b>fluorimetric</b> methods for <b>determination</b> of SSRIs in terms of its simplicity and sensitivity. The high sensitivity of the proposed method allowed its applicability to the determination of FXM and PXT in spiked human plasma, but not for FLX because of the interference of its main metabolite norfluoxetine. Proper extraction procedures with organic solvents were adopted in the analysis of FXM and PXT. The extraction procedures should be carried out before the derivatization of FXM and PXT to avoid the interference of water-soluble reactive biogenic amines. The results of the analysis were satisfactorily accurate and precise as the recovery values were 97. 4 – 102. 2 % with relative standard deviations of less than 3 %...|$|R

The concentration of DPA in natural samples is converted into endospore numbers using endospore-forming pure cultures as standards. Quenching of the fluorescence by sediment constituents and background fluorescence due to humic substances hampered direct determination of DPA in sediments. To overcome those interferences, DPA was extracted using ethyl acetate prior to fluorimetric measurements of DPA concentrations. The first results indicated that endospore numbers obtained with this method are orders of magnitude higher than numbers obtained by cultivation after pasteurization. In one of the explored sediment cores, endospores accounted for 3 % of all stainable prokaryotic cells...|$|E
40|$|This paper proposes {{new methods}} for simple and {{sensitive}} spectrophotometric and <b>fluorimetric</b> <b>determination</b> of naltrexone (NALT) in tablet and biological fluids. The spectrophotometric method involve {{addition of a}} known excess of Ce(IV) to NALT in acid medium, followed by determination of residual Ce(IV) by reacting with a fixed amount of methyl orange, and measuring the absorbance at 510 nm. Fluorimetric method {{was based on the}} oxidation of NALT with Ce(IV) to produce Ce(III) and its fluorescence was monitored at 350 nm after excitation at 250 nm. In both methods, the amount of Ce(IV) reacted corresponds to the amount of NALT and the measured absorbance or fluorescence were found to increase linearly with the concentration of NALT, which are corroborated by the correlation coefficients of 0. 9999 and 0. 9996 for spectrophotometric and fluorimetric methods, respectively. Different variables affecting the reaction conditions such as the concentrations of Ce(IV), type and concentration of acid medium, reaction time, temperature, and the diluting solvents were carefully studied and optimized. The accuracy and precision of the methods were evaluated on intra-day and inter-day basis. The proposed methods were successfully applied for the determination of NALT in pharmaceutical formulation and biological samples with good recoveries...|$|E
40|$|Trabalho completo: acesso restrito, p. 1100 – 1103 The present work {{describes}} {{the development of}} a fast and robust sequential injection fluorimetric procedure for the determination of Sn in juices of canned fruits. The developed automatic methodology is based on the complexation of Sn with 8 -hydroxyquinoline- 5 -sulfonic acid (HQSA) to form a fluorimetric product (λexc = 354 nm; λem = 510 nm). The influence of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and cetylpyridinium bromide (CPB) on the sensitivity of the <b>fluorimetric</b> <b>determination</b> was evaluated. Linear calibration plots were obtained for Sn concentrations between 1 and 10 mg L− 1, with a detection limit of 0. 38 mg L− 1. In each analytical cycle 0. 006 mg of HQSA and 0. 47 mg of CPB were consumed and 1. 5 mL of effluent was generated. The developed methodology was applied to the determination of Sn in juices of canned fruits and the results complied with those furnished by an electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry comparison procedure, with relative deviations lower than 5. 2 %. The automatic procedure exhibited good precision (R. S. D. < 1. 4 %) and the sampling rate was about 70 determinations per hour...|$|E
40|$|The {{catalase}} mimetic complex Mn(III) -salen chloride (EUK 8) {{was found}} to be pro-oxidant under low hydrogen peroxide concentrations. The increase in the fluorescence rate of the probe 1, 2, 3 -dihydrorhodamine (DHR) in solution, as well as the carbonyl content of human serum albumin were found to be maximum at H(2) O(2) :EUK 8 molar ratios ranging from 0 to 2, supporting previous findings regarding the mechanism of EUK 8 catalase activity and the formation of highly oxidative Mn(V) -O(2 -) species. This pro-oxidant effect is precluded by the presence of glutathione. Cytotoxicity to HeLa cells, as probed by increased rate of oxidation of intracellular DHR, was not observed. Our findings suggest that the combination of H(2) O(2) and EUK 8 at specific molar ratios, in the absence of reductants/antioxidants, induces the oxidation of organic molecules. It is shown that the <b>fluorimetric</b> <b>determination</b> of pro-oxidant activity of metal complexes is more sensitive than the colorimetric quantification of protein carbonyl content. The implications of our findings with respect to the somewhat confusing results arising from in vivo studies of EUK 8 and other Mn(III) anti-oxidant metal complexes are discussed...|$|E
40|$|SBFO is {{a commercially}} {{available}} fluorescent indicator for {{the determination of}} Na+ concentrations. To investigate the reversible reaction of Na+ with this indicator {{in the ground and}} excited states, steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence measurements were performed. Global compartmental analysis was used to describe the fluorescence decay surfaces yielding the following values for the rate constants at room temperature in aqueous solution at pH 7. 2 : k(01) = 5 x 10 (8) s(- 1), 2 x 10 (7) M- 1 s(- 1) < k(21) < 3 x 10 (8) M- 1 s(- 1), k(02) = 5 x 10 (8) s(- 1), k(12) = 1 x 10 (8) s(- 1). k(01) and k(02) denote the respective deactivation rate constants of the Na+ free and bound forms of the indicator in the excited state. k(21) represents the second-order rate constant of association of Na+ with SBFO in the excited state, whereas k(12) is the first-order rate constant of dissociation of the excited Na+-indicator complex. The effect of the reversible excited-state reaction between Na+ and the indicator on the <b>fluorimetric</b> <b>determination</b> of K-d can be neglected. status: publishe...|$|E
