40|$|This article {{introduces}} {{an original}} <b>documentation</b> <b>and</b> <b>archiving</b> tool, CloudPad, that integrates 'cloud computing' into the annotation and synchronisation of mixed media resources. Through CloudPad users {{are able to}} view a documentation, edit a version of it, and record their own comments in response to it. Whether users may have created and/or experienced a particular work, or whether they may simply wish to consult a work's documentation, their journey through these records and annotations are subsumed into the work's documentation, thus augmenting the 'original' artwork's field of social engagement. Before discussing CloudPad in detail, we proceed to explain how recent debates in performance documentation influenced our methodology and development, and the general challenges of mixed reality documentation that CloudPad aims to address.

40|$|This poster {{provides}} a preliminary {{description of the}} linguistic features of Kibembe, a language spoken in Congo and by {{a small group of}} refugees in the Boise area. Kibembe is characterized as an Atlantic-Congo, Narrow Bantu, Central language within the Niger-Congo language family and, although it is spoken by over 252, 000 people around the world, it is virtually undocumented in the linguistic literature. Over the course of a semester, our group met with a native speaker of Kibembe to document the phonological, morphological, and syntactic features of the language. This analysis, along with recordings made by our group, serves the greater linguistic community by providing theoretical linguists with new language data to support their research. It will also serve the Kibembe community in the diaspora by providing <b>documentation</b> <b>and</b> <b>archiving</b> of this language for future generations to access...|$|E
40|$|The {{intent of}} this {{research}} was to engineer a collaborative data management system for an assembly facility supplying prototype products to a development and test centre. During the assembly of prototypes, multiple parts and subcomponents are exposed to engineering design changes, necessitating meticulous <b>documentation</b> <b>and</b> <b>archiving</b> of the bills of material. The findings from this research suggest, by using sound engineering methodologies and by extending the research to multiple fields of science, it is possible to design a data management system that has analytical proof for being robust and simple in its design. Robustness of the design is proven using a novel approach combining Axiomatic Design with the House of Quality. Improvements are mathematically evaluated by calculating the complexity of the designs using an innovative complexity formula originating from this research. A step-by-step approach is also developed, lending this research to be a framework for future design improvements...|$|E

This paper reflects on the genesis, development, implementation and emergent themes of an experimental transdisciplinary course, Migrating Memories: Diaspora, Archives and Human Rights, designed to address this educational gap in archival education. In addition to relevant scholarly work, the course integrated fiction, creative non-fiction and film in order to exercise issues of memory, <b>documentation</b> <b>and</b> <b>archiving</b> relating to forced diaspora.

40|$|In March 1999, Qualidata {{secured a}} grant from George BROWN, via the Medical Research Council to {{undertake}} the preparation, scanning, <b>documentation</b> <b>and</b> <b>archiving</b> of data and documentation from the lifetime research of Professor George BROWN.

It has already been in regular use for many years, both for ongoing research and for teaching purposes. In this paper we will describe: the logistics of conducting and managing the huge task of scanning the paper-based materials; tying this in with the quantitative data; and documenting the data in order to make them a useful resource for researchers.

40|$|The {{transferability}} of {{law from}} western cultures to aboriginal cultures is explored through {{a discussion of}} epistemological differences, focusing on the traditional ecological knowledge of First Nations of Canada. Western cultures adhere to a scientific tradition of <b>documentation</b> <b>and</b> <b>archiving</b> knowledge, and First Nations adhere to an oral tradition to maintain their knowledge and history. The attempted assimilation of the aboriginal cultures into those of the west has been hotly resisted. To understand the issues surrounding this assimilation, a comparative law methodology was utilized that reveals incongruities between the cultures??? legal systems by directly analyzing transcriptions of western laws and aboriginal legal systems. A focus on land use {{and the implications of}} the geographical context of law was adhered to. The Delgamuukw court case worldviews were revealed. These clashes exemplify the non-transferability of British was analyzed to illustrate the comparison and numerous examples of clashing colonialera laws into aboriginal societies and serve as nexus points for developing a more accommodating future for aboriginal cultures.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{approach}} for automatic 3 D reconstruction of outdoor scenes using computer vision techniques. Our system collects video, GPS and INS data which are processed in real-time to produce geo-registered, detailed 3 D models {{that represent the}} geometry and appearance of the world. These models are generated without manual measurements or markers in the scene {{and can be used}} for visualization from arbitrary viewpoints, <b>documentation</b> <b>and</b> <b>archiving</b> of large areas. Our system consists of a data acquisition system and a processing system that generated 3 D models from the video sequences off-line but in real-time.

The following stages of the processing pipeline perform dense reconstruction and generate the 3 D models, which are {{in the form of a}} triangular mesh and a set of images that provide texture.

40|$|The {{anthology}} Performing Archives/Archives of Performance {{consists of}} {{essays on the}} relationship between archives and performances. The anthology focuses on three key areas within the complex relationship between the archival and the performative, discussed within the theoretical framework of performance studies: Ontolgy; Performance; and Queering. The idea for the anthology began taking shape during the Performance Studies international (PSi) annual conference in Copenhagen 2008 entitled Interregnum: In Between States, where a number of academic and artistic performances addressed the issue of <b>documentation</b> <b>and</b> <b>archiving.</b> The topic of archives emerged not only in relation to performance art as such, but also within areas of ethnography, museum studies, and film production as well as broader issues regarding historical knowledge, local narratives, and identity politics. The anthology takes up the themes of the conference and expands on existing research on performance and archives. Notably, the publication addresses: aspects of cultural performance and acts of social remembering; the “archival impulse” to store and transmit; and seemingly oppositional relations between the stable and tangible materials of the archive and the ephemeral and embodied experience of performance...|$|E
40|$|The Ames Exobiology Culture Collection Database (AECC-DB) {{has been}} {{developed}} as a collaboration between microbial ecologists and information technology specialists. It allows for extensive web-based archiving of information regarding field samples to document microbial co-habitation of specific ecosystem micro-environments. <b>Documentation</b> <b>and</b> <b>archiving</b> continues as pure cultures are isolated, metabolic properties determined, and DNA extracted and sequenced. In this way metabolic properties and molecular sequences are clearly linked back to specific isolates {{and the location of}} those microbes in the ecosystem of origin. Use of this database system presents a significant advancement over traditional bookkeeping wherein there is generally little or no information regarding the environments from which microorganisms were isolated. Generally there is only a general ecosystem designation (i. e., hot-spring). However within each of these there are a myriad of microenvironments with very different properties and determining exactly where (which microenvironment) a given microbe comes from is critical in designing appropriate isolation media and interpreting physiological properties. We are currently using the database to aid in the isolation {{of a large number of}} cyanobacterial species and will present results by PI's and students demonstrating the utility of this new approach...|$|E
