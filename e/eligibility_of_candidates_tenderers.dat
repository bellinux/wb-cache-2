40|$|The recent {{government}} tendering process {{being conducted}} in an electronic way {{is becoming an}} inevitable affair for numerous governmental agencies to further exploit the superiorities of conventional tendering. Thus, developing an effective web-based bid evaluation methodology so as to realize an efficient and effective government E-tendering (GeT) system is imperative. This paper firstly investigates the potentiality of employing fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP) along with fuzzy gray relational analysis (GRA) for optimal selection <b>of</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>tenderers</b> in GeT process with consideration of a hybrid fuzzy environment with incomplete weight information. We proposed a novel hybrid fuzzy AHP-GRA (HFAHP-GRA) method that combines an extended fuzzy AHP with a modified fuzzy GRA. The extended fuzzy AHP which combines typical AHP with interval AHP is proposed to obtain the exact weight information, and the modified fuzzy GRA is applied to aggregate different types of evaluation information so as to identify the optimal <b>candidate</b> <b>tenderers.</b> Finally, a prototype system is built and validated with an illustrative example for GeT to confirm the feasibility of our approach...|$|R

40|$|The {{doctrine}} of « procedural fairness » is widening its {{scope of application}} {{to all kinds of}} administrative decisions. « Procedure » must, as a notion, therefore be clearly defined. The definitions given by the authors or by case-law make it difficult to distinguish between « procedure » and « merits ».

The Commission, as a specialised expert appeal Tribunal, has adopted a very liberal approach of the concept of procedure.

40|$|BACKGROUND Most {{tobacco control}} {{programmes}} for adolescents are based around prevention of uptake, but teenage smoking is still common. It is unclear if interventions that are effective for adults {{can also help}} adolescents to quit. This is the second update of a Cochrane review first published in 2006. OBJECTIVES To {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} strategies that help young people to stop smoking tobacco. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group's Specialized Register in February 2013. This includes reports for trials identified in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsyclNFO. SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomized controlled trials, cluster-randomized controlled trials and other controlled trials recruiting young people, aged less than 20, who were regular tobacco smokers. We included any interventions; these could include pharmacotherapy, psycho-social interventions and complex programmes targeting families, schools or communities. We excluded programmes primarily aimed at prevention of uptake. The primary outcome was smoking status after at least six months follow-up among those who smoked at baseline. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Both authors independently assessed the <b>eligibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>candidate</b> trials and extracted data. Included studies were evaluated for risk of bias using standard Cochrane methodology. Where meta-analysis was appropriate, we estimated pooled risk ratios using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect method, based on the quit rates at longest follow-up. MAIN RESULTS Twenty-eight trials involving approximately 6000 young people met our inclusion criteria (12 cluster-randomized controlled trials, 14 randomized controlled trials and 2 controlled trials). The majority of studies were judged to be at high or unclear risk of bias in at least one domain. Many studies combined components from various theoretical backgrounds to form complex interventions. The majority used some form of motivational enhancement combined with psychological support such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and some were tailored to stage of change using the transtheoretical model (TTM). Three trials based mainly on TTM interventions achieved moderate long-term success, with a pooled risk ratio (RR) of 1. 56 at one year (95...|$|R

The secondary data used for this research comprised of the records of all 100 Level students admitted into the University from 2012 / 2013 to 2015 / 2016 academic sessions through UTME and Post-UTME.

The results [(2012 / 13 : 49. 3 %; 50. 7 %); (2013 / 14 : 53. 5 %; 46. 5 %); (2014 / 15 : 53 %; 47 %) and (2015 / 16 : 53. 3 %; 46. 7 %) ], {{for male and female}} respectively showed that more male candidates were admitted compared to their female counterpart in each academic session except the 2012 / 2013 session that had higher female enrolment. More than 80 % of the students were in the 16 - 20 age group. The independent t-test, for UTME and Post-UTME respectively, showed that the males had higher mean scores than the females and these mean scores were significant in all the sessions except in the 2015 / 16 session [(2012 / 13 : P =. 00;. 04); (2013 / 14 : P =. 00;. 03); (2014 / 15 : P =. 00;. 00); (2015 / 16 : P =. 32;. 29) ]. The independent t-test for Post-UTME showed that the 16 - 20 age group had higher mean scores in the Post-UTME than the 21 & above age group in all the sessions but the only significant Post-UTME mean score for this group was in the 2012 / 13 session (P =. 00). Also, the independent t-test for UTME showed that the 21 & above age group had higher mean scores in the UTME than the 16 - 20 age group in all the sessions except the 2015 / 16 session but the only significant UTME mean score for this group was in the 2013 / 14 session (P =. 03).

In this retrospective, single-center study of 445 adult patients referred between 2001 and 2006, 36 (8 %) were deemed ineligible for medical contraindications. The leading reason was cardiovascular (CV) (75 %), specifically aorto-iliac, and/or limb vessels atheromatosis or calcifications; ischemic heart disease; or a combination thereof. Nine patients had other contraindications that were absolute for three of them; six patients displayed a combination of relative contraindications. When compared to eligible patients (N = 409), those ineligible were significantly older (60 yr vs. 48), more often diabetics (50 % vs. 15 %), obese (39 % vs. 17 %) suffering from coronary artery disease (53 % vs. 11 %) and peripheral arterial disease (86 % vs. 11 %). Their primary nephropathy was more often diabetic and/or hypertensive/nephroangiosclerosis (61 % vs. 23 %), and their median dialysis vintage prior to evaluation was longer (29 months vs. 10, p < 0. 0001).

In 2005 Vascular Surgery was recognized as a separate and independent Section, a monospecialty, within the UEMS. The efforts of the UEMS are directed at facilitating the free exchange of training and work of trainees and medical specialists between EU countries. This situation, in combination with large differences in requirements and length of training in vascular surgery within the EU, stresses the importance of harmonization in training and certification in vascular surgery within the EU. For that reason, the European Board of Vascular Surgery has organized voluntary examinations yearly since 1996. The candidates who pass qualify as “Fellow of the European Board of Vascular Surgery” (FEBVS) since 2005. The first part of the examination evaluates the <b>eligibility</b> <b>of</b> the <b>candidate</b> (Certificate <b>of</b> Completion of Specialist Training, training center, logbook).
