50|$|R1a1a1-M17 and Haplogroup R1b are {{the second}} (34%) {{and the third}} (15.6%) most {{prevailing}} haplogroups according to the investigation done in 2003. According to the 2008 research these values are slightly smaller. The haplogroup R-M17 in Croatia is mostly divided into two subclades, R-M558 (predominant) and R-M458, while R-Z282 is rare. The highest frequency of R1a1a1-M17 {{was found in the}} Croats from Osijek (39%), Žumberak (34.1), and in the northern islands of Krk (37%) and Cres (56.5%), being similar to the values of the other Slavs, like Slovenes, Czechs and Slovaks. The frequency is lower in Zadar (4%) and Dubrovnik (13.4%), as well on the southern islands of Hvar (8%), Vis (17%), Korčula (20%), and Brač (25%). In Bosnian Croats, the frequency is similar to those of other South Slavs (12%). The highest frequency of the haplogroup R1b, which in Croatia is divided into several subclades, was in the Croats from the island of Krk (16.2%) and Dugi Otok (25%), in Žumberak was 11.3%, while in the southern islands, city of Dubrovnik (3.9%) and in Bosnian Croats it is almost absent (1-6%), or like in Osijek it was not found. These two haplogroups (R1a and R1b) are connected to Proto-Indo-Europeans migration from the Eurasian area some 5,000 years ago, R1a particularly to Slavic population's migration.

2500|$|The {{judge is}} charged {{not only with}} {{selecting}} a winner, but also must allot points to each competitor. Known as [...] "speaker points" [...] or simply [...] "speaks", its goal {{is to provide a}} numerical evaluation of the debaters' speaking skills. Speaker point schemes vary throughout local state and regional organizations particularly at the high school level. However, the method accepted by most national organizations such as the National Forensic League, Tournament of Champions, National Catholic Forensic League, Cross-Examination Debate Association, and National Debate Tournament, use values ranging from 1 to 30. In practice, within these organizations the standard variation is 26‑29, where 26's are given to extremely poor speakers, where a perfect score is considered incredibly rare and warranted only by an outstanding performance. Most tournaments accept halfpoint <b>gradiations,</b> for example 28.5s. Generally, speaker points are seen as secondary in importance to wins and losses, yet often correlate with a team's win/loss rate. In other words, the judge usually awards the winning team cumulatively higher speaker points than the losing team. If the judge does not, the decision is considered a [...] "low-point win". Low-point wins simply mean that the team with better argumentation spoke worse, but are often rare, because judges will vote for teams that speak better, and award better speaker points to victorious teams.|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{agents are}} capable of {{interacting}} with DNA and damaging it. Permanent changes in the DNA structure can be both mutagenic and cytotoxic; therefore, methods to measure the susceptibility of cells to mutations are important for risk assessment and identifying therapeutic interventions. One classical method for assessing DNA damage {{at a global level}} is the COMET assay, based on electrophoretic extension of the nuclear DNA in single cells embedded in agarose. In this assay, {{the size and shape of}} the extended 'comet tail' can be correlated to breaks in the DNA. This assay was first developed in the mid 1980 s for non adherent cells such as lymphocytes; however, it has been plagued by technical difficulties, low throughput, and lab-to lab variation. These challenges have been exacerbated in adhesion-dependent cells as DNA damage accrues variably over time as they are enzymatically detached from their microenvironment. This thesis explores whether the COMET assay can be improved by micropatterning adherent cells prior to agarose embedding. Hepatocytes were chosen as a model cell type and x-ray radiation was chosen as a model DNA damaging agent. In order to establish the feasibility of measuring x-ray induced damage on hepatocyte DNA, standard curves were first generated for hepatocytes suspended in agarose. These experiments revealed a minimum detectable threshold of 1 Gy and displayed a monotonic increase in DNA damage in response to exposures up to 10 Gy. In comparison, adherent hepatocytes overlaid with agarose and irradiated in situ displayed similar levels of mean damage but lower levels of variability than suspended cells. We hypothesize that the decreased variability could be due to a reduction in programmed cell death incurred by detachment of adherent cells. (cont.) Finally, we explored the feasibility of performing the comet assay by in situ irradiation of a micropatterned array of adherent cells. Single cell hepatocyte patterning was achieved by photolithographic patterning of collagen I on glass and optimization of seeding conditions. <b>Gradiations</b> of x-ray exposure were achieved by employing localized domains of lead shielding between the cells and the source. As a proof of principle, we obtained two domains of differential x-ray exposure and the resulting DNA damage was similar in the micropatterned format to the randomly-organized adherent format. Several challenges emerged from these experiments including potential interactions of DNA with the glass surface leading to 'streaking' artifacts. Nonetheless, with increased resolution of x-ray exposure, and further technical improvements, this assay has the potential to offer both reduced variability for adherent cells as well as assay multiplexing due to spatial encoding of x-ray dosage. by Sukant Mittal.

40|$|The {{addition}} and re-design of a 19 th century {{covered market}} {{in the heart of}} Calcutta, India, is the design project to explore the larger topic of place-making within a specific culture. In Calcutta the divisions of society within the city are becoming increasingly polarized along the lines of religion and wealth, creating a real need for a public place accessible to income and class groups from all over the city. The 'ground level' public spaces of colonialism-parks and gardens-have been taken over by the city's poor. The only zone of interaction for the city's varied population is the street; a few 'street-like' built spaces-covered street-edge arcades and the· 'interior streets' of the city's covered markets still function as public places, creating a civic collective realm. An analysis of these public places shows that rather than a static conception of public place as open 'plaza' or 'square' (which would most likely be built upon and privatized), the routes of access- the 'interior' streets-within these places are used as public places. At a small scale, a variety of environments are created by local intensifications of the access zones. At a larger scale, differentiation in the access (or 'interior street') network creates differential degrees of access that serve the needs of various groups still remaining public at the collective size. The thesis proposes that the static polarities of 'public' and 'private' space be replaced by looking at the continuum of differential access that creates particularity within the built environment, yet structures the experience as a whole. In Calcutta, the complex divisions within society are congruent with the need for the fine <b>gradiations</b> of accessibility that are seen in the built environments of its public places. It is the need for different degrees of accessibility that differentiates the design of public place in Calcutta from that in Western society. The architecture of Hermann Hertzberger and Aldo Van Eyck has done much to reformulate the idea of public place as 'interior streetscape'. To underscore the difference with the Indian context, the thesis examines the assumptions of individual and collective that are implicit in their designs. The thesis also analyzes the intricate degrees of accessibility created by the access systems of traditional Indian built environments at the collective size. Drawing from these sources, the design project focuses on the design of addition to the old covered market as public place, focussing on the design of the access system as the organizational structure of the built environment. Through the design of the built environment's access system the aim is to accommodate the often conflicting needs of groups within it as well as allow for it's collective use. by Aminuddin Ahmad.

Characteristics of the processed material were determined. The Vickers microhardness was verified. A microstructural characterization by crystal orientation mapping (EBSD analysis) was carried out. The comparison of the deformed material with the initial state shows an increasing proportion of small grains related to the degree of deformation. A corresponding change of the texture can be observed. The grain refinement of the original coarse crystalline material to grain sizes below 1 µm is demonstrated. A large increase of the hardness in the near suface area is further indication of the grain refining effect...|$|E

40|$|A {{simple and}} fast method to {{generate}} graded quadrilateral mesh has been developed. This method guarantees {{the generation of}} quadrilateral mesh once the triangular base mesh has been generated. The gradation of triangular mesh is self controlled for the internal nodes in the generation process, the boundary nodes <b>gradiation</b> is controlled by assigning nodal spacing. To achieve large gradation around an internal point, the post-local refinement is implemented by splitting the longest edge of the triangles inside the refining area. In order {{to ensure the quality}} of the triangular mesh, the triangles are generated as equal-sided as possible, then applied with swapping and the weighted central smoothing. To generate a quadrilateral mesh, the triangular base mesh is transformed into a quadrilateral mesh by combining two suitable triangles into four quadrilaterals, and then the triangles that are left over are split into three quadrilaterals. In comparison with the existing mesh generation methods, this method involves no background mesh interpolation, no recursive region sub-divisions and no sorting during the generation process. Therefore, the mesh generating time, as well as the combining, swapping and smoothing time, are greatly reduced. This method, therefore, is suitable for a repeated mesh generation process such as occurs in the metal forming FEM analysis.

This {{study is}} {{presented}} as a graduate thesis, The slag is assessed by its usage as an aggregate bituminous treated base, taking into account of basic criterias specified in Republic of Turkey General Directorate of Highways Technical Specification 2013. Enverimental problem showed up with industrial revolution. Although people are increasing their startdart of life economically by developtment of industry and technology, eart start to get a sick by polluted. As long as we arent stop this chaos, our resersours will be finish. So we will engaged to local wars, uncoordinated industrialization, famisment and disturp natural balance. As long as we can recycling to plastics, paper, some fossil oil products, rocks etc. As far as we know collection, transportation, transaction and disposal of waste materials are part of waste management.   In 2014, 1636 million ton steel are produce in the world, besides 34 million tonnes steel are produce in Turkey. Nearly 130 – 150 kg slag have been released druring producing 1 ton steel. As long as calculate slag producing, approximately 5, 1 million tonnes slag have been released every year in Turkey.   In our country, the place of construction sector in economy is incrasing gradually. Following that the demand of materials used in the construction sector is also incrasing. Also pavement construction is more consume natural resources than other branches of civil engineering. Huge quantities of natural materiales, rocks, fossil oil and sand are constructed into kilometers of constructed roads or in reconstruction of fault roads. Given the limited resources of our country,as in many areas the recycling of waste materials to useful resources is beneficial to both environment and minimization of the production costs.   As far as we know, we are using huge of amount of aggregate in the construction sector. Every year we are using million tonnes aggregate for built something. If we can give some example, need of aggregate for hospital building is 2, 800 tones, for a hotel building is 1, 100 tones and for 1 km highway construction is 30, 000 tones. This example show us how much aggregate we are using in order construction. Acording to not reduce aggregate amount, we can change aggregate materials. Every year we are {{spent a lot of money}} for road building. As far as we know aggregate is huge amount in budget of road building. If we can replace natural aggregate to blast furnace slag, electic ark furnace slag or basic oxygen furnace slag, we can save our natural resource and our money. Blast furnace slag, electic ark furnace slag and basic oxygen furnace slag are stocked as wasted materials. However, they havent a classification. If goverment and some big firm are deal for useage such kind of slag, it will be helpful our natural resources and enverimental polluted.

In that part statistical information about steel production is given and basic parts of the steel manufacturing processes are described. In addition to this subjects, in this part give main information about electic ark furnace and basic oxygen furnace.   In the fifth part, slag formation and current usage of slag is explained. In this section, given three types of slag which are called as blast furnace slag, electic ark furnace slag and basic oxygen furnace slag. And given some staticals data about use of blast furnace slag, electic ark furnace slag and basic oxygen furnace slag.
