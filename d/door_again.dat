5|$|Fanny {{opened the}} <b>door</b> <b>again</b> and Powell shoved past her to Seward's bed. He stabbed at Seward's face and neck, slicing open his cheek, but the splint doctors had fitted to Seward's broken jaw (often mistakenly {{described}} as a neck brace) prevented the blade from penetrating his jugular vein. He eventually recovered, though with serious scars on his face.|$|E
5|$|Another {{theory is}} that Madeleine, nearly four at the time, left the {{apartment}} by herself, perhaps to look for her parents, and was abducted by a passer-by or fell {{into one of the}} open construction sites nearby. This is widely regarded as unlikely. According to her mother, Madeleine would have had to open the unlocked patio doors, close the curtains behind her, close the <b>door</b> <b>again,</b> open and close the child gate {{at the top of the}} stairs, then open and close the gate leading to the street.|$|E
5|$|Doggett and Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) {{return to}} Squamash, {{and the two}} ask the sheriff about the murder of an {{unidentified}} transient. Doggett believes that the transient was murdered by Mulder. Doggett and Skinner travel to the cemetery and discover that the grave dug up by the backhoe earlier {{is that of the}} transient. The two find the casket empty, but Doggett notices that the transient tunneled out of his own coffin. The sheriff arrives with the creature—revealed to be a soul eater, a creature that subsists off human disease—at the Hangemuhl home, where the symbol in blood is on the <b>door</b> <b>again.</b> The hideous creature opens its jaws wide and bites Hangemuhl. Doggett suggests to Skinner that Mulder shot someone to protect Hangemuhl from the man {{who was supposed to be}} in that grave. Meanwhile, deep underground, the creature vomits what appears to be the visceral remains of Marie into a person-shaped mold in the soil.|$|E

5|$|The second chorus has {{the girls}} {{dancing on the}} table, {{knocking}} several pieces of food and tuppleware onto the ground. A-Chan is seen lying down on a pillow, whilst Kashiyuka balances a book and an apple on her head. Both of these scenes have them throwing several pieces of food onto the table. Nocchi is seen at the dining table, holding a fork and listen to music through her headphones. She witnesses a small door underneath a stool, opens it, and sees a small green room. In the room, a blurred image of a cup starts to become clear, and holds small candy. As the girls eat the pieces of candy, their cream-coloured dresses turn into the outfits from the cover sleeve from the single. The girls start dancing in the fish bowl, surrounded by glittery lights. The final scene has the girls looking through the small <b>door</b> <b>again,</b> only to witness {{the dining room table}} empty; the small cup with candy appears in beige colouring rather than full-on vibrancy.|$|E
25|$|The Wildcats {{started the}} season off strong with a 4–1 record, but things went south quickly after that. The Wildcats slumped to last spot in December with a 7–9 record as the club's injury toll started to bite—long-term {{injuries}} to Martin, Jarrod Kenny and Matt Knight hurt the Wildcats. Their recruiting was also put under the spotlight when they axed import Jaron Johnson in December {{for a second}} time—Johnson was first axed just three games into the season {{in order to bring}} in three-point specialist Andre Ingram. But when Ingram returned home after just a few days, citing mental issues, Johnson was reinstated. Johnson was then shown the <b>door</b> <b>again</b> in December as the Wildcats turned their attention to a new point guard.|$|E
25|$|The wounded Emery {{suggests}} that Annie {{be killed in}} order to allow everyone to escape, alarming the rest of the group. While in the kitchen, Cathy Kramer is attacked by Mrs. Waterman and is rescued by Nick. The two decide to tie up the deranged woman and leave her in the kitchen. They agree not to inform Emery so that the unstable young man does not become more unbalanced. A ghostly Sukeena appears and drags Mrs. Waterman off into the dark wine cellar. As Nick and Cathy head back toward the main hall, the house changes around them and they become lost. A mysterious shape under the carpet chases them, and they flee. The shape begins to catch up to them, and Nick shoves Cathy into a room and slams the door behind her, turning around {{just in time to see}} a skeletal monster rushing up to him. With silence in the hallway, Cathy opens the <b>door</b> <b>again</b> but finds no sign of Nick or the entity in the empty hallway. As the house continues to change around her, Cathy ends up in the attic. Suddenly overcome by the urge to automatically write, she witnesses the murder of John Rimbauer by Ellen and Sukeena. Steve and Rachel, meanwhile, decide to look for Nick and Cathy. They find Cathy in the attic, where she is about to be attacked by a corpse-like creature. Their presence seemingly prevents the house from acting, and the corpse drops lifeless to the floor. The corpse's withered arm lets them deduce that the carcass is that of Steven's missing great-aunt (and Ellen's daughter), April Rimbauer. Suddenly, April's corpse releases a bright white light from its mouth and instantly disintegrates.|$|E

But when Ingram returned home after just a few days, citing mental issues, Johnson was reinstated. Johnson was then shown the <b>door</b> <b>again</b> in December as the Wildcats turned their attention to a new point guard. The Wildcats were under siege when they slumped {{to the bottom of the}} ladder at Christmas. They then travelled to Wollongong for a must-win game against Illawarra on New Year's Eve without injured captain Damian Martin or a third import (after sacking Johnson). Amid the turmoil and against the odds, the Wildcats beat the Hawks, signed Bryce Cotton and their season changed. Behind the import duo of Casey Prather and Bryce Cotton, the Wildcats won eight of their remaining twelve regular season games, including two must-win encounters in the final week to squeeze into the finals. From there, the Wildcats rolled through the Finals undefeated to claim the title, an incredible achievement in what was arguably the closest season in NBL history. Not only did Perth extend their finals streak into a record 31st straight season, but their 3–0 Grand Final sweep of the Illawarra Hawks saw them claim their eighth NBL Championship. The Wildcats went back-to-back for the first time since 1990/1991, while Gleeson became the first coach to guide the Wildcats to back-to-back championships. In addition, series MVP Byrce Cotton placed his name in the NBL record books with a Grand Final performance that was arguably the greatest in the league's history. Cotton's Game 3 performance was unprecedented—he scored 45 points, the most ever scored in an NBL Grand Final game, breaking a 29-year-old record. His 27.7 points per game over the Grand Final series marked the most from any player in 20 years.|$|E

The aspiration of friendship between the Chinese and the US people and the determination and courage of politicians {{of the two countries}} converged into an irresistible historical trend and opened the door of China-US relations which had been closed for more than 20 years. Since then, there has been no force in the world capable of closing that <b>door</b> <b>again.</b> China-US relations stand at an equally critical historic moment at present. President Hu and President Obama, when meeting in Washington in January this year, agreed to establish and develop the cooperative partnership based on mutual respect and mutual benefit, pointing out the direction for the future development of bilateral ties. History is proving and will continue to prove that this critical decision with historical significance complies with the trend of history and will benefit the Chinese and the US people and the entire mankind.|$|E
