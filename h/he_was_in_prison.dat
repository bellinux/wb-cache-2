Although written while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>prison,</b> without access to his papers, the memoirs formed a valuable resource, informing military historians {{on topics such as}} the background to the invasion of the Soviet Union. When the English edition was published, Kesselring's contentions that the Luftwaffe was not defeated in the air in the Battle of Britain and that Operation Sea Lion—the invasion of Britain—was thought about but never seriously planned were controversial.

25|$|March 23, 2007: Attorneys {{defending}} Addison {{planned to}} contest the use of capital punishment. They intended to explore controversial issues about the law and were expected {{to refer to a}} 1997 trial in which a man convicted of murdering a police officer was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole. In addition, the defense attorneys wanted a change of venue, to gain stricter security; and they wanted to prevent newspaper and television media from taking photographs of Addison while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>prison</b> and entering or leaving the courthouse. The defense said that such photographs could bias viewers against him and complicate his right to a fair trial. Prosecutors wanted the trial to remain in Manchester and argued that moving Addison to a different courthouse would interfere with the trial. On April 13, 2007, the judge rejected the defense attorneys' request, saying that the trial would not affect jury selection and potential jurors had likely already seen published photos of Addison.|$|E

25|$|After an interval, Servetus {{returned}} to Paris to study medicine in 1536. In Paris, his teachers included Sylvius, Fernel and Johann Winter von Andernach, who hailed him with Andrea Vesalius as his most able assistant in dissections. During these years {{he wrote his}} Manuscript of the Complutense, an unpublished compendium of his medical ideas. Servetus taught mathematics and astrology while he studied medicine. He predicted an occultation of Mars by the Moon, and this joined to his teaching generated much envy among the medicine teachers. His teaching classes were suspended by the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine, Jean Tagault, and Servetus wrote his Apologetic Discourse of Michel de Villeneuve in Favour of Astrology and against a Certain Physician against him. Tagault later argued {{for the death penalty}} in the judgment of the University of Paris against Servetus. He was accused of teaching De Divinatione by Cicero. Finally, the sentence was reduced to the withdrawal of this edition. As a result of the risks and difficulties of studying medicine at Paris, Servetus decided to go to Montpellier to finish his medical studies, maybe thanks to his teacher Sylvius who did exactly the same as a student. There he became a Doctor of Medicine in 1539. After that he lived at Charlieu. A jealous physician ambushed and tried to kill Servetus, but Servetus defended himself and injured one of the attackers in a sword fight. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>prison</b> for several days because of this incident.|$|E
