5|$|Among notable <b>items</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{collection}} is a 47-star US Flag; New Mexico was the 47th state {{admitted to the}} Union, and US flags were made with 47stars only for one month, until Arizona was admitted.|$|E
5|$|Pitchstone {{deposits}} on {{the island}} were used locally for making various <b>items</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Mesolithic era. In the Neolithic and the Early Bronze Age pitchstone from the Isle of Arran or items made from it were transported around Britain.|$|E
5000|$|Once a dataset {{is bound}} to a document, use of D3.js {{typically}} follows a pattern wherein an explicit [...] function, an implicit [...] "update," [...] and an explicit [...] function is invoked for each <b>item</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bound dataset. Any methods chained after the [...] command will be called for each <b>item</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dataset not already represented by a DOM node <b>in</b> <b>the</b> selection (the previous [...] ). Likewise, the implicit update function is called on all existing selected nodes {{for which there is}} a corresponding <b>item</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dataset, and [...] is called on all existing selected nodes that do not have an <b>item</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dataset to bind to them. The D3.js documentation provides several examples of how this works.|$|R

5|$|The six Collins-class {{submarines}} are {{the most}} expensive <b>items</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Australian Defence Force inventory. The annual cost of operating and maintaining the class was estimated at A$100 million in 2000, and at A$322 million in 2008.|$|E

5|$|All the {{jewellery}} in the hoard is gold, and all gold <b>items</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hoard, {{other than}} coins, are jewellery. None of the jewellery is unequivocally masculine, although several pieces, like the rings, {{might have been}} worn by either gender. There is one body chain, six necklaces, three rings, and nineteen bracelets. The total weight of the gold jewellery is about , and the average metal content of the jewellery pieces is 91.5% gold (about 22 carat), with small proportions in the metal of silver and copper.|$|E

The first team to get any <b>item</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sequence wrong or {{run out of time}} (or also forgetting to add an <b>item</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Carrington era) lost the event. Examples of Simon games included the following: ...|$|R
5|$|Day of the Tentacle {{uses the}} SCUMM engine {{developed}} for Maniac Mansion. LucasArts had gradually modified the engine since its creation. For example, {{the number of}} input verbs was reduced and <b>items</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> character's inventory are represented by icons rather than text. While implementing an animation, the designers encountered a problem later discovered to be limitation of the engine. Upon learning of the limitation, Gilbert reminisced about the file size of the first game. The staff then resolved to include it in the sequel.|$|E
5|$|In March 2016, update 1.4 was {{released}} which added a crafting system, rooms, a card in lunchboxes containing junk used in crafting, pets and a barbershop. Update 1.5 {{was released}} in April 2016, adding customization options for Vault dwellers along {{with the ability to}} scrap unwanted items and support for 3D Touch. Update 1.6 was released on July 14, 2016 adding a quest system, two new enemies (Feral Ghouls and Radscorpions) and two <b>items</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shop. Additionally, the combat system was tweaked in the update.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not certain}} what {{significance}} the classic Maya gave to the 13th b'ak'tun. Most classic Maya inscriptions are strictly historical and do not make any prophetic declarations. Two <b>items</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Maya classical corpus, however, do mention {{the end of the}} 13th b'ak'tun: Tortuguero Monument 6 and La Corona Hieroglyphic Stairway 12.|$|E

5|$|Murder on the Orient Express, as {{with its}} predecessor, {{features}} an inventory system. There are several {{components of the}} inventory, including a fingerprint examination screen, a scrapbook, and a passport screen for managing and viewing the passengers' passports. There are a total of eighty slots for carrying <b>items</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> inventory, spread across five separate screens. Items cannot be discarded from the inventory once they have been acquired. The player can access the inventory by clicking on an icon on the game's interface, or can simply right-click. After items are used, a right-click returns them to the inventory, and the exact slot they were originally placed in. Each item is labelled, and the player can inspect each inventory item in more detail by dragging it over a magnifying glass icon, and can also listen for a soft hissing sound which indicates {{that there is something}} relevant for the player to note about a certain item. In a divergence from other games in its genre, Murder on the Orient Express does not allow the player to combine <b>items</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> main inventory screen. There is a separate interface for item combinations, and the player must drag items into this screen if they wish to try to combine them.|$|E
5|$|S. C. Hawkes {{argues that}} the eight <b>items</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hoard were found in {{different}} graves, basing this on x-ray and fluorescent analysis of the coins. However, the historian Philip Grierson thought {{that the possibility of}} two graves from different time periods both containing coins of the same period was so small as to make the likelihood of the hoard coming from two graves slim.|$|E
5|$|Stealth is a {{significant}} element of the gameplay; frequent gunfire can alert distant guards, and activated alarms can trigger infinitely-respawning enemies. Therefore, to avoid gunfights with numerous opponents, it is advantageous to eliminate soldiers and security cameras before they spot or hear the player. Certain weapons incorporate suppressor or telescopic sight attachments to aid the player in killing enemies discreetly. There are no health-recovery <b>items</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game, although armour vests can be acquired to provide a secondary health bar.|$|E

5|$|The {{album is}} named after the Office of Strategic Influence, an {{organization}} set up after the September 11 attacks to spread misinformation and plant false news <b>items</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> media, among other functions. The Office was shut after The New York Times published a story on it; many of its operations were transferred to the Information Operations Task Force. The album's lyrics were written by Moore {{in reaction to the}} September 11 attacks.|$|E
5|$|Various {{segments}} of maps are {{scattered around the}} galleon, which will form a complete view of the game's overworld once all the segments are picked up. Other scattered <b>items</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game include keys for locked doors, gunpowder to fire cannons and pieces of jewellery, the latter having no additional use other than adding to the player's score.|$|E
5|$|A {{large portion}} of {{gameplay}} in Murder on the Orient Express has the player questioning characters and listening to lengthy periods of dialogue in order to acquire clues which {{may lead to the}} murderer. Other tasks the player must complete include collecting passports and other paraphernalia left by the passengers in an effort to acquire clues to lead to the solution of the murder, and retrieving certain objects for various characters. Combining <b>items</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> inventory forms {{a major part of the}} puzzles in the game. There are no puzzles with time limits in the game, although some puzzles require correct timing. There are also several single screen puzzles, such as a safe-cracking puzzle.|$|E

5|$|As of 2012 {{the ground}} and top floors of the main house, {{together}} with the adjacent wings, are used as accommodation for the elderly. The reception rooms of the first floor {{are open to the}} public at advertised times, and are entered by the original stairway on the south front; they contain paintings and furniture collected by the Leicester family. Some <b>items</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> collection had formerly been displayed on this floor, whilst others were moved from elsewhere in the house. The first floor may also be hired for weddings, meetings, and conferences. It is managed by a trust, which is supported by a group of Friends and by volunteers.|$|E
5|$|Beneath a Steel Sky is a 2D {{adventure}} {{game played}} from a third-person perspective. The player uses a point-and-click interface {{to interact with}} the environment and to guide protagonist Robert Foster through the game's world. To solve puzzles and progress in the game, the player collects items that may be combined with one another, used on the environment, or given to non-player characters (NPCs). The protagonist converses with NPCs via dialogue trees to learn about the game's puzzles and plot. Clues and other information are obtained by clicking on <b>items</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> inventory and on objects in the environment. Unlike in most adventure games at the time, the protagonist's death is possible, after which the player starts from the last save point. In the remastered iOS version, the point-and-click interface is replaced with a touch user interface, a hint system is added, and hotspots are highlighted.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} development, {{multiple}} {{members of}} staff voiced dissatisfaction with the final product. Ito and Suzuki felt that the portrayals of the Law and Chaos Heroes were imbalanced, with the Chaos Hero being too emotional and the Law Hero being unsympathetic. They also saw the demon fusion system as too difficult for players to master. Okada, while commenting on what improvements would {{be made for the}} next game, stated that there were too many useless <b>items</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game. Niino felt that the game's pacing and flow needed to be addressed, as after naming the characters, the player immediately is prompted to divide their status points.|$|E
