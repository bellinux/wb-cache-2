40|$|Lean Direct Injection (LDI) is a {{combustor}} {{concept that}} reduces nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions. This paper {{looks at a}} 3 -zone multipoint LDI concept developed by Parker Hannifin Corporation. The concept was tested in a flame-tube test facility at NASA Glenn Research Center. Due to test facility limitations, such as <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> temperature and pressure, the flame-tube test {{was not able to}} cover the full set of engine operation conditions. Three NOx correlation equations were developed based on assessing NOx emissions dependencies on <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> pressure (P 3), <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> temperature (T 3), and fuel air equivalence ratio () to estimate the NOx emissions at the unreachable high engine power conditions. As the results, the NOx emissions are found to be a strong function of combustion <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> temperature and fuel air equivalence ratio but a weaker function of <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> pressure. With these three equations, the NOx emissions performance of this injector concept is calculated as a 66 % reduction relative to the ICAO CAEP- 6 standard using a 55 : 1 pressure-ratio engine cycle. Uncertainty in the NOx emissions estimation increases as the extrapolation range departs from the experimental conditions. Since maximum <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> pressure tested was less than 50 % of the full power engine <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> pressure, a future experiment at higher <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> pressure conditions is needed to confirm the NOx emissions dependency on <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> pressure...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis work {{investigates the}} effect of both <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> {{temperature}} and fuel injection pressure on performance and emission behaviour of homogeneous charge compression ignition engine (HCCI) fuelled with diesel fuel. In this investigation, HCCI engine operates with different <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> temperature and fuel injection pressure, and analysis {{the effect of}} these variables on HCCI engine performance and emissions. The <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> temperatures are varied between 40 °C and 70 °C and the injection pressure in the port fuel injector is varied from 3 bar to 5 bar respectively. From the results, the optimum <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> temperature and fuel injection pressure for efficient HCCI engine operation are identified. The result shows that, brake thermal efficiency of HCCI is nearer to the value of conventional diesel engine, and can be obtained if HCCI engine operates with 5 bar injection pressure and 60 °C air temperature and a simultaneous reduction in oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and smoke emissions compared to conventional diesel engine. However, when <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> is heated for improvement of vaporisation of diesel fuel, the higher <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> temperature limits the operation range of HCCI engine, due to high knocking intensity, high NOx emissions and misfire of charge.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effects of two air-abrasive prophylaxis systems and the effect of <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> pressure on the surface of BrÅnemark titanium abutment cylinders. Materials and Methods : Single abutment cylinders were treated with either the Prophy-Jet system (sodium bicarbonate abrasive) (Dentsply International, York, PA) or the Microprophy system (aluminum oxide abrasive) (Danville Engineering Co, Danville, CA) for 60 seconds at an <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> pressure of 60 psi or 90 psi. The effects on the surface of each abutment cylinder were visually inspected by scanning electron microscopy. Results : A comparison of abutment cylinder surfaces after treatment showed that the Prophy Jet system removed machining marks to a greater degree than the Microprophy system. Sodium bicarbonate particles from the Prophy-Jet system were significantly larger than the aluminum oxide particles used with the Microprophy system, potentially accounting for the difference in abrasivity. In addition, <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> pressure of 60 psi caused removal of machining marks to a greater degree than an <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> pressure of 90 psi. The principle of phase separation may account for the lower <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> pressure causing more removal of machining marks than the higher <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> pressure.
