25|$|The Italian {{catalyst}} manufacturer Acta {{has proposed}} using hydrazine {{as an alternative}} to hydrogen in fuel cells. As the hydrazine fuel is liquid at room temperature, it can be handled and stored more easily than hydrogen. By storing it in a tank <b>full</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> double-bonded carbon-oxygen carbonyl, it reacts and forms a safe solid called hydrazone. By then flushing the tank with warm water, the liquid hydrazine hydrate is released. Hydrazine breaks down in the cell to form nitrogen and hydrogen which bonds with oxygen, releasing water.|$|E
25|$|His catechetical lectures (Greek Κατηχήσεις) are {{generally}} assumed, {{on the basis}} of limited evidence, to have been delivered either in Cyril's early years as a bishop, around 350, or perhaps in 348, while Cyril was still a priest, deputising for his bishop, Maximus. The Catechetical Lectures were given in the Martyrion, the basilica erected by Constantine. They contain instructions on the principal topics of Christian faith and practice, in rather a popular than a scientific manner, <b>full</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> warm pastoral love and care for the catechumens to whom they were delivered. Each lecture is based upon a text of Scripture, and there is an abundance of Scriptural quotation throughout. In the Catechetical Lectures, parallel with the exposition of the Creed as it was then received in the Church of Jerusalem are vigorous polemics against pagan, Jewish, and heretical errors. They are of great importance for the light which they throw upon the method of instruction usual of that age, as well as upon the liturgical practises of the period, of which they give the fullest account extant.|$|E

500|$|Peter Hall, having succeeded Olivier as {{director}} of the National Theatre, was determined to attract Ashcroft, Gielgud and Richardson into the company. In 1975 he successfully offered Richardson the title role in Ibsen's John Gabriel Borkman, with Ashcroft and Wendy Hiller in the two main female roles. The production was one of the early successes of Hall's initially difficult tenure. The critic Michael Billington wrote that Hall had done the impossible in reconciling the contradictory aspects of the play and that [...] "Richardson's Borkman is both moral monster and self-made superman; and the performance is <b>full</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> strange, unearthly music that belongs to this actor alone." ...|$|E

2500|$|As poet-laureate, his topical verses did {{not escape}} {{negative}} criticism; a hasty poem written {{in praise of}} the Jameson Raid in 1896 being a notable instance. The most effective characteristic of Austin's poetry, as {{of the best of}} his prose, was a genuine and intimate love of nature. His prose idylls, The Garden that I love and In Veronica's Garden, are <b>full</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pleasant, open-air flavour. His lyrical poems are wanting in spontaneity and individuality, but many of them possess a simple, orderly charm, as of an English country lane. He had, indeed, a true love of England, sometimes not without a suspicion of insularity, but always fresh and ingenuous. A drama by him, Flodden Field, was performed at His Majesty's theatre in 1903, with incidental music by Percy Pitt. A number of his poems were set to music by Frances Allitsen, and Alexander Mackenzie's contribution to [...] (1899) was a setting of Austin's occasional poem With wisdom, goodness, grace.|$|E
2500|$|The Italian {{catalyst}} manufacturer Acta {{has proposed}} using hydrazine {{as an alternative}} to hydrogen in fuel cells. The chief benefit of using hydrazine is that it can produce over 200 mW/cm2 more than a similar hydrogen cell without the need to use expensive platinum catalysts.

By storing the hydrazine in a tank <b>full</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> double-bonded carbon-oxygen carbonyl, the fuel reacts and forms a safe solid called hydrazone. By then flushing the tank with warm water, the liquid hydrazine hydrate is released. Hydrazine [...] has a higher electromotive force of 1.56 V compared to 1.23 V for hydrogen. Hydrazine breaks down in the cell to form nitrogen and hydrogen which bonds with oxygen, releasing water. Hydrazine was used in fuel cells manufactured by Allis-Chalmers Corp., including some that provided electric power in space satellites in the 1960s.|$|E

[...] During the summer doors and windows of both the factory and the houses were left open for cooling, and during the winter children often congregated around the factory's street-level ventilation outlets for warmth.|$|E
