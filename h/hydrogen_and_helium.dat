5|$|Almost all {{elements}} heavier than <b>hydrogen</b> <b>and</b> <b>helium</b> were created inside the cores of stars.|$|E
5|$|Based on spectroscopy, Saturn {{is thought}} to be similar in {{composition}} to Jupiter, but the other giant planets Uranus and Neptune have relatively less <b>hydrogen</b> <b>and</b> <b>helium</b> and relatively more ices and are thus now termed ice giants.|$|E
5|$|Ice giants, Uranus and Neptune, are {{primarily}} composed of low-boiling-point {{materials such as}} water, methane, and ammonia, with thick atmospheres of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>and</b> <b>helium.</b> They have a significantly lower mass than the gas giants (only 14 and 17 Earth masses).|$|E
50|$|H3He {{exists for}} N from 1 to over 30, {{and there are}} also {{clusters}} with more <b>hydrogen</b> atoms <b>and</b> <b>helium.</b>|$|R
500|$|Jupiter's upper {{atmosphere}} is about 88–92% <b>hydrogen</b> <b>and</b> 8–12% <b>helium</b> by percent volume of gas molecules. A helium atom has {{about four times}} as much mass as a hydrogen atom, so the composition changes when described as the proportion of mass contributed by different atoms. Thus, Jupiter's atmosphere is approximately 75% <b>hydrogen</b> <b>and</b> 24% <b>helium</b> by mass, with the remaining one percent of the mass consisting of other elements. [...] The atmosphere contains trace amounts of methane, water vapor, ammonia, and silicon-based compounds. There are also traces of carbon, ethane, hydrogen sulfide, neon, oxygen, phosphine, and sulfur. The outermost layer of the atmosphere contains crystals of frozen ammonia. The interior contains denser materials - by mass it is roughly 71% <b>hydrogen,</b> 24% <b>helium,</b> <b>and</b> 5% other elements. Through infrared and ultraviolet measurements, trace amounts of benzene and other hydrocarbons have also been found.|$|R
25|$|Many gases can be {{liquefied}} by cooling, producing liquids such as liquid oxygen, liquid nitrogen, liquid <b>hydrogen</b> <b>and</b> liquid <b>helium.</b> Not all gases can be liquified at atmospheric pressure, {{for example}} carbon dioxide {{can only be}} liquified at pressures above 5.1 atm.|$|R
5|$|Like most astronomical objects, NGC 6543 {{consists}} {{mostly of}} <b>hydrogen</b> <b>and</b> <b>helium,</b> with heavier elements present in small quantities. The exact composition may {{be determined by}} spectroscopic studies. Abundances are generally expressed relative to hydrogen, the most abundant element.|$|E
5|$|The Kepler {{team has}} said that Kepler-11b and Kepler-11c are {{probably}} composed mostly of water with a thin <b>hydrogen</b> <b>and</b> <b>helium</b> atmosphere. In comparison to the outer planets of the system, which probably have large <b>hydrogen</b> <b>and</b> <b>helium</b> atmospheres, Kepler-11c's proximity to its star has blown off most of its atmosphere. Kepler-11 and its six-planet system form what NASA considers {{to be the most}} compact and flattest planetary system yet discovered. Kepler-11b and Kepler-11c orbit Kepler-11 with a phenomenon called orbital resonance, a gravitational tugging that keeps their orbit stable at a 5.4 ratio.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of {{large quantities of}} <b>hydrogen</b> <b>and</b> <b>helium</b> on Kepler-11d, Kepler-11e, and Kepler-11f suggest that these planets formed within the first few million years of the system's existence, when gas could still be captured from the forming protoplanetary disc.|$|E
50|$|Jupiter's upper {{atmosphere}} {{is composed of}} about 75% <b>hydrogen</b> <b>and</b> 24% <b>helium</b> by mass, with the remaining 1% consisting of other elements. The interior contains denser materials such that the distribution is roughly 71% <b>hydrogen,</b> 24% <b>helium</b> <b>and</b> 5% other elements by mass. The atmosphere contains trace amounts of methane, water vapor, ammonia, and silicon-based compounds. There are also traces of carbon, ethane, hydrogen sulfide, neon, oxygen, phosphine, and sulfur. The outermost layer of the atmosphere contains crystals of frozen ammonia, possibly underlaid by {{a thin layer of}} water.|$|R
50|$|A {{thermonuclear}} supernova is {{the explosion}} of a white dwarf in a binary star system, triggered by thermonuclear reactions in matter from a companion star accreted {{on the surface of}} the white dwarf. The accreted matter is rich in <b>hydrogen</b> (protons) <b>and</b> <b>helium</b> (&alpha; particles) <b>and</b> becomes hot enough to allow nuclear reactions.|$|R
40|$|The {{significant}} structure {{theory of}} quantum liquids such as <b>hydrogen,</b> deuterium, <b>and</b> <b>helium</b> {{has been applied}} to the physical adsorption occurring in the submonolayer region. The partition function for the two-dimensional adsorbed fluid has been derived. The properties of isothermal and isosteric heat show good agreement with the available data from the literature...|$|R
5|$|Although both <b>hydrogen</b> <b>and</b> <b>helium</b> {{are in the}} s-block, {{neither of}} them behaves {{similarly}} to other s-block elements. Their behaviour is {{so different from the}} other s-block elements that there is considerable disagreement over where these two elements should be placed in the periodic table.|$|E
5|$|Because it isn't {{as close}} to its star as its sister planets Kepler-11b and Kepler-11c, the Kepler team {{suggests}} that its light density may come from a large <b>hydrogen</b> <b>and</b> <b>helium</b> atmosphere {{that has not been}} blown away by the stellar wind.|$|E
5|$|During the {{following}} two billion years, the accumulated matter settles into a galactic disc. A galaxy will continue to absorb infalling material from high-velocity clouds and dwarf galaxies throughout its life. This matter is mostly <b>hydrogen</b> <b>and</b> <b>helium.</b> The cycle of stellar birth and death slowly increases the abundance of heavy elements, eventually allowing the formation of planets.|$|E

5000|$|In the 1980s, a [...] "plasma fountain" [...] of <b>hydrogen,</b> <b>helium,</b> <b>and</b> oxygen ions was {{discovered}} {{flowing from the}} Earth's north pole.|$|R
5|$|Gas giants, Jupiter and Saturn, are giant planets {{primarily}} {{composed of}} <b>hydrogen</b> <b>and</b> <b>helium</b> {{and are the}} most massive planets in the Solar System. Jupiter, at 318 Earth masses, is the largest planet in the Solar System, and Saturn is one third as massive, at 95 Earth masses.|$|E
5|$|In February 2016, it was {{announced}} that NASA Hubble Space Telescope had detected <b>hydrogen</b> <b>and</b> <b>helium</b> (and suggestions of hydrogen cyanide), but no water vapor, in the atmosphere of 55Cancrie, the first time the atmosphere of a super-earth exoplanet was analyzed successfully.|$|E
5|$|In addition, {{the giant}} planets {{probably}} had accretion disks of their own, {{in the first}} meaning of the word. The clouds of captured <b>hydrogen</b> <b>and</b> <b>helium</b> gas contracted, spun up, flattened, and deposited gas {{onto the surface of}} each giant protoplanet, while solid bodies within that disk accreted into the giant planet's regular moons.|$|E
40|$|The {{complete}} {{contribution of}} diagrams with the light-by-light scattering to the Lamb shift is found for muonic <b>hydrogen,</b> deuterium <b>and</b> <b>helium</b> ion. The results are {{obtained in the}} static muon approximation {{and a part of}} the paper is devoted to the verification of this approximation and analysis of its uncertainty.

5|$|It {{is unclear}} whether triple-alpha helium fusion has started {{at the core of}} Eta Carinae A. The {{elemental}} abundances at the surface cannot be accurately measured, but ejecta within the Homunculus are around 60% <b>hydrogen</b> <b>and</b> 40% <b>helium,</b> with nitrogen enhanced to ten times solar levels. This is indicative of ongoing CNO cycle hydrogen fusion.|$|R
25|$|The outer {{atmosphere}} of Saturn consists of about 93.2% <b>hydrogen</b> <b>and</b> 6.7% <b>helium.</b> Trace amounts of ammonia, acetylene, ethane, phosphine, and methane {{have also been}} detected. As with Jupiter, the upper clouds on Saturn are composed of ammonia crystals, while the lower level clouds appear to be composed of either ammonium hydrosulfide (NH4SH) or water.|$|R
5|$|The Sun, which {{comprises}} {{nearly all}} the matter in the Solar System, is composed of roughly 98% <b>hydrogen</b> <b>and</b> <b>helium.</b> Jupiter and Saturn, which comprise {{nearly all the}} remaining matter, are also primarily composed of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>and</b> <b>helium.</b> A composition gradient exists in the Solar System, created by heat and light pressure from the Sun; those objects closer to the Sun, which are more affected by heat and light pressure, are composed of elements with high melting points. Objects farther from the Sun are composed largely of materials with lower melting points. The boundary in the Solar System beyond which those volatile substances could condense {{is known as the}} frost line, and it lies at roughly 5 AU from the Sun.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{consisting}} {{mostly of}} <b>hydrogen</b> <b>and</b> <b>helium,</b> most of Saturn's mass {{is not in}} the gas phase, because hydrogen becomes a non-ideal liquid when the density is above 0.01g/cm3, which is reached at a radius containing 99.9% of Saturn's mass. The temperature, pressure, and density inside Saturn all rise steadily toward the core, which causes hydrogen to be a metal in the deeper layers.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hydrogen</b> <b>and</b> <b>helium</b> are {{estimated}} to make up approximately 99 per cent of all ordinary matter in the universe. Less than five per cent of the Universe {{is believed to be}} made of ordinary matter, represented by stars, planets and living beings. The balance is made of dark energy and dark matter, both of which are poorly understood at present.|$|E
50|$|It {{is unclear}} whether triple-alpha helium fusion has started {{at the core of}} Eta Carinae A. The {{elemental}} abundances at the surface cannot be accurately measured, but ejecta within the Homunculus are around 60% <b>hydrogen</b> <b>and</b> 40% <b>helium,</b> with nitrogen enhanced to ten times solar levels.

500|$|At high altitudes, Neptune's {{atmosphere}} is 80% <b>hydrogen</b> <b>and</b> 19% <b>helium.</b> A trace amount of methane is also present. Prominent absorption bands of methane exist at wavelengths above 600nm, {{in the red}} and infrared portion of the spectrum. As with Uranus, this absorption of red light by the atmospheric methane {{is part of what}} gives Neptune its blue hue, ...|$|R
5|$|Active {{elliptical}} galaxies of a form {{similar to}} M87 {{are believed to}} form {{as a result of}} one or more mergers between smaller galaxies. There is now little dust remaining to form the diffuse nebulae where new stars were created, so the stellar population is dominated by old, population II stars that contain relatively low abundances of elements other than <b>hydrogen</b> <b>and</b> <b>helium.</b> M87's elliptical shape is maintained by random orbital motions of its member stars, in contrast to the more orderly rotational motions found in a spiral galaxy such as the Milky Way.|$|E
5|$|All heavier {{elements}} (including those {{necessary for}} rocky planets like the Earth, and for carbon-based or other life) have thus been created since the Big Bang in stars which were {{hot enough to}} fuse helium itself. All elements other than <b>hydrogen</b> <b>and</b> <b>helium</b> today account for only 2% {{of the mass of}} atomic matter in the universe. Helium-4, by contrast, makes up about 23% of the universe's ordinary matter—nearly all the ordinary matter that is not hydrogen.|$|E
5|$|All of the Solar System planets except Mercury have {{substantial}} atmospheres because their gravity {{is strong enough}} to keep gases close to the surface. The larger giant planets are massive enough to keep large amounts of the light gases <b>hydrogen</b> <b>and</b> <b>helium,</b> whereas the smaller planets lose these gases into space. The composition of Earth's atmosphere is different from the other planets because the various life processes that have transpired on the planet have introduced free molecular oxygen.|$|E
50|$|A chemists' table ("Newlands Revisited") with an {{alternative}} positioning of <b>hydrogen,</b> <b>helium</b> <b>and</b> the lanthanides was published by EG Marks and JA Marks in 2010.|$|R
50|$|The four {{collaborators}} who authored B2FH gave {{a different}} {{account for the}} origin of heavy elements, however, suggesting that all atomic nuclei heavier than lithium up to uranium must have been synthesized in stars rather than during the big bang. Both theories agree that some light nuclei (<b>hydrogen,</b> <b>and</b> some <b>helium</b> <b>and</b> lithium) were not created in stars, and {{this led to the}} now-accepted theory of big bang nucleosynthesis.|$|R
50|$|The Sun as a {{protostar}} had {{the same}} composition as today, which is 71.1% <b>hydrogen,</b> 27.4% <b>helium,</b> <b>and</b> 1.5% heavier elements, by mass.|$|R
