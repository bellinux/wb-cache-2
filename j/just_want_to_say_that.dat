This training incorporated a tournament involving boxers from around Europe, in one event of which Singh won gold having beaten a German in the process.

5000|$|In September 2011, Chase was {{involved}} in a porn scandal alongside some Los Angeles City firemen. During one of her scenes for Assesinpublic.com (a site belonging to the Brazzers network) shot a couple of years earlier at Venice Beach, she is seen next to a fire truck, exposing herself and inviting passersby to fondle her. An internal investigation started by the LAFD suggested that the firefighters from Engine 263 (the fire truck) were aware of what was going on, and that the whole scene was premeditated. As a response, Chase stated on her blog: [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I am soooo sorry to the fire fighters involved. it was not my intentions for any one to get hurt or fired or whatever. I am not sure why news reporters are resorting to porn to make there stories these days, but shit… it was a fun day! The Fire Fighters watched me stroll the beach from a distance, but were NOT involved in us invading the truck. I love how news people bend and twist the stories they report to better suit their point. As I said before… there was no set up to that day at all and I tried everything I could to let that be known. That was almost three years ago and it is crazy stupid that this is a problem now."Later on, being invited on FOX 11's Studio 11 LA, she denied again that there was any premeditation to the scene, adding that the fire truck was there by chance when the film crew showed up, and that the firefighters had no involvement in it at all.|$|E

Their institutional support, as well as the help and advice of some of their members has resulted inestimable for my work and personal growth. In particular, two people have been specially near during all this time. First, Christian Blum, who has been my tutor since we started to work on my Master Thesis. There are not enough words to explain how deeply I appreciate his confidence and help during this period. Therefore I will not even try. For those who do not know him I <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> he is someone you are proud to say that you have worked with. I have been his first PhD Student of many to come and I am glad to see that he has mostly enjoyed working with me. I have many things to be thankful for, but I specially appreciate his sincerity. Smart, intelligent and, most of the time, brilliant and friendly, that is Christian in a few words. Second, Maria Jose Serna, who has helped me from the very first day in the department, even before I met Christian. She offered me the opportunity to collaborate with her, offered advice on both academic and scientific topics, helped me find my path when I was lost and, overall, always talked to me with a big smile on her face.

40|$|First of all, I <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> in {{my opinion}} this is an {{interesting}} and thought-provoking book, and a badly needed corrective to certain mistaken assumptions about James. I find myself very much in sympathy with many of its main points. Some of the things I have to say in the following may— or perhaps may not—be thought to disagree with some of what Professor Brown has argued in his book. If that is so, it should be taken only as an indication {{of the degree to which}} William James on Radical Empiricism and Religion stimulates philosophical thought. Similarly, the essay I found myself preparing for this occasion seems in the end to have a lot more to do with what I think about James than, on the surface, it does with Professor Brown’s book: again, I would wish this to be seen as a compliment to the high quality of his work (which is certainly the way I see it), since everything I might have come up with here is in response to my reading of his book. One of Hunter Brown’s theses about William James ’ epistemology, especially as it found its expression in James ’ essay “The Will to Believe, ” is that—far from being an apologist for subjectivism or fideism—James was actually an exponent of his own brand of quite rigorous evidentialism. It is this claim that I primarily wish to examine in this essay. Here is, perhaps, one way of framing the issue that motivates “The Will to Believe. ” First, let u...|$|E
