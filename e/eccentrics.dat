40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Eccentric</b> {{training}} has shown promising {{results in the}} management of Achilles and patellar tendinopathy. Recently, studies have investigated <b>eccentric</b> training in the treatment of lateral elbow tendinopathy. PURPOSE: The purpose of this review was to describe <b>eccentric</b> training programs used to treat LET in order to inform clinicians and identify areas requiring further study. METHOD: An electronic search of publications indexed in the MEDLINE database was performed in May 2007. Studies comparing <b>eccentric</b> training with at least one other intervention were included. Results. Four studies investigating a total of 248 participants were identified. Three of the four studies reported superior results for <b>eccentric</b> training compared with other interventions, although this included one pilot study and another study that did not include an extended follow-up. There were several differences between the studies, including whether <b>eccentric</b> training was painful or pain-free, the duration of <b>eccentric</b> training (4 - 12 weeks) and whether training was performed in a clinical setting or at home. CONCLUSION: <b>Eccentric</b> training {{in the management of}} LET has demonstrated encouraging results, although the literature is limited and <b>eccentric</b> programs are varied. Future studies should investigate factors that may influence the outcome of <b>eccentric</b> training, including whether training is painful and the duration of <b>eccentric</b> training...|$|R

25|$|Socially {{the island}} is highly diverse, with the {{creative}} sector (artists, musicians, scientists, writers, poets and actors) and <b>eccentrics</b> strongly represented. It has 1,206 businesses but around 1,000 people commute daily to Auckland as career opportunities are limited. 60.9 per cent of the residents are in employment. The main employment sectors are hospitality (23 per cent) and retail (15%) followed by education, agriculture/horticulture and healthcare (10% each). Gentrification and land speculation is having an impact, with high rates and mortgage interest rates forcing some people on fixed incomes to relocate. New Zealand council rates are based on land and building valuations, which take into account potential value for redevelopment even if the owners live on the property and have no intention to sell or redevelop. The cost of living is higher compared to the mainland, due to the shipping-freight costs of most foodstuffs, fuel and amenities.|$|E

40|$|Imaging {{of debris}} disks has found {{evidence}} for both <b>eccentric</b> and offset disks. One {{hypothesis is that}} these provide evidence for massive perturbers that sculpt the observed structures. One such disk was recently observed in the far-IR by the Herschel Space Observatory around ζ^ 2 Ret. In contrast with previously reported systems, the disk is significantly <b>eccentric,</b> and the system is Gyr-old. We aim to investigate the long-term evolution of <b>eccentric</b> structures in debris disks caused by a perturber on an <b>eccentric</b> orbit. Both analytical predictions and numerical N-body simulations are used to investigate the observable structures that could be produced by <b>eccentric</b> perturbers. The long-term evolution of the disk geometry is examined, with particular application to the ζ^ 2 Ret system. In addition, synthetic images of the disk are produced for comparison with Herschel observations. We show that an <b>eccentric</b> companion can produce both the observed offsets and <b>eccentric</b> disks. Such effects are not immediate and we characterise the timescale required for the disk to develop to an <b>eccentric</b> state. For the case of ζ^ 2 Ret, we place limits on the mass and orbit of the companion required to produce the observations. Synthetic images show that the pattern observed around ζ^ 2 Ret can be produced by an <b>eccentric</b> disk seen close to edge-on, and allow us to bring additional constraints on the disk parameters of our model (disk flux, extent). We determine that <b>eccentric</b> planets or stellar companions can induce long-lived <b>eccentric</b> structures in debris disks. Observations of such <b>eccentric</b> structures provide potential evidence {{of the presence of}} such a companion in a planetary system. We consider the example of ζ^ 2 Ret, whose observed <b>eccentric</b> disk can be explained by a distant companion at tens of AU, on an <b>eccentric</b> orbit (e_p≳ 0. 3) ...|$|R

40|$|Performance of {{a series}} of <b>eccentric</b> contractions {{produces}} adverse effects including muscle weakness, delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS), fluid accumulation and decreased muscle function. The repeated bout effect is a physiological adaptation observed when a single-bout of <b>eccentric</b> exercise protects against muscle damage from subsequent <b>eccentric</b> bouts. Similar to the repeated bout effect, increases in flexibility have been linked to attenuations in acute muscle damage, muscle fatigue and strength loss after <b>eccentric</b> exercise. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the muscle physiological responses to <b>eccentric</b> strength training after first priming the muscles with either a period of static flexibility training or a single intense bout of <b>eccentric</b> exercise performed weeks earlier; and compare these to the responses from <b>eccentric</b> strength training when no prior intervention is administered. Methods: Twenty-five participants were randomly assigned to a flexibility (F) (n= 8), a single-bout (SB) (n= 9), or a control (C) (n= 8) group. The design consisted of two 4 -week phases; 1) priming intervention, 2) <b>eccentric</b> training. The priming intervention included static stretching (3 x/week; 30 mins/day) (F), a single-bout of <b>eccentric</b> exercise (SB) or no priming intervention (C). All groups proceeded to complete <b>eccentric</b> training of the knee flexors using isotonic contractions (%load progressively increased over training period) on a dynamometer following the priming intervention phase. Testing was completed at baseline, post-priming intervention and post-eccentric training, in conjunction with data being collected during the acute <b>eccentric</b> training phase (0 hr, 24 hr, 48 hr; post-bout 1 and 4). Dependent measures included muscle thickness, isometric maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), <b>eccentric</b> and concentric MVC, optimal angle, active range of motion (ROM), passive ROM, maximal power, electromyography (EMG) and delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS). Results: Acute data during the <b>eccentric</b> training phase revealed a significant reduction in DOMS for both the F and SB groups compared to the C following the first bout of <b>eccentric</b> exercise (p< 0. 05). The F also had reduced soreness in comparison to both the SB and C post fourth bout of <b>eccentric</b> exercise (p< 0. 05). The F group demonstrated attenuated loss in isometric strength (post fourth bout) and maximal power (post first bout) during <b>eccentric</b> training compared to the C group (p< 0. 05). However, there was no significant difference between groups across all dependent variables following the <b>eccentric</b> training phase. Conclusion: This is the first study to directly compare the protective effects observed with static flexibility training to that of a single-bout of <b>eccentric</b> exercise throughout a subsequent <b>eccentric</b> training regime. Although differences in muscle soreness, strength and maximal power occurred during the acute stages of <b>eccentric</b> training, there appeared to be no significant advantage of either protective priming method at the end of <b>eccentric</b> training...|$|R
