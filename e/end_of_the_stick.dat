25|$|Ribbon: It {{is made of}} satin {{or another}} similar {{material}} cloth of any colour and may be multi-coloured as well as have designs on it. The ribbon itself {{must be at least}} 35g (1oz), 4–6cm (1.6–2.4") in width and for senior category a minimum length of 6m (20') (5m (16.25') for juniors). The ribbon must be in one piece. The end that is attached to the stick is doubled for a maximum length of 1m (3'). This is stitched down both sides. At the top, a very thin reinforcement or rows of machine stitching for a maximum length of 5cm is authorized. This extremity may end in a strap, or have an eyelet (a small hole, edged with buttonhole stitch or a metal circle), to permit attaching the ribbon. The ribbon is fixed to the stick by means of a supple attachment such as thread, nylon cord, or a series of articulated rings. The attachment has a maximum length of 7cm (2.8"), not counting the strap or metal ring at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stick</b> where it will be fastened. Compulsory elements for the ribbon include flicks, circles, snakes and spirals, and throws. It requires a high degree of co-ordination to form the spirals and circles as any knots which may accidentally form in the ribbon are penalised. During a ribbon routine, large, smooth and flowing movements are looked for.|$|E

500|$|On January 14, 2010, it was {{announced}} [...] that Holtz accepted the head coach position at the University of South Florida, in Tampa, Florida, taking {{the place of the}} recently fired Jim Leavitt. A press conference to introduce Holtz to the community was held for January 15, 2010. When someone in the crowd called out, [...] "Beat Florida!", Holtz replied, [...] "That's why I'm here!"

50|$|The hammers {{are made}} of {{flexible}} bamboo, and one end is half covered by rubber. Due to their unique construction, {{there are two ways}} to play: with the rubber side for a softer sound, and with the bamboo side for a crisper, more percussive sound. This technique, known as 反竹 (fǎnzhǔ), is best utilized in <b>the</b> higher ranges <b>of</b> <b>the</b> yangqin. Additionally, <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sticks</b> can be used to pluck the strings, producing a sharp, clear sound. Glissandos can also be achieved in this way by running <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sticks</b> up or down the strings.|$|R

500|$|Contrary to the accusations, {{the band}} have always denied {{the notion that}} they are Satanists, with lead vocalist, Bruce Dickinson, doing so on-stage in the Live After Death concert video. Steve Harris has since commented that, [...] "It was mad. They {{completely}} got the wrong <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stick.</b> They obviously hadn't read the lyrics. They just wanted to believe all that rubbish about us being Satanists." [...] Harris has also stated that [...] "The Number of the Beast" [...] song was inspired by a nightmare he had after watching , and also influenced by Robert Burns' Tam o' Shanter. Furthermore, the band's drummer, Nicko McBrain, has been a born again Christian since 1999.|$|E
500|$|Michael Schumacher and Jacques Villeneuve vied for {{the title}} in [...] Villeneuve, driving the {{superior}} Williams FW19, led the championship {{in the early part}} of the season. However, by mid-season, Schumacher had taken the championship lead, winning five races, and entered the season's final Grand Prix with a one-point advantage. Towards the end of the race, held at Jerez, Schumacher's Ferrari developed a coolant leak and loss of performance indicating he may not finish the race. As Villeneuve approached to pass his rival, Schumacher attempted to provoke an accident, but got the short <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stick,</b> retiring from the race. Villeneuve went on and scored four points to take the championship. Schumacher was punished for unsportsmanlike conduct for the collision and was disqualified from the Drivers' Championship.|$|E
500|$|Charlie's {{relationship}} with Angelo {{has been a}} focal point in her storylines. They originally date, but break up after Angelo kills Jack Holden (Paul O'Brien). Charlie becomes jealous when Angelo begins dating May Stone (Alin Sumarwata) and Anderson told Inside Soap that [...] "Charlie's feelings for Angelo are complex." [...] Charlie cannot fight her attraction to Angleo and the actress claimed that the couple would not have broken up {{if it had not}} been for Jack's death. Anderson also stated that the storyline sees a new side to Charlie, jealousy. She decides to get in the way of his new relationship. Anderson went on to explain: [...] "She admits part of her wanted to cause trouble, but Angelo is still attracted to Charlie and they sleep together." [...] The actress also defends Charlie's actions claiming she did not intentionally set out to hurt May. Charlie and Angeo's relationship dynamic becomes strained after Charlie refuses to give Angelo an [...] "easy life." [...] Although they have a [...] "great connection between them", Anderson felt Angelo would not put up with Charlie for long because she can be [...] "quite bossy." [...] She also said [...] "Charlie's got the good <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stick</b> and poor Angelo is in for a pretty rough ride!" ...|$|E

50|$|A bow is a {{flexible}} piece of material which shoots aerodynamic projectiles called arrows. A string joins the two ends {{and when the}} string is drawn back, <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stick</b> are flexed. When the string is released, <b>the</b> potential energy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flexed <b>stick</b> is transformed into <b>the</b> velocity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> arrow. Archery is the art or sport of shooting arrows from bows.|$|R

2500|$|Wila {{is often}} growing high in trees, {{and thus can}} be {{difficult}} to harvest. [...] The most common way to collect the lichen is to reach up into the tree with a long stick, twist the lichen around the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stick</b> (which is sometimes hooked) and then pull the lichen down off the tree. [...] This lichen-collecting stick is called txipmn in the Okanagan language.|$|E
2500|$|The {{objective}} {{of the game is}} for players to use a wooden stick called a hurley (in Irish a , pronounced [...] or [...] ) to hit a small ball called a [...] between the opponents' goalposts either over the crossbar for one point, or under the crossbar into a net guarded by a goalkeeper for one goal, which is equivalent to three points. The [...] can be caught in the hand and carried for not more than four steps, struck in the air, or struck on the ground with the hurley. It can be kicked, or slapped with an open hand (the hand pass) for short-range passing. A player who wants to carry the ball for more than four steps has to bounce or balance the [...] on the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stick,</b> and the ball can only be handled twice while in his possession.|$|E

50|$|In mitred <b>sticking,</b> <b>the</b> profile (known as <b>the</b> <b>sticking)</b> {{is applied}} to <b>the</b> edges <b>of</b> both <b>the</b> rail and stile and then a section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sticking</b> at <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> each stile is removed leaving a mitred edge which aligns to a similar mitre cut on <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sticking</b> on each rail. This {{traditional}} method is more time consuming to complete, hence <b>the</b> popularity <b>of</b> cope and stick for manufactured items.|$|R
50|$|During <b>the</b> {{earliest}} periods <b>of</b> music history, prior the Baroque era, {{the frog}} was a curved {{piece of wood}} affixed to the bow {{that served as a}} sort of rail to guide the hair ribbon and separate it from <b>the</b> <b>stick.</b> <b>The</b> bow hair was attached at both <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stick</b> to <b>the</b> head and handle. The musician had to stretch and release the hair ribbon while playing in order to obtain the desire tension.|$|R
50|$|A bow {{consists}} of a specially shaped stick with other material forming a ribbon stretched between its ends, {{which is used to}} stroke the string and create sound. Different musical cultures have adopted various designs for the bow. For instance, in some bows a single cord is stretched between <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stick.</b> In <b>the</b> Western tradition <b>of</b> bow making—bows for <b>the</b> instruments <b>of</b> <b>the</b> violin and viol families—a hank of horsehair is normally employed.|$|R
6000|$|Again Earl was silent. He had {{sharpened}} up one <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stick,</b> and now {{he turned}} to the other. [...] "I wonder where we could telegraph from best," [...] he said at last.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{must not}} saw it off {{until it is}} all {{sharpened}} and smoothed. By that means, you see, the long <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stick,</b> that you make it from, will serve for a handle." ...|$|E

5000|$|The word hockey {{itself is}} of unknown origin. One {{supposition}} {{is that it}} is a derivative of hoquet, a Middle French word for a shepherd's stave. The curved, or [...] "hooked" [...] <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sticks</b> used for hockey would indeed have resembled these staves. Another supposition derives from <b>the</b> known use <b>of</b> cork bungs, (stoppers) in place of wooden balls to play the game. The stoppers came from barrels containing [...] "hock" [...] ale, also called [...] "hocky".|$|R
60|$|When {{twilight}} fell Slone {{went down}} after Nagger and, returning with him, put on bridle and saddle. Then {{he began to}} search for suitable sticks of wood. Farther back in the pass he found stunted dead cedars, and from these secured enough for his purpose. He kindled a fire and burnt <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sticks</b> into red embers. Making a bundle of these, he put them under his arm, the dull, glowing ends backward, and then mounted his horse.|$|R
60|$|George {{went to the}} parlor, {{which served}} as writing-room, and found Flora there. She smiled as she noticed <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{parchment}} <b>sticking</b> out <b>of</b> his pocket.|$|R
60|$|When {{this had}} been done to his satisfaction, and it seemed to give him {{greatest}} pleasure to keep me in suspense as to his purpose, he tied to the smaller <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stick</b> the fringe from his shirt.|$|E
60|$|He {{turned off}} the light; there was the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stick,</b> {{and there was the}} little patch of sandy gravel, which he stepped upon, {{stamping}} heavily as he did so. He then retired outside the screen. Professor Tippengray turned to the audience.|$|E
60|$|Henry {{left the}} cooking {{to come and}} see. Not only had his partner tied the dogs up, but he had tied them, after the Indian fashion, with sticks. About the neck of each dog he had {{fastened}} a leather thong. To this, and {{so close to the}} neck that the dog could not get his teeth to it, he had tied a stout stick four or five feet in length. The other <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stick,</b> in turn, was made fast to a stake in the ground by means of a leather thong. The dog was unable to gnaw through the leather at his own <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stick.</b> The stick prevented him from getting at the leather that fastened the other end.|$|E
5000|$|... "Almost always {{after the}} ground was wet, {{earthworms}} would deposit mud in little piles on the playing fields early in the mornings. At some point, some young lads would gather long <b>sticks</b> from <b>the</b> poplar trees and mould these mud deposits on <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sticks</b> (which in some cases were over three metres long) and deftly whip them towards their enemies. This {{was known as a}} sport of Claylighties. It stung when that mud hit its mark! There was a more vicious version of this game that is best left secret. Many boys were seriously injured by it." ...|$|R
60|$|Astronomy teaches <b>the</b> correct use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{sun and the}} planets. These may be put on a {{frame of}} little sticks and turned round. This causes the tides. Those at <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sticks</b> are {{enormously}} far away. From time to time a diligent searching <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sticks</b> reveals new planets. <b>The</b> orbit <b>of</b> a planet is <b>the</b> distance <b>the</b> <b>stick</b> goes round in going round. Astronomy is intensely interesting; {{it should be done}} at night, in a high tower in Spitzbergen. This is to avoid the astronomy being interrupted.

50|$|Cast iron {{proved to}} be a {{beneficial}} material for <b>the</b> manufacture <b>of</b> water pipes and was used as a replacement for the original elm pipelines laid in the ground earlier. These water pipelines were composed of individually cast pipe sections, often termed sticks, jointed together by a bell and spigot joint. Here one <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pipe <b>stick</b> is flared, termed the bell or socket, to enable <b>the</b> opposite <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> next <b>stick,</b> <b>the</b> spigot end, to be inserted to create a joint. The gaps in these joints were sealed with oakum to prevents the water leaking out. A molten-lead joint was then run around the socket to ensure that the oakum seal remained in place.|$|R
60|$|To {{one side}} of the camp lay a fantastically carved stick, evidently cut by {{somebody}} during his leisure.

60|$|He did {{not like}} it. Nor did he like it when the man-animals arose and went on with their march; for a tiny man-animal took the other <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stick</b> and led Kiche captive behind him, and behind Kiche {{followed}} White Fang, greatly perturbed and worried by this new adventure he had entered upon.|$|E
60|$|When the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stick</b> came {{up out of}} the sand, {{the boys}} saw, to their great delight, that the half dollar was {{sticking}} fast on.

60|$|Then {{he went to}} work {{upon his}} beetle. He {{selected}} a round stick of wood, <b>of</b> about <b>the</b> right size, and then examined it carefully to find the part which was most uniform and regular in its shape; and he bored a hole for the handle in <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> this part. He made his handle of pine wood, for this was much easier to cut, and Jonas told him he thought it would do nearly as well. When the handle was finished, he drove it into the hole, and then he sawed off <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stick</b> <b>of</b> wood at <b>the</b> right distances from the hole. He first took pains to measure on each side, so as to have the distances exactly the same.|$|R

Blackpool rock is usually at least 2.5 cm in diameter, and can be as thick as 17 cm across and up to 2 m long when made for special retail displays. These cylinders usually have a pattern embedded throughout the length, which is often <b>the</b> name <b>of</b> <b>the</b> resort where the rock is sold, so that the name can be read on both <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stick</b> (reversed at one end) and remains legible even after pieces are bitten off. Rock is also manufactured as a promotional item, for example with a company name running through it.|$|R
