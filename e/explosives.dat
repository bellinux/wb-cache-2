5|$|By July 1944, Oppenheimer had {{concluded}} plutonium {{could not be}} used in a gun design, and opted for implosion. The accelerated effort on an implosion design, codenamed Fat Man, began in August 1944 when Oppenheimer implemented a sweeping reorganization of the Los Alamos laboratory to focus on implosion. Two new groups were created at Los Alamos to develop the implosion weapon, X (for <b>explosives)</b> Division headed by <b>explosives</b> expert George Kistiakowsky and G (for gadget) Division under Robert Bacher. The new design that von Neumann and T (for theoretical) Division, most notably Rudolf Peierls, had devised used explosive lenses to focus the explosion onto a spherical shape using a combination of both slow and fast high <b>explosives.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} test the <b>explosive</b> {{components}} by X-ray or 60 Co γ-ray non-destructive testing, the attenuation rules that X-ray and 60 Co γ-ray attenuate in pure and impure <b>explosive</b> must be known. 10 <b>explosive</b> columns are made for study. The data of X-ray and 60 Co γ-ray attenuatedt in <b>explosive</b> is studied {{on the basis of}} both theory and experiment. The X-ray and γ-ray attenuation in a certain <b>explosive</b> in different conditions are fitting through the regression analysis. The X-ray attenuation rule in this <b>explosive</b> is educed through analyzing the fitting results and the two kinds of results are compared. For γ-ray, the attenuation, which is calculated theoretically by the method of Monte Carlo (M-C), is compared with the result of experiment. The results indicate that the attenuation rule of X-ray in a certain <b>explosive</b> accords with cubic equation. The attenuation rule of γ-ray attenuation in pure <b>explosive</b> and impure <b>explosive,</b> which contains copper, iron and lead, is exponent equation. That the X-ray attenuation in impure <b>explosive</b> is obvious shows that it is feasible {{to test the}} <b>explosive</b> using X-ray or γ-ray.

5|$|During World War II, Kistiakowsky was {{the head}} of the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC) section {{responsible}} for the development of <b>explosives,</b> and the technical director of the <b>Explosives</b> Research Laboratory (ERL), where he oversaw the development of new <b>explosives,</b> including RDX and HMX. He was involved in research into the hydrodynamic theory of explosions, and the development of shaped charges. In October 1943, he was brought into the Manhattan Project as a consultant. He was soon placed in charge of X Division, which was responsible for the development of the explosive lenses necessary for an implosion-type nuclear weapon. In July 1945, he watched as the first one was detonated in the Trinity test. A few weeks later another Fat Man implosion-type weapon was dropped on Nagasaki.|$|E
5|$|<b>Explosives</b> {{would also}} have been superfluous. At its closing {{velocity}} of 10.2km/s, the impactor's kinetic energy was equivalent to 4.8 metric tons of TNT, considerably more than its actual mass of only 370kg.|$|E
5|$|Following the Palomares and Thule accidents—the only {{cases where}} the {{conventional}} <b>explosives</b> of U.S. nuclear bombs accidentally detonated and dispersed nuclear materials—investigators concluded the high explosive (HE) used in nuclear weapons was not chemically stable enough to withstand the forces involved in an aircraft accident. They also determined that the electrical circuits of the weapons' safety devices became unreliable in a fire and allowed connections to short circuit. The findings triggered research by scientists in the United States into safer conventional <b>explosives</b> and fireproof casings for nuclear weapons.|$|E

50|$|A nuclear <b>explosive</b> is an <b>explosive</b> {{device that}} derives its energy from nuclear reactions. Almost all nuclear <b>explosive</b> devices {{that have been}} {{designed}} and produced are nuclear weapons intended for warfare.|$|R
5000|$|A high <b>explosive</b> bomb is {{one that}} employs a process called [...] "detonation" [...] to rapidly go from an {{initially}} high energy molecule to a very low energy molecule. Detonation is distinct from deflagration in that the chemical reaction propagates faster {{than the speed of}} sound (often many times faster) in an intense shock wave. Therefore, the pressure wave produced by a high <b>explosive</b> is not significantly increased by confinement as detonation occurs so quickly that the resulting plasma does not expand much before all the <b>explosive</b> material has reacted. This has {{led to the development of}} plastic <b>explosive.</b> A casing is still employed in some high <b>explosive</b> bombs, but with the purpose of fragmentation. Most high <b>explosive</b> bombs consist of an insensitive secondary <b>explosive</b> that must be detonated with a blasting cap containing a more sensitive primary <b>explosive.</b>|$|R
