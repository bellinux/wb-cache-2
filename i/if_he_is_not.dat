5|$|Eddie {{returns to}} {{challenge}} Fats again, putting up his entire $3,000 stake {{on a single}} game. He wins game after game, beating Fats so badly that Fats is forced to quit. Bert demands a share of Eddie's winnings and threatens that Eddie will be injured unless he pays. But Eddie says that <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> killed he will kill Bert when he recovers; invoking the memory of Sarah, he shames Bert into giving up his claim. Instead, Bert orders Eddie never {{to walk into a}} big-time pool hall again. Eddie and Fats compliment each other as players, and Eddie walks out.|$|E
5|$|If he accepts, and {{is already}} a bishop, he {{immediately}} takes office. <b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a bishop, however, he must be first consecrated as one before he can assume office. If a priest is elected, the Cardinal Dean consecrates him bishop; if a layman is elected, then the Cardinal Dean first ordains him deacon, then priest, and only then consecrates him as bishop. Only after becoming a bishop does the pope-elect take office. These functions of the Dean are assumed, if necessary, by the sub-Dean, and if the sub-Dean is also impeded, they are assumed by the senior cardinal-bishop in attendance. In 2005 the Dean himself—Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger—was elected pope. In 2013, the Dean and sub-Dean were not in attendance (over the age limit), and these functions were assumed by Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re.|$|E

25|$|A {{player who}} {{declares}} {{for the draft}} will lose his college eligibility, even <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> drafted, if he signs with any agent. Before 2016, the NCAA only allowed a player to enter the draft once without losing eligibility, but current NCAA rules now allow players to declare for and withdraw from multiple drafts while retaining college eligibility. The CBA allows a player to withdraw twice.|$|E

25|$|Hahn {{believed}} that “The Platonic view {{of education is}} that a nation must do all it can to make the individual citizen discover his own power and further more that the individual becomes a cripple {{in his or her}} point of view <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> qualified by education to serve the community.” The idea of service at the school is thought to encourage students to gain a feeling of responsibility to aid other people and is implemented in creating an array of services to the community which every student becomes involved in.

25|$|As a Google search shows, {{the phrase}} ad orientem is today much more {{commonly}} used to describe a particular orientation of a priest in Christian liturgy, facing the apse or wall behind the altar, with priest and people looking in the same direction, {{as opposed to the}} versus populum orientation, in which the priest faces the congregation. In this use, the phrase is not necessarily related to the geographical direction in which the priest is looking and is employed even <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> facing to the east or even has his back to the east.|$|E

25|$|The Qur'an cannot {{deal with}} the State of Israel {{as we know it}} today, since that State came into {{existing}} in 1948 only, i.e. many centuries after the Qur'an itself was revealed. However, the Qur'an specifies that the Land of Israel is the homeland of the Jewish people, that God Himself gave that Land to them as heritage and ordered them to live therein. It also announces that – {{before the end of the}} time – the Jewish people will come from many different countries to retake possession of that heritage of theirs. Whoever denies this actually denies the Qur'an itself. <b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a scholar, and in good faith believes what other people say about this issue, he is an ignorant Muslim. If, on the contrary, he is informed about what the Qur'an and openly opposes it, he ceases to be a Muslim.|$|E
25|$|Acting as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> {{bothered by}} Dr. Lee exiling him, Devon {{contacts}} A's rival school Morris Brown College, to discuss playing for their marching band next season. Mr. Wade, Brown's band leader, says that Devon {{does not need}} to know how to read music and will likely get a full scholarship and a good position on the drumline. When Wade wants to know what Dr. Lee is planning for the BET Big Southern Classic (a large competition of college bands), Devon realizes that his heart and honor are still with the A band. He rejects the scholarship offer from the rival band and returns to A Though Devon is still not playing for the band, he cannot give up his drumming. He is sent cassette tapes from his estranged father and gets some ideas for new drum arrangements. He and Sean have a final confrontation, with Sean telling Devon that he is A's best drummer but that the band is bigger than just one person; this clears the air and they begin to work together. The two present their idea for an entrance cadence to Dr. Lee who decides they will be used during the Classic. Devon helps the drumline prepare and patches up his relationship with Laila. Lee also tells Devon that he can guarantee him a full return to the band next year.|$|E

500|$|Quatermass and the Pit was {{watched by}} an average {{audience}} of 9.6 million viewers, peaking at 11 million for the final episode.

Pointing out that [...] "Professor Bernard Quatermass... like all science fiction heroes, has to keep running hard <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> to be overtaken by the world of fact", the anonymous reviewer went on to state how much he had enjoyed the episode as [...] "an excellent example of Mr. Kneale's ability to hold an audience with promises alone; smooth, leisurely, and without any sensational incident".|$|E
500|$|Lewis Hamilton {{was criticized}} for his {{aggressive}} drive into the first corner by much of the British press. Edward Gorman of The Times described Hamilton's move as [...] "impetuosity and untamed aggression", adding that Hamilton [...] "gambled with a kamikaze attempt to get past Räikkönen". The BBC's Andrew Benson said that [...] "Hamilton is still in a strong position but the Englishman will have to cut out the mistakes that have characterised his season <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> to lose the championship {{for the second year}} in a row." [...] In Italy, La Gazzetta dello Sport said that Hamilton's start suffered from [...] "his usual excessive aggression". Hamilton said [...] "I made a mistake and I paid for it." ...|$|E

Some time after Artanis's reclamation of the Protoss homeworld, Aiur, Kerrigan sends a psionic call to Raynor and Artanis: she proposes an alliance to permanently defeat Amon, since he will only arise again in a few thousand years <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> dealt with. During the assault of the Void by the joint forces of the Terran Dominion, Zerg Swarm and Protoss Dae'laam, the full context of Zeratul's prophecy about Kerrigan is made clear; only a fellow Xel'Naga is capable of killing Amon, and Kerrigan {{is the only one who}} can ascend to that status. With the remainder of the joint armada, Kerrigan is successful in killing Amon during her psychic backlash in the void.|$|E

500|$|Kalākaua, Armstrong and Judd were {{formally}} {{presented to}} Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle. Kalākaua's {{letter to his}} sister Liliuokalani expressed his excitement about meeting the Queen, [...] "…I was quite electrified and monopolized the whole conversation that {{took place during the}} interview." [...] His letter was effusive in details about the titled royals and aristocrats they had met, including the Prince and Princess of Wales, and the Crown Prince and Crown Princess of Prussia. The Prince of Wales paid many attentions to Kalākaua, hoping to sway him away from the United States. He insisted on giving [...] Kalākaua precedence ahead of his brother-in-law, the Crown Prince of Germany and responded to German objections by saying, 'Either the brute is a king or else he is an ordinary black nigger, and <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a king, why is he here?' At this point in their trip, Armstrong temporarily returned to his family in the United States.|$|E
500|$|Pneumonia {{has been}} a common disease {{throughout}} human history. The word is from Greek πνεύμων (pneúmōn) meaning [...] "lung". The symptoms were described by Hippocrates (c. 460 BC – 370 BC): [...] "Peripneumonia, and pleuritic affections, are to be thus observed: If the fever be acute, and if there be pains on either side, or in both, and if expiration be if cough be present, and the sputa expectorated be of a blond or livid color, or likewise thin, frothy, and florid, or having any other character different from the common...

[...] However, Hippocrates referred to pneumonia as a disease [...] "named by the ancients". He also reported the results of surgical drainage of empyemas. Maimonides (1135–1204 AD) observed: [...] "The basic symptoms that occur in pneumonia and that are never lacking are as follows: acute fever, sticking pleuritic pain in the side, short rapid breaths, serrated pulse and cough." [...] This clinical description is quite similar to those found in modern textbooks, and it reflected the extent of medical knowledge through the Middle Ages into the 19th century.|$|E
