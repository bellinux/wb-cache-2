50|$|Hebridean Brewing Company (Companaidh Grùdaidh nan Innse Gall) is an {{independent}} small brewery founded in 2001 (although production didn't begin until late January 2002) by Andy Ribbens in Stornoway on the Isle of Lewis, Scotland. The brewery produces cask ale and <b>filtered</b> <b>beer</b> in bottles.|$|E
50|$|A {{derivative}} technology developed originally for DCC is {{now being}} used for <b>filtering</b> <b>beer.</b> Silicon wafers with micrometer-scale holes are ideal for separating yeast particles from beer. The beer flows through the silicon wafer leaving the yeast particles behind, which results in a very clear beer. The manufacturing process for the filters was originally developed for the read/write heads of DCC decks.|$|R
50|$|Shepherd Neame is an English {{independent}} regional brewery {{founded in}} 1698 in Faversham, Kent, and family-owned since 1864. The brewery produces {{a range of}} cask ales and <b>filtered</b> <b>beers.</b> Production is around 210,000 brewers' barrels a year. It owns 328 pubs and hotels, predominantly in Kent, London and South East England. The company exports to more than 35 countries including Sweden, Italy, Brazil and Canada.|$|R
50|$|Beer {{filtration}} is {{also common}} {{on a small}} scale. It {{is not uncommon for}} homebrewers (those who brew their own beer at home, often in small batches around 5 gal) to <b>filter</b> their own <b>beer.</b> While they lack the sophisticated equipment of large-scale breweries, they can achieve satisfactory results using canister filters with successive, replaceable filter cartridges or pads. Most homebrewers will only <b>filter</b> their <b>beer</b> down to 5 µm to remove the majority of yeast and sediment, although some may <b>filter</b> their <b>beer</b> down to 1.0 or 0.5 µm. Anything smaller introduces risk of removing flavor and beneficial compounds.|$|R
50|$|The Orkney brewery {{produces}} cask ale and <b>filtered</b> <b>beer</b> in bottles, {{and since}} October 2005, a lager. Dark Island a rich, fruity, vinous dark ale, {{is the biggest}} seller. Dark Island has won Champion Beer of Scotland on several occasions. Red MacGregor, a 4% bitter has won the World Cask Beer Gold Medal (BIIA 2001). The same name is used for a 5% premium bitter available filtered in the bottle.|$|E
5000|$|Tanglefoot is {{a premium}} bitter, 4.9% as a cask ale, and 5% as a <b>filtered</b> <b>beer</b> in bottles and cans. According {{to a story}} {{presently}} written on the bottle, it was given its name when the Head Brewer drank [...] "several tankards" [...] and [...] "fell on" [...] {{a name for the}} beer. The cask version is widely available in the south of England, and a pasteurised version is available in bottles or cans in supermarkets nationally.|$|E
50|$|Budweiser is a 5.0% ABV Adjunct pale lager {{introduced}} in 1876 by Adolphus Busch {{and has become}} one of the best selling beers in the United States.

5000|$|<b>Filtered</b> <b>beer</b> {{refers to}} any ale, lager, or {{fermented}} malt beverage {{in which the}} sediment {{left over from the}} brewing process has been removed. Ancient techniques included the use of straw mats, cloth, or straws, and frequently left some sediment in the drink. Modern filtration, introduced {{at the end of the}} 19th century, uses a mechanical process that can remove all sediment, including yeast, from the beer. Such beer is known as bright beer and requires force carbonation before bottling or serving from a keg. In the United Kingdom a beer which has been filtered in the brewery is known as [...] "brewery-conditioned," [...] as opposed to unfiltered cask ales ...|$|E
50|$|Sheet filters use pre-made {{media and}} are {{relatively}} straightforward. The sheets are manufactured to allow only particles {{smaller than a}} given size through, and the brewer is free to choose how finely to <b>filter</b> the <b>beer.</b> The sheets are placed into the filtering frame, sterilized (with hot water, for example) and then used to <b>filter</b> the <b>beer.</b> The sheets can be flushed if the filter becomes blocked, and usually the sheets are disposable and are replaced between filtration sessions. Often the sheets contain powdered filtration media to aid in filtration.|$|R
5000|$|As {{a result}} of its first {{bankruptcy}} in 2001, the company was split into two parts, OnStream Data and OnStream MST. The [...] "Data" [...] division manufactured magnetic tape products and the [...] "MST" [...] division produced the thin film tape heads. [...] MST also produced microsieves and microelectromechanical systems products. After the second OnStream bankruptcy in 2003, the MST division was reborn as fluXXion, a maker of high tech filtering products. fluXXion had some success in <b>filtering</b> <b>beer</b> and other food products, but went bankrupt in 2011.|$|R
50|$|After <b>filtering,</b> the <b>beer</b> is {{packaged}} in glass or plastic bottles. In commercial production, the beer may first be pasteurized before packaging to stop fermentation and extend shelf life.|$|R
40|$|A soil {{organism}} identified as Streptomyces libani var. soldani {{was found to}} produce 4 -thiouracil. The product was isolated in a yield of 150 μg/ml of <b>filtered</b> <b>beer</b> and characterized by C- 13 magnetic resonance and high-resolution mass spectroscopy. The product has a broad antibacterial spectrum but low specific activity...|$|E
40|$|Post-fermentation {{processes}} and maturation are important steps in beer production as they help {{to shape the}} organoleptic properties and stabilize the final product. Brewers can {{use a variety of}} processing aids (e. g. isinglass, PVPP, etc.) and processes (e. g. pasteurization, bottle conditioning, etc.) to achieve a desired final product with a desirable shelf life; however, these processes can have detrimental effects on the vitamin content of the beer. This research found that heat treatments have a marked influence on the decrease in the thiamine diphosphate vitamer, while PVPP and silica treatments have a greater influence on the decrease in riboflavin vitamers. Refrigeration, filtration or centrifugation have no, or only very limited, influence on thiamine or riboflavin vitamers, while application of isinglass, bentonite, tannic acid and SO 2 causes a decrease in both thiamine and riboflavin vitamers. Storage of beer at refrigerated temperatures appears to provide protection against significant degradation of both thiamine and riboflavin vitamers; however, storage of <b>filtered</b> <b>beer</b> at elevated temperatures shows a decrease in thiamine diphosphate and riboflavin. Storage of bottle-conditioned beer at elevated temperatures shows a marked decrease in yeast viability, accompanied by a decrease in thiamine diphosphate and free riboflavin, and a marked increase in free thiamine. These findings provide an insight into the reason why there is a significant variation in the vitamer content of beers, even within a single beer style...|$|E
40|$|Clarification and {{stabilization}} of beer {{as well as}} recovery of beer from surplus yeast are subjects of great interest. Microfiltration through ceramic membranes could address both these applications if the economy {{of this process is}} improved. The aim of the present work was an experimental study of the flux decline in cross flow microfiltration of the <b>filtered</b> <b>beer</b> and aqueous solutions of model foulants. Ceramic membranes with two mean pore sizes of 200 and 500 nm were used. The used microfiltration stand enabled the cleaning of the membrane by back-flushing with the permeate. For better understanding of the fouling process and for identifying of the fouling capacity of individual foulants, the runs were conducted with aqueous solutions of selected model foulants as a- and β-amylase, catechin, commercial α-bitter acids, mixture of maltose and sucrose and washed beer yeast suspension. The concentration of the model foulants was similar as in beer. The suspension of the purified beer yeast (four times washed yeast with a physiological solution) was studied as well. A rapid flux decline was observed during the first two-three minutes. The membrane with larger pores, of 500 nm, exhibited lower steady flux than the more dense membrane with 200 nm pores. Repeated rinsing of the fouled membrane with water after microfiltration recovers {{only a small part of}} the initial flux. The order of model foulants with increasing flux decline capacity is: mixture of maltose and sucrose < amylase <pure beer yeast < α-bitter acids < catechin...|$|E
50|$|Because of its low {{density and}} {{relatively}} low price (about US$50 per tonne of unexpanded perlite), many commercial applications for perlite have developed. In {{the construction and}} manufacturing fields, it is used in lightweight plasters, concrete and mortar (masonry), insulation and ceiling tiles. In horticulture, perlite {{can be used as}} a soil amendment or alone as a medium for hydroponics or for starting cuttings. When used as an amendment it has high permeability / low water retention and helps prevent soil compaction. Perlite is an excellent filtration aid and is used extensively as an alternative to diatomaceous earth. The popularity of perlite usage as a filter medium is growing considerably worldwide. Perlite filters are fairly commonplace in <b>filtering</b> <b>beer</b> before it is bottled.|$|R

40|$|Beer {{clarification}} by microfiltration {{demands a}} finely balanced retention of colloidal particulates (yeast cells, chill haze flocs, etc.) and transmission of sol. macromols. including carbohydrates, proteins, flavor, and color compds. which give the "whole some" {{quality of a}} beer. The required porous transmission of these macromol. species led to an unavoidable, complex and dynamic in-pore membrane fouling in terms of fouling constituents, formation, structure and kinetics, which are the main obstacles in obtaining an economically viable flux and consistency in permeate quality. This exptl. study was carried out with the aims of understanding the dynamic interrelation between flux, fouling and system selectivity during a cross-flow beer microfiltration process so that an effective operating strategy for flux optimization could be formulated {{in conjunction with the}} parallel objective of good product (permeate) quality control. Tubular ceramic membranes (Ceramem) with nominal pore diams. of 0. 2, 0. 5, and 1. 3 micro m were used. Simultaneous measurement of flux and permeate qualities, such as sp. gr. and chill haze level enabled identification of the effect of anti-fouling techniques, such as back-flushing on transmission of essential beer components and on the <b>filtered</b> <b>beer</b> quality. The exptl. evidence lead to an understanding that the drastic flux enhancement achieved by employing back-flushing at reversed membrane morphol. was assocd. with enhanced solute transmission which could, without careful control, upset a balanced transmission of essential beer components and the retention of unwanted "chill haze" components. Further operating parameters and varying system configurations were investigated over their effect on both flux performance and system selectivity. These include membrane pore size, filtration temp., and the addn. of an amorphous silica particles as coagulation agent for hydrophilic proteins. [on SciFinder (R) ...|$|E

50|$|The Wafipa {{tended to}} live in concentrated, widely spaced {{settlements}} of 20-30 round huts, {{no more than a}} few yards apart, each housing three to five each, with two surrounding corridor walls for small livestock. An inner room was for eating and sleeping. Reed mats for sleeping and <b>filtering</b> <b>beer</b> were made by the women, who also used a small hoe when working the fields. Men also made the beds: a single cow hide, or cow hide strips, stretched over a wooden frame with a reed mat placed on the bed before sleeping in it. A total of 100 people in a village were normal; 300-400 people were large and not common. Everyone wore durable cotton cloth of black and white stripes of six by five feet. It took four to five hours to cover the eight-to-nine miles between settlements. Within the settlements, there was a strong emphasis placed on communal values, the most important being sociability.|$|R
