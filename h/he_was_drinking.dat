5|$|After leaving West Ham, Greaves put {{on weight}} and did not attend a match as either a player or a spectator for two years. Drinking formed {{a large part of}} his life and he became an alcoholic; at times <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>drinking</b> 20 pints of lager during the day and {{consuming}} a bottle of vodka in the evening. He later admitted that he was also regularly driving whilst drunk during this period. Seeking an answer to his alcoholism, Greaves decided to return to football at a lower level where he would not be required to be as fit as he had been whilst playing in the Football League. He started playing for his local side, Brentwood, and made his debut on 27 December 1975 in a 2–0 defeat to Witham Town.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, {{he scored}} 834 runs but his average fell to 21.94 {{and he never}} again {{averaged}} over 23 in any season in which he played regularly. Owing to his increasing weight and lack of physical fitness, he found batting much harder. As his physique declined, {{he was unable to}} produce the same batting feats he had managed previously. In the field, although still catching effectively, his inability to chase the ball meant he fielded closer to the batsmen; he also took fewer catches. In both 1934 and 1935, he averaged around 22 with the bat and scored under 800 runs. In 1935, he scored his final first-class century, against Somerset, having not reached the landmark since 1931. Team-mates and observers noticed that in the final years of his career, Chapman frequently left the field during matches, and they suspected <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>drinking</b> in the pavilion.|$|E
5|$|Born in Reading, Berkshire {{and educated}} at Uppingham School, Chapman {{established}} {{a reputation as}} a talented school cricketer and was named one of Wisden's schoolboy Cricketers of the Year in 1919. He went to Pembroke College, Cambridge and represented the University cricket team with great success; his fame reached a peak when he scored centuries against Oxford University and in the Gentlemen v Players match within the space of a week. Chapman made his Test debut in 1924, although he had yet to play County Cricket. Having qualified for Kent, he was the surprise choice to take over from Arthur Carr as England captain in 1926. He achieved victory in his first nine matches in charge but lost two and drew six of his remaining games. Perceived tactical deficiencies and possibly growing concerns over his heavy drinking meant that Chapman was dropped from the team for the fifth Test against Australia in 1930. He captained England on one final tour in 1930–31, after which he never played another Test. After he assumed the Kent captaincy in 1931, his career and physique declined until he resigned the position in 1936; he retired altogether in 1939, by which time <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>drinking</b> heavily.|$|E

5000|$|So as it {{was applied}} here, the {{statement}} [...] "if <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>drinking,</b> everyone <b>is</b> drinking" [...] was taken to be correct in one case, if everyone <b>was</b> <b>drinking,</b> {{and in the other}} case, if <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not <b>drinking</b> — even though his drinking may not have {{had anything to do with}} anyone else's drinking.|$|R

25|$|Jie {{was also}} a known alcoholic, {{but he did not}} drink regular wine. He drank a type of pure alcohol wine (清醇). The people working for him who could not supply this drink were killed. Many people died because of this. And while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>drinking</b> wine it was {{required}} that he ride on someone’s back like a horse.|$|E
25|$|Some {{who were}} with Mantz during the shoot dispute {{that he was}} flying under the influence, {{although}} they acknowledge <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>drinking</b> alcohol {{the night before the}} fatal flight. Toxicology tests were performed several hours after the accident; in the absence of refrigeration, normal postmortem biochemical processes might produce blood ethanol and cause or contribute to an elevated BAC level.|$|E
25|$|Never Better {{is about}} Keith Merchant (Mangan), a {{recovering}} alcoholic in his mid-thirties whose life {{never seems to}} get better. His problems come from him being self-centred and preoccupied with his own flaws. He attends Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, but his behaviour often turns meetings into a farce, to the annoyance of group leader Doug (Christopher Fairbank). He has a family, with his wife Anita (Ashfield) and two children, Tom and Poppy. Whilst he attempts {{to be a good}} husband and father, his optimism for his family and attempts {{to do the right thing}} tend to lead to even more problems. Outside of AA, he has his friend Richard (Tom Goodman-Hill) for support, although Richard believes that Keith was a better friend when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>drinking.</b>|$|E
500|$|Gavin Hood has {{announced}} that multiple [...] "secret endings" [...] exist for the film and that the endings will differ from print to print of the film. One version shows Wolverine drinking in a Japanese bar. The bartender asks if <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>drinking</b> to forget, to which Logan replies that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>drinking</b> to remember. The other ending shows Weapon XI on {{the rubble of the}} destroyed tower, trying to touch his severed head.|$|R

When the cigar [...] "went off", all four guards drew their guns and aimed at Hemingway. He apparently escaped without any grievous bodily injury.|$|E
500|$|Bradfield has {{described}} the recording of the album as preventing him from having a social life and Alex Silva attributes the break-up {{of his relationship with}} his girlfriend at the time to the long hours involved in the recording. Guitarist Richey Edwards attended recording sessions but would, according to Wire, [...] "collapse on the settee and have a snooze" [...] while the other band members did all the recording. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>drinking</b> heavily and frequently crying. [...] "Inevitably", says Bradfield, [...] "the day would start with a 'schhht!'; the sound of a can opening." ...|$|E
500|$|Wanda {{returns home}} and the men cross Persia and Afghanistan, driving through Herat to Kandahar and Kabul. They had driven 5,000 miles (8,000 km) in a month. There are comic touches, as when [...] "The {{proprietor}} Abdul, a broken-toothed demon of a man, conceived a violent passion for Hugh. We sat with him drinking coffee... 'Arrrh, CAHARLESS, soul of your father. You have ill-used your motor-car.'

500|$|During this period, Ochs {{was taking}} drugs {{to get through}} performances. He had been taking Valium for years to help control his nerves, {{and he was also}} {{drinking}} heavily. Pianist Lincoln Mayorga said of that period, [...] "He was physically abusing himself very badly on that tour. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>drinking</b> a lot of wine and taking uppers. The wine was pulling him one way and the uppers were pulling him another way, and he was kind of a mess. There were so many pharmaceuticals around—so many pills. I'd never seen anything like that." [...] Ochs tried to cut back on the pills, but alcohol remained his drug of choice {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
500|$|The {{group were}} not sociable with reporters, and {{according}} to the book Morrison's drinking habits made him reclusive. [...] "I regret that we couldn't have controlled Morrison better... I think he would have been big if he'd been straightened out {{at the beginning of his}} career," [...] comments Phil Solomon about Morrison. [...] "He was on a downer and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>drinking.</b> He wasn't the most bankable of artists. He had been the frontman for another of those R & B bands that had gone up the Swanee and there were three or four versions of Them touring. It was a joke. He was no gift. There weren't record companies falling over themselves to sign him up." [...] says Phil Coulter in the book.|$|E
500|$|For the Zoo TV Tour, U2 {{embraced the}} [...] "rock star" [...] {{identity}} they had struggled with and {{were reluctant to}} accept throughout the 1980s. They drew the attention of celebrities, including American presidential candidate Bill Clinton, and they began partying more than {{they had in the}} past. During parts of the tour, the band attracted the fashion crowd; Clayton's romantic relationship with supermodel Naomi Campbell and Bono's friendship with supermodel Christy Turlington made them the subjects of unwanted tabloid attention. By the [...] "Zoomerang" [...] leg, Clayton's relationship with Campbell was fracturing and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>drinking</b> frequently. After missing the group's 26 November 1993 show in Sydney from an alcoholic blackout, Clayton quit drinking altogether. The incident resulted in tensions within the group in the tour's final weeks. The Edge began dating the belly dancer Morleigh Steinberg during the tour, and the two later married in 2002.|$|E

500|$|Bacon {{said that}} chance played a {{significant}} role in his work, and that he often approached a canvas without having a clear idea of what might emerge. This was especially the case in the mid- to late 1940s, a period when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>drinking</b> heavily and spending most nights in Soho casinos and poker rooms. The following morning he would often approach his canvas [...] "in a bad mood of drinking... under tremendous hangovers and drink; I sometimes hardly knew what I was doing." [...] He incorporated his appetite for chance into his work: an image often would morph midway through into something quite different from what he had first intended. He actively sought out this freedom and felt it crucial to his progression as an artist. To him, lifestyle and art were intertwined; he said that [...] "perhaps the drink helped me to be a bit freer." [...] This is very evident in the 1949 series, which began as a rather morbid study of a collapsed head, but evolved over the six surviving panels into a reworking of Velázquez masterpieces, and arrived at an image that was to preoccupy Bacon for the subsequent 20 years.|$|E
500|$|Compounding the {{pressure}} during what Harrison himself would {{refer to as}} [...] "the naughty period, 1973–74", <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>drinking</b> heavily and had returned to his drug-taking ways of the 1960s. Some of Harrison's biographers suggest that this abandoning of the [...] "semi-ascetic" [...] path espoused on his 1973 album Living in the Material World was Harrison's reaction to the media's sniping, particularly in Britain, at the pious content of that album, {{as well as a}} reflection of Harrison's despondency over the failure of his first marriage. These two issues informed the lyrics to a new Harrison song, [...] "Dark Horse". Friend and confidant Klaus Voormann has described this time as an obvious [...] "step back" [...] on Harrison's spiritual journey, while Boyd would later write: [...] "That whole period was insane. Friar Park was a madhouse. Our lives were fuelled by alcohol and cocaine, and so it was with everyone who came into our sphere... George used cocaine excessively and I think it changed him." [...] Harrison addressed this behaviour in [...] "Simply Shady" [...] and laid out his feelings on the couple's inevitable split in [...] "So Sad".|$|E
500|$|The stage's early {{breakaway}} {{was formed}} of six riders: Alex Howes (Cannondale-Garmin), Iljo Keisse (Etixx-Quick-Step), Jimmy Engoulvent (Europcar), Tom Van Asbroeck (LottoNL-Jumbo), Jasper De Buyst (Lotto-Soudal), and Ángel Madrazo (Colombia). They built a lead of nearly five minutes, but Giant-Alpecin and Tinkoff-Saxo controlled their advantage throughout. The first major incident {{of the day}} was a crash that came [...] from the finish line, as the peloton approached the first of the day's climbs. This involved more than twenty riders. Four riders were forced to withdraw from the race: Tejay van Garderen (BMC), Dan Martin (Cannondale-Garmin), Kris Boeckmans (Lotto-Soudal) and Nacer Bouhanni (Cofidis). Van Garderen suffered a broken shoulder and Martin a broken clavicle. Boeckmans had been at the origin of the crash: <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>drinking</b> from a bidon when he hit a hole in the road and fell hard to the ground. He suffered a range of injuries, including facial trauma and fractures, a concussion, broken ribs and a pneumothorax; he was taken to hospital and placed in an induced coma. He remained in the coma for over a week; he left hospital several weeks later following major facial surgery. Among the other riders delayed in the crash were Chaves, the race leader, and Jasper Stuyven (...) [...]|$|E
5000|$|Functions of {{auxiliaries}} - Learners of English tend to find {{it difficult}} to manipulate the various ways in which English uses auxiliary verbs. These include negation (e.g. <b>He</b> hasn't <b>been</b> <b>drinking.),</b> inversion with the subject to form a question (e.g. Has <b>he</b> <b>been</b> <b>drinking?),</b> short answers (e.g. Yes, he has.) and tag questions (has he?). A further complication is that the dummy auxiliary verb do/does/did is added to fulfil these functions in the simple present and simple past, but not to replace the verb to <b>be</b> (<b>He</b> drinks too much./Does <b>he?</b> but <b>He</b> <b>is</b> an addict/Is <b>he?).</b>|$|R

500|$|Rodgers and Hammerstein, despite {{extraordinary}} early successes, such as Oklahoma!, Carousel and South Pacific, {{had suffered}} back-to-back Broadway flops {{in the mid-1950s}} with Me and Juliet and Pipe Dream. [...] While Oklahoma! had broken new ground in 1943, any new project in the late 1950s would {{have to compete with}} modern musicals and techniques, like the brutal realism in West Side Story, and with other Broadway musical hits such as The Music Man, My Fair Lady and The Pajama Game. [...] Rodgers and Hammerstein had made it their rule to begin work on their next musical as soon as the last opened on Broadway, but by the start of 1957, six months after Pipe Dream closed, the pair had no new stage musical in prospect. [...] They had, however, been working since 1956 on the popular television version of Cinderella, which was broadcast on CBS on March 31, 1957. [...] Rodgers was still recovering from an operation for cancer in a tooth socket, and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>drinking</b> heavily and suffering from depression. [...] In June 1957, Rodgers checked himself into Payne Whitney Psychiatric Clinic, and he remained there for twelve weeks. [...] According to his daughters, Mary and Linda, this did not put a stop to his drinking.|$|E
500|$|His {{plans to}} become a soldier died after a legal battle {{concerning}} his estate, in which he consulted John Glanville. Glanville successfully persuaded Hale {{to become a}} lawyer, and, after leaving Oxford {{at the age of}} 20 before obtaining a degree, he joined Lincoln's Inn on 8 November 1628. Fearing that the theatre might dissuade him from his legal studies as it had at Oxford, he swore [...] "never to see a stage-play again". At around this time <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>drinking</b> with a group of friends when one of them became so drunk he fainted; Hale prayed to God to forgive and save his friend, and forgive him for his previous excesses. His friend recovered, and Hale was restored to his Puritan faith, never drinking to someone's health again (not even drinking to the King) and going to church every Sunday for 36 years. He instead settled into his studies, working for up to 16 hours a day during his first two years at Lincoln's Inn before reducing it to eight hours due to health concerns. As well as reading the law reports and statutes, Hale also studied the Roman civil law and jurisprudence. Outside of the law, Hale studied anatomy, history, philosophy and mathematics. He refused to read the news or attend social events, and occupied himself entirely with his studies and visits to church.|$|E
500|$|Skelton was {{delivering}} {{an intense}} performance live each week, and the strain showed in physical illness. [...] In 1952, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>drinking</b> heavily from the constant pain of a diaphragmatic hernia and marital problems; {{he thought about}} divorcing Georgia. NBC agreed to film his shows in the 1952–1953 season at Eagle Lion Studios, next to the Sam Goldwyn Studio, on Santa Monica Boulevard in Hollywood. Later the show {{was moved to the}} new NBC television studios in Burbank. Procter & Gamble was unhappy with the filming of the television show, and insisted that Skelton return to live broadcasts. The situation caused him to think about leaving television at that point. Declining ratings prompted sponsor Procter & Gamble to cancel his show in the spring of 1953, with Skelton announcing that any future television shows of his would be variety shows, where he would not have the almost constant burden of performing. Beginning with the 1953–1954 season, he switched to CBS, where he remained until 1970. For the initial move to CBS, he had no sponsor. The network gambled by covering all expenses for the program on a sustaining basis; his first CBS sponsor was Geritol. He curtailed his drinking and his ratings at CBS began to improve, especially after he began appearing on Tuesday nights for co-sponsors Johnson's Wax and Pet Milk Company.|$|E
