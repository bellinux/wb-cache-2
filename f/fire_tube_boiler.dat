These boilers are used in different industries such as power plants, paper, and chemical. The present paper reports various problems (such as agglomeration, slagging, fouling, caustic embrittlement, fatigue failure and high temperature corrosion) related to boilers and their possible solutions. Some of the controlling parameters for high temperature corrosion has also been studied viz use of inhibitors, varying temperature and pressure, sol–gel coating and thermal spray coating. Thermal spraying {{has emerged as a}} main tool for improvement in surface. Problem of corrosion, wear resistance, electrical or thermal insulation can be altered using different coating techniques and materials. Deposition of ash in biomass-fired boilers also causes severe problems of agglomeration. The problem of agglomeration can be solved using kaolin or NH 3 in the bed of boilers. Some important processes such as pulse detonation wave technology, intelligent soot blower, chemical treatment technology can be used to minimize the effects of fouling.|$|R
50|$|Package boilers are {{commonly}} called water or fire tube Boilers. Water tube boilers use convection heating, which draws {{the heat from}} the fire source, and passes against the generating tubes of the boiler, causing water inside those tubes to boil off into steam. The <b>fire</b> <b>tube</b> <b>boiler</b> arrangement utilizes conduction heating which transfers heat from physical contact. Fire tube boilers are not commonly used due to their method of conduction heating because pipes in direct contact with fire and cold water could damage the pipes. The package boiler is usually a two or three-pass fire-tube boiler with an internal furnace tube. This is similar to the much earlier Scotch boiler.|$|E

The heat could be generated from several kinds of fuels, such as natural gas, oil,and coal through a combustion process. In a combustion chamber, heat is transferred to the water through several pipes. The pipes could be for water flow or heat flow.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{technical}} and economic feasibility of the installation of an innovative thermal concentrating solar system (TCSS) for high pressure steam production in a dairy is discussed.

The steam is produced in natural gas <b>fired</b> <b>tube</b> <b>boilers</b> and is evidently lost and make-up fresh treated water at atmospheric conditions is required. In this context, the installation of a TCSS based on the technology of the linear Fresnel concentrating systems is proposed to provide part of the required steam and, consequently, to reduce the consumption of the fossil fuel improving the process environmental performances. To this purpose, the piping integration {{of the new system}} in the original one has been analyzed in detail respecting the essential safety requirements in accordance with the guidelines of the Pressurized Equipment Directive (PED) and maintaining the required service level to the thermal end-user. In order to assure a satisfying exploitation of the solar power source, the adoption of a storage system based on a pressurized vessel containing a mixture of water and steam has been considered and optimized from a technical and economic point of view. Indeed, the dairy production is scheduled only during six hours in the morning per day. This particular thermal load profile makes difficult the integration with the not programmable solar power source with peaks during the median hours of the day. Particular attention has been dedicated to the operative behavior of the integrated system defining suitable control rules thanks to the installation of valves and sensors. Beside the technical analysis, an economic assessment has demonstrated the profitability of the thermal plant modification, that assures a substantial improvement of the overall energy efficiency of the production process...|$|R
