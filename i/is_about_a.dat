5|$|A UTI affects {{parts of}} the urinary system {{including}} the urethra, bladder, and kidneys. There <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> one percent risk of UTIs in boys under two years of age, {{and the majority of}} incidents occur {{in the first year of}} life. There is good but not ideal evidence that circumcision of babies reduces the incidence of UTIs in boys under two years of age, and there is fair evidence that the reduction in incidence is by a factor of 310 times (100 circumcisions prevents one UTI). Prevention of UTIs does not justify routine use of the procedure, however. Circumcision is most likely to benefit boys who have a high risk of UTIs due to anatomical defects, and may be used to treat recurrent UTIs.|$|E
5|$|Despite its {{relative}} brightness (it <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> fifth {{as bright as}} Pluto), Makemake was not discovered until after many much fainter Kuiper belt objects.

It probably escaped detection during the earlier surveys due to {{its relative}}ly high orbital inclination, {{and the fact that}} it was at its farthest distance from the ecliptic at the time of its discovery, in the northern constellation of Coma Berenices.|$|E
