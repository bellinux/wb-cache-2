40|$|Interference {{alignment}} (IA) is {{a linear}} precoding strategy that can achieve optimal capacity scaling at high SNR in interference networks. However, most existing IA designs require full channel state information (CSI) at the transmitters, {{which could lead}} to significant CSI signaling overhead. There are two techniques, namely CSI quantization and CSI <b>feedback</b> <b>filtering,</b> that reduce CSI feedback overhead. In this paper, we consider IA processing with CSI <b>feedback</b> <b>filtering</b> in MIMO cellular networks. We introduce a novel metric, namely the feedback dimension, to quantify the first order CSI feedback cost associated with the CSI <b>feedback</b> <b>filtering.</b> The CSI <b>feedback</b> <b>filtering</b> poses several important challenges in IA processing. First, there is a hidden partial CSI knowledge constraint in IA precoder design, which cannot be handled using conventional IA design methodology. Furthermore, existing results on the feasibility conditions of IA cannot be applied due to the partial CSI knowledge. Finally, it is very challenging to find out how much CSI feedback is actually needed to support IA processing. We shall address the above challenges and propose a new IA feasibility condition under partial CSIT knowledge in MIMO cellular networks. Based on this, we consider the CSI feedback dimension minimization subject to the degrees of freedom requirements, and further propose an asymptotically optimal solution and derive closed-form trade-off results between the CSI feedback cost and IA performance in MIMO cellular networks...|$|R

40|$|Abstract-A {{decision}} feedback equalizer (DFE) {{containing a}} <b>feedback</b> <b>filter</b> with both poles and zeroes is proposed for high-speed digital communications over the subscriber loop. The <b>feedback</b> <b>filter</b> {{is composed of}} two sections: a relatively short finite impulse response (FIR) filter that cancels the initial part of the channel impulse response, which may contain rapid vari-ations due to bridge taps; and a pole-zero, or IIR, filter that cancels the smoothly decaying tail of the impulse response. Modifications of an existing adaptive IIR algorithm, based on the Steiglitz-McBride identification scheme, are proposed to adapt the <b>feedback</b> <b>filter.</b> These new algorithms have compa-rable complexity to gradient-based adaptive IIR algorithms {{when the number of}} poles is small, but converge significantly faster.

40|$|Abstract − This paper {{introduces}} an algorithm {{for blind}} adaptation of decision feedback equalizers (DFE), which is applied for equalization in the passband domain. The transmission scheme, which {{is assumed to}} be unknown at the receiver side, can either be carrierless amplitude/phase (CAP) modulation or quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). As the input signal of the passband equalizer is real-valued, the tap weights of the complexvalued <b>feedback</b> <b>filter</b> cannot be identified by a standard whitening approach. We propose therefore an algorithm, which determines a starting coefficient set by means of an infinite impulse response (IIR) equalizer updated by constant modulus algorithm (CMA). For stability reasons, the equalizer’s <b>feedback</b> <b>filter</b> is implemented in lattice structure during acquisition. In case of QAM transmission, its tap weights have to be rotated before switching to the DFE.

It was recently shown that exponential accuracy of the form O(2 ^-rλ) can be achieved by appropriate one-bit Sigma-Delta modulation schemes. By general information-entropy arguments r must be less than 1. The current best known value for r is approximately 0. 088.

From these relaxed solutions, we find asymptotically optimal solutions of the original problem, which improve the best known exponential error decay rate to r ≈ 0. 102.
