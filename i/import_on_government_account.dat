The paper reveals {{the significance of the}} principle of intergenerational equity and the influence of user groups in the development of accounting policy in local government. It suggests that both preparers and users of accounting information were influential in a debate <b>on</b> <b>government</b> <b>accounting</b> policy which took place in Wellington, New Zealand, during the early twentieth century. It is shown that the principle of intergenerational equity was accorded high importance in the debate but was subject to challenge.

He then sent his first lieutenant, George Downie, and other men of his crew in a cutter to board the vessels. Covered by the fire of the Seahorse, Downie boarded a Spanish brig, laden with 1170 quintals of powder.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{cost and}} management accounting {{reforms in the}} UK central government. It provides a historical context to the subsequent reform fervour associated with New Public Management (NPM) (Hood, 1995) and offers some explanations for the underdeveloped state of accounting up to the mid 1970 s. It suggests that the perceived ‘failure’ of the Army Costing Experiment restrained the development of cost accounting, both before, and after, the Second World War and it was, instead, the Treasury inspired Organisation and Method techniques that became dominant (Walkland and Hicks, NAUK, T 316 / 2; Agar, 2003). This continued into the early 1950 s with the influential Crick report <b>on</b> <b>government</b> <b>accounting</b> promoting the status quo rather than accounting change. The marked change in political, economic and social forces in the late 1950 s (Theakston, 1995 : p. 84), coupled with the introduction of Programme Planning Budgeting Systems (PPBS) in the United States fuelled a renewed interest in the measurement of outputs and management accounting information (Cook, 1986). This was followed by limited institutional change, with the introduction of a Management Accounting Unit at the Treasury. But the failure of PPBS in the USA, together with reservations within the civil service and the Fulton Report’s (1968) call for responsible management, all contributed to the rejection of <b>government</b> <b>accounting</b> along programme lines and led instead to the selective investigation of government expenditure (Gray and Jenkins, 1982; Heclo and Wildavsky, 1981). These investigations owed more to Organisation and Methods than accounting, but it would be the dormant accounting technologies, debated in the 1960 s, that would eventually reappear as NPM.

Design/methodology/approach – The study used a self?administered questionnaire to survey 120 staff and stakeholders of the Ministry of the Water and Environment. Correlation analysis was employed to determine the association between accounting standards, legal framework and the quality of financial reporting. Findings – Results indicate that accounting standards and legal framework are all positively and significantly associated with the quality of financial reporting, providing evidence of the effect of accounting standards and legal framework on the quality of financial reporting in Uganda Research limitations/implications – Scarce literature using African data means that it is not possible to compare the findings to previous research. Practical implications – The finding of an association between accounting standards, the legal framework and quality of financial reporting implies that the government of Uganda needs to adopt a more robust approach in enforcing compliance to improve the quality of financial reports produced by the Ministry of Water and Environment.

(2009) is {{used to evaluate the}} impacts of the international crisis on the South African economy. However, we have changed some assumptions in order to better represent South African specificities. A major innovation in this regard is the modelling of unemployment and the influence of labour unions on the labour market. Two scenarios encompassing a severe and moderate recession are run. The effects of the crisis on the economy are really quite harsh, even in the moderate recession scenario, both in the short run and the long run. Indeed, the decrease of world prices combined with the drop of world demand lead to a decrease in production for many sectors with consequent laying off of workers. The impact on institutions is also worrying: agents see their income as well as their savings decreasing. The huge drop in firms’ savings has a dire impact on total investment while the huge negative impact <b>on</b> <b>government</b> <b>accounts</b> of protracted slow global growth imply tight public budgets for some time to come. Thus, some gains made by the government prior to the crisis may have been reversed by the economic crisis.
