Macroeconomic causes encouraged widespread child labour across the world, over most of human history. They suggest that the causes for child labour include both the demand and the supply side. While poverty and unavailability of good schools explain the child labour supply side, they suggest that the growth of low-paying informal economy rather than higher paying <b>formal</b> <b>economy</b> is amongst the causes of the demand side. Other scholars too suggest that inflexible labour market, sise of informal economy, inability of industries to scale up and lack of modern manufacturing technologies are major macroeconomic factors affecting demand and acceptability of child labour.|$|E
25|$|Similar to {{the ratio}} of female to male workers {{in the labor force}} is the {{percentage}} of the actual labor force composed of women. This differs from the labor force participation rate of women because it shows female workers {{as a percentage of the}} total number of workers in the economy as opposed to the percentage of the population of women that are involved in the <b>formal</b> <b>economy.</b> A large female labor force participation rate does not necessarily correlate to a substantial percentage of females in the labor force. However, a high female labor force participation rate demonstrates high economic participation by women in a country regardless of the size of the labor market itself that these women compose. Demographics, particularly birth rates, and human capital formation through education, good nutrition, and access to infrastructure and institutions may play a role in the discrepancies between these indicators.|$|E

30|$|Second, {{interdisciplinary}} concepts, {{grounded in}} the spatial and temporal characteristic of social connectivity and its evolution as a complex adaptive system may {{hold the key to}} answering this question. Development is first and foremost the open-ended process of gaining social and economic access to a society at large. For example, recent ethnographic studies in sociology, especially in Latin America (Holston [2008]), have emphasized how new urban migrants living in informal settlements have gradually strived for services and citizenship rights and responsibilities. As a result, large, poor and marginalized fractions of urban populations joined their civic society and <b>formal</b> <b>economies,</b> and gradually raised their socioeconomic status and that of their communities. These processes connect the aggregation of information in human societies to scale, innovation and economic growth (Hayek [1945]; Arrow [1962]; Holston [2008]; Bettencourt et al. [2012]).|$|R

2500|$|Many slums [...] grow {{because of}} growing {{informal}} economy which creates demand for workers. Informal economy {{is that part}} of an economy that is neither registered as a business nor licensed, one that does not pay taxes and is not monitored by local or state or federal government. Informal economy grows faster than <b>formal</b> <b>economy</b> when government laws and regulations are opaque and excessive, government bureaucracy is corrupt and abusive of entrepreneurs, labor laws are inflexible, or when law enforcement is poor. Urban informal sector is between 20 and 60% of most developing economies' GDP; in Kenya, 78 per cent of non-agricultural employment is in the informal sector making up 42 per cent of GDP. In many cities the informal sector accounts for as much as 60 per cent of employment of the urban population. For example, in Benin, slum dwellers comprise 75 per cent of informal sector workers, while in Burkina Faso, the Central African Republic, Chad and Ethiopia, they make up 90 per cent of the informal labour force. Slums thus create an informal alternate economic ecosystem, that demands low paid flexible workers, something impoverished residents of slums deliver. In other words, countries where starting, registering and running a formal business is difficult, tend to encourage informal businesses and slums. Without a sustainable <b>formal</b> <b>economy</b> that raise incomes and create opportunities, squalid slums are likely to continue.|$|E
