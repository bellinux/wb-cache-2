30|$|This {{paper is}} a first step towards {{understanding}} how agents respond to the Spanish <b>insolvency</b> <b>framework</b> and their implications for the real economy. Further work is required in two directions. First, better data without the limitations of our sample, especially regarding information on mortgage loans and the alternative procedures to formal bankruptcy, could be collected. Second, the impact of the low efficiency of the bankruptcy system vis-à-vis mortgage foreclosures on the performance of Spanish firms should be empirically analyzed.|$|E

40|$|The {{enactment}} of China's bankruptcy laws in 2006 {{was a necessary}} step {{in the development of}} its economy. This law represented a significant modernisation of the <b>insolvency</b> <b>framework,</b> supporting the transforming economy, {{but it was also a}} law of political expediency, for the enhancement of external relations. One aspect of the enhancement of external relations was the provision of cross-border insolvency rules. However this complex area of law was addressed in only one article, which was only a starting point, leaving many details unaddressed, and further reforms are required. In particular, it is desirable that the law provides a greater level of predictability as to the likely outcomes of cross-border insolvencies, to encourage inward trade and investment, as well as encourage external trade. Both inbound and outbound business dealings are important to China's continued economic development. It is clear also, however, that insolvency law and practice is still a developing area for China. The establishment of a modern and unified system of insolvency laws was a big step for China, representing a sacrifice of tight controls on insolvencies, but the impact of this law in practice is only recently developing, with a loosening of state controls, after a very slow start. The establishment of a cross-border <b>insolvency</b> <b>framework</b> represents a further challenge; one that is likely to beset with considerable difficulties, as any further development of this law would potentially entail some further loss of control over proceedings, not least in outbound cases, and resistance may be anticipated. In keeping with China’s historical approach to law-making in the area of bankruptcy law, it is likely that the cross-border <b>insolvency</b> <b>framework</b> will develop gradually and with caution. This article assesses the way forward in respect of cross-border insolvency laws, contending that an incremental approach over a period of years, in three broad stages, is required, with more developed and country specific approaches providing a link, or interim stage, between the clarification of the Article 5 and the formal adoption of the UNCITRAL Model Law in China...|$|E
30|$|In {{this section}} we {{will focus on}} the {{features}} of the <b>insolvency</b> <b>frameworks</b> of Spain, France and the UK related to our hypothesis, namely, the choice between bankruptcy procedures and mortgage foreclosures and the choice of firms’ capital and asset structures. We will examine the incentives to file for bankruptcy of both the debtor firm and its creditors, as alternative procedures such as mortgage foreclosures can only take place if both parties refrain from filing. For a more thorough analysis of the <b>insolvency</b> <b>frameworks</b> see Celentani et al. (2010, 2012) and Davydenko and Franks (2008).|$|R
40|$|There {{are four}} {{distinct}} areas where harmonising national <b>insolvency</b> <b>frameworks</b> could improve {{the functioning of}} the single market and the stability of the euro area. Early restructuring of businesses, bank resolution, cross-border insolvency and management of non-performing loans rely on common features of local <b>insolvency</b> <b>frameworks,</b> which can affect their legal certainty and operation. To promote a more entrepreneurial spirit, a pan-European framework for the early restructuring of businesses could offer a true second chance for entrepreneurs. To benefit from a capital markets union, <b>insolvency</b> <b>frameworks</b> would also need to remove sources of cost unpredictability in cross-border insolvency procedures, which are often hidden in national insolvency laws or are not sufficiently dealt with in the current EU framework. Moreover, measures to harmonise insolvency laws could have positive impacts on the banking union, and particularly those harmonising the hierarchies of claims could strengthen {{the functioning of the}} resolution mechanism. The diffusion of best practices in credit recovery procedures could help to improve the management of non-performing loans by fostering liquidity in secondary markets. In addition, this report contributes to defining areas for further action, such as the opening and governance of proceedings and reliefs...|$|R
40|$|It is not {{surprising}} that the problems of choice of law and international group insolvency have not been sufficiently addressed during the initial development of cross-border <b>insolvency</b> <b>frameworks.</b> The choice of law problem raises difficult questions and affects substantive rights in the context of cross-border insolvency. International group enterprises come about in different legal and operational structures, requiring a sufficiently nuanced regime that could properly accommodate the diverse types of groups. Generally, the regulation of groups is difficult, as it raises a concern of defeating the economic merits of the corporate form. Addressing the combined problem of international groups and choice of law presents significant challenges, and requires careful analysis of economic structures and their implications on both creditors’ expectations regarding their substantive rights and the ability to achieve efficient solutions in insolvency. This Article aims to provide a roadmap of choice of law solutions in international enterprise group cases, and to compare these solutions with the existing cross-border insolvency practice and the cross-border <b>insolvency</b> <b>frameworks...</b>|$|R
40|$|The recent {{financial}} crisis {{has shown that}} national frameworks have been insufficient to stem the cross-border effects {{of the failure of}} a systemically important financial institution. This paper refers to the challenges for governments, {{in the aftermath of the}} {{financial crisis}} starting in 2007 / 2008, to provide stability in financial markets and the role of financial institutions for national economies and on a global scale. It discusses the need for coordinated action to resolve SIFIs by evaluating the regional approaches in Europe and the US, as well as considering the recommendations of four international bodies on the insolvency of large and complex financial institutions: the Financial Stability Board, the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law, the International Monetary Fund and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. The paper argues that key implications need to be recognized in order to make a global cross-border <b>insolvency</b> <b>framework</b> work effectively to coordinate around another Lehman-like event. It concludes that much has been discussed and initiated in the last six years, however, many issues are still unsolved. While single measures with a regional character are fit and comprehensible as a starting point, the pursued goal should be a mandatory and internationally consistent, homogenous cross-border <b>insolvency</b> <b>framework</b> since the interconnectedness of global financial institutions and their importance for financial stability will make it very difficult to prevent the next crisis and its disruptive impact...|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} test this {{hypothesis}} the optimal identification strategy would be to analyse the impact of substantial changes in the Spanish bankruptcy law in both bankruptcy rates and firms’ capital structure. The current bankruptcy code entered into force in 2004 after a major legislative reform. But it seems that the de facto <b>insolvency</b> <b>framework</b> barely changed because the performance of bankruptcy proceedings did not seem to substantially improve (Gutiérrez 2005; Van Hemmen 2004), bankruptcy rates did not increase after the introduction of the new code and it seems that firms’ capital and asset structures have not changed either (Celentani et al. 2010).|$|E
40|$|Politicians {{as well as}} {{many members}} of the {{international}} human-rights community, view the odious debt doctrine as fundamentally unfair that the Iraqi people may be saddled with the debts Saddam Hussein 2 ̆ 7 s brutal regime incurred. Furthermore, some in the human-rights community generally argue that rich (creditor) countries have a moral duty or obligation to protect citizens of poor (debtor) countries and that richer nations should forgive the debts of poorer nations to help reduce existing inequalities between developed and developing countries. Here, Dickerson evaluates the doctrine of odious debts using the <b>insolvency</b> <b>framework</b> found in the United States Bankruptcy Code...|$|E
30|$|To {{test this}} {{hypothesis}} our identification strategy relies on cross-country comparisons. Specifically, we compare the observed choices (choice of capital structure, choice between bankruptcy and mortgage) of Spanish firms {{with those of}} firms from countries where their bankruptcy systems are more efficient and their laws do not incentivise them to bias their capital structure towards mortgage loans. France and the UK are chosen as the comparison group because their bankruptcy rates are {{much higher than the}} Spanish ones and because of the specific features of their <b>insolvency</b> <b>frameworks.</b>|$|R

This paper examines the forum shopping phenomenon from a new perspective, that of directors’ duties in times of financial trouble, specifically in light of emerging international standards in this area. This method allows unearthing the degree to which forum shopping is legitimate. This paper also shows how the directors’ duties regime is better fit to deal with illegitimate forum shopping compared with cross-border <b>insolvency</b> <b>frameworks...</b>|$|R

40|$|PhDThe {{ongoing process}} of {{globalisation}} has witnessed {{an increase in}} cross-border corporate insolvencies involving multinational enterprises (MNEs). Yet, national insolvency laws have proven themselves ill-equipped to handle such matters in an international setting. Responsible policy-makers and academics argue {{for the creation of}} a viable international insolvency approach. This debate has revolved around an "either-or" spectrum of (1) the theory of "Universality" that proposes a single court charged with implementing a single bankruptcy law to worldwide claimants, and (2) the theory of "Territoriality" that asserts each jurisdiction can only adjudicate the debtor's insolvency on a territorial basis and distribute local assets to local claimants. But, this debate yet has yielded no practical solution. This thesis suggests that these two theories are not mutually exclusive, and both may be utilized in developing a pragmatic and "better" international <b>insolvency</b> <b>framework.</b> To date, there has been one non-binding international instrument based on moderate choice of forum/law provisions: the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency (the Model Law). Although the Model Law has significant merits, it falls short of the broader expectations minimally acceptable international insolvency system should fulfill. In addition, the regional European Union Council Regulation on Insolvency Proceedings (the Regulation) has recently been enacted. This thesis will argue that, while recognizing the special sui generic nature of the EU framework, important lessons can be learned from this Regulation, and when combined with certain elements from a revamped Model Law approach, a "better" international <b>insolvency</b> <b>framework</b> may be found. The concluding observations of this thesis will touch upon a range of existing international vehicles that may be complementary or alternative vehicles to channel interim reforms.

40|$|Although a {{substantial}} {{body of literature}} has developed {{in recent years in}} the area of cross-border insolvency, this scholarship has been dominated by scholars from the United States and Europe, so that a perspective from most of Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries is lacking. This study addresses this perspective. It makes an in-depth examination and discussion of the challenges that SSA countries face in reform and application of cross-border insolvency law given the ever-growing multinational trade and investment. The study focuses on the risk of failure of SSA legislative processes to properly address the potential challenges of cross-border insolvencies {{in a manner that is}} sensitive to the local contexts and which provides a balance with international insolvency benchmarks. It examines cross-border insolvency theories; the global drivers for convergence of insolvency law through global insolvency norms; and the implications for cross-border insolvency regulations arising from cross-border trade and investment arrangements, such as the bilateral investment treaties, before considering the state and future of the legislative frameworks of SSA countries. It then brings out the ‘pressures’ exerted on and issues that emerge in the consideration and quest for crafting a workable and appropriate cross-border <b>insolvency</b> <b>framework</b> for a SSA country. Notably, the current insights and the pressures from the global convergence may result in unsuitable legislative reforms as such insights and the global insolvency norms are not necessarily and directly relevant to SSA situations. The study offers the perspective that has hitherto been lacking in the current scholarship and provides a theoretical insight and understanding on how the crafting of a workable and appropriate legislative framework may be undertaken, taking account of local policies and providing a balance with the existing international insolvency benchmarks. The study underscores the significance and challenge of prioritising the local contexts in developing a functional cross-border <b>insolvency</b> <b>framework...</b>|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} makes {{a comprehensive}} review of insolvency laws and reforms in the selected jurisdictions namely Kenya, the UK and Mauritius with a view of understanding how Kenya can benefit from the experience of others. The main aim is to evaluate whether Kenyan in-solvency laws supports modern businesses and to consider what, if any, legal reforms might be desirable to better achieve this end. The study commences from a conceptual approach to the legal concepts of corporate insolvency laws then attempts to understand the justification for the existence and role of insolvency law from a theoretical perspective. It then under-takes an in-depth evaluation of the current Kenyan corporate <b>insolvency</b> <b>framework</b> using international benchmarks; in particular by reference to the UNCITRAL Insolvency legislative guide. The exploration of the Kenyan <b>insolvency</b> <b>framework</b> reveals the underlying weaknesses and underscores the need for reforms. It also investigates whether there are any recognizable informal mechanisms that may enable the weaknesses in the formal mecha-nisms to be overcome. Subsequently, the thesis explores whether Kenya can benefit from the experiences of the UK and Mauritius, who may be regarded as successful reformers. It examines the historical evolution of UK corporate insolvency laws and identifies the driving forces behind the successful reform engagements. This exploration of the wellspring of legal traditions and fundamental principles that underpin corporate insolvency provides great insights. The study attempts to understand the potential problems that frustrate reform efforts in Kenya by identifying the insolvency law reform drivers in Kenya and contrasting the influence of the same drivers in Mauritius. Such a comparison offers a perspective that has been lacking in the current scholarship and reform engagements in Kenya and provides theo-retical insights and understanding on how best Kenya can undertake successful reforms...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the evolution of}} bank funding structures in the run up to the global financial crisis and studies the implications for financial stability, exploiting a bank-level dataset that covers about 11, 000 banks in the U. S. and Europe during 2001 ? 09. The results show that banks with weaker structural liquidity and higher leverage in the pre-crisis period {{were more likely to}} fail afterward. The likelihood of bank failure also increases with bank risk-taking. In the cross-section, the smaller domestically-oriented banks were relatively more vulnerable to liquidity risk, while the large cross-border banks were more susceptible to solvency risk due to excessive leverage. The results support the proposed Basel III regulations on structural liquidity and leverage, but suggest that emphasis should be placed on the latter, particularly for the systemically-important institutions. Macroeconomic and monetary conditions are also shown to be related with the likelihood of bank failure, providing a case for the introduction of a macro-prudential approach to banking regulation.

Unlike existing theories, credit default is treated in this paper by a joint model with dual causal processes of delinquency and <b>insolvency.</b> A <b>framework</b> for developing causal credit default theories is introduced through the example of a new residential mortgage default theory.

40|$|Over {{the past}} several years, the {{international}} community has devoted considerable attention to improving arrangements for resolving financial crises and, in particular, for the restructuring of unsustainable sovereign debt. These efforts have benefited from the active participation of sovereign debtors, market participants, workout professionals, lawyers, economists and the 2 ̆ 2 official sector, 2 ̆ 2 including the International Monetary Fund (2 ̆ 2 IMF 2 ̆ 2). As can be expected, perspectives regarding the dimensions of the problem and the direction of reform have varied. Nevertheless, a consensus appears to have been reached on two broad issues. First, there is a recognition that, in circumstances where a sovereign 2 ̆ 7 s debt has become unsustainable, all stakeholders-the sovereign debtor, its creditors, and the system more generally-will benefit from a restructuring process that is more rapid, orderly, and predictable than is currently the case. Second, it is generally accepted that enhancing the effectiveness of the legal framework is {{critical to the success of}} any meaningful reform in this area. Much of the discussion has focused on whether the necessary strengthening of the legal framework can be achieved exclusively through private contract or, alternatively, requires official intervention, perhaps in the form of the IMF 2 ̆ 7 s proposed 2 ̆ 2 Sovereign Debt Restructuring Mechanism 2 ̆ 2 (2 ̆ 2 SDRM 2 ̆ 2). Market participants have expressed concern that any form of official intervention would undermine the operation of capital markets in this area and, in particular, the quality of emerging market debt as an asset class. In contrast, the premise behind the SDRM has been that official intervention, if appropriately designed, would strengthen rather than weaken the operation of the international financial system. While recognizing the important limits of the analogy, supporters of official intervention have pointed to the critical role that domestic <b>insolvency</b> <b>frameworks</b> play in a market economy.

40|$|A {{corporate}} reorganisation {{system that}} ensures optimal development of distressed companies' assets helps promote economic development. In many developed economies, faltering firms are reorganised through a formal corporate reorganisation procedure. The Hong Kong government has recently recommended {{the enactment of}} such a procedure {{on the assumption that}} the existing corporate and <b>insolvency</b> <b>framework</b> is ill-equipped to restructure failing companies. This book rebuts this assumption through an assessment of the efficiency of the judicially-developed reorganisation system that has emerged as a result of the failure to introduce a formal reorganisation procedure a decade ago. It argues that since an efficient alternative reorganisation system has been locked in for Hong Kong for more than a decade, a purposely-designed reorganisation regime is no longer imperative for this region.

30|$|Another {{characteristic}} of the UK <b>insolvency</b> <b>framework</b> is the existence of floating charges. A floating charge is a security interest over a fund of a firm’s changing assets that “floats” until it “crystallises” (converts) into a fixed charge, 22 {{at which point the}} charge attaches to specific assets. The crystallisation can be triggered by a number of events, being one of them the borrower’s default. There are two main differences between a floating charge and other security interests such as a mortgage. First, because the security “floats”, the firm remains free to purchase and sell its assets. Second, the assets of the entire business can be pledged as collateral. Those characteristics grant high flexibility to the firm’s asset structure and permit it not to be biased through certain types of assets such as land and buildings.|$|E
40|$|Fisk v McIntosh brings {{light to}} {{pertinent}} issues within New Zealand’s voidable transaction regime, an integral {{component of the}} country’s <b>insolvency</b> law <b>framework.</b> The case concerns a payment received by an innocent investor upon exiting a Ponzi scheme. The scheme’s liquidator has claimed {{the entirety of the}} payment as a voidable transaction under the Companies Act 1993. The High Court and Court of Appeal held that the sum of the original investment can be retained, but any profits must be returned. This paper analyses the Courts’ interpretation of the defence provision under the voidable transaction regime and discusses the true meaning of “value” under the Act. The tension between upholding commercial confidence and treating unsecured creditors equally is highlighted. It is argued that courts must give priority to commercial confidence and fairness to individual creditors over a remorseless application of parity-based logic wherever a payment has a preferential effect. It concludes that in order to maintain clarity in New Zealand’s company law and ensure its purpose is upheld, creditors should remain entitled to keep payments received in good faith, for which they provided real and substantial value...|$|R

30|$|Finally, we must {{stress the}} {{importance}} of the research question. The model of García-Posada (2013) predicts that, {{in the context of the}} Spanish <b>insolvency</b> <b>framework,</b> there is a positive relation between bankruptcy rates and welfare. The intuition is that low bankruptcy rates and low welfare are the outcome of an institutional design characterised by the low efficiency and low creditor protection of the bankruptcy system relative to those of an alternative insolvency institution, the mortgage system. In that context, firms and their creditors avoid filing for bankruptcy by heavily relying on mortgage collateral, which can be repossessed and liquidated in the event of default. The problem is that the mortgage system is not well suited for some firms, which need to bias their asset structure to have enough collateral, with the ensuing productive inefficiencies. Those firms would be better off if they had access to a bankruptcy system that worked relatively well. In other words, as the bankruptcy and mortgage systems are imperfect substitutes, the equilibrium in which only mortgage is widely used (reflected in low bankruptcy rates) is Pareto dominated by the equilibrium in which agents can choose between the two insolvency institutions (reflected in higher bankruptcy rates). His analysis also predicts that bankruptcy will be unfeasible for the smallest firms in the economy as long as some of the bankruptcy costs are fixed. As some of those firms will have to overinvest in capital assets to sign their contracts under mortgage, they will incur in productive inefficiencies. If the absence of a well-functioning bankruptcy system for those firms also reduces their growth opportunities—e.g., by hampering access to unsecured lending such as venture capital—then the current <b>insolvency</b> <b>framework</b> may help explain the firm size distribution and the low aggregate productivity of the Spanish economy. This is consistent with the evidence of Fabbri (2010) in Spain, who finds that lengthy bankruptcy procedures decrease firm size and raise funding costs and with that of Ponticelli (2012) in Brazil, who shows that congestion in bankruptcy courts substantially reduces firm-level investment and productivity.|$|E
40|$|The legal {{framework}} for insolvency resolution in India underwent a structural change when the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC) {{was passed in}} May 2016.

30|$|We must {{stress the}} {{importance}} of the research question. Bankruptcy procedures and mortgage foreclosures are not perfect substitutes, and the underutilization of one of them—reflected in low bankruptcy rates—may lead to efficiency losses and lower welfare (García-Posada 2013). The reason is that the mortgage system is not well suited for some firms, which need to bias their asset structure to have enough collateral, with the ensuing productive inefficiencies. Those firms {{would be better off if}} they had access to a bankruptcy system that worked relatively well.

40|$|Conventional wisdom decrees that {{in order}} for {{insurers}} to provide cover, they require capital. One of the many methods of calculating capital requirements of short-term insurers is the <b>insolvency</b> put option <b>framework.</b> This technique was originally introduced by Merton (1977). The general argument is that bankruptcy occurs when shareholders exercise a valuable put option. Indeed, the corporation was introduced to protect shareholders from, mainly contractual, liabilities of persons who trade with the corporation. The corporation thus introduced the idea of limited liability of shareholders or as is often called the corporate veil. However, if a company defaults on its debt then equity holders have decided to allow an embedded call option to expire unexercised. As a result shareholders will behave as if they in fact hold a call option, which creates a different incentive than that suggested by the insolvency put idea. This study examines the role of capital and the influence of the insolvency put option within a short-term insurer. Specifically, it is argued that capital is not the cornerstone of a short-term insurer. Moreover, using Brownian motion and Itō calculus as well as continuous time financial models a more complete mathematical description of an insurance company is articulated by explicitly taking the embedded equity call option into account...|$|R
40|$|International audienceRecent {{years have}} {{witnessed}} a phenomenal upsurge {{in the number}} of corporate bankruptcies. The vulnerabilities which were lying dormant within contemporary bankruptcy regimes suddenly became apparent, causing concerns within the international corporate community.

Since the South African regime has emerged from an international <b>insolvency</b> <b>framework,</b> an international benchmark was used to effectively assist in creating an evaluation tool.

The framework could serve as a guideline for the evaluation of rescue plans and help practitioners to enhance what is seen as their key task, namely to compile the rescue plan. Comparison with the fi ve key principles found by the research reveals particular shortcomings in Chapter 6 of the South African Companies Act of 2008.

40|$|Australia’s {{response}} to international insolvency is the Cross-Border Insolvency Act 2008 (Cth), which implements the UNCITRAL Model Law on CrossBorder Insolvency. The Act {{is designed to}} facilitate international trade and investment by improving the administration of cross-border insolvency cases, including the recovery of assets located overseas. However, the Act is not a comprehensive international insolvency statute. Apart from the ubiquitous and overarching common law and the Cross-Border Insolvency Act, Australian law relevant to cross-border insolvency includes the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) ss 580 – 81, s 583 and s 601 CL (the ancillary liquidation provision). Currently, the procedures overlap in a complex and confusing way, with cases potentially falling through gaps in the law and important provisions being overlooked. The end result for the administration of cross-border insolvency cases is incongruity and inconvenience, with added cost and complication. The {{time has come for}} a rethink and redesign of Australia’s international <b>insolvency</b> <b>framework.</b> The revised framework should include reconceptualisation of the basis for international insolvency cooperation, with incorporation of the Model Law standards as the basic threshold for insolvency assistance and provision for enhanced cooperation and assistance in certain circumstances. The conceptual redesign should also tackle some of the current limitations of the Cross-Border Insolvency Ac...|$|E
40|$|Corporate restructure is pivotal to the {{efficient}} operation of Australia’s economy, including {{the ability for}} companies {{to respond to a}} dynamic macro environment and the productive utilisation of market capital. The ability of a distressed company to effectively and efficiently restructure has significant implications for stakeholders, employment, productivity, enterprise value and the community. The present research attempted to understand {{the ways in which the}} current <b>insolvency</b> <b>framework</b> - and in particular the Part 5. 3 A voluntary administration legislation - is experienced by experts in the field, with a view to identifying ways in which it may be developed. The methodological approach was a qualitative study utilising semi-structured interviews with 15 insolvency practitioners to gauge a deep understanding of the research questions. Findings indicated that there was broad based support for the effectiveness of the current legislative framework, however eight recommendations were drawn from the themes identified in the analysis to facilitate improved insolvency outcomes. These recommendations encompassed refinements to the existing legislation, reassessment of the policy and regulatory environment in which the legislation operates, and the broader development of a framework conducive to facilitating a corporate rescue culture. The present research reiterates the criticality of an effective corporate restructuring framework for {{the efficient}} operation of the Australian economy and to facilitate the rehabilitation of companies with viable underlying businesses as a matter of course...|$|E
40|$|While {{there is}} a vast {{literature}} on optimal bankruptcy laws and, specifically, on the optimal allocation of control rights between debtors and creditors in corporate bankruptcy, little {{has been said about}} the role that alternative insolvency institutions may play {{in the design of the}} optimal <b>insolvency</b> <b>framework.</b> This paper attempts to fill this gap by modelling two insolvency institutions -a bankruptcy system and a foreclosure system- that firms and their creditors may use when dealing with financial distress. Firms choose between one or the other based on lenders’ willingness to provide credit and the trade-off between two inefficiency costs, those from inefficient liquidations and those from productive inefficiencies caused by overinvestment in capital assets. The model’s key result is that welfare is a non-monotonic function of creditor control rights in bankruptcy, implying that a perfectly “creditor-friendly” bankruptcy code (a code that always grants control of the distressed firms to creditors) is very inefficient. A second result is that welfare is higher when the bankruptcy system is too “creditor-friendly” (i. e., it ensures the provision of credit, but generates too many inefficient liquidations) than when it is too “debtor-friendly”. Hence, if the optimal level of creditor control rights in bankruptcy cannot be ascertained in practice, it may be better to grant too much control of the bankruptcy process to creditors than too little, as the loss from undershooting that level is larger than that from overshooting it...|$|E
40|$|This paper reviews Latvia’s {{efforts to}} manage the {{increase}} in debt distress resulting from the unwinding of the 2000 - 07 credit boom and spillovers from the global financial crisis. The authorities have designed a strategy that strengthens incentives for marked-based debt resolution by improving the legal framework for credit enforcement, introducing tax incentives for debt write-downs, and strengthening financial sector supervision. These measures have started to yield results, but further steps are needed to speed up bankruptcy procedures and reduce credit enforcement costs. Latvia’s experience with market-based debt resolution may provide insights on managing debt distress in other countries with limited fiscal resources.

40|$|Using a new dataset of {{macroeconomic}} and banking-related variables {{we attempt}} to explain the evolution of “bad” loans in Greece over the period 2005 - 2015. Our {{findings suggest that the}} primary cause of the sharp increase in non-performing loans (NPLs) following the outbreak of the sovereign debt crisis can be mainly attributed to the unprecedented contraction of domestic economic activity and the subsequent rise in unemployment. Furthermore, our results offer no empirical evidence in support of a range of examined hypotheses assuming overly aggressive lending practices by major Greek credit institutions or any systematic efforts to boost current earnings by extending credit to lower credit quality clients. We find that the transmission of macroeconomic shocks to NPLs takes place relatively fast, with the estimated magnitude of the respective responses being broadly comparable with that documented in some earlier studies for other euro area periphery economies. Overall, our results support a swift implementation of reforms agreed with official lenders {{in the context of the}} new (3 rd) bailout programme. These envisage the modernization the county’s private sector <b>insolvency</b> <b>framework</b> and the creation of a more efficient model for the management of NPLs. A vigorous implementation of these reforms is key for allowing a resumption of positive credit creation, by freeing up valuable resources that are currently trapped in unproductive sectors of the domestic economy. This, in turn, would facilitate a speedier return to positive economic growth and a gradual reduction in unemployment...|$|E
40|$|The {{notion of}} special {{insolvency}} rules for {{small and medium-sized}} enterprises (SMEs) has attracted attention in international spheres, and within the ambit of some international and comparative approaches, same is considered in this article with particular focus on the South African position. In particular, we show that the South African insolvency regime does not, at present, cater for financially distressed small businesses in a specific and viable manner. In South Africa, although {{attention has been paid to}} the development and support of small businesses, similar considerations have not been observed with regard to the insolvency side of small business concerns. No comprehensive and focused process of dealing with financially distressed small businesses exists in the South African <b>insolvency</b> <b>framework.</b> This scenario prevails, notwithstanding that there are existing foreign and international policy guidelines, rules and regimes in developed jurisdictions that can serve as pointers in this regard. The purpose of this article is to first highlight the need for special treatment of small businesses by focusing on the shortcomings in the South African system, and, as a natural sequential development, policy proposals as unavoidable foundations to address these shortcomings. In the premises, the focus is on the principles and policies that are relevant to any discussion regarding insolvent businesses that fall within the scope of the SME category. Therefore, this paper deals with the concept of the small business, the South African insolvency regime and the international position pertaining to small businesses. In particular, the need for special treatment of SMEs under insolvent circumstances is discussed, consideration is given to the existing South African mechanisms available to small businesses in distress and the lack of suitable contextual provisions for small businesses in distress is noted. A core component of this article is the position in South Africa viewed against the backdrop of some international developments, international documents and principles that are relevant to an insolvency and rescue/rehabilitation regime within the context of the small business. As a logical conclusion, recommendations for reform of the South African regime are made. [URL]...|$|E
