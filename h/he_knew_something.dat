She comes downstairs after yelling at Ruby (Meghan Ory), her granddaughter, followed {{by a man who}} came to collect money: Mr. Gold (Carlyle), Rumpelstiltskin who also helped build and owns the entire town. When Emma mentions her name, Mr. Gold pauses as if <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>something</b> about her. Emma's decision to stay in Storybrooke causes the hands of the town clock, previously frozen at 8:15, to begin moving again, indicating that the Dark Curse is beginning to weaken.|$|E

500|$|... "De Mauro {{was very}} busy piecing {{together}} {{the elements of}} the plot, and his death stopped it being uncovered," [...] according to Ingroia. [...] "The other 'convergent' element in his death was the fact that he knew, from its inception, about the subversive project involving spies, neofascists and Mafia groups," [...] to stage the Borghese Coup," [...] Ingroia said. [...] "From his sources in neofascist circles, from his past in Prince Junio Valerio Borghese's crack Decima Mas unit, as well as from tip-offs from Mafia boss Emanuele D'Agostino, <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>something</b> was in the offing".|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} session {{took place}} on 17 April, in Studio 2 at Abbey Road. Jones arrived there to find that Barrett had brought in friends of his as support musicians: Jerry Shirley, drummer with Humble Pie, and Willie Wilson, Jokers Wild's drummer, although for this occasion he was playing bass. The problem with this new set-up, though, was that the songs were recorded as Barrett played them live in the studio; on the released versions, {{a number of them}} have false starts and commentaries from Barrett. The first track Barrett and his fellow musicians worked on was [...] "No Man's Land", after Barrett had played through the song several times, to allow Shirley and Wilson to pick up the segments. Once the rehearsal was through, they went for a take, to check how the band sounded and to test the equipment from within the control room. After these tests, the band recorded three takes, the last of which became the master take for [...] "No Man's Land"; the bass, however, was re-recorded at a later date. Playing along with Barrett wasn't easy, according to Jones: [...] "It was a case of following him, not playing with him. They were seeing and then playing so they were always a note behind..." [...] Shirley said of Barrett: [...] "He gave the impression <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>something</b> you didn't. He had this music sort of giggle..." ...|$|E
500|$|Like {{all other}} WrestleMania events, WrestleMania III was {{promoted}} {{for several months}} in advance. The main feud stemmed from André the Giant's heel turn and betrayal of his friend, the WWF World Heavyweight Champion Hulk Hogan, which began on an episode of Piper's Pit when WWF President Jack Tunney presented Hogan with a trophy for being the WWF World Heavyweight Champion for three years, and André, his good friend, came out to congratulate him but cryptically remarked [...] "Three years to be a champion, its a long time". A week later on another episode of Piper's Pit, Tunney presented André with a visibly smaller trophy for being [...] "undefeated in the WWF for 15 years" [...] and Hogan came out to congratulate André, but before The Giant could speak, Hogan ended up being {{the focal point of}} the interview. Annoyed by this, André walked out during Hogan's congratulation speech. A week later on yet another Piper's Pit segment, Jesse Ventura hinted <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>something</b> about Andre but wasn’t telling. This infuriated Piper and the two nearly came to blows before Jesse challenged that he could produce André next week, asking Piper “can you produce Hogan?” Piper agreed and nervously asked Hogan later on who agreed. The following week Hogan was on Pipers Pit first when Andre walked out with Bobby [...] "The Brain" [...] Heenan, a long-time adversary of Hogan and André, He announced himself to be André's new manager. André then challenged Hogan to a title match at WrestleMania III and attacked Hogan, ripping off Hogan's T-shirt and crucifix necklace.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first officer}} was {{described}} by personal friends and pilots as a witty, bright, outgoing individual with an excellent command of physical and mental skills in aircraft piloting.

2500|$|Guitarist Michael Nesmith {{stated that}} Jones's [...] "spirit and soul live well in my heart, {{among all the}} lovely people, who {{remember}} with me the good times, and the healing times, that were created for so many, including us. I have fond memories. I wish him safe travels." [...] In an 8 March 2012 interview with Rolling Stone magazine, Nesmith commented, [...] "For me, David was the Monkees. They were his band. We were his side men." [...] Bassist Peter Tork said, [...] "Adios to the Manchester Cowboy", and speaking to CNN, drummer/singer Micky Dolenz said, [...] "He was the brother I never had and this leaves a gigantic hole in my heart". Dolenz claimed that <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>something</b> bad {{was about to happen}} and said [...] "Can't believe it.. Still in shock.. had bad dreams all night long." [...] Dolenz was gratified by the public affection expressed for both Jones and the Monkees {{in the wake of his}} bandmate's death. [...] "He was a very well-known and well-loved character and person. There are a lot of people who are grieving pretty hard. The Monkees obviously had a following, and so did (Jones) on his own. So I'm not surprised, but I was flattered and honored to be considered one of his friends and a cohort in Monkee business." ...|$|E
2500|$|On October 30, 2002, Zevon was {{featured}} on the Late Show with David Letterman as the only guest for the entire hour. The band played [...] "I'll Sleep When I'm Dead" [...] as his introduction. Zevon performed several songs and spoke at length about his illness. Zevon had been a frequent guest and occasional substitute bandleader on Letterman's television shows since Late Night was first broadcast in 1982. He noted, [...] "I {{might have made a}} tactical error in not going to a physician for 20 years." [...] It was during this broadcast that, when asked by Letterman if <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>something</b> more about life and death now, he first offered his oft-quoted insight on dying: [...] "Enjoy every sandwich." [...] He also thanked Letterman for his years of support, calling him [...] "the best friend my music's ever had."
