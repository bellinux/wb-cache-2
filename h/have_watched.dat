5|$|As Mr. Burns {{fights for}} {{life at the}} hospital, the Springfield police are working to find his assailant. Smithers wakes {{up the next morning}} and vaguely remembers {{shooting}} someone the night before in a drunken rage. Guilt-ridden, Smithers heads for a local church, and is promptly arrested when the confessional {{turns out to be a}} police sting. While passing the media on his way to the police station, Smithers makes a witty remark Sideshow Mel recognizes from an episode of Pardon My Zinger that aired at the same time as the shooting. Mel realizes Smithers must <b>have</b> <b>watched</b> it as well, giving him an alibi. As Smithers' memory clears, it turns out he had actually shot Jasper in his wooden leg. Meanwhile, the townsmen pull down the sun-blocker, which crushes Shelbyville to their delight.|$|E
5|$|As of September 30, 2013, an {{estimated}} 22.1 million viewers <b>have</b> <b>watched</b> the premiere {{episode in the}} US through live, DVR, encore, and online viewing. In Canada, the premiere saw 2.706 million viewers, the third highest viewership for the week on the network. In the United Kingdom, the episode debuted as the highest rated drama launch of the year, averaging 3.23 million viewers including the +1 channel and recordings viewed the same night, a share of 14.8 percent of people watching TV in the UK at the time. The premiere in Australia was watched by 1.3 million viewers, the top show of the night. In New Zealand, the episode premiered to 326,790 viewers, the fourth highest show of the night, and the most watched show on TV2. By the time the full season {{was picked up by}} ABC it ranked as the number one new series of the 2013–14 television season among adults 18–49.|$|E

25|$|After the {{screening}} room incident, Hughes {{moved into a}} bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel where he also rented rooms for his aides, his wife, and numerous girlfriends. He would sit naked in his bedroom with a pink hotel napkin placed over his genitals, watching movies. This may have been because Hughes found the touch of clothing painful due to allodynia. He may <b>have</b> <b>watched</b> movies to distract himself from his pain—a common practice among patients with intractable pain, especially {{those who do not}} receive adequate treatment. In one year, Hughes spent an estimated $11million at the hotel.|$|E
25|$|The {{apparent}} lack {{of reaction}} by numerous neighbors purported to <b>have</b> <b>watched</b> the scene or to have heard Genovese's cries for help, although erroneously reported, prompted research into diffusion of responsibility and the bystander effect. Social psychologists John M. Darley and Bibb Latané started this line of research, showing that contrary to common expectations, larger numbers of bystanders decrease the likelihood that someone will step forward and help a victim. The reasons include the fact that onlookers see that others are not helping either, that onlookers believe others will know better how to help, and that onlookers feel uncertain about helping while others are watching. The Genovese case thus became a classic feature of social psychology textbooks.|$|E

25|$|In April 2006, Disney {{announced}} that Lost {{would be available}} for free online in streaming format, with advertising, on ABC's website, {{as part of a}} two-month experiment of future distribution strategies. The trial, which ran from May to June 2006, caused a stir among network affiliates who were afraid of being cut out of advertising revenue. The streaming of Lost episodes direct from ABC's website was only available to viewers in the United States due to international licensing agreements. In 2009, Lost was named the most-watched show on the Internet based on viewers of episodes on ABC's website. The Nielsen Company reported that 1.425million unique viewers <b>have</b> <b>watched</b> at least one episode on ABC's website.|$|E
25|$|Fish {{can seem}} mindful of which {{individuals}} <b>have</b> <b>watched</b> {{them in the}} past. In an experiment with Siamese fighting fish, two males were made to fight each other while being watched by a female, whom the males could also see. The winner and the loser of the fight were then, separately, given a choice between spending time next to the watching female or to a new female. The winner courted both females equally, but the loser spent more time next to the new female, avoiding the watcher female. In this species, females prefer males they have seen win a fight over males they have seen losing, and it therefore makes sense for a male to prefer a female that has never seen him {{as opposed to a}} female that has seen him lose.|$|E
25|$|It {{is highly}} likely that Eggestein even {{travelled}} to Mainz {{himself in the}} 1450s to learn the art of book printing from Gutenberg. When this was and how long the stay lasted cannot be definitely resolved, due to sketchy source materials. Ferdinand Geldner holds the view that Eggestein was already in Mainz in 1454 and that might be why he lost the office of Siegelbewahrer in Strasbourg in 1455. If this were the case, then he could <b>have</b> <b>watched</b> the printing of the 42-line-per-page Gutenberg Bible firsthand. Geldner further suspects that Heinrich Eggestein actively participated in the typesetting and printing of the Türkenkalender, which was completed {{in the middle of}} December in 1454. He did not give up his Strasbourg citizen's rights until August 1457, however. If he had left Alsace so late, he would have admittedly arrived in Mainz after the break between Gutenberg and Johann Fust.|$|E

25|$|Motion {{pictures}} {{have been}} {{an important aspect of}} urban culture since 1910. The places where people <b>have</b> <b>watched</b> films, from the nickelodeon to the multiplex, have changed in ways that reflect changes in the society generally. The cinema in Edmonton reflected the changing urban landscape. Because the movie houses themselves are part of the entertainment product, the cinema industry follows a cycle of construction, renovation, and demolition. The industry's face is constantly changing in an effort to draw people inside; Edmonton's cinemas have moved with the retail industry from the downtown core to the suburban shopping malls, and are now experimenting with new formats similar to retailers' big boxes. Just as Edmonton is known for massive amounts of retail space, it also {{has one of the highest}} numbers of movie screens in Canada in proportion to its population. Cinemas are thus a revealing aspect of trends in urban development.|$|E
25|$|After {{each country}} has {{designated}} its official entry, English-subtitled copies of all submitted films are {{shipped to the}} Academy, where they are screened by the Foreign Language Film Award Committee(s), whose members select by secret ballot the five official nominations. Final voting for the winner is restricted to active and life Academy members who have attended exhibitions of all five nominated films. Members who <b>have</b> <b>watched</b> the Foreign Language Film entries only on videocassette or DVD are ineligible to vote. These procedures were slightly modified for the 2006 (79th) Academy Awards, with the Academy deciding to institute a two-stage process in determining the nominees: {{for the first time}} in the history of the award, a nine-film shortlist was published one week before the official nominations announcement. In the meantime, a smaller thirty-member committee which included ten New York City-based Academy members was formed, and spent three days viewing the shortlisted films before choosing the five official nominees. Residents of the city hosting the country's second largest film industry were thus allowed to participate for the first time ever in the selection process for the Foreign Language Film Award nominees.|$|E
