Bride wrote later: [...] "I <b>did</b> <b>my</b> duty. I hope I finished [...] I don't know. We left him on the cabin floor of the radio room, and he was not moving."

It was very therapeutic, in a way. And easy – I was shocked at {{how easy it was}} to be honest about yourself and things that affect you. It is a dance record, but I wanted it to be serious. I wanted to talk about serious things, but do it in a not-so-serious way, with music that makes you want to get up and dance.|$|E
500|$|The {{last of the}} [...] "Lucy poems" [...] to be composed, [...] "I {{travelled}} among unknown men", was {{the only}} one not included in the second edition of Lyrical Ballads. Although Wordsworth claimed that the poem was composed while he was still in Germany, it was in fact written during April 1801. Evidence for this later date comes from a letter Wordsworth wrote to Mary Hutchinson referring to [...] "I travelled" [...] as a newly created poem. In 1802, he instructed his printer to place [...] "I travelled" [...] immediately after [...] "A slumber <b>did</b> <b>my</b> spirit seal" [...] in Lyrical Ballads, but the poem was omitted. It was later published in Poems, in Two Volumes in 1807.|$|E

500|$|Finkelstein was {{questioned}} {{after his arrival}} at Ben Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv and detained for 24 hours in a holding cell. After speaking to Israeli attorney Michael Sfard he was placed on a flight back to Amsterdam, his point of origin. In an interview with Haaretz, Finkelstein stated [...] "I <b>did</b> <b>my</b> best to provide absolutely candid and comprehensive answers to all the questions put to me. I am confident that I have nothing to hide... no suicide missions or secret rendezvous with terrorist organizations." [...] He had been travelling to visit friends in the West Bank and stated he {{had no interest in}} visiting Israel. Sfard said banning Finkelstein from entering the country [...] "recalls the behavior of the Soviet bloc countries".|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Lucy poems" [...] {{consist of}} [...] "Strange fits of passion have I known", [...] "She dwelt among the untrodden ways", [...] "I {{travelled}} among unknown men", [...] "Three years she grew in sun and shower", and [...] "A slumber <b>did</b> <b>my</b> spirit seal". Although they {{are presented as}} a series in modern anthologies, Wordsworth did not conceive {{of them as a}} group, nor did he seek to publish the poems in sequence. He described the works as [...] "experimental" [...] in the prefaces to both the 1798 and 1800 editions of Lyrical Ballads, and revised the poems significantly—shifting their thematic emphasis—between 1798 and 1799. Only after his death in 1850 did publishers and critics begin to treat the poems as a fixed group; anthologies since have generally presented them as a series.|$|E
500|$|Written in spare language, [...] "A slumber <b>did</b> <b>my</b> spirit seal" [...] {{consists}} of two stanzas, each four lines long. The first stanza is built upon even, soporific movement in which figurative language conveys the nebulous image of a girl who [...] "seemed a thing that could not feel / The touch of earthly years". The second maintains the quiet and even tone of the first but serves to undermine its sense of the eternal by revealing that Lucy has died and that the calmness of the first stanza represents death. The narrator's response to her death lacks bitterness or emptiness; instead he takes consolation {{from the fact that}} she is now beyond life's trials, and [...] "at last...in inanimate community with the earth's natural fixtures". The lifeless rocks and stones depicted in the concluding line convey the finality of Lucy's death.|$|E

500|$|In March 1918 the German Army {{advanced}} {{closer to}} Amiens and Paris, and Denning's unit {{was sent to}} France to help stop the advance. Under continuous shell fire for three months, {{the company and the}} 38th (Welsh) Infantry Division held their section of the line, with a unit under Denning's command building a bridge to allow infantry to advance over the River Ancre. Denning went two days without sleep while building these bridges; shortly after one was completed, a German aeroplane dropped a bomb on it, forcing them to start again. The unit advanced over the River Ancre and the Canal du Nord, but Denning fell ill with influenza and was in hospital for the last few days of the war. When writing of his experiences in World War I in The Family Story, Denning summed up his war service with characteristic pithiness in just four words: [...] "I <b>did</b> <b>my</b> bit".|$|E
500|$|Several Harrison biographers {{likewise}} hold Extra Texture in low esteem, with Alan Clayson {{describing it}} as his [...] "artistic nadir" [...] and [...] "a bedsit record rather than a dancing one". Simon Leng writes that Harrison's post-Dark Horse [...] "rehabilitation disc" [...] came way too soon, resulting in an uncharacteristically passionless work, with its singer sounding [...] "punch drunk". Aside from the uplifting [...] "You", both authors identify [...] "Tired of Midnight Blue" [...] as the only saving grace. Gary Tillery notes the [...] "darkly sarcastic" [...] album title for a collection full of such [...] "downbeat" [...] tracks, the darkest of which is [...] "Grey Cloudy Lies". Harrison himself rated Extra Texture as his worst solo release of the 1970s. Speaking to Musician magazine in 1987, he dismissed it as [...] "a grubby album" [...] and added: [...] "The production left {{a lot to be}} desired, as <b>did</b> <b>my</b> performance... Some songs I like, but in retrospect I wasn't very happy about it." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams" [...] was {{delivered}} on September 18, 2007, at Carnegie Mellon University's McConomy Auditorium. Over 450 Carnegie Mellon students, staff members, {{and friends of}} Pausch attended the lecture, leaving only standing room as {{this was more than}} the auditorium could hold. Pausch later commented about this in an interview, saying [...] "A couple of hundred people in a room, looking and listening and laughing and applauding– hopefully at the appropriate times– that gives a lot of validation to my kids {{that a lot of people}} believe in this, and a lot of people who knew me believe that I <b>did</b> <b>my</b> best to try to live this way." [...] The first introduction of the speech as well as the series of lectures was given by Indira Nair, the Vice Provost for Education at Carnegie Mellon. Nair first explained the university's aforementioned lecture series called [...] "Journeys", in which eight more professors from Carnegie Mellon would share their insights on their professional and personal experiences over the years.|$|E
