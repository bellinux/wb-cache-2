5|$|The {{park has}} a diverse and complex {{geologic}} history. Since its formation, {{the area that}} comprises the park has experienced at least four major periods of extensive volcanism, three or four periods of major sedimentation, and several intervals of major tectonic deformation where the crust has been reshaped. Two periods of glaciation (a series of ice ages) <b>have</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> effects on the area, although no glaciers ever existed in the ranges now in the park.|$|E
5|$|Alumni <b>have</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> illustrious {{coaching}} careers. Bill Bowerman and Bill Dellinger both became Oregon coaches. Alberto Salazar and Terrance Mahon became distance running coaches {{after their}} running days. Others have found success related {{to track and}} field but not directly in the sport. Bill Bowerman and Phil Knight both co-founded Nike. Tinker Hatfield ran track at Oregon while studying architecture and later became a famous shoe designer for Nike. Rudy Chapa, a successful distance runner in his own right, founded SPARQ, an athletic equipment company.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea's away colours {{are usually}} all yellow or all white with blue trim. More recently, the club {{have had a}} number of black or dark blue away kits. As with most teams, they <b>have</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> some more unusual ones. At Docherty's behest, in the 1966 FA Cup semi-final they wore blue and black stripes, based on Inter Milan's kit. In the mid-1970s, the away strip was a red, white and green kit {{inspired}} by the Hungarian national side of the 1950s. Other memorable away kits include an all jade strip worn from 1986–89, red and white diamonds from 1990–92, graphite and tangerine from 1994–96, and luminous yellow from 2007–08. The graphite and tangerine strip often appears in lists of the worst football kits ever.|$|E

5|$|Except for James Whitcomb, all of Indiana's {{governors}} {{have been}} married {{at the time of}} their election. Whitcomb married while in office. About half of the governors {{have been married}} multiple times, all due to the death of their first wives. Three governors' wives, including Whitcomb's, died while their husbands were in office. Except for Jonathan Jennings and Thomas R. Marshall, all of the state governors <b>have</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> children. After leaving office, Marshall adopted a young boy. Only twenty of Indiana's governors were native to the state. Seven were born in Pennsylvania, four born in Ohio, and four born in Kentucky. Other governors have come from Michigan, Virginia, New York, and Vermont.|$|E
5|$|In Italy, {{the number}} of {{breeding}} pairs declined from 30 in 1970 to 9 in the 1990s. Nearly all breeding failures were due to human activities. In Spain, which holds about 50% of the European population suggested causes of decline include poisoning by accumulation of lead, pesticides (especially due to large-scale use in the control of Schistocerca gregaria locust swarms), and electrocution. Windfarms may also pose a threat. Poorly designed power transmission lines in east Africa electrocute many wintering vultures. A shortage of carrion resulting from new rules for disposal of dead animals following the outbreak of Bovine Spongiform Encephalitis in parts of Europe during 2000 may <b>have</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> an effect on some populations. In Armenia direct persecution for trophy and for local illegal trade of animal as pet has been recorded.|$|E
5|$|In the {{official}} records of another Bronze Age empire, {{that of the}} Hittites in Anatolia, various references from c. 1400 BC to 1220 BC mention a country named Ahhiyawa. Recent scholarship, based on textual evidence, new interpretations of the Hittite inscriptions, {{as well as on}} recent surveys of archaeological evidence about Mycenaean-Anatolian contacts during this period, concludes that the term Ahhiyawa must have been used in reference to the Mycenaean world (land of the Achaeans), or at least to a part of it. This term may <b>have</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> broader connotations in some texts, possibly referring to all regions settled by Mycenaeans or regions under direct Mycenaean political control. Another similar ethnonym Ekwesh in twelfth century BC Egyptian inscriptions, has been commonly identified with the Ahhiyawans. These Ekwesh were mentioned as a group of the Sea People.|$|E

5|$|Several {{video games}} have either been adapted into or have had {{spin-offs}} {{in the form}} of manga and novels. The first was the novelization of Final FantasyII in 1989, and was followed by a manga adaptation of Final FantasyIII in 1992.

They <b>have</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> three compensatory picks since {{the institution of the}} First-Year Player Draft in 1965. These additional picks are provided when a team loses a particularly valuable free agent in the prior off-season, or, more recently, if a team fails to sign a draft pick from the previous year. The Brewers have failed to sign four of their first-round picks; Bill Bordley (1976), Alex Fernandez (1988), Kenny Henderson (1991), and Dylan Covey (2010).|$|E

They have also made the first overall selection five times (1970, 1972, 1974, 1988, and 2004), tied for the most such picks with the New York Mets. They <b>have</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> 24 compensatory picks since {{the institution of the}} First-Year Player Draft in 1965. These additional picks are provided when a team loses a particularly valuable free agent in the previous off-season, or, more recently, if a team fails to sign a draft pick from the previous year. The Padres have failed to sign two of their first-round picks, Karsten Whitson (2010) and Brett Austin (2011), and received the 10th pick in 2011 and 55th pick in 2012 as compensation.|$|E

5|$|The decorations are {{all high}} quality and often highly complex. In one decoration, which {{occupies}} a one-inch square {{piece of a}} page, there are 158 complex interlacements of white ribbon with a black border on either side. Some decorations can only be fully seen with magnifying glasses, although lenses of the required power are not {{known to have been}} available until hundreds of years after the book's completion. The complicated knot work and interweaving found in Kells and related manuscripts have many parallels in the metalwork and stone carving of the period. Since their gradual rediscovery from the 19th century on, these designs <b>have</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> an enduring popularity. Many of these motifs are used today in popular art including jewellery and tattoos.|$|E
5|$|The former British colonies include Trinidad and Tobago, whose calypso {{style is}} an {{especially}} potent part of {{the music of the}} other former British colonies, which also share traditions like the Big Drum dance. The French islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe share the popular zouk style and <b>have</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> extensive musical contact with the music of Haiti, itself once a French colony though not part of the Lesser Antilles. The Dutch colonies of Curaçao, Bonaire and Aruba share the combined rhythm popular style. The islands also share a passion for kaseko, a genre of Surinamese music; Suriname and its neighbors Guyana and French Guiana share folk and popular styles that are connected enough to the Antilles and other Caribbean islands that both countries are studied in the broader context of Antillean or Caribbean music.|$|E
5|$|The men's and women's tennis {{programs}} <b>have</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> many successful years. The {{programs have}} remained {{as two of}} the more competitive tennis teams in the WAC for several decades.

In 1999, former head coach Bob Krug was named NFCA Midwest Region Coach of the Year. The streak in WAC Championships ended during the 2003–04 school year, but the Buffs rebounded and won three more consecutive WAC championships from 2005 to 2007. The Buffs added WAC Championship titles in 2011 and 2014. The tennis program has sent numerous players to the state tournament throughout the program's history.|$|E

5|$|The {{northern}} pintail is a bird of open wetlands which nests on the ground, often {{some distance from}} water. It feeds by dabbling for plant food and adds small invertebrates to its diet during the nesting season. It is highly gregarious when not breeding, forming large mixed flocks with other species of duck. This duck's population is affected by predators, parasites and avian diseases. Human activities, such as agriculture, hunting and fishing, <b>have</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> {{a significant impact on}} numbers. Nevertheless, owed to the huge range and large population of this species, it is not threatened globally.|$|E
