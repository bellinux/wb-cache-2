5|$|All bovids mate {{at least}} once a year, and smaller species may even mate twice. Mating seasons occur {{typically}} during the rainy months for most bovids. As such, breeding might peak twice in the equatorial regions. The sheep and goats exhibit remarkable seasonality of reproduction, in the determination of which the annual cycle of daily photoperiod plays a pivotal role. Other factors that have a significant influence on this cycle include the temperature of the surroundinga, nutritional status, social interactions, the date of parturition and the lactation period. A study of this phenomenon concluded that goats and sheep are short-day breeders. Mating in most sheep breeds begins in summer or early autumn. Mating in sheep is also affected by melatonin, that advances the onset of the breeding season; and thyroxine, that terminates the breeding season. Estrus lasts for at most a day in bovids, with the exception of bovines and tragelaphines. Except the hartebeest and the topi, all bovids can detect estrus in females by testing the urine using the vomeronasal organ. Once the male is assured that the female is in estrus, he begins courtship displays; these displays vary greatly from the elaborate marches among <b>gregarious</b> <b>species</b> to the fervent licking of female genitalia among solitary species. Females, initially not receptive, ultimately mates with the male which has achieved dominance over others. Receptiveness is expressed by permission for mounting by the male and setting aside the tail by the female. Copulation generally takes a few seconds.|$|E
500|$|The common {{starling}} is {{a highly}} <b>gregarious</b> <b>species,</b> especially in autumn and winter. Although flock size is highly variable, huge, noisy flocks - murmurations - may form near roosts. These dense concentrations of birds {{are thought to be}} a defence against attacks by birds of prey such as peregrine falcons or Eurasian sparrowhawks. Flocks form a tight sphere-like formation in flight, frequently expanding and contracting and changing shape, seemingly without any sort of leader. Each common starling changes its course and speed {{as a result of the}} movement of its closest neighbours. Very large roosts, exceptionally up to 1.5million birds, can form in city centres, woodlands or reedbeds, causing problems with their droppings. These may accumulate up to [...] deep, killing trees by their concentration of chemicals. In smaller amounts, the droppings act as a fertiliser, and therefore woodland managers may try to move roosts from one area of a wood to another to benefit from the soil enhancement and avoid large toxic deposits.|$|E
60|$|I {{have still}} {{to speak of}} the voice of the tree-creepers, an {{important}} point in the study of these birds; for, though not accounted singers, some species emit remarkable sounds; moreover, language in birds is closely related to the social instinct. They seem to be rather solitary than gregarious; and this seems only natural in birds so timid, weak-winged, and hard pressed. It would also be natural to conclude from what has been said concerning their habits that they are comparatively silent; for, as a rule, vigorous social birds are loquacious and loud-voiced, while shy solitary kinds preservo silence, except in the love season. Nevertheless the creepers are loquacious and have loud resonant voices; this fact, however, does not really contradict a well-known principle, for the birds possess the social disposition in an eminent degree, only the social habit is kept down in them by the conditions of a life which makes solitude necessary. Thus, a large proportion of species are found to pair for life; and the only reasonable explanation of this habit in birds--one which is not very common in the mammalia--is that such species possess the social temper or feeling, and live in pairs only because they cannot afford to live in flocks. Strictly <b>gregarious</b> <b>species</b> pair only for the breeding season. In the creepers the attachment between the birds thus mated for life is very great, and, as Azara truly says of Anumbius, so fond of each other's society are these birds, that when one incubates the other sits {{at the entrance to the}} nest, and when one carries food to its young the other accompanies it, even if it has found nothing to cany. In these species that live in pairs, when the two birds are separated they are perpetually calling to each other, showing how impatient of solitude they are; while even from the more solitary kind, a high-pitched call-note is constantly heard in the woods, for these birds, debarred from associating together, satisfy their instinct by conversing with one another over long distances.|$|E

60|$|Until one observes {{starlings}} in {{this close}} way, even to their minutest actions--I had indeed little {{else to do}} during my three winter months in this nursing-home--it is only natural to believe that among <b>gregarious</b> <b>species</b> the starling {{is one of those}} least likely to pair for life, seeing that in it the gregarious instinct is intensified and more highly developed than in most others. One would suppose that the flock, which is like an organism--that is to say, the attachment to the flock--would, out of the breeding season, take the place of the close relation or companionship between bird and bird seen in species known to pair for life. Only the pairing passion, one would suppose, could serve to dissolve the company of birds and this only for a brief season of about a couple of months' duration. There is but one brood raised in the season, and the whole business of reproduction is well over before the end of June. Later breeders are those that have lost their first eggs or broods. And no sooner are the young brought off and instructed in the starling's sole vocation (except his fruit-eating) of extracting the grubs it subsists on from the roots of the grass--a business which detains them for a week or two--than the married life is apparently over and the communal life resumed. The whole life of the bird is then changed; the sole tie appears to be that of the flock; home and young are forgotten: the birds range hither and thither about the land, and by and by migrate to distant places, some passing oversea, while others from the northern counties and from Scotland and the islands come down to the south of England, where they winter in millions and myriads. There they form the winter habit of congregating in immense numbers in the evening at their favourite roosting-places, and hundreds and thousands of small flocks, which during the daylight hours exist distributed over an area of hundreds of square miles all make to one point and combine into one flock. At such times they actually appear to rejoice in their own incalculable numbers and gather earlier than they need at the roosting-place, so that the whole vast gathering may spend an hour or so in their beloved aerial exercises.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{residential}} {{style of}} rodents varies across and within species from colonial to solitary and territorial [1]. A mechanism that supports this behavioral distinction might be differential {{levels of social}} motivation rather than explicit species-typical social behavior. Accordingly, socially motivated animals learn seeking behavior {{that leads to a}} colonial residential pattern and socially unmotivated animals do not learn this behavior and remain solitary. The present experi-ments test this hypothesis by measuring social motivation in a <b>gregarious</b> social <b>species</b> of vole, the prairie vole, and in a solitary species, the meadow vole. Although their explicit social behavior was similar, Prairie voles readily learned to per-form an instrumental response for access to a target vole while meadow voles did not. Neither the estrus status nor the sex of the target affected instrumental responding in either species. In sum, differential social motivation may contribute to distinctive residential patterns in rodents...|$|R
500|$|Active mainly during daytime, the {{hartebeest}} grazes in {{the early}} morning and late afternoon, and rests in shade around noon. <b>Gregarious,</b> the <b>species</b> forms herds of up to 300 individuals. Larger numbers gather in places with abundant grass. In 1963, a congregation of 10,000 animals was recorded on the plains near Sekoma Pan in Botswana. However, moving herds are not so cohesive, and tend to disperse frequently. The members of a herd can be divided into four groups: territorial adult males, non-territorial adult males, young males, and the females with their young. The females form groups of five to 12 animals, with four generations of young in the group. Females fight for dominance over the herd. Sparring between males and females is common. At three or four years of age, the males can attempt to take over a territory and its female members. A resident male defends his territory and will fight if provoked. The male marks the border of his territory through defecation.|$|R

40|$|Many Collembola {{species are}} characterised by an aggregative behaviour, which {{is closely related}} to {{communication}} and co-ordination between individuals. In spite of a general heavy predation pressure, a large number of Collembola is found in soil suggesting that they have developed defence strategies against predators. This study investigates changes in spatial structure of <b>gregarious</b> Collembola <b>species</b> in presence of a predator. It is analysed if the gregarious lifestyle of Collembola populations functions as a defence strategy against predation. In presence of a predator distances between individuals in the Collembola species Folsomia candida and Heteromurus tetrophthalmus became closer, reducing the risk of individuals to be captured by predators. On the contrary, Onychiurus sinensis specimens, which were never caught probably because of the extrusion of repelling fluids by means of their pseudocelli, moved away from each another. Besides being a successful chemical defence against predation, repelling fluid secretion may effectively repel conspecifics, thereby keeping individuals at greater distance...|$|R

Second, workers from different ant species varied with respect to their dynamics, presenting degrees of predictability as well as stochastic signals.

Our results underscore the potential of RQA and RPs in the analysis of complex behavioral patterns, as well as in general inferences on animal behavior and other biological phenomena...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAccording to {{the social}} {{intelligence}} hypothesis, social context represents an important force driving the selection of animal cognitive abilities such as the capacity to estimate {{the nature of the}} social relationships between other individuals. Despite this importance, the influence of this force has been assessed only in primates and never in other animals showing social interactions. In this way, avian communication generally takes place in a network of signallers and receivers, which represents an audience altering individual signalling behaviours. Indeed, vocal amplitude and repertoire are known to be socially regulated and the attitude towards the opposite sex may change depending on the audience. This 'audience effect' provides support for the reality of social awareness in some bird species. However no evidence has yet been found to suggest that birds are able to estimate the characteristics of the social relationships between group-mates. Here we show that the male of a <b>gregarious</b> songbird <b>species</b> [...] the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) [...] pays attention to the mating status of conspecific pairs, and uses this information to control its behaviour towards its female partner...|$|R
