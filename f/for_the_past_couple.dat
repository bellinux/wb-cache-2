500|$|The album's {{influence}} has reached beyond jazz, as musicians of such genres as rock and classical {{have been influenced}} by it, while critics have written about it {{as one of the most}} influential albums of all time. Many improvisatory rock musicians of the 1960s referred to Kind of Blue for inspiration, along with other Davis albums, as well as Coltrane's modal records My Favorite Things (1961) and A Love Supreme (1965). Guitarist Duane Allman of the Allman Brothers Band said his soloing on songs such as [...] "In Memory of Elizabeth Reed" [...] "comes from Miles and Coltrane, and particularly Kind of Blue. I've listened to that album so many times that <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>couple</b> of years, I haven't hardly listened to anything else." [...] Pink Floyd keyboardist Richard Wright said that the chord progressions on the album influenced the structure of the introductory chords to the song [...] "Breathe" [...] on their landmark opus The Dark Side of the Moon (1973). In his book Kind of Blue: The Making of a Miles Davis Masterpiece, writer Ashley Kahn wrote [...] "still acknowledged as the height of hip, four decades after it was recorded, Kind of Blue is the premier album of its era, jazz or otherwise. Its vapory piano introduction is universally recognized". [...] Producer Quincy Jones, one of Davis' longtime friends, wrote: [...] "That [...] will always be my music, man. I play Kind of Blue every day—it's my orange juice. It still sounds like it was made yesterday". Pianist Chick Corea, one of Miles' acolytes, was also struck by its majesty, later stating [...] "It's one thing to just play a tune, or play a program of music, but it's another thing to practically create a new language of music, which is what Kind of Blue did." ...|$|E

The hazard of composite outcome on nevirapine compared with efavirenz was 1. 02 (95 %CI: 0. 52 - 1. 99) with p-value = 0. 96. Similarly, the hazard of composite outcome on tenofovir and stavudine compared with zidovudine were 1. 87 (95 %CI: 1. 52 - 2. 32), p-value < 0. 0001 and 1. 72 (95 % CI: 1. 22 - 2. 32), p-value = 0. 002, respectively. The rate of CD 4 increase in response to treatment was high during the first 10 months and stabilized later. This study revealed that treatment responses were comparable whether nevirapine or efavirenz was chosen to initiate antiretroviral therapy for HIV/AIDS patients in Ethiopia. There was significant difference on risk of composite outcome between patients who were initiated with Tenofovir containing ART regimen compared with zidovudine after controlling for NNRTI drug combinations...|$|R

40|$|Frequency {{response}} analysis (FRA) is {{a technique}} used to diagnose the mechanical integrity of a transformer winding; such diagnostic tools can be of enormous value since power transformers are a critical asset within any electrical network. To minimize the probability of an unexpected outage, or prevent a catastrophic failure, maintenance and monitoring of power transformers is essential <b>for</b> utilities. Over <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>couple</b> of decades, FRA has been utilized as an off-line diagnosis method. However, with the recent development in smart grid systems, {{there is now a}} growing interest in the development of on-line FRA techniques. This paper proposes a technique for inservice monitoring of power transformer winding deformation, which uses a broad frequency sine wave voltage excitation signal and high frequency Current Transformers (CT) in conjunction with the bushings test taps. Experiments using this system were conducted and then validated on a single-phase 22 kV/ 110 V voltage transformer. [Final citation details to be advised...|$|R
2500|$|Roberts was at {{the time}} a {{resident}} of nearby Georgetown, another unincorporated area of Bart Township. His wife last saw him at 8:45a.m. when they walked their children to the bus stop before she left. When Mrs. Roberts returned home a little before 11:00a.m., she discovered four suicide notes; one addressed to herself and one to each of their three children. Roberts called his wife from the schoolhouse on his cell phone and told her that he had molested two young female relatives (between the ages of 3 and 5) 20 years previously (when he was 12) and had been daydreaming about molesting again. One note Roberts left behind indicated his despondency over a daughter who died approximately 20 minutes after birth nine years earlier. He stated that he had [...] "been having dreams <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>couple</b> of years about doing what he did 20 years ago and he has dreams of doing them again", according to State Police Commissioner Colonel Jeffrey Miller. On October 4, 2006, the two relatives whom Roberts said he molested 20 years ago told police that no such abuse had ever happened, throwing a new layer of mystery over the gunman's motive and mental state during the shooting. KY Jelly was also found in the schoolhouse among Roberts's belongings, possibly suggesting multiple motives for the incident.|$|E

2500|$|On June 5, 2017, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain and Egypt had officially cut {{diplomatic}} ties with Qatar. Saudi Arabia said {{it took the}} decision to cut {{diplomatic ties}} due to Qatar’s “embrace of various terrorist and sectarian groups aimed at destabilising the region”, including the Muslim Brotherhood, al-Qaida, Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and groups supported by Iran in the kingdom’s eastern province of Qatif. Islam Hassan argues [...] "Starting from 2000 and ahead, Qatar has been pursuing an independent foreign policy that at times clash with the Saudi strategic interests in the region. The fact that Qatar has not been toeing the Saudi foreign policy, and dealing with states and non-state actors that the Saudis do not approve of have caused this tension in relations {{over the past couple}} of years, mainly after the Arab uprisings. This tension was revived by the hacking saga of Qatar News Agency and the statement that was attributed to Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad, which Qatar falsified later. This happened at a time Mohamed bin Salman is facing competition from Mohamed bin Nayef over the Saudi throne. Mohamed bin Salman tried to have the US blessing during Trump's visit to Saudi to force Qatar to its knees and go back home with a win that would give him more popularity in Saudi Arabia, easing his journey to power. With regards to UAE, there has been always competition between al-Nahyans of Abu Dhabi and al-Thanis of Qatar. This competition goes back to the 1800s. The Arab uprisings ushered a new chapter in the Qatari-Emirati competition. The competition led to the Emiratis playing a major role in the withdrawal of ambassadors from Qatar in 2014. At the beginning of the current diplomatic crisis, particularly after the hacking saga, UAE was trying to maintain the problem. Yet, Aljazeera's publishing of Yousuf al-Otaiba's leaked emails got the UAE on board with Saudi Arabia. Insofar as Bahrain is concerned, the small Kingdom has been toeing the Saudi foreign policy <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>couple</b> of years. It seems that their severing of ties with Qatar was mainly an answer to a Saudi call." ...|$|E
40|$|Este trabalho tem como objetivo traçar perfis biográfico-críticos de quatro escritores ligados por laços de sangue e de escrita. Bernardo Guimarães, Alphonsus de Guimaraens, João Alphonsus e Alphonsus de Guimaraens Filho formam quatro gerações de uma mesma família que se dedicou à {{literatura}}. Suas vidas e obras se entrelaçam aqui num campo imaginário, documental e real, assim como evidenciam a convivência com seus pares literários e as relações com a literatura de suas respectivas épocas. Nestes entrecruzamentos há uma leitura da obra destes escritores que aborda, entre outros elementos, a tendência – comum entre os quatro – de transformar os laços de parentesco em alianças artísticas, a capacidade de intercambiar experiências estéticas marcadamente diferentes, transformando a solidão do trabalho artístico em atividade de compartilhamento de experiências literárias. Há aqui o espírito de aventura e a ousadia de atitudes e escolhas temático-estéticas de Bernardo Guimarães; o sedentarismo nostálgico dos centros de agitação cultural e a concentração no requinte escritural, de Alphonsus de Guimaraens; o impulso de renovação, a perspicácia na observação da cena sociopolítica e a disponibilidade em preservar e divulgar a herança das gerações anteriores, em João Alphonsus; a lucidez no apego às dicções poéticas tradicionais, na construção da própria obra, e o desempenho cuidadoso da tarefa de levar adiante a preservação e divulgação da herança das gerações anteriores, em Alphonsus Filho. This thesis presents critical {{biographies of}} four writers who were linked by kinship and their writing. Bernardo Guimarães, Alphonsus de Guimaraens, João Alphonsus e Alphonsus de Guimaraens Filho belong to {{four generations of}} a family devoted to literature. Here, their lives and writings {{come together in a}} field that is at once imaginary, documentary and real, that maps out their relationships with their peers {{as well as with the}} literature of their times. A reading of the works of these authors in their social context reveals the tendency of all four to transform kinship links into artistic alliances, and their shared capacity to exchange distinct aesthetic experiences in such a way as to assuage the solitude of their work in the sharing of their literary experiences: the spirit of adventure of Bernardo Guimarães the boldness of his choice of themes and his aesthetic approach; <b>the</b> sedentary nostalgia <b>for</b> <b>the</b> centres of cultural innovation and a concentration on an elegance of writing on the part of Alphonsus de Guimaraens; an impulse for renovation, a perspicacity in the observation of the social and political scene and a willingness to preserve and disseminate the work of previous generations in the case of João Alphonsus; and, a similar respect <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>coupled</b> with <b>the</b> elaboration of traditional poetic forms in his own writing in the work of Alphonsus Filho...|$|R

My concern is with the Anglophone world, which is itself not monolithic; but in respect of attitudes towards Greece and Rome, the prevailing trends have long been similar in British and American culture and in colonial cultures as well. This situation is sometimes explained as a product of the Romantic movement at the turn of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and cultural historians have amply documented the Romantic fascination with things Greek.
