40|$|Abstract:- The paper discuses {{the main}} {{problems}} which appear when traditional business, based in <b>sales</b> <b>agents,</b> moves to new e-commerce models. Customers, {{used to describe}} to <b>sales</b> <b>agents</b> their needs using natural language, are suffering {{from the lack of}} expressiveness using product query forms, which are too rigid. Replacing <b>sales</b> <b>agents</b> for automatic systems implies a loss of flexibility interpreting the customer query, narrowing the result set, which could imply a loss of business opportunities. The paper proposes solutions to these problems, using fuzzy logic to model customer requirements, process queries flexibly and ranking results...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} a three-layer supply chain with a manufacturer, a reseller, and a <b>sales</b> <b>agent.</b> The demand is stochastically {{determined by the}} random market condition and the <b>sales</b> <b>agent's</b> private effort level. Although the manufacturer is uninformed about the market condition, the reseller and the <b>sales</b> <b>agent</b> conduct demand forecasting and generate private demand signals. Under this framework with two levels of adverse selection intertwined with moral hazard, we study {{the impact of the}} reseller's and the <b>sales</b> <b>agent's</b> forecasting accuracy on the profitability of each member. We show that the manufacturer's profitability is convex on the reseller's forecasting accuracy. From the manufacturer's perspective, typically improving the reseller's accuracy is detrimental when the accuracy is low but is beneficial when it is high. We identify the concrete interrelation among the manufacturer-optimal reseller's accuracy, the volatility of the market condition, and the <b>sales</b> <b>agent's</b> accuracy. Finally, the manufacturer's interest may be aligned with the reseller's when only the reseller can choose her accuracy; this alignment is never possible when both downstream players have the discretion to choose their accuracy. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R
