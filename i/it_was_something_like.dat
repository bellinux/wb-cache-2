He has invented a frequency generator which causes these people to crystallize and then explode. In one of the best scenes all season, Walter and Astrid are in the lab and, using a watermelon for their experiments, are able to determine the exact frequency that the villain’s generator operates on. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> 68.7 megacycles (I don’t recall exactly), so I used the signal generator plugin and created some tones that started out as 68.7 megacycles. They were simply low-frequency tones on their own so I processed them so that they warbled and chorused and were a bit more mysterious than the straight tone. It ended up being pretty subtle for television, but when Walter identifies the tone as a certain frequency, that’s what’s actually playing." ...|$|E

According to Kennedy's own testimony, he swam across the [...] channel, back to Edgartown and returned to his hotel room, where he removed his clothes and collapsed on his bed. Hearing noises, he later put on dry clothes and asked someone what the time was: <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> 2:30a.m., the senator recalled. He testified that, as the night went on, [...] "I almost tossed and turned and walked around that room.... I had not given up hope all night long that, by some miracle, Mary Jo would have escaped from the car." ...|$|E

6000|$|She {{advanced}} with a courtesy, at {{the same}} time affectionately taking the thin white hand stretched out to her. [...] "I hope you <b>are</b> better, ma'am. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> old times to have you here again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> that," [...] she remarked. [...] "Supposing I had not {{happened}} to discover you, I {{wonder how long}} you would have gone on?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, by G-d, no {{more than}} yourself, but I won't. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> that stopped all the trade fifteen or twenty years ago. You {{have heard of the}} Loup?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not perfectly, sir; but, if I am not mistaken, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> this: you hoped {{you did not}} {{distrust}} the creature; {{for that}} would imply distrust of the Creator." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My aunt {{does not}} like my staying; I can see that; and I don't think <b>it</b> <b>is</b> fair to do so while {{she does not know}} all about <b>it.</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> {{cheating}} her out of the use of the house." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I confess," [...] said Lydgate, smiling, [...] "amusement {{is rather}} an {{unsatisfactory}} prescription. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> telling {{people to keep}} up their spirits. Perhaps I had better say, that you must submit to be mildly bored rather than to go on working." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think {{something}}," [...] he said, [...] "that I cannot say clearly. Or, rather, I {{think something}} that I cannot even think clearly. But <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> this. My early life, as you know, {{was a bit}} too large and loose.|$|R
6000|$|... “I {{was looking}} at the chart the last day I was on board, sir, and I noticed that Timor lay to the south of where we were then, and I should say <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> six or seven hundred miles away.” ...|$|E
60|$|I {{bought two}} post cards and wrote {{them out of}} doors in the cold, livid twilight. Then I asked a soldier where was the post-office. He {{directed}} me. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> sending post cards from Skegness or Bognor, there in the post-office.|$|E
60|$|VENABLES. In {{the first}} speech <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> this--'Gentlemen, the Opposition are calling {{to you to}} vote for them and the flowing tide, but I solemnly warn you to beware lest the flowing tide does not engulf you.' The second way is much better.|$|E

6000|$|... "Not in the least," [...] Vine answered. [...] "You see <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> this. You {{know that}} since I became editor and part {{proprietor}} of the Post I have tried {{to take up a}} strong position with regard to our modern commercial methods." ...|$|R

"If I ask the farmer, the manufacturer, the merchant, the tradesman, {{and down}} {{through all the}} occupations of life to the common laborer, what service monarchy is to him, he can give me no answer.

6000|$|Then {{the princess}} took a great silver basin, covered with strange black signs and figures {{raised in the}} silver. She poured water into the basin, and as she poured it she sang the magic spell from the Latin book. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> this, in English: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'And then {{he showed}} me a little carving,' went on Andy, 'that anybody could see was a {{wonderful}} thing. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> 2,000 years old, he said. It was a lotus flower with a woman's face in it carved out of a solid piece of ivory.|$|E
60|$|As {{he spoke}} there reached our ears the first, far-off murmurs of a dreadful music.

50|$|As someone walks {{downhill}} 8 km and 650 m, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> half of Samariá Gorge. But Samariá Gorge is scree {{above the}} river bed, and Imbros Gorge is round scree of the dry creek bed. The trail is still strenuous, people with over size waist, sandals without socks, and women with elegant shoes covering just their toes, suffer.|$|R
60|$|The shout that Gascoyne uttered {{on hearing}} the young man's voice was almost superhuman. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> a mingled cheer and cry of agony.

6000|$|... "You are a {{beautiful}} creature!" [...] she said, {{in a low}} melodious voice, with syllables which had {{what might be called}} a foreign but agreeable outline. [...] "I knew you would be." [...] Then she kissed him on each cheek, and he returned the kisses. But <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> a greeting between royalties.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I can't tell you," [...] {{said little}} Miss Fuzzy tall, [...] "It wasn't like {{anything}} I ever had heard before. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> {{the voice of}} Hooty the Owl {{and the voice of}} Dippy the Loon and the voice of a little yelping dog all in one, and it was just terrible!" ...|$|E
60|$|Housed and windowpaned from it, the {{greatest}} wonder to little children is the snow. To men, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> a crucible {{in which their}} world melts into a white star ten million miles away.

40|$|In 1913, the National American Woman Suffrage Association {{published}} a broadside by Jane Addams, of about 740 words, titled “Women and Public Housekeeping. ” A broadside is a poster, printed on one side, {{to be distributed}} or hung, and then thrown away. In the contemporary context, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> a flyer, maybe a blog post. In the world of publishing, broadsides are historical “ephemera. ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] he said. [...] "It's {{so hard to}} {{remember}}! <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> this!

6000|$|You had {{to blink}} when looked at it; {{and you heard}} a fizzing sound just like the machine with a [...] "scope" [...] {{at the end of}} it.

6000|$|They {{went down}} softly, Mab and all, nursed up {{the fire that}} Henry had raked out; and if Saturnalia could be held over the writing out of a hymn tune, they did it!

60|$|In all armies {{there are}} men who act with heroic valour and desperate daring. Some are urged thereto by calm {{contempt}} of danger, coupled with {{a strong sense of}} duty. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> this, probably, that induced Skobeleff to expose himself so recklessly on almost all occasions. It was simply despair, coupled with natural lion-like courage, that influenced the wretched scout.|$|E
3000|$|The mothers placed strong {{importance}} {{on the importance}} of the groups for establishing and maintaining support networks.
