5|$|Fairywrens exhibit one of {{the highest}} incidences of extra-pair mating, and many broods are brought up a by male who is not the natural father. However, {{courtship}} methods among white-winged fairywrens remain unclear. Blue-plumaged males have been seen outside of their territory and in some cases, carrying pink or purple petals, which among other species advertise the male to neighboring females. In contrast, black-plumaged males on Barrow and Dirk Hartog islands often carry blue petals. While petal-carrying outside of clan territories strongly suggests mating with other females <b>is</b> <b>occurring,</b> further genetic analysis is necessary.|$|E
5|$|Looking {{directly}} at the photosphere of the Sun (the bright disk of the Sun itself), even {{for just a few}} seconds, can cause permanent damage to the retina of the eye, because of the intense visible and invisible radiation that the photosphere emits. This damage can result in impairment of vision, up to and including blindness. The retina has no sensitivity to pain, and the effects of retinal damage may not appear for hours, so there is no warning that injury <b>is</b> <b>occurring.</b>|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{observe the}} {{clinical}} effect of Ex-press glaucoma filtration device implantation under scleral flap for traumatic glaucoma. METHODS: Totally 19 eyes of 19 patients with traumatic glaucoma were implanted with Ex-press glaucoma filtration device under the scleral flap from December 2012 to May 2013. The postoperative visual acuity, anterior chamber depth and hyphema,intraocular pressure(IOP), filtering bleb and other complications were observed and summarized. RESULTS: Ex-press glaucoma filtration device were implanted successfully in 19 patients. At 1 d postoperatively shallow anterior chamber <b>was</b> <b>occurred</b> in 2 eyes and hyphema <b>was</b> <b>occurred</b> in 3 eyes. At 3 mo postoperatively increased vision <b>was</b> <b>occurred</b> in 9 eyes(47 %),functional filtering bleb <b>was</b> <b>occurred</b> in 18 eyes(95 %),and IOP was 12. 1 ± 6. 1 mmHg. At 6 mo postoperatively increased vision <b>was</b> <b>occurred</b> in 11 eyes(58 %),functional filtering bleb <b>was</b> <b>occurred</b> in 18 eyes(95 %),and IOP was 13. 3 ± 6. 9 mmHg.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends polio vaccination boosters for travelers and those who live in countries where the disease <b>is</b> <b>occurring.</b> Once infected there is no specific treatment. In 2016, polio affected 42 people, while there were about 350,000 cases in 1988. In 2014 the disease was only spreading between people in Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan. In 2015 Nigeria had stopped the spread of wild poliovirus but it reoccurred in 2016.|$|E
5|$|White roofs: Painting rooftops {{white has}} become a common {{strategy}} to reduce the heat island effect.

5|$|Constant {{pressure}} charts normally contain plotted {{values of}} temperature, humidity, wind, and the vertical height {{above sea level}} of the pressure surface. They {{have a variety of}} uses. In the mountainous terrain of the western United States and Mexican Plateau, the 850 hPa pressure surface can be a more realistic depiction of the weather pattern than a standard surface analysis. Using the 850 and 700 hPa pressure surfaces, one can determine when and where warm advection (coincident with upward vertical motion) and cold advection (coincident with downward vertical motion) <b>is</b> <b>occurring</b> within the lower portions of the troposphere. Areas with small dewpoint depressions and are below freezing indicate the presence of icing conditions for aircraft. The 500 hPa pressure surface {{can be used as a}} rough guide for the motion of many tropical cyclones. Shallower tropical cyclones, which have experienced vertical wind shear, tend to be steered by winds at the 700 hPa level.|$|E

5|$|Decline in age, size during sexual {{maturity}} in {{great northern tilefish}} population <b>is</b> <b>occurring</b> throughout the continental shelf. In the mid-Atlantic Bight, smaller sizes and younger ages at maturity were observed in 2008, compared to the survey data from the 1980s where recorded measurements showed a larger population. The recent estimates of age and size at maturity in the southern U.S. waters were smaller than those previously reported in the late 1980s. There were also very few juvenile tilefish seen in tilefish population surveys in the southern U.S. waters in both the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. Declines in population could negatively affect other organisms in their surrounding environment {{due to the fact}} that without tilefish, the burrows underneath the continental shelf will disappear, therefore putting an end to the symbiotic relationship with other organisms that use the tunnels as shelter.|$|E
5|$|Western Australia {{banned the}} import of common {{starlings}} in 1895. New flocks arriving from the east are routinely shot, while the less cautious juveniles are trapped and netted. New methods are being developed, such as tagging one bird and tracking it back to establish where {{other members of the}} flock roost. Another technique is to analyse the DNA of Australian common starling populations to track where the migration from eastern to western Australia <b>is</b> <b>occurring</b> so that better preventive strategies can be used. By 2009, only 300 common starlings were left in Western Australia, and the state committed a further A$400,000 in that year to continue the eradication programme.|$|E
5|$|Macrolide antibiotics, such as erythromycin, are an {{effective}} treatment for DPB when taken regularly {{over an extended}} period of time. Clarithromycin or roxithromycin are also commonly used. The successful results of macrolides in DPB and similar lung diseases stems from managing certain symptoms through immunomodulation (adjusting the immune response), which can be achieved by taking the antibiotics in low doses. Treatment consists of daily oral administration of erythromycin for two to three years, an extended period that has been shown to dramatically improve the effects of DPB. This is apparent when an individual undergoing treatment for DPB, among a number of disease-related remission criteria, has a normal neutrophil count detected in BAL fluid, and blood gas (an arterial blood test that measures the amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood) readings show that free oxygen in the blood is within the normal range. Allowing a temporary break from erythromycin therapy in these instances has been suggested, to reduce the formation of macrolide-resistant P.aeruginosa. However, DPB symptoms usually return, and treatment would need to be resumed. Although highly effective, erythromycin may not prove successful in all individuals with the disease, particularly if macrolide-resistant P.aeruginosa is present or previously untreated DPB has progressed to the point where respiratory failure <b>is</b> <b>occurring.</b>|$|E
