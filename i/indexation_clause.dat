We first look into the optimal degree of indexation and then {{its effect on the}} business cycle. We have found that the optimal degree of indexation is around 50 % with little vatiation with the contract length.

40|$|Throughout all the {{chapters}} we have considered some union variables (particularly {{the proportion of}} workers representatives belonging to a given union) to capture any difference in bargaining power amongst unions. Concerning wage increases, we have not found any systematic difference amongst them in chapter 4 and {{we have found that}} regional unions obtain lower increases in chapter 5. Concerning wage levels (chapter 3) we have found that the variable representing the UGT union is associated with lower wage and higher employment levels. Jointly, they seem to suggest that the CCOO union adds more pressure to the bargaining process than other unionsThe effect of the strike variables on wage outcomes have been considered throughout chapters 3 (on wage levels) and 5 (on wage increases). In both chapters the set of strike variables have been found relevant (being the services wage equation an exception). However, whilst for services theestimated effect is of the same sign, for the manufacturing evidence is contradictory. In particular, for the latter sector, wage increase analysis suggests a negative relationship among wage increases and strike length. Onthe contrary, wage levels analysis suggests a positive relationship. Our suggestion for further work is to consider more carefully the specification of the set of strike variables, specially strike costs. As major conclusions on the wage setting process in Spain we would like to stress the implicit sequential bargaining structure and the extreme importance of aggregate setting. The first step of the implicit sequence is the wage increase setting, closely linked to aggregate setting (industry orupper) and to the achievement of the <b>indexation</b> <b>clause.</b> The second step, in which there is the bargaining over wage complements and the compensation for the expected productivity increase, is more closely related to the performance of the firm. Finally, we would like to remark that aggregate factors have a much greater influence in wage setting than the specific conditions of the firm. This structure can have several consequences. For instance, in an economy with null or small labour force mobility (as in Spain) the pressure of unit labour cost will squeeze out of the market, sooner or later, a significant number of firms...|$|E
30|$|Next, I examine real wage cyclicality {{for workers}} under {{different}} contract types. Rows (4) and (5) in Table 3 show that wage cyclicality of workers under a temporary contract exceeds that of workers under a permanent contract {{by a factor}} of two. Workers under permanent contracts enjoy higher levels of employment protection {{and are more likely to}} benefit from collective agreements that include wage <b>indexation</b> <b>clauses.</b> In contrast, workers with temporary contracts face a much higher level of real wage cyclicality that is similar to workers in countries with more flexible labour markets.|$|R

40|$|We {{provide a}} model which {{analyzes}} {{the effect on}} equilibrium inflation of different degrees of labor-market indexation. We show that time-inconsistency models cannot account fully for the stylized fact of policy-makers distaste for <b>indexation</b> <b>clauses.</b> In our model the Central Bank and the government interact, pressed by lobbying groups for redistribution through unexpected inflation. We find that inflation increased as indexation increases. The cornerstone of our model is that indexation changes the incentives of the various interest groups that press the government thereby changing the equilibrium inflation rate. A corollary of our model is that Central Bank independence {{is going to be}} successful only in societies with anti-inflationary preferences, reversing the traditional causality from independence to inflation...|$|R
30|$|Spain is a {{suitable}} scenario to evaluate real wage cyclicality within a much rigid labour market. The Spanish system of collective bargaining {{is based on}} two principles that deter firms from adjusting wages along the business cycle. The first principle automatically extends any collective agreement {{beyond the scope of}} a firm to all workers in the same sector and province, even if they had not participated in the bargaining process. The second principle secures the validity of collective agreements after their expiration. Likewise, a large share of agreements (more than 60  %) include <b>indexation</b> <b>clauses</b> which trigger high inertia in firms’ wage-setting decisions. Lastly, duality in the labour market insulates workers under permanent contracts (around 67 – 70  % of the workforce with high levels of employment protection) from business cycle fluctuations.|$|R
3000|$|... [...]) {{does not}} have a {{straightforward}} interpretation, even if the IWFP methodology named it “expected inflation rate” and its range is linked to past and present values of the inflation rate. It can also reflect collective bargaining wage agreements, legal minimum wages and automatic <b>indexation</b> <b>clauses.</b> If institutional rigidities {{play a significant role in}} the wage-setting process, distinguishing the different types of rigidity - nominal, real and institutional - becomes extremely difficult. If the reference values for collective bargain and/or minimum wages are similar to the expected inflation rate, the IWFP real rigidity measure will reflect both “strictly” real and institutional rigidities. This fact can be especially relevant in a country like Portugal, that besides having a restrictive job protection legislation for permanent contracts, has a high degree of centralisation in collective bargaining with widespread extension mechanisms and national mandatory minimum wages.|$|R
30|$|The {{system of}} {{collective}} bargaining in Spain {{can be characterized}} by its large scope, intermediate degree of centralization, substantial inertia in wage indexation and homogeneity in wage setting decisions. The rate of coverage reaches more than 80  % of private sector workers despite a low rate of unionization below 15  %. This disparity in rates is sustained, of course, by the principle of automatic effectiveness. The bargaining process takes place mainly at the sectoral level within a provincial scope—only less than 15  % of workers are subject to a firm agreement, which are frequent in large firms and negligible in firms with fewer than 200 workers. The high rate of inertia in wages {{is reflected in the}} large share of agreements (between 60 and 70  %) that incorporate <b>indexation</b> <b>clauses.</b> Collective agreements last around 2.5 years—a long duration similar to those of Scandinavian countries—and include annual wage setting policies and protection clauses in case of deviations from the inflation rate of reference.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the consequences of}} large-scale debt relief during the Great Depression {{in order to examine}} theories of debt overhang and the costs of bankruptcy. When the U. S. went off the gold standard and devalued the dollar with respect to gold, the government declared that the courts would no longer enforce gold <b>indexation</b> <b>clauses</b> which appeared in virtually all long-term private and public debts up to that time. If the gold clauses had been enforced, the debt burden of borrowers would have increased by the extent of the devaluation, which was 69 percent. I examine asset price responses to the Supreme Court’s decision to uphold this effective debt jubilee. Equity prices rise, but more surprisingly, the debt relief also led to higher prices for corporate bonds (all of which contained gold clauses). In contrast, government bonds with gold clauses fall in value. These responses suggest that the benefits of eliminating debt overhang and avoiding bankruptcy for private firms more than offset the loss to creditors of some chance of trying to recover the additional 69 percent. Consistent with large costs of debt overhang and bankruptcy, in the cross section, stock and bond prices of firms closer to bankruptcy rose more than other firms. The results suggest that in these circumstances it is indeed better to forgive than to receive...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explains}} prices, {{output and}} employment adjustment Ifl an open economy {{characterized by a}} monopolistic competitive market structure where goods prices are flexible while wages are determined by contracts that pre-set the wage path for several periods. The paper solves the rational expectation equilibrium In an economy characterized by staggered. unsynchronized wage negotiation, for which the degree ol contract staggering is endogenously determined. it investigates the adjustment of output. exchange rate and prices to nominal and real shocks, {{and to what extent}} that adjustment depends on the market power enjoyed by each producer and the substitutability between domestic and foreign goods. It also studies the potential role of <b>indexation</b> <b>clauses,</b> like wage <b>indexatiOn</b> to nominal income. The analysis shows that unexpected monetary shocks can generate persistent aggregate output and relative price shocks, whose nature is determined by the degree of substitutability between domestic and foreign goods. Greater substitutability induces a greater output and employment effects and smaller prices effects in the short and the intermediate run. On the other hand, greater substitutability iS shown to reduce the persistency and duration of the adjustment. If the income elasticity of the demand for money is less than unity the presence of nominal wage contracts tends to magnify the responsiveness of the economy to real shocks. and a larger degree of substitutability will magnify the short-run and the intermediate—run adjustmen...|$|R
40|$|Analysing {{annual data}} on union membership, the authors examine the short- and {{long-term}} determinants of union growth and decline in post-war Europe. Using fixed effect estimates of an error correction model {{on a panel}} of fourteen countries, the authors incorporate structural, cyclical and institutional determinants. The {{results suggest that the}} common trend of union decline during the 1980 s and 1990 s is largely endogenous to labour market changes, the impact of which is mediated by a specific set of labour market institutions. In Europe, union density rates declined because unemployment increased, newcomers in the labour force were recruited or sorted into jobs and workplaces less covered by unions, inflation decreased and/or <b>indexation</b> <b>clauses</b> were dismantled, replacement rates were lowered, public employment shrank and strike activity declined. This accounts for diverging density rates across European countries, {{as well as for the}} aggregate downward cycle after 1980. ♣ Daniele Checchi is professor of labour economics at the University of Milan, Italy, Department of Economics and Faculty of Political Sciences, Jelle Visser is scientific director of the Amsterdam Institute for Advanced Labour Studies (AIAS) and professor of sociology of labour and organization at the University of Amsterdam.

40|$|Motivation. The {{paper will}} {{address the issue of}} {{estimating}} the uncertainty in the run off of individual large claims in insurance portfolios, which is often the primary source of uncertainty in the reserving risk component of insurance risk. Method. The paper begins by reviewing current methodologies for estimating the uncertainty in loss reserves. Methods until now have focused on aggregate modeling of gross or net of reinsurance loss reserves, and no direct connection between the distribution of gross and net reserves. The paper develops a non-parametric framework to simulate the distribution of ultimate position of large claims, both reported and large IBNR claims. The method samples the development of individual claims based on the historic development of large claims, incorporating information at an aggregate level surrounding reserving strength. The model also predicts when claims will setde, and the dining of claim payments. Results. The method developed is not intended to replace existing aggregate modeling, but is an improvement to traditional methods which estimate the variability of gross of reinsurance loss reserves, and is a useful tool to allow for reinsurance recoveries more accurately. By indix 4 dually projecting the ultimate position of large claims, we can explicidy allow for policy or contract limits. Further, we can apply any reinsurance program structure to the gross results, including allowance for aggregate deductibles, incomplete placements, retrocessions to captive reinsurers, <b>indexation</b> <b>clauses,</b> and different treat 3, attachment rules (ie Losses Occurring During vs Risks Attaching). The paper then shows how the variability of attritional claims can be estimated using traditional stochastic methods, and the attritional and large results can be combined to estimate the variability of the aggregate portfolio of loss reserves...|$|R
40|$|An indexed unit of {{account is}} a unit of {{measurement}} defined using an index such as a consumer price index so that prices, wages or deferred payments {{defined in terms of}} these units will automatically adjust to changing economic conditions. Evidence on money illusion and sticky prices, and evidence from countries (notably Chile) that have created indexed units of account, suggests that creating such indexed units is an important policy option for governments in countries with unstable prices or incomes. Choices for governments designing indexed units of account are discussed. Governments may choose to encourage the use of the units only for large long-deferred non-wage payments, or they may choose to go to the opposite extreme of encouraging the use of the units for defining all prices, wages and payments. A general equilibrium model is given that shows the dynamics of prices when all prices are expressed in the units. Governments may choose to link units to a consumer price index or to a per capita income index, and there may be advantages to creating both kinds of units simultaneously. Downward rigidity of real wages might be reduced if wages are denominated in base-income-indexed units of account, where base income is defined so that the growth rate in money value of the unit is biased down relative to actual per capita income growth. Examples of the units for United States are displayed and discussed.

40|$|Hakhun Tangsa is one {{of around}} eighty ethnic and {{linguistic}} communities called Tangsa or Tangshang. Hakhuns live mostly in Arunachal Pradesh, India, and in Sagaing Division, Myanmar. The number of speakers is estimated at around ten thousand. Hakhun is a Tibeto-Burman language, and it forms a subgroup with Nocte, Wancho, Phom, Konyak, Chang, and Khiamngan called Konyak or Northern Naga. Hakhun is a tonal language with twenty-two consonants, six vowels, and a simple syllable structure. Open word classes include Nouns and Verbs; property concept terms form a subclass of verbs. Noun roots are mostly monosyllabic, and most multisyllabic nouns are compounds. Nominal morphology includes prossessive prefixes {{and a set of}} semantically specific suffixes. Case is coded by postpositions. Verb roots are also mostly monosyllabic. A few verbs have suppletive stems. Verb serialization is common, and expresses complex events like resultative and sequential. A few grammaticalized verbs/elements contribute abstract meanings like phase, associated motion, causative, benefactive, etc. Typical verbal categories are expressed by independent particles. The most extensive and grammatically obligatory set consists of single syllable particles called operators, which express verbal categories like tense, mood, deixis, negation, inverse, and argument indexation. The typical argument indexation pattern is hierarchical. Deviations from this pattern is used to express certain pragmatic effects like affectedness and politeness. Non-verbal clauses may take overt copulas depending on tense and polarity. Most semantic distinctions, such as equation, property-concepts, quantification, simulation, and location are expressed by the nominal strategy. Existential and possession are expressed by a distinct strategy. Typical verbal clauses include intransitive, transitive, and ditransitive; less typical ones include weather condition, sensation-emotion, reflexive, reciprocal, and ‘need’ constructions. Person-based split-ergativity is seen in case marking, where first and second person singular arguments follow accusative, and the rest ergative alignment. Accusative alignment is also found in argument <b>indexation</b> in non-final <b>clauses.</b> The object alignment is indirective in case marking. Complement clauses include sentence-like, non-finite, and infinitive complement clauses. Adverbial clauses include various kinds of temporal clauses, temporal/conditional clauses, counterfactual, concessive, purpose, and substitutive clauses. Clause chaining (medial-final) is prevalent. Independent sentences are linked through tail-head linking and through connectives...|$|R
