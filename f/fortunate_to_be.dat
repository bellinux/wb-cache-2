5|$|Arriving in Iaşi (Jassy) in 1876, Goldfaden was <b>fortunate</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{better known}} as a good poet — many of whose poems had been set to music and had become popular songs — than as a less-than-successful businessman. Nevertheless, when he sought funds from Isaac Librescu for another newspaper, Librescu was uninterested in that proposition. Librescu's wife remarked that Yiddish-language journalism was {{just a way to}} starve; she {{suggested}} {{that there would be a}} lot more of a market for Yiddish-language theater. Librescu offered Goldfaden 100 francs for a public recital of his songs in the garden of Shimen Mark, Grădina Pomul Verde ("the Green Fruit-Tree Garden").|$|E
5|$|Hartmann, a pre-war glider pilot, {{joined the}} Luftwaffe in 1940 and {{completed}} his fighter pilot training in 1942. He was posted to Jagdgeschwader 52 (JG52) on the Eastern Front and was <b>fortunate</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{placed under the}} supervision of some of the Luftwaffes most experienced fighter pilots. Under their guidance, Hartmann steadily developed his tactics, which earned him the coveted Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds on 25 August 1944 for claiming 301 aerial victories. At the time of its presentation to Hartmann, this was Germany's highest military decoration.|$|E

The series took place at Sharjah due to security reasons and in the 2nd Test Ganga made 65 in the first innings.|$|E

25|$|The green {{background}} {{is synonymous with}} the county of Dorset and maintains our identity as a green and pleasant land. The yellow cross depicts the beautiful beaches we are <b>fortunate</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> blessed with. The oak leaf signifies the rural nature of this wonderful county, something most people living here are very proud of. The black border around the yellow cross signifies the black death that came to our shores and nearly wiped out the population but through our resilience as a people we overcame that threat and made us the proud people we are today.|$|E
25|$|In {{the town}} of Safed, the homes on the hill were built {{in such a way}} that the roofs of the houses below became the streets for the ones above; the {{cascading}} style of construction was many layers deep, and when the earthquake happened, the homes collapsed onto one another from above. Many people were killed immediately and buried under the rubble, and some were <b>fortunate</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> alive yet could not extricate themselves quickly from the debris. Some survivors were pulled from the ruins as many as six or seven days after the earthquake. The wounded and dying there were without much relief until January 19 when a temporary hospital was set up and a doctor hired who could distribute medicine and apply bandages.|$|E

25|$|Parma {{opened the}} last Serie A weekend of February away to Genoa, who {{were led by}} Pasquale Marino, the coach who took charge of much of Parma's 2010–11 season. With neither side having scored since 5 February, it was a {{surprise}} when the scoring was opened so easrly in the game; Massimo Gobbi swept home {{from the edge of the}} area after just five minutes. Giovinco then had what looked like a fair goal ruled out for offside just before half-time. Parma did get their second goal after the break after a brilliant run from Jonathan Biabiany ended in a Giovinco chance with the follow-up falling to Sergio Floccari, who converted against his former employees. With just over ten minutes to go, Genoa were very <b>fortunate</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> given a penalty for Francesco Modesto's accidental handball inside the area; Rodrigo Palacio tapped in after Mirante's save. Genoa then should have had a penalty after a reckless Modesto challenged went unpunished. The referee inexplicably allowed 7 minutes of injury time; Palacio used the sixth to break the offside trap and slot home to level the score and earn a point for his team.|$|E
25|$|Karadžić was <b>fortunate</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a {{relative}} of Jevta Savić Čotrić, the only literate person in the area at the time, who {{taught him how to}} read and write. Karadžić continued his education in the Tronoša Monastery in Loznica. As a boy he learned calligraphy there, using a reed instead of a pen and a solution of gunpowder for ink. In lieu of proper writing paper he was lucky if he could get cartridge wrappings. Throughout the whole region, regular schooling was not widespread at that time and his father at first did not allow him to go to Austria. Since most of the time while in the monastery Karadžić was forced to pasture the livestock instead of studying, his father brought him back home. Meanwhile, the First Serbian Uprising seeking to overthrow the Ottomans began in 1804. After unsuccessful attempts to enroll in the gymnasium at Sremski Karlovci, for which 19-year-old Karadžić was too old, Karadžić left for Petrinja where he spent a few months learning Latin and German. Later on, he left for Belgrade, {{now in the hands of}} the Revolutionary Serbia, in order to meet the highly respected scholar Dositej Obradović, and ask him to support his studies. Unfortunately, Obradović dismissed him. Disappointed, Karadžić left for Jadar and began working as a scribe for Jakov Nenadović. After the founding of the Belgrade Higher School, Karadžić became one of its first students.|$|E

It was restored {{to him when}} Elizabeth I came to the throne in 1558. Rudston had the first parts of the current house built circa 156775 as an extension to an earlier house to the west.|$|E

Leslie crashes the date to help Ann persuade Chris to increase the parks budget, but to her surprise, Ben also arrives, having predicted Leslie's plan. The four end up taking their date to a gay bar called The Bulge, where Chris tells Leslie he will consider increasing the parks budget.

Later, however, Ann apologizes to Chris and asks for another date, to which he happily agrees.|$|E
500|$|By November 1962 Starr {{had been}} {{accepted}} by Beatles fans, who were now calling {{for him to}} sing songs. Soon afterwards, he began receiving an amount of fan mail {{equal to that of}} the others, which helped to secure his position within the band. Starr considered himself <b>fortunate</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> on the same [...] "wavelength" [...] as the other Beatles: [...] "I had to be, or I wouldn't have lasted. I had to join them as people [...] as well as [...] a drummer." [...] He was given a small percentage of Lennon and McCartney's publishing company, Northern Songs, but he derived his primary income during this period from a one-quarter share of Beatles Ltd, a corporation financed by the band's net concert earnings. He commented on the nature of his lifestyle after having achieved success with the Beatles: [...] "I lived in nightclubs for three years. It used to be a non-stop party." [...] Like his father Starr became well known for his late-night dancing and he received considerable praise for his skills.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} filmed {{over a number}} of afternoons at the end of 2007, with each day's filming {{beginning}} with a repeat of the last section from the previous day, to help blend each scene into the next. It was filmed with a [...] "single camera mentality" [...] but with up to five cameras running to give Brown a [...] "freedom of performance away from hitting marks or favouring one particular camera position." [...] This also helped in the case of technical problems, meaning that second takes were not necessary. Brown cried when she read the script and though she did not cry during fiming, she had expected to, planning to pause the tape recorder if she did. She stated that {{the most difficult part of}} the script was the line about Jim being [...] "here, but not here" [...] because she felt that way about Bardon. Arnold admitted to [...] " [...] away the tears" [...] many times and noted that several other crew cried, and that one of the toughest things about it was that it mirrored real-life events. Brown found the episode easy to film due to the fact there were no other cast members to make mistakes, and because she [...] "knew the character backwards" [...] and [...] "exactly how she'd behave and what she'd feel and [...] her history." [...] She praised Arnold and the crew, stating that the episode was [...] "lovely" [...] to make and she felt [...] "very <b>fortunate</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> given the opportunity." [...] The performance was edited in post production after being committed to tape, where usually all scenes are vision mixed, and the usual EastEnders theme tune was replaced at the end of the episode with Tony Jackson's [...] "Pretty Baby".|$|E
