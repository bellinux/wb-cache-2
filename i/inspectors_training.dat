40|$|It is indubitable that {{usability}} {{inspection of}} complex hypermedia {{is still an}} "art", {{in the sense that}} a great deal is left to the skills, experience, and ability of the <b>inspectors.</b> <b>Training</b> inspectors is difficult and often quite expensive. The SUE inspection technique has been proposed to help usability inspectors share and transfer their evaluation know-how, to simplify the hypermedia inspection process for newcomers, and to achieve more effective and efficient evaluation results. SUE inspection is based on the use of evaluation patterns, called Abstract Tasks, which precisely describe the activities to be performed by evaluators during inspection. This paper highlights the advantages of this inspection technique, by presenting its empirical validation through a controlled experiment. Two groups of novice inspectors have been asked to evaluate a commercial hypermedia CD-ROM applying the SUE inspection or the traditional heuristic evaluation. The comparison was based on three major dimensions: effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction. Results have shown a clear advantage of the SUE inspection over the traditional inspection on all dimensions, demonstrating that Abstract Tasks are efficient tools to drive the evaluator's performance...|$|E

40|$|The {{reform of}} the school {{inspection}} system in Poland has introduced the idea of evaluation to Polish schools. Probably {{the most important element}} of that reform is the new system of <b>training</b> school <b>inspectors</b> responsible for the external evaluation of schools. More than three years of experience with that new training system shows that still {{there is a lot of}} confusion concerning the understanding of the evaluation process among school <b>inspectors</b> <b>trained</b> for evaluation system. The authors claim that this is the most important obstacle in promoting evaluation as a crucial element in the process of school development and the main reason for the mistakes and problems that the new school evaluation system is facing. The paper presents an attempt to describe different understandings of school evaluation among school inspectors and to show the impact that those understandings may have on the process of the introduction of evaluation to the Polish school system. To find out what is the understanding of evaluation, the authors used the concept of metaphor, assuming that metaphors can help to explore unknown understandings better than more traditional methods. School <b>inspectors</b> <b>trained</b> to serve the role of ‘evaluators’ within the new inspection system were asked to finish in a few words the sentence: Evaluation is like…. The metaphors used by inspectors were then categorized and thinking about evaluation connected with certain types of metaphors was characterized. The paper gives deeper description of those different understandings, trying at the same time to show how they can influence practice of evaluators during external evaluation process that takes part in schools. The authors claim that good understanding of different ways of thinking about evaluation gained through analysis of metaphors used by inspectors can be a very good basis for drawing some recommendations for those responsible for the system of <b>training</b> <b>inspectors</b> for evaluation as well as for policy makers responsible for changes in the school inspection system in Poland and in other countries...|$|R

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "State-run programs face several challenges that primarily relate to staffing, and include having constrained budgets, according to OSHA and state officials. States have difficulty filling vacant <b>inspector</b> positions, obtaining <b>training</b> for <b>inspectors,</b> and retaining qualified inspectors. Recruiting inspectors is difficult due to the shortage of qualified candidates, relatively low state salaries, and hiring freezes. Although OSHA has taken steps to make its courses more accessible to states, obtaining <b>inspector</b> <b>training</b> continues to be difficult. According to an agency official, OSHA's Training Institute faces several challenges in delivering training, including recruiting and retaining instructors, difficulty accommodating the demand for training, and limitations in taking some courses to the field due {{to the need for}} special equipment and facilities. These challenges are further exacerbated by states' lack of travel funds, which limit state inspectors' access to OSHA <b>training.</b> Retaining qualified <b>inspectors</b> is another challenge among states. Officials noted that, once state <b>inspectors</b> are <b>trained,</b> they often leave for higher paying positions in the private sector or federal government. GAO's survey of the 22 state-run programs that cover private and public sector workplaces showed that turnover was more prevalent among safety inspectors than health inspectors. Nearly half of these states reported that at least 40 percent of their safety inspectors had fewer than 5 years of service. In contrast, half of the states reported that at least 40 percent of their health inspectors had more than 10 years of service. These staffing challenges have limited the capacity of some state-run programs to meet their inspection goals. ...|$|R
