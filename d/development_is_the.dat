5|$|A {{more recent}} <b>development</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{electric}} action which uses low voltage DC {{to control the}} key and/or stop mechanisms. Electricity may control the action indirectly through air pressure valves (pneumatics), {{in which case the}} action is electro-pneumatic. In such actions, an electromagnet attracts a small pilot valve which lets wind go to a bellows ("pneumatic") which opens the pallet. When electricity operates the action directly without the assistance of pneumatics, it is commonly referred to as direct electric action. In this type, the electromagnet's armature carries a disc pallet.|$|E
5|$|A recent <b>development</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{use of the}} RDS {{system of}} car radios. The {{ambulance}} is fitted with a short range FM transmitter, set to RDS code 31, which interrupts the radio of all cars within range, {{in the manner of}} a traffic broadcast, but in such a way that the user of the receiving radio is unable to opt out of the message (as with traffic broadcasts). This feature is built into every RDS radio for use in national emergency broadcast systems, but short range units on emergency vehicles can prove an effective means of alerting traffic to their presence. It is, however, unlikely that this system could replace audible warnings, as it is unable to alert pedestrians, those not using a compatible radio or even have it turned off.|$|E
5|$|Human {{activity}} {{is arguably the}} main reason for the population decline of the Puerto Rican amazon. Early settlers of Puerto Rico, such as the Taíno, hunted it for food consumption but managed to maintain a healthy ecological balance. Later, habitat destruction, capture of immature individuals for the pet industry, hunting and predation contributed to the sharp population decline. The clearing of mature forests for agricultural <b>development</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> main reason for the decline of population.|$|E

5|$|Tooth <b>development</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{complex process}} by which teeth form from {{embryonic}} cells, grow, and erupt into the mouth. Although many diverse species have teeth, their development is largely {{the same as in}} humans. For human teeth to have a healthy oral environment, enamel, dentin, cementum, and the periodontium must all develop during appropriate stages of fetal development. Primary teeth start to form {{in the development of the}} embryo between the sixth and eighth weeks, and permanent teeth begin to form in the twentieth week. If teeth do not start to develop at or near these times, they will not develop at all.|$|E

25|$|The most {{prominent}} <b>development</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> reduction of attributive -naru to -na. When the conclusive and attributive merge, they both share the new -na.

25|$|Based on {{the model}} of European states, it has been {{commonly}} assumed that <b>development</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> natural path that states will eventually walk through.

States that struggle their consolidation could remain permanently weak.|$|E
25|$|The {{downside}} of this <b>development</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> ecological damage {{due to the}} low standards of production and excessive sizes of dams (the bigger projects were favoured by the industrial authorities and received more funding), the increased humidity sharpened the already hard climate.
