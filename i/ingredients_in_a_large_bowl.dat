Strong, electromagnetic and weak interactions (fusion, exchange reactions, photodisintegrations, beta-decays, electron [and positron] captures on nucleons and nuclei, neutrino scattering and captures [i. e. neutral and charged current reactions]) can produce nuclei far form stability and require extended knowledge of nuclear structure near and far from stability, including decay and fission properties. Last, but not least, the nucleon-nucleon interaction determines the nuclear equation of state at and beyond nuclear densities and is ultimately connected to the question under which conditions a phase transitions from hadrons to the quark-gluon plasma occurs. In this review we will survey how these aspects of nuclear physics enter the modeling of astrophysical objects...|$|R
40|$|Glycyrrhizae Radix called "Gancao" in Chinese, most {{of which}} {{is derived from the}} root or rhizome (stolon) of Glycyrrhiza plants of the family Leguminosae, has been used as <b>a</b> harmonizing <b>ingredient</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> number of Chinese {{traditional}} prescriptions. In order to develop a sirnple method for histological identification of Glycyrrhizae Radix, a comparative anatomical study and TLC analysis were carried out on the roots and rhizomes of G. uralensis, G. glabra, G. inflata, G. eurycarpa, G. aspera, G. yunnanensis, G. pallithflola and Sophora alopecuroides. As a result, eight species could be distinguished from one another by distinct characteristics such as height and width of multiseriate ray, the amount of xylem fiber, the arrangement of phloem fiber bands, the ratio of xylem to root/rhizome in diameter, etc. and TLC pattern. Based on this result, the botanical origins of commercial samples available in Japanese markets were identified as follows : "Dongbei-Gancao" was derived from G. uralensis or G. glabra, "Xibei-Gancao," G. glabra and "Xinjiang-Gancao," G. inflata...|$|R

The most extreme example is a specialty called focaccia col formaggio ("focaccia with cheese") which is made in Recco, near Genoa. Other than the name, this Recco version bears no resemblance to other focaccia varieties, having a caillé and cheese filling sandwiched between two layers of paper-thin dough.|$|R

For {{a day or two}} previous large supplies of food arrived from the farm and from the markets in the city; and early {{on the morning of the}} entertainment a host of professional cooks arrived to prepare the dinner. The head cooks superintended their labors. The meat consisted of beef and goose, ibex, gazelle, and oryx; for although large flocks of sheep were kept for their wool, the flesh was not eaten by the Egyptians. There were, besides, great numbers of ducks, quails, and other small fowl. The chief cooks superintended the cutting up of the meat and the selection of the different joints for boiling or roasting. One servant worked with his feet a bellows, raising the fire to the required heat; another skimmed the boiling caldrons with a spoon; and a third pounded salt, pepper, and other <b>ingredients</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> mortar. Bakers and confectioners made light bread and pastry; the former being made in the form of rolls, sprinkled at the top with carraway and other seeds. The confectionary was made of fruit and other ingredients mixed with dough, and this was formed by a skillful workman into various artistic shapes, such as recumbent oxen, vases, temples, and other forms. Besides the meats there was an abundance of all the most delicate kinds of fish.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Interactive Hashing has {{featured}} as <b>an</b> essential <b>ingredient</b> <b>in</b> protocols realizing <b>a</b> <b>large</b> {{variety of}} cryptographic tasks, notably Obliv-ious Transfer in the bounded memory model. <b>In</b> Interactive Hashing, <b>a</b> sender transfers a bit string to a receiver such that two strings are re-ceived, the original string {{and a second}} string {{that appears to be}} chosen at random among those distinct from the first. This paper starts by formalizing the notion of Interactive Hashing as a cryptographic primitive, disentangling it from the specifics of its vari-ous implementations. To this end, we present an application-independent set of information theoretic conditions that all Interactive Hashing pro-tocols must ideally satisfy. We then provide a standard implementation of Interactive Hashing and use it to reduce a very standard version of Oblivious Transfer to another one which appears much weaker. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the summer}} of 2011 Germany {{experienced}} one of the <b>largest</b> outbreaks of <b>a</b> food-borne infection caused by enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) with the serotype O 104 :H 4. <b>A</b> <b>large</b> number of cases with bloody diarrhea and haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) occurred. Never before was such {{a high rate of}} HUS cases observed <b>in</b> <b>an</b> outbreak caused by a food-borne pathogen. The events in Germany caused by EHEC O 104 :H 4 in {{the summer of}} 2011 show dramatically how rapidly an infectious agent is able to develop into a major health threat for a whole country. The outbreak caused widespread concern among the population, turning soon into fear. People expecting safe and healthy food felt threatened. It changed the eating habits {{of the majority of the}} population, and it had enormous economic consequences, particularly for farmers producing salad <b>ingredients.</b> It resulted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> number of seriously ill patients and <b>in</b> <b>a</b> substantial number of deaths. The burden of disease and the economic consequences have made it a tragedy for many. It is important to analyse this outbreak scientifically in order to learn from this unique event and to be prepared for comparable infections in the future. In particular, all the steps regarding detection of cases, diagnostic procedures, identification of vehicle and origin, and infection control measures, all the way to therapy, should be reflected carefully. Usually, even experienced physicians encounter only a few cases of EHEC-induced HUS in adults in their whole career. Therefore, the large number of cases <b>in</b> Germany represents <b>a</b> valuable source of information for future epidemics. This manuscript summarises the work of the HUS investigation team of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) and gives an overview of the work done by the colleagues in the Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at the RKI (G. Krause, C. Frank, D. Werber, K. Stark, and U. Buchholz), the Department for Infectious Diseases (M. Mielke and A. Fruth), and the RKI-Consultant Laboratory for HUS/EHEC at the University of Münster (H. Karch). Many additional colleagues were involved...|$|R
40|$|Interactive Hashing has {{featured}} as <b>an</b> essential <b>ingredient</b> <b>in</b> protocols realizing <b>a</b> <b>large</b> {{variety of}} cryptographic tasks. We present {{a study of}} this important cryptographic tool in the information theoretic context. We start by presenting a security definition which is independent of any particular setting or application. We then show that a standard implementation of Interactive Hashing satisfies all the conditions of our definition. Our proof of security improves upon previous ones in several ways. Despite its generality, it is considerably simpler. Moreover, it establishes a tighter upper bound on the cheating probability of a dishonest sender. Specifically, we prove that if the fraction of good strings for a dishonest sender is f, then the probability that both outputs will be good is no larger than 15. 6805 · f. This upper bound is valid for any f and is tight up to a small constant since a sender acting honestly would get two good outputs with probability very close to f. We illustrate the potential of Interactive Hashing as a cryptographic primitive by demonstrating efficient reductions of String Oblivious Transfer with string length k to Bit Oblivious Transfer and several weaker variants. Our reductions incorporate tests based on Interactive Hashing that allow the sender to verify the receiver's adherence to the protocol without compromising the latter's privacy. This allows a much more efficient use of the available entropy without any appreciable impact on security. As a result, for Bit OT {{and most of its}} variants n = (1 + epsilon) k executions suffice, improving efficiency by a factor of two or more compared to the most efficient reductions that do not use Interactive Hashing. As it is theoretically impossible to achieve an expansion factor n/k smaller than 1, our reductions are in fact asymptotically optimal. They are also more general since they place no restrictions on the types of 2 -universal hash families used for Privacy Amplification. Lastly, we present a direct reduction of String OT to Rabin OT which uses similar methods to achieve an expansion factor of 2 + epsilon which is again asymptotically optimal...|$|R
