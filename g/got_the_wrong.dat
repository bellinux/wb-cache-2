25|$|On June 7, 1904, Kid Curry was {{tracked down}} by a posse outside of Parachute, Colorado. Curry and two others had robbed a Denver and Rio Grande train outside Parachute. As they escaped, they stole fresh horses owned by Roll Gardner and a neighbour. The next morning, when they {{discovered}} their horses had been stolen, Gardner and the neighbour set out {{in pursuit of the}} gang. They joined up with a posse and continued tracking the outlaws. The gang shot Gardner's and his neighbour's horses from under them; Gardner found cover while his neighbour started running. Kid Curry took aim at the neighbour and Gardner shot Curry. The wounded Curry decided to end it at that time, and fatally shot himself in the head to avoid capture. The other two robbers escaped. The rifle Gardner used is still in the family today. Rumors persist that Curry was not killed in Parachute and was misidentified, having actually departed for South America with Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Charlie Siringo resigned from the Pinkertons, believing they <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> man.|$|E

500|$|Bakshi had {{originally}} intended to cast Drew Barrymore and Brad Pitt in the film's leading roles. Brad Pitt was cast as Frank Harris instead, with Gabriel Byrne as Deebs and Kim Basinger as Holli. The film's voice cast includes Maurice LaMarche, Charlie Adler and Candi Milo. According to Bakshi, Basinger had attempted to rewrite the film halfway into its production because she [...] "thought {{it would be great}} [...] if {{she would be able to}} show this picture in hospitals to sick children [...] I said, 'Kim, I think that's wonderful, but you've <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> guy to do that with.'

500|$|Contrary to the accusations, {{the band}} have always denied {{the notion that}} they are Satanists, with lead vocalist, Bruce Dickinson, doing so on-stage in the Live After Death concert video. Steve Harris has since commented that, [...] "It was mad. They {{completely}} <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> end of the stick. They obviously hadn't read the lyrics. They just wanted to believe all that rubbish about us being Satanists." [...] Harris has also stated that [...] "The Number of the Beast" [...] song was inspired by a nightmare he had after watching , and also influenced by Robert Burns' Tam o' Shanter. Furthermore, the band's drummer, Nicko McBrain, has been a born again Christian since 1999.|$|E

The other two just thought he was crazy." [...] McLaren later stated that, much earlier in the band's career, Vivienne Westwood had told him he should [...] "get the guy called John {{who came to the}} store a couple of times" [...] to be the singer. When Johnny Rotten was recruited for the band, Westwood said McLaren had got it wrong: [...] "he had <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> John." [...] It was John Beverley, the future Vicious, she had been recommending. McLaren approved the belated inclusion of Vicious, who had virtually no experience on his new instrument, on account of his look and reputation in the punk scene.|$|E

500|$|When the Beach Boys {{needed to}} {{reproduce}} its sound onstage, Wilson first requested that Tanner play the Electro-Theremin {{live with the}} group, but he declined due to commitments. Tanner recalls saying to Wilson, [...] "I've <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> sort of hair to be on stage with you fellas", to which Wilson replied: [...] "We'll give you a Prince Valiant wig." [...] The Beach Boys then requested the services of Walter Sear, who asked Bob Moog to design a ribbon controller, since the group was used to playing the fretboards of a guitar. Sears remembers marking fretboard-like lines on the ribbon [...] "so they could play the damn thing." [...] Moog began manufacturing his own models of theremins. He later noted: [...] "The pop record scene cleaned us out of our stock which we expected to last through Christmas." ...|$|E
500|$|As many expected, {{the highly}} {{anticipated}} domestic clash was a savage brawl from round one. Gomez won the opening rounds {{and threatened to}} overpower Johanneson from the opening seconds. The Leeds fighter then gained the upper hand as the fight went on, flooring Gomez in the sixth round only for the [...] "Irish Mexican" [...] {{to rise from the}} canvas. Soon after, with Gomez appearing unsteady on his feet, referee Mickey Vann stopped the fight. Gomez said that Vann had stopped the fight early, adding, [...] "When the stoppage came, I wasn't wobbling or staggering, and I only dropped my hands in the fight to show Johanneson that he couldn't hurt me. But the referee simply <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> message. It was bad refereeing. I told him straight away I was fine, but he insisted on showing me to my corner." [...] The former champion was clear that he wanted another opportunity to fight for the British title.|$|E
500|$|In August 2015, Butters {{and fellow}} {{executive}} producer Chris Dingess stated that Madame Masque {{would appear in}} the season, and that an actress had been cast in the role. Everett was confirmed to be playing the character that October. After being cast and seeing {{a picture of the}} comic version of the character, Everett felt [...] "'They <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> girl,' only because I look nothing like her. I was very nervous about it ... thought, 'They will probably dye my hair dark, and I'm going to need to work out a bit. And those are some pretty big boobs.'" [...] However, the producers were looking to take a different approach to the character, taking inspiration from [...] "Hollywood icons like Hedy Lamarr and Lauren Bacall". The character also does not wear the gold mask from the comics, though the show does reference this, with masks appearing in the background of many scenes featuring Frost. Ivy George and Olivia Welch portray younger versions of Cully during her time growing up in Broxton, Oklahoma.|$|E

500|$|Talking further about Scritti Politti, a British post-punk band, Minogue reminisced {{about her}} {{collaboration}} with the band's frontman Green Gartside, who provides vocals on the track [...] "Someday", saying, [...] "To this day I haven't met him! I {{left a message on}} his answering machine, saying, [...] "Hi, it's Kylie! I just wanted to say thanks so much! You sound brilliant!" [...] "After Dark" [...] was co-written by Dennis, who had previously co-written [...] "Can't Get You Out of My Head" [...] for Minogue. Torrini, who co-wrote [...] "Slow", revealed how she was approached for writing the song, saying [...] "It was like I had just accidentally walked into the line of fire with, [...] "Hey! You There! It was all quite surreal. I still think Kylie's people were trying to call Jamelia, and they just <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> number.

500|$|... "Slow" [...] {{was written}} by Kylie Minogue, Dan Carey, and Emilíana Torrini, and {{produced}} by Carey, Torrini, and Sunnyroads. In 2009, Torrini explained how she was approached for writing the song, saying [...] "It was like I had just accidentally walked into {{the line of fire}} with, [...] "Hey! You There! It was all quite surreal. I still think Kylie's people were trying to call Jamelia, and they just <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> number. It'd be much more funny if that is how it actually happened". Musically, the song is an eighties-inspired synthpop track. It utilises a very simple and [...] "minimalist" [...] style of production and was described as an [...] "electro-pop/disco fusion with percolating crackle-and-pop beats and sugary vocal overdubs" [...] by Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine. Additionally, it contains elements of electroclash and club music. Through the lyrics of the song, Minogue urges a man, whom she meets at a club, to [...] "slow down" [...] and dance with her. According to Minogue, the lyrics of the song are about [...] " [...] how time and space have a different meaning when you meet someone". She further said that she [...] "loved the way the song had this push-pull effect; the musical and lyrical combination gives you a sense of that".|$|E
2500|$|In August 2000, {{prior to}} Jack McConnell’s {{appointment}} as Education Minister, Scotland's national exams system was plunged into chaos when 5,000 students <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> exam results.

[...] In third-season episode [...] "Any Portrait in a Storm", Coolidge sees guest star Timothy Van Patten (another Shadow alumnus) in an elevator and calls out [...] "Heyyyy!!

2500|$|The couple {{arrived at}} the scene around 11:45p.m. After about ten minutes, a man walked up to Hollis' driver-side door and flashed a {{flashlight}} in his face, blinding him. Hollis, {{not sure if it}} was a prank or if he had been mistaken for someone else, told the man, [...] "Fellow, you've got me mixed up with someone else. You've <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> man." [...] The man had a pistol and told him something like, [...] "I don't want to kill you fellow, so do what I say", and ordered them {{to get out of the}} car. They both got out through the driver-side door. The man told Hollis to [...] "take off your [...] britches." [...] Larey pleaded with Hollis to please take them off, believing that if he did they would not be hurt, but, after Hollis removed his trousers, he was struck twice in the head with a heavy, blunt object. Larey explained in an interview three months later with Texarkana Gazette reporter Lucille Holland that the noise was so loud she thought he had been shot, but she learned later it was the sound of his skull cracking.|$|E
2500|$|Already in 1690 Fatio assumed, {{that the}} [...] "push force" [...] exerted by the {{particles}} on a plain surface is the sixth {{part of the}} force, which would be produced if all particles are lined up normal to the surface. Fatio now gave a proof of this proposal by determination of the force, which is exerted by the particles on a certain point zz. He derived the formula p=ρv2zz/6. This solution {{is very similar to}} the formula known in the kinetic theory of gases p=ρv2/3, which was found by Daniel Bernoulli in 1738. This {{was the first time that}} a solution analogous to the similar result in kinetic theory was pointed out - long before the basic concept of the latter theory was developed. However, Bernoulli's value is twice as large as Fatio's one, because according to Zehe, Fatio only calculated the value mv for the change of impulse after the collision, but not 2mv and therefore <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> result. (His result is only correct in the case of totally inelastic collisions.) Fatio tried to use his solution not only for explaining gravitation, but for explaining the behaviour of gases as well. He tried to construct a thermometer, which should indicate the [...] "state of motion" [...] of the air molecules and therefore estimate the temperature. But Fatio (unlike Bernoulli) did not identify heat and the movements of the air particles - he used another fluid, which should be responsible for this effect. It is also unknown, whether Bernoulli was influenced by Fatio or not.|$|E

2500|$|In November 2012, a show source told Inside Soap that Christmas 2012 would [...] "bring {{serious drama}} to the Moons" [...] with the reveal {{of the mystery}} man's {{identity}} and the aftermath: [...] "the consequences will be felt across the Square. Who could blame Alfie if he kicked Kat to the kerb? She has treated him appallingly." [...] It was revealed Kat would reveal the identity of her lover during an episode in which Kat and Alfie argue, Alfie attacks {{one of the suspects}} and Kat shouts that he has the wrong brother. An EastEnders source told the Daily Star: [...] "It's the question that has been on everyone's lips for months—who is Kat's secret lover? The big revelation was always {{going to be in the}} Queen Vic in front of everyone and it will not disappoint. Jessie [...] and Shane [...] are both brilliant and this is one episode viewers will not want to miss. Alfie goes for one of the Branning brothers as he is convinced it's him who's been sleeping with his wife. Kat storms through the pub as he's got him on the floor and reveals the truth. We all got goosebumps as she yelled the line, 'You've <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> brother' [...] It really is classic Enders." [...] The source added, [...] "Sadly it doesn't look like [...] be able to get over this one." [...] EastEnders confirmed that viewers would discover the identity of Kat's lover in the episode broadcast on 20 December 2012. Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy said it would be a [...] "dramatic climax" [...] to the storyline. On being told who Kat's lover is, Richie said he understood and found it clever, though he had previously thought it would be Michael or Ray. Richie told Radio Times that Alfie is still in denial about the affair but becomes Kat's [...] "stalker", following her to the bedsit.
