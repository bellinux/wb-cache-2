50|$|Since Virtual Hubs and Virtual Network Adapters {{are only}} software-emulated virtual <b>Ethernet</b> <b>devices,</b> the <b>Ethernet</b> packets through these virtual devices cannot {{communicate}} with physical <b>Ethernet</b> <b>devices.</b> Therefore, {{a bridge between}} the virtual and the physical is necessary to build a remote-access VPN or site-to-site VPN. To make a bridge, the Local Bridge function exchanges the Ethernet packets between a Virtual Hub and a physical Ethernet network adapter to combine both isolated Ethernet segments into a single Ethernet segment.|$|R

50|$|Properly {{implemented}} an IEEE 802.1aq network {{can support}} up to 1000 participating bridges and provide {{tens of thousands}} of layer 2 E-LAN services to <b>Ethernet</b> <b>devices.</b> This can be done by simply configuring the ports facing the <b>Ethernet</b> <b>devices</b> to indicate they are members of a given service. As new members come and go, the IS-IS protocol will advertise the I-SID membership changes and the computations will grow or shrink the trees in the participating node network as necessary to maintain the efficient multicast property for that service.|$|R

50|$|Any <b>Ethernet</b> <b>device</b> can be {{connected}} within the EtherCAT segment via switch ports. The Ethernet frames are tunneled via the EtherCAT protocol, as is normal for internet protocols (e.g., TCP/IP, VPN, PPPoE (DSL), etc.). The EtherCAT network is fully transparent for the Ethernet devices, and the real-time features of EtherCAT are not disturbed.|$|E

50|$|After {{defining}} the Local Bridge on SoftEther VPN Server, any VPN Client can {{connect to the}} VPN Server and communicate to all existing <b>Ethernet</b> <b>devices</b> (e.g. servers or network equipment) through the Local Bridge. This is called a remote-access VPN.|$|R
50|$|The SPI module usually sits in kernel {{space as}} a UI driver from one side, {{and as an}} <b>Ethernet</b> <b>device</b> at the other side. The SPI then captures network traffic {{in order to find}} Package Requests (PR). When it captures one, the HTTP daemon sets up the FLGOT_POST_PACKAGE or FLGOT_GET_PACKAGE. The SPI compares both Ethernet data and HTTP request, interprets them and passes the {{interpreted}} data to the UI peripheral.|$|E
50|$|The USB-eth module in Linux {{makes the}} {{computer}} running it {{a variation of}} an <b>Ethernet</b> <b>device</b> that uses USB as the physical medium. It creates a Linux network interface, which can be assigned an IP address and otherwise treated {{the same as a}} true Ethernet interface. Any applications that work over real Ethernet interfaces will work over a USB-eth interface without modification, because they can't tell that they aren't using real Ethernet hardware.|$|E
50|$|Configuration and {{management}} support consists of software to enumerate, join, {{and check the}} status of available Wi-Fi networks. This also includes support for various encryption methods. These systems are often provided by the operating system backed by a standard driver model. In most cases, drivers emulate an <b>Ethernet</b> <b>device</b> and use the configuration {{and management}} utilities built into the operating system. In cases where built in configuration and management support is non-existent or inadequate, hardware manufacturers may include their own software to handle the respective tasks.|$|E
50|$|The {{ability to}} connect <b>Ethernet</b> <b>devices</b> via USB ports is known as Ethernet over USB. There are many {{low-cost}} commercial adapters available to do this, and usually implemented as a bridge between true Ethernet and Ethernet-style networking atop USB (see below).|$|R
50|$|Ethernet Routing Switch 4000 Series or (ERS 4000) in {{computer}} networking terms are stackable Layer3 (routers) and Layer 2 (switches) designed and manufactured by Avaya for <b>Ethernet</b> <b>devices.</b> The ERS 4000 Series {{consists of two}} major groups of devices, the ERS 4500 models and the ERS 4800 models.|$|R
5000|$|Ethernet: A PHY chip (PHYceiver) is {{commonly}} found on <b>Ethernet</b> <b>devices.</b> Its {{purpose is to}} provide analog signal physical access to the link.

5000|$|The first SoftAP {{software}} was shipped by Ralink with their Wi-Fi cards for Windows XP. It enabled a Wi-Fi card {{to act as}} a wireless access point. While a card was acting as a wireless access point, it could not continue to stay connected as a client, so any Internet access had to come from another device, such an <b>Ethernet</b> <b>device.</b> Following Ralink's card innovation, a number of other Wi-Fi vendors, including Edimax, later released SoftAP software for their devices. [...] Neither Ralink nor Edimax updated their software to work with Windows Vista, due to the installation of its new driver model, bringing an effective end to this software category until the release of Windows 7 in 2009.|$|E
5000|$|As of late 2012, {{the most}} widely {{deployed}} HomePlug devices are [...] "adapters", which are standalone modules that plug into wall outlets (or power strips not surge protectors or extension cords) and provide one or more Ethernet ports. In a simple home network, the Internet gateway router connects via Ethernet cable to a powerline adapter, which in turn plugs into a nearby power outlet. A second adapter, plugged into any other outlet in the home, connects via Ethernet cable to any <b>Ethernet</b> <b>device</b> (e.g., computer, printer, IP phone, gaming station). Communications between the router and Ethernet devices are then conveyed over existing home electrical wiring. More complex networks can be implemented by plugging in additional adapters as needed. A powerline adapter may also be plugged into a hub or switch so that it supports multiple Ethernet devices residing in a common room.|$|E
5000|$|Ethernet connections, {{including}} {{home and}} work networks, wireless data networks and the Internet itself, are based on frames sent between computers. Wake-on-LAN ("WOL") is implemented using a specially designed frame called a magic packet, which is sent to all computers in a network, among them the computer to be awakened. The magic packet contains the MAC address of the destination computer, an identifying number built into each network interface card ("NIC") or other <b>ethernet</b> <b>device</b> in a computer, that enables it to be uniquely recognized and addressed on a network. Powered-down or turned off computers capable of Wake-on-LAN will contain network devices able to [...] "listen" [...] to incoming packets in low-power mode while the system is powered down. If a magic packet is received that is directed to the device's MAC address, the NIC signals the computer's power supply or motherboard to initiate system wake-up, much {{in the same way}} as pressing the power button would do.|$|E
5000|$|Token Ring {{eliminates}} collision {{by the use}} of a single-use token {{and early}} token release to alleviate the down time. Ethernet alleviates collision by carrier sense multiple access and {{by the use of}} an intelligent switch; primitive <b>Ethernet</b> <b>devices</b> like hubs can precipitate collisions due to repeating traffic blindly.|$|R
50|$|Circuit {{emulation}} service technology allows {{companies to}} easily migrate to packet-switched networks. With CES, the legacy TDM and ATM services are supported {{with much more}} cost-effective infrastructures based on low-cost and highly available <b>Ethernet</b> <b>devices.</b> This is a reverse mapping approach with regard to traditional solutions in which IP/ethernet services is carried in ATM or PDH/SDH protocols.|$|R
50|$|Another related Cisco protocol, Dynamic Inter-Switch Link Protocol (DISL) {{simplifies}} {{the creation of}} an ISL trunk from two interconnected Fast <b>Ethernet</b> <b>devices.</b> Fast EtherChannel technology enables aggregation of two full-duplex Fast Ethernet links for high-capacity backbone connections. DISL minimizes VLAN trunk configuration procedures because only one end of a link needs to be configured as a trunk.|$|R
5000|$|The iPAQ was {{developed}} by Compaq based on the SA-1110 [...] "Assabet" [...] and SA-1111 [...] "Neponset" [...] reference boards that were engineered by a StrongARM development group located at Digital Equipment Corporation's Hudson Massachusetts facility. At the time when these boards were in development, this facility was acquired by Intel. When the [...] "Assabet" [...] board is combined with the [...] "Neponset" [...] companion processor board they provide support for 32 megabytes of SDRAM in addition to CompactFlash and PCMCIA slots along with an I2S or AC-Link serial audio bus, PS/2 mouse and trackpad interfaces, a USB host controller and 18 additional GPIO pins. Software drivers for a CompactFlash <b>ethernet</b> <b>device,</b> IDE storage devices such as the IBM Microdrive and the Lucent WaveLAN/IEEE 802.11 Wifi device were also available. An earlier StrongARM SA-1100 based research handheld device call the [...] "Itsy" [...] had been developed at Digital Equipment Corporation's Western Research Laboratory (later to become the Compaq Western Research Laboratory). With the acquisition of Compaq by Hewlett-Packard, HP discontinued the Jornada line of Microsoft Windows powered Pocket PCs, moving development and marketing of Pocket PCs to the iPAQ line.|$|E

As a virtual <b>Ethernet</b> <b>device</b> IP-dimmer is presented, which operates five active loads of 220 volt. The power {{part of the}} device is fulfilled on the simistors the operation of which is {{carried out by the}} microcontroller. The virtual device and the program of its operation contain network UDP-socket component – the main interface between the device (server) and program support (client). For visual mapping {{of the state of the}} virtual device work the voltmeters, the indicator of power change on loads and the window of IP-packages reception are entered in addition. The program part of the client and the server has the unit of time saving of all transferring and accepting commands accordingly. Thus, there is a possibility not only to observe the functioning of the virtual device, but also to spend a calculus of its operation...|$|E
40|$|Twisted-pair Ethernet {{is now the}} {{standard}} home and office last-mile network technology. For decades, the IEEE standard that defines Ethernet has required electrical isolation between the twisted pair cable and the <b>Ethernet</b> <b>device.</b> So, for decades, every Ethernet interface has used magnetic core Ethernet transformers to isolate Ethernet devices and keep users safe {{in the event of}} a potentially dangerous fault on the network media. The current state-of-the-art Ethernet transformers are miniature (< 5 mm diameter) ferrite-core toroids wrapped with approximately 10 to 30 turns of wire. As small as current Ethernet transformers are, they still limit further <b>Ethernet</b> <b>device</b> miniaturization and require a separate bulky package or jack housing. New coupler designs must be explored which are capable of exceptional miniaturization or on-chip fabrication. This dissertation thoroughly explores the performance of the current commercial Ethernet transformers to both increase understanding of the device‟s behavior and outline performance parameters for replacement devices. Lumped element and distributed circuit models are derived; testing schemes are developed and used to extract model parameters from commercial Ethernet devices. Transfer relation measurements of the commercial Ethernet transformers are compare...|$|E
50|$|The {{asymmetric}} 10/1G-EPON appear less challenging {{than the}} symmetric option, as this specification relies on fairly mature technologies. The upstream transmission {{is identical to}} that of the 1G-EPON (as specified in IEEE standard 802.3ah), using deployed burst-mode optical transceivers. The downstream transmission, which uses continuous-mode optics, will rely on the maturity of 10 Gbit/s point-to-point <b>Ethernet</b> <b>devices.</b>|$|R
50|$|Components of a White Rabbit network are {{multi-port}} White Rabbit Switches {{and single}} or dual-port White Rabbit nodes. Both components may be added dynamically to the network. Cable length and other delay factors are automatically compensated by the Precision Time Protocol algorithms. Though conventional Gigabit <b>Ethernet</b> <b>devices</b> may be connected as well only White Rabbit devices {{take part in}} network timing and synchronization.|$|R
50|$|An Ethernet {{crossover}} cable {{is a type}} of twisted pair Ethernet cable used to connect computing devices together directly that would normally be connected via a network switch, Ethernet hub or router, such as directly connecting two personal computers via their network adapters. Most current <b>Ethernet</b> <b>devices</b> support Auto MDI-X, so it doesn't matter whether you use crossover or straight cables.|$|R
