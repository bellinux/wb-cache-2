2500|$|Andersen, {{whose own}} father died of tuberculosis, {{may have been}} {{inspired}} by [...] "Ode to a Nightingale" [...] (1819), a poem John Keats wrote in anguish over his brother Tom's death of tuberculosis. Keats even evokes an emperor: [...] "Thou was not born for death, immortal Bird! / No hungry generations tread thee down / The Voice <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>this</b> passing night was heard / In ancient days by emperor and clown". Keats died of tuberculosis in 1821, and is buried in Rome, a city that continued to fascinate Andersen long after his first visit in 1833.|$|E
2500|$|He meets up with Miles, who angrily says [...] "it's {{been years}} man, years I {{been trying to}} get the {{straight}} word on Blackmore. And what the fuck is up with you my man? First <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>this,</b> I couldn't believe, I said no way, not my man Torque. That cracker bleeding out in the basement, he told me what's what and he got no reason to lie. My brain ready to pop. It's too whack, nobody'd make this up. Nobody would never say that you..." [...] However, Torque blacks out, and when he awakens, Miles is dead. Blackmore then contacts Torque, telling him to come to the drowning pool beneath the prison's factory. As Torque heads there, he is attacked by Foundation soldiers backed up by a helicopter piloted by Jordan, who was lying about her men betraying her. Torque defeats the soldiers and kills Jordan.|$|E

Few portraits are more {{in the style of the}} palmy days of our school (just after Lawrence) than a study of a lady by Mr. Goodall (687). On the other hand, young Mr. Richmond goes back to the antiquated manner of Reynolds in one of his representations. I must admit that <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>this</b> work much admired by many; to me it seems old-fashioned and lacking in blandness and affability. Mr Waterhouse has a study of a subject from a poem that Mr. Pendennis, the novelist (whom I knew well), was very fond of when he first came on the town: [...] "The Lady of Shalott." [...] It represents a very delicate invalid, in a boat, under a counterpane. I remember the poem ran (it was by young Mr. Tennyson):- ...|$|E
