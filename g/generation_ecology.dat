40|$|The Groningen {{province}} {{is gathering}} ideas on spatial adaptations for climate proofing the province. Such ideas on spatial adaptations for climate change {{have been produced}} and collected during a number of workshops in which experts on (e. g.) energy, ecology, water, agriculture and the climate shared their vision {{on how to make}} Groningen ready for climate change. Two kinds of workshop sessions were organized to define a coherent set of adaptation measures. Sector-specific workshops focused on generating solutions for problems in a specific domain (e. g. nature or energy), while more general sessions aimed to establish integrated visions for climate change adaption in Groningen. In the sector-specific sessions, experts gathered adaptation measures for societal domains such as energy <b>generation,</b> <b>ecology,</b> coastal management and water management. Gathering these ideas led to a large number of maps that show threats and proposed measures for a specific theme. In total, four sessions produced 28 separate maps, each with a (partially) different set of adaptation measures for Groningen...|$|E

50|$|In Environment, William W. Murdoch synthesizes a {{collection}} of environmental studies aimed at instructing new <b>generations</b> of <b>ecology</b> students. He was prompted {{to work on the}} subject by an over accumulation of data that resulted from the public’s growing interest on environmental problems of the day. The scope of his study focuses primarily on the interplay of science, technology, human values, and institutions that make environmental science not only fascinating, but also relevant to the evolving sociopolitical dynamics of our world. This 1975 book demonstrates how Murdoch’s general theories on population ecology and environmental science were starting to shape up and presents an opportunity for comparison to later works and perspectives.|$|R

The New Left also led to a revival of anarchism. Journals like Radical America and Black Mask in America, Solidarity, Big Flame and Democracy & Nature, succeeded by The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy, in the UK, introduced a range of left libertarian ideas to a new <b>generation.</b> Social <b>ecology,</b> autonomism and, more recently, participatory economics (parecon), and Inclusive Democracy emerged from this.|$|R
50|$|Waechter's {{influence}} was {{called into question}} in 1994 when the Greens decided to break with his policy of non-alignment, instead deciding to adopt a markedly left-wing stance. The move prompted Waechter to leave the Greens. He went on to found the Independent Ecological Movement. In the following presidential election of 1995, Dominique Voynet polled a modest 3.8% but, in due to the marginalisation of <b>Ecology</b> <b>Generation,</b> the Greens captured the leadership into {{the family of the}} French political ecology.|$|R

50|$|However, {{the party}} faced with another {{ecologist}} party: <b>Ecology</b> <b>Generation</b> led by Brice Lalonde, environment minister of President François Mitterrand and {{allied with the}} Socialist Party (PS). In this, if the ecologist parties benefited from the electoral decline of the PS {{in the beginning of}} the 1990s, the Greens competed for the leadership of the French ecologist movement. In the 1992 regional elections, the Greens obtained 6.8% of votes and the presidency of Nord-Pas-de-Calais region.

40|$|When {{individuals}} {{make decisions}} in the natural <b>ecology,</b> <b>generation</b> and selection of {{a course of action}} is informed by their assessment of the situation. Previous option generation research—largely using complex but static tasks—has examined, separately, the decision strategies employed during the situation assessment and response phases of decision making. This research found that decision makers typically generate a small number of options, and their first option is generally a good one. In dynamic tasks, however, skilled performance involves not only comprehension of the current situation, but the ability to predict impending events. The goal of the current study is to test existing claims about the option generation strategies employed during the situation assessment and response phases of decision making, {{in the context of a}} dynamic task...|$|R
50|$|On 12 June 1994 {{the fourth}} direct {{elections}} to the European Parliament {{were held in}} the France. Six lists were able to win seats: an alliance of the centre-right Union for French Democracy and the Gaullist Rally for the Republic, the Socialist Party, the Left Radical Party, the French Communist Party, the National Front and Philippe de Villiers' eurosceptic right-wing dissident UDF list, which formed the Majorité pour l'autre Europe. 53.5% of the French population turned out on election day, actually an improvement on the last election in 1989. The Greens, who were weakened by an <b>Ecology</b> <b>Generation</b> list led by Brice Lalonde (winning 2.01%) and also suffering from internal divisions between the party's left (who wanted an electoral alliance with the Soécialists and the left) and the right (rejecting all alliances), lost all 9 seats won in 1989.

40|$|Our planet Earth {{is going}} through an {{unprecedented}} crisis. The current ecological predicament is such {{that has the potential}} to annihilate {{life as we know it}} today. It is a global phenomenon that concerns every human being and even the whole creation itself. The international community and many organizations have issued persistent calls to change habits and behaviors as well as the basic organizational pattern of societies to make this world sustainable for future <b>generations.</b> Social <b>ecology</b> is one of the secular disciplines that tries to understand the reasons why we have reached this point as well as suggests new ways to overcome the crisis. Ecojustice is a concern that women and men of faith articulate in order to find in the sources of their own religious traditions guiding principles and resources to confront the current world situation. In this context, people of faith ask whether the Bible has anything to say or contribute to this particular situation. Through history, the Bible has been used, misused, and abused to justify almost anything, even the worst evils humanity has ever known, such as wars, slavery, racism, patriarchy, colonization, marginalization, and exploitation. Nevertheless, the Bible, as witness of the story of God’s good creation and of the pilgrimage of God’s people, has also been seen by many as providing a critical contribution to justice and peace and to the people’s commitment to safeguard God’s creation. This dissertation reads selected New Testament texts [...] The Gospel of Mark, the letter to the Romans, and the Book of Revelation [...] using the key tenets of Social Ecology and ecojustice as a basic hermeneutical framework. It deals with three different genres [...] gospel, letter, and apocalypse [...] and suggests liberating readings that can inspire and sustain people’s commitment in the struggle to build a sustainable and more humane society, based on justice and peace for all God’s creatures...|$|R
40|$|Maize (Zea mays L.) {{is a major}} crop in Eastern Africa {{in terms}} of production, {{consumption}} and income <b>generation.</b> Although highland <b>ecologies</b> in Eastern Africa have high potential for maize production, few varieties have been developed. Breeding efforts have been also concentrated on Quality Protein Maize (QPM) as a viable and cheaper method to alleviate malnutrition. Twenty conventional and 20 QPM three-way hybrid genotypes were developed and evaluated in a randomized block design across 11 and 8 environments in Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda in 2010. The objective was to identify superior and stable varieties from genotypes. Data were recorded on major agronomic traits (grain yield t ha - 1). Additive main effects and multiplicative interactions (AMMI) statistical model {{was used to assess}} stability in performance for grain yield. Combined analysis of variance across environments indicated highly significant differences among non-QPM and QPM genotypes. Variations due to environment and genotypexenvironment (GxE) were suggesting genotypes performed differently across environments. Environments of Gisozi, Holleta, Kongoni and Kapchorwa were favourable and stable while Kulumsa was favourable but unstable. Other environments were of medium to low potential. The AMMI analysis ranked 5 non-QPM genotypes were with above-average yield (6. 34 t ha - 1) and 8 for stability performance across environments. While for QPM 3 genotypes were yielded better than best check (6. 94 t ha - 1) and 7 genotypes were stable. Genotype 9 (7. 15 t ha - 1) was the only non-QPM genotype with yield better than the best check across environments.

40|$|Water is used {{within our}} society for human {{consumption}} and food production, industrial processes and energy <b>generation,</b> maintaining natural <b>ecology</b> and biodiversity and recreational purposes. Authorities now {{face the challenge of}} ensuring the quantity, distribution, quality and allocation between the various uses are sustainable. One source not considered in the past on a large scale is the reuse of wastewater. Recent state elections in Western Australia have brought the issue of water resources to the forefront of the public perception. Several solutions were put forward during the elections including a large desalination plant, building a canal to transport water from the north of the state and increased pumping of local aquifers. The Water Corporation of Western Australia tells us that by 2031, Perth is expected to need an extra 150 gigalitres of water. This will be met by an integrated water cycle approach including new sources, efficiency measures, water recycling, water trading and catchment management. However, it is expected that any new water sources will be more costly than current supply from local dams and groundwater. The objective of this project is to identify factors that have led to the current water crisis in Western Australia, examine water opportunities that are available to Western Australians and recommend a solution that is consistent with triple bottom line objectives. This includes an assessment of the large amount of information available on the factors influencing water reuse opportunities in Western Australia. Water reuse technology is essential to support our growing population. There is the need to assess the past, current and future situations to ensure there is sufficient water available in the future. It is also important that there is an awareness within the community and government agencies of the seriousness of the current water crisis. The greatest factors affecting the successful expansion and integration of water recycling into future sustainable water management plans are associated costs compared to other water sources, acceptance by the general public, minimization of environmental and health impacts, technology to treat water to an appropriate standard and the examples set by other Australian states and territories...|$|R
40|$|Water is an {{essential}} natural resource, and information about surface water conditions can support {{a wide variety of}} applications, including urban planning, agronomy, hydrology, electrical power <b>generation,</b> disaster relief, <b>ecology</b> and preservation of natural areas. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is recognized as an important source of data for monitoring surface water, especially under inclement weather conditions, and is used operationally for flood mapping applications. The canopy penetration capability of the microwaves also allows for mapping of flooded vegetation as a result of enhanced backscatter from what is generally believed to be a double-bounce scattering mechanism between the water and emergent vegetation. Recent investigations have shown that, under certain conditions, the SAR response signal from flooded vegetation may remain coherent during repeat satellite over-passes, which can be exploited for interferometric SAR (InSAR) measurements to estimate changes in water levels and water topography. InSAR results also suggest that coherence change detection (CCD) might be applied to wetland monitoring applications. This study examines wetland vegetation characteristics that lead to coherence in RADARSAT- 2 InSAR data of an area in eastern Canada with many small wetlands, and determines the annual variation in the coherence of these wetlands using multi-temporal radar data. The results for a three-year period demonstrate that most swamps and marshes maintain coherence throughout the ice-/snow-free time period for the 24 -day repeat cycle of RADARSAT- 2. However, open water areas without emergent aquatic vegetation generally do not have suitable coherence for CCD or InSAR water level estimation. We have found that wetlands with tree cover exhibit the highest coherence and the least variance; wetlands with herbaceous cover exhibit high coherence, but also high variability of coherence; and wetlands with shrub cover exhibit high coherence, but variability intermediate between treed and herbaceous wetlands. From this knowledge, we have developed a novel image product that combines information about the magnitude of coherence and its variability with radar brightness (backscatter intensity). This product clearly displays the multitude of small wetlands over a wide area. With an interpretation key we have also developed, it is possible to distinguish different wetland types and assess year-to-year changes. In the next few years, satellite SAR systems, such as the European Sentinel and the Canadian RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM), will provide rapid revisit capabilities and standard data collection modes, enhancing the operational application of SAR data for assessing wetland conditions and monitoring water levels using InSAR techniques...|$|R
