5|$|Released {{in theaters}} during the film industry's summer season, Deep Blue Sea was a {{moderate}} commercial success, grossing more than $73 {{million in the}} United States and Canada, and $164 million worldwide. The film received generally mixed reviews from critics, who praised its suspense, pacing, and action sequences. Criticism was targeted at its unoriginality and B movie conventions. Retrospectively, Deep Blue Sea has been regarded as a successful shark film, especially within a limited genre that <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>dominated</b> by Steven Spielberg's 1975 classic Jaws.|$|E

In the German federal election, 2017, Alternative for Germany gained enough votes to attain representation in the parliament for the first time.|$|E

Scotland has a Western-style open mixed economy closely linked {{with the rest of the}} UK and the wider world. Traditionally, the Scottish economy <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>dominated</b> by heavy industry underpinned by shipbuilding in Glasgow, coal mining and steel industries.

5|$|Canadian {{visual art}} <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>dominated</b> by {{figures such as}} Tom Thomson – the country's most famous painter – and by the Group of Seven. Thomson's career {{painting}} Canadian landscapes spanned a decade up to his death in 1917 at age 39. The Group were painters with a nationalistic and idealistic focus, who first exhibited their distinctive works in May 1920. Though referred to as having seven members, five artists—Lawren Harris, A. Y. Jackson, Arthur Lismer, J. E. H. MacDonald, and Frederick Varley—were responsible for articulating the Group's ideas. They were joined briefly by Frank Johnston, and by commercial artist Franklin Carmichael. A. J. Casson {{became part of the}} Group in 1926. Associated with the Group was another prominent Canadian artist, Emily Carr, known for her landscapes and portrayals of the Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast. Since the 1950s, works of Inuit art have been given as gifts to foreign dignitaries by the Canadian government.|$|E

5|$|Given {{that the}} Parliament does not form the {{government}} in the traditional sense of a Parliamentary system, its politics have developed along more consensual lines rather than majority rule of competing parties and coalitions. Indeed, for much of its life it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>dominated</b> by a grand coalition of the European People's Party and the Party of European Socialists. The two major parties tend to co-operate to find a compromise between their two groups leading to proposals endorsed by huge majorities. However, this does not always produce agreement, and each may instead try to build other alliances, the EPP normally with other centre-right or right wing Groups and the PES with centre-left or left wing Groups. Sometimes, the Liberal Group is then in the pivotal position. There are also occasions where very sharp party political divisions have emerged, for example over the resignation of the Santer Commission.|$|E

50|$|ASEA <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>dominating</b> the Swedish {{market for}} {{electric}} locomotives, but Nykvist & Holm <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>dominating</b> the diesel segment.
