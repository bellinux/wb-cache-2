The legislature, executive and judicial branches of government are examples of institutions that give policy legitimacy.

The early examination of computerized criminal history records enables the officer to identify which law <b>enforcement,</b> <b>court,</b> and correctional records must be reviewed. In addition, the initial interview of the defendant should include questioning about the offender's residential history so that the officer can check local police and court records in every jurisdiction where the defendant has lived.

El Chapo). In a civil forfeiture lawsuit filed in Corpus Christi on 12 May 2012, Yarrington is said to face forfeiture of a condominium he owns in South Padre Island that federal authorities believe he purchased with [...] "illegally obtained funds" [...] and under another name to avoid detection by law <b>enforcement.</b> <b>Court</b> records say that Yarrington used $450,000 from the Gulf cartel to pay the 14th floor unit. The indictment also alleged that a Mexican businessman known as Fernando Alejandro Cano Martínez used several corporate entities in Texas to launder money by the Gulf Cartel to pay top politicians in Tamaulipas. These bribes were then paid to the politicians in Tamaulipas in exchange for little to no police intervention in the Gulf Cartel's trafficking and money laundering activities. Cano Martínez is also accused of bank fraud because he obtained several bank loans with false information. The U.S. authorities are trying to confiscate Yarrington's condominium in South Padre Island and a 46-acre property in San Antonio, Texas. All these properties are believed to have been bought by Yarrington with drug proceeds from the Gulf Cartel, a criminal organization headquartered in the city of Matamoros, Tamaulipas (where he served as mayor). The laundered money is believed to have granted the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas [...] "political influence" [...] in the state of Tamaulipas.|$|E

30|$|The adverse {{selection}} problem, {{on the other}} hand, arises in the model because, ex-ante, {{it is not possible}} to distinguish between the Low and the High type. Here comes the role of formal institutions. The formal institutions of contract enforcement are essentially third party <b>enforcement</b> (<b>court,</b> police etc). They solve this problem by punishing a Low type contractor who poses as the High type contractor. The higher is the quality of the formal institutions, the higher is the probability of catching and punishing a Low type mimicking a High type. Therefore, the quality of formal institutions enters our analysis through the channel of the {{adverse selection}} problem, making the adverse selection problem crucial to our theory. Both the moral hazard and adverse selection problems are important in our analysis because they are solved by the informal and formal institutions respectively.|$|E

40|$|According to leading Portuguese {{criminal}} justice experts, among {{the problems that}} ail the Portuguese {{criminal justice}} system {{is the lack of}} political involvement and accountability after approving laws that criminalize certain acts as one of the causes of this system’s dismay (Carvalho 2002). Legislative politics are said to disconnected from the criminal justice system. However, this is not a problem that particular to the Portuguese justice system. The credibility of the justice systems around the world suffers from this problem. This paper deals with this disconnection and how law <b>enforcement,</b> <b>court,</b> and prison criminal subsystems deal with this in maintaining deterrence strategies—central to criminal justice systems. From previous studies (Mendes 2001), I inferred that statutory sentencing and prison capacity are not aligned policies. Setting the maximal severity of the deterrent threat is independent of the allocation of criminal justice system resources. Once prisons reach and surpass capacity limits and there are no more beds, there is not much judges and parole officers can do but turn to options that {{in one way or another}} release prisoners and reduce the intake, and in this way, relieve the pressure on the system. ...|$|E
