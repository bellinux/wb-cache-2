5|$|The Great Depression (1929–c. 1939) hit <b>especially</b> <b>hard</b> in Western Canada, {{including}} Manitoba. The {{collapse of}} the world market combined with a steep drop in agricultural production due to drought led to economic diversification, moving away from a reliance on wheat production. The Manitoba Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, forerunner to the New Democratic Party of Manitoba (NDP), was founded in 1932.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} mid-2000s, Greece's economy {{was one of}} the fastest growing in the eurozone and was {{associated}} with a large structural deficit. As the world economy was hit by the financial crisis of 2007–08, Greece was hit <b>especially</b> <b>hard</b> because its main industries—shipping and tourism—were especially sensitive to changes in the business cycle. The government spent heavily to keep the economy functioning and the country's debt increased accordingly.|$|E
5|$|The 1895 {{capture of}} the Merina royal capitol, the Rova of Antananarivo, by the French sparked the Menalamba {{rebellion}} against foreigners, Christianity and Merina domination. In the chaotic 1895–97 period, bands of Sakalava, Marofotsy and other bandits engaged in raids to loot cattle and other goods. The Sihanaka were <b>especially</b> <b>hard</b> hit owing to their reputation as a relatively wealthy trading people. Many Sihanaka villagers resorted to sleeping in the forests and fields to avoid falling victim to nighttime pillage and arson; entire Sihanaka villages were burned.|$|E

5|$|As the {{hurricane}} moved inland, {{the city of}} Houston was hit <b>especially</b> <b>hard.</b> Three {{people in the area}} died and several others were injured. Winds blew at up to , catching many off-guard after a previous forecast that deemed the region was safe. Some sections of the city were left without power. The winds destroyed poorly built structures and damaged others, and some streets were flooded. An athletic stadium was demolished by the storm, and glass windows were shattered in downtown stores. A preliminary estimate placed the damage in Houston at $500,000. In the aftermath of the storm, fifteen truckloads of shattered glass were removed.|$|E
5|$|Macdonald's {{reputation}} as the premier who led the province out of the Great Depression rested on his commitment to ambitious government projects such as highway construction and rural electrification. He continued to support highway improvements throughout his career. Two projects that he pushed <b>especially</b> <b>hard</b> for, the Canso Causeway linking Cape Breton Island to mainland Nova Scotia and a suspension bridge spanning Halifax Harbour were completed after his death. The bridge, named in his honour, {{made it possible to}} travel between Halifax and Dartmouth without having to board a ferry or drive several kilometres around the Bedford Basin.|$|E
5|$|To {{maintain}} morale, wartime censors minimized early {{reports of}} illness and mortality in Germany, the United Kingdom, France, and the United States. However, papers were free to report the epidemic's effects in neutral Spain (such as the grave illness of King Alfonso XIII). This reporting dichotomy created a false impression of Spain as <b>especially</b> <b>hard</b> hit, thereby giving rise to the pandemic's nickname, Spanish Flu. In Spain, a different nickname was adopted, the Naples Soldier (Soldado de Nápoles), which came from a musical operetta (zarzuela) titled La canción del olvido (The Song of Forgetting), which premiered in Madrid during the first epidemic wave. Federico Romero, one of the librettists, quipped that the play's most popular musical number, Naples Soldier, was as catchy as the flu.|$|E

5|$|On July 9, 2009, Garland {{committed}} to play college basketball for the Hokies of Virginia Tech. He announced {{his decision to}} attend the school {{at a press conference}} at the Reebok All-American Camp. Garland had also considered joining the programs at La Salle, Nebraska, Temple, St. Bonaventure, Maryland, Seton Hall, Providence, and Butler. La Salle University is based in Garland's hometown of Philadelphia and its head coach, John Giannini, recruited him <b>especially</b> <b>hard</b> out of high school. His old coach at John Bartram High School, James Brown, supported his commitment to Virginia Tech. Assistant coach James Johnson was the man primarily responsible for recruiting Garland. Rivals.com rated the point guard a three-star recruit, and ESPN ranked him as the 31st-best player of his position in the Class of 2010. Garland officially signed a National Letter of Intent with the team on February 3, 2010 and enrolled at Virginia Tech on June 30. Garland would play his freshman season for a Virginia Tech Hokies team that had a large part of its scoring coming from Malcolm Delaney, Jeff Allen, and Dorenzo Hudson in the 2009–10 season. Delaney, their leading scorer, chose to withdraw from the 2010 NBA draft in May 2010 and returned for another season with the Hokies. Garland weighed approximately 170lbs (77kg) entering college, and because of his shooting guard qualities, he was not as highly rated as some of the team's other 2010 recruits, like Jarell Eddie.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} Lightning Returns {{originated}} during development of XIII-2, while the development team was brainstorming ideas for possible continuations {{of the story}} and universe of the games, though there was no solid decision to make a second sequel to XIII at the time. Development of Lightning Returns started in May 2012, soon after the release of Requiem of the Goddess, the final story-based DLC episode for XIII-2. According to Motomu Toriyama, he had wanted to tell more stories about Lightning, and the DLC had not provided a satisfactory ending for her. The game was designed in a shorter time than the other games in the series; Yoshinori Kitase explained that this was because the team did not want players to forget the story of the previous games, and the team needed to work <b>especially</b> <b>hard</b> as a result. Another reason was that the team wished to bring the XIII series to a close before the release of the next generation of gaming hardware. The title was also chosen to be the last original Final Fantasy game on seventh generation consoles, and next-gen versions of the game were not considered. Developer tri-Ace, who had previously worked with the team on XIII-2, returned to help with the graphics.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, {{the global}} {{recession}} hit the fur industry and trappers <b>especially</b> <b>hard</b> with greatly depressed fur prices {{thanks to a}} drop in the sale of expensive fur coats and hats. Such a drop in fur prices reflects trends of previous economic downturns.|$|E

25|$|Times were <b>especially</b> <b>hard</b> {{in western}} Canada, where a full {{recovery}} did not occur until the Second World War began in 1939.

50|$|In service, the Mk 12 proved {{less than}} satisfactory. Although its muzzle {{velocity}} {{and rate of}} fire were acceptable, it was inaccurate and frequently unreliable.

25|$|After the May 15, 1934 coup all {{associations}} and independent business organizations had to shut down, this affected German community <b>especially</b> <b>hard,</b> as {{they lost their}} ancient communal centers – guilds, and all of their property was nationalized.

25|$|The Great Depression of {{the early}} 1930s was <b>especially</b> <b>hard</b> on the jazz scene.

King Oliver made a few records but otherwise struggled. Sidney Bechet became a tailor, later moving to Paris and Kid Ory returned to New Orleans and raised chickens.|$|E
25|$|Self-verification theory {{predicts that}} when people {{interact}} with others, {{there is a general}} tendency for them to bring others to see them as they see themselves.

25|$|Like {{much of the}} nation, Daphne saw {{the economy}} plummet during the 2008 recession. Commercial real estate prices were <b>especially</b> <b>hard</b> hit.

25|$|The {{construction}} effort {{surpassed the}} resources available to the Romanian economy in the 1950s. The canal was assigned inferior machinery, part of which had already been used on the Soviet Volga-Don Canal, and building {{had to rely on}} primitive techniques (most work appears to have been carried out using shovels and pickaxes, which was <b>especially</b> <b>hard</b> in the rocky terrain of Northern Dobruja). Detainees were allocated to brigades, usually run by common criminals– encouraged to use violence against their subordinates. In parallel, the region's industrialization, destined to assist in the building effort, was never accomplished.|$|E
25|$|The {{end of the}} Gilded Age {{coincided with}} the Panic of 1893, a deep {{depression}} that lasted until 1897.

President Grover Cleveland was forced to ask the Wall Street bankers help keep the Treasury liquid. Agrarian spokesmen William Jennings Bryan called for an inflationary policy of using cheap silver to effectively replace expensive gold.
