50|$|There are {{different}} strains of GG. There is Gorilla <b>Glue</b> #1 Gorilla <b>Glue</b> #4, Gorilla <b>Glue</b> #5, and Gorilla <b>Glue</b> #5. Gorilla <b>Glue</b> #1 is more potent than Gorilla <b>Glue</b> #4.|$|R

50|$|Fugitive <b>glue,</b> {{also called}} credit card <b>glue,</b> E-z-release <b>glue,</b> or (colloquially) booger <b>glue,</b> snot <b>glue,</b> or gooey <b>glue,</b> is a low-tack {{adhesive}} {{that produces a}} removable, non-permanent joint. Fugitive <b>glue</b> contains a high amount of alcohol and is delivered to the substrate at a <b>glue</b> station when wet. The type of bond it produces is temporary in nature and is intended to hold two pieces of material together through the duration of folding and <b>gluing</b> operations. It will eventually evaporate without causing damage to either one of the separated substrate.|$|R
5|$|Examination of the {{wreckage}} revealed that large portions of the wings' skin were badly <b>glued</b> and {{that a number of}} rib caps and stringers were not <b>glued</b> at all. Many panel pins were not connected to the structure at all and many of the bradawl holes necessary to equalize pressure between the inside of the wing and the outside were missing entirely. The crash of such an advanced aircraft shocked the entire industry and caused a six-month hiatus in design work. Polikarpov overreacted to its loss and built the structure of a number of his subsequent aircraft stronger, and thus, heavier, than it needed to be. All further work on the project was abandoned following the crash, nominally for lack of a suitable engine.|$|E
5|$|Following {{issues with}} his make-up {{throughout}} the first season, Michael Dorn's Klingon prosthetics were modified. Michael Westmore made the headpiece simpler, and Dorn took to wearing a headband under the headpiece to reduce a skin rash on his forehead. The headpiece was then <b>glued</b> down around the edges.|$|E
5|$|In July 1984, Raiford guards {{found two}} hacksaw blades hidden in Bundy's cell. A steel bar {{in one of}} its windows had been sawed {{completely}} through at the top and bottom and <b>glued</b> back in place with a homemade soap-based adhesive. Several months later his cell was changed again after guards found an unauthorized mirror hidden in it.|$|E
50|$|Poly(vinyl acetate) (PVA, PVAc, poly(ethenyl ethanoate): {{commonly}} referred to as wood <b>glue,</b> white <b>glue,</b> carpenter's <b>glue,</b> school <b>glue,</b> Elmer's <b>glue</b> in the US, or PVA <b>glue)</b> is an aliphatic rubbery synthetic polymer with the formula (C4H6O2)n. It belongs to the polyvinyl esters family, with the general formula -RCOOCHCH2-. It is a type of thermoplastic.|$|R
5000|$|Animal <b>glue</b> was {{the most}} common {{woodworking}} <b>glue</b> for thousands of years until the advent of synthetic <b>glues</b> such as polyvinyl acetate (PVA) and other resin <b>glues</b> in the 20th century.

Glass artists take advantage of hide <b>glue's</b> ability to bond with glass, applying hide <b>glue</b> to glass. As the <b>glue</b> hardens it shrinks, chipping the glass.|$|R
40|$|We {{compare the}} prey capture <b>glues</b> {{produced}} by orb-weaving spiders (viscid <b>glue)</b> and their evolutionary descendents, the cobweb-weaving spiders (gumfoot <b>glue).</b> These <b>glues</b> are produced in homologous glands but exhibit contrasting structure, properties {{and response to}} changing humidity. Individual <b>glue</b> droplet stretching measurements indicate that the gumfoot <b>glue</b> behaves like a viscoelastic liquid {{in contrast to the}} viscid <b>glue,</b> which behaves like a viscoelastic solid. Moreover, the gumfoot <b>glue</b> is largely humidity-resistant – elasticity and adhesion are constant across variation in humidity and there is weak volume-dependence. Viscid <b>glue,</b> however, is highly humidity-sensitive. The <b>glue</b> expands an order of magnitude and demonstrates a monotonous reduction in elasticity under increased humidity, while <b>glue</b> adhesion optimizes at intermediate levels of humidity. We suggest that observed differences are due to different ‘tackifiers' used in these systems. These results shall inspire future efforts in fabricating stimuli-resistant and stimuli-sensitive materials...|$|R
5|$|Pupa: The pupae in {{most species}} are adecticous (with no {{functional}} mandibles in the pupal state) and obtect (with appendages fused or <b>glued</b> to the body), {{while others are}} decticous (with functional mandibles present in the pupal state) and exarate (having the antennae, legs, and wings free).|$|E
5|$|Stiffening laths, if used, are attached. Both {{horn and}} laths may be bound and <b>glued</b> with further lengths of sinew. After months of drying the bow {{is ready for}} use.

5|$|A {{thin layer}} of horn is <b>glued</b> onto {{what will be the}} belly of the bow, the side facing the archer. Water buffalo horn is very suitable, as is horn of several antelopes such as gemsbok, oryx, ibex, and that of Hungarian grey cattle. Goat and sheep horn can also be used. Most forms of cow horn are not suitable, as they soon {{delaminate}} with use. The horn can store more energy than wood in compression.|$|E
5000|$|Cooper also {{operated}} a successful <b>glue</b> factory in Gowanda, New York that produced <b>glue</b> for decades.

5000|$|Animal <b>glue,</b> {{especially}} hide <b>glue,</b> was {{the primary}} adhesive of choice for a great many types of woodworking, including furniture and lutherie, for many centuries. It is manufactured from rendered collagen from the skins (hides) of animals. It is chemically similar to edible gelatin and is non-toxic if ingested. Hide <b>glue</b> is still used today in specialized applications: musical instruments (lutherie), for replica furniture, and for conservation-grade repairs to antique woodwork. Hide <b>glue</b> is measured {{on the basis of}} its gel strength, a measure of how many grams of force it requires to depress a 1/2 in plunger 4 mm into a 12.5% protein solution of the <b>glue</b> at 10 C. <b>Glue</b> is manufactured in standard grades from 32 - 512 g. 192 g strength is the most commonly used for woodworking; 251 g is the highest normally used for instrument building; 135 g is the lowest used for general woodwork. <b>Glue</b> above 250 g strength requires excessive dilution and so leaves too little <b>glue</b> in joints for effective adhesion, so it is not commonly used. Liquid versions of hide <b>glue</b> are now available; typically they have urea added to keep the <b>glue</b> liquid at room temperature and to extend drying time. Examples of liquid hide <b>glue</b> are Old Brown <b>Glue</b> or Titebond Liquid Hide. Hide <b>glue</b> does not creep. Hide <b>glue</b> joints are easy to repair, by just heating and adding more hide <b>glue.</b>|$|R
5|$|I needed {{somebody}} who could perform, and {{who also had}} a lot of endurance, because we were shooting in Atlanta at the end of July. Silicone doesn’t have cell structure, like foam does. It doesn’t breathe. So Brian was basically encased in a sixty-pound wet-suit. Every part of his body was covered. He had facial prosthetics, hands, full legs, feet. It was all <b>glued</b> down. It wasn’t like we could take him out between takes. He was in.|$|E
5|$|Lombardy {{noted the}} shock that Spassky was in after he resigned:While Fischer dashed for his car, Spassky {{remained}} <b>glued</b> to his seat. A sympathetic Lothar Schmid came over, {{and the two}} shifted the pieces about with Boris demonstrating his careless mistakes. The two were left wondering how Bobby could have squeezed a win from a position which a night of competent analysis by a renowned Soviet team had showed to be a guaranteed draw.|$|E
5|$|The {{adhesive}} {{surface was}} protected by a light metal case which was released by pulling a safety pin: the case fell away as two hemispheres connected by a sprung hinge. The inside of the case was fitted {{with a number of}} rubber spikes that kept it clear of the <b>glued</b> surface of the grenade. Early models also had a strip of adhesive tape round the neck of the casing.|$|E

5|$|The {{church has}} a total length of , {{including}} the atrium. It was mostly built of rectangular limestone blocks sparingly joined with mortar. Inside the apse, the mortar is red-coloured. The floor {{was covered by}} marble and stone tiles <b>glued</b> on top of red mortar in the narthex and white mortar elsewhere. Red and yellow bricks and pieces of bricks {{were used for the}} atrium, the arches, and possibly the dome; some brick pieces were used to fill spaces between the stones on the walls.|$|E
5|$|The classic legionary scutum, a convex {{rectangular}} shield, also disappeared {{during the}} 3rd century. All troops except archers adopted large, wide, usually dished, ovoid (or sometimes round) shields. These shields were still called Scuta or Clipei, despite {{the difference in}} shape. Shields, from examples found at Dura Europos and Nydam, were of vertical plank construction, the planks <b>glued,</b> and mostly faced inside and out with painted leather. The edges of the shield were bound with stitched rawhide, which shrank as it dried improving structural cohesion.|$|E
5|$|The sticky {{bomb was}} a glass flask filled with {{nitroglycerin}} and given an adhesive coating {{allowing it to}} be <b>glued</b> to a passing vehicle. In theory, it could be thrown, but in practice it would most likely need to be placed—thumped against the target with sufficient force to stick—requiring courage and good fortune to be used effectively. An order for one million sticky bombs was placed in June 1940, but various problems delayed their distribution in large numbers until early 1941, {{and it is likely}} that fewer than 250,000 were produced.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We study <b>glue</b> {{operators}} used in component-based frameworks {{to obtain}} systems as {{the composition of}} atomic components described as labeled transition systems (LTS). <b>Glue</b> operators map tuples of LTS into LTS. They restrict the behavior of their arguments by performing memoryless coordination. In a previous paper, we have proposed a simple format for SOS rules that captures, in particular, <b>glue</b> operators from known frameworks such as CCS, SCCS, CSP, and BIP. This paper studies a new way for characterizing <b>glue</b> operators: as boolean <b>glue</b> constraints between interactions (sets of ports) {{and the state of}} the coordinated components. We provide an SOS format for <b>glue,</b> which allows a natural correspondence between <b>glue</b> operators and <b>glue</b> constraints. This correspondence is used for automated synthesis of <b>glue</b> operators implementing given <b>glue</b> constraints. By focusing on the properties that do not bear computation, we reduce a very hard (and, in general, undecidable) problem of synthesizing controllers to a tractable one. The examples in the paper show that such properties are natural and can be expressed as <b>glue</b> constraints in a straightforward manner. Finally, we compare expressiveness of the proposed formalisms with the <b>glue</b> used in the BIP framework and discuss possible applications. ...|$|R
40|$|Iatrogenic preterm prelabor rupture of {{membranes}} (iPPROM) {{remains the}} main complication after invasive interventions into the intrauterine cavity. Here, the proteolytic stability of mussel-mimetic tissue adhesive (mussel <b>glue)</b> and its sealing behavior on punctured fetal membranes are evaluated. The proteolytic degradation of mussel <b>glue</b> and fibrin <b>glue</b> were compared in vitro. Critical pressures of punctured and sealed fetal membranes were determined under close to physiological conditions using a custom-made inflation device. An inverse finite element procedure {{was applied to}} estimate mechanical parameters of mussel <b>glue.</b> Mussel <b>glue</b> was insensitive whereas fibrin <b>glue</b> was sensitive towards proteolytic degradation. Mussel <b>glue</b> sealed 3. 7 mm fetal membrane defect up to 60 mbar (45 mmHg) when applied under wet conditions, whereas fibrin <b>glue</b> needed dry membrane surfaces for reliable sealing. The mussel <b>glue</b> can be represented by a neo-Hookean material model with elastic coefficient C(1) = 9. 63 kPa. Ex-vivo-tested mussel <b>glue</b> sealed fetal membranes and resisted pressures achieved during uterine contractions. Together with good stability in proteolytic environments, this makes mussel <b>glue</b> a promising sealing material for future applications...|$|R

5|$|Thin {{sectioning}} was {{an early}} procedure used to analyse fossilised material contained in coal balls. The process required cutting a coal ball with a diamond saw, then flattening and polishing the thin section with an abrasive.

Although the process could be done with a machine, {{the large amount of}} time needed and the poor quality of samples produced by thin sectioning gave way to a more convenient method.|$|E
5|$|Even the maps, {{of which}} Tolkien {{originally}} proposed five, were considered and debated.

In the end the cost, as well as the shading of the maps, which would be difficult to reproduce, resulted in the final design of two maps as endpapers, Thror's map, and the Map of Wilderland, both printed in black and red on the paper's cream background.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Manchester Art Gallery staff {{determined}} that if conservation work were not undertaken, the painting {{would soon be}} beyond repair. The Esmée Fairbairn Foundation and AXA Art Insurance provided funding for the restoration. A replacement canvas to which the painting had been attached in the 1930s was removed. Following this, a mixture of isinglass adhesive and chalk was used to restore {{the surface of the}} painting, and the paint added during the earlier attempted restoration was removed.

50|$|Hide <b>glue</b> also {{functions}} {{as its own}} clamp. Once the <b>glue</b> begins to gel, it pulls the joint together. Violin makers may <b>glue</b> the center seams of top and back plates together using a rubbed joint rather than using clamps. This technique involves coating half of the joint with hot hide <b>glue,</b> and then rubbing the other half against the joint until the hide <b>glue</b> starts to gel, {{at which point the}} <b>glue</b> becomes tacky. At this point the plate is set aside without clamps, and the hide <b>glue</b> pulls the joint together as it hardens.|$|R
