5|$|C'est trop bête d'en parler (It's {{too stupid}} to talk about). There was a break. Coppi {{attacked}}. His brother Fausto gave him a push to get him away. He wanted his brother to win. I waited a bit and then I attacked and I caught him and the break. Then I went off by myself. I {{was going to win}} Paris–Roubaix. At the entrance to the vélodrome, there were crowds everywhere, blocking the way. I looked around for where to go and I was directed round the outside wall of the track, to where the team cars had to park. It wasn't like nowadays, when there's television and everything. Then it was more chaotic and the whole road was blocked. People said <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> the way into the track. But how do you know a thing like {{that at the end of}} Paris–Roubaix, when you've raced all day over roads like that? A gendarme signalled the way to go and that's the way I went.|$|E
500|$|In addition, I {{had fallen}} to some extent, not as much perhaps as did some other foreigners, for the [...] "agrarian reformer" [...] guff. [...] <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> better than this, {{particularly}} since the Chinese Communists themselves never at any time made claim to being anything but revolutionaries – period.|$|E
500|$|After {{the final}} whistle Plymouth Argyle's captain Michael Heathcote {{received}} the winners' trophy before parading {{it in front}} of the club's supporters on the pitch. For the club's manager, Neil Warnock, it was his fourth play-off success at Wembley Stadium. He commented on his past experiences that [...] "It can't be a hindrance, having done it before, but it doesn't make it any less tense. It makes it a very long season. I had booked a holiday starting today - I suppose <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> better".|$|E
6000|$|... "You are changed, Herbert; a {{great deal}} changed," [...] she said sadly, [...] "although <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>know</b> you anywhere. You are so much thinner than when I saw you last; but your eyes have not changed, nor your smile. Of course your hair having got gray makes a difference, and--and--" [...] and she stopped.|$|R
60|$|But for my quick tongue <b>I</b> <b>should</b> never <b>have</b> <b>known</b> that he {{realized}} fully all my folly.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Mary, I do {{not think}} you have been bad at all. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> been sorry that that had happened, and that <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> <b>known</b> it." ...|$|R
500|$|On February 26, 2010, the Ethics Committee {{issued its}} report. [...] It {{determined}} that Rangel had violated House gift rules, by accepting reimbursement for his {{travel to the}} conferences. [...] It found {{that he had not}} known of the contributions, but concluded that he was still responsible for them and was required to repay their cost. [...] Five other members were cleared of having violated rules, but were also required to repay their trips. [...] Rangel disagreed with the committee's finding, saying: Because they were my staff members who knew, one of whom has been discharged, [...] that <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known.</b> Common sense dictates that members of Congress should not be held responsible for what could be the wrongdoing, or mistakes, or errors of staff.|$|E
500|$|Jackson herself would {{comment on}} the album's legacy on her 2015 album Unbreakable. In the song [...] "Shoulda Known Better", she {{reflects}} on her optimistic wish that Rhythm Nation 1814 could have profoundly changed the world, noting that there are many, deeper issues to fix and that broad strokes aren't enough. The chorus includes the line, [...] "Cause I don't want my face to be / That poster child for being naive"; and Rhythm Nations title {{is referred to as}} [...] "an epiphany", with Jackson mentioning that [...] "next time, I'll know better." [...] Album co-producer Jimmy Jam told the BBC: [...] "When you're young, you feel like: 'I can change the world! I'm going to lead the revolution!' And then you look 25 years later and you go: 'OK, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> better. The same problems still exist but there's a different way to go about tackling it. It still involves mobilising people, but I can't do it by myself.' It's just a wiser, more mature look at the reality of trying to make a positive change, a social change." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nixon was furious: [...] "Why {{the hell}} did this happen? A {{decision}} of that magnitude, without— <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> about it, Henry. Because {{this is something we}} told— You remember: We, we, we told Laird, 'Keep pressure on there in March.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I see,' rejoined Ralph, {{with the}} same steady gaze. 'Bad, indeed! <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> <b>known</b> you, Sir Mulberry. Dear, dear! This IS bad.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, {{that would}} not have done at all, because then <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> <b>known</b> what effect my cry is likely to produce on unexpectant ears." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Captain Spike, {{what can}} be the meaning of all these changes? The tamper of your vessel is so much altered that <b>I</b> declare <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> <b>known</b> her!" ...|$|R
2500|$|In February 2011, Abdul-Jabbar {{announced}} via Twitter {{that his}} leukemia {{was gone and}} he was [...] "100% cancer free". A few days later, he clarified his misstatement. [...] "You're never really cancer-free and <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> that", Abdul-Jabbar said. [...] "My cancer right now is at an absolute minimum".|$|E
2500|$|Aberdeen is {{mentioned}} in Under the Lake, the third {{episode of the}} ninth series of the popular science fiction show Doctor Who. Looking to portray a socially acceptable level of empathy, The Doctor flips {{through a series of}} cue cards. One of the cards reads, [...] "It was my fault, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> you didn't live in Aberdeen." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{light of}} the solemn protest of my Jewish neighbors, I feel I ought to express clearly and {{unequivocally}} ... my sincere regret that by any act of commission or omission, I should have seemed to lend countenance ... to what <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> to be a cruel libel imputing human sacrifice as a practice now or {{at any time in}} the history of the Jewish people.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, Harry, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> scarce <b>have</b> <b>known</b> you," [...] he said, as the lad came to {{the door}} when he opened it and called him. [...] "You look bad, surely." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> {{thought you}} <b>knew</b> how he spent {{every minute of}} his day.|$|R
6000|$|... "I did {{not know}} it was of any importance," [...] she explained. [...] "Mr. Parable told me nothing. If it hadn't been for chance, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> never <b>have</b> <b>known</b> what was happening." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "Stars on 45" [...] {{is a song}} {{issued in}} January 1981 by the studio group Stars on 45. In some countries, {{including}} the UK, Ireland and New Zealand, the band was credited as 'Starsound' and the medley itself was named [...] "Stars on 45". Its official title in the US (as on the record and in Billboard) where it was credited to 'Stars on 45' was [...] "Medley: Intro 'Venus' / Sugar Sugar / No Reply / I'll Be Back / Drive My Car / Do You Want to Know a Secret / We Can Work It Out / <b>I</b> <b>Should</b> <b>Have</b> <b>Known</b> Better / Nowhere Man / You're Going to Lose That Girl / Stars on 45". It is (to date) the longest titled song to ever chart in Billboard, and is conveniently shortened to [...] "Stars on 45 Medley", or [...] "'Medley' by Stars on 45". The reason for the long title was copyright requirements {{for the use of}} The Beatles' songs.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{has grown}} on me {{from day to}} day; and I have been like a child in {{clinging}} to a hope when <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> {{that there was no}} hope. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> it when you deferred our marriage for three years." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{replied that}} <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> her, anywhere. Which was true enough.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mr. Copperfield and myself,' said Miss Murdstone, {{with severe}} composure, 'are connexions. We were once {{slightly}} acquainted. It {{was in his}} childish days. Circumstances have separated us since. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> <b>known</b> him.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot say for certain, Featherstone, {{although}} <b>I</b> <b>should</b> {{think that}} she is, but she is so changed <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> <b>known</b> her again in the least; besides, all her hair is cut close." ...|$|R
6000|$|But still I must own, [...] <b>I</b> <b>should</b> never <b>have</b> <b>known,</b> [...] From your verses {{what else}} she deserv'd, [...] Your pain seem'd so great, [...] I pitied your fate, [...] As your fair was so dev'lish reserv'd.|$|R
6000|$|Sebald. [...] My God! [...] Those morbid, olive, faultless shoulder-blades-- [...] <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> {{there was}} no blood beneath! ...|$|E
60|$|But {{he had no}} idea {{of drawing}} back, as <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> had I been acquainted with him longer.|$|E
6000|$|... "Tom Lightfoot! is it you? You are {{not much}} altered. Mr. Dane, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> you anywhere!" [...] with {{corresponding}} shakes of the hand.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Dear me!' he replied, 'what {{a clever}} wife I have got! If {{you had not}} told me <b>I</b> <b>should</b> never <b>have</b> <b>known</b> {{that there was any}} wool on the wheel at all. But now I really do seem to see something.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{need not}} say how do you do, Miss Ashleigh," [...] he said, coming forward {{to shake hands with}} me. [...] "Your looks speak for themselves. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> hardly <b>have</b> <b>known</b> you; how you have grown, and how very pretty you have become." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If it had {{not been}} my own clothes you are wearing, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> <b>known</b> you again," [...] he said. [...] "The count bade me ask you if you had need of money? If so, I was to hand you this purse." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] she admitted, [...] "I {{really had}} my fancies {{for a moment}} or two, though I blamed myself afterward. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> better." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is no need, Higgs, {{since it}} is in your mouth already. Well, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> you anywhere; but then your hair doesn't go white." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Keep up your bright swords, for the dew will rust them ... Were it my cue to fight, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> it [...] Without a prompter."[8] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Whiter than {{it ought}} to be," [...] he said, [...] "but clear and healthy, and very {{different}} from what it was when I saw you before you came out. You have grown wonderfully, child. Really, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> hardly <b>have</b> <b>known</b> you again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh dear, no, not of mine at all. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> never <b>have</b> <b>known</b> him {{to speak}} to but for Cecilia." [...] Her words no doubt were true; but again she looked as though endeavouring to tell all she could without {{breaking}} her promise.|$|R
6000|$|It {{was indeed}} a joyful meeting when Mr. and Mrs. Hardy and the girls stepped off the steamer; but the first embrace was {{scarcely}} over when the boys exclaimed simultaneously, 'Why, girls, what is the matter with your faces? <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> <b>known</b> you.' ...|$|R
