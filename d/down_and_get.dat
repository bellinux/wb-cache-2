5|$|The gestational period {{lasts for}} about {{eight and a}} half months, after which a single calf is born. Females in labour do not move away from the female herd and {{repeatedly}} lie <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> up again. Births normally take place in areas with short grass when the cow is in the lying position. She stands up immediately afterwards which causes the umbilical cord to break, vigorously licks the calf and chews on the afterbirth. In spite of regional variations, around 80% of the females give birth to their calves within a period of two to three weeks after the onset of the rainy season - from mid-November to the end of December. Seasonal breeding has also been reported among wildebeest in captivity in European zoos. Twin births have not been reported.|$|E
25|$|One {{method of}} {{learning}} to ski for LW3 competitors with cerebral palsy is the American Teaching System. They first thing skiers learn is what their equipment is, and {{how to put it}} on and take it off. Next, skiers learn about positioning their body in a standing position on flat terrain. After this, the skier learns how to side step, and then how to fall <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> back up again. The skier then learns how to do a straight run, and then is taught how to get on and off the chair lift. This is followed by learning wedge turns and weight transfers, wedge turns, wide track parallel turns, how to use ski poles, and advanced parallel turns.|$|E

25|$|One of the para-Alpine skiing {{techniques}} used by this class {{is called the}} three track method, and was developed {{as part of the}} American Training System. One of the first skills learned using this technique is how to walk with the ski so the skier can learn how to flex the ankle, knee and hip. This allows the skier to determine their centre of gravity. The skier is then taught how hop turn in order to understand arm and leg coordination while on skis. This technique is only used while stationary and is not a competition skill. The skier next learns how to fall <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> back up again. The next skill learned is climbing gentle terrain, followed by learning to go down a straight run and learning to stop. After this, the skier learns how to get on and off a ski lift. This is followed by learning how to traverse the fall line, which teaches the skier how to maintain the ski edge. Other skills are then taught including the Uphill Christie, beginning turns, parallel turns, short swings and moguls.|$|E

When he tried to rob the clinic with his friend Dominique Coombes (Jay Saussey), he was hit over the head by Emily Devine (Michaela Rooney) and briefly hospitalized.
