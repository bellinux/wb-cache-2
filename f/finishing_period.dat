5000|$|Tail biting is {{considered}} one of the major animal welfare problems affecting the fattening of pigs in the swine industry. This is because of the costs to treat and costs due to slower fattening to slaughter weight. There are factors to be taken into account when evaluating how tail biting affects production since they have to do with growth, feed intake, leanness and other production traits. Some of those factors are genetics, breed, gender. A study was done to determine the effects of tail biting during the entire <b>finishing</b> <b>period</b> (also known as [...] "fattening" [...] period). They used three measures to evaluate production: average daily gain (ADG), gross feed conversion ratio (FCR), and red meat percentage (meat %) which included muscle and fat thicknesses.|$|E
40|$|One {{hundred and}} ninety-five {{crossbred}} steers {{were used to}} compare lifetime implant strategies and {{study the effects of}} implanting during the suckling period on performance in the growing and finishing periods. There were no differences in growing period gains when both groups were implanted in the suckling period and the growing period. However, steers implanted in the suckling period but not implanted in the growing period had significantly lower gains than all other treatments including controls. Steers implanted only in the growing period had better feed efficiency in the growing period than both controls and steers implanted only in the suckling period. Steers reimplanted during the <b>finishing</b> <b>period</b> had similar finishing gains regardless of prior implant treatment, and all implanted cattle gained faster than controls in the <b>finishing</b> <b>period.</b> Steers not reimplanted during the <b>finishing</b> <b>period</b> had lower gains than those reimplanted. Implanting in the <b>finishing</b> <b>period</b> resulted in better feed efficiency. All implanted cattle that were reimplanted in the <b>finishing</b> <b>period</b> had higher lifetime gains than controls, but {{there was no difference between}} implant combinations. The only carcass characteristic changed by implanting was quality grade, which was reduced by all implant combinations with the exception of implanting only in the <b>finishing</b> <b>period.</b> Implanting during the suckling period did not reduce cattle performance during the growing and finishing periods when the steers were also implanted during these periods.

40|$|International audienceInfluenza virus infections with subtypes H 1 N 1, H 3 N 2 and H 1 N 2 {{are very}} common in {{domestic}} pigs in Europe. Data on possible differences of population dynamics in finishing pigs in farrow-to-finish herds and in specialised finishing herds are, however, scarce. The presence of sows and weaned piglets on the same premises may, however, affect the exposure of finishing pigs to influenza viruses. In a longitudinal study on 14 farrow-to-finish herds and 15 finishing herds, groups of pigs were followed by repeatedly testing the same animals for antibodies against all three influenza virus subtypes (H 1 N 1, H 3 N 2 and H 1 N 2). At {{the end of the}} <b>finishing</b> <b>period,</b> the seroprevalences in farrow-to-finish and specialised finishing herds were 44. 3 and 62. 0 % respectively for H 1 N 1, 6. 6 and 19. 3 % respectively for H 3 N 2, and 57. 2 and 25. 6 % respectively for H 1 N 2.

40|$|This {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine the effect of programming the rate of gain and delaying the first implant in feedlot steers on feedlot performance and carcass characteristics. Ninety-six growing steers (269 ± 16. 2 kg) were assigned to 12 pens in a completely randomized design. Treatments were implant (Synovex-S®; 20 mg estradiol benzoate and 200 mg progesterone; Fort Dodge Animal Health, Overland Park, KS) on d 1 or no implant and programmed feeding to gain at a slow (0. 68 kg/d) or fast (1. 14 kg/d) rate during the growing period; these treatments were randomly assigned (n = 8) to pens of steers in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement. Steers were fed a growing diet and after 88 and 60 d (for steers fed to gain at a slow or fast rate, respectively), steers were transitioned to ad libitum consumption of a high concentrate finishing diet. Growing period implant treatments did not affect ADG but did affect (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) gain efficiency during the <b>finishing</b> <b>period.</b> Feeding steers for a slow rate of BW gain during the growing period improved (P= 0. 062) gain efficiency in the <b>finishing</b> <b>period</b> (169 vs 145 g gain/kg feed). Correlation coefficients between fat thickness and marbling score obtained via ultrasound and fat thickness and marbling score measured at harvest were greater the closer the ultrasound measurements were made to the final harvest date.

40|$|Objective This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to compare growth performance, blood components and carcass traits by two feeding systems (concentrate with roughage separately [CON] vs total mixed ration [TMR]) in Hanwoo steers, and to learn the relationship between blood components during fattening or finishing phases and carcass traits in Hanwoo steers. Methods Sixty steers aged 8 months were allotted to two feeding systems and fed similar amounts of average dry matter and total digestible nutrient throughout whole experimental period according to each feeding program. Steers were weighed monthly, taken blood at the end of growing, fattening and <b>finishing</b> <b>periods,</b> and slaughtered at 30 month of age. Results Growing performance was higher (p< 0. 05) in the CON group compared to the TMR group during fattening and <b>finishing</b> <b>periods.</b> The CON group was lower (p< 0. 05) in blood aspartic acid transaminase, blood urea nitrogen and retinol levels during growing period, but higher in triglyceride and cholesterol levels during fattening and <b>finishing</b> <b>periods</b> compared to the TMR group. The CON group was greater (p< 0. 05) in rib-eye area, and lighter (p< 0. 05) red in meat color compared to the TMR group. In the correlation coefficients between blood components of steers and carcass traits, retinol had a negative (p< 0. 05) correlation with marbling score and rib-eye area. Leptin had a positive (p< 0. 05) correlation with back fat thickness. Blood cholesterol and triglyceride were positively (p< 0. 05) correlated with carcass weight and rib-eye area. Conclusion Growth performance, carcass ribeye area and meat color showed a more desirable result in the CON compared to the TMR in Hanwoo steers. Assessing the accumulated data of carcass traits with blood components including hormones—particularly retinol, cholesterol, triglyceride, and leptin—during the fattening or finishing phases, {{it may be possible to}} find a biomarker for determining beef quality in living animals...|$|R

On d 63, all steers were implanted with Revalor-S® (Hoechst Roussel Vet, Overland Park, KS) and provided ad libitum access to feed until harvest. From d 63 to 116, ADG and gain efficiency (g gain/kg DMI) for steers programmed-fed to gain slowly were greater (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) than those for steers fed to gain rapidly during the first 62 d of the trial.

Parameters included weight gain, feed intake, feed conversion rate, warm and cold carcass mass, dressing %, subcutaneous fat thickness, hide yield %, internal carcass fat distribution, % bone, % fat and % muscle of the prime rib-cut, carcass classification code, conformation, compactness, post-mortem carcass pH profiles, cooking loss, shear force, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine and residue levels of the beta-adrenergic agonists. No differences were observed between {{any of the four}} treatment groups concerning live feedlot performance. Bulls receiving the S 30 and Zh treatments had lower internal carcass fat distribution compared to C bulls (P < 0. 05). Bulls receiving the S 40 treatment had a lower % fat in the prime rib-cut compared to Zh bulls (P < 0. 05). Carcasses from S 30 bulls had higher pH values 24 hours post mortem compared to carcasses from Zh bulls (P < 0. 01). Meat samples from Zh bulls had higher shear force, which indicates less tender meat, compared to samples from S 40 bulls (P < 0. 05). Change in serum creatinine levels increased only in Zh treated bulls from the start to the end of treatment and may reflect a higher protein turnover in Zh bulls.

40|$|Influenza virus {{infections in}} swine were first {{noticed in the}} US in 1918, during the human {{pandemic}} of the Spanish flu. In Europe, seroprevalences for the three most common swine influenza strains at the moment, H 1 N 1, H 3 N 2 and H 1 N 2, range from 20 - 80 % in finishing pigs {{at the end of}} the <b>finishing</b> <b>period</b> and in sows. However, little is known about the population dynamics of influenza virus within herds, or between herds. By investigating 53 outbreaks of acute respiratory disease over a period of four years, it was established that influenza virus infections are responsible for more than 50 % of the acute respiratory disease outbreaks in swine. Virus circulation in weaned piglets was found to be very common, suggesting that weaned piglets may act as a reservoir for influenza virus in a herd. Virus infections at that time interfere with the presence of maternal antibodies, resulting in no noticeable clinical symptoms, but also in a lesser immunity than infections in fully susceptible pigs. The occurrence of influenza virus infections in finishing pigs was quite different in farrow-to finish herds when compared to finishing herds. For all subtypes, influenza virus infections in farrow-to-finish herds occurred mainly at a young age, up to and including the first half of the <b>finishing</b> <b>period.</b> In finishing herds on the other hand, the influenza virus infections mainly occurred in the second half of the <b>finishing</b> <b>period.</b> These differences may have implications for the choice of intervention measures, whether this is intervention through vaccination, or intervention through zoosanitary measures. Vaccines, while potentially highly efficacious, have the disadvantage that they are very specific for one infectious agent, or even one subtype of an infectious agent. The big advantage of zoosanitary measures compared to vaccination is that multiple infectious agents can be addressed at the same time with the same or similar measures. Measures with respect to air filtration and increased hygiene were therefore evaluated. These measures significantly reduced the number of influenza virus infections during the <b>finishing</b> <b>period</b> and therefore most likely also the magnitude of acute respiratory disease. These measures are unlikely to be cost-beneficial when they are only applied for influenza virus infections, but the application of such measures in a broader context may offer some prospect...|$|E
