40|$|<b>Immunoreactive</b> <b>trypsin</b> {{concentration}} and pancreatic lipase activity were {{measured in the}} sera of 33 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. <b>Immunoreactive</b> <b>trypsin</b> was increased (above the normal range) in 16 (48 %) and pancreatic lipase activity in 18 (55 %) patients.

There was a significant correlation between <b>immunoreactive</b> <b>trypsin</b> and pancreatic lipase activity.

40|$|Patients with cystic {{fibrosis}} {{have been found}} to have abnormal serum concentrations of <b>immunoreactive</b> <b>trypsin</b> and abnormal activities of pancreatic isoamylase. A study was undertaken to discover whether activity of pancreatic lipase is also altered in {{cystic fibrosis}}.

Median serum pancreatic lipase activity was significantly lower in patients with cystic fibrosis than in controls, as was <b>immunoreactive</b> <b>trypsin</b> concentration (p less than 0. 0001). Some patients had supranormal lipase concentrations but these were not always associated with absence of malabsorption.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to quantify and compare the effects of sow¿s milk and 2 milk replacer diets (containing clotting or nonclotting protein sources) on exocrine pancreatic secretion, plasma cholecystokinin, and <b>immunoreactive</b> cationic <b>trypsin</b> in pigs. In addition, the relationship between exocrine pancreatic secretion and growth in milk-fed pigs was studied. In a changeover experiment, 9 chronically catheterized pigs of 6. 6 ± 0. 19 kg of BW were studied for 3 wk. Pigs were assigned to each of 3 diets. Exocrine pancreatic secretion was measured from the third to the seventh day on each diet. The protein content and trypsin activity of the pancreatic juice were measured. Blood samples were taken at 10 min before and after milk ingestion and were analyzed for cholecystokinin and <b>immunoreactive</b> cationic <b>trypsin.</b> Pancreatic protein and trypsin secretion did not differ between pigs fed sow¿s milk and those fed milk replacer, but the volume secreted was less for the pigs fed sow¿s milk (0. 75 vs. 1. 03 mL·kg¿ 1 ·h¿ 1; P < 0. 01). A postprandial response to milk intake was not observed. The 2 milk replacer diets did not affect exocrine pancreatic secretion differently. The average exocrine pancreatic secretion (volume, 0. 94 mL·kg¿ 1 ·h¿ 1; protein, 4. 28 mg·kg¿ 1 ·h¿ 1; trypsin, 1. 65 U·kg¿ 1 ·h¿ 1) was intermediate between literature values for suckling and weaned pigs. Plasma cholecystokinin was elevated (18 pmol·L¿ 1) and showed low correlations with the pancreatic secretion traits. Plasma <b>immunoreactive</b> cationic <b>trypsin</b> was not significantly related to any of the pancreatic secretion traits and should therefore not be used as an indicator for exocrine pancreatic function in milk-fed pigs. Exocrine pancreatic secretion varied substantially among individual pigs (protein, 0. 22 to 13. 98 mg·kg¿ 1 ·h¿ 1). Pancreatic protein and trypsin secretion showed a positive, nonlinear relationship with performance traits. It was concluded that neither specific sow¿s milk ingredients nor the protein source are responsible for a low pancreatic protein secretion in suckling pigs. Exocrine pancreatic secretion was positively correlated with ADG in pigs at an identical milk intake...|$|R
40|$|Operative {{specimens}} {{from various}} parts of gastroduodenal mucosa were analysed for <b>immunoreactive</b> pancreatic secretory <b>trypsin</b> inhibitor (PSTI) using a peroxidase-antiperoxidase method. Normal gastric mucosa exhibited a varying degree of PSTI immunoreactivity, which was more pronounced in the foveolar cells of gastric mucosa of fundus type than in the non-pepsinogen producing antrum-pyloric mucosa. With the exception of metaplastic Paneth cells and some goblet cells, the intracellular content of PSTI was low in gastric mucosa with intestinal metaplasia.

40|$|When {{the time}} {{structure}} (chronome) of pancreatic secretion was studied after weaning in 5 -week-old pigs, the zero-amplitude (no-rhythm) assumption was rejected for the about-weekly (circaseptan, CS) and about-half-weekly (circasemiseptan, CSS) chronome components. When {{the data were}} assessed individually on a day-to-day basis, a 24 -hour component was suggested (P<. 10) for the variables measured in the pancreatic secretion. The circadian pattern showed a gradually increasing range of oscillation. Group results by population-mean cosinor analysis failed to demonstrate a statistically significant circadian and ultradian variation, mostly because of large inter-individual differences. No statistically significant circadian variation could be demonstrated either for plasma concentrations of insulin, glucose, glucagon or <b>Immunoreactive</b> Cationic <b>Trypsin</b> (IRCT). In 7 -week-old pigs fed {{three times a day}} and kept in dim, white light, the pancreatic secretion exhibited a pattern characterised by distinct meal-related secretions, and by non-food-stimulated secretions. In animals that were later transferred to a regimen of 12 hours of light alternating with 12 hours of darkness (LD 12 : 12), there was no distinct response of the pancreatic secretion to the meal given during the dark span. Apart from the anticipated circadian rhythm demonstrable by single cosinor analysis on a group basis, prominent 8 -hour and an about 3. 43 -hour components were statistically significant. These data indicate that the circadian variation of exocrine and endocrine pancreatic secretion, glucose and IRCT immediately after weaning, at five weeks of age is still developing and is not yet synchronized among the different piglets fed ad libitum. Pancreatic secretions become circadian periodic by the 7 th (but not by the 5 th) week of age when their response to a standard meal also becomes circadian-stage dependent...|$|R
40|$|Trypsin in {{duodenal}} aspirate {{and pure}} pancreatic juice samples has been measured by both radioimmunoassay and enzymatic mathods. The radioimmunossay {{has been shown}} to be specific and to detect trypsin in the presence of aprotinin (Trasylol). In duodenal juice samples from control subjects and from patients with primary biliary cirrhosis a good correlation was obtained between both <b>immunoreactive</b> <b>trypsin</b> concentration and trypsin activity. The immunoreactive trypsinogen concentration in pure pancreatic juice also correlated well with activated trypsin activity. The mean <b>immunoreactive</b> <b>trypsin</b> concentration and the concentration of enzymatically inert <b>immunoreactive</b> <b>trypsin</b> in duodenal juice samples from patients with primary biliary cirrhosis were significantly lower than controls, suggesting pancreatic hyposecretion in this disease. After five duodenal juice samples had been stored for three months at - 70 degrees C, <b>immunoreactive</b> <b>trypsin</b> concentration in samples stored without Trasylol were reduced by 12. 0 +/- 4. 2 (mean +/- SD) times the concentration of samples stored in Trasylol.

An increase of elastase 1, alpha 1 -antitrypsin and alpha 2 -macroglobulin was detected in pancreatic cancer, chronic pancreatitis and extra-pancreatic diseases; no changes were found for serum <b>immunoreactive</b> <b>trypsin.</b> Multiple regression analyses showed that only 7 % of elastase 1 was explained by inhibitors with alpha 1 -antitrypsin playing a major role.

40|$|Elastase 1 and <b>immunoreactive</b> <b>trypsin</b> were {{assessed}} by a RIA technique in the sera of 29 control subjects, 24 pancreatic cancer patients, 22 {{patients with chronic}} pancreatitis and 31 with extra-pancreatic diseases to ascertain and compare their usefulness in chronic pancreatic disease diagnosis. Increased levels of elastase 1 were detected in 60. 9 % of pancreatic cancer and in 61. 1 % of chronic pancreatitis patients; low values were found in only two subjects with pancreatic disease. A close correlation between the two enzymes was found in patients suffering from pancreatic cancer and chronic pancreatitis. These data suggest that serum elastase 1, as well as <b>immunoreactive</b> <b>trypsin,</b> is of limited value in chronic pancreatic disease diagnosis; increased levels of the two enzymes always occur simultaneously; low <b>immunoreactive</b> <b>trypsin</b> values together with normal elastase 1 serum levels are detectable {{in a number of}} patients with chronic pancreatitis and severe exocrine insufficiency...|$|E

Over almost three years, more than 120 000 specimens were screened and 37 infants detected with cystic fibrosis. Four additional fibrocystic patients were missed on screening: two had negative <b>immunoreactive</b> <b>trypsin</b> values, of which one had meconium ileus, and two, although giving initial positive tests, were negative on follow up.

40|$|Exocrine {{pancreatic}} {{involvement of}} primary Sjögren's syndrome (SS) was studied. Pancreatic enzyme levels (total amylase, pancreatic isoamylase and <b>immunoreactive</b> <b>trypsin)</b> along with anti-ductuli antibodies (Ab) were studied in 77 patients with primary SS. In 10 patients with normal and 10 with abnormal enzyme levels pancreatic CT scans were also obtained. All enzyme levels were significantly increased {{in comparison to}} the control group. <b>Immunoreactive</b> <b>trypsin</b> was found to be the most frequently increased enzyme (35. 3 % of pSS patients). Anti-ductuli Ab were not found in any patient. Pancreatic CT scans were normal in all subjects with enzymatic increase, whereas 2 abnormal scans were demonstrated in patients without enzyme changes.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the role of circulating free trypsinogen and renal tubular dysfunction in affecting trypsin plasma-urine transfer, serum <b>immunoreactive</b> <b>trypsin</b> (IRT), its urinary output, IRT molecular size distribution, filtrable <b>immunoreactive</b> <b>trypsin,</b> gamma-glutamyltransferase and alpha-glucosidase outputs were studied in 6 control subjects, 9 patients with pancreatic cancer and 15 with chronic pancreatitis. The majority of immunoreactivity was always eluted at a molecular weight of about 24, 000 and might therefore be considered as free trypsinogen. Variable amounts of IRT at higher molecular weights, possibly represented by trypsin-inhibitor complexes, were also detected. Increasing IRT levels were generally accounted for by free trypsinogen, regardless {{of the nature of}} the disease. Unlike serum free trypsinogen levels, renal tubular damage, evaluated by means of the excretion of two high-molecular weight urinary enzymes, seems to play a prominent role in explaining trypsin plasma-urine transfer...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} of serum <b>immunoreactive</b> <b>trypsin</b> concentration and pancreatic isoamylase activity {{in patients with}} diabetes mellitus has shown that exocrine pancreatic deficit is maximal in insulin dependent diabetics, intermediate in those controlled with sulphonylureas, and absent in patients controlled with biguanides or diet or both. A significant correlation between the serum concentrations of both these pancreatic enzymes and C peptide was found. Serum pancreatic enzyme concentrations were not related to glycosylated haemoglobin concentrations, the dosage of insulin, or the age of onset of diabetes. The concentration of <b>immunoreactive</b> <b>trypsin</b> {{was found to be}} low in most of the insulin dependent diabetics in whom this enzyme was measured {{at the time of the}} clinical onset of diabetes. Thus exocrine pancreatic deficit in diabetes closely parallels the endocrine beta cell deficit and occurs concurrently with, or antedates, the clinical presentation of type I diabetes.

40|$|SUMMARY To {{assess the}} exocrine {{pancreatic}} function in f-thalassaemia major with iron overload, serum <b>immunoreactive</b> <b>trypsin</b> (IRT) {{was measured in}} 38 patients with this condition.

Whereas subnormal IRT concentrations were more frequent in patients of more than 12 years old, supranormal IRT concentrations were more frequent in younger patients. These data provide the first antemortem evidence of exocrine pancreatic damage in this condition. They also suggest that this acinar cell damage is initially associated with a rise in IRT which {{is followed by a}} fall in the serum concentration of this enzyme. Exocrine pancreatic abnormalities based on post-mortem examination have been described in patients with iron overload.

40|$|Plasmatic <b>immunoreactive</b> <b>trypsin</b> (IRT), {{thromboxane}} and trypsin-like {{enzymatic activity}} were measured in 117 patients {{at risk of}} developing adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (53 multiple injury, 30 abdominal surgery, 17 acute pancreatitis, 12 burnt and 5 disseminated intravascular coagulation patients). 69 of these patients developed ARDS. <b>Immunoreactive</b> <b>trypsin</b> and thromboxane were measured by radio-immuno-assay and trypsin-like enzymatic activity by spectrophotometry, using a specific chromogenic substrate. Mean IRT value was 675 ng/ml in ARDS and 265 ng/ml in non ARDS patients (p less than 0. 05). Mean IRT value was 685 ng/ml in septic and 170 ng/ml in non septic patients (p less than 0. 01). An abnormal trypsin-like enzymatic activity was measured in 26 ARDS patients. In 60 patients (37 ARDS and 23 non ARDS), thromboxane appeared in plasma simultaneously or about 24 hours after the beginning of IRT release. The importance of thromboxane release parallels the intensity of IRT. Originating from pancreas, trypsin can appear in plasma either by absorption from gastrointestinal tract or after pancreatic ischemia. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|In {{patients}} with pancreatic cancer deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) serum levels {{were compared with}} those of other known pancreatic enzymes. Serum deoxyribonuclease I, elastase 1, <b>immunoreactive</b> <b>trypsin,</b> amylase and phospholipase A 2 were determined in 40 healthy controls, 28 {{patients with}} pancreatic cancer, 49 with chronic pancreatitis and 40 with extra-pancreatic diseases. The analysis of variance showed a significant difference among groups for serum DNase I values. However, none of the 3 groups of patients had a mean deoxyribonuclease I value higher than that of the healthy controls. In pancreatic cancer and chronic pancreatitis patients, increases in the 4 pancreatic enzymes values were found in percentages that were higher than those for DNase I. A significant correlation was found between DNase I and phospholipase A 2, but not between DNase I and elastase 1, <b>immunoreactive</b> <b>trypsin</b> and amylase serum activities. The findings indicate that deoxyribonuclease I serum determination is an even less satisfactory index of pancreatic malignancy than the other pancreatic enzymes.

40|$|The {{clinical}} {{value of}} estimation of serum concentrations of <b>immunoreactive</b> <b>trypsin</b> was evaluated by studying 46 healthy controls, 23 controls in hospital, 44 {{patients with chronic}} pancreatic disease, and 184 patients with non-pancreatic conditions in which pancreatic disease commonly enters into the differential diagnosis. Serum trypsin concentration had a log normal distribution in the controls, and the calculated normal range was considerably wider than that previously reported. The concentration was abnormal in only 13 out of 27 patients with chronic pancreatitis and was extremely variable in patients with pancreatic cancer. Abnormal results occurred in 11 % of the patients with non-pancreatic disease. Eighteen patients had a subnormal trypsin concentration, of whom six did not have pancreatic disease and 12 had either chronic pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer. There was no correlation between serum trypsin concentration and mean tryptic activity {{as measured by the}} Lundh test. Of 11 patients with pancreatic steatorrhoea, only seven had subnormal trypsin concentrations.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} balance between trypsin and {{protease}} inhibitors simultaneously in the systemic circulation and in the thoracic lymph and peritoneal exudate. METHODS: Twenty patients with early severe acute pancreatitis were studied. Enzymatically active and <b>immunoreactive</b> <b>trypsin</b> in conjunction with its major inhibitors were measured in the 3 compartments {{at the onset of}} end-organ failure(s). The molecular forms of trypsin were determined in the lymph and ascites by gel filtration chromatography to separate trypsinogen and free-and inhibitor-bound trypsin. RESULTS: Both enzymatically active trypsin and <b>immunoreactive</b> <b>trypsin</b> levels were highest in ascites and lymph compared with the systemic circulation. Intracompartmental alpha 1 - protease inhibitor gradient moved in the opposite direction, whereas alpha 2 macroglobulin concentration was highest in ascites and lowest in the lymph. Although most of the enzymatically and immunoreactive material in ascites and lymph consisted of trypsin complexed with alpha 2 macroglobulin and trypsinogen, respectively, free active trypsin was detected in more than 80 % of the samples. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with early severe acute pancreatitis, there is a significant trypsinogen activation resulting in protease-antiprotease imbalance and thereby free enzymatically active trypsin in the 2 body fluid compartments in close vicinity to the inflammatory process. This may be involved in the pathophysiology of local and distant tissue damage...|$|E

40|$|The {{incidence}} of cystic fibrosis {{over the last}} 10 years in East Anglia (a region of the United Kingdom {{with a population of}} 2. 1 million) has halved. This has happened during the establishment of a neonatal screening programme, which has enabled early diagnosis, genetic counselling, and lately the option of prenatal diagnosis in subsequent pregnancies. One hundred and seven children were born with cystic fibrosis between 1981 and 1990, eight of whom were siblings. The Guthrie blood spots of 82 infants detected by neonatal <b>immunoreactive</b> <b>trypsin</b> screening between 1981 and 1990 were examined for the presence of the most common cystic fibrosis gene mutation (delta F 508). It was present in 135 (82 %) of the 164 cystic fibrosis genes analysed with 54 (66 %) cases being homozygous and 27 (33 %) heterozygous. Sixty nine per cent of infants were symptomatic at the time of diagnosis regardless of genotype. No association was found between the early clinical or biochemical features of the disease and homozygosity or heterozygosity for this mutation.

40|$|The {{neonatal}} screening protocol for cystic fibrosis (CF) {{is based on}} a first determination of blood <b>immunoreactive</b> <b>trypsin</b> (IRT 1), followed by a first level genetic test that includes the 31 worldwide most common mutations of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene (DNA 31), and a second determination of blood <b>immunoreactive</b> <b>trypsin</b> (IRT 2). This approach identifies, in addition to affected subjects, a high proportion of newborns with hypertrypsinaemia at birth, in whom only one mutation is identified and who have a negative or borderline sweat test and pancreatic sufficiency. Although {{it has been suggested that}} hypertrypsinaemia may be caused by a single CFTR mutation, whether such neonates should be merely considered as healthy carriers remains a matter of debate as hypertrypsinaemia at birth may be a biochemical marker of a CFTR malfunction because of a second mild mutation. We analyzed, by means of an extended sequencing protocol, 32 newborns who tested positive at an IRT 1 /DNA 31 /IRT 2 screening protocol and in whom only one CFTR mutation was found. The results obtained demonstrate that 62. 5 % of these newborns were also carrying a second mild CFTR mutation. The high proportion of compound heterozygous subjects, combined with the results of a 4 -year follow-up in nine of these subjects all of whom displaying initial CF clinical symptoms, suggest that it may be possible to use the IRT 1 /DNA 31 /IRT 2 protocol of {{neonatal screening}} to identify newborns with atypical forms of CF.

Normal gastric and colonic mucosa and some goblet cells in the small intestine showed positive PSTI immunoreactivity but no endoprotease immunoreactivity. The presence of <b>immunoreactive</b> <b>trypsin</b> and immunoreactive PSTI in the Paneth cells, which are of secretory type, probably indicates an important extrapancreatic source of these proteins rather than a storage of endocytosed material...|$|E
40|$|Cystic {{fibrosis}} {{is one of}} {{the severe}} childhood disorders with early manifestation of multiple organ involvement. The respiratory and digestive tracts are suffered the most, the prognosis of disease course depends on the degree of the impairment of these systems.   The results of the analysis of cystic fibrosis prevalence in Primorsky Krai according to the neonatal <b>immunoreactive</b> <b>trypsin</b> screening in 102   251 newborn are shown in the article. The age, sex, clinical and severity structure of cystic fibrosis was studied in 71 children. The prevalence of 13 mutations of transmembrane regulator conductance gene in 41 patients was determined. Correlations between time of pulmonary complications manifestation, P. Aeruginosa infection development, chronic hypoxemia degree, malnutrition, genetic status and severity of the disease were found. </p...|$|E
40|$|<b>Immunoreactive</b> <b>trypsin</b> (IRT) {{content in}} blood spots from 17 cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF) children born between 1975 - 80 were assayed with reagents from two commercial radioimmunoassay kits. The manufacturers' procedures were modified to allow assay of blood spot IRT. Half of the CF samples {{had a significantly}} raised IRT content compared to normal blood spots. Of the blood spots from five children whose meconium screening gave negative results, three or five (depending on the kit used) had a raised IRT content. On the other hand, less than 50 % of children initially detected by meconium screening had raised blood spot IRT values. In our hands, analysis of blood spots for IRT does not consistently identify the newborn with CF and offers no advantage over other screening methods...|$|E
40|$|Summary: The {{three most}} {{important}} enzymes present in duodenal fluid, α-amylase, trypsin and lipase, were determined by two different methods. Various dilution fluids for these determinations were compared. Some kinetic data are described together with the reproducibility of the assays. For α-amylase the Phadebas method was compared with an UV method. Trypsin was determined using an <b>immunoreactive</b> <b>trypsin</b> test and a titrimetric method, while lipase was determined with a titrimetric method and a Cu-soap method. There was very good agreement between the two α-amylase methods and between the two trypsin determina-tions. There was also good agreement between both lipase methods. The {{advantages and disadvantages of}} all the methods are discussed. Bestimmung von a-Amylase, Trypsin und Lipase in Duodenalsaft: Ein Vergleich von Methode...|$|E
