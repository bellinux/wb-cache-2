40|$|The {{object of}} {{analysis}} of this dissertation {{is the process of}} the assertion of the European Community as a distinct and distinctive international actor during the 1970 s. The main argument is that <b>the</b> <b>EC's</b> activity on <b>the</b> global stage underwent a major qualitative change in those years, increasing considerably in intensity and scope. <b>The</b> <b>EC</b> asserted itself not only as a major economic player, but also as a distinct political player. Moreover, its international activity was endowed with a distinctive character. <b>The</b> <b>EC</b> claimed that it was a «force for good», particularly attached to dialogue and cooperation, and aimed at promoting a more balanced and a more just international order, as well as an original and innovative approach to international relations. To be sure, <b>the</b> <b>EC's</b> international activity remained quite fragmentary, often declaratory, and sometimes ineffective. This was hardly surprising. To a large extent, disappointment with <b>the</b> <b>EC's</b> achievements was due to the excessively high expectations that had been held of its activity. Contrary to most existing historiography, I argue that the 1973 – 74 crisis was more a beginning than an ending point <b>for</b> <b>the</b> assertion of <b>the</b> <b>EC</b> as an international actor. In those years its traits and ambitions were defined. The European Council was established and the coherence of <b>the</b> <b>EC's</b> international activity was improved. <b>The</b> <b>EC</b> became a recognizable player at the UN and it gained recognition by basically all of the world's countries. The range of action available <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>EC's</b> international activity was defined and quite a clear division of labor with the member states and with the US was established, leading <b>the</b> <b>EC</b> to focus on “civilian” activities and to cultivate a distinctive profile. This is the first extensive and dedicated historical account of <b>the</b> <b>EC's</b> international activity as a whole during the 1970 s. I consider all the main aspects of it, in order to reconstruct the overall process of assertion of <b>the</b> <b>EC</b> on <b>the</b> international stage and the general traits of <b>the</b> <b>EC</b> as an international actor. I consider how and why such an assertion was promoted, how it was connected to other contemporary developments, and who influenced the definition of the traits of <b>the</b> <b>EC</b> as a global player. I focus on instances where the assertion of <b>the</b> <b>EC</b> on <b>the</b> global stage was debated and its traits were defined. In most cases debates about it were not explicit, and debates on more specific and actual topics worked as proxies for them. As a consequence, I focus on the aspects of <b>the</b> <b>EC's</b> international activity where the fundamental conceptions underlying it were the most apparent. Actors involved in the making of <b>the</b> <b>EC</b> as an international actor often held different views and conceptions of it. The compromise and combination of these different conceptions led to the definition and assertion of <b>the</b> <b>EC's</b> specific traits as an international actor. The main actors involved were the governments of <b>the</b> <b>EC</b> member states – a particularly important role being played by France – but <b>the</b> <b>EC</b> Commission also took some significant initiatives. In order to reconstruct the views of the governments and of the Commission, I rely mainly on archival sources drawn from the archives of <b>the</b> <b>EC</b> institutions and from the archives of the foreign ministries of France, Britain and Germany. The first three chapters of the thesis focus on the process of establishment of <b>the</b> <b>EC</b> as a distinct international actor. Thus, they focus on the definition of the structures, procedures and means for its international activity. I show that the design of <b>the</b> institutional structure <b>for</b> it was quite difficult and it often required to reach fragile and ambiguous compromises. <b>The</b> reason <b>for</b> this was that the institutional design was strongly affected by the member states' views on the final form of European political integration, which were divergent. I look at <b>the</b> means created <b>for</b> <b>the</b> expression of <b>the</b> <b>EC's</b> voice on <b>the</b> international stage, and I argue that the main reason why <b>the</b> <b>EC</b> did not always manage to speak clearly was its member states' reticence about it. <b>The</b> structure <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>EC's</b> international activity was heavily affected not only by institutional constraints, but also by some political ones. These constraints led to the exclusion of entire fields of international affairs from it. I argue that this exclusion strongly affected the traits of <b>the</b> <b>EC</b> as an international actor, by inviting it to focus on specific “civilian” sectors of international affairs. The adoption of a distinctive approach to international affairs was useful <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>EC's</b> assertion, since it made it possible to highlight its original character with regard to its own member states and to <b>the</b> US. <b>The</b> <b>EC</b> sought to assert itself as a distinctive international actor by focusing on fields of international affairs such as development cooperation, dialogue with the developing countries, the promotion of human rights in third countries, and so on. It is towards these fields that I turn to in chapters 4 through 6. In each chapter, I analyze the conceptions underlying <b>the</b> <b>EC's</b> engagement in <b>the</b> field, as well as the image that <b>the</b> <b>EC</b> tried to project on the international stage. I show that <b>the</b> <b>EC</b> consistently tried to convey an image of itself as a «force for good. » However, there was a fundamental mismatch between the discourse and image of <b>the</b> <b>EC</b> as a force for good and its actual policies and initiatives: deeds often fell well short of words. I consider this mismatch, analyzing the reasons why <b>the</b> <b>EC</b> rhetoric set very ambitious goals and why <b>the</b> <b>EC</b> found it very difficult to meet them. Part of <b>the</b> reason <b>for</b> it was that rhetoric was meant to rationalize some of the limited capabilities available <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>EC's</b> international activity, and to make up for them. I argue that <b>the</b> <b>EC</b> established a sort of vicious circle: it resorted to rhetoric in order to make up for its limited capabilities, but this strategy raised very high expectations. <b>The</b> <b>EC</b> was unable to meet these expectations, and as a result the limits of its capabilities were exposed even more...|$|R

40|$|Community {{participation}} {{has become}} {{an essential part of}} school reform, particularly in the educational policies and school management. Community participation in the school management has become a taken for granted reform, which is based on the assumptions that it will improve the educational delivery at the school level by harmonizing activities, utilizing resources more effectively and mobilizing the additional human and financial resources. This reform is widely adopted in the developing countries, including Pakistan. The notion seems to be acceptable but in practice it might prove problematic. The structure, functions and mechanism of community management, and its impact on school performance is not well known. I carried out a systematic research on community-based Education Committees 2 ̆ 7 (EC) role, function and the relationship between the role and school performance, in the context of Pakistan. I employed qualitative and quantitative research approaches in order to obtain some generalizable information about <b>the</b> <b>EC</b> 2 ̆ 7 s management structure and role in the community schools in Karachi, Pakistan. Findings from the studies revealed that ECs had been involved at the administrative and operational level. The management structure, mechanism, background of the committee members and location of the school, had a great influence on the school performance. <b>The</b> <b>ECs</b> had performed a significant role in improving physical resources, retaining teachers 2 ̆ 7 moral and students performance, through maximum participation of the key stakeholders, particularly the school staff in the school management. On the contrary those community management structures with little understanding of the school processes, exclusion of headteachers from the decision-making, and unnecessary monitoring of the school staff had a negative impact on the school performance. Thus the study findings have an implication <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>ECs</b> with regard to the structure of the committee, its composition and the mechanism required and effective involvement in the school management.
