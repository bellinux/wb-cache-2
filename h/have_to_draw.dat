Johnson then warned the jurors they would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> a distinction between evidence and proof.|$|E
25|$|The {{outbreak}} {{increased the}} strain on an economy already {{under pressure from the}} current economic crisis. Although the World Bank said it would extend Mexico $25million in loans for immediate aid and $180million in long-term assistance, it wasn't enough to restore customer investor confidence leading to the peso’s biggest tumble in six months. It seems likely now that Mexico will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> on a $47billion credit line from the International Monetary Fund.|$|E
25|$|A theory {{attributed}} to Pierre Barbet holds that, {{when the whole}} body weight {{was supported by the}} stretched arms, the typical cause of death was asphyxiation. He wrote that the condemned would have severe difficulty inhaling, due to hyper-expansion of the chest muscles and lungs. The condemned would therefore <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> himself up by his arms, leading to exhaustion, or have his feet supported by tying or by a wood block. When no longer able to lift himself, the condemned would die within a few minutes. Some scholars, including Frederick Zugibe, posit other causes of death. Zugibe suspended test subjects with their arms at 60° to 70° from the vertical. The test subjects had no difficulty breathing during experiments, but did suffer rapidly increasing pain, which is consistent with the Roman use of crucifixion to achieve a prolonged, agonizing death. However, Zugibe's positioning of the test subjects' feet are not supported by any archaeological or historical evidence.|$|E

500|$|After a {{creative}} spurt in October resulted in new song ideas, Bono {{proposed that the}} group release a double album. The Edge said: [...] "There would have been two records, depending on which songs we decided to finish. There was this one album, the 'blues' album that Bono was talking about, and another, much more 'European', {{which is kind of}} the way I was led." [...] Eno cautioned the group about pursuing the material, telling the Edge: [...] "I know that any one of these new ideas is good enough to make the record, but we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> the line somewhere. If we even consider any of them we'll still be here in three months time." [...] U2 relented, shelving the new songs to avoid missing their deadline to complete the album. Recording for The Joshua Tree wrapped up in November 1986. Rough mixes had been created throughout the sessions after each song was recorded to, in Lanois' words, take [...] "snapshots along the way ... because sometimes you go too far". The Edge explained that the arrangement and production of each song was approached individually and that while there was a strong uniform direction, they were prepared to [...] "sacrifice some continuity to get the rewards of following each song to a conclusion".|$|E
500|$|After {{receiving}} the go-ahead {{to work on}} the project, Moore and Gibbons spent a day at the latter's house creating characters, crafting details for the story's milieu and discussing influences. The pair was particularly influenced by a Mad parody of Superman named [...] "Superduperman"; Moore said, [...] "We wanted to take Superduperman 180 degrees—dramatic, instead of comedic". Moore and Gibbons conceived of a story that would take [...] "familiar old-fashioned superheroes into a completely new realm"; the writer said his intention was to create [...] "a superhero Moby Dick; something that had that sort of weight, that sort of density". The writer came up with the character names and descriptions, but left the specifics of how they looked to Gibbons. Gibbons did not sit down and design the characters deliberately, but rather [...] "did it at odd times [...] spend maybe two or three weeks just doing sketches." [...] Gibbons designed his characters to make them easy to draw; Rorschach was his favorite to draw because [...] "you just <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> a hat. If you can draw a hat, then you've drawn Rorschach, you just draw kind of a shape for his face and put some black blobs on it and you're done." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{movement}} {{opens with}} the soloist playing the four-measure principal theme alone; {{it is then}} repeated by the orchestra. This theme is, {{in the words of}} Michael Steinberg, one of [...] "extreme simplicity". Mozart's first sketch of the movement was much more complex. He likely simplified the theme to provide a greater contrast with the dark intensity of the first movement. After the orchestra repeats the principal theme there is a very simple bridge or transitional passage that Girdlestone calls [...] "but a sketch" [...] to be ornamented by the soloist, arguing that [...] "to play it as printed is to betray the memory of Mozart". Following the bridge passage, the soloist plays the initial four-measure theme for a second time, before the orchestra commences a new section of the movement, in C minor. A brief return of the principal theme, its rhythm altered, separates the C minor section from a section in A-flat major. After this new section, the principal theme returns to mark the end of the movement, its rhythm altered yet again. Now, the theme is played twice by the soloist, the two appearances being connected by the same simple bridge passage {{from the beginning of the}} movement. Girdlestone argues that here [...] "the soloist will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> on his imagination to adorn [...] a second time". The overall structure of the movement is thus ABACA, making the movement in rondo form.|$|E
500|$|It's {{something}} that's {{very difficult}} for me. Because it is lines on paper when I {{do it in the}} comic book series. It's like, 'Oh, okay, Charlie Adlard [...] doesn’t <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> that arrangement of lines anymore, that person is dead.' But it's very uncomfortable for me to be on set, because I see these actors that are there and, in the source material, I have killed all but two of them. I walk through the set and I'm like, 'Yep, killed that one, killed that one, killed that one.' And it is firing those people. I feel really bad for Emma Bell, just because she was great and I {{would have liked to have}} had her in the show. But, you know, this is The Walking Dead, characters have got to die. Thankfully, Emma was brought onto the show with the understanding that she was only going to be in a certain number of episodes and she knew that she was going to die from the very beginning. But it doesn’t really make it any easier. When they were shooting those scenes, I had to fly to Comic-Con and so I wasn’t actually there for when she died. But it was very emotional on set and I know that she was very upset about having to leave the crew and the actors. You kind of become a family when you're doing a TV show and it’s a little upsetting to have to get rid of somebody.|$|E
