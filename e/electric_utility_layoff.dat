40|$|The Financial Statistics of Major US Investor-Owned <b>Electric</b> <b>Utilities</b> {{publication}} presents summary {{and detailed}} financial accounting {{data on the}} investor-owned <b>electric</b> <b>utilities.</b> The objective of the publication is to provide Federal and State governments, industry, {{and the general public}} with current and historical data {{that can be used for}} making policy and decisions relating to investor-owned <b>electric</b> <b>utility</b> issues. The US electric power industry is a combination of <b>electric</b> <b>utilities</b> (investor-owned, publicly owned, Federal, and cooperatives) and nonutility power producers. Investor-owned <b>electric</b> <b>utilities</b> account for over three-fourths of electric sales and revenue. Historically, the investor-owned <b>electric</b> <b>utilities</b> have served the large consolidated markets. There is substantial diversity among the investor-owned <b>electric</b> <b>utilities</b> in terms of services, size, fuel usage, and prices charged. Most investor-owned <b>electric</b> <b>utilities</b> generate, transmit, and distribute electric power. Investor-owned <b>electric</b> <b>utilities</b> operate in all States except Nebraska; Hawaii is the only State in which all electricity is supplied by investor-owned <b>electric</b> <b>utilities.</b> 5 figs., 57 tabs...|$|R

40|$|The {{consumption}} by an <b>electric</b> <b>utility</b> of self-generated electrical energy {{is not subject}} to the surcharge. The {{consumption by}} an <b>electric</b> <b>utility</b> of purchased electrical energy that is used directly, lost by dissipation, or unaccounted for in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles by the <b>electric</b> <b>utility</b> in the process of generation, transmission, and distribution of electrical energy is exempt from the surcharge. However, the surcharge applies to the consumption by <b>electric</b> <b>utilities</b> of purchased electrical energy for any other purpose. (The term “consumption ” does not include the receiving of purchased electrical energy by an <b>electric</b> <b>utility</b> for resale.) When an <b>electric</b> <b>utility</b> purchases electrical energy and pools in its system the energy with electrical energy generated by it, the consumption of electrical energy in this state from the pool by the utility during any quarter shall be deemed to be a consumption of energy generated by it {{to the extent that the}} kilowatt-hours of the electrical energy generated by it during the quarter exceed the kilowatt-hours consumed by the <b>electric</b> <b>utility.</b> When an <b>electric</b> <b>utility</b> consumes electrical energy purchased from another <b>electric</b> <b>utility,</b> which has not been pooled in its system with electrical energy generated by it, the surcharge will apply to the consumption of th...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{identifies}} the growth strategies {{adopted by the}} <b>electric</b> <b>utilities</b> sector {{in the context of}} changes resulting from the deregulation and liberalization of the electricity market. Strategies pursued by the <b>electric</b> <b>utilities</b> sector were rarely the subject of research in the field of strategic management despite the fact that electricity is an indispensable element of everyday life and the economy as a whole. Therefore, a case study of the largest incumbent <b>electric</b> <b>utilities</b> in the Republic of Croatia, Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, and Macedonia has been conducted, and differences in the degree of market liberalization and core features of these companies have been noted. Research findings have shown that the degree of deregulation can affect the growth strategies of <b>electric</b> <b>utilities.</b> In those countries where the degree of deregulation is lower, <b>electric</b> <b>utilities</b> focus on the domestic market. On the other hand, a higher level of deregulation enables <b>electric</b> <b>utilities</b> to achieve their growth through diversification or innovation. Given the fact that the analyzed <b>electric</b> <b>utilities</b> are operating within relatively small economies, they cannot compete with <b>electric</b> <b>utilities</b> in developed countries, and, apart from international electricity trading, are mostly focused on their domestic markets...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} real effects of parent firm {{diversification}} on their <b>electric</b> <b>utility</b> operating companies over the period, 1990 - 2003. Since <b>electric</b> <b>utility</b> operating companies produce a single homogenous product, we can better measure their Total Factor Productivity and make valid comparisons of productivity across firms. We find that, {{consistent with a}} diversification discount, greater parent diversification is associated with lower productivity across <b>electric</b> <b>utility</b> operating companies. However, the productivity of the <b>electric</b> <b>utility</b> operating companies improves with greater parent diversification over time. Diversification appears to provide an alternative channel to divert investment dollars away from overinvestment in the core electric business. Finally, {{we find that the}} improvement in the productivity of the <b>electric</b> <b>utility</b> operating companies from greater parent firm diversification over time is limited to financially constrained firms. This suggests that when managers have no resources to waste, {{it is more likely that}} any diversification activities are carefully planned and undertaken for strategic purposes that can help to increase productivity of the core business. ...|$|R

Although the monopolistic structure of the <b>electric</b> <b>utility</b> industry may convey a perception that an <b>electric</b> <b>utility</b> is unaffected by competition, this is an erroneous perception with regard to industry. <b>Electric</b> <b>utilities</b> face increased competition, both from other utilities and from industrial self-generation. The paper discusses competition for industrial customers and innovative pricing trends that have evolved nationally to meet the growing competition for industrial sales. Cogeneration activities and the emerging concepts of wheeling power are also discussed. Specifics of industry evaluation and reaction to utility pricing are presented. Also enumerated are examples of the response various utilities throughout the United States have made {{to the needs of}} their industrial customers through innovative rate design. Industry/utility cooperation can result in benefits to industry, to the <b>electric</b> <b>utility</b> and to all other ratepayers.

40|$|The <b>electric</b> <b>utility</b> {{industry}} is entering {{an era of}} unprecedented competition. Competition from traditional sources such as natural gas companies, customer cogeneration, and independent power producers are being joined by new sources of competition, namely, other <b>electric</b> <b>utilities.</b> Compounding this situation are two recent occurrences: 1) {{the passage of the}} Energy Policy Act of 1992 which encourages wheeling, and 2) the trend toward institutional and industrial customers outsourcing energy generation and production facilities to third-parties.
