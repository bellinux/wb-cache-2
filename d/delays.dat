The <b>delays</b> left only two days for printing the film and sending it to theatres, generating significant anxiety over a possible delay in the release.

A <b>delay</b> reference loop is also presented to tune the <b>delay</b> stage against process, voltage, and temperature variations. A reference signal is introduced to tune the <b>delay.</b> The impact of non-idealities must be considered to {{understand the relationship between}} the reference frequency and the locked time <b>delay.</b> A SiGe BiCMOS implementation of the active analog <b>delay</b> stage and <b>delay</b> reference loop is presented that operates to 10 Gb/s.

Proper <b>delay</b> tuning is achieved with a <b>delay</b> reference loop (DRL). The DRL employs a reference frequency to stabilize the time <b>delay.</b> This reference frequency might come from an off-chip source or the locally regenerated clock {{in the case of an}} equalizer. As opposed to delay-locked loops that shift the <b>delay</b> to align an unknown signal, the DRL adjusts the <b>delay</b> to a given reference tone.

30|$|A {{review on}} CMOS <b>delay</b> lines {{with a focus}} on the most {{frequently}} used techniques for high-resolution <b>delay</b> step is presented. The primary types, specifications, <b>delay</b> circuits, and operating principles are presented. The <b>delay</b> circuits reported in this paper are used for <b>delaying</b> digital inputs and clock signals. The most common analog and digitally-controlled <b>delay</b> elements topologies are presented, focusing on the main delay-tuning strategies. IC variables, namely, process, supply voltage, temperature, and noise sources that affect <b>delay</b> resolution through timing jitter are discussed. The design specifications of these <b>delay</b> elements are also discussed and compared for the common <b>delay</b> line circuits. As a result, the main findings of this paper are highlighting and discussing the followings: the most efficient high-resolution <b>delay</b> line techniques, the trade-off challenge found between CMOS <b>delay</b> lines designed using either analog or digitally-controlled <b>delay</b> elements, the trade-off challenge between <b>delay</b> resolution and <b>delay</b> range and the proposed solutions for this challenge, and how CMOS technology scaling can affect the performance of CMOS <b>delay</b> lines. Moreover, the current trends and efforts used in order to generate output <b>delayed</b> signal with low jitter in the sub-picosecond range are presented.|$|R

30|$|For the <b>delay</b> {{between two}} network entities, it usually {{refers to the}} RTT (round trip time) from a source to a destination, which is {{composed}} of four types of <b>delay,</b> such as transmission <b>delay,</b> propagation <b>delay,</b> processing <b>delay,</b> and queuing <b>delay.</b> Transmission <b>delay</b> is {{the time needed to}} place a packet onto a link; propagation <b>delay</b> represents the time that is needed for a packet to reach from the source end of a link to the destination end; processing <b>delay</b> is the time needed for an intermediate router (on the path from the source to a destination) or a destination to do data extraction, error checking, and forwarding; and the queuing <b>delay</b> is the time that the packet is waiting for process on the intermediate router. Thus, it can be seen, for the above four types of <b>delay,</b> that only the propagation <b>delay</b> is related to distance. While the propagation <b>delay</b> cannot be directly measured and the RTT is easy to be measured, geolocation algorithm usually uses half of the smallest RTT between two network entities as the propagation <b>delay.</b> This is because small RTT usually means small processing <b>delay</b> and send <b>delay,</b> and propagation <b>delay</b> is a larger proportion of RTT.|$|R
