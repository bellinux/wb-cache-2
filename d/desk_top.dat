30|$|With ever {{increasing}} energy {{costs and the}} push to reduce energy consumption, there is constant pressure {{to reduce the amount}} of energy devoted to lighting. Energy savings can be achieved by simply turning down the amount of ambient lighting in the room, and supplementing light on work surfaces, such as table <b>tops</b> and <b>desk</b> <b>tops,</b> and in work spaces with task lighting. Because task lights do not need to generate the amount of light needed to illuminate an entire room, they consume less energy for the same task illumination level [1, 2]. From an energy efficiency point of view, only task lights would be used in a space, without ambient lighting. However, from a practical point of view, some ambient lighting is required for circulation and safety and to provide visibility to surrounding architectural structure and amenities in the space. For example, if the ambient lighting in a task lit space were reduced from 400 lu× to 100 lu×, the energy savings would be appreciable. As a result, task-ambient lighting becomes more prevalent in many lighting applications.|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} 1960s when these first <b>desk</b> <b>top</b> {{quotation}} units were developed {{the only real}} time information available from the various stock and commodity exchanges were the last sale and the bid and ask ticker lines. The last sale ticker contained every trade with both price and volume for each trade. The bid-ask ticker contained only the two prices and no size. The volume of data on the last sale ticker was therefore much greater than on the bid-ask ticker. Because of this, on high volume days the last sale ticker would run as much as fifteen minutes behind the bid-ask ticker. This time difference made having the bid-ask on their <b>desk</b> <b>top</b> unit extremely important to a stockbroker {{even though there was}} an extra charge to the exchange for this information.|$|E
