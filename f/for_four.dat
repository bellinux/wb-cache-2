40|$|Objective The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine cancer {{incidence}} in patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis (AASV) derived from population-based cohort studies by means of meta-analysis. Methods Relevant electronic databases were searched for studies characterizing the associated risk of overall malignancy in patients with AASV. Standardized incidence rates (SIRs) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were used to evaluate the strength of association. We tested for publication bias and heterogeneity and stratified for site-specific cancers. Results Six studies (n = 2, 578) were eventually identified, of which six provided the SIR for overall malignancy, five reported the SIR for non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), <b>four</b> <b>for</b> leukemia, five for bladder cancer, three for lymphoma, three <b>for</b> liver cancer, <b>four</b> <b>for</b> lung cancer, three <b>for</b> kidney cancer, <b>four</b> <b>for</b> prostate cancer, <b>four</b> <b>for</b> colon cancer and <b>four</b> <b>for</b> breast cancer.
