50|$|Most {{metering}} pumps have a pump {{head and a}} motor. The liquid being pumped goes through the pump head, entering through an <b>inlet</b> <b>line</b> and leaving through an outlet line. The motor is commonly an electric motor which drives the pump head.|$|E
50|$|In normal conditions, common {{centrifugal}} pumps {{are unable to}} evacuate the air from an <b>inlet</b> <b>line</b> leading to a fluid level whose geodetic altitude is below that of the pump. Self-priming pumps have {{to be capable of}} evacuating air (see Venting) from the pump suction line without any external auxiliary devices.|$|E
5000|$|Piston-driven {{metering}} pumps commonly work as follows: There is a piston (sometimes called plunger), typically cylindrical, which {{can go in}} and out of a correspondingly shaped chamber in the pump head. The inlet and outlet lines are joined to the piston chamber. There are two check valves, often ball check valves, attached to the pump head, one at the <b>inlet</b> <b>line</b> and the other at the outlet line. The inlet valve allows flow from the <b>inlet</b> <b>line</b> to the piston chamber, but not in the reverse direction. The outlet valve allows flow from the chamber to the outlet line, but not in reverse. The motor repeatedly moves the piston into and out of the piston chamber, causing the volume of the chamber to repeatedly become smaller and larger. When the piston moves out, a vacuum is created. Low pressure in the chamber causes liquid to enter and fill the chamber through the inlet check valve, but higher pressure at the outlet causes the outlet valve to shut. Then when the piston moves in, it pressurizes the liquid in the chamber. High pressure in the chamber causes the inlet valve to shut and forces the outlet valve to open, forcing liquid out at the outlet. These alternating suction and discharge strokes are repeated over and over to meter the liquid. In back of the chamber, there is packing around the piston or a doughnut-shaped seal with a toroid-shaped sphincter-like spring inside compressing the seal around the piston. This holds the fluid pressure when the piston slides in and out and makes the pump leak-tight. The packing or seals can wear out after prolonged use and can be replaced. The metering rate can be adjusted by varying the strokelength by which the piston moves back and forth or varying the speed of the piston motion.|$|E

5000|$|An {{air horn}} {{consists}} of a flaring metal or plastic horn or trumpet (called the [...] "bell") attached to a small air chamber containing a metal reed or diaphragm in the throat of the horn. Compressed air flows from an <b>inlet</b> <b>line</b> through a narrow opening past the reed or diaphragm, causing it to vibrate, which creates sound waves. The flaring horn serves as an acoustic [...] "transformer" [...] to improve the transfer of sound energy from the diaphragm to the open air, making the sound louder. In most horns it also determines the pitch of the sound. When vibrated by the diaphragm, the column of air in the horn vibrates in standing waves. The length of the horn determines the wavelength of the sound waves generated, and thus the fundamental frequency (pitch) of the note produced by the horn. The longer the horn, the lower the pitch.|$|E
50|$|Many valves are {{controlled}} manually with a handle {{attached to the}} stem. If the handle is turned ninety degrees between operating positions, the valve is called a quarter-turn valve. Butterfly, ball valves, and plug valves are often quarter-turn valves. If the handle is circular with the stem as the axis of rotation {{in the center of}} the circle, then the handle is called a handwheel. Valves can also be controlled by actuators attached to the stem. They can be electromechanical actuators such as an electric motor or solenoid, pneumatic actuators which {{are controlled}} by air pressure, or hydraulic actuators which are controlled by the pressure of a liquid such as oil or water. Actuators can be used for the purposes of automatic control such as in washing machine cycles, remote control such as the use of a centralised control room, or because manual control is too difficult such as when the valve is very large. Pneumatic actuators and hydraulic actuators need pressurised air or liquid lines to supply the actuator: an <b>inlet</b> <b>line</b> and an outlet line. Pilot valves are valves which are used to control other valves. Pilot valves in the actuator lines control the supply of air or liquid going to the actuators.|$|E
5000|$|Hydraulic {{pumps are}} used in {{hydraulic}} drive systems and can be hydrostatic or hydrodynamic.A hydraulic pump is a mechanical source of power that converts mechanical power into hydraulic energy (hydrostatic energy i.e. flow, pressure). It generates flow with enough power to overcome pressure induced by the load at the pump outlet. When a hydraulic pump operates, it creates a vacuum at the pump inlet, which forces liquid from the reservoir into the <b>inlet</b> <b>line</b> to the pump and by mechanical action delivers this liquid to the pump outlet and forces it into the hydraulic system.Hydrostatic pumps are positive displacement pumps while hydrodynamic pumps can be fixed displacement pumps, in which the displacement (flow through the pump per rotation of the pump) cannot be adjusted, or variable displacement pumps, which have a more complicated construction that allows the displacement to be adjusted. Although, hydrodynamic pumps are more frequent in day-to-day life. Hydrostatics pump which are of various types works {{on the principle of}} Pascal's law. It states that the increase in pressure at one point of the enclosed liquid in equilibrium of rest is transmitted equally to all other points of the liquid, unless the effect of gravity is neglected.(in case of statics) ...|$|E

It is calibrated for total pressures and water vapor (WV) vol- 5 ume mixing ratios (VMRs) possible during airborne applications. WV VMR is calculated by using pressure dependent calibration curves and a cubic spline interpolation method. Coverage {{of the entire}} atmospheric humidity concentration range which might be encountered during airborne measurements is facilitated by applying an automated sensitivity mode switching algorithm.

5000|$|Oil and gas TENORM and/or NORM {{is created}} in the {{production}} process, when produced fluids from reservoirs carry sulfates {{up to the surface}} of the Earth's crust. Some states, such as North Dakota, uses the term [...] "diffuse NORM". Barium, calcium and strontium sulfates are larger compounds, and the smaller atoms, such as radium 226 and radium 228, can fit into the empty spaces of the compound and be carried through the produced fluids. As the fluids approach the surface, changes in the temperature and pressure cause the barium, calcium, strontium and radium sulfates to precipitate out of solution and form scale on the inside, or on occasion, the outside of the tubulars and/or casing. The use of tubulars in the production process that are NORM contaminated does not cause a health hazard if the scale is inside the tubulars and the tubulars remain downhole. Enhanced concentrations of the radium 226 and 228 and the daughter products such as lead-210 may also occur in sludge that accumulates in oilfield pits, tanks and lagoons. Radon gas in the natural gas streams concentrate as NORM in gas processing activities. Radon decays to lead-210, then to bismuth-210, polonium-210 and stabilizes with lead-206.

40|$|As {{part of a}} field {{campaign}} {{in the framework of}} the Nitro Europe project, three different instruments for atmospheric ammonia (NH 3) measurements were operated side-by-side on a managed grassland site in Switzerland: a modified Proton Transfer Reaction Mass Spectrometer (PTR-MS), a GRadient of AErosol and Gases Online Registrator (GRAEGOR), and an Automated Ammonia Analyzer (AiRRmonia). The modified PTR-MS approach is based on chemical ionization of NH 3 using O- 2 (+) instead of H 3 O+ as ionizing agent, GRAEGOR and AiRRmonia measure NH 4 + in liquids after absorption of gaseous NH 3 in a rotating wet-annular denuder and through a gas permeable membrane, respectively. Bivariate regression slopes using uncorrected data from all three instruments ranged from 0. 78 to 0. 97 while measuring ambient NH 3 levels between 2 and 25 ppbv during a 5 days intercomparison period. Correlation coefficients r(2) were in the range of 0. 79 to 0. 94 for hourly average mixing ratios. Observed discrepancies could be partly attributed to temperature effects on the GRAEGOR calibration. Bivariate regression slopes using corrected data were > 0. 92 with offsets ranging from 0. 22 to 0. 58 ppbv. The intercomparison demonstrated the potential of PTR-MS to resolve short-time NH 3 fluctuations which could not be measured by the two other slow-response instruments.

40|$|An {{airborne}} vapor analyzer {{for detecting}} sub- to low- parts-per-million (ppm) hydrazine {{in the presence}} of higher concentration levels of ammonia has been under development for the Orion program. The detector is based on ambient pressure ionization and ion mobility characterization. The detector encompasses: 1) a membrane inlet to exclude particulate and aerosols from the analyzer inlet; 2) a method to separate hydrazine from ammonia which would otherwise lead to loss of calibration and quantitative accuracy for the hydrazine determination; and 3) response and quantitative determinations for both hydrazine and ammonia. Laboratory studies were made to explore some of these features including mobility measurements mindful of power, size, and weight issues. The study recommended the use of a mobility spectrometer of traditional design with a reagent gas and equipped with an <b>inlet</b> transfer <b>line</b> of bonded phase fused silica tube. The <b>inlet</b> transfer <b>line</b> provided gas phase separation of neutrals of ammonia from hydrazine at 50 C simplifying significantly the ionization chemistry that underlies response in a mobility spectrometer.

The measurements were {{made during the}} HyytiÃ¤lÃ¤ United Measurement of Photochemistry and Particles â€“ Comprehensive Organic Particle and Environmental Chemistry (HUMPPA-COPEC- 2010) measurement intensive. Mixing ratios of PAN and PAA were determined by measuring the acetate ion signal (CH 3 C(O) O âˆ’, m/z = 59) resulting from reaction of CH 3 C(O) O 2 (from the thermal dissociation of PAN) or CH 3 C(O) OOH with iodide ions using alternatively heated and ambient temperature <b>inlet</b> <b>lines.</b> During some periods of high temperature (~ 30 Â°C) and low NO x (< 1 ppbv), PAA mixing ratios were similar to, or exceeded those of PAN and thus contributed a significant {{fraction of the total}} acetate signal.

Within the range of mixing ratios of NO x measured during HUMPPA-COPEC, the modelled ratio of PAA-to-PAN was found to be sensitive to temperature (through the thermal decomposition rate of PAN) and the HO 2 mixing ratio, thus providing some constraint to estimates of photochemical activity and oxidation rates in the Boreal environment...|$|R

Deviation between estimated and observed values of flow rate was lower than 6 %, indicating a satisfactory accuracy. Distribution uniformity of the system was higher than 95 % under all pressures within the estimated range of values. Lateral lines can operate within a wide range of operating pressures and even so satisfactory results of distribution uniformity are obtained...|$|R
40|$|Urban {{areas are}} among the main causes of {{greenhouse}} gases emissions on the planet, despite covering relatively small areas of the land. Recently, a number of projects aim at monitoring the dynamics of city emissions using micro meteorological measurements by applying the technique of eddy correlation for measuring the fluxes of carbon dioxide, water, methane and energy. In this perspective, a super-site for the measurement of atmospheric pollutants from urban sources {{has been established in}} Naples (Campania, Southern Italy), where the complex layout of the coast and surrounding mountains favours the development of combined sea breeze upslope winds and the evolution of return ï¬‚ows with several layers of pollutants and subsidence. At the super-site, an eddy covariance tower has been installed on the rooftop of the Meteorological Observatory of Largo San Marcellino, situated in the historical city centre: a fast response ultrasonic anemometer (Gill WindMaster) has been mounted on a 10 -m mast, alongside three insulated <b>inlet</b> <b>lines</b> through which the air is sampled for gaseous pollutants and particulate matter. The height of the terrace is on average 35 m above the irregular street level, resulting in an overall measuring height of 45 m. Mixing ratios of CO 2, CH 4 and H 2 O are measured by an infrared spectrometer (10 Hz, Los Gatos Research). The results shown that the mean urban levels of CO 2 are between 420 - 520 ppm; the mean levels of CH 4 span between 1. 85 - 2. 48 ppm. These fluxes are representative of varying footprint source areas, covering the historical centre of Naples, the harbour, and some main traffic arteries of the city. The analysis of these measurements on long-term will allow to establish relationships between the fluxes of greenhouse gases and the other pollutant species measured...|$|R
