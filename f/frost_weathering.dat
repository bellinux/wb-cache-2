25|$|Daily extreme {{temperature}} variations create fractures by repeated expansion and contraction {{of the rock}} in a process called thermal stress weathering. The thermal stresses can cause deep cracks that split the rock into separate pieces in an erosional process called thermal exfoliation. Precipitation causes dissolution of the fine crystalline grains that bind the larger particles together, which is known as chemical weathering. Freezing water expands in fractures making them wider and deeper in a process called <b>frost</b> <b>weathering.</b> Gravity exerts a constant downward force that creates new fractures and separates the formations along existing fractures in a process called stress relief exfoliation. High speed winds remove any loose grains from the formations and wind-borne particulates sandblast the surfaces making them smoother.|$|E

25|$|Nevertheless, the Soviet {{territory}} contained all {{the major}} vegetation zones {{with the exception of}} tropical rain forest. Ten percent of Soviet territory is tundra, that is, a treeless marshy plain. The tundra was the Soviet Union's northernmost zone of snow and ice, stretching from the Finnish border in the west to the Bering Strait in the east and then running south along the Pacific coast to the earthquake and volcanic region of northern Kamchatka Peninsula. It was the land made famous by herds of wild reindeer, by white nights (dusk at midnight, dawn shortly thereafter) in summer, and by days of total darkness in winter. The long harsh winters and lack of sunshine allowed only mosses, lichens, and dwarf willows and shrubs to sprout low above the barren permafrost. Although the great Siberian rivers slowly traversed this zone in reaching the Arctic Ocean, drainage of the numerous lakes, ponds, and swamps was hampered by partial and intermittent thawing. <b>Frost</b> <b>weathering</b> is the most important physical process here, shaping a landscape modified by extensive glaciation in the last ice age.|$|E
25|$|About 57 {{percent of}} Russia is tundra—a treeless, marshy plain. The tundra is Russia's northernmost zone, {{stretching}} from the Finnish border {{in the west to}} the Bering Strait in the east, then running south along the Pacific coast to the northern Kamchatka Peninsula. The zone is known for its herds of wild reindeer, for so-called white nights (dusk at midnight, dawn shortly thereafter) in summer, and for days of total darkness in winter. The long, harsh winters and lack of sunshine allow only mosses, lichens, and dwarf willows and shrubs to sprout low above the barren permafrost. Although several powerful Siberian rivers traverse this zone as they flow northward to the Arctic Ocean, partial and intermittent thawing hamper drainage of the numerous lakes, ponds, and swamps of the tundra. <b>Frost</b> <b>weathering</b> is the most important physical process here, gradually shaping a landscape that was severely modified by glaciation in the last ice age. Less than one percent of Russia's population lives in this zone. The fishing and port industries of the northwestern Kola Peninsula and the huge oil and gas fields of northwestern Siberia are the largest employers in the tundra. With a population of 180,000, the industrial frontier city of Norilsk is second in population to Murmansk among Russia's settlements above the Arctic Circle.

40|$|One of {{the several}} {{challenges}} of cool climate viticulture with a short growing season is consistently reaching a uniform and optimal fruit technological maturity at harvest before the first autumn <b>frost.</b> <b>Weather</b> conditions in Michigan from veraison to harvest are widely variable and unpredictable between years, constraining the pre-harvest assessment of fruit quality for grape growers and wineries. In these environmental conditions, the commonly adopted viticultural techniques to enhance fruit ripening are cluster thinning and leaf removal. Cluster thinning consists of a selective elimination of clusters, therefore optimizing the source/sink ratio of the vine. Cluster zone leaf removal induces changes of fruit micro-environmental conditions, involving solar radiation, temperature and aeration. In this work, we evaluated the effects of cluster thinning and cluster zone leaf removal, applied separately or combined at veraison on Cabernet Franc for two consecutive years (2011 and 2012). The two seasons had very distinct weather patterns from veraison to harvest. Fruit maturity was enhanced at 15 – 20 days after veraison in both years {{in response to the}} viticultural techniques, but with completely different dynamics. At harvest, the combination of leaf removal and cluster thinning led to higher uniformity of fruit and better chemical composition in 2011, a year characterized by low heat accumulation after veraison.

40|$|AbstractAsphalt {{concrete}} is {{a traditional}} material used for the constructions of upstream sealing of reservoir dams, particularly in upper reservoirs of pumped storage hydroelectric plants. The asphalt layer is often exposed to significant fluctuations of temperature caused, for example, by heating the facing {{from the sun and}} by its subsequent rapid cooling by water during reservoir periodical filling. To better understand the physical phenomena and behaviour of the facing in terms of vapour diffusion, the state of stress, etc., it is necessary to know temperature phenomena in the asphalt facing. This paper describes the measurement of temperature in the asphalt facing of the Dlouhe Strane pumped storage hydroelectric plant and its evaluation using 1 D numerical model of heat flow in the asphalt concrete facing. Numerical simulation for selected load scenarios enabled the temperature phenomena that take place {{in the construction of the}} asphalt-concrete facing to be quantified. The analysis shows that during insolation, the asphalt facing is exposed to the significant temperature rise on its surface and also over its whole thickness. Similarly during <b>frost</b> <b>weather</b> the facing becomes frozen in its entire thickness. During the day cycle the temperature in the asphalt layers changes significantly. However, the temperature in the underlying rockfill dam body becomes steady approximately at the depth of 1. 0 m...|$|R
