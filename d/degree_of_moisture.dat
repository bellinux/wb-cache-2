Adhesive bonding of aluminium alloys is a widely used joining technology across many industrial sectors including aerospace, automotive, marine, defence and construction. One of the key attractions of adhesive bonding is the superior fatigue performance and joint stress distribution. The applications are not without limitations and adhesive joints often suffer from premature failure when put into service in harsh environments such as those containing high <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>moisture.</b> [Continues. ...|$|R

We examined soil preferences of the federally endangered Nicrophorus americanus, {{as well as of}} N. carolinus, N. marginatus, N. obscurus, and N. orbicollis, in a series of experiments. Differences in burial depth by sex were found for N. carolinus, N. marginatus, and N. obscurus, which are diurnal species. Both sexes of N. americanus bury to a mean depth of 18 cm.

We investigated moisture in the oral mucosa in patients undergoing HCT by the capacitance method using a convenient device, Moisture Checker for Mucus (R) (MCM; Life Co., Ltd., Saitama, Japan). Subjects and methods Thirty-six patients undergoing HCT at Okayama University Hospital of Medicine and Dentistry (Male= 22, Female= 14; age= 41. 6 +/- 16. 2 years old) were enrolled in this study. Moisture in the oral mucosa was measured by MCM in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The results were obtained as MCM values (%), which are the weight percentage of water content in the oral mucosal epithelium. As controls, <b>moisture</b> <b>of</b> the oral mucosa was also examined in healthy volunteers (Male= 27, Female= 35; age= 43. 0 +/- 14. 6 years old).

5000|$|The logs in log {{houses have}} a varying <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>{{moisture}}</b> content; all logs have moisture when freshly cut. In {{the case of}} handcrafted logs moisture will naturally leave the timber, drying it out until it stabilizes with its climate. This drying-out causes movement and shrinking of the log's diameter. As logs and timbers dry, the differential shrinkage (radial versus tangential) causes small cracks (known as [...] "checks") to open slowly over time. Checking is a natural process in both air- and kiln-dried logs. This occurs in all log houses regardless of construction method or how the timber is allowed to dry, and is considered normal.|$|E

For instance in southern Scandinavia and Northern Germany this species has during the 20th century become the most common of all gulls, and the increase has mostly occurred in urban or semi-urban environments. The great black-backed gull (Larus marinus) was around 1900 as common as the herring gull in the mentioned parts, but has not increased at all so much (if at all). There are though some signs of that the bigger gull has learned (adopted) some of the herring gull's behaviour within urban environments. Where the herring gull is breeding in coastal urban environment, the great black-backed gull seems to do the same, but in a far minor scale.|$|E

However, bacteria in these environments are rapidly acquiring antibiotic and heavy metal resistance, which {{is thought to be}} a co-selection process (Baker-Austin, 2006). Copper-resistant strains of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecium isolated from pigs fed copper sulfate were examined (Hasman, 2002). Survival of strains was tested by timed incubation on onesquare- inch copper alloys with varying <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>moisture</b> during inoculation <b>of</b> the surfaces.

Dry or wet inoculations had no effect on the survival rates on stainless steel, since strains survived equally and no die-off was seen.

40|$|The {{geological}} {{characterization of}} shallow subsurface Neogene deposits in northeastern Pará State using Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) revealed normal and reverse faults, {{as well as}} folds, not yet well documented by field studies. The faults are identified mostly by steeply-dipping reflections that sharply cut the nearby reflections causing bed offsets, drags and rollovers. The folds are recognized by reflections that are highly undulating, configuring broad concave and convex-up features that are up to 50 m wide and 80 to 90 ns deep. These deformation structures are mostly developed within deposits of Miocene age, {{though some of the}} faults might continue into younger deposits as well. Although the studied GPR sections show several diffractions caused by trees, differential <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>moisture,</b> and underground artifacts, the structures recorded here can not be explained by any of these “noises”. The detailed analysis of the GPR sections reveals that they are attributed to bed distortion caused by brittle deformation and folding.
