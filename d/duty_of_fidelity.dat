She {{would go to the}} root of this matter, if she had intelligence enough. Crippled, ruined in health, wrecked and broken by an inexplicable war, soul-blighted by the heartless, callous neglect of government and public, on the verge of madness at the insupportable facts, he had yet been wonderful enough, true enough to himself and God, to fight for life with the instinct of a man, to fight for his mind with a noble and unquenchable faith. Alone indeed he had been alone! And by some miracle beyond the power of understanding he had found day by day in his painful efforts some hope and strength to go on. He could not have had any illusions. For Glenn Kilbourne the health and happiness and success most men held so dear must have seemed impossible. His slow, daily, tragic, and terrible task must have been something he owed himself. Not for Carley Burch! She like all the others had failed him. How Carley shuddered in confession of that! Not for the country which had used him and cast him off! Carley divined now, as if by a flash of lightning, the meaning of Glenn's strange, cold, scornful, and aloof manner when he had encountered young men of his station, as capable and as strong as he, who had escaped the service of the army. For him these men did not exist. They were less than nothing. They had waxed fat on lucrative jobs; they had basked in the presence of girls whose brothers and lovers were in the trenches or on the turbulent sea, exposed to the ceaseless dread and almost ceaseless toil of war. If Glenn's spirit had lifted him to endurance of war for the sake of others, how then could it fail him in a precious <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> <b>fidelity</b> to himself? Carley could see him day by day toiling in his lonely canyon--plodding to his lonely cabin. He had been playing the game--fighting it out alone as surely he knew his brothers of like misfortune were fighting.|$|E

40|$|Publisher: Emerald Group Publishing Limited Abstract: Purpose – Fitting ethical {{responsibilities}} into {{day-to-day business}} practice represents {{a challenge for}} marketers who have to operate at the customer interface. When young children are the target market the puzzle becomes more complex. Based on {{a case study of}} the toy industry, this paper examines the moral issues of “care” and “vulnerability” and evaluates toy company practice. Design/methodology/approach – The paper builds upon Ross' proposed prima facie <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> benevolence, <b>fidelity,</b> and nonmaleficence (1938), which it argued are particularly relevant when vulnerable consumers are involved. The supporting fieldwork is based on qualitative interviews with senior managers in 12 leading UK-based toy companies and compares the findings with other documentary evidence. Findings – Evidence of some ethical responsible practice was discovered although this appeared to be primarily driven by external forces rather than company philanthropy. Although the companies argued that targeting children directly is supported by their human rights, this practice will always attract criticism on moral grounds because of children's widely accepted vulnerability. The study identifies a paradox that it is parents who fund most toy purchases but are often overlooked in the marketing process who are vulnerable as well as their children. Originality/value – This paper adds to the limited literature on ethical issues in marketing to children and provides empirical evidence from an important children's market. The paper seeks to provide a balanced account of where the toy companies are adopting a responsible approach and where they still need to improve their moral credentials...|$|R
40|$|A Rossian Just War Theory revises {{and extends}} the {{projects}} begun by Childress and O‘Connor, {{who argued that}} just war theory ought {{to be based on}} Rossian prima facie duties. The project also leans heavily on the work of Michael Walzer and Jeff McMahan. This project will initiate a fourth segment, jus ante bellum, or justice before the war. ^ As an ethics of warfare based in prima facie duties, the first question is what is necessary to justify overriding the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> non-injury? The central idea is that the group of just war principles, together, must be satisfied in order to override the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> non-injury. Articulating these principles in terms <b>of</b> prima facie <b>duties</b> is covered in the first chapter. Two subsequent chapters address {{the question of how to}} ground jus ante bellum and jus post bellum in a prima facie duties framework? Jus ante bellum responsibilities are grounded in a duty to protect human rights and can be instances <b>of</b> overriding the <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> non-injury and <b>fidelity.</b> Chapter two introduces a picture of the prima facie <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> the state in order to explicate jus ante bellum duties and fulfill prima facie duties. Chapter three develops the idea of the prima facie <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> the state in order to formulate a set of jus post bellum principles for an ethical set of restrictions on post-conflict reconstruction. ^ The final two chapters focus on challenges facing a prima facie just war theory. Chapter four concerns the question is how to handle individual judgments when the soldier has an obligation to fight and thus to override their prima facie <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> non-injury, but in their analysis the conditions of a just war have not obtained, and thus there is no moral justification for overriding non-injury. Chapter five covers the problem of supreme emergencies, tackling the question of whether it can be permissible to override non-combatant immunity in order to prevent horrific consequences. ...|$|R

50|$|Ross gives a list {{of seven}} prima facie duties, which he does not claim is all-inclusive: fidelity; reparation; gratitude; non-maleficence; justice; beneficence; and self-improvement. In any given situation, any number of these prima facie duties may apply. In the case of ethical dilemmas, they may even {{contradict}} one another. Someone could have a prima facie duty of reparation, say, a duty {{to help people who}} helped you move house, move house themselves, and a prima facie <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> <b>fidelity,</b> such as taking your children on a promised trip to the park, and these could conflict. Nonetheless, there can never be a true ethical dilemma, Ross would argue, because one of the prima facie duties in a given situation is always the weightiest, and over-rules all the others. This is thus the absolute obligation or absolute duty, the action that the person ought to perform.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{whether and}} how reforms in corporate governance structures and practices in the United States may reshape conventional notions <b>of</b> the fiduciary <b>duties</b> owed by independent directors of public companies. The paper identifies two focal points {{for the evolution of}} directors 2 ̆ 7 fiduciary duties. First, various reforms in corporate governance assign more specific responsibilities to directors, arguably reorienting directors 2 ̆ 7 loyalty to due discharge of a specified function along with ongoing or residual <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> loyalty owed in more general terms to the corporation and its shareholders. The relationships among these specific duties and more general ones may be complex, as may be the consequences of increased emphasis on work to be done by directors as members of committees in contrast to the board as a whole. Second, reforms in corporate governance imply that a director 2 ̆ 7 s <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> loyalty to the corporation and its shareholders requires more than disinterest, narrowly defined. That is, a director 2 ̆ 7 s <b>duty</b> is one <b>of</b> <b>fidelity</b> to the interests of the corporation that imposes more than an obligation to refrain from participating in board decisions in which the director has a material financial interest. The paper prefaces discussion of evolution of directors 2 ̆ 7 duties by addressing two more fundamental questions about contemporary corporate governance: what role precisely should be assigned to directors, distinct from a corporation 2 ̆ 7 s officers and its other senior executives? And what implications follow for the powers of shareholders? To the extent that directors can reasonably be expected to serve only a relatively formal or vestigial function, an expansion in shareholders 2 ̆ 7 powers may be warranted. Overall, the paper is a study of interrelationships among legal and nonlegal mechanisms that shape expectations for directors 2 ̆ 7 conduct. Although distinct, none operates in a vacuum. Formal structures, definitions, and requirements may shape how directors discharge their responsibilities by focusing directors 2 ̆ 7 attention on their gravity and, by enabling independent directors to function more collegially, facilitating the development of institutions of corporate governance that function independently of senior management. Articulating the content of directors 2 ̆ 7 responsibilities with greater specificity heightens expectations that these responsibilities will be fulfilled. In turn, higher expectations for directors 2 ̆ 7 conduct may serve to legitimate directors 2 ̆ 7 capacity, once elected, to exercise discretion independent of intervention from shareholders...|$|R

40|$|In Japan, the Company Law（平成 17 年法律第 86 号）which {{took effect}} in May 2006 {{integrated}} several scattered laws, which thus far regulated companies, {{into a single}} Company Code of Law. Under the present Company Law, {{the relation between the}} company and the director is to be observed under the rules of commission (Article 330). Therefore, the director is responsible for observing the duty of good management as a contractor of the Civil Law Article 644. Liability arises when the director is deemed to have neglected the duty of good management. Besides, the duty of good management, and in particular, Article 355 of the Company Law, specifies that “the directors are responsible for observing the laws and ordinances as well as company statues and the decisions of the shareholders’ general meetings, and for loyally discharging their duties for a stock company. ” In minority theories the duty prescribed in this article is different from the duty of good management, and is regarded as the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> <b>fidelity</b> which requires that “the director should not attempt to gain any personal or third party profits by sacrificing the company or by abusing their position. In majority theories this duty is interpreted as something included within the duty of care and good management, and not as something which establishes any special duty of care and good management or any other duty. This paper reviews the responsibility of the company director, focussing on the directors’ discretionary power in management and their responsibility for neglect of duty. In particular, it will explore the responsibility which the directors bear towards the company and its systematic origin, arranging them in a definite order. Based on these premises, it will, furthermore, examine the characteristics of trends in the criteria for directors’ liability, espoused by recent theories which consider it not as a breach of the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> <b>fidelity</b> in article 355 of the Company Law, but as relating to the duty of care and good management in article 644 of the Civil Law. 研究ノー...|$|E

40|$|What {{makes an}} ethical {{question}} “hard”? Monroe Freedman’s “Professional Responsibility of the Criminal Defense Lawyer: The Three Hardest Questions” assessed hard questions about discrediting truthful witnesses, presenting perjured testimony and providing advice that may prompt {{the client to}} lie. It also, however, created a framework for analyzing ethical problems, for knowing when a question is hard, and both {{what has to be}} done to answer a hard question and to defend the answer. This paper articulates that framework. It argues that hard questions arise from unresolvable conflicts either between the lawyer’s professional and personal moral obligations, or between different aspects of the lawyer’s professional duties – the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> <b>fidelity</b> to law and the duty to be a loyal and zealous advocate for a client. The question requires the lawyer to make a choice in which a moral obligation will have to be sacrificed for another one to be fulfilled. While Freedman answers the hard questions he identifies, his point is ultimately that a lawyer must make a conscientious choice as to how to respond to a hard question in the specific circumstances in which the question arises, and be prepared to defend that choice. The paper further develops this analysis by applying the framework to argue that one of the hardest questions for criminal defence lawyers is whether or not to advise a client to accept a plea, where the client ought to have a reasonable chance of acquittal if receiving a fair trial on the merits, but the plea is clearly in the client’s best interests given the potential sentence and the improbability of receiving a fair trial...|$|E
40|$|The legal {{philosophy}} of Lon Fuller, both in {{his idea of}} internal morality and in his theory of legal interpretation, is particularly useful {{for the purpose of}} making sense of the relationship between law and morality vis-à-vis the legal profession. Legal ethicists have recently developed accounts of legal ethics that are based on jurisprudential theories. These include the exclusive positivist theory of Tim Dare, the inclusive positivist approach of Bradley Wendel, and the substantive contextual judgment view of William Simon. Additionally, David Luban has proposed and evaluated an insightful interpretation of Fuller’s {{legal philosophy}}. In this paper, I will argue that the legal philosophy of Lon Fuller provides the best jurisprudential foundation for philosophical legal ethics and the norms of legal ethics. This includes the treatment of topics such as the relationship between law and morality and the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> <b>fidelity</b> to law. In addition to arguing these points at a purely conceptual level I make the case that a Fullerian theory of lawyering is indispensable for making sense of a major recent case study in the field of legal ethics, the “torture memos” written for the Bush Administration by the US Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel (the “OLC”). Using a Fullerian approach to legal ethics, I will argue that the inappropriateness of these memos goes beyond the failure of the OLC lawyers to interpret particular laws in good faith. Rather, taking a view of law and lawyering inspired by Fuller’s legal theory, I will argue that, of all of the reasons that one might criticize the OLC lawyers, it is of deepest importance to understand {{the ways in which the}} OLC lawyers acted contrary to the ideal of legality in drafting these memos. I hope to provide insight into the philosophical foundations of legal ethics, as well as a major recent case study for legal ethics and to highlight the connection between lawyering and the vindication of the ideal of legality...|$|E
