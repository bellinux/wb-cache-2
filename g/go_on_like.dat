25|$|The {{situation}} on the Narva front was turning into a catastrophe for the German Army Group North. The Leningrad Front had formed bridgeheads both {{north and south of}} Narva, the closest of them a few hundred meters away from Narva–Tallinn Highway. The Sponheimer Group was in direct danger of getting besieged. The defence of the highway was held only by small infantry units formed of the 9th and 10th Luftwaffe Field Divisions, supported by Panther tanks after every few hundred metres along the highway. They obscured direct observation of the highway by placing branches of spruce trees along it, however, this did not distract the Soviet artillery from keeping the highway under constant bombardment. The faith of the Sponheimer Group, that the defence could <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>like</b> this, started to diminish.|$|E
500|$|A major {{rift between}} Johnson and Millererstwhile rivals for the Australian captaincydeveloped during the Fourth Test, played at Kensington Oval in Barbados. During the third day, Miller, bowling fast-medium swingers, had {{dismissed}} Everton Weekes and Collie Smith {{in quick succession}} to leave the West Indies at 6/147 with Denis Atkinson and Clairmonte Depeiaza batting. Johnson, thinking that the two batsmen would be vulnerable to express pace, asked Miller to increase his bowling speed. [...] When Miller refused, Johnson remonstrated with him: [...] "I'll say who bowls and what they bowl". With Miller refusing to bowl as directed, Johnson replaced him in the attack with Ray Lindwall. [...] Walking off the field {{at the end of}} the day's play and continuing in the dressing room, Miller provoked Johnson, telling him he [...] "couldn't captain a team of schoolboys", among other insults. Finally Johnson responded, asking [...] "If you want to <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>like</b> that why don't we go around the back and thrash it out?" [...] The much larger Miller declined the offer and the pair travelled back to the team hotel together. [...] The next day, Atkinson and Depeiaza batted throughout the entire day's play. [...] Their partnership of 347runs for the seventh wicket is still a world record.|$|E

2500|$|Kinney {{mentioned}} in a February 2006 {{interview that he}} would be interested in writing new material, but not as Alice in Chains. He explained, [...] "If we found some other dude, I'd love to move on, write some cool tunes and change the name and <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>like</b> that. I don't see continuing as Alice and replacing somebody. ... We're not trying to replace Layne. We want to play these songs one more time, and if it seems like the right thing to do, it'll happen. I don't know how long it will go or where it will take us. It's kind of a tribute to Layne and our fans, the people who love these songs. It's not some 'I'm broke and I need the money' situation. We love playing together." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{receiving}} his Fine Arts degree, Klee went to Italy from October 1901 to May 1902 with friend Hermann Haller. They {{stayed in}} Rome, Florence, and Naples, {{and studied the}} master painters of past centuries. He exclaimed, [...] "The Forum and the Vatican have spoken to me. [...] Humanism wants to suffocate me." [...] He responded to the colors of Italy, but sadly noted, [...] "that a long struggle lies in store for me in this field of color." [...] For Klee, color represented the optimism and nobility in art, and a hope for relief from the pessimistic nature he expressed in his black-and-white grotesques and satires. Returning to Bern, {{he lived with his}} parents for several years, and took occasional art classes. By 1905, he was developing some experimental techniques, including drawing with a needle on a blackened pane of glass, resulting in fifty-seven works including his Portrait of My Father (1906). In the years 1903-5 he also completed a cycle of eleven zinc-plate etchings called Inventions, his first exhibited works, in which he illustrated several grotesque characters. He commented, [...] "though I'm fairly satisfied with my etchings I can't <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>like</b> this. [...] I’m not a specialist." [...] Klee was still dividing his time with music, playing the violin in an orchestra and writing concert and theater reviews.|$|E
