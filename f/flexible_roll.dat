40|$|To reduce {{weight and}} improve {{passenger}} safety {{there is an}} increased need in the automotive industry to use Ultra High Strength Steel (UHSS) for structural and crash components. However, the application of UHSS is restricted by their limited formability {{and the difficulty of}} forming them in conventional stamping. An alternative method of manufacturing structural auto body parts from UHSS is the <b>flexible</b> <b>roll</b> forming process, which allows the manufacture of metal sheet with high strength and limited ductility into complex and weight-optimized components. One major problem in the <b>flexible</b> <b>roll</b> forming of UHSS is the web-warping defect, which is the deviation in height of the web area over the length of the profile.

40|$|Conventional {{roll forming}} {{is limited to}} {{components}} with uniform cross-section; the recently developed <b>flexible</b> <b>roll</b> forming (FRF) process {{can be used to}} form components which vary in both width and depth. It has been suggested that this process can be used to manufacture automotive components from Ultra High Strength Steel (UHSS) which has limited tensile elongation and is unsuitable for stamping. In the <b>flexible</b> <b>roll</b> forming process, the pre-cut blank is fed through a set of rolls; some rolls are computer-numerically controlled (CNC) to follow the 3 D contours of the part and hence parts with a variable cross-section can be produced. As with conventional roll forming, the number of forming stations is kept to a minimum, particularly the controlled roll stations, in order to limit tooling costs.

40|$|AbstractFlexible {{roll forming}} is an {{advanced}} {{sheet metal forming}} process for producing variable cross section profiles. Flange wrinkling at the transition zone where the cross section changes is a major defect in the <b>flexible</b> <b>roll</b> forming process.

The {{results showed that the}} strip deformation at the transition zone can be considered as a combination of two strip deformations observed in the conventional roll forming process and the flanging process. According to finite element analysis results, when the flange wrinkling occurs, compressive longitudinal strain is smaller than the necessary compressive longitudinal strain calculated by mathematical modeling to obtain the intended profile geometry in the compression zone. Therefore, comparison of compressive longitudinal strain obtained from the finite element analysis and the necessary compressive longitudinal strain is a good criterion to predict the flange wrinkling occurrence.

Ultra-high-strength (UHS) steels {{are very}} {{interesting}} materials for many applications where high strength can be utilized to create lighter {{and more effective}} constructions. The poor formability of UHS steels, however, may limit the usefulness of these materials in many applications. In this work, some experiments using a <b>flexible</b> <b>roll</b> forming machine developed at the Chair of Manufacturing Technology (LFT), University of Erlangen-Nuremberg were carried out using 4 mm-thick bainitic martensitic UHS steels (YS/TS 960 / 1000 and 1100 / 1250) and the outcomes have been analysed. Results of these experimental tests show that using roll forming {{it is possible to}} bend test materials to an angle of 90 º without damages with an evidently smaller radius than in air bending. The radius obtained using roll forming can be as small as 40 % of the value used in air bending. Tests also show that with the method used in these tests it is possible to make roll forming for the whole length of the plate.

The differences in edge loadings were not so marked. During locomotion over soft ground, the ungulate hoof acts like a chisel, and as the toes splay out, the hoof edge shears the substratum.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to give a {{preliminary}} investigation into the effect of wing deformation on flight dynamics. The candidate vehicle is FW- 11 which is a flying wing configuration aircraft with high altitude and long endurance characteristics. The aeroelastic effect may be significant {{for this type of}} configuration. Two cases, the effect of flexible wing on lift distribution and on roll effectiveness during the cruise condition with different inertial parameters are investigated. For the first case, as the wing bending and twisting depend on the interaction between the wing structural deflections and the aerodynamic loads, the equilibrium condition should be calculated. In order to get that condition, mass, structure characteristics and aerodynamic characteristics are estimated first. Then load model and aerodynamic model are built. Next the interaction calculation program is applied and the equilibrium condition of the aircraft is calculated. After that, effect of wing flexibility on lift parameters is investigated. The influence of CG, location of lift and location of flexural axis are investigated. The other case is to calculate the transient roll rate response and estimate the rolling effectiveness of flexible aircraft, and compared with the rigid aircraft’s. A pure roll model is built and derivatives both for the rigid wing and the flexible wing are estimated. It has been found that flexible wing leads to the loss of control effectiveness, even cause reversal when reduces the structure natural frequency.

40|$|Chain-die forming {{is a new}} {{sheet metal}} forming {{technology}} proposed which has the capability to fabricate advanced high-strength steel (AHSS) variable cross-section profiles. The existing research reveals that the control of longitudinal plastic strain and web-warping are two significant issues which determine {{the success of the}} fabrication of AHSS variable cross-section profiles. In this paper, both analytical and numerical methods are employed to analyse the longitudinal plastic strain and web-warping in Chain-die-formed AHSS sections with variable widths. By contrast to the existing analytical modelling in regards to <b>flexible</b> <b>roll</b> forming of irregular profiles, in this study, as Chain-die forming can be considered a continuous stamping process, the analytical models are purely established on the basis of geometric relationships between the pre-cut sheet and forming tools. In theory, no longitudinal plastic strain, id est maximum web-warping, could occur. No web-warping, id est maximum longitudinal plastic strain, could also arise. The real situation is included between such two extremes, and they are strongly dependent on some critical geometric parameters of the pre-cut sheet and forming tools. This is seen to be consistent with the simulation and experimental results. Subsequently, due to different forming mechanisms and loading processes, the severity and characteristics of the longitudinal plastic strain and web-warping of chain-die-formed AHSS sections with variable widths show distinct differences compared with those of flexible-rolled-formed profiles. Finally, Chain-die forming has been further proved to maximally reserve the material’s elongation as the redundant deformation is almost avoided during the forming process. This study provides an effective mathematical expression to analyse and predict longitudinal plastic strain and web-warping of chain-die-formed AHSS variable cross-section profiles. It is expected to be useful to tooling designers to quickly assess the severity of a Chain-die forming process in the tooling design stage in order to shorten the tooling development time...|$|E
40|$|This work {{combines}} two {{efforts that}} have been on-going in the Air Force Research Laboratory. The first effort {{is the work of}} the Design Modeling Group which is using the Adaptive Modeling Language (AML) to develop an objectbased technology assessment system. One of the advantages of this effort is that the analytical tools (legacy codes) that are used may be integrated into the AML environment one at a time, thereby providing many intermediate products each of which may enhance productivity. So while this effort is still in its infancy, a graphical user interface to the Automated STRuctural Optimization System (ASTROS) has been developed and is used in this effort to develop a parametrically defined finite element model. The second effort is the work on designing flexible wings without ailerons for performing roll maneuvers. Here a flexible wing is optimized for weight with constraints on strength for a 9 -g symmetric pull-up maneuver at M= 0. 85 at 30 psi and on the modal frequency distribution. Differential wing twist and camber is achieved by providing a system of actuating elements distributed within the internal substructure of the wing to provide roll control power. The modal approach was used to develop equilibrium equations for the steady roll maneuver of a wing subjected to aerodynamic loads and actuating forces. The distribution of actuating forces to achieve a specified <b>flexible</b> <b>roll</b> rate was determined by using an optimal control design approach. Here, full-scale wings are considered for the assessment of strain energy as a measure of the necessary power required to produce the antisymmetric twist and camber deformation to achieve the required roll performance. The wings used here break the paradigm of the low aspect ratio wings typical for supersonic vehicles. The purpose of this is to enhance the flexibility of the wing and to reduce the control power needed to twist the wing. 2...|$|E
