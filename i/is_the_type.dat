C. dughiis eggshell exhibits an angusticanaliculate pore system, i.e. its pores are long, narrow, and straight.|$|E
5|$|Clathrus ruber <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> {{species of}} the genus Clathrus, and {{is part of the}} group of Clathrus species known as the Laternoid series.

According to a molecular analysis published in 2006, out of the about 40 Phallales species used in the study, C.ruber is most closely related to Aseroe rubra, Clathrus archeri, Laternea triscapa, and Clathrus chrysomycelinus.|$|E

Tylopilus felleus has been the subject of research into bioactive compounds that have been tested for antitumour and antibiotic properties. Although not poisonous, it is generally considered inedible, due to its overwhelming bitterness.In Vietnam it's considered as a delicacy.This species often found in Phu Quoc island.|$|E

Prior to that direction, confusion arose because the species had been referred to by several different names, including Astacus marinus Fabricius, 1775 and Homarus vulgaris H.Milne-Edwards, 1837, and also because Friedrich Weber's description of the genus had been overlooked until rediscovered by Mary Rathbun, rendering any prior assignments of type species (for Homarus H.Milne-Edwards, 1837) invalid for Homarus Weber, 1795.|$|E
5|$|In 1823, Anning {{discovered}} a second, much more complete plesiosaur skeleton, specimen BMNH 22656.

Conybeare's presentation was made at the same meeting at which William Buckland described the dinosaur Megalosaurus and the combination created a sensation in scientific circles. The second fossil was named and described as Plesiosaurus dolichodeirus and <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> specimen (holotype) of this species, which itself <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> species of the genus.|$|E
