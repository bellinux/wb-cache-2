Commenting on the relationship with the board, it said: “Governors do not appear to have been advised on a timely basis, that falling student numbers have not simply caused by adverse demographic trends, but are also the result of loss of market share.” Concern was also expressed about slow reaction to the many problems faced by the college. “There is criticism from the corporation and staff that ‘bad news’ is not reported to the corporation with sufficient speed or candour, thus slowing down the ability to take the rigorous actions required to ensure sustainable financial recovery,” the report said. It also raised concern about staff costs. “Despite a number of years of staff cuts, on the SFA’s definition, the college’s staff costs are high, at around 78 per cent of income for 2015/16 and a forecast 72 per cent for 2016/17 (as a comparator, the area review benchmark is 60 to 65 per cent),” the report said. “This level of cost is unaffordable.” ...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} the accounting classification of convertible debt {{in an environment}} where there is the choice of debt, other capital funds or equity. Contracting theory suggests possible determinants of accounting choice. These are leverage, as a proxy for closeness to debt covenants, the relative size of the convertible financial instrument issued and the contractual terms of the instrument. Two measures of leverage are used. One is debt to earnings before interest, tax, <b>depreciation</b> <b>and</b> <b>amortisation</b> (EBITDA). This variable has been included as it is the most commonly used ratio in debt covenants. The second measure is debt to net tangible assets as this ratio, or similar ratios, have been used in previous accounting studies to proxy for closeness to debt covenants. As leverage ratios tend to vary between industries I identify whether each firm is above or below their industry average. I find that the best predictor of the accounting classification choice is the contractual terms of the instrument. The two debt covenants derived hypotheses are not supported. The leverage of the issuer and the relative size of the issue have no significant influence on the choice of classification...|$|E
40|$|South Africa’s labour {{policies}} and the growing societal calls to better explain executive remuneration create {{a unique opportunity to}} examine the effects of race on CEO pay. This empirical research study sought to investigate the effects of race on the sensitivity of executive pay to corporate performance. The study aims to contribute to the literature by providing an evidence-based approach to understanding the effect of race on CEO remuneration. The research design was quantitative, descriptive and longitudinal in nature, utilising validated secondary data sources. The sample consisted of 19 black CEOs and a random sample of 45 white CEOs. All components of South African CEO remuneration studied were found to correlate strongly with PAT (Profit after Tax) and EBITDA (Earnings before Interest, Taxes, <b>Depreciation</b> <b>and</b> <b>Amortisation)</b> and to a lesser degree with ROE (Return on Equity) and HEPS (Headline Earnings per Share). Black and white CEO mean remuneration was found to show no significant difference as a result of race. A notable difference found was the higher degree of payperformance sensitivity and variability seen within the black CEO sample. The study showed that race does not affect the level of CEO remuneration but does impact on pay-performance sensitivity and variability. [URL] Institute of Business Science (GIBS...|$|E
40|$|Financial market {{anomalies}} are constant {{subjects of}} debate {{because of their}} devotion form the foundational financial theories. Fama and French (2008) referred to the momentum effect as the premier anomaly. Thus, this study sought to apply the concept of momentum to examine three investment strategies. The first strategy was price momentum, an existing investment strategy but which {{was used as a}} comparison to the returns of the second and third strategies. The second strategy applied momentum to return on equity, operating cash flow and earnings before interest, tax, <b>depreciation</b> <b>and</b> <b>amortisation,</b> whilst the third strategy combined stocks with momentum in both stock price and respective fundamental variable. Using a non-probability sampling method, a total of 109 stock listed on the JSE over the period 1999 - 2010 were tested. Momentum in stock price and respective fundamentals was used to rank stocks into quintiles. The viability of each investment strategy was measured by comparing its average and risk adjusted returns to the market. The results revealed that fundamental momentum can beat market returns, with the highest amount of significant differences found using momentum in return on equity. The combination strategy also reported results of beating the market, with the higest amount of significant differences found using the 12 month fundamental momentum combined with 6 month price momentum.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} nature and extent of {{compliance}} to the principle-based corporate governance initiatives by the listed companies in the South Pacific Stock Exchange (SPSE) in Fiji. Three important questions are addressed: (i) whether listed companies in Fiji have complied with the principle-based governance practices: (ii) did compliance with principle based recommendations lead to an improvement in the listed company‟s financial performance? and (iii) how the institutional factors have contributed towards corporate governance practices in Fiji? Panel data for the SPSE companies over the period 2008 - 2010 are analysed using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. Tobin‟s Q, Return on Assets (ROA), Return on Equity (ROE) and Earnings Before Interest, Tax, <b>Depreciation</b> <b>and</b> <b>Amortisation</b> to Total Revenue (EBITDA 2 REV) metrics are used as dependent variables. Findings indicate that listed companies have adopted the Capital Market Development Authority‟s (CMDA) recommendations, establishing subcommittees for audit and remuneration, and having nonexecutive/ independent directors on the board. The result supports the view that the CMDA recommendations of board sub-committees (Audit and Remuneration) have had positive influence on company performance measured by Tobin‟s Q. The findings of this study give support to the principle-based corporate governance practices adopted in Fiji. The results of this study provide useful insights to both regulators and policy analysts (in Fiji and internationally) seeking to enhance both governance and firm performance in their own jurisdiction...|$|E
40|$|The role of {{boards in}} {{strategic}} goal setting and, in particular, {{the level of}} board involvement in strategic goal setting has not been extensively researched, {{primarily because of the}} difficulty of gaining access to empirical data. Therefore, boards of directors of companies listed on the Alternative Exchange (AltX) of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) were targeted for this research by means of a survey questionnaire administered via email. The aim of the research was firstly to understand the level of board involvement in strategic goal setting, secondly to establish the common strategic goals set by AltX companies and how often these goals are reviewed, thirdly to determine whether there is a relationship between independent variables such as organisational size, board size and number of non-executive directors and the level of board involvement, and finally to determine whether the level of board involvement varies between executive and non-executive directors. The research found that the level of board involvement was at mid-level being ‘sometimes involved’ while the board’s involvement is significantly lower in strategic goal formation processes. The most common goal was found to be EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, <b>depreciation</b> <b>and</b> <b>amortisation)</b> with Cost being the strategic goal most frequently reviewed. No statistically significant correlation was established between the independent variables and the level of board involvement in strategic goal setting. Finally, non-executive directors prefer to take on more of an ‘agency’ role by not becoming involved in ‘prescribing’ strategy. Dissertation (MBA) [...] University of Pretoria, 2010.

40|$|Background: Optimal {{contracting}} {{continues to}} dominate boardroom and dinner discussions worldwide {{in light of}} the 2008 global financial crisis and especially in South Africa, due to the growing income gap. Increased scrutiny is being placed on South African state-owned entities (SOEs), {{as a result of the}} seemingly poor performance of SOEs. Some of the SOEs are reported to have received financial bailouts from taxpayers’ money, while executives are raking in millions of rands in remuneration, provoking some concerns on the alignment of executive pay to company performance in SOEs. Aim: The study will assist remuneration committees and policymakers in the structuring of executive pay in SOEs to ensure alignment to company performance. Setting: The study sought to assess, based on empirical evidence, if there is a positive relationship between Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) remuneration and company performance in South African SOEs in the period between 2010 and 2014. All 21 Schedule 2 SOEs were included in the study. Methods: The research was a quantitative archival research methodology. Correlation and multiple regression analysis were the main statistical techniques used in this study. Results: Contrary to popular media, a positive relationship between CEO and CFO remuneration (fixed pay and short-term incentives) and company performance in SOEs was observed. Company size appears to be the key determiner of fixed pay in SOEs. The positive relationship was mainly noted on absolute profitability measurements like EBITDA (earnings before interest and tax and <b>depreciation</b> <b>and</b> <b>amortisation)</b> and net profit. Conclusion: SOE remuneration committees and policymakers should maintain the positive relationship; however, more emphasis should be placed on financial efficiency measurements so as to enhance efficiencies in SOEs...|$|E
