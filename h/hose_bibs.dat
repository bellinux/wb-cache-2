50|$|Water {{flowing through}} opened faucets (including kitchen, bathroom, utility sink faucets, and <b>hose</b> <b>bibs)</b> {{accounts}} for 19 percent (26.3 gphd, or 100 lphd) of total indoor water use {{in an average}} household where faucets are used 51 times per day. On average, faucets are opened for 30 seconds at a flow of 1 gpm (gallons per minute) and an average discharge of 0.5 gallons (1.9 liters) per each use.|$|E
50|$|The outdoor {{residential}} {{water use}} includes landscape irrigation, filling and back washing swimming pools, water used through outdoor faucets (<b>hose</b> <b>bibs)</b> for washing pavement and cars, and other outdoor uses. Annual outdoor use in North American cities differs by climatic region and ranged from 13,000 gallons in Waterloo, Canada to 120,400 gallons in Scottsdale, Arizona. The average outdoor use across 9 sampled {{cities in the}} Water Research Foundation study was 50,500 gallons per household per year or 138 gallons per day (524 liters per day). Nearly 17 percent of homes irrigate their landscapes in excess of theoretical irrigation requirement. If excess irrigation could be eliminated, the average outdoor use would drop by 8,200 gallons per house, or by 16 percent.|$|E
5000|$|A {{water thief}} is a {{synthetic}} rubber fitting that attaches to an unthreaded faucet {{on one end}} and a common garden hose on the other. It is commonly used to fill fresh water tanks in recreational vehicles when a threaded <b>hose</b> <b>bib</b> is not available.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the family}} {{campground}} there are 14 primitive campsites that surround a lake. There are two solar powered composting toilets (limited supplies furnished) and a shared single <b>hose</b> <b>bib</b> of potable water. Only tents and pop-up campers allowed. Some sites have fire rings and picnic tables. Generator use is not permitted in this campground. sfwmd.gov/sul ...|$|R
40|$|In 2004, Madison Water Utility began {{receiving}} customer {{complaints about}} black colored water at {{homes in the}} Nakoma neighborhood, an area historically served by Well 10. Black solids are often associated with oxidized manganese. One home located on Mandan Crescent, for example, had persistent problems despite plumbing changes. While flushing the service line, an action undertaken to remove as much material as possible, a water sample was collected and found to have 244, 000 parts per billion (ppb) manganese, a level nearly 1000 times the lifetime health advisory level of 300 ppb. Additional samples were collected at the original residence, three other area homes, and a neighborhood school. All of the samples had manganese levels below the EPA secondary standard of 50 ppb except for one that had 719 ppb manganese. The high manganese sample was taken from an exterior <b>hose</b> <b>bib</b> {{that had not been}} used during the winter. Subsequent samples taken from the same exterior <b>hose</b> <b>bib</b> later tested at 11 ppb manganese or less. This series of events raised concerns in the neighborhood about the safety of the tap water, which later spread to other areas of the city. Well 10 served the Nakoma and other near west neighborhoods, mostly year-round, since it went into service in 1951. Annual manganese tests at Well 10 over the past decade have ranged from 38 - 60 ppb. In 2003, it was converted to a seasonal well, with planned operation from April to October each year. Major maintenance and rehabilitation work was initiated in March 2005 and continued through the fall of 2005. An aim of the work was to identify a depth zone in the well with potentially lower manganese levels; the effort proved unsuccessful. Since October 2004, Well 10 has been used on a limited basis, primarily for water main flushing, and only during the period of June to August 2006. Two other Madison municipal wells (Well 3 and Well 29) have elevated levels of manganese...|$|R
40|$|Irrigation {{has been}} an {{essential}} part of Utah’s agriculture since pioneer days. Over half of Utah’s 1. 3 million irrigated acres are watered using surface methods such as flood, furrow, border, or basin irrigation. About 40 % of the irrigated acreage is under some form of sprinkler irrigation, including hand move, wheel move, center pivot, and other types. Low flow or micro-irrigation systems, including drip emitters, emitter tubes, drip tapes, bubblers and micro-sprinklers (sprays) are currently used on {{only a small fraction of}} the total irrigated area, but will become more common as water becomes more scarce and expensive. Currently, low flow and micro-irrigation is primarily used in orchards, vegetables and landscapes. When designed and operated properly, low flow or micro-irrigation systems apply water more efficiently and uniformly than sprinklers or surface irrigation systems, conserving water and generating higher yield per unit of water applied. Most low-flow systems are designed to operate at pressures of 10 to 25 pounds per square inch (psi). Municipal water systems typically deliver water at 50 to 70 psi. Water pressure can be tested with a pressure gage designed for water systems. Some gages are designed to test static pressure and can be fastened directly onto the <b>hose</b> <b>bib</b> or pipe. Other gauges are designed to test the pressure of flowing water, such as in a sprinkler nozzle, by inserting the tester directly into the stream of water. Simple pressure gages can be purchased at a local plumbing or irrigation supply store. For most low-flow systems, a pressure reducer will need to be installed to provide the manufacturer-recommended pressures for low-flow components and fittings. Be sure to install the pressure reducer before testing for flow rate...|$|R
