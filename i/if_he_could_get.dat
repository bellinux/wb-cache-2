5|$|In a final vain attempt, Roosevelt's Secretary of State Cordell Hull sent a {{telegram}} on 4 June to the Ambassador to Japan Joseph Grew instructing {{him that the}} United States would still accept a cap of 14-inch guns <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> Japan to as well. The Japanese replied {{that they could not}} accept this unless the number of battleships was also limited; they wanted the United States and the United Kingdom to agree to having an equal number of battleships with Japan, but this was a condition that the two countries refused to accept. On 24 June, the two North Carolinas were ordered with the 14-inch weapons, but on 10 July, Roosevelt directed that they be armed with triple 16-inch instead.|$|E
5|$|The studio had wasted $5 {{million and}} a year's worth of time with Abel and Associates, {{although}} Abel reportedly gained a new production studio filled with equipment using Paramount's money. Trumbull, meanwhile, had completed Close Encounters but his plan for a full feature had been cancelled by Paramount, a move some considered punishment for passing on Star Trek. With Trumbull now available, primary responsibility for The Motion Pictures optical effects passed on to him. In March the studio offered Trumbull virtual carte blanche <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> the opticals work completed by December, the release date to which Paramount was financially committed (having accepted advances from exhibitors planning on a Christmas delivery). Trumbull was confident {{that he could get}} the work done without a loss of quality despite a reputation for missing deadlines because of his perfectionism. Paramount assigned a studio executive to Trumbull to make sure he would meet the release date, and together with Yuricich the effects team rushed to finish. The effects budget climbed to $10million.|$|E
25|$|In late August 1951, Kalchinian, a {{recovering}} drug addict, met Sherman at a doctor's office {{where they were}} both getting treatment for their addiction. They talked about drugs, and Kalchinian eventually asked Sherman <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> him some as his own methadone program wasn't working. Sherman resisted, citing his own efforts to get clean.|$|E

25|$|In September 1941, {{he asked}} John Ryle, {{the brother of}} the philosopher Gilbert Ryle, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> a manual job at Guy's Hospital in London. John Ryle was {{professor}} of medicine at Cambridge and had been involved in helping Guy's prepare for the Blitz. Wittgenstein told Ryle he would die slowly if left at Cambridge, and he would rather die quickly. He started working at Guy's shortly afterwards as a dispensary porter, meaning that he delivered drugs from the pharmacy to the wards—where he apparently advised the patients not to take them.|$|E
25|$|Bell and his partners, Hubbard and Sanders, {{offered to}} sell the patent {{outright}} to Western Union for $100,000. The president of Western Union balked, countering that the telephone {{was nothing but a}} toy. Two years later, he told colleagues that <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> the patent for $25million he would consider it a bargain. By then, the Bell company no longer wanted {{to sell the}} patent. Bell's investors would become millionaires while he fared well from residuals and at one point had assets of nearly one million dollars.|$|E
25|$|Miller {{grew up in}} East Lansing, Michigan. In youth hockey, Miller {{originally}} {{played as}} a forward. However, Miller became frustrated with the poor play of his team's goaltender, so he begged his coach {{as well as his}} father, Dean Miller, to let him try it out. His father told him that <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> two goals and three assists the next game he would buy Ryan a catching glove. Miller finished the game with two goals and three assists in the win. His brother Drew is currently a free agent and three cousins (Kelly Miller, Kip Miller and Kevin Miller) all played in the NHL. All five attended Michigan State University, where Ryan Miller played goalie for three years.|$|E

25|$|Karadžić was {{fortunate}} to be a relative of Jevta Savić Čotrić, the only literate person in the area at the time, who {{taught him how to}} read and write. Karadžić continued his education in the Tronoša Monastery in Loznica. As a boy he learned calligraphy there, using a reed instead of a pen and a solution of gunpowder for ink. In lieu of proper writing paper he was lucky <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> cartridge wrappings. Throughout the whole region, regular schooling was not widespread at that time and his father at first did not allow him to go to Austria. Since most of the time while in the monastery Karadžić was forced to pasture the livestock instead of studying, his father brought him back home. Meanwhile, the First Serbian Uprising seeking to overthrow the Ottomans began in 1804. After unsuccessful attempts to enroll in the gymnasium at Sremski Karlovci, for which 19-year-old Karadžić was too old, Karadžić left for Petrinja where he spent a few months learning Latin and German. Later on, he left for Belgrade, {{now in the hands of}} the Revolutionary Serbia, in order to meet the highly respected scholar Dositej Obradović, and ask him to support his studies. Unfortunately, Obradović dismissed him. Disappointed, Karadžić left for Jadar and began working as a scribe for Jakov Nenadović. After the founding of the Belgrade Higher School, Karadžić became one of its first students.|$|E

It sounded perfect. He put my name in there, which is great – so people know to pronounce it now properly, hopefully."

5000|$|David Joy, the Chief Draughtsman of E. B. Wilson and Company, {{was asked}} to visit Brighton railway works to make tracings of the {{drawings}} of a 2-2-2 locomotive designed by John Gray for the railway so that ten further examples could be built. However, before he had completed the task, Gray had been dismissed from his post of Locomotive Superintendent, and his successor Thomas Kirtley did not favour Gray's complicated horse-leg motion. As a result {{it was left to}} Joy and James Fenton the works manager at E.B. Wilson to adapt the design. Joy had spent his formative years studying all the locomotives he came across, sketching them, making notes, and interrogating their owners and crews - and, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> <b>getting</b> rides on them.|$|R
60|$|The Belgian nodded.

He would forego a share of the gold, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> but <b>get</b> away unscathed with the jewels.|$|R
500|$|In April 1863, Lincoln sent Hay to the Union-occupied South Carolina {{coast to}} report {{back on the}} ironclad vessels being used {{in an attempt to}} {{recapture}} Charleston Harbor. Hay then went on to the Florida coast. He returned to Florida in January 1864, after Lincoln had announced his Ten Percent Plan, that if ten percent of the 1860 electorate in a state took oaths of loyalty and to support emancipation, they could form a government with federal protection. [...] Lincoln considered Florida, with its small population, a good test case, and made Hay a major, sending him to see <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> sufficient men to take the oath. [...] Hay spent a month in the state during February and March 1864, but Union defeats there reduced the area under federal control. [...] Believing his mission impractical, he sailed back to Washington.|$|E
500|$|During the {{following}} 18 months, Bellingham [...] worked to rebuild his commercial career, with modest success. Mary {{continued to work}} as a milliner. The fact that he remained uncompensated continued to rankle. In December 1811 he returned to London, ostensibly to conduct business there, but in reality to resume his campaign for redress. He petitioned the Prince Regent, before resuming his efforts with the Privy Council, the Home Office and the Treasury, only to receive the same polite refusals as before. He then sent a copy of his petition to every member of parliament, again to no avail. On 23 March 1812 he wrote to the magistrates at Bow Street Magistrates' Court, arguing that the government had [...] "completely endeavoured to close the door of justice", and asking the court to intervene. He received a perfunctory reply. After consulting his own MP, Isaac Gascoyne, Bellingham made a final attempt to present his case to the government. On 18 April he met with a Treasury official, Mr Hill, to whom he said that <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> no satisfaction, he would take justice into his own hands. Hill, not perceiving these words as a threat, told him he should take whatever action he deemed proper. On 20 April, Bellingham purchased two [...]50 calibre (12.7mm) pistols from a gunsmith of 58 Skinner Street. He also had a tailor sew an inside pocket to his coat.|$|E
2500|$|A {{possible}} Middleweight matchup between Michael Bisping and Nick Diaz {{was briefly}} linked, but soon {{turned down by}} Diaz.

Dion's closest friends advised him that in Syracuse, the {{population}} {{could be expected to}} enthusiastically join Dion's revolt, <b>if</b> only <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> to the city.

2500|$|The {{solution}} that was agreed {{had also been}} on Lloyd George's mind for years. He met Tim Healy, a senior barrister and former nationalist MP, in late 1919 to consider his options. Healy wrote to his brother on 11 December 1919: [...] "Lloyd George said that, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> support for a plan whereby the six counties would be left as they are, he {{would be ready to}} give {{the rest of the country}} Dominion Home Rule, free from Imperial taxation, and with control of the Customs and Excise."

2500|$|Simon Cowell {{initially}} {{planned to}} release only dance videos, {{but he wanted}} to do more.

His debut double a-side single entitled [...] "Get Up on the Dance Floor/Headz Up" [...] was released on 24 November 2008, with the proceeds going to Great Ormond Street Hospital. After an early fault that meant the single couldn't be downloaded from iTunes for two days, the single finally debuted at number 30 in the UK Singles Chart and remained listed for 4 weeks. The single's position in the charts gradually lowered during that time.|$|E
2500|$|The audacity of {{building}} a transcontinental railroad in the 1860s was [...] "today's equivalent of the mission to Mars: Big, expensive and impossible," [...] according to University of Wyoming historian Phil Roberts. President Abraham Lincoln reportedly told Oakes Ames that <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> the transcontinental railroad built then he would be [...] "the most remembered man of the century." [...] Lincoln personally recruited Oakes after progress by and financial support for Credit Mobilier of America, the construction company charged with building the railroad, ground to a halt. The Ames brothers succeeded where others failed and completed the transcontinental railway. However, in 1873 charges of financial fraud were leveled at Oakes, tarnishing his and the Union Pacific Railroad Company's reputation.|$|E
