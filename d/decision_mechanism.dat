The intent of the Emergency Decision making mechanism was to allow, in cases of mass arrests of CC member or other similar disruptive state action, to allow the CC or a reconstituted CC, to make emergency decisions by consensus without sending the proposal back to regional groups for the normal and necessarily slow back and forth consensus process. This Emergency Decision making mechanism was adopted after concerns were raise {{that it was a}} means to allow the action to become more radical, and to adopt measures such as fence cutting {{to gain access to the}} Seabrook site.No one suggested it was potentially a tool to abandon an action.|$|E

40|$|Swarming and modular robotic {{locomotion}} are two disconnected behaviours that a {{group of}} small homogeneous robots can be used to achieve. The use of these two behaviours is a popular subject in robotics research involving search, rescue and exploration. However, they are rarely addressed as two behaviours that can coexist within a single robotic system. Here, we present a bio-inspired <b>decision</b> <b>mechanism,</b> which provides a convenient way for evolution to configure the conditions and timing of behaving as a swarm or a modular robot in an exploration scenario. The <b>decision</b> <b>mechanism</b> switches among two behaviours that are previously developed (a pheromone-based swarm control and a sinusoidal rectilinear modular robot movement). We use Genetic Programming (GP) to evolve the controller for these decisions, which acts without a centralized mechanism and with limited inter-robot communication.

40|$|Although {{many studies}} have {{documented}} that in-store displays and feature advertising can significantly increase brand choice probabilities, the mechanism through which they affect the choice decision process is not well understood. The marketing literature has suggested two prominent <b>decision</b> <b>mechanisms</b> through which their effects may take place, which I call: the price cut proxy effect and the consideration set formation effect. The primary objective {{of this study is}} to jointly examine these two <b>decision</b> <b>mechanisms</b> suggested in the literature using scanner panel data of actual purchase behavior. I construct a brand choice model based on the behavioral premises of both effects. The proposed model allows consumers to use a combination of various decision processes with different probabilities, and accommodates the correlation in utilizing different <b>decision</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of display and feature ad. Results of the empirical analysis reveal distinct consumer segments with regard to their tendenc ies to use displays and/or feature ads as price cut proxies or for forming consideration sets, and the pattern is consistent with consumer characteristics in each segment, such as degree of state dependence and price sensitivity. Findings from this study shed light on some mixed patterns of promotion interaction effects documented in the literature, and also have interesting implications for promotion decisions...|$|R
