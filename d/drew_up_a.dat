5|$|Tresilian's first wife, Margaret Holland, {{died young}} after bearing three daughters. He then married Elizabeth Fawson. Desiring that Gilwell {{pass on to}} his eldest daughter, also named Margaret (1750–c.1844), Tresilian <b>drew</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> {{detailed}} prenuptial agreement with Fawson's father. By the time of Tresilian's death in 1792, the younger Margaret had married William Bassett Chinnery (1766–1834), the elder brother of the painter George Chinnery.|$|E
5|$|In July 2006, the PAP {{formed a}} workgroup, headed by Phua, to explore {{initiatives}} {{to improve the}} financial security of disabled and special needs children. Phua also led a committee that <b>drew</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> five-year plan to improve services for special needs children. The PAP studied their proposals and later implemented some, such as a National non-profit Special Needs Trust Fund. Laws were also drafted to prohibit abuse of the mentally disabled and to allow parents to appoint someone to look after their special needs children after they die.|$|E
5|$|In {{his later}} life, Richard Gibbs {{recognised}} that the diverse {{interests of the}} large family, {{and the need to}} invest heavily in even basic refurbishment of the house to make it weather-secured and habitable, would require the family to sell Tyntesfield. Recognising also that substantial death duties would become payable on his death, Richard <b>drew</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> will based around a trust that would allow his fortune to pass to the surviving children of his brother and half sister, a total of 19 beneficiaries.|$|E

40|$|This master's thesis follows <b>up</b> <b>a</b> {{theme of}} {{budgeting}} for valuation of public construction contracts. It examines in details how to <b>draw</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> budget and optimize {{it to the}} concrete public construction contract. The thesis is structured in three fundamental chapters. The opening chapter describes theoretical grounds of public construction contracts from the contractor's point of view. Also basic methods how to <b>draw</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> budget are described in the first chapter. The second chapter covers {{a description of a}} systematic approach how to <b>draw</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> cost effective budget, throughout structural cost saving activities. In the third chapter the systematic approach is put in place on concrete public construction contract. The goal of the thesis is to <b>draw</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> competitive budget which won't be rejected from the competition for its exceptionally low price at the same time...|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} 18th century, Bath {{acquired}} its first purpose-built theatre, the Old Orchard Street Theatre. It was rebuilt as the Theatre Royal, {{along with the}} Grand Pump Room attached to the Roman Baths and assembly rooms. Master of ceremonies Beau Nash, {{who presided over the}} city's social life from 1705 until his death in 1761, <b>drew</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> code of behaviour for public entertainments. Bath had become perhaps the most fashionable of the rapidly developing British spa towns, attracting many notable visitors such as the wealthy London bookseller Andrew Millar and his wife, who both made long visits.|$|E
5|$|On 5 February 1942, the Chief of Staff of the United States Army, General George C. Marshall, {{announced}} that he was considering a radical reorganization of the War Department, and gave his staff 48 hours to comment on the proposals. Somervell, now the Assistant Chief of Staff, G-4, and Styer <b>drew</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> plan for a new, overarching logistics command initially known as the Services of Supply. Their proposal was accepted, and the new command was created on 28 February 1942.|$|E
5|$|Planning for the {{operation}} started in December 1940. Erich Buschenhagen, {{chief of staff of}} Army of Norway visited Finland and <b>drew</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> plan which would determine Finland's role in the war, including the first draft of German-Finnish joint operations against the Soviet Union. On 8 December 1940 Hitler issued Directive No. 21, which detailed his plan for Operation Barbarossa as whole and included the targets for proposed German-Finnish cooperation. The detailed operational plan was created by Nikolaus von Falkenhorst with Army of Norway staff in January 1941.|$|E

5|$|The Athenian {{commanders in}} Corinth, Iphicrates, who {{commanded}} the peltasts, and Callias, who commanded the hoplites, saw that an entire Spartan mora, or regiment, of 600 men was marching past the city unprotected by either peltasts or cavalry, {{and decided to}} take advantage of this fact. Accordingly, the Athenian hoplites <b>drew</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> little outside Corinth, while the peltasts went after the Spartan force in pursuit, flinging javelins at the Spartan hoplites.|$|E
5|$|The early 18th century saw Bath acquire {{its first}} {{purpose-built}} theatre, the Theatre Royal, {{along with the}} Grand Pump Room attached to the Roman Baths and assembly rooms.

At the University of Wisconsin–Madison, Stanislaw Ulam gave one of his students, Joan Hinton, an exam early, so she could leave to do war work. A few weeks later, Ulam received a letter from Hans Bethe, inviting him to join the project. Conant personally persuaded Kistiakowsky to join the project.|$|E

5|$|A clergyman {{is said to}} have {{informed}} Richard that Edward IV's {{marriage to}} Elizabeth Woodville was invalid because of Edward's earlier union with Eleanor Butler, making Edward V and his siblings illegitimate. The identity of the informant is known only through the memoires of French diplomat Philippe de Commines as Robert Stillington, the Bishop of Bath and Wells. On 22 June 1483, a sermon was preached outside Old St. Paul's Cathedral declaring Edward's children bastards and Richard the rightful king. Shortly after, the citizens of London, both nobles and commons, convened and <b>drew</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> petition asking Richard to assume the throne. He accepted on 26 June and was crowned at Westminster Abbey on 6 July 1483. His title to the throne was confirmed by Parliament in January 1484 by the document Titulus Regius.|$|E
5|$|After the Hollywood {{theme was}} decided on, the design team <b>drew</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> map and {{assigned}} objects and puzzles to different areas. The game was originally {{designed for the}} ZX Spectrum and then ported to the Amstrad CPC, due to the systems' similar architecture. However, the team struggled to port the game to the Commodore 64 due to it being a different machine altogether. The finished game is significantly changed from the incomplete Movieland Dizzy, which featured only film sets as locations, the surrounding film studio and backlots were not present. The real-world studio elements were added after Dizzy was disassociated from the game.|$|E
5|$|As Austria {{was short}} of {{experienced}} military commanders, Maria Theresa released Marshall Neipperg, {{who had been}} imprisoned by her father for his poor performance in the Turkish War. Neipperg took command of the Austrian troops in March. The Austrians suffered a crushing defeat at the Battle of Mollwitz in April 1741. France <b>drew</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> plan to partition Austria between Prussia, Bavaria, Saxony and Spain. Marshall Belle-Isle joined Frederick at Olmütz. Vienna was in a panic, as none of Maria Theresa's advisors expected France to betray them. Francis Stephen urged Maria Theresa to reach a rapprochement with Prussia, as did Great Britain. Maria Theresa reluctantly agreed to negotiations.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of June 1807, the Emperor reassessed his strategic situation and decided {{that he needed to}} move northeast, in order to prevent Bennigsen's Russian army from using the bridge at Friedland to cross the Alle river. If the Russians managed to cross the Alle river at Friedland, they could then move closer to their Prussian allies, who were based in Königsberg. Napoleon <b>drew</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> plan, giving Marshal Murat two army corps and a powerful cavalry reserve, with orders to march on Königsberg, while sending the rest of the troops towards Friedland. Leading the thrust towards Friedland was Marshal Jean Lannes's Reserve Corps (two infantry divisions and one cavalry brigade), with Grouchy's dragoons and Nansouty's horse carabiniers and cuirassiers temporarily attached. In Murat's absence, Grouchy was the senior cavalry commander and was to take overall command of all the cavalry that remained with the Emperor.|$|E
5|$|Before the British Mandatory {{government}} {{took over in}} 1917, the main commercial district in Jerusalem was in the Old City. With an eye to the continuing development of new neighborhoods outside the Old City Walls, the British <b>drew</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> master town plan that called {{for the establishment of}} two commercial hubs in the New City. The first commercial district to be built was the Downtown Triangle, although it was intended to play a secondary role to the other planned commercial district in the Mamilla area, which was closer to the Old City. However, the Mamilla development did not garner as much interest as the Triangle.|$|E
5|$|Edward {{had shown}} {{independence}} in political matters {{as early as}} 1255, when he sided with the Soler family in Gascony, in the ongoing conflict between the Soler and Colomb families. This ran contrary to his father's policy of mediation between the local factions. In May 1258, a group of magnates <b>drew</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> document for reform of the King’s government – the so-called Provisions of Oxford – largely directed against the Lusignans. Edward stood by his political allies and strongly opposed the Provisions. The reform movement succeeded in limiting the Lusignan influence, however, and gradually Edward's attitude started to change. In March 1259, he entered into a formal alliance {{with one of the}} main reformers, Richard de Clare, Earl of Gloucester. Then, on 15October 1259, he announced that he supported the barons' goals, and their leader, Simon de Montfort.|$|E

5|$|In 1917, the British {{captured}} Palestine {{from the}} Ottomans, and in 192223 Tubas {{was incorporated into}} the British Mandate of Palestine. In 1947, the United Nations <b>drew</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> partition plan to divide Palestine into Jewish and Arab states; Tubas and the surrounding villages and hamlets were {{to be included in}} the Arab state. During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Fawzi al-Qawuqji led 750 Arab Liberation Army (ALA) soldiers to Tubas from Transjordan and set up base there; Tubas would serve as the ALA's headquarters in central Palestine throughout the war. Transjordan (became Jordan in April 1949) annexed the city along with the entire West Bank, after gaining control of it during the war. In 1955 the first girls' school was opened. Tubas was under their control until 1967, when Israel occupied the West Bank during the Six-Day War.|$|E
5|$|In March 1942, Bush sent {{a report}} to Roosevelt {{outlining}} work by Robert Oppenheimer on the nuclear cross section of uranium-235. Oppenheimer's calculations, which Bush had George Kistiakowsky check, estimated that the critical mass of a sphere of uranium-235 was {{in the range of}} 2.5 to 5 kilograms, with a destructive power of around 2,000 tons of TNT. Moreover, it appeared that plutonium might be even more fissile. After conferring with Brigadier General Lucius D. Clay about the construction requirements, Bush <b>drew</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> submission for $85 million in fiscal year 1943 for four pilot plants, which he forwarded to Roosevelt on June 17, 1942. With the Army on board, Bush moved to streamline oversight of the project by the OSRD, replacing the S-1 Section with a new S-1 Executive Committee.|$|E
5|$|In the 17th century, Cluj {{suffered}} from great calamities, suffering from epidemics of the plague and devastating fires. The {{end of this}} century brought the end of Turkish sovereignty, but found the city bereft of much of its wealth, municipal freedom, cultural centrality, political significance and even population. It gradually regained its important position within Transylvania as the headquarters of the Gubernium and the Diets between 1719 and 1732, and again from 1790 until the revolution of 1848, when the Gubernium moved to Nagyszeben (Hermannstadt), present-day Sibiu). In 1791, a group of Romanian intellectuals <b>drew</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> petition, known as Supplex Libellus Valachorum, which was sent to the Emperor in Vienna. The petition demanded the equality of the Romanian nation in Transylvania in respect to the other nations (Saxon, Szekler and Hungarian) governed by the Unio Trium Nationum, but it was rejected by the Diet of Cluj.|$|E
