The game was released for the Xbox 360 on May 23, 2006 in North America, and on May 26, 2006 in Europe. On July 18, 2007, Rockstar announced that the game would be ported to the Wii, {{taking advantage of the}} motion sensing Wii Remote. The Wii version was released on October 17, 2007 in North America, and on October 19, 2007 in Europe.|$|E

25|$|In 1996, Saccharomyces cerevisiae was {{the first}} single-celled, {{eukaryotic}} organism to have its entire genome sequenced. This sequencing helped confirm the nearly century of work by mycologists and enologists in identifying different strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{that are used in}} beer, bread and winemaking. Today there are several hundred different strains of S. cerevisiae identified. Not all of the strains are suitable for winemaking and even among the strains that are, there is debate among winemakers and scientists about the actual magnitude of differences between the various strains and their potential impact on the wine. Even among strains that have demonstrated distinctive <b>difference</b> <b>when</b> compared among young wines, these differences seem to fade and become less distinctive as the wines age.|$|E
25|$|In 1806, Nashville was {{chartered}} as a city. The city's first {{debt and}} first large-scale public works project was {{the building of}} the Nashville Water Works, centered around the reservoir located on a bluff south of the city, now known as Rolling Mill Hill. The money was loaned by Philadelphia businessmen, and part of the amount was used to purchase around twelve enslaved Black men in Virginia to work on the project. The $50,000 loan was insufficient to cover the $55,000 cost of construction, but the rising value of the slaves purchased by the city covered the <b>difference</b> <b>when</b> all but one or two were sold {{at the end of the}} project.

25|$|A recent {{addition}} to the SOA family is the vertical-cavity SOA (VCSOA). These devices are similar in structure to, and share many features with, vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs). The major <b>difference</b> <b>when</b> comparing VCSOAs and VCSELs is the reduced mirror reflectivity used in the amplifier cavity. With VCSOAs, reduced feedback is necessary to prevent the device from reaching lasing threshold. Due to the extremely short cavity length, and correspondingly thin gain medium, these devices exhibit very low single-pass gain (typically {{on the order of}} a few percent) and also a very large free spectral range (FSR). The small single-pass gain requires relatively high mirror reflectivity to boost the total signal gain. In {{addition to}} boosting the total signal gain, the use of the resonant cavity structure results in a very narrow gain bandwidth; coupled with the large FSR of the optical cavity, this effectively limits operation of the VCSOA to single-channel amplification. Thus, VCSOAs can be seen as amplifying filters.|$|E
25|$|In general, sexual {{dimorphism}} can {{be attributed}} to greater intraspecific competition in one sex, either between rivals for access to mates and/or to be chosen by mates. This may stem from the other gender being constrained by providing greater parental investment, in terms of factors such as gamete production, gestation, lactation, or upbringing of young. Although there is much variation in species, generally the more physically aggressive sex is the male, particularly in mammals. In species where parental care by both sexes is required, there tends to be less of a <b>difference.</b> <b>When</b> the female can leave the male to care for the offspring, then females may be the larger and more physically aggressive. Competitiveness despite parental investment has also been observed in some species. A related factor is the rate at which males and females are able to mate again after producing offspring, and the basic principles of sexual selection are also influenced by ecological factors affecting the ways or extent to which one sex can compete for the other. The role of such factors in human evolution is controversial.|$|E

500|$|Similar to {{the work}} in Shaun of the Dead, blood and gore was {{prevalent}} throughout the film. Visual effects supervisor Richard Briscoe revealed the rationale for using the large amounts of blood: [...] "In many ways, the more extreme you make it, the more people know it is stylised and enjoy the humour inherent in how ridiculous it is. It's rather like the (eventually) limbless Black Knight in Monty Python's Holy Grail." [...] The most time-consuming gore sequence involved a character's head being crushed by a section of a church. A dummy was used against a green screen and the head was detonated at the point when the object was about to impact the body. Throughout the film, over seventy gunfight shots were digitally augmented; Briscoe's rationale for adding the additional effects was that [...] "The town square shootout, for example, is full of extra little hits scattered throughout, so that it feels like our hero characters really do have it all going off, all around them. It was a great demonstration of [...] seemingly very trivial enhancements can make a <b>difference</b> <b>when</b> combined across a sequence." ...|$|E
