500|$|Preliminary {{results of}} studies on the pygmy slow loris {{indicate}} that its diet consists primarily of gums and nectar (especially nectar from Saraca dives flowers), and that animal prey makes up 30–40% of its diet. However, one 2002 analysis of pygmy slow loris feces indicated that it contained 98% insect remains and just 2% plant remains. The pygmy slow loris often returns to the same gum feeding sites and leaves conspicuous gouges on tree trunks when inducing the flow of exudates. Slow lorises have been reported gouging for exudates at heights ranging from [...] {{to as much as}} the gouging process, whereby the loris repetitively bangs its toothcomb into the <b>hard</b> <b>bark,</b> may be loud enough to be heard up to [...] away. The marks remaining after gouging can be used by field workers to assess loris presence in an area. Captive pygmy slow lorises also make characteristic gouge marks in wooden substrates, such as branches. It is not known how the sympatric pygmy and Bengal slow lorises partition their feeding niches. The plant gums, obtained typically from species in the family Fabaceae (peas), are high in carbohydrates and lipids, and can serve as a year-around source of food, or an emergency reserve when other preferred food items are scarce. Several anatomical adaptations present in slow lorises may enhance their ability to feed on exudates: a long narrow tongue {{to make it easier to}} reach gum stashed in cracks and crevices, a large cecum to help the animal digest complex carbohydrates, and a short duodenum to help quickly pass potentially toxic exudates. Slow lorises can use both hands to eat while hanging upside down from a branch. They spend about 20% of their nightly activities feeding.|$|E
6000|$|The {{darkness}} of the shed displeased Carl. The whole basic conception of work bored him. The sticks of wood were personal enemies to which he gave insulting names. He had always admired the <b>hard</b> <b>bark</b> and metallic resonance of the ironwood, but he hated the poplar--"popple" [...] it is called in Joralemon, Minnesota. Poplar becomes dry and dusty, and the bark turns to a monstrously mottled and evil greenish-white. Carl announced to one poplar stick, [...] "I could lick you! I'm a gen'ral, I am." [...] The stick made no reply whatever, and he contemptuously shied it out into the chickweed which matted the grubby back yard. This necessitated his sneaking out and capturing it by stalking it from the rear, lest it rouse the Popple Army.|$|E

50|$|It is a {{very large}} {{evergreen}} tree, reaching up to 70 m tall and 4 m trunk diameter, with red-brown bark which peels in vertical strips. The leaves are arranged spirally, needle-like, 0.5 - 1 cm long; and the seed cones globular, 1 - 2 cm diameter with about 20-40 scales. It is superficially similar to the related giant sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum), from which it can be differentiated by the longer leaves (under 0.5 cm in the giant sequoia) and smaller cones (4-6 cm in the giant sequoia), and the <b>harder</b> <b>bark</b> on the trunk (thick, soft and spongy in giant sequoia).|$|R
60|$|That night her snug little nest perched high in {{the great}} tree seemed less the {{sanctuary}} that it had before. What might resist the sanguinary intentions of a prowling panther would prove no great barrier to man, and influenced by this thought she slept less well than before. The slightest noise that broke the monotonous hum of the nocturnal jungle startled her into alert wakefulness to lie with straining ears {{in an attempt to}} classify the origin of the disturbance, and once she was awakened thus by a sound that seemed to come from something moving in her own tree. She listened intently--scarce breathing. Yes, there it was again. A scuffing of something soft against the <b>hard</b> <b>bark</b> of the tree. The woman reached out in the darkness and grasped her spear. Now she felt a slight sagging of one of the limbs that supported her shelter as though the thing, whatever it was, was slowly raising its weight to the branch. It came nearer. Now she thought that she could detect its breathing. It was at the door. She could hear it fumbling with the frail barrier. What could it be? It made no sound by which she might identify it. She raised herself upon her hands and knees and crept stealthily the little distance to the doorway, her spear clutched tightly in her hand. Whatever the thing was, it was evidently attempting to gain entrance without awakening her. It was just beyond the pitiful little contraption of slender boughs that she had bound together with grasses and called a door--only a few inches lay between the thing and her. Rising to her knees she reached out with her left hand and felt until she found a place where a crooked branch had left an opening a couple of inches wide {{near the center of the}} barrier. Into this she inserted the point of her spear. The thing must have heard her move within for suddenly it abandoned its efforts for stealth and tore angrily at the obstacle. At the same moment Jane thrust her spear forward with all her strength. She felt it enter flesh. There was a scream and a curse from without, followed by the crashing of a body through limbs and foliage. Her spear was almost dragged from her grasp, but she held to it until it broke free from the thing it had pierced.|$|E

40|$|Bark anatomy is an unappreciated {{discipline}} in plant systematics, despite its great potential to reveal systematically informative features. In this paper, {{main reasons for}} the lack of detailed bark anatomical data in many plant families are identified, including problems with sectioning, terminological issues, and difficulties in observation of dilated stems. We deal with these problems by focusing on two aspects: (1) compare, discuss and improve existing sectioning and maceration techniques using two species with soft and <b>hard</b> <b>bark</b> tissues; and (2) discuss the best way to collect stem bark samples. We hope that this paper will stimulate inclusion of bark anatomical data in future systematic studies. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Development of the macromycete flora of {{windfall}} beech logs {{in different}} stages of decay were studied over 10 years. The occurrence of 48 species found on more than six logs are discussed in relation to five 5 -year periods of progressing decomposition.

Polyporaceous species have a slight dominance in this period, while saprophytic agarics are more frequent in the later periods. Many species, including Armillaria mellea, Fomes fomentarius and other necrotrofic parasites are met in all 5 -year periods. The final stage of decay is characterized by slow invasion of species of the forest floor...|$|E
