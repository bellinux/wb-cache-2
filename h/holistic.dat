5|$|Hanegraaff {{identified}} the second main healing current in the New Age movement as being <b>holistic</b> health. This {{emerged in the}} 1970s out of the free clinic movement of the 1960s, and has various connections with the Human Potential Movement. It emphasises {{the idea that the}} human individual is a <b>holistic,</b> interdependent relationship between mind, body, and spirit, and that healing is a process in which an individual becomes whole by integrating with the powers of the universe. A very wide array of methods are utilised within the <b>holistic</b> health movement, {{with some of the most}} common including acupuncture, reiki, biofeedback, chiropractic, yoga, kinesiology, homeopathy, aromatherapy iridology, massage and other forms of bodywork, meditation and visualisation, nutritional therapy, psychic healing, herbal medicine, healing using crystals, metals, music, chromotherapy, and reincarnation therapy. The use of crystal healing has become a particularly prominent visual trope within the New Age; this practice was not common in esotericism prior to their adoption in the New Age milieu.|$|E
5|$|Brady v. Maryland (1963) {{is another}} significant, {{specific}} criminal procedural right {{guaranteed by the}} due process clauses. Brady requires a criminal conviction to be reversed if the government withholds exculpatory (or impeachment) material, within the government's possession, from the defendant, {{and there is a}} reasonable probability that, if such material had been disclosed, the result of the proceeding would have been different ("materiality"). Brady is a <b>holistic,</b> rather than piece-by-piece, inquiry.|$|E
5|$|The 4 MINDS schools offer four {{programs}}; Pre-School, Junior, Senior and Special {{programs for}} pupils who have Autistic Spectrum Disorders (ASD), and are severely disabled intellectually or have challenging behaviours. The curriculum is tailored {{to suit the}} special needs of individual children and {{the focus is on the}} functional needs of the pupils for the present and the future. Areas of learning include language communication, functional academics such as time telling, money value, self-help skills and personal grooming, social competency and pre-vocational skills. To promote the <b>holistic</b> development of pupils, the schools have within their curriculum time, physical education, music and swimming. A multidisciplinary team of Allied Health Professionals in each school, such as psychologists, social workers, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech therapists, ensures a <b>holistic</b> approach to the development of pupils and support for their families.|$|E
5|$|The Nan Chiau Youth Mentors (NCYM) {{consists}} of young graduates from Nan Chiau High School who have strong passion of providing {{assistance to the}} juniors {{within the scope of}} a <b>holistic</b> education. The members of team works alongside the school to provide assistance and sharing for upper secondary levels preparing for national examinations, as well as individual mentorship of their former Co-curricular Activities (CCAs).|$|E
5|$|The {{gates of}} the Temple of Jerusalem used Corinthian bronze treated with {{depletion}} gilding. The process was most prevalent in Alexandria, where alchemy {{is thought to have}} begun. In ancient India, copper was used in the <b>holistic</b> medical science Ayurveda for surgical instruments and other medical equipment. Ancient Egyptians (~2400BC) used copper for sterilizing wounds and drinking water, and later to treat headaches, burns, and itching.|$|E
5|$|There are {{different}} {{opinions on the}} significance of these principles. Some note that the osteopathic medical philosophy is akin to the tenets of <b>holistic</b> medicine, suggestive of a kind of social movement within the field of medicine, one that promotes a more patient-centered, <b>holistic</b> approach to medicine, and emphasizes the role of the primary care physician within the health care system. Others point out that {{there is nothing in the}} principles that would distinguish D.O. from M.D. training in any fundamental way. One study, published in The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association found a majority of M.D. medical school administrators and faculty saw nothing objectionable in the core principles listed above, and some endorse them generally as broad medical principles.|$|E
5|$|There is no ethical {{cohesion}} {{within the}} New Age phenomenon, although Hanegraaff {{argued that the}} central ethical tenet of the New Age is to cultivate one's own divine potential. Given that the movement's <b>holistic</b> interpretation of the universe prohibits a belief in a dualistic good and evil, negative events that happen are interpreted not {{as the result of}} evil but as lessons designed to teach an individual and enable them to advance spiritually.|$|E
5|$|With the {{relocation}} and separation of Nan Chiau High School with the ancillary primary school section in December 2000, NCAA presently functions at both Nan Chiau Primary School and Nan Chiau High School. In 2001, the NCAA started the Weekend Activities Program at Nan Chiau Primary School {{to complement the}} school curriculum, and is highly successful for providing a <b>holistic</b> education for the primary school pupils.|$|E
5|$|Shada was a six-part serial {{written by}} Douglas Adams {{that was to}} have {{concluded}} Series 17 in 1980. Production was halted during filming due to a strike and never resumed, although a reconstruction of the serial using narration and existing footage was later released on VHS in 1992. The story was later adapted by Big Finish in 2003 as a webcast production featuring Paul McGann's Eighth Doctor (and later released as an audio story that same year), while Adams himself reused elements from the serial for his first Dirk Gently novel Dirk Gently's <b>Holistic</b> Detective Agency. The story was novelized by Gareth Roberts in 2012.|$|E
5|$|The {{book also}} has a {{practical}} dimension, presenting debates between anthropocentric and non-anthropocentric approaches to environmental ethics as of little practical consequence, and suggesting that animal rights goals can be consistent with <b>holistic</b> environmentalist goals. Jensen argues that Varner's own discussion of the reconciliation of environmentalism and animal advocacy is too narrow, but that, nonetheless, Varner's own biocentric individualism offers potential in this area, even despite the limited engagement in the book with practical animal-related issues.|$|E
5|$|Varner's In Nature's Interests? {{offers a}} {{resolution}} of the debate between individualistic approaches to animal rights and <b>holistic</b> accounts of environmental ethics. Varner defends an interest-based biocentric individualism according to which all living beings—including plants—have morally significant interests that ground prima facie (though overridable) duties. The approach follows {{in the tradition of the}} work of Kenneth Goodpaster and Paul Taylor, though Varner's approach differs from Taylor's in its focus on interests rather than duties, with Varner showing clear utilitarian commitments.|$|E

25|$|While {{originally}} {{developed as a}} tool for range land use and restoring desertified land, the <b>holistic</b> management system can be applied to other areas with multiple complex socioeconomic and environmental factors. One such example is Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM), which promotes sector integration in development and management of water resources to ensure that water is allocated between different users in a fair way, maximizing economic and social welfare without compromising the sustainability of vital ecosystems. In essence, coordinated <b>holistic</b> water management takes into consideration all water users in nature and society. Another example is mine reclamation. A fourth use of <b>Holistic</b> management is in certain forms of no till crop production, intercropping, and permaculture. <b>Holistic</b> management has been acknowledged by The United States Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service (USDA-NRCS).|$|E
25|$|<b>Holistic</b> Understanding. The <b>Holistic</b> Understanding {{perspective}} {{was founded}} by Merry Merryfield, focusing on understanding the self {{in relation to a}} global community. This perspective follows a curriculum that attends to human values and beliefs, global systems, issues, history, cross-cultural understandings, and the development of analytical and evaluative skills.|$|E

25|$|The Adventist {{views about}} death and hell reflect an {{underlying}} belief in: (a) conditional immortality (or conditionalism), {{as opposed to}} the immortality of the soul; and (b) the <b>holistic</b> (or monistic) Christian anthropology or nature of human beings, as opposed to bipartite or tripartite views. Adventist education hence strives to be <b>holistic</b> in nature, involving not just the mind but all aspects of a person.|$|E
25|$|In Qur'an and Woman, Amina Wadud places {{interpretation}}s of the Quran into three categories: traditional, reactive, and <b>holistic.</b> The type of interpretation one applies to sura 4 greatly influences one's perspective {{on the role of}} women within Muslim society. Taking the third approach, a <b>holistic</b> approach, allows for a feminist reading of the Quran, which is particularly relevant in relation to an-Nisā and can reshape the understanding of this sura.|$|E
25|$|Optimal {{management}} of wounds requires <b>holistic</b> assessment. Documentation of the patient’s pain experience is critical and may {{range from the}} use of a patient diary, (which should be patient driven), to recording pain entirely by the healthcare professional or caregiver. Effective communication between the patient and the healthcare team is fundamental to this <b>holistic</b> approach. The more frequently healthcare professionals measure pain, the greater the likelihood of introducing or changing pain management practices.|$|E

25|$|During {{the twentieth}} century the {{relationship}} between science and spirituality has been influenced both by Freudian psychology, which has accentuated the boundaries between the two areas by accentuating individualism and secularism, and by developments in particle physics, which reopened the debate about complementarity between scientific and religious discourse and rekindled for many an interest in <b>holistic</b> conceptions of reality. These <b>holistic</b> conceptions were championed by New Age spiritualists in a type of quantum mysticism that they claim justifies their spiritual beliefs, though quantum physicists themselves on the whole reject such attempts as being pseudoscientific.|$|E

25|$|System {{development}} {{often requires}} contribution from diverse technical disciplines. By providing a systems (<b>holistic)</b> {{view of the}} development effort, systems engineering helps mold all the technical contributors into a unified team effort, forming a structured development process that proceeds from concept to production to operation and, in some cases, to termination and disposal. In an acquisition, the <b>holistic</b> integrative discipline combines contributions and balances tradeoffs among cost, schedule, and performance while maintaining an acceptable level of risk covering the entire life cycle of the item.|$|E
