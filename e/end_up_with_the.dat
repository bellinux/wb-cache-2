5|$|Apart {{from the}} {{sideline}} 4...g5, {{the main line}} continues with both players developing their pieces around the e5-pawn with 4...Nc6 5.Nf3 Bb4+ when White has an important choice between the moves 6.Nc3 and 6.Nbd2, each leading to extremely different play. With 6.Nc3 White acquiesces to the breakup of his queenside pawns {{in return for a}} material advantage of one pawn, the bishop pair and active play in the centre. With 6.Nbd2 White gives back the gambited pawn to keep a healthy pawn structure and acquire the bishop pair. After 6.Nbd2Qe7 White generally plays 7.a3 to force the immediate exchange of bishop for knight, gaining the bishop pair, a spatial advantage and chances for a minority attack on the queenside. White can also try 6.Nbd2Qe7 7.e3 to win a tempo over the 7.a3 variation, though he may <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> exchange at d2 made in less favourable circumstances, or not at all.

25|$|The merle allele, which {{produces}} a mingled or patchwork combination of {{dark and light}} areas, is the coat pattern most commonly associated with the breed. This merle (M) is dominant, so heterozygous dogs (Mm) show the pigmentation pattern; however, when two merles are bred, the statistical risk is 25% of the offspring will <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> two copies of the merle gene (homozygous). These dogs usually have a mostly white coat and blue irises, and are often deaf, blind, or both. In this case, the deafness and blindness are linked to having two copies of the merle gene, which disrupts pigmentation and produces these health defects.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of their {{surprise}} run, very few changes were made in the off-season. Veterans such as Aaron Ward, Andrew Alberts and Stephane Yelle were brought in to help drive the team further, but things did not go according to plan. The Hurricanes experienced a 14-game losing streak spanning October and November, and midway through the year, the 'Canes replaced their only post-lockout captain Rod Brind'Amour with Eric Staal.

Originally, the Rockets had a three-way trade with the Portland Trail Blazers setup involving Ryan Anderson, but with the Knicks changing its front office after parting ways with Phil Jackson, they decided to withhold the trade to the Rockets altogether. After more concerns with the Knicks and the new Knicks' front office stating their expectations clearly to the media, Anthony decided to expand his list of teams to include the Cavaliers again and the Oklahoma City Thunder.|$|E

500|$|Mick LaSalle gave {{a largely}} {{negative}} review. [...] "A.I. exhibits all its creators' bad traits {{and none of}} the good. So we <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> structureless, meandering, slow-motion endlessness of Kubrick combined with the fuzzy, cuddly mindlessness of Spielberg." [...] Dubbing it Spielberg's [...] "first boring movie", LaSalle also believed the robots {{at the end of the}} film were aliens, and compared Gigolo Joe to the [...] "useless" [...] Jar Jar Binks, yet praised Robin Williams for his portrayal of a futuristic Albert Einstein. Peter Travers gave a mixed review, concluding [...] "Spielberg cannot live up to Kubrick's darker side of the future." [...] But he still put the film on his top ten list that year for best movies. David Denby in The New Yorker criticized A.I. for not adhering closely to his concept of the Pinocchio character. Spielberg responded to some of the criticisms of the film, stating that many of the [...] "so called sentimental" [...] elements of A.I., including the ending, were in fact Kubrick's and the darker elements were his own. However, Sara Maitland, who worked on the project with Kubrick in the 1990s, claimed that one of the reasons Kubrick never started production on A.I. was because he had a hard time making the ending work. James Berardinelli found the film [...] "consistently involving, with moments of near-brilliance, but far from a masterpiece. In fact, as the long-awaited 'collaboration' of Kubrick and Spielberg, it ranks as something of a disappointment." [...] Of the film's highly debated finale, he claimed, [...] "There is no doubt that the concluding 30 minutes are all Spielberg; the outstanding question is where Kubrick's vision left off and Spielberg's began." ...|$|E

2500|$|Justice Breyer envisioned three {{possible}} {{responses to the}} majority's decision. First, legislatures could prescribe exactly the same sentence for all possible variations of a crime [...] an automatic five-year sentence for all robberies, for instance. This system has the [...] "intolerable" [...] effect of imposing the same sentence on people who commit their crimes in vastly different ways. [...] Prosecutors would <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> real control over defendants' sentences, since prosecutors ultimately make the decisions regarding how to charge the case. Second, states could return to indeterminate sentencing, in which the authorized range of punishment for crimes is very broad. But such systems were criticized (rightly, in Breyer's view) for their excessive disparity and unfairness. There would be less [...] "reason" [...] in an indeterminate sentencing system than in the guidelines system Washington had adopted.|$|E
2500|$|Third, the {{guidelines}} systems {{currently in force}} would remain, and the jury-trial requirement would be grafted onto them. [...] Breyer predicted this could play out {{in one of two}} ways. [...] First, legislatures might redefine crimes with highly specific detail [...] a robbery statute could enhance punishment based on the value of the goods taken, whether a gun was used, the seriousness of the threat used to obtain the goods, and so on. But the result of this system would be the same as the first option [...] prosecutors would <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> discretion to determine the defendant's sentence by manipulating the charge. [...] Second, two juries could be assembled for each criminal trial, one for the guilt phase and one for the penalty phase. [...] But this approach would be costly, as the experience with bifurcated trials in capital cases has shown.|$|E

2500|$|A {{significant}} percentage of military brats report difficulty in forming strong relations with people or places, but very often do form strong connections with (or in some cases aversion to) {{the notion of a}} military base and the communities in which they find themselves. This is because the knowledge, experience, values, ideas, attitudes, skills, tastes, and techniques that are associated with the military can sometimes differ from civilian culture. Military bases are miniature, self-contained, government-subsidized towns that promote conformity. Military families shop at some of the same stores, whose discounted merchandise is regulated to prevent unfair competition, so they can often <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> same clothes and products. Male brats were, at one time, likely to get the same [...] "military haircut" [...] at the base barbershop, but this has changed over time. To a child growing up on a military base, in a homogeneous culture, the individuality of civilian life was once thought to be completely foreign. However, as the individual children have attended civilian schools near base and socialized with their peers, this perceived difference may have reduced to varying degrees.|$|E
2500|$|Kabakov {{described}} {{the colors of}} paint in The Russian Series and Three Green Paintings as the main characters. The brown sandy soil color of the first series was the same enamel used in the Soviet Union during the 1950s and 1960s to paint everything from roofs to hallways, but most often floors. Kabakov {{points out that the}} color of the state is red but the color of the country is gray, due to its “humdrum existence”. [...] Kabakov assigns these colors a metaphysical meaning of earth and nature as controlled and depicted by the Soviet state. [...] He then suggests that if you mix these two colors you <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> brown sandy soil color, which signifies both the floors and the ground that support the feet of the populace of the Soviet Union. The green of the second series is enamel that was used to paint {{the lower part of the}} walls up to one meter high in order to protect them from dirt and scuffs. For Kabakov, these colors evoke feelings of unavoidable hopelessness. More pertinent to this argument is what these series of paintings do not address. Political ideology is absent and only impersonal colors exist to dominate minor features, all of which are faceless texts and objects.|$|E
2500|$|As {{early as}} 1982 when the Compact Disc was being introduced, Blyth {{researched}} {{the possibilities of}} creating a digital mixing console. He told Billboard magazine that Soundcraft would not be [...] "leaping into digital {{in the way that}} Neve has done. I think they have gone too far, too quickly.... We are looking at the digital control of analog functions as the first step in that direction." [...] Picking up the pace in the 2000s, Blyth, together with Product Manager Andy Brown, created the Soundcraft Vi6, a digital mixer intended for sound reinforcement applications, released mid-2006. Its interface was a development of Vistonics, a broadcast and studio mixing concept from Harman-owned Studer combined with a digital effects package from Lexicon. Regarding digital audio equipment, Blyth is of the opinion that [...] "companies that take great care over their analog stages, use the best internal digital format and write the best DSP code <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> best sounding product." [...] He said that he has [...] "strong views on the whole subject of digital consoles, which could fill an article with mostly purple prose", but he notes that [...] "best-in-class analog product these days is truly excellent, but so is digital." [...] Blyth continues today as technical director at Soundcraft Studer's design offices at Potters Bar, [...] north of London.|$|E
