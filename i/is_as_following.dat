When Yorimitsu suffered from malaria, and lay on a bed, a strange monk who was 7 shaku (about 2.1 meters) tall appeared, released some rope, and tried to capture him. Yorimitsu, despite his sickness, cut him with his famous sword, the Hizamaru (膝丸), causing the monk to flee. The next day, Yorimitsu led his Four Guardian Kings to chase after the blood trail of the monk, and arrived at a mound behind Kitano jinja where there was a large spider that was 4 shaku wide (about 1.2 meters). Yorimitsu and the others caught it, pierced it with an iron skewer, and exposed it to a riverbed. Yorimitsu's illness left him immediately, and the sword that cut the spider was from then on called the Kumo-kiri (蜘蛛切り, spider-cutter). The true identity of this tsuchigumo was said to be an onryō of the aforementioned local clan defeated by Emperor Jimmu. This tale is also known from the very fifth noh, [...] "Tsuchigumo." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we propose}} {{cylindrical}} coordinate system which can analyze upper-body pose of the depth images correctly. This method extracts the part of human body from the depth images, and we configure {{the center of the}} part as origin of the {{cylindrical coordinate system}}. And we configure multi-layered cylinders based on the origin, then, we can analyze pose using the pattern which is crossed depth images namely cylinders and upper-body. Since the crossed point of the cylinders and upper-body is obtained as brightness values, it can extract to convert feature vector of the cylindrical coordinate system. The extracted feature vectors of the cylindrical coordinate system are presented to feature space of circular and are categorized pose patterns. The pose patterns are learned using average value of the feature vectors, and the pose patterns are categorized as pose to compare to pre-defined pose patterns using Euclidean distance. In this paper, we applied dynamic cylinder model to the region of the upper-body, so we can be classified as head, body and arms through simple computation, and to extract pose information is possible effectively. In this paper, the effect that can get through proposing pose estimation method <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>following.</b> At the first, pose estimation is possible by using only minimum feature points which apply cylinder model in region that connect human's torso, head and arms. The second <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>following.</b> When we obtain the feature points, because of applying cylinder model, we can extract user's feature points and angle of rotation easily. And in this paper, we don't consider the status of the user's body is titled using only the upper-body poses of the state rightly standing pose toward the front. Because it has disadvantage which cannot distinguish between changes according to the tile of the torso, but we can detect the vectors of the hands and arm using cylindrical coordinate system. Therefore, in the future, we will study to be able to recognize the pose in the tilted status...|$|E
30|$|The {{organization}} {{of this paper}} <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>following.</b> In section “A short overview of the theoretical framework” we give a short overview {{on the evolution of}} parton densities, using DGLAP equations. The theoretical framework is based on using Laguerre polynomial expansions. In section “Basic tools, Monte Carlo solutions” the general structure of Monte Carlo algorithm is introduced. The required functions and subroutines are also introduced there. They can be requested via E-mail, a.mirjalili@yazd.ac.ir, from the authors. Then we use them to build the related Monte Carlo algorithm to get the numerical solutions for DGLAP evolution equations. The results are presented for the evolved parton densities at the end of section “Basic tools, Monte Carlo solutions” and also in sections “The programs and the results” and “Conclusion”, based on the numerically Monte Carlo algorithm. The results are in good agreement with the results of CTEQ and GRV parameterization groups. Finally, we give our conclusion in section  6.|$|E
40|$|Aiming at {{difficulties}} in labeling {{caused by a}} large number of the samples, as well as uneven distribution of the samples in obstacle detection, a nonlinear active learning algorithm based on AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic) optimization is proposed. Calculation process of this algorithm <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>following.</b> Firstly the AUC optimization method is used to train the nonlinear classifier on the training set. Then all the unlabeled samples are classified with the trained classifier. Secondly all the classified samples are scored using the sample selection function based on AUC optimization, and then the best representative samples are selected according to the scores. Finally these samples are labeled by the expert based on the images and location in the image, and then all the labeled samples are put in the training set. The above process is repeated until the AUC converges. Experiments are performed in outdoor environment image database. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can significantly reduce the workload of labeling the samples, and can solve the problem of the sub-optimal solution caused by the uneven sample distribution. The performance is also better than the other active learning algorithms...|$|E
