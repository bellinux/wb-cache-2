40|$|The U. S. Bureau of Mines {{conducted}} {{experiments on}} electrowinning of neodymium metal {{by using a}} molten-metal cathode at 65020 C and an electrolyte of 50 mol pct NdCl 3 (neodymium chloride) and 50 mol pct <b>KCI</b> (<b>potassium</b> <b>chloride).</b> The molten-metal cathodes were alloys of magnesium and zinc or magnesium and cadmium. Current efficiencies were 90 pct with a Mg-Zn cathode and 80 pct with a Mg-Cd cathode; The Mg-Cd cathode was easily separated from the electrolyte. In contrast, the Mg-Zn cathode tended to mix with the electrolyte, making separation difficult. The cathode metals were separated from the neodymium by distillation at 1, 10020 C under a vacuum of 10 - 3 torr. Neodymium metal of 99. 9 + purity was recovered from the Mg-Cd alloy cathode after 30 min distillation time. The neodymium recovered from the Mg-Zn system contained almost 2 pct Zn after vacuum distillation. Continuous operation using the Mg-Cd alloy cathode was demonstrated...|$|E

40|$|Potassium-magnesium citrate versus <b>potassium</b> <b>chloride</b> in thiazide-induced hypokalemia. BackgroundThe {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the value of potassium-magnesium citrate (KMgCit) with <b>potassium</b> <b>chloride</b> in {{overcoming}} thiazide-induced hypokalemia. MethodsSixty normal subjects first took hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ; 50 mg/day). After three weeks of treatment (or earlier if hypokalemia developed), they were randomized to take KMgCit (42 mEq K, 21 mEq Mg, and 63 mEq citrate/day) or <b>potassium</b> <b>chloride</b> (42 mEq/day) for three weeks while continuing on HCTZ. ResultsKMgCit significantly increased the serum potassium concentration from 3. 42 ± 0. 30 mEq/L on HCTZ alone to about 3. 8 mEq/L (P < 0. 001). <b>Potassium</b> <b>chloride</b> produced a similar increase in serum potassium concentration from 3. 45 ± 0. 44 mEq/L to about 3. 8 mEq/L (P < 0. 001). KMgCit significantly increased the serum magnesium concentration by 0. 11 to 0. 12 mEq/L (P < 0. 01), whereas <b>potassium</b> <b>chloride</b> produced a marginal decline or no significant change. KMgCit was less effective than <b>potassium</b> <b>chloride</b> in correcting HCTZ-induced hypochloridemia and hyperbicarbonatemia. KMgCit, but not <b>potassium</b> <b>chloride,</b> significantly increased urinarypH (by about 0. 6 unit), citrate (by about 260 mg/day), and urinary magnesium. ConclusionsKMgCit is equally effective as <b>potassium</b> <b>chloride</b> in correcting thiazide-induced hypokalemia. In addition, KMgCit, but not <b>potassium</b> <b>chloride,</b> produces a small but significant increase in serum magnesium concentration by delivering a magnesium load, and it confers alkalinizing and citraturic actions...|$|R

25|$|To {{secure a}} supply of rock salt the factory founders Vorster and Grüneberg {{acquired}} an salt mine in Staßfurt near Magdeburg.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{chlorides}} on NADP-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase from Halobacterium salinarium were investigated. The enzyme is stabilized by <b>potassium</b> <b>chloride</b> and sodium chloride and {{this effect is}} discussed {{in relation to the}} Hill (1913) equation. Kinetics of the enzyme were studied within a range of concentrations of <b>potassium</b> <b>chloride</b> and sodium chloride. Apparent Michaelis constants for both substrates were affected by salt concentration, the effect being greater in sodium <b>chloride</b> than in <b>potassium</b> <b>chloride.</b> Minimal apparent Michaelis constants for both substrates were similar to the corresponding constants reported for yeast isocitrate dehydrogenase. Vmax. was maximal in each salt at a concentration of about 1 m. The maximum was higher in sodium <b>chloride</b> than in <b>potassium</b> <b>chloride.</b> At salt concentrations above about 2. 3 m, the apparent Vmax. was lower in sodium <b>chloride</b> than in <b>potassium</b> <b>chloride,</b> and at salt concentrations below 0. 75 – 1. 0 m, each salt behaved as a linear activator of the enzyme. Within this concentration range salt and NADP+ acted competitively; the activation by salt was overcome at finite concentrations of NADP+. At concentrations above about 1 m, <b>potassium</b> <b>chloride</b> was a linear non-competitive inhibitor of the enzyme. Within the range 1. 0 – 2. 5 m, sodium chloride was also a linear non-competitive inhibitor, but above 2. 5 m it caused more pronounced inhibition...|$|R
