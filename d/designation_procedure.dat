The plan normally requires the BLM to consider the impacts to private property, non-motorized recreation opportunity, and natural resources before establishing off-road areas. The adopted West Mojave plan amendment was found to have violated the BLM's own manual of regulations, the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA) and the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA). The ruling was considered a success for a coalition of conservation groups, including the California Native Plant Society, Friends of Juniper Flats, the Alliance for Responsible Recreation, Community Off-Road Vehicle Watch, The Center for Biological Diversity, Sierra Club, and The Wilderness Society, who together initiated the legal challenge in late 2006.|$|R

40|$|From a {{due process}} perspective, the {{essential}} {{problem with the}} UN Security Council's targeted sanctions regime is the persistent lack of sufficient access to confidential material relied upon for the designation of targeted individuals.

Therefore, this article proposes to decentralize the regime's <b>designation</b> <b>procedure,</b> to mitigate the problem of being unable to challenge or review confidential information and evidence, which underlies an individual's designation. Such an amendment would entail that the designation of a particular individual and the possible subsequent judicial review procedure would take place domestically, prior to a universal blacklisting by the UN Sanctions Committee. As a consequence, any confidential material relied upon could stay within the designating state, and would be shared only with courts and possibly special security-cleared advocates, within that domestic legal order. This would make it more acceptable for the relevant authorities to make such information available...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2014 In 2006, U. S. President G. W. Bush drew {{upon the}} Antiquities Act of 1906 to {{establish}} Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument (PMNM) via Presidential Proclamations 8031 / 8112. The Marianas Trench (MTMNM) and Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monuments (PRIMNM) {{were created in}} 2009 thru the same process, representing a relatively new approach to establishing large-scale Marine Protected Areas (MPA) in the U. S. Although the Antiquities Act approach can facilitate rapid establishment of new MPA, it may not incorporate the procedures that, by law, must precede other forms of protected area designation, such as management planning requirements. To characterize the effects of using the Antiquities Act to designate PMNM, MTMNM, and PRIMNM, this study assessed a series of monument characteristics, including current status of management planning. A final management plan was implemented for PMNM within three years of designation, likely attributable to extensive planning efforts incidentally completed prior to Proclamation 8031. Neither MTMNM nor PRIMNM was able to draw from similar pre-designation preparations and, perhaps as a result, planning at those sites continues, nearly six years after establishment. Combining the Antiquities Act approach with more conventional MPA <b>designation</b> <b>procedures,</b> integrating planning products with Proclamation language reflecting site-specific requirements, should enhance monument effectiveness, while allowing a U.

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{universal}} designated verifier signatures {{was introduced by}} Steinfeld, Bull, Wang and Pieprzyk at Asiacrypt 2003. These signatures {{can be used as}} standard publicly verifiable digital signatures but have an additional functionality which allows any holder of a signature to designate the signature to any desired verifier. This designated verifier can check that the message was indeed signed, but is unable to convince anyone else of this fact. We propose new efficient constructions for pairing-based short signatures. Our first scheme is based on Boneh-Boyen signatures and its security can be analyzed in the standard security model. We prove its resistance to forgery assuming the hardness of the so-called strong Diffie-Hellman problem, under the knowledge-of-exponent assumption. The second scheme is compatible with the Boneh-Lynn-Shacham signatures and is proven unforgeable, in the random oracle model, under the assumption that the computational bilinear Diffie-Hellman problem is untractable. Both schemes are designed for devices with constrained computation capabilities since the signing and the <b>designation</b> <b>procedure</b> are pairing-free. Finally, we present extensions of these schemes in the multi-user setting proposed by Desmedt in 2003. Comment: 23 page...|$|E
40|$|Hong Kong {{has carried}} out {{heritage}} conservation {{since the late}} 1970 s based on the Antiquities & Monuments Ordinance of 1976, but protecting individual buildings has been the main focus. This is a fragmented way to conserving tangible heritage and is neither to {{the best interest of}} the building nor to the visitor experience. Designating a street as historical is common in countries such Britain, Canada and the United States. However, they normally conserve the area as a whole rather than a single street. For example, Cleveland Street in London, England, is listed but it is treated as an “Conservation Area” rather than a “conservation street”. As designating streets as heritage is not new to these countries. It is, however, a quite new concept to Hong Kong. 2009 marked the first time in Hong King’s history that streets were listed as Grade I built heritage, namely Pottinger Street and Ladder Street. Both are in the Central district. Is it a good way to conserving a street by just designating it as a heritage, but segregating it from its context? What other support measures are required to have it be really conserved? This dissertation focuses on whether it works as conservation by designating a street as a built heritage without including its context. The scope covers one case-study street, Ladder Street in Sheung Wan, and tracks the changes of the area after its Grade I listing in December 2009. Ladder Street is one of the earliest streets constructed in Hong Kong. It is not only a “built heritage” in itself, it also cuts across several streets featuring other “built heritage,” such as Man Mo Temple, YMCA and the Hong Kong Museum of Medical Sciences building. This study will attempt to evaluate if it is appropriate to designate a street. The main objective of this research is to review the Hong Kong experience in conserving built heritage, the <b>designation</b> <b>procedure</b> in Hong Kong, the reasons of designating Ladder Street, the impact on the streetscape and its implications in Hong Kong. Overseas example will be examined and their applicability in the Hong Kong context will be discussed. Ultimately, possible areas for further investigation will be identified. published_or_final_versionConservationMasterMaster of Science in Conservatio...|$|E

40|$|A well chosen, {{comprehensive}} set of kernel primitives {{is essential}} for the construction of higher levels of a computer's operating system. In particular, although many solutions to the classical operating system problems of interprocess synchronization and communication have been proposed in the past, difficulties with destination naming and language construct symmetry have continued to mar most proposed solutions. This thesis proposes a set of primitives, the Rendezvous primitives, that form the kernel of an operating system. It is argued that the Rendezvous primitives constitute a reasonable and practical set of operations on which to base an operating system. The Rendezvous primitive itself is presented as a solution to the interprocess synchronization and communication problems. A rendezvous occurs when two processes synchronize and subsequently exchange messages. Rendezvous is symmetric, in that processes that wish to communicate both use the same primitive; and processes invoke Rendezvous with class <b>designations,</b> not <b>procedure</b> names. Rendezvous is presented {{within the context of the}} other primitives, which support the restriction of access to Rendezvous, process creation and destruction, process scheduling, and stack resource management. A comparison of Rendezvous and existing primitives and language constructs to solve interprocess synchronization and communication is made. The full syntax and semantics of the Rendezvous primitives are presented, along with a discussion of their design rationale. The Crossbar Switch, a generalized virtual device interconnection and reconfiguration scheme, is presented as an example of the use to which the Rendezvous primitives might be put. A high level program description of the Crossbar Switch is presented as well. The thesis concludes with a description of the implementation of the Rendezvous kernel on a DEC PDP 11 / 60.

(2) Do they use information about risk-adjusted mortality rates (RAMR) {{provided in the}} New York State Cardiac Surgery Reports? DATA SOURCES: (1) Telephone interviews with and contracting data from the majority of MCOs licensed in NYS; (2) RAMR, quality outlier <b>designation,</b> and <b>procedure</b> volume for all cardiac surgeons, {{as reported in the}} Cardiac Surgery Reports. STUDY DESIGN: Interview data were analyzed in conjunction with patterns revealed by contracting data. Null hypotheses that MCOs' contracting choices were random with respect to the information published in the Cardiac Surgery Reports were tested. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Sixty percent of MCOs ranked the quality of surgeons as most important in their contracting considerations. Although 64 percent of MCOs indicated some knowledge of the NYS Cardiac Surgery Reports, only 20 percent indicated that the reports were a major factor in their contracting decision. Analyses of actual contracting patterns show that in aggregate, the hypothesis of random choice could be rejected with respect to high-quality outlier status and high procedure volume but not for RAMR or poor-quality outlier status. The panel composition of the majority of MCOs (80. 2 percent) was within two standard deviations of the expected mean under the null hypothesis. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a professed preference for high-quality surgeons, the use of publicly available quality reports by MCOs is currently low, and contracting practices for the majority of MCOs do not indicate a systematic selection either for or against surgeons based on their reported mortality scores. This study suggests that policy initiatives to increase the effective use of report cards should be encouraged...|$|R

The aforementioned legislation allows for the utilization of Simplified Acquisition Procedures for all commercial item designated goods and services up to and including $ 5 million. The legislation was passed in order to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of Federal contracting processes. However, based on informal review of the business decision protocol at many acquisition and contracting centers, {{and as a result of}} similar research conducted in the Fall of 2004, contracting activities may not be effectively utilizing the legislative authority to garner efficiencies and effective service provision that may be possible under the new legislation.

This study assesses the cost effectiveness of injections administered in a routine outpatient setting in England. Methods Patients attending the Nottingham University Hospitals’ Pain Clinic received two injections of methylprednisolone plus levobupivacaine at different dosages, separated by at least 12 [*]weeks. Prior to each injection, and every week thereafter for 12 [*]weeks, participants completed the EQ- 5 D health-related quality of life instrument. For each patient for each injection, total health state utility gain relative to baseline was calculated. The cost of the procedure was modelled from observed clinical practice. Cost effectiveness was calculated as procedure cost relative to utility gain. Results 39 patients provided records. Over a 13 -week period commencing with injection, mean quality adjusted life year (QALY) gains per patient for the two dosages were 0. 028 (SD 0. 063) and 0. 021 (SD 0. 057). The difference in QALYs gained by dosage was insignificant (paired t-test, CIs - 0. 019 – 0. 033). Based on modelled resource use and data from other studies, the mean cost of an injection was estimated at £ 219 (SD 83). The cost utility ratio of the two injections amounted to £ 8, 975 per QALY gained (CIs 5, 480 – 22, 915).

The SA 246 b was evaluated as described in Subpart D at a wind speed of 8 km h^- 1 with two adjustments: an aerosol particle sizer and testing times were specifically scheduled to meet minimum signal requirements. Measured and corrected data showed that particles with diameters of 20 and 25 micrometers had non-trivial penetration of 5. 7 % and 3. 5 %, respectively. A lognormal curve was found to be most descriptive of the collected data (p-value of 0. 686). The Subpart D mass concentration analysis yielded a concentration of 152. 694 ?g m^- 3 which was within 10 % of the ideal concentration value, 143. 889 ?g m^- 3. When the empirical SA 246 b lognormal performance curve was applied to the PSDs for several different rural PM sources, the mass concentration values for those sources were between 10 % and 34 % greater than that of the Subpart D ideal mass concentration. It was determined that the impact of large particle penetration was non-trivial and dependent upon the PSD of the PM being sampled. A low volume total suspended particulate (LVTSP) inlet developed at Texas A&M University was evaluated in the Subpart D wind tunnel in an effort to fully characterize the true performance of the inlet. The inlet was evaluated at wind speeds of 2, 8, and 24 km h^- 1 according to the procedures of Subpart D and the experimental additions employed during the SA 246 b testing. It was determined that piecewise models were more descriptive across all three wind speeds (p-values were greater than 0. 84). Data collected in the wind tunnel was shown to be wind speed dependent and no further analysis of inlet performance was conducted. It was concluded that further analysis of the wind tunnel at the wind speeds of two and 24 km h^- 1 need to be conducted before further studies could be reliable. Computational fluid dynamics was used to analyze the performance of the impactor section (the lower section) of the SA 246 b FRM PM 10 inlet for the particle sizes listed in Subpart D. The CFD for the impactor assembly produced a cutpoint of 14. 79 micrometers and a performance slope of 1. 19 resulting in a 34. 88 % higher mass concentration for CFD results than the ideal Subpart D inlet mass concentration. This result is outside the 10 % difference allowed. It was concluded that the characterization of the inlet must include the aspirator as well as the impactor section as the aspirator assembly also has sampling performance characteristics...|$|R
