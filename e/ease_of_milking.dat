40|$|The progeny {{groups of}} {{different}} sires varied widely in white-cell count in milk, even after exclusion of all cows which had suffered from mastitis. The sire had a demonstrable effect on white-cell count in milk, {{especially during the}} second half of lactation. Heritability estimates of white-cell count in milk showed that values for the fourth lactation were higher than those for heifers. But at the end of lactation heritability values for 4 th lactation cows and heifers were nearly equal (about 0. 40). The daughter groups with high average white-cell counts mostly showed frequent mastitis. There was a high phenotypic and genetic correlation between clinical mastitis and white-cell count. Within seasons for cows which, so far known, had never mastitis, very high and very low producers had higher white-cell counts than other cows. White-cell counts increased remarkably with advancing lactation. A relation between white-cell count and <b>ease</b> <b>of</b> <b>milking</b> could not be demonstrated. Increasing milking vacuum over 40 cm mercury pressure, especially at the end of lactation, or increasing pulsation to over 50 per min. tended to increase white-cells. Milking routine (man/machine ratio) affected white-cell count in the end of lactation. More cows per milker increased the number of white-cells...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays {{there is}} an {{increasing}} interest in camel's milk for human nutrition due to its functional properties. As a result of market demands for milk production, intensive dairy camel's farms using modern machine milking have been recently estabilished around the world. Efficient milking {{are related to the}} good milking ability of animal (machine milked). Camels should be chosen with good udder and teat conformations because of its direct effects on <b>ease</b> <b>of</b> <b>milking</b> and milk hygiene. There are a huge variation in size of teats (length and diameter) between camels. These variations might cause some problems during machine milking and require special settings and practice during milking. Therefore, the necessity to design specific milking clusters for lactating camels, with longer and wider cups than dairy cows. Milking camels at 50 kPa and 60 pulsations/min improved milking efficiency without affecting teat condition and udder health; camels were able to let down more milk in a shorter time at higher milk flow rate. Compared to other dairy animals, camels have a very limited cisternal cavity. Therefore, insufficient udder and teat stimulation will lead to incomplete milking. It is recommended to extend the duration of udder and teat stimulation (90 to 120 sec) before milking. Further studies are needed to confirm these results during the entire lactation period.

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was performed in}} primiparous dairy cows (n = 23) to examine consistency of individual differences in reactivity to milking, and correlations between measures of behavior, physiology, and milk ejection. Responsiveness to milking was monitored during the first machine milking, on d 2 of lactation, and during milkings on d 4 and 130 of lactation. Measurements included kicking and stepping behavior, plasma cortisol and plasma oxytocin, heart rate, milk yield, milking time, milk flow rate, and residual milk obtained after administration of exogenous oxytocin. With repeated early lactation milkings, residual milk and the incidence <b>of</b> abnormal <b>milk</b> flow curves decreased. On d 130 of lactation all heifers exhibited normal milk ejection. Except for higher plasma cortisol concentrations on d 2, all measures were consistent over time between d 2 and 4 of lactation as indicated by significant rank correlations. Individual differences in the behavioral response to udder preparation were consistent over time between early lactation milkings and d 130 <b>of</b> lactation. Residual <b>milk,</b> milk yield, maximum milk flow rate, plasma oxytocin and heart rate during udder preparation were similarly interrelated on d 2 and 4 of lactation. High heart rate responses on d 2 and 4 were associated with enhanced inhibition <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> ejection. In contrast, behavior recorded during the milking process was unrelated to <b>ease</b> <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> removal. Our results indicate that milking {{at the beginning of}} lactation may be stressful to some heifers, to the extent that milk ejection is inhibited, but less disturbing to others. The existence of consistent behavioral and physiological responses in the present study suggests that responsiveness of dairy heifers to milking is mediated by stable animal characteristics...|$|R

40|$|Various {{aspects of}} the <b>ease</b> <b>of</b> <b>milking</b> {{of more than a}} {{thousand}} cows were studied with a Gascoigne individual-quarter milking machine (pulsation ratio 3 : 1, pulsation rate 60 cycles per minute). Progeny groups from 17 bulls used in artificial insemination (420 heifers) were recorded twice and 75 cows on 9 different farms were tested on 16 occasions during lactation. Wide variation existed in peak flow (x = 2. 13,σ= 0. 70, C. V. = 33 %) and average flow (x = 1. 70,σ= 0. 58, C. V. = 34 %). From paternal half-sib correlations, high heritability estimates of 0. 65 ± 0. 11 and 0. 56 ± 0. 10 were found for these features. Selection on peak flow could be especially effective. An accurate progeny test could be based on a sample of 25 daughters, while individual cows (bull dams) could be tested very accurately with 4 test milkings (repeatability 0. 7). A correction for a standard milk yield of 7 kg was necessary for comparison. There was a sufficient variation in percentage milk in fore quarters x = 43. 5,σ= 6. 05, but heritability was lower (0. 26 ± 0. 28). No significant correlation was found with peak flow, machine time and quantity of stripping. Selection on this character was of minor importance. The average stripping yield by hand was 361 ml with wide variation, but very low heritability (0. 12 ± 0. 24). Selection on this character was almost impossible...|$|E

40|$|The {{principal}} aims of {{the work}} presented in this thesis were to further investigate the pathophysiology of the acute phase proteins in bovine mastitis and to document {{the changes in the}} protein composition <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> during mastitis using modem proteomic methods. Mastitis {{is one of the most}} important diseases affecting cattle worldwide. It has adverse effects on the economics <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> production through reducing the quality and quantity <b>of</b> <b>milk.</b> Acute phase proteins (APPs) are valuable markers of inflammatory lesions and are widely used in the veterinary field for disease diagnosis. This study further investigated the presence of APPs, haptoglobin (Hp) 1 I and mammary- associated serum amyloid A 3 (M-SAA 3) in the <b>milk</b> <b>of</b> cows with mastitis and evaluated the possibility of using these proteins to detect mastitis. An Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed and validated for the measurement <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> Hp. A commercially available ELISA was used for the detection ofM-SAA 3 in milk. Both Hp and M-SAA 3 showed similar kinetics to somatic cell counts and can be considered as sensitive and reliable markers of mastitis. Advanced proteomic methods were developed and used to further characterise the changes taking place in the proteins expressed in normal and mastitic milk. The methodology for analysis <b>of</b> the bovine <b>milk</b> proteome was successfully established. This part of the work concluded that the patterns of protein expression <b>of</b> clinically mastitic <b>milk</b> showed clear differences from that <b>of</b> normal <b>milk.</b> Further analysis <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> samples from a mild subclinical model of Staphylococcus aureus mastitis showed that alterations to the milk p:oteome were only minimal. However this study was useful in identifying areas worthy of future research. Recent publications on APP research speculate upon the local production ofM-SAA 3 in the bovine mammary gland. The final objective of this study was therefore to investigate the expression of MSAA 3 in bovine mammary tissue. Our studies confirm the local production of M-SAA 3 in the bovine mammary gland and its up-regulation during bovine mastitis. This finding may provide further information on a possible role for this protein. Overall the findings detailed in this thesis indicate that APPs in milk are valuable markers of mastitis and additionally that the <b>ease</b> <b>of</b> collection <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> by non-invasive methods suggest that milk has potential for the discovery of disease biomarkers. ...|$|R

So, murmuring the Lord's Prayer as he walked, and making the resolution not to be dragged away from his trust in the cavern, nor to forsake his little sister--he heard the lowing of the cows as he went over the hill, and found them standing at the gate of the fold yard, waiting to be <b>eased</b> <b>of</b> their <b>milk.</b> Poor creatures, they seemed so glad to welcome him that it was the first thing that brought tears to his eyes, and they came with such a rush that he had much ado to keep them from dropping into the pail as he leant his head against Croppie's ruddy side.|$|R

40|$|All too often, the {{attention}} dairy farmers give to rearing their young stock declines markedly after weaning. The weight of heifers at mating has effects on <b>ease</b> <b>of</b> calving, subsequent <b>milk</b> production and their longevity in the milking herd. For example, calving 2 year old Friesian heifers at 550 kg compared to 450 kg liveweight {{can reduce the}} time between calving and conception in their first lactation by 17 days and should increase lifetime milk yields by about 2300 L. In year-round calving herds, better feeding of young stock can reduce age at first calving, which also increases lifetime productivity. Despite the higher costs involved in improved heifer management systems, computer studies have shown it to be profitable to rear heifers to heavier pre-calving liveweights and/or younger ages at first calving. This review summarises {{much of the information}} generated from Australian studies, then describes many of the current systems of heifer management, highlighting some of their shortcomings and suggesting where improvements could be made. The costs of rearing heifer replacements are briefly discussed together with the economic benefits of better rearing systems.

40|$|Abstract: The high {{sensitivity}} of ultrasonic parameters to composition and state <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> and other liquid food products is now well established. Multiple informative ultrasonic parameters can be measured: sound velocity and acoustic impedance, {{as well as}} their temperature slope, which are sensitive to compressibility, density, and hydrophobicity of the sample; and ultrasonic absorption and reflection, {{as well as their}} frequency slope, which are sensitive to size of the particles and to relaxation processes due to energy losses, aggregation, or conformational transitions. The first application of ultrasound for quality control <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> started about 50 years ago in evaluation of fat content. Currently available commercial ultrasonic devices include measurements of the acoustic properties <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> at different temperatures and therefore require waiting for temperature equilibration <b>of</b> the <b>milk</b> when the sample is heated or cooled and cannot be used for real-time monitoring. In this paper an ultrasonic analyzer that uses radially oscillating PZT piezoceramic tubes, and is applied for monitoring of fat globules, solid-non-fat (SNF), and protein <b>of</b> raw <b>milk</b> in cowsheds is described. This device employs high-intensity standing waves for preliminary separation of the fat globules and SNF by the acoustic radiation forces and employs low-intensity standing waves for compositional analysis. A device based on standing cylindrical waves is far superior to other ultrasonic instrumentation in respect to industrial requirements such as cost, precision, and <b>ease</b> <b>of</b> use in flow-through systems. Preliminary testing of the analyzer was carried out on milk samples from five cows milked twice a day for one month. More than 300 samples <b>of</b> the raw <b>milk</b> were tested.

40|$|Foaming can be {{beneficial}} or undesirable {{depending on the}} temperature at/to which milk is foamed. For instance, foaming <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> is beneficial when making Italian style coffee such as cappuccino where steam from a steam generator is injected into milk to create a foam and to simultaneously heat the milk to ~ 65  70 °C. Foaming <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> is undesirable during operations such as pumping of cold (5 °C) milk in a dairy processing plant. The main objective {{of this study was}} to develop an understanding of the foaming patterns <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> and the factors that affect the foaming properties in the temperature range 5  85 °C and use this understanding to devise treatments and additives to improve/reduce the foaming <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> depending on the end stage application. A review of literature showed that very little information was available on the foaming properties <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> as a function of temperature. Moreover a clear gap existed between an understanding of the foaming properties <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> proteins in single or binary systems and the foaming properties <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> per se. Foaming properties <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> over a broad temperature range were studied using a specially designed foaming apparatus, which enabled foams to be produced under standardised conditions. Foaming patterns of a range <b>of</b> <b>milks</b> which included raw whole milk, pasteurised homogenised full-cream milk, pasteurised skim milk, UHT homogenised full-cream milk, UHT skim milk and reconstituted milks made from low-, medium- and high-heat skim milk powder, were established as a function of temperature (5  85 °C). The foaming properties <b>of</b> a given <b>milk</b> were largely determined by the temperature at which milk was foamed, its fat content, and the processing conditions used during its manufacture. Skim milks had a pronounced foam stability peak at 45 °C when foamed over a temperature range of 5  85 °C. Image analysis <b>of</b> skim <b>milk</b> foams, as observed under a light microscope, showed that the surface <b>of</b> skim <b>milk</b> foams coarsened over time. This occurred most rapidly in foams produced at 5 °C and least rapidly in those produced at 45 °C. The foaming properties <b>of</b> full-cream <b>milks</b> were largely determined by the physical state <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> fat. Milk fat was detrimental to foam formation and stability <b>of</b> full-cream <b>milks</b> when milk fat globules contained both solid and liquid fat i. e. in the temperature range 5  40 °C. The extent of whey protein denaturation had a positive effect on the foam stability <b>of</b> reconstituted <b>milks</b> at lower temperatures (< 45 °C) and a negative correlation with foam stability at higher temperatures When skim milk was separated into its micellar, ultracentrifugal and defatted ultracentrifugal fractions, the foaming pattern <b>of</b> the parent <b>milk</b> as a function of temperature (5  85 °C), resembled that of the micellar fraction, with a pronounced foam stability peak at 45 °C. The foaming pattern of the serum phase <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> could not be determined due to precipitation of calcium, when the defatted ultracentrifugal supernatant was heated to temperatures G 45 °C. The sedimentable interfacial material isolated by low-speed centrifugation <b>of</b> collapsed skim <b>milk</b> foams was made up of large-sized casein micelles; particle size measurements and electrophoretic analysis of this material showed that the stability <b>of</b> skim <b>milk</b> foams was mainly determined by the ability of micellar caseins to adsorb and form a stabilising network at the air serum interface of the foams. Addition of calcium-chelating agents, which increased the non-micellar casein content <b>of</b> <b>milk,</b> decreased foam stability, while addition of calcium salts, which increased the micellar casein content <b>of</b> <b>milk,</b> increased foam stability, reinforcing the observation that adsorption of micellar caseins is required for the stability <b>of</b> skim <b>milk</b> foams. The role of whey proteins in the stabilisation <b>of</b> skim <b>milk</b> foams could not be determined from a study of the sedimentable interfacial material, as they were lost in the supernatant during low speed centrifugation <b>of</b> skim <b>milk</b> foams. Lipolysis as measured by the FFA content <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> had a negative effect on the steam foaming properties <b>of</b> <b>milk,</b> with foamability and foam stability decreasing and the coarseness of foam increasing with an increase in the FFA content. The destabilising effect of the products of lipolysis was higher when milk was foamed at lower temperatures. A good correlation was observed between surface tension, FFA content and foam stability <b>of</b> <b>milk.</b> However, natural variations in other surface active components <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> such as fat, protein and phospholipids, tend to mask the effect of changing FFA content on the surface tension value <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> and as a result it was difficult to arrive at an absolute surface tension value <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> below which foaming properties <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> were adversely affected. Increasing the total solids content <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> decreased foamability and increased foam stability due to an increase in the viscosity coupled with an increase in the amount of protein available for adsorption at the airserum interface <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> foams. As in the case of increasing total solids content, addition of H-carrageenan decreased foamability and increased the foam stability <b>of</b> <b>milk,</b> due to an increase in viscosity <b>of</b> the <b>milk.</b> Emulsification <b>of</b> oils such as olive, canola and sunflower oils in skim milk using a microfluidiser resulted in a pronounced increase in the foam stability <b>of</b> <b>milk.</b> The foaming patterns <b>of</b> <b>milks</b> containing oil instead <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> fat resembled that <b>of</b> skim <b>milk</b> with a pronounced foam stability peak at 45 °C. This suggested that lipids which are fully liquid above 0 °C are not detrimental to the foaming properties <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> foamed in the temperature range 5  85 °C. The higher foam stability <b>of</b> <b>milks</b> containing added oil, when compared to the parent skim milk, was attributed to an increase in the viscosity <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> as a result of the added oil. Pre-heat treatment <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> to temperatures G 65 °C altered the foaming properties <b>of</b> <b>milk.</b> The foamability <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> increased with an increase in the temperature of preheat treatment from 65 to 85 °C, while the foam stability was highest when milk was subjected to a pre-heat treatment of 65 °C. Lowering of the measurable FFA content <b>of</b> <b>milk,</b> by the likely binding of FFA to BSA and I-lactoglobulin, and the lack of whey protein denaturation, could be responsible for the higher foam stability <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> subjected to a pre-heat treatment of 65 °C. The present study represents a significant step forward in understanding the foaming behavior <b>of</b> <b>milk,</b> which is determined by the complex interplay between temperature, the structure, conformation and distribution <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> proteins, and the nature of other components <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> such as fat, mineral salts and FFAs. An understanding of the importance of caseins in the stabilisation <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> foams and the effect of the physical state <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> fat on the foaming properties <b>of</b> <b>milk,</b> achieved in the present study, opens up exciting avenues for the manipulation of the foaming behavior <b>of</b> <b>milk,</b> especially to produce specialty milks with improved foaming properties...|$|R

40|$|The study {{conducted}} during 1994 - 95 in Jalgaon and Kolhapur districts of Maharashtra showed two differing scenarios {{insofar as the}} impact <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> cooperatives on production and marketed surplus is concerned. While milk cooperatives had positive and significant impact on both production and marketed surplus <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> in Kolhapur district, such impact could not be ascertained in Jalgaon district. The study also showed lower production and marketed surplus during summer season followed by rainy and winter seasons. However, the percentage marketed surplus was the highest in summer season followed by winter and rainy seasons. The higher percentage of marketed surplus in summer season was due to lower milk production, higher demand and higher prices offered by various agencies compared to other seasons. On an average, nearly three-fourths <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> produced was sold in extension and two-thirds in control area of both the selected districts. However, this proportion differed in different seasons and herd size categories. An analysis drawn from Marketed Surplus Function (MSF) also showed that total milk production in the household was the single most significant factor contributing to marketed surplus <b>of</b> <b>milk.</b> The next important variable positively affecting the marketed surplus <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> was the education level {{of the head of}} the household, particularly in control area of both the districts. Further, the negative impact of family size on the marketed surplus <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> could be ascertained only in Kolhapur district. In general, price <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> had very little influence on the marketed surplus <b>of</b> <b>milk.</b> Relatively small variation in price <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> within a season {{could be one of the}} reasons for lack of impact of price on marketed surplus <b>of</b> <b>milk.</b> Since in the short run there was no possibility <b>of</b> increasing <b>milk</b> production despite variation in prices, the MSF did not show significant influence of prices on marketed surplus <b>of</b> <b>milk.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{elaborated}} a detailed {{review of literature}} to illuminate the importance <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> recording in breeds of dairy cows, which illustrates the benefits <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> recording for breeders. The emergence <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> recording in the Czech Republic dates back to 1905, when it began milk recording {{carried out by the}} Danish model. From the beginning <b>of</b> the <b>milk</b> recording was not met with such great success. Over time, the importance <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> recording in the Czech Republic grew. Patronage over milk recording over the years was taken by the International Committee for Animal Recording (ICAR), which includes the Czech Republic since 1992. The milk recording in the Czech Republic is performed using several methods. Official method A and unofficial methods B and F, wherein the method A is divided into A 4 -P, A 4 -A and A 4 -T. Milk recording in the Czech Republic is performed only properly educated personnel, who takes sample in individual farms. After sampling, the samples are transported and subsequently processed in laboratories for analysis <b>of</b> <b>milk.</b> Results <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> recording are important for the monetization <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> and breeding organization. The results of many years of breeding work, the main base are just the results <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> recording, were the reduction cows and increase milk production. Only the number of cows in lactation period from the year 2005 to 2014 fell by 50, 636 dairy cows. To reduce dairy cows occurred precisely because <b>of</b> the increasing <b>milk</b> production. Larger quantities <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> milked from each cow meant that {{there was no need for}} such a large amount <b>of</b> dairy cattle. <b>Milk</b> production from 2005 to 2014 increased on average by 1, 477 kg, which is the result of breeding work. Importance <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> recording is currently mainly breeding again. Results <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> recording are used to select animals and to organize and manage the herd. Results of performance tests are also used in numerous researches...|$|R

40|$|The {{gravimetric}} method {{is considered the}} gold standard for measuring the fat content <b>of</b> human <b>milk.</b> However, it is labor intensive and requires large volumes <b>of</b> human <b>milk.</b> Other methods, such as creamatocrit and esterified fatty acid assay (EFA), have also been used widely in fat analysis. However, these methods have not been compared concurrently with the {{gravimetric method}}. Comparison of the three methods was conducted with human <b>milk</b> <b>of</b> varying fat content. Correlations between these methods were high (r(2) = 0. 99). Statistical differences (P < 0. 001) were observed in the overall fat measurements and within each group (low, medium and high fat milk) using the three methods. Overall, stronger correlation with lower mean (4. 73 g/L) and percentage differences (5. 16 %) was observed with the creamatocrit than the EFA method when compared to the gravimetric method. Furthermore, the <b>ease</b> <b>of</b> operation and real-time analysis make the creamatocrit method preferable...|$|R
25|$|As an {{agricultural}} product, milk is extracted from non-human mammals during or soon after pregnancy. Dairy farms produced about 730 million tonnes <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> in 2011, from 260 million dairy cows. India is the world's largest producer <b>of</b> <b>milk,</b> {{and is the}} leading exporter <b>of</b> skimmed <b>milk</b> powder, yet it exports few other milk products. The ever increasing rise in domestic demand for dairy products and a large demand-supply gap could lead to India being a net importer of dairy products in the future. The United States, India, China and Brazil are the world's largest exporters <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> and milk products.
