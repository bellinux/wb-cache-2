40|$|Background: There is {{a paucity}} of {{population-based}} data on ocular morbidity globally. The objectives {{of the current study}} were to estimate the prevalence and magnitude of eye disorders and to determine the ophthalmic subspecialty requirements for the population of Sokoto state, Nigeria. The information generated may provide baseline data for planning of a comprehensive eye health services in the state. Materials and Methods: During an all-ages population based blindness survey in December 2005, persons selected through a multi-stage random sampling were examined for any ocular disorder using a magnifying loupe, penlight and a direct ophthalmoscope. Data was entered and analyzed by a statistician. Statistical tests were carried out using Epi <b>info</b> 6 software (<b>Centre</b> for disease control [CDC] Atlanta, Georgia). Results: A total of 4848 persons were examined which gave a response rate of 91 %. A total of 943 persons of the sample had an eye disorder in at least 1 eye, giving an ocular morbidity prevalence of 19 %. Children aged 0 - 9 years constituted the highest proportion (37. 5 %) of the examined subjects. About 57 % of the study population were males. Disorders affecting the lens (9. 34 %) were the most common followed by conjunctival lesions (5. 49 %). The most common diagnosis was lens opacity (8. 1 %) followed by conjunctivitis (5. 2 %). The most common subspecialty requirements in the population are cataract microsurgery (41. 7 %), and cornea/anterior segment (33 %). Conclusion: Our data demonstrates high burden of ocular diseases most of which are either preventable or treatable in the study population. We recommend provision of human resource and technology requirements to meet these demands...|$|R
