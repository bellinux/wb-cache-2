500|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the dehors theory is based on detective drafting of the Wills Act. In particular, whilst the term [...] "will" [...] is commonly used to refer to a specific document, the WIlls Act is designed to cover almost all documents except rules on public trust and secret trust that are to take effect after the testator's death. Indeed, the formality requirements of the Wills Act created the need for a set of prima facie documents, like the one commonly referred to. Therefore, to refer to an arrangement as dehor the Wills Act because it is not a prima facie reference to the document is incorrect. The response has been to view the secret trust as a disposition inter vivos ("between the living") rather than testamentary under exception. Although the testator is unlikely to consider the trust having come into existence {{at the time of the}} will upon his death, whether a disposition is arguably though less convincingly regarded as an inter vivos is a question for the courts as well as parliament. However, other types of inter vivos trust are incapable of binding after-acquired property or operating so as to, whether automatically, semi-automatically or no automatism at all, bind such property as and when it is received. No separate <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> is required in the case of property acquired after the execution of a will for it to form part of a secret trust. Looking at the definition of a [...] "testamentary disposition" [...] and [...] "inter vivo trust" [...] as applied in other sorts of cases is inconclusive.|$|E
500|$|... 53(1)(b) of the Law of Property Act 1925 {{requires}} that [...] "a <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> respecting any land or any interest therein must be manifested and proved by some writing signed by some {{person who is}} able to declare such trust or by his will". section 53(1)(a) said [...] "no interest in land can be created or disposed of except by writing signed by the person creating or conveying the same, or by his agent thereunto lawfully authorised in writing, or by will, or by operation of law". [...] Two cases, [...] Re Baillie and Ottaway v Norman, have concerned secret trusts over land. In neither case the formality requirements are said to be neglected, but neither judgment expressly considered why 53(1)(a) and 53(1)(b) made an impact that an prima facie express trust could be set up. This has been used to be an argument that secret trusts are constructive but in light of both cases it appears not. However, an express trust may still be exempted from the requirements of 53(1)(a) and 53(1)(b) by a separate application of the equitable maxim [...] "equity will not allow a statute {{to be used as a}} cloak for fraud" [...] the fraud would be for the trustee to deny the existence of the secret trust, but this time the statute concerned would be the Law of Property Act, a line of reasoning dependent upon the case of Rochefoucauld v Boustead. Also, the correct interpretation of secret trust in light of [...] "au dehor" [...] theory strongly affirms that the secret trust can operate outside the Law of Property Act and still be an express trust.|$|E

2500|$|Resulting trusts in English law are trusts created where {{property}} is not properly disposed of.

As such, the courts assign the property to somebody in a resulting trust to avoid this becoming an issue.

5000|$|TRUST ESTATE AS BUSINESS COMPANIES. A {{practice}} {{originating in}} Massachusetts of vesting a business or certain {{real estate in}} a group of trustees, who manage it {{for the benefit of the}} beneficial owners; the ownership of the latter is evidenced by negotiable (or transferable) shares. The trustees are elected by the shareholders, or in case of a vacancy, by the board of trustees. Provision is made in the agreement and <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> the <b>trust</b> to the effect that when new trustees are elected, the trust estate shall vest in them without further conveyance. The <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> the <b>trust</b> specifies the power of the trustees.

2500|$|However, {{the courts}} have had {{difficulty}} in defining appropriate principles for cases where trusts are declared over property that many people have an interest in. This is especially true where the person who possesses that property has gone insolvent. In Re Kayford Ltd a mail order business went insolvent and customers who had paid for goods wanted their money back. Megarry J held that because Kayford Ltd had put its money in a separate account the money was held on trust, and so the customers were not unsecured creditors. By contrast in Re London Wine Co (Shippers) Ltd Oliver J held that customers who had bought wine bottles were not entitled to take their wine because no particular bottles had been identified for a trust to arise. A similar view was expressed by the Privy Council in Re Goldcorp Exchange Ltd, where the customers of an insolvent gold bullion reserve business {{were told that they}} never had been given particular gold bars, and so were unsecured creditors. These decisions were said to be motivated by the desire to not undermine the statutory priority system in insolvency, although it is not entirely clear why those policy reasons extended to consumers who are usually seen as [...] "non-adjusting" [...] creditors. However, in the leading Court of Appeal decision, Hunter v Moss, there was no insolvency issue. There, Moss had declared himself to be a trustee of 50 out of 950 shares he held in a company, and Hunter sought to enforce this declaration. Dillon LJ held that it did not matter that the 50 particular shares had not been identified or isolated, and they were held on trust. The same result was reached, however, in an insolvency decision by Neuberger J in the High Court, called Re Harvard Securities Ltd, where clients of a brokerage company were held to have had an equitable property interest in share capital held for them as a nominee. The view that appears to have been adopted is that if assets are [...] "fungible" [...] (i.e. swapping them with other will not make much difference) a <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> can be made, so long as the purpose of the statutory priority rules in insolvency are not compromised.|$|E
2500|$|Although trusts do not, generally, {{require any}} {{formality}} to be established, formality {{may be required}} in order to transfer property the settlor wishes to entrust. There are six particular situations which have returned to the cases: (1) transfers of company shares require registration, (2) trusts and transfers of land require writing and registration, (3) transfers (or [...] "dispositions") of an equitable interest require writing, (4) wills require writing and witnesses, (5) gifts that are only to be transferred in the future require deeds, and (6) bank cheques usually need to be endorsed with a signature. The modern view of formal requirements is that their purpose is to ensure the transferring party has genuinely intended to carry out the transaction. As the American lawyer, Lon Fuller, put it the purpose is to provide [...] "channels for the legally effective expression of intention", particularly where there's a common danger in large transactions that people could rush into it without thinking. However, older case law saw the courts interpreting the requirements of form very rigidly. In an 1862 case, Milroy v Lord, a man named Thomas Medley signed a deed for Samuel Lord to hold 50 Bank of Louisiana shares on trust for his niece, Eleanor Milroy. But the Court of Appeal in Chancery held that this did not create a trust (and nor was any gift effective) because the shares had not finally been registered. Similarly, in an 1865 case, Jones v Lock, Lord Cottenham LC held that because a £900 cheque was not endorsed, it could not be counted as being held on trust for his son. This was so even though the father had said [...] "I give this to baby... I am going to put it away for him... he may do what he likes with it" [...] and locked it in a safe. However, the more modern view, starting with Re Rose was that if the transferor had taken sufficient steps to demonstrate their intention for property to be entrusted, then this was enough. Here, Eric Rose had filled out forms to transfer company shares to his wife, and three months later this was entered into the company share register. The Court of Appeal held, however, that in equity the transfer took place when the forms were completed. In Mascall v Mascall (1984) the Court of Appeal held that, when a father filled out a deed and certificate for the transfer of land, although the transfer had not actually been lodged with HM Land Registry, in equity it the transfer was irrevocable. The trend was confirmed by the Privy Council in T Choithram International SA v Pagarani (2000), where a wealthy man publicly declared he would donate a large sum of money to a charitable foundation he had set up, but died before any transfer of the money took place. Although a gift, which is not transferred, was traditionally thought to require a deed to be enforced, the Privy Council advised this was not necessary as the property was already vested in him as a trustee, and his intentions were clear. In the case of [...] "secret trusts", where someone has written a will but also privately told the executor that they wished to donate their some part of their property in other ways, this has long been held to not contravene the Wills Act 1837 requirements for writing, because it simply works as a <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> before the will. The modern trend, then, has been that so long as the purpose of the formality rules will not be undermined, the courts will not hold trusts invalid.|$|E

5000|$|Although {{the formal}} {{steps of a}} contract, {{conveyance}} and registration will allow people to acquire legal interests in land, {{over the course of}} the twentieth century Parliament, and the courts, slowly recognised that many people have legitimate claims to property, even without following formalities, and even without gaining the consent of a property owner. The institution <b>of</b> a <b>trust</b> has come to play a major role, particularly in family homes, because according to the Law of Property Act 1925 section 53, while <b>declarations</b> <b>of</b> express <b>trusts</b> require signed writing to take effect, resulting and constructive trusts do not. A [...] "resulting" [...] trust is typically recognised when a person has given property to a person without the intention to benefit that person, so the property jumps back to the person it came from. [...] "Constructive" [...] trusts have been recognised by English courts in about eight unrelated circumstances, whenever it is said it would be [...] "unconscionable" [...] that the courts did not recognise properly belonged to the claimant. In the context of family homes, these two types <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> allowed judges to recognise, from around 1970, a spouse's proprietary right in a home because of the contribution (broadly speaking) to home life. Parliament had enacted the same reform already as a part of family law. In the Matrimonial Proceedings and Property Act 1970 section 37, [...] "where a husband or wife contributes in money or money's worth" [...] to improve property, a court could recognise an equitable right in it, but also vary the amount to the extent it was deemed just. And under the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 section 24, a court was empowered in divorce proceedings to vary the property rights of the parties, especially for the benefit of children, to the extent that was just. In the Civil Partnership Act 2004 sections 65 to 72 and Schedules 5-7 achieved the same for civil partners.|$|R

The full text may be found via Westlaw UK ([URL] with a valid subscription. The ageing English population is likely to generate increased demand for social care, which “supports people of all ages with certain physical, cognitive or age-related conditions in carrying out personal care or domestic routines”. Local authorities can seek contributions from capable individuals towards the direct costs of social care by assessing relevant capital and income, which “can give rise to heated social and political debate about the scope of the ‘Welfare State’ and the extent to which it was expected to provide free care from the cradle to the grave. ” The Care Act 2014 sought, inter alia, to limit the amount that one person can be expected to contribute towards his or her lifetime care costs, albeit that a £ 72, 000 cap due in April 2016 has been delayed until April 2020. Despite the Care Act’s reforms, many individuals will be expected to contribute a significant sum towards care costs once its funding provisions have fully commenced, even if such costs are ultimately borne by their estates after death. While the threshold below which means-tested help is provided was to increase to £ 118, 000 from £ 23, 250 in April 2016, there were a number of significant limitations on the cap’s effect even before the delay was announced. This continuing potential liability is likely to lead to attempts to shield assets, including via <b>declarations</b> <b>of</b> <b>trust,</b> from local authorities in order to provide for dependants and others (including informal carers) who would have a legitimate claim to the care recipient’s estate. This article’s aim is to evaluate the Care Act 2014 ’s anti-avoidance provisions, particularly whether the Act achieves an adequate balance between ensuring that the costs of necessary care are equitably distributed and protecting the property-related interests of care recipients and those who would otherwise be the beneficial recipients of their assets. It includes an analysis of those provisions in light of similar mechanisms in other areas of the law applicable to individuals in a familial context. Whatever the inherent difficulties in a doctrinal legal scholar’s questioning the structure and funding model of a social care system, this article will argue that the anti-avoidance provisions in the Care Act 2014 are very broadly drawn, and that the Act over-relies on discretion and statutory guidance to ensure that local authorities exercise anti-avoidance powers in a nuanced manner. It demonstrates that incorporating care fee avoidance into financial planning risks being both ineffectual and expensive...|$|R
