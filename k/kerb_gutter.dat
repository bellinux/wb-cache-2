50|$|Mary Watson's {{monument}} {{is situated}} {{at the corner of}} Adelaide and Charlotte Streets, Cooktown, {{on the edge of the}} Charlotte Street footpath abutting the road, a little south of, and on the same side of the street as, the Cook Shire Council Chambers. It straddles the stone <b>kerbing</b> and <b>guttering</b> of Charlotte Street, and lacks a formal setting.|$|R
50|$|The {{remnants}} of street furniture, that is street signs, fire hydrants and footpath lighting {{and other elements}} including <b>kerbs</b> and <b>gutters</b> and examples of brick drains, are valued for their contribution to the aesthetic of a twentieth-century 'Garden City' planned subdivision. The furniture of the Garden City precincts (Blandfordia 4 and 5 and the Forrest Housing precincts) is now protected.|$|R
5000|$|Bluestone {{was also}} used {{extensively}} as cobblestone, and for <b>kerbs</b> and <b>gutters,</b> many examples which still exist in some of Melbourne's smaller city lanes and 19th Century inner suburban lanes. Crushed bluestone aggregate, known as [...] "blue metal" [...] (or [...] "bluemetal"), is still used extensively in Victoria as railway ballast, road base, and, combined with bitumen, as road surfacing material, {{as well as in}} concrete making.|$|R
40|$|Darwin City {{is a small}} {{tropical}} city {{situated in}} the Northern Territory. The City Council population is 75852 covering approximately 70 square kilometres. Within this area there is an extensive network of civil infrastructure. One major task of Council is to maintain these assets at a service level satisfactory to the community. To do this {{there needs to be}} understanding of what the assets are, the service levels they are required to meet and their current condition. This project explores the ways to optimise the current processes and to create more efficient programs that integrate multiple assets where possible. The assets to be focussed on are road surface and pavement, <b>kerb</b> and <b>gutter,</b> footpaths and driveways. There are many opportunities to optimise the way in which surveys are carried out and programs created for infrastructure assets at DCC. Surveys are carried out every four years on roads, driveways and footpaths, with <b>kerb</b> and <b>gutter</b> not being inspected. Currently only road surface and footpaths are programmed with the program duration being four years for footpaths and ten years for road surfaces, which is updated with new data input. There are three outcomes to be addressed in this project, they are; - Develop existing asset maintenance plans for roads, <b>kerb</b> & <b>gutter,</b> footpaths and driveways, - Investigate and comment on the current levels of service, and - Improve the condition survey programs to ensure all relevant information is collected on all asset. The programs for all assets have been developed for the 2009 / 10 financial year works as much as possible. The recommendations and processes discussed will be used to further optimise the programs at Darwin City Counci...|$|R
40|$|Recycling is {{the act of}} {{processing}} the used material for use in creating new product. The usage of natural aggregate is {{getting more and more}} intense with the advanced development in infrastructure re area. In order to reduce the usage of natural aggregate, recycled aggregate can be used as the replacement materials. Recycled aggregate are comprised of crushed, graded inorganic particles processed from the materials that have been used in the constructions and demolition debris. These materials are generally from buildings, roads, bridges, and sometimes even from catastrophes, such as wars and earthquakes. Traditionally, the application of recycled aggregate is used as landfill. Nowadays, the applications ons of recycled aggregate in construction areas are wide. The applications are different from country to country. Recycled aggregate have been used as concrete <b>kerb</b> and <b>gutter</b> mix in Australia. According to Building Innovation & Construction Technology (19 (1999), 99), Stone says that the 10 mm recycled aggregate and blended recycled sand are used for concrete <b>kerb</b> and <b>gutter</b> mix in the Lent hall Street project in Sydney. The major advantage is based on the environmental gain...|$|R
50|$|All {{roads are}} modern {{bituminised}} surfaces with white and yellow line markings. All roads are kerbed and channelled with either concrete or porphyry stone {{blocks in the}} <b>kerbing,</b> and concreted <b>gutters.</b> The road reserves include the footpaths which consist {{of a range of}} surfacing materials including brick paving, concrete and bitumen.|$|R
50|$|In 1885 public {{subscription}} {{was called for}} a drinking-fountain memorial to Mary Watson, and this was erected with the co-operation of the Cooktown Municipal Council in 1886 {{at a cost of}} £165. The memorial was unveiled in February 1886 by Mayor John Davis. It was erected just outside the grounds of the town hall, straddling the stone <b>kerbing</b> and <b>guttering</b> in Charlotte Street. The monument is the work of monumental mason Ernest Greenway of Ipswich, who won the design competition. However, there was later some question over who authorised Greenway to include the name of Edward D'Arcy as the mayor in 1886.|$|R
50|$|The {{township}} {{is located}} on the north bank of the Palmer River near the junction of Butcher's Creek. The area contains a high concentration of building surfaces and footings. Some street alignments are discernible and one street contains carefully laid stone <b>kerbing</b> and <b>gutters.</b> Dominant structural remains include a brick baker's oven, timber uprights for the school, a Chinese temple site, and burnt timber stumps and corrugated iron sheets of the police station. A stone commemorative cairn and an (inaccurate) replica of a miner's hut have recently been constructed in the centre of the town site. The cemetery contains about 40 identifiable graves including 16 with headstones.|$|R
5000|$|From late 1889 {{until about}} 1895, {{there was a}} {{depression}} in Queensland. North Queensland suffered especially, due to a significant downturn in sugar production, and a drought, which peaked in 1889. This had a severe impact on the regional mining industry because the crushing mills needed water. Charters Towers and Croydon were affected and this had a flow-on effect for Burns Philp. Robert Philp had speculated on mining and real estate and had to sell his company shares and resign from the Board in 1893. It suffered a substantial decline in profitability, which in 1893 James Burns blamed on [...] "insane overstocking of Normanton five years ago" [...] with mining supplies. This included 300 pairs of bellows which {{are used in the}} dry-processing of gold. Despite the downturn, approval was given for the addition of a strongroom to the Normanton building, in late 1892. In January 1893 Burns Philp wrote to the Normanton Municipal Council requesting <b>kerb</b> and <b>gutter</b> be installed adjoining their store on Landsborough and Caroline Streets. The tender of £24 from local contractors Copeland and Cant for stone and concrete kerbing was accepted in February. It was installed ten feet past the side entrance to the Burns Philp store in Landsborough Street and {{to the end of the}} veranda in Caroline Street. The Council then requested the installation of spouting and gutters on the Burns Philp store. The cast iron gutter coves on the kerb were not tendered for at this time, and presumably were added later, reportedly manufactured at the Croydon foundry, operated by Messer's Stuart and Mackenzie between 1891 and 1912.|$|R
40|$|Up {{to three}} credit points are {{available}} {{for the use of}} slag products in concrete if the material cost of the concrete represents more than 1 % of the project’s contract value. Up to two points {{are available for}} the use of blast furnace slag as a SCM, while one point is awarded for the use of slag aggregates in concrete. The credit addresses all concrete uses including precast, cast in-situ or prestressed, and includes structural and non-structural uses such as paving, footpaths, <b>kerbs,</b> channels and <b>gutters.</b> Credit points are awarded on the following basis: •	 One	Point is available where the Portland cement content is reduced by 30 % (by replacement with a suitable quantity of GGBFS) compared to the reference case (presented in Table 1). •	 Two	Points are available where the Portland cement content is reduced by 40 % (by replacement with a suitable quantity of GGBFS) compared to the reference case in Table 1. •	 One	Point is available when at least 40 % of the coarse aggregate in the concrete is crushed slag aggregate, measured across all mixes in the project, provided that the use of Portland cement is not increased by more than 5 kg/ m 3. Credit points are awarded on the premise of Portland cement content reductions, rather than the quantity of ground slag used. 1...|$|R
