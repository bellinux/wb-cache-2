5|$|Although 85% {{of world}} crude {{production}} was still coming <b>from</b> <b>Pennsylvania</b> wells in the 1880s, drilling in Russia and Asia began {{to reach the}} world market.

However, Robert Morris, a Senator <b>from</b> <b>Pennsylvania,</b> convinced Congress to return to Philadelphia while the new permanent capital was being built.
