5|$|Black {{churches in}} Maryland hosted many musical, {{as well as}} {{political}} and educational, activities, and many African American musicians got their start performing in churches, including Anne Brown, Marian Anderson, Ethel Ennis and Cab Calloway, in the 20th century. Doctrinal disputes did not prevent musical cooperation, which included both sacred and secular music. Church choirs frequently worked together, even across denominational divides, and church-goers often visited other establishments to see visiting performers. Organists were a major part of African American church music <b>in</b> <b>Baltimore,</b> <b>and</b> some organists became well known, Baltimore's including Sherman Smith of Union Baptist, Luther Mitchell of Centennial Methodist and Julia Calloway of Sharon Baptist. Many churches also offered music education, beginning as early as the 1870s with St. Francis Academy.|$|E

5|$|On September 19, Tropical Storm Isabel {{passed through}} extreme western Maryland, though its large {{circulation}} produced tropical storm force winds throughout the state. About 1.24million people lost power throughout the state. The worst of its effects came from its storm surge, which inundated areas {{along the coast}} and resulted in severe beach erosion. On the Eastern Shore, hundreds of buildings were damaged or destroyed, primarily in Queen Anne's County from tidal flooding. Thousands of houses were affected in Central Maryland, with severe storm surge flooding reported <b>in</b> <b>Baltimore</b> <b>and</b> Annapolis. Washington, D.C., sustained moderate damage, primarily from the winds. Throughout Maryland and Washington, damage totaled about $945million (2003USD, ($ USD), with only one fatality due to flooding.|$|E

5|$|On {{his return}} to {{civilian}} life, Agnew resumed his legal studies, and secured {{a job as a}} law clerk with the Baltimore firm of Smith and Barrett. Until now, Agnew had been largely apolitical; his nominal allegiance had been to the Democratic Party, following his father's beliefs. The firm's senior partner, Lester Barrett, advised Agnew that if he wanted a career in politics he should become a Republican. There were already many ambitious young Democrats <b>in</b> <b>Baltimore</b> <b>and</b> its suburbs, whereas competent, personable Republicans were scarcer. Agnew took Barrett's advice; on moving with his wife and children to the Baltimore suburb of Lutherville in 1947, he registered as a Republican, though he did not immediately become involved in politics.|$|E
5|$|Sprigg {{was born}} in 1835 on his father's farm in Hampshire County, Virginia (present-day West Virginia). He was a {{descendant}} of English pioneer Thomas Cresap, a nephew of Maryland lawyer John Van Lear McMahon, and U.S. House Representatives James Sprigg, Michael Sprigg, and Clement Vallandigham. He studied jurisprudence <b>in</b> <b>Baltimore</b> <b>and</b> {{was admitted to the}} Maryland bar in 1858. Following a hiatus during the American Civil War, Sprigg relocated to Moorefield, West Virginia, in 1866 and established a law partnership with former judge J.W.F. Allen. That year, Sprigg was instrumental in organizing the Democratic Party of West Virginia.|$|E
5|$|After {{making her}} way across the Atlantic independently, Empire Wildebeeste arrived at Norfolk, Virginia, on 25 June. After making {{intermediate}} stops <b>in</b> <b>Baltimore</b> <b>and</b> Hampton Roads, she sailed for Halifax with a load of scrap iron on 17 July, reaching her destination three days later. She departed in convoy HX 140 on 22 July and arrived at Belfast Lough on 5 August and Newport on 8 August. After arriving at Milford Haven on 25 August, she sailed from there two days later in convoy ON 10 for Halifax, where she arrived on 13 September. From there, Empire Wildebeeste sailed to Montreal and back to Halifax by 5 October. She departed Halifax that same day {{as a part of}} convoy HX 153, but had unspecified problems that caused her to drop out and put in at St. John's, Newfoundland, on 11 October. After aborted attempts to sail east in convoys SC 50 and SC 52, Empire Wildebeeste finally reached Loch Ewe on 25 November as a part of convoy SC 54 and Methil on 30 November.|$|E

5|$|Besides the patrols {{made during}} this {{deployment}} in northwestern waters, Yorktown conducted routine operations such as target practices. Among the officers {{assigned to the}} ship {{at that time was}} Lt. Bradley Fiske, a young officer who had invented and constructed a practical telescopic gunsight. Fiske's sight had been tested <b>in</b> <b>Baltimore</b> <b>and</b> had favorably impressed that ship's officers—including her commander, Captain Winfeld S. Schley. Evans, however, had not taken a liking to Fiske's newfangled gadget but nevertheless consented to allow a second test on board Yorktown (the first one had failed miserably). On the afternoon of 22 September 1892, during scheduled target practice, Fiske's invention worked as designed and elicited praise from Evans. As Fiske himself later wrote in the United States Naval Institute's magazine Proceedings, modern naval gunnery had its birth not in the British Navy but in the American—off Unalaska on 22 September 1892, in Yorktown.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{existence}} or upcoming construction of two divided highway corridors between Baltimore and Annapolis, a freeway connecting I-695 and US 50 was proposed {{as early as}} 1956 {{in the form of}} the Arundel Expressway, which would relieve congestion on MD 2. The portion of the Arundel Expressway that is today MD 10 was constructed from I-695 to MD 648 in Pasadena between 1970 and 1978. MD 10 was proposed to continued south of Pasadena as a toll road to US 50, but the section of the freeway south of MD 100 was removed from state plans by 1975. MD 10 was completed to its present end in Pasadena in 1991. The state of Maryland unsuccessfully petitioned the Federal Highway Administration for an Interstate designation for a Baltimore–Annapolis freeway after passage of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1968. However, the state was successful in obtaining Interstate mileage for the Baltimore–Annapolis corridor through the 1968 Howard–Cramer amendment, which provided for minor adjustments to the Interstate System if no additional costs were incurred. Much of the mileage of what became I-97 was reallocated from canceled Interstate Highways <b>in</b> <b>Baltimore</b> <b>and</b> the Washington area.|$|E
5|$|MD7 {{is the old}} {{alignment}} of US40 in northeastern Maryland. The route was first laid out early in colonial times and later formed part of the post road between Baltimore and Philadelphia and between {{the northern and southern}} colonies. The highway <b>in</b> <b>Baltimore</b> <b>and</b> Harford counties became a turnpike in the 19th century. The Maryland State Roads Commission marked portions of {{what became known as the}} Philadelphia Road close to Baltimore and between Perryville and Elkton for improvement as state roads in 1909. Those sections and the highway between Aberdeen and Havre de Grace were constructed as modern roads in the early to mid-1910s. The remainder of the highway was constructed in the 1920s and designated US40 in 1927. The high volume of traffic and the required continuous expansion of the highway led the Maryland State Roads Commission to construct the modern Pulaski Highway between 1935 and 1941. Old sections of US40 became segments of MD7 between 1938 and 1941 as portions of the new four-lane divided highway opened from Baltimore to Elkton.|$|E

5|$|On October 10, 1973, Agnew {{appeared}} before the federal court <b>in</b> <b>Baltimore,</b> <b>and</b> pled no contest to one felony charge, tax evasion, for the year 1967. Richardson agreed {{that there would be}} no further prosecution of Agnew, and released a 40-page summary of the evidence. Agnew was fined $10,000 and placed on three years' unsupervised probation. At the same time, he submitted a formal letter of resignation to the Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, and sent a letter to Nixon stating he was resigning in the best interest of the nation. Nixon responded with a letter concurring that the resignation was necessary to avoid a lengthy period of division and uncertainty, and applauding Agnew for his patriotism and dedication to the welfare of the US. House Minority Leader Gerald Ford, who would be Agnew's successor as vice president (and Nixon's as president) recalled that he heard the news while on the House floor and his first reaction was disbelief, his second sadness.|$|E
5|$|The 2005 {{game was}} played at the M Bank Stadium <b>in</b> <b>Baltimore</b> <b>and</b> {{attended}} by 67,809 fans. The game was a close contest marked by costly Maryland turnovers and Navy penalties. A Sam Hollenbach interception helped Navy to end the first quarter with a 14–3 lead. Immediately before halftime, Maryland kicked a field goal and another third-quarter field goal narrowed the deficit to 14–9. Both Maryland and Navy rushed for touchdowns and failed to make two-point conversions in the final quarter. Maryland took over on their own 18-yard line after the Navy kick, trailing 20–15 with 4:37 left on the clock. Hollenbach then engineered a 12-play, 82-yard drive capped by an 11-yard touchdown pass and a two-point conversion. Navy took over with one minute left, and completed a first down on their 33-yard line before an interception sealed the game for the Terps 23–20.|$|E
5|$|The {{first major}} congressional debate in which Rowan participated {{was over the}} {{election}} of William McCreery as representative from Baltimore, Maryland. Joshua Barney, McCreery's opponent in the election, claimed that McCreery did not meet a requirement in the Maryland Constitution that a representative live in the district from which he was elected for twelve {{months prior to the}} election. McCreery admitted that he had moved from Baltimore to the country prior to the election but claimed that he still owned his home <b>in</b> <b>Baltimore</b> <b>and</b> lived there during the winter months. A resolution was introduced to declare McCreery the duly elected representative from Baltimore, and an amendment was added to clarify that the grounds upon which the resolution was based were that McCreery had not abandoned his Baltimore home. Despite his support for states' rights, Rowan opposed the amendment because he felt that state sovereignty was only made possible by national sovereignty and that the national legislature had the right to declare a state law unconstitutional. By giving another reason for declaring McCreery duly elected, Rowan felt this issue would be obscured. The amendment was defeated by a vote of 92–8, and the resolution to declare McCreery duly elected passed 89–18.|$|E
