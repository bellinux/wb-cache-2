5|$|Many federal <b>groups</b> <b>at</b> 100 McAllister {{moved their}} offices in 1959–1960 {{to the newly}} built federal {{building}} at 450 Golden Gate Avenue, later named the Phillip Burton Federal Building. Occupancy at 100 McAllister was low, though the United States Army Corps of Engineers moved their San Francisco District offices there in the 1960s, and local draftees were still required to appear there through the late 1960s. The San Francisco Selective Service System offices were located in the lower floors of the building during the Vietnam War.|$|E

50|$|Pupils are {{allocated}} to institutionally separate school types, {{according to their}} performance levels. The structure {{is based on the}} principle of equal capacities among pupils. Generally, each school type has its own adapted curricula, teaching material, teachers and, in some cases, its own range of subjects. In general, there are 2 to 3 school types (4 in a minority of cantons), the names of which vary. In the structure with 2 school types, a distinction is made between the performance-based <b>group</b> <b>at</b> basic level (with the least demanding requirements), and the performance-based <b>group</b> <b>at</b> advanced level. In the structure with 3 school types, there is a performance-based <b>group</b> <b>at</b> basic level, a performance-based <b>group</b> <b>at</b> intermediate level and a performance-based <b>group</b> <b>at</b> advanced level. The requirements of the performance-based <b>group</b> <b>at</b> advanced level are the most demanding and this school type generally prepares pupils for transfer to the matura schools.|$|R

5|$|When {{the search}} for {{survivors}} ended, authorities closed Salta Street. Engineers began checking the buildings at ground zero, trying to restore the original layout {{of the street and}} demolishing unstable structures. Secretary of Public Works Omar Saab said that the two remaining buildings were beyond repair and had to be demolished. As a sign of respect, the demolition would not be carried out with explosives. Secretary of Housing Gustavo Leone estimated that the work would take nearly six months. People were allowed to enter their destroyed houses in small <b>groups</b> <b>at</b> a time, starting on August 9. Nearby streets began to be reopened on August 13.|$|E

40|$|A 1 -ended finitely {{presented}} {{group has}} semistable fundamental <b>group</b> <b>at</b> ∞ if it acts geometrically on some (equivalently any) simply connected and locally finite complex X with the property that any two proper rays in X are properly homotopic. If G has semistable fundamental <b>group</b> <b>at</b> ∞ then one can unambiguously define the fundamental <b>group</b> <b>at</b> ∞ for G. The problem, asking if all finitely presented groups have semistable fundamental <b>group</b> <b>at</b> ∞ {{has been studied}} for over 40 years. If G is an ascending HNN extension of a finitely presented group then indeed, G has semistable fundamental <b>group</b> <b>at</b> ∞, but since the early 1980 's {{it has been suggested}} that the finitely presented groups that are ascending HNN extensions of finitely generated groups may include a group with non-semistable fundamental <b>group</b> <b>at</b> ∞. Ascending HNN extensions naturally break into two classes, those with bounded depth and those with unbounded depth. Our main theorem shows that bounded depth finitely presented ascending HNN extensions of finitely generated groups have semistable fundamental <b>group</b> <b>at</b> ∞. Semistability is equivalent to two weaker asymptotic conditions on the group holding simultaneously. We show one of these conditions holds for all ascending HNN extensions, regardless of depth. We give a technique for constructing ascending HNN extensions with unbounded depth. This work focuses attention on a class of groups that may contain a group with non-semistable fundamental <b>group</b> <b>at</b> ∞. Comment: 27 pages 1 figur...|$|R
5|$|After {{the fall}} of Diệm and the {{execution}} of Cẩn in May 1964, the VNQDD became more active in their strongholds in central Vietnam. Nevertheless, there was no coherent national leadership and <b>groups</b> <b>at</b> district and provincial level tended to operate autonomously. By 1965, their members had managed to infiltrate and take over the Peoples Action Teams (PATs), irregular paramilitary counter-insurgency forces organised by Australian Army advisers to fight the communists, and used them for their own purposes. In December, one VNQDD member had managed to turn his PAT colleagues towards the nationalist agenda, and the local party leadership in Quảng Nam approached the Australians {{in an attempt to}} have the 1000-man PAT outfit formally allied to the VNQDD. The overture was rejected. The politicisation of paramilitary units worked both ways; some province chiefs used the anti-communist forces to assassinate political opponents, including VNQDD members.|$|E
5|$|Childhood {{was brief}} and perilous, {{even more so}} for girls than boys. Parents would {{celebrate}} {{the birth of a}} boy twice as much and there is some evidence of female infanticide (i.e. roadside abandonment and suffocation), though it was contrary to both civil and canon law. Educational opportunities for girls were few: they did not attend regular schools but were taught in <b>groups</b> <b>at</b> home by tutors. With few exceptions, education was limited to literacy and the Bible; a famous exception is the princess Anna Komnene (1083–1153), whose Alexiad displays a great depth of erudition, and the renowned 9th century Byzantine poet and composer Kassiani. The majority of a young girl's daily life would be spent in household and agrarian chores, preparing herself for marriage.|$|E
5|$|Fordham College at Rose Hill has a {{long history}} of college theater, as well as non-major theater <b>groups</b> <b>at</b> both Lincoln Center and Rose Hill (the Mimes and Mummers, Fordham Experimental Theater, the Theatrical Outreach Group, Splinter Group). There are also choirs (University Choir, Schola Cantorum, Gloria Dei Choir) and a cappella groups {{spanning}} both campuses (Fordham Ramblers, Satin Dolls, b-Sides, Hot Notes, F-sharps). The Mimes and Mummers, the oldest entirely student-run club at Fordham University and among the oldest college theater groups in the United States, was founded in 1855 as the Saint John's Dramatic Society. The Mimes put on two musicals, a drama, and a comedy each year – all non-student-written shows – as well as workshops designed to help students at Fordham learn about theater. The club receives from the school a budget which allows the hiring of professional directors, music directors, and choreographers but the shows are student produced, with all elements of technical design run by the club's executive board.|$|E

5|$|Heartland Food Corporation (Heartland) {{came into}} {{existence}} when Miami-based franchisee Al Cabrera purchased {{a large chunk of}} stores, 130 locations primarily in the Chicago and the upper mid-west, from the failed franchise AmeriKing for a bargain basement price of $16million, or approximately 88% of their original value in December 2003. Taking these stores, he and his partners created a new company called Core Value Partners to renovate and update the locations which had deteriorated during Ameriking's decline. During this time, the company was renamed Heartland Food Corp. and it purchased 120 additional stores from other financially distressed owners and completely revamped them as well. The resulting purchases made Mr. Cabrerra Burger King's largest minority franchisee and Heartland one of BKC's top franchisee <b>groups</b> <b>at</b> the time. By 2006, the company was valued at over $150million, and was sold to New York-based GSO Capital Partners.|$|E
5|$|In June 1893, {{when the}} Australasian Federal League was formed {{at a meeting}} in the Sydney Town Hall, Garran joined {{immediately}} and was made a member of the executive committee.
