40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with the determination of two critical constitutive properties for mass transport of ions through porous electrodes saturated with a liquid electrolyte solution. One is the effective diffusivity that is required to model the mass transport at the representative element volume (REV) level of porous electrodes in the framework of Darcy's law, while the other is the pore-level mass-transfer coefficient for modeling the mass transport from the REV level to the solid surfaces of pores induced by redox reactions. Based on the theoretical framework of mass transport through the electrodes of vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs), unique experimental setups for electrochemically determining the two transport properties by measuring limiting current densities are devised. The effective diffusivity and the pore-level mass-transfer coefficient through the porous electrode made of graphite felt, a typical material for VRFB electrodes, are measured at different <b>electrolyte</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates.</b> The correlation equations, respectively, for the effective diffusivity and the pore-level mass-transfer coefficient are finally proposed based on the experimental data...|$|R

40|$|As a key {{component}} of flow batteries, the flow field is to distribute electrolytes and to apply/collect electric current to/from cells. The critical issue of the flow field design is how to minimize the mass transport polarization at a minimum pressure drop. In this work a three-dimensional numerical model is proposed and applied to the study of flow field designs for a vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB). The performance of three VRFBs with no flow field and with serpentine and parallel flow fields is numerically tested. Results show that when a flow field is included a reduction in overpotentials depends not only on whether a flow field can ensure a more even distribution of electrolytes over the electrode surface, but also on whether the flow field can facilitate the transport of <b>electrolytes</b> from the <b>flow</b> field towards the membrane, improving the distribution uniformity in the through-plane direction. It is also shown that the pumping power varies with the selection of flow fields at a given <b>flow</b> <b>rate.</b> To assess the suitability of flow fields, a power-based efficiency, which takes account of both the cell performance and pumping power, is defined and calculated for different flow fields at different <b>electrolyte</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates.</b> Results indicate that there is an optimal <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> for each type of flow field at which the maximum efficiency can be achieved.

Besides the {{influence}} of the current density and <b>electrolyte</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate,</b> {{the influence of}} the titanium substrate pretreatment on the nucleation and growth of copper is emphasized. The 100 μm thick copper deposits give two different layers.

The structure of the layer in contact with the electrolyte is, on the contrary, mainly controlled by the electrodeposition parameters (current density and <b>electrolyte</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate)</b> and corresponds to a field oriented (FT) -UD type in this diagram.

40|$|A large {{renewable}} energy integration {{needs to be}} coupled with a low cost energy storage technology. One of the promising energy storage alternatives for the commercial market segment is the hydrogen bromine flow battery. Although the technology has been explored since 1980, {{the development of the}} hydrogen bromine flow battery system is still in the research phase due to the system complexity, the safety aspect, and technical problems. The literature review revealed that costs of the system and electricity are highly dependent on the system’s lifetime. The main problem is the chemicals crossover problem, which leads to catalyst blockages, decreasing performance and system failure. A cost-driven hydrogen flow battery needs to be developed with a simplified design and abundant materials and the development of the first working cell is an important milestone to achieve a cost competitive hydrogen bromine flow battery. In the experimental part, ex-situ experiments were done to select the most suitable membrane for a hydrogen bromine flow battery and in-situ experiments were done to develop the first working cell and to find the effect of operating parameters.

40|$|The {{conventional}} copper electrowinning process {{uses the}} water hydrolysis reaction as the anodic source of electrons. However this reaction generates acid mist and requires {{large quantities of}} energy. In order to improve energy efficiency and avoid acid mist, an alternative anodic reaction of ferrous ion oxidation has been proposed. This reaction does not involve evolution of acid mist and {{can be carried out}} at a lower cell voltage than the conventional process. However, because ferrous ions are converted to ferric ions at the anode in this process, {{there is a need for}} reduction of ferric ions to ferrous ions to continue this process. The most promising method for this reduction is the use of hydrogen gas since the resulting byproduct acid can be used elsewhere in the process and, unlike other reductants, hydrogen does not introduce other species that need subsequent removal. Because the hydrogen reduction technology has undergone only preliminary lab scale testing, additional research is needed to evaluate its commercial potential. Two issues for this research are the potentially low mass transfer rate of hydrogen into the electrolyte stream because of its low solubility in water, and whether other gaseous reductants less expensive than hydrogen, such as natural gas or syngas, might work. In this study various reductants were investigated to carry out the reduction of ferric ions to ferrous ions using a simulated electrolyte solution recycled through a trickle bed reactor packed with catalyst. The gases tested as reductants were hydrogen, methane, carbon monoxide, and a 50 / 50 mixture of H 2 and CO. Nitrogen was also tested as an inert control. These gases were tested because they are constituents in either natural gas or syngas. The catalysts tested were palladium and platinum. Two gas <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> and five <b>electrolyte</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> were tested. Pure hydrogen was an effective reductant of ferric ion.

The ferric iron reduction increased with both the <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> of gas as well as the liquid <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> (up to ~ 0. 1 g/L/min). Pure carbon monoxide also reduced the ferric ion, but at a rate about one tenth that of pure hydrogen at similar conditions. The syngas mixture of equimolar hydrogen and carbon monoxide reacted at a rate intermediate between each gas as a pure stream (up to ~ 0. 06 g/L/min). This gas mixture shows that some form of unpurified reformer gas could be used to reduce the ferric ion in the electrolyte solution.

40|$|The main {{factor that}} affects the {{performance}} of the arsenic removal from water is its oxidation state. It is known that As(III) is harder to be removed than As(V) {{due to the fact that}} H 3 AsO 3 is a nonionic compound with a pK 1 = 9. 22 while H 3 AsO 4 (As(V)) dissociates ready with a pK 1 = 2. 25. In the oxygen-poor environment like in groundwater, arsenic exists mainly as As(III). For the purpose of obtaining a higher degree of removal of arsenic from contaminated groundwater, it is necessary to oxidize the As(III) to As(V) prior to the other treatment processes. In this work an electrochemical reactor, having an anode made from reticulated vitreous carbon of 100 pores per inch (100 ppi), was used to oxidize As(III) to As(V), this eliminates the need of adding more chemical substances to the treatment system.

40|$|A {{series of}} carbon felts was {{examined}} by cyclic voltammetry to investigate their suitability as an electrode {{material for the}} all-vanadium redox flow battery. A commercially supplied vanadium electrolyte of unknown concentration was analysed by UV-visible spectroscopy and was shown to contain VO 2 + and V 3 + ions in a ratio of 4. 8 : 1 with a total vanadium concentration of 1. 5 mol dm- 3 in 4 mol dm- 3 H 2 SO 4. A unit laboratory redox flow battery (100 cm 2 membrane area) was assembled using carbon felts and planar carbon feeders as {{the positive and negative}} electrodes with a Nafion ® 115 proton exchange membrane. Its performance was examined using both 1. 5 mol dm- 3 and 1. 1 mol dm- 3 vanadium <b>electrolytes</b> at volumetric <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> in the range of 0. 5 to 3 cm 3 min- 1. At a vanadium concentration of 1. 1 mol dm- 3, a suitable volumetric <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> was found to be in the range 1. 5 – 2. 0 cm 3 min- 1. At a constant current density charge and discharge of 100 mA cm- 2 for 45 minute half-cycles (and < 30 cycles), the typical voltage efficiencies were 65 %...|$|R
