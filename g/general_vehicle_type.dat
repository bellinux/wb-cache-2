Aiming at the problems of great plice forces occupation, low retrieval efficiency, and lacking of intelligence for dealing with false license, fake plate vehicles and vehicles without plates, this paper proposes a <b>vehicle</b> <b>type</b> fine-grained recognition method based GoogleNet deep convolution neural networks.

40|$|Traditionally, {{economists and}} market {{researchers}} {{have been interested in}} identifying the factors that affect consumers' car buying behaviors to estimate market share, and to that end they have developed various models of <b>vehicle</b> <b>type</b> choice. However, they do not usually consider consumers' travel attitudes, personality, lifestyle, and mobility as factors that may affect the <b>vehicle</b> <b>type</b> choice. The {{purpose of this study is}} to explore the relationship of such factors to individuals' <b>vehicle</b> <b>type</b> choices, and to develop a disaggregate choice model of <b>vehicle</b> <b>type</b> based on these factors as well as typical demographic variables. The data for this study comes from a 1998 mail-out/mail-back survey of 1904 residents in the San Francisco Bay Area. The dependent variable (the <b>vehicle</b> <b>type</b> the respondent drives most often) is classified into nine categories: small, compact, mid-sized, large, luxury, sports, minivan/van, pickup, and sport utility vehicle. Based on these categories, we first related <b>vehicle</b> <b>type</b> to travel attitude, personality, lifestyle, mobility, and demographic variables individually, using one-way analysis of variance and chi-squared tests. Then, a multinomial logit model for <b>vehicle</b> <b>type</b> choice was estimated. The final model (which possessed the IIA property) confirmed that the variables analyzed significantly affect an individual's <b>vehicle</b> <b>type</b> choice. These results provide useful background not only to vehicle manufacturers, but also to decision makers and planners of transportation policy related to vehicle ownership, traffic congestion, and energy consumption.

A car or a truck {{is assumed to be}} a point without length.

40|$|Abstract In this thesis, {{models have}} been {{formulated}} and mathematical optimization methods developed for the heterogeneous vehicle routing problem with a very large set of available <b>vehicle</b> <b>types,</b> called many-hVRP. This {{is an extension of}} the standard heterogeneous vehicle routing problem (hVRP), in which typically fairly small sets of <b>vehicle</b> <b>types</b> are considered. Two mathematical models based on standard models for the hVRP have been formulated for the many-hVRP. Column generation and dynamic programming have been applied to both these models, following a successful algorithm for the hVRP. Benders' decomposition algorithm has also been applied to one of the models. In addition to the standard cost structure, where the cost of a pair of a vehicle and a route is determined by the length of the route and the <b>vehicle</b> <b>type,</b> we have studied costs that depend also on the load of the vehicle along the route. These load dependent costs were easily incorporated into the models, and other extensions could be similarly incorporated. By using a standard set of test instances (with between three and six <b>vehicle</b> <b>types</b> in each instance) {{we have been able to}} compare our implementation with published results for hVRP. For many-hVRP, we have extended these instances to include larger sets of <b>vehicle</b> <b>types</b> (with between 91 and 381 <b>vehicle</b> <b>types</b> in each instance). The results show that the algorithms implemented for the two models nd optimal solutions in a similar amount of time, but Benders' algorithm at times takes much longer to verify optimality. However, some other properties of Benders' algorithm suggests that it may constitute a good basis for a heuristic, when instances with even larger sets of <b>vehicle</b> <b>types</b> are used...|$|R

In this study, 13, 677 occupants traveling in four <b>vehicle</b> <b>types</b> (passenger cars, sport-utility vehicles, vans/minivans, and pickup trucks) were surveyed between September 1 and 16, 2005. Belt use was estimated for all commercial/noncommercial <b>vehicle</b> <b>types</b> combined (the statewide safety belt use rate) and separately for each <b>vehicle</b> <b>type.</b> The current survey was designed to provide data for comparison with surveys conducted in previous years.

Vehicle emission estimates included both exhaust and evaporative emissions for air pollutants of hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and air-toxic pollutants of benzene, formaldehyde, 1, 3 -butadiene, and acetaldehyde. Vehicle life-cycle cost estimates accounted for vehicle purchase prices, vehicle life, fuel costs, and vehicle maintenance costs. Emission control cost-effectiveness presented in dollars per ton of emission reduction was calculated for each alternative-fuel <b>vehicle</b> <b>type</b> from the estimated vehicle life-cycle emission reductions and costs.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{diversity of}} <b>vehicle</b> <b>type</b> holdings {{and the growing}} usage of vehicles by households have serious policy implications for traffic congestion and air pollution. Consequently, {{it is important to}} accurately predict the vehicle holdings of households as well as the vehicle miles of travel by <b>vehicle</b> <b>type</b> to project future traffic congestion and mobile source emission levels. In this paper, we apply a multiple discrete-continuous extreme value model to analyze the holdings and use of multiple <b>vehicle</b> <b>types</b> by households. Data for the analysis is drawn from a 2000 San Francisco Bay Area survey. The model results indicate the important effects of household demographics, residence location variables and vehicle attributes on <b>vehicle</b> <b>type</b> holdings and use.
