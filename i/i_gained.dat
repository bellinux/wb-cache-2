The Tiger {{was used for the}} first two seasons in the opening credits, in which Smart screeched to a halt outside his headquarters, and was used through the remainder of the series in several episodes. Some of the scenes featured unusual modifications such as a retractable James Bond-style machine gun that could not have fit under the Tiger's bonnet, so rebadged Alpine models were used instead.|$|E

The original capital was in the principality of Anegondi on the northern banks of the Tungabhadra River in today's Karnataka. It was later moved to nearby Vijayanagara on the river's southern banks during the reign of Bukka Raya I, because it was easier to defend against the Muslim armies persistently attacking it from the northern lands.|$|E

25|$|Ashurbanipal sent an army {{against them}} in 667 BC that {{defeated}} the Nubian king Taharqa, near Memphis, while Ashurbanipal stayed at his capital in Nineveh. At the same time some Egyptian vassals rebelled and were also defeated. All of the vanquished leaders save one were sent to Nineveh. Only Necho I, the native Egyptian Prince of Sais, convinced the Assyrians of his loyalty and {{was sent back to}} become the Assyrian puppet Pharaoh of Egypt. After the death of Taharqa in 664 BC his nephew and successor Tantamani invaded Upper Egypt and took control of Thebes. In Memphis he defeated the native Egyptian princes and Necho may have died in the battle. Another army was sent by Ashurbanipal and again it succeeded in defeating the Kushites/Nubians. Tantamani was routed and driven back to his homeland in Nubia and was never again to threaten Assyria or Egypt. The Assyrians plundered Thebes and took much booty home with them. How Assyrian rule in Egypt ended is not certain, but at some point Necho's son Psammetichus <b>I</b> <b>gained</b> independence while wisely keeping his relations with Assyria friendly.|$|E
40|$|Proportional and Integral (PI) {{controllers}} {{are used}} widely in HVAC applications. It {{is necessary to}} choose suitable values for PI gains for PI control of the heating and cooling coils in buildings. Consequently, suitable indoor comfort can be maintained; the energy efficiency of the heating and cooling systems will be maximized; and the lifetime of heating and cooling valves will be prolonged. A self-tuning algorithm is developed in this dissertation to find the good P and <b>I</b> <b>gains.</b> The proposed algorithm evaluates the controller performance by the integral square error (ISE) of the coil supply air temperature. The controller operation will be considered as not suitable when the ISE is too big. The P and <b>I</b> <b>gains</b> are required to change at this condition. The algorithm uses the ?iteration' concept to find better values for P and <b>I</b> <b>gains.</b> It first changes the P and <b>I</b> <b>gains</b> to certain values to decrease the ISE. The iteration then will stop if the ISE is small enough; otherwise the change of the P and <b>I</b> <b>gains</b> will continue until optimal values are found. Further, the new algorithm determines the iteration direction by observing the spectrum distribution of the ISE. P and <b>I</b> <b>gains</b> will be increased if the low frequency content is the dominant part in the coil supply air temperature; P and <b>I</b> <b>gains</b> will be decreased if high frequency content is the dominant part. The new algorithm can be realized on-line without interrupting the coil normal operation. It functions as a watchdog {{to be sure the}} PI controller maintains smooth and rapid tracking properties. The new algorithm only requires about forty lines of program code in the current Direct Digital Control (DOC) systems used for HVAC control. The basic concept of the algorithm will be developed by theoretically analyzing the dynamic behavior and frequency characteristics of the cooling and heating coils in buildings. The whole algorithm is then demonstrated by controlling a coil in a building, thus proving its feasibility...|$|R

500|$|The {{political}} and military balance in the region changed dramatically {{during the reign of}} Amut-piʾel II; Shamshi-Adad I had died by about 1775 BC, and his empire disintegrated, while Yasmah-Adad was removed from his throne and replaced with Zimri-Lim. Yarim-Lim <b>I</b> <b>gained</b> the upper hand and turned his kingdom into the supreme power in the Levant; Qatna was forced to respect the borders and interests of Yamhad. In Mari, Zimri-Lim, who was Yarim-Lim's [...] protégé, married Amut-piʾel II's sister and Yasmah-Adad's widow Dam-Ḫuraṣi, and this seemed to satisfy the king of Qatna, as his relations with Mari were never hostile. In 1772 BC, the Banu-Yamina tribes revolted against Zimri-Lim, who asked Qatna for help; Amut-piʾel II sent his troops to Dūr-Yahdun-Lim (probably modern Deir ez-Zor) to support Mari, but when he asked for Mariote military support at a later time, Zimri-Lim hesitated as Yarim-Lim I was expressly against such a dispatch. When Qatna tried to establish an alliance with Eshnunna, Mari, which was at war with Eshnunna, arrested the messengers on the pretext that Zimri-Lim feared for their safety; in reality, the king of Mari was probably acting on behalf of Yamhad to prevent Qatna from establishing such an alliance.|$|E

Those two Apuesta matches {{were part of a}} buildup towards one of the feature matches of the 1st EMLL 30th Anniversary Show, held on September 6, 1963. At the show Rubén Juárez defeated Espanto II in a Lucha de Apuesta, forcing Espanto to unmask. After unmasking he gave his birth name as [...] "Fernando Vázquez Cisneros", using a combination of his and his partners' paternal last names to maintain the story that the Espantos were brothers. A few weeks later Espanto <b>I</b> <b>gained</b> a measure of revenge for his team as he defeated Rubén Juárez as part of the 2nd EMLL 30th Anniversary Show. In November 1962 Espanto I and II were joined by Espanto III, Euseibo's younger brother Miguel, forming a regular trio. At the same time Espanto I and II also regularly teamed up with El Santo, often headlining EMLL shows across Mexico. Teaming with El Santo was part of a storyline where Espanto I and II would attack El Santo after a match, turning Santo to the tecnico side (those that portray the [...] "good guys") in the process. On Jun 22, 1963, Espanto I, II and El Santo lost a match to Rito Romero, Rayo de Jalisco, and Henry Pilusso. Being disappointed with the loss Espanto II attacked El Santo, but ended up with his own mask torn up and his face covered in blood when El Santo fought back. In the buildup to the mask vs. mask match between Espanto I and El Santo, El Santo defeated Espanto II in a Lucha de Apuesta match in late 1963, forcing Espanto II to have all his hair shaved off. A couple of months later El Santo would unmask Espanto I, who also stated that his last name was [...] "Vázquez Cisneros".|$|E

2500|$|The {{reign of}} Peter I, from 1903 to 1914, is {{remembered as the}} [...] "Golden Age of Serbia", due to the {{unrestricted}} political freedoms, free press, and cultural ascendancy among South Slavs who finally saw in democratic Serbia a Piedmont of South Slavs. King Peter I was supportive to the movement of Yugoslav unification, hosting in Belgrade various cultural gatherings. Grand School of Belgrade was upgraded into Belgrade University in 1905, with scholars of international renown such as Jovan Cvijić, Mihailo Petrović, Slobodan Jovanović, Jovan M. Žujović, Bogdan Popović, Jovan Skerlić, Sima Lozanić, Branislav Petronijević and several others. King Peter <b>I</b> <b>gained</b> enormous popularity following the Balkan Wars in 1912 and 1913, which, from a Serb and South Slav perspective, were a great success, heralded by the spectacular military victories over the Ottomans, followed by the liberation of [...] "Old Serbia" [...] (Kosovo Vilayet) and mostly Slavic-inhabited Macedonia (Manastir Vilayet). The territory of Serbia was doubled and her prestige among South Slavs (Croats and Slovenes in particular, and among the Serbs in Austria-Hungary, in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Vojvodina, Military Frontier, Dalmatia, Slavonia, etc.) grew significantly, with Peter I as the main symbol of this both political and cultural success.

He gained popularity playing songs where he would often accompany himself on either a piano or the harmonium, and this success led to the release of a series of records starting with 1959's Ivor Cutler of Y'Hup EP. Cutler continued to make appearances on the BBC's programmes during the 1960s, {{and as a result of}} an appearance on the television show Late Night Line-Up, he was noticed by Paul McCartney, who invited Cutler to appear in The Beatles' Magical Mystery Tour film. In the film, Cutler plays bus conductor Buster Bloodvessel, who becomes passionately attracted to Ringo Starr's Aunt Jessie. Following this film role, Cutler recorded an LP, Ludo (1967), produced by The Beatles' George Martin, and credited to the Ivor Cutler Trio, made up of Cutler with bassist Gill Lyons and percussionist Trevor Tomkins. The LP, taking inspiration from trad jazz and boogie-woogie, sees Cutler playing the piano as well as his usual harmonium, and is considered the most traditionally musical of all his records. After its release Cutler continued to perform for BBC radio, recording the first of his sessions for John Peel in 1969.
