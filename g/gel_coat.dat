A semi-elliptical surface crack {{was made at}} the center of the tensile surface of the test specimen using a Vickers indenter at a load of 24. 5 N. By this method, the crack length on surface was made the semi-elliptical cracks of about 100 ㎛. Crack-healing behavior depends on healing temperature. The optimum healing condition of Si 3 N 4 /SiC and Si 3 N 4 /SiC/TiO 2 composite ceramics are well known for 1, 300 ℃, 1 h in air environment. So Smooth and as-cracked specimens were heated in this condition.

During {{the first year of}} operation, Malibu built two boats per week using a single-hull design and each boat, with its blended <b>gel</b> <b>coat</b> design had California flare.By 1984, Malibu had repaid its initial loan and was building over 400 boats a year. Financially conservative, Alkema had directed the company to turn a profit in just over two years.By 1988, with a nine percent share of the market, the California plant was at full production. To satisfy increased demand, the company opened a second plant in Tennessee. By the end of the year, Malibu had built almost 1,000 custom ski boats and had been awarded their first Product Excellence Award for Value by Powerboat Magazine.By the end of 1992, Malibu had built a new production facility in Loudon, Tennessee to accommodate the increased demand east of the Mississippi. They removed all wood from the construction, and introduced the new, patented, Fiberglass Engine Chassis System (FibECS) which eliminated vibration and noise associated with the drivetrain.|$|E

[...] The monumental reproduction of van Gogh’s painting is located on the corner of Dundas Street and the Capricorn Highway, situated in the centre of Emerald’s Discovery Park. Weighing approximately 17,000 kilograms, Cross’ steel easel measures 25 metres in height, with the canvas measuring 7 x 10 metres. [...] The easel’s three legs consist of 30 x 30 square centimetres of steel tubing, which are secured to 10 metre piers by 24-1 metre anchor bolts.

Favoured woods, in order of rot-resistance, are White oak, Black locust, species of cedar and pine, true as well as African and Asian mahoganies, fir and spruce. Rot resistance depends on paint as well as protection from rainwater [...] Plastic hardware is sometimes used, but bronze and stainless steel are good corrosion-resistant materials for hardware, although stainless steel can be subject to crevice corrosion after many years especially in a boat using an outboard or other motor and must be inspected. Stainless steel should never be used for fittings permanently in the water. Owners should check that the correct grade of stainless steel is used in a fitting [...]Working boats may use lower-cost galvanized steel, but the hardware may need to be re-galvanized or replaced eventually.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} amphibians {{were all}} internal fertilizers. It wasn’t until 300 {{million years ago}} that the Anura (early internal fertilizer) and Caudata (early external fertilizer) orders had begun. Most anurans now externally fertilize. Anurans are the amphibians lacking a tail such as frogs and toads. Anurans are commonly used as a model organism for amphibians, because of the large, easy to manipulate eggs, fast developmental rate, high fecundity rate, no parental involvement, and external fertilization. Males will congregate near a lake or pond and establish calling stations. Females approach the area and listen to all of the different male calls, and then continue to move towards the mate she chooses. This is the anuran’s sexual selection. It has been concluded that females prefer a male with a more attractive call, which is also the larger male. Copulation occurs when a male anuran hops onto the back of a female. They then move to a spot near water to simultaneously release their sperm and eggs. Other males in the area can also release sperm onto the eggs to also attempt to fertilize the eggs. If the female does not want to reproduce with the male that jumps onto her back, she will wait until the male leaves or move to a new location. Sperm released into the water must be in close proximity, get to the egg first, and then enter the gel layer of the egg to have the best chance of fertilizing. When the anurans are not close to eggs, they sometimes release their sperm into oocyte containing foam nests, or terrestrial breeders go right to the <b>gel</b> <b>coat</b> of the oocyte to release their sperm. Over the course of a breeding season, males can copulate numerous times by releasing sperm anywhere he finds unfertilized eggs or encounters a female who is/wants to spawn. Females, however, can only release eggs once per breeding season. Releasing sperm directly into the water increases sperm competition through agonistic behavior and spawning in groups. This has been tested, with good evidence associated with a larger sperm number and testes size. Smaller testes size and a slower sperm velocity were seen with the anurans that released the sperm into the foam nests instead of into open water. To further increase sperm competition, there is a larger thickness to an anuran oocyte gel, specifically the green tree frog. Anuran sperm also have high longevity and osmotic tolerance compared to fresh water fish. The Caudata order contains all of the salamanders and newts, amphibians that have tails. Within this, the only subgroups that externally fertilize are Cryptobranchidae (giant salamanders) Sirenidae, and Hynobiidae. The females release egg sacs onto stones or branches and the male later hovers over the eggs to release the sperm to them. Males are seen to be very protective over the eggs and may continue to hover over the eggs after sperm release to decrease sperm competition. In some cases, males may even latch onto the females while they lay their eggs to ensure that they fertilize them first. Other times there may be numerous males surrounding a single sac of eggs, creating scramble competition. Cryptobranchid sperm is seen to have higher longevity. This is about 600 times greater than in freshwater fish, but not even close to as high as anurans.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{formulate}} a self-nanoemulsifying system (SNES) containing model lipophilic drug, felodipine (FLD), to improve its solubility. The SNES was formulated using varying amounts of Miglyol® 840 (as an oil), Cremophor® EL (as a surfactant), and Capmul® MCM (as a co-surfactant). The SNES were characterized for turbidity, droplet size and in vitro FLD release. The SNES containing oil, surfactant, and co-surfactant in the weight ratio of 3. 5 : 1. 0 : 1. 0, respectively, showed good emulsification, median droplet size of 421  nm, and rapid FLD release (> 90 % release in 15  min). Gelling was induced in the SNES by addition of Aerosil® 200 (A 200). Rheological studies clearly demonstrated the formation of gelled microstructure with enhanced elasticity for SNES with A 200. Since FLD warrants extended delivery for management of hypertension, the gelled SNES was further encased within the hydrophobic Gelucire® 43 / 01 (<b>GEL)</b> <b>coat</b> to extend the release of FLD. Caprol® PGE- 860 (CAP) was added to this coat as a release enhancer. No interaction was seen between GEL and CAP in differential scanning calorimetry.

CAP by virtue of channel formation in <b>GEL</b> <b>coat</b> favored the FLD release, while the A 200 retarded the FLD release by inducing gelling.

Cell culture models that recapitulate epithelial tissue architecture are invaluable to unravel developmental and disease mechanisms. Although factors important {{for the establishment of}} basal polarity have been identified, requirements for the formation of apical polarity in three-dimensional tissue structures have not been thoroughly investigated. Results We demonstrate that the human mammary epithelial cell line- 3522 S 1, provides a resilient model for studying the formation of basoapical polarity in glandular structures. Testing three-dimensional culture systems that differ in composition and origin of substrata reveals that apical polarity is more sensitive to culture conditions than basal polarity. Using a new high-throughput culture method that produces basoapical polarity in glandular structures without a <b>gel</b> <b>coat,</b> we show that basal polarity-mediated signaling and collagen IV are both necessary for the development of apical polarity.

Gel swelling and stability, and rheological and uniaxial stretch tests on different percentages of alginate and gelatin demonstrate the gel ability to resist to biochemical microenvironment, to well withstand physiological deformations (~ 10 %) and wall shear stresses (5 - 20 dyne/cm 2).
