5|$|Hamilton was {{the colonel}} of the 15th Regiment of <b>Foot</b> <b>from</b> 22 August 1792 to 1794, {{during which he}} {{took part in the}} 1790s West Indies Campaign. The 15th Foot was awarded the battle honour Martinique 1794 (5 February – 25 March). During the battle, the 15th Foot {{was a part of the}} First Brigade, which {{consisted}} of the 39th and 43rd Regiment of Foot and was led by Sir C. Gordon.|$|E
5|$|Since Wellington {{was anxious}} {{not to bring}} on an engagement, he tried to flank Soult out of position. He sent Beresford to cross the Gave de Pau {{downstream}} at Lahontan and circle around Soult's right flank. At the same time, Hill's corps moved directly toward Orthez. By 25 February, Soult had massed his army at Orthez and courted battle with the Allies. The French marshal counted 33,000 foot soldiers, 2,000 horsemen, 1,500 gunners and sappers, supported by 48 field guns. Wellington could bring 38,000 infantry, 3,300 cavalry, 1,500 gunners and sappers, supported by 54 artillery pieces against the French. Five battalions were absent: 1/43rd Foot and 1/95th Rifles from the Light Division, 2nd Provisional from 4th Division, 79th <b>Foot</b> <b>from</b> 6th Division and 51st <b>Foot</b> <b>from</b> 7th Division. Confronted with Soult in a fighting mood, the British commander planned to send Beresford to break Soult's right flank while Picton and three divisions kept the French center busy. Meanwhile, Hill's corps was to attack Orthez, get across the Gave de Pau and envelop the French left flank. With luck, Soult would be crushed between Beresford and Hill.|$|E
5|$|The atoll {{consists}} of four islets: Acadia, Pandora, Westward and Edwards. The last three of these can be accessed on <b>foot</b> <b>from</b> Acadia at low tide. The islets were named by Harald Rehder and John Randall, who visited the atoll during an expedition by the Smithsonian Institution in 1975.|$|E

5|$|As {{the team}} {{advanced}} to the front, they were brought under heavy enemy rifle, grenade and mortar fire. Just as the three had reached the front lines, a Japanese grenade landed among them. It {{was less than a}} <b>foot</b> <b>from</b> the two Marines with PFC Gonsalves. Without a moment's hesitation, he flung himself on the grenade, taking the full explosion into his own body. He gallantly gave his life for his fellow Marines and his country. The other two were not even touched by grenade fragments and they successfully completed their mission.|$|E
5|$|Collector Heinrich Fischer had {{originally}} labeled a partial <b>foot,</b> <b>from</b> the Solnhofen area, {{as belonging to}} Compsognathus longipes. Though this identification was rejected by Wilhelm Barnim Dames in 1884, Friedrich von Huene nevertheless in 1925 provisionally referred the specimen to Compsognathus. However, Ostrom's study of 1978 has disproven this. Jens Zinke in 1998 assigned forty-nine teeth from the Kimmeridgian Guimarota formation of Portugal to the genus. These were not identical to those of C. longipes, having serrations on the front edge, but were because of general similarities in form referred to a Compsognathus sp.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} year of his {{contract}} with the Lightning during the 2014–15 season, Brewer was traded after 17 games to the Anaheim Ducks in exchange for a third-round draft pick in 2015 on November 28, 2014. At the time, he was playing in his fifth season with the Lightning. He appeared in 17 games, and had four assists on the year. Brewer played in 246 games with Tampa, scoring 10 goals and 46 assists. He also had 180 penalty minutes in his four-and-a quarter seasons with Tampa Bay. On December 3, 2014, the Ducks announced that Brewer was expected to miss four-to-six weeks with a broken bone in his <b>foot</b> <b>from</b> a blocked shot.|$|E

5|$|Shulgin {{spent most}} of his later life at the Farm in Lafayette, California. On April 8, 2008, at the age of 82, he {{underwent}} surgery to replace a defective aortic valve. On November 16, 2010, he suffered a stroke, from which he largely recovered. Also at the close of 2010, a skin-grafting surgery saved his left <b>foot</b> <b>from</b> being amputated. Around this time, Shulgin began showing early signs of dementia, mostly severe loss of short-term memory. With progression of the dementia since 2010, his wife Ann Shulgin had been trying to sell part of their property to raise more money to cover care costs.|$|E
5|$|The {{men of the}} Harel brigade made {{leave on}} <b>foot</b> <b>from</b> Bab al-Oued but took a wrong way and mistakenly {{attacked}} Hill 315. Located by the Jordanian sentries, they launch the attack of the hill. The Legionnaires were outnumbered but counterattacked with violence, going as far as requiring an artillery bombing on their own position. The Israelis suffered some heavy losses. When the Yiftach arrived {{at the bottom of}} Hill 346, they are targeted by firearms, grenades and artillery. Thinking that Harel men were there, they called by radio to the headquarters to ceasefire, and laid down arms. They refused, not believing that account of the events and Harel soldiers stayed in place.|$|E
5|$|The {{regiment}} {{also saw}} service at Guadeloupe (12 April) the same year. He was colonel {{of his old}} regiment, the 21st <b>Foot,</b> <b>from</b> 1794 to 1803.

5|$|Agile, quick, creative, and powerful, Balotelli is {{credited}} with pace, flair, physical strength, technical ability, and an eye for goal; his height, elevation and physique allow him to excel in the air, and {{he is capable of}} scoring with his head or with either <b>foot,</b> <b>from</b> both inside or outside the area. Although he normally plays in a central role as a main striker, he is a versatile forward, who is capable of playing anywhere along the front line, and has also been deployed as a winger or as a second striker. Despite his talent, however, he has been criticized by managers, teammates, and the media for a perceived poor and immature attitude at times, as well as his for his poor movement and work-rate, inconsistency, mentality, and volatile temperament and arrogant behaviour on the pitch, which has often led him to pick up unnecessary bookings throughout his career. Balotelli has also been accused of diving, and is thus regarded by teammates and the media as a promising but undisciplined player. Due to his powerful shot, Balotelli is also a set-piece specialist, and is {{regarded as one of the}} best penalty kick takers in world football, a view backed by his former Manchester City goalkeeping teammate Joe Hart. Balotelli missed his first competitive penalty against Napoli on 22 September 2013 when it was saved by Pepe Reina; the first time in 22 attempts as a professional.|$|E
