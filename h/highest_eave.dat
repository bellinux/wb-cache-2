40|$|Data from {{tests on}} a full-scale, {{single-span}} <b>high</b> <b>eaves</b> commercial glasshouse {{are used to}} quantify the uncertainties {{associated with the use}} of computational fluid dynamics to obtain wind load predictions for full-scale structures. It is demonstrated that the widely used assumption of two-dimensional flow field in the mid-span leads to serious overestimation of the suction pressures over the roof and on the leeward wall. It is further shown that the use of a Reynolds-stress closure enables the capture of flow reversal downstream of the windward eaves. In contrast, the industry-standard k}e model is found to predict no flow separation, contrary to the experimental observation. Finally, guidelines are suggested for suitable mesh distributions and for the e$cient sizing of the computational domain relative to the building’s dimen...|$|R

It has small square headed windows lighting the lower storey {{which was a}} vaulted undercroft. The upper floor was the refectory of the abbey and has beautiful lancet windows and a very fine reader's pulpit. The reader's pulpit has clearly been 'prettified', presumably as part of Vyner's landscaping scheme - but thankfully so, as it would not otherwise have survived in such a stone-hungry region. The ruins are a Grade I listed building.|$|R
50|$|The {{courthouse}} {{was built}} in August 1818 by Samuel Elliot. The cost of the structure was not to exceed $400. It was a single-story two-room cabin {{in the manner of}} a double log cabin. One room was 20 ft square, and the other was 20 ft by 12 ft; the two were separated by a 10 ft entryway. The building was to be 10 ft <b>high</b> to the <b>eaves,</b> and each room was to contain one window facing the east in order to take advantage of the sun. Villagers erected a chimney for each room after it was decided to use the structure as a school.|$|R
50|$|The {{three types}} of hall house are called after the number of rows of pillars which carry the roof {{construction}}. The oldest form, which would also have the lowest roof, was called a Zweiständerhaus because the whole construction rested on two rows of pillars (front to back) carrying beams across the centre. They were pillars and not posts because they rested on stones and were not set in holes in the ground as their predecessors had been. A typical house might have 14 rows of pillars, with a corresponding 14 beams, each of them being originally a single oak tree. Nothing else is load-bearing, although the half-timbered construction with infill does give some extra stability. The infill these days {{is likely to be}} brickwork, but was originally wattle and daub, covered with a lime mixture. The oldest house in Wendland of this construction is around 1611, but only about 10 are 17th century in origin, most of the others being 18th century. They are comparatively rare, as less than 80 remain in Wendland.The more recent form which became common throughout the 19th century is called in German Vierständerhaus which means that the roof construction is carried by four rows of pillars carrying beams. This means that the central barn area is narrower than for Zweiständerhäuser but the two single storey sides are larger. The overall building will also be larger, and are sometimes three stories high, or have two stories with much larger hay lofts and storage above the barn.There is a third form which is called a Dreiständerhaus, with three rows of pillars. This looks like a two pillar-row house on one side, with lower eaves, and a four pillar-row house with <b>higher</b> <b>eaves</b> on the other. It also looks lopsided because the barn door is no longer central under the roof apex. This hybrid form can be found across all the eras but was commoner during the 18th century. It is commoner in Wendland than almost anywhere else across Northern Germany (although even here there are only 40 surviving examples), and there are two Wendland villages, Prießeck and Püggen, where it is the commonest form. It {{does not appear to be}} a transition between the two and the four pillar-row models but a genuine attempt to get the best of two different models, an experiment which ultimately did not make it through to the very end of the 19th century when almost the last hall houses were being built.|$|R
5000|$|Constructed in stone, in {{the style}} of the 13th century, the church has slate roofs. Its plan {{consists}} of a six-bay nave with a clerestory, north and south aisles, and a two-bay chancel with north and south chapels. On the west gable is a delicate open timber bellcote, which is described in the Pevsner Architectural Guide as the [...] "most striking" [...] external feature of the church. The west front has a pair of arched doorways under a larger arch containing a roundel. Above this is an eight-light window. The west front is flanked by large buttresses rising <b>higher</b> than the <b>eaves.</b> Along the sides of the clerestory are four-light windows. On the sides of the chancel are dormers, and the east window has nine lights.|$|R
5000|$|The barn is a gambrel-roofed frame building. The barn is 80 ft long by 40 ft and 44 ft <b>high.</b> The <b>eaves</b> are 27 ft {{above the}} ground. A cupola is {{centered}} on the roof. The exterior of the barn was originally red siding with white trim along the roof and down the corners. In the 1950s a white gypsum siding was placed over the original wood siding. The foundation is built of cut stone hauled from Joliet Prison in Joliet, Illinois. [...] There are two large sliding doors located {{in the middle of}} the north and south walls. These doors have been altered from their original position and several small doors have been added. All the windows are original. Each is a pedimented, double-hung sash windows with six over six lights. Fourteen are on the lower half of the barn (North 6, East 1, South 6, West 1) with the remaining 8 higher on the walls. A number of fixed sash windows were added in the 1950s, but have been removed by the summer of 2014. The gambrel roof is covered with cedar shake shingles. The cupola has shuttered windows all four directions with four gables. A metal trim tops each gable.|$|R
50|$|The Reading or kite wagon is {{so named}} {{due to its}} {{straight}} sides that slope outwards towards the <b>eaves,</b> <b>high</b> arched wheels, and relative light weight; {{there is no other}} vardo that epitomizes the golden age of Romani horse travel. It dates from 1870 and is synonymous with the original builder Dauton and Sons of Reading from where the vardo takes its name. The wagon was highly prized by the Romanies for its aesthetic design, beauty and practicality to cross fords, pull off road and over rough ground, something smaller-wheeled wagons like the Burton were unable to do. The Reading wagon is 10 feet long, with a porch on the front and back. The rear wheels were 18 inches larger than the ones on the front. At the start of the 20th century the design incorporated raised skylights.|$|R

50|$|In 1470 Bümpliz {{village and}} the castle {{became part of}} the lands of the {{powerful}} Bernese patrician Erlach family. The castle was rebuilt from a purely defensive structure into an impressive administrative and residential castle. A new gatehouse tower was built, and stands, almost unchanged, today. The gatehouse tower was square and about 8.4 m on each side. It is 10 m <b>high</b> to the <b>eaves,</b> with an additional 7 m to the peak of the roof. The supports and structure of the drawbridge over the moat are still visible today. The gatehouse faces west. Next to the gatehouse, the south-west wall was raised and a block of rooms were added on the inside. Between the gatehouse and the south-west wing, a half-round tower, the Abortturm was built. The Abortturm, which no longer exists, contained bathrooms for the first and second floors as well as stairs into the roof over the gatehouse. Around the same time, the old half-round tower in the north-east and the eastern housing tract were expanded. The north-west housing tract, which flanks the gatehouse, was built later, around 1630.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{experiment}} uses wind-tunnel modelling {{method to}} investigate an intermittent ventilation of pollutants within an urban intersection. The model is designed after a typical inner-city area occurring frequently in European countries. It consists of apartment houses with roofs arranged to the several blocks. Blocks form regular patterns divided by intersections with height to width ratio equal to one. Project {{has focused on}} velocity characteristics inside the intersection and adjacent canyon. The skewness and kurtosis of velocity components were studied {{in order to identify}} an area with strong intermittent tendency. Velocity measurement was carried out using 2 -component LDA. Pollutants have released from line source and mean concentration was obtained using slow flame ionisation detector. Comparison of time-mean flow and concentration spatial distribution verified that vertical vortices, the typical flow patterns formed inside street canyons, as well as corner vortices created just behind the turning of the street are responsible for accumulation of emissions emitted by vehicle traffic. Flow instabilities corresponding to enhancement of skewness value break down these patterns and significantly ventilate street canyons removing exhalations. Longitudinal velocity indicates an unsteady acceleration near the rooftop level whereas deceleration occurred close to surface, so it produces a higher rotational speed in recirculation zone. In contrary, the strongest downward penetration of fresh air (into the canyon) is located behind the roof eaves on leeward building. With incoming downward gust, the recirculation zone is significantly weakened. Speed extremities (derived from kurtosis) also show the <b>highest</b> value at <b>eaves</b> level. Similar process appears i...|$|R
60|$|It was broad day, {{but still}} bitter {{cold and the}} sun not up, when I came in view of my destination. A single gable and chimney of the cottage peeped over the {{shoulder}} of the hill; not far off, and a trifle higher on the mountain, a tall old white-washed farmhouse stood among the trees, beside a falling brook; beyond were rough hills of pasture. I bethought me that shepherd folk were early risers, and if I were once seen skulking in that neighbourhood it might prove the ruin of my prospects; took advantage of a line of hedge, and worked myself up in its shadow till I was come under the garden wall of my friends’ house. The cottage was a little quaint place of many rough-cast gables and grey roofs. It had something the air of a rambling infinitesimal cathedral, the body of it rising in the midst two storeys high, with a steep-pitched roof, and sending out upon all hands (as it were chapter-houses, chapels, and transepts) one-storeyed and dwarfish projections. To add to this appearance, it was grotesquely decorated with crockets and gargoyles, ravished from some medieval church. The place seemed hidden away, being not only concealed in the trees of the garden, but, on the side on which I approached it, buried as <b>high</b> as the <b>eaves</b> by the rising of the ground. About the walls of the garden there went a line of well-grown elms and beeches, the first entirely bare, the last still pretty well covered with red leaves, and the centre was occupied with a thicket of laurel and holly, in which I could see arches cut and paths winding.|$|R
60|$|When {{we turned}} out before sunrise next morning, I {{found myself in}} perhaps the most charming of all the charming 'camps' of these forests. Its owner, the warden, fearing the {{unhealthy}} air of the sea-coast, had bought some hundreds of acres {{up here in the}} hills, cleared them, and built, or rather was building, in the midst. As yet the house was rudimentary. A cottage of precious woods cut off the clearing, standing, of course, on stilts, contained two rooms, an inner and an outer. There was no glass in the windows, which occupied half the walls. Door or shutters, to be closed if the wind and rain were too violent, are all that is needed in a climate where the temperature changes but little, day or night, throughout the year. A table, unpolished, like the wooden walls, but, like them, of some precious wood; a few chairs or benches, not forgetting, of course, an American rocking-chair; a shelf or two, with books of law and medicine, and beside them a few good books of devotion: a press; a 'perch' for hanging clothes--for they mildew when kept in drawers--just such as would have been seen in a mediaeval house in England; a covered four-post bed, with gauze curtains, indispensable for fear of vampires, mosquitoes, and other forest plagues; these make up the furniture of such a bachelor's camp as, to the man who lives doing good work all day out of doors, leaves nothing to be desired. Where is the kitchen? It consists of half a dozen great stones under yonder shed, where as good meals are cooked as in any London kitchen. Other sheds hold the servants and hangers-on, the horses and mules; and as the establishment grows, more will be added, and the house itself will probably expand laterally, like a peripheral Greek temple, by rows of posts, probably of palm-stems thatched over with wooden shingle or with the leaves of the Timit {233} palm. If ladies come to inhabit the camp, fresh rooms will be partitioned off by boardings as <b>high</b> as the <b>eaves,</b> leaving the roof within open and common, for the sake of air. Soon, no regular garden, but beautiful flowering shrubs--Crotons, Dracaenas, and Cereuses, will be planted; great bushes of Bauhinia and blue Petraea will roll their long curved shoots over and over each other; Gardenias fill the air with fragrance; and the Bougain-villia or the Clerodendron cover some arbour with lilac or white racemes.|$|R
