50|$|Pointing at {{stationary}} targets such as buttons, windows, images, menu items, {{and controls}} on computer displays is commonplace {{and has a}} well-established modeling tool for analysis - Fitts law (Fitts, 1954) - which states that {{the time to make}} an aimed movement (MT) is a linear function of the <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>difficulty</b> of the movement: MT = a + bID. The <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>difficulty</b> (ID) for any given movement {{is a function of the}} ratio of distance to the target (D) and width of the target (W): ID = log2(2D/W) - a relationship derivable from information theory. Fitts law is actually responsible for the ubiquity of the computer mouse, due to the research of Card, English, and Burr (1978). Extensions of Fitts law also apply to pointing at spatially moving targets, via the steering law, originally discovered by C.G. Drury in 1971 and later on rediscovered in the context of human-computer interaction by Accott & Zhai (1997, 1999).|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Speed-Accuracy Tradeoff is a {{study of}} human {{perceptions}} and reactions which can be applied {{in a variety of}} design. An examination seat can be considered as a workstation operated by an examiner which is essential in the education process. Unlike common workstations which are designed to improve the working accuracy, the examination seats are designed to minimize the copy accuracy. A major propose of examination management is to protect the academic dishonesty. A common way to reduce cheating is the seat arrangement by increasing the distance between the examination seats. However the cheating problems may occur when the large number of examiners is set in a relative small room. The arrangement of exam seats are limited by room space then the relative close distance between seats may encourage examination cheating. Based on speed-accuracy tradeoff, the distance between seats and the copying time period can be set as the speed factors or the <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>difficulties</b> which affect the copying accuracy. The results show the relationship between the copy accuracy and <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>difficulties</b> such as the examination seat distance and the looking time periods.

40|$|Humans' {{inability}} to move fast and accurately {{at the same}} time is expressed in Fitts's law. It states that the movement time between targets depends on the <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>difficulty,</b> which {{is a function of the}} target width and the inter-target distance. The present study investigated the electrophysiological correlates of Fitts's law during action planning using high-density electroencephalography. Movement times were scaled according to Fitts's law, indicating that participants could not overcome the speed-accuracy trade-off during a 1 -s preparation period. Importantly, the <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>difficulty</b> of the planned movement correlated linearly with the amplitudes of the cognitive N 2 and P 3 b components, which developed during the planning period over parieto-occipital areas.

40|$|Fitts ’ law {{has proven}} to be a strong {{predictor}} of pointing performance under a wide range of conditions. However, it has been insufficient in modeling small-target acquisition with finger-touch based input on screens. We propose a dual-distribution hypothesis to interpret the distribution of the endpoints in finger touch input. We hypothesize the movement endpoint distribution as a sum of two independent normal distributions. One distribution reflects the relative precision governed by the speed-accuracy tradeoff rule in the human motor system, and the other captures the absolute precision of finger touch independent of the speed-accuracy tradeoff effect. Based on this hypothesis, we derived the FFitts model—an expansion of Fitts ’ law for finger touch input. We present three experiments in 1 D target acquisition, 2 D target acquisition and touchscreen keyboard typing tasks respectively.

Online knowledge of effector position was displayed as a visual trace on a projector screen. Target widths were manipulated with amplitude constant (16 degrees) in order to create <b>Indexes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Difficulty</b> <b>of</b> 1. 5, 3, 4. 5, and 6. Results failed to detect differences in elbow and wrist movements either in terms of movement time, movement accuracy, or kinematic characteristics of the movement. In studies that have reported difference in wrist and arm performance in Fitts? target tasks, experimenters have typically utilized visual amplification to counterbalance the small resulting wrist movements. The purpose of Experiments II and III was to investigate how changes in task parameters and visual gain play a role in providing a performance advantage for the wrist. In these experiments arm movement amplitude was increased to 32 degrees and wrist amplitude was decreased to 8 degrees. Results found similar overall movement times for arm and wrist movements. However, kinematic analysis of the movement revealed relatively large dwell times for wrist movements at IDs of 4. 5 and 6. Removal of dwell time resulted in faster movement times for the wrist compared to arm. The results of these three experiments add to the limited literature examining how different effectors perform a Fitts? target task.

40|$|Human {{performance}} in selection tasks is frequently described by Fitts' law, {{which states that}} the average time needed {{to move to a}} target and select it is linearly related to the <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>difficulty</b> for the task, which is the logarithm of the task characteristic C=A/W, where A is the target distance and W is the target width. The coefficients in this linear relationship can vary across interaction conditions, such as when using distinct interaction devices, and can for instance be used to define throughput, which is a standardized measure to compare interaction conditions. Although Fitts' law has proven very useful in the field of human–computer interaction (HCI) over the past 50 years, there are several issues with Fitts' law that argue in favor of more advanced statistical modeling of experimental data. More specifically, we propose two generalizations of Fitts' law. The first generalization is not to limit the data analysis to average movement times, but to consider the distributions of the observed times instead. The second generalization is to extend Fitts' law to a more general relationship between task characteristics and <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>difficulty</b> and to use this generalized model to come up with additional measures that can be used alongside throughput...|$|E

The results indicated that eye movements during imagery did not affect the temporal parameters of the trained movement. They did, however, help to achieve maximal gains in movement accuracy and efficiency. These positive effects on the spatial parameters were most pronounced during conditions with high accuracy demands and were present for both the trained and the untrained hand.
