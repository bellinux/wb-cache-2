5|$|Baker's yeast or Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a {{unicellular}} fungus, {{is used to}} make {{bread and}} other wheat-based products, such as pizza <b>dough</b> <b>and</b> dumplings. Yeast species of the genus Saccharomyces are also used to produce alcoholic beverages through fermentation. Shoyu koji mold (Aspergillus oryzae) is an essential ingredient in brewing Shoyu (soy sauce) and sake, and the preparation of miso, while Rhizopus species are used for making tempeh. Several of these fungi are domesticated species that were bred or selected according to their capacity to ferment food without producing harmful mycotoxins (see below), which are produced by very closely related Aspergilli. Quorn, a meat substitute, is made from Fusarium venenatum.|$|E
5|$|Testaroli is {{prepared}} from a batter that is cooked {{on a hot}} flat surface, after which it may be consumed.

Testaroli is {{sometimes referred to as}} a bread, similar to focaccia in composition, and is sometimes referred to as a crêpe. It may be dressed with pesto sauce or other ingredients such as olive oil, Pecorino cheese, Parmigiano-Reggiano, and garlic.

40|$|Aims Our {{objective}} was to verify the relationship between worsening dough rheological properties caused by pre-harvest irrigation and degree of polymerization of storage protein in wheat. Methods We applied three irrigation regimes (none, 14 days after anthesis and both 14 and 28 days after anthesis) to the Jimai 20 cultivar of wheat and examined effects on grain yield, parameters representing polymerization of storage protein <b>and</b> <b>dough</b> rheological properties. Important findings Grain yield was highest <b>and</b> both <b>dough</b> development time <b>and</b> <b>dough</b> stability time were longest with the single post-anthesis irrigation, while the second irrigation led to shortened <b>dough</b> development time <b>and</b> <b>dough</b> stability time <b>and</b> weakened gluten strength, as well as decreased glutenin polymerization index and average size of glutenin macopolymer (GMP). Stepwise correlation analysis suggested that the poorer <b>dough</b> rheological properties <b>and</b> weakened gluten strength with two post-anthesis irrigations resulted mainly from reduced GMP particle size...|$|R

40|$|Yeast's role in bread {{making is}} {{primarily}} the fermentative production {{of carbon dioxide}} to leaven the dough. Fermentation also impacts dough matrix rheology, thereby affecting {{the quality of the}} end product. Surprisingly, the role of ethanol, the other yeast primary metabolite, has been ill studied in this context. Therefore, this study aims to assess the potential impact of ethanol on yeastless <b>dough</b> extensibility <b>and</b> spread and gluten agglomeration at concentrations at which it is produced in fermenting dough, i. e., up to 60 mmol per 100 g of flour. Reduced <b>dough</b> extensibility <b>and</b> <b>dough</b> spread were observed upon incorporation of ethanol in the <b>dough</b> formula, <b>and</b> were more pronounced for a weak than for a strong flour. Uniaxial and biaxial extension tests showed up to 50 % decrease in <b>dough</b> extensibility <b>and</b> a <b>dough</b> strength increase of up to 18 % for 60 mmol of ethanol/ 100 g of flour.

Sequential extraction of flour in increasing ethanol concentrations showed that better gluten-solvent interaction is a possible explanation for the changed dough behavior. status: publishe...|$|R

25|$|Wheat {{has also}} {{been the subject of}} {{mutation}} breeding, with the use of gamma, x-rays, ultraviolet light, and sometimes harsh chemicals. The varieties of wheat created through these methods are in the hundreds (going as far back as 1960), more of them being created in higher populated countries such as China. Bread wheat with high grain iron and zinc content was developed through gamma radiation breeding. Modern bread wheat varieties have been cross-bred to contain greater amounts of gluten, which affords significant advantages for improving the quality of breads and pastas from a functional point of view. Gluten is appreciated for its unique viscoelastic properties. It gives elasticity to <b>dough</b> <b>and</b> is responsible for dough’s gas-retaining properties.|$|E

25|$|In the 1st century AD {{writings}} of Horace, lagana (singular: laganum) were fine sheets of fried <b>dough</b> <b>and</b> were an everyday foodstuff. Writing in the 2nd century Athenaeus of Naucratis provides {{a recipe for}} lagana which he attributes to the 1st century Chrysippus of Tyana: sheets of dough made of wheat flour and the juice of crushed lettuce, then flavoured with spices and deep-fried in oil. An early 5th century cookbook describes a dish called lagana that consisted of layers of dough with meat stuffing, a possible ancestor of modern-day lasagna. However, the method of cooking these sheets of dough does not correspond to our modern definition of either a fresh or dry pasta product, which only had similar basic ingredients and perhaps the shape. The first concrete information concerning pasta products in Italy dates from the 13th or 14th century.|$|E
25|$|Liège waffles, {{the most}} popular {{contemporary}} Belgian waffle variety, are rumored to have been invented during the 18th century, as well, by the chef to the prince-bishop of Liège. However, there are no German, French, Dutch, or Belgian cookbooks that contain references to them in this period – by any name – nor are there any waffle recipes that mention the Liège waffle's distinctive ingredients, brioche-based <b>dough</b> <b>and</b> pearl sugar. It is not until 1814 that Antoine Beauvilliers publishes a recipe in l'Art du Cuisiner where brioche dough is introduced as {{the base of the}} waffle and sucre cassé (crushed block sugar) is used as a garnish for the waffles, though not worked into the dough. Antonin Carême, the famous Parisian pastry chef, is the first to incorporate gros sucre into several waffle variations named in his 1822 work, Le Maitre d'Hotel Français. Then, in 1834, Leblanc publishes a complete recipe for gaufres grêlées (hail waffles), where gros sucre is mixed in. A full Gaufre de Liège recipe does not appear until 1921.|$|E
40|$|To {{improve the}} {{rheological}} properties of zein <b>doughs,</b> a-type zein <b>and</b> zein-starch <b>doughs</b> were prepared with the oxidising agents, hydrogen peroxide and peroxidase, which strengthen gluten-based doughs by cross-linking. Hydrogen peroxide and peroxidase increased zein dough extensibility compared to preparation with water. Hydrogen peroxide prepared zein <b>doughs</b> were extensible <b>and</b> cohesive below zein’s glass transition temperature. The doughs did not exude water and maintained flexibility when stored. Confocal {{laser scanning microscopy}} revealed that in zein-starch doughs prepared with hydrogen peroxide a thin continuous zein matrix was formed around the starch granules, whereas doughs prepared with water exhibited clumps of granules. SDS-PAGE of zein <b>doughs</b> <b>and</b> films treated with the oxidising agents showed no evidence of zein polymerisation, nor did Fourier transform infrared spectrometry reveal any significant changes in secondary structure. Further, hydrogen peroxide treatment did not increase zein film glass transition temperature, but it did increase transition enthalpy, and film water uptake increased with hydrogen peroxide concentration. The greatly increased extensibility of hydrogen peroxide prepared zein <b>doughs</b> <b>and</b> their improved water-holding are not due to oxidative cross-linking. It is proposed that the effects are primarily due to hydroxylation of amino acid aliphatic side chains, improving hydration through hydrogen bonding.
