40|$|Free {{flight tests}} {{were carried out}} to show whether the {{longitudinal}} oscillations of a standard S. E. 5 A airplane are noticeably affected if its longitudinal moment of inertia is increased. These oscillations were taken {{by means of a}} self-recording instrument, the airplane having first its ordinary moment of inertia and then one increased by 14 percent. The period of oscillation was slightly longer after the increase of the moment of inertia, but the damping was not affected. Presented here are test results from an investigation to determine the relative performance of a single-cylinder, high-speed, compression-ignition engine when using <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>valve</b> nozzles with different numbers, sizes, and directions of round orifices. A spring loaded, automatic injection valve was used. It was centrally located {{at the top of a}} vertical disk-type combustion chamber formed between horizontally opposed inlet and exhaust valves of a 5 -inch by 7 -inch engine. A series of <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>valve</b> nozzles with different arrangements of round orifices were tested, starting with orifices so small that impingement on the combustion chamber walls was impossible and increasing beyond the start of impingement. a :A table and curves are presented showing the performance of the engine with different nozzles.

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of an investigation to determine experimentally the instantaneous pressures at the discharge orifice of a common-rail fuel injection system in which the timing valve and cut-off valve were at some distance from the automatic <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>valve,</b> and also to determine the methods by which the pressure fluctuations could be controlled. The results show that pressure wave phenomena occur between the high-pressure reservoir and the discharge orifice, but that these pressure waves can be controlled so as to be advantageous to the injection of the fuel. The results also give data applicable to the design of such an injection system for a high-speed compression-ignition engine...|$|E

It was found that the moving air had little effect on the spray penetration except with the 0. 006 inch orifice. The moving air did, however, affect the oil particles on the outside of the spray cone. After spray cut-off, the air flow rapidly distributed the atomized fuel throughout the spray chamber...|$|R

40|$|In {{an earlier}} study, a Noval Polar Presentation (NPP) method has been {{suggested}} to detect the engine combustion-related faults for medium-speed diesel engines. The earlier proposed NPP method basically used the signature of the crankshaft torsional vibration to identify the faulty cylinder accurately. However, the detection of only a large fault like the cylinder misfiring for the 2 typical engines (16 -cylinder and 20 -cylinder engines) has been demonstrated in the earlier study. Now {{the usefulness of the}} NPP method in detection of even a very small level of the engine combustion fault like an earlier or later opening of the <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>valve</b> by just a few degrees has been presented here...|$|E
40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} the advantages of hydrogen as a fuel for Otto Cycle engines due to high thermal efficiency and low exhaust pollutant levels. Characteristic of hydrogen engine operation using premixed intake charge formation {{is a problem of}} pre-ignition resulting in an intake manifold “backfire”. Additional problems include high NOx production when using certain equivalence ratios and power output degradation due to low fuel energy/volume density. Techniques for direct and port fuel injection are discussed as means for overcoming these problems. Emphasis is placed on the need for total engine control, integrating control of fuel injection, ignition timing, intake air throttling, and vehicle subsystems within a central electronic unit. An electronically actuated <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>valve</b> and a prototype electronic control system are developed. These are applied in port and direct injection system geometries, and evaluated in engine testing. System effectiveness and feasibility are discussed...|$|E

50|$|The Jaguar AJ-V6 engine {{design is}} unique to the Jaguar X-Type; one notable {{addition}} {{is the use of}} variable valve timing.

40|$|The {{object of}} this report is to present the results of tests {{performed}} by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics {{to determine the effect}} on engine performance of directing the flow of the inlet air to a 5 -inch by 7 -inch cylinder, solid injection, compression ignition engine, After a few preliminary tests, comparative runs were made at a speed of 1500 r. p. m. with and without directed air flow. It was found that directing the flow of the inlet air toward the <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>valve</b> gave steadier engine operation, and an appreciable increase in power, and decreased fuel consumption. The results indicate the possibility of improving the performance of a given type of combustion chamber without changing its shape and with no change in valve timing. They would also seem to prove that directional turbulence, set up before the inlet valve of a four-stroke cycle engine, continues in the engine cylinder throughout the compression stroke...|$|E
40|$|International audienceUsually niobium {{is added}} in {{ferritic}} stainless steels to avoid chromium carbides precipitation {{and then to}} improve corrosion resistance and to avoid embrittlemet. This study shows that a low Nb stabilization makes recrystallization nucleation much faster and prevents incomplete recrystallization. A qualitative interpretation, based on interaction with precipitates, is proposed and explains the main features of the softening kinetics {{as well as the}} microstructures obtained. Above a specific magnetizing frequency, the deformed state led to smaller losses than the recrystallized state. These results are believed to be attributed to a grain size effect. This leads to soft magnetic properties that makes 17 %CrNb ferritic stainless steels a very interesting solution for the market of electromagnetic injection.

40|$|The use of {{electronic}} systems in automotive applications {{is characterized by}} special requirements concerning surrounding conditions, e. g. near the engine or breaks, and reliability demands. More and more piezoceramic sensors and actuators become common in such systems. Especially piezoceramic actuators are characterized by high power, low volume, fast mechanical response to an electrical pulse and a high variety of possible geometries. One application of such actuators is to drive <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>valves</b> in internal combustion engines like diesel engines or petrol engines. The goal of the project group during the past years was the development and evaluation of a safe and reliable connecting and packaging technology for piezoceramic actuators in this field of application.

40|$|Generator {{capacities}} {{on fisheries}} training vessels are designed according to demand to utilize deck machinery for fishing training, such as trawling and tuna longlining. The designed generator capacity was reviewed and measures for retionalized combustion were tested on T/V Keiten-maru. Analysis of the actually demanded power recorded every one {{hour for the}} last ten years proved that the average diversity factor was 35 % and demand factor 66 %. The load on the generator engine did not exceed 70 % of the designed maximum even when all the deck facilities were run. While independent running of the generator engine during normal cruise, load did not exceed 60 % and most frequently appeared around 40 %. The load was much lower when anchored. The designed diversity and demand factors were both assessed to have been set exceedingly. The observed irregular abrasion on pistons, piston rings and cylinderliners, were attributed to such troubles as jam of combustion residue and converse flow of exhaust gas toward intake due to inappropriate combustion induced by low-load running. In order to reset the maximum capacity of the generator engine at 80 % to 90 % of the initially designed capacity the following measures were tested. (1) delayed timing of <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> by adjustment of fuel cams, (2) reduced diameter of nozzle holes of <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>valves,</b> (3) replacement of the turbine nozzles of the turbo charger by low-load type on ones, and (4) reduced flow angle for blower blades of the turbo charger (the last two were tested simultaneously) The tested measures were concluded to be effective for improvement of low-load combustion. ...|$|R

5000|$|The Intelligent, Camshaftless, {{diesel engines}} offer several {{potential}} improvements for marine diesel main engines.

50|$|This engine has {{electronic}} hydraulic activation {{in order}} to increase flexibility with regard to <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> and exhaust <b>valve</b> activation. These two factors are adjusted {{in order to}} match operating conditions that a ship may be under. This electronic control of the start to finish of the combustion process is known as the Engine Control System. <b>Fuel</b> <b>injection</b> controls the speed in which the engine will be operating at, while the exhaust valves control the exit of combustion gases from the cylinder. The actuators for <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> and the exhaust valves are electronically controlled by the Engine Control System. For <b>fuel</b> <b>injection,</b> a plunger powered by a hydraulic piston is started with oil pressure. Oil pressure is regulated by a valve that is electronically controlled through the Engine Control System. Exhaust valves are opened by a two-stage exhaust valve actuator which is activated by oil delivered from an electronically controlled valve. By controlling these valves electronically, the combustion process is fully controlled by the Engine Control System.|$|R
5000|$|The {{concept of}} the {{intelligent}} engine revolves around {{the idea that the}} engine is thinking for itself. The brain of the system is an electronic control system that analyzes the condition of the engine and the operation of the engine’s system (The <b>fuel</b> <b>injection,</b> exhaust <b>valve,</b> cylinder lube oil and turbo charging system). Along with the control and timing needed to make the diesel run smoothly, the intelligent diesel goes beyond that by monitoring and evaluating the condition of the engine, based on engine conditions the smart system can actively protect the engine from damage due to overload, lack of maintenance and maladjustment. The intelligent engines’ finite control gives the bridge the ability to manually adjust more variables than the current camshaft system. Along with manual controls, operators can specifically design programs that optimize fuel economy, emission, turbo output, allowing for high performance under different loads.|$|R
