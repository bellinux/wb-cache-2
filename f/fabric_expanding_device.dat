The proposed inchworm actuator adopts "pusher" type with frictional clamping mechanisms and similar to most inchworm-type actuators it consists of three main components: two clamping or braking <b>devices</b> and <b>expanding</b> <b>device.</b> The central <b>expanding</b> <b>device</b> consists of a longitudinal PZT stack and a thin wall tube to provide extension-contraction motion and output force.

The abdomen can be insufflated prior to removal of the Veress needle and subsequent dilatation of the sleeve by inserting a blunt obturator with a twisting motion [56 – 58]. The advantages of this system arise from the elimination of sharp trocars [44, 56].

30|$|The {{risks of}} laparoscopic surgery {{can be divided}} into entry related complications, those that occur during the {{operation}} and those occurring post-operatively. New technologies such as the Endo tip device (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany) allows direct inspection via the laparoscope of the various layers of the anterior abdominal wall, thereby theoretically reducing the risk of type 1 and type 2 a injuries [10]. The ‘STEP’ radially <b>expanding</b> <b>device</b> (Innerdyne, Salt Lake City, Utah USA) also avoids the use of sharp trocars. It is thought that in certain circumstances, some 2 a adhesions may be pushed out of the way by the blunt ended dilator rather than penetrated [11]. Alternative approaches have been used with the optical verres system, whereby the use of micro-laparoscopes inserted down the verres needle may theoretically reduce the risk of inadvertent trauma [12]. There are, however, no randomised controlled trials, using any of these trocars, in a large series to prospectively back this new technology up. Even with disposable shielded trocars, the evidence for their use is scanty [13].|$|R

3000|$|The {{study focused}} on the {{production}} of zinc oxide (ZnO) thin films as a dielectric material for use in metal–insulator–semiconductor capacitors. The objective of {{this study has demonstrated}} the frequency dependence of conductivity and capacity. Zinc oxide (ZnO) was thin films deposited by a silicon wavelength sputtering cathode sputtering. The capacitive properties of ZnO zinc oxide were studied at room temperature. The frequency dependence of the conductivity, capacitance and the measured current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of ZnO zinc oxide thin films were studied in the frequency range from 5  kHz to 13  MHz. It is shown that the conductivity is total. Indeed, the measurement of the conductivity in alternating regime obeys the Arrhenius equation. In addition, the measured I–V characteristics of the structures studied at 10  kHz and 10  MHz clearly revealed areas of accumulation, depletion and inversion in the plots. It has been observed that AC conductivity and capacity in the ZnO thin films (ZnO) are frequency dependent. This dependence indicates that the conduction is thermally activated and maintains the correlated barrier of the charge carrier on the localized states {{as a function of the}} experimental data.

40|$|Timing-accurate storage {{emulation}} {{offers a}} unique performance evaluation capability: {{the flexibility of}} simulation {{with the reality of}} experimental measurements. This allows a researcher to experiment with not-yet-existing storage components in the context of real systems executing real applications. As its name suggests, a timing-accurate storage emulator appears to the system to be a real storage component with service times matching a simulation model (or other computational model) of that component. This allows simulated storage components to be plugged into real systems, which can then be used for complete, application-based experimentation. Additionally, timing-accurate storage emulation offers the opportunity to investigate more expressive interfaces between storage and computer systems, permitting forays into the space of hypothetical device functionalities without the difficulties of developing and supporting extensively nonstandard or novel interface actions in prototype or production systems. This dissertation identifies that there is a current and pressing need for a new storage evaluation technique, discusses design issues for achieving accurate per-request service times in a timing-accurate storage emulator, and demonstrates that it is feasible to construct and use such an emulator for interesting system-level experimentation. We built a functional timing-accurate storage emulator and explored its use in experiments involving models of existing storage products, experiments evaluating the potential of nonexistent storage components, and experiments evaluating interactions between modified computer systems and <b>expanded</b> storage <b>device</b> functionality. To experiment with existing and hypothetical storage components in computer systems, we configured our emulator with device models representing a currently-available production disk drive, a hypothetical 50, 000 RPM disk drive, and a hypothetical MEMS-based storage device, and executed three application-level workloads against these emulated models. To explore system architectures with <b>expanded</b> <b>device</b> functionality, we applied the principles of timing-accurate storage emulation in an investigation into storage-based intrusion detection systems. This experimentation demonstrates that our emulator accurately reflects the performance of modeled devices, demonstrates the feasibility of including intrusion detection capabilities into a standalone processing-enhanced disk drive, and demonstrates that extensions to existing storage communications paths may be used to transmit and receive information regarding the configuration and operational status of such an enhanced device...|$|R

40|$|Evaluation and {{management}} of abdominal pathology in patients with ventricular assist devices {{is likely to become}} increasingly important as the utilization of these <b>devices</b> <b>expands.</b> Ventricular assist <b>devices</b> represent a class of intracorporeal or paracorporeal mechanical devices that augment cardiac output in patients with congestive heart failure. Patients with ventricular assist devices supporting both right and left ventricles (biventricular assist devices) are uniquely challenging to the general surgeon because these devices restrict direct access to the abdominal cavity and because of the perioperative implications of biventricular heart failure. We describe herein the first reported successful laparoscopic cholecystectomy in a patient with a paracorporeal biventricular assist device. Cholecystectomy was performed in this patient for acute cholecystitis that occurred while the patient was awaiting heart transplantation. Our results add weight to the small body of evidence that laparoscopy is well tolerated in ventricular assist devices patients. The unique aspects of the biventricular assist device patient make laparoscopic abdominal intervention particularly suitable in this patient population...|$|R
40|$|Stent {{fracture}} is a recognised complication following device implantation. Magnetic resonance {{data from}} a patient who underwent percutaneous pulmonary valve implantation (PPVI) and had subsequent stent fractures was {{used to create a}} finite element (FE) model of the patient's implantation site. Simulated expansion of the PPVI stent into this right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) geometry was compared with free expansions of the PPVI stent up to a uniformly deployed configuration (conventional method employed in bench testing protocols), using FE analysis. PPVI biplane fluoroscopy images from the same patient were used to reconstruct the 3 D shape and deformation of the stent in-situ and verify the FE geometrical results. Asymmetries were measured in all 3 orthogonal directions, in early systole and diastole. Although a simplified FE modelling of stent/implantation site interaction was adopted, this analysis gave useful information about the influence of the RVOT on the final geometry and mechanical performance of the stent. When deployed into the RVOT, the FE stent showed a non-uniform shape, similar to the geometry seen in the "real" fluoroscopy reconstructed stent, where the most expanded cells corresponded to the fracture locations. This asymmetrical geometry, when compared to the free-expanded stent, resulted in higher stresses in the portion of the stent where fractures occurred. Furthermore, fatigue fractures that were not predicted in the free-deployed stents, developed in the asymmetrically <b>expanded</b> <b>device.</b> In conclusion, the interaction between the PPVI device and the patient's RVOT {{is likely to be the}} crucial factor involved with this undesired event.
