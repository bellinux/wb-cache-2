According to the report, one of the most promising techniques investigated was initiation of rain from seeding of mass-fire thunderheads and other clouds passing over the developing, and then stable, firestorm.|$|E
500|$|The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), a New Deal relief {{agency for}} young men, {{played a major}} role between 1933 and 1942 in {{developing}} both Glacier National Park and Yellowstone National Park. CCC projects included reforestation, campground development, trail construction, fire <b>hazard</b> <b>reduction,</b> and fire-fighting work. The increase in motor vehicle traffic through the park during the 1930s resulted in the construction of new concession facilities at Swiftcurrent and Rising Sun, both designed for automobile-based tourism.

40|$|The Southern California Seismographic Network (SCSN) is jointly {{operated}} by the Pasadena Office of the U. S.

The SCSN has 224 remote sites (with 434 components) and gathers data from local, regional and teleseismic earthquakes. These data are used for earthquake <b>hazards</b> <b>reduction</b> {{as well as for}} basic scientific research. The earthquake <b>hazards</b> <b>reduction</b> effort has become more important as moderate-sized earthquakes continue to occur within densely populated areas in southern California. Although the USGS operates most of the remote stations in the SCSN, Caltech operates 24 short-period telemetered stations and 15 very broad-band TERRAscope stations. In 1994 - 1995 we plan to install four more TERRAscope stations. Caltech also maintains drum recorders and other equipment at the central site located in the Seismological Laboratory at Caltech...|$|R
40|$|This Assessment was {{conducted}} to improve the National Earthquake <b>Hazards</b> <b>Reduction</b> Program (NEHRP) by providing NEHRP agencies with information that supports their user-oriented setting of crosscutting priorities in the NEHRP strategic planning process. The primary objective of this Assessment was to take a ``snapshot`` evaluation {{of the needs of}} selected users throughout the major program elements of NEHRP. Secondary objectives were to conduct an assessment of the knowledge that exists (or is being developed by NEHRP) to support earthquake risk reduction, and to begin a process of evaluating how NEHRP is meeting user needs. An identification of NEHRP`s strengths also resulted from the effort, since those strengths demonstrate successful methods that may be useful to NEHRP in the future. These strengths are identified in the text, and many of them represent important achievements since the Earthquake <b>Hazards</b> <b>Reduction</b> Act was passed in 1977...|$|R

50|$|In {{cooperation}} with the Department of Veterans Affairs, USGS continued to monitor and record in detail the performance of veterans hospital buildings during earthquakes.

50|$|Bushfire <b>hazard</b> <b>reduction,</b> {{controlled}} burning-off, is practised {{to protect}} urban areas within the Mountains; however {{it has been}} shown to have potentially disturbing effects on the swamps.

50|$|A {{controlled}} or prescribed burn, {{also known}} as <b>hazard</b> <b>reduction</b> burning, backfire, swailing, or a burn-off, is a technique sometimes used in forest management, farming, prairie restoration or greenhouse gas abatement. Fire is {{a natural part of}} both forest and grassland ecology and controlled fire can be a tool for foresters. <b>Hazard</b> <b>reduction</b> or controlled burning is conducted during the cooler months to reduce fuel buildup and decrease the likelihood of serious hotter fires. Controlled burning stimulates the germination of some desirable forest trees, and reveals soil mineral layers which increases seedling vitality, thus renewing the forest. Some cones, such as those of Lodgepole Pine and Sequoia, are serotinous, as well as many chaparral shrubs, meaning they require heat from fire to open cones to disperse seeds.|$|E

40|$|In {{the history}} of {{earthquake}} studies there are certain red-letter dates that have special significance either because of the occurrence of a particularly noteworthy earthquake, the recording of special earthquake data, or because {{of the discovery of}} a far-reaching and seminal concept. To these red-letter dates there must now be added 1977, the year that earthquake studies received the official attention and approval of the United States Congress; the year that saw the passage by Congress of the Earthquake <b>Hazards</b> <b>Reduction</b> Act. This Act, I believe, {{can be attributed to the}} shock effects of the 9 February 1971, San Fernando, California earthquake, and, particularly to the lasting concern of Senator Alan Cranston when he viewed the resulting damage. In the past, strong public shock was generated by such events as the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, the 10 March 1933 Long Beach earthquake, and the 27 March 1964 Alaska earthquake. The death and destruction caused by these made strong impressions on the public, but not for long. The shock effect of these events tended to die away quickly and support for increased research to solve earthquake problems was not generated. The passage of the Earthquake <b>Hazards</b> <b>Reduction</b> Act six years after the San Fernando earthquake, demonstrates an aspect of the more informed and longer-lasting interest in the earthquake problem on the part of Congress, State legislatures, and local government agencies...|$|R
