5|$|Arnold's Marsh and {{the other}} lagoons nearest the beach are salty due to the {{percolation}} of seawater through the shingle bank. These saline lagoons may cover mud, firm sand or submerged vegetation, and hold some rare and threatened invertebrates including starlet sea anemone, lagoon sand shrimp, Atlantic ditch shrimp, the mysid shrimps Paramysis nouveli and Neomysis integer, lagoon cockle, the bug Orthotylus rubidus and spire snail. Little whirlpool ramshorn snail {{has been found in}} a freshwater channel. Rare beetles associated with these coastal environments include yellow pogonus, Bembidion <b>ephippium</b> and Tachys scutellaris. These marshes are the only reliable UK site for the Pogonus species, and even here it is localised and hard to find.|$|E
25|$|The {{start of}} van Bruggen's malacological career can be dated back to 1948, {{when he became}} a member of the Dutch Malacological Society (NMV). His first malacological publication, in Dutch, {{appeared}} in 1948 in the Dutch journal De Levende Natuur; a short note reporting a find of the marine bivalve Anomia <b>ephippium,</b> an uncommon species in the Netherlands. His very first publication had appeared earlier in the same year in the same journal; it reported a sighting of seals and a horse mackerel on a Dutch beach.|$|E

The largest species, the lined {{butterflyfish}} and the saddle butterflyfish, C. <b>ephippium,</b> grow to [...] The common name references the brightly coloured and strikingly patterned bodies of many species, bearing shades of black, white, blue, red, orange, and yellow. Other species are dull in colour. Many have eyespots on their flanks and dark bands across their eyes, {{not unlike the}} patterns seen on butterfly wings. Their deep, laterally narrow bodies are easily noticed through the profusion of reef life. The conspicuous coloration of butterflyfish may be intended for interspecies communication. Butterflyfish have uninterrupted dorsal fins with tail fins that may be rounded or truncated, but are never forked.|$|E

60|$|Reptiles.--Reptiles, however, {{which at}} first sight appear as unsuited as mammals to pass over a wide expanse of ocean, abound in the Galapagos, though the species are not very numerous. They consist of land-{{tortoises}}, lizards and snakes. The tortoises consist of two peculiar species, Testudo microphyes, found {{in most of the}} islands, and T. {279} abingdonii recently discovered on Abingdon Island, as well as one extinct species, T. <b>ephippium,</b> found on Indefatigable Island. These are all of very large size, like the gigantic tortoises of the Mascarene Islands, from which, however, they differ in structural characters; and Dr. Günther believes that they have been originally derived from the American continent.[60] Considering the well known tenacity of life of these animals, and the large number of allied forms which have aquatic or sub-aquatic habits, it is not a very extravagant supposition that some ancestral form, carried out to sea by a flood, was once or twice safely drifted as far as the Galapagos, and thus originated the races which now inhabit them.|$|E

50|$|Ephippia (singular: <b>ephippium)</b> are winter or dry-season eggs of {{the various}} species of small {{crustacean}} in the order Cladocera (within the Branchiopoda) are provided with an extra shell layer. The extra layer preserves and protects the resting stages inside from harsh environmental conditions until the more favorable times, such as spring, when the reproductive cycle is able to take place once again. Ephippia {{are part of the}} back of a mother carrying them until they are fully developed. After molting the <b>ephippium</b> stays in the water, or in the soil of dried puddles, small ponds, and vernal pools. The resting stages are often called eggs, but are in fact embryos with arrested development. Ephippia can rest for many years before the embryo resumes development upon an appropriate hatching stimulus.|$|E
50|$|Being {{a member}} of the potter wasp {{subfamily}} (Eumeninae), A. <b>ephippium</b> females build large nests in sheltered positions using mud. The females search for prey (including spiders and caterpillars) around trees and shrubs, before sealing the captured insects inside the nest's cells. The larvae then feed upon these insects, before emerging.|$|E

The adult wasp feeds off flower nectar, while the larvae are fed caterpillars captured by the female.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{other large}} wasps are {{sometimes}} referred to as hornets, most notably the bald-faced hornet (Dolichovespula maculata) found in North America. It is set apart by its black and ivory coloration. The name [...] "hornet" [...] is used for this and related species primarily because of their habit of making aerial nests (similar to the true hornets) rather than subterranean nests. Another example is the Australian hornet (Abispa <b>ephippium),</b> which is actually a species of potter wasp.|$|E
50|$|The Dotted Butterflyfish {{belongs to}} the large {{subgenus}} Rabdophorus which might warrant recognition as a distinct genus. In this group, it appears to represent a distinct lineage, with the Saddle Butterflyfish (C. <b>ephippium)</b> perhaps the only somewhat closely related species. Next closest {{seems to be a}} group including the Black-backed Butterflyfish (C. melannotus), Spot-tailed Butterflyfish (C. ocellicaudus) and Yellow-dotted Butterflyfish (C. selene), but these are already so distant that their ancestors must have diverged from the Saddle Butterflyfish's soon after the Rabdophorus lineage started to diversify.|$|E
