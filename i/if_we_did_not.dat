500|$|By 1792, Lady Charlotte Finch {{had become}} ill and deaf. Princess Sophia remarked that autumn, [...] "I am grieved to death about her, she is if {{possible}} more kind {{to us than}} ever. Indeed, both [...] and her are so good {{to us that we}} should not be deserving of having such treasures about us, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> feel their kindness in the highest degree". Finch resigned from her role in November 1792 and retired on 5 January 1793, though she continued to correspond with {{members of the royal family}} and receive gifts from them, particularly the Prince of Wales, the future George IV. She received £600 in yearly payment, supplemented by income from the South Sea Company, until her death on 11 July 1813 at St James's Palace.|$|E
500|$|The {{role of the}} Italian father Tony {{was played}} by Frank H. Crane. Crane was {{involved}} in the very beginnings of the Thanhouser Company and acted in numerous productions before becoming a director at Thanhouser. In the role of Tony's wife was Anna Rosemond, who was one of two leading ladies for {{the first year of the}} company. Marie Eline, played the role of Tony's son, was concealed in masculine make up and black hair for the role of the Italian boy. The Moving Picture World said, [...] "aybe you'd never recognize her <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> tip you off. Don't pass the tip to others in your place, but see if their little favorite doesn't fool them completely in her masculine makeup." [...] Other members of the cast have not been identified.|$|E
500|$|Early {{reviews of}} [...] "To Autumn" [...] focused {{on it as}} part of Keats's {{collection}} of poems Lamia, Isabella, the Eve of St. Agnes, and Other Poems. An anonymous critic in the July 1820 Monthly Review claimed, [...] "this writer is very rich both in imagination and fancy; and even a superabundance of the latter faculty is displayed in his lines 'On Autumn,' which bring the reality of nature more before our eyes than almost any description that we remember. [...] <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> fear that, young as is Mr K., his peculiarities are fixed beyond all the power of criticism to remove, we would exhort him to become somewhat less strikingly original,—to be less fond of the folly of too new or too old phrases,—and to believe that poetry does not consist in either the one or the other." [...] Josiah Conder in the September 1820 Eclectic Review mentioned, [...] "One naturally turns first to the shorter pieces, in order to taste the flavour of the poetry. The following ode to Autumn is no unfavourable specimen." [...] An anonymous reviewer in The Edinburgh Magazine for October 1820 added to a discussion of some of Keats's longer poems the afterthought that [...] "The ode to 'Fancy,' and the ode to 'Autumn,' also have great merit." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Chinese Confucian thinker Mencius, who 2300 {{years ago}} sought to give {{advice to the}} {{ruthless}} political leaders of the warring states period, {{was convinced that the}} mind played a mediating role between the [...] "lesser self" [...] (the physiological self) and the [...] "greater self" [...] (the moral self) and that getting the priorities right between these two would lead to sage-hood. He argued that <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> feel satisfaction or pleasure in nourishing one's [...] "vital force" [...] with [...] "righteous deeds", that force would shrivel up (Mencius, 6A:15 2A:2).

2500|$|Her {{dramatic}} and unexpected entrance drew stares from {{the residents of}} the courtroom. Victoria Price, brought out for Bates to identify, glared at her. Attorney General Knight warned Price to [...] "keep your temper." [...] Bates proceeded to testify, and explained that no rape had occurred. She said none of the defendants had touched her or even spoken to her. When asked if she had been raped on March 25, 1931, Bates said, [...] "No sir." [...] When asked why she had initially said she had been raped, Bates replied, [...] "I told it just like Victoria did because she said we might have to stay in jail <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> frame up a story after crossing a state line with men." [...] Bates explained that Price had said [...] "she didn't care if all the Negroes in Alabama were put in jail." [...] This recantation seemed to be a severe blow to the prosecution.|$|E
2500|$|While {{recording}} and producing the album, Queen incorporated different musical instruments such as [...] "strings, piano, acoustic ballads and romantic tunes". This {{was an attempt}} to prove that reggaetón is not just its basic rhythm. She explained [...] "many think reggaetón is just nice rhythms to dance to. And they forget there are song-writers and composers, who, like everyone else, also suffer and aspire in love". She said [...] "Love is what makes us write things, what keeps us alive. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> have love, we would have nothing". She acknowledged that the songs on the album were one way she dealt with the end of her eleven-year marriage. The lyrics focus on the experiences she has endured within the couple of years since the release of her previous studio album, which according to Queen were a [...] "tough situation in her personal life". The ballads of the album [...] "cover familiar topics — devotion, heartbreak, hope and reconciliation". Musically, the album alternates between reggaetón, bolero, and salsa.|$|E
2500|$|In Simpson v Attorney-General (Baigent’s Case) (1994) 1 HRNZ 42, the Court of Appeal awarded {{compensation}} {{under the}} Bill of Rights Act 1990. This {{was a new}} remedy under the Act. In this case, the plaintiffs were seeking damages for a search warrant executed on their place of residence that was obtained {{on the basis of}} incorrect information. The police were informed that the warrant was based on false information but they continued with the search nonetheless. The Court of Appeal held that the Court had an inherent jurisdiction to develop remedies under the Bill of Rights Act 1990, and that compensation was an appropriate remedy in this case. Cooke P stated that the court would “fail in our duty <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> give an effective remedy to a person whose legislatively affirmed rights have been infringed.” The Court of Appeal thus held that there is a public law action available against the Crown for a breach of the Bill of Rights Act 1990. It is likely to only be available to those who do not attain a suitable alternative remedy for a breach of the Act.|$|E

2500|$|In April 2007, Ivy Queen {{released}} her sixth studio album entitled Sentimiento. She {{began working on}} the album in 2006 after Cosa Nostra became a commercial failure. As {{a part of her}} evolution in reggaetón, Sentimiento includes [...] "solo turns" [...] instead of duets with guest artists. The solo tracks include; [...] "Pobre Corazón" [...] by Divino, [...] "Manaña Al Despertar" [...] by Baby Rasta and Norieganone of which feature Queen's vocals. She said she wanted to give a 180-degree turn to what people think of reggaetón. She said, [...] "any think reggaetón is just nice rhythms to dance to.

2500|$|The {{review in}} The Times issue of 16 May 1928 began, [...] "Another French detective! We islanders {{might begin to}} feel jealous, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> {{remember}} what a start Poe and Gaboriau gave our neighbours". The review questioned, [...] "whether {{you can make a}} play out of theoretical analysis. The old melodramas based themselves upon passion: then – shall we say with William Gillette's Sherlock Holmes and Sir Gerald du Maurier's Raffles? – personality usurped its place. A pure problem has not the dramatic force of either. If we do not weary of Poirot shooting questions to left and right, Poirot with uplifted finger expounding his views to a half-circle of listeners, it is because Mr. Charles Laughton, {{with a little help from}} the text, makes a personality out of the fat and sentimental little ratiocinator. His Poirot is an admirable comedy sketch, convincingly gallic." [...] The review stated that Lady Tree had no scope within the part given to her to invest the part of Mrs. Ackroyd with personality but [...] "competence was all that was demanded from her, and from the rest of the cast, and it was generally forthcoming. One actor singled out for praise was Henry Daniell for his [...] "imperturbably natural butler" [...] however his [...] "mystery...was not...analysed enough".|$|E
2500|$|The seed of {{the woman}} is predestined to eternal life and the seed of the serpent to damnation. There is neither choice nor chance in this. It was God's purpose from the {{foundation}} of the world. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> know this of God, we would know nothing of God and would attribute everything to our own natures. [...] "Here reason keeps a great clamour, and saith, doth God make man to damn him?" [...] Tomkinson replies with the old story of the pots discussing their potter. Thus, repentance is a sign of God's grace working, not what calls forth the grace in the first place. People are not their own saviours because their efforts are always inadequate to the task. Those who live by good works and piety will get only the rewards of the law. On the other hand, what is in a person's heart is put there by God. Reason is at a loss here because it seems that God's requirements are so demanding, no one could satisfy them. Tomkinson retorts, [...] "But what has God taken from you that has so weakened you?" [...] Which is why Jesus came to call sinners, not the righteous. He gives the example of Mary Magdalen.|$|E

2500|$|Following {{the success}} of Queen's fifth studio album in 2005 in the Latin market, she began working on her sixth studio album in 2006. She {{wanted to create a}} new album with more slower and romantic reggaetón. This stemmed from Queen divorcing her husband of nine years and {{releasing}} all of her anger on Flashback. Not wanting to go into detail, she [...] "acknowledged the songs were just one way she dealt with the end of an 11-year relationship". On the album, as a part of her evolution in reggaetón, she includes [...] "solo turns", instead of duets by guest artist. Of the solo tracks on the album is [...] "Pobre Corazón" [...] by Divino while others include [...] "Manaña Al Despertar" [...] by Baby Rasta and Noriega where the artist performed songs without vocals by Ivy Queen. She said she wanted to give a 180-degree turn to what people think of reggaetón. She explained [...] "Many think reggaetón is just nice rhythms to dance to. And they forget there are song-writers and composers, who, like everyone else, also suffer and aspire in love". She wanted the album to be about that. She said [...] "Love is what makes us write things, what keeps us alive. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> have love, we would have nothing".|$|E
2500|$|Comey also {{testified that}} Ashcroft [...] "expressed himself in very strong terms." [...] Goldsmith testified that Ashcroft spoke {{at length about}} the legal issue. [...] "Attorney General Ashcroft… [...] a couple of minutes' speech {{in which he said}} that he…. shared the Justice department's concerns." [...] Although he was not present for the {{conversation}} between Gonzales and Ashcroft, FBI Director Bob Mueller testified, [...] "Ashcroft complained to Judge Gonzales about White House compartmentalization rules preventing Ashcroft from getting the advice he needed." [...] On July 24, 2007, Gonzales testified that he and Card were also concerned about Ashcroft's competency. [...] "Obviously there was concern about General Ashcroft's condition. [...] And we would not have sought nor did we intend to get any approval from General Ashcroft if in fact he wasn't fully competent to make the decision." [...] In response to a question from Senator Hatch, Gonzales continued, [...] "Obviously we were concerned about the condition of General Ashcroft. [...] We obviously knew he had been ill and had surgery. [...] And we never had any intent to ask anything of him <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> feel that he was competent. [...] When we got there, I will just say that Mr. Ashcroft did most of the talking. [...] We were there maybe five minutes – five to six minutes.

2500|$|In May 2013, {{two years}} after the {{assassination}} of Osama bin Laden, Barack Obama delivered a speech that employed the term global war on terror put in quotation marks (as officially transcribed by the White House): ″Now, make no mistake, our nation is still threatened by terrorists. <...> But {{we have to recognize that}} the threat has shifted and evolved from the one that came to our shores on 9/11. <...> From our use of drones to the detention of terrorist suspects, the decisions that we are making now will define the type of nation [...] — [...] and world [...] — [...] that we leave to our children. [...] So America is at a crossroads. [...] We must define the nature and scope of this struggle, or else it will define us. [...] We have to be mindful of James Madison’s warning that “No nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare.” [...] <...> In Afghanistan, we will complete our transition to Afghan responsibility for that country’s security. <...> [...] Beyond Afghanistan, we must define our effort not as a boundless “global war on terror,” but rather as a series of persistent, targeted efforts to dismantle specific networks of violent extremists that threaten America. [...] In many cases, this will involve partnerships with other countries.″ Nevertheless, in the same speech, in a bid to emphasise the legality of military actions undertaken by the U.S., noting that Congress had authorised the use of force, he went on to say, ″Under domestic law, and international law, the United States is at war with al Qaeda, the Taliban, and their associated forces. [...] We are at war with an organization that right now would kill as many Americans as they could <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> stop them first.
