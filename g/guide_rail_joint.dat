40|$|Dynamic {{phenomena}} such as transient and steady-state resonant vibrations in vertical {{transportation systems}} {{deployed in the}} modern built environment and underground mining applications affect {{the performance of the}} entire installation. In extreme high rise structures and deep underground mines traction drive elevator systems and drum-driven lifting installations employ long ropes and cables that exhibit low-frequency modes and nonlinear modal interactions. This results in the need to develop mathematical models in order to simulate their dynamic behaviour to predict and control their non-linear stationary and non-stationary dynamic responses; the coupled vibrations of a car/ conveyance and counterweight; as well as motions of other components present in the system, such as compensating sheave assemblies and diverter pulleys. The underlying causes of these dynamic responses / vibrations are varied. They include low frequency sway motions of the host structure induced by high winds and seismic activities, poorly aligned <b>guide</b> <b>rail</b> <b>joints</b> and <b>guide</b> <b>rail</b> imperfections, eccentric / out-of-balance pulleys and sheaves, systematic resonance in the electronic drive control system, motor torque ripple and aerodynamic effects that occur in the hoistway. Consequently, conditions for external, parametric and autoparametric resonances can readily arise during the operation of such installations. In this context, this paper will demonstrate a general approach to model the dynamic behaviour of typical vertical transportation and lifting installations. Subsequently, dynamic models and simulation techniques for the prediction of their non-stationary / nonlinear dynamic responses are discussed and the effectiveness of these techniques are demonstrated. Then, suitable strategies can be proposed to minimize the effects of adverse dynamic responses of the system so that the installation can operate under these conditions safely...|$|R

3000|$|Enormous {{work has}} been done to explore the {{influence}} of magnetic field inhomogeneity due to joint gaps. Okano [...] et al. (2004) and Lin et al. (2011) calculated the magnetic field inhomogeneity between two segments of the conventional unimodal magnetic rail and put forward some improvement countermeasures. The cost of the Halbach-type magnetic rail is just about 38  % of that of conventional unimodal magnetic rail per kilometer (Wang et al. 2002 and Del-Valle et al. 2011), while the levitation efficiency (N/cm 3) is about 2.85 times larger (Deng et al. 2008), and thus has been widely used or reformed for the maglev applications (Guo et al. 2010; Deng et al. 2013; Boughrara et al. 2013).

30|$|An ideal {{magnetic}} rail {{should provide}} a homogeneous magnetic field along the longitudinal direction to guarantee the reliable friction-free operation of high temperature superconducting (HTS) maglev vehicles. But in reality, magnetic field inhomogeneity may occur due to lots of reasons; the joint gap is the most direct one. Joint gaps inevitably exist between adjacent segments and influence the longitudinal magnetic field homogeneity above the rail since any magnetic rails are consisting of many permanent magnet segments. To improve the running performance of maglev systems, two new <b>rail</b> <b>joints</b> are proposed based on the normal <b>rail</b> <b>joint,</b> which are named as mitered <b>rail</b> <b>joint</b> and overlapped <b>rail</b> <b>joint.</b> It is found that the overlapped <b>rail</b> <b>joint</b> has a better effect to provide a competitive homogeneous magnetic field. And the further structure optimization {{has been done to}} ensure maglev vehicle operation as stable as possible when passing through those joint gaps. The results show that the overlapped <b>rail</b> <b>joint</b> with optimal parameters can significantly reduce the magnetic field inhomogeneity comparing with the other two <b>rail</b> <b>joints.</b> In addition, an appropriate gap was suggested when balancing the thermal expansion of magnets and homogenous magnetic field, which is considered valuable references for the future design of the magnetic rails.|$|R
30|$|From {{the above}} analysis, it {{points out that}} the {{magnetic}} field above the normal <b>rail</b> <b>joint</b> is not homogeneous, and this magnetic field inhomogeneity will affect running performance of the levitated vehicle.

These structural components were designed to provide sufficient lateral support to redirect impacting vehicles and compress the energy-absorbing elements of the crash cushion. The primary design criteria stated that the diaphragm/guide rail system should be capable of withstanding a 100 -kip lateral impact load. The <b>guide</b> <b>rail</b> was to be configured in order to not require replacement after a design impact event. Initial design and modeling resulted in two candidates for <b>guide</b> <b>rail</b> sections which were evaluated during physical testing. The better of the two candidates was then paired with a prototype diaphragm and subjected to dynamic testing. The first prototype was found to develop a maximum resistive force of 175 kips, and the diaphragm <b>guide</b> <b>rail</b> absorbed a total of 822 kip-in. of energy but sustained significant <b>guide</b> <b>rail</b> damage. An extensive computer modeling effort was initiated to optimize both the diaphragm and the <b>guide</b> <b>rails.</b> The structural capacity of the optimized prototype diaphragm and <b>guide</b> <b>rail</b> system was verified through a dynamic bogie test.

40|$|<b>Rail</b> <b>joints</b> have {{a shorter}} service life {{than most other}} railway track components.

Moreover, difficulties are often found when assessing the damage condition of <b>rail</b> <b>joints</b> since damage conditions like cracks in the rail web or loose bolts cannot be detected by visual inspection. A {{better understanding of the}} damage mechanisms and degradation process of <b>rail</b> <b>joints</b> may help to develop adapted maintenance measures and to improve <b>rail</b> <b>joint</b> design.

In the paper, the influence of the bolt tightness is studied.
