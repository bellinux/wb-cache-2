25|$|Fejes Tóth met {{his wife}} in university. She was a chemist. They were parents of three children, two sons—one a {{professor}} of mathematics at the Alfréd Rényi Institute of Mathematics, the other a professor of physiology at Dartmouth College—and one daughter, a psychologist. He enjoyed sports, being skilled at table tennis, tennis, and gymnastics. A family photograph shows him swinging by <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> {{the top of a}} high bar when he was around fifty.|$|E
60|$|But {{the strange}} man who stood before him folded <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> his breast.|$|E
60|$|The Judge put {{his heels}} {{on the window}} sill, and folded <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> the problem.|$|E
60|$|The bishop {{sat with}} <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> {{the back of}} his chair, and his face downcast.|$|R
60|$|Patsey {{said that}} he did hear; and then Owen, {{throwing}} <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> the earl's shoulder, walked slowly towards the house.|$|R
60|$|And {{there on}} the landing she saw him {{standing}} in the darkness with <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> face, as if fending a blow.|$|R
60|$|ANNA--[Taking one of <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> her shoulder.] Come {{on in the}} cabin. You {{can have}} my bed if there ain't no other place.|$|E
60|$|He said nothing, but hid {{his face}} in <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> the rail of the bower. At length {{he looked up at}} me fiercely.|$|E
60|$|Father Benwell folded <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> his breast--looked with {{immovable}} resolution {{straight in}} Romayne's face--and struck the blow {{which he had}} been meditating for months past.|$|E
60|$|Dancing {{close up}} to him, Ted Flaggan {{suddenly}} slipped, and, staggering as if about to fall, flung <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> the consul's shoulder.|$|R
60|$|The Dahcotah threw <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> the {{shoulder}} of the old man, with an air of great affection, before he replied to this third and last demand.|$|R
6000|$|... "Because I can't bear to cut Hal out!" [...] said Sam, putting <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> eyes, {{as a way}} he {{considered}} secret of disposing of his tears.|$|R
60|$|With <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> his face, {{he pushed}} forward once more, not knowing whether {{he might be}} {{retracing}} his steps, or proceeding in the proper direction.|$|E
6000|$|... "Phew! but aint it cold!" [...] exclaimed Tom, {{dancing around}} and {{slapping}} <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> his chest. [...] "I wonder how Nellie and Grace Laning like this?" ...|$|E
60|$|Maurice paused: once more, with {{a gesture}} {{habitual}} to him, he crossed <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> his chest and resumed his restless march {{up and down the}} narrow room.|$|E
60|$|Lying {{back in his}} seat, he {{extended}} <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> the table and pushed the watch away slightly. Captain Mitchell walked up with undisguised eagerness, put it to his ear, then slipped it into his pocket coolly.|$|R
60|$|He {{smiled at}} her and put <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> her shoulder. Together they walked up the golden arcade to tell the others. That night Charlotte and Ellen cried with {{happiness}} as they talked it over in the twilight.|$|R
6000|$|The doctor pulled <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> {{eyes and}} sat down again. Presently he was saying with a long face: [...] "I came here to {{denounce}} the cause of your unhappiness, and I begin to see it is myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|To the {{surprise}} of the Interpreter, Mark Breezy crossed <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> his breast, and firmly said--"No!" [...] Swiftly understanding his motive, our seaman and Ebony followed suit with an equally emphatic, [...] "No!" ...|$|E
60|$|Paul Ruttledge. Many will forsake {{the truth}} {{before the world}} is pulled down. [Stretching out <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> his head.] I pulled down my own house, now I go out to pull down the world.|$|E
60|$|When {{she could}} lie still {{she turned away}} from him, still mute. And he lay with <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> her, motionless. Noises went on, in the street, {{overhead}} in the work-room. But theirs was complete silence.|$|E
6000|$|... "You bet I do!" [...] he returned, {{and then}} put <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> her {{shoulder}} and kissed her gently. [...] "Well, let us hope it all comes out for the best," [...] he added, and walked off to go to work.|$|R
60|$|Rasmunsen {{had managed}} to draw his revolver, and with the crook of <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> the sweep head, was taking aim. The {{correspondent}} stood up on the thwart, balancing back and forth, his face twisted with menace and speechless anger.|$|R
6000|$|... "You did {{not know}} what you secured me. How could you choose my {{birthright}} for me?" [...] said Deronda, throwing himself sideways into his chair again, almost unconsciously, and leaning <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> the back, while he looked away from his mother.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No! no!' still stoutly {{said the}} {{constant}} Maurice. 'I don't want new guns; I've got my dear old one, and I'll keep {{him to the}} end of his days and mine!' and he crossed <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> it.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Now, gentlemen,' said Mr Gregsbury, {{tossing a}} great bundle of papers into a wicker basket at his feet, and {{throwing}} himself {{back in his}} chair with <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> the elbows, 'you are dissatisfied with my conduct, I see by the newspapers.' ...|$|E
60|$|FERRAND. [Brushing <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> his eyes.] Pardon, Monsieur--your goodness--I am {{a little}} weak. [He opens his coat, and shows a belt drawn very tight over his ragged shirt.] I tighten him one hole for each meal, during two days now. That gives you courage.|$|E
6000|$|The king {{laughed and}} laughed. He laid <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> Beppo's shoulder, {{and again he}} whispered in his ear: [...] "A word, a word, only a few words; if they be spoken ill, they are ill; if they be spoken well, they are more {{precious}} than gold and jewels." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let us {{understand}} each other, my very dear friend Berwick," [...] said his companion, {{and he threw}} <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> {{the back of his}} chair and looked the Roman full in his face. [...] "You say you have been at Paris and elsewhere, and have seen everybody and heard every thing?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Here, steady a bit!" [...] {{said the}} man at the gate, gravely {{stretching}} <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> and catching him by the sleeve. [...] "Somebody's been trying to get at you. Hallo! what's this rig you've got on? Storm canvas, by George!" [...] He had a big laugh. [...] "Well, you are a character!" ...|$|R
60|$|Martin-Roget crossed <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> {{his broad}} chest and {{clutched}} his elbows {{with his hands}} with an obvious effort to keep control over his movements and his temper in check. The quiet, almost indifferent attitude of the girl was exasperating to his over-strung nerves.|$|E
60|$|But {{they were}} not yet done with the shore and {{the horror of the}} yellow flag. About midway of the pass there was a cry and a scurry, a man was seen to leap upon the rail, and, {{throwing}} <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> his head, to stoop and plunge into the sea.|$|E
60|$|I {{slid down}} the rubbish, {{struggled}} to my feet, clapped my hands over my ears, and bolted into the scullery. The curate, who had been crouching silently with <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> his head, looked up as I passed, cried out quite loudly at my desertion of him, and came running after me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't lie on {{that cold}} stone, Ben; {{come here and}} {{let me try to}} comfort you," [...] she said, stooping to wipe away the great drops that kept rolling down the brown cheek half hidden in her dress. But Ben put <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> face, and sobbed out with a fresh burst of grief,-- ...|$|R
60|$|The Speaker listened patiently, {{one long}} finger against his cheek. The clerks bowed over the papers. The honourable Member's two colleagues listened like men under an anæsthetic, each sideways, each with <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> {{the back of}} the seat. Across the House one Member was furtively writing a letter and three others were {{whispering}} together.|$|R
60|$|At {{the arrival}} of Miller on the scene Wetzel had changed his {{position}} to one nearer the crowd. The dog, Tige, trotted closely at his heels. No one heard Tige's low growl or Wetzel's stern word to silence him. Throwing <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> Betty's pony, Wetzel apparently watched the shooters. In reality he studied intently Miller's every movement.|$|R
