5|$|The {{award was}} first {{presented}} as a tie between Michel Camilo and Tomatito for Spain and Paquito D'Rivera for Tropicana Nights. D'Rivera holds the record for most wins as performer in this category, with six (including one awarded as the Paquito D'Rivera Quintet) out of eight nominations. Bebo Valdés won the award twice for albums which also earned the Grammy Award: Bebo de Cuba received the Best Traditional Tropical Latin Album accolade in 2005, while Juntos Para Siempre, by Bebo and Chucho Valdés won for Latin Jazz Album in 2010. Bebo and Chucho Valdés, Camilo, Gonzalo Rubalcaba, and Arturo Sandoval have twice been awarded. In 2012, the award was given to Sandoval for the album Dear Diz (Every Day <b>I</b> <b>Think</b> <b>of</b> You), which was also nominated for Album of the Year. Since its inception, the award has been presented to musicians or ensembles originating from Brazil, Cuba, Dominican Republic, United States, and Spain.|$|E
5|$|Coinciding {{with the}} release of his Letters and Speeches of Oliver Cromwell in 1845, Thomas Carlyle was asked to view the head. He did not, and {{on the basis of a}} friend's visit, wrote a scathing {{dismissal}} of the authenticity of the head: “it has hair, flesh and beard, a written history bearing that it was procured for £100 (<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> bad debt) about 50 years ago...the whole affair appears to be fraudulent moonshine, an element not pleasant even to glance into, especially in a case like Oliver's.” Fitzgibbons 2008, Pearson and Morant agree that Carlyle's dismissal was not based on any historical or scientific fact. Although Carlyle conceded that it was “the head of some decapitated man of distinction”, the only other known man of distinction to be embalmed and then decapitated in such a manner over the previous 200 years was Henry Ireton. George Rolleston had conducted an examination on another skull—called the Ashmolean skull—after claims that it was Cromwell's head. Rolleston was unconvinced by the skull's supposed history, and visited Wilkinson's home to see the skull shortly afterwards. After an examination, he dismissed the Ashmolean skull as a fake and declared that the Wilkinson head was the real head of Cromwell.|$|E

25|$|I must, however, {{make clear}} what I mean by Judaism; I mean neither a race nor a people nor a {{recognised}} creed. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it as a {{tendency of the}} mind, as a psychological constitution which is a possibility for all mankind, but which has become actual in the most conspicuous fashion only amongst the Jews. Antisemitism itself will confirm my point of view.|$|E

25|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> Ligonier as {{a moment}} in the history of Orthodoxy in North America when a love for the missionary mandate of the Gospel transcended ethnic and {{cultural}} barriers and concerns. Ligonier provided a venue where Orthodox bishops offered words and visions of ecclesial unity. Ten years ago, the prophetic spirit of Ligonier stood opposed to jurisdictional pluralism even when other hierarchs, here and abroad, sought to justify the uncanonical status quo. Ten years ago, the bishops of Ligonier expressed a oneness of mind which exposed the falsehood that jurisdictional pluralism does not impede Eucharistic unity when, in fact, the presence of two or more bishops in one city undermines the very reality of ecclesial and, therefore, Eucharistic unity.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{everybody}} pays him homage. I nearly blow my top. I {{can still}} hear {{the way he was}} whistled when he rode. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> the organisers of the Tour, who shortened the time trial to make him lose. His home town of Rouen organises commemorations but, me, I haven't forgotten that it was in Antwerp that he made his farewell appearance. More than once, I saw him crying in his hotel room after suffering the spitting and insults of spectators. People said he was cold, a calculator, a dilettante. The truth is that Jacques was a monster of courage. In the mountains, he suffered as though he was damned. He wasn't a climber. But with bluffing, with guts, he tore them to shreds (il les a tous couillonnés).|$|E
25|$|For myself, I am now in my 63rd year, yet my {{constitution}} is not seriously impaired, {{as you may}} conclude when I mention that I still am able to skate, to play at cricket occasionally with my sons, and that last year I rowed with them upon the Tay, a distance of eight miles, as stroke of a Four-oar? Nor when <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> others whom I knew {{as a young man}} at both Universities, can I remember any instance of injury being done to the health which could fairly be set down to the exercise of rowing as then practised. It is true we used to be told, even in those days, that no man in a Racing-Boat could expect to live to the age of thirty.|$|E

500|$|Clarke {{has been}} {{described}} by Stephen Banfield as the most distinguished British female composer of the inter-war generation. However, her later output was sporadic. She suffered from dysthymia, a chronic form of depression; the lack of encouragement—sometimes outright discouragement—she received for her work also made her reluctant to compose. Clarke did not consider herself able to balance her personal life and the demands of composition: [...] "I can't do it unless it's the first thing <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> every morning when I wake and the last thing <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> every night before I go to sleep." [...] After her marriage, she stopped composing, despite the encouragement of her husband, although she continued working on arrangements until shortly before her death. She also stopped performing.|$|E

500|$|Control was {{declared}} [...] "remarkably nervy and mature" [...] for a teenage act, also considered [...] "an {{alternative to the}} sentimental balladry" [...] which permeated radio, likening Jackson to Donna Summer's position of [...] "unwilling to accept novelty status and taking her own steps to rise above it." [...] The album spawned five top five singles, [...] "What Have You Done for Me Lately", [...] "Nasty", [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>Think</b> <b>of</b> You", [...] "Control", and [...] "Let's Wait Awhile", and a top fifteen hit with [...] "The Pleasure Principle". [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>Think</b> <b>of</b> You" [...] became her first number one hit on the Hot 100. Control received six Billboard Awards, including [...] "Top Pop Singles Artist", and three Grammy nominations, most notably [...] "Album of the Year". It also won four American Music Awards from twelve nominations, an unbroken record. At this point, Jackson was successfully [...] "shaking off {{the experience of being}} a shadow Jackson child", becoming [...] "an artist in her own right".|$|E
