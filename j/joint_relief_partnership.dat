40|$|Problem: The Ishinomaki Red Cross Hospital is {{the only}} {{designated}} disaster hospital in the Ishinomaki Medical Zone, Japan that was undamaged from the Great East Japan Earthquake in March 2011. The tsunami completely destroyed {{a large part of}} the Ishinomaki Medical Zone. Context: The Ishinomaki Red Cross Hospital was designed with the capability to respond to disasters. An instruction manual for responding to disasters had been developed and was exercised through drills. Action: In accordance with the manual, the hospital disaster task force was established. The Ishinomaki Zone <b>Joint</b> <b>Relief</b> Team coordinated medical support from organizations such as physicians associations, dental associations, self-defence forces medical teams, pharmacists associations, the Japanese Red Cross and relief teams from hospitals all over the country. In three days, the <b>joint</b> <b>relief</b> team directly visited all emergency shelters to make an initial assessment and to collect information about the number and state of health of evacuees, provision of food and drinking water and the availability of electricity, water and sewerage. Outcome: Initial assessment revealed that 35 emergency shelters lacked a sufficient food supply and that 100 shelters had unsanitary conditions. The <b>joint</b> <b>relief</b> team provided the Miyagi Prefecture government and the Ishinomaki municipal government with information about emergency shelters that did not have a sufficient food supply. As of 30 September, the activities of the <b>joint</b> <b>relief</b> teams were completed, and there was no outbreak of communicable diseases in the Ishinomaki Medical Zone. A total of 328 shelters with 46 480 evacuees were managed by the Ishinomaki Zone <b>Joint</b> <b>Relief</b> Team. Discussion: Advanced preparation to quickly establish an initial response system, expertise, and decision-making ability and the ability to get things done are required for disaster response management...|$|R

50|$|In 1999, {{the evening}} when NATO’s {{intervention}} against Yugoslavia began, Serb police and the paramilitary began to set fire around the mosque complex. The fire {{caused a lot of}} damage to the complex. The library, the religious school, the wooden portico were burned down, and the mosque’s minaret was shot off. The library used to contain books and manuscripts that were hundreds of years old. These manuscripts contained the history of the mosque. As if this religious site had not suffered enough damages, in 2000 the Saudi <b>Joint</b> <b>Relief</b> Committee received permission to restore the complex. The “restoration” began with bulldozing of the already damaged library and religious school. The aim of this “restoration” was to clear all the buildings around the mosque and to build a new religious center. In 2000 the restoration project started, but because of the difficulties in finding skilled craftsmen and good material the restoration stopped in 2002. In 2003 Cultural Heritage without Borders, asked by KCHP, took over the restoration of the Hadum Mosque. The implementation phase included the restoration of the damaged minaret, dome, portico, windows, façades and the building of the library. This processes finished in 2005.|$|R

50|$|Bismarck had {{originally}} dismissed the agitation for colonies with contempt; he favoured a Eurocentric foreign policy, as the treaty arrangements made {{during his tenure}} in office show. As a latecomer to colonization, Germany repeatedly came into conflict with the established colonial powers and also with the United States, which opposed German attempts at colonial expansion in both the Caribbean and the Pacific. Native insurrections in German territories received prominent coverage in other countries, especially in Britain; the established powers had dealt with such uprisings decades earlier, often brutally, and had secured firm control of their colonies by then. The Boxer Rising in China, which the Chinese government eventually sponsored, began in the Shandong province, in part because Germany, as colonizer at Kiautschou, was an untested power and had only been active there for two years. Eight western nations, including the United States, mounted a <b>joint</b> <b>relief</b> force to rescue westerners {{caught up in the}} rebellion; and during the departure ceremonies for the German contingent, Wilhelm II urged them to behave like the Hun invaders of continental Europe - an unfortunate remark that would later be resurrected by British propagandists to paint Germans as barbarians during World War I and World War II. On two occasions, a French-German conflict over the fate of Morocco seemed inevitable.|$|R

After transferring to Okinawa, Japan in 2004, then Commander Davis was deployed to Sri Lanka for the 2004 tsunami relief effort where the group from 3d Force Service Support Group (now 3d Marine Logistics Group) was sent to Point Pedro, Sri Lanka near the Tamil Tiger/Government civil war truce line. In late 2005, Davis was Chief of Professional Services for the <b>joint</b> <b>relief</b> effort in Shinkiari in the Northwest Frontier Province of Pakistan after the earthquake which killed approximately 73,000 victims. Additionally, in the spring of 2006, Davis led the medical relief effort in Java, Indonesia following the earthquake in that area.

40|$|This paper investigates {{experimentally}} a tubular bonded butt specimen {{with relief}} grooves carved {{close to the}} adherend-adhesive interface. The specimen is {{used to assess the}} strength of a thin adhesive layer, as usually occurs in structural bonded joints. Hence, this configuration overcomes the problems related to the differences in chemical and mechanical properties which could occur in bulk adhesive tests. The aim is to verify experimentally the reduction of the stress concentrations at the interface given by the presence of the grooves, observed in a previous numerical work of the authors. Finite element analyses show that the groove geometry adopted here, although slightly simplified with respectto the optimum shape previously proposed, produces a strong reduction of the edge effects. This work performs an indirect assessment by comparing tensile strength of bonded specimens with and without relief grooves. A two-level factorial experimental campaign is performed, according to Design of Experiment criteria. The variables are: presence of the grooves, adherends material, and adhesive thickness. The response of the tests is the maximum tensileload carried by the specimen which is found to depend strongly on the adherends’ materials. In the case of steel <b>joints,</b> the <b>relief</b> grooves near the adherend-adhesive interface lead to higher loads regardless of the adhesive thickness. In the case of aluminium <b>joints</b> the <b>relief</b> grooves play a minor role, while tensile strength decreases as the adhesive thickness increases...|$|R

Some medicines used for <b>joint</b> pain <b>relief</b> such as NSAIDs have substantial and frequent side effects.

Throughout history, plants have been the most important sources of medicines for human health and Iranian Traditional Medicine (ITM) is well known for its extensive use of herbal medicines to treat diseases accompanied with joint pain for centuries. In the present study, the plants used topically for relieving joint pain in ITM were searched. Moreover, their pharmacological effectiveness in modern medicine was reviewed.
