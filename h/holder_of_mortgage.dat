The execution based on the agreement to sell the property on Parate Executie. 2. 	The execution based on executorial title that provided in the mortgage certificate. 3.

50|$|Meanwhile, {{with the}} farm economy {{going into a}} tailspin {{starting}} in 1981, Norwest began feeling the effects of its heavy farm loan portfolio--$1.2 billion, or seven percent of its overall loan portfolio. Norwest had another $1.2 billion in loans in foreign markets, which caused additional problems in the early 1980s as Norwest, like most U.S. banks, had made many bad loans overseas. As a result, Norwest saw its non-performing loans increase 500 percent from 1983 to 1984, to more than $500 million. Further trouble came from the bank's mortgage unit, Norwest Mortgage Inc., which had been quickly built into the second largest <b>holder</b> <b>of</b> <b>mortgages</b> in the United States. In the summer <b>of</b> 1984, Norwest <b>Mortgage</b> lost nearly $100 million from an unsuccessful effort to hedge its mounting interest-rate risk on adjustable-rate mortgages.

40|$|All <b>holders</b> <b>of</b> <b>mortgage</b> contracts, {{regardless}} <b>of</b> type, {{have three}} options: keep their payments current, prepay (usually through refinancing), or default on the loan. The latter two options terminate the loan. The termination rates <b>of</b> subprime <b>mortgages</b> that originated {{each year from}} 2001 through 2006 are surprisingly similar: about 20, 50, and 80 percent, respectively, at one, two, and three years after origination. For loans originated when house prices appreciated the most, terminations were dominated by prepayments. For loans originated when the housing market slowed, defaults dominated. The similarity of the loan termination rates for all vintages in the sample suggests that subprime mortgage loans were intended to be "bridge" (i. e., temporary) loans. In addition, between 2001 and 2006, the number of terminated subprime purchase-money loans (loans used to purchase rather than refinance a house) outweighed the estimated number of first-time-homebuyers with subprime <b>mortgages.</b> The effect <b>of</b> the subprime lending on the increase of homeownership in the United States-a potentially positive outcome of subprime mortgages-most likely has been overstated.

5000|$|Real {{estate is}} one field where {{the chain of}} title has {{considerable}} significance. Various registration systems, such as the Torrens title system, {{have been developed to}} track the ownership of individual pieces of real property. In real estate transactions in the United States, insurance companies issue title insurance based upon the chain of title to the property when it is transferred. Title insurance companies sometimes maintain private title plants that track real estate titles in addition to the official records. In other cases, the chain of title is established by an abstract of title, sometimes, although not always, certified by an attorney. In the United States, some <b>holders</b> <b>of</b> <b>mortgage</b> debt may be unable to establish chain of title, despite the fact that clear chain of title can be required by the mortgage holder before foreclosure can proceed. Widespread lack of clarity in chain of title results from a 1995 decision by many lenders to rely on a third entity—often, a specific company, Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems (MERS)--to hold title nominally, in an effort to enable the buying and selling <b>of</b> <b>mortgage</b> liabilities without registration of changes of ownership with local governments.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} arguments in favour of price stability is that unexpected inflation generates changes in the distribution of income and wealth among different economic agents. These redistributions occur because many loans are specified in fixed dollar terms and unexpected inflation redistributes wealth from creditors to debtors by reducing the real value of nominal assets and liabilities. This article quantifies the redistributional effects of unexpected inflation in Canada, providing comprehensive evidence of the nominal assets and liabilities of various economic sectors and household groups. A key finding is that the redistributional effects of unexpected inflation are large even with episodes of low inflation. The main winners are young, middle-income households who are major <b>holders</b> <b>of</b> fixed-rate <b>mortgage</b> debt and the government [...] inflation reduces the real burden of their debt. The losers are high-income households and middle-aged, middle-income households that hold long-term bonds and non-indexed pension wealth. ...|$|R
5000|$|Brice {{found his}} break into both the {{business}} and political worlds under unusual circumstances. Around 1880, when his law practice was proving unsuccessful and his mother's home was at risk of foreclosure, Brice wrote to the <b>holder</b> <b>of</b> the <b>mortgage,</b> the then-Governor Charles Foster, and offered to attend to any legal interests he needed help with. Foster declined the legal help, but offered instead to pay Brice five hundred dollars to negotiate a business deal with Wall Street on his behalf. Brice accepted, and proved a shrewd businessman; Foster would later name Brice [...] "the most remarkable man he ever met … the most successful borrower he ever saw." [...] Ignoring Foster's explicit instructions {{for his work on}} the business proceedings in New York and instead following his instincts, Brice returned with a shocking profit of $40,000, and earned the trust and friendship of the Governor.|$|R
50|$|Subordination is also {{an issue}} in the {{priority}} of security interests in the ownership of property. For example, in real estate, mortgages and other liens on the title to secure the payment or repayment of money usually take their priority from the time they attach to the title. The purpose of this ordering of priority is to determine, in a foreclosure resulting from a default, who gets paid first with the sale proceeds from the foreclosure proceeding. Earlier mortgages or other liens are often subordinated by their holders to later ones in order to accomplish agreed-upon ends. An example is for the <b>holder</b> <b>of</b> a <b>mortgage</b> on undeveloped land to subordinate that mortgage to a later construction loan mortgage. The motivation is either the belief that improvement of the land will benefit the first lender or that the first mortgage requires that it be subordinated to a future construction loan.|$|R
50|$|A {{subordination}} {{agreement is}} a legal document {{used to make the}} claim of one party junior to (or inferior to) a claim in favor of another. It is generally used to grant first lien status to a lienholder who would otherwise be secondary to another party, with the approval of the party that would otherwise have first lien. Typically a subordination arises when there are two existing mortgages, a first mortgage and a second mortgage, and the mortgagor intends to refinance the first <b>mortgage.</b> If the <b>holder</b> <b>of</b> the second <b>mortgage</b> does not subordinate the lien <b>of</b> its <b>mortgage</b> to the new mortgage, the new lender will not refinance the first mortgage. However, the second mortgage holder does not want to release its mortgage and re-file, due to additional costs and priority problems, so it will subordinate its lien to the lien <b>of</b> the replacement <b>mortgage.</b>|$|R
40|$|In eras {{of declining}} {{interest}} rates, millions <b>of</b> residential <b>mortgage</b> loans may be refinanced. When this occurs, it is customary for the refinancing lender {{to require a}} title examination and a new mortgagee 2 ̆ 7 s title insurance policy. This requirement is expensive, usually costing several hundred dollars or more, and the cost is invariably paid by the borrower. This Article proposes that {{in the vast majority}} of refinancings this expense can be substantially reduced or even eliminated. This result can be achieved through proper understanding, adoption, and use of the doctrine <b>of</b> equitable <b>mortgage</b> subrogation articulated in the Restatement (Third) <b>of</b> Property: <b>Mortgages.</b> The principle <b>of</b> subrogation comes into play when the proceeds <b>of</b> a new <b>mortgage</b> are used to pay off a preexisting mortgage; it allows the <b>holder</b> <b>of</b> a new <b>mortgage</b> to take the priority <b>of</b> the old <b>mortgage.</b> If subrogation is made available liberally, as the Restatement recommends, it can eliminate the risk that intervening liens, arising between the dates of the original and the refinancing mortgages, will take priority over the refinancing mortgage. Hence, the need for new title insurance protection can be largely or entirely avoided...|$|R
