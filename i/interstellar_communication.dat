50|$|A Bracewell probe is a {{hypothetical}} concept for an autonomous interstellar space probe dispatched {{for the express}} purpose of communication with one or more alien civilizations.

Bracewell in 1960 (see Bracewell probe), and the technical feasibility of this approach was demonstrated by the British Interplanetary Society's starship study Project Daedalus in 1978. Starting in 1979, Robert Freitas advanced arguments for the proposition that physical space-probes are a superior mode of <b>interstellar</b> <b>communication</b> to radio signals.

50|$|Mundane {{science fiction}} focuses on stories set {{on or near}} the Earth, with a {{believable}} use of technology and science as it exists at the time the story is written.

40|$|It {{is often}} {{suggested}} that extraterrestial life sufficiently advanced {{to be capable}} of <b>interstellar</b> travel or <b>communication</b> must be rare, since otherwise we would have seen evidence of it by now. This in turn is sometimes taken as indirect evidence for the improbability of life evolving at all in our universe. A couple of other possibilities seem worth considering. One is that life capable of evidencing itself on interstellar scales has evolved in many places but that evolutionary selection, acting on a cosmic scale, tends to extinguish species which conspicuously advertise themselves and their habitats. The other is that [...] whatever the true situation [...] intelligent species might reasonably worry about the possible dangers of self-advertisement and hence incline towards discretion. These possibilities are discussed here, and some counter-arguments and complicating factors are also considered...|$|R
