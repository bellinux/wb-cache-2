5|$|On December 4, 1946, Harrison set {{out from}} Shanghai with {{approximately}} 50 tonnes of supplies. On this train journey, {{he was to be}} accompanied by a Russian UNRRA worker and Chinese welfare representatives. Due to repeated Kuomintang inspections, the train journey constantly suffered from delays. The first such delay occurred at Nanjing and lasted four days; the second such delay, at Xuzhou, was of equal duration. At one station, the medical supplies were unhooked from the train's <b>engine</b> <b>car</b> and left on a bleak plain. The two UNRRA workers did not have clean water to drink and were forced to boil ditch water which was polluted with human waste. To add to the dire situation, Harrison's blanket and shoes were stolen, and due to the cold, he began to suffer from frostbite. Two weeks after Harrison left Shanghai, his train was permitted to move again, but there were problems still ahead. At each one of the 20 stations en route to Kaifeng, the train was delayed for up to three hours. Upon arrival at Kaifeng, the journey had to be completed by truck and ox cart. After completing one delivery, he returned to Kaifeng to pick up a second load, but could not continue past the Zhangqiu branch of the receiving hospital. Harrison died of exposure on January 10, 1947, near Kaifeng in China, aged 66.|$|E

500|$|The {{experiment}} {{consisted of}} making audio recordings of a Toyota Prius and combustion engine Honda Accord approaching from two directions at [...] {{to assure that}} the hybrid car operated only with its electric motor. Then test subjects in a laboratory listened to the recordings and indicated when they could hear from which direction the cars approached. Subjects could locate the hum of the internal combustion <b>engine</b> <b>car</b> at [...] away, but could not identify the hybrid running in electric mode until it came within , leaving just less than two seconds to react before the vehicle reached their position. In a second trial, the background sounds of two quietly idling combustion engine cars were added to the recordings to simulate the noise of a parking lot. Under this condition, the hybrid needed to be 74 percent closer than the conventional car before the subjects could hear from which direction the cars approached. Subjects could correctly judge the approach of the combustion car when it was about [...] feet away. This result means that under closer to normal environmental noise, a pedestrian {{would not be able to}} correctly determine the hybrid's approach until it was one second away.|$|E

[...] The ship's tenth flight was to be an altitude trial and was scheduled for 17 October. [...] The airship was removed from its shed in the morning but takeoff was delayed {{because one of the}} engines would not start. [...] The delay of two hours while the engine was repaired allowed the morning sun to heat the hydrogen, causing it to expand. [...] This caused the airship to ascend rapidly to , when horrified observers on the ground saw a flame leap out of the forward <b>engine</b> <b>car,</b> causing the explosion of some of the gasbags. [...] Halfway to the ground there was a second explosion, and as the wreckage hit the ground further explosions followed as the fuel tanks ignited. [...] Three survivors were pulled from the blazing wreckage, but two died shortly afterwards and the third died that night in hospital. [...] In all 28 men died, including [...] Pietzker, and the new chief of the Admiralty Aviation Department, Korvettenkapitän Behnisch, the successor to Korvettenkapitän Metzing who had been killed in the L1 on 9 September. [...] The accident was agreed to have been caused by the rapid ascent leading to venting of hydrogen through the relief valves, which in Zeppelins of the period were placed {{at the bottom of the}} bags, without vent trunks to convey any hydrogen let off to the top of the ship. [...] Some of the vented gas was then sucked into the forward <b>engine</b> <b>car,</b> where it was ignited, the fire then spreading to the gasbags.|$|E

2500|$|The Toyota TS030 Hybrid was a Le Mans Prototype 1 (LMP1) {{sports car}} built by Toyota Motorsport GmbH {{and used by}} the {{manufacturer}} in the FIA World Endurance Championship in 2012 and 2013.

Work on designing the car began in late 2010 when early chassis designs were presented to Toyota Motorsport. The project was stopped briefly after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, but the car's building was approved six months later. The TS030 Hybrid featured a Kinetic Energy Recovery System (KERS) regenerative braking device to charge a super capacitor. Its engine, a naturally aspirated petrol [...] V8 power unit, was mounted at a 90 degree angle, produced , and was based on Toyota's Super GT project.|$|E

2500|$|The {{engine was}} {{designed}} by Walter Becchia and Lucien Gerard, with {{a nod to the}} classic BMW boxer motorcycle engine. It was an air-cooled, flat-twin, four-stroke, 375cc engine with pushrod operated overhead valves and a hemispherical combustion chamber. The earliest model developed [...] DIN (6.5kW). A 425cc engine was introduced in 1955, followed in 1968 by a 602cc one giving [...] at 7000rpm. With the 602cc engine, the tax classification of the car changed so that it became a 3CV, but the name remained unchanged. A 435cc engine was introduced {{at the same time to}} replace the 425cc; the 435cc <b>engine</b> <b>car</b> was named 2CV 4 while the 602cc took the name 2CV 6 (a variant in Argentina took the name 3CV). The 602cc engine evolved to the M28 [...] in 1970; this was the most powerful engine fitted to the 2CV. A new 602cc giving [...] at a slower 5,750rpm was introduced in 1979. This engine was less powerful, [...] and more efficient, allowing lower fuel consumption and better top speed, at the price of decreased acceleration. All 2CVs with the M28 engine can run on unleaded petrol.|$|E

2500|$|On 18 January 1913 Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz, Secretary of State of the German Imperial Naval Office, {{obtained}} {{the agreement of}} Kaiser Wilhelm II to a five-year program of expansion of the German [...] naval airship strength. [...] A contract was placed for the first ship on 30 January, one requirement being that the craft should be capable of bombing England. [...] The design was heavily influenced by the naval architect Felix Pietzker, who was an advisor to the German Admiralty Aviation Department. [...] Construction started in May. [...] The length and overall height of the ship were limited {{by the size of}} the Navy's airship shed at Fuhlsbüttel, but Pietzker's proposals enabled the diameter of the airship to be increased without increasing [...] overall height firstly by changing the position of the keel, moving it from outside the main hull structure to within it, and secondly by placing the engine cars closer to the hull. It was powered by four [...] Maybach engines in two engine cars, each car driving a pair of four-bladed propellers which were mounted either side of the envelope via driveshafts and bevel gears. The ship was controlled from a third gondola mounted in front of the forward <b>engine</b> <b>car.</b>|$|E

Repairs were started immediately and the engine functioned on fifteen cylinders {{for the remainder of}} the flight. Four hours after engine 4 failed, engine no. 2 (aft port) was shut down, as one of two bearing cap bolts for the engine failed and the cap fell into the crank case. The cap was removed and the engine was run again, but when the ship was off Cape Juby the second cap broke and the engine was shut down again. The engine was not run again to prevent further damage. [...] With three engines operating at a speed of [...] and headwinds reported over the English Channel, the crew raised the airship in search of counter-trade winds usually found above , well beyond the airship's pressure altitude.
