40|$|Diabetes is {{a common}} and very costly chronic disease. There is broad-based {{agreement}} on how to manage diabetes, yet less than 40 % of adults with diabetes achieve guideline-recommended levels of medical care. We investigate {{the reasons for this}} phenomenon by examining the business case for improved diabetes care {{from the perspective of a}} single <b>health</b> <b>plan</b> (HealthPartners of Minnesota). The potential benefits accruing to a <b>health</b> <b>plan</b> from diabetes disease management include medical care cost savings and higher premiums. The potential costs to the <b>health</b> <b>plan</b> derive from disease management program costs and adverse selection. We find that the implemen-tation of diabetes disease management coincided with large health improvements. For a defined population of diabetes patients, medical care cost savings over several years were small in the closed panel medical group but moderate for the <b>health</b> <b>plan</b> overall. We find evidence that adverse selection and the timing of cost and benefits worsen the <b>health</b> <b>plan</b> business case. In addition, the payment systems, from purchaser to <b>health</b> <b>plan</b> and <b>health</b> <b>plan</b> to provider, are very weakly con-nected to the quality of diabetes care, further weakening the business case. Finally, overlapping provider networks create a public goods externality that limits the health planâ€™s ability to privatel...|$|R
