5|$|He’s {{had a huge}} role in my career. There’s {{no doubt}} about that. I value his opinion. But as a person, Salman has had the biggest impact on my life. I became friends with him when I was young. And his persona is very strong. If <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> look back and see his impact on my life, it’s been tremendous.|$|E
5|$|The idea {{going in}} was to {{juxtapose}} my singing style with a hardcore hip-hop sensibility {{and have the}} finished product still sound like a Madonna record. I began the process by meeting with the hip-hop producers whose work I most admired. It was important, if <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> {{use a variety of}} collaborators, that the end product sound cohesive and thematically whole. I wasn't interested in the variety pack approach.|$|E
25|$|If <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> drink a {{quart of}} blood and, concealing what I had done, come to the {{emergency}} room of any hospital vomiting blood, the behavior of the staff would be quite predictable. If they labeled and treated me as having a bleeding peptic ulcer, I doubt that I could argue convincingly that medical science does not know how to diagnose that condition.|$|E
60|$|Richard left us on {{the very}} next evening to begin his new career, and {{committed}} Ada to my charge with great love for her and great trust in me. It touched me then to reflect, and it touches me now, more nearly, to remember (having what I have to tell) how they both thought of me, even at that engrossing time. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a part of all their plans, for {{the present and the}} future. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> write Richard once a week, making my faithful report of Ada, who <b>was</b> <b>to</b> write to him every alternate day. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> informed, under his own hand, of all his labours and successes; <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> observe how resolute and persevering he would be; <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Ada's bridesmaid when they <b>were</b> married; <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> live with them afterwards; <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> keep all the keys of their house; <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> made happy for ever and a day.|$|R
6000|$|Paul Ruttledge. Oh! <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{not going}} <b>to</b> ask {{the help of}} the Church. But <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> married by what may be as old a {{ceremony}} as yours. What <b>is</b> it <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>to</b> do, Charlie? ...|$|R
5000|$|I dout not bot ye {{understand}} or now (by now) that our secretaree' wyf is dead—and he a suter to M. Flemyng, quha is als meit for hym as <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> paipe! (as fit for him, as <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Pope) ...|$|R
25|$|If <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> {{say that}} the {{so-called}} philosophy of this fellow Hegel is a colossal piece of mystification which will yet provide posterity with an inexhaustible theme for laughter at our times, {{that it is a}} pseudo-philosophy paralyzing all mental powers, stifling all real thinking, and, by the most outrageous misuse of language, putting in its place the hollowest, most senseless, thoughtless, and, as is confirmed by its success, most stupefying verbiage, I should be quite right.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{imperfections}} in the new South Africa where I would have hoped that things would be better, but on balance I think we have basically achieved what we set out to achieve. And if <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> draw balance sheets on where South Africa stands now, I would say that the positive outweighs the negative by far. There is a tendency by commentators across the world to focus on the few negatives which are quite negative, like how are we handling AIDS, like our role vis-à-vis Zimbabwe. But the positives – the stability in South Africa, the adherence to well-balanced economic policies, fighting inflation, doing all the right things in order to lay the basis and the foundation for sustained economic growth – are in place.|$|E
25|$|I thought I {{would write}} Memories and the City in six months, {{but it took}} me one year to complete. And I was working twelve hours a day, just reading and working. My life, because of so many things, was in a crisis; I don’t {{want to go into}} those details: divorce, father dying, {{professional}} problems, problems with this, problems with that, everything was bad. I thought if <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> be weak I would have a depression. But every day I would wake up and have a cold shower and sit down and remember and write, always paying attention to the beauty of the book. Honestly, I may have hurt my mother, my family. My father was dead, but my mother is still alive. But I can’t care about that; I must care about the beauty of the book.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah {{there again}} we are! That's just what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> {{have made him}} do; just where <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> have worked with him and helped." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{little did}} my mither ken [...] The day she cradled me [...] The land <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> travel in, [...] Or the death <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> die."[273] ...|$|R
60|$|This was Messer Astorre Fifanti, the pedant under whom <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> study, {{and with}} whom <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> take up my {{residence}} for some months to come.|$|R
500|$|... "This time as well, I {{would have}} gladly conceded, if <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> believe that {{anyone else in}} the party could gather voter unanimity." ...|$|E
500|$|Barrett said [...] "It's quite nice but I'd be very {{surprised}} if it did anything if <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> drop dead. I don't think it would stand as my last statement." ...|$|E
500|$|Regarding his remix of the album, O'Brien stated, [...] "The band {{loved the}} {{original}} mix of Ten, but were {{also interested in}} what it would sound like if <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> deconstruct and remix it...The original Ten sound is what millions of people bought, dug and loved, so I was initially hesitant to mess around with that. After years of persistent nudging from the band, I was able to wrap my head around the idea of offering it as a companion piece to the original—giving a fresh take on it, a more direct sound." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Dale, I wish to say something," [...] {{he almost}} shouted. [...] "As {{everybody}} here knows, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{the captain of}} the football eleven. What <b>I</b> want <b>to</b> know <b>is,</b> whether <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{the captain of the}} eleven or not. If <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> nothing but a figurehead, why, I'd rather get out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{will have}} no such thing," [...] said Jenkin, [...] "if <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>to</b> go with you. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not the lad to betray any one to the harmanbeck. You must do it by manhood if <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>to</b> go with you. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> sworn <b>to</b> cutter's law, and will sell no man's blood." ...|$|R
6000|$|THOMAS. [Craning.] What's that? If I {{stand up}} to a potty, and he knocks me town, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not <b>to</b> go hollering to other potties <b>to</b> help me; <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>to</b> stand up again; and if he knocks me town properly, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>to</b> stay there, <b>is</b> n't that right? ...|$|R
500|$|So {{has been}} {{described}} as Gabriel's most commercially accessible and least experimental album. Like his previous albums, its basis is in art rock, although on So, Gabriel develops an increased focus on melody and combines this with elements of soul and African music. [...] "With a song like (the previous album's) 'The Rhythm of the Heat' or 'The Family and the Fishing Net', if <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> strum that along on a guitar or piano, the song might not work very well... whereas more of the things on this album do work just as lyric, melody and chords in a more traditional sense." ...|$|E
500|$|HaeB {{resigned}} as editor {{after he was}} hired by the Wikimedia Foundation in July 2011: [...] "It would make it too much of a conflict of interest if <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> continue to make final editorial decisions for a community-run publication." [...] After three interim editors-in-chief, Wikipedia user The ed17 took over in May 2012 as The Signpost eighth editor. He previously edited The Bugle, the publication of the WikiProject dedicated to improving the encyclopedia's military history articles. The International Business Times noted in a 2013 article that The Signpost investigative journalism uncovered a link between the Wiki-PR firm and conflict-of-interest editing on Wikipedia.|$|E
500|$|Raonic embraced {{his role}} as Canada's top singles player, intent on growing the game in Canada. He stated in 2010: [...] "I {{want to make a}} {{difference}} in Canada with [...] I feel if <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> achieve my goals it could make a great difference to the growth of tennis in Canada and help to produce more top players in the future." [...] Before a Davis Cup tie with Japan in 2015, he said: [...] "I'm here because I want to be here. I don't have anybody telling me I need to be here. I want to succeed at this event, and I want to succeed representing Canada." ...|$|E
5000|$|I {{came back}} for a fortnight. The vision {{appeared}} every day, except one Monday February and one Friday February. She repeated to me several times that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> tell the priests they <b>were</b> <b>to</b> build a Chapel there, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> go to the fountain to wash, and that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> pray for sinners. During this fortnight, she told me three secrets which she forbade me to tell anyone. <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> faithful until now.|$|R
6000|$|... "Joan, I {{believe the}} things {{which you have}} said, and now <b>I</b> <b>am</b> glad that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>to</b> march with you to the great warsthat is, if it <b>is</b> with you <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>to</b> march when <b>I</b> go." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> driven <b>to</b> {{emphasis}} by the premonition that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> {{lose one}} of the dollars on the spot.|$|R
500|$|With {{no return}} address, Balzac {{was left to}} reply in the Gazette de France, {{with the hope that}} she would see the notice. She did not, but wrote again in November: [...] "Your soul embraces centuries, monsieur; its {{philosophical}} concepts appear to be the fruit of long study matured by time; yet I am told you are still young. I would like to know you, but feel I have no need to do so. I know you through my own spiritual instinct; I picture you in my own way, and feel that if <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> actually set eyes upon you, I should instantly exclaim, 'That is he!'" ...|$|E
500|$|Years later, Barnes {{wrote about}} the effect this had on his batting style. There was one angle about this change of batting {{position}} that didn't appeal to me. I am, by nature, a forcing batsman. I like to take the shine out of a bowler [...] and I love to hear the ball rattling the pickets, or soaring over the fence... My footwork was quick and I often caused delight by stepping back feet outside the leg stump and square-cutting... If <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> become an Australian Test opening batsman I would have to conform to standard. I would {{have to put up}} the shutters... And so I came to the Second Test in Sydney ready to drape myself in the gloomy colors of a Test opening batsman.|$|E
500|$|... "Beat It" [...] was {{composed}} by Michael Jackson for his Thriller album. Producer Quincy Jones {{had wanted to}} include a rock and roll song in the vein of the Knack's [...] "My Sharona", though Jackson reportedly had never previously shown {{an interest in the}} genre. Jackson later said of [...] "Beat It", [...] "I wanted to write a song, the type of song that I would buy if <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> buy a rock song... That is how I approached it and I wanted the children to really enjoy it—the school children as well as the college students." [...] Jermaine Jackson has suggested the inspiration of [...] "Beat It" [...] and its video came from the Jackson family experiencing gang activity in Gary, Indiana. [...] "From our front window, we witnessed, about three bad rumbles between rival gangs." ...|$|E
60|$|Before night fell, I had {{arranged}} everything. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> buy the next farm from {{the owner of}} the one where Hilda lodged; <b>I</b> <b>was</b> also <b>to</b> learn the rudiments of South African agriculture from him for a valuable consideration; and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> lodge in his house while my own was building. He gave me his views on the cultivation of oats. He gave them at some length--more length than perspicuity. I knew nothing about oats, save that they were employed in the manufacture of porridge--which I detest; but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> near Hilda once more, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> prepared <b>to</b> undertake the superintendence of the oat from its birth to its reaping if only <b>I</b> might <b>be</b> allowed <b>to</b> live so close to Hilda.|$|R
5000|$|Dear Boy was my {{attempt at}} an {{autobiography}} about myself and how lucky <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> have Linda. <b>I</b> never realized how lucky <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> have her until I began writing the song.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mar said I MUST tell! Mar said <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> fin' {{out where}} you get the truly gold! Mar said <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> get you to take me," [...] howled Florry, in an agony of remorse.|$|R
500|$|Bond 25 began {{development}} in early 2016; Mendes stated {{he would not}} be the film's director. In October 2016, Craig stated that he may indeed return for another film, saying, [...] "As far as I'm concerned, I've got the best job in the world. I'll keep doing it as long as I still {{get a kick out of}} it. If <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> stop doing it, I would miss it terribly." [...] Sony Pictures's contract to co-produce the series with MGM and Eon expired with the release of Spectre and the distribution rights to release Bond 25 in cinemas were put up for negotiation, with MGM and Eon only offering a one-film contract. In July 2017 it was announced that the film would be released on 8 November 2019. In August 2017 Craig confirmed that he would reprise his role as Bond.|$|E
500|$|Two years later, Catherine faced a new {{crisis with}} the death of Charles IX at the age of twenty-three. His dying words were [...] "oh, my mother...". The day before he died, he named Catherine regent, since his brother and heir, Henry the Duke of Anjou, was in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, where he had been elected king the year before. However, three months after his {{coronation}} at Wawel Cathedral, Henry abandoned that throne and returned to France in order to become king of France. Catherine wrote to Henry of Charles IX's death: [...] "I am grief-stricken to have witnessed such a scene and the love which he showed me at the end... My only consolation is to see you here soon, as your kingdom requires, and in good health, for if <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> lose you, I would have myself buried alive with you." ...|$|E
500|$|When the two {{began working}} on a song that Stefani stated was too personal, she left to visit Kanal. He played her a track on {{which he had been}} working and which became [...] "Crash", the album's final single. The two tried to write new material, but gave up after two weeks. They did not return to work until six months later, when Stefani began collaborating with other artists, commenting, [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> write the chorus of 'Yesterday' by the Beatles, and that's all I wrote, that would be good enough {{to be part of that}} history." [...] Stefani resumed work with Linda Perry, who invited Dallas Austin, and many other artists, {{including}} Outkast's André 3000, the Neptunes, and Dr. Dre. Stefani announced the album's release in early 2004, marketing it as a [...] "dance record" [...] and a [...] "guilty pleasure".|$|E
60|$|There Joe cut himself short, and {{informed}} me that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> talked <b>to</b> in great moderation, and that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> take a little nourishment at stated frequent times, whether I felt inclined for it or not, and that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> submit myself to all his orders. So I kissed his hand, and lay quiet, while he proceeded to indite a note to Biddy, with my love in it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am, uncle; if {{you will}} point out <b>to</b> me how <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>to</b> pay the rent and stock the farm, and how <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>to</b> carry it on in the {{meantime}} without a knowledge of husbandry." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mamma says <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>to</b> {{act upon}} Mr. Logie's advice; and that, if {{by any means}} {{he should not be}} in a {{position}} <b>to</b> advise me, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>to</b> take your advice, if Mrs. Colomb is dead." ...|$|R
