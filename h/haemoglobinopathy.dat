40|$|The <b>haemoglobinopathies</b> are the commonest single-gene {{disorders}} known, {{almost certainly}} {{because of the}} protection they provide against malaria, as attested {{by a number of}} observations. The geographical distributions of malaria and <b>haemoglobinopathies</b> largely overlap, and microepidemiological surveys confirm the close relationship between them. For two of the commonest disorders, haemoglobin S and alpha(+) -thalassaemia, there is also good clinical evidence for protection against malaria morbidity. However, not all the evidence appears to support this view. In {{some parts of the world}} malaria and <b>haemoglobinopathies</b> are not, and never have been, coexistent. It is also difficult to explain why the majority of <b>haemoglobinopathies</b> appear to be recent mutations and are regionally specific. Here we argue that these apparent inconsistencies in the malaria hypothesis are the result of processes such as genetic drift and migration and of demographic changes that have occurred during the past 10, 000 years. When these factors are taken into account, selection by malaria remains the force responsible for the prevalence of the <b>haemoglobinopathies...</b>|$|R

50|$|The Bohr effect hinges around {{allosteric}} {{interactions between}} the hemes of the haemoglobin tetramer, a mechanism first proposed by Max Perutz in 1970. Haemoglobin exists in two conformations: a high-affinity R state and a low-affinity T state. When oxygen concentration levels are high, as in the lungs, the R state is favored, enabling {{the maximum amount of}} oxygen to be bound to the hemes. In the capillaries, where oxygen concentration levels are lower, the T state is favored, in order to facilitate the delivery of oxygen to the tissues. The Bohr effect is dependent on this allostery, as increases in CO2 and H+ help stabilize the T state and ensure greater oxygen delivery to muscles during periods of elevated cellular respiration. This is evidenced by the fact that myoglobin, a monomer with no allostery, does not exhibit the Bohr effect. Haemoglobin mutants with weaker allostery may exhibit a reduced Bohr effect. For example, in Hiroshima variant <b>haemoglobinopathy,</b> allostery in haemoglobin is reduced, and the Bohr effect is diminished. As a result, during periods of exercise, the mutant haemoglobin has a higher affinity for oxygen and tissue may suffer minor oxygen starvation.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: In 2007 {{neonatal}} screening (NNS) was {{expanded to include}} screening for sickle cell disease (SCD) and beta-thalassaemia. Up until that year no formal recommendations for <b>haemoglobinopathy</b> (carrier) screening existed in the Netherlands. Although it has been subject to debate in the past, preconceptional and prenatal <b>haemoglobinopathy</b> carrier screening {{are not part of}} routine healthcare in the Netherlands. This study aimed to explore the decision-making process of the past: why was the introduction of a screening programme for <b>haemoglobinopathy</b> considered to be untimely, and did ethnicity play a role given the history in other countries surrounding the introduction of <b>haemoglobinopathy</b> screening? DESIGN: A witness seminar was organised, inviting key figures to discuss the decision-making process concerning <b>haemoglobinopathy</b> screening in the Netherlands, thereby adding new perspectives on past events. The transcript was content-analysed. RESULTS: The subject of <b>haemoglobinopathy</b> screening first appeared in the 1970 s. As opposed to a long history of neglect of African-American health in the United States, the heritage of the Second World War influenced the decision-making process in the Netherlands. As a consequence, registration of ethnicity surfaced as an impeding factor. However, overall, official Dutch screening policy was restrained regarding reproductive issues caused by fear of eugenics. In the 1990 s <b>haemoglobinopathy</b> screening was found to be 'not opportune' due to low prevalence, lack of knowledge and fear of stigmatisation. Currently the registration of ethnicity remains on the political agenda, but still proves to be a sensitive subject. DISCUSSION: Carrier screening in general never appeared high on the policy agenda. Registration of ethnicity remains sensitive caused by the current political climate. Complexities related to carrier screening are a challenge in Dutch healthcare. Whether carrier screening will be considered a valuable complementary strategy in the Netherlands, depends partly on participation of representatives of high-risk groups in policy making...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to begin to assess the {{awareness}} and knowledge of sickle-cell amongst carriers and non-carriers in a screened population of primarily African-Caribbean descent. A structured questionnaire containing 10 multiple-choice knowledge questions on sickle-cell was administered by community interviewers of African-Caribbean descent who did not know the respondents' <b>haemoglobinopathy</b> status. The survey took place in Leicester between the advent of selective screening at ante-natal clinics for sickle-cell in 1989 and the appointment of a <b>haemoglobinopathy</b> counsellor in 1993. One hundred and four people whose blood had been tested recently for sickle-cell (50 consecutive carriers and 54 non-carriers tested after the start date of the project) were identified as subjects for interview. Responses were obtained from 24 carriers (two of whom, it transpired, had sickle-cell anaemia) and 31 noncarriers. No significant differences in levels of sickle-cell awareness were found between carriers and non-carriers. Patterns of inheritance and the range of ethnic groups who carry the sickle-cell trait were least understood. Ethically there are grave problems in screening without systematic counselling, but little <b>haemoglobinopathy</b> counselling is undertaken by generic health professionals in the absence of <b>haemoglobinopathy</b> counsellors. There is considerable demand for leaflets and further counselling, though it is felt unlikely that screening in itself contributes much to raising levels of knowledge...|$|E

40|$|The {{success of}} {{prevention}} programs demonstrated {{the importance of}} raising awareness about <b>haemoglobinopathies</b> since the lack of knowledge and awareness about the disorders may serve as barriers to prevention, disclosure of disease status {{as well as to}} testing for <b>haemoglobinopathies.</b> The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the knowledge and attitudes of middle and high school students towards <b>haemoglobinopathies</b> in Hatay, where the disorders are prevalent. This cross-sectional study was conducted on 8 th and 9 th grade students across Hatay including all sub provinces. From May 2012 to December 2012, a total of 1925 students filled the questionnaires which query the knowledge level and attitudes of students by face to face method. Among questions regarding students' knowledge about <b>haemoglobinopathies,</b> the lowest correct response rate was observed in "How do these diseases transmit?" with 31. 8 %, meaning most of the students did not know that the diseases are transmitted by heredity. Significant differences were observed between the correct answer rates of the students and their status of being previously informed. Students who had a diseased person around were having a 2. 597 -fold (95 %CI = 1. 886 - 3. 575); students possessing at least one parent at secondary education level or above were having a 1. 954 -fold higher probability of being previously informed (95 %CI = 1. 564 - 2. 443). Due to the lack of knowledge about <b>haemoglobinopathies</b> in middle and high school students, we suggest health education programs including informative lectures particularly about the genetic basis of the disorders especially in the regions where the disorders are prevalent...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of {{the results}} of the first year {{following}} the expansion of the Dutch national heel prick screening programme to include sickle cell disease (SCD). DESIGN: Prospective national registration of children with suspected SCD or another type of severe <b>haemoglobinopathy.</b> METHODS: The bloodspots were analysed using a haemoglobin separation method based on high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Children with an abnormal heel prick result were supposed to be referred to a paediatric haematologist in 1 of the 8 university hospitals. Confirmation of the diagnosis was made by means of a second HPLC test, a DNA test and an investigation for <b>haemoglobinopathy</b> in the parents. The final diagnosis was compared with the probable diagnosis made during screening. RESULTS: In the first year, 64 children had an abnormal heel prick screening result which indicated a <b>haemoglobinopathy</b> (prevalence: 0. 035 %). The probable diagnosis was SCD in 41 children, alpha-thalassaemia in 18 children, beta-thalassaemia in 4 children and another form of <b>haemoglobinopathy</b> (HbEE) in 1 child. The probable diagnosis was confirmed in all of the children. CONCLUSION: The first year of the Dutch neonatal screening programme for SCD was successful, considering that the number of children in whom a diagnosis was made was in line with that expected. The positive predictive value of the heel prick result was thus 100 %. It is too early to comment on possible false negative test result...|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} {{the incidence of}} severe <b>haemoglobinopathy,</b> to evaluate the effect of heel prick screening, and to identify those children who do not benefit from this early diagnosis. Prospective descriptive study. Registration of all symptomatic and asymptomatic children who between 2003 - 2009 were newly diagnosed with the a severe form of a hereditary disorder concerning {{the formation of the}} alpha haemoglobin chain (HbH disease), or the beta haemoglobin chain (sickle cell disease or beta thalassaemia major) in the Netherlands. Registration was done by collecting anonymised reports from the Dutch Paediatric Surveillance Unit and TNO, and by additional questionnaires. During the study period, 48 children (range: 36 - 76) per year were diagnosed with severe <b>haemoglobinopathy.</b> The overall incidence was 2. 5 per 10, 000 live births. The incidence of sickle cell disease diagnosed by heel prick screening was 2. 1 per 10, 000 live births and of thalassaemia major 0. 6 per 10, 000 live births. In 7 % of the children with sickle cell disease who were diagnosed without any form of screening, the diagnosis was made on (a life threatening) infection. Twenty-two percent of the children with a severe form of <b>haemoglobinopathy</b> were not born in the Netherlands. The parents of almost half of the children with sickle cell disease originally came from West- or Central Africa. The parents of children with thalassaemia major were mainly from Morocco or various Asiatic countries. The number of children with severe <b>haemoglobinopathy</b> in the Netherlands has trebled since 1992.

All patients except one were operated on with moderate hypothermia, aortic cross-clamping, topical hypothermia, and cold cardioplegia. A bloodless priming solution was used in nine patients and five did not receive any blood throughout their hospital stay. Arterial and venous blood gas analysis and a search for sickle cells and haemolysis were carried out during and after cardiopulmonary bypass. The data were compared with the findings {{in a group of}} 29 patients without <b>haemoglobinopathy</b> operated on without blood transfu-sion. Two patients died from low cardiac output, unrelated to the <b>haemoglobinopathy.</b> All other patients recovered uneventfully.
