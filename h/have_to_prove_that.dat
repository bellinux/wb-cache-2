25|$|Two months later, {{early in}} 1977, the Court handed down its decision. The justices had {{unanimously}} ruled in Doyle's favor {{on all the}} jurisdictional questions.

25|$|In August 2013, former High Court justice Ian Callinan {{recommended}} 23 more {{changes to}} the Victorian parole system. In particular, he recommended that a full-time parole board be established to replace the current part-time one and that prisoners should <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>that</b> they were low risk reoffenders before being granted parole. An electronic database, to replace the paper filing system currently in use, was also recommended.|$|E

Even so, the General Counsel rarely uses this power to seek relief while complaints are pending, other than in secondary boycott cases, in which the Act commands the General Counsel to seek injunctive relief.|$|E
25|$|Having {{established}} the facts, Gordon {{turned to the}} law. He applied the test from Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed. v. Doyle, a 1977 Supreme Court decision overturning the firing of a teacher for, among other things, sharing a proposed dress code with the media. First, Myers would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>that</b> her distribution of the questionnaire was constitutionally protected speech, and that her firing was a result. If she could establish that, the burden would then be on Connick to show {{that she would have}} been fired whether she had distributed the questionnaire or not.|$|E
25|$|The {{passing of}} the Land Drainage Act 1930 held promise for the future. The many bodies {{responsible}} for small parts of Somerset's flood defences were swept away, and replaced by the Somerset Catchment Board. More importantly, perhaps, they did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>that</b> benefits would occur to a particular community in order to issue rates for drainage work, but could raise rates based on the rateable values of properties. This should have worked, but they soon became apprehensive, and reverted to producing reports, which were not actioned. However, inactivity gave way to action in 1939, when a new engineer was appointed, who saw it as his job to direct {{what needed to be}} done. Work began on improvements to the King's Sedgemoor Drain in 1939. The items to be addressed were the size of the channel, the size of the bridges, and the size of Dunball clyse, all of which were too small. The onset of the Second World War, just a few months later, threatened to stop the scheme, but did not.|$|E

500|$|While Frick's {{suggestion}} that a citizenship tribunal before which every German would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>that</b> they were Aryan was not acted upon, proving one's racial heritage became {{a necessary part}} of daily life. Non-government employers were authorised to include in their statutes an Aryan paragraph excluding both Mischlinge and Jews from employment. Proof of Aryan descent was achieved by obtaining an Aryan certificate. One form was to acquire an Ahnenpass, which could be obtained by providing birth or baptismal certificates that all four grandparents were of Aryan descent. The Ahnenpass could also be acquired by citizens of other countries, {{as long as they were}} of [...] "German or related blood".|$|E

In this case, it was even more strained. The crime charged in this case was actually an agreement to agree to do something in the future.

40|$|Civil lawsuit {{on medical}} {{liability}} could be conducted through two legal actions, namely lawsuit based on {{breach of contract}} and lawsuit based on tort. The significant difference between them is that lawsuit based on breach of contract is based upon contractual liability, thus, there <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be a therapeuttic contract prior to the lawsuit and the plaintiff <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>that</b> the defendant <b>had</b> not conducted their duties properly, so that the plantiff suffred damages. On the other hand the other lawsuit is a legal action on liability based on fault so the plantiff <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>that</b> the defendant <b>had</b> done un unlawful! action which caused demages to the plantiff. </em...|$|R
2500|$|Referring to Siobhan Gorman's Baltimore Sun news stories, the {{government}} legally pleaded that the [...] "newspaper articles are unduly prejudicial.

The government also argued that any discussion at trial of the legal concept of whistle-blowing would likewise be irrelevant to the charges.|$|E
2500|$|The {{decision}} not do so, they said later, was a [...] "strategic decision"; {{in order to}} secure a conviction, police and prosecutors would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>that</b> they believe Biryukova did in fact leave her son alone in the vehicle for an unreasonable length of time. But if evidence later emerged suggesting Sky had been murdered or kidnapped that implicated his mother in some capacity, evidence that suggested he had never been in the car to begin with, arresting her on charges that she had indeed left him there could make a prosecution for the more serious charges impossible, a police spokesman said. Later, Solomon's lawyer told the Seattle Weekly another reason for the inaction: If police did arrest Biryukova, she and her attorney would be able to review all the evidence the police had accumulated up to that point, which neither they nor Solomon wanted her to be able to do.|$|E
2500|$|Ponting {{continued}} in the role for the series against the West Indies in 1996–97 in Australia. After two Test matches and three scores under 10, he was replaced by Justin Langer, despite scoring 88 in the First Test. He {{was out of the}} team for six months, and missed the remaining three Tests against the West Indies, the three Tests on the tour to South Africa, both series victories to Australia. Many [...] "experts" [...] thought the decision was unjustifiable. Former Australian coach, Bob Simpson, said: [...] "I really feel that Ricky could have been persevered with. He's a fine young cricketer and he'll now <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>that</b> he's got the tenacity and temperament to go with it." [...] Ponting's axing meant he had time to regain his form in the Sheffield Shield. Despite struggling at first, he scored twin centuries against South Australia in Hobart, and proceeded to score another ton against Queensland.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to real usurpation, inquiries were made into hereditary nobility: unless the nobility {{was given by}} a Letter of Ennoblement, according to Grande enquête one <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>that</b> at least four generations of his ancestors enjoyed the noble status.|$|R

2500|$|In the 1950s Federal Republic, {{restitution}} {{laws for}} compensation {{for those who}} had suffered under the Nazis was limited to only those who had suffered from [...] "racial, religious or political reasons", which were defined {{in such a way as}} to sharply limit the number of people entitled to collect compensation. According to the 1953 law on compensation for suffering during the National Socialist era, only those with a territorial connection with Germany could receive compensation for their suffering, which had the effect of excluding the millions of people, mostly from Central and Eastern Europe, who had been taken to Germany to work as slave labor during World War II. In the same vein, to be eligible for compensation they would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>that</b> they were part of the [...] "realm of German language and culture", a requirement that excluded most of the surviving slave laborers who did not know German or at least enough German to be considered part of the [...] "realm of German language and culture". Likewise, the law excluded homosexuals, Gypsies, Communists, Asoziale ("Asocials"-people considered by the National Socialist state to be anti-social, a broad category comprising anyone from petty criminals to people who just were merely eccentric and non-conformist), and homeless people for their suffering in the concentration camps under the grounds that all these people were [...] "criminals" [...] whom the state was protecting German society from by sending them to concentration camps, and in essence these victims of the National Socialist state got what they deserved, making them unworthy of compensation. In this regard it is significant that the 1935 version of Paragraph 175 was not repealed until 1969. As a result, German homosexuals-in many cases survivors of the concentration camps—between 1949 and 1969 continued to be convicted under the same law that had been used to convict them between 1935 and 1945, though in the period 1949–69 they were sent to prison rather than to a concentration camp.|$|E
