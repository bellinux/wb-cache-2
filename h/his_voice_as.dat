5|$|Two new {{characters}} {{were introduced in}} this episode. The first, Nelson Muntz, remains a frequently used recurring character, while the second, Herman, has been used far less. The design of Herman, {{with the exception of}} his missing arm, was inspired by writer John Swartzwelder. <b>His</b> <b>voice,</b> <b>as</b> performed by Harry Shearer, was partly inspired by George H. W. Bush. The original idea for Herman was for him to have a differing story for the loss of his arm with every appearance.|$|E

Fortune, which also released country, gospel and rockabilly LPs and 45s, laid the groundwork for Motown, which became Detroit's most legendary record label.|$|E
25|$|Rouvas had no vocal lessons {{as a boy}} {{and taught}} himself {{primarily}} by ear, so during the recording of his first album he had to learn music theory in a short time. His voice developed significantly since his early teenaged performances. Rouvas' detractors have criticized <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>as</b> average, or limited, contending that his appeal is based on image. Whatever the assessment of his voice, {{it has often been}} overshadowed by showmanship and appearance in the media; many preferred to watch him perform than to listen to him. These criticisms diminished by the second decade of Rouvas' career; his technical skills (range, power and versatility in particular) and expression are better appreciated.|$|E
500|$|Harrison's overcommittal of {{his time}} to Dark Horse acts Ravi Shankar and Splinter during 1974 {{resulted}} in him having to rush-record much of Dark Horse while preparing for the North American tour. Due to the pressure, Harrison developed laryngitis during rehearsals and damaged <b>his</b> <b>voice.</b> <b>As</b> well as placing further importance on the instrumentals in his setlist, which included [...] "Hari's on Tour (Express)" [...] and Scott's track [...] "Tom Cat", Harrison's depleted vocals marred the concerts for many observers.|$|E

500|$|The title track, {{recorded}} on September, the next year, sparked some copyright issues, as {{it sounded like}} Irma Thomas's [...] "Ruler of My Heart". After a few months, [...] "Pain in My Heart", with the B-side [...] "Something Is Worrying Me", peaked at number 60 on Billboards Hot 100 chart. Rob Bowman observed that [...] "with 'Pain in My Heart,' Otis's dynamic control is front and center as he uses <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>as</b> a horn, swelling and decreasing in volume, swallowing syllables and worrying the word 'heart.'...It was Otis's most successful effort to date, commercially and aesthetically." ...|$|E
500|$|Fellow musicians {{have also}} {{presented}} dissenting views. Joni Mitchell described Dylan as a [...] "plagiarist" [...] and <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>as</b> [...] "fake" [...] in a 2010 {{interview in the}} Los Angeles Times, {{despite the fact that}} Mitchell had toured with Dylan in the past, and both artists have covered each others songs. Mitchell's comment led to discussions of Dylan's use of other people's material, both supporting and criticizing him. Talking to Mikal Gilmore in Rolling Stone in 2012, Dylan responded to the allegation of plagiarism, including his use of Henry Timrod's verse in his album Modern Times, by saying that it was [...] "part of the tradition".|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} of Raynor {{was originally devised}} by Chris Metzen and James Phinney, with his depiction as a rough-living and dangerous man developed through various pieces of concept art by Metzen. In an interview, Raynor's voice actor Robert Clotworthy cited one piece of this concept art in how he decided to voice the character. The art, showing Raynor on a hoverbike and outfitted with futuristic weaponry, gave Clotworthy the impression that as Raynor was someone people [...] "wouldn't mess with", {{he would not have}} to raise <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>as</b> [...] "other characters [...] shut up and listen" [...] or face the consequences. Clotworthy also stated that in the event that a StarCraft film was produced, he believed Clive Owen would be the perfect choice to play Raynor due to him [...] "being dangerous".|$|E
500|$|Lorde grew up {{listening}} to American jazz musician Billie Holiday, and soul musicians Sam Cooke, Etta James and Otis Redding, whose music Lorde admires for [...] "harvesting their suffering."

Among those records, Lorde deemed Rumours by Fleetwood Mac as [...] "a perfect record". She cites the unusual vocals of Grimes, Sleigh Bells and producer SBTRKT as her prominent influences. Furthermore, Lorde names Thom Yorke as an influence for his [...] "smart" [...] way of using <b>his</b> <b>voice,</b> <b>as</b> well as Nicki Minaj and Kendrick Lamar for their [...] "sassy" [...] tone.

500|$|... "Chatterbox" [...] {{was written}} and sung by Thunders, whom Willis felt [...] "uses <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>as</b> a wailing instrument" [...] {{in a manner}} similar to rock singer Robert Plant. The song was Thunders's first time singing lead and {{featured}} vocals Weisbard and Marks said were delivered in a quavering but proud New York accent. His lyrics described the narrator's growing frustration over a crossed-wire phone connection with a female subject. On [...] "Human Being", an ode to self-respect and personal liberty, Thunders introduced his guitar playing with a roughly performed variation on Bill Doggett's 1956 song [...] "Honky Tonk". Johansen addressed critics of the band in the song, telling them if they found him objectionable they should instead find themselves [...] "a saint", [...] "a boy who's gonna be what I ain't", and a [...] "plastic doll with a fresh coat of paint who's gonna sit through the madness and always act so quaint".|$|E

500|$|After a {{night out}} with Sam Kingston (Scott Wright), Toyah decides to walk home alone but is {{attacked}} and raped. Toyah is found by Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas), who takes her home. Janice initially thinks Toyah has been robbed and is shocked when Toyah tells her she was raped. Toyah gives {{a statement to the}} police and is examined at the hospital. Several male residents are suspected, particularly Peter Barlow (Chris Gascoyne), but they are ruled out by DNA tests. Toyah struggles to deal with what has happened to her and she develops agoraphobia.

500|$|Although Mercury's {{speaking}} voice naturally {{fell in the}} baritone range, {{he delivered}} most songs in the tenor range. His known vocal range extended from bass low F (F2) to soprano high F (F6). He could belt up to tenor high F (F5). Biographer David Bret described <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>as</b> [...] "escalating within a few bars from a deep, throaty rock-growl to tender, vibrant tenor, then on to a high-pitched, perfect coloratura, pure and crystalline in the upper reaches." [...] Spanish soprano Montserrat Caballé, with whom Mercury recorded an album, expressed her opinion that [...] "the difference between Freddie and almost all the other rock stars {{was that he was}} selling the voice". She adds, His technique was astonishing. No problem of tempo, he sang with an incisive sense of rhythm, his vocal placement was very good {{and he was able to}} glide effortlessly from a register to another. He also had a great musicality. His phrasing was subtle, delicate and sweet or energetic and slamming. He was able to find the right colouring or expressive nuance for each word.|$|E
500|$|Hartman first {{performed}} his Clinton {{impression on}} {{an episode of}} The Tonight Show. When he met Clinton in 1993 Hartman remarked, [...] "I guess I owe you a few apologies", adding later that he [...] "sometimes [...] a twinge of guilt about [...] ". Clinton showed good humor and sent Hartman a signed photo with the text: [...] "You're not the president, but you play one on TV. And you're OK, mostly." [...] For his Clinton impression, Hartman copied the president's [...] "post-nasal drip" [...] and the [...] "slight scratchiness" [...] in <b>his</b> <b>voice,</b> <b>as</b> well as his open, [...] "less intimidating" [...] hand gestures. Hartman opted against wearing a larger prosthetic nose when portraying Clinton, as he felt it would be distracting. He instead wore a wig, dyed his eyebrows brighter and used makeup to highlight his nose. One of Hartman's more famous sketches as Clinton saw the president visit a McDonald's restaurant and explain his policies by eating other customers' food. The writers {{told him that he}} was not eating enough during rehearsals for the sketch – {{by the end of the}} live performance, Hartman had eaten so much he could barely speak.|$|E
