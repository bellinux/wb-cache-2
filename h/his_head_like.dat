5|$|Foreign Minister Vũ Văn Mẫu resigned, shaving <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>like</b> a Buddhist monk in protest. Mẫu {{had decided}} to leave the country for a {{religious}} pilgrimage to India and the diplomatic and press corps assembled at the airport to see him off. He never arrived, as the Ngô family had him arrested. General Đính softened the punishment at the behest of a fellow officer, and put the former diplomat under house arrest instead of placing him in jail.|$|E
5|$|Punk {{continued}} to show messianic traits, frequently giving sermons including during the annual Royal Rumble match {{as well as}} during an Elimination Chamber match at both of the eponymous pay-per-views. In the Chamber match, he was eliminated by Rey Mysterio, whom he had feuding with leading into the PPV. Tensions escalated as Mysterio prevented him from winning a Money in the Bank qualifying match, causing Punk to interrupt Mysterio's celebration of his daughter's ninth birthday. Mysterio challenged Punk to a Street Fight at WrestleMania XXVI but lost to Gallows. Punk added the stipulation that if Rey lost, he would join the Society. At WrestleMania, Punk lost to Mysterio sparking a rematch at Extreme Rules where Punk would have to shave <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> <b>like</b> his disciples, if he lost. Punk won this match after interference from a fourth member of the Society who kept his face covered. At Over The Limit, a third and final match was booked with both stipulations reactivated. In the match Punk lost and was subsequently shaved bald.|$|E
500|$|Ambitious and active-minded, Saint-Just worked {{urgently}} and tirelessly {{towards his}} goals: [...] "For Revolutionists {{there is no}} rest but in the tomb." [...] He was repeatedly described by contemporaries as arrogant, believing {{himself to be a}} skilled leader and orator as well as having proper revolutionary character. This self-assurance manifested itself in a superiority complex, and he always “made it clear… that he considered himself to be in charge and that his will was law.” Camille Desmoulins once wrote of Saint-Just, [...] "He carries <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>like</b> a sacred host." ...|$|E
50|$|Buné is {{depicted}} as a three-headed dragon, being <b>his</b> <b>heads</b> <b>like</b> those of a dog, a griffin, and a man (although according to some grimoires he has two <b>heads</b> <b>like</b> a dragon and the third like a man).|$|R

500|$|In August 1963, Nhu, who {{controlled}} {{the special forces}} and secret police, allowed Đính to have a hand in planning raids against Buddhist dissidents who had been organising at the Xá Lợi pagoda, Saigon's largest. The raids involved the deployment of the 5th Division, based {{in the town of}} Biên Hòa on Saigon's northern outskirts, into the capital. Although the execution of the raids—which left hundreds dead—was primarily the responsibility of Colonel Lê Quang Tung, the special forces head, Đính privately took responsibility, stating to a journalist, [...] "I have defeated Henry Cabot Lodge [...] He came here to stage a coup d'etat, but I, Tôn Thất Đính, have conquered him and saved the country." [...] In the aftermath of the raids, Foreign Minister Vũ Văn Mẫu resigned in protest, shaved <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>like</b> a monk and sought to leave on a pilgrimage to India; Nhu ordered Đính to jail him. At the urging of another general, Đính put Mẫu under house arrest instead.|$|E
500|$|Masterton {{suffered}} a severe internal brain injury {{during the first}} period of Minnesota's January 13, 1968, game against the Oakland Seals at the Met Center. He carried the puck up the ice at full speed, passing it off as two Seals defenders, Larry Cahan and Ron Harris, converged on him. [...] Masterton was knocked backward in the resulting collision and landed on <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> <b>Like</b> most players of his era, he wasn't wearing a helmet. Referee Wally Harris compared the hit to an explosion, adding [...] "he was checked hard, but I'm sure it wasn't a dirty play." [...] The force of the impact caused Masterton to bleed from his nose, ears and mouth. [...] The impact of the hit caused him to lose consciousness before he hit the ice; according to some accounts, he briefly came to and muttered, [...] "Never again, never again" [...] before passing back out. [...] He received treatment {{on the ice and}} in the dressing room before being rushed to Fairview-Southdale Hospital.|$|E
500|$|The Doctor has {{prepared}} the house specially {{for the children}} and the holiday; though the children are pleased, Madge privately explains about Reg's death to the Doctor and insists he not overindulge the children. During the first night, Cyril is lured into opening a large glowing present under the Christmas tree, revealing a time portal to a snow-covered forest. The Doctor shortly discovers Cyril's absence and follows him with Lily; they eventually track Cyril to a strange lighthouse-like structure. Madge, finding her children missing, soon follows them into the forest, but is met by three miners in space suits from the planet Androzani Major (Bill Bailey, Paul Bazely, and Arabella Weir). She holds them at gunpoint and is taken back to their excavation walker and told that the forest of the planet they are on is scheduled to be melted by acid rain within minutes, killing anything within it. At the lighthouse, Cyril is met by a humanoid creature made of wood; it places a simple band of metal around <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>like</b> a crown. Lily and the Doctor arrive, followed by another wood creature, but find the creatures have rejected Cyril as he is [...] "weak", as they do the Doctor. The Doctor concludes that the life forces of the trees in the forest are trying to escape through a living creature, the crown acting as an interface.|$|E

2500|$|The second show I {{ever saw}} of the Descendents {{was at the}} Dancing Waters in San Pedro. They broke into the set and he was playing guitar so hard and so angry that his pants fell down. He was an odd character, for sure. I can {{remember}} standing in line at a Misfits show {{and all of a}} sudden he just sat down on the ground and started holding <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>like</b> his ears were ringing or something, and said something to the effect of [...] "What am I doing here? Where am I?" [...] So that was Frank.|$|E
2500|$|Madame Nhu Trần Lệ Xuân, Nhu's wife, {{inflamed}} {{the situation}} by mockingly applauding the suicides, stating, [...] "If the Buddhists want to have another barbecue, I {{will be glad to}} supply the gasoline." [...] The pagoda raids stoked widespread public disquiet in Saigon. Students at Saigon University boycotted classes and rioted, which led to arrests, imprisonments, and the closure of the university; this was repeated at Huế University. When high school students demonstrated, Diệm arrested them as well; over 1,000 students from Saigon's leading high school, most of them children of Saigon civil servants, were sent to re-education camps, including, reportedly, children as young as five, on charges of anti-government graffiti. Diệm's foreign minister Vũ Văn Mẫu resigned, shaving <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>like</b> a Buddhist monk in protest. When he attempted to leave the country on a religious pilgrimage to India, he was detained and kept under house arrest.|$|E

2500|$|The {{decision}} {{to set the}} game four thousand years before [...] {{was one of the}} first details about the game made known. LucasArts gave BioWare a choice of settings for the game. [...] "LucasArts came to us and said that we could do an [...] game," [...] BioWare CEO Raymond Muzyka said. [...] "Or LucasArts said we could go 4,000 years back, which is a period that's hardly been covered before." [...] BioWare chose to set the game four thousand years before the films as it gave them greater creative freedom. They aimed to create content similar to that from the films but different enough to be a definite precursor. Concept work had to be sent to [...] "the ranch" [...] to be approved for use. Muzyka noted that very little of their content was rejected: [...] "It was more like, 'Can you just make <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>like</b> this rather than like that.' So it was all very feasible. There were good suggestions made and they made the game better, so we were happy to do them. It was a good process really and I think we were pleasantly surprised how easy LucasArts was to work with." [...] Zeschuk said that [...] "Overall, we were really happy with the results. We felt like we had enough freedom to truly create something wonderful." ...|$|E
2500|$|Charlie has wild curly hair, is wary of people, and {{frequently}} enthralled with objects and patterns. According to Krumholtz, Charlie wants {{to understand how}} the world works. His father has said Charlie is easily fascinated, possesses a big heart and is thorough, but he misses certain things completely. Meanwhile, Larry observed that he is [...] "a talented theoretician with an ego problem" [...] and a student once described him as fast-talking and disorganized, to the agreement of Larry. Fleinhardt also accurately noticed that his colleague has a high standard of guilt and is a pragmatist. Charlie is rather fond of providing excessive explanations (e.g., his discussion of Occam's razor) and reducing complex phenomena to intuitively obvious situations through practical analogies that are quite unlike Larry's metaphysical musings and cosmic metaphors. (These analogies are known as [...] "audience visions" [...] or, as friend Megan Reeves calls them, [...] "those cute little analogies.") While contemplating, his antics and mannerisms may even disconcert more conventional thinkers. Wearing his headset, Dr. Eppes has an intense focusing ability as he voraciously writes equations, often covering several chalkboards with a staccato clacking and the aid of a red chalk holder. Nevertheless, if his line of thought is interrupted during a tense moment, as one of restricted foresight, he can become very disgruntled. Further, when deeply concentrating on a particular problem, it seems Charlie is unable to provide insights to other topics for the sake that they are simply needed or wanted—he has to write what is in <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> <b>Like</b> his brother Don, he is characteristically stubborn and obsessive ("one part exuberance, two parts obsession"), {{especially when it comes to}} work, but he's rather naïve when it comes to human behavior. The latter often interferes with his FBI work and, thus, is the cause of much distress for him at times.|$|E
