Rubloff's plans were unsuccessful due to financing difficulties and a lackluster market for buyers of Blackstone condominiums. Even two rounds of price cuts were not enough to spur interest in the condo opportunities and Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's non-profit organization was unable to obtain financing.|$|E

25|$|This interpretation, {{which has}} found {{expression}} among both Catholic and Protestant theologians, considers the liturgical worship, particularly the Easter rites, of early Christianity as background and context {{for understanding the}} Book of Revelation's structure and significance. This perspective is explained in The Paschal Liturgy and the Apocalypse (new edition, 2004) by Massey H. Shepherd, an Episcopal scholar, and in Scott Hahn's The Lamb's Supper: The Mass as <b>Heaven</b> <b>on</b> Earth (1999), in which he states that Revelation in form is structured after creation, fall, judgment and redemption.

25|$|Andrew Marvell’s seventeenth-century poem The Garden is a lyric of nine stanzas {{in which}} he rejects all forms of {{activity}} {{in the world in}} favor of solitude of the retiree in a garden. It is a type of retirement poem expressing the love of retirement—an ancient Roman concept related to otium. The poem shows the high degree of pleasure of rural retirement. Some critics see that he shows otium to mean peace, quiet and leisure—a goal for retirement from politics and business. Others see a Christianized otium with Marvell showing a representation of the progress of a soul from the pursuit for the pagan promised land of the peaceful countryside and contemplation to the search for the lost <b>heaven</b> <b>on</b> earth.|$|E
