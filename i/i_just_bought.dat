2500|$|In 1984, DeVille {{married his}} second wife, Lisa Leggett, who {{proved to be}} an astute {{business}} manager. On the strength of his success touring and selling albums in Europe, they bought a horse farm, Casa de Sueños, in Picayune, Mississippi and began living there as well as at their apartment and studio in the French Quarter of New Orleans. DeVille told an interviewer in 1996: [...] "I finally got the plantation... <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>bought</b> this house and [...] It looks a little bit like Graceland... I got into horses since my wife is into them. We're raising Spanish and Portuguese bullfighting horses. The bloodline is 2000 years old. She's into breeding, but I just love riding. I've also got five dogs, four cats and a partridge in a pear tree." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{record company}} issued a brief note about the title: Easy explanation. Dilla likes donuts. Yesterday his mother managed a chuckle when she {{confirmed}} that fact. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>bought</b> two dozen a week ago, she said.|$|E
5000|$|In 2014, Earnhardt's {{ownership}} of the EGR team was absorbed by Ganassi which reverted the name back to Chip Ganassi Racing. When Ganassi was asked why the team released her, he replied [...] "Teresa was a good partner but {{she was no longer}} there. So <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>bought</b> her share of the team and reverted the name." ...|$|E

5000|$|Abbruzzese about [...] "Glorified G":I {{told our}} manager that <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>bought</b> a coupla guns {{and he told}} Jeff, and at {{rehearsal}} Jeff kinda blurted it out. And Eddie went, 'Whaaaat, you bought a GUN?' And I said, 'In fact, I bought two,' which ended up as the opening line of the song. I think it's fair to say Eddie was pretty outraged.|$|E
5000|$|During {{their honeymoon}} in Switzerland in 1947, Eric and Salome Estorick met Arturo Bryks, {{a former teacher}} at the Bauhaus, who {{introduced}} them to Umberto Boccioni's book on Italian Futurism. Before returning from their honeymoon they visited Mario Sironi in Milan from whom they bought a large quantity of his work. Estorick wrote: [...] <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>bought</b> hundreds of drawings, and as many pictures as I could get into my Packard convertible Roadster.|$|E
5000|$|Now What—PC {{begins by}} showing off his new, long book, I Want to Buy a Computer — Now What? to help {{customers}} {{deal with all}} the difficult computer-buying decisions if they {{have no one to}} help. Mac then explains that, at Apple Stores, personal shoppers help customers find the perfect Mac, even offering workshops to teach people about using the computers.

Thanks so very, very much. <b>I</b> have <b>just</b> <b>bought</b> a dark blue tailored long coat and a similar colored jumper dress to wear with various colored blouses, so the pin will show up very well whichever costume I wear [...] ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Who feels," [...] Colonel Ripon went on, [...] "how much {{he and his}} son owe to your kindness, {{and that}} of your good wife, here; and who, as you will find, is not ungrateful. <b>I</b> have <b>just</b> <b>bought</b> an estate, down in Somersetshire; and I mean to install {{you and your wife}} in a pretty lodge, at the gates, with enough to live upon, comfortably, to the end of your lives." ...|$|R
60|$|If the signor {{cared to}} see prisons, he said, the driver must {{take him to}} those of Ecelino, at present the {{property}} of a private gentleman near by. As <b>I</b> had <b>just</b> <b>bought</b> a history of Ecelino, at a great bargain, from a second-hand book-stall, and had a lively interest in all the enormities of that nobleman, I sped the driver instantly to the villa of the Signor P----.|$|R
5000|$|With Souths {{unwilling to}} match the offer from Wests Tigers, Pettybourne joined his new club from 2013. Pettybourne said, [...] "Madge and the {{coaching}} staff {{said they wanted to}} keep me, but it was my choice. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>bought</b> a house so I wanted to make sure I was comfortable paying it off, but it was more for my family." [...] Pettybourne stayed at the Wests Tigers for one season, playing in 12 games and failing to score any points.|$|E
50|$|Ultimately, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>bought</b> it Workshop {{back and}} relaunched Habitat company {{a couple months}} ago and plan on relaunching Alien in the near future. Alien takes a {{different}} strategy because the guys I've done Alien with I've known my entire life, and they wanted {{a little bit of}} a transition. Basically, we've restructured both companies and we have the right setup now where they will run real lean, and that's the way they need to be for the modern market. They'll be around for another 50 years.|$|E
5000|$|Godley, in a 1976 interview, {{described}} the band as [...] "doomed". [...] "I'm afraid we blew the whole thing," [...] he said. [...] "The {{first thing we}} did was take a holiday, and because I'd {{never been able to}} afford a good holiday I flew off to Antigua. We'd been working ever since we'd left college and we were knackered, so Lol and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>bought</b> the tickets to Antigua and off we went. We also bought cars as soon as we came back and then went into the studio to make the LP.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{afraid that}} hasn't any great effect on me, and my {{attitude}} is, at least, a natural one," [...] he said. [...] "I believe that Gordon and I can arrange {{that the boys}} do not hear of your recent action, and though you will take no further part in our affairs, you will stay on at the ranch. I may mention that <b>I</b> have <b>just</b> <b>bought</b> up your mortgage." ...|$|R
60|$|That {{afternoon}} she started {{on her way}} on a mountain pony <b>I</b> had <b>just</b> <b>bought</b> for her, accompanied only by a negro maid. I couldn't let her go quite unattended through those lawless paths, beset by cottages of half savage Africans; so I followed at a distance, aided by a black groom, and tracked her road along the endless hill-sides up to {{a fork in the}} way where the narrow bridle-path divided into two, one of which bore away to leftward, leading, my guide told me, to the chapel of Notre Dame de Bon Secours.|$|R
5000|$|Hart cobbled {{together}} a {{living with the}} money he earned as an adjunct professor and with grants and donations to Project Gutenberg. He supported himself by doing odd jobs and used an unpaid appointment at Illinois Benedictine College to solicit donations for the project. [...] "I know that sounds odd to most people, but <b>I</b> <b>just</b> never <b>bought</b> into the money system all that much. I never spent it when I got it. It's {{all a matter of}} perspective". Hart's expenses were minimized by his habits of using home remedies, fixing his own house and car, and building computers, stereos, and other gear from discarded components.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to Peanuts, Pastis {{drew inspiration from}} Dilbert. What worked for me personally was to study the writing of Dilbert. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>bought</b> a bunch of Dilbert books and studied {{how to write a}} 3-panel strip. Then I showed them to {{a group of people who}} were acquaintances (but not quite friends) in order to get their honest assessment of which ones were funny and which ones werent. As to the ins and outs of getting syndicated, I bought a book called [...] "Your Career in the Comics" [...] by Lee Nordling.|$|E
5000|$|Conrad Bennish, Junior (played by Jason Gaffney) of Earth Prime is {{a student}} in the same class which Quinn Mallory {{is a student}}, and Maximillian Arturo is a professor. Arturo finds him {{brilliant}} but obnoxious. Quinn and Bennish are friends. Bennish has an interest in drugs and bombs. When the FBI showed up to question him about the disappearance of the Sliders, he said, [...] "If this is about the bong <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>bought,</b> I thought it was a plant-holder, honest!" [...] He dresses in a stereotypically [...] "hippie" [...] fashion, wearing long hair and sunglasses.|$|E

5000|$|In 1985, when Bill {{came to me}} {{and said}} he had lined up a U.S. tour, <b>I</b> had <b>just</b> <b>bought</b> a house, <b>I</b> had been working at the post office for three years and I was engaged to a woman who I never did marry. Not doing that tour was the biggest mistake of my life because I think [...] "Wow, I could have {{exhausted}} my creative potential into the band." [...] I'd like to think we would have moved into a punk/jazz direction, like [...] "Tonyage". I guess most people say they have no regrets in life. Yes, I still do regret that. I will always regret that. It was my insecurities. To go on the road, to leave this woman, my house, my job...I wasn't a 17 year-old kid who could say [...] "Bye, mom, I'm off." [...] It's goodbye to this woman I'm engaged to, goodbye to this house I put $40,000 on, goodbye to this job I've had for three years.|$|R

If it is for my benefit alone, then he must take {{ordinary}} care of it. For instance, suppose I had a very superior repeater watch, which the watchmaker should come and borrow of me, in order to see the construction of it. Then suppose I should leave another watch of mine,--a lever,--at his shop to be repaired. Suppose also I should have a third watch, a lady's watch, which <b>I</b> had <b>just</b> <b>bought</b> somewhere, and <b>I</b> should ask him to be kind enough to keep it for me, a day or two, till my watch was done. These would be three different kinds of bailments. The repeater would be bailed to him for his benefit; the lever for his and mine jointly, and the lady's watch for my benefit alone.|$|R
60|$|This lady wears a blue serge {{suit and}} a black hat, without flippancy; she is a powerfully built lady and {{generally}} more or less flushed, and she is aunt, apparently, to {{a great number of}} objectionable-looking people. I go in terror of her. Yet the worm will turn at last, and so will the mild, pacific literary man. Her last outrage was too much even for my patience. It was committed at Gloucester Road Station the other afternoon. I was about to get into a train for Wimbledon,--and there are only two of them to the hour,--and, so far as I could see, the whole world was at peace with me. I felt perfectly secure. The ægis of the pax Britannica--if you will pardon the expression--was over me. For the moment the thought of the lady in the blue serge was quite out of my mind. <b>I</b> had <b>just</b> <b>bought</b> a newspaper, and had my hand on the carriage door. The guard was fluttering his flag.|$|R
5000|$|Tom Baxter {{spent the}} weekend trying to avoid his idol Shane MacGowan, this despite the British folk singer {{performing}} in the Green Room just before MacGowan's band The Pogues, performing at their first Irish festival since Féile in 1991. Bypassing the opportunity of meeting MacGowan up close and personal, the singer of chart hit [...] "Better" [...] opted to mingle among the crowds. Baxter told the Herald: [...] "I haven't met them (The Pogues) before but I don't like to meet people like that. I don't know whether meeting your idols actually enlightens you that much. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>bought</b> their album Rum Sodomy & the Lash because I'd lost it years ago. I've been listening to that so I've really wanted to go see them live. I never think it's worth meeting these people. I've met {{a few of my}} idols and I never {{know what to say to}} them." ...|$|E
5000|$|After Lyubimov's {{departure}} to the West, Demidova gradually {{withdrew from}} Taganka. In 1986 Efros revived the Cherry Orchard production, casting Demidova in the leading role. It won the 1st Prize at BITEF, {{then had a}} successful run in Paris, {{in the wake of}} its director's death. With Lyubimov coming back, Demidova returned to Taganka where she performed as Marina Mnishek (Boris Godunov, 1988) and Donna Anna (Feast Amidst Plague, 1989). In 1988 Alla Demidova joined forces with theatre director Roman Viktyuk who staged Marina Tsvetayeva's Phaedra. [...] "The result was intriguing, it just never fitted into the Taganka's repertoire. We were invited to festivals, toured a lot but were being accused by Lyubimov for allegedly exploiting 'his brand'. Grabbing the first opportunity, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>bought</b> the whole production off: costumes, decorations and everything, never sure what to do with this purchase," [...] Demidova recalled. In the Modern History of the Soviet and Russian Cinema Phaedra was described as the best Soviet theatre production of the 1980s and arguably Viktyuk's most serious work.|$|E

5000|$|Matt Fowler of IGN {{gave the}} episode an 8.6 out of 10, saying the episode [...] "once again showed us what a {{powerful}} force Rick's group can be by having them pretty much annihilate Gareth's posse on one fell swoop. Everyone's on the same page, morality wise, and their fighting skills are, for far, unrivaled. Which is why it's frustrating to see them get cut in half and split off into two separate storylines at the end. I do understand that the show can't realistically handle such a giant ensemble always being together in one spot, but <b>I</b> <b>just</b> wish I'd <b>bought</b> more into {{the reasons for the}} split." ...|$|R

And now thy mouth, if one knew the truth of it, is as bitter. I dare say, as soot’ (for he had cast aside the stem), ‘and thou hast not a friend perhaps in all this world that will give thee a macaroon.’ In saying this, I pulled out a paper of ’em, which <b>I</b> had <b>just</b> <b>bought,</b> and gave him one;—and, at this moment that I am telling it, my heart smites me that there was more of pleasantry in the conceit of seeing how an ass would eat a macaroon than of benevolence in giving him one, which presided in the act.|$|R

I’d always wanted to record my own record but never did, so Moral Agents really started with <b>just</b> me. <b>I</b> knew J, who was actually my girlfriend at the time’s brother-in-law, who did poetry and sang and stuff, so I got together with him. This is before the vinyl. I was working at this record store and started talking to my friend Jeff Harris, who it turns out, was really good with Pro Tools, so I added him to the group. He’s really a producer and doesn’t really play with us live, but he’s very much responsible {{for the sound of}} the record. I knew Mendee Ichikawa for several years, and we had worked on and off, but I knew we needed a female element to the group, so that’s basically what Free Moral Agents is right there. As far as the music goes, it started as my project, but these people who I know I can trust, really bring it together." ...|$|R

Dalton was part of Australia's winning Federation Cup team in 1970. [...] "Before there was a Tour, I actually worked as an accountant when I wasn't playing tennis. In those days, the Lawn Tennis Association of Australia wouldn't let any of us—men or women—play {{more than six months}} of the year. These days that would be called restraint of trade!" [...] On the money Dalton said, [...] "I know exactly what I did with my prize money from Houston. My husband, David, and <b>I</b> had <b>just</b> <b>bought</b> a house in Melbourne, and I sent most of it home to help pay it off." [...] With regard to the personal sanctions against her, she said, [...] "I couldn't play with my Slazenger racquet, we couldn't play in tournaments. In fairness, Wilson was fantastic—they gave us all the stuff that we wanted and did what they could to help. From memory, I used Wilson racquets for two years." ...|$|R

So now Pa knows why Mr. Brice hesitated when Pa asked him to go up the river, and then consented. This is not the end. Yesterday, when I went in to see Mrs. Brice, a new black silk was on her bed, and as long as I live I shall never forget how sweet was her voice when she said, 'It is a {{surprise}} from my son, my dear.

Put on a good countenance. Nobody should ever look anxious except those who have no anxiety. I dare say you would like to know how your account is. I will send for it. It is not so bad as you think. I put a thousand pounds to it in the hope that your fine friend would help us, but I shall not take it off again. My Louis is going to-night to Paris, and he shall call upon the ministers and see what can be done. In the meantime, good appetite, sir. I am going to luncheon, and there is a place for you. And I will show you my Gainsborough that <b>I</b> have <b>just</b> <b>bought,</b> from a family for whom it was painted. The face is divine, very like our Miss Ferrars.
