500|$|Although Steven Spielberg {{initially}} negotiated {{to direct}} the film, he declined the offer. Spielberg reportedly wanted the adaptation to be an animated film, with American actor Haley Joel Osment to provide Harry Potter's voice, or a film that incorporated elements from subsequent books as well. Spielberg contended that, in his opinion, it was like [...] "shooting ducks in a barrel. It's just a slam dunk. It's just like withdrawing a billion dollars and putting <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>your</b> personal bank accounts. There's no challenge." [...] Rowling maintains {{that she had no}} role in choosing directors for the films and that [...] "nyone who thinks I could (or would) have 'veto-ed' [...] him [...] needs their Quick-Quotes Quill serviced." [...] Heyman recalled that Spielberg decided to direct A.I. Artificial Intelligence instead.|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. About.com writer Bill Lamb rated [...] "Come Back to Me" [...] {{three and a}} half stars out of five; he praised its pop sound and Hudgens' [...] "engaging personality", but criticized it for having a manufactured sound from the [...] "Disney pop factory". Moreover, Lamb wrote: [...] "'Come Back to Me' is unlikely to linger too long in your memory, but it also fails to generate any annoying after taste. Program <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>your</b> listening when you need a contemporary, breezy, light pop confection... Sure, you are being manipulated by the corporate music establishment, but the song is fun." [...] He also noted that the [...] "Baby Come Back" [...] sample was possibly added to [...] "trigger pleasant deja vu in parents listening along with their kids". In an editorial review for Rhapsody, Nick Cavalieri named the song one of the best tracks on V.|$|E

Wright {{revealed}} {{that he had to}} get permission from every actor in each video clip, including stunt men, to use the clips and {{for the use of the}} DVD covers had to pay for the rights from the respective studios. The film parodies clich√©s used in other action movies. On the topic of perceived gun fetishes in these movies, Pegg has said, [...] "Men can't do that thing, which is the greatest achievement of humankind, which is to make another human, so we make metal versions of our own penises and fire more bits of metal out of the end into people's heads... It's our turn to grab the gun by the hilt and fire <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>your</b> face." [...] Despite this, Pegg maintains that the film is not a spoof, in that [...] "They lack the sneer that a lot of parodies have that look down on their source material. Because we're looking up to it." [...] The film also includes various references to The Wicker Man, in which Edward Woodward had played a policeman tough on law and order.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the retreat}} of the Confederate army, the Banu Qurayza {{neighbourhood}}s were besieged by the Muslims, in revenge. After a 25-day siege of their neighbourhood the Banu Qurayza unconditionally surrendered. When the Banu Qurayza tribe surrendered, the Muslim army seized their stronghold and their possessions. On {{the request of}} the Banu Aus, who were allied to the Qurayza, Muhammad chose one of them, Sa'ad ibn Mu'adh, as an arbitrator to pronounce judgment upon them. Sa'ad, who would later die of his wounds from the battle, decreed the sentence according to the Torah, in which the men shall be killed and women and children enslaved. [...] says: [...] When you march up to attack a city, make its people an offer of peace. If they accept and open their gates, all the people in it shall be subject to forced labor and shall work for you. If they refuse to make peace and they engage you in battle, lay siege to that city. When the Lord your God delivers <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>your</b> hand, put to the sword all the men in it. As for the women, the children, the livestock and everything else in the city, you may take these as plunder for yourselves. And you may use the plunder the Lord your God gives you from your enemies. [...] Muhammad approved of this decision, and the next day the sentence was carried out.|$|E
