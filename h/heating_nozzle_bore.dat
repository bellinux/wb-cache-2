40|$|ABSTRACT. A {{variable}} flow rate sprinkler applicable to center pivot and lateral–move irrigation systems was constructed and {{tested in the}} laboratory. Sprinkler nozzle size was reduced a fixed amount using a retractable concentric pin in the <b>nozzle</b> <b>bore.</b> Cycling insertion of the concentric pin in the sprinkler <b>nozzle</b> <b>bore</b> provided a time – averaged {{variable flow}} rate over a range of 36 % to 100 % for the nozzle sizes tested. The application pattern radius of the sprinkler tested was reduced approximately 15 % under variable flow conditions. Sprinkler drop size distribution was also reduced by engagement of the pin in the sprinkler <b>nozzle</b> <b>bore.</b> Measured flow rates compared well with theoretical flow rates below 28 L/min (7. 4 gpm). Results from laboratory testing indicate the variable flow rate sprinkler could potentially be used for site–specific irrigation management with center pivot and lateral–move irrigation systems...|$|R

40|$|The inter-related {{effects of}} nozzle clogging, argon injection, tundish bath depth, slide gate opening {{position}} and <b>nozzle</b> <b>bore</b> diameter on the flow rate and pressure in tundish nozzles are quantified using three-dimensional multiphase turbulent numerical fluid flow models. The results are validated with measurements on operating steel continuous slab-casting machines, and presented for practical conditions {{with the aid}} of an inverse model. Initial clogging is predicted to enhance the flow due to a potential streamlining effect before it becomes great enough to restrict the flow channel. The clogging condition can be detected by comparing the measured steel flow rate to the theoretical value predicted under the same conditions by the inverse model presented here. Increasing argon injection may help to reduce air aspiration by increasing the minimum pressure below the slide gate. More argon is needed to do this at intermediate casting speeds and in deeper tundishes. Argon flow should be reduced during shallow tundish and low casting speed conditions (such as encountered during a transition) in order to avoid detrimental effects on flow pattern. It should also be reduced at high casting speed, when the slide gate is open wider and the potential for air aspiration is less. The optimal argon flow rate depends on the casting speed, tundish level, and <b>nozzle</b> <b>bore</b> diameter and is quantified in this work for a typical nozzle and range of conditions...|$|R

40|$|Flow characteristic, non-buoyancy, laminar jet {{diffusion}} flames are described, based on experiments {{carried out in}} microgravity condition during 1. 5 seconds of dropping from tower. Experimental conditions were conducted in both normal and microgravity condition. Methane (CH 4), ethylene (C 2 H 4) and n-butane (C 4 H 10) fuels were burned in steady air at an ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure. Additionally n-butane flame tests were carried out under microgravity. Under normal gravity, the experimental study on flow characteristic in various laminar coflow diffusion flames have been conducted with a particular focus on the buoyancy force exerted from gaseous hydrocarbon fuels. Methane, ethylene and n-butane were used as fuels for the experiments. Coflow burner and Schlieren system were used to observe the fuel flow field near nozzle exit and flow characteristics in flames. The result showed that the recirculation zone was appeared near the nozzle exit with the strong negative buoyancy on the fuel stream when burning n-butane which has heavier density than air. As Reynolds number increases by the control of fuel velocity of n-butane, the vortices were increased and the vortices tips were moved up from the nozzle exit. In addition, {{it can be found}} that the <b>heated</b> <b>nozzle</b> can affect the flow fields of fuel stream near the nozzle exit. Under microgravity condition, the experimental studies on flow characteristic of n-butane flames have been conducted with a particular focus on the non-buoyancy force exerted from gaseous hydrocarbon fuels. The axial velocities of fuel stream were slow up toward the upstream. An indication of absence buoyancy and acceleration due to gravity, the axial velocity were slowly toward the downstream and the particles of fuels stream were not moved in the pockets near the nozzle exit. Therefore, the recirculation zones were disappeared near nozzle exit in n-butane flame under microgravity condition.

Clad thicknesses between 5 and 9 mm on samples that vary in thickness from 45 to 200 mm were studied. The samples were taken from flat plates, from a spherical head of a pressure vessel, from a ring-segment of a <b>nozzle</b> <b>bore,</b> and from the transition radius between a nozzle and a pressure vessel shell. A layer removal method was used to measure the residual stresses. The effects of uncertainties in elastic constants (Young`s modulus and Poisson`s ratio) as well as experimental error are assessed. All measurements were done at room temperature. The results of this work indicate that curvature plays a significant role in cladding residual stress and that tensile residual stresses as high as the yield stress can be measured in the cladding material. Since the vessel from which the spherical and nozzle corner samples were taken was hydrotested, and the flat plate specimens were taken from specimens used in mechanical fatigue testing, these results suggest that rather high tensile residual stresses can be retained in the cladding material even after some mechanical loading associated with hydrotesting and that higher levels of hydrotest loading would be required to alter the cladding residual stresses...|$|R

40|$|An {{abrasive}} {{water jet}} (AWJ) {{system is a}} manufacturing tool that uses high pressure (200 - 400 MPa) water to accelerate abrasive particles through a carbide nozzle they are eroding a target material. Nozzle wear {{is dependent on the}} numerous AWJ system and nozzle parameters such as water pressure, orifice diameter, abrasive type, abrasive size, abrasive shape, abrasive flow rate, and mixing chamber dimensions. The present study investigates the wear profile of the nozzle. The nozzles are made from tungsten carbide. They experienced normal wear after standard use between 100 to 120 hours. The roundness of the AWJ nozzle can be seen after the machining process and the roundness can be more resistant to the chipping and damage if the radius of AWJ nozzle is small. For wear profile, the result shows that the nozzle number 1 has bigger diameter at the entranced which are 4. 28 mm compared to nozzle number 2 that the diameter are 4. 07 mm. Then, the wave structure grows in magnitude and propagates down the <b>nozzle</b> <b>bore.</b> The wear patterns were observed, which are the converged wear pattern occurred at the bore of the AWJ nozzles.

In addition to exit diameter growth, two new measures of wear, nozzle weight loss and <b>nozzle</b> <b>bore</b> profiles were shown to be invaluable in characterizing and explaining the phenomena of nozzle wear. By conducting nozzle wear tests, the effects of nozzle geometric, and AWJ system parameters on nozzle wear were systematically investigated.

30|$|Recent work using rapid {{prototyping}} {{has demonstrated that}} 3 D printing offers flexibility in design at a reduced cost in comparison with traditional phantoms [10]. Commercially available printers are generally based on three main techniques: thermoplastic extrusion, powder deposition and stereolithography. Thermoplastic deposition uses a <b>heated</b> <b>nozzle</b> to extrude small beads of thermoplastic material. As the material hardens, new layers are built up to create a 3 D object. This method is employed in low-cost printers but lacks the resolution and flexibility {{of some of the}} other techniques. Powder deposition printers apply thin layers of binding material on the printer tray and then coat this with a thin layer of powder. This process is repeated to build up the powder/binder layers to create a 3 D object. This technique generally offers higher resolution than the extrusion technique. However, the final material is brittle and porous, requiring additional sealing for long-term use. Stereolithography-based printers employ a vat of light-curable resin and a laser light to build parts. The laser beam traces a cross section of the object {{on the surface of the}} liquid resin. Exposure to the laser light solidifies the pattern and joins it to the layer below, the resolution achievable is of the order of a few microns and the final build material is more durable than other 3 D printing techniques. These printers are now used for final production parts and can produce fine-resolution structures on a sufficient scale to create bespoke molecular imaging test objects.|$|R

[45] {{for a review of}} the costs and properties of commercially available Rapid Prototyping materials). We used two basic forms of printing: Filament, or Polymer, and power-based. Filament, or Polymer-based printers, use plastic spools of ABS, PLA, and other plastics to make 3 D parts. The plastic filament is pushed through a <b>heated</b> <b>nozzle</b> (200  ºC) and the part is printed layer by layer. The support structure needed for horizontal areas and slopes over 55 °. Polymer-based printing material was less expensive; however, they were found to be unsatisfyingly light to handle, and although this was a setting that could be adjusted, the length of time it would take to print would increase exponentially. Typically, an infill, or density, was set at 10 %. Furthermore, one could both see and feel the layers of filament, which had the effect of obscuring some of the detail and effecting a distraction. Although the filament printer can print at the same resolution as the plaster printer we settled on (see below), the vertical compression required to ensure that successive layers of filament would adhere properly to those already placed results in a rougher surface than the plaster printer. In addition, the larger pieces had a tendency toward thermal distortion (warping and deformation) during the process of printing due to the temperature distortions that occur during the printing process.|$|R
40|$|Turbulent mixing {{rates of}} gas and liquid phases between {{adjacent}} subchannels have been measured for various air-water two-phase annular flows in a multiple channel consisting of two identical circular subchannels. In order to study effect of liquid entrainment in the gas core on the turbulent mixing rates, experiments were conducted for two types of liquid injection method, i. e., a small <b>bore</b> <b>nozzle</b> placed in the subchannel center and a porous wall. The result showed {{that the effect of}} liquid entrainment on the turbulent mixing rates of both phases is negligibly small...|$|R
5|$|A test {{series was}} planned to {{determine}} RS-25 engine performance with: the new engine controller unit; lower liquid oxygen temperatures; greater inlet pressure {{due to the}} taller SLS core stage liquid oxygen tank and higher vehicle acceleration; and, more <b>nozzle</b> <b>heating</b> due to the four-engine configuration and its position in-plane with the SLS booster exhaust nozzles. New ablative insulation and heaters were to be tested during the series.|$|R
