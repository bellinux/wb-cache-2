5|$|The Combine's first {{appearance}} is in Half-Life 2. Through {{the early stages}} of the game, Combine Civil Protection units pursue Gordon Freeman through City 17 after he accidentally reveals his presence to Wallace Breen. Due to Freeman's actions in Half-Life, Breen sees Freeman as a major threat. As Freeman escapes the city, Civil Protection units raid the resistance base of Black Mesa East and capture resistance leader Eli Vance, who is transferred to <b>holding</b> <b>facilities</b> at Nova Prospekt. Freeman and Vance's daughter Alyx break into the facility to rescue him, but Eli Vance is teleported to the Combine Citadel by double agent Judith Mossman. However, the strike against Nova Prospekt is seen as the start of a revolution by the citizens of Earth, who take up arms against the Combine. In response, Combine Overwatch are deployed to City 17, and heavy street fighting takes place. Freeman manages to infiltrate the Citadel but is captured and taken to Breen. Mossman allows Freeman to break free of his captivity, and Breen flees to the Citadel's trans-dimensional teleporter, intent on escape. However, Freeman destroys the teleporter's reactor before Breen can escape, causing a large explosion that destroys the top of the Citadel.|$|E

25|$|The BLM has {{established}} Herd Management Areas {{to determine where}} and how many animals will be sustained as free-roaming populations. Some populations of free-roaming horses and burros remain protected under the Act, but others have disappeared from places where there were once established populations. A few hundred free-roaming horses survive in Alberta and British Columbia. The BLM considers roughly 26,000 individuals a manageable number, but the feral mustang population in February 2010 was 33,700 horses and 4,700 burros. More {{than half of all}} mustangs in North America are found in Nevada (which features the horses on its State Quarter), with other significant populations in California, Oregon, Utah, Montana, and Wyoming. Another 34,000 horses are in <b>holding</b> <b>facilities.</b>|$|E

25|$|Animal housing {{practical}} when collecting germplasms {{because they}} keep donor animals in an easily accessible area, making {{the process of}} collecting germplasms easier and more efficient. The species and breeds of animals housed should be considered while planning the facility; facilities should be big enough to meet animal welfare standards, yet small enough to reduce human contact and increase ease of handling while reducing stress of the animal. As the process of collecting germplasm may take several days, the animal may become stressed causing a lower quality of genetic material to be obtained. Thus, training the animal {{to become familiar with}} the process is key. <b>Holding</b> <b>facilities</b> for animals may also serve as a quarantine. Quarantine facilities are necessary in order to prevent the transmission of disease from animal to animal, animal to germplasm, germplasm to germplasm, and germplasm to animal. Introducing quarantine to separate the diseased animal(s) from the healthy should be done immediately. However, a quarantine does not always prevent the spread of disease.|$|E
500|$|Population of free-ranging horses is {{a concern}} because, unlike {{wildlife}} or livestock, horses are not hunted, do not face significant natural predators, nor are their numbers human-controlled by means of grazing permits. [...] Without population control, their numbers can double every four years. With current management practices, numbers currently are increasing by about 15% to 18% each year. [...] , 48,447 equines that had been captured, removed from the range were kept in <b>holding</b> <b>facilities</b> in various locations throughout the west and midwest. Many of these excess animals are eligible to be placed for [...] "adoption" [...] with private owners. [...] Since 1971, about 220,000 horses and burros have been adopted through the BLM. [...] In the early 2000s, about 8,000 horses a year were adopted, but at present, {{there are only about}} 2,500 horses adopted each year. The BLM attributes this to changing economic conditions. Of those remaining in the wild, , the estimated 67,027 horses and burros are {{two and a half times}} the population in 1971 when the Act was passed and about twice the recommended AML. [...] Besides removal of about 3,500 animals in 2016 to long-term <b>holding</b> <b>facilities</b> and adoption, the BLM hopes to use fertility control and other tools to reduce numbers of horses on the range.|$|E
500|$|Equine {{population}} estimates in each HMA {{can vary}} significantly {{from year to}} year, depending on habitat condition in a given area, fecundity of the animals, or if a gather has occurred. Census-gathering methods also vary, and wild horse advocacy groups frequently question {{the validity of the}} population counts. [...] Nonetheless, each HMA is given an Appropriate Management Level (AML), usually given as a range showing upper and lower limits. This is the BLM's assessment of the number of equines the land can sustain. When the population gets too high, some animals are removed and placed for adoption with private owners or sent to long-term <b>holding</b> <b>facilities</b> elsewhere. Since 1971, about 220,000 horses and burros have been adopted through the BLM.|$|E

500|$|By the 1900s, feral horse {{populations were}} in decline, {{and there was}} concern that the horses were {{destroying}} land and resources wanted by ranching and hunting interests. Pressure on federal agencies from the 1930s on led {{to a series of}} policies which severely reduced herd numbers. [...] By the 1950s, modern practices for capturing [...] horses {{came to the attention of}} individuals such as Velma Bronn Johnston, also known as [...] "Wild Horse Annie," [...] who felt the measures were extreme and cruel. Their activism resulted in the Hunting Wild Horses and Burros on Public Lands Act in 1959. However, the 1959 Act did not resolve all the advocate's concerns, leading to the passage of the Wild and Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act in 1971. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and U.S. Forest Service manage these herds. Although the BLM struggled to implement adequate herd management in many areas, in 1973 they began a successful program for rounding up excess numbers, and adopting out these captured horses and burros to private owners. [...] This remains the primary method of removing excess horses and burros from managed land, though in recent years the adoption rate has not kept up with the removal rate, and most horses are currently diverted to long-term <b>holding</b> <b>facilities.</b> [...] Administrative challenges to BLM's management and implementation of the act have been made to the Department of the Interior's Board of Land Appeals.|$|E
500|$|In early 2005, the BLM {{discovered}} {{that some of}} the excess wild horses it had sold had been slaughtered. BLM suspended the sales program in April 2005 and resumed it in May 2005 after implementing new requirements to deter buyers from slaughtering the animals. In the fall of 2007, the last three horse slaughterhouses in the United States closed. In January 2007, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled that a 1949 Texas law banned the possession, transfer, or sale of horse meat. This ruling forced the two slaughterhouses in Texas to close. In September 2007, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit upheld a similar ban in Illinois, causing the plant located in that state to close. [...] However, BLM procedures do not ban the export of wild horses for sale and slaughter outside the United States. In 2008, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) concluded BLM was not in compliance with the 2004 amendment, as the department had imposed limitations on the sale of excess horses to help ensure that they were not slaughtered. The GAO also stated that the BLM had a serious [...] "dilemma" [...] in the need to balance their charge to protect and preserve the feral horses with their charge to destroy or sell without limitation excess animals. It recommended that the BLM [...] "develop cost-effective alternatives to the process of caring for wild horses removed from the range in long-term <b>holding</b> <b>facilities</b> and seek the legislative changes that may be necessary to implement those alternatives".|$|E

2500|$|PREA defines [...] "prison" [...] quite broadly, as [...] "any federal, state, {{or local}} {{confinement}} facility, including local jails, police lockups, juvenile facilities, {{and state and}} federal prisons."

Failure by local authorities and operators of such facilities {{to comply with the}} provisions of PREA results in a 5% reduction in federal funding to that agency for each year they fail to comply.|$|E
2500|$|Because {{there is}} a much larger pool of {{captured}} horses than of prospective adoptive owners, a number of efforts {{have been made to}} reduce the number of horses in <b>holding</b> <b>facilities.</b> [...] At present, there are about 34,000 mustangs in <b>holding</b> <b>facilities</b> and long-term grassland pastures. The BLM has publicly considered euthanasia as a possible solution to overpopulation. In January 2005, a controversial amendment was attached to an appropriation bill before the United States Congress by former Senator Conrad Burns, dubbed the [...] "Burns rider." [...] This modified the adoption program to allow the sale (with the result usually being slaughter) of captured horses that are [...] "more than 10 years of age", or that were [...] "offered unsuccessfully for adoption at least three times." [...] In 2009, Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar proposed the creation of federal wild horse preserves in the midwest, where non-reproducing animals would be kept. Another approach to placing excess animals has been advanced by Madeleine A. Pickens, former wife of oil magnate T. Boone Pickens, who seeks to create a private sanctuary in northern Nevada. There are also increased efforts to assist with finding appropriate adoption homes. One example is a promotional competition, The Extreme Mustang Makeover, that gives trainers 100 days to gentle and train 100 mustangs, which are then adopted through an auction.|$|E
