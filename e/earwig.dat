5|$|After {{five to six}} instars, the nymphs will molt into adults. The male's forceps {{will become}} curved, while the females' forceps remain straight. They will also develop their natural color, which can be {{anything}} from a light brown (as in the Tawny <b>earwig)</b> to a dark black (as in the Ringlegged <b>earwig).</b> In species of winged earwigs, the wings will start to develop at this time. The forewings of an <b>earwig</b> are sclerotized to serve as protection for the membranous hindwings.|$|E
5|$|The {{overwhelming}} majority of <b>earwig</b> species are in Forficulina, grouped into nine families of 180 genera, including Forficula auricularia, the common European <b>Earwig.</b> Species within Forficulina are free-living, have functional wings and are not parasites. The cerci are unsegmented and modified into large, forceps-like structures.|$|E
5|$|Earwigs are {{abundant}} {{and can be}} found throughout the Americas and Eurasia. The common <b>earwig</b> was introduced into North America in 1907 from Europe, but tends to be more common in the southern and southwestern parts of the United States. The only native species of <b>earwig</b> found in the north of the United States is the spine-tailed <b>earwig</b> (Doru aculeatum), found as far north as Canada, where it hides in the leaf axils of emerging plants in southern Ontario wetlands. However, other families can be found in North America, including Forficulidae (Doru and Forficula being found there), Spongiphoridae, Anisolabididae, and Labiduridae.|$|E
50|$|Labiinae, {{whose members}} are {{commonly}} known as little <b>earwigs,</b> is a moderately sized family of <b>earwigs</b> in the suborder Forficulina. It is a cosmopolitan family, {{whose members are}} small, winged <b>earwigs,</b> generally less than 1.5 cm in length.|$|R
50|$|Chelisochinae is a {{subfamily}} of <b>earwigs</b> in the Chelisochidae, {{a family}} {{whose members are}} commonly known as black <b>earwigs.</b>|$|R
50|$|Labiduridae, {{whose members}} are known {{commonly}} as striped <b>earwigs,</b> is a relatively large family of <b>earwigs</b> in the suborder Forficulina.|$|R
5|$|Earwigs {{are mostly}} nocturnal and often hide in small, moist crevices during the day, and are active at night, feeding {{on a wide}} variety of insects and plants. Damage to foliage, flowers, and various crops is {{commonly}} blamed on earwigs, especially the common <b>earwig</b> Forficula auricularia.|$|E
5|$|Some <b>earwig</b> {{specimen}} fossils {{are in the}} extinct suborders Archidermaptera or Eodermaptera, {{the former}} dating to the Late Triassic and the latter to the Middle Jurassic. Many orders of insect have been theorized to be closely related to earwigs, though the icebugs of Grylloblattaria are most likely.|$|E
5|$|The first epizoic {{species of}} <b>earwig</b> was {{discovered}} by a London taxidermist {{on the body of}} a Malaysian hairless bulldog bat in 1909, then described by Karl Jordan. By the 1950s, the two suborders Arixeniina and Hemimerina had been added to Dermaptera.|$|E
50|$|He was a noted {{specialist}} of <b>earwigs</b> (Dermaptera) and crickets and grasshoppers (Orthoptera). He was {{the first}} to classify <b>earwigs</b> on the basis of copulatory organs, and the diversity and biology of the <b>earwigs</b> of Sri Lanka is well studied due to major contributions by Burr in 1901.|$|R
50|$|The primary {{predator}} to L. riparia is ants, as they prey on unattended eggs. Overlap of predation {{does occur}} between organisms though as the <b>earwigs</b> prey on the ant eggs as well, {{the effect of}} ants on <b>earwigs</b> seems to be greater than the reverse relationship, as populations of <b>earwigs</b> increase if the ant’s decrease.|$|R
50|$|Chelisochidae is {{a family}} of <b>earwigs</b> whose members are {{commonly}} known as black <b>earwigs.</b> The family contains a total of approximately 96 species, spread across sixteen genera in three subfamilies.|$|R
5|$|Earwigs {{are mostly}} scavengers, {{but some are}} {{omnivorous}} or predatory. The abdomen of the <b>earwig</b> is flexible and muscular. It is capable of maneuvering as well as opening and closing the forceps. The forceps are used {{for a variety of}} purposes. In some species, the forceps have been observed in use for holding prey, and in copulation. The forceps tend to be more curved in males than in females.|$|E
5|$|Earwigs {{have five}} molts {{in the year}} before they become adults. Many <b>earwig</b> species display {{maternal}} care, which is uncommon among insects. Female earwigs may care for their eggs, and even after they have hatched as nymphs will continue to watch over offspring until their second molt. As the nymphs molt, sexual dimorphism such as differences in pincer shapes begins to show.|$|E
5|$|Archidermaptera is {{believed}} to be sister to the remaining <b>earwig</b> groups, the extinct Eodermaptera and the living suborder Neodermaptera (= former suborders Forficulina, Hemimerina, and Arixeniina). The extinct suborders have tarsi with five segments (unlike the three found in Neodermaptera) as well as unsegmented cerci. No fossil Hemimeridae and Arixeniidae are known. Species in Hemimeridae were at one time in their own order, Diploglassata, Dermodermaptera, or Hemimerina. Like most other epizoic species, there is no fossil record, but they are probably no older than late Tertiary.|$|E
500|$|<b>Earwigs</b> make up {{the insect}} order Dermaptera. With about 2,000 species in 12 families, {{they are one of}} the smaller insect orders. <b>Earwigs</b> have {{characteristic}} cerci, a pair of forceps-like pincers on their abdomen, and membranous wings folded underneath short, rarely used , hence the scientific order name, [...] "skin wings". Some groups are tiny parasites on mammals and lack the typical pincers. <b>Earwigs</b> are found on all continents except Antarctica.|$|R
500|$|<b>Earwigs</b> are {{generally}} nocturnal, and typically hide in small, dark, and often moist {{areas in the}} daytime. They can usually be seen on household walls and ceilings. Interaction with <b>earwigs</b> at this time results in a defensive free-fall to the ground followed by a scramble to a nearby cleft or crevice. During the summer they can be found around damp areas such as near sinks and in bathrooms. <b>Earwigs</b> tend to gather in shady cracks or openings or anywhere that they can remain concealed during daylight. Some people erroneously believe that <b>earwigs</b> burrow into people's ears; that is mostly a myth, although <b>earwigs</b> may crawl into ears and some can bite, as other insects do. [...] Picnic tables, compost and waste bins, patios, lawn furniture, window frames, or anything with minute spaces (even artichoke blossoms) can potentially harbour them.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: This chart shows Willmann's phylogenetic {{hypothesis}} for <b>earwigs.</b> Red are extinct genera in Archidermaptera, {{among them}} is Archidermapteron. Blue are the three living suborders of <b>earwigs,</b> except for green, which are the extinct genera in Forficulina.|$|R
5|$|Earwigs are {{regularly}} preyed upon by birds, {{and like many}} other insect species they are prey for insectivorous mammals, amphibians, lizards, centipedes, assassin bugs, and spiders. European naturalists have observed bats preying upon earwigs. Their primary insect predators are parasitic species of Tachinidae, or tachinid flies, whose larvae are endoparasites. One species of tachinid fly, Triarthria setipennis, has been demonstrated to be successful as a biological control of earwigs for almost a century. Another tachinid fly and parasite of earwigs, Ocytata pallipes, has shown promise as a biological control agent as well. The common predatory wasp, the yellow jacket (Vespula maculifrons), preys upon earwigs when abundant. A small species of roundworm, Mermis nigrescens, is known to occasionally parasitize earwigs that have consumed roundworm eggs with plant matter. At least 26 species of parasitic fungus from the order Laboulbeniales have been found on earwigs. The eggs and nymphs are also cannibalized by other earwigs. A species of tyroglyphoid mite, Histiostoma polypori (Histiostomatidae, Astigmata), are observed on common earwigs, sometimes in great densities; however, this mite feeds on <b>earwig</b> cadavers and not its live <b>earwig</b> transportation. Hippolyte Lucas observed scarlet acarine mites on European earwigs.|$|E
5|$|The common <b>earwig</b> is an omnivore, eating {{plants and}} ripe fruit {{as well as}} {{actively}} hunting arthropods. To a large extent, this species is also a scavenger, feeding on decaying plant and animal matter if given the chance. Observed prey include largely plant lice, but also large insects such as bluebottle flies and woolly aphids. Plants that they feed on typically include clover, dahlias, zinnias, butterfly bush, hollyhock, lettuce, cauliflower, strawberry, blackberry, sunflowers, celery, peaches, plums, grapes, potatoes, roses, seedling beans and beets, and tender grass shoots and roots; they have also been known to eat corn silk, damaging the corn.|$|E
25|$|Forficula auricularia, {{the common}} <b>earwig</b> or European <b>earwig,</b> is an {{omnivorous}} insect {{in the family}} Forficulidae. The European <b>earwig</b> survives {{in a variety of}} environments and is a common household insect in North America. The name <b>earwig</b> comes from the appearance of the hindwings, which are unique and distinctive among insects, and resemble a human ear when unfolded; the species name of the common <b>earwig,</b> auricularia, is a specific reference to this feature. However, they are considered a pest because of the damage they do to crops, their frightening appearance, their ability to fly (which they rarely use), foul odor, and tendency to invade crevices in homes and consume pantry foodstuffs.|$|E
5000|$|The species' cerci {{themselves}} {{could be}} described as being more bead-like (filiform) than the thicker cerci, specifically known as forceps, of most other <b>earwigs.</b> One of the key characteristics of the Forficulina suborder is the existence of large, thick, [...] broadened and [...] forceps, which is notably absent on Archidermapteron martynovi. The only species of <b>earwigs</b> with these uncharacteristically-thinner cerci are <b>earwigs</b> in the suborders Arixeniina and Hemimerina, which are rare and contain few individuals.|$|R
50|$|Euborellia is a genus of <b>earwigs</b> in the {{subfamily}} Anisolabidinae. It {{was cited}} by Srivastava in Part 2 of Fauna of India. Euborellia are small, dark-colored <b>earwigs.</b> Species {{can be difficult}} to distinguish from one another. There are about 50 species.|$|R
500|$|In {{some regions}} of Japan, <b>earwigs</b> are called [...] "Chinpo-Basami" [...] or [...] "Chinpo-Kiri", which means [...] "penis cutter". Kenta Takada, a Japanese {{cultural}} entomologist, has inferred that these names may {{be derived from}} the fact that <b>earwigs</b> were seen around old Japanese-style toilets.|$|R

25|$|European <b>earwig</b> nymphs {{look very}} similar to their adult {{counterparts}} except {{that they are a}} lighter color. The young go through four nymphal stages and do not leave the nest until after the first moult.|$|E
25|$|British Columbian {{introduced}} species include: common dandelion, ring-necked pheasant, Pacific oyster, brown trout, black slug, European starling, cowbird, knapweed, bullfrog, purple loosestrife, Scotch broom, Himalayan blackberry, European <b>earwig,</b> tent caterpillar, sowbug, grey squirrel, Asian longhorn beetle, English ivy, fallow deer, thistle, gorse, Norway rat, crested mynah, and Asian or European gypsy moth.|$|E
5000|$|Haplijapyx {{are typical}} Diplurans. They are small, white, eyeless, entognathous hexapoda with {{moniliform}} antennae. They have two abdominal, pincer-like cerci {{so they are}} often mistaken for <b>earwigs</b> (Dermaptera) but <b>earwigs</b> have eyes. Hapljapyx are described as the most robust {{members of the family}} Japygidae.|$|R

25|$|Allo{{grooming}} {{exists in}} presocial insects—the European <b>earwig</b> (Forficula auricularia) grooms its eggs to prevent mold growth and wood roach (Cryptocercus) nymphs {{spend up to}} a fifth of their time grooming adults (nymphs also groom other nymphs but at a lower frequency, however allogrooming is not seen in adults)— but overall the role of parasite defence in presocial taxa's allogrooming behaviour is currently unresolved.|$|E
25|$|Humans have, however, found {{beneficial}} uses of F.auricularia in {{the pest}} management of other insects. The European <b>earwig</b> {{is a natural}} predator {{of a number of}} other agricultural pests, including the pear psyllid and several aphid species, and in this regard has been used to control outbreaks of such organisms. Damage to crops by F.auricularia is limited {{as long as there are}} high population levels of their insect prey.|$|E
25|$|The first pest {{to attack}} the tree {{early in the year}} when other food is scarce is the <b>earwig</b> (Forficula auricularia) which feeds on {{blossoms}} and young leaves at night, preventing fruiting and weakening newly planted trees. The pattern of damage is distinct from that of caterpillars later in the year, as earwigs characteristically remove semicircles of petal and leaf tissue from the tips, rather than internally. Greasebands applied just before blossom are effective.|$|E
50|$|The <b>earwigs</b> will mate {{soon after}} they reach adulthood, and {{after a period of}} {{approximately}} eleven days, the eggs are laid. Ringlegged <b>earwigs</b> generally complete two to three generations per year, or one for spring and one for autumn, and a single generation can be completed in 61 days.|$|R
