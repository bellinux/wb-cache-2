5|$|Some Russulaceae are {{associated}} with myco-heterotrophic plants of the Ericaceae subfamily Monotropoideae, forming monotropoid mycorrhiza. This is an epiparasitic relationship, where the <b>heterotrophic</b> plant ultimately derives its carbon from the primary, ectomycorrhizal plant partner of the fungus. The association is often very specific, with the <b>heterotrophic</b> plants only associating with selected fungus partners, including Russulaceae.|$|E
5|$|Carbon {{metabolism}} in bacteria {{is either}} <b>heterotrophic,</b> where organic carbon compounds {{are used as}} carbon sources, or autotrophic, meaning that cellular carbon is obtained by fixing carbon dioxide. <b>Heterotrophic</b> bacteria include parasitic types. Typical autotrophic bacteria are phototrophic cyanobacteria, green sulfur-bacteria and some purple bacteria, but also many chemolithotrophic species, such as nitrifying or sulfur-oxidising bacteria. Energy metabolism of bacteria is either based on phototrophy, the use of light through photosynthesis, or based on chemotrophy, the use of chemical substances for energy, which are mostly oxidised {{at the expense of}} oxygen or alternative electron acceptors (aerobic/anaerobic respiration).|$|E
5|$|With animals: Fungi lack chloroplasts and are <b>heterotrophic</b> {{organisms and}} so require {{preformed}} organic compounds as energy sources.|$|E
5|$|Animals as a {{category}} have several characteristics that generally set them apart from other living things. Animals are eukaryotic and usually multicellular (although see Myxozoa), which separates them from bacteria, archaea, and most protists. They are <b>heterotrophic,</b> generally digesting food in an internal chamber, which separates them from plants and algae. They are also distinguished from plants, algae, and fungi by lacking cell walls.|$|E
5|$|The <b>heterotrophic</b> {{bacterial}} microbiota and {{the ecology}} of photosynthetic bacteria of the Lake Burton have been studied in the 1970s and 1980s. Some of the findings indicate that salinity levels increase from below the ice level towards the lake bottom resulting in dense waters, the microbiota activity caused depletion of oxygen, separate water bodies of distinct chemistry got formed, the intervening chemical gradients have created niches for colonization by unique microbial communities and 68 bacteria were isolated.|$|E
5|$|The kingdom Animalia or metazoa, {{contains}} multicellular {{organisms that}} are <b>heterotrophic</b> and motile (although some have secondarily adopted a sessile lifestyle). Most animals have bodies differentiated into separate tissues and {{these animals are}} also known as eumetazoans. They have an internal digestive chamber, {{with one or two}} openings; the gametes are produced in multicellular sex organs, and the zygotes include a blastula stage in their embryonic development. Metazoans do not include the sponges, which have undifferentiated cells.|$|E
5|$|A diatom floristic {{study of}} the lagoon {{revealed}} that it contains 41 species and is a rich storehouse of psychrophilic photosynthetic bacteria. The <b>heterotrophic</b> bacterial microbiota and the ecology of photosynthetic bacteria of the Lake Burton were studied in the 1970s and 1980s. Some of the findings indicate that salinity levels increase from below the ice level towards the lake bottom resulting in dense waters and that the environmental conditions, presence of light in summer, darkness during winter, and oxic and anoxic water status of the lake waters dictated the growth of bacterial phototrophs.|$|E
5|$|Lithotrophic {{bacteria}} can use inorganic compounds {{as a source}} of energy. Common inorganic electron donors are hydrogen, carbon monoxide, ammonia (leading to nitrification), ferrous iron and other reduced metal ions, and several reduced sulfur compounds. In unusual circumstances, the gas methane can be used by methanotrophic bacteria as both a source of electrons and a substrate for carbon anabolism. In both aerobic phototrophy and chemolithotrophy, oxygen is used as a terminal electron acceptor, whereas under anaerobic conditions inorganic compounds are used instead. Most lithotrophic organisms are autotrophic, whereas organotrophic organisms are <b>heterotrophic.</b>|$|E
5|$|Soil is {{the living}} {{top layer of}} mineral and organic dirt that covers {{the surface of the}} planet. It is the chief {{organizing}} centre of most ecosystem functions, and it is of critical importance in agricultural science and ecology. The decomposition of dead organic matter (for example, leaves on the forest floor), results in soils containing minerals and nutrients that feed into plant production. The whole of the planet's soil ecosystems is called the pedosphere where a large biomass of the Earth's biodiversity organizes into trophic levels. Invertebrates that feed and shred larger leaves, for example, create smaller bits for smaller organisms in the feeding chain. Collectively, these organisms are the detritivores that regulate soil formation. Tree roots, fungi, bacteria, worms, ants, beetles, centipedes, spiders, mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and other less familiar creatures all work to create the trophic web of life in soil ecosystems. Soils form composite phenotypes where inorganic matter is enveloped into the physiology of a whole community. As organisms feed and migrate through soils they physically displace materials, an ecological process called bioturbation. This aerates soils and stimulates <b>heterotrophic</b> growth and production. Soil microorganisms are influenced by and feed back into the trophic dynamics of the ecosystem. No single axis of causality can be discerned to segregate the biological from geomorphological systems in soils. Paleoecological studies of soils places the origin for bioturbation to a time before the Cambrian period. Other events, such as the evolution of trees and the colonization of land in the Devonian period {{played a significant role in}} the early development of ecological trophism in soils.|$|E
25|$|The initial {{partnership}} {{may have}} been between anaerobic archea that required molecular hydrogen (H2) and <b>heterotrophic</b> bacteria that produced it and could live both with and without oxygen.|$|E
25|$|This type of {{mycorrhiza}} {{occurs in}} the subfamily Monotropoideae of the Ericaceae, {{as well as several}} genera in the Orchidaceae. These plants are <b>heterotrophic</b> or mixotrophic and derive their carbon from the fungus partner. This is thus a non-mutualistic, parasitic type of mycorrhizal symbiosis.|$|E
25|$|The {{last major}} {{stage in the}} {{evolution}} of microbial mats was the appearance of cyanobacteria, photsynthesizers which both produce and use oxygen. This gave undersea mats their typical modern structure: an oxygen-rich top layer of cyanobacteria; a layer of photsynthesizing purple bacteria that could tolerate oxygen; and oxygen-free, H2S-dominated lower layers of <b>heterotrophic</b> scavengers, mainly methane-emitting and sulfate-reducing organisms.|$|E
25|$|Animals are eukaryotic, {{multicellular}} {{organisms that}} form the biological kingdom Animalia. With few exceptions, animals are motile (able to move), <b>heterotrophic</b> (consume organic material), reproduce sexually, and their embryonic development includes a blastula stage. The body plan of the animal derives from this blastula, differentiating specialized tissues and organs as it develops; this plan eventually becomes fixed, although some undergo metamorphosis at some stage in their lives.|$|E
25|$|Most hydrogens in <b>heterotrophic</b> tissues {{come from}} water not from diet sources, but the {{proportion}} coming from water varies. In general, Hydrogen from water {{is transferred to}} NADPH and then taken up to the tissues. An apparent trophic effect (compounding effect) can be observed for δD in heterotrophs, so significant D-enrichments result from the intake of surrounding water the in aquatic food webs. The δD of proteins in animal tissues are in cases affected more by diet sources than by surrounding water.|$|E
25|$|The alveolates {{are a major}} clade of {{unicellular}} eukaryotes of both autotrophic and <b>heterotrophic</b> members. The {{most notable}} shared characteristic {{is the presence of}} cortical (outer-region) alveoli (sacs). These are flattened vesicles (sacs) packed into a continuous layer just under the membrane and supporting it, typically forming a flexible pellicle (thin skin). In dinoflagellates they often form armor plates. Many members contain a red-algal derived plastid. One notable characteristic of this diverse group is the frequent loss of photosynthesis. However, a majority of these heterotrophs continue to process a non-photosynthetic plastid.|$|E
25|$|Soil {{respiration}} {{is a key}} ecosystem {{process that}} releases carbon from the soil {{in the form of}} CO2. CO2 is acquired from the atmosphere and converted into organic compounds in the process of photosynthesis. Plants use these organic compounds to build structural components or respire them to release energy. When plant respiration occurs below-ground in the roots, it adds to soil respiration. Over time, plant structural components are consumed by heterotrophs. This <b>heterotrophic</b> consumption releases CO2 and when this CO2 is released by below-ground organisms, it is considered soil respiration.|$|E
25|$|Some {{species of}} {{bacteria}} catalyze redox transformations of arsenic. Dissimilatory arsenate-respiring prokaryotes (DARP) {{speed up the}} reduction of As(V) to As(III). DARP use As(V) as the electron acceptor of anaerobic respiration and obtain energy to survive. Other organic and inorganic substances can be oxidized in this process. Chemoautotrophic arsenite oxidizers (CAO) and <b>heterotrophic</b> arsenite oxidizers (HAO) convert As(III) into As(V). CAO combine the oxidation of As(III) with the reduction of oxygen or nitrate. They use obtained energy to fix produce organic carbon from CO2. HAO cannot obtain energy from As(III) oxidation. This process may be an arsenic detoxification mechanism for the bacteria.|$|E
25|$|The <b>heterotrophic</b> {{processing}} of carbohydrates involves isomerization of triose phosphates and interconversion between fructose-6-phosphate and glucose-6-phosphate. These cellular processes promote the exchange between organic H and H2O within the plant tissues leading to around 158‰ of D-enrichment of those exchanged sites. The δD of C3 {{plants such as}} Sugar beet, orange and grape ranges from -132‰ to -117‰, and that of C4 plants such as sugar cane and maize ranges from -91‰ to -75‰. The δD of CAM such as pineapple {{is estimated to be}} around -75‰. Sugar beet and sugar cane contain sucrose, and maize contain glucose. Orange and pineapple are the sources of glucose and fructose.|$|E
25|$|Links in food webs map {{the feeding}} {{connections}} (who eats whom) in an ecological community. Food cycle is an obsolete term that {{is synonymous with}} food web. Ecologists can broadly group all life forms into one of two trophic layers, the autotrophs and the heterotrophs. Autotrophs produce more biomass energy, either chemically without the sun's energy or by capturing the sun's energy in photosynthesis, than they use during metabolic respiration. Heterotrophs consume rather than produce biomass energy as they metabolize, grow, and add to levels of secondary production. A food web depicts a collection of polyphagous <b>heterotrophic</b> consumers that network and cycle the flow of energy and nutrients from a productive base of self-feeding autotrophs.|$|E
25|$|MacDonald et al. (1990) has {{described}} four general community types. These are communities dominated by Vestimentiferan tube worms (Lamellibrachia c.f. barhami and Escarpia spp.), mytilid mussels (Seep Mytilid Ia, Ib, and III, and others), vesicomyid clams (Vesicomya cordata and Calyptogena ponderosa), and infaunal lucinid or thyasirid clams (Lucinoma sp. or Thyasira sp.). Bacterial mats are present at all sites visited to date. These faunal groups tend to display distinctive characteristics {{in terms of}} how they aggregate, the size of aggregations, the geological and chemical properties of the habitats in which they occur and, to some degree, the <b>heterotrophic</b> fauna that occur with them. Many of the species found at these cold seep communities in the Gulf of Mexico are new to science and remain undescribed.|$|E
25|$|It is {{estimated}} that the appearance of oxygenic photosynthesis increased biological productivity {{by a factor of}} between 100 and 1,000. All photosynthetic reactions require a reducing agent, but the significance of oxygenic photosynthesis is that it uses water as a reducing agent, and water is much more plentiful than the geologically produced reducing agents on which photosynthesis previously depended. The resulting increases in the populations of photosynthesizing bacteria in the top layers of microbial mats would have caused corresponding population increases among the chemotrophic and <b>heterotrophic</b> microorganisms that inhabited the lower layers and which fed respectively on the by-products of the photosynthesizers and on the corpses and / or living bodies of the other mat organisms. These increases would have made microbial mats the planet's dominant ecosystems. From this point onwards life itself produced significantly more of the resources it needed than did geochemical processes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Heterotrophic</b> {{species at}} seep sites are {{a mixture of}} species unique to seeps (particularly {{molluscs}} and crustacean invertebrates) {{and those that are}} a normal component from the surrounding environment. Carney (1993) first reported a potential imbalance that could occur as a result of chronic disruption. Because of sporadic recruitment patterns, predators could gain an advantage, resulting in exterminations in local populations of mussel beds. It is clear that seep systems do interact with the background fauna but conflicting evidence remains as to what degree outright predation on some specific community components such as tubeworms occurs (MacDonald, 2002). The more surprising results from this recent work is why background species do not utilize seep production more than seems to be evident. In fact, seep-associated consumers such as galatheid crabs and nerite gastropods had isotopic signatures, indicating that their diets were a mixture of seep and background production. At some sites, endemic seep invertebrates that would have been expected to obtain much if not all their diet from seep production actually consumed as much as 50 percent of their diets from the background.|$|E
500|$|Russulaceae fruitbodies {{are subject}} to {{parasitisation}} by other fungi. The genus Asterophora develops on old fruitbodies of the mushroom species in the family, as does Dendrocollybia racemosa on at least Russula crassotunicata. Fruitbodies of Lactifluus or Russula species otherwise hot-tasting and unpalatable are regarded as choice edibles in North America when infected by the [...] "lobster mushroom" [...] Hypomyces lactifluorum. <b>Heterotrophic</b> plants, including orchids or monotropoids, also parasitise ectomycorrhizal Russulaceae and their plant partners – see above, Other types of mycorrhiza.|$|E

Unlike other animals, they lack true tissues and organs, and have no body symmetry. The shapes of their bodies are adapted for maximal {{efficiency}} of water flow through the central cavity, where it deposits nutrients, and leaves through a hole called the osculum. Many sponges have internal skeletons of spongin and/or spicules of calcium carbonate or silicon dioxide. All sponges are sessile aquatic animals. Although there are freshwater species, the great majority are marine (salt water) species, ranging from tidal zones to depths exceeding [...]|$|E
500|$|Scientists first {{reported}} evidence of microbes in the accretion ice in 1999. Since then, a different {{team led by}} Scott O. Rogers has been identifying a variety of bacteria and fungi from accretion ice (not from the subglacial water layer) collected during U.S. drilling projects in the 1990s. According to him, this indicates that the lake below the ice is not sterile but contains a unique ecosystem. [...] Then Scott Rogers published in July 2013 that his team performed nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) sequencing and the results allowed deduction of the metabolic pathways represented in the accretion ice and, by extension, in the lake. The team found 3,507 unique gene sequences, and approximately 94% of the sequences were from bacteria and 6% were from Eukarya. Taxonomic classifications (to genus and/or species) or identification were possible for 1,623 of the sequences. In general, the taxa were similar to organisms previously described from lakes, brackish water, marine environments, soil, glaciers, ice, lake sediments, deep-sea sediments, deep-sea thermal vents, animals and plants. Sequences from aerobic, anaerobic, psychrophilic, thermophilic, halophilic, alkaliphilic, acidophilic, desiccation-resistant, autotrophic, and <b>heterotrophic</b> organisms were present, including a number from multicellular eukaryotes.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{microbes}} are <b>heterotrophic</b> (more precisely chemoorganoheterotrophic), using {{organic compounds}} as both carbon and energy sources. <b>Heterotrophic</b> microbes live off of nutrients that they scavenge from living hosts (as commensals or parasites) or find in {{dead organic matter}} of all kind (saprophages). Microbial metabolism is the main contribution for the bodily decay of all organisms after death. Many eukaryotic microorganisms are <b>heterotrophic</b> by predation or parasitism, properties also found in some bacteria such as Bdellovibrio (an intracellular parasite of other bacteria, causing death of its victims) and Myxobacteria such as Myxococcus (predators of other bacteria which are killed and lysed by cooperating swarms of many single cells of Myxobacteria). Most pathogenic bacteria {{can be viewed as}} <b>heterotrophic</b> parasites of humans or the other eukaryotic species they affect. <b>Heterotrophic</b> microbes are extremely abundant in nature and are responsible for the breakdown of large organic polymers such as cellulose, chitin or lignin which are generally indigestible to larger animals. Generally, the breakdown of large polymers to carbon dioxide (mineralization) requires several different organisms, with one breaking down the polymer into its constituent monomers, one able to use the monomers and excreting simpler waste compounds as by-products, and one able to use the excreted wastes. [...] There are many variations on this theme, as different organisms are able to degrade different polymers and secrete different waste products.

2500|$|Water, carbon dioxide, {{minerals}} and light are all {{important factors in}} cultivation, and different algae have different requirements. The basic reaction for algae growth in water is carbon dioxide + light energy + water = glucose + oxygen + water. [...] This is called autotrophic growth. [...] It is also possible to grow certain types of algae without light, these types of algae consume sugars (such as glucose). This is called <b>heterotrophic</b> growth.|$|E
2500|$|In both cases, the {{end point}} is a polymer of reduced carbohydrate, (CH2O)n, {{typically}} molecules such as glucose or other sugars. [...] These relatively simple molecules may be then used to further synthesise more complicated molecules, including proteins, complex carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids, or be respired to perform work. Consumption of primary producers by <b>heterotrophic</b> organisms, such as animals, then transfers these organic molecules (and the energy stored within them) up the food web, fueling all of the Earth's living systems.|$|E
2500|$|A similar event {{occurred}} with photosynthetic cyanobacteria entering large <b>heterotrophic</b> cells and becoming chloroplasts. [...] Probably {{as a result}} of these changes, a line of cells capable of photosynthesis split off from the other eukaryotes more than 1billion years ago. There were probably several such inclusion events. Besides the well-established endosymbiotic theory of the cellular origin of mitochondria and chloroplasts, there are theories that cells led to peroxisomes, spirochetes led to cilia and flagella, and that perhaps a DNA virus led to the cell nucleus, though none of them are widely accepted.|$|E
