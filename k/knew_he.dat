5|$|I am not {{too sure}} if John {{actually}} fully {{understood what he}} was saying. He <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> was onto something when he saw those words and turned them into a song. But to have experienced what the lyrics in that song are actually about? I don't know if he fully understood it.|$|E
5|$|In {{voting against}} the Force Bill, Tyler <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> would {{permanently}} alienate the pro-Jackson {{faction of the}} Virginia legislature, even those who had tolerated his irregularity up to this point. This jeopardized his re-election in February 1833, in which he faced the pro-administration Democrat James McDowell; however, with Clay's endorsement, Tyler was re-elected {{by a margin of}} 12 votes.|$|E

5|$|Although Ruth <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> {{was nearly}} {{finished}} as a player, he desired {{to remain in}} baseball as a manager. He was often spoken of as a possible candidate as managerial jobs opened up, but in 1932, when he was mentioned as a contender for the Red Sox position, Ruth stated {{that he was not}} yet ready to leave the field. There were rumors that Ruth was a likely candidate each time when the Cleveland Indians, Cincinnati Reds, and Detroit Tigers were looking for a manager, but nothing came of them.|$|E
5|$|Although {{initially}} {{skeptical about}} the role, Perrineau took it after Lost creator J. J. Abrams told him more about it. Much of the first season arc for Michael was rewritten; he was originally {{going to be part}} of a love triangle with Korean couple Sun (Yunjin Kim) and Jin (Daniel Dae Kim), but positive fan reaction to the couple meant this storyline was dropped. After Michael leaves the Island in season two, Perrineau <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> would return to Lost at some point; he felt there was more to tell of Michael's story. Reception for the character was mixed. However, Perrineau's acting was praised.|$|E
5|$|Between {{chapters}} in which Penelope is narrating, the twelve maids speak on topics from their point-of-view. They lament their childhood as slaves with no parents or playtime, sing of freedom, and {{dream of being}} princesses. They contrast their lives to Telemachus' and wonder {{if they would have}} killed him as a child if they <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> would kill them as a young man. They blame Penelope and Eurycleia for allowing them to unjustly die. In Hades, they haunt both Penelope and Odysseus.|$|E

5|$|Cannon had {{a modest}} 1968 {{season in which}} he caught six {{touchdown}} passes—including one of 48 yards {{in the second quarter}} of the famous Heidi Game—but <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> would not be in Oakland much longer. Head coach John Madden had relegated him to running decoy routes by 1969 and he had only two touchdowns. Nevertheless, he was invited as a replacement to play in his second All-Star game. Cannon was released by the Raiders during the 1970 preseason.|$|E
5|$|Geoffrey Rush as Captain Hector Barbossa: The {{captain of}} the Black Pearl, since taken over from Sparrow. Barbossa and his crew suffer a curse from Aztec gold that makes them a team of living-dead.

5|$|He <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> {{wanted to}} become a {{professional}} wrestler at the age of twelve and said he performed a wrestling routine in his high school's talent show, complete with fake blood. Hickenbottom was already an athlete; his career began at the age of six when he started playing football. He was a stand-out linebacker at Randolph High School on Randolph Air Force Base and eventually became captain of the football team. After graduating, Hickenbottom attended Southwest Texas State University in San Marcos, Texas, but soon realized that college life was not for him. He then began pursuing a career in professional wrestling.|$|E

5|$|In Tondon Tiku began {{preparations}} for his mother's funeral, preparations which, in Torajan culture, took several months. While {{taking care of}} the preparations, he had an advisor collect weapons secretly while another went to his fortresses in Alla' and Ambeso. Tiku then made preparations to escape Dutch custody; he also returned all property that he had taken as a lord, as he <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> would no longer use it. While in Tondon, Dutch forces may have harassed the Torajan leader. The night before his mother's funeral, in January 1907, Tiku and 300 of his followers escaped Tondon, heading south.|$|E

She met the Devil {{in the form of}} a black dog on Ceres Moor and made a bargain with him; she <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> was the Devil as he had the ability to change shape and had undergone a transformation in front of her. Initially she offered him her daughter then her granddaughter who was six years old. The four other women were named as co-conspirators in her confession.|$|E

5|$|The program's {{producers}} and Brockman met {{to review the}} videotape. They noticed that Larson would immediately celebrate after many of his spins instead of waiting the {{fraction of a second}} it would take for a contestant to see and respond to the space he or she had stopped on, effectively showing he <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> was going to get something good. It was also noticed that Larson had an unusual reaction to his early prize of a Kauai trip, which was out of his pattern – he initially looked puzzled and upset, but then recovered and celebrated after a pause.|$|E

The lab member <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> could blame it on PHAT. Veronica decides to tell the other lab members that she was unable to find the monkey, although she is surprised to learn that they will quickly get another monkey. Veronica has a heartfelt conversation with Piz, although soon afterward, she goes back to Logan. Keith decides to take the case of Dean O’Dell’s death. The next morning, Piz walks up to Veronica excitedly, but Logan appears, making things awkward and causing Piz to leave sadly.|$|E
5|$|After {{entering}} Princeton, the Americans {{began to}} loot the abandoned British supply wagons {{and the town}} itself. With news that Cornwallis was approaching, Washington <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> had to leave Princeton. Washington wanted to push onto New Brunswick and capture a British pay chest of 70,000 pounds but Major Generals Henry Knox and Nathanael Greene talked him out of it. Instead, Washington moved his army to Somerset Courthouse {{on the night of}} January 3, then marched to Pluckemin by January 5, and arrived at Morristown, by sunset the next day, for winter encampment. After the battle, Cornwallis abandoned many of his posts in New Jersey, and ordered his army to retreat to New Brunswick.|$|E

5|$|Cecil {{decided the}} game would start {{a day before}} the Parisian cafe {{explosion}} in the original game, filling in some of Nicole Collard's back-story. To this end, Cecil also drafted in the acclaimed comic book artist Dave Gibbons, with whom Revolution worked previously on their 1994 cult classic adventure Beneath a Steel Sky. In addition to working on the visual references for the game, Gibbons also produced a comic book to accompany the game's DS release. Gibbons stated {{that he decided to}} return to video game work on this game because he knew producing character shots with a range of expressions would be challenging, and he <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> would enjoy it, based upon past experience.|$|E
5|$|Compton {{felt that}} having teams at Columbia University, Princeton University, the University of Chicago and the University of California was {{creating}} too much duplication {{and not enough}} collaboration, and he resolved to concentrate the work in one location. Nobody wanted to move, and everybody argued in favor of their own location. In January 1942, soon after the United States entered World War II, Compton decided on his own location, the University of Chicago, where he <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> had the unstinting support of university administration. Chicago also had a central location, and scientists, technicians and facilities were more readily available in the Midwest, where war work had not yet taken them away. In contrast, Columbia University was engaged in uranium enrichment efforts under Harold Urey and John Dunning, and was hesitant to add a third secret project.|$|E
5|$|Curtis, {{inspired}} {{by the fact that}} Van Gogh never <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> would be famous, had the idea for an episode centred on him. He left the script open to criticism from the crew and made many revisions as a result. Curtis wanted to portray Van Gogh truthfully, rather than being cruel by writing jokes about his mental illness. Most of the episode was filmed in Trogir, Croatia, and many of the sets were modelled after Van Gogh paintings. The episode was watched by 6.76 million viewers on BBC One and BBC HD. Reception to the episode varied, ranging from very positive to mixed to very negative. While the amount of emotion in the episode was debated, many reviewers agreed that Curran's performance as Van Gogh was excellent, but that the Krafayis was not a threatening monster.|$|E
