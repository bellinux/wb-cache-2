5|$|Dromaeosauroides {{has been}} {{considered}} an indeterminate dromaeosaur by some scientists. Bonde responded that since the teeth {{differ from those of}} other dromaeosaurs from the Early Cretaceous (and later members of the group, including Dromaeosaurus), it should be considered valid. He also said that these scientists had provided incorrect information about the location, strata and age of the specimen, and that the circumstances of its naming were no <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> other tooth-based taxa.|$|E

5|$|Most {{extraterrestrial}} helium {{is found}} in a plasma state, with properties quite <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> atomic helium. In a plasma, helium's electrons are not bound to its nucleus, resulting in very high electrical conductivity, even when the gas is only partially ionized. The charged particles are highly influenced by magnetic and electric fields. For example, in the solar wind together with ionized hydrogen, the particles interact with the Earth's magnetosphere, giving rise to Birkeland currents and the aurora.|$|E
5|$|On August 8, 2007, along {{a remote}} shore of Lake Superior on the Keweenaw Peninsula, a Michigan family {{discovered}} a lone life-saving ring {{that appeared to}} have come from Fitzgerald. It bore markings <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> rings found at the wreck site, and was thought to be a hoax. Later it was determined that the life ring was not from Fitzgerald, but had been lost by the owner, whose father had made it as a personal memorial.|$|E
5|$|Seabirds' life {{histories}} are dramatically <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> land birds. In general, they are K-selected, live much longer (anywhere between twenty and sixty years), delay breeding for longer (for {{up to ten}} years), and invest more effort into fewer young. Most species will only have one clutch a year, unless they lose the first (with a few exceptions, like the Cassin's auklet), and many species (like the tubenoses and sulids), only one egg a year.|$|E

5|$|Shark skeletons {{are very}} <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> bony fish and {{terrestrial}} vertebrates. Sharks and other cartilaginous fish (skates and rays) have skeletons made of cartilage and connective tissue. Cartilage is flexible and durable, yet {{is about half}} the normal density of bone. This reduces the skeleton's weight, saving energy. Because sharks do not have rib cages, they can easily be crushed under their own weight on land.|$|E
5|$|The actors {{began working}} on the game in 2010. Their {{performances}} were mostly recorded using motion capture technology. Dialogue for scenes with characters seated in vehicles was recorded in studios. Because the actors had their dialogue and movements recorded on-set, they considered their performances were no <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> film or television roles. Their dialogue was scripted so {{that it did not}} allow the actors to ad-lib; however they sometimes made small changes to the performance with approval from the directors.|$|E

Those foods included aubergines, spinach, sugar cane, rice, apricots and citrus fruits, creating the distinctive culinary tradition of Al-Andalus.|$|E

During their training, the player can collect stamps by completing minigames, and only one stamp can be collected per day. When a certain numbers of stamps are collected, new minigames and features are unlocked.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of the English Civil War Birmingham's booming economy, its {{expanding}} population, and its resulting high levels of social mobility and cultural pluralism, had seen it develop new social structures very <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> more established areas. Relationships were built around pragmatic commercial linkages rather than the rigid paternalism and deference of feudal society, and loyalties to the traditional hierarchies of the established church and aristocracy were weak. The town's reputation for political radicalism and its strongly Parliamentarian sympathies saw it attacked by Royalist forces in the Battle of Birmingham in 1643, and it developed into a centre of Puritanism in the 1630s and as a haven for Nonconformists from the 1660s.|$|E
5|$|Clwyd County Council and its six districts ceased {{operations}} at midnight on 1 April 1996, {{and local government}} was immediately transferred to the new principal areas of Conwy, Denbighshire, Flintshire and Wrexham. However, although bearing the same names, the boundaries of Flintshire and Denbighshire were substantially <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> the earlier counties. As it happened, the county records for historic Flintshire had been retained at the Hawarden branch of the Clwyd Records Office while those for historic Denbighshire had continued {{to be held at}} the Ruthin branch, so there was no problem in segregating the records.|$|E

5|$|He {{spent most}} of his early life in Richmond and at Kew Palace, where he was educated by private tutors. At the age of thirteen, he joined the Royal Navy as a midshipman, and was present at the Battle of Cape St Vincent in 1780. His {{experiences}} in the navy seem to have been little <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> other midshipmen, though in contrast to other sailors he was accompanied on board ships by a tutor. He did his share of the cooking and got arrested with his shipmates after a drunken brawl in Gibraltar; he was hastily released from custody after his identity became known.|$|E
5|$|In {{comparison}} to dogs, cats have not undergone major changes during the domestication process, as {{the form and}} behavior of the domestic cat is not radically <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> wildcats and domestic cats are perfectly capable of surviving in the wild. Fully domesticated house cats often interbreed with feral F. catus populations, producing hybrids such as the Kellas cat. This limited evolution during domestication means that hybridisation can occur with many other felids, notably the Asian leopard cat. Several natural behaviors and characteristics of wildcats may have predisposed them for domestication as pets. These traits include their small size, social nature, obvious body language, love of play and relatively high intelligence. Several small felid species may have an inborn tendency towards tameness.|$|E

5|$|Pluto's {{orbital period}} is {{presently}} about 248 years. Its orbital characteristics are substantially <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> the planets, which follow nearly circular orbits around the Sun {{close to a}} flat reference plane called the ecliptic. In contrast, Pluto's orbit is moderately inclined relative to the ecliptic (over 17Â°) and moderately eccentric (elliptical). This eccentricity means a small region of Pluto's orbit lies nearer the Sun than Neptune's. The Plutoâ€“Charon barycenter came to perihelion on September 5, 1989, and was last closer to the Sun than Neptune between February 7, 1979, and February 11, 1999.|$|E
5|$|The Antarctic scallop {{was first}} {{described}} by the British zoologist Edgar Albert Smith in 1902 as Pecten colbecki.

The German malacologist Johannes Thiele determined in 1934 that the characteristics of the Antarctic scallop were sufficiently <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> other members of the genus Pecten to warrant its inclusion in a separate genus, Adamussium. More recently, examinations of the chromosome structure and of the mitochondrial DNA of A. colbecki have been undertaken, but the exact phylogenetic relationship it has with other pectinids is still unclear.|$|E
