5|$|Madonna became {{interested}} in collaborating with Timberlake after <b>hearing</b> <b>his</b> 2006 album FutureSex/LoveSounds. Together they developed a number of songs for the album, but {{the basis of the}} development was Pharrell Williams' demos. Madonna had a number of songs written down for the album, which amazed Timberlake. They had intensive discussions among themselves before recording a song. Later, Madonna recalled that most of the songs on Hard Candy were autobiographical in many respects. However, according to her this was not intentional and happened while she {{was in the process of}} developing the album.|$|E

5|$|Word of Seymour and Edna's {{relationship}} quickly spreads throughout Springfield, {{with the}} story growing more illicit and exaggerated with each passing turn by the children. An appalled Chief Wiggum, upon <b>hearing</b> <b>his</b> son Ralph's less than accurate version of the events, alerts Superintendent Chalmers. Chalmers gives Seymour an ultimatum – end the relationship or have both of them face dismissal. Seymour decides that love is stronger than his professional goals, so Chalmers fires him and Edna, expecting them to leave the school {{at the end of}} the day.|$|E
5|$|At {{his first}} {{speech to the}} {{assembled}} troops, Alcibiades complained bitterly about {{the circumstances of his}} exile, but the greatest part of the speech consisted of boasting about his influence with Tissaphernes. The primary motives of his speech were to make the oligarchs at Athens afraid of him and to increase his credit with the army at Samos. Upon <b>hearing</b> <b>his</b> speech the troops immediately elected him General alongside Thrasybulus and the others. In fact, he roused them so much that they proposed to sail at once for Piraeus and attack the oligarchs in Athens. It was primarily Alcibiades, along with Thrasybulus, who calmed the people and showed them the folly of this proposal, which would have sparked civil war and led to the immediate defeat of Athens. Shortly after Alcibiades's reinstatement as an Athenian general, the government of the Four Hundred was overthrown and replaced by a broader oligarchy, which would eventually give way to democracy.|$|E
5|$|Both Walt Disney Pictures and DreamWorks {{bid for the}} US {{distribution}} rights. Eventually, Disney won {{the rights}} to dub the English adaptation of Spirited Away, {{under the supervision of}} Pixar animator John Lasseter. A Miyazaki fan, Lasseter would sit with his staff and watch Miyazaki's work when encountering story problems, and at one point they did so with Spirited Away, which impressed Lasseter. Upon <b>hearing</b> <b>his</b> reaction to the film, people at Disney asked Lasseter if he would be interested in trying to bring Spirited Away to an American audience. Lasseter agreed to be executive producer for English adaptation. Soon, several others began to join the project: Beauty and the Beast co-director Kirk Wise and Aladdin co-producer Donald W. Ernst joined Lasseter as director and producer of Spirited Away respectively. Cindy Davis Hewitt and Donald H. Hewitt penned the English-language dialogue, which they wrote to match the characters' original Japanese-language lip movements.|$|E

5|$|He grew up moving between council flats before {{settling}} in a three-bedroom semi-detached on a council estate in Cranford, Hounslow, he {{was fond of}} animals in his early life, and enjoyed reading the comic strips of Dan Dare. His parents separated after Audrey discovered Bill had had an affair that started while he was stationed in the army during World War II. He began attending Hounslow College and stayed there through his early teenage years. He was influenced by Elvis Presley by <b>hearing</b> <b>his</b> records at home and at the local youth club. He switched to go to Acton County Grammar School (now Acton High School) to take his O Levels, where he was in the same class as Pete Townshend, but became distracted from studies after leaving the local cinema having watched a Presley film, deciding {{that he wanted to be}} a rock'n'roll singer. He subsequently took a job manufacturing ice machines in Hounslow.|$|E
5|$|South Carolina Congressman Frank Underwood (Kevin Spacey), the Democratic Majority Whip, {{leaves his}} house in Washington, D.C. after <b>hearing</b> <b>his</b> neighbors’ dog {{get hit by a}} car. As he comforts the mortally-wounded dog, he looks into the camera and says “Moments like this require someone who will act, who will do the {{unpleasant}} thing, the necessary thing,” before calmly proceeding to strangle it. This introduces both his habit of breaking the fourth wall to narrate, and his cold and vicious nature. Frank and his wife, Claire (Robin Wright), go on to attend a New Year’s Eve party in honor of the new President-elect, Garrett Walker (Michel Gill), a fellow Democrat and winner of the 2012 election. Frank confesses to the viewer that he does not like Walker, but saw his political potential early on and ingratiated himself to him, putting himself in line to be nominated as Walker’s Secretary of State after 22 years in Congress.|$|E
5|$|The {{first story}} is about the opening of Shiva's third eye when he visits Madurai, {{the capital city of}} the Pandya Kingdom, ruled at that time by Shenbagapandian. Shenbagapandian wants to find the answer to a {{question}} posed by his wife— whether the fragrance from a woman's hair is natural or artificial— and announces a reward of 1000gold coins to anyone who can come up with the answer. A poor poet named Dharumi desperately wants the reward and starts to break down in the Meenakshi Amman Temple. Shiva, <b>hearing</b> <b>his</b> cries, {{takes the form of a}} poet and gives Dharumi a poem containing the answer. Overjoyed, Dharumi takes the poem to Shenbagapandian's court and recites it, but Nakkeerar, the court's head poet, claims the poem's meaning is incorrect. On hearing this, Shiva argues with Nakkeerar about the poem's accuracy, burning him to ashes when he refuses to relent. Later, Shiva revives Nakkeerar, and says that he only wanted to test his knowledge. Nakkeerar asks the king to give the reward to Dharumi.|$|E

No sooner did Hutton make his first entrance in The Golden Spiders than he melded completely with the Archie of my mind's eye.

25|$|In {{the past}} the Anglican Church on the prairies had a profile, {{for better or worse}} and with greater or lesser legitimacy, of being {{somewhat}} exclusive. This was never wholly accurate, though it certainly had ample documentation: At one point Bishop Harding, the Church of England Bishop, was quoted at a meeting — when he was imprudently unaware that local Canadians were <b>hearing</b> <b>his</b> remarks — as observing that English Anglican migrants might be more attractive settlers than Presbyterian and Methodist Canadians, occasioning considerable adverse notice and animosity against the English in the general community.|$|E
