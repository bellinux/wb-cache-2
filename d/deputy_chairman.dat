5|$|Brezhnev's {{consolidation}} {{to power}} weakened Kosygin's influence and prestige within the Politburo. By the 1970s, when Kosygin's position was given one blow after another, he was frequently hospitalised and at several occasions Kiril Mazurov, the First <b>Deputy</b> <b>chairman</b> of the Council of Ministers, acted {{on his behalf}} during Kosygin's absence. Kosygin suffered his first heart attack in 1976. After this incident, {{it is said that}} Kosygin changed from having a vibrant personality to being tired and fed up; he, according to people close to him, seemed to have lost the will to continue his work. He twice filed a letter of resignation between 1976 and 1980, but was turned down on both occasions. During Kosygin's sick leave, Brezhnev appointed Nikolai Tikhonov to the post of First <b>Deputy</b> <b>Chairman</b> of the Council of Ministers. Tikhonov, as with Brezhnev, was a conservative, and through his post as First <b>Deputy</b> <b>chairman</b> Tikhonov was able to reduce Kosygin to a standby role. At a Central Committee plenum in June 1980, the Soviet economic development plan was outlined by Tikhonov, not Kosygin. The powers of the Premier diminished to the point where Kosygin was forced to discuss all decisions made by the Council of Ministers with Brezhnev.|$|E

50|$|In 1987 the Council of Ministers {{consisted}} of a <b>chairman,</b> two first <b>deputy</b> <b>chairmen,</b> and nine <b>deputy</b> <b>chairmen,</b> all of whom constituted an inner circle called the Presidium of the Council of Ministers. The chairman of the Council of Ministers, Willi Stoph, {{was head of the}} government (prime minister). Stoph, a representative of the old guard and a Politbüro member since 1953, was again appointed council chairman in 1986. Unlike the nine <b>deputy</b> <b>chairmen,</b> the two first <b>deputy</b> <b>chairmen,</b> Politbüro members Werner Krolikowski and Alfred Neumann, generally had not been responsible for specific ministerial portfolios.|$|R
50|$|In {{referring}} to the Council of State, the Constitution declared that it consisted of the <b>chairman,</b> <b>deputy</b> <b>chairmen,</b> members, and secretary; it did not specify the number of <b>deputy</b> <b>chairmen</b> and members. In 1987, under the chairmanship of Honecker, there were eight <b>deputy</b> <b>chairmen</b> and seventeen members. In addition to Honecker, two of the <b>deputy</b> <b>chairmen,</b> Horst Sindermann and Willi Stoph, {{were members of the}} Politbüro of the SED; Stoph was also chairman of the Council of Ministers, and Sindermann was president of the People's Chamber. Four of the <b>deputy</b> <b>chairmen</b> of the Council of State represented the other four political parties, as did four of its seventeen members. The day-to-day functions of the council were carried on by a staff consisting in 1987 of twenty offices and departments, all of which were headed by SED members. Despite the presence of non-SED members as <b>deputy</b> <b>chairmen</b> and members of the leadership group, SED control was guaranteed by the presence of Honecker, Stoph, Sindermann, and Egon Krenz, probably the four most powerful individuals in the country.|$|R

40|$|There {{is general}} {{consensus}} that Chairmen are trustworthy individuals of integrity. The openness and mutual respect {{in their relationships}} with CEOs and MDs is ranked highly by all Board members and their commitment to organisational goals is valued. Nevertheless, there is a perception, particularly among <b>Deputy</b> <b>Chairmen,</b> that Chairmen seek insufficient feedback on their own performance. Similarly, <b>Deputy</b> <b>Chairmen</b> see Chairmen as being illdisciplined, suggesting that {{there is room for}} improvement around the area of internal governance...|$|R

5|$|Taraki was {{appointed}} Chairman of the Revolutionary Council and Chairman of the Council of Ministers while retaining his post as PDPA general secretary. He initially formed a government {{which consisted of}} both Khalqists and Parchamites; Karmal became <b>Deputy</b> <b>Chairman</b> of the Presidium of the Revolutionary Council while Amin became Minister of Foreign Affairs and <b>Deputy</b> <b>Chairman</b> of the Council of Ministers. Internal problems soon arose and several prominent Khalqists accused the Parcham faction of conspiring against the Taraki government. A Khalqi purge of the Parcham then began with the faction's most prominent members being sent out of the country: Karmal became Afghan Ambassador to Czechoslovakia and Mohammad Najibullah became Afghan Ambassador to Iran. Internal struggle was not only to be found between the Khalqist and Parchamites; tense rivalry between Taraki and Amin had begun in the Khalq faction with both vying for control.|$|E
5|$|After {{finishing}} his studies, Kosygin was {{employed as a}} textile mill director. Three years later, he was elected Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Leningrad City Soviets of Working People's Deputies by the Leningrad Communist Party, and the following year he was appointed People's Commissar for Textile and Industry and earned {{a seat on the}} Central Committee (CC).

5|$|Alan Ball the {{previous}} chairman became executive <b>deputy</b> <b>chairman,</b> with Smallpeice requesting a non-executive <b>deputy</b> <b>chairman</b> position, which was quickly agreed to. Sandys and Smallpeice {{were joined by}} a third new board member, the Conservative politician Edward du Cann and the new board constituted in March 1972. The board quickly become concerned at the behaviour of their chief executive Tiny Rowland who had agreed in principle to finance a sugar refinery in Sudan {{at a cost of}} £80 to £100 million, whilst the company {{was in the midst of}} refinancing itself. The board was able to reword the agreement and it became a feasibility study, recovering the situation but respite from a further crisis would prove to be short lived. The situation at Lonrho went from bad to worse during early 1973, when Peats, Lonrho's auditors, discovered payments totalling £44,000 made from a subsidiary company based in the Cayman Islands to Duncan Sandys. Sandys, believing that the payment had been authorised by the board returned in full the money he had received.|$|E
