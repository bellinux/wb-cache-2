40|$|Composting is {{a robust}} waste {{treatment}} technology. Use of finished compost enables plant nutrient recycling, carbon sequestration, soil structure improvement and mineral fertiliser replacement.

50|$|Anaerobic {{digestion}} of {{the organic}} fraction of municipal solid waste (MSW) {{has been found to}} be in a number of LCA analysis studies to be more environmentally effective, than landfill, incineration or pyrolysis. The resulting biogas (methane) though must be used for cogeneration (electricity and heat preferably on or close to the site of production) and can be used with a little upgrading in gas combustion engines or turbines. With further upgrading to synthetic natural gas it can be injected into the natural gas network or further refined to hydrogen for use in stationary cogeneration fuel cells. Its use in fuel cells eliminates the pollution from products of combustion.

As more waste is recycled as compost, it is becoming increasingly important to find alternative uses for compost. Leachability data are used to determine the environmental availability of Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn contained in natural compost. Batch sorption data are used to determine uptake of additional Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn by compost and assess its potential use in remediation work, as an alternative to natural materials such as peat. The relative binding of these additional metals to compost is found to be in the order Pb>Cu≈Cd>Zn. The sorption of metals on compost takes place, at least in part, by exchange of calcium bound to the compost and there is evidence that the sorption occurs in both the humic and non-humic sites in the compost. The use of compost to bind metals in remediation work is discussed...|$|R
5000|$|The {{terminology}} {{used in the}} bioplastics sector is sometimes misleading. Most in the industry use the term bioplastic to mean a plastic produced from a biological source. All (bio- and petroleum-based) plastics are technically biodegradable, meaning they can be degraded by microbes under suitable conditions. However, many degrade so slowly that they are considered non-biodegradable. Some petrochemical-based plastics are considered biodegradable, and {{may be used as}} an additive to improve the performance of commercial bioplastics. Non-biodegradable bioplastics are referred to as durable. The biodegradability of bioplastics depends on temperature, polymer stability, and available oxygen content. The European standard EN 13432, published by the International Organization for Standardization, defines how quickly and to what extent a plastic must be degraded under the tightly controlled and aggressive conditions (at or above [...] ) of an industrial composting unit for it to be considered biodegradable. This standard is recognized in many countries, including all of Europe, Japan and the US. However, it applies only to industrial composting units and does not set out a standard for <b>home</b> <b>composting.</b> Most bioplastics (e.g. PH) only biodegrade quickly in industrial composting units. These materials do not biodegrade quickly in ordinary compost piles or in the soil/water. Starch-based bioplastics are an exception, and will biodegrade in normal composting conditions.|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{composting}} activity will be {{an integral}} part of meeting the obligations of EU Directives, however, the extent to which composting at home can play its part still remains poorly defined. Reliable and comprehensive statistics on <b>home</b> <b>composting</b> are very difficult to obtain as the activity cannot be monitored effectively. It is an activity that is entirely in the hands of the people, and it is the voluntary behaviours of those people, that will ultimately determine the success of <b>home</b> <b>composting</b> within any waste management strategy. Understanding <b>home</b> <b>composting</b> means understanding the people that compost. To date, most waste management strategies have concentrated on recycling with relatively little attention being paid to <b>home</b> <b>composting.</b> According to requirements of EU Directives and legislation on landfilling of waste sustainable waste management practices need to be developed. Composting of organic waste provides a viable alternative to landfill at the present time. Although <b>home</b> <b>composting</b> is rated highly on the hierarchy of control, little has been achieved in Ireland to develop <b>home</b> <b>composting</b> as an effective means of diverting the organic fraction of waste from landfill.

40|$|<b>Home</b> <b>composting</b> and {{commercial}} composting {{can be regarded}} as part of the Municipal Solid Waste Management system. Currently, in Palmerston North and more broadly in New Zealand, <b>home</b> <b>composting</b> plays an important, but an unquantified role in waste diversion. In Palmerston North, the quantity of organic waste diverted from landfill via <b>home</b> <b>composting</b> is not captured in the City’s official ‘waste assessment’ or recorded in the ‘waste management and minimisation plan’. Additionally, there appears to be little local social and technical data on why, who, when, what and how well <b>home</b> <b>composting</b> is practised. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop and implement a methodology for a mixed-method quantitative-qualitative study for the quantification and evaluation of <b>home</b> <b>composting</b> practices in Palmerston North. The development process for the research methodology drew upon an international literature review of scientific research, a range of municipal best practice guidelines for <b>home</b> <b>composting</b> and referenced elements of the New Zealand composting standard. The data collection for this study involved a combined telephone and door-to-door survey of 300 households (that is, approximately 1 % of occupied dwellings, randomly selected from across all 15 suburbs in the City). To support the physical data collection, a novel <b>home</b> <b>composting</b> evaluation tool was also developed and trialled for empirical and quality assurance evaluation. The overall participation rate recorded in the present study (64 %) was high and both data collection methods proved to be viable, yielding positive results. 36 % of the households who participated in the present study were home composters which could mean that about 10, 761 households in the occupied dwellings of the City practise <b>home</b> <b>composting.</b> At the time of the survey, it appears that nearly 4005 tonnes of organic waste was being treated via <b>home</b> <b>composting</b> processes. The results also indicated positive quality assurance of the <b>home</b> <b>composting</b> process and the resulting compost in the City.

40|$|Despite {{the image}} of {{buildings}} and petrified areas, a considerable part of urban and rural residential areas consists out of domestic gardens (Gaston et al., 2005), the nearest nature for many urban, semi-urban as well as rural dwellers. But how natural are these gardens? A large diversity by fragmentation in area {{as well as in}} property results in a large diversity in garden management. This management, in many cases under control of the garden owner, generates an intricate garden system with materials being brought in (inputs, like fertilizers and pesticides), materials being processed (stock, like green garden waste that is being composted) and materials being exported (outputs, like grass clippings). To what level are our gardens managed, what is the environmental impact and is it possible to monitor this? Gardens tend to be missing in land use, environmental as well as socio-economical statistics (Zmyslony and Gagnon, 1998). The research proposed here therefore collects new data on gardens. A garden is defined here as the part of the residential parcel without the associated house. Pasture for hobby farming, extensive woodlots and storage space for building materials or refuse are excluded from this definition. For Flanders, the northern part of Belgium, a regional-wide internet-survey has been conducted on garden components and management, including an inventory and quantification of inputs and outputs from the garden. Also data on socio-economical characteristics of the garden owner were collected. A number of 1. 138 respondents was considered for analysis, corresponding to 0, 13 % of the garden area in Flanders as determined by Dewaelheyns et al. (2008). For the quantification of inputs and outputs by means of an internet-survey, convenient metrics needed to be developed. A selection of survey results will be presented, including fertilizers, <b>home</b> <b>compost</b> and grass clippings. They support the idea that gardens in Flanders are a very dynamic type of land use, generating a number of material flows to and from the wider environment. Follow-up research will search for links between easily measurable characteristics of the garden (e. g. the percentage lawn within the garden area) or socio-economical characteristics of the garden owner (e. g. occupation and garden perception) with management characteristics (such as the use of fertilizers, pesticides or herbicides). It will be explored how useful existing links can be for a systematic environmental monitoring of gardens. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|In Lithuania {{main part}} of {{biodegradable}} waste (BDW) from the municipal waste (MW) stream, food waste from coffees and other catering companies are disposed of in landfills. Primary BDW sorting and / or secondary processing within the mechanical-biological treatment (MBT) equipment is planned in Waste Management Plants (WMP) in all Lithuanian regions. Lithuania has old traditions of BDW management methods, as green waste (GW) composting e. g. mulching {{is one of the}} most popular, especially in rural areas. Therefore, reinstatement of composting traditions by implementing modern composters (composting bins) in the territories of individual households is practically provided by all WMP. Composting of sorted BDW from MW stream and GW from public territories or green areas of companies is one of the useful BDW management methods, because, first of all, a new product – bio-compost is produced and used for agricultural purposes.

40|$|Worms can compost garbage {{faster than}} {{any other type of}} {{composting}} method. Worms also are veryefficient in digesting kitchen food wastes. Each day a worm eats half its weight in food. The care and feeding of worms take far less effort than maintaining an outdoor compost pile. Some of the realized benefits of keeping a worm bin include recycling kitchen food waste, reducing waste disposal costs, producing soil amendments or fertilizer for house and garden plants and having a ready supply of fishing worms. A worm bin is a self contained system. As with any system, several components are involved. This system is composed of a box to contain the worms (a description of how to build a worm bin follows on the next page); the worms themselves; a controlled environment; and regular maintenance procedures. Red worms are the most satisfactory worms to use in a <b>home</b> vermicomposting (<b>composting</b> with worms) system. The species of red worm best suited for a worm bin is Eisenia foetida pronounced “I see nee a fet id a. ” Eisenia Foetida is known by several common names: red worm, brandling worm, red wiggler, manure worm and fish worm among others. Starter worms of this species for a worm bin may be found in old compost piles (ones that no longer generate any heat) or from local bait suppliers. Once the worm bin is constructed, make bedding for the worms with shredded and moistened newspaper or cardboard. Maintain the system by burying food wastes throughout the bin on a rotational basis. Every three to six months, move the compost {{to one side of the}} bin and add new bedding to the empty half. The worms will soon move to the new bedding. Harvest the compost and add new bedding to the rest of the bin. Measure and cut plywood as indicated on drawing A.
