40|$|In {{order to}} {{separate}} automatically round materials fed by a mainly vertical feed hopper easily and reliably, {{and to be}} able to feed the downstream processing unit mainly by means of a horizontal conveyor belt, a swivel gripping device is arranged below the feed hopper (17) between a first swivel position placed below the feed hopper (17 a) and a second swivel position at the inlet to the conveying device for the downstream processing unit, the swivel gripping device (24) having an adjoining fork-shaped recess (12 c) in the first swivel position of the gripping device (24) of the bottom opening (17 a) of the feed hopper (17) suitable for receiving one round material item (18) at a time, and on the fork-shaped recess (12 c) being a retaining device (21) and an <b>ejecting</b> <b>device</b> (32) for the material item (18) located in the recess. The swivelling of the gripping device (24) and the operation of the <b>ejecting</b> <b>device</b> (32) are effected each by means of a cylinder (8, 33) ...|$|E
40|$|There is {{a strong}} need to improve our current {{capabilities}} in thermal management and electronic cooling. The present study investigates an original micro-scale membrane-actuated dropwise condenser and evaporator. An actuated membrane is adopted as the droplet condensing and <b>ejecting</b> <b>device.</b> Droplets with appropriate dimensions and frequencies are formed and ejected for efficient cooling. The system design parameters and operating performances are estimated for droplet sizes ranging from 10 to 500 Î¼m. It is demonstrated that, in this operating range, the gravity effect is small, making this device ideal for both earthbound and spacecraft applications. This paper reports the thermodynamic consideration based on a vapor-compression cycle to assess the performance of such a device, and solutions from direct numerical simulation to highlight the flow structure associated with the two-phase media...|$|E
40|$|There is {{a strong}} need to improve our current {{capabilities}} in thermal management and electronic cooling. The present study investigates the feasibility of a micro-scale membrane-actuated dropwise condenser/evaporator. An actuated membrane is adopted as the droplet condensing and <b>ejecting</b> <b>device.</b> Droplets with appropriate dimensions and frequencies are formed and ejected for efficient cooling. The present system requires no mechanical moving parts, and hence is reliable. In addition, it needs little maintenance due to closed recirculation, exhibits favorable packaging scalability {{in view of the}} modular concept, and offers high energy transfer effectiveness. In this work, we outline the thermodynamic consideration based on a vapor-compression cycle to assess the performance of such a device. The coefficient of performance of the cycle is estimated for four different fluids: water, R 12, R 134 a and FC- 72. The system design parameters and operating performances are estimated for droplet sizes ranging from 10 to 500 micrometers. It is demonstrated that in this operating range, the gravity effect is small, making this device ideal for both earth-bound and spacecraft applications...|$|E

5000|$|In {{mid to late}} 2009 a tool named Detect and Eliminate Computer Acquired Forensics (DECAF) was {{announced}} by an uninvolved group of programmers. The tool would reportedly protect computers against COFEE and render the tool ineffective. It alleged that it would provide real-time monitoring of COFEE signatures on USB devices and in running applications and when a COFEE signature is detected, DECAF performs numerous user-defined processes. These included COFEE log clearing, <b>ejecting</b> USB <b>devices,</b> and contamination or spoofing of MAC addresses. On December 18, 2009 the DECAF creators announced that the tool was a hoax and part of [...] "a stunt to raise awareness for security {{and the need for}} better forensic tools".|$|R
50|$|On teletypewriters {{and early}} keyboards, holding down the Control key while {{pressing}} another key zeroed the leftmost two {{bits of the}} seven bits in the generated ASCII character. This allowed the operator to produce the first 32 characters in the ASCII table. These are non-printing characters that signal the computer to control where the next character will {{be placed on the}} display <b>device,</b> <b>eject</b> a printed page or erase the screen, ring the terminal bell, or some other operation.

25|$|In {{order to}} avoid {{excessive}} pressure build-up in the hydraulic power network, a release valve was fitted beside the main hall of the powerhouse. A tall water fountain, the Jet d'Eau, was <b>ejected</b> by the <b>device</b> whenever it was activated. This happened typically at end of work when the factories switched off the machines one at the time, so that the pressure in the system was hard to control and the supply of pressurized water was difficult {{to adapt to the}} real demand. The tall fountain was visible from a long distance and became the landmark of the city. In 1891 it was moved to the current location in the lake where it is operated {{for the sole purpose of}} a tourist attraction without any other function.|$|R
500|$|The {{scenes in}} the terraced street in Leeds were filmed in Machen Street, Penarth, on 4 December and 5 December. The cast listened to The Pogues' [...] "The Wild Rover" [...] and Queen's [...] "Bohemian Rhapsody" [...] before singing the songs themselves. Graeme Harper decided to focus on Jacqueline King in the scene when her character, Sylvia Noble, stares vacantly in a despondent manner as Donna talks to her; Harper {{considered}} the scene to be [...] "Jacqueline's moment" [...] and thought the scene would be more powerful if the focus was kept on one character. The outdoor scenes were filmed on 5 December: the Colasanto family being sent to a labour camp was filmed during the day; and the ATMOS <b>devices</b> <b>ejecting</b> exhaust fumes was filmed in the evening.|$|R
40|$|Object of {{this paper}} are {{experimental}} and numerical investigations of the Combustion Induced Vortex Breakdown (CIVB) phenomenon in a free straight vortex. The experiments were performed using a swirl generation device. A swirling jet of premixed methane/air is <b>ejected</b> by this <b>device</b> into the ambient surrounding air. At some distance above the swirler nozzle, there is a ring burner mounted which holds a stationary flame. When conditions for a flashback are met, the flame of the ring burner propagates against the main flow back to the nozzle. Numerical simulations of the flashback event were performed using the open source finite volume code OpenFOAM. To model the influence of turbulence, the large-eddy simulation technique was applied. For combustion modelling, a flame surface wrinkling model was used. LES simulations confirmed {{the fact that the}} CIVB appears in the vortex configuration considered. Detailed analysis of the LES data allows to estimate contributions of different physical mechanisms to the CIVB...|$|R
50|$|Shiva Star {{was also}} used to develop an {{experimental}} weapon known as MARAUDER for the SDI effort between 1989 and 1995. The idea {{appears to have been}} to create compact toroids of high-density plasma that would be <b>ejected</b> from the <b>device</b> using a massive magnetic pulse. The plasma projectiles would be shot at a speed expected to be 3000 km/s in 1995 and 10,000 km/s (3% of the speed of light) by 2000. A shot has the energy of 5 pounds of TNT exploding. Doughnut-shaped rings of plasma and balls of lightning exploded with devastating thermal and mechanical effects when hitting their target and produced pulse of electromagnetic radiation that could scramble electronics, the energy would shower the interior of the target with high-energy x-rays that would potentially destroy the electronics inside. The tests cost a few million dollars a year. The project become classified and {{may or may not have}} been scrapped at some time after 1995 because of problems keeping the plasma projectiles stable for the distances required by orbital weaponry.|$|R
50|$|The {{fact that}} the current is carried by a corona {{discharge}} (and not a tightly-confined arc) means that the moving particles are diffusely spread out into an expanding ion cloud, and collide frequently with neutral air molecules. It is these collisions that create a net movement. The momentum of the ion cloud is partially imparted onto the neutral air molecules that it collides with, which, being neutral, do not eventually migrate back to the second electrode. Instead they continue to travel in the same direction, creating a neutral wind. As these neutral molecules are ejected from the ionocraft, there are, in agreement with Newton's Third Law of Motion, equal and opposite forces, so the ionocraft moves {{in the opposite direction}} with an equal force. There are hundreds of thousands of molecules per second <b>ejected</b> from the <b>device,</b> so the force exerted is comparable to a gentle breeze. Still, this is enough to make a light balsa model lift its own weight. The resulting thrust also depends on other external factors including air pressure and temperature, gas composition, voltage, humidity, and air gap distance.|$|R
50|$|To {{initially}} {{set up the}} MojoPac device, {{the user}} runs the installer and selects a USB device attached to the system. Once MojoPac is installed, it creates an executable in the root of that device along with an autorun file that gives the user the option of starting the MojoPac environment automatically when the device is plugged in (subject to how the host PC is configured). Once this application is started, a new Windows Desktop (with its own wallpaper, icons, shell, etc.) is started up in the virtualized MojoPac environment. Any application that runs inside this environment runs off the USB device without affecting the filesystem of the host. A user installs most applications (including Microsoft Office, Adobe Photoshop, Firefox) on the portable storage device by simply running the installer inside this environment. The user can switch between the host environment and the MojoPac environment by using the MojoBar {{at the top of}} the screen. Once the user is done with the applications, they exit MojoPac and <b>eject</b> the USB <b>device.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Colt had {{produced}} a revolver for the U.S. Army called the M1909, {{a version of}} their heavy-frame, [...]45-caliber, New Service model in [...]45 M1909, {{a version of the}} [...]45 Long Colt with an enlarged rim to facilitate extraction, to supplement and replace a range of 1890s-era [...]38 caliber Colt and Smith & Wesson revolvers that had demonstrated inadequate stopping power during the Philippine-American War. The Colt M1917 Revolver was a New Service with a cylinder bored to take the [...]45 ACP cartridge and the half-moon clips to hold the rimless cartridges in position. Later production Colt M1917 revolvers had headspacing machined into the cylinder chambers, just as the Smith & Wesson M1917 revolvers had from the start. Newer Colt production could be fired without the half-moon clips, but the empty cartridge cases had to be <b>ejected</b> with a <b>device</b> such as a cleaning rod or pencil, as the cylinder extractor and ejector would pass over the rims of the rimless cartridges. During its lifetime, the Colt New Service was the most popular revolver made by Colt, surpassing 150,000 units. After World War I, the revolver gained a strong following among civilian shooters.|$|R

40|$|Because cometary {{surfaces}} {{are likely to}} be far colder and of a different composition than planetary surfaces, there are some new considerations that must be examined in regards to placing instrumented packages or sample return devices on their surfaces. The qualitative analysis of the problem of attaching hardware to a comet and not being ejected back into space can be divided into two parts. The first problem is to pierce the mantle and obtain access to the icy core. Drilling through the mantle requires that the drilling forces be reacted. Reacting such forces probably requires attachment to the icy core below. Therefore, some kinetic impact piercing device is likely to be required as the first act of attachment. The second problem for a piercing device to overcome is the force produced by the impact kinetic energy that tries to <b>eject</b> the piercing <b>device</b> back into space. The mantle and icy core can absorb some of the impact kinetic energy in the form of fracture formation and friction energy. The energy that is not absorbed in these two ways is stored by the core as elastic deformation of the mantle and icy core. It is concluded that because the cometary materials are almost certainly brittle and the icy core is likely to be self lubricating, the elastic rebound and gas pressure expulsion forces must be counteracted by forces greater than those that may be provided by a piercing device or its capture devices (barbs) ...|$|R
