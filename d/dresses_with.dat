5|$|In {{the late}} 1930s, {{just before the}} {{outbreak}} of World War II, there was {{a revival of the}} hooped crinoline from designers such as Edward Molyneux, who put hoops in both day skirts and evening gowns, and Norman Hartnell, whose late 1930s Winterhalter-inspired crinoline designs for Queen Elizabeth were so successful that the Queen is popularly (if inaccurately) credited with having single-handedly brought crinolines back into fashion. Both as Queen, and as the Queen Mother, Elizabeth adopted the traditional bell-shaped crinoline as her signature look for evening wear and state occasions. The film Gone With The Wind, released in 1939, inspired the American fashion for prom <b>dresses</b> <b>with</b> crinolines in Spring 1940.|$|E
5|$|The {{teaching}} of Eskayan in the volunteer schools {{is one of}} the few remaining cultural practices of the Eskaya community. Formerly, Eskaya men would wear shirts made of piña raffia with a Chinese-style collar, black breeches, and cotton berets. Women wore piña <b>dresses</b> <b>with</b> bulging sleeves similar to the Spanish-influenced Boholano style (mostly in Biabas) and covered their hair with cotton habits (mostly in Taytay). Traditionally, women were not permitted to cut their hair short nor wear trousers, and drinking and dancing were universally prohibited. For the most part these customs have been discontinued, however traditional dress is sometimes worn on Sundays and special occasions.|$|E
5|$|A {{pastiche}} {{of following}} scenes alternates between Spears {{dancing on the}} soundstage, singing with the microphones and a scene of just red lips, {{a reference to the}} opening shot of the 1975 film The Rocky Horror Picture Show. This begins to show her losing grip, reminiscent of her break down. When the breakdown starts, she begins to eject painting through IVs in her fingers, staining the room and the monitors, symbolizing her own fall as her name becomes tainted. Then, two versions of Spears, both wearing blue and red <b>dresses</b> <b>with</b> flowing trains, are seen fighting each other, another symbolism, this time of her fighting her inner demons. After this, both versions of Spears, as well as her on the wedding dress, fall exhausted to the ground, symbolizing the lowest point of her life during the breakdown. While interspersed scenes of Spears in the soundstage are shown, the other versions of herself start to wake up, showing her getting her feet back on the ground and making a comeback, refusing to give up. The final scene shows Spears dressed in a short black dress with her dancers in black on a stage, with confetti and pyrotechnics around them. In the final shot a question mark (?) appears in multicolored letters. This final scene shows her as she once was, a superstar who is back to reclaim her title. The video ends with the same multicolored lettering of a question mark, symbolizing the unknown that is to come.|$|E

40|$|This {{work was}} carried out to study the effect of topical {{application}} of Andrographis paniculata on the rate of wound enclosure and its histological features. A wound was created in four groups of rat in posterior neck region. Blank placebo was applied topically to the wounds of Group 1. Groups 2 and 3 were <b>dressed</b> <b>with</b> placebo containing 5 % and 10 % extracts of A. paniculata, respectively. Intrasite gel was applied topically to the wounds of Group 4. Macroscopical examination revealed {{that the rate of}} wound healing was significantly accelerated in the wound <b>dressed</b> <b>with</b> A. paniculata extract compared to the blank placebo. The wounds <b>dressed</b> <b>with</b> 10 % extract or Intrasite gel healed earlier compared to the wounds <b>dressed</b> <b>with</b> placebo containing 5 % A. paniculata extract. Histologically, wounds <b>dressed</b> <b>with</b> A. paniculata extracts showed markedly less scar width and contained large amounts of fibroblast proliferation. More collagen and less angiogenesis with absence of inflammatory cells were seen for wounds <b>dressed</b> <b>with</b> 10 % A. paniculata compared to the blank placebo. Conclusion, A. paniculata extracts significantly enhanced rate of wound healing in rats. © 2012 Taylor & Francis...|$|R

25|$|While most male cross-dressers utilize {{clothing}} {{associated with}} modern women, some {{are involved in}} subcultures that involve dressing as little girls or in vintage clothing. Some such men have written that they enjoy dressing as femininely as possible, so they wear frilly <b>dresses</b> <b>with</b> lace and ribbons, bridal gowns complete with veils, as well as multiple petticoats, corsets, girdles and/or garter belts with nylon stockings.|$|E
25|$|Following Alice's death, Queen Victoria {{resolved}} {{to act as}} a mother to her Hessian grandchildren.

25|$|Dix set {{guidelines}} for nurse candidates. Volunteers {{were to be}} aged 35 to 50 and plain-looking. They were required to wear unhooped black or brown <b>dresses,</b> <b>with</b> no jewelry or cosmetics. Dix wanted to avoid sending vulnerable, attractive young women into the hospitals, where she feared they would be exploited by the men (doctors as well as patients). Dix often fired volunteer nurses she hadn't personally trained or hired (earning the ire of supporting groups like the United States Sanitary Commission).|$|E

25|$|Skeletons {{were put}} in extravagant <b>dresses</b> <b>with</b> braids in their hair, {{altering}} the image of Posada's original La Catrina. As opposed to being the political message Posada intended, the skeletons of equality became skeletal images which were appealing to tourists and the national folkloric Mexican identity. In the past decade the regeneration {{of the social and}} political meaning and emergence of Doña Queta's statue has formed cult of Our Lady of the Holy Death, despite strong condemnation by the Catholic Church and other Christian churches.|$|E
25|$|Generally, in the Middle Ages {{the breasts}} were {{minimized}} in <b>dresses</b> <b>with</b> straight bodices, full skirts and high necklines, designed primarily for function rather than emphasis on form. Late medieval dresses are fitted precisely and snugly {{to the body}} and function as breast support. Depictions of women in 14th- and 15th-century art show a high, rounded breast silhouette on women old and young, full-busted and small. This look is not possible without support. The 15th-century ideal form was small-breasted and full-figured, symbolizing abundance of fertility.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, several artists {{tried to}} work with clothes design with varying success: Varvara Stepanova {{designed}} <b>dresses</b> <b>with</b> bright, geometric patterns that were mass-produced, although workers' overalls by Tatlin and Rodchenko never achieved this and remained prototypes. The painter and designer Lyubov Popova designed a kind of Constructivist flapper dress before her early death in 1924, the plans for which {{were published in the}} journal LEF. In these works, Constructivists showed a willingness to involve themselves in fashion and the mass market, which they tried to balance with their Communist beliefs.|$|E

25|$|Fashionable {{clothing}} {{in the early}} 1980s included both unisex and gender-specific attire. Widespread fashions {{for women in the}} early 1980s included sweaters (including turtleneck, crew neck, and v-neck varieties); fur-lined puffer jackets; tunics; faux-fur coats; velvet blazers; trench coats (made in both fake and real leather); crop tops; tube tops; knee-length skirts (of no prescribed length, as designers opted for choice); loose, flowy, knee-length <b>dresses</b> (<b>with</b> high-cut and low-cut necklines, varying sleeve lengths, and made in a variety of fabrics including cotton, silk, satin, and polyester); high-waisted loose pants; embroidered jeans; leather pants; and designer jeans. Women's pants of the 1980s were, in general, worn with long inseams – a style carried over from the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|The {{second act}} takes {{place after the}} dinner. In spite of Arabella {{spending}} the entire dinner unconscious, and Paige and Micky joining the meal and messing up the cutlery arrangement, things have evidently gone well. Julie-Ann, having swapped <b>dresses</b> <b>with</b> Paige at some point, attempts to make things up with Arabella, although Arabella never seems to grasp which girl is which. However, things start to go downhill when Derek has a private word with Justin. Derek suggests Justin should move up to Doncaster to take over his garden centre business, oblivious to Justin's hints {{that he is not}} interested. Furthermore, Justin learns from Derek that the reason Derek and Dee fell out with Julie-Ann's two sisters was because {{one of them is a}} lesbian and the other married a Chinese man.|$|E
25|$|Incorporated in {{this new}} “natural” style was the {{importance}} of ease and comfort of one's dress. Not only was there a new emphasis on hygiene, but also clothing became much lighter and more able to be changed and washed frequently. Even upper class women began wearing cropped dresses as opposed to <b>dresses</b> <b>with</b> long trains or hoops that restricted them from leaving their homes. In a sense, women were influenced by male fashion, such as tailored waistcoats and jackets to emphasize women’s mobility. This new movement toward practicality of dress showed that dress became less {{of a way to}} solely categorize between classes or genders; dress was meant to suit one's personal daily routine. It was also during this time period that the fashion magazine and journal industry began to take off. They were most often monthly (often competing) periodicals that allowed men and women {{to keep up with the}} ever-changing styles.|$|E
