5|$|GreenSky London, a {{biofuels}} plant {{under construction}} in 2014, aimed to take in some 500,000 tonnes of municipal rubbish and change the organic component into 60,000 tonnes of jet fuel, and 40 megawatts of power. By the end of 2015, it was hoped all British Airways flights from London City Airport will be fuelled by waste and rubbish discarded by London residents, leading to carbon savings equivalent to taking 150,000 cars off the road. Unfortunately, the £340m scheme was mothballed in January 2016 following low crude oil prices, <b>jittery</b> investors {{and a lack of}} support from the UK government.|$|E
25|$|While Jan Ingenhousz {{described}} the irregular motion of coal dust particles {{on the surface}} of alcohol in 1785, the discovery of this phenomenon is often credited to the botanist Robert Brown in 1827. Brown was studying pollen grains of the plant Clarkia pulchella suspended in water under a microscope when he observed minute particles, ejected by the pollen grains, executing a <b>jittery</b> motion. By repeating the experiment with particles of inorganic matter he was able to rule out that the motion was life-related, although its origin was yet to be explained.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, while Buenaventura {{was still}} head of PCIB, his old schoolmate, Joseph Estrada, was elected {{president}} of the country. Buenaventura was subsequently asked to head the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), the Philippine central monetary authority, as central bank governor. The incumbent governor of the BSP, Gabriel C. Singson, had turned in his courtesy resignation, but the financial market was already in turmoil following the outbreak of the Asian financial crisis in 1997. Removing the incumbent central bank chief would have added uncertainty in an already <b>jittery</b> market, so Buenaventura promptly turned down the offer.|$|E
25|$|New wave {{represented}} {{a break from}} the blues and rock & roll sounds of late 1960s to mid-1970s rock music. According to Simon Reynolds, the music had a twitchy, agitated feel to it. New wave musicians often played choppy rhythm guitars with fast tempos, and keyboards were common as were stop-start song structures and melodies. Reynolds noted that new wave vocalists sounded high-pitched, geeky and suburban. A nervous, nerdy persona was a common characteristic of new wave fans and acts such as Talking Heads, Devo and Elvis Costello. This took the forms of robotic dancing, <b>jittery</b> high-pitched vocals and clothing fashions such as suits and big glasses that hid the body.|$|E

In the third season, he pledges allegiance to the Three Emperors of Yliaster, but later goes into hiding with his wife and son when he learns more about their plans. While generally composed, he gets rather <b>jittery</b> under pressure. He uses a 'Jester Deck', which focuses on sealing Synchro monsters. After his hideout is discovered by Team 5D's, he decides to cooperate with them. After Yliaster is defeated, Lazar becomes the first elected Mayor of New Domino City when a civilian government is established in the city, replacing the Public Security Maintenance Bureau.|$|E
25|$|Mochrie {{remained}} active elsewhere {{during his}} tenure as a Whose Line member. In early 1994, he {{played the role of}} Mike Brady in a musical version of The Brady Bunch, directed by fellow Second City member Bruce Pirrie. In the production, Mochrie plays the character as caffeine-fuelled, <b>jittery,</b> and neurotic, an exaggeration of the Mike Brady television character, who often had a coffee in his hand on the show. Shortly before his move to the US version of Whose Line in 1998, Mochrie starred in Supertown Challenge as the host of game shows, which the show spoofed. He also appeared in several episodes of the Canadian improvisational comedy series Improv Heaven and Hell.|$|E
25|$|The English {{reply was}} {{initially}} <b>jittery.</b> The pace of Brett Lee {{and accuracy of}} Glenn McGrath shook the English opening batsmen Marcus Trescothick and Andrew Strauss. Trescothick, for example, was caught off a no ball from Lee, but survived, as the openers lasted nearly 25 overs – before Strauss was caught behind off Brad Hogg for 41. By that time, however, the sun had come out, the ball didn't swing much in the air, and as Lee kept on bowling no balls – seven in total – things simply wouldn't work out for Australia. Trescothick used 132 balls to bring up his century, skipper Michael Vaughan made a healthy contribution with 59 not out, and England brought up the winning total with four overs to spare.|$|E

500|$|The {{apparent}} paradox (mentioned {{above in}} the properties subsection) {{of a point}} particle electron having intrinsic angular momentum and magnetic moment {{can be explained by}} the formation of virtual photons in the electric field generated by the electron. These photons cause the electron to shift about in a <b>jittery</b> fashion (known as zitterbewegung), which results in a net circular motion with precession. This motion produces both the spin and the magnetic moment of the electron. [...] In atoms, this creation of virtual photons explains the Lamb shift observed in spectral lines.|$|E
500|$|For the episode's {{time travel}} elements, sound effects editor Bruce Tanis {{explained}} his choices of sound {{during an interview}} with Designing Sound: [...] "I used vocals from the dialog to create high-pitched <b>jittery</b> tones that played against the visual of his time-jumping. He would start to flicker faster and faster as he ramped up to the moment of leaping so I wanted to play up the fragmented sense of time we had visually and create {{the idea that he}} was somehow jumping over other people to land at a different point in time. It also had electrical humming and zapping to support the electrical nature of the device".|$|E
500|$|The film's fast-paced montages and jump-cuts were novel {{features}} for an American movie at the time. Stephen Holden from The New York Times {{commented that the}} film's editing had [...] "a jazzy, improvisational quality, and the screen is often streaked with jarring psychedelic effects that illustrate Sweetback's alienation." [...] In The 50 Most Influential Black Films: A Celebration of African-American Talent, Determination, and Creativity, author S. Torriano Berry writes that the film's [...] "odd camera angles, superimpositions, reverse-key effects, box and matting effects, rack-focus shots, extreme zooms, stop-motion and step-printing, and an abundance of <b>jittery</b> handheld camera work all helped to express the paranoid nightmare that [...] life had become." ...|$|E

In {{the early morning hours of}} September 15, he went to London's Heathrow Airport with Douglas, who was returning to New York. Hendrix's confidante Sharon Lawrence was in London, and spoke with him that day. Lawrence commented: [...] "Jimi tracked me down, detailing his pressures and discussing the 'so-called friends'. He was <b>jittery</b> and angry." [...] According to Lawrence, Hendrix told her: [...] "I can't sleep. I can't focus to write any songs." [...] Later that afternoon, his girlfriend Monika Dannemann arrived at the Cumberland. She and Hendrix then drove to her apartment in the Samarkand Hotel, 22 Lansdowne Crescent, Notting Hill.|$|E
500|$|The Independents Andy Gill {{awarded a}} four-out-of-five star rating to Syro {{and called it}} [...] "a {{collection}} primarily concerned with the somatic rather than cerebral sides of Richard James' music, overdosing somewhat on staccato, bouncing synth twangs and <b>jittery</b> drum'n'bass beats." [...] "aisatsana [...] ", Syros closing track, drew comparisons to the works of French composer Erik Satie from both The Independent and Drowned in Sound, whose reviewer Tom Fenwick awarded the album a full 10-out-of-10 rating. Summarising the album, Fenwick said that [...] "Syro sees a master craftsman return with renewed inspiration. And while it might not technically be James' most innovative album, it way [...] well be his best … and once you let the hype drain away—what's revealed is pretty much flawless." ...|$|E
500|$|On [...] "New Day", they address future sons about fame. It {{references}} {{the line}} [...] "me and the RZA connect" [...] from Raekwon's 1995 song [...] "Incarcerated Scarfaces", {{which was also}} produced by RZA. The track incorporates a sample of Nina Simone's 1965 song [...] "Feeling Good" [...] through an Auto-Tune voice processor. Both rappers discuss their futures as fathers on the track, flowing smoothly over mellow, lightly psychedelic synthesizer tones. Both Justin Vernon and La Roux appear on [...] "That's My Bitch", spitting off hooks over a quick, melodic beat, with West at his most abrasive lyrically. On [...] "Welcome to the Jungle", Jay-Z laments personal losses and overcoming struggles. Sharing the name with a Guns N' Roses track, Jay describes himself as the [...] "black Axl Rose" [...] over a <b>jittery,</b> treble-heavy Swizz Beatz production.|$|E
500|$|Sam Wollaston, for The Guardian, favourably {{compared}} [...] "The Hounds of Baskerville" [...] to [...] "A Scandal in Belgravia", {{writing that}} the episode [...] "has a 21st-century pace to it, and fizzes with the wit we've {{come to expect}} from Sherlock ... the essence of The Hound of the Baskervilles ... like the original, it's properly creepy". The Radio Timess David Butcher compared the episode to Steven Moffat's series opener, [...] "A Scandal in Belgravia", saying this [...] "is more of a creepy affair, all <b>jittery</b> camerawork, paranoia and suspense." [...] Christopher Hootan of Metro thought the episode was [...] "the perfect marriage of misty, moor-based foreboding and modern, fast-paced thriller," [...] adding that [...] "with a breakneck script and captivating acting from Benedict Cumberbatch, Sherlock offers about the fastest {{hour and a half}} of television going at the moment." ...|$|E
500|$|Some {{equipment}} {{used to create}} the album remained the same as previous albums—Goddard used Steinberg Cubase SX3 on his laptop and Doyle and Martin worked on songs using Apple Logic in their studio. To create the chorus for [...] "Ready for the Floor", Goddard used plug-ins from Arturia, such as Moog Modular. He used two sound channels to control noise and melody, and placed the noise channel in Cubase and had it follow the melody, to make it [...] "punchier". With [...] "Bendable Poseable", Goddard recorded live percussion parts with a Shure Beta 57A mic going directly into Cubase and [...] "fashioned them into a <b>jittery,</b> three-minute loop". This was emailed to Taylor, who then recorded the main vocals for the song. To create the beat in [...] "Shake a Fist" [...] Martin used the Elektron Machinedrum.|$|E
500|$|The song has {{received}} positive reviews from most music critics. Robert Copsey of Digital Spy was positive, giving the song {{a rating of}} 5 out of 5 stars, praising the [...] "80s-styled funk beats and wildly infectious percussion", the [...] "singalong chorus may be a hasty reminder that his strength lies in fist-clenching". He also wrote that considered the song [...] "one {{of the most interesting}} musical evolutions of 2012." [...] Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone gave the song 3.5 out of 5 stars, writing that [...] "The song is about unbridled passion, but as usual with Mars, the aesthetic is tidy and impeccable, pop songcraft polished to a high-gloss gleam: <b>jittery</b> Police-esque rock-reggae verses that erupt, amid thunder-boom synths, into a steamrolling four-on-the-floor chorus." [...] Carl Williott of Idolator also gave the song a positive review, writing that it [...] "shows an interesting musical evolution," [...] and called the song [...] "interesting" [...] and marks it as a shift for Mars and his style.|$|E
500|$|After {{the song}} was made {{available}} online, Idolator website contributor Carl Williott compared it to her iTunes Festival performance and said, [...] "That rendition was particularly wild, and the studio version is even more schizophrenic and rave-ready." [...] Furthermore, he wrote of the song, [...] "It's a sonic onslaught of synth washes, a ground-churning bass line, <b>jittery</b> keyboards, hiccuping vocal samples and crescendos leading to drops in all the expected places. But amidst the EDM overload, Gaga manages to humanize things {{with one of her}} raspier, rawer vocal performances. And, for a dubstep song, it's got a remarkably huge 'Swiiine' refrain hidden in there." [...] Nicole James of Fuse deemed it [...] "basically the polar opposite of 'Applause'." [...] Kitty Empire of The Guardian praised the song as the album's [...] "wow-factor centrepiece, if not its greatest hit." [...] Mike Driver of Clash magazine found Gaga's vocal enunciations on the track comparable to those of singer Christina Aguilera. Maura Johnston of Spin magazine listed [...] "Swine" [...] as one of Artpops highlights, describing Gaga's belting of the lyrics and the sounds from the keyboards being reminiscent of Trent Reznor's songs.|$|E
500|$|... "XO" [...] is a midtempo pop, electropop and R love power ballad {{that bears}} {{resemblance}} to Beyoncé's own 2008 song [...] "Halo", {{which was also}} produced by Tedder. Influences of electronic rock and reggaeton genres were {{also found in the}} song. [...] "XO" [...] was composed using common time in the key of C major, with a tempo of 85beats per minute. It carries a [...] "celebratory, bumping Caribbean" [...] groove and a marching-drum beat with shuffling dancehall influences. The instrumentation includes <b>jittery</b> keyboards, synthesizers, percussion and electronic musical instruments. The song also consists of electronic flourishes and looped riff patterns brought about by an organ instrument. [...] "XO" [...] was also noted for being a departure from the minimalistic sexual nature of the album, due to its pure pop sound. Jordan Sargent of Complex magazine wrote that [...] "XO" [...] contains influences of Jamaican singer Tanya Stephens. Chris Bosman from Consequence of Sound described the song as a blend of [...] "cinematic reach of modern Top 40 pop with the patience and melancholy of post-808s & Heartbreaks [...] hip-hop." [...] Kevin Fallon from The Daily Beast compared the song's stadium sound to tracks by the band U2.|$|E
500|$|In 1984, Steiger starred as {{a detective}} {{assigned}} {{to investigate the}} murder of a Chicago psychoanalyst (Roger Moore), a man whom he detests from a previous case, in Bryan Forbes's The Naked Face. Richard Christiansen of the Chicago Tribune referred to it as a [...] "wimpy suspense movie shot in Chicago in the fall of 1983, [...] doesn't do much good for the city or for anyone connected with it", and considered Steiger to be [...] "acting in his high hysteria gear", who [...] "snarls and whines and overacts". Steiger took a break from cinema in the mid-1980s, during which he appeared in the Yorkshire Television mini-series The Glory Boys (1984) with Anthony Perkins, and Hollywood Wives (1985) with Angie Dickinson. Steiger and Perkins were at loggerheads during the production of The Glory Boys. Perkins resented the fact that Steiger insisted on a bigger trailer and felt that Steiger was trying to steal scenes from him, while Steiger had thought Perkins [...] "so <b>jittery</b> and jinxed by the chemicals he was taking" [...] that he felt sorry for him and believed that he was jeopardizing the success of the film. Steiger also performed on Joni Mitchell's 1985 album Dog Eat Dog, where he provided the voice of an evangelist in the song [...] "Tax Free".|$|E
500|$|... "Turns Me On" [...] has a comical {{beat and}} {{multiple}} vocals, including 1950s-styled vocals {{during a break}} in the song. [...] "Follow Us" [...] features fractured, Afrobeat guitar phrases, sleazy synthesizer, and a pop refrain by Vonnegutt. [...] "Shutterbugg" [...] has a robotic stutter, falsetto refrain, female whispers and described by The Guardians Hattie Collins as [...] "a futuristic, brain-crunching slice of <b>jittery</b> electro hop". [...] "Tangerine" [...] features blunt lyrics concerning strip club themes and a lascivious guest rap by T.I. The song incorporates various musical elements, including exotic Afro-polyrhythms, psychedelic instrumental effects, booming bass, tribal beats, synthesizer vamps, and slow, reverbing grunge rock guitar. Tom Breihan notes that the song [...] "somehow simultaneously sounds like strip-club ass-shake material and Funkadelic covering Morricone", while music journalist Alexis Petridis writes that it [...] "improbably burst into something that most closely resembles a P-Funk take on the mid-60s Batman theme. The lyrics, meanwhile, come in a breathless blur of druggy non-sequiturs and pop-culture references, some of it frankly baffling". [...] "Fo Yo Sorrows" [...] features funk musician George Clinton performing the hook and has been described as [...] "a seamless blur of old school Atlanta bass, current-day glitch-hop and Funkadelic-style psychedelia".|$|E
500|$|The American film {{reviewer}} Leonard Maltin {{has suggested}} that {{if it had been}} Connery in the leading role instead of Lazenby, On Her Majesty's Secret Service would have epitomised the series. On the other hand, Danny Peary wrote, [...] "I'm not sure I agree with those who insist that if Connery had played Bond it would definitely be the best of the entire Bond series... Connery's Bond, with his boundless humor and sense of fun and self-confidence, would be out of place in this picture. It actually works better with Lazenby because he is incapable of playing Bond as a bigger-than-life hero; for one thing he hasn't the looks... Lazenby's Bond also hasn't the assurance of Connery's Bond and that is appropriate in the crumbling, depressing world he finds himself. He seems vulnerable and <b>jittery</b> at times. At the skating rink, he is actually scared. We worry about him... On Her Majesty's Secret Service doesn't have Connery and it's impossible to ever fully adjust to Lazenby, but I think that it still might be the best Bond film, as many Bond cultists claim." [...] Peary also described On Her Majesty's Secret Service as [...] "the most serious", [...] "the most cynical" [...] and [...] "the most tragic" [...] of the Bond films.|$|E
500|$|The {{opening track}} [...] "The Message", {{featuring}} a male lead vocalist, parodies {{the words of}} the traditional song [...] "Dem Bones" [...] to link Google to [...] "the government". Kitty Empire wrote in The Observer that these conspiratorial government connections to Google and the thoughts of Dzhennet Abdurakhmanova, the Russian teenager who bombed Moscow's tube system in revenge for the death of her husband, were inner-world issues pondered in [...] "Lovalot" [...] with [...] "a mixture of nonsense rhyme, militant posturing and pop-cultural free-flow; her London glottal stop mischievously turns 'I love a lot' into 'I love Allah'". Ann Powers in the Los Angeles Times said that [...] "M.I.A. turns a call to action into a scared girl's nervous tic. Synths click out a <b>jittery,</b> jagged background. The song doesn't justify anything, but it reminds us that there is a person behind every lit fuse". Powers also commented on how [...] "Born Free" [...] mixed the boasting style often found in hip hop music with lines depicting the lives of those enduring poverty and persecution. [...] "Illygirl", a track found only on the deluxe edition of the album, is written {{from the point of view}} of an abused but tough teenager, whom critic Robert Christgau said could be the [...] "kid-sister-in-metaphor" [...] of the swaggering persona adopted by M.I.A. on the track [...] "Steppin Up".|$|E
500|$|Though {{nominally}} {{an independent}} country, Egypt had been effectively under British control {{since the late}} nineteenth century. With the outbreak of war, and {{under the terms of}} the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936, the country was under virtual occupation by the British. [...] At this stage in the war, the Germans were advancing apparently unstoppably across the desert towards Egypt, and Cairo was rife with rumours and alarms. Manning was <b>jittery</b> and fearful. She was constantly anxious about illness, and was indeed frequently unwell. Concerned, Reggie suggested that it might be best if she returned to England, but she retorted [...] "Wherever we go, we go together. If we return home, we both go. I won't have the war separating us. End of story." [...] Her father had made her a firm believer in the British Empire and the benefits it had brought the world, and Manning was a patriotic Briton, confident of ultimate Allied success. In Egypt, however, she confronted the fact that British occupation had never been popular. Reggie quickly discovered the Anglo-Egyptian Union in Zamalek, where he drank and talked politics and poetry. As usual he was well liked, and according to Lawrence Durrell often had a string of disreputable friends with him. Manning was much less popular. Durrell described her as a [...] "hook-nosed condor", whose critical manner was unappreciated by many who knew her.|$|E
500|$|Rooney Mara {{plays the}} role of Nancy Holbrook; Mara is also {{contracted}} for a sequel. Bayer describes Nancy as [...] "the loneliest girl in the world". Mara stated that her Nancy is different than the role of Nancy Thompson, performed by Heather Langenkamp, and described her character as [...] "socially awkward and timid and really doesn't know how to connect with people". Kyle Gallner was cast as Quentin, who forms a connection with Nancy. Gallner described his character as [...] "a mess, more <b>jittery</b> and more 'out there' than Nancy is". Gallner pointed out that his character is like this because of the amount of pharmaceuticals he ingests to stay awake. Producer Brad Fuller commented that Gallner brought a sense of [...] "humanity and relatability" [...] to the role with his compassion and intellect. Other cast members include Katie Cassidy, Thomas Dekker, and Kellan Lutz. Cassidy performed the role of Kris. According to Cassidy, Kris becomes an emotional wreck throughout the film. Cassidy described her character's ordeal: [...] "She is literally dragged through hell, having to crawl through dark, claustrophobic tunnels. She's always crying and freaking out as her nightmares of Freddy bleed into her everyday life. Kris suspects there's something that connects her with the others; she even confronts her mother about it, but no one's talking." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Don't Forget About Us" [...] {{garnered}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics, though many compared it to, and felt it shared several similarities with Carey's previous single, [...] "We Belong Together". Bill Lamb from About.com rated the song {{four out of}} five stars, who while noting the song's careful formula, complimented Carey's more mature and lower range vocals: [...] "Mariah is clearly settling into a more mature style and lower range vocals than in her early career." [...] Additionally, Lamb commented that although not as [...] "strong" [...] as [...] "We Belong Together", the song was marginally better than another single from The Emancipation of Mimi, [...] "Shake It Off". Billboards Michael Paoletta drew heavy comparisons to [...] "We Belong Together", noting the song's similar tempo, lyrical style, instrumentation and vocal stamp. He commented that although [...] "Don't Forget About Us" [...] was [...] "satisfying" [...] on its own, it suggested that Carey had hit a creative wall. Andre Meyer from CBC News described the song as [...] "stronger" [...] than anything Carey released from 2001–2005, and wrote [...] " [...] cops the <b>jittery</b> R vibe that made Destiny’s Child so potent." [...] Reviewers from The New Yorker and Music Week were both taken aback by the single, calling it [...] "beautiful" [...] and [...] "gentle", respectively. Todd Martens from the Los Angeles Times compared it heavily to Carey's 2008 single [...] "Bye Bye", describing their piano melody as [...] "a close match". In 2007, [...] "Don't Forget About Us" [...] was nominated for two Grammy Awards, in the [...] "Best Female R Vocal Performance" [...] and [...] "Best R Song" [...] categories, although not winning either.|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} general acclaim {{from music}} critics. Brittany Mahaney of ANDPOP praised the song's playful demeanor, and called [...] "Jumanji" [...] a summer anthem. Mahaney further elaborated that the song [...] "practically screams summer with dance worthy steel drums and timpani hits". On a similar note, Jason Lipshutz of Billboard also deemed the song an anthem. Lipshutz also compared Banks's {{performance in the}} song to the works of Cam'ron and early Ghostface Killah, claiming it was [...] "a great thing". Using a similar comparison, Jonah Weiner of Slate commented that the song [...] "channels the sort of hip-hop that dominated New York in the early- to mid-'00s—in particular, the triumphal cacophony and inspired gobbledygook of Cam'ron and his Harlem crew, the Diplomats". Weiner went on to commend the track's [...] "comically [...] " [...] percussion, but heavily praised the song's relaxed tempo, stating it [...] "better accommodates kingly rapping". Huw Nolan of Ripe lauded the song, calling it [...] "classic Azealia". Mark Richardson, writing for Pitchfork, gave the song the [...] "Best New Track" [...] honor, stating, [...] "her rapping really functions as the bedrock, the steady pulse for the production (by Hudson Mohawke and Nick Hook) to swirl around". Richardson used the aforementioned metaphor throughout his review, comparing the production on the song to Rustie's mix featured on BBC Radio 1's Essential Mix, before ending the review by saying, [...] "She [...] can rap." [...] Reviewing the song's parent mixtape for the same publication, Marc Hogan lauded the [...] " [...] rapidfire verses and an instantly quotable 'real bitch, all day/ Uptown, Broadway' hook over what sounds like elephants escaping from an urban zoo". Placing the song on Pretty Much Amazings [...] "Tracking 2012's Best Songs" [...] list, Genevieve Oliver opined the song exemplified [...] "Azealia's <b>jittery,</b> relentless, rapid-fire energy and smart, sarcastic lyrics" [...] aesthetic. Also writing for Pretty Much Amazing, Drewwmalmuth wrote {{a review of the}} track's parent mixtape, and praised [...] "Jumanji", [...] "Nathan", and [...] "Fuck Up the Fun" [...] for being [...] "commercially viable", but lamented that the tracks weren't [...] "aren't as gripping as the highest points of the tape".|$|E
