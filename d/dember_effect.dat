40|$|Exact {{solution}} of the linearized equations for steady-state transport in semiconductors yields two modes that vary exponentially in space, one involving screening (without entropy production) and one involving diffusion and recombination (with entropy production). Neither mode is quasineutral. For constant surface photoexcitation with generation of electrons and holes, the steady-state response is a linear combination of these modes, subject to global electroneutrality. The resultant charge separation produces a voltage difference across the sample (the <b>Dember</b> <b>effect)</b> ...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} {{generation}} of photo-induced electromotive force (EMF) {{on the surface of}} c-axis oriented InN epitaxial films grown on sapphire substrates. It has been found that under the illumination of above band gap light, EMFs of different magnitudes and polarities are developed on different parts of the surface of these layers. The effect {{is not the same as}} the surface photovoltaic or <b>Dember</b> potential <b>effects,</b> both of which result in the development of EMF across the layer thickness, not between different contacts on the surface. These layers are also found to show negative photoconductivity effect. Interplay between surface photo-EMF and negative photoconductivity result in a unique scenario, where the magnitude as well as the sign of the photo-induced change in conductivity become bias dependent. A theoretical model is developed, where both the effects are attributed to the 2 D electron gas (2 DEG) channel formed just below the film surface as a result of the transfer of electrons from certain donor-like-surfacestates, which are likely to be resulting due to the adsorption of certain groups/adatoms on the film surface. In the model, the photo-EMF effect is explained in terms of a spatially inhomogeneous distribution of these groups/adatoms over the surface resulting in a lateral non-uniformity in the depth distribution of the potential profile confining the 2 DEG. Existence of such an inhomogeneity in the distribution of surface potential has indeed been experimentally found for these layers...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The main {{objective}} of this thesis is to study unique cases for computer-assisted finite element modeling (FEM) of thermal, mechanical and thermo-mechanical problems related to silicon and carbon. Computational modeling contributed to solve scientific problems either by validating the experimental results obtained earlier or by predicting {{the behavior of a}} particular system. In the model generation phase, emphasis is placed on simplification of a physical problem without loosing the validity or important details. As a consequence of reasonably reduced variables and also degrees of freedom of the elements in our models, the simulations could be performed using a commercial FEM software package, ANSYS®. To test the capabilities of the method (i) a steady-state finite element thermal analysis has been accomplished and verified by experiments for the case of laser-assisted heating of different materials. (ii) Mechanisms (<b>Dember</b> and Seebeck <b>effects)</b> responsible for the reduction of gold ions and deposition of metallic gold on p-type semiconductors from liquid precursors have been investigated by computing the surface temperature profiles of silicon wafers exposed to laser irradiation. (iii) Temperature field in a multi-component system caused by laser illumination was modeled to determine the heat affected zone in the case of laser soldering of flip-chips on transparent printed circuit board assemblies. (iv) Origin of the experimentally observed residual strain in thermally oxidized porous silicon structures was revealed by computing the strain fields in silicon-silicon oxide porous materials considering both intrinsic and thermal stress components. (v) Finally, we demonstrated that Joule heat generated on a silicon chip can be removed efficiently using micro-fin structures made from aligned carbon nanotubes. Computational fluid dynamics and thermal-electric finite element models were developed to study the steady-state laminar coolant flow and also the temperature distribution for the chips. The presented novel results have potential in silicon and carbon nanotube based technologies, including deeper understanding of the processes and problems in manufacturing electronic devices...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{test for}} {{positive}} photo-electric emission from Au, Cu and Al. — Following the announcement by Dember in 1909 that positive emission had been observed, an {{attempt was made}} to verify its existence under improved conditions. His experiment was repeated using light from a quartz mercury arc and curves similar to his obtained. It was found, however, that when proper precautions against scattered light effects were taken, no true positive current could be detected from Au, Cu, or Al surfaces, and it is shown that the <b>Dember</b> <b>effect</b> may be accounted for on the basis of spurious currents due to scattered light. Outgassing of the surface failed to cause the appearance of any positive current...|$|E
40|$|An {{analytical}} model describing {{the effect of}} a magnetic field on the terahertz pulse generation from InAs surface excited by femtosecond-laser radiation has been proposed. It has been found that the efficiency of terahertz emission grows non-monotonically with increasing magnetic field and may be 5 - 6 times higher than the efficiency without a magnetic field. As seen from the calculations, photo-emf arises due to a spatial separation of electrons and holes, which are excited by laser pulses and ballistically move from the illuminated surface into the semiconductor bulk, considerably growing with an increase in the external magnetic field; in some hundreds of femtoseconds after the excitation, the photo-emf can reach the values far exceeding the typical ones for the <b>Dember</b> <b>effect...</b>|$|E
30|$|To {{explain the}} {{anomalous}} observation of photo-voltaic effect, we closely examine the giant photovoltaic (voltages many {{times larger than}} the potential drop across the energy gap) effects in thin semiconducting films. The early literature [23] indicates occurrence of this intriguing phenomenon in many materials, however the inconsistency in experimental results has contributed to the lack of understanding and technological relevance. Nevertheless, a consistent observation is that an electro-motive potential gradient (the end closer to the source shows negative polarity) is seen in semiconducting thin films when the insulating substrate is inclined with respect to the incident deposition flux. This is exactly same as our deposition configuration as shown in Figure  1 a. Interestingly, this specific condition is impossible to achieve in the conventional techniques (exfoliation, chemical vapour deposition). It is hypothesized that the oblique deposition creates nanoscale p-n junctions due to stacking fault, domain boundaries (Figure  1 b suggests turbostratic structure of the films) or the <b>Dember</b> <b>effect</b> [23].|$|E
30|$|To {{obtain the}} {{relative}} ratio of Rashba to Dresselhaus SOC, we measure the photocurrent induced by circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE) for different crystallographic directions, i.e., the CPGE current is collected along [110] and [100] direction through the contacts, respectively, with the incident plane of light {{perpendicular to the}} connection of the two contacts. For the CPGE measurement, a similar experimental setup with that used in the PISHE measurement is adopted except that the light irradiates obliquely on {{the midpoint of the}} connection of the two contacts along [110] or [100] directions, and the angle of incidence ranges from −[*] 40 to 40 °. The CPGE current at a certain angle of incidence is extracted by fitting the light-polarization-state dependent photocurrent J collected along the two contacts to the following equation [33]: J=JCPGE sin 2 φ+L 11 sin 4 φ+L 22 cos 4 φ+J 11. Here, JCPGE is the CPGE current, L 11 and L 22 are the photocurrent induced by linearly polarized light, and J 11 is the background current originating from the photovoltaic effect or <b>Dember</b> <b>effect</b> [33].|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{detailed}} discussion of extraordinary optoconductance (EOC). Experimental data was acquired via macroscopic metal-semiconductor hybrid structures composed of GaAs and In and subjected to illumination from an Ar ion laser. A drift diffusion model using the finite element method (FEM) provided a reasonable fit to the data. EOC is explored {{as a function of}} laser position, bias current, laser power density, and temperature. The positional dependence of the voltage is accounted for by the <b>Dember</b> <b>effect,</b> with the model incorporating the excess hole distribution based on the carrier mobility, and thus the mean free path. The bias current is found to produce a linear voltage offset and does not influence the EOC. A linear relationship is found between the laser power density and the voltage in the bare and hybrid devices. This dependence is reproduced in the model by a generation rate parameter which is related to the power density. Incorporating the mobility and diffusion temperature dependence, the model directly parallels the temperature dependence of the EOC without the use of fitting parameters.

40|$|Narrow Gap II-VI Compounds for Optoelectronic and Electromagnetic Applications, {{edited by}} Peter Capper Chapman and Hall, Electronic Materials Series, Volume 3, 1997, ISBN 0 - 412 - 71560 - 0, 561 Pages. Price £ 89. 00. (Reviewed in Journal of Infrared Physics and Technology 1998 pp. 487 - 488) Review This book, {{comprising}} twenty chapters by {{no less than}} thirty-two authors, is without a doubt {{one of the most}} comprehensive and authoritative texts available on the subject. The authors — and an even more extensive list of people acknowledged for acting as referees, are a role call of the best known names in the field. Problems often occur with books assembled in this way including uneven style, multiple coverage of the same material in several chapters, inconsistency of level and the like; whilst not entirely immune from these the editor has certainly done an excellent job of reducing them to an acceptable minimum, no mean feat with so many authors! Not surprisingly, the book is dominated by mercury cadmium telluride, MCT, with very limited sections on related zinc and selenium compounds, and on the dilute magnetic semiconductors based on HgMnTe,Se,S and HgFeTe,Se. As such of course it is of very direct interest to the readership of Infrared Physics and Technology through the importance of MCT to detectors, and more recently to lasers. The book is divided into three sections, starting with material growth. Reliable growth of bulk MCT crystals and epitaxial layers is of course the starting point of any useful device, and here the reader will find a comprehensive discussion of bulk crystal growth, and epitaxial growth by LPE, MOVPE and MBE. Here, as {{in the rest of the}} book, the referencing is comprehensive and up to date to at least 1995. MCT and the related compounds are particularly complex, and the next section of the book logically deals with material characterisation. In fact as well as the more obvious sections on optical and transport properties, doping, point defects, diffusion, surface properties, quantum wells and dilute magnetic semiconductors are covered here. In most cases the reader is given a brief insight into the relevant measurement methods, especially where they are specialised for use with these materials, but the focus is on presenting a wide range of data on the materials themselves. The section forms an invaluable reference for the established worker, and an excellent starting point for the newcomer to the field. Finally, and logically, the book covers applications in seven chapters. Considering their overwhelming importance it is surprising to see less than forty pages devoted to photovoltaic and photoconductive detectors, and perhaps a larger section on materials issues related to large array devices would have been welcome to many readers. The subjects of LEDs, lasers and non-equilibrium devices, now attracting interest not only as infrared detectors but for the strange property of 'negative luminescence' in which thermal emission is reduced are also discussed, as are photo detectors based on other effects such as the <b>Dember</b> <b>effect,</b> PEM and magnetoconcentration detectors. The final two chapters are perhaps the only ones of less interest to the readership of IPT, on solar cells and ionising radiation detectors in CdTe. The book presents numerous clear figures and illustrations, and large amounts of tabulated data, and overall can be highly recommended to anyone in, or entering this field of work. One query might be whether the reader needs both this volume and the closely related EMIS Volume 10, 'Narrow Gap Cadmium Based Compounds', by the same editor. This latter volume, whilst again heavily biased to MCT, does cover the other related materials more heavily. It is rather different in style, and concentrates strongly on presenting sources of numerical data as befits a volume in the 'Datareviews' series. If you are seriously involved in the field, you will want both, but as a starting point and to aid understanding, the subject of the present review is a better choice. <br/...|$|E
