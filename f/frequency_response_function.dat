40|$|A {{two-stage}} series-parallel {{vibration isolation}} system is already {{widely used in}} various industrial fields. However, when the researchers analyze the vibration characteristics of a mechanical system, the system is usually regarded as a single-stage one composed of two substructures. The dynamic modeling of a two-stage series-parallel vibration isolation system using <b>frequency</b> <b>response</b> function–based substructuring method has not been studied. Therefore, this article presents the source-path-receiver model and the substructure property identification model of such a system. These two models make up the transfer path model of the system. And the model is programmed by MATLAB. To verify the proposed transfer path model, a finite element model simulating a vehicle system, which is a typical two-stage series-parallel vibration isolation system, is developed. The substructure <b>frequency</b> <b>response</b> <b>functions</b> and system level <b>frequency</b> <b>response</b> <b>functions</b> {{can be obtained by}} MSC Patran/Nastran and LMS Virtual. lab based on the finite element model. Next, the system level <b>frequency</b> <b>response</b> <b>functions</b> are substituted into the transfer path model to predict the substructural <b>frequency</b> <b>response</b> <b>functions</b> and the system response of the coupled structure can then be further calculated. By comparing the predicted results and exact value, the model proves to be correct. Finally, the random noise is introduced into several relevant system level <b>frequency</b> <b>response</b> <b>functions</b> for error sensitivity analysis. The system level <b>frequency</b> <b>response</b> <b>functions</b> that are most sensitive to the random error are found. Since a two-stage series-parallel system has not been well studied, the proposed transfer path model improves the dynamic theory of the multi-stage vibration isolation system. Moreover, the validation process of the model here actually provides an example for acoustic and vibration transfer path analysis based on the proposed model.

50|$|Analysis {{methods were}} {{developed}} that predicted the required control systems needed to enable stable, efficient control {{of these systems}} (James, Nichols, & Phillips, 1947). Originally interested in temporal response - the relationship between sensed output and motor output {{as a function of}} time - James et al. (1947) discovered that the properties of such systems are best characterized by understanding temporal response after it had been transformed into a frequency response; a ratio of output to input amplitude and lag in response over the range of frequencies to which they are sensitive. For systems that respond linearly to these inputs, the <b>frequency</b> <b>response</b> <b>function</b> could be expressed in a mathematical expression called a transfer function. This was applied first to machine systems, then human-machine systems for maximizing human performance. Tustin (1947), concerned with the design of gun turrets for human control, was first to demonstrate that nonlinear human response could be approximated by a type of transfer function. McRuer and Krenzel (1957) synthesized all the work since Tustin (1947), measuring and documenting the characteristics of the human transfer function, and ushered in the era of manual control models of human performance. As electromechanical and hydraulic flight control systems were implemented into aircraft, automation and electronic artificial stability systems began to allow human pilots to control highly sensitive systems These same transfer functions are still used today in control engineering.|$|E
