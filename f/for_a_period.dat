25|$|As can be {{seen from}} the {{definitions}} above, if one already has price and quantity data (or, alternatively, price and expenditure data) for the base period, then calculating the Laspeyres index <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new <b>period</b> requires only new price data. In contrast, calculating many other indices (e.g., the Paasche index) <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new <b>period</b> requires both new price data and new quantity data (or, alternatively, both new price data and new expenditure data) for each new period. Collecting only new price data is often easier than collecting both new price data and new quantity data, so calculating the Laspeyres index <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new <b>period</b> tends to require less time and effort than calculating these other indices <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new <b>period.</b>|$|R
