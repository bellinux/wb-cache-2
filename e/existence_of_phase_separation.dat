40|$|The lateral {{organization}} of cellular membranes is {{formed by the}} clustering of specific lipids, such as cholesterol and sphingolipids, into highly condensed domains (termed lipid rafts). Hence such domains are distinct from the remaining membrane by their lipid structure (liquid-ordered vs. -disordered domains). Here, we directly visualize membrane lipid structure of living cells by using two-photon microscopy. In macrophages, liquid-ordered domains are particularly enriched on membrane protrusions (filopodia), adhesion points and cell-cell contacts and cover 10 - 15 % of the cell surface at 37 °C. By deconvoluting the images, we demonstrate the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> <b>phase</b> <b>separation</b> in vivo.

Under suitable conditions on this self- and crosswise attraction an interesting effect can be observed, namely phase separation into neighbouring regions, each of which contains {{only one of the}} species. We prove that the intersection of the support of the stationary solutions of the continuum model for the two species has zero Lebesgue measure, while the support of the sum of the two densities is simply connected. Preliminary results indicate the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> <b>phase</b> <b>separation,</b> i. e. spatial sorting of the different species. A detailed analysis in one spatial dimension follows.

The thermodynamics is developed using Debye-Huckel theory with ion-pairing and dipole-ion solvation, specific calculations being performed for 3 D lattices. As for continuum electrolytes, low-density results for sc, bcc and fcc lattices indicate the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> gas-liquid <b>phase</b> <b>separation.</b> The predicted critical densities have values {{comparable to those}} of continuum ionic systems, while the critical temperatures are 60 - 70 % higher. However, when the possibility of sublattice ordering as well as Debye screening is taken into account systematically, order-disorder transitions and a tricritical point are found on sc and bcc lattices, and gas-liquid coexistence is suppressed. Our results agree with recent Monte Carlo simulations of lattice electrolytes. Comment: 25 pages, 3 figures, ReVTeX 4, Submitted to J. Chem. Phy...|$|R
40|$|We use three {{different}} polymer solvent mixture models to theoretically determine the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> capillary-induced <b>phase</b> <b>separation</b> in simple pores under supercritical bulk conditions. These models undergo bulk demixing, due to quite different mechanisms, yet readily display supercritical transitions {{without the use}} of esoteric interactions in the capillary. The theoretical method used to analyze these systems is density functional theory. We find that capillary demixing is not reliant on the presence of a pure surface transition but may occur {{in the absence of the}} latter. This is shown by considering cases where the surface enhancement factor is too weak to cause demixing at a single surface or else the bulk conditions are supercritical to both bulk and surface transitions. This phenomenon may prove useful in applications involving adsorption from mixtures into porous particles...|$|R

40|$|Alkali-doped iron {{selenide}} is {{the latest}} member of high Tc superconductor family, and its peculiar characters have immediately attracted extensive attention. We prepared high-quality potassium-doped iron selenide (KxFe 2 -ySe 2) thin films by molecular beam epitaxy and unambiguously demonstrated the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> <b>phase</b> <b>separation,</b> which is currently under debate, in this material using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. The stoichiometric superconducting phase KFe 2 Se 2 contains no iron vacancies, while the insulating phase has a 5 × 5 vacancy order. The iron vacancies are shown always destructive to superconductivity in KFe 2 Se 2. Our study on the subgap bound states induced by the iron vacancies further reveals a magnetically-related bipartite order in the superconducting phase.

40|$|The {{temperature}} {{dependence of the}} formation of nano-scale indium clusters in InAlGaN quaternary alloys, which are grown by metalorganic chemical vapour deposition on GaN/Si(111) epilayers, is investigated. Firm evidence is provided to support the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> <b>phase</b> <b>separation,</b> or nano-scale In-rich clusters, by the combined results of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), high-resolution x-ray diffraction (HRXRD) and micro-Raman spectra. The results of HRXRD and Raman spectra indicate that the degree of phase separation is strong and the number of In clusters in the InAlGaN layers on silicon substrate is higher at lower growth temperatures than that at higher growth temperatures, which limits the In and Al incorporated into the InAlGaN quaternary alloys. The detailed mechanism of luminescence in this system is studied by low temperature photoluminescence (LT-PL). We conclude that the ultraviolet (UV) emission observed in the quaternary InAlGaN alloys arises from the matrix of a random alloy, and the second emission peak in the blue-green region results from the nano-scale indium clusters...|$|E
40|$|The {{morphological}} changes induced to {{segmented polyurethane}} elastomers by varying the NCO/OH ratio {{during the second}} step of polymerization, while keeping constant the total hard-segment content (similar to 30 %), were studied by means of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and the thermally stimulated depolarization current method (TSDC). The DSC results gave evidence for the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> <b>phase</b> <b>separation</b> in thermoplastic polyurethanes, whereas the elastomeric ones appeared to form a more homogeneous network. The FTIR results gave additional evidence regarding phase separation by detecting {{the strength of the}} hydrogen bonds. Moreover, an attempt was made to assess the relative contribution made to the hydrogen bonding in such systems by the two potential accepters: ester and urethane carbonyls. The TSDC results gave a relaxation mechanism that is due to interfacial (Maxwell-Wagner-Sillars) polarization, providing evidence of the existence of an interfacial phase. The introduced secondary chemical cross-links was found to affect mainly the irregularly packed hard domains and to form a more homogeneous network at higher values of the NCO/OH ratio.

Using core-level photoemission spectroscopy, we have studied the chemical potential shift (Delta mu) {{as a function of}} annealing temperature. The result shows that the chemical potential monotonously increases with electron doping in SrTiO 3 -delta. The monotonous increase of the chemical potential rules out the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> electronic <b>phase</b> <b>separation</b> in the sample.

40|$|AbstractThe {{interaction}} of trifluoperazine with the zwitterionic lipids dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine and dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine and with anionic dimyristoylphosphatidylglycerol was studied {{by means of}} microcalorimetry and fluorescence spectroscopy. Intercalation of drug molecules into the lipid bilayers was confirmed by the observed differential scanning calorimetry peak broadening and the decrease in chain-melting temperatures. For trifluoperazine:lipid mole ratios higher than 0. 4 and 0. 6 (for dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine and dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, respectively) the deconvolution of transition profiles into two Gaussian components was possible, which suggests phase separation in the studied mixtures. Deconvolution of the thermograms was not possible {{for any of the}} drug:dimyristoylphosphatidylglycerol mole ratios studied. To confirm the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> <b>phase</b> <b>separation</b> in trifluoperazine-phosphatidylcholine mixtures fluorescence spectroscopy experiments were performed using Laurdan as a probe. From the generalised polarisation versus excitation wavelength dependences, recorded at different temperatures, we conclude that a phase separation occurs in the gel state of the studied trifluoperazine-phosphatidylcholine mixtures. We attribute the existence of domains in the bilayer to the dissimilar interactions of two protonation forms of trifluoperazine with phosphatidylcholine molecules. Structural defects present at domain boundaries could be related to the trifluoperazine induced increase of membrane permeability and fluidity. This may partially explain the mechanism of multidrug resistance modulation by trifluoperazine...|$|E
40|$|Block {{copolymers}} {{have been}} recently recognised as advanced nanomaterials because their capability of self-assembling into various patterns: spheres, cylinders, lamellae, or bicontinuous double diamonds, {{depending on the}} volume fraction of the block components, the difference in their solubility parameters, sample preparation and thermal history [1 - 4]. These ordered nanomaterials exhibit a periodicity and, therefore, {{they can be used}} as templates for advanced practical applications. In general, upon heating, enthalpic repulsive interactions between constituent blocks are weakened, resulting in a transition from a phase-separated to a phase-mixed state on the so-called order-disorder transition, ODT. The synthesis by transition metal mediated living radical polymerisation has allowed obtaining different amphiphilic triblock copolymers of cyclohexyl methacrylate (CH) and di(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (DEG), using either CH or DEG as macroinitiators, i. e., as inner block. The studies of their aggregation characteristics by 1 H-NMR and dynamic and static light scattering have pointed out their ability to form micelles and solubilise organic solvent inside of them [5].

40|$|PURPOSE: To develop novel {{analytical}} {{approaches for}} identifying both miscibility and phase separation in hot-melt extruded formulations. METHODS: Felodipine-Eudragit E PO solid dispersions were prepared using hot-melt extrusion. The fresh and aged formulations were characterised using scanning electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, heat capacity (C(p)) measurements using modulated temperature DSC and {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} relaxometry. RESULTS: The solubility of the drug in polymer was predicted as being < or = 10 % w/w using a novel model proposed in this study. Freshly prepared HME formulations were found to show no evidence for phase separation despite drug loadings greatly in excess of this figure. Conventional DSC showed limitations in directly detecting phase separation. However, a novel use of C(p) measurements indicated that extensive phase separation into crystalline domains was present in all aged samples, a conclusion supported by SEM studies. The NMR relaxometry study confirmed the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> <b>phase</b> <b>separation</b> in all aged formulations and also allowed the estimation of separated domains sizes in different formulations. CONCLUSIONS: This study has presented a series of novel approaches for the identification, quantification and prediction of phase separation in HME formulations.

40|$|ABSTRACT We have {{recently}} proposed a phase diagram for mixtures of porcine brain sphingomyelin (BSM), cholesterol (Chol), and 1 -palmitoyl- 2 -oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (POPC) {{on the basis}} of kinetics of carboxyfluorescein efflux induced by the amphipathic peptide d-lysin. Although that study indicated the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> domains, <b>phase</b> <b>separations</b> in the micrometer scale have not been observed by fluorescence microscopy in BSM/Chol/POPC mixtures, though they have for some other sphingomyelins (SM). Here we examine the same BSM/Chol/POPC system by a combination of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and Monte Carlo simulations. The results clearly demonstrate that domains are formed in this system. Comparison of the FRET experimental data with the computer simulations allows the estimate of lipid-lipid interaction Gibbs energies between SM/Chol, SM/ POPC, and Chol/POPC. The latter two interactions are weakly repulsive, but the interaction between SM and Chol is favorable. Furthermore, those three unlike lipid interaction parameters between the three possible lipid pairs are sufficient for the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> a closed loop in the ternary phase diagram, without the need to involve multibody interactions. The calculations also indicate that the largest POPC domains contain several thousand lipids, corresponding to linear sizes of the order of a few hundred nanometers...|$|R

For both Y 0. 63 Ca 0. 37 TiO 3 and Y 0. 61 Ca 0. 39 TiO 3 compositions, the orthorhombic (Pbnm) - monoclinic (P 21 /n) structural phase transition occurs at around 230 K, which is much higher than their own M-I transition temperatures, i. e. 60 K and 130 K, respectively.

40|$|We present {{evidence}} for the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> <b>phase</b> <b>separation</b> in the gel state of agarose having the mixture of water and methanol as the gel solvent. Firstly, the sol-gel transition line and the cloud point line are determined independently {{as a function of}} the concentration of agarose as well as the concentration of methanol in the mixed solvent by the quasi-equilibrium cooling of the solutions. Then the spinodal line is determined by quenching the solutions below the sol-gel transition line. We find that the spinodal line appears below the cloud point line and both lines are entirely buried below the sol-gel transition line in the aqueous agarose system. The concentration fluctuations are, therefore, frozen into the polymer network of agarose gel that promotes the opacity of the resultant gel. The structure of agarose gel is observed by the confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) imaging technique that reveals that the density fluctuations are grown up to micrometer scale in space. The phase separation boundary is found to shift to the higher temperature region than the sol-gel transition line when the concentration of methanol in the mixed solvent is increased. The results indicate that the position of the phase separation boundary in relative to the sol-gel transition line varies with the quality of solvent. These results are in agreement with the theory of the sol-gel transition in which both the divergence of the connectivity and the thermodynamic instability are taken into account...|$|E

The separation of milk into liquid whey and solid curd is a very common example <b>of</b> <b>phase</b> <b>separation</b> observed in daily life. The phenomenon finds its application in various fields of science and technology, ranging from metals, semiconductors, superconductors to simple and complex fluids such as polymers, surfactants, colloids, emulsions and biological materials. The principles driving the phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>phase</b> <b>separation</b> are very fundamental in nature, i. e. interaction difference between like and unlike molecules, making it an interesting problem to study.
