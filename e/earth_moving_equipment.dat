5|$|Crusader (AV2767) was an Australian Army amphibious {{operations}} support ship of World War II. She was launched {{shortly before the}} war ended and entered service in late 1945. From 1945 to 1947 she was mainly used to return Australian Army equipment from the islands off New Guinea. She was also loaned to the Australian Shipping Board in early 1947 and transported <b>earth</b> <b>moving</b> <b>equipment</b> and timber between Melbourne and Tasmania. However, the Army did not need a ship with Crusaders capabilities after the war, and she was sold in 1947 to the Queensland Cement and Lime Company which operated her as a coral barge on the Brisbane River until the mid-1980s. The ship was scuttled in 1986 and subsequently became a popular dive wreck.|$|E
5|$|By January 1947 the Army {{no longer}} needed a ship with Crusaders capabilities, and she was loaned to the Australian Shipping Board. In February that year she transported a load of <b>earth</b> <b>moving</b> <b>equipment</b> from Melbourne to Launceston, and carried a cargo of timber back to Melbourne. She {{continued}} to be manned by an Army crew and made several further trips between Tasmania and the mainland, but in April 1947 {{it was reported that}} the ship was to be scrapped on the grounds that she was considered unseaworthy. Gil Duthie, the Federal member for Wilmot, sought to have Crusader retained in service until the shortage of shipping capable of transporting heavy loads to and from Tasmania was rectified. The Shipping Control Board rejected Duthrie's representations on the grounds that Crusader would need extensive alterations before she could be permanently used for commercial trade, and it would take at least a year to complete the necessary works. However, the Board gave a commitment to make other ships available to transport timber from Tasmania. Crusader was subsequently offered for sale, and was purchased by the Queensland Cement and Lime Company (QCL). She arrived at Brisbane on 28 September 1947 and was subsequently renamed Cementco.|$|E
25|$|The {{rescue effort}} was {{hampered}} by the weather, terrain, and other problems. Emergency vehicles could not approach due to a fuel pipeline destroyed by the crash and blocking the narrow road. United States Navy Seabees of NMCB133 {{were some of the}} first on the scene as they utilized their <b>earth</b> <b>moving</b> <b>equipment</b> to clear roadways and timber from the crash site approach. The Seabees used backhoes to crack open the still-burning plane to rescue survivors and erected mortuary tents for first responders. There was confusion over the administration of the effort; the crash occurred on land owned by the United States Navy but civil authorities initially claimed authority. The hull had disintegrated, and jet fuel in the wing tanks had sparked a fire which was still burning eight hours after impact.|$|E

2500|$|The Insolvency Act 1986 section 238 only catches {{depletion}} of a company's total assets, {{rather than simply}} preferring one creditor {{at the expense of}} others. To deal with this issue, section 239 allow avoidance preferences that entail a [...] "desire to prefer" [...] one creditor over another. This test is hard to fulfill. In Re MC Bacon Ltd, a company gave a floating charge to Natwest bank in return for a continued overdraft as its business declined. Millett J held the company had not desired to prefer the bank. It had no special affection for its bank, and only agreed to the charge to prolong survival of the business. By contrast, in Re Agriplant Services Ltd Jonathan Parker J held it was an unlawful preference for Agriplant Services Ltd to pay £20,000 due on a leasing contract for <b>earth</b> <b>moving</b> <b>equipment</b> to a company. This was mainly because Agriplant's major shareholder Mr Sagar, had guaranteed that Agriplant's liability, and so repayment absolved Mr Sagar's liabilities above other creditors. Similarly in Re Conegrade Ltd, the Lloyd J held that when two directors of a small engineering company caused the company to sell them a property for £125,000, to then be leased back to Conegrade Ltd, the dominant purpose must have been to give them as creditors a preference over others. Thus, it was void.|$|E

A human operator can be replaced or augmented with a robotic system when the job is too dull, dirty or dangerous. There are a myriad of applications in both Government and Industry that could benefit from augmenting or replacing an operator of hydraulic equipment with an intelligent robotic system A specific important situation is the removal of unexploded ordnance (UXO). The removal of UXO is a troubling environmental problem that plagues people around the world. This document addresses the danger that UXO pose to military groups in applications such as active range clearance and disposal of unexploded or dud munitions. Disposing of these munitions is a difficult problem, which first begins by determining their location. The process can be aided {{through the use of}} teleoperated hydraulic equipment, which allows the operator to be located at a safe distance from these munitions. In the past, converting a large piece of hydraulic construction equipment for teleoperated use has been an expensive task. An important result of this research is demonstrating that through readily available commercial products and existing design methodologies, such robotic tasks can be accomplished at relatively low cost and in a timely, reliable fashion...|$|R

40|$|Surface mining will {{continue}} to play major role in meeting the demand of fossil fuel. India’s power generation will be about 1, 65, 000 MW this 11 th five year plan out of which the share of coal would be 75 %. Majority of the coal demand is met from surface mining due to its speed and ease of operations. The current coal production from surface mines in India is about 390 MT (85 %) {{that will have to}} be increased substantially to meet the demand. Opencast mine economy depends on the cost of haul road design, construction and its maintenance in addition to other factors. These roads are used by heavy <b>earth</b> <b>moving</b> <b>equipments.</b> With a poorly laid, constructed and maintained haul road, production suffers, accident and breakdown occurs. The haul road has received inadequate attention although production, usage of heavy machineries have increased manifold. The surface of the haul road depends on the behaviour of material beneath it. Strengthening of the base and subbase layers beneath the surface of the surface coal mine haul road are of vital importance to improve upon its performance. The materials that are used in haul road construction, typically sourced locally. It is envisioned that suitable material would address this issue. Solid wastes from the surface mining as well as combustion of coal pose serious environmental problems of vital concern to the producers and users of coal as well as the general public. Opencast mining involves displacement of large amount of overburden dumps materials as mine waste to excavate coal from the earth. The overburden dumps formed outside the open pits not only occupy huge land area but also alter the surface topography and contribute to the environmental degradation. Fly ash is at present an unavoidable coal combustion byproduct. The major challenge with this production of the fly ash is in its huge land coverage, adverse impact on environment, etc. The problem with safe disposal of fly ash is a major issue as India is poised to generate huge volume of fly ash due to the high ash (40 % to 50 %) content of the coal. In most of the surface mines, the material used in the haul road is not adequate to support the wheel loads. Fly ash posses many attributes to be used as an engineering material in those sections/layers. The prospects of utilizing fly ash that would have been dumped as waste is explored, investigated, experimented and evaluated in the investigation. Different compositions of fly ash, mine overburden and lime have been prepared. The geotechnical properties such as compaction characteristics, California bearing ratio, unconfined compressive strength, Brazilian tensile strength, ultrasonic pulse velocity, morphology, phase characteristics, chemical compositions and leaching behaviour have been determined. The effects of lime content and curing period on the geotechnical characteristics of the fly ash composites are highlighted. Numerical investigation have been carried out to evaluate the behaviour of fly ash composite materials in reducing strain in the haul road of surface coal mine. There were significant improvements in the stress-strain behaviour of developed composites. All the composites resulted in enough strength values to be used as subbase material. Curing periods and lime content have varying influence in the strength development of the composites. The composites with 30 % fly ash and 9 % lime gave the best performance in reducing the stress-strain values at different section of haul road pavement. There were no traces of toxic elements in the developed composites...|$|R
