500|$|A formal United States Navy {{board of}} inquiry, {{known as the}} Hepburn Investigation, {{prepared}} {{a report of the}} battle. The board interviewed most of the major Allied officers involved over several months, beginning in December 1942. [...] The report recommended official censure for only one officer, Captain Howard D. Bode of the Chicago, for failing to broadcast a warning to the fleet of encroaching enemy ships. The report stopped short of recommending formal action against other Allied officers, including Admirals Fletcher, Turner, McCain, and Crutchley, and Captain Riefkohl. Vice Admiral Ghormley was relieved not long afterward. [...] Vice Admiral Fletcher and Rear Admiral Noyes were relieved of their commands. The careers of Turner, Crutchley, and McCain do not appear to have been affected by the defeat or the mistakes they made in contributing to it. Riefkohl, however, never commanded ships again. Captain Bode, upon learning that the report was going to be especially critical of his actions, shot himself in his quarters at Balboa, Panama Canal Zone, on April 19, 1943, and died the next day. Crutchley was gazetted with the Legion of Merit (Chief Commander) in September 1944. Admiral Yamamoto signaled a congratulatory note to Mikawa on his victory, stating, [...] "Appreciate the courageous and hard fighting of every man of your organization. I expect you to <b>expand</b> <b>your</b> exploits and you will make every effort to support the land forces of the Imperial army which are now engaged in a desperate struggle." [...] Later on, though, when it became apparent that Mikawa had missed an opportunity to destroy the Allied transports, he was intensely criticised by his comrades.
