In the area there are two characteristic assemblages: one is the Form B type assemblage represented by Form B, and occurs in the Shiiya and the Hamatsuda formations, and other is the Tj type assemblage characterized by Thecosphera japonica together with the species such as Thecosphaera tochigiensis T. akitaensis, Stylatractus yatsuoensis, Spongurus inouei, Spireuma? circularis etc., and {{is found in the}} Nishiyama formation. The analysis of the composition and relative stratigraphic occurrences of these assemblages in the "Chuo-Yutai" as in the Nishiyama Oil Field has been carried out by the writers, after a total of 275 samples collected from ten sections was under examination. The assemblages in the sections of this area may be almost completely summarized as Form B and Tj types in ascending sequence. However, there are differences between the Nishiyama Oil Field and the "Chuo-Yutai" in the occurrences of these asssemblages. The stratigraphic occurrences of the Tj type assemblage are completely limited to the Nishiyama formation in the Nishiyama Oil Field, while the Tj type is found in the Hamatsuda or in {{the upper part of the}} Shiiya formations. Also, there are few differences, as shown in table 12 among ten sections of this area. In as much as radiolarians are marine planktonic forms, they are useful as <b>horizon</b> <b>indicators.</b> Then, it may reasonably be concluded that the boundary of faunal change between the Form B and the Tj types corresponds to the boundary between the Hamatsuda and the Nishiyama formations.

In this framework, strategic portfolio choice has become very complex, because of the growing number of uncertain parameters involved, such as energy market prices, water inflow, and demand. The lack of information and the absence of the decision maker’s perception are just some of the many elements that must be accounted for. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to propose a methodology based on strategic choices that will enable decision makers to evaluate the performance of both their strategies and portfolios, through the computation of an indicator for different time <b>horizons.</b> This <b>indicator</b> is used to evaluate and select portfolios of customers. With the use of fuzzy numbers theory, this methodology will enable decision makers to incorporate and express uncertainty, in a non probabilistic sense.

40|$|AbstractThe main {{argument}} {{of this paper}} is that the natural balance of Algiers’ Bay is endangered by the massive introduction of large high-density urban projects. Despite the fact that the phenomenon of the urbanization concerns most of the Mediterranean coastal areas and cannot be avoided, the research presented in this paper illustrates the negative impacts of these urban developments and argues for the preservation of the natural features of waterfronts. It starts by the identification of the physical characteristics of the Bay and highlights the vulnerability of this entity as an ecosystem particularly fragile. On the second step, the new urban development scheme proposed {{for the development of the}} Algerian coast will be confronted with the realities of its implementation on the bay. In effect, Algiers coastal zones, and particularly Algiers bay, are at a crucial stage, which requires harmonization of the imperatives of economic development and environmental protection. Some results of researches related to the sustainability of these coastal areas with different trend scenarios will be presented.

The scientific mission of ALEXIS requires 2 ̆ 2 {{after the fact}} 2 ̆ 2 knowledge of the spacecraft attitude at all times. Reconstitution of the attitude is performed {{as one of the}} permanent tasks of the microcomputer based ground station. ALEXIS carries a fine sun-sensor, an Infrared <b>horizon</b> crossing <b>indicator</b> and a magnetometer. Because of the orbital and attitude configurations horizon and sun will not be observed during sizable fractions of some orbits. The attitude will be estimated at all times by an extended fitter making use of whatever data is available. The state vector includes disturbance and misalignment terms. Fiber initialization uses the first available set of valid data from sun sensor and magnetometer, for a deterministic fix insuring rapid convergence. Magnetic field measurements provide a ceiling to the possible errors when the optical sensors are not operating, and can be used as back up. Detailed simulations of the filter were run to assess its performance. The simulations include major disturbance torques, misalignments, and earth oblateness effects. They show that the filter maintains knowledge of the attitude well within the mission data requirements. As a result, with a minimal amount of low cost instrumentation, without a star tracker on board, ALEXIS attitude and rates can be reconstituted for all times from a simple microcomputer based ground station.

40|$|Rich non-arbitrary topological {{change may}} {{occur in a}} {{relativistic}} vacuum space-time that violates chronology at every point. However, each closed timelike curve (CTC) is typically "censored" by passing through a wormhole's event horizon, and a Cauchy-like surface may exist through which all timelike curves pass once and only once before crossing an event horizon. All CTCs in a time-orientable space-time must pass through a wormhole; otherwise the CTC could be deformed as a CTC to a non-time-orientable point. Therefore, if all wormholes have event horizons, there is chronology protection against uncensored CTCs, and the universe is safe for those historians who cannot see through event <b>horizons.</b> An <b>indicator</b> of a space-time's completeness which is conformally invariant, unlike geodesic or b-completeness, is that no causal boundary exists, which implies that the entire space-time is a chronology violating set. Such "causally complete" space-times fail to satisfy assumptions of the topological censorship theorem and {{a wide range of}} singularity theorems; causal completeness implies geodesic and b-completeness. If a wormhole's two mouths are nearby, its event horizon as a one-way membrane causes the wormhole to propagate, mimicking the behavior of a photon. If the two mouths are not nearby, they mimic the behavior of a fermion and its anti-particle. Energy-momentum conservation implies that these pseudo-photons can be created or destroyed only in multiples of 2 (similar to results of Gibbons and Hawking), and that their destruction creates gravitational waves.

40|$|The Student Nitric Oxide Explorer (SNOE) {{is a small}} {{scientific}} spacecraft {{designed for}} launch on a Pegasus™ XL launch vehicle for the USRA Student Explorer Demonstration Initiative. Its scientific goals are to measure nitric oxide density in the lower thermosphere and analyze the energy inputs to that region {{from the sun and}} magnetosphere that create it and cause its abundance to vary dramatically. These inputs are energetic solar photons in the EUV and X -ray spectral regions, and energetic electrons that are accelerated into the polar regions, where they cause auroral disturbances and displays. Both of these phenomena are aspects of solar variability; thermospheric nitric oxide responds to that variability and in turn determines key temperature and compositional aspects of the thermosphere and ionosphere through its radiative and chemical properties. The SNOE (2 ̆ 2 snowy 2 ̆ 2) spacecraft and its instrument complement is being designed, built, and operated entirely at the University of Colorado, Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (CU/LASP). The spacecraft is a compact hexagonal structure, 372 ̆ 2 high and 392 ̆ 2 across its widest dimension, weighing approximately 220 Ibs. It will be launched into a circular orbit, 550 ± 50 km altitude, at 97. 5 ° inclination for sun-synchronous precession at 10 : 30 - 22 : 30 solar time. It will spin at 5 rpm with the spin axis normal to the orbit plane. It carries three instruments: An ultraviolet spectrometer to measure nitric oxide altitude profiles, a two-channel ultraviolet photometer to measure auroral emissions beneath the spacecraft, and a five-channel solar soft X-ray photometer. The spacecraft structure is aluminum, with a center platform section for the instruments and primary components and truss work to hold the solar arrays. Power is regulated using switched arrays and a partial shunt.

Different opinions considering the age of this ore occurrences {{exist in the literature}} of Montenegro: Upper Paleozoic or Middle Triassic. This study has revealed that most of this ore occurrences are of Permian age.

This study will fill that gap by demonstrating the feasibility of a 20 kg microsatellite for dual Martian missions allowing new and never before possible scientific observations. Hereby the microsatellite does not weigh more than a variety of scientific instruments on interplanetary spacecrafts. The study provides a mission profile including the selection of a suitable orbit based on scientific and communication analyses and an operation concept throughout mission lifetime. In this context an important trade-off is performed between communication demands and scientific objectives each requiring contradictory orbit properties. Recent transceiver developments for Martian relay orbiters and rovers made this trade-off possible. However, the main focus of this study is on the attitude determination and control system (ADCS). The stringent mass budget and the lack of an intrinsic magnetic field on Mars make the design of this subsystem particularly challenging because microsatellites on earth missions usually implement a magnetic control to comply with the mass limitations. Therefore different principles and new technology developments are researched, analyzed and evaluated. Finally a baseline attitude determination and control system is derived from worst case analyses. The attitude determination system is based on a 2 -axis sun sensor, 3 -axis rate sensor – both engineered with MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical System) technology – and a miniaturized <b>horizon</b> crossing <b>indicator</b> providing attitude accuracies < 1. 5 °. whereas the attitude control will be performed via a mems-engineered cold gas micropropulsion system - dry mass 2 kg – enabling theoretical maneuver accuracies in the order of 1 e- 03 degrees. moreover a general system design sufficient enough to provide a realistic three dimensional model of the microsatellite in terms of mass and geometry is developed. such a model enables realistic and convincing analysis of the adcs. in this sense all subsystems were dimensioned based on available hardware or new technology developments on-going to determine power, mass and volume characteristics. the final satellite design shows to be suitable for a variety of mars missions even extending the current profile in terms of mission lifetimes longer than one martian year or possible formation flight demonstrations at mars in preparation for human spaceflight. the in this study characterized spacecraft configuration and dynamics model for attitude simulations provide a solid basis for further analysis and next phase studies for martian microsatellites.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to shed some light on what fiscal {{sustainability}} actually means. In doing so, it looks in the literature for a definition of fiscal sustainability that not only is theoretically sound, but can also be used for setting fiscal targets in practice. Sustainability is defined in a rather standard way - fiscal policy is said to be sustainable if the present value of future primary surpluses equals the current level of debt. This definition enables various sustainability indicators to be constructed. A good indicator of fiscal sustainability should signal, with a sufficient lead, excessive debt accumulation. The paper introduces several sustainability indicators varying in how closely they are related to the sustainability definition (the infinite and finite horizon gaps), whether they take account of the future evolution of spending (the primary gap and the tax gap) and what target value of debt is set at the end of a finite <b>horizon.</b> While the <b>indicators</b> can be used for different time horizons - from one year to an infinite horizon, the paper is by and large focused on long-term sustainability. When combined with long-term projections the indicators gauge the resilience of public finances to population ageing. The indicators are used to assess the sustainability of Czech fiscal policy. The sustainable revenue ratio, enabling the future surge in age-related spending to be financed, is estimated at 48 % of GDP in the Czech Republic. It is some 7 percentage points higher than the current revenue-to-GDP ratio. The sustainable primary balance stands at 0. 4 % of GDP. By observing this primary surplus, governments would stabilise the debt ratio in the long run. However, compliance with this target would require immediately raising taxes or cutting spending by almost 3. 0 % of GDP and containing any future spending pressures (projected at 7. 3 % of GDP) either by systemic reforms preventing age-related spending from rising or by annual discretionary spending cuts and tax increases [...] Fiscal sustainability, population ageing, primary gap, sustainability indicators, tax gap. ...|$|R
