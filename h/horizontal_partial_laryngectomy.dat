40|$|International audienceThe {{goal of this}} {{longitudinal}} study in substitution voice after vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>partial</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> was i) to analyse perceptual and acoustic characteristics related to specific surgery, ii) to determine relevant acoustic measurements to classify voice quality. 30 male patients were recorded at 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery and 15 male controls. Two perceptual scales (GRB & IINFVo) were compared for relevance mean. Vowel [a, e, i, o, u] identification test was compared to acoustic analysis of the vocalic triangle {{to better understand the}} confusions. Long Term Average Spectrum (LTAS) could measure energy distribution in noisy voices. The first six months can be considered as an adaptation period for voicing features and improvement of breathy voice quality. Overlapping formant frequencies could explain the vocalic perceptual confusions. Voice and speech are better preserved with at least one vocal fold and the remaining of 2 arytenoids for neoglottic closure efficiency...|$|E
40|$|SummaryThe gold {{standard}} {{for the management of}} laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma in a previously irradiated patient is “salvage” total laryngectomy, but surgical management by <b>partial</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> can sometimes be proposed in selected patients. ObjectivesThis study was designed to review the functional and oncological outcomes of patients treated by open <b>partial</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> for recurrent squamous cell carcinoma after failure of radiotherapy or involving previously irradiated tissues and to define prognostic criteria for the selection of patients eligible for this treatment strategy. Materials and methodsIn this retrospective study, 20 patients underwent <b>partial</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> between 2000 and 2011 for recurrence or second primary stage I or II laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma in an irradiated territory (11 vertical <b>partial</b> laryngectomies; 9 <b>horizontal</b> <b>partial</b> <b>laryngectomies).</b> ResultsThe 3 -year overall survival rate in patients with negative resection margins was 66 %, with higher survival rates for tumours confined to the glottis, and the 2 -year local control rate was 67 %. Positive resection margins requiring total laryngectomy were observed in 20 % of cases. The 3 -year overall survival rate was 56 % in these patients. Exclusive oral feeding was restored in 75 % of patients after an average of 32 days. The tracheotomy tube was removed after an average of 18 days in 90 % of patients. The disease-free functional larynx preservation rate was 45 %.

40|$|AbstractPartial {{laryngectomy}} {{is used in}} {{the treatment}} of laryngeal cancer. Structural alterations of the upper airway arising from <b>partial</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> can cause obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). ObjectiveTo compare the prevalence and severity of OSA in patients submitted to <b>horizontal</b> and vertical <b>partial</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> and assess the role of spirometry for these patients. MethodCross-sectional clinical study with individuals offered <b>partial</b> <b>laryngectomy.</b> The included patients were assessed through interview, upper airway endoscopy, polysomnography, and spirometry. ResultsFourteen patients were evaluated and 92. 3 % were found to have OSA. The apnea-hypopnea index was significantly higher among patients submitted to vertical laryngectomy (mean = 36. 9) when compared to subjects offered horizontal laryngectomy (mean = 11. 2). The mean minimum oxyhemoglobin saturation was 85. 9 in the horizontal laryngectomy group and 84. 3 in the vertical laryngectomy group. Spirometry identified extrathoracic upper airway obstruction in all patients with OSA. ConclusionThe studied population had a high incidence of obstructive sleep apnea. OSA was more severe in patients offered vertical laryngectomy than in the individuals submitted to horizontal laryngectomy. Spirometry seems to be useful in the detection of cases of suspected OSA, as it suggests the presence of extrathoracic upper airway obstruction...|$|R

A total of 41 patients from the group had 63 neck dissections (NDs); 22 had bilateral and 19 unilateral dissections. A correlation of the pN with N staging revealed that when presenting with N 2 a nodes (> 3 cm), one third had contralateral metastases, and with N 2 b (multiple), 100 % had contralateral metastases. In multivariate analysis of the disease-free interval, age and staging emerged as independent prognostic variables.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this review was to study the results of <b>horizontal</b> <b>partial</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> (HPL) for supraglottic {{laryngeal}} cancer (stages N 0 and N+) and the effects and morbidity of postoperative radiation therapy (RT), especially after bilateral neck dissection, as opposed to primary RT. Of a total of 89 patients, 26 were treated by HPL, 44 by primary RT, and 19 by total laryngectomy (TL). Of the HPL patients, 19 of 26 had neck dissection, 10 were bilateral. Twelve of the patients received postoperative RT, and 10 of 12 procedures were combined with neck dissection. When comparing the results of HPL and primary RT, the locoregional control was equivalent for the N 0 patients, but HPL showed better results in locoregional control for the N+ patients (P <. 0024). Postoperative RT with or without bilateral neck dissection did not show an increase in postoperative morbidity.

Risk factors believed {{to play a role in}} the pathogenesis of tracheocutaneous fistula were examined including advanced age, cardiopathy, local infections, radiotherapy, elevated body mass index, malnutrition, decannulation time and aspiration grade. The Leipzig and Pearson scale score was significantly higher in the supracricoid <b>partial</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> group (p = 0. 006 and 0. 031 for univariate and multivariate analyses, respectively).

40|$|Objective: The {{therapeutic}} effect of middle frontal <b>horizontal</b> <b>partial</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> (MFHPL) in treating stage T 1 b {{squamous cell carcinoma}} of the glottic larynx involving anterior vocal commissure (AVC) was {{compared with that of}} the anterior frontolateral vertical partial laryngectomy (AFVPL). The feasibility and practical significance of MFHPL in clinical application was discussed in the present study. Methods: From January 1996 to January 2010, a total of 65 patients diagnosed with stage T 1 bN 0 M 0 glottic laryngeal cancer were treated with MFHPL or AFVPL. The postoperative complications, glottic reconstruction, recurrence rate, voice quality and survival rates were evaluated and compared between two treatments. Results: AFVPL and MFHPL were performed in 34 and 31 patients, respectively. Flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy revealed that in the MFHPL-treated patients the reconstructed glottis was spacious and symmetric. In contrast, AFVPL treatment resulted in irregular glottic area with poor symmetry and tubular glottis. The incidence of postoperative laryngeal stenosis significantly differed between the MFHPL- and AFVPL-treated groups (P = 0. 025). No significant difference was detected in the 3 - and 5 -year overall- or tumor-free survival rates between two treatments. The Voice Handicap Index (VHI) and maximum phonation time (MPT) after surgery were 51. 0612. 99 and 12. 4263. 44 sec in the AFVPL-treated group; while in the MFHPL-treated patients they were 31. 8167. 48 and 7. 6561. 98 sec, respectively.

40|$|Background/Aim. After {{external}} partial laryngectomias, videostroborscopy is very usefull in {{evaluation of}} postoperative phonatory mehanisms showing the “slow motion” of the vibrations {{of the remaining}} laryngeal structures. The aim {{of this paper was}} to compare the videostroboscopic characteristics of the vibration and to establish the differences in the phonation mechanisms {{depending on the type of}} external partial laryngectomy performed. Methods. This prospective study was conducted during the period 2003 - 2009 at the Ear, Nose and Throat Clinic, Clinical Center of Vojvodina, Novi Sad, including 99 patients with laryngeal carcinoma, treated with open surgical approach using different types of vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>partial</b> <b>laryngectomy.</b> Videostroboscopy was used to analyse vibrations of the remaining laryngeal structures. Results. The dominant vibration structure after partial horizontal laryngectomy, chordectomy, frontolateral laryngectomy and three quarter laryngectomy was the remaining vocal fold, after hemilaryngectomy it was the false vocal fold and after subtotal and near total laryngectomy it was the arythenoid. In patients with supracricoid hemilaryngopharyngectomy performed, many different structures were involved in the vibration. After most of the partial laryngectomies, vibrations can be found in the reconstructed part of the defect. In both horizontal and vertical partial laryngectomies movements of the larynx during phonation were mostly medial, while in cricohyoidoglottopexies they were anterior-posterior. Most of the operated patients (72. 7 %) had insufficient occlusion of the neoglottis during the phonation. Conclusion. Videostroboscopy is a useful method in examining the phonation mechanisms of reconstructed laryngeal structures after partial laryngectomy as well as in planning postoperative voice therapy...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY- Posterior subglottic {{extension}} of glottic carcinoma {{has been a}} contraindi-cation for <b>partial</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> because of {{the proximity of the}} cricoid cartilage. Resection of the upper portion of the posterior aspect of the cricoid is necessary for adequate tumor resec-tion but is complicated by persistent aspiration. This paper presents a method of reconstruction following partial posterior cricoid resection. Vertical <b>partial</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> is an accepted procedure for glottic cancers that have extended beyond the confines of the membranous portion of the vocal cord. The limiting factor in the decision to perform a <b>partial</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> is often not related to the inability to en-compass the tumor, but to the inability to reconstruct the residual larynx which will maintain respiratory and sphinc-teric functions. The inability to preserve the sphincteric function is frequently the major factor in deciding against a <b>partial</b> <b>laryngectomy.</b> As surgical tech-niques evolve that preserve sphincteric function, fewer total laryngectomies will be required. Vocal cord carcinoma with subglottic extension limited to 1 em and occurring anteriorly, or anterolaterally has been adequately resected by vertical <b>partial</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> without sacrificing tumor control or functions of the larynx. " Pos-terior subglottic {{extension of}} more than 3 - 4 mm has been a contraindication to <b>partial</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> because of the proximity of the tumor to the cricoid cartilage. Adequate resection would re-quire removal of the underlying cricoid cartilage. Resection of the lateral and posterior aspects of the cricoid cartilage results in persistent aspiration. There-fore, total laryngectomy is required for the avoidance of aspiration rather than for adequate tumor resection.

Materials and Methods: Thirty-one patients underwent a supracricoid <b>partial</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> with (n = 14) or without (n = 17) an arytenoidectomy. A postopera-tive laryngeal CT examination {{was performed to}} statistically compare the thick-ness of the neoarytenoid soft tissue to the mucosa over the spared arytenoids. Results: The neoarytenoid soft tissue revealed an eccentric prominence in all 14 arytenoidectomy sites. Further, the neoarytenoid soft tissue was consistently thicker than the mucosa over spared arytenoids cartilage (p < 0. 01), however did not exceed 11 mm. Conclusion: The eccentric prominence of neoarytenoid soft tissue at the ary-tenoidectomy site during a supracricoid <b>partial</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> should be identified and distinguished from a recurrent mass when compared to spared arytenoid car-tilage on a postoperative laryngeal CT...|$|R

40|$|Objectives/Hypothesis: To {{develop a}} {{technique}} for computer enhanced robotic transoral supraglottic <b>partial</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> in the canine model. Study De-sign: Surgical procedure on the larynx in a canine {{model with a}} commercially available surgical robot. Methods:With use of the da Vinci Surgical Robot (In-tuitive Surgical, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA), the supraglottic <b>partial</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> was performed on a mongrel dog that had been orotracheally intubated using gen-eral anesthesia. The videoscope and the 8 mm end-effectors of the robotic system were introduced through three ports, transorally. The surgical proce-durewas performed remotely from the robotic system console. The procedure was documented with still and video photography. Results: Supraglottic <b>partial</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> was successfully performed using the da Vinci Surgical Robot, with 8 mm instrumentation. The robotic system allowed for celerity and accuracy secondary to findings specific to the surgical ap-proach, including excellent hemostasis, superb visu-alization of the operative field with expeditious iden-tification of laryngeal submucosal soft tissue and skeletal landmarks, and multiplanar transection of tissues. In addition, {{the use of the}} robotic system also was found to have technical advantages inherent in robotic surgery, including the use of “wristed ” instru-mentation, tremor abolition, motion scaling, and three-dimensional vision. Conclusions: The da Vinci Surgical Robot allowed for successful robotic trans-oral supraglottic <b>partial</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> in the canine model.

40|$|Objective: Sporadic {{episodes of}} {{aspiration}} may occur after supracricoid <b>partial</b> <b>laryngectomy.</b> To prevent risks of pulmonary consequences, {{a limitation of}} oral intake of food or a "nothing by mouth" regimen has been suggested. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the long-term swallowing and pulmonary status of patients after supracricoid <b>partial</b> <b>laryngectomy.</b> Study Design: Case series with chart review. Setting: Tertiary University Hospital Policlinico "Umberto I" and Santa Lucia Foundation, Rome, Italy. Subjects and Methods: The swallowing status of a selected group of 116 patients who recovered functional deglutition after supracricoid <b>partial</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> was analyzed during follow-up consultation. Swallowing evaluation included clinical observation, fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing, and a videofluoroscopy. When aspiration was confirmed by videofluoroscopy, a high-resolution computed tomography (CT) of the chest was performed in order to assess the radiological manifestations of aspiration. A group of 45 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and normal deglutition was used as a control. Results: Seventy-nine patients out of 116 showed a fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing suggestive for aspiration; only 45 patients had aspiration confirmed by videofluoroscopy. No significant differences in radiological findings were noted in the patients affected by postoperative chronic aspiration compared to the control group. Conclusion: Patients with functional deglutition after supracricoid <b>partial</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> show a mild and well-tolerated degree of chronic aspiration and do not require a limitation of oral intake of food. © 2010 American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation...|$|R
40|$|<b>Partial</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> for glottic carcinoma. The authors {{report their}} first results on 63 {{patients}} who underwent a <b>partial</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> for glottic carcinoma from 1980 to 1986. The global three years survival rate is 70 %. The selected operations are the cordectomy, the fronto-lateral laryngectomy according to Leroux-Robert, the reconstructive near total laryngectomy according to Tucker, the reconstructive subtotal laryngectomy according to Majer-Piquet and Labayle. On {{the occasion of}} this paper, a scale is presented for the appreciation of the obtained functional results as for the three laryngeal functions: the breathing, the swallowing and the phonation. The mean time before the tracheal tube removal indicating the recovery of these three functions ranges from 5 days for the cordectomy which is the simplest operation to 38 days for the reconstructive subtotal laryngectomy according to Labayle which is the heaviest. Only one serious post-operative complication is noted for the 63 patients. It is a death following a coma after laryngeal oedema. A <b>partial</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> is possible after radiotherapy provided the rules according to Biller and Croll were respected...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To {{retrospectively}} analyze {{our experience}} of transoral laser microsurgery (TLM) for treating postoperative laryngeal obstruction (POLO) after supracricoid and supratracheal <b>laryngectomy</b> (open <b>partial</b> <b>horizontal</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> [OPHL]) types 2 and 3, and to investigate potential relationships between patients' clinical features and their functional outcomes. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study. METHODS: The prognostic influence of clinical and surgical parameters on functional outcomes was investigated in a univariate statistical setting in terms of decannulation rate (DR), time to tracheostomy closure (TTC), and number of laser procedures required (NLP). RESULTS: OPHL type 2 {{was associated with a}} better functional outcome than OPHL type 3 in terms of DR, TTC, and NLP (P =. 03, P =. 02, and P =. 02, respectively). Annular and semicircumferential stenoses developed more frequently after OPHL type 3, and were particularly difficult to manage with TLM. Fixation of the residual arytenoid was a negative prognostic factor in terms of functional outcome in terms of DR, TTC, and NLP (P =. 0002, P =. 08, and P =. 08, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: There is no standardized laser treatment for POLO; it must be tailored to individual patients. Identifying prognostic factors influencing functional outcome could help surgeons to earmark patients less likely to benefit from TLM for the treatment of POLO, and enable an adequate preoperative counseling, given the high probability of repeat postoperative TLM procedures.

40|$|Objective: Laryngeal {{reconstruction}} {{is needed}} to preserve laryngeal function in patients who have undergone extensive vertical or frontal <b>partial</b> <b>laryngectomy.</b> However, the procedure remains a difficult challenge. Several reconstruction techniques have been described, but these techniques pose risks of complications such as laryngeal stenosis. This study aimed to evaluate the postoperative course and functional outcomes of a new technique that combined a muscle-pedicle hyoid bone and a thyrohyoid flap during laryngeal reconstruction after tumor resection. Methods: Four patients underwent extensive vertical partial or frontal <b>partial</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> for cancer. After tumor resection, laryngeal reconstruction was performed using the proposed technique. Postoperative recovery time, complications, and oncologic results were evaluated. Results: The four patients were successfully treated with the proposed technique. No dyspnea, dysphagia, or death occurred during the postoperative course. Decannulation was performed after a median of 3 days. The average postoperative hospital stay was 7 days. Short-term postoperative functional recovery was normal. No laryngeal stenosis or tumor recurrence was observed {{in any of the}} four patients after a follow-up period of more than 24 months. Conclusion: The combination of the muscle-pedicle hyoid bone and the thyrohyoid flap is a reliable procedure for laryngeal reconstruction after extensive vertical partial or frontal <b>partial</b> <b>laryngectomy...</b>|$|R

40|$|Surgery is the {{preferred}} modality for curative treatment of recurrent laryngeal cancer after failure of nonsurgical treatments. Patients with initial early-stage cancer experiencing recurrence following radiotherapy often have more advanced-stage tumors {{by the time the}} recurrence is recognized. About one third of such recurrent cancers are suitable for conservation surgery. Endoscopic resection with the CO(2) laser or open <b>partial</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> (<b>partial</b> vertical, supracricoid, or supraglottic laryngectomies) have been used. The outcomes of conservation surgery appear better than those after total laryngectomy, because of selection bias. Transoral laser surgery is currently used more frequently than open <b>partial</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> for treatment of early-stage recurrence, with outcomes equivalent to open surgery but with less associated morbidity. Laser surgery has also been employed for selective cases of advanced recurrent disease, but patient selection and expertise are required for application of this modality to rT 3 tumors. In general, conservation laryngeal surgery is a safe and effective treatment for localized recurrences after radiotherapy for early-stage glottic cancer. Recurrent advanced-stage cancers should generally be treated by total laryngectomy...|$|R
