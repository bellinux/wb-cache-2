5|$|Those {{targets that}} did {{pose a threat}} {{automatically}} triggered the switch to engagement mode. This created a new beam constantly aimed at the target, sweeping its <b>focus</b> <b>point</b> through the threat tube to pick out individual objects within it. Data from these beams extracted velocity data to a separate computer to attempt {{to pick out the}} warhead as the decoys slowed in the atmosphere. Only one Coherent Signal Processing System (CSPS) was ever built, and for testing it was connected to the Zeus Discrimination Radar on Kwajalein.|$|E
25|$|The {{reflector}} {{affects the}} quality and directionality of the light output. A reflector is located behind or around the light source {{in such a way}} as to direct more light towards the lens or opening. Each unit has a characteristic reflector, used in conjunction with the lens (or lack thereof) to create the desired effect. An ellipsoidal reflector has a lamp set at one <b>focus</b> <b>point</b> of an ellipsoid-shaped reflector that bounces the light and focuses it at the second <b>focus</b> <b>point</b> of the ellipse. This focuses the beam of light into a tight beam. Ellipsoidal reflectors often are used for tight, focusable spots, although they can be used for floodlights, such as in scoops (see below). A parabolic reflector has a lamp set at the <b>focus</b> <b>point</b> of a parabola-shaped reflector that bounces the light in parallel beams away from the reflector. There is no point at which the light converges, so the light is unfocusable. Parabolic reflectors are used for lights intended to provide an unfocused wash, such as PAR cans.|$|E

On 19 April 2007 a special reenactment {{of life in the}} World War II era was {{organised}} by the Mid-Norfolk Railway and hosted at County School station. On 22 June 2009 over a hundred road vehicles from origins of the 70s and earlier were hosted by the railway for a special event.|$|E
40|$|As one of {{the most}} {{important}} part of spatial analysis, spatial direction relationships acts as the most valuable rule in the process of automated simplification of spatial points cluster. In this paper spatial point cluster are divided into two parts. One is the boundary points, the other are the <b>focus</b> <b>points.</b> Leaving the boundary points alone, only the <b>focus</b> <b>points</b> are considered. The influence of spatial direction relationships to the automated simplification of <b>focus</b> <b>points</b> is discussed. The method keeping the direction relationships of <b>focus</b> <b>points</b> during the automated simplification is put forward. At the end the further research of direction relationships to the automated simplification of points cluster is proposed...|$|R

25|$|Fresnels use a spherical {{reflector}}, {{with the}} lamp at the <b>focus</b> <b>point.</b> The lamp and reflector remain a fixed unit inside the housing, and are moved {{forward and back}} to focus the light. This is accomplished using a slider on the bottom or side of the lantern, or using a worm track. At very tight focus, the lanterns are the least efficient, as the least light can escape the housing. Therefore, Fresnels are not good for tight focus on small areas. They are most often used at medium distances from the stage for area lighting.|$|E

The fort is oblong in shape with semicircular bastions, a moat encircling it and three fortifications at different levels, built with cut stone blocks. The fort has a palace, residence buildings, underground chamber and an underground passage that links Pettai (the top level) with Kottai Medu (lower level).

25|$|The early 90s saw {{the team}} rise to {{prominence}} in the community once again as the war had begun in the homeland culminating in a trip to Croatia sponsored by the Croatian Ministry of Sports and culture featuring friendlies against Dinamo Zagreb, Hajduk Split, Osijek, Rijeka, Varazdin, and Tomislavgrad. Similar to the early 70s, the team was now a central <b>focus</b> <b>point</b> within the Croatian community as everyone in diaspora focused on getting the homeland officially recognized. At this time, the NSL was beginning to see an elevated level of play, and the attendance at all league games was beginning to rise. Toronto Croatia consistently had the largest attendance of all {{teams in the league}} during this era (1990–95).|$|E

500|$|For most birds, moult {{begins at}} a certain {{specific}} point, called a focus (plural foci), on the wing or tail and proceeds in a sequential manner in one or both directions from there. [...] For example, most passerines have a focus between the innermost primary (P1, using the numbering scheme explained above) and outermost secondary (S1), and a <b>focus</b> <b>point</b> {{in the middle of}} the center pair of rectrices. [...] As passerine moult begins, the two feathers closest to the focus are the first to drop. [...] When replacement feathers reach roughly half of their eventual length, the next feathers in line (P2 and S2 on the wing, and both R2s on the tail) are dropped. [...] This pattern of drop and replacement continues until moult reaches either end of the wing or tail. [...] The speed of the moult can vary somewhat within a species. [...] Some passerines that breed in the Arctic, for example, drop many more flight feathers at once (sometimes becoming briefly flightless) in order to complete their entire wing moult prior to migrating south, while those same species breeding at lower latitudes undergo a more protracted moult.|$|E

2500|$|In the past, plastic gobos were {{generally}} custom made for when a pattern requires color and glass does not suffice. However, in a [...] "traditional" [...] (tungston-halogen) light fixture, the <b>focus</b> <b>point</b> {{position of a}} gobo is extremely hot, so these thin plastic films require special cooling elements to prevent melting. A lapse in the cooling apparatus, even for seconds, can ruin a plastic a gobo in a tungsten-halogen lighting instrument.|$|E
40|$|One-shot (one-time) {{decision}} problems {{concern the}} situations where {{a decision is}} experienced only once. Such one-shot decision problems are commonly encountered in business, economics and social systems. One-shot decision theory has been initially proposed by Guo [4]. The one-shot decision procedure comprises two steps. In the first step, a decision maker identifies which state of nature {{should be taken into}} account for each alternative amongst all available states of nature. These identified states of nature are called <b>focus</b> <b>points.</b> In the second step, a decision maker evaluates the alternatives based on <b>focus</b> <b>points</b> where the consequences provided by all alternatives are compared with each other to obtain the best alternative. In this paper, the properties of <b>focus</b> <b>points</b> are given and the detailed proofs are shown...|$|R

2500|$|The Arlesdale Railway in The Railway Series by Rev. W. Awdry {{is based}} on the Ravenglass and Eskdale Railway. In Small Railway Engines (1967), Awdry relates part of a holiday he spent visiting the Ravenglass and Eskdale Railway with the Rev. E. R. Boston; the two appear in the book as the Thin Clergyman and the Fat Clergyman, respectively. The Arlesdale Railway was also the <b>focus</b> <b>point</b> in Jock the New Engine, with an {{incident}} that was inspired by an accident that happened on the Ravenglass and Eskdale Railway, when Perkins crashed {{in the back of the}} shed, and [...] with cameos in other books.|$|E
2500|$|Kirkcaldy, {{unlike most}} Scottish towns, had no stone wall. The town, instead {{relied on the}} sea acting as a shelter, which still could have left the town {{vulnerable}} to attack. The construction of Ravenscraig Castle lowered the risk, {{with the process of}} small walls or [...] "heid dykes" [...] built on rigs {{to the west of the}} High Street. The majority of the dykes contained small gates for the benefit of the town crofts and burgesses, who were responsible for their protection and maintenance.

40|$|The field {{distributions}} of focused beam through a finite aperture lens varies depending upon its incidence conditions and aperture dimension. When the aperture {{radius of the}} lens is not large enough compared with the spot size of the incident laser beam, the most <b>focused</b> <b>point</b> cannot be determined uniquely. Two of the most simple definitions of this <b>focused</b> <b>point</b> are, 1) {{the point where the}} axial intensity is maximum and 2) the point where the spread of the field is smallest. These points are easily obtained theoretically or numerically. The <b>focused</b> <b>points</b> are measured and compared wih them obtained from above definitions. The results show that the point defined by the point of maximum axial intenisty coincide with theoretical calculations, while the point of the minimum field spread has some deviation from theoretical one...|$|R
