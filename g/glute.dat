5000|$|On February 29, 2008, the 22nd IFBB Ms. International {{competition}} was held {{as part of}} the Arnold Sports Festival at the Greater Columbus Convention Center and the Franklin County Veterans Memorial in Columbus, Ohio. Yaxeni Oriquen-Garcia won her 4th overall IFBB Ms. International title, with 3 heavyweight IFBB Ms. International titles, giving her more IFBB Ms. International wins than any other bodybuilder and beating the former record of Ondrea Gates, who had 3 overall IFBB Ms. International titles, and 2 heavyweight IFBB Ms. International titles. Yaxeni Oriquen-Garcia also surpassed the record of Kenneth Wheeler, who holds 4 overall IFBB Arnold Classic titles. Yaxeni Oriquen-Garcia's record would not be broken until the 2010 IFBB Ms. International by Iris Kyle. The scorecard was close, with Yaxeni Oriquen-Garcia getting 38 points and Dayana Cadeau getting 40 points. In rounds 1 and 2, Dayana Cadeau won 10 points, while Yaxeni Oriquen-Garcia achieved 20 points. In round 3, Yaxeni Oriquen-Garcia won 5 points, while Dayana Cadeau won 10 points. In round 4, Yaxeni Oriquen-Garcia won 5 points, while Dayana Cadeau won 12 points. This was the third time two-point victory in IFBB Ms. International history. There was a bit of controversy when Iris Kyle tied with Betty Viana-Adkins for 7th place. Sandy Ranalli, head IFBB judge at the Ms. International competition, later {{said in an interview with}} Larry Pepe about why Iris Kyle was placed 7th was because [...] "Her shoulders were a little bit you know distorted. There were distortions in her <b>glute</b> area..

40|$|Background. The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the peak {{electromyography}} (EMG) of the most commonly-used position in the literature, the prone bent-leg (90 °) hip extension against manual resistance applied to the distal thigh (PRONE), to a novel position, the standing <b>glute</b> squeeze (SQUEEZE). Methods. Surface EMG electrodes were placed on the upper and lower gluteus maximus of thirteen recreationally active females (age = 28. 9 years; height = 164 cm; body mass = 58. 2 kg), before three maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) trials for each position were obtained in a randomized, counterbalanced fashion. Results. No statistically significant (p < 0. 05) differences were observed between PRONE (upper: 91. 94 %; lower: 94. 52 %) and SQUEEZE (upper: 92. 04 %; lower: 85. 12 %) for both the upper and lower gluteus maximus. Neither the PRONE nor SQUEEZE was more effective between all subjects. Conclusions. In agreement with other studies, no single testing position is ideal for every participant. Therefore, it is recommended that investigators employ multiple MVIC positions, when possible, to ensure accuracy. Future research should investigate a variety of gluteus maximus MVIC positions in heterogeneous samples...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND/AIMS—Coeliac {{disease is}} a chronic {{intestinal}} disorder most probably caused by an abnormal immune reaction to wheat gliadin. The identification of the HLA-DQ 2 and HLA-DQ 8 as the molecules responsible for the HLA association in coeliac disease strongly implicates a role for CD 4 T cells in disease pathogenesis. Indeed, CD 4 T cells specific for gliadin have been isolated from the small intestine of patients with coeliac disease. However, identification of T cell epitopes within gliadin has been hampered by the heterogeneous nature of the gliadin antigen. To aid the characterisation of gliadin T cell epitopes, multiple recombinant gliadins have been produced from a commercial Nordic wheat cultivar.  METHODS—The α-gliadin and γ-gliadin genes were amplified by polymerase chain reaction from cDNA and genomic DNA, cloned into a pET expression vector, and sequenced. Genes encoding mature gliadins were expressed in Escherichia coli and tested for recognition by T cells.  RESULTS—In total, 16  α-gliadin genes with complete open reading frames were sequenced. These genes encoded 11  distinct gliadin proteins, only {{one of which was}} found in the Swiss-Prot database. Expression of these gliadin genes produced a panel of recombinant α-gliadin proteins of purity suitable for use as an antigen for T cell stimulation.  CONCLUSION—This study provides an insight into the complexity of the gliadin antigen present in a wheat strain and has defined a panel of pure gliadin antigens that should prove invaluable for the future mapping of epitopes recognised by intestinal T cells in coeliac disease.    Keywords: gliadin; coeliac disease; small intestine; protein expression; T lymphocyte; <b>glute...</b>|$|E

The aim of this work was to explore this relationship, considering if CD could be associated with specific baseline AN-related clinical features. Methods: In this retrospective study, 82 adolescent female out- and inpatients with AN of the restrictive type (ANr), according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition criteria, were recruited. CD diagnosis and related serology were recorded, including tissue transglutaminase type- 2 antibodies, endomysial antibodies, and antibodies against deamidated forms of gliadin peptides. Eating disorder inventory- 3, Children’s Depression Inventory, body mass index, age, and disease duration data recorded at the time of blood withdrawal were also obtained from each patient. Results: Five (6. 1 %) subjects presented a CD disorder associated with AN: none of the collected psychometric measures was significantly correlated with any CD-related parameter or characterized as a specific subgroup. Conclusion: CD diagnosis or serology does not relate to ANr clinical or demographic characteristics. However, a slight increase in prevalence with respect to the general population might be hypothesized and possibly elucidated by further studies with an appropriate design.

40|$|Mestrado em Engenharia Alimentar - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaThe present {{work has}} as purpose {{to develop a}} pizza base for a {{targeted}} customer suffering from the celiac disease, valuing by-products from the rice industry, namely flour of broken rice and rice bran. The {{aim of this study}} is to develop a mix, for pizza base, designed for home preparation, increasing the market supply of gluten-free products to lower the prices normally associated with this kind of products. Today Portugal can count with 15 permanent industries in rice milling (Ania, 2010). The by-products from the processing of the agro-industry raw materials from rice are usually considered as non-hazardous, abundant, easily biodegradable, cheap and potentially recoverable. However, there may be an economic problem, due to the large quantities processed, thus imposing a productivity burden significant in this sector. The production of gluten-free bakery products presents a technological challenge, due to the limited capacity of the gluten-free doughs in sustaining the CO 2 produced during fermentation. We studied the effect of various ingredients added to the pizza dough. These studies were carried out at the level of texture - Texture Profile Analysis and Cutting test; rheology - test of stress and frequency sweep; aw (water activity), and the expandability of the dough throughout the fermentation (over-run percentage). A sensory testing was performed to the pizza bases with a panel of non-celiac tasters. From the results, the formulation F 5 with 33 % of rice bran and 4 % of broken rice flour was emphasized, which led to better technological and sensory characteristics with rheological characteristics similar to commercial gluten-free pizza base. A comparison of nutritional formulation developed in this study was also performed with two commercial mixes, a gluten-free one and another whole meal with <b>glute...</b>|$|E
