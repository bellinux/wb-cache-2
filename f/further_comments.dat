Ovid <b>further</b> <b>comments</b> that hating one's father is a crime, but Myrrha's love was a greater crime. Ovid therefore blamed it on the Furies.|$|E

Dio <b>further</b> <b>comments</b> that Macrinus hosted a dinner for the residents of Apamea in honour of Diadumenian. At the dinner, Macrinus was supposedly presented with the head of Ulpius Julianus who had been killed by his soldiers. In response, Macrinus left Apamea headed south.|$|E

500|$|Mark F. Hall, {{examining}} Tolkien's own use of alliterative verse, {{writes that}} Tolkien notes that [...] "the Beowulf poet likely was consciously using archaic and literary words", and compares this to Tolkien's own practice in poems such as [...] "The Lay of the Children of Húrin", where, Hall thinks, Tolkien's words {{could be applied}} to his own verse: [...] "Its manner and conventions, and its metre, are unlike those of modern English verse. Also it is preserved fragmentarily and by chance, and has only in recent times been redeciphered and interpreted, without the aid of any tradition or gloss". Hall <b>further</b> <b>comments</b> that in 'Lays of Beleriand', Tolkien failed to heed his own warning against archaism, as he uses the word [...] "weird" [...] archaically to mean 'fate' (OE 'wyrd'), and speculates that this may have been a reaction against the [...] "rigidity and formality of translating authentic Anglo-Saxon literature." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{a hidden}} extra for the Blu-ray version of Revenge of the Fallen, Bay {{expressed}} {{his intention to}} make Transformers 3 not necessarily larger than Revenge of the Fallen, but instead deeper into the mythology, to give it more character development, {{and to make it}} darker and more emotional. Unicron is briefly shown in a secret Transformers 3 preview feature in the Revenge of the Fallen Blu-ray disc. Ultimately, the producers decided to forgo a plot involving the planet-eating Transformer, and no <b>further</b> <b>comments</b> were ever made on the subject. Having been called Transformers 3 up to that point, the film's final title was revealed to be Dark of the Moon in October 2010. After Revenge of the Fallen was almost universally panned by critics, Bay acknowledged the general flaws of the script, having blamed the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike prior to the film for many problems. Bay promised to not have the [...] "dorky comedy" [...] from the last film. On March 19, 2010, the script was said to be finished.|$|E

500|$|Woon was {{the first}} Attorney-General in {{more than ten years}} to {{personally}} appear in court. On 28 July 2008, he argued before the Court of Appeal that a woman who had manipulated her teenage lover into killing her husband should be given a life sentence. The Court held that a life sentence was inappropriate due to the defendant's psychiatric condition, and affirmed the nine-year jail term imposed by the High Court. Woon elected to take proceedings against Tang Wee Sung, chairman of the company C.K. Tang which owns Tangs department store, for the illegal purchase of a human organ– a kidney– in the first case of its kind in Singapore. The decision to do so was criticised by Dr. Lee Wei Ling, Director of the National Neuroscience Institute and daughter of Minister Mentor and former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, in an article published in The Straits Times on 5 September 2008. Woon replied, pointing out a number of misconceptions she held as to the facts and the law, and emphasising that the prosecution had been brought as no one was above the law. Subsequently, in response to <b>further</b> <b>comments</b> by Dr. Lee, he wrote an extended article entitled [...] "Wrong Facts and Faulty Logic" [...] that appeared in The Straits Times on 18 September 2008.|$|E
500|$|In May 2015, Marvel Studios head Kevin Feige {{stated that}} there were [...] "no active plans for the One-Shots to return", but added that the studio was not opposed to {{continuing}} the series, and there was already [...] "a backlog of ideas" [...] for potential One-Shots. In September 2015, Feige provided <b>further</b> <b>comments</b> on {{the return of the}} One-Shots, saying, [...] "The universe is big, and we're moving up to three [...] a year this year. I don't know how much beyond that we can go... we do talk about [...] a lot...It's just about finding the time and the place." [...] In June 2017, Spider-Man actor Tom Holland hinted that Marvel was planning on creating more One-Shots. That October, Pearson further hinted that Marvel was interested in creating more, adding he had [...] "a whole folder full of other One-Shots" [...] he had created. Taika Waititi, director of , also stated there had been discussions to resurrect the One-Shots, creating one centered on the characters Korg and Miek from Ragnarok. Feige also noted that the One-Shot films could potentially [...] "morph into extra content that’s created prior to a film’s release instead of for its home entertainment release", noting the successful [...] "Team Thor" [...] mockumentary shorts directed by Waititi, which [...] "were great fun, and are quite doable, and in some parts helped redefine Thor into what he's become in Ragnarok in a fun way.

500|$|Pradip Bhattacharya, {{author of}} Of Kunti and Satyawati: Sexually Assertive Women of the Mahabharata, praises Satyavati's {{handling}} of her {{encounter with the}} sage Parashara. He notes that although young, she tackles the persistent sage with great maturity and presence of mind. Bhattacharya remarks, [...] "With a maturity and frankness that astonishes us even in the twenty-first century, {{she points out that}} coitus ought to be mutually enjoyable." [...] She is not deluded by the belief that the sage will marry her, and asks for virginity to ensure her future status in society. Bhattacharya <b>further</b> <b>comments</b> on the sequence of her requests: the bodily fragrance to make the sexual act pleasant for both, the veil of mist to keep the act a secret, virginal status for her future and fame for her child - securing his fame and, after practical aspects are sorted out, [...] "eternally feminine" [...] boons of lifelong youth and fragrance. Bhattacharya says: [...] "Modern-day women could well wish that they were half as confident, clear-headed and assertive of their desires and goals as Satyavati." [...] He further praises her [...] "characteristic far-sightedness", when she ensures the future of her children with Shantanu by indirectly disposing of the crown prince Bhishma. She brings her illegitimate son, Vyasa, onto the scene to father sons with her dead son's widows – turning the renowned [...] "lunar dynasty, into the lineage of a dasa (slave) maiden".|$|E

500|$|The Sackler Gallery, {{part of the}} Smithsonian Institution, was due to {{host the}} US premiere {{exhibition}} of the Belitung cargo in early 2012—a date set {{to coincide with the}} Smithsonian museum's 25th anniversary celebration. On 28 June 2011 it was reported that the museum was postponing the show. The Sackler Gallery has received condemnation of the exhibition due to the time-frame and nature of the original excavation of the artefacts; with arguments put forwards about whether the display should be allowed. According to The New York Times, [...] "a group of archaeologists and anthropologists from the National Academy of Sciences — including Robert McCormick Adams, a former leader of the Smithsonian" [...] wrote {{to the head of the}} Smithsonian Institution, G. Wayne Clough, on 5 April 2011 claiming that [...] "proceeding with the exhibition would 'severely damage the stature and reputation' of the institution." [...] Proponents of the arguments against display say that the excavation was for commercial gain and conducted so quickly as to have caused a loss of information pertaining to the crew and cargo. The New York Times article goes on to say that <b>further</b> <b>comments</b> were made by [...] "the Society for American Archaeology, the Council of American Maritime Museums and the International Committee for Underwater Cultural Heritage, as well as groups within the Smithsonian, including the members of the anthropology department and the Senate of Scientists at its National Museum of Natural History" [...] all asking that the Smithsonian reconsider the exhibition. There are also claims that exhibiting the artefacts would be against international agreements on underwater excavations. Kimberly L. Faulk, a marine archaeologist and vice chairwoman of the non-governmental Advisory Council on Underwater Archaeology said that, [...] "by proceeding with the exhibition the Smithsonian — which is a research institution as well as a network of museums — would be violating its own set of professional ethics and promoting the looting of archaeological sites." ...|$|E
