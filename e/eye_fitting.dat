40|$|In the Baltic Sea {{area during}} the late 1980 s air and sea surface {{temperature}} increased. A longer growing season and increases in phytoplankton biomass as well as changes in the zooplankton and fish communities accompanied this. These changes are supposed to represent a regime shift in {{the ecology of the}} central Baltic Sea that could have been caused by a related sign change in the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index. But the NAO has changed sign more frequently {{and most of the time}} no corresponding regime shift did occur therefore we should check this hypothesis more thorough. We investigated additional to the NAO a broad range of variables including air temperature, sea surface temperature, phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass, fish abundance and oxygen. The time series data are analyzed with respect to autocorrelation, linear trends and the occurrence of breakpoints whereby always tests for statistical significance are conducted. Tests for structural breakpoints in these time series reveal for some of the investigated variables the existence of such breakpoints in the 70 - 80 ties of the last century. But surprisingly in many physical and biological variables and in the most common climate indices no clear breakpoints can be identified. Specifically the change of the NAO sign around 1987, which is proposed to be the reason for an ecological regime shift in the Baltic Sea is not statistically significant. The coincidence of the sign change and an ecological regime shift could just be pure random, but even the evidence for a clear ecological regime shift is missing. In summary we strongly advocate to apply sound statistical procedures for detecting regime shifts instead of <b>eye</b> <b>fitting</b> and qualitative descriptions. A strong hypothesis like the postulation of a regime shift 1987 caused by the change in the NAO sign does require strong evidence, but it seems we might not have that. JRC.

As usual, her condition is a puzzle for House’s team, until the eventual ‘Eureka moment’. The team solves the mystery through an eye examination. Kayser-Fleischer rings (copper-coloured circles in the cornea) are found in her <b>eyes,</b> <b>fitting</b> the diagnosis of Wilson’s disease- a genetic disorder in which copper accumulates in tissue (mainly in the liver and brain). For most life forms, copper is an essential element. It is utilised {{by a variety of}} enzymes that play important roles in energy generation...|$|R

Contact lenses can typically be ordered at the office that conducts the <b>eye</b> exam and <b>fitting.</b> The Fairness to Contact Lens Consumers Act gives consumers the right to obtain a copy of their contact lens prescription, allowing them to fill it at the lens provider of their choice.|$|R
50|$|A toggle rope {{was part}} of the {{standard}} equipment of British commandos and the Parachute Regiment during World War II. It was 6 ft long, and had a toggle at one end in a tightly <b>fitting</b> <b>eye</b> splice, with a larger eye at the other end. This enabled them to be fastened together to create an ersatz rope ladder, or to secure around a bundle for hauling, among other uses.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} 3 D <b>eye</b> model <b>fitting</b> {{algorithm}} {{for use in}} gaze estimation, that operates on pupil ellipse geometry alone. It works with no user-calibration and does not require calibrated lighting features such as glints. Our algorithm is based on fitting a consistent pupil motion model {{to a set of}} eye images. We describe a non-iterative method of initialising this model from detected pupil ellipses, and two methods of iteratively optimising the parameters of the model to best fit the original eye images. We also present a novel eye image dataset, based on a rendered simulation, which gives a perfect ground truth for gaze and pupil shape. We evaluate our approach using this dataset, measuring both the angular gaze error (in degrees) and the pupil reprojection error (in pixels), and discuss the limitations of a user-calibration–free approach...|$|R

40|$|We present GazeDirector, a new {{approach}} for eye gaze redirection that uses model-fitting. Our method first tracks the <b>eyes</b> by <b>fitting</b> a multi-part <b>eye</b> region model to video frames using analysis-by-synthesis, thereby recovering eye region shape, texture, pose, and gaze simultaneously. It then redirects gaze by 1) warping the eyelids from the original image using a model-derived flow field, and 2) rendering and compositing synthesized 3 D eyeballs onto the output image in a photorealistic manner. GazeDirector allows us to change where people are looking without person-specific training data, and with full articulation, i. e. we can precisely specify new gaze directions in 3 D. Quantitatively, we evaluate both model-fitting and gaze synthesis, with experiments for gaze estimation and redirection on the Columbia gaze dataset. Qualitatively, we compare GazeDirector against recent work on gaze redirection, showing better results especially for large redirection angles. Finally, we demonstrate gaze redirection on YouTube videos by introducing new 3 D gaze targets and by manipulating visual behavior...|$|R
5000|$|The mascots {{received}} mixed reviews. Creative Review said [...] "Both {{are clearly}} {{of the digital}} age. And we have to say, we think they look rather good". However, others were more critical, with one columnist claiming that the pair were {{the product of a}} [...] "drunken one-night stand between a Teletubby and a Dalek". Others have compared the mascots to Izzy, the mascot of the 1996 Summer Olympics, another critically panned mascot. Still others have remarked that the pair resemble Kang and Kodos from The Simpsons. However it has been found that children of the target audience (5 to 15 years) find the duo appealing.

60|$|So {{mother and}} sons {{returned}} to Bideford, {{and set to}} work. Frank mortgaged a farm; Will Cary did the same (having some land of his own from his mother). Old Salterne grumbled at any man save himself spending a penny on the voyage, and forced on the adventurers a good ship of two hundred tons burden, and five hundred pounds toward fitting her out; Mrs. Leigh worked day and night at clothes and comforts of every kind; Amyas had nothing to give but his time and his brains: but, as Salterne said, the rest would have been of little use without them; and day after day he and the old merchant were on board the ship, superintending with their own <b>eyes</b> the <b>fitting</b> of every rope and nail. Cary went about beating up recruits; and made, with his jests and his frankness, the best of crimps: while John Brimblecombe, beside himself with joy, toddled about after him from tavern to tavern, and quay to quay, exalted {{for the time being}} (as Cary told him) into a second Peter the Hermit; and so fiercely did he preach a crusade against the Spaniards, through Bideford and Appledore, Clovelly and Ilfracombe, that Amyas might have had a hundred and fifty loose fellows in the first fortnight. But he knew better: still smarting from the effects of a similar haste in the Newfoundland adventure, he had determined to take none but picked men; and by dint of labor he obtained them.|$|R
40|$|This paper proposes the Top-View Transformation Model for image {{coordinate}} transformation, {{which involves}} transforming a perspective projection image into its corresponding bird’s <b>eye</b> vision. A <b>fitting</b> parameters searching algorithm estimates the parameters {{that are used}} to transform the coordinates from the source image. Using this approach, {{it is not necessary to}} provide any interior and exterior orientation parameters of the camera. The designed car parking assistant system can be installed at the rear end of the car, providing the driver with a clearer image of the area behind the car. The processing time can be reduced by storing and using the transformation matrix estimated from the first image frame for a sequence of video images. The transformation matrix can be stored as the Matrix Mapping Table, and loaded into the embedded platform to perform the transformation. Experimental results show that the proposed approaches can provide a clearer and more accurate bird’s eye view to the vehicle driver...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{report the}} {{successful}} outcome obtained after fitting a new hybrid contact lens in a cornea with {{an area of}} donor-host misalignment and significant levels of irregular astigmatism after penetrating keratoplasty (PKP). Materials and methods: A 41 -year-old female with bilateral asymmetric keratoconus underwent PKP in her left eye due to the advanced status of the disease. One year after surgery, the patient referred a poor visual acuity and quality in this <b>eye.</b> The <b>fitting</b> {{of different types of}} rigid gas permeable contact lenses was performed, but with an unsuccessful outcome due to contact lens stability problems and uncomfortable wear. Scheimpflug imaging evaluation revealed that a donor-host misalignment was present at the nasal area. Contact lens fitting with a reverse geometry hybrid contact lens (Clearkone, SynergEyes Carlsbad) was then fitted. Visual, refractive, and ocular aberrometric outcomes were evaluated during a 1 -year period after the fitting. Results: Uncorrected distance visual acuity improved from a prefitting value of 20 / 200 to a best corrected postfitting value of 20 / 20. Prefitting manifest refraction was + 5. 00 sphere and - 5. 50 cylinder at 75 °, with a corrected distance visual acuity of 20 / 30. Higher order root mean square (RMS) for a 5 mm pupil changed from a prefitting value of 6. 83 µm to a postfitting value of 1. 57 µm (5 mm pupil). The contact lens wearing was referred as comfortable, with no anterior segment alterations. Conclusion: The SynergEyes Clearkone contact lens seems to be another potentially useful option for the visual rehabilitation after PKP, especially in cases of donor-host misalignment...|$|R
40|$|An Active Appearance Model (AAM) is a {{variable}} shape and appearance model built from annotated training images. It {{has been largely}} used to synthesize or fit face images. Person-independent face AAM fitting is a challenging open issue. For standard AAMs, fitting a face image for an individual which {{is not in the}} training set is often limited in accuracy, thereby restricting the range of application. As a first contribution, we show that the limitation mainly comes from the inability of the AAM appearance counterpart to generalize, i. e. to accurately generate previously unseen visual data. As a second contribution, we propose an efficient person-independent face fitting framework based on what we call multi-level segmented AAMs. Each segment encodes a physically meaningful part of the face, such as an <b>eye.</b> A coarse-to-fine <b>fitting</b> strategy with a gradually increasing number of segments is used in order to ensure a large convergence basin. Fitting accuracy is assessed by comparison with manual labelling statistics constructed from multiple data annotations. Experimental results support the claim that standard AAMs are well-adapted to person-specific fitting while segmented AAMs outperform the classical AAMs in a personindependent context in terms of accuracy, and ability to generate new faces. ...|$|R
60|$|Miss Marrable {{had heard}} {{a great deal about}} Mr. Gilmore. Mary, indeed, was not {{inclined}} to keep secrets from her aunt, and her very long absence,--so much longer than had at first been intended,--could hardly have been sanctioned unless some reason had been given. There had been many letters on the subject, not only between Mary and her aunt, but between Mrs. Fenwick and her very old friend Miss Marrable. Of course these latter letters had spoken loudly the praises of Mr. Gilmore, and Miss Marrable had become quite one of the Gilmore faction. She desired that her niece should marry; but that she should marry a gentleman. She would have infinitely preferred to see Mary an old maid, than to hear {{that she was going to}} give herself to any suitor contaminated by trade. Now Mr. Gilmore's position was exactly that which Miss Marrable regarded as being the best in England. He was a country gentleman, living on his own acres, a justice of the peace, whose father and grandfather and great-grandfather had occupied exactly the same position. Such a marriage for Mary would be quite safe; and in those days one did hear so often of girls making, she would not say improper marriages, but marriages which in her <b>eyes</b> were not <b>fitting!</b> Mr. Gilmore, she thought, exactly filled that position which entitled a gentleman to propose marriage to such a lady as Mary Lowther.|$|R
40|$|Recently, the {{research}} interest on biometric systems and applications has significantly grown up, aiming {{to bring the}} benefits of biometrics to the broader range of users. As signal processing and feature extraction play {{a very important role}} for biometric applications, they can be thought as a particular subset of pattern recognition techniques. Most of iris biometric systems have been designed for security applications and work on near-infrared (NIR) images. NIR images are not affected by illumination changes in visible light making systems working both in darker and lighter conditions. The reverse of the medal is a very short distance allowed between the acquisition camera and the user, further than a strictly controlled pose of the eye. For those reasons, the viability of NIR image based systems in commercial applications is quite limited. Several efforts have been devoted to designing new iris biometric approaches on color images acquired in visible wavelength light (VW). However, illumination changes significantly affect the iris pattern as well as the periocular region making both segmentation and feature extraction harder than in NIR. In the specific case of iris biometrics, segmentation represents a crucial aspect, as it must be fast as well as accurate. To this aim, a new watershed based approach for iris segmentation in color images is presented in this paper. The watershed transform is exploited to binarize an image of the <b>eye,</b> while circle <b>fitting</b> together with a ranking approach is applied to first approximate the iris boundary with a circle. The experimental results demonstrate this approach to be effective with respect to location accuracy...|$|R
500|$|Reborn dolls {{are usually}} found online {{and can be}} {{purchased}} through eBay, artists' online stores (often termed nurseries), and conventions/fairs. Incomplete crafting [...] "kits" [...] to create original reborns can also be purchased from various online stores. There is a large price range depending {{on the quality of}} the doll, the sculpt used and the experience of the artist, they can sell anywhere from hundreds to thousands of dollars. There are many factors to look for when purchasing a reborn. If the complexion is too dark this is called a blue baby, and indicates it was dyed excessively or uses colored sand for weight that could have seeped into the vinyl. The type of material used to weight the reborn should be considered because some materials do not react well with vinyl and will cause it to deteriorate. The doll should not be shiny. This indicates the doll was washed with acetone before painting, which prevents the color from correctly sticking to the doll's surface. It may also be caused by the type of paint used to color the doll. This is corrected with a special matte varnish. The parts used are important, as original parts may be replaced. The replacement parts must be appropriately proportioned with the doll and made of quality material. At times having the original body retains the doll's value either because it was made to fit that specific doll, or the artist left a signature mark. <b>Eye</b> brand, size, <b>fitting,</b> and alignment should be closely examined. Another feature to observe is the type of paint used for coloring and whether the doll is realistic in its details such as veins and newborn imperfections. The type of hair and technique used in applying the hair may determine the quality. Some artists open the nose, the holes should be correctly shaped, and the nails should be properly manicured.|$|R
60|$|To {{those who}} do not love to {{contemplate}} the fall of human greatness, I do not know a more mortifying spectacle than to see the assembled majesty of the crowned heads of Europe waiting as patient suitors in the antechamber of Regicide. They wait, it seems, until the sanguinary tyrant Carnot shall have snorted away the fumes of the indigested blood of his sovereign. Then, when, sunk on the down of usurped pomp, he shall have sufficiently indulged his meditations with what monarch he shall next glut his ravening maw, he may condescend to signify that it is his pleasure to be awake, and that he is at leisure to receive the proposals of his high and mighty clients for the terms on which he may respite the execution of the sentence he has passed upon them. At the opening of those doors, what a sight it must be to behold the plenipotentiaries of royal impotence, in the precedency which they will intrigue to obtain, and which will be granted to them according to the seniority of their degradation, sneaking into the Regicide presence, and, with the relics of the smile which they had dressed up for the levee of their masters still flickering on their curled lips, presenting the faded remains of their courtly graces, to meet the scornful, ferocious, sardonic grin of a bloody ruffian, who, whilst he is receiving their homage, is measuring them with his <b>eye,</b> and <b>fitting</b> to their size the slider of his guillotine! These ambassadors may easily return as good courtiers as they went; but can they ever return from that degrading residence loyal and faithful subjects, or with any true affection to their master, or true attachment to the constitution, religion, or laws of their country? There is great danger that they, who enter smiling into this Trophonian cave, will come out of it sad and serious conspirators, and such will continue as long as they live. They will become true conductors of contagion to every country which has had the misfortune to send them to the source of that electricity. At best, they will become totally indifferent to good and evil, to one institution or another. This species of indifference is but too generally distinguishable in those who have been much employed in foreign courts, but in the present case the evil must be aggravated without measure: for they go from their country, not with the pride of the old character, but in a state of the lowest degradation; and what must happen in their place of residence can have no effect in raising them to the level of true dignity or of chaste self-estimation, either as men or as representatives of crowned heads.|$|R
