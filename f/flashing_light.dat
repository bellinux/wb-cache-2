The assailants attempt to {{apprehend}} Krycek, but are severely injured when he emits a <b>flashing</b> <b>light.</b> The Smoking Man sees their bodies and orders their destruction. Mulder, who was knocked unconscious in the crash, awakens in the hospital. Dana Scully tells Mulder about Walter Skinner's condition, and says that an analysis of saliva has identified his shooter as the same person who killed her sister Melissa.|$|E

5000|$|In {{configurations}} {{that include}} sequenced <b>flashing</b> <b>lights,</b> {{the lights are}} typically strobes mounted {{in front of the}} runway on its extended centerline. These <b>lights</b> <b>flash</b> in sequence, usually at a speed of two consecutive sequences per second, beginning with the light most distant from the runway and ending at the Decision Bar. RAIL are similar to sequenced <b>flashing</b> <b>lights,</b> except that they end where the white approach light bars begin. Sequenced <b>flashing</b> <b>lights</b> and RAIL do not extend past the Decision Bar to avoid distracting the pilot during the critical phase of transitioning from instrument to visual flight. [...] Sequenced <b>flashing</b> <b>lights</b> are sometimes colloquially called the rabbit or the running rabbit.|$|R

40|$|In this work, {{a new way}} to {{fabricate}} nanoporous TiO 2 photoanode by <b>flash</b> <b>light</b> is demonstrated. TiO 2 nanoparticles are sintered on FTO glass by <b>flash</b> <b>light</b> irradiation at room temperature in ambient condition, which is dramatically simple, ultrahigh speed and one-shot large area fabrication process compared to a conventional high temperature (120 °C) thermal sintering process. The effect of the <b>flash</b> <b>light</b> conditions (<b>flash</b> <b>light</b> energy, pulse numbers and pulse duration) on the nanostructures of sintered TiO 2 layer, was studied and discussed using several microscopic and spectroscopic characterization techniques such as SEM, FT-IR, XRD and XPS. The sintered TiO 2 photoanodes by <b>flash</b> <b>light</b> were used in DSSC and its performance were compared with that of DSSC fabricated by conventional thermal sintering process. It was found that a <b>flash</b> <b>light</b> sintered TiO 2 photoanode has efficiency which {{is similar to that of}} the thermal sintered photoanode. It is expected that the newly developed <b>flash</b> <b>light</b> sintering technique of TiO 2 nanoparticles would be a strong alternative to realize the room temperature and in-situ sintering of photoanode fabrication for outdoor solar cell fabrication.

25|$|Then {{in early}} 1842 an {{intermittent}} (<b>flashing)</b> <b>light</b> replaced the fixed light, and a lightship was towed to a station of the Knobben, off Anholt.

This floating light operated from May to December.|$|E

25|$|Emergency {{services}} in Norway use mostly blue lighting. If a blue <b>flashing</b> <b>light</b> {{is seen in}} either traffic or the sea, other vehicles must yield to let that vehicle pass. Blue flashing lights are used by police, military police, customs, fire departments, rescue services, and ambulances. Government, VIP, and embassy vehicles may also use blue if accompanied by local police. Any vehicle equipped with a blue <b>flashing</b> <b>light</b> must have a permission issued by the DMV. The operator of such vehicle must be a qualified emergency vehicle operator and have a ‘code 160’ endorsement on their driver's license. Blue lights can be used alone or with an additional siren. The siren {{may not be used}} alone. The operator of an emergency vehicle may disregard speed limits and traffic lights with caution. Amber lights, however, are not regulated, but are used for any vehicle that need special attention, such as tow-trucks, snow plows, and parking enforcement. Red flashing lights are no longer in use, and were last used in the early 1960s.|$|E
25|$|Each Survivor {{can carry}} one each of five {{categories}} of equipment: primary weapons, secondary weapons, throwable weapons, major medical supplies (which also includes ammunition upgrades) and minor medical supplies. Primary weapons are {{broken down into}} four tiers based on their availability and attributes. Tier one weapons (such as the SMG and Chrome Shotgun) deal damage relatively slowly and serve as basic offensive weapons. Tier two weapons (such as the Assault Rifle and Combat Shotgun) deal damage faster and often appear in later maps of each chapter. The two tier three weapons (Grenade Launcher and M60) differ from tier one and two weapons both because of their rarity and because players cannot refill their ammunition from ammunition dumps. They deal damage quickly {{at the cost of}} limited ammo. Tier four weapons are all mounted weapon systems and carry unlimited ammunition. The mounted weapons deal damage the fastest, but at the cost of overheating after a period of non-stop use. The mounted weapons are in set positions in maps and have a fixed arc of fire. They cannot be given ammunition upgrades like other weapons and players cannot utilize the laser sights attachment with them. There are three types of secondary weapons available: melee weapons, small caliber pistols (that can be dual wielded) and large caliber pistols. Although melee weapons cause extra damage to Infected when struck, the Survivors can use any other weapon or item for weaker melee attacks that can push the Infected back. Players also carry a flashlight with infinite battery life, the use of which enables players to see in the dark (with the downside of the player gaining the attention of the Infected much faster). They may also carry a single first aid kit, special ammo pack, or a defibrillator in their major medical supply slot; in addition to either pain pills or an adrenaline shot in their minor medical supply slot. They may also carry a single throwable weapon—Molotov cocktails to set an area on fire; pipe bombs to attract any nearby Infected to the <b>flashing</b> <b>light</b> and sound it makes until it explodes; and jars of Boomer bile, which attracts Common Infected to whatever it hits (e.g. fires, Special Infected, each other).|$|E

500|$|In {{the second}} {{series of the}} show, the opening {{sequence}} consisted of a police car, a Rover SD1, racing down a street with its siren wailing and its blue <b>flashing</b> <b>light</b> on.
