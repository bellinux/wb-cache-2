Involvement in illegal resistance activity was a <b>decision</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> a minority of Belgians (approximately five percent of the population) but many more were involved in passive resistance. If captured, resistance members risked torture and execution, and around 17,000 were killed during the occupation.|$|E

The {{purpose of this study is}} to compare contribution <b>decisions</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> individuals with contribution <b>decisions</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> group representatives. We present the results from a laboratory experiment that compares <b>decisions</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> individuals in inter-individual public good games with <b>decisions</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> representatives on behalf of their group in inter-group public good games. Our main finding is that contribution behavior differs between individuals and group representatives, but only for women. While men’s choices are equally self-interested as individuals and group representatives, women make less self-interested choices as group representatives...|$|R

5|$|As the House of Councillors can veto a <b>{{decision}}</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> the House of Representatives, the House of Councillors {{can cause}} the House of Representatives to reconsider its decision. The House of Representatives however, can still insist on its decision by overwriting the veto by the House of Councillors with a two-thirds majority of its members present. Each year, and when required, the National Diet is convoked at the House of Councillors, {{on the advice of}} the Cabinet, for an extra or an ordinary session, by the Emperor. A short speech is, however, usually first made by the Speaker of the House of Representatives before the Emperor proceeds to convoke the Diet with his Speech from the throne.|$|E
5|$|As was customary, {{the treaty}} {{would have to}} be {{approved}} by the nobles and knights of both lands. The meeting between the nobility of Pomerelia and Greater Poland took place between 13–15 September 1284 in the town of Nakło, where they confirmed the rights of Przemysł II over Gdańsk Pomerania. The unification of Pomerelia and Greater Poland was not the only <b>decision</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> Przemysł II and Mestwin II. The favors shown by the Duke of Pomerelia to the powerful witnesses of the agreement from Greater Poland showed that they were also keenly interested in the close integration of the two lands.|$|E

However, if both houses still do not agree to each other, the <b>decision</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> the House of Representatives is deemed to be that of the National Diet. Upon designation, the Prime Minister is presented with their commission, and then formally appointed to office by the Emperor.|$|E

40|$|Procedural reasons, {{unlike other}} reasons for {{invalidity}} of <b>decisions</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> the Assembly in a Limited liability company (hereinafter:Ltd) in the judicial and business practice open up {{the highest number of}} legal questions. These are “mistakes in the steps” that lead to invalidity of <b>decisions</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> the Assembly in Ltd. about which in the domestic legal literature has not been systematically discussed. The starting point for the elaboration of this issue is based on the circumstance that in the provision of article 448 of the Companies Act is stipulated that to the invalidity of <b>decisions</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> the Assembly in Ltd. appropriately apply the provisions on the invalidity of <b>decisions</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> the General Assembly in PLC (Public Limited Company). Procedural differences in working of the General Assembly in PLC and Assembly in Ltd. is one of the fundamental differences between these two types of capital companies and this kind of positive legal regulation leads to legal uncertainty and misinterpretations. The first part of this paper gives a chronological overview of the domestic law with regard to invalidity of <b>decisions</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> the Assembly in Ltd. Then are doctrinally deferred invalid decisions from the other decisions with defect. Then, each provision on the invalidity of <b>decisions</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> the General Assembly in PLC is tested and then explicitly formulated provision which is valid only within the context of Ltd. Apart from domestic law are analyzed also solutions from comparative law (especially German) because domestic law largely overlaps with the solutions from comparative law. In conclusion after completion of analysis, the obtained findings are used as guidelines for more practical de lege ferenda regulation in the Companies Act regarding the invalidity of <b>decisions</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> the Assembly in Ltd...|$|R

5|$|In 2001, Millionaire {{producers}} {{began work}} on a half-hour daily syndicated version of the show, with the idea being that it would serve as an accompaniment to the network series which was still in production. ABC's cancellation of the network Millionaire ended that idea; however, the syndicated Millionaire still had enough interest to be greenlit and BVT sold the series to local stations for the 2002–03 season. The syndicated series nearly met the same fate as its predecessor, however, {{due in part to}} worries that stemmed from a <b>decision</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> one of its affiliates.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the presiding magistrate, several additional magistrates were often present to act as assistants. There were also religious officials known as augurs either in attendance or on-call, who {{would be available to}} help interpret any signs from the gods (omens). On several known occasions, presiding magistrates used the claim of unfavorable omens as an excuse to suspend a session that was not going the way they wanted. Any <b>decision</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> a presiding magistrate could be vetoed by a magistrate known as a Plebeian Tribune. In addition, decisions made by presiding magistrates could also be vetoed by higher-ranking magistrates.|$|E
5|$|A {{mandatory}} order is {{an order of}} the High Court commanding a public authority to perform a public duty, while a prohibiting order operates to prevent illegal action by an authority from occurring in the first place. A quashing order, the most commonly sought prerogative order, {{has the effect of}} invalidating an ultra vires <b>decision</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> an authority. Obtaining a mandatory, prohibiting or quashing order is a two-stage process, as an applicant must be granted leave by the Court to apply for the order. The Court must find the existence of a proper public law issue and available grounds of review. Leave will be granted provided that an arguable and prima facie case of reasonable suspicion that the authority has acted in breach of administrative law rules is established.|$|E

5|$|Parken Stadium was {{selected}} as the official ground of the final, after a <b>decision</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> the UEFA Executive Committee. It is located in the Indre Østerbro territory in Copenhagen; the site was once known as Idrætsparken, with the opening premiere held in 1911. It was the home of the Denmark national football team and Kjøbenhavns Boldklub's (KB) matches, until 1990, when the venue underwent reconstruction by the Danish lending company Baltica Finans A/S, with the former scrapped in favour of the new name, Parken Stadium. The concept was supported by the Danish Football Association with a contract that all of Denmark's national games would take place at the stadium for fifteen years. The price of the renovation was DKK640 million (£740 million). It made its debut two years later, in 1992, and has since then been the home base for F.C. Copenhagen's fixtures.|$|E
5|$|Several factors {{influenced}} the <b>decision</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> the Australian Government in October 1942 {{to recall the}} 9th Division to Australia. Most importantly, the Government and {{the commander of the}} Australian Military Forces, General Thomas Blamey, wanted to relieve the 6th and 7th Divisions from combat in the New Guinea Campaign and Blamey considered the 9th Division to be better prepared for this responsibility than the Australian Army's militia forces or US Army units. The commander of Allied forces in the South West Pacific Area, General Douglas MacArthur, had also been pressing the US and Australian Governments for reinforcements to conduct offensive operations against Japanese positions. Other factors influencing the Australian Government's decision were a desire to concentrate the Australian Army in a single theatre, the increasing difficulty in finding replacements for the 9th Division's casualties given the Army's manpower shortages, the political difficulties associated with implementing reforms to permit militia units to serve outside Australian territory, and concerns that a prolonged absence from Australia would affect morale among the 9th Division's soldiers.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the Royal Australian Regiment lie in the <b>decision</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> the Australian {{government}} to raise a force for occupation duties in Japan {{at the end of}} the Second World War. The 34th Australian Infantry Brigade was raised in October 1945 from Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF) personnel then serving in the South West Pacific Area, with the three battalions of the brigade designated as the 65th, 66th and 67th Australian Infantry Battalions of the AIF. The 65th Battalion was formed from volunteers from the 7th Division and the 2/40th Battalion. The 66th Battalion received volunteers from the 9th Division and 1st Australian Corps troops. The 67th Battalion was formed from the 3rd, 6th, and 11th Divisions. After concentrating on the island of Morotai, the 34th Brigade moved to Japan and joined the British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF) in February 1946.|$|E

5|$|This film {{marks the}} second {{adaptation}} of Shūsaku Endō's novel, which was previously adapted by Masahiro Shinoda into the 1971 {{film of the}} same name. Scorsese penned the initial screenplay in 1991 with co-writer and longtime collaborator Jay Cocks. However, they were unsatisfied with the script and conducted rewrites for an additional 15 years. Later, Endō's official translator, Van C. Gessel, who has translated eight of his novels, assisted as a consultant on the film. The screenplay as finally filmed was assessed in critical review as an accurate depiction of the novel as written by Endo.
