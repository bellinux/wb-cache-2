25|$|MD 199 was {{constructed}} as {{a gravel road}} along what was then known as Randle Station Road from US 50 (now MD 450) north to the Washington, Baltimore and Annapolis Electric Railway (now the namesake trail) in 1925 and 1926.

In 1965, MD 193 was extended east from the BaltimoreWashington Parkway in Greenbelt to the Glenn Dale level crossing of the Pennsylvania Railroad (now Amtrak Northeast Corridor), then south along Glenn Dale Road to MD 556 just north of US 50. The current curve just west of MD 953's southern terminus was added in 1983, replacing the piece of Glenn Dale Road that continues straight east but <b>dead</b> <b>ends</b> before MD 193.
