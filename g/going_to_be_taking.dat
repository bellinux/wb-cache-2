50|$|According {{to another}} story, {{the history of}} Odagaon {{is based on the}} Raghunath Temple. Before the {{permanent}} residence began in this place it was only the connecting way to Puri. One day some pilgrims discovered pictures of Lord Rama, Laxman and Devi Sita on three Neem trees while marching towards Puri. Within very few days this message traveled to all the nearest places and people started to come here. Then these people built a small temple for them and shaped those trees into the idols of Lord Rama, Laxman and Devi Sita. After this, people <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Puri <b>were</b> <b>taking</b> rest here and few priests stayed in the Temple as the servant of God. Then people started to visit this place as a religious place, so this initiated a small village around the temple. Today this area is known as the Village Odagaon. Later {{with the help of the}} Nayagarh King the present temple structure was built and also one Dharmashala (Guest house) was built near this temple for temporary stay of the pilgrims.|$|R
40|$|The {{transient}} effects {{during the}} start up process of a solar field {{play an important}} role for its overall performance. With the combination of sophisticated collector models and transient calculations in EBSILON®Professional, it will <b>be</b> possible <b>to</b> optimize the individual systems of a CSP-plant (thermal storage system, supplementary firing, collector field and power block) and to select the right control strategy for the system. In a first application, the new functionality <b>is</b> applied <b>to</b> the start-up procedure of a parabolic trough power plant with molten salt as heat transfer fluid. Results show that the process can be well represented by the model. Based on the generated reference start-up strategy improved strategies <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> identified. <b>Taking</b> into account the transient effects of start up processes and fluctuations caused by weather conditions can also improve or verify the performance models nowadays used for annual return calculations. There are a number of issues <b>to</b> <b>be</b> solved in the near future to enable fully transient simulation capabilities. One constant heat transfer coefficient for the whole length of the tube could be replaced by a vector of automatically calculated coefficients, based on the Reynolds and Prandtl Number of each fluid element. The lack of PID-type controllers in EBSILON®Professional makes it for now very complicated to apply control strategies to the transient model...|$|R

30|$|The {{precision}} {{of the two}} classifiers on the two classes are reasonably high; that is, {{the majority of the}} predictions for either of the two classes turn out <b>to</b> <b>be</b> correct. As for recall, while most (96.73  % for W-PART and 91.84  % for J 48) of the constraints that turn out <b>to</b> <b>be</b> satisfied are predicted correctly, only a small percentage (21.88  % for W-PART and 31.25  % for J 48) of violated cases are identified correctly. In other words, assuming that the violation and satisfaction of a constraint correspond to a positive and negative signal correspondingly, the classifiers exhibit low false positive rates and high false negative rates. One can achieve a different trade-off between false positive and false negative by changing the relative importance of correct prediction of violation or satisfaction of a constraint through using a cost matrix when training the classifiers. If the predictor <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used for <b>taking</b> preventive actions, then, perhaps a high false negative rate (the current situation) is better than a high false positive rate as the chance of disrupting well-performing students would be lower.|$|R
40|$|Open {{peer review}} has the {{potential}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> applied <b>to</b> all types of research results, from journal articles to project proposals and datasets. However, starting from its definition, criteria and procedures to assure a transparent and efficient evaluation are still debated. This discussion {{is embedded in the}} context of Open Science fulfilling the requirements of analysing structural and technological changes in the current scientific communication system. It is in this context that the Mertonian principles, in particular the ones connected with communality and organized scepticism, become important point of reference. Considering these issues, this paper intends to explore the applicability of (open) peer review to datasets produced and shared in Social Sciences. This study is part of OpenUp (OPENing UP new methods, indicators and tools for peer review, dissemination of research results, and impact measurement), a European funded project that addresses the currently transforming science landscape and aims (1) to identify ground-breaking mechanisms, processes and tools for peer-review for all types of research results (e. g., publications, data, software), (2) to explore innovative dissemination mechanisms with an outreach aim towards businesses and industry, education, and society as a whole, and (3) to analyse a set of novel indicators (i. e. altmetric) that assess the impact of research results and correlate them to channels of dissemination Since OpenUP employs a user-centered, evidence-based approach, its methodological approach not only engages all stakeholders (researchers, publishers, funders, institutions, industry, and the general public) in ad hoc workshops, conferences and training, but it also tests the achieved results in a set of seven pilots. They <b>are</b> related <b>to</b> the three project’s pillars (innovative peer review, dissemination and impact measuring) and <b>are</b> applied <b>to</b> specific research areas and communities: arts and humanities, social sciences, energy and life sciences. Within the overall objective of the project, this paper intends to provide the methodology used in developing the pilot that allows us to reconstruct the context of data sharing and evaluation in Social Sciences. Based on this analysis, the selection criteria of a research community <b>to</b> <b>be</b> involved in the pilot are identified together with the specific issues that <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> investigated <b>taking</b> into account both data providers and users perspectives. The analysis is carried out considering the Mertonian principles and in particular the issues connected to their applicability to the sharing and evaluation of research data...|$|R
40|$|The future {{challenges}} of air transport motivated the leading worldwide aviation research institutions to found IFAR - the International Forum for Aviation Research which aims at {{the development of}} a Road Map outlining worldwide research. Climate change is currently the most relevant topic and <b>was</b> the motivation <b>to</b> set up IFAR. However, IFAR also addresses other topics relevant for a global air transport system (e. g. noise, security, safety, efficient operations). IFAR connects and repre-sents worldwide aviation research and provides a common voice for their members in the interna-tional dialogue. IFAR interacts with the public, politics and industry, takes up the challenges identi-fied by them and acts as independent advisor to policy makers worldwide. The idea of IFAR was born at the Berlin Summit 2008 where key leaders of 12 international aeronautical research organi-sations met to address the question of the Air Transport of the Future in the context of climate change. In this regard, the participants agreed that any research and strategy contributing to new solutions will have to reconcile the increasing need for international mobility in a globalized work-sharing economy with the challenge of simultaneously developing new solutions to balance the climate effects of the accompanying world-wide air traffic growth. At the second Berlin Summit in 2010 16 international aeronautical research organisations met and eventually set up IFAR. The main objective of IFAR is {{the development of a}} Road Map agreed upon by research institutions worldwide. Within this Road Map promising technologies are identified which contribute to an im-proved Air Transport System. IFAR as research representative focuses on the identification of new technologies up to the development of TRL level 6. The IFAR members agreed at the Berlin Sum-mit 2010 to focus in 2010 / 2011 on the topics related to climate change and to present potential solutions for an ecologically and economically efficient air transport system. Within the next years this Road Map <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> extended by <b>taking</b> the other topics noise, safety, security and effi-cient operations into account. This paper deals with the objectives, state-of-the art and future planning of IFAR...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Frank’s sign is {{a crease}} in the earlobe, {{which has been}} {{correlated}} with heart disease by a mechanism of atherosclerosis and with its severity and also correlated with vascular risk factors. There are a few amount of studies that reported an association between this sign and the artery carotid intima media thickness (IMT) and only one that correlated it with stroke in general. Stroke {{is one of the}} leading causes of death worldwide and the first cause of long-term morbidity in our country, so it is important making efforts to study this pathology and how to detect it preciously. There are 5 subtypes of ischemic stroke with a different physiopathological mechanism each one. However, there are no studies that reported an association between Frank’s sign by subtypes of stroke. If Frank’s sign has been associated with an atherosclerosis diseases, the prevalence of this sign between atherotrombotic and lacunar stroke has <b>to</b> <b>be</b> higher as share the same physiopathological mechanism. Cryptogenic stroke has a lack of diagnoses in its underlying causes, the studies suggested that the main causes of them could be cardioembolism or atherotrombosis mechanisms, but the techniques that are used as routine impede the accurate diagnosis. As Frank’s sign <b>is</b> related <b>to</b> atherosclerosis, we think that Frank’s sign could help to define better the profile (atherotrombotic vs no aherotrombotic) of the patients of cryptogenic stroke to choose better some advanced diagnostic techniques in order to diagnose the real underlying cause of this subtype of stroke, and also orientate a better specific secondary preventive treatment to avoid recurrences. MAIN OBJECTIVES: The main aims of the study <b>is</b> <b>to</b> establish the prevalence of Frank’s sign in patients who suffered a stroke and, especially, to analyse the prevalence of Frank’s sign in each etiopathogenic subtype. We also will study specially the prevalence of Frank’s sing in patients with cryptogenic stroke, correlating it with the presence or absence of clinical and radiological markers to support a causal atherothrombotic or cardioembolic profile. METHODE: This protocol is a descriptive cross-sectional study to see the prevalence of Frank’s sign in the different subtypes of ischemic stroke, and describe the clinic features in those who have a cryptogenic stroke to reach the main objectives of our study. The study will include 265 patients, 53 of each of the 5 subtype of stroke, that have been hospitalized at Stroke Unit after suffering a stroke. Recruitment of participants will last 4 months. The Frank’s sign evaluation <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done by <b>taking</b> photos of the both ears of the patients in a blinded way by all the research tea...|$|R
