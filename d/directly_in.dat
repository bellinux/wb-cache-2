30|$|Apart from {{shifts in}} ranking {{positions}} for Italy and Portugal {{relative to other}} countries, both experienced substantial changes in volumes of C&T-value added and C&T-labor <b>directly</b> embodied <b>in</b> C&T-trade flows. As {{can be seen from}} Table  2, for both countries the direction of changes in absolute trade volumes was almost the same: Volumes of C&T-value added and C&T-labor <b>directly</b> embodied <b>in</b> domestically and internationally traded C&T-goods dropped, apart from two exceptions. C&T-value added <b>directly</b> embodied <b>in</b> both countries’ final demand C&T-inflows and Italian C&T-labor <b>directly</b> embodied <b>in</b> final demand C&T-inflows experienced an increase.|$|R

30|$|With {{respect to}} C&T-labor <b>directly</b> {{embodied}} <b>in</b> internationally traded C&T-goods, bilateral trade between Portugal and Central Europe constituted {{for the most}} intense trade relation in both directions in 1995. Different from that, for Italy only the largest fraction of C&T-labor <b>directly</b> embodied <b>in</b> C&T-exports in 1995 and 2009 was destined to Central Europe, whereas already in 1995 the largest volume of Italian C&T-labor <b>directly</b> embodied <b>in</b> C&T-imports came from China and India. For Portugal the situation evolved into the same direction: By 2009 Central Europe was no longer its most important import source but this was overtaken by China and India; also the volume of C&T-labor <b>directly</b> embodied <b>in</b> C&T-imports from China and India increased for both countries (see Appendix 3 : Table 9).|$|R

At issue was the right of Charles's daughter, Maria Theresa, to succeed to his Austrian dominions.

5|$|In {{addition}} to protein- and solution-mediated processes, {{it is also}} possible for lipid bilayers to participate <b>directly</b> <b>in</b> signaling. A classic example of this is phosphatidylserine-triggered phagocytosis. Normally, phosphatidylserine is asymmetrically distributed in the cell membrane and is present only on the interior side. During programmed cell death a protein called a scramblase equilibrates this distribution, displaying phosphatidylserine on the extracellular bilayer face. The presence of phosphatidylserine then triggers phagocytosis to remove the dead or dying cell.|$|E
