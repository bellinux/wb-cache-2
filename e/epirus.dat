5|$|The {{expedition}} {{into the}} Peloponnese {{was a disaster}} for Epiriote ambitions. Although Helenus was permitted by Antigonus {{to return to his}} homeland with the remainder of his army, <b>Epirus</b> ceased to be a regional power. Pyrrhus' son and successor, Alexander II of <b>Epirus</b> was granted generous terms by the Macedonian king. <b>Epirus</b> was able to keep Pyrrhus' conquests of Tymphaea, Parauaea and Atintania in western Macedon. Antigonus realised that an independent <b>Epirus</b> was essential in order to act as a buffer against the Illyrians to the north.|$|E
5|$|Around 1210, Theodore {{was invited}} by his {{half-brother}} Michael I Komnenos Doukas to <b>Epirus,</b> where Michael had founded an independent Greek principality. Michael wanted Theodore's aid, as his only son, the future Michael II Komnenos Doukas, was underage and illegitimate, while Michael's other half-brothers {{were considered to}} lack the ability to rule. Laskaris allowed Theodore to leave, but bound him with an oath of allegiance to himself and his heirs. Before going to <b>Epirus,</b> Theodore had married Maria Petraliphaina, {{with whom he had}} four children.|$|E
5|$|At this point, the Greeks of Laconia and Arcadia, {{under the}} {{leadership}} of a certain Michael, tried to stop the Franks at the olive grove of Kountouras in northeastern Messenia. Modern scholars have traditionally identified this Michael with Michael I Komnenos Doukas, founder of the Despotate of <b>Epirus,</b> but this identification has been questioned more recently by Raymond-Joseph Loenertz, as the fragile nature of his control over <b>Epirus</b> would have made a departure to aid the Moreote Greeks a major and unlikely gamble.|$|E
5|$|Michael's domain in <b>Epirus</b> {{became a}} refuge and centre of {{resistance}} of the Greeks against the Latin Crusaders. At about the same time, according to some modern scholars, he may have led the abortive Greek resistance to the Crusaders in the Peloponnese, which was crushed at the Battle of the Olive Grove of Kountouras; according to other views, he may have led a campaign there between 1207 and 1209. In order to avoid invasion and buy time to consolidate his position in <b>Epirus,</b> Michael soon entered into negotiations with Pope Innocent III, and concluded treaties with the Latin Empire and the Republic of Venice. In the meantime, his rule received a boost in legitimacy when he ransomed the deposed Alexios III from captivity. According to later chroniclers, Alexios III conferred the hereditary rule of <b>Epirus</b> to Michael and his descendants.|$|E
5|$|On February 28, 1914, the Autonomous Republic of Northern <b>Epirus</b> was {{declared}} in Gjirokastër and the provisional Government {{was formed to}} support the state's objectives. The Protocol of Corfu was signed on May 17, 1914 and the Albanian Government officially recognized the area of Northern <b>Epirus</b> as an autonomous region within the Albanian state. Soon after the outbreak of World War I (July 1914), the situation in Albania became unstable and political chaos ensued. As the country split {{into a number of}} regional governments, Prince William departed the country in September 1914.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} {{outbreak}} of World War I (July 1914), the situation in Albania became unstable and political chaos ensued. When the country became split {{into a number of}} regional governments, Prince William departed the country in September 1914. On 27 October, after approval from the Great Powers, the Greek army re-entered Northern <b>Epirus.</b> The Provisional Government of Northern <b>Epirus</b> formally ceased to exist, declaring that it had accomplished its objectives. The region was de facto annexed to Greece until the second half of 1916, when Italian troops evicted the Greek army from the area.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 1870s, Greece kept {{pressure}} on the Ottoman Empire, seeking territorial expansion into <b>Epirus</b> and Thessaly. The Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878 provided the first potential alliance for the Greek kingdom. George's sister Dagmar was the daughter-in-law of Alexander II of Russia, and she sought to have Greece join the war. The French and British refused to countenance such an act, and Greece remained neutral. At the Congress of Berlin convened in 1878 to determine peace terms for the Russo-Turkish War, Greece staked a claim to Crete, <b>Epirus</b> and Thessaly.|$|E
5|$|As {{the main}} war effort of Greece was {{initially}} turned towards Macedonia, on the <b>Epirus</b> front the Greek army was outnumbered by the Ottoman Yanya Corps at {{the outbreak of}} hostilities in October 1912. After stopping an initial attack by the Ottoman commander Esat Pasha at Gribovo, however, the Greeks succeeded in liberating Preveza (October 21) and pushing north {{in the direction of}} Ioannina, repulsing an Ottoman attack at Pente Pigadia (Beshpinar). On November 5, a small force from Corfu made a landing and captured the coastal area of Himarë without facing significant resistance, and on December 20 Greek troops improved their positions in <b>Epirus</b> and entered Korçë, north of Ioannina, thus cutting off its last supply route and threatening the city's northeastern flank.|$|E
5|$|He was {{appointed}} as the auxiliary bishop of Kuala Lumpur and titular bishop of Chunavia on 1 April 1995, and ordained titular bishop of Chunavia, <b>Epirus</b> Nova, {{known as an}} Episcopal Ordination, on 4 October 1995 at the College General in Penang.|$|E
5|$|In September 1913, an International Commission of the European Powers convened to {{determine}} the boundary between Greece and Albania. The delegates of the commission aligned themselves into two camps: those of Italy and Austro-Hungary insisted that the Northern <b>Epirus</b> districts were Albanian, while those of the Triple Entente (the United Kingdom, France, and Russia) took the view that although the older generations in some villages spoke Albanian, the younger generation was Greek in intellectual outlook, sentiment, and aspirations. Under Italian and Austro-Hungarian pressure, the commission determined that the region of Northern <b>Epirus</b> would be ceded to Albania.|$|E
5|$|Michael II Komnenos Doukas, {{an illegitimate}} son who succeeded as ruler of <b>Epirus</b> in 1230 {{until his death}} ca. 1268. He is the first Epirote ruler to have borne the title of despotes.|$|E
5|$|Since {{incorporation}} into Greece {{was not an}} option after the recent political developments, Zografos proposed three main solutions to the representatives of the International Commission: complete autonomy under the sovereignty of the Albanian prince, administrative and canton type autonomy, and direct administration and control by the European Powers. The Northern Epirote side also demanded the extension of the area in which the Greek population would enjoy education in its native language to include the regions around Vlorë and Durrës (in central Albania, to the north of Northern <b>Epirus),</b> the appointment of Greek Orthodox higher officials in the main towns of Northern <b>Epirus</b> and the exemption from military service of the local population, even in time of war.|$|E
5|$|The Protocol {{fulfilled}} the main {{demands of the}} Northern Epirote side. According to its terms, the two provinces of Korytsa and Argyrokastron, which constituted Northern <b>Epirus,</b> would become autonomous under Albanian sovereignty and {{under the auspices of}} Prince William of Wied; he, however, was granted no effective power whatsoever.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} Michael's {{establishment}} in <b>Epirus</b> is obscure. The hagiography of St. Theodora of Arta, {{written in the}} late 13th century, maintains that Alexios III had appointed Michael as governor in the Peloponnese and a certain Senachereim, who was Michael's relative by marriage (they both had married first cousins from the Melissenos family), as governor of the Theme of Nicopolis in <b>Epirus.</b> When the local inhabitants rose in revolt against him, Senachereim called upon Michael for aid. Michael rushed to Nicopolis, but not before the locals had killed Senachereim. After that, Michael, himself widowed, took Senachereim's widow as his wife and succeeded him as governor. Although generally regarded as inaccurate due to the many errors it contains, {{this part of the}} hagiography is at least partially corroborated by Villehardouin's account that he married the daughter of a local magnate. It is certain that Michael was never appointed governor of the Peloponnese, but the hagiography's reference to the peninsula has led to suggestions by modern scholars that he is to be identified with the Michael who led the Peloponnesian Greeks in the Battle of the Olive Grove of Kountouras against the Crusaders, in the summer of 1205. This commonly held identification has been questioned by more recent research by the historian Raymond-Joseph Loenertz, who suggests that Michael leaving <b>Epirus,</b> which still was not securely under his control, to go on campaign in the Peloponnese would have been extremely unlikely as it would leave <b>Epirus</b> open to attack by Boniface. Loenertz does however consider that Michael may indeed have led another expedition into the Peloponnese a few years later, in 1207–09 (see below).|$|E
5|$|When Michael II died in c. 1268, however, his realm was divided, with Nikephoros {{receiving}} the metropolitan territories of <b>Epirus</b> proper and John {{taking over the}} Epirote domains in Thessaly and Central Greece. According to Gregoras, his realm extended from Mount Olympus in the north to Parnassus in the south, with the Achelous River serving as his border with <b>Epirus</b> proper; his capital was at Neopatras. Michael VIII seized {{the opportunity for a}} rapprochement with the two brothers. He gave Nikephoros his niece Anna in marriage, and arranged a marriage between his nephew Andronikos Tarchaneiotes and a daughter of John, who in addition received the high title of sebastokratōr.|$|E
5|$|After his {{election}} by the League of Corinth as their commander-in-chief (strategos autokrator) of a forthcoming campaign {{to invade the}} Achaemenid Empire, Philip II sought to shore up further Macedonian support by marrying Cleopatra Eurydice, niece of general Attalus. Yet talk of providing new potential heirs infuriated Philip II's son Alexander (already {{a veteran of the}} Battle of Chaeronea) and his mother Olympias, who fled together to <b>Epirus</b> before Alexander was recalled to Pella. Further tensions arose when Philip II offered his son Arrhidaeus's hand in marriage to Ada of Caria, daughter of Pixodarus, the Persian satrap of Caria. When Alexander intervened and proposed to marry Ada instead, Philip cancelled the wedding arrangements altogether and exiled Alexander's advisors Ptolemy, Nearchus, and Harpalus. To reconcile with Olympias, Philip II had their daughter Cleopatra marry Olympias' brother (and Cleopatra's uncle) Alexander I of <b>Epirus,</b> yet Philip II was assassinated by his bodyguard Pausanias of Orestis during their wedding feast and succeeded by Alexander.|$|E
5|$|After {{the sack}} of Constantinople in 1204 by Latin crusaders, two Byzantine {{successor}} states were established: the Empire of Nicaea, and the Despotate of <b>Epirus.</b> A third, the Empire of Trebizond, {{was created by}} Alexios I of Trebizond {{a few weeks before}} the sack of Constantinople. Of the three successor states, <b>Epirus</b> and Nicaea stood the best chance of reclaiming Constantinople. The Nicaean Empire struggled to survive the next few decades, however, and by the mid-13th century it had lost much of southern Anatolia. The weakening of the Sultanate of Rûm following the Mongol invasion in 1242–43 allowed many beyliks and ghazis to set up their own principalities in Anatolia, weakening the Byzantine hold on Asia Minor. In time, one of the Beys, Osman I, created an empire that would eventually conquer Constantinople. However, the Mongol invasion also gave Nicaea a temporary respite from Seljuk attacks, allowing it to concentrate on the Latin Empire to its north.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Theodore Synadenos {{was rewarded}} by being made {{governor}} of Constantinople, Apokaukos became {{head of the}} imperial secretariat, Kantakouzenos remained Andronikos III's principal advisor as megas domestikos, and Syrgiannes was named governor of Thessalonica. Around 1330, Synadenos was sent as governor to Mesembria, while in 1336, after Andronikos III and John Kantakouzenos annexed <b>Epirus,</b> he became its governor. In late 1338, however, a revolt broke out in <b>Epirus</b> in favour of Nikephoros II Orsini, the last descendant of the Epirote ruling dynasty. Synadenos was taken captive in the capital, Arta by the rebels, and remained a prisoner until 1340, when Andronikos III and Kantakouzenos campaigned against the rebels and recovered the region. John Angelos, a relative of Kantakouzenos, was installed as the new governor, while Synadenos {{was moved to the}} governorship of Thessalonica.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the regency's {{alliance}} with Dušan was paying dividends for the Serbian ruler alone, {{as he had}} free rein to plunder and occupy all of Macedonia and <b>Epirus.</b> By the end of 1345, only Thessalonica, held by the Zealots, Serres and the surrounding region, which remained loyal to the regency, along with Berroia, which still held out under Manuel Kantakouzenos, remained outside Serbian control.|$|E
5|$|Following entreaties {{from the}} Greek polis of Tarentum in 281 BC, Pyrrhus, {{the king of}} <b>Epirus</b> in {{northern}} Greece, invaded Italy with an army of 25,500 and 20 war elephants. The aim of the expedition was to combat the aggression of the Roman Republic, which was increasingly annexing the Greek cities of Magna Graecia. Upon arriving in Italy in 280 BC, Pyrrhus assumed command of an army consisting of the Greeks of Magna Graecia. Adding these forces to his own from <b>Epirus,</b> he engaged and defeated the Roman army at the Battle of Heraclea, near Tarentum in 280 BC. The Epiriote victory caused a number of native {{groups such as the}} Samnites and the Lucanians, who were also fearful of Roman expansionism to join Pyrrhus. Subsequently, Pyrrhus advanced towards Rome and at the Battle of Asculum he vanquished another Roman army.|$|E
5|$|Following the battle, John {{accompanied}} the Nicaeans in their rapid {{occupation of the}} Epirote domains, but he quickly became alienated from them. He brought his own followers to Vonitsa, from where he contacted his father, who had taken refuge in the Ionian Islands. Michael accepted his son's apologies, and soon joined him on the mainland. Byzantine control over <b>Epirus</b> {{had not yet been}} consolidated, and father and son were quickly able to recapture the Epirote capital of Arta and then relieve the besieged city of Ioannina. Within a short time, the Nicaeans had been evicted from <b>Epirus.</b> John's half-brother Nikephoros was then sent in spring 1260 to recover Thessaly, which he mostly accomplished after defeating and capturing the Nicaean general Alexios Strategopoulos. Part of eastern Thessaly, however, around Demetrias, Velestino, Halmyros, and Pharsalos, remained in Nicaean hands for several years thereafter. Again, despite his association with Thessaly, John is not mentioned as playing a role in these events or in the administration of the Thessalian territories in the early 1260s, which seem rather to have been under the control of Nikephoros.|$|E
5|$|His {{regime was}} also hostile towards the country's {{immediate}} neighbours. Albania {{did not end}} its state of war with Greece, {{left over from the}} Second World War, until as late as 1987 – two years after Hoxha's death – due to suspicions about Greek territorial ambitions in southern Albania (known to Greeks as Northern <b>Epirus)</b> as well as Greece's status as a NATO member state.|$|E
5|$|In 1921 the Protocol of Corfu was annulled {{during the}} Conference of Ambassadors and Northern <b>Epirus</b> was {{definitively}} ceded to the Albanian state. However attempts to re-establish an autonomous Northern <b>Epirus</b> continued. In 1921 the Albanian government, during the country's {{entrance to the}} League of Nations, committed itself {{to protect the rights}} of minorities within its territory, which were ratified by the local Parliament next year. However, these rights were granted within a much more limited area compared to the Protocol, which included only some villages in the regions of Himara, Gjirokastër and Sarande, and none of the main towns. Moreover, Greek education was viewed as a potential threat to the territorial integrity of the Albanian state and Greek schools were either closed or converted to Albanian ones. As a result of this policy, education in Greek was limited and for a time virtually eliminated (1934–1935). Only after the intervention of the Permanent Court of International Justice, in April 1935, did the Albanian side allow the reopening of Greek-language schools and waive its insistence on the use of Albanian in Greek schools.|$|E
5|$|In 336 BC, whilst the {{invasion}} of Persia was in its very early stage, Philip was assassinated in Aegae by the captain of his bodyguard, Pausanias, whilst attending the wedding of his daughter by Olympias, Cleopatra, to Olympias's brother (and Cleopatra's uncle) Alexander I of <b>Epirus.</b> Philip's son Alexander III by Olympias was proclaimed king by the Macedonian army and by the Macedonian noblemen.|$|E
5|$|In summer 336BC, {{while at}} Aegae {{attending}} {{the wedding of}} his daughter Cleopatra to Olympias's brother, Alexander I of <b>Epirus,</b> Philip was assassinated by the captain of his bodyguards, Pausanias. As Pausanias tried to escape, he tripped over a vine and was killed by his pursuers, including two of Alexander's companions, Perdiccas and Leonnatus. Alexander was proclaimed king on the spot by the nobles and army {{at the age of}} 20.|$|E
5|$|Lefkada, {{part of the}} Despotate of <b>Epirus</b> {{since the}} latter's {{foundation}} in 1205, was incorporated by Leonardo I Tocco into the County of Cephalonia in 1362. The Despotate of <b>Epirus</b> {{was one of the}} three Byzantine Empires in exile created after the Fourth Crusade in 1204. Following the fate of the other central Ionian Islands, it was captured by the Turks in 1479 and then by the Venetians in 1502. However, Venetian rule did not last, as Lefkada was given back to the Ottoman Empire one year later. Turkish rule over Lefkada lasted for over 200 years, from 1479 to 1684, when Francesco Morosini attacked and subdued the island during the Morean War. Lefkada, however, did not become officially Venetian until 1718, with the signature of the Treaty of Passarowitz.|$|E
5|$|Like its {{predecessor}} Titan Quest, Immortal Throne is an action role-playing game where the player-created character navigates environments within the Ancient World: in Immortal Throne, the player begins by exploring locations like Rhodes and <b>Epirus,</b> {{before entering the}} Underworld and passing through supernatural locations such as the Styx and Elysium. Players progress through the story and different locations by completing quests from non-playable characters (NPCs) for various rewards, including money and experience points.|$|E
5|$|The Komnenoi {{also made}} a {{significant}} contribution to the history of Asia Minor. By reconquering much of the region, the Komnenoi set back the advance of the Turks in Anatolia by more than two centuries. In the process, they planted the foundations of the Byzantine successor states of Nicaea, <b>Epirus</b> and Trebizond. Meanwhile, their extensive programme of fortifications has left an enduring mark upon the Anatolian landscape, which can still be appreciated today.|$|E
5|$|The {{autonomy}} {{question remains}} on the diplomatic agenda in Albanian-Greek relations {{as part of the}} Northern Epirote issue. In 1925, Albania's borders were fixed by the Protocol of Florence, and the Kingdom of Greece abandoned all claims to Northern <b>Epirus.</b> In the 1960s, Soviet General Secretary Nikita Khrushchev asked his Albanian counterpart about giving autonomy to the Greek minority, with no results. In 1991, {{after the collapse of the}} communist regime in Albania, the chairman of Greek minority organization Omonoia called for autonomy for Northern <b>Epirus,</b> on the basis that the rights provided for under the Albanian constitution were highly precarious. This proposal was rejected, spurring the minority's radical wing to call for a union with Greece. Two years later, Omonoia’s chairman was arrested by the Albanian police after publicly stating that the Greek minority goal was the creation of an autonomous region inside the Albanian borders, based on the provisions of the Protocol of Corfu. In 1997, Albanian analysts stated that the possibility of a Greek minority-inspired breakaway Republic still exists.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the terms}} of the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 (the Venizelos-Tittoni agreement), Northern <b>Epirus</b> was to be awarded to Greece, but {{political}} developments such as the Greek defeat in the Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922) and strong Italian opposition in favor of Albania caused the area to be finally ceded to Albania in 1921.|$|E
5|$|When Philip II married Cleopatra Eurydice, niece {{of general}} Attalus, talk of {{providing}} new potential heirs {{at the wedding}} feast infuriated PhilipII's son Alexander, {{a veteran of the}} Battle of Chaeronea, and his mother Olympias. They fled together to <b>Epirus</b> before Alexander was recalled to Pella by PhilipII. When PhilipII arranged a marriage between his son Arrhidaeus and Ada of Caria, daughter of Pixodarus, the Persian satrap of Caria, Alexander intervened and proposed to marry Ada instead. PhilipII then cancelled the wedding altogether and exiled Alexander's advisors Ptolemy, Nearchus, and Harpalus. To reconcile with Olympias, PhilipII had their daughter Cleopatra marry Olympias' brother (and Cleopatra's uncle) AlexanderI of <b>Epirus,</b> but PhilipII was assassinated by his bodyguard, Pausanias of Orestis, during their wedding feast and succeeded by Alexander in 336BC.|$|E
5|$|When a {{diplomatic}} dispute between Rome and a Greek colony in Italy erupted into open warfare in a naval confrontation, the Greek colony appealed for {{military aid to}} Pyrrhus, ruler of the northwestern Greek kingdom of <b>Epirus.</b> Motivated by a personal desire for military accomplishment, Pyrrhus landed a Greek army of some 25,000 men on Italian soil in 280 BC.|$|E
5|$|After {{months of}} negotiation, John and the envoys from the Latin Empire signed a treaty in Perugia which was {{confirmed}} by Pope Gregory on 9 April 1229. John was elected emperor of the Latin Empire for life as senior co-ruler with Baldwin II, who would marry John's daughter Marie. The treaty also prescribed that although Baldwin would rule the Latin lands in Asia Minor when he was 20 years old, he would become sole emperor only after John's death. John also stipulated that his sons would inherit <b>Epirus</b> and Macedonia, but the two regions still belonged to Emperor of Thessalonica Theodore Doukas.|$|E
5|$|After this feat {{that earned}} him fame and glory, in 1262 Alexios was {{appointed}} again to lead an army against <b>Epirus.</b> Here, however, he was defeated and captured by Nikephoros Doukas, who {{sent him to}} Manfred in Italy. He was ransomed in 1265 in exchange for Constance II of Hohenstaufen, widow of John Vatatzes. He is last mentioned in a document from December 1270 in which he made a donation to the Makrinitissa Monastery near Volos, and died sometime between 1271 and 1275, probably at Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|Alexander fled Macedon {{with his}} mother, {{dropping}} her {{off with her}} brother, King Alexander I of <b>Epirus</b> in Dodona, capital of the Molossians. He continued to Illyria, where he sought refuge with the Illyrian king and {{was treated as a}} guest, despite having defeated them in battle a few years before. However, it appears Philip never intended to disown his politically and militarily trained son. Accordingly, Alexander returned to Macedon after six months due to the efforts of a family friend, Demaratus, who mediated between the two parties.|$|E
5|$|Alexander {{was born}} on the sixth day of the ancient Greek month of Hekatombaion, which {{probably}} corresponds to 20July 356 BC, although the exact date is disputed, in Pella, {{the capital of the}} Kingdom of Macedon. He was the son of the king of Macedon, Philip II, and his fourth wife, Olympias, the daughter of Neoptolemus I, king of <b>Epirus.</b> Although Philip had seven or eight wives, Olympias was his principal wife for some time, likely because she gave birth to Alexander.|$|E
