40|$|To {{improve the}} {{dissolution}} behavior of lipophilic drugs, a novel bottom-up process based upon freeze drying {{which allows for}} the production of nanocrystalline particles was developed: "controlled crystallization during freeze drying". This novel process could strongly increase the dissolution behavior of fenofibrate. For example at a drug load of 30 % w/w, 80 % of the drug dissolved within 10 min from tablets prepared from the controlled crystallized dispersions, while from tablets prepared from the physical mixture only 50 % was dissolved after 120 min. Furthermore it was found that <b>faster</b> <b>freezing</b> or using a solution with a lower water/tertiary butyl alcohol (TBA) ratio resulted in faster dissolution, indicating that the crystalline dispersions contained smaller crystals. Crystallization of the drug could occur during freezing or during drying. When crystallization occurs during <b>freezing,</b> <b>faster</b> <b>freezing</b> or using solutions with a lower water/TBA ratio results in the formation of more nuclei and consequently smaller crystals. When crystallization occurs during drying, <b>faster</b> <b>freezing</b> or using solutions with a higher water/TBA ratio results in the formation of smaller solvent crystals and therefore smaller interstitial spaces which contain the freeze-concentrated fraction. Since crystallization occurs in the freeze-concentrated fraction {{and the size of the}} crystals are limited to the size of the interstitial spaces, smaller crystals are formed in these situations.

40|$|Background: Intralesional (IL) {{cryotherapy}} is a {{new technique}} {{for the treatment of}} keloid scars, in which the scar is frozen from inside. Two cryodevices are available, which were recently evaluated. Both devices showed promising results, but differed in clinical outcome. To explain these differences, more understanding of the working mechanism of both devices is required. Objective: This experimental study was designed to investigate and compare the thermal behavior of an argon gas- and a liquid nitrogen-based device. Thermal behavior constitutes: (1) minimum tissue temperature (°C), (2) the freezing rate (°C/min). The thermal behavior was measured inside and on the outer surface of the scar. Both devices were tested ex vivo and in vivo. Results: Ex vivo, when determining the maximum freezing capacity, the argon gas device showed a higher end temperature compared to the liquid nitrogen device (argon gas: - 120. °C, liquid nitrogen: - 140. °C) and a <b>faster</b> <b>freezing</b> rate (argon gas: - 1300. °C/min, liquid nitrogen: - 145. °C/min). In vivo, measured inside the keloid, the argon gas device showed a lower end temperature than the liquid nitrogen device (argon gas: - 36. 4. °C, liquid nitrogen: - 8. 1. °C) and a <b>faster</b> <b>freezing</b> rate (argon gas: - 14. 7. °C/min, liquid nitrogen: - 5. °C/min). The outer surface of the scar reached temperatures below - 20. °C with both devices as measured with the thermal camera. Conclusion: In conclusion, the argon gas device displayed a lower end temperature and a <b>faster</b> <b>freezing</b> rate in vivo compared to the liquid nitrogen device. Although this resulted in lower recurrence rates for the argon gas device, more hypopigmentation was seen compared to the liquid nitrogen device following treatment. Finally, the low outer surface temperatures measured with both devices, suggest that some hypopigmentation following treatment is inevitable...|$|R

50|$|The {{speed of}} the {{freezing}} has {{a direct impact on}} the size and the number of ice crystals formed within a food product's cells and extracellular space.

Large ice crystals can puncture the walls of the cells of the food product which will cause a degradation of the texture of the product as well as the loss of its natural juices during thawing. That is why there will be a qualitative difference observed between food products frozen by ventilated mechanical freezing, non-ventilated mechanical freezing or cryogenic freezing with liquid nitrogen.|$|E

In -40 °C weather, he discovered that the fish he caught froze almost instantly, and, when thawed, tasted fresh.

As the Maryland Historical Society noted in a blog posting, The Velvet Kind: The Sweet Story of Hendlers Creamery, [...] "The ice cream was virtually everywhere in Maryland, as it was distributed to over 400 stores at the company’s peak, which kept the production lines humming. The factory ran six days a week with vanilla ice cream being made almost everyday.

Hutzler's department store sold several varieties, including ginger and peppermint. For the Southern Hotel, [...] Hendlers supplied a tomato sorbet which was served as a side dish rather than dessert. The eggnog ice cream was produced each year at Christmas time. Hendler made with real rum, was a major hit.
