50|$|There are {{two basic}} {{physical}} mechanisms at play with the potential of injury to intra-abdominal organs — compression and deceleration. The former occurs from a direct blow, such as a punch, or compression against a non-yielding object such as a seat belt or steering column.This force may deform a hollow organ thereby increasing its <b>intra-luminal</b> or internal pressure, leading to rupture. Deceleration, on the other hand, causes stretching and shearing at the points at which mobile structures, such as the bowel, are anchored. This can cause tearing of the mesentery of the bowel, and injury to the blood vessels that travel within the mesentery. Classic examples of these mechanisms are a hepatic tear along the ligamentum teres and injuries to the renal arteries.|$|E

Of the 1000 patients who underwent Nissen-Rossetti fundoplication in our Division since 1972, the laparoscopic approach was adopted in 428 consecutive patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. The study population consisted of patients from this group with one-year follow-up. Thirty-one patients had undergone pre-operative evaluation with pH-multi-channel <b>intra-luminal</b> impedance and were classified on the basis of clinical assessment into gastro-oesophageal, or pharyngeal reflux disease group. Pre-operative data are reported. Comparison between gastro-oesophageal reflux and pharyngeal reflux are extrapolated from pH-multi-channel <b>intra-luminal</b> impedance. No conversion to open surgery and no mortality occurred. A major complication occurred in 4 patients (1. 1 %) and led to a re-intervention in 3. An excellent outcome was reported in 92. 9 % of the patients at mean follow-up of 83. 2 ± 7 months. Instrumental outcomes are discussed. In conclusion, Nissen-Rossetti fundoplication provides excellent protection from gastro-oesophgeal and pharyngeal reflux.

40|$|<b>Intra-luminal</b> {{fluid and}} {{excessive}} abnormal hyper-edema are regularly {{used for the}} diagnosis of endometritis in the mare, which is routinely confirmed {{by the presence of}} neutrophils on endometrial smears.

This enzyme has been found in many fluids and tissues and associated with different inflammatory pathologies in the horse. The aims of this study were to assess the presence and concentration of MPO in the equine uterus, and to investigate its relation with neutrophils, and other clinical signs of endometritis.

Doctor’s dissertation. ISSN 1401 - 6257, ISBN 91 - 576 - 6375 - 0. During sperm transport {{in the female}} pig a proportion of spermatozoa are arrested, often for 24 h or more, in a particular segment of the utero-tubal junction (UTJ) and the adjacent tubal isthmus, where a sperm reservoir (SR) is built up. The SR maintains, via its lining epithelium and the fluid it produces, sperm viability pre-ovulation. It also controls the release of potentially fertilising spermatozoa so {{that only a small}} sub-population reaches the site of fertilisation, thus diminishing the risk of polyspermy. In vitro research has focused on sperm binding as the main mechanism of sperm storage, sperm release and modulation of capacitation, but little attention has hitherto been paid to the isthmic oviductal fluid (IOF), its composition and the control of capacitation in vivo.

In the first portion of the work, one of the smooth-muscle tissues reported in the open literature is critically assessed. Then, the model is calibrated using experimental data published in the open literature, for isometric (constant length) and isotonic (constant holding stress) uniaxial-tensile-tests of swine carotid artery. Predictions of this model under uniaxial loading conditions are then investigated and their physical soundness is established. Next, the model is implemented into a user-material subroutine which enables, under general deformation conditions, determination of the spatial distribution and temporal evolution of the material stress state and material state-variables. Lastly, the user-material subroutine is linked with a commercial finite-element program and used to analyze a simple smooth-muscle contractile problem involving: (a) a tubular structure surrounded with smooth-muscle tissue (with muscle-cell longitudinal directions aligned in the tube circumferential direction); and (b) an <b>intra-luminal</b> content {{in the form of}} a prolate spheroidal, the major axis of which coincides with the tube axis.

40|$|Introduction: Small bowel {{obstruction}} in {{a virgin}} abdomen is an uncommon surgical condition. While malignancy, {{inflammatory bowel disease}} and foreign body are the main reported causes, undigested food bezoar causing bowel obstruction is a rare entity. We report a case of small bowel obstruction secondary to dried preserved apple having re-expanded within the gastrointestinal tract. Presentation of case: A 69 year old male presented with severe abdominal distension, generalized abdominal tenderness and obstipation for 1 week. Small bowel obstruction (SBO) was confirmed on plain abdominal X-ray and CT imaging. An emergency explorative laparatomy identified a sausage-shaped <b>intra-luminal</b> foreign body obstructing the distal ileum. An enterotomy was performed which revealed a rehydrated, donut-shaped piece of dried apple. Discussion: Swallowed items that pass through the pylorus rarely cause obstruction as they are usually small enough {{to pass through the}} rest of the bowel without difficulty. We postulate that in our patient that the dried apple was originally small enough to pass through the pylorus. However during small bowel, its’ highly absorbable nature resulted in an increase in size that prevented its’ passage through the ileocecal valve. A simple in-vitro experiment discovered that dried apple has a potential to reabsorb fluid and expand up to 35 % of its initial size within 72  h. Conclusion: This report illustrates the potential for dried food substances to cause <b>intra-luminal</b> SBO after significant expansion with rehydration...|$|E

The ultrasound (Fig. 1) and subsequent abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan (Fig. 2 a,b) made during the present visit to the emergency department, with his pain still present, depict two <b>intra-luminal</b> foreign bodies.

The indigestible food fibres form a mass and finally an obstructive ileus. Diagnosis is usually made by CT scan or ultrasound. Conservative treatment modalities described are endoscopic removal, pulverizing the bezoar with YAG laser therapy or extra-corporal shock wave lithotripsy, or chemical dissolution of the bezoar with for instance cellulase or Coca-Cola [2, 3].

Firstly, to assess the reproducibility of a computer tomography (CT) -based technique for measurement of aortic thrombus volume. Secondly, to examine the determinants of infrarenal aortic thrombus volume in a cohort of patients with aortic dilatation. A consecutive series of 75 patients assessed by CT angiography with maximum aortic diameter ≥ 25 mm were recruited. <b>Intra-luminal</b> thrombus volume was measured by a semi-automated workstation protocol based on a previously defined technique to quantitate aortic calcification. Intra- and inter-observer reproducibility were assessed using correlation coefficients, coefficient of variation and Bland-Altman plots. Infrarenal aortic thrombus volume percentage was related to clinical, anatomical and blood characteristics of the patients using univariate and multivariate tests. Infrarenal aortic thrombus volume was related to the severity of aortic dilatation assessed by total aortic volume (r[*]=[*] 0. 87, P[*]<[*] 0. 0001) or maximum aortic diameter (r[*]=[*] 0. 74, P[*]<[*] 0. 0001). We therefore examined the clinical determinates of aortic thrombus expressed as a percentage of total aortic volume. Aortic thrombus percentage was negatively correlated with serum high density lipoprotein (HDL, r[*]=[*]- 0. 31).

This is the first report of a giant diverticulum {{of the colon}} with a co-existing rectal carcinoma. Case presentation We report {{a case of a}} 66 -year-old Caucasian woman who presented with lower abdominal pain, chronic constipation and abdominal swelling.

An en bloc anterior resection of the rectum along with sigmoid colectomy, partial hysterectomy and right salpingoophorectomy was subsequently performed due to extensive adhesions. Conclusion This report shows that the presence of a co-existing distal colorectal cancer can potentially lead to progressive development of a colonic diverticulum to become a giant diverticulum by increasing colonic <b>intra-luminal</b> pressure and through the ball-valve mechanism.
