25|$|The Eagle design sold {{in large}} numbers, but {{suffered}} many wing failures {{that resulted in}} several fatalities {{as a result of}} the deterioration of the unreinforced Dacron sailcloth trailing <b>edge</b> <b>design.</b> The lawsuits, {{as a result of the}} design defects, put the company out of business in about 1984, just as the market for ultralight aircraft in the United States collapsed.|$|E
25|$|Forced to race, {{and lacking}} time for preparation, Conner and SDYC {{looked for a}} way to prevail. They {{recognized}} that a catamaran was not expressly prohibited under the rules. Multihulls, due to a lower wetted surface area and vastly lower mass, are inherently faster than equal-length monohulls. Conner, however, left nothing to chance and commissioned a cutting <b>edge</b> <b>design</b> with a wing sail, named—as his 12-metre yachts had been—Stars and Stripes.|$|E
25|$|The {{remaining}} DH.110 were grounded {{until the}} cause of the break-up was determined to be a structural failure due to a faulty wing leading <b>edge</b> <b>design.</b> The DH.110 eventually entered service with the Royal Navy as the de Havilland Sea Vixen after modifications to the design. Strict safety procedures were subsequently enacted for UK air shows and there were no further spectator fatalities until the 2015 Shoreham Airshow crash in which 11 people died.|$|E

25|$|Other {{highlights}} for 1971 {{included a}} wrap-around instrument panel shared with Ninety-Eight and Toronado models (Toronados had a slightly smoother upper leading <b>edge</b> <b>design)</b> that was highlighted {{by a large}} square speedometer and all controls within easy reach of the driver, and a one-year only Flo-Through ventilation system that utilized vents in the trunklid. The system used on all GM B-, C- and E-body cars and the Chevrolet Vega, used the heater fan to draw air into the car from the cowl intake, and force it out through vents in the trunk lid or tailgate. In theory, passengers could enjoy fresh air even when the car was moving slowly or stopped, as in heavy traffic. In practice, however, it didn't work.|$|E
25|$|For the 1998–99 season, the Kings {{unveiled}} new logos, {{uniforms and}} color scheme, restoring the purple – albeit a lighter shade compared to Forum Blue – as grey and black had become associated with gang colors. The new primary logo was a shield and crest featuring three royal symbols, a lion, a crown and the Sun. The jerseys featured the shield logo with hints of purple on the yoke, sleeve stripes and tail. By coincidence, {{this was the}} same color scheme as the NBA's Sacramento team which is also called the Kings. The bottom of the jerseys read the city name. A purple alternate jersey featuring the updated secondary crown logo was unveiled for the 1999–2000 season. In 2002, the crown logo became the primary while the shield logo was demoted to alternate status. The socks on the black and purple uniforms also switched designations to match their counterparts. Upon moving to the Reebok <b>Edge</b> <b>design</b> in 2007, the jerseys were updated without the tail stripes. The purple-tinged road jerseys were used until the 2010–11 season, while the home jersey was demoted to alternate status in 2011 and remained in use until 2013.|$|E
500|$|Another {{attempt was}} started in February 1944 by the DNC to {{incorporate}} wartime lessons and create a cutting <b>edge</b> <b>design,</b> but he soon concluded that [...] "the power of modern weapons had increased so much that ever-increasing armour and torpedo protection was required until it became incompatible with the limited offensive power of the ship."

2500|$|...Dion Phaneuf was a {{last minute}} add {{on to the}} series. He was {{originally}} released in NHL 15 but due to the sculpted laces on the jersey, {{he was not able}} to have a chase figure in the Flames white jersey due to the designs.

2500|$|Little {{more than}} halfway through the 2006–07 season, the Canucks {{announced}} {{that they would be}} changing their jerseys once again. The new uniform was unveiled prior to training camp, on August 29, 2007. It featured the same orca design present on their previous jerseys, but the colour scheme was changed to their [...] "retro" [...] colours of royal blue and kelly green. Additionally, the word [...] "Vancouver" [...] was added to the chest area above the orca. This move was seen as a way to connect the NHL Canucks' uniform to that of the WHL team, whose members wore uniforms with the word [...] "Canucks" [...] along the top in a similar arched design. The actual jerseys themselves were changed to the Rbk <b>Edge</b> <b>design,</b> along with all other teams in the NHL.

40|$|ABSTRACT: New window {{technologies}} are reducing heat transfer through the glazed areas of windows. Low-emissivity (low-E) coatings reduce {{radiative heat transfer}} and low-conductivity gas fills (which replace the air between glazing layers) reduce conductive heat transfer. Given these advantages in insulating glass technol-ogy. researchers and manufacturers {{are now beginning to}} focus their attention on re-ducing heat transfer through window <b>edges.</b> Old <b>edge</b> <b>designs</b> are now under scru-tiny and new designs are being proposed. This paper explores window material and design parameters which influence heat transfer using two-dimensional heat-transfer modeling with an advanced finite-element computer code (ANSYS). A comprehensive set of correlations, based on ANSYS parametncs, is then developed. These correlations are compared, whenever possible, to experimental results and will be incorporated into future versions of the WINDOW program Glazing <b>edge</b> <b>designs</b> analyzed include both double-glazed and triple-glazed options with aluminum, steel, wood, fibergls, butyl, and insulated spacers. Single and double seal design are also analyzed...|$|R

50|$|Another {{reason that}} {{dataflow}} systems never became popular is that compilers {{of the era}} {{found it difficult to}} work with common imperative languages like C++.
