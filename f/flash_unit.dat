25|$|A second substance, {{a type of}} high {{explosive}}, {{would be}} hidden within an AA battery casing; this small explosive charge would detonate the main bomb. The charge would be detonated by linking the bottle of explosives to a light bulb and a disposable camera. The charge from the camera's <b>flash</b> <b>unit</b> would trigger the explosion.|$|E
25|$|Capacitors may {{retain a}} charge long after power {{is removed from}} a circuit; this charge can cause {{dangerous}} or even potentially fatal shocks or damage connected equipment. For example, even a seemingly innocuous device such as a disposable-camera <b>flash</b> <b>unit,</b> powered by a 1.5 volt AA battery, has a capacitor which may contain over 15 joules of energy and be charged to over 300 volts. This is easily capable of delivering a shock. Service procedures for electronic devices usually include instructions to discharge large or high-voltage capacitors, for instance using a Brinkley stick. Capacitors may also have built-in discharge resistors to dissipate stored energy to a safe level within a few seconds after power is removed. High-voltage capacitors are stored with the terminals shorted, as protection from potentially dangerous voltages due to dielectric absorption or from transient voltages the capacitor may pick up from static charges or passing weather events.|$|E

50|$|A custom {{electronic}} <b>flash</b> <b>unit,</b> the AF130P, {{was part}} of the original Auto 110 system, and was produced until the camera ceased being manufactured. Pentax responded to criticism that this electronic <b>flash</b> <b>unit</b> was too large by introducing the smaller AF100P electronic <b>flash</b> <b>unit</b> in 1980. This unit, however, was never part of the Pentax camera kits and became rare.|$|E
50|$|Some {{synchronization}} methods employ optical {{or radio}} triggering that requires no electrical {{connection to the}} camera or main <b>flash</b> <b>unit.</b> This allows the camera to move without the restriction of cables. Optical triggering requires at least one flash electrically connected to the camera. A sensor, either built-in or external to a remote slave <b>flash</b> <b>unit,</b> will sense {{the light from the}} master flash and cause a remote flash to fire. Radio triggering requires a transmitter electrically connected to the camera to trigger a remote receiver connected to (or embedded into) a remote <b>flash</b> <b>unit.</b>|$|E
