5|$|In January 2010, Gill was {{appointed}} manager of Weymouth, then {{bottom of the}} Conference South. With the club already in financial difficulty, many first-team players left. Budgetary constraints meant Gill was unable to bring in replacements, and after 44 days in post, he resigned, feeling the job had become untenable. Weymouth's chairman claimed the cost of travelling from his Midlands <b>home</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> factor in his departure, a suggestion that Gill refuted. In mid-2010, he joined Bristol Rovers as youth team coach. He led the team to {{the third round of}} the FA Youth Cup, in which they lost narrowly to Aston Villa's youth team, before a management restructure at the club resulted in his departure.|$|E
5|$|Millwall began {{life on the}} Isle of Dogs and {{inhabited}} {{four different}} grounds in the club's first 25 years.

From 1886 to 1890 they played behind The Lord Nelson pub on East Ferry Road, which {{was known as the}} Lord Nelson Ground, before being forced to leave by the landlady, who received a better offer for its use.|$|E
5|$|Hundreds of Iowa {{children}} were left homeless by the Civil War. On November 16, 1865, the Iowa Soldiers' Orphans' Home (renamed the Annie Wittenmyer Home in 1949) was opened. The first 150 children arrived from Keokuk, Iowa. Starting in 1876, children from broken homes {{as well as}} orphans from all of Iowa's ninety-nine counties were taken in at the home. The <b>home</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> self-contained community, containing residences, a school, tailor shop, and a chapel. The home had three separate fires during its course. On November 9, 1887, at three o’clock in the morning, the third fire started. The building burnt to the ground. The next day’s Morning Democrat Gazette pointed out that if home was not set up with several different buildings as houses, all 350 children at the time would have been homeless, and some may have not survived the fire. After 110 years of service, the home closed in 1975. It is estimated that well over 12,000 {{children were}} helped by the Home during its operation.|$|E

5|$|Morales {{was born}} in the small rural village of Isallawi in Orinoca Canton, part of western Bolivia's Oruro Department, on 26 October 1959. One of seven {{children}} born to Dionisio Morales Choque and Maria Ayma, only he and two siblings, Esther and Hugo, survived past childhood. His mother almost died from a postpartum haemorrhage following his birth.

His childhood <b>home</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> traditional adobe house, and he grew up speaking the Aymara language, although later commentators would remark that by the time he had become president he was no longer an entirely fluent speaker.|$|E
5|$|For Brazil, {{the result}} {{became one of}} their two worst losses, equalling a 6–0 defeat to Uruguay in 1920, and was their worst-ever defeat at home; their {{previous}} worst defeat at <b>home</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> 5–1 defeat by Argentina in Rio de Janeiro in 1939. The loss broke Brazil's 62-match home unbeaten streak in competitive matches, dating back to their 1–3 loss to Peru in the 1975 Copa América; this match was also played at Estádio Mineirão in Belo Horizonte. The last time Brazil had lost a World Cup semi-final was in 1938, in a dramatic game against Italy in Marseille, and had emerged victorious from this stage the previous six times they had reached it, since the loss in 1974 against Netherlands was not formally a semi-final. Brazil had never before conceded seven goals at home, although they once conceded eight goals in a 4–8 friendly defeat to Yugoslavia on 3 June 1934; {{the last time they}} conceded at least five was in a 6–5 win in the 1938 World Cup versus Poland; at least four was in a 2–4 defeat at the 1954 World Cup against Hungary. Brazil's previous largest losing deficit at the World Cup prior to the match was three goals, which came in the 0–3 defeat to France in the 1998 final. The game's outcome also marked Brazil's worst result against Germany, passing a 0–2 defeat in a 1986 friendly.|$|E
