50|$|However in 1981 Sir John Boardman {{demonstrated}} that the signature on the vase was a modern forgery, and the Kleophrades Painter returned to anonymity. The Kleophrades painter {{is thought to be}} the son of the potter Amasis, and the pupil of Euthymides, as his earliest work greatly resembles that of his master. He himself had pupils, which include the Berlin Painter and also the Boot <b>Painter.</b> <b>Overall</b> the Kleophrades painter is {{recognized as one of the}} greatest pot painters in the late Archaic period in Athens.|$|R
25|$|The {{aircraft}} was <b>painted</b> in <b>overall</b> cream with trim lines and number in red. The outstanding appearance was of its smooth skin and excellent finish, a virtual trademark of William Hawley Bowlus.|$|R

50|$|With the {{retirement}} of the Scottish Aviation Bulldog T.1 from Royal Air Force University Air Squadrons (UASs) and Air Experience Flights (AEFs), a new system {{was put in place}} for the provision of the UAS and AEF flying tasks. Aircraft were to be owned and operated by private industry, contracted to the Ministry of Defence (MoD). The aircraft chosen for this task was the Grob 115E, designated Tutor T1 by the MoD. The Tutor fleet is owned and maintained by a civilian company, Babcock, and carry British civilian registrations under a Private Finance Initiative (PFI) scheme, <b>painted</b> <b>overall</b> white with blue flashes and UK Military Aircraft roundels.|$|R
5000|$|Numbered in the 3000 series, {{they are}} <b>painted</b> <b>overall</b> dark green {{with a yellow}} stripe. Possibly over 200 have been built; they are used {{primarily}} for shunting works in mainline stations in North Korea, and can frequently seen on the P'yŏngŭi Line and other mainlines. The class name, if written in Hanja, is 新星. In this case, these hanja are read as saebyŏl (새별, [...] "New Star"; however, the Soviet-built K62 (M62)-class locomotives have the class name Sinsŏng (신성, [...] "Nova"), which are written with the same hanja. In practice {{this is not an}} issue, as the use of Chinese characters to write Korean is officially discouraged in the DPRK.|$|R

30|$|The {{existence}} of a portrait hidden beneath The Blue Room (1901) by Pablo Picasso prompted a comprehensive technical study of this early Blue period painting. Microanalysis of paint samples was combined with reflectance imaging spectroscopy (RIS) and synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence (SR-XRF) mapping to characterize the materials {{and structure of the}} paint layers and to understand the artist’s palette and use of color in both paintings. Microanalysis of paint samples provided detailed information about pigment mixtures and paint stratigraphy while the complementary data sets provided by RIS and SR-XRF yielded important information about pigment distribution in both pictures and clarified details of the underlying <b>painting.</b> <b>Overall,</b> the comprehensive study increased understanding of both pictures and added to the growing body of knowledge about Picasso’s early experimentation and evolving technique.|$|R
5000|$|The '29's {{body was}} given a '27 Ford {{roadster}} back section. The stock fenders were reshaped, [...] "peaked and bobbed using half-inch round rod". A new grille shell was fabricated from steel and filled with clear plastic tubing; it {{was given a}} forward rake. A three-piece hood was made created from aluminum, while louvered steel splash aprons were mounted. The bed was scratchbuilt from steel, with candy gold inserts(found by Barris at a hardware store) and chrome strips. The quadruple headlights, vertically stacked in pairs, were from a '57 Chrysler. The front bumper {{was a pair of}} nerf bars. Taillights were '56 DeSoto lenses in '58 Impala bezels, protected by hairpins. <b>Painted</b> <b>overall</b> in Swedish White Pearl with candy gold scallops, striping was done by master pinstriper Dean Jeffries (early in his career).|$|R

5000|$|Standard {{camouflage}} as delivered {{from the}} factory was non-specular [...] "Bulletin 41" [...] medium gray #43 undersides with olive drab #41 above, broken {{around the edges of}} the wing and tail surfaces with medium green #41. Stars, or [...] "stars and bars" [...] were applied to both sides of the fuselage and on the upper left and lower right wingtips. The USAAF number appeared on both sides of the vertical stabilizer in either yellow or black. The USMC number appeared in smaller size in black only. Most aircraft were repainted silver during the post-World War II period. Some Marine Corps and Navy aircraft <b>painted</b> <b>overall</b> non-specular Sea Blue. A variety of unit identification markings including nose art were applied in the field. Interior surfaces were generally finished in yellow-green chromate primer and slightly darker ANA 611 [...] "interior green". Instrument panels were [...] "raw" [...] phenolic sheet naturally matte black in color.|$|R
25|$|This book is {{significant}} as {{probably the first}} serious attempt to <b>paint</b> an <b>overall</b> picture of {{the early history of}} Pakistan region.

On completion, SS Hamburg served the Hamburg-Far East (until 1904 when Hapag and NDL no longer combined on the mail route), Hamburg-New York and Genoa-New York runs for the Hamburg America Line. The ship was also twice used by Kaiser Wilhelm II as his state yacht for foreign visits, during which time the ship was <b>painted</b> white <b>overall.</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{six of the}} sixteen songs in Dichterliebe (A Poet’s Love) to {{demonstrate}} how Schumann has used gender and sexuality to provide a masculine perspective. As a comparative work I used examples from Schumann’s Frauenliebe und Leben (A Woman’s Love and Life) to convey the feminine perspective of love. The discussion shows musicological aspects of gender and how composers use certain techniques and structural effects to achieve and illustrate certain genders. The following movements are discussed from the Dichterliebe cycle: Im wunderschönen Monat Mai; Aus meinen Tränen spriessen; Die Rose, die Lilie, die Taube, die Sonne; Ein Jüngling liebt ein Mädchen; Am leuchtenden Sommermorgen; and Die alten, bösen Lieder. As a comparison I used the following songs from Frauenliebe und Leben: Seit ich ihn gesehen; Er, der Herrlichste von allen; Ich kann’s nicht fassen, nicht glauben; Helft mir, ihr Schwestern; and Nun hast du mir den ersten Schmerz getan. My analysis includes theoretical studies, text <b>painting,</b> <b>overall</b> form and any other musical aspect that may relate to illustrating how gender is presented in these two works.
