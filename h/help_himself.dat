5|$|During May {{we had a}} weird game at Bristol v. Gloucester. We scored 200 for 1 wicket. W. G. {{then went}} on and took 5 wickets, {{and we were all}} out for 300. He then {{proceeded}} to go in first and <b>help</b> <b>himself</b> to 288, and to get his hundredth century. I had the satisfaction of giving him a full pitch to get to his hundred, not that he wanted any help.|$|E
5|$|Blamey became {{involved}} in his first and greatest scandal soon after taking office. During a raid on a brothel in Fitzroy on 21 October 1925, the police encountered a man who produced Blamey's police badge, No. 80. Blamey later {{said that he had}} given his key ring, which included his badge, to a friend who had served with him in France, so that the man could <b>help</b> <b>himself</b> to some alcohol in Blamey's locker at the Naval and Military Club. His story was corroborated by his friend Stanley Savige, who was with him at the time. Blamey protected the man in question, who he said was married with children, and refused to identify him. The man has never been identified, but the description given by the detectives and the brothel owner did not match Blamey.|$|E
5|$|Mehldau has {{expressed}} an interest in, and knowledge of, philosophy and literature. In a 2003 interview he commented on romanticism and nostalgia, linking pleasure and pain to musical expression: I love {{the part of the}} Orpheus myth where he is allowed to take his wife out of Hades on the condition that he doesn't look back at her for the trip on the river Styx. When he can't <b>help</b> <b>himself,</b> he looks back, and she is pulled back downstream away from him, taken away forever. Music is that moment right when he looks at her: seeing something that you love for an instant being taken away forever. There's an element of folly to the whole thing – you look even though you know you shouldn't. Music kind of yokes together the feeling of attainment and the feeling of loss at the same time.|$|E

25|$|Roth was a witty man but unnatural campaigner. To <b>help</b> <b>himself,</b> {{he would}} ease himself into public {{appearances}} by bringing along a Saint Bernard dog. His succession of St. Bernards through his 34-year political career became a trademark of sorts.|$|E
25|$|Another factor {{contributing}} to the brevity of REBT is that the therapist seeks to empower the client to <b>help</b> <b>himself</b> through future adversities. REBT only promotes temporary solutions if more fundamental solutions are not found. An ideal successful collaboration between the REBT therapist and a client results in changes to the client's philosophical way of evaluating himself or herself, others, {{and his or her}} life, which will likely yield effective results. The client then moves toward unconditional self-acceptance, other-acceptance and life-acceptance while striving to live a more self-fulfilling and happier life.|$|E

25|$|On 3 October 1968, {{at the age}} of 15, Dupas, still {{attending}} school in Waverley High in the south-eastern Melbourne suburb of Mount Waverley, visited his next-door neighbour, requesting to borrow a knife for the purpose of peeling vegetables. Dupas was apprehended after he stabbed the woman in the face, neck, and hand as she attempted to fight off his attack. He later told police he could not <b>help</b> <b>himself</b> and did not know why he began to attack the woman. He was placed on 18 months probation and admitted to the Larundel Psychiatric Hospital for evaluation; he was released after two weeks and treated as an outpatient.|$|E
25|$|After Hazumu's {{transformation}} into a girl, Asuta suddenly finds {{his good friend}} Hazumu very attractive, and cannot <b>help</b> <b>himself</b> when he starts thinking about Hazumu in a sexual way. During the time when Hazumu and her friends go to the beach, Asuta continuously tries to remind himself that even though Hazumu's body has changed, the person is still the same, and as her best friend, {{he should not be}} thinking about her in a sexual way. Hazumu remains oblivious to the fact throughout the series that Asuta has been often thinking about her in a sexual way. Asuta continues to have fantasies about having Hazumu as a girlfriend as well. Overtime, Asuta realizes that Hazumu and him gradually grow apart from each other, or are at least not as close as they once had been when Hazumu was a boy. He does find it excellent that his friend is now a very attractive girl, but only wants to continue being Hazumu's friend and nothing more, constantly beating himself up for having impure thoughts about Hazumu. In the last pages of the manga, he announces to the others that he has found a girlfriend, and shows them a photograph of her. They remark that she looks a lot like Hazumu.|$|E
500|$|Thinking {{of music}} in terms of basic elements, Jewel would tell the {{director}} that for certain scenes, {{it should not have}} bass since, as an earth tone, it is usually used for a more emotional or ominous part. Jewel thought the music should be in the upper register and relaxing for the [...] "dreamlike" [...] scene. To <b>help</b> <b>himself</b> with the music composition process, and to conjure up melodies, the producer would highlight many phrases from the novel, then print those words in large font, and hung them on his walls or draw pictures during viewings of Drive.|$|E

500|$|... "Competition" [...] {{was well}} {{received}} by television critics. Eric Goldman of IGN gave the episode an 8.6. ("Great") Goldman enjoyed Sandman's nonchalant behavior, favoring using his newfound powers for money over getting his revenge on Spider-Man. He {{wrote that the}} episode [...] "delivered {{some of the best}} fight scenes yet," [...] including the Spider-Man punching Sandman only to discover he is made of sand, which he called his favorite fight scene in the entire episode. On Peter's personal life being portrayed, Goldman wrote that he [...] "had to deal with the age old superhero conflict regarding whether he could use his powers to <b>help</b> <b>himself</b> in everyday ways – not just whether it was 'right' but whether it might give him away." ...|$|E
500|$|Eugenides is of Greek heritage, albeit {{only through}} his father's side. Although his {{paternal}} grandparents were not siblings like the Stephanides, they were silk farmers like their fictional counterparts. Also like Cal, Eugenides learned some Greek customs to <b>help</b> <b>himself</b> understand his grandparents better. [...] The Zebra Room and the bartender profession are other items shared by their grandfathers; Eugenides said {{the inclusion of}} the bar was a deliberate [...] "secret code of paying homage to my grandparents and my parents." [...] Several aspects of Chapter Eleven were based on Eugenides' elder brother, who withdrew from society during a [...] "hippie phase" [...] in his life. While revising and editing the book, the author removed information that could be offensive to his relatives. Not all such material was excised, Eugenides said: [...] "There may still be things in there that will sting." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{commentary}} alternates between blank verse, free verse, and prose. Although Betjeman {{had accompanied}} the production {{on most of}} its shoots, his poetic commentary was only written {{in the weeks after}} the film had already been edited by Roberts. According to Mirzoeff, he would run sequences from the film for hours, searching for inspiration in the rhythm of the editing, sometimes sitting in a small cupboard to <b>help</b> <b>himself</b> concentrate. Mirzoeff notes that he found writing the text for A Passion for Churches more of a strain than for his previous film since he had to take into consideration both his own beliefs and those of his friends. Sometimes members of the crew would help him by writing their own verses for him to use or modify. One particular sequence proved so difficult to write that Betjeman flew into a rage after the director pressured him to hurry the composition along. Mirzoeff suggests that several sequences, such as the scene about redundancy and death, provoked verse of much greater [...] "complexity and depth" [...] than any heard in his previous screen appearances.|$|E

500|$|According to the {{protocol}} provided by Navy Secretary George M. Robeson, {{command of the}} expedition {{was turned over to}} Budington, under whom discipline further devolved. The precious coal was being burned at a high rate: [...] in November, which was [...] more than the previous month, and close to [...] in December. Budington was often seen to be drunk, but he was far from the only one to pilfer the alcohol stores; according to testimony at the Inquiry, Tyson was also seen [...] "drunk like old mischief", and Schumann had {{gone so far as to}} make a duplicate of Budington's key so that he could <b>help</b> <b>himself</b> to alcohol as well. Whatever the role of alcohol, it was clear that shipboard routine was breaking down; as Tyson remarked, [...] "There is so little regularity observed. There is no stated time for putting out lights; the men are allowed to do as they please; and, consequently, they often make nights hideous by their carousing, playing cards to all hours." [...] For purposes unknown, Budington chose to issue the ship's supply of firearms to the crew.|$|E
500|$|After Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis) {{was pushed}} from the Lassiter's Hotel mezzanine, Mark was {{introduced}} {{as the lead}} detective on the case. Mark had his [...] "work cut out for him" [...] as he began questioning the suspects, as they each pointed the finger at someone else. He also received conflicting information as everyone had their own suspicions as to who committed the crime. McGregor revealed that Kate Ramsay (Ashleigh Brewer) had given Rebecca Robinson (Jane Hall) a false alibi, Lyn Scully (Janet Andrewartha) points out that Diana Marshall (Jane Badler) earring was found {{at the crime scene}} and Andrew Robinson (Jordan Smith) did not <b>help</b> <b>himself</b> with his attitude towards the investigation. Of the case, McGregor said [...] "Brennan is {{in the thick of the}} investigation so it's pretty exciting, I've never had so much responsibility." [...] McGregor later explained that it had been [...] "great" [...] to be involved in the storyline, even though he did not share many scenes with Dennis, as he was in a hospital bed. Rebecca was revealed to have been the one who pushed Paul and McGregor said that he knew early on in the storyline that she was the culprit. However, Mark did not know that Rebecca was responsible as he had been thrown by the false alibis. McGregor later said that his first week on Neighbours, filming the Who Pushed P.R? storyline, had stuck in his mind as there were many long interview scenes he had to get through.|$|E
500|$|... "Clown"'s concept {{deals with}} an {{incident}} that happened in San Diego, California. A skinhead that told Davis to [...] "go back to Bakersfield" [...] attempted to hit Davis but he dodged and the band's road manager, Jeff, knocked the skinhead out. [...] "Helmet in the Bush" [...] was about Davis' drug abuse, and the fear that gripped him {{at the height of}} his drug problem. He pleaded for a divine intervention to deliver him from his nightmare, as if he cannot <b>help</b> <b>himself.</b> Davis explained: [...] "I'd wake up in the morning and do a line to get out of bed. Speed in the morning, I'd have it all lined up for breakfast so when I'd lay down and go to sleep, I'd wake up and just snort and it's like 'Yeah, okay, I'm up. ' It was bad. It's like, you do one line and stay up all night, but then you have shit to do the next day so you have to do another line to be able keep staying up to get that shit done. Eventually you start spinning-out from sleep deprivation. You get hallucinations and shit like that." [...] Davis said that [...] "Helmet in the Bush" [...] "is about meth. It's about when you do meth and you look down at your dick and it's literally a helmet in the bush [...] ". [...] "Basically it's what happens when you do too much drugs and your girl wanna get with you and you got some man problems down below. Just another reason not to do drugs, children," [...] Fieldy elaborated.|$|E

500|$|Soaps In Depth {{reported}} that Engen quickly gained viewer support after joining the cast as Adam, {{as did the}} character's romance with Heather. The support continued when the character took a dark turn. Engen said, [...] "To {{think there was any}} likability left in the character baffles me! I'm very grateful to the fans...they've been so supportive." [...] The actor said fans wanted Adam either redeemed or turned into a gray character. Davidson credited the character's likability to Engen's looks, saying, [...] "...he really nailed this character. Chris' all-American looks add another layer to this story: he looks like he regrets being so evil, but he can't <b>help</b> <b>himself.</b> When Chris informed me he was leaving, I told him he really accomplished something by being so likable playing this villain." [...] Nelson Branco repeatedly praised Engen's acting and Adam's storyline with Ashley and Victor, saying, [...] "he Haunting of Ashley is fast becoming one of my favorite all-time soap storylines ever. It's so 1970s. I have no doubt former Another World master scribe and Paul Rauch BFF/frenemy, Harding Lemay, is freaking if he's watching this gothic, macabre and super-creepy mystery. Moreover, camp-ilicious Chris Engen (Adam) is stealing the story with his very bitchy, and sexy performance of a deranged son scorned." [...] Soaps In Depth also commended Adam's storyline. The magazine awarded Engen a gold star for portraying Adam as a gray character with [...] "sardonic humor". Soap Opera Digest named Engen [...] "performer of the week" [...] for his final scenes as Adam, saying the actor [...] "gave a performance that elevated Adam from an average villain to a complex mastermind".|$|E

The man can use force and gravity to <b>help</b> <b>himself</b> in, and the position allows the woman to relax her vaginal muscles and help her partner guide his penis gently in with her hand. Suzi Godson said, [...] "In an observational study carried out in The Netherlands, magnetic resonance imaging was used to study {{the male and female}} genitals during coitus. The images illustrate the very natural fit of the male and female genitals in [...] position.
