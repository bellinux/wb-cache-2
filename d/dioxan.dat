40|$|The dipole {{moments of}} a number of {{substituted}} anilines, in both benzene and <b>dioxan,</b> have been evaluated from measurements of the dielectric constants, densities and refractive indices of dilute solutions. In selecting the compounds for study attention was paid to the desirability of comparing, on the one hand, the effects of o-p and m-directing substituents and, on the other hand, the effects of the positions of the groups on the deviations from the moments to be expected from the simple vector addition theory. Hence, the dipol 9 moments of m- and p-nitro- and bromo-, 2 : 4 - and 3 : 5 -dinitro- and dibromo- and 2 : 4 : 6 -trinitroaniline, p-nitro- and 2 : 4 -dinitromethyl-aniline and 2 -methyl- 4 -nitroaniline have been measured in both solvents. The results have been interpreted in terms of the mesomeric and inductive effects of the substituents. In the absence of substituents in positions ortho to the amino-group the difference between the apparent moments of the amines in <b>dioxan</b> and benzene solutions increased progressively with increase in the interaction moment. The presence of methyl groups, bromine atoms or nitro-groups in both positions ortho to the amino-group decreased the <b>dioxan</b> increment although there appeared to be no appreciable interference when there was one nitro-group in such a position and only slight inhibition of the mesomeric effect when there was one bromine atom in the ortho-posit ion.

This is probably {{not the result of}} intramolecular hydrogen bonding since ethyl trans- 2 -hydroxycyclopentanecarboxylate for which such bonding is not possible reacts as fast or faster than the cis-ester. It is tentatively suggested that the smaller dependence of the rates of hydrolysis of the hydroxy-esters on <b>dioxan</b> concentration compared to the unsubstituted ester is the result of solvent sorting. Similar behaviour is found for the hydrolysis of the 2 -naphthyl esters and for the ethyl and 2 -naphthyl esters of 3 -hydroxybutyric acid. The rates of hydrolysis of the hydroxy-esters are enhanced in borate buffers possibly as a result of borate-ester formation followed by intramolecular nucleophilic catalysis.

Three deuterations of the non-deuterated ethylenic ester in <b>dioxan</b> show that the hydrogen redistribution and the deuterium distribution depend upon the concentration of the catalyst. A low concentration (5 % of the sample weight) of catalyst promotes the light isotope redistribution, while a high concentration (10 %) favours the heavy isotope distribution.

Deute-ration of this olefin reveals the hydrogen redistribution which is as extensive as the deuterium redistribution in the preceding hydrogenation.

In the presence of 0. 014 M-sodium acetate/acetic acid buffer (pH 5. 0) there was a slight increase in enzymic activity in the presence of low concentrations of <b>dioxan</b> (up to about 10 % <b>dioxan)</b> and a rapid decrease in enzymic activity at higher <b>dioxan</b> concentrations, but both effects were mitigated in the presence of 0. 1 M buffer.

40|$|A {{characterisation}} of the {{activated alumina}} {{used in the}} sorption studies has been attempted from results obtained by X-ray diffraction techniques, low temperature nitrogen sorptions and sorptions from the liquid phase. The sorption characteristics at an alumina-dioxan interface {{of a series of}} 4 -substituted phenols (phenol, 4 -methyl-, 4 -t-butyl-, 4 -chloro-, 4 -nitro-, and 4 -cyano-phenols) have been determined at 35 C.; solubilities in <b>dioxan</b> measured at 35 C.; experimental adsorption isotherms constructed and sorption saturation values estimated. In order to compare the sorptive affinity of the alumina surface for the phenols an index of sorption has been defined as "the number of moles of phenol sorbed at constant relative mole fraction of phenol in the mobile phase", and it has been demonstrated that this index can be related logarithmically to the Hammett sigma constant for the appropriate 4 -substituent. The effects of 4 -substitution on properties of the OH bond which reflect its hydrogen bonding tendency have been examined, such as association to <b>dioxan</b> in solution. Absorbance measurements in the near ultra-violet have enabled association constants in solution for the process substituted phenol + dioxin ↔ complex to be determined at 25 C. and 55 C. Comparisons have been made with other relevant characteristics of the OH bond, for example acidity, polarity and near infra red stretching frequency, again showing (as with the hydrogen bonding association constants) good correlation with the Hammett structural parameter. The results obtained suggest that in the sorption of 4 -substituted phenols from <b>dioxan</b> solution onto an activated alumina the forces on the surface are the dominant ones, since the phenols are not adsorbed as complexes but as discreet molecules. Interaction with the surface appears to be through the mechanism of hydrogen bonding and the phenol molecules probably assume a vertical orientation on localised sorption sites...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{an investigation of}} the redistribution of electronic charge that occurs during the molecular vibrations of 1, 4 -dioxan and related compounds. The infrared band intensities of dioxan-dg, dioxan-dg, cyclohexane-d 0, cyclohexane-d 12 and tetrahydropyran were measured in both solution and gas phases. In the solution phase, overlapping band systems were split into their components by assuming Lorentzian band contours and producing the absorbance maximum, band half width and peak frequency from a least squares procedure. The individual gas phase intensities in such spectral regions were then derived by assuming that the distribution of intensity across the region was the same in both phases. Normal coordinate calculations were performed and extended to reduce the <b>dioxan</b> and cyclo-hexane experimental intensities to parameters known as atomic polar tensors (APTs). Each element of the APT for an atom represents the change in a component (x, y or z) of the molecular dipole moment on moving the atom along one of the molecule-fixed Cartesian axes. The sign ambiguity of the experimental dipole derivatives was satisfactorily resolved using constraints provided by the intensities of the deuterated compounds: APTs were calculated from each possible choice of signs and these were used in turn to predict the intensity of the deuterated molecule - the APT was rejected if the agreement was unsatisfactory (as measured by a "fit factor"). The Gaussian 76 package for MO calculations was used to calculate ab initio APTs, and also, for <b>dioxan,</b> to derive a general valence force field. The latter, after least-squares refinement to the frequencies, proved more appropriate for the analysis of the <b>dioxan</b> intensities than a field derived from the Snyder-Zerbi generalized ether force field alone.

40|$|Considering an {{associated}} binary solution, e. g. alcohol + carbon tetrachloride, {{as a system}} of single molecules („monomers”) and associated complexes in equilibrium with one another, {{it has been shown}} in the first paper of this serie, by using the principle of detailed balancing of elementary processes, that the relation fA /fB = α (1.) holds between the activity coefficients if the deviations from the laws of perfect solutions can be entirely ascribed to the presence of the complexes. α denotes the fraction of molecules of the associated constituent which appear as single molecules. Equation (1.) implies that unassociated molecules A („monomers”) and molecules of solvent B play equivalent roles in the solution. This relation, which is completely independent of any hypothesis about the mode of association, can be checked by comparing thermodynamic measurements of fA and fB with values of α obtained from the spectroscopic study of the intensity of the OH vibration band. In the preceding paper, relation (1.) has been verified for a certain number of associated solutions. Yet small deviations have been observed. In order to understand the origin of these residual deviations we have studied the thermodynamic and spectroscopic properties of the systems ethyl alcohol‐carbon disulphide and ethyl alcohol‐dioxan. In both systems we expected important deviations from formula (1). The first system presents an upper critical mixing temperature at − 23 ° 5 C. In the second case there is a strong interaction between the oxygen atoms of <b>dioxan</b> and the hydroxyl group of ethyl alcohol. The interaction between a monomer of alcohol and <b>dioxan</b> is certainly much stronger than the interaction between two molecules of <b>dioxan</b> either the non polar interaction of two monomers (the polar interaction is taken account separately by the presence of complexes). The experimental results have entirely confirmed this point of view. The difference between α and the ratio fA/fB may be expressed by a residual excess free energy which is found to be positive in the system ethylalcohol‐carbon disulphide and negative in the system ethyl alcohol‐dioxan. The order of magnitude of this residual excess free energy is discussed. Copyright © 1953 Wiley‐VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimSCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

It {{has been used for}} determining the solubility of sulphur in tetrahydrofuran and <b>dioxan.</b> The apparent heat of solution indicates that sulphur dissolves in these solvents without any marked solute—solvent interactions...|$|E
40|$|The {{reactions}} of tin(II) chloride in tetrahydrofuran with the η 1 -allyl systems, [η 5 -Cp(CO) 2 Fe allyll, have been reexamined, and an extension made to SnBr 2 and GeCl 2. <b>dioxan.</b> The insertion compounds, [η 5 -Cp(CO) 2 FeMX 2 allyl], which contain the Group IVB element bound to iron, {{are the major}} products, but, {{in the presence of}} excess metal dihalide, these slowly react to form the trihalometal compounds [η 5 -Cp(CO) 2 FeMX 3]. The insertion reactions are inhibited by small amounts of a radical scavenger, and occur initially with allylic rearrangement. In methanol, the process is more complex; an unknown species, possibly an iron-olefin dipolar intermediate, and substantial amounts of trihalometal-iron compounds are formed additionally. A mechanistic scheme for the processes is discussed...|$|E
40|$|SummaryAlnumycin {{is closely}} related to the benzoisochromanequinone (BIQ) {{polyketides}} such as actinorhodin. Exceptional structural features include differences in aglycone tailoring that result in the unique alnumycin chromophore and the existence of an unusual 4 -hydroxymethyl- 5 -hydroxy- 1, 3 -dioxan moiety. Cloning and sequencing of the alnumycin gene cluster from Streptomyces sp. CM 020 revealed expected biosynthesis genes for polyketide assembly, but several genes encoding subsequent tailoring enzymes were highly atypical. Heterologous expression studies confirmed that all of the genes required for alnumycin biosynthesis resided within the sequenced clone. Inactivation of genes aln 4 and aln 5 showed that the mechanism of pyran ring formation differs from actinorhodin and granaticin pathways. Further inactivation studies identified two genes, alnA and alnB, involved in the synthesis and attachment of the <b>dioxan</b> moiety, and resulted in the production of the polyketide prealnumycin...|$|E
40|$|Rate {{constants}} for the saponification of four oiftho substituted benzoic esters {{have been}} measm-ed over {{a range of}} temperatures in bOfo (w/vj dioxan-water, using a spectrophotometric teclinique for following the rate of reaction. The results for one compound, ethyl o-toluate, have been checiced by a titration technique. Thermodynamic activation parameters have been calculated for the esters studied, and their values have been {{discussed in terms of}} substituent and solvent effects. The ultraviolet spectra of five other esters have been measured in the solvent indicated. The spectrophotometric technique {{has been found to be}} unsuitable for the study of rates of saponification of these esters, and the applicability and facility of this technique have been discussed. Difficulties have been encountered due to the reaction of hydroxyl ion with a solvent impurity, 2 -methyl- 1, 3 -dioxolane, but aqueous <b>dioxan</b> has been found to be a suitable solvent for the study of ester hydrolysis reactions if it has been carefully purified...|$|E
