40|$|This {{document}} {{concerns the}} renegotiation {{of a contract}} for the supply of eight coil casings for the Barrel Toroid Magnet of the ATLAS detector. The proposal for the award of a contract with ABB ENERTECH (CH) was presented to Finance Committee for information in September 1998 (CERN/FC/ 4089). In view of the developments outlined in this document, the Finance Committee is invited {{to agree to the}} renegotiation of a contract with ALSTOM SWITZERLAND (CH), for the supply of eight coil casings for the ATLAS Barrel Toroid Magnet for a total <b>Ex-works</b> <b>price</b> of 12 580 000 Swiss francs, subject to revision after 31 July 2001, with an option for an extra coil casing for an additional <b>Ex-works</b> <b>price</b> of 1 525 000 Swiss francs, subject to revision after 31 July 2001, bringing the total amount for the supply to 14 105 000 Swiss francs, subject to revision after 31 July 2001. The total amount of the contract, including transport to the integration site, will not exceed 14 490 000 Swiss francs, subject to revision after 31 July 2001. The increase in price for the eight coil casings, excluding the option for the additional coil casing and transport to the integration site, will not exceed 4 084 000 Swiss francs. The additional cost will be borne mainly by the participating institutes in Germany and Switzerland, according to their relative contribution to the original total price. Any outstanding balance will be financed by the ATLAS Common Fund. CERN's contribution will not exceed 500 000 Swiss francs. The option for the additional coil casing, if needed, as well as the cost of transport to the integration site will be covered by the ATLAS Common Fund. CERN's contribution will not exceed 300 000 Swiss francs. The firm has indicated the following distribution by country of the contract value covered by this adjudication proposal: DE - 57 %; CH - 29 %; NL - 14 %...|$|E
30|$|The data {{limitations}} notwithstanding, a {{trend to}} {{the prevalence of}} VPT asymmetries toward price increase seems to prevail both from <b>ex-work</b> to retail <b>price</b> and the other way around. On the one hand, this means that when <b>ex-work</b> <b>price</b> increased, retail price followed. However, {{it also means that}} the reduction of <b>ex-work</b> <b>price</b> was not fully transmitted to retail, causing the distance in absolute terms between <b>ex-work</b> and retail <b>prices</b> of sugar in the EU to tendentially increase over time.|$|R
3000|$|On {{the other}} hand, asymmetries toward price {{increase}} from retail to <b>ex-work</b> <b>price</b> implies that sugar producers were often {{able to follow}} (more or less proportionally, and with different extent of delay) price increases coming from the retail sector, while downward variations of retail prices have not resulted in an analogous response by sugar producers. 8 [...]...|$|R
30|$|The {{empirical}} assessment investigated about {{intensity and}} speed of VPT and {{on the existence of}} asymmetries. The visual inspection revealed that the three-step reduction of sugar intervention price between 2006 / 07 and 2009 / 10 (and conclusion of intervention purchases from the 2010 / 11 campaign onwards), which was implemented by the 2006 reform, did not fully translate in a decrease of <b>ex-work</b> sugar <b>prices</b> in the EU. Indeed, <b>ex-work</b> <b>prices</b> stayed well above the intervention price {{until the end of the}} 2009 / 10 marketing year, and kept a wide margin over the reference price from October 2009 onwards. Evidence also suggests that the reduction of sugar beet minimum prices introduced by the 2006 reform did not fully translate into an equivalent decrease of sugar beet prices.|$|R
30|$|Actually, the {{functioning}} of vertical price transmission in the sugar sector is remarkably affected {{by the state of}} competition in the downstream levels of the supply chain (food industry, distribution), over which the EU sugar regime bears no direct influence. The assessment highlighted the evident asymmetry toward price increases with retail prices reacting to increases more often than to decreases in <b>ex-work</b> <b>prices.</b> This implies that operators in the downstream sectors are prone to adopting such pricing behaviour: it is unlikely that they will change it in absence of any pressure in this direction.|$|R
5000|$|In May 1969 final {{specifications}} {{and prices}} for the Japanese market were announced. There were originally two engine versions, being the [...] "Series 77" [...] with a single carburetor [...] engine and the [...] "Series 99" [...] with a four carburetors [...] unit: the less powerful car was listed with four levels of trim offered, of which the top three were also available with the four carburetor engine. The manufacturer's <b>ex-works</b> <b>prices</b> ranged from ¥488,000 for the entry level [...] "Series 77" [...] standard saloon to ¥710,000 for the [...] "Series 99" [...] Custom saloon. [...] Automatic transmission and air-conditioning were optional. Six of the seven versions offered were priced comfortably above the Toyota Corolla 4-door deluxe, then retailing at ¥520,000: for this price Toyota included delivery to the Tokyo area.|$|R
30|$|Due to {{confidentiality}} issues concerning sugar production cost data, {{an ad hoc}} procedure was adopted to treat the Lerner Index—defined as [(sugar price − sugar production cost)/(sugar price)]—in the assessment, thus shaping {{a modified version of}} the Lerner index. Time series of the Lerner Index were calculated by DG Agriculture on the basis of sugar <b>ex-work</b> <b>prices</b> and of LMC International sugar production cost data. The values of the Lerner Index were then multiplied by an unknown constant, different for each Member State. The resulting time series are referred to in this study as “Adjusted Lerner Index” (ALI). The abovementioned procedure allowed comparisons of time series of the ALI between Member States only in terms of dynamics, not of absolute level of the ALI itself. We assessed the effects of the reform on competition by observing the evolution of the index against the succession of policy-related and industry-related significant events (see Table  2 above), which we considered in the study of the evolution of other variables concerning competition as well (number of producers, number of beet sugar factories in operation, average production capacity of such factories).|$|R
30|$|If {{it is true}} {{that the}} ALI {{constitutes}} a synthetic index of the degree of competition which takes into account also the effect of increased sugar imports, and hence of the possible entry of new operators on the EU market, it should be conceded that it cannot adequately represent the many qualitative aspects which may determine actual competition within the EU sugar sector. In this respect, it is also extremely important to underline that the average EU <b>ex-work</b> sugar <b>price</b> remarkably increased over the first months of 2012 in comparison with late 2011 levels. Such price dynamics might have affected the recent evolution of the ALI, especially if sugar production cost has not experienced an analogous evolution over the same period. Hence, these price dynamics also suggest that EU sugar producers might again be exerting remarkable market power, keeping in mind that price dynamics on the EU market mainly derive from the evolution of market fundamentals, which can be influenced by policy decisions taken by the European Commission.|$|R
3000|$|Speed, {{intensity}} {{and the existence}} of asymmetry were also investigated. The sugar industry was the pivotal reference to test price transmission. VPT was tested upstream toward agricultural sector for sugar beet price, and downstream toward the retailing sector for retail price. Tests were performed in the relevant sugar-producing countries and different EU Member State aggregations (EU- 15, NMS- 12, EU- 25 and EU- 27), depending on the specific issue. The potential effects of the reform were analysed taking into account the absolute level of price, its variation and the relation between prices occurring within two different markets over a certain time span. In particular, VPT was tested by taking into account the relation between <b>ex-work</b> and retail <b>prices</b> and vice versa in the pre- and post-reform periods. 3 [...]...|$|R
