5|$|Brian and Stewie go to {{the mall}} so they can meet Santa, but Peter is asking Santa for gifts (he asks for a game of Uno, a Magna Doodle, a pet chink (a mix of a {{chinchilla}} and a mink) and a Charles in Charge lunchbox.) When the mall Santa leaves for the night and Brian demands that he let Stewie sit in his lap, Santa mentions he will be at Applebee's. Stewie says that Santa leaving before he got a chance to sit in his lap felt like a bigger betrayal than the betrayal of Gary Busey by reality; this takes us to Busey looking <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> asking his reflection, {{in the form of a}} crazed clown, how he is doing.|$|E
25|$|The game also {{includes}} an alternate final level, where the final battle is played from Leo's perspective. He successfully destroys Daniel's personality and {{wakes up in}} control of his mind and body. Whyte, who thinks she is speaking to Daniel, asks him if he is okay, to which he replies he is keen {{to get back to}} work on the Bridge. As he looks at <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror,</b> Daniel sees Leo's reflection looking back at him.|$|E
25|$|Following Duffey's murder, Nilsen {{began to}} kill with {{increasing}} frequency. Before {{the end of}} 1980, he was to kill a further five victims and attempt to murder one other, although {{only one of these}} victims whom Nilsen murdered, 26-year-old William David Sutherland, has ever been identified. Nilsen's recollections of the unidentified victims are vague, although he graphically recalled how each victim had been murdered and just how long the body had been retained before dissection. One unidentified victim killed in November had moved his legs in a cycling motion as he was strangled (Nilsen is known to have absented himself from work between 11 and 18 November, likely due to this particular murder); another unidentified victim Nilsen had unsuccessfully attempted to resuscitate, before sinking to his knees and sobbing, before standing to expressly spit at his own image as he looked at <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror.</b> On another occasion, he had lain in bed alongside the body of an unidentified victim as he listened to the classical theme Fanfare for the Common Man before bursting into tears.|$|E
60|$|The lacquey by {{the door}} of Dillon's auctionrooms shook his handbell twice again and viewed <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> chalked <b>mirror</b> of <b>the</b> cabinet.|$|R
6000|$|... "That," [...] said Psmith, {{looking at}} <b>himself</b> earnestly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror,</b> and {{straightening}} his tie, [...] "is the exact program. We must stake out our claims. This is practical socialism." ...|$|R
60|$|Again Billy {{applied the}} blade to his face. After {{a couple of}} scrapes, he looked at <b>himself</b> closely <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror,</b> grinned, and went on shaving. With {{swiftness}} and dexterity he scraped his face clean of lather. Saxon clapped her hands.|$|R
500|$|The {{relationship}} between Chris and Ann {{was described by}} Sundermann as [...] "one {{of the most interesting}} parts of the show and the reason, specifically, is Chris". Likewise, Porter said Lowe and Rashida Jones had developed a [...] "fantastic dynamic". Joel Keller of TV Squad said he found Chris [...] "a little two-dimensional", and believed the relationship was poorly handled because it made Ann too passive. Lowe received particularly strong praise for his role in [...] "Flu Season", in which Chris became extremely ill and hallucinatory when infected with the flu. Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter said Lowe's character seemed well-integrated into the cast by the episode [...] "Flu Season", and added [...] "If you've never believed Lowe can make you laugh out loud, pay attention to that episode." [...] Steve Kandell said Lowe stole the show from the usual Parks powerhouses of Nick Offerman and Chris Pratt, and called one scene, when Lowe tries to will away his flu by yelling to <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> [...] "Stop...pooping!", the [...] "single greatest self-effacingly comic moment of his long, handsome career".|$|E
500|$|Footage of an {{interview}} with Rowdy Roddy Piper was aired as Piper {{made his way to}} the ring to face [...] "Adorable" [...] Adrian Adonis, who was accompanied by [...] "The Mouth of the South" [...] Jimmy Hart, in Piper's retirement match. Piper and Adonis began the match by attacking each other with Piper's belt. Adonis put a sleeper hold on Piper in the middle of the ring and released the hold prior to Piper's arm going down for a 3rd time, thinking that he won the match. When Jimmy Hart got in the ring to celebrate with Adonis, Brutus Beefcake came to the ring to help Piper recover, and Piper attacked Adonis and performed a sleeper hold of his own. Piper got the victory, and after the match was over, Brutus got in the ring and cut Adrian Adonis' hair as Piper held Jimmy Hart down. After being woken by Beefcake and seeing <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> he had brought to the ring that Piper was holding, Adonis hit the mirror and chased Piper around the ring before leaving the ring in embarrassment with Hart using his jacket to cover Adonis' head.|$|E
500|$|At the Palmer home, Leland {{smiles at}} <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror.</b> BOB stares {{back at him}} from the {{reflection}} and cackles madly. Leland dons a pair of latex gloves. Maddy comes downstairs complaining of a burning smell and sees Sarah unconscious on the floor. She sees Leland grinning at her, then sees BOB appear in Leland's place. She screams in terror and attempts to flee. Leland chases Maddy up the stairs, and drags her to the living room. He strangles and punches her, then taunts and chases her around the living room. He corners her and punches her in the face until she is catatonic. He dances with and cries over her limp body, calling her [...] "Laura," [...] while Bob kisses her. Leland / BOB then becomes enraged and screams, [...] "Leland says you're going back to Missoula, MONTANA!" [...] as he rams her head into a glass picture frame, the words [...] "Missoula, Montana" [...] in the lower corner of the picture. Maddy collapses, bloodied and dead. A crazed Leland places a cutout of the letter [...] "O" [...] under the nail of Maddy's left ring finger.|$|E
60|$|Scape, ruined, honest, and broken-hearted at sixty-five {{years of}} age, {{went out to}} Calcutta to wind up {{the affairs of the}} house. Walter Scape was {{withdrawn}} from Eton and put into a merchant's house. Florence Scape, Fanny Scape, and their mother faded away to Boulogne, and will be heard of no more. To be brief, Jos stepped in and bought their carpets and sideboards and admired <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirrors</b> which had reflected their kind handsome faces. The Scape tradesmen, all honourably paid, left their cards, and were eager to supply the new household. <b>The</b> large men <b>in</b> white waistcoats who waited at Scape's dinners, greengrocers, bank-porters, and milkmen in their private capacity, left their addresses and ingratiated themselves with the butler. Mr. Chummy, the chimney-purifier, who had swept the last three families, tried to coax the butler and the boy under him, whose duty it was to go out covered with buttons and with stripes down his trousers, for the protection of Mrs. Amelia whenever she chose to walk abroad.|$|R
60|$|The Emperor {{took off}} all his clothes, and the impostors placed {{themselves}} before {{him as if}} they were putting on each part of his new clothes which was ready, and the Emperor turned and bent <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> front of <b>the</b> <b>mirror.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Helen {{runs into}} a room with an exhibit of {{poisonous}} reptiles, places the videotape underneath a display case and hides <b>in</b> <b>the</b> men's washroom. The Doctor's younger brother, Rabbit, comes <b>in,</b> checks <b>himself</b> out <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> and leaves, but not before throwing some of the snakes into the bathroom. Kit and the Lones rescue Helen, but not before she has been poisoned. Kit finds an anti-venom serum, and learns that Helen managed to record <b>the</b> Doctor's face <b>in</b> her footage.|$|R
500|$|... "Flu Season" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews, {{with many}} commentators praising {{the performance of}} Rob Lowe, whose character is usually physically fit to almost superhuman proportions but becomes extremely ill and hallucinatory when infected with the flu. Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter said Lowe's character now seemed well-integrated into the cast, adding [...] "If you've never believed Lowe can make you laugh out loud, pay attention to that episode." [...] Steve Kandell of New York magazine said Lowe stole the show from the usual Parks powerhouses of Offerman and Pratt, and called one scene, when Lowe tries to will away his flu by yelling to <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> [...] "Stop...pooping!", the [...] "single greatest self-effacingly comic moment of his long, handsome career". The Atlantic writer Scott Meslow said after two episodes, the pairing of Chris and Ann was already more interesting that Ann's entire relationship with Mark Brendanawicz in the second season, and that the new romance subplot allowed the normally [...] "" [...] Rashida Jones to display her comedic talents. Entertainment Weekly writer Hillary Busis said Chris [...] "really came into his own" [...] in the episode, and also said that Ann's relationship with Chris made her character more interesting and gave Jones greater comedic material to work with.|$|E
2500|$|Sulayman donned an {{impressive}} green robe and turban and seeing <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> commented {{on how he}} {{looked to be in}} the prime of life. A week later he was dead. He died on either September 22 or October 1, 717. Al-Tabari records the following anecdote: [...] "According to 'Ali--Suhaym b.

2500|$|In 1987—reportedly on the {{recommendation}} of an astrologer that the number nine was auspicious—Ne Win ordered the withdrawal of several large-denomination kyat notes while issuing new denominations of 45 and 90 kyats. [...] Both 45 and 90 are divisible by nine, and their numerals add up to nine. The many Burmese whose saved money in the old large denominations lost their life savings. This crippled the Burmese economy further still. [...] Ne Win was well known for his penchant for numerology and yadaya (rituals performed in order to ward off misfortune). When his soothsayer warned him {{that there might be a}} bloodbath, he would stand in front of a mirror and trample on meat to simulate the blood then shoot <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> to avert the possibility of an assassination attempt.|$|E
5000|$|... "Wonderful World" [...] is {{the first}} release that {{introduces}} the [...] "8 Uppers" [...] storyline to the public. The regular edition CD cover displays each member displaying their character's trademark characteristics, such as Shibutani {{sitting on top of}} the Volkswagen Type 2 pointing a gun Murakami holding a pot, alluding to his weapon which is a butterfly knife converted into a fork. Maruyama is balancing a broom stick, which he uses <b>in</b> <b>the</b> movie as an impromptu weapon. Yasuda is playing a video game and Ohkura is checking <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> van's <b>mirror.</b>|$|R
60|$|He shaved {{and put on}} clean things, and {{his best}} coat, and {{surveyed}} <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> little <b>mirror.</b> He saw a thin face, white as marble, {{but he was not}} ashamed of it. His story was there to read, if any one had kind enough eyes to see. What would Helen think of him--and Margaret Maynard--and Dal--and Mel Iden? Bitter curiosity seemed his strongest feeling concerning his fiancee. He would hold her as engaged to him until she informed him she was not. As for the others, thought of them quickened his interest, especially in Mel. What had happened to her.|$|R
50|$|This {{psychological}} effect {{is often used}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cinema, where an actor will be shown apparently looking at <b>himself</b> or herself <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror.</b> What viewers see is different from what the actor sees, because the camera is not right behind the actor, but {{the position of the}} actor is often chosen so that his or her image is nicely framed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> for <b>the</b> camera.|$|R

6000|$|The {{scene is}} again COKESON'S room, {{at a few}} minutes to ten of a [...] March morning, two years later. The doors are all open.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{elemental}} discussions in ‘irfân nadzâri (theoretical mysticism), <b>in</b> <b>the</b> section where its adherents discuss ontology, is the debate surrounding the degrees of God’s manifestation. The {{reason for this is}} that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mystic’s view real existence, or the reality of existence, is the existence of the Truth (i. e. God) who manifests <b>Himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> degrees and <b>mirrors</b> that are <b>the</b> manifold creatures of the world...|$|R
60|$|Even so, {{he did not}} at once {{grasp the}} full strangeness of the scene he had just witnessed. It was only {{as he turned to}} descend again that he caught another glimpse of <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> big <b>mirror,</b> and saw that he was still making the most horrible and ghastliest grimaces--grimaces such as he had never seen equalled save by the monkeys at the Zoo, and (horridest thought of all!) by <b>the</b> worst {{patients}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mental-disease ward. He pulled <b>himself</b> up <b>in</b> speechless horror, and looked once more into <b>the</b> big <b>mirror.</b> Yes, there was positively no mistaking the fact: it was he, Arthur Greatrex, fellow of Catherine's, who was making these hideous and meaningless distortions of his own countenance.|$|R

6000|$|Nor did he pause {{until he}} had emerged from the forest and crossed the plains, and reached at last the city from whence he had escaped in the balloon. And, once again in his old lodgings, he looked at <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> and said: ...|$|E
50|$|The Earl's son, the Viscount and {{the future}} groom, is foppish and effeminate to the last degree and made to look {{absolutely}} ridiculous. He has obviously just returned from the Continent and is dressed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> French style, with a giant black bow in his wig and red raised heels to his shoes (Hogarth hated the French, see for example Plate III and The Gate of Calais). He is quite indifferent to the proceedings and has his back to his future wife, and is admiring <b>himself</b> vapidly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror.</b> He has a glittering ring and is taking snuff from his gold snuffbox. The device of looking into a mirror is a double indication that the heir is both vain and narcissistic.|$|R
5000|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> film, Sadako {{appears to}} Ryuji when he dies, {{crawling}} out of <b>the</b> TV set. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> book, Ryuji merely sees {{a reflection of}} <b>himself</b> horribly aged <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror.</b> However, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1995 TV movie, Sadako also appears, albeit not crawling out of a TV set, instead she merely materializes to {{out of thin air}} as Ryuji is slowly dancing with Mai Takano, and is only visible to Ryuji (we see it cutting to Mai's POV for a while and we see that the place where Ryuji seeks Sadako is empty).|$|R
60|$|This was not {{the first}} time that Mr. Bulstrode had begun by admonishing Mr. Vincy, and had ended by seeing a very {{unsatisfactory}} reflection of <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> coarse unflattering <b>mirror</b> which that manufacturer's mind presented to the subtler lights and shadows of his fellow-men; and perhaps his experience ought to have warned him how the scene would end. But a full-fed fountain will be generous with its waters even <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rain, when they are worse than useless; and a fine fount of admonition is apt to be equally irrepressible.|$|R

60|$|He was {{thinking}} of Istra as {{he lay on his}} bed. In a few minutes he dashed to his bureau and brushed his thinning hair so nervously that he had to try three times for a straight parting.

60|$|When {{they were}} alone once more Seth set about {{clearing}} away {{the remnants of the}} feast, and while he was thus employed Dan paced to and fro, admiring <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> as he passed and repassed it in such attitudes as he believed befitted a boy who was the lessee of such a swell apartment.|$|E
60|$|He {{got out of}} bed {{and looked}} at <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> long <b>mirror</b> on <b>the</b> {{wardrobe}} door. He wasn't pretty. The old-time lean cheeks were gone. These were heavy, seeming to hang down by their own weight. He looked for the lines of cruelty Dede had spoken of, and he found them, and he found <b>the</b> harshness <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eyes as well, the eyes that were muddy now after all the cocktails of the night before, and of the months and years before. He looked at the clearly defined pouches that showed under his eyes, and they've shocked him. He rolled up the sleeve of his pajamas. No wonder the hammer-thrower had put his hand down. Those weren't muscles. A rising tide of fat had submerged them. He stripped off the pajama coat. Again he was shocked, this time but the bulk of his body. It wasn't pretty. The lean stomach had become a paunch. The ridged muscles of chest and shoulders and abdomen had broken down into rolls of flesh.|$|R
5000|$|In 2004, Ravi Teja co-starred in Venky, {{directed}} by Srinu Vaitla. Idlebrain wrote, [...] "His comedy {{is very good}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first half.

He appeared in Naa Autograph {{directed by}} cinematographer turned director S. Gopal Reddy. A critic from nowrunning.com wrote, [...] "Ravi Teja delivers a stunning performance as a dejected lover". [...] Chanti was directed by Sobhan [...] In 2005, Ravi Teja's work included Bhadra directed by Boyapati Srinu and Bhageeratha, directed by Rasool Ellore.

50|$|The {{music video}} for Nothing But You is filmed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{style of the}} Reflections album. It {{includes}} various images of the streets of Cape Town, South Africa and follows a girl who climbs {{to the top of}} her apartment to the roof as a boy does the same {{on the other side of}} the street, interspersed with shots of Paul van Dyk in his apartment suite doing various mundane activities, reflecting on <b>himself</b> whilst looking <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror,</b> cleaning his hands, eating dinner and watching football on the TV with a glum look on his face. At various points <b>in</b> <b>the</b> video, Paul van Dyk looks up at the unnamed girl and thinks to <b>himself,</b> but <b>in</b> <b>the</b> end does nothing, whilst she connects with the boy on the opposite side. The girl and boy both climb down and they meet <b>in</b> <b>the</b> street where they inevitably kiss. The meaning behind this video probably reflects on the vocals of the song; while Paul van Dyk has all the money and flashy apartments, he is still unhappy at the thought of being alone, whilst the girl and boy are happy despite not having anything but each other.|$|R
