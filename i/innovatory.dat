While the practicalities of achieving this bridge remain dubious, the idea was a bold and expansive one.|$|E

500|$|Noye's Fludde {{has been}} {{described}} by the musicologist Arnold Whittall as a forerunner of Britten's church parables of the 1960s, and by the composer's biographer Paul Kildea as a hybrid work, [...] "as much a cantata as an opera". Most of the orchestral writing, says the music analyst Eric Roseberry, lies [...] "well within the range of intelligent young players of very restricted technique". Several episodes of the opera – such as [...] "the grinding conflict of Britten's passacaglia theme against Dykes's familiar hymn-tune in the storm" [...] – introduces listeners and the youthful performers to what Roseberry terms [...] "a contemporary idiom of dissonance", in contrast to the [...] "outworn style" [...] of most music written for the young. With its <b>innovatory</b> arrangement of vocal and instrumental forces, Noye's Fludde is summarised by Whittall as [...] "a brilliant demonstration of how to combine the relatively elementary instrumental and vocal skills of amateurs with professionals to produce a highly effective piece of music theatre." ...|$|E
500|$|Mendelssohn was a noted conductor, {{both of his}} own {{works and}} of those by other composers. At his London debut in 1829, he was noted for his <b>innovatory</b> use of a baton (then a great novelty). But his novelty also {{extended}} to taking great care over tempo, dynamics and the orchestral players themselves– both rebuking {{them when they were}} recalcitrant and praising them when they satisfied him. It was his success at conducting at the Lower Rhine music festival of 1836 that led to him taking his first paid professional position as director at Düsseldorf. Amongst those who appreciated Mendelssohn's conducting was Hector Berlioz, who in 1843, invited to Leipzig, exchanged batons with Mendelssohn, writing [...] "When the Great Spirit sends us to hunt in the land of souls, may our warriors hang our tomahawks side by side {{at the door of the}} council chamber". At Leipzig, Mendelssohn led the Gewandhaus orchestra to great heights; although concentrating on the great composers of the past (already becoming canonised as the 'classics') he also included new music by Schumann, Berlioz, Gade and many others (including of course his own music). One critic who was not impressed was Richard Wagner; he accused Mendelssohn of using tempos in his performances of Beethoven symphonies that were far too fast.|$|E
500|$|Britten's close {{friendship}} with Rostropovich inspired the Cello Sonata (1961) and three suites for solo cello (1964–71). String quartets featured throughout Britten's composing career, from a student work in 1928 to his Third String Quartet (1975). The second Quartet, from 1945, {{was written in}} homage to Purcell; Mason considered it Britten's most important instrumental work to that date. Referring to this work, Keller writes of {{the ease with which}} Britten, relatively early in his compositional career, solves [...] "the modern sonata problem – the achievement of symmetry and unity within an extended ternary circle based on more than one subject". Keller likens the <b>innovatory</b> skill of the Quartet to that of Walton's Viola Concerto. The third Quartet was Britten's last major work; the critic Colin Anderson said of it in 2007, [...] "one of Britten's greatest achievements, one with interesting allusions to Bartók and Shostakovich, and written with an economy that opens out a depth of emotion that can be quite chilling." [...] The Gemini Variations (1965), for flute, violin and piano duet, were based on a theme of Zoltán Kodály and written as a virtuoso piece for the 13-year-old Jeney twins, musical prodigies whom Britten had met in Budapest in the previous year. For Osian Ellis, Britten wrote the Suite for Harp (1969), which Joan Chissell in The Times described as [...] "a little masterpiece of concentrated fancy".|$|E
500|$|Section 7 {{creates the}} [...] "broad and <b>innovatory</b> offence" [...] {{of the failure}} of {{commercial}} organisations to prevent bribery on their behalf. This applies to all commercial organisations which have business in the UK. Unlike corporate manslaughter, this does not only apply to the organisation itself; individuals and employees may also be found guilty. The offence is one of strict liability, with no need to prove any kind of intention or positive action. It is also one of vicarious liability; a commercial organisation can be guilty of the offence if the bribery is carried out by an employee, an agent, a subsidiary, or another third-party, as found in Section 8. The location of the third-party is irrelevant to the prosecution— according to David Aaronberg and Nichola Higgins in the Archbold Review, [...] "therefore, a German business with retail outlets in the UK which pays a bribe in Spain could, in theory at least, face prosecution in the UK". Under Section 7(2), the commercial organisation has a defence if it can show that, while bribery did take place, the commercial organisation had in place [...] "adequate procedures designed to prevent persons associated with [...] from undertaking such conduct". Under the Act's explanatory notes, the burden of proof in this situation is on the organisation, with the standard of proof being [...] "on the balance of probabilities".|$|E

[...] Matthew Horton of BBC joked about {{the climax of the}} song, stating that the album 4 [...] "was named after the four key changes in the final, teetering chorus of 'Love on Top' to ram the point home." [...] Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune commended the song for putting a [...] "bounce" [...] in Beyoncé's step. Similarly, Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone named [...] "Love On Top" [...] "a blast" [...] as Beyoncé creates a modern take on old-school Whitney Houston. Hamish MacBain of NME favored the song's up-tempo style, stating that it was much needed after the [...] "ballad-heavy" [...] first half of the album. Priya Elan of the same publication commented that it has [...] "100 watt smile lyrics". Stating that [...] "Love On Top" [...] is reminiscent of 1980s RB&, Erika Ramirez of Billboard magazine complimented the song as a [...] "Halcyon love song, perfect to be whisked away to". Spence D. of IGN commented that Beyoncé's [...] "cheery disposition" [...] and the [...] "brash horns" [...] will remind listeners of [...] "damn good" [...] mid-1980s R can be. While including the song as a [...] "must hear" [...] from the album, Andy Gill of The Independent named [...] "Love On Top" [...] as [...] "a small footnote to Stevie Wonder's <b>innovatory</b> genius."

2500|$|Facilitated by its flourishing textile industry, Oldham {{developed}} extensive {{structural and}} mechanical engineering sectors during the 18th and 19th centuries. The manufacture of spinning and weaving machinery in Oldham {{belongs to the}} last decade of the 19th century, when it became a leading centre in the field of engineering. The Platt Brothers, originated in nearby Dobcross village, but moved to Oldham. They were pioneers of cotton-spinning machinery, developing <b>innovatory</b> products which enabled the mass-production of cotton yarn. Platt Brothers became the largest textile machine makers in the world, employing over [...] people in the 1890s, twice the number of their nearest rivals Dobson & Barlow in Bolton and Asa Lees on Greenacres Moor. They were keen investors in the local area and at one time, were supporting 42% of the population. The centre of the company lay at the New Hartford Works in Werneth, a massive complex of buildings and internal railways on a site overlooking Manchester. The railway station which served this site later formed the basis of Oldham Werneth railway station. The main building exists to this day. Platts gained prestigious awards from around the world, and were heavily involved with local politics and civic pride in Oldham. John and James Platt were the largest subscribers for promoting Oldham from a township to a Borough; pledging £100 (more than double of the next largest sum) in advance towards any expenses which may have been incurred by the Royal Charter. In 1854 John Platt was made the (fourth) Mayor of Oldham, an office he was to hold twice more in 185556 and 186162. John Platt was elected in 1865 to become MP for Oldham, and was re-elected in 1868; he remained in office until his death in 1872. A bronze statue of Platt existed in the town centre for years, though was moved to Alexandra Park. There have been recommendations for it to be returned to the town centre.|$|E
