Significant interaction of row arrangement × intercropping time of <b>haricot</b> bean was observed with respect to leaf area index (LAI) of the maize crop. Increasing trends of LAI of maize crop were observed as interseeding of <b>haricot</b> bean was delayed for 3 weeks after maize (WAM) that stabilized during the 6 WAM interseeding time. Maize stover production was significantly high at 1 : 2 row ratio and delaying of the undersowing <b>haricot</b> bean in the already established maize crop for 6 weeks, 10. 94 tha - 1 and 11. 39 t ha - 1, respectively. Maize grain yield showed a significant variation with respect to the staggered sowing of <b>haricot</b> bean, whereby the highest (3. 99 t ha - 1) being recorded when <b>haricot</b> bean intercropping was delayed for 21 days after maize planting. The data of this study revealed that the larger maize plant canopy providing larger photosynthetic area, attained when <b>haricot</b> bean interseeding was delayed, probably resulted in higher grain yield of maize.

2500|$|The term [...] "Creole music" [...] {{is used to}} {{describe}} both the early folk or roots music traditions of French and Metis rural Creoles of South Louisiana and the later more contemporary genre called Zydeco. It was often simply called French music or La La. It was sung in French patois by Creoles. [...] This early American roots music evolved in the 1930s into a richer sound accompanied by more instruments. Creole pioneer Amede Ardoin {{is said to be}} the first Creole to record this indigenous music. [...] He has also been credited for greatly influencing the foundation of Cajun music. Melodies from pioneers like Ardoin provided a basis for works by composers Louis Moreau Gottschalk and Moses Hogan and others. [...] Creole music traditions in the US have been known to change and evolve as quickly as they were being replicated by white artists, the music of the Creoles also eveolved into a more contemporary amplified sound that was later called zydeco, which is the indigenous music of the Creoles or [...] "Creole music". Zydeco comes from French [...] "les haricots," [...] meaning snap or green beans as in [...] "les <b>haricots</b> (ne) sont pas salés (the beans are not seasoned (with salt pork) because times are hard right now). Zydeco fused the traditional Creole roots music sang in French with contemporary sounds making it relevant, dynamic and constantly attracting a new generation of listeners within the Creole community as well as outside the community. This fusion was birthed in the Creole lala, jazz and blues halls (joints) of Frenchtown, Houston, Texas which were frequented by Creole immigrants from West Louisiana and East Texas.|$|E

6000|$|Grandcourt had two grave {{purposes}} {{in coming to}} Gadsmere: to convey the news of his approaching marriage in person, {{in order to make}} this first difficulty final; and to get from Lydia his mother's diamonds, which long ago he had confided to her and wished her to wear. Her person suited diamonds, and made them look as if they were worth some of the money given for them. These particular diamonds were not mountains of light--they were mere peas and <b>haricots</b> for the ears, neck and hair; but they were worth some thousands, and Grandcourt necessarily wished to have them for his wife. Formerly when he had asked Lydia to put them into his keeping again, simply on the ground that they would be safer and ought to be deposited at the bank, she had quietly but absolutely refused, declaring that they were quite safe; and at last had said, [...] "If you ever marry another woman I will give them up to her: are you going to marry another woman?" [...] At that time Grandcourt had no motive which urged him to persist, and he had this grace in him, that the disposition to exercise power either by cowing or disappointing others or exciting in them a rage which they dared not express--a disposition which was active in him as other propensities became languid--had always been in abeyance before Lydia. A severe interpreter might say that the mere facts of their relation to each other, the melancholy position of this woman who depended on his will, made a standing banquet for his delight in dominating. But there was something else than this in his forbearance toward her: there was the surviving though metamorphosed effect of the power she had had over him; and it was this effect, the fitful dull lapse toward solicitations that once had the zest now missing from life, which had again and again inclined him to espouse a familiar past rather than rouse himself to the expectation of novelty.

40|$|The Improving Productivity and Market Success (IPMS) of Ethiopian Farmers project {{adopted a}} “participatory market {{oriented}} commodity value chain development” approach, to address problems and potentials for <b>haricot</b> bean production in Alaba Special District, in Southern Ethiopia. With an emerging export market potential, attention {{needs to be}} paid {{not only to the}} production of <b>haricot</b> beans but also to the supply of inputs and services and marketing. Major problems diagnosed by the value chain partners included poor access to inputs including seeds, weed and disease problems, poor technology adoption and marketing of <b>haricot</b> bean. To address the above problems, various development actors developed <b>haricot</b> bean commodity with the IPMS project and Alaba Special District Office of Agriculture and Rural Development (OoARD) introduced value chain interventions {{for the past five years}} (2005 to 2010). Initial intervention focused at building farmers capacity to multiply seed and establish seed bank using visits, trainings, demonstration, workshops, promotion and discussion. Later, to improve supply of inputs (seeds, fertilizer and agro-chemicals) support was provided to establish cooperative shop, private crop protection service and revolving fund with IPMS credit fund while comparing soil fertility technologies. Additional effort also focused at marketing of small pack, promotion of <b>haricot</b> bean, market linkage and establishment of seed cooperative. Findings show an increase in farmers’ market participation from 54. 5 % in 2004 during baseline survey to 92 % in 2009 during sample household survey. There is an increase in the proportion of farmers’ producing seed and change in focus from household consumption to seed business in targeted 19 PAs (Peasant Association). Survey results show a higher yield (9. 5 qt/ha) among fertilizer users compared with non users (7. 2 qt/ha). On-farm yield plot trial (n= 387) with 129 households (HH) in 17 PAs for three years shows mean yield of 7. 04, 4. 1 and 2. 76 qt/ha for chemical fertilizer, <b>haricot</b> bean inoculants and control plots respectively. Farmers have clearly indicated their preference for the red and/or speckled varieties to white varieties. Increase in <b>haricot</b> bean seed multipliers from 64 HH in 4 PA to 426 HH in 19 PAs resulted in establishment of seed cooperative. While more actors are increasingly involved in value chain development leading to market oriented production, there is informal partnership and poor linkage among value chain actors. The study draws lessons on increasing production of <b>haricot</b> bean, strengthening input supply system and development of market intervention. On the basis of the findings, the paper outlines challenges, lessons and provides recommendations to improve existing value chain for development partners.

The country’s export earning from <b>haricot</b> bean exceeds that of other pulses such as lentils, horse bean and chickpea. Low production and productivity, which are mainly associated with poor adoption of improved technologies and poor marketing system, were among the major problems. Adoption of improved technologies {{is one of the}} most promising ways to reduce food insecurity in Ethiopia. However, the adoption and dissemination of these technologies is constrained by various factors. To this end, the aim of this study was to empirically examine factors affecting adoption and intensity of adoption of improved <b>haricot</b> bean production package in the study area. Two stage sampling procedure was followed to select rural kebeles and households for the study. Four rural kebeles were selected purposively, and 160 household heads were selected randomly using probability proportional to size sampling. Structured interview schedule was developed, pre-tested and used for collecting the essential quantitative data for the study from the sampled households. Focus group discussion was used to generate qualitative data. In addition, secondary data were collected from relevant sources such as woreda office of agriculture and rural development and others. The result of the study indicated that majority of farmers in the study area preferred local variety over improved because of local market and consumption demand. Moreover, farmers’ practice was found largely to deviate from research and extension recommendations. Result of the econometric model indicated that household head’s attitude towards <b>haricot</b> bean production technology package, participation in extension event (participation in training and field visit) and access to credit were important variables which had positively and significantly influenced adoption and intensity of adoption of improved <b>haricot</b> bean production package. Where as, perceived relative disadvantage of technology attributes of the household head had shown negative relationship with adoption and intensity of adoption. Some farmers who previously adopted improved <b>haricot</b> bean varieties have discontinued planting the varieties mainly due to market problem. The overall finding of the study underlined the high importance of institutional support in the areas of extension; credit and market to enhance adoption of improved <b>haricot</b> bean production package. Therefore, policy and development interventions should give emphasis to improvement of such institutional support system so as to achieve wider adoption, increased productivity and income to small scale farmers.

In the area, <b>haricot</b> bean is an important crop, which serves as a source of food and cash. A total of 150 sample households (131 male and 19 female) selected from 5 kebeles of the Woreda were interviewed using structured interview schedule. Qualitative data were collected using group discussion and field observation. Data analysis was done with the help SPSS 17; mainly Chi-square test, F-test Cramer’s V, and Pearson Correlation. Tobit econometrics model was employed using STATA 11. The results of the econometric model indicated that the relative influence of different variables on probability and intensity of adoption of improved <b>haricot</b> bean production Thus,,sex of house hold head,, attending training on improved <b>haricot</b> bean production, attending field day programs, conducting demonstration, access to improved seed credit and membership of seed multiplication group were positively and significantly influenced where as market distance negatively influenced adoption and intensity of adoption of improved <b>haricot</b> bean varieties and associated agronomic practices. Farmers’ evaluation and selection criteria of improved <b>haricot</b> bean varieties in the study area in order of importance were high yielding, market demand, price advantage, time of maturity, grain color, grain size, disease resistance and storability. Based on these criteria Nasir variety ranks first and dimtu variety ranks second. In addition, majority of farmers in the study area used seed and fertilizer rates below research and extension recommendations. Farmers’ deviation from recommended package practices was found partly due to inadequate extension service, high cost of fertilizer and also lack of finance. The overall findings of the study underlined the high importance of extension service provision to improve farmers’ access to information and extension advices to address the recommended agronomic practices practically, facilitating access to credit and improving market condition, Attention has to be given to women household headed to participate in improved <b>haricot</b> bean production, Therefore development interventions should give emphasis to improvement of such institutional support systems to increase adoption and productivity of the crop.
