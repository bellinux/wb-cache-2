60|$|As he came {{he fixed}} his gaze upon a woman seated near the {{prostrate}} girl, {{and with a}} horrible outcry the victim leaped {{into the air and}} stiffened as if smitten with epilepsy. She fell against some scared boys, who let her fall, striking her head against the seats. She too rolled down upon the straw and lay beside <b>her</b> <b>sister.</b> <b>Both</b> <b>had</b> round, pretty, but childish faces.|$|R
50|$|Upon {{meeting a}} teenage Jean Grey who {{was brought to}} the present by Beast, Celeste takes an instant dislike towards her and they are {{constantly}} bickering. When Irma decides to change her hair style and act more like an individual, Celeste is horrified at the thought of losing her connection to <b>her</b> <b>sister.</b> Much to <b>her</b> despair, Emma welcomes the sisters' growing individuality.

50|$|It {{is unclear}} whether Sophia moved to the United States alone or with her family, as <b>her</b> <b>sister</b> and mother <b>had</b> <b>both</b> {{eventually}} lived in New York as well.

5000|$|Flower {{first came}} to public notice, however, within the Psalmody Movement of the 1830s and 40s in London when, on 4 November 1839, the Musical World noted that Sara and <b>her</b> <b>sister</b> Elizabeth <b>had</b> <b>both</b> {{appeared}} at a lecture given at the Hoxton National School Room in inner North London by Henry Charles Purday (1799-1885), engaged, presumably, in order to demonstrate the argument of Purday's lecture, entitled, 'The Proper Object of Music'. The Movement in Britain was associated with such names as Sarah Ann Glover, John Hullah and John Curwen. It had strong Independent, or Congregationalist non-conformist religious leanings, and a powerful utilitarian sociology. Flower was also believed to be connected with John Hullah's extraordinarily successful singing classes in London's Exeter Hall, and possibly with [...] "Music for the Million", the singing school of Joseph Mainzer (1801-1851). It had been modeled, essentially, {{along the lines of}} the very structured monitorial method of Guillaume Louis Bocquillon Wilhem 1781-1842 and his 'Orphéon' choral fests) as a means of teaching large masses of often illiterate working people to sight-sing from notation sheets. While it was socially rather than musically motivated, and was largely a non-conformist socio-religious project, it had the effect in the long term of revitalizing musical education in the wider sphere, not least, within the established Anglican Church itself.|$|R

40|$|Many {{previous}} studies have used sibling correlations to measure the effect of family background on earnings, income? and occupational status. This paper uses data on a sample of sisters to explore {{the importance of family}} background as a determinant of welfare program participation. The results show a strikingly high degree of sibling resemblance in welfare receipt. For example, a woman's estimated probability of having participated in welfare programs is. 20 if <b>her</b> <b>sister</b> <b>has</b> not participated, but is -. 66 if <b>her</b> <b>sister</b> <b>has</b> participated. ...|$|R
