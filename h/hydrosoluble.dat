Although both <b>hydrosoluble</b> and lipophilic extracts inhibited pyrene sorption, they acted at different processes on soil organic matters (SOMs) and dissolved organic matters (DOMs). The analysis of three-dimensional fluorescence excitation-emission matrix spectroscopy revealed that the intensity of soluble humic-like substances increased from 5. 73 in the bulk treatment to 7. 74, 6. 36, and 8. 67 in treatments with <b>hydrosoluble,</b> lipophilic and hydrosoluble[*]+[*]lipophilic components, respectively. Images of DOMs by atomic force microscopy illustrated that the <b>hydrosoluble</b> extract greatly expanded the DOMs particles, while the lipophilic slightly shrank them.

40|$|Les polymères <b>hydrosolubles</b> utilisés dans les opérations pétrolières (forage, cimentation, stimulation, récupération assistée) peuvent être d'origine très variée (polymères naturels, de fermentation, semi-synthétiques et synthétiques). Leur {{utilisation}} et leur efficacité sont directement liées à la connaissance de la relation existant entre leur structure chimique (macrostructure et microstructure) et leurs propriétés en solution. Ce rapport fait la synthèse des divers types de polymères <b>hydrosolubles</b> qui ont un intérêt pratique et définit les paramètres structuraux et fonctionnels gouvernant leur efficacité {{en fonction}} d'un certain nombre de paramètres extérieurs (pH, salinité, température). The capacity of water-soluble polymers {{to modify the}} rheology of aqueous solutions explains their importance for various oil-recovery operations. The choice of the most appropriate polymer depends on its molecular and macromolecular properties in solution, which {{are closely related to}} the nature of their primary, secondary and tertiary structures and of their microstructure. This article describes the different types of water-soluble polymers that are of practical interest, and it defines the structural and functional parameters that govern their efficacy as a function of external parameters (pH, salinity and temperature). There are four main types of polymers, depending on their origin. They are :(a) Natural biopolymers (of vegetable origin) and biotechnological biopolymers (produced by microorganisms), i. e. neutral and/or charged polysaccharides. (b) Modified biopolymers having synthetic side chains. (c) Polyvinylsaccharides (synthetic side chains). (d) Synthetic polymers. For all of them, it is indispensable to know the relationship between structure, conformation and functional properties. The solubility in water and the properties in solution of polysaccharides depend on four main factors: (i) the presence of branched chains, (ii) the presence of charged groups, (iii) the nature of the intermotive bonds, and (iv) the nonuniformity of the repetition structure. Natural polysaccharides can be used either directly or after having been modified to optimize their properties (such as derivatives formed from cellulose and guar gum. Polysaccharides from fermentation (xanthan, scleroglucan) have a unique rheological behavior in relation to the existence of rigid ordered conformations in solution, and their stability range depends on external conditions of pH, salinity and temperature. Water-soluble synthetic polymers and copolymers hold a very important position. Their properties in solution depend to a great extent on their anionicity, on the flexibility of the main chain and on the presence of more or less cluttered side chains. Among these latterk sodium acrylamide/acrylate copolymers resulting from the partial posthydrolysis of polyacrylamide or obtained by direct copolymerization are widely used despite their triple instability (low tolerance to divalent ions, limited mechanical strength and chemical stability), which results in their losing their viscosifying properties (and in the appearance of phase separation). Changing the structural parameters (introducing steric constraints) and functional parameters (replacing carboxylic functions by sulfonic functions) governing their properties in solution greatly improves their resistance to salts and temperature...|$|R
40|$|Exopolysaccharides, biopolymers or <b>hydrosolubles</b> gums, are {{produced}} by {{a great variety of}} microorganisms and possess physical, structural and chemical properties quite homogeneous, in relation to derived from algae and plants. The production is relatively independent on climatic conditions, faster obtaining of the finished product and need small space. Biopolymers have been studied thoroughly in the last years. Due to wide diversity in structure and physical properties, the microbial polysaccharides possess a lot of applications in food, pharmaceutical, oil, cosmetics, textile, inks and agricultural products among others industries. Some of those applications, include uses as emulsifying, stabilizing, binding, jellifying, clotting, lubricants, film coated, thickening and suspender agents. The parameters that have most influenced the process of exopolysaccharides biosyntheses have been the microorganism, the culture medium composition, pH and temperature of incubation. The exopolysaccharide production can be developed by species of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, some microalgae and many moulds. This work discusses the influence of these parameters during the production process and exopolysaccharides biosyntheses by bacteria.

At first, we have studied the structure and the synthesis method of self-assembled amphiphilic molecules on carbon nanotubes. These self-assemblies lead to the formation of water soluble nanorings with a hydrophobic domain. In this study, we have synthesized several amphiphilic molecules to obtain strong nanorings and developed a new separation procedure to improve nanoring extraction. The characterization of the nanoring structure has been realized by various techniques and particularly by small angle neutron scattering. Also, we have evaluated the nanorings as vectors for pharmaceutical applications. This nanovector exhibits the required characteristics for drug delivery such as the capability to incorporate a large amount of hydrophobic drugs and to increase their water solubility. Finally, the nanorings have showed no in-vitro nor in-vivo toxicities during preliminary toxicological studies. Au cours de ce travail, nous nous sommes interesses a la synthese et a l'evaluation d'anneaux de tensio-actifs construits a la surface de nanotube de carbone comme agents de vectorisation de principe actifs. Dans un premier temps, nous avons etudie la structure et le mode de synthese d'amphiphiles auto-assembles sur support de nanotube de carbone. Ces auto-assemblages conduisent a la formation de nanobagues <b>hydrosolubles</b> possedant un domaine hydrophobe.

40|$|White rot fungi are {{the only}} organisms capable to {{mineralize}} the lignin to CO 2. These fungi posses at least three enzymes impicated in the process: lignin peroxidase, manganese dependent peroxidase and laccase. The screening of 13 strains of white-rot fungi showed that F. sclerodermeus was the more efficient ligninase producer fungus and the decolorization of the polymeric dye poly R was fast. Lip activity was not detected {{in any of the}} media tested. Optimal media conditions for laccase and MnP production in synthetic liquid media were found. The Doehlert uniform factorial experimental design was applied to study the effect of MnSO 4, CuSO 4 and asparagine. Among the aromatic compounds evaluated in GA medium, vanillin and fenilic acid were the more efficient laccase and MnP inducers. On the other hand, in semidefined medium (YPG) aromatic compounds had not effect on any activity. Under this conditions only copper and Mn increased laccase and MnP activities, respectively. Solid state fermentation on wheat or soy bran, high laccase and MnP were produced. Neither aromatic compounds, MnSO 4 nor CuSO 4 increased none of the activities. The effect on known ligninolytic inducers was studied on a crystalline cellulose (CC) based medium. Cellulolytic activities decreased 3 -fold when CuSO 4 or MnSO 4 were added to the medium. MnP activity was only detected in the media containing MnSO 4 as inducer, while the laccase activity was constitutiver expressed under all the conditions tested, and it was increased to a major extent when copper was added to the medium. Wood blocks of poplar incubated during six months with F. sclerodermeus registered dry weight losses of 51 %. Differential hydrolysis of the wood blocks revealed that the remaining content of cellulose and lignin were 58 y 56 %, respectively. On the other hand, the <b>hydrosolubles</b> increased 3 -fold, due to the degradation products. Observation of the wood showed the degradation of parenchyma rays and thinning of the cell walls. Growing on sawdust medium, enzyme activities were produced only with poplar, whereas on cedar laccase and MnP were inhibited. Laccase and MnP produced in YPG medium by F. sclerodcrmeus were purified to electrophoretic homogeneity and characterized biochemically. Two isoenzymes of laccase (Lac I y Lac II) and two MnP (MnP I y MnP II) were found. Isoforms of both systems showed slight differences in their isoelectric points. Laccase activity produced on wheat bran based medium revealed three bands in PAGE with differential patterns of inactivation. Among the compounds tested, the CuSO 4 1, 25 mM was the best stabilizer. The combination of both CuSO 4 and glycerol 0, 2 % further increased the stability of the enzyme. Laccase activity produced in the optimized conditions was used in assays of decoloration and detoxification of the fungicide malachite green. P. chrysosporium was used as biotest, this Fungus showed a high sensitivity to the fungicide, while degradation by F. sclerodermeus laccase rendered a not toxic compound. The presence of I-HBT accelerated the detoxification. The detoxification response of other white-rot fungi was similar to that observed for P. chrysosporium. Fil:Papinutti, Víctor Leandro.

40|$|Depuis quelques années la {{pollution}} par les métaux lourds et devenue un problème important pour la protection de l'environnement et de nombreuses méthodes ont été développées pour éliminer les métaux toxiques présents dans l'eau. Parmi les différents procédés utilisés, la complexation-ultrafiltration est bien connue et de nombreuses études sur ce sujet sont décrites dans la littérature. Cependant, le choix de nouveaux macroligands <b>hydrosolubles</b> demeure important pour développer cette technologie. L'un des objectifs de ce travail était de montrer que dans ce procédé un biopolymère peut remplacer un macroligand de synthèse. Les expériences ont été menées avec de l'alginate de sodium, polysaccharide extrait des algues brunes, et porteur de groupements carboxyliques et hydroxydes capables de complexer les cations. Notre étude se divise {{en trois}} parties. Après avoir décrit, dans la première, le matériau et les méthodes utilisées, nous étudions dans la seconde les conditions de l'ultrafiltration (seuil de coupure, pression appliquée, pH, concentration), avant de discuter dans la troisième les résultats obtenus dans le traitement de solutions contenant Cd 2 +, Cu 2 +, Mn 2 + and Pb 2 +. For some years past, pollution by heavy metals {{has become one}} of the main problems for environmental protection. A number of methods have been developed to remove toxic metals from water. Among the various processes used, complexation-ultrafiltration is well known and numerous studies on this subject are described in the literature. However, the choice of new water-soluble macroligands remains important for developing this technology. One aim of the present work was to prove that biopolymers can replace synthetic macroligands in the process. The experiments have been conducted with sodium alginate, a polysaccharide extracted from brown seaweeds and containing carboxylic and hydroxyl groups able to complex heavy cations. Filtration experiments were performed with a frontal system, equipped with a polysulfone membrane with a 20000 Daltons cut-off. The solutions studied were prepared by diluting in demineralized water either sodium alginate or "Titrisol Merck" for cations. Before filtration the two solutions were mixed and stirred for 20 min. The pH of the feed solutions was adjusted with HCl (or HNO 3 for Pb) or NaOH and determined accurately using a calibrated probe. The molecular weight of sodium alginate was determined by liquid chromatography and the viscosity was measured with either a viscosimeter for low values or a capillary method for concentrated solutions. Cation concentrations were measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometryBoth permeate and retentate macroligands concentrations were estimated from measurements of total organic carbon (TOC). Following each experiment, chemical cleaning was performed by filtration of HCl, NaOH and water. This procedure was followed by demineralized water filtration, to ensure that the initial permeability was restored. In the first part of the work the ultrafiltration of sodium alginate solutions for different concentrations and various pressures was studied. Experimental results for macroligand retention, deduced from the TOC values, show a total rejection. All the curves, permeate flux versus time, present the same profile which indicates a significant concentration polarization. According to the obtained results we chose the value of 5 10 - 2 g L- 1 for the ligand concentration and one bar for the applied pressure. In the second part of the study, the retention of cations (Cd 2 +, Cu 2 +, Mn 2 + and Pb 2 +) was investigated. The observed results show that the removal rates are close to 100 %. These values depend both on the total concentration of cation and on the pH value. The retention of cations is shown to depend strongly on pH: a variation of pH between 3 and 5 leads to changes in retention efficiency from 0 to 100 %. This can be explained by the dissociation of alginic acid as a function of pH. For lower pH values the macroligand is in a molecular form and the metallic cation remains free; for higher values metal complexation is possible, increasing the rejection. If coordination number, rejection rate and pH are known, the various association constants can be determined using a graphical method. It can be seen from the results that the stability of the complexes formed decreases in the sequence Pb>Cu>Mn>Cd. In order to investigate the retention of these cations in a fresh water, the influence of calcium hardness was studied. The results indicate that cation removal decreases when the calcium concentration increases. This observation is an important restriction for fresh water treatment but does not affect the elimination of metals from a solution or an industrial waste containing cations...|$|R

30|$|The {{mass ratio}} of the organosoluble to <b>hydrosoluble</b> {{extracts}} from the parental soils was 1.9 for the silty Soil A, dropping to 0.9 for the sandy Soil B (Table  2). This difference {{was due to the}} high amount of labile ORG 1 content present in Soil A, while Soil B was found more abundant in molecules held together by strongly bound esters (AQU 3 –ORG 3) and organominerals (RESOM). However, the relative percentage of compounds being common between the two soils was found to increase from ORG 1 to ORG 3, whereas no such an absolute trend was revealed for the <b>hydrosoluble</b> fractions AQU 2 -AQU 4 and RESOM (Table  2). This result suggests that the stabilization of organic matter in soils is mainly due to its organosoluble fraction, while the <b>hydrosoluble</b> components may be more easily subjected to abiotic and biotic transformations. This conclusion is in line with the supramolecular nature of SOM that implies a stabilization of humus by a progressive accumulation of lipophilic molecules in soil, due to their physical–chemical separation from aqueous media [52]. However, differences in the organosoluble to <b>hydrosoluble</b> mass ratios between the two soils {{may be related to the}} varying association of humic molecules with either silt or sand components, thereby forming SOM aggregates of different complexity and stability [53]. Therefore, a further investigation on the humeome of soil aggregates of different dimension and stability may enlarge our knowledge on the mechanisms of SOM sequestration.|$|E

This study demonstrates that the hydrogel cannot be considered merely as a carrier.

An anti–oxidant diet with natural bioactive components could become an interesting solution for degenerative disorders in which oxidative stress is increased.

We have applied an analogue strategy using hydrophilic substituents to obtain highly water soluble perylene diimides (4) and a new <b>hydrosoluble</b> coronene derivative (CORON, 6), whose molecular features appear particularly suitable for inducing G-quadruplex DNA structures and inhibiting human telomerase.

30|$|Ketoprofen is a non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug (NSAID) that inhibit cyclooxigenase (COX) enzymes which transforms {{arachidonic acid}} to prostaglandin, prostaeyelin, and thromboxane (Tomic et al. 2008). The sustained prostaglandin inhibition leads to sustained reduction in the renal blood flow and thus the renal syndrome ensues. The metabolism of ketoprofen in the liver is intensive, yielding <b>hydrosoluble</b> and liposoluble metabolites. Excessive doses lead to hepatotoxicity and kidney necrosis (Heo et al. 2008;Tomic et al. 2008).|$|E
40|$|Multicompartment {{micelles}} {{are complex}} nanosized systems that possess a <b>hydrosoluble</b> shell and a hydrophobic core, which {{is characterized by}} segregated incompatible sub-domains. With roots starting about ten years ago, the field of multicompartment micelles has evolved slowly, until recently when significant achievements have been made. The present article reviews strategies for building such micellar assemblies as well as morphological studies, highlights the future challenges, and discusses possible applications, which exploit the coexistence of differentiated nano-domains...|$|E

The resulting probes {{were shown to}} bind efficiently and selectively to Cys-tagged proteins. The interaction with the protein was detected by an increase of the fluorescence emission of CrAsH. While the latter faded rapidly under continuous excitation, emission of the QD remained unaffected. The persistent fluorescence of the QD should thus allow extended monitoring of the target protein...|$|E

40|$|Nowadays {{consumers}} seek {{foods that}} not only provide basic nutrition but also contain compounds that contribute to health. Thus, different products {{have been designed to}} meet this demand, especially those with probiotic and prebiotic characteristics. This study aimed to evaluate different formulations of a soy-based synbiotic beverage. The composition and process conditions were defined using a Placket & Burman factorial design in which the independent variables were process temperature, concentrations of the soy <b>hydrosoluble</b> extract and fructooligosaccharides (FOS) and the initial concentration of the probiotics Bifidobaterium longum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. Paracasei, Lactobacillus rhamnosus. Changes to the product by addition of sucrose, Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. Bulgaricus were also studied. Response parameters were: pH, cell concentration (plate counting), and quantification of fructooligosaccharides, acetic acid and lactic acid. The specific growth rate (μx) and change in cell count (Δx) were determined in each formulation. The soybean <b>hydrosoluble</b> extract was considered a good substrate for beverage production; FOS had a greater effect at lower concentrations. At the end of all fermentation tests the total probiotic count was greater than 7 log CFU/mL, meeting the legal requirements of a functional food. Lower temperatures were better for the growth of probiotics. The addition of sucrose resulted in a lower consumption of FOS by the fermenting microorganisms, while the presence of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus represented little change concerning the evaluated characteristics. Therefore, according to the results of this study, the production of a soy-based symbiotic fermented beverage can be performed using soybean <b>hydrosoluble</b> extract at 10 % (w/v), fructooligosaccharides at about 3 % (w/v), sucrose at 12 % (w/v), and the process temperature should be maintained at 35 ℃. Initial probiotic concentrations need not exceed 5 × 10 6 CFU/ml...|$|E

30|$|It {{is to be}} {{underlined}} {{that even}} though molecular formulae were distributed in statistical categories according to their degree of oxygenation and DBE, most of these categories always resulted into a mixture {{of different types of}} compounds. This suggests that interpretations of Van Krevelen results should not be based only on the empirical formulae stemming out from software programs accompanying high-resolution spectrometers, but they should be rather referred to the corresponding molecular structures, as further supported by chemical databases in silico [51]. In fact, careful structural interpretation by ChemSpider and PubChem databases of empirical formulae obtained from Orbitrap mass spectra revealed that organosoluble fractions of both soils were dominated by aliphatic AD and saccharide ET, while aromatic AD, HN and saccharide ET were predominant in the <b>hydrosoluble</b> fractions. Hence, saccharide ET was found to be the class of compounds common in all types of fractions in both soils, although these components were bound to aromatic moieties in the <b>hydrosoluble</b> fractions. Therefore, these findings indicate that saccharide ET compounds, such as flavanon glycosides, are recalcitrant in grassland soils and represent a stabilized component of SOM.|$|E
40|$|GC-MS and {{correlation}} analysis {{have been used}} • GC-MS showed that the lipid composition of different varieties of amaranth are very similar • GC-MS showed that the sugar composition of different varieties of amaranth are less similar Gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used for per-forming a qualitative analysis of liposoluble and <b>hydrosoluble</b> flour extracts of three genotypes of Amaranthus sp. All three samples were first defatted with hexane. Hexane extracts {{were used for the}} analysis of fatty acids of lipid components. TMSH (trimethylsulfonium hydroxide, 0. 2 M in methanol) was used as the transesterification reagent. With transesterification reaction, fatty acids were esterified from acilglycerol to methyl-esters. Defatted flour samples were dried in the air and then extracted with ethanol. Ethanol extracts were used for the analysis of soluble carbohydrates. TMSI (trimethylsilylimidazole) was used as a reagent for the derivatisation of carbohydrates into trimethyl-silylethers. The results show that the dominant methyl-esters of fatty acids are very similar in all the three samples. Such a similarity was not detected in the analysis of soluble sugars. The following test cluster analysis was used for the comparison of liposoluble and <b>hydrosoluble</b> flour extracts of three genotypes of Amaranthus sp...|$|E
