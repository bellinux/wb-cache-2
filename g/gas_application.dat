The model is made up of a mixing chamber that has the essential orifices for air and fuel (producer gas) inlets to generate stable stoichiometric mixture nearer to ambient conditions. The CFD simulations are carried out followed with experimental studies under engine simulation conditions using pressure controlling system to validate the analysis.

Whereas in conventional welding techniques process gas mainly is used as shielding gas, for preventing the weld bead from oxidation, in laser beam welding process gas in addition is needed for control of the laser induced plasma.

The use of other process gases than helium in laser beam welding can produce plasma shieling and in consequence process interruption caused by fluctuations in process or production parameters.
