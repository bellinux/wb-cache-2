5|$|Manetho's Epitome {{states that}} Amenhotep I ruled Egypt {{for twenty years}} and seven months or twenty-one years, {{depending}} on the source.

Thus, in the high chronology, Amenhotep I is given a reign <b>from</b> <b>around</b> 1546 to 1526 BC and, in the low chronology, <b>from</b> <b>around</b> 1526 to 1506 BC or 1525 to 1504 BC, though individual scholars may ascribe dates to his reign that vary from these by a few years.|$|E
