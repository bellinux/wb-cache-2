60|$|MY DEAR SIR,--Sapristi, comme vous y allez! Richard III. and Dumas, {{with all}} my heart: but not Hamlet.

60|$|I {{think it}} is no more than justice to him to say that the knowledge, where it has come to him, has come to him slowly; and I think it came (as most things of common sense come) rather vaguely and as in a vision--that is, by the mere look of things. The old Cobdenite {{employer}} was quite within his rights in arguing that earth is not heaven, that the best obtainable arrangement might contain many necessary evils; and that Liverpool and Belfast might be growing more prosperous as a whole in spite of pathetic things that might be seen there. But <b>I</b> <b>simply</b> <b>do</b> not believe {{he has been able to}} look at Liverpool and Belfast and continue to think this: that is why he has turned himself into a sham country gentleman. Earth is not heaven, but the nearest we can get to heaven ought not to look like hell; and Liverpool and Belfast look like hell, whether they are or not. Such cities might be growing prosperous as a whole, though a few citizens were more miserable. But it was more and more broadly apparent that it was exactly and precisely as a whole that they were not growing more prosperous, but only the few citizens who were growing more prosperous by their increasing misery. You could not say a country was becoming a white man's country when there were more and more black men in it every day. You could not say a community was more and more masculine when it was producing more and more women. Nor can you say that a city is growing richer and richer when more and more of its inhabitants are very poor men. There might be a false agitation founded on the pathos of individual cases in a community pretty normal in bulk. But the fact is that no one can take a cab across Liverpool without having a quite complete and unified impression that the pathos is not a pathos of individual cases, but a pathos in bulk. People talk of the Celtic sadness; but there are very few things in Ireland that look so sad as the Irishman in Liverpool. The desolation of Tara is cheery compared with the desolation of Belfast. I recommend Mr. Yeats and his mournful friends to turn their attention to the pathos of Belfast. I think if they hung up the harp that once in Lord Furness's factory, there would be a chance of another string breaking.|$|E

40|$|Theoretical Computer Science has {{developed}} an almost exclusively discrete/algebraic persona. We have effectively shut ourselves off from {{half of the world}} of computing: a host of problems in Com-putational Science & Engineering (CS&E) are defined on the continuum, and, for them, the discrete viewpoint is inadequate. The computational techniques in such problems are well-known to numerical analysis and applied mathematics, but are rarely discussed in theoretical algorithms: iteration, subdi-vision and approximation. By various case studies, I will indicate how our discrete/algebraic view of computing has many shortcomings in CS&E. We want embrace the continuous/analytic view, but in a new synthesis with the discrete/algebraic view. I will suggest a pathway, by way of an exact numerical model of computation, that allows us to incorporate iteration and approximation into our algorithms’ design. Some recent results give a peek into how this view of algorithmic development might look like, and its distinctive form suggests the name “numerical computational geometry ” for such activities. You might object that it would be reasonable enough for me to try to expound the differential calculus, or the theory of numbers, to you, because the view that I might find something of interest to say to you about such subjects is not prima facie absurd; but that geometry is, after all, the business of geometers, and that I know, and you know, and I know that you know, that I am not one; and that it is useless for me to try to tell you what geometry is, because <b>I</b> <b>simply</b> <b>do</b> not know. — G.

40|$|Having a {{word on the}} tip of our {{tongue is}} a mundane and {{slightly}} annoying experi- ence. And yet, as Brown’s article helps us see, the theoretical implications of a TOT experience range very widely. The study of TOTs may also turn out to be useful for larger methodological reasons. Here, too, Brown recognizes that the investigation of TOTs offers an especially good example of convergent cognitive analysis, a way to combine phenomenology (e. g., James’s treatment of the fringe) with more objective methods of scientific investigation such as experimental psychology and computer modeling. For what it is worth, I am in complete agreement with Brown’s general approach to the TOT experience. And we also agree on various specific points, though in some cases Brown does not see this. Unfortunately, Brown at times attributes to me views that <b>I</b> <b>simply</b> <b>do</b> not hold; for example, that I take the feeling of knowing to be necessarily veridical or that the feeling of knowing demands a search of all relevant nonconscious information. I want to keep my comments directed toward issues that are of larger importance for the study of consciousness and the fringe and not fuss about our misunderstandings unless they have wider cognitive implications. For this reason I focus on Brown’s discussion in his ‘‘Current Research’’ section and the phenomenology most relevant to it. I believe the chief difficulty with Brown’s article {{is that it does not}} address James’s treatment of the feeling of knowing as it operates in a TOT state. This oversight undercuts a good deal of Brown’s specific analysis and helps contribute to his misun- derstanding of my own proposals regarding the role of the fringe in retrieval, monitor- ing, and control and why, as a matter of phenomenology, the feeling of knowing rightly understood is simply another term for the experience of rightness (Mangan, 1991, 1993 a, 1993 b) ...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} was {{an outcome}} {{evaluation of the}} Living Through Learning's Coronation Reading Adventure Room Programme. LTL's reading programme objectives include aspects of improving and developing English literacy in disadvantaged schools, teaching learners {{how to read and}} write and equipping teachers with the necessary skills to teach effectively. LTL also provides facilitators to offer assistance to the teachers in order to teach effectively in overcrowded classes. The main programme beneficiaries are teachers and grade one learners. This dissertation focuses on 18 schools in disadvantaged communities in Cape Town who received the literacy programme in 2015. Two evaluation questions were formulated, for the literacy programme. The first evaluation question focused on the learners and assessed whether or not the learners who were part of the CRAR programme were better off regarding literacy performance than they were before the programme. For the teacher characteristics, the evaluation question asked if the teachers' language teaching experience, English language proficiency, teaching self-efficacy, perceptions of usefulness of the LTL materials, and usage of the reading room had any influence on the learner's performance. Secondary data provided by LTL was utilised to answer the literacy programme evaluation question. The data included test scores of grade 1 learners from 18 different schools. Primary data was used for teacher's characteristics and this was done through a questionnaire sent out to the different teachers. Data analysis methods included descriptive statistics for the learners' assessments and inferential statistics for teacher characteristics. The results showed that learners who were part of the LTL programme showed improvement in assessment scores. All schools, except one, attained the realistic NGO (60 %) standard in their reading assessments. Three schools attained the high standard (85 %). Furthermore, all schools attained the 50 % Curriculum Assessment Policy Statements standard in the CAPS based-assessments. Therefore, it can be concluded that the LTL programme successfully aided improvement of literacy skills of the learners who were part of the programme. In an analysis of teacher's characteristics, teacher experience in literacy was the only variable that significantly predicted learner performance in literacy. However, the results must be interpreted with caution; the absence of a comparison group makes it difficult to give all credit to the LTL programme alone. At this point <b>I</b> <b>simply</b> <b>do</b> not know whether it was only the programme that led to the improvement in literacy scores or whether other factors had an influence, or a joint influence in combination with the literacy programme (e. g. learners started reading more in their own time {{as a result of the}} programme) ...|$|E
