500|$|In {{the first}} volume of Free Collars Kingdom, Fujima {{expressed}} his feelings on the series' release, while also stating that [...] "it went to the press before I knew it". Fujima noted that the series was [...] "quite a bit different" [...] compared to previous series he had worked on, and that he [...] "had no idea how" [...] the audience would respond to it. He explained that [...] "if you have fun reading it, then I'll be happy". In volume two, due to having left-over [...] "open pages", Fujima used the <b>extra</b> <b>pages</b> to [...] "describe characters" [...] and [...] "have fun".|$|E
500|$|The {{serialization}} of Love and RocketsX {{appeared in}} Love and Rockets Vol.1 #31–39 from December 1989 to August 1992. [...] The serialization was titled Love and Rockets; the X was appended {{when it appeared}} as the title story of the tenth volume (hence [...] "X") of the tenth volume of the Complete Love and Rockets in 1993, to which Hernandez added a few <b>extra</b> <b>pages.</b> [...] The collected page count comes to 96 pages. [...] In 2007 Love and RocketsX appeared in the Beyond Palomar volume of The Love and Rockets Library with Poison River.

500|$|The {{end of each}} issue, {{with the}} {{exception}} of issue twelve, contains supplemental prose pieces written by Moore. Among the contents are fictional book chapters, letters, reports, and articles written by various Watchmen characters. DC had trouble selling ad space in issues of Watchmen, which left an extra eight to nine pages per issue. DC planned to insert house ads and a longer letters column to fill the space, but editor Len Wein felt this would be unfair to anyone who wrote in during the last four issues of the series. He decided to use the <b>extra</b> <b>pages</b> to fill out the series' backstory. Moore said, [...] "By the time we got around to issue #3, #4, and so on, we thought that the book looked nice without a letters page. It looks less like a comic book, so we stuck with it." ...|$|E
500|$|Yuki {{believed}} that the original story was unclear and added <b>extra</b> <b>pages</b> to clarify the twist ending of the series. Because of her decision, the ending chapter of Godchild was eight pages longer than the usual thirty pages for a manga. Yuki was divided between a happy or tragic ending for Cain, noting how readers of Angel Sanctuary had wanted a happy ending for the protagonists. She felt that the ending of Godchild was ambiguous as to whether Cain survived because there is neither blood nor a fatal wound on him. Yuki chose the final line of Godchild from the rhyme [...] "Simple Simon", joking in the postscript that at least the series did not conclude with the line [...] "And then there were none". As of finishing the series, Yuki said that she has no plans for additional chapters or side stories. Despite this, she included a five-page epilogue in the 2010 bunkoban release of the entire series.|$|E

6000|$|The guiding {{spirit of}} Cosy Moments was Mr. Wilberfloss. Circumstances {{had left the}} {{development}} of the paper mainly to him. For the past twelve months the proprietor had been away in Europe, taking the waters at Carlsbad, and the sole control of Cosy Moments had passed into the hands of Mr. Wilberfloss. Nor had he proved unworthy of the trust or unequal to the duties. In that year Cosy Moments had reached the highest possible level of domesticity. Anything not calculated to appeal to the home had been rigidly excluded. And as a result the circulation had increased steadily. Two <b>extra</b> <b>pages</b> had been added, [...] "Moments Among the Shoppers" [...] and [...] "Moments with Society." [...] And the advertisements had grown in volume. But the work had told upon the Editor. Work of that sort carries its penalties with it. Success means absorption, and absorption spells softening of the brain.|$|E
