5|$|The role of stay-at-home dad may be {{difficult}} for men who <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> they had no option. It is hard for these men to adapt from being a financial provider in the family to being a homemaker. Men who willingly choose to become a stay-at-home dad are much more satisfied with their role in the family.|$|E

There are also spotlights situated {{at the bottom of}} the set area that zoom down on the contestant when they answer a major question; to increase the visibility of the light beams emitted by such spotlights, oil is vaporized, creating a haze effect. Media scholar Dr. Robert Thompson, a professor at Syracuse University, stated that the show's {{lighting system}} made the contestant <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> they were outside of prison when an escape was in progress.|$|E

5|$|Lindsey later {{reveals that}} she is {{pregnant}} with Joe's baby. Joe admits this but tells Mercedes he still {{wants to be with}} her. Mercedes believes him, however Lindsey makes Mercedes <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> she is interrupting on a perfect family with her and Joe. Mercedes then breaks up with Joe, and leaves the village. She returns two months later, and is shocked to learn that Lindsey's younger sister, Kim Butterfield (Daisy Wood-Davis), has been imprisoned for killing seven patients at the local hospital. Kim's ex-girlfriend, Esther Bloom (Jazmine Franks) and herself a victim of the killer when they tried to murder her, attempts to convince Mercedes of Kim's innocence. Mercedes and Esther realise that Lindsey is the serial killer after discovering Lindsey's earring is matching to the earring which was dropped when Esther was attacked. Mercedes confronts Lindsey but she denies this. Lindsey writes a fake letter pretending to be Kim admitting to be the serial killer and telling Esther to leave her alone. Mercedes sees the letter which has doodles on it, and when she is alone with Cindy and Lindsey, she realises that the doodles are the same as those in Lindsey's notebook. Her and Cindy realise that Lindsey is the serial killer and confront her. Lindsey confesses to the murders and attempted murders, and then strikes both Mercedes and Cindy with a large book, knocking them unconscious. She then escapes the village. Mercedes is desperate for Lindsey to be caught and for Joe's baby son, JJ, not be abducted, and moves back in with Joe and Freddie. When Silas hears about what Lindsey's murders, he returns to the village and begins working with Lindsey. Silas plans to finally kill Mercedes, however Mercedes convinces Silas to kill Lindsey instead, informing him of her sinful ways. Her plan works and Silas murders Lindsey instead and Mercedes manages to escape.|$|E
25|$|A {{simple way}} to hear the {{relationship}} between these notes is by playing them on a piano keyboard. When traversing the circle of fifths backwards, the notes will <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> they fall into each other. This aural relationship is what the mathematics describe.|$|E
25|$|There is {{also the}} {{cognitive}} perspective. Theorists believe that people with panic disorder may experience panic reactions because they mistake their bodily sensations for life-threatening situations. These bodily sensations cause some people to <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> {{are out of control}} which may lead to feelings of panic. This misconception of bodily sensations is referred to as anxiety sensitivity and studies suggest that the people who score higher on anxiety sensitivity surveys than other people, are fives {{times more likely to be}} diagnosed with panic disorder.|$|E

25|$|The {{lighting}} system is programmed to darken the set as the contestant progresses {{further into the}} game. There are also spotlights situated {{at the bottom of}} the set area that zoom down on the contestant when they answer a major question; to increase the visibility of the light beams emitted by such spotlights, oil is vaporised, creating a haze effect.

25|$|Although BioWare {{approached}} Mass Effect: Andromeda as a {{new beginning}} and wanted it to feel fresh and new, the company still borrowed elements from previous titles. For example, the ability to drive a vehicle {{was inspired by the}} Mako from Mass Effect and the concept of loyalty missions was taken directly from Mass Effect 2. The team also applied lessons that they learned from Mass Effect 3, which featured a controversial ending where some fans didn't <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> their investment in the series' characters had paid off.|$|E
25|$|For a {{majority}} of black women feminism has failed to accurately and holistically describe them as individuals {{to the world that}} surrounds them. They <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> it takes something new that is not already bound to a predetermined master in order to capture this new movement. Womanism is something that Alice Walker can completely identify with without having second thoughts; it feels natural to her. Feminism does not. When distinguishing between feminism and womanism {{it is important to remember}} that many women find womanism easier to identify with. In addition, a key component of a womanist discourse is the role that spirituality and ethics has on ending the interlocking oppression of race, gender, and class that circumscribes the lives of African-American women.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} {{maintain}} high-quality performance, some musicians take chemical substances. Some musicians take drugs or alcohol {{to deal with the}} stress of performing. As a group they have a higher rate of substance abuse. The most common chemical substance which is abused by pop musicians is cocaine, because of its neurological effects. Stimulants like cocaine increase alertness and cause feelings of euphoria, and can therefore make the performer <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> they in some ways ‘own the stage’. One way in which substance abuse is harmful for a performer (musicians especially) is if the substance being abused is aspirated. The lungs are an important organ used by singers, and addiction to cigarettes may seriously harm the quality of their performance. Smoking causes harm to alveoli, which are responsible for absorbing oxygen.|$|E
25|$|Ingesting a {{compound}} by smoking {{is one of}} the most rapid and efficient methods of introducing it into the bloodstream, second only to injection, which allows for the rapid feedback which supports the smokers' ability to titrate their dosage. On average it takes about ten seconds for the substance to reach the brain. As a result of the efficiency of this delivery system, many smokers <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> they are unable to cease. Of those who attempt cessation and last three months without succumbing to nicotine, most are able to remain smoke-free for the rest of their lives. There exists a possibility of depression in some who attempt cessation, as with other psychoactive substances. Depression is also common in teenage smokers; teens who smoke are four times as likely to develop depressive symptoms as their nonsmoking peers.|$|E
25|$|Professor Katarina Sjöberg {{argues in}} The Wall Street Culture {{that within the}} media {{negative}} images of Wall Street are painted {{in terms of the}} district's market falls, money losses and deceitful gains. However, this is not what Wall Street investors are bothered by. Instead, it is the public's words and opinions which they feel mold their image. Sjöberg notes that in the American culture, money making is of utmost importance and knowing how to make money is considered to be respectable. Therefore, Wall Street investors prioritize their work as well as strive to climb the corporate ladder. They also feel obligated to maintain the image the public creates, because it strengthens their position as a Wall Street employee. They value seeing themselves as experts in their field, especially since they live in a society that values wealth. This justifies their acts of greed, and allows them to take part in activities often deemed as criminal because they <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> it is expected. Moreover, they do not regret their actions because to them, it is part of being an American. Aside from living up to the public's image, Wall Street workers justify their high salaries with an argument pointed out by Karen Ho in Disciplining Investment Bankers, Disciplining the Economy: Wall Street's Institutional Culture of Crisis, the Downsizing of Corporate America. She argues that {{due to the fact that}} the financial market is volatile in conjunction with the existence of job insecurity, Wall Street workers are compensated through their salaries.|$|E

25|$|Protagoras {{states that}} he has two good pieces of {{evidence}} that people agree with him. First, people do not rebuke the ugly, dwarfish, and weak, but pity them, because they cannot help being as they are, yet they punish the unjust and generally <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> someone is responsible for not knowing {{something that can be}} taught (323d). Second, they do instruct people who are unjust and irreligious, hoping to impart goodness in them. He says that parents begin with their children from earliest childhood, and teachers carry on the task. Protagoras notes that none of this is surprising, but what would be surprising is if this were not the case (326e). He closes by addressing Socrates' question why, if virtue is teachable, the sons of virtuous men often lack virtue. Protagoras lays out a thought experiment where a hypothetical city state is resting its survival as such to the skill of flute playing. Being {{the most important thing for}} that society, parents would be eager to teach the skill to their sons. Not everyone would be successful though, as we can imagine, as some would have a greater natural inclination than others and often the son of a good flute player would turn out bad and vice versa. Any of them however, even the bad ones, would be better than an average citizen in the real world which might have never been taught how to play. Same goes for virtue, it is considered so important that everyone is taught to a certain degree, to the point that it seems like a part of human nature while it is not (327b–d).|$|E

Atrus addresses the player character as [...] "my friend" [...] in cutscenes. Cyan's intent was for players to <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> they were themselves there, stranded on a mysterious island with {{no choice but to}} explore. Thus, the games' protagonist is an anonymous, gender-neutral entity with no given history, and players are free to imagine themselves as the protagonist.|$|E

[...] The spell is worked, and the mermaid is found by the prince, who sees the resemblance {{between her and the}} one who rescued him from drowning, although he does not realize that they are the same person. [...] Although the prince cares deeply for the mermaid, he is betrothed to the daughter of a neighboring king, and the mermaid cannot prevent their marriage.|$|E
500|$|Disney {{wanted to}} {{experiment}} in more sophisticated sound recording and reproduction techniques for Fantasia. [...] "Music emerging from one speaker {{behind the screen}} sounds thin, tinkly and strainy. We wanted to reproduce such beautiful masterpieces... so that audiences would <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> they were standing at the podium with Stokowski". For the recording of The Sorcerer's Apprentice in January 1938, engineers at Disney collaborated with RCA Corporation for using multiple audio channels which allowed any desired dynamic balance to be achieved upon playback. The stage was altered acoustically with double plywood semi-circular partitions that separated the orchestra into five sections to increase reverberation. Though as the production of Fantasia developed, the setup used for The Sorcerer's Apprentice was abandoned for different multi-channel recording arrangements.|$|E
