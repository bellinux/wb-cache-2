40|$|The {{exploitation}} {{and sale of}} wildlife species that are endangered in only part of their range present regulators with the critical challenge of separating legal from illegal takes. Wildlife <b>DNA</b> <b>registers</b> created from tissue samples of legally obtained individual wildlife specimens can address this problem by allowing managers to identify unregistered (presumably illegally obtained) specimens. We tested {{the effectiveness of the}} only current, fully operational wildlife DNA register of individual genetic profiles collected from legally caught minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata). Twenty minke whale tissue samples collected at markets in Norway and 2 additional samples collected from beached minke whales in Denmark were genotyped at 12 loci used by the Norwegian minke whale DNA register Genetic profiles of these samples then were compared against the 2676 individual profiles deposited in the Norwegian register The high number of genetic markers used to identify individuals in our study allowed consistent matching of sample and reference profiles despite an overall error rate (due to experimental and interlaboratory data standardization) estimated at 0. 015 per locus. Of the 22 test samples only the 2 Danish samples failed to match an existing profile in the Norwegian minke whale DNA register Our results show that the basic principle of wildlife <b>DNA</b> <b>registers</b> can work in a real-life situation. The strength of wildlife <b>DNA</b> <b>registers</b> lies in their ability to unambiguously identify unregistered specimens with the aid of sensitive genetic methods that enable analysis of highly processed or degraded tissue samples. Our study also highlights a number of methodological problems such as laboratory errors and interlaboratory data standardization, which need be addressed to ensure a successful implementation of wildlife <b>DNA</b> <b>registers...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The use of DNA {{methods for}} the {{identification}} and management of natural resources is gaining importance. In the future, {{it is likely that}} <b>DNA</b> <b>registers</b> will play an increasing role in this development. Microsatellite markers have been the primary tool in ecological, medical and forensic genetics for the past two decades. However, these markers are characterized by genotyping errors, and display challenges with calibration between laboratories and genotyping platforms. The Norwegian minke whale DNA register (NMDR) contains individual genetic profiles at ten microsatellite loci for 6737 individuals captured in the period 1997 - 2008. These analyses have been conducted in four separate laboratories for nearly a decade, and offer a unique opportunity to examine genotyping errors and their consequences in an individual based DNA register. We re-genotyped 240 samples, and, for the first time, applied a mixed regression model to look at potentially confounding effects on genotyping errors. Results The average genotyping error rate for the whole dataset was 0. 013 per locus and 0. 008 per allele. Errors were, however, not evenly distributed. A decreasing trend across time was apparent, along with a strong within-sample correlation, suggesting that error rates heavily depend on sample quality. In addition, some loci were more error prone than others. False allele size constituted 18 of 31 observed errors, and the remaining errors were ten false homozygotes (i. e., the true genotype was a heterozygote) and three false heterozygotes (i. e., the true genotype was a homozygote). Conclusions To our knowledge, this study represents the first investigation of genotyping error rates in a wildlife DNA register, and the first application of mixed models to examine multiple effects of different factors influencing the genotyping quality. It was demonstrated that <b>DNA</b> <b>registers</b> accumulating data over time have the ability to maintain calibration and genotyping consistency, despite analyses being conducted on different genotyping platforms and in different laboratories. Although errors were detected, it is demonstrated that if the re-genotyping of individual samples is possible, these will have a minimal effect on the database's primary purpose, i. e., to perform individual identification. </p...|$|E

Nucleotide flipping disrupts Watson–Crick base pairing, induces a kink in the DNA and shifts the <b>DNA</b> <b>register</b> by 1 bp, making the distances between scissile phosphates in the Ecl 18 kI and NgoMIV cocrystal structures nearly identical.

40|$|Graduation date: 2015 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from Sept. 29, 2014 - Sept. 29, 2015 Humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae, Borowski 1781) in the North Pacific migrate from mid- to high- latitude summer feeding grounds along the Pacific Rim, including areas off the coasts of the U. S., Canada, Russia and eastern Asia, to tropical breeding grounds each winter along Pacific coasts of Mexico and Central America {{as well as the}} offshore islands of Mexico, Hawaii, and Japan. Humpback whales in the North Pacific and elsewhere were reduced to very low numbers during a period of intense commercial exploitation that ended in 1965. As the population recovers in abundance, the range of cultural and genetic diversity that survived the exploitation-driven bottleneck is able to adapt, endure and evolve. My work uses genetic tools and photo identification data to investigate the population dynamics, mitochondrial (mt) DNA control region evolution and potential drivers of a specialized feeding behavior in a recovering subpopulation of humpback whales in the Glacier Bay and Icy Strait (GBIS) sub-region of the southeastern Alaska (SEAK) feeding ground. I first collated and reconciled available DNA profiles (mtDNA control region, 10 microsatellite loci and sex) from 556 individuals using tissue samples collected from 1987 to 2012. Photo identification records associated with 692 of 1, 026 total genetic samples collected in SEAK (now archived within the SEAK <b>DNA</b> <b>Register</b> and Tissue Database) corresponded to extensive life-history information, extending back to the early 1970 s, as archived within the SEAK Regional Database, curated by the National Park Service (NPS) and University of Alaska, Southeast (UAS). 	Changes in population structure in GBIS over 32 years (1973 - 2005) were investigated in order to determine whether the increase in local abundance was attributable to local fidelity and recruitment or immigration from outside of SEAK. Two temporal strata were defined: 'Founder' individuals identified between 1973 - 1985 (n = 74, n = 46 with DNA profiles) and 'Contemporary' individuals identified between 2004 - 2005 (n = 171, n = 114 with DNA profiles). There was no significant genetic differentiation between the strata, indicating that {{it is unlikely that the}} population increase within GBIS was due largely to immigration of whales from elsewhere in the North Pacific. However, two additional haplotypes were documented in the Contemporary stratum at low frequency, one of which was previously unreported in the North Pacific (haplotype A 8, see below). This relative stability in haplotype frequencies over time argues for strong regional fidelity of the maternal lineages represented in GBIS between 1973 and 1985. After excluding the 42 Contemporary whales with no photo ID record of a mother or genotype available for maternity inference, at least 73. 6...|$|R

40|$|Both prokaryotic and {{eukaryotic}} organisms contain DNA bridging proteins, {{which can}} have regulatory or architectural functions. The molecular and mechanical details of such proteins {{are hard to}} obtain, in particular if they involve non-specific interactions. The bacterial nucleoid consists of hundreds of DNA loops, shaped in part by non-specific DNA bridging proteins such as histone-like nucleoid structuring protein (H-NS), leucine-responsive regulatory protein (Lrp) and SMC (structural maintenance of chromosomes) proteins. We have developed an optical tweezers instrument that can independently handle two DNA molecules, which allows the systematic investigation of protein-mediated DNA-DNA interactions. Here we use this technique to investigate the abundant non-specific nucleoid-associated protein H-NS, and show that H-NS is dynamically organized between two <b>DNA</b> molecules in <b>register</b> with their helical pitch.

Comet evaluation was made by visual (types 0 - 4) and digital (percentage of DNA remaining in the comet head = % head DNA) analysis. The association between the level of DNA damage and cancer prognostic factors was assessed. The treatments caused a significant increase in <b>DNA</b> damage <b>registered</b> by both visual (p < 0. 001) and digital (p < 0. 001) analysis. No significant associations between the level of DNA damage in pre-treatment patients and cancer prognostic factors were found. Results showed a significant correlation between the comet results from each patient before and after treatment (r = 0. 64, p = 0. 001). The % head DNA in post-treatment samples from patients with high level of DNA damage before treatment (30. 3 ± 3. 1 %, p < 0. 01) was lower than in post-treatment samples from patient with low to medium level of DNA damage before therapy (49. 2 ± 4. 4 %). Results support the usefulness of the comet assay as a sensitive technique to evaluate the basal DNA status and the damage caused by cancer treatments. The assay could contribute to the treatment decisions, taking into account the patients’ basal DNA damage before therapy. Fil: Capitaine Funes, Juan. Universidad Nacional de Rosario.

40|$|Contact: tixier@supagro. inra. frThe public {{database}} GenBank is {{an increasingly}} important source of sequence data for diagnostic and phylogenetic research; however, not all deposited sequences are necessarily correctly ascribed to a source species. We considered {{the example of the}} mite family Phytoseiidae to determine how the corresponding sequences could be accurately exploited. Phytoseiidae mites are well known worldwide for their ability to control certain mite and insect pests. The number of molecular approaches, especially for diagnostic purposes, has increased over the past decade, leading to {{an increase in the number}} of sequences registered in the GenBank database. The aim of the present paper was to evaluate the validity of the DNA sequences presently assigned to Phytoseiidae species in this database. Three hundred and fifty-one sequences, corresponding to the four most frequently <b>registered</b> <b>DNA</b> fragments (ITS, COI, Cytb and 12 S rRNA), were considered. DNA extraction, amplification and sequencing were performed for the fragments 12 S rRNA and ITS for Amblyseius andersoni, A. swirskii, Iphiseius degenerans, Euseius ovalis, E. stipulatus, Neoseiulus cucumeris and Typhlodromus pyri, as some identifications were questionable. Numerous problems were evident based on genetic distance analyses of these sequences. First, nomenclatural problems were encountered, preventing the correct identification of the taxa sequenced in one case. Suspected misidentifications were frequent, stressing the importance of voucher specimen availability. For the 12 S rRNA fragment, sequences assigned to three Phytoseiidae species were those of their prey (Astigmata), underlining the care that must be taken when manipulating the DNA of such predators (sterile conditions and specific PCR primers). Finally, sequences of two regions of the COI mtDNA were encountered, leading to alignment problems between sequences of a same gene and same species. These results are discussed in relation to responsibilities of authors in terms of taxon identification and the great utility of open access DNA sequence databases, such as GenBank, for improving taxonomic identifications and advancing scientific research...|$|R
