5|$|Kidnapping is also {{a common}} theme in such folklore. Encantados {{are said to be}} fond of abducting humans with whom they fall in love, {{children}} born of their illicit love affairs, or just about anyone near the river who can keep them company, and taking them back to the Encante. The fear of this is so great among {{people who live in the}} Amazon river area that both children and adults are terrified of going near the water between dusk and dawn, or entering water-bodies alone. Some who supposedly have encountered encantados while out in their canoes <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>said</b> to have gone insane, although in fact, the creatures seem to have done little more than follow their boats and nudge them from time to time.|$|E
5|$|When {{a public}} {{authority}} fetters its discretion, it {{can either be}} said to have failed to exercise its discretionary power or to have been subject to external influences. In the Singapore High Court decision Lines International Holding (S) Pte. Ltd. v. Singapore Tourist Promotion Board (1997), two distinct forms of fettering of discretion were recognized: fettering of discretion through rigid adherence to a policy, and fettering of discretion by an unlawful delegation of authority. These two forms of fettering of discretion <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>said</b> to represent two elements defining the concept of discretion in administrative law – the first form relates to freedom of choice, and second form the notion of one's personal discretion.|$|E

But it didn’t happen that way: past and matter were objectified and reified, boldly used for constructing the temporal teleology of modernity. This paper explores such events. <br /...|$|R

25|$|Various images, {{especially}} in the frontispieces or title pages of books, <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>said</b> to contain symbolism pointing to Bacon's authorship. A book on codes and cyphers entitled Cryptomenytices et Cryptographiae, is said to depict Bacon writing a work and Shakespeare (signified by the spear he carries) receiving it. Other books with similar alleged coded imagery include the third edition of John Florio's translation of Montaigne, and various editions of works by Bacon himself.|$|E

25|$|Similarly, other {{researchers}} have raised concerns {{about the extent to}} which self-report EI measures correlate with established personality dimensions. Generally, self-report EI measures and personality measures <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>said</b> to converge because they both purport to measure personality traits. Specifically, there appear to be two dimensions of the Big Five that stand out as most related to self-report EI– neuroticism and extroversion. In particular, neuroticism has been said to relate to negative emotionality and anxiety. Intuitively, individuals scoring high on neuroticism are likely to score low on self-report EI measures.|$|E

25|$|This is {{a series}} of vignettes recounting a social {{occasion}} during which someone said something that should not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>said,</b> or an awkward occurrence. The participant's task is to identify what was said that was awkward, why it was awkward, how people would have felt in reaction to the faux pas and to a factual control question. Although first designed for use in people on the autism spectrum, the test is also sensitive to patients with OFC dysfunction, who cannot judge when something socially awkward has happened despite appearing to understand the story perfectly well.|$|E

In addition to the fighting skills she learned from The Hand, Psylocke has recently received training from fellow Exiles teammate Sabretooth and from an alternate reality's Ogun, who used science and magic combined to alter the passage of time itself, allowing them to accomplish a lifetime's work in a few short hours, thus improving Psylocke's skills once more.|$|E
25|$|But for the moment, {{the advance}} of the {{northern}} army was of the highest military importance, for Fairfax was thereby set free from the necessity of undertaking sieges.

It was now obvious that they represented the armed force of England against the Irish, Danes, French, Lorrainers, etc., whom Charles had for three years been endeavouring to let loose on English soil. Even the Presbyterians abandoned for the time, any attempt to negotiate with the King, and advocated a vigorous prosecution of the war.|$|E

25|$|Tom Petersson and Jol Dantzig of Hamer Guitars {{created the}} idea for a twelve-string bass. Tom Petersson {{previously}} had used an Alembic and Hagstrom 8-string basses, and asked Dantzig to make a 12-string bass. The company initially made him a 10-string bass. Following the successful trial use of that bass, the prototype 12-string bass, The Hamer 'Quad', was produced. Petersson later used 12-string basses made by Kids (a Japanese guitar maker), Chandler, and signature models from Waterstone and from The Electrical Guitar Company. During 2015 and 2016, his primary 12-string bass was one of a pair of prototype Gretsch White Falcon basses in all white and also cream / green finishes. They <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>said</b> to be envisaged as a future 'signature' production model. His primary choice of 4-string bass is a Gibson Thunderbird, though he also owns a very impressive array of 4, 5 and 8 stringed basses from other guitar makers. He is also an endorser of Hofner basses.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the late}} Soviet times Russia has {{experienced}} another wave of Western cultural influence, {{which led to}} the development of many previously unknown phenomena in the Russian culture. The most vivid example, perhaps, is the Russian rock music, which takes its roots both in the Western rock and roll and heavy metal, and in traditions of the Russian bards of Soviet era, like Vladimir Vysotsky and Bulat Okudzhava. Saint-Petersburg (former Leningrad), Yekaterinburg (former Sverdlovsk) and Omsk became the main centers of development of the rock music. Popular Russian rock groups include Mashina Vremeni, Slot, DDT, Aquarium, Alisa, Kino, Nautilus Pompilius, Aria, Grazhdanskaya Oborona, Splean and Korol i Shut. At the same time Russian pop music developed from what was known in the Soviet times as estrada into full-fledged industry, with some performers gaining international recognition, like t.A.T.u. in the West, who <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>said</b> to be the most influential artists to ever come out of Russia, or Vitas in China.|$|E
