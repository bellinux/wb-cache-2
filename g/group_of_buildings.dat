5|$|In the United States, a {{historic}} district is a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>buildings,</b> properties, or sites {{that have been}} designated by one of several entities on different levels as historically or architecturally significant. Buildings, structures, objects and sites within {{a historic}} district are normally divided into two categories, contributing and non-contributing. Districts greatly vary in size: some have hundreds of structures, while others have just a few.|$|E
5|$|The Inns of Chancery or Hospida Cancellarie were a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>buildings</b> {{and legal}} {{institutions}} in London initially {{attached to the}} Inns of Court and used as offices for the clerks of chancery, from which they drew their name. Existing from at least 1344, the Inns gradually changed their purpose, and became both the offices and accommodation for solicitors (as the Inns of Court were to barristers) and a place of initial training for barristers.|$|E

5|$|The Hospitium {{is located}} between {{the ruins of}} St. Mary's Abbey Church and the River Ouse and {{is thought to have}} {{originally}} been a guest house for visitors to the abbey of low social rank, or possibly a barn. It was originally part of a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>buildings</b> in the abbey grounds that included a brew-house, stables, mill and, near the main gate, a boarding school with 50 pupils. The oldest parts of the ground floor were built around 1300, but the upper storey has been extensively restored in modern times. The ruined gateway at the side dates back to the 15th century, and was probably the entrance to a passage that ran towards the water-gate by the river.|$|E
5|$|The Phra Maha Monthien (พระมหามณเฑียร) <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>buildings</b> {{are located}} roughly at {{the centre of}} the Middle Court, {{therefore}} {{at the very heart of}} the Grand Palace itself. The traditional Thai style building group is enclosed by a low wall, as this was once the residential and sleeping abode of kings. Thus it is considered the most important set of throne halls in the entire Grand Palace. All of the buildings within the Maha Monthien face north and are arranged from front to back with the public reception hall being at the front, ceremonial halls in the middle and residential halls at the back, all of them inter-connected to each other.|$|E

The time history of the accumulated renovation costs is determined. It is suitable for rational planning of the renovation strategy and of an economic balance between resources assigned to new construction and resources used for the renovation <b>of</b> <b>buildings...</b>|$|R
5|$|Route 103 {{begins at}} a {{junction}} with U.S. Route 24 in Woodstock Township in southern Schuyler County, northeast of Ripley.

Route 103 intersects County Route 9 before entering the unincorporated community of Sugar Grove, where it meets County Route 1. After passing through Sugar Grove, the highway enters Bainbridge Township.
