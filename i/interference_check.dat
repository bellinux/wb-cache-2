40|$|Relevant {{works on}} the design of spherical {{parallel}} robots (SPRs) are mostly for conceptual design. The conceptual design of a SPR considers kinematic parameters and variables to describe the motion transformation between joints and the end-effector. For example, the Denavit-Hartenberg (D-H) notation with four kinematic parameters is used to represent the spatial relations of two motion axes with no consideration of the physical embodiment between the two axes. We call the design parameters involved in the conceptual design phase as conceptual design parameters (CDPs). In contrast, embodiment design concerns the specifications of links and kinematic pairs in terms of their geometrics, volumes, spatial arrangements and dynamic behaviors. Accordingly, we call the designparameters in the embodiment design phase as embodiment design parameters (EDPs). As far as a robotic design is concerned, a critical challenge of embodiment design is to sustain the workspace obtained in conceptual design based on CDPs. Actual geometries of objects might cause the interferences among physical objects in an embodied robot. In this paper, the conceptual design of a SPR is assumed to be known, the embodiment design of a SPR is focused to minimize the workspace loss caused by EDPs. We propose three principles to guide the embodiment design of the SPR, and we apply the general algorithm (GA) for <b>interference</b> <b>check</b> based on the proposed principles.

40|$|The most {{intuitive}} memory consistency {{model for}} shared-memory multi-threaded programming is sequential consistency (SC). However, current concurrent programming languages support a relaxed model, as such relaxations are deemed necessary for enabling important optimizations. This paper demonstrates that an SC-preserving compiler, one that ensures that every SC {{behavior of a}} compiler-generated binary is an SC behavior of the source program, retains most of the performance benefits of an optimizing compiler. The key observation is that a large class of optimizations crucial for performance are either already SC-preserving or can be modified to preserve SC while retaining much of their effectiveness. An SC-preserving compiler, obtained by restricting the optimization phases in LLVM, a state-of-the-art C/C++ compiler, incurs an average slowdown of 3. 8 % and a maximum slowdown of 34 % {{on a set of}} 30 programs from the SPLASH- 2, PARSEC, and SPEC CINT 2006 benchmark suites. While the performance overhead of preserving SC in the compiler is much less than previously assumed, it might still be unacceptable for certain applications. We believe there are several avenues for improving performance without giving up SC-preservation. In this vein, we observe that the overhead of our SC-preserving compiler arises mainly from its inability to aggressively perform a class of optimizations we identify as eager-load optimizations. This class includes common-subexpression elimination, constant propagation, global value numbering, and common cases of loop-invariant code motion. We propose a notion of <b>interference</b> <b>checks</b> in order to enable eager-load optimizations while preserving SC. <b>Interference</b> <b>checks</b> expose to the compiler a commonly used hardware speculation mechanism that can efficiently detect whether a particular variable has changed its value since last read...|$|R
