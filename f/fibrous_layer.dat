5|$|The capillitium {{refers to}} coarse, late-maturing, {{thick-walled}} {{cells in the}} gleba that develop pores or slits in their thick secondary walls. The capillitial hyphae are 1.5–9.5µm wide, thick-walled, often with a narrow lumen, and with or without surface ornamentation. The columella hyphae are 1.5–14µm wide (occasionally wider, up to 34µm), thick-walled, often with narrow lumen. Single thin-walled, about 1.5µm wide hyphae with clamps can be observed. The endoperidial hyphae are densely interwoven, thick-walled, and about 2–6µm wide. The whitish powder on newly expanded specimens consists of crystalline matter and thin-walled, 1.5–4µm wide, branched hyphae with clamps. The peristome hyphae are thick-walled, 2–11µm wide. The pseudoparenchymatous layer is built up by bladder-like, thin-walled hyphae of varying size. On the surface of newly expanded specimens crystals and thin-walled hyphae {{of the same kind}} as on the endoperidium are present. The crystals are calcium oxalate dihydrate that have the crystalline structure of a pyramid, and are arranged singly or in loose aggregates, 11 to 30µm in size. The <b>fibrous</b> <b>layer</b> has thick-walled hyphae 1.5–4µm wide. The mycelial layer in the inner, very thin part (seen as a glossy lining on the <b>fibrous</b> <b>layer</b> of newly expanded fruit bodies) consists of a dense web of thin-walled, 1.5–4µm wide, clamped hyphae. Thick-walled hyphae are also present, measuring 2–11 (sometimes up to 19)µm wide. The outer part (the mycelial cup) consists of thick-walled, branched and densely interwoven hyphae (often with a narrow lumen) that measure 1.5–4µm wide.|$|E

5|$|The pseudoparenchymatous layer (a {{layer of}} thin-walled, usually angular, {{randomly}} arranged {{cells that are}} tightly packed) is initially beige, later brownish, in age dark brown, cracked and if moist reddish brown. The <b>fibrous</b> <b>layer</b> is beige-colored, with its outer side free from the mycelial layer except at {{the tips of the}} rays. The mycelial layer has a beige brown to somewhat yellowish-brown, felted to tufted outer surface, darkening to reddish-brown if moist. It is not encrusted with debris, but some debris and sand may adhere. The inner side is smooth, dull to somewhat glossy, and hazelnut brown.|$|E
5|$|The spores are spherical {{or nearly}} so, reddish-brown, {{thick-walled}} and verrucose (covered with warts and spines). The spores' dimensions are 7–11µm; the warts are about 1µm long. The spores are non-amyloid, {{and will not}} stain with iodine from Melzer's reagent. The use of scanning electron microscopy {{has shown that the}} spines are 0.90–1.45µm long, rounded at the tip, narrow, tapered, and sometime joined together at the top. The capillitia (masses of thread-like sterile fibers dispersed among the spores) are branched, 3.5–6.5µm in diameter, and hyaline (translucent). The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four- to eight-spored, with very short sterigmata. The basidia are arranged in long strings of clusters; individual basidia measure 11–15 by 18–24µm. The threads of the capillitia arise from the inner surface of the peridium, and are thick-walled, long, interwoven, and branched, measuring 3–5.5µm thick. The exoperidium (the outer layer of tissue, comprising the rays) is made of four distinct layers of tissue: the mycelial layer contains branched hyphae that are 4–6μm in diameter; the hyphae of the <b>fibrous</b> <b>layer</b> are 6–8μm diameter and branched; the collenchyma-type layer has branched hyphae of 3–4μm diameter; the soft layer contains hyphae that are 3–6μm in diameter.|$|E

500|$|Unlike {{those of}} some other Geastrum species, the rays of G.quadrifidum are not hygroscopic: they do not open and close in {{response}} to changes in humidity. Generally, the rays are broad, but they may seem narrow as their edges are often rolled inwards. The width of the exoperidium (when still attached to the mycelial cup) is , when fully expanded about [...] The pseudoparenchymatous layer when fresh is about 1–2mm thick, initially whitish, later turning beige to brownish (sometimes over reddish tints), and dark brown when old. In newly expanded specimens this layer {{is covered with a}} thin layer of crystals and hyphae, sometimes forming a pseudoparenchymatous cup or collar that often peels off in patches, when dry shrunken and hard. The <b>fibrous</b> <b>layer</b> is papery to leathery. The inner side, when free from pseudoparenchymatous remnants, is almost white, in age becoming dirty grayish-white and sometimes greenish due to algae; the outer side is initially whitish, somewhat glossy, but in age becomes grayish-white and dull. The mycelial layer has a whitish inner side and is strongly attached to the litter on its outer side. It persists for a long time (1–2-year-old fruit bodies with intact mycelial cups have been found).|$|E
500|$|Young {{specimens}} of A.hygrometricus have roughly spherical fruit bodies that typically start their development partially {{embedded in the}} substrate. A smooth whitish mycelial layer covers the fruit body, and may be partially encrusted with debris. As the fruit body matures, the mycelial layer tears away, and the outer tissue layer, the exoperidium, breaks open in a star-shaped (...) pattern to form 4–20 irregular [...] "rays". This simultaneously pushes the fruit body above ground to reveal a round spore case enclosed in a thin papery endoperidium. The rays open and close in response to levels of moisture in the environment, opening up in high humidity, and closing when the air is dry. This is possible because the exoperidium is made of several different layers of tissue; the innermost, <b>fibrous</b> <b>layer</b> is hygroscopic, and curls or uncurls the entire ray as it loses or gains moisture from its surroundings. This adaptation enables the fruit body to disperse spores at times of optimum moisture, and reduce evaporation during dry periods. Further, dry fruit bodies with the rays curled up may be readily blown about by the wind, allowing them to scatter spores from the pore as they roll.|$|E

Fully opened specimens can reach dimensions of [...] from ray tip to tip. The rays are of unequal size, with tips that often roll back inward. They comprise three distinct layers of tissue. The inner pseudoparenchymatous layer (so named for the resemblance to the tightly packed cells of plant parenchyma) is fleshy and thick when fresh, and initially pale beige but darkening to yellow or brown as it matures, often cracking and peeling off in the process. The exterior mycelial layer, often matted with fine leaf debris or dirt, usually cracks to reveal a middle <b>fibrous</b> <b>layer,</b> which is made of densely packed hyphae 1–2.5μm wide.

There are several to many evenly dispersed mouths, the ostioles, mainly on the upper half of the endoperidium. They are roughly circular with fimbriate (fringed) edges. The inedible fruit bodies have no distinct taste, although dried specimens develop an odor resembling curry powder or bouillon cubes.|$|E

We then used the model system to test the hypothesis that such <b>fibrous</b> <b>layers</b> lead to an overestimation of biomechanical parameters of integration at the disk/ring interface.

Stress-strain profiles generated from mechanical push-out tests for composites with the layers removed displayed a single and distinct peak, whereas profiles for composites with the layers left intact consisted of multiple superimposed peaks. As compared to composites with removed layers, composites with intact layers had significantly higher adhesive strengths (161 +/- 9 vs. 71 +/- 11 kPa) and adhesion energies (15. 0 +/- 0. 7 vs. 2. 7 +/- 0. 4 mJ/mm 2).

Brachiocephalic artery plaques were significantly larger in apoE/MMP- 3 and apoE/MMP- 9 double knockouts than in controls. The number of buried <b>fibrous</b> <b>layers</b> was also significantly higher in the double knockouts, and both knockouts exhibited cellular compositional changes indicative of an unstable plaque phenotype. Conversely, lesion size and buried <b>fibrous</b> <b>layers</b> were reduced in apoE/MMP- 12 double knockouts compared with controls, and double knockouts had increased smooth muscle cell and reduced macrophage content in the plaque, indicative of a stable plaque phenotype. ApoE/MMP- 7 double knockout plaques contained significantly more smooth muscle cells than controls, but neither lesion size nor features of stability were altered in these animals. Hence, MMP- 3 and MMP- 9 appear normally to play protective roles, limiting plaque growth and promoting a stable plaque phenotype. MMP- 12 supports lesion expansion and destabilization. MMP- 7 has no effect on plaque growth or stability, although it is associated with reduced smooth muscle cell content in plaques. These data demonstrate that MMPs are directly involved in atherosclerotic plaque destabilization and clearly show that members of the MMP family have widely differing effects on atherogenesis...|$|R
