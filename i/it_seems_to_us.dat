500|$|In response, Yeats {{delivered}} {{a series of}} speeches that attacked the [...] "quixotically impressive" [...] ambitions {{of the government and}} clergy, likening their campaign tactics to those of [...] "medieval Spain." [...] "Marriage is not to us a Sacrament, but, upon the other hand, the love of a man and woman, and the inseparable physical desire, are sacred. This conviction has come to us through ancient philosophy and modern literature, and <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> a most sacrilegious thing to persuade two people who hate each other... to live together, and it is to us no remedy to permit them to part if neither can re-marry." [...] The resulting debate has been described as one of Yeats's [...] "supreme public moments", and began his ideological move away from pluralism towards religious confrontation.|$|E
500|$|... 'Parthian frontality', {{as we are}} now {{accustomed}} to call it, deeply differs both from ancient Near Eastern and from Greek frontality, though it is, no doubt, an offspring of the latter. For both in Oriental art and in Greek art, frontality was an exceptional treatment: in Oriental art it was a treatment strictly reserved for {{a small number of}} traditional characters of cult and myth; in Greek art it was an option resorted to only for definite reasons, when demanded by the subject, and, on the whole, seldom made use of. With Parthian art, on the contrary, frontality becomes the normal treatment of the figure. For the Parthians frontality is really nothing but the habit of showing, in relief and in painting, all figures full-face, even at the expense (as <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> moderns) of clearness and intelligibility. So systematic is this use that it amounts to a complete banishment de facto of the side-view and of all intermediate attitudes. This singular state of things seems to have become established {{in the course of the}} 1st century A.D.|$|E

[...] The Pennsylvania Inquirer reprinted {{it with the}} heading [...] "A Beautiful Poem". Elizabeth Barrett wrote to Poe, [...] "Your 'Raven' has produced a sensation, a fit o' horror, here in England. Some {{of my friends are}} taken by the fear of it and some by the music. I hear of persons haunted by 'Nevermore'." [...] Poe's popularity resulted in invitations to recite [...] "The Raven" [...] and to lecture– in public and at private social gatherings. At one literary salon, a guest noted, [...] "to hear [...] repeat the Raven... is an event in one's life." [...] It was recalled by someone who experienced it, [...] "He would turn down the lamps till the room was almost dark, then standing {{in the center of the}} apartment he would recite... in the most melodious of voices... So marvelous was his power as a reader that the auditors would be afraid to draw breath lest the enchanted spell be broken." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{theory of}} Forms (or theory of Ideas) {{typically}} {{refers to the}} belief that the material world as <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> is not the real world, but only an [...] "image" [...] or [...] "copy" [...] of the real world. In some of Plato's dialogues, this is expressed by Socrates, who spoke of forms in formulating {{a solution to the problem}} of universals. The forms, according to Socrates, are archetypes or abstract representations of the many types of things, and properties we feel and see around us, that can only be perceived by reason (...) [...] (That is, they are universals.) In other words, Socrates was able to recognize two worlds: the apparent world, which constantly changes, and an unchanging and unseen world of forms, which may be the cause of what is apparent.|$|E
2500|$|The {{relationship}} between Ainsworth and Cruikshank continued until Saint James's, the final novel {{that the two}} worked together on. It is possible that it resulted from Ainsworth selling his magazine or that Ainsworth drifted from Cruikshank after not needing an illustrator for some time. Of the {{relationship between}} author and illustrator, the Athenaeum printed a review which claimed that it was [...] "doubtful whether the plates were etched for the book, or the book written to illustrate the plates" [...] but stated such with a negative purpose. This was followed by those like William Makepeace Thackeray that complimented the power of Cruikshank's illustrations on the story: [...] "With regard to the modern romance of 'Jack Sheppard' [...] <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> that Mr. Cruikshank really created the tale, and that Mr. Ainsworth, as it were, only put words to it." ...|$|E
