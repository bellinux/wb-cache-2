40|$|Over {{the last}} three decades {{important}} advances have been made in developing sales <b>forecasting</b> methods that more accurately reflect market place conditions. However, surveys of sales <b>forecasting</b> practice continue to report only marginal gains in sales <b>forecasting</b> effectiveness. This gap between theory and practice has been identified as a significant issue for sales <b>forecasting</b> research. The literature suggests that this gap should be addressed by examining new factors in sales <b>forecasting.</b> Accuracy, bias, timeliness, cost and environmental turbulence are the most studied <b>forecasting</b> criteria in sales <b>forecasting</b> effectiveness. There are some literatures which address how these factors are affected by the <b>forecast</b> methods the firm uses. Empirical evidence on such a role of the <b>forecasting</b> method is lacking, and existing literature {{does not take into account}} whether <b>forecasting</b> criteria's influence on export sales <b>forecasting</b> effectiveness vary depending on the <b>forecasting</b> methods used by the firm. This is the first research gap identified during the literature review. Furthermore, the role of export sales <b>forecasting.</b> effectiveness on export market performance have received only limited attention to date. Linking the <b>forecasting</b> effectiveness to the business performance was reported to be critical in evaluating and improving the firm's sales <b>forecasting</b> capability and sales <b>forecasting</b> climate. However, empirical evidence of this linkage is missing and this is the second gap this study addresses. A conceptual model is proposed and multivariate analysis technique is used to investigate the relationship between dependent (<b>forecasting</b> effectiveness and export performance) and independent variables (<b>forecasting</b> criteria, <b>forecasting</b> methods, managerial characteristics, organizational characteristics and export market orientation). Our finding revealed the impact of bias, timeliness and cost on <b>forecasting</b> effectiveness varies depending on the <b>forecasting</b> methods used by the firm. But no moderating impact of <b>forecasting</b> methods has been found for accuracy and environmental turbulence. Moreover, this study reported the linkage between <b>forecasting</b> effectiveness and export performance when composite <b>forecasting</b> method is used. Identifying the relative importance of all the factors (i. e. accuracy, bias, cost, timeliness, <b>forecasting</b> methods, etc) it becomes possible to set priorities directly reflecting managerial preferences for different <b>forecast</b> criteria. If implementation of such priorities is seen to contradict principles of good <b>forecasting</b> practice, action can be taken to inform managers of the potential negative consequences...|$|R
