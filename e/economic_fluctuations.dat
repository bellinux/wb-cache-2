5|$|Keynes's {{prescription}} for strong public investment had ties to {{his interest in}} uncertainty. Keynes had given a unique perspective on statistical inference in A Treatise on Probability, written in 1921, years before his major economic works. Keynes thought strong public investment and fiscal policy would counter the negative impacts the uncertainty of <b>economic</b> <b>fluctuations</b> can have on the economy. While Keynes's successors {{paid little attention to}} the probabilistic parts of his work, uncertainty may have played a central part in the investment and liquidity-preference aspects of General Theory.|$|E
5|$|Friedman {{was best}} known for {{reviving}} interest in the money supply as a determinant of the nominal value of output, that is, the quantity theory of money. Monetarism is the set of views associated with modern quantity theory. Its origins {{can be traced back}} to the 16th-century School of Salamanca or even further; however, Friedman's contribution is largely responsible for its modern popularization. He co-authored, with Anna Schwartz, A Monetary History of the United States, 1867–1960 (1963), which was an examination of the role of the money supply and economic activity in the U.S. history. A striking conclusion of their research regarded the way in which money supply fluctuations contribute to <b>economic</b> <b>fluctuations.</b> Several regression studies with David Meiselman during the 1960s suggested the primacy of the money supply over investment and government spending in determining consumption and output. These challenged a prevailing, but largely untested, view on their relative importance. Friedman's empirical research and some theory supported the conclusion that the short-run effect of a change of the money supply was primarily on output but that the longer-run effect was primarily on the price level.|$|E

40|$|We {{establish}} a vulnerability analytical framework of CISN, and illustrate the impact path of <b>economic</b> <b>fluctuation</b> on CISN performance. Based on this, we propose an improved cascading failure model with directed weighted network, and design five network performance indicators (i. e., relative value of cascading failure, average path length, relative value of maximal connected sub-graphs, network efficiency, and structure entropy). Taking three coal eco-industrial parks in China as cases, we simulate {{and compare the}} impacts on CISN vulnerability (i. e., equality-based, dependent-based, and nested-based CISNs) of <b>economic</b> <b>fluctuation.</b> The {{results indicate that the}} interaction between <b>economic</b> <b>fluctuation</b> and network structure is the key factor in determining system vulnerability. Concerning overall vulnerability, equality-based CISN is highest, dependent-based CISN is next, and nested-based CISN is lowest. Regarding disturbance type, the changes in the five performance indicators of the three types of CISN are more intense under energy price shocks than with declining demand. Moreover, the cascading failure scale of equality-based CISN is greatest with declining demand, while the other two kinds of CISN’s is greatest under energy price shocks. Concerning disturbance intensity, equality-based CISN shows initial value sensitivity to <b>economic</b> <b>fluctuation,</b> and nested-based CISN has the strongest tolerances for <b>economic</b> <b>fluctuation.</b> From the network performance perspective, the performance of nested-based CISN is superior to that of dependent-based and equality-based CISNs. Due to longer average path length and lower network efficiency, the failure diffusion trend of equality-based CISN shows the curve of Type-S, and the diffusion rate is smooth and slow. Contrariwise, the initial diffusion rate of dependent-based CISN is the highest, indicating that the loss of system efficiency can somewhat improve the system’s anti-risk ability...|$|R

A rising interest rate environment may seem to help financial institutions, but the effect of the changes on consumers and businesses is not predictable and the challenge remains for banks to grow and effectively manage the spread to generate a return to their shareholders.|$|E
25|$|The IMF's {{role was}} {{fundamentally}} altered by the floating exchange rates post-1971. It shifted to examining the economic policies of countries with IMF loan agreements {{to determine if}} a shortage of capital was due to <b>economic</b> <b>fluctuations</b> or economic policy. The IMF also researched what types of government policy would ensure economic recovery. A particular concern of the IMF was to prevent financial crisis, such as those in Mexico 1982, Brazil in 1987, East Asia in 1997–98 and Russia in 1998, from spreading and threatening the entire global financial and currency system. The challenge was to promote and implement policy that reduced the frequency of crises among the emerging market countries, especially the middle-income countries which are vulnerable to massive capital outflows. Rather than maintaining a position of oversight of only exchange rates, their function became one of surveillance of the overall macroeconomic performance of member countries. Their role became a lot more active because the IMF now manages economic policy rather than just exchange rates.|$|E
