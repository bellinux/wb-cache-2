However, within lunar craters, even plasma currents become substantially reduced which then greatly increases electric 'dissipation times, This work will involve the advancement of the stepping astronaut charge model, by considering the charging and plasma dissipation of a rolling rover wheel, The objective of this work {{is to determine the}} nature of charging and discharging for a rover wheel as it rolls along the cold, plasma-starved lunar polar regions. The rotating wheel accumulates charge via contact electrification (tribo-charging) with the lunar regolith. This tribo-charging is dependent on the composition of the objects in contact, with insulators and conductors charging differently. Given the <b>environmental</b> <b>plasma</b> in the region, we then determine the dissipation time for the wheel to bleed off its excess charge into the surrounding plasma.

Recent laboratory measurements on negatively biased high voltage solar cells at Physical Sciences Inc.

Our observations show that exposing these cells to moderate levels (10 exp - 3 torr-min) of H 2 O vapor enhances the arcing frequency, while heating to 85 C to remove water vapor significantly reduces the arc frequency. The interaction of the adhesive used to attach the cover glass to the solar cell with ambient water vapor is the key factor in determining arcing rates. Elimination of adhesive exposed to the <b>environmental</b> <b>plasma</b> reduces the arc frequency more than two orders of magnitude, and eliminates any sensitivity to H 2 O exposure.

40|$|Abstract. The {{dynamics}} of an electrodynamic tether in a three-body gravitational environment are investigated. In the classical two-body scenario {{the extraction of}} power is {{at the expense of}} orbital kinetic energy. As a result of power extraction, an electrodynamic tether satellite system loses altitude and deorbits. This concept has been proposed and well investigated in the past, for example for orbital debris mitigation and spent stages reentry. On the other hand, in the three-body scenario an electrodynamic tether can be placed in an equilibrium position fixed with respect to the two primary bodies without deorbiting, {{and at the same time}} generate power for onboard use. The appearance of new equilibrium positions in the perturbed three-body problem allow this to happen as the electrical power is extracted at the expenses of the plasma corotating with the primary body. Fundamental differences between the classical twobody dynamics and the new phenomena appearing in the circular restricted three-body problem perturbed by the electrodynamic force of the electrodynamic tether are shown in the paper. An interesting application of an electrodynamic tether placed in the Jupiter plasma torus is then considered, in which the electrodynamic tether generates useful electrical power of about 1 kW with a 20 -km-long electrodynamic tether from the <b>environmental</b> <b>plasma</b> without losing orbital energy...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we explore the {{effectiveness}} of an artificial mini-magnetosphere as a potential radiation shelter for long term human space missions. Our study includes the differences that the plasma environment makes to {{the efficiency of the}} shielding from the high energy charged particle component of solar and cosmic rays, which radically alters the power requirements. The incoming electrostatic charges are shielded by fields supported by the self captured <b>environmental</b> <b>plasma</b> of the solar wind, potentially augmented with additional density. The artificial magnetic field generated on board acts as the means of confinement and control. Evidence for similar behaviour of electromagnetic fields and ionised particles in interplanetary space can be gained by the example of the enhanced shielding effectiveness of naturally occurring "mini-magnetospheres" on the moon. The shielding effect of surface magnetic fields of the order of ~ 100 s nanoTesla is sufficient to provide effective shielding from solar proton bombardment that culminate in visible discolouration of the lunar regolith known as "lunar swirls". Supporting evidence comes from theory, laboratory experiments and computer simulations that have been obtained on this topic. The result of this work is, hopefully, to provide the tools for a more realistic estimation of the resources versus effectiveness and risk that spacecraft engineers need to work with in designing radiation protection for long-duration human space missions.

40|$|Abstract In {{this work}} {{the problem of}} Plasma Brake has been characterised from an orbital flight {{mechanics}} point of view. Plasma Brake thrusters are essentially braking devices which provide active and controllable spacecraft acceleration by means of electrostatically charged tethers interacting with the <b>environmental</b> <b>plasma.</b> A simplified and approximated Plasma Brake model has been created {{in order to reduce}} computational times and keep acceptable errors for preliminary mission design analyses. The model has been specifically adapted to circular, Low Earth Orbits (LEOs) and implemented into an orbital simulator written in Matlab® code. The main task of the orbital simulator is the determination of the de-orbiting time of a spacecraft, given initial calendar date, its initial orbital parameters (or equivalently position and velocity vectors), and the tethers system characteristics. The simulator has been validated by comparison with a reference ISS de-orbiting profile and the approximated Plasma Brake model errors have been estimated. The local optimal control laws have been also identified for the minimum de-orbiting time between two reference altitudes and for a reference spacecraft. A sensitivity study has been conducted with respect to the reference configuration and some peculiarities of the physics involved in the Plasma Brake problem have been identified, including analogies with the atmospheric drag. The complete Plasma Brake model has then been implemented into the orbital simulator, extending the analysis to non-circular orbits and in particular to interplanetary re-entry trajectories. In this scenario, a very basic feasibility study of a “plasma-capture” mission has been performed, considering an interplanetary mission re-entering from the planet Mars (with the hypotheses of circular and coplanar planetary orbits, Hohmann transfer, and hyperbolic re-entry). Finally, Plasma Brake performances were evaluated and compared with different propulsive technologies, outlining advantages in using Plasma Brake thrusters instead of the conventional and already space-qualified ones...|$|E
40|$|In 2007, the National Academy of Sciences {{identified}} the lunar polar regions as special environments: very cold locations where resources can be trapped and accumulated. These accumulated resources not only provide a natural reservoir for human explorers, but their very presence {{may provide a}} history of lunar impact events and possibly an indication of ongoing surface reactive chemistry. The recent LCROSS impacts confirm that polar crater floors are rich in material including approx 5 %wt of water. An {{integral part of the}} special lunar polar environment is the solar wind plasma. Solar wind protons and electrons propagate outward from the Sun, and at the Moon's position have a nominal density of 5 el/cubic cm, flow speed of 400 km/sec, and temperature of 10 eV (approx. equal 116000 K). At the sub-solar point, the flow of this plasma is effectively vertically incident at the surface. However, at the poles and along the lunar terminator region, the flow is effectively horizontal over the surface. As recently described, in these regions, local topography has a significant effect on the solar wind flow. Specifically, as the solar wind passes over topographic features like polar mountains and craters, the plasma flow is obstructed and creates a distinct plasma void in the downstream region behind the obstacle. An ion sonic wake structure forms behind the obstacle, not unlike that which forms behind a space shuttle. In the downstream region where flow is obstructed, the faster moving solar wind electrons move into the void region ahead of the more massive ions, thereby creating an ambipolar electric field pointing into the void region. This electric field then deflects ion trajectories into the void region by acting as a vertical inward force that draws ions to the surface. This solar wind 'orographic' effect is somewhat analogous to that occurring with terrestrial mountains. However, in the solar wind, the ambipolar E-field operating in the collision less plasma replaces the gradient in pressure that would act in a collisional neutral gas. Human systems (roving astronauts or robotic systems created by humans) may be required {{to gain access to the}} crater floor to collect resources such as water and other cold-trapped material. However, these human systems are also exposed to the above-described harsh thermal and electrical environments in the region. Thus, the objective of this work is to determine the nature of charging and discharging for a roving object in the cold, plasma-starved lunar polar regions. To accomplish this objective, we first define the electrical charging environment within polar craters. We then describe the subsequent charging of a moving object near and within such craters. We apply a model of an astronaut moving in periodic steps/cadence over a surface regolith. In fact the astronaut can be considered an analog for any kind of moving human system. An astronaut stepping over the surface accumulates charge via contact electrification (tribocharging) v. lith the lunar regolith. We present a model of this tribo-charge build-up. Given the <b>environmental</b> <b>plasma</b> in the region, we determine herein the dissipation time for the astronaut to bleed off its excess charge into the surrounding plasma...|$|E

Intriguing configurations of the EF lines will be of significant interest to validate theoretical models in order to refine the non-equilibrium plasma chemistry kinetics. Furthermore, this preliminary work provides important insights into various applications involving IW driven discharges such as liquid activation, <b>environmental</b> treatments, <b>plasma</b> medicine, active flow control and plasma agriculture.

40|$|Recent results {{regarding}} {{the interactions between}} a body and its <b>environmental</b> space <b>plasma,</b> made by charged particle probes mounted in the bay of the Space Shuttle Orbiter Columbia (STS 3 mission), are compared with earlier results, obtained from small ionospheric satellites, {{in an attempt to}} widen our scope of knowledge and understanding regarding such interactions. The objective is to work toward a unified model of body-space plasma interactions in the solar system covering a variety of plasma and body conditions. The comparisons focus mainly on (1) the (wake/ram) current ratio; (2) the generation of charged particle density fluctuations (indicative of plasma turbulence) around the body; and (3) the increase in electron temperature ahead and {{in the wake of the}} satellite. The main results of the comparison are that (1) the (wake/ram) current ratio (or current depletion in the wake) for the Orbiter is 1 to 2 orders of magnitude larger than the ratio for small ionospheric satellites; and (2) fluctuations in density (or turbulence) are observed for both 'large body' (Shuttle Orbiter) and 'smaller body' (standard ionospheric satellites). However, the cause of the turbulence may not be the same for both cases; (3) the results for the electronic temperature enhancement due to the Shuttle Orbiter are in contrast with measurements from smaller ionospheric satellites. A path to follow in future Shuttle experiments is suggested and caution that care be taken in interpreting local particle and field measurements...|$|R
40|$|SEAFDEC Aquaculture Department Contribution No. 220. Milkfish juveniles (40, 120 or 260 g) were acclimated to 32 ppt seawater, then {{abruptly}} transferred to water with salinities of 0, 16, 32 (control) or 48 ppt. Blood samples were taken 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 or 14 days after transfer. Survival rate was 95 % or greater in all salinities. Plasma osmolality in fish exposed to salinities other than 16 or 32 ppt deviated from control values immediately after transfer but were subsequently regulated to near normal levels after several days. Although these deviations were significant, they were relatively small (â‰¤ 20 % of initial) as plasma osmolality changed {{by less than}} 0. 07 mOsm/kg per unit change <b>environmental</b> salinity. <b>Plasma</b> chloride values generally followed {{the same pattern of}} changes as plasma osmolality. When these deviations were integrated across time, summed deviations (mOsmÂ·day kgâˆ’ 1 or mEqÂ·day lâˆ’ 1) were proportional to the osmotic or ionic gradient but were inversely proportional to size. For 40 -g fish, summed deviations were larger in 48 than in 0 ppt; for 120 - or 260 -g fish, these deviations were larger in 0 than in 48 ppt. These results indicate that small milkfish tend to adapt better to fresh than to hypersaline water while larger milkfish are more likely to find hypersaline water less stressful than freshwater. Like other organ systems previously studied in milkfish, these size-dependent adaptations in osmoregulatory mechanisms reflect natural habitat shifts during development...|$|R
