40|$|Performance of {{the furnace}} during Bridgman {{growth of the}} lead {{magnesium}} niobate-lead titanate crystal (PMN-PT) is analyzed. PMN-PT is electrostrictive ceramic that has near ideal strain-voltage function. Furthermore piezoelectric (2000 to 2300 pC/N) and coupling (92 to 95 %) constants are exceptionally good. Due to these properties PMN-PT has wide range of applications - from sonars to transducers in a high precision optical systems. In this research first attempt to crystallize PMN-PT in a Mellen type vertical Bridgman furnace was not successful, as melting temperature of precursor materials was not achieved. At this point choice was between building a new more powerful facility or finding ways to enhance performance of the existing furnace. Besides adjusting power supply to the individual heating elements, redesigning ampoule <b>holding</b> <b>cartridge</b> and improving furnace insulation one more radical improvement was proposed. The entire furnace was placed into the high pressure chamber. Further experiments confirmed that temperature inside the furnace was increased sufficiently to melt precursor materials to obtain PMN-PT. Numerical modeling is undertaken to find limitations of this technique and to predict temperature distribution inside the ampoule. It is of interest also to account for main factors contributing to a higher temperatures achieved in the furnace under the higher pressure (up to 10 atm.). Numerical model of the furnace is based on general purpose finite - element code FIDAP and on previous efforts to model Bridgman type furnace with multiply heaters. In order to account for all heat transfer mechanism involved - conduction, convection and radiation - {{different parts of the}} furnace are modeled in accordance with expected dominant mode of heat transfer - conduction in the solid parts, conduction and radiation in the ampoule, gas convection and conduction in the furnace openings complemented with wall-to-wall radiation. Because of these complicating factors, dimensional rather than non-dimensional modeling is performed using steady-state 2 -D and 3 -D models. Particular attention is paid to the modeling of radiation in a semitransparent material of ampoule 7 sapphire. The radiation model is validated by solving realistic test problem - conduction and radiation heat transfer in the fused quartz. Results are in agreement with both experimental and analytical data...|$|E
50|$|The 1895, {{as well as}} {{the later}} Model 1899 and early Model 99, used a rotary {{magazine}} to <b>hold</b> the <b>cartridges.</b> The rotating magazine uses a spring-loaded spool with grooves to <b>hold</b> the <b>cartridges.</b> The Savage 1899 took advantage of the spool to include a counter to indicate how many shots are left. The Model 99 continued using this system for many years, until its replacement with a detachable magazine.|$|R

5000|$|The rimmed cartridge, {{sometimes}} called flanged cartridge, {{is the oldest}} of the types and has a rim that is significantly larger in diameter than the base of the cartridge. Rimmed cartridges use the rim to <b>hold</b> the <b>cartridge</b> in the chamber of the firearm, with the rim serving to <b>hold</b> the <b>cartridge</b> at the proper depth in the chamber—this function is called [...] "headspacing". Because the rimmed cartridge headspaces on the rim, the case length is of less importance than rimless cartridges.|$|R
5000|$|The 610 was {{manufactured}} by Smith & Wesson on the N-frame, {{similar to the}} Smith & Wesson Model 29 in [...]44 Magnum, and the Model 28 in [...]357 Magnum. The 10mm Auto is a rimless automatic pistol cartridge so moon clips are used to <b>hold</b> <b>cartridges</b> when loading and extracting spent cases en bloc. Since the [...]40 Smith & Wesson is a shorter, less powerful variant of the 10mm Auto but has the same diameter, the Model 610 can chamber and fire [...]40 Smith & Wesson rounds.|$|R
50|$|The SDASS has an under-barrel tubular {{magazine}} {{like many}} other semi-automatic shotguns and <b>holds</b> 7 <b>cartridges</b> plus 1 in the chamber giving a total capacity of 8.|$|R
50|$|Monis's gun was a 50-year-old Manufrance LaSalle 12-gauge pump-action shotgun {{that had}} been crudely sawn off. It could <b>hold</b> three <b>cartridges</b> in the {{magazine}} {{and one in the}} barrel.|$|R
5000|$|The Reprringer is a 3D printed pepperbox firearm, {{made public}} around September 2013. It {{was created by}} Hexen. It can <b>hold</b> 5 <b>cartridges</b> and is {{chambered}} in [...]22 Caliber caps.|$|R
5000|$|Cylinders {{typically}} <b>hold</b> six <b>cartridges</b> (hence revolvers {{sometimes are}} referred to as [...] "six-shooters"), but some small-frame revolvers <b>hold</b> only 5 <b>cartridges,</b> due to the smaller overall size of the gun and small available space. The Nagant M1895 revolver has a 7-shot cylinder, the Webley-Fosbery Automatic Revolver has an 8-shot cylinder in [...]38 caliber, and the LeMat Revolver has a 9-shot cylinder. Several models of [...]22 rimfire-caliber revolvers have cylinders holding 9 or 10 rounds.|$|R
50|$|The first {{cartridges}} in Bergmann pistols were grooveless, {{with the}} bullets having a sharp nose to avoid jams. Later pistols, however, have mechanical extractors and cartridges with grooved flanges. The M96 had an internal box-magazine <b>holding</b> five <b>cartridges.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A {{revolver}} is {{a unique}} type of firearm in which a rotating cylinder holds a number of cartridges; the cylinder [...] "revolves" [...] to align each [...] "chamber" [...] or [...] "charge hole" [...] with {{the rear of the}} barrel, <b>hold</b> the <b>cartridge</b> and contain the pressure (up to 65,000 pounds per square inch or 450 MPa) produced when the cartridge is fired. Thus the cylinder serves as both magazine and firing chambers. There are also [...] "single- shot" [...] and multiple barrel firearms, which <b>hold</b> only one <b>cartridge</b> per barrel and must be reloaded manually between shots.|$|R
50|$|A {{stripper}} clip (also {{known as}} a charger or charger clip, especially in British and in Commonwealth military vocabulary) is a speedloader that <b>holds</b> several <b>cartridges</b> (usually consisting between 5 and 10 rounds) together in a single unit for easier and faster loading of a firearm's magazine.|$|R
5000|$|The 646 {{is unusual}} {{in that it is}} a {{revolver}} chambered for a rimless cartridge generally used only for semi-automatic pistols. In order to effectively use the rimless [...]40 S&W cartridge, the revolver utilized moon clips, a metal flange which <b>holds</b> the <b>cartridges</b> in place for loading and ejection.|$|R
50|$|In {{computer}} storage, a tape library, {{sometimes called}} a tape silo, tape robot or tape jukebox, is a storage device which contains {{one or more}} tape drives, a number of slots to <b>hold</b> tape <b>cartridges,</b> a barcode reader to identify tape cartridges and an automated method for loading tapes (a robot).|$|R
50|$|After {{leaving the}} Army, he {{returned}} to New York in 1854 and assisted his father George as the Assistant Editor of the New York Home Journal. Morris and Charles L. Brown are credited with a patent for an improved firearm with a conical cylinder <b>holding</b> 8 <b>cartridges</b> which was patented in 1860.|$|R
5000|$|One of the [...]32 H&R magnum's {{favorable}} attributes is that {{it offers}} [...]38 Special energy levels and allows a small-frame revolver to <b>hold</b> 6 <b>cartridges,</b> whereas a similarly sized revolver in [...]38 special would only hold 5 rounds. Penetration is also increased compared to the [...]38 special with bullets of the same weight.|$|R
5000|$|This allows some {{firearms}} chambered {{for similar}} rimmed cartridges to safely chamber and fire shorter cartridges, such as using [...]38 Special cartridges in a [...]357 Magnum revolver. Rimmed cartridges are {{well suited to}} certain types of actions, such as revolvers, where the rim helps <b>hold</b> the <b>cartridge</b> in position, and break-action firearms.|$|R
5000|$|Spider-Man {{keeps his}} regular field {{equipment}} in a utility belt that can carry extra web fluid cartridges, spider-tracers, and his camera. The belt can {{hold up to}} 30 cartridges, each one being pressured to 300 psi. The belt's buckle contains a small but powerful light, which is filtered through a lens decorated with a stylized likeness of Spider-Man's mask. This spider-signal is mostly limited to intimidating weak-nerved criminals and acting as a wide-beam flashlight. It is sometimes used to call for help, as well. The Utility belt and the spider-signal is later used in The Spectacular Spider-Man. At his job at Horizon Labs, Peter has upgraded his utility belt to <b>hold</b> <b>cartridges</b> {{of different types of}} webbing and his Spider-Signal has a UV light setting for forensic analysis.In [...] "The Amazing Spider-Man" [...] video game and the MCU Spider-Man films, Spider-Man's default costume has a utility belt. In Captain America: Civil War, the spider-signal in his web shooters is revealed in the second end credits scene.|$|R
5000|$|The early Dreyse needle {{guns were}} smooth-bore. Later Dreyse guns {{adopted by the}} Prussian army were rifles using {{self-contained}} combustible <b>cartridges</b> <b>holding</b> oblong lead balls held in a papier-mâché [...] "sabot".|$|R
2500|$|A Six Gun is a {{revolver}} that <b>holds</b> six <b>cartridges.</b> The cylinder in a six gun {{is often called}} a 'wheel', and the six gun is itself often called a 'wheel gun'. Although a [...] "Six Gun" [...] can refer to any six-chambered revolver, it is typically {{a reference to the}} Colt Single Action Army, or its modern look-alikes such as the Ruger Vaquero and Beretta Stampede.|$|R
50|$|A unique {{feature of}} this pistol model is the {{unloading}} device. While the breechblock is held open, pulling down on the serrated lever {{on the right side}} {{at the top of the}} grip panel will withdraw the lip which is <b>holding</b> the <b>cartridges</b> in the magazine, enabling the magazine spring to move the platform up and force all the cartridges out of the magazine.|$|R
50|$|Rifles {{using this}} action include the M1870 Belgian Comblain, M1872 Mylonas, Sharps rifle, Farquharson rifle, 1890 Stevens, Sharps-Borchardt Model 1878, Winchester Model 1885, Browning model 1885, Browning M78 and Ruger No. 1 & No. 3. Falling-block action {{military}} rifles were {{common in the}} 19th century. They were replaced for military use by the faster bolt action rifles, which typically reloaded from a magazine <b>holding</b> several <b>cartridges.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A Six Gun is a {{revolver}} that <b>holds</b> six <b>cartridges.</b> The cylinder in a six gun {{is often called}} a 'wheel', and the six gun is itself often called a 'wheel gun'. Although a [...] "Six Gun" [...] can refer to any six-chambered revolver, it is typically {{a reference to the}} Colt Single Action Army, or its modern look-alikes such as the Ruger Vaquero and Beretta Stampede.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{variation}} of the speedloader for revolvers is the Speed Strip introduced by Bianchi International. Intended {{as an alternative to}} loose rounds in a pocket or dump pouch, it <b>holds</b> six <b>cartridges</b> in a re-usable Neoprene plastic strip. The strip operates by placing the cartridges one or two at a time into their respective chambers, and [...] "breaking" [...] the rounds off the strip into the chamber.|$|R
50|$|Signal Pistol 50 is a {{flare gun}} {{used in the}} Swedish Armed Forces. It is used to provide pre-agreed light signals, for example, from the main {{infantry}} troops to an artillery unit. It {{can also be used}} for directional guidance and for illumination of terrain. The signal gun can carried be in on the belt or bag to battle harness. The cover of the Signal Pistol 50 <b>holds</b> 4 <b>cartridges.</b>|$|R
50|$|Underwater, ordinary-shaped bullets are {{inaccurate}} {{and have}} a very short-range. The APS fires a 120 mm (4.75 in) long 5.66 mm calibre steel bolt (specially designed for this rifle and has been mistaken as 5.56 mm). Its magazine <b>holds</b> 26 <b>cartridges.</b> The APS's barrel is not rifled; the fired projectile is kept in line by hydrodynamic effects; as a result, the APS is somewhat inaccurate when fired out of water.|$|R
50|$|The first {{generation}} of Ultrium tapes {{were going to be}} available with four types of <b>cartridge,</b> <b>holding</b> 10 GB, 30 GB, 50 GB, and 100 GB. Only the full length 100 GB tapes were produced.|$|R
50|$|Combat {{shotguns}} {{typically have}} much shorter barrels than shotguns used for hunting and usually, though not always, have magazines of modified design to hold {{more than the}} 3 to 5 shots normal with sporting or hunting shotguns. Most combat shotguns have tubular magazines to <b>hold</b> the <b>cartridges,</b> mounted underneath the barrel, identical to those of hunting shotguns except for being longer to hold more ammunition, though some recent designs have detachable box magazines.|$|R
50|$|In 1979 the Royal Netherlands Air Force {{acquired}} 25 KL/MSS-6720 Flycatcher radarsystem and upgraded 75 {{of their}} 40L70s to create 25 firing units for static air base defense. The improved guns had an increased {{rate of fire}} (300 rounds/min) and the loading mechanism was provided with extended guides {{so that it could}} <b>hold</b> 22 <b>cartridges.</b> A 220V diesel generator was mounted onto the undercarriage. This generator was powered by a Volkswagen diesel engine.|$|R
5000|$|Ammunition was {{packaged}} in 40-round boxes sufficient to fill one magazine. Five boxes were packed in a carton {{corresponding to the}} five-magazine pouches, and three cartons were carried in a light canvas bandolier <b>holding</b> 600 <b>cartridges.</b> Five bandoliers were packed in a wooden crate. Ammunition produced by Remington is headstamped [...] "RA" [...] (or [...] "RAH" [...] for the Hoboken, New Jersey plant) with the years (19-) [...] "18", [...] "19", and [...] "20".|$|R
50|$|When {{the sliding}} tape pack would pull itself tight, for {{whatever}} reason, a jammed 8-track cartridge was the result. A quick {{solution was to}} <b>hold</b> the <b>cartridge</b> in one hand, facing down, while pulling out a section of, about 4-6' in length from the outer winding side. A quick tug on the tape would cause it to immediately wind in {{and the result was}} a loosened up tape pack that would play correctly.|$|R
50|$|The primary {{purposes}} of the firearm action are <b>holding</b> the <b>cartridge</b> {{in place in the}} chamber, and providing a way to ignite the propellant. In a single-shot action, little additional functionality is provided, while in a semi-automatic firearm the action also taps energy from the firing process for cycling to fire the next round. From an accuracy perspective, the primary goal of the action is to achieve a consistent placement of the cartridge in the chamber every shot.|$|R
5000|$|Several {{models of}} the 3851 were available. The {{smallest}} A1 <b>holding</b> 706 <b>cartridges</b> storing 35.3GB, while the largest A4 held 4,720 cartridges storing 236GB in a 20 ft long unit. All of the units were also available in the [...] "B models" [...] which added a second controller for on-line backups, as well as offline storage. A second series was released on March 6, 1980, doubling maximum capacity to 472GB. The entire series was discontinued on August 5, 1986.|$|R
60|$|By {{this time}} {{everybody}} {{was up and}} dressing. I put on a light Norfolk jacket over my mail shirt {{in order to have}} a pocket handy to <b>hold</b> my <b>cartridges,</b> and buckled on my revolver. Good did the same, but Sir Henry put on nothing except his mail shirt, steel-lined cap, and a pair of 'veldt-schoons' or soft hide shoes, his legs being bare from the knees down. His revolver he strapped on round his middle outside the armoured shirt.|$|R
50|$|The DCT and DST formats yielded {{relatively}} high capacity and speed for data and video. Double-density DST data storage {{was introduced in}} 1996. The final generation of these products were quad density, introduced in 2000, resulting in a large <b>cartridge</b> <b>holding</b> 660GB of data.|$|R
50|$|Games are {{generally}} sold in separate cartridges, {{but there are}} 4-in-1 <b>cartridges</b> <b>holding</b> 4 distinct games. Later games seem to be only available in this manner. Also, each 4-in-1 pack comes numbered and higher numbers seem to provide games that are more refined in presentation.|$|R
