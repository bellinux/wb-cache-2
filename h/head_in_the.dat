They found Plath dead of carbonmonoxide poisoning with her <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> oven, having sealed the rooms between her and her sleeping children with tape, towels and cloths. At approximately 4:30am, Plath had placed her <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> oven, with the gas turned on. She was 30years old.|$|E
5|$|Alarmed at {{the popular}} appeal of Paine's Rights of Man, the king issued a {{proclamation}} against seditious writings in May 1792.

Johnson testified, publicly distancing himself from Paine and Barlow, {{despite the fact that}} the defendants were received sympathetically by the juries.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the astronomical}} armillary sphere (representing the {{celestial}} sphere) existed in China since the 1st century BCE, the mathematician and court astronomer Zhang Heng (78–139 CE) provided it with motive power {{by using the}} constant pressure head of an inflow water clock to rotate a waterwheel that acted {{on a set of}} gears. Zhang Heng was also the first {{to address the problem of}} the falling pressure <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> inflow water clock (which gradually slowed the timekeeping) by setting up an additional tank between the reservoir and inflow vessel.|$|E

5|$|Boddingtons Brewery was a {{regional}} brewery in Manchester, England, which owned pubs throughout the North West. Boddingtons {{was best known}} for Boddingtons Bitter (Boddies), a straw-golden, hoppy bitter {{which was one of}} the first beers to be packaged in cans containing a widget, giving it a creamy draught-style <b>head.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 1990s, the beer was promoted as The Cream of Manchester in a popular advertising campaign credited with raising Manchester's profile.

The priest was warned in time, however, and escaped into the woods with his papers, but the militia burned the village and church.|$|E

5|$|In April 1941, the {{division}} {{was assigned to}} IV Corps and had moved to Sussex, the 18th Infantry Division having replaced them around Liverpool.

Surprise was lost when a musket was accidentally discharged, and the Battle of Sedgemoor resulted in defeat for the Duke. He later lost his <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Tower of London, and nine locals were executed for treason.|$|E

5|$|On September 27, {{the guerrillas}} assassinated the French-installed chief of Gò Công, {{displaying}} his severed <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> town market.

The killing {{had the effect of}} intimidating the chief's designated successor into submitting to the rebels and ceasing his service for the French. In November 1861, Định's men went into the town of Mỹ Tho to recruit militants and collect food supplies. During this time, they attacked and burned pro-French villages and their leaders.|$|E

He also worked in a coal pit at Clayton-le-Moors. He died on 26 September 1903 in Blackburn. His burial was paid for by Lancashire County Cricket Club. Throwing in cricket came to a <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early part of the twentieth century when the careers of a number of professional bowlers came to a close, most notably those of Lancashire's Arthur Mold, Somerset's Ted Tyler and Leicestershire's Frederic Geeson.|$|E
5|$|Goebel's {{abrasive}} personality {{made him}} many political enemies, but his championing of populist causes, like railroad regulation, also won him many friends. This conflict of opinions {{came to a}} <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Kentucky gubernatorial election of 1899. Goebel, a Democrat, divided his party with self-serving political tactics {{at a time when}} Kentucky Republicans were finally gaining strength, having elected the party's first governor four years previously. These dynamics led to a close contest between Goebel and William S. Taylor. In the politically chaotic climate that resulted, Goebel was assassinated. Everyone charged in connection with the murder was either acquitted or eventually pardoned, and the identity of his assassin remains uncertain.|$|E

5|$|He re-invented the {{practice}} of stiff-arming his tacklers, which {{had gone out of}} favor among running backs in the 1970s. At times, he used his high school experience as a long jumper to leap over his opponents, landing on his <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> end zone to gain a touchdown in a game against the Buffalo Bills. His running gait was somewhat unusual, as his knees were minimally bent, and the motion was largely powered from the hip. This may have given his knees, a football player's most vulnerable joints, some protection, although he underwent arthroscopic surgery on both knees in 1983. He referred to this procedure as an 11,000-yard checkup.|$|E

5|$|In the Thai Ramakien, Hanuman helps Vibhishana (here called Phipek) kill a demon.

Hanuman agrees, on the condition that he remain with her for only a month. While Hanuman leaves for Ayodhya with Rama, Trijata gives birth to his son Hanuman Tegangga (Asurapada). The Javanese and Sundanese Wayang puppet tradition also portrays Trijata as the wife of Hanuman.|$|E
