5|$|In November 2011, the {{government}} laid {{a plan to}} cut utilities subsidies to higher income households. By mid-2011, credit was outpacing GDP by a wide margin, raising concerns that the economy was overheating. Argentina began a period of fiscal austerity in 2012. In April 2012, {{the government}} announced plans to <b>expropriate</b> YPF, despite the opposition of some energy experts, claiming that YPF's Spanish partner and major holder, Repsol, had not done his duty as to provide the financial support for research and land exploitation, {{as well as being}} a bad administrator concerned only in sending profits to Spain and forsaking YPF's economic growth.|$|E
5|$|The project {{continued}} {{to run into}} difficulties with malfunctions, financial problems and threats of work stoppages. New letters patent were issued on 12 August 1779 that doubled the rates and extended the term to ninety-nine years. The concessionary could now also <b>expropriate</b> land for shops, warehouses and housing for employees. The work was complete in May 1780 and was finally opened for navigation from Givors to Rive-de-Gier the following December. The concessionaries {{reported that they had}} spent six million francs, but the canal probably cost much more.|$|E
5|$|Within {{their limited}} jurisdictions, {{municipalities}} are autonomous, responsible and accountable to their citizens, to the province and their future {{residents in the}} case for the unpopulated Jumbo Glacier Mountain Resort Municipality. Their powers and responsibilities are regulated through the Local Government Act of British Columbia, the Community Charter, and, in the case of Vancouver, the Vancouver Charter. They have the power of a natural person, the power to <b>expropriate,</b> and the power to establish and enforce bylaws. They are able to raise funds through property taxes and user fees, and borrow a limited amount through the Municipal Finance Authority of British Columbia to pay for capital costs.|$|E
40|$|The paper aims to {{describe}} a legal {{problem in the}} application of rules governing the restitution of <b>expropriated</b> real estate - namely a situation in which one of the entities entitled to restitution of <b>expropriated</b> property, turns out to be a municipality or the State Treasury, as a statutory heir of the previous owner. Usually, the State Treasury, as one of the heirs, does not have an interest in supporting the request for the restitution of <b>expropriated</b> property. The author is of the opinion that the proper interpretation of rules governing the restitution of <b>expropriated</b> real estate requires the assumption that whenever one of the statutory heirs {{turns out to be the}} State Treasury, consent to request a restitution of <b>expropriated</b> real estate by the State Treasury is not required. In the absence of such an agreement, the competent authority is obliged to grant the restitution of the <b>expropriated</b> real estate to all heirs...|$|R

[...] The Russell Theatre, which was also burnt on that date got <b>expropriated</b> for demolition {{in order to bring}} about these plans. The Federal District Commission later <b>expropriated</b> the hotel's site. The church was <b>expropriated</b> November 20, 1930. City Hall burned down March 31, 1931.|$|R

5|$|After the United States entered World War II on December 7, 1941, the Federal {{government}} {{set up the}} War Shipping Administration {{to manage}} the vitally important maritime shipping and Naval support needs of the U.S. and its Allies, including the power to <b>expropriate</b> civilian-owned boats. On April 1, 1942, the government acquired the Old Bay Line's State of Virginia and State of Maryland. On July 13, the President Warfield and Yorktown were also taken over. Thus, by mid-1942, four of the Old Bay Line's six ships had become government property, leaving the company only the two oldest and smallest ships in its fleet {{for the duration of}} the war, the City of Norfolk and City of Richmond.|$|E
5|$|By 1990, 52,000 black {{families}} had been settled on 6.5 million acres. This was insufficient {{to deal with}} the country's overcrowding problem, which was being exacerbated by the growth in the black population. That year, Zimbabwe's parliament passed an amendment allowing the government to <b>expropriate</b> land at a fixed price while denying land-owners the right of appeal to the courts. The government hoped that by doing so it could settle 110,000 {{black families}} on 13 million acres, which would require the expropriation of approximately half of all white-owned land. Zimbabwe's Commercial Farmers Union argued that the proposed measures would wreck the country's economy, urging the government to instead settle landless blacks on the half-a-million acres of land that was either unproductive or state-owned.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, after {{receiving}} {{approval from the}} government, the Parks Commission began to <b>expropriate</b> land {{along the length of}} the river. The broadened strip of land was used to construct a new paved parkway, which was opened in segments. The new parkway was ornamental and designed to be aesthetically pleasing, a prime consideration of road construction at that time. The section south of the falls was completed first, opening in 1912. It was extended north to the Whirlpool Rapids, incorporating the existing River Road, by 1915. The section between the rapids and Queenston was opened between 1921 and 1923. Finally, the remaining section between Queenston and Niagara-on-the-Lake opened in 1931, completing the present parkway.|$|E
50|$|The {{proposed}} Hickenlooper Amendment, a rider to the 1962 {{foreign aid}} bill, would have halted aid to any country <b>expropriating</b> US property.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to define the {{position}} of an expert on an <b>expropriating</b> proceedings and creating an expert opinion for these uses. In the theoretical part the definitions connected to expropriation and <b>expropriating</b> proceedings are explained. An expert activity and an expert opinion are defined in other chapters in the theoretical part. Last two chapters deal with transportation infrastructure and evaluating of the immovable assets where there are the established price, the common price and the ways of evaluating. The practical part of the thesis {{is devoted to the}} expert opinion in <b>expropriating</b> proceedings. The established price, the standart price of <b>expropriated</b> immovable assests and compensation for moving are set in a comparing way within the expert opinion...|$|R

5|$|The {{city had}} granted {{concessions}} to the two private tram companies until 1924, after which the city could <b>expropriate</b> the companies. Both companies were well run and highly profitable, and on 1 May 1924, KSS and KES were merged and {{taken over by the}} city council, which gave the new company the name Kristiania Sporveier ("Kristiania Tramways"). The municipality owned 51 per cent. On 1 January 1925, the city changed its name to Oslo, with the company's name also changing. The light rail lines operated by Holmenkolbanen and Ekebergbanen were not taken over, nor was the Lilleaker Line operated by KES; the city council did not want to take over tram lines in Aker. The Lilleaker Line operations of KES were transferred to the private company Bærumsbanen ("The Bærum Line").|$|E
5|$|Nations and {{international}} businesses face {{an array of}} financial risks unique to foreign investment activity. Political risk {{is the potential for}} losses from a foreign country's political instability or otherwise unfavorable developments, which manifests in different forms. Transfer risk emphasizes uncertainties surrounding a country's capital controls and balance of payments. Operational risk characterizes concerns over a country's regulatory policies and their impact on normal business operations. Control risk is born from uncertainties surrounding property and decision rights in the local operation of foreign direct investments. Credit risk implies lenders may face an absent or unfavorable regulatory framework that affords little or no legal protection of foreign investments. For example, foreign governments may commit to a sovereign default or otherwise repudiate their debt obligations to international investors without any legal consequence or recourse. Governments may decide to <b>expropriate</b> or nationalize foreign-held assets or enact contrived policy changes following an investor's decision to acquire assets in the host country. Country risk encompasses both political risk and credit risk, and represents the potential for unanticipated developments in a host country to threaten its capacity for debt repayment and repatriation of gains from interest and dividends.|$|E

25|$|Zionist {{allegations}} that disproportionate force had been employed during {{what was a}} solemn occasion of prayer created an outcry throughout the diaspora. Worldwide Jewish protests remonstrated with Britain for the violence exercised at the Wall. The Jewish National Council Vaad Leumi ‘demanded that British administration <b>expropriate</b> the wall for the Jews’. In reply, the Muslims organized a Defence Committee for the Protection of the Noble Buraq, and huge crowd rallies {{took place on the}} Al-Aqsa plaza in protest. Work, often noisy, was immediately undertaken on a mosque above the Jewish prayer site. Disturbances such as opening a passage for donkeys to pass through the area, angered worshippers. After intense negotiations, the Zionist organisation denied any intent to take over the whole Haram Ash-Sharif, but demanded the government <b>expropriate</b> and raze the Moroccan quarter. A law of 1924 allowed the British authorities to <b>expropriate</b> property, and fear of this in turn greatly agitated the Muslim community, though the laws of donation of the waqf explicitly disallowed any such alienation. After lengthy deliberation, a White Paper was made public on 11 December 1928 in favour of the status quo.|$|E

50|$|The {{government}} {{generally has}} avoided <b>expropriating</b> farms. Farms to be reallocated to previously disadvantaged people are mainly bought from farm owners that wish {{to sell their}} farms. This is called the Willing buyer, willing seller principle. Any farm {{that is to be}} sold on the free market must first be offered to government. However, in 2005, government began <b>expropriating</b> commercial farms. Although only five farms had been <b>expropriated</b> in 2008, and a further 30 farm owners had received letters asking them to sell to government, this move has instilled fears in the white farming community and discouraged further investment.|$|R
