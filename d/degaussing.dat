5|$|Z38 {{was fitted}} with a FuMO 21 radar on her bridge, and four FuMB 4 Sumatra aerials were placed around the {{searchlight}} platform on her foremast. She had a <b>degaussing</b> coil around her forecastle.|$|E
5|$|Drake {{was laid}} down on 24 November 1943, at Portland, Oregon by the Willamette Iron and Steel Works, and {{launched}} on 12 August 1944. On 20 April 1945, {{her name was}} canceled, and she was re-designated as a <b>degaussing</b> vessel, YDG-11. The ship was placed in service on 15 August 1945, {{the day after the}} Japanese surrender.|$|E
5|$|The ship's {{steering}} was by a contrabalanced rudder (black, at {{left in the}} picture), {{with its}} associated steering gear located in a compartment (green in the picture) above the rudder and below the aft structure. Steam-powered generators provided electric power for radios, navigation equipment, refrigeration compressors, pumps, lighting, and <b>degaussing.</b> An evaporator produced fresh water for the boilers and for the crew.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{televisions}} {{and monitors}} automatically <b>degauss</b> their picture tube when switched on, before an image is displayed. The high current surge {{that takes place}} during this automatic <b>degauss</b> {{is the cause of}} an audible [...] "thunk" [...] or loud hum, which can be heard (and felt) when televisions and CRT computer monitors are switched on. Visually, this causes the image to shake dramatically {{for a short period of}} time. A <b>degauss</b> option is also usually available for manual selection in the operations menu in such appliances.|$|R

5|$|Z39s sensor suite {{included}} a FuMO 21 radar, which {{was placed on}} the ship's bridge, and four FuMB4 Sumatra aerials on the foremast searchlights. She also had several other radars, including a FuMB 3 Bali and FuMO 81 Berlin-S on her masthead, and a FuMO 63 Hohentwei. She also had a <b>degaussing</b> cable which wrapped around the entire ship, but was covered by her spray deflector.|$|E
5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of war, the ship was fitted with a <b>degaussing</b> coil to protect her against magnetic mines. In 1942, the ship's aircraft handling equipment and aft torpedo tubes were removed. Throughout the war, her radar suite was upgraded; in March 1941, she was equipped with FuMO 21 radar and in early 1942, a FuMO 25 radar set was installed. The latter was a search radar for surface targets and low-flying aircraft at low range. The FuMO 21 set {{was replaced by the}} short-range FuMO 63 Hohentwiel 50-centimeter radar. Nürnberg was also fitted with four Metox radar warning receivers.|$|E
5|$|The {{hardware}} for {{the original}} combat system was based around the Motorola 68000 family of processors. The replacement combat system consists of the tactical and fire control components from the Raytheon CCS Mk2 system, combined with the sonar interfaces developed for the improved combat system used aboard Sheean and Dechaineux. Countermeasures include a Condor CS-5600 ESM intercept and warning unit, and two SSE decoys. The boats are fitted with a Marconi SDG-1802 <b>degaussing</b> system, and a receive-only Link 11 combat information exchange datalink. In October 2006, Sagem Défense Sécurité was selected to fit the Collins class with SIGMA 40XP gyrolaser inertial navigation systems.|$|E
5000|$|DLTtape IV {{can support}} both DLT4000/7000/8000 and DLT1/DLT-VS80 for full functions; once DLTtape IV media {{has been written}} to or {{formatted}} in a DLT7000/8000 drive, this media cannot be read, written to, or formatted in a DLT1/DLT-VS80 drive unless it is <b>degaussed.</b> Once the media has been written to or formatted in a DLT4000 drive, the media cannot be written to or formatted in a DLT1/DLT-VS80 drive unless it is <b>degaussed</b> {{but it can be}} read. This is because the DLT1/VS series use a different recording format that is not fully supported by the other family.|$|R
50|$|Partition {{editors and}} ICKDSF today do not handle low level {{functions}} for HDDs and optical disc drives such as writing timing marks, and they cannot reinitialize a modern disk {{that has been}} <b>degaussed</b> or otherwise lost the factory formatting.|$|R
5000|$|The design {{specification}} was issued in 1946 {{and the design}} was approved in 1948. The ships were built with steel hulls which were <b>degaussed</b> but no specific {{attempt was made to}} reduce electrical or acoustic signature. Several versions were produced: ...|$|R
5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War II in September 1939, a <b>degaussing</b> coil was installed just above the waterline to protect the ship from magnetic mines. Her first wartime operation saw her participating in laying a minefield off the German coast in the North Sea on 3 September. She conducted the operation with the other light cruisers Nürnberg, Leipzig, Köln, and Königsberg and sixteen destroyers. After laying her first set of mines, she returned to Wilhelmshaven to restock her mines. While moored in the harbor, she was attacked by British bombers on 4 September; German anti-aircraft gunners shot down {{four of the five}} Blenheim bombers, one of which inadvertently crashed into the ship. Twenty-nine men were killed or wounded in the crash.|$|E
5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of war, both ships were fitted with a <b>degaussing</b> coil to protect them against magnetic mines. Leipzig had her aircraft equipment removed in 1941, along with her after torpedo tubes. In 1942, Nürnbergs aircraft handling equipment and aft torpedo tubes were also removed. Throughout the war, the ships' radar suites were upgraded; in March 1941, Nürnberg was equipped with FuMO 21 radar and in early 1942, a FuMO 25 radar set was installed. The latter was a search radar for surface targets and low-flying aircraft at low range. The FuMO 21 set {{was replaced by the}} short-range FuMO 63 Hohentwiel 50-centimeter radar. Nürnberg was also fitted with four Metox radar warning receivers. Leipzig did not receive her FuMO 24/25 radar set until 1943; this was to be the last modification for Leipzig.|$|E
5|$|The {{ships were}} reconstructed from late 1933 to mid-1936. In August 1937, the sisters transported 3,749 {{men of the}} 11th Infantry Division to Shanghai during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Their floatplanes bombed targets in Shanghai on 24 August before they {{returned}} to Sasebo the following day. Nagato became a training ship on 1 December 1937 until she again became the flagship of the Combined Fleet on 15 December 1938. The ship participated in an Imperial Fleet Review on 11 October 1940. The sisters were refitted in 1941 in preparation for war, which included the fitting of external <b>degaussing</b> coils and additional armor for their barbettes.|$|E
30|$|Hysteresis {{curves of}} {{magnetic}} moment of magnetite samples were measured {{at room temperature}} by means of vibration magnetometer at frequency of 228  Hz. For studies, we used the dry <b>degaussed</b> highly dispersive samples. To exclude interaction between particles, magnetite nanoparticles were placed in SiO 2 matrix. The installation and measurement technique is described in [21].|$|R
5000|$|Minesweepers are {{equipped}} with mechanical or electrical devices, known as [...] "sweeps", for disabling mines. The modern minesweeper is designed to reduce the chances of it detonating mines itself; it is soundproofed to reduce its acoustic signature and often constructed using wood, fiberglass or non-ferrous metal, or is <b>degaussed</b> to reduce its magnetic signature.|$|R
50|$|After commissioning, Navarro {{moved to}} the Naval Supply Depot, San Francisco to take on stores. Then, {{in a series of}} moves about San Francisco Bay, the ship took on {{ammunition}} and <b>degaussed.</b> She commenced shakedown 1 December, with a twelve-day cruise to San Pedro, and 16 December, she commenced a week of amphibious training at San Diego.|$|R
5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1941 the mitrailleuse de 25 mm contre-aéroplanes Modèle 1940, a naval {{adaptation}} of an Army anti-aircraft gun, became available. So Volta was modified between August and November 1941 with two single 25mm guns where the Hotchkiss machine guns had been mounted. Their platform was widened and one additional Browning machine gun was added {{on each side of}} the platform. The Hotchkiss guns were moved to the upper deck on either side of the after deck house. A <b>degaussing</b> cable was added during this same refit. Later in the year the SS 6 sonar was scheduled to be replaced by a French copy of the British ASDIC, but it was still sitting on the dockside when Volta was scuttled in Toulon Harbour when the Germans tried to seize the fleet on 27 November 1942 to prevent it from defecting to the Allies. She was raised on 20 May 1943 by the Italians, but no effort was made to repair her. Volta was bombed and sunk on 24 November 1943 and later refloated and scrapped in 1948.|$|E
5|$|Mutsus {{anti-aircraft}} armament was upgraded during 1932. Upon completion, she {{was assigned}} to Battleship Division 1 of the 1st Fleet, and again served as the Emperor's flagship during the annual maneuvers and fleet review in 1933. The ship was placed in reserve on 15 November and began her lengthy reconstruction. This was completed on 30 September 1936 and Mutsu rejoined the 1st Battleship Division on 1 December 1936. In August 1937, she transported 2,000 men of the 11th Infantry Division to Shanghai during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Her seaplanes bombed targets in Shanghai on 24 August before she returned to Sasebo the following day. On 15 November 1938, Captain Aritomo Gotō assumed command of the ship. Mutsu was placed in reserve from 15 December 1938 to 15 November 1939. She was refitted in early 1941 in preparation for war; {{as part of this}} work, she was fitted with external <b>degaussing</b> coils and additional armour for her barbettes.|$|E
5|$|The French Navy {{decided to}} {{reinforce}} her anti-aircraft armament {{in light of}} its wartime experience. Her no. 3 gun turret was to be moved to the No. 4 position, its magazine converted for extra fuel storage, and a new twin 37mm Mle 1933 mount would replace {{it on top of}} the rear deck house. Two more Mle 1933 mounts were to fitted {{on each side of the}} rear deckhouse and a fourth mount was to replace the 13.2Hotchkiss machine guns forward of the bridge. One 13.2mm Browning machine gun was to planned to be mounted on each side of the forward twin 37mm guns. This plan was later amended to add a <b>degaussing</b> cable, replacement of the SS-6 sonar by a French copy of the British ASDIC and six of the new mitrailleuse de 25 mm contre-aéroplanes Modèle 1940 anti-aircraft guns, plus two more 13.2mm Brownings mounted on the forward corners of the center deck house.|$|E
50|$|As minehunters {{will often}} be {{operating}} {{in close proximity}} to mines, they are designed so as to reduce their own acoustic and magnetic signatures, two common forms of trigger for mines. For example, they are often soundproofed by mounting machinery on shock absorbers or by using quiet electrical drive and usually have a wood, fiberglass or non-ferrous metal hull, or are <b>degaussed</b> to reduce magnetic signature.|$|R
5000|$|In one of {{the more}} unusual war time stories, NSLP was called upon to <b>degauss</b> 50 American destroyers being {{conveyed}} in Halifax to the Royal Navy. In the two hours between the time the Americans vacated the first ships and the time British officers took possession, the vessels were entirely under the command of NSLP: “the only time, in all history, that electric utility ever had a fleet of warships completely under its control.” ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The LatinSat-A and –B {{spacecraft}} {{were launched}} into low Earth orbit in December of 2002. Built by SpaceQuest, these 11 kg microsatellites carry commercial UHF payloads. Their attitude control systems employ a novel magnetic actuator {{that can provide}} large torques while using very little power. At {{the core of the}} device is a rod of Alnico alloy, capable of storing a 13 Am 2 magnetic dipole. Copper windings around this rod connect to a high-voltage pulse generator. High power pulses can <b>degauss</b> or permanently reverse the polarity of the magnet. A hall-effect sensor provides magnetic field telemetry to the flight computer, and allows for closed-loop control. Once the polarity of the rod is set, no additional power is required to maintain it. Previous SpaceQuest microsatellites have used permanent magnets in their ACS to align them with the Earth’s field. These spacecraft complete two pitch rotations per orbit, so that the side that faces the Earth over the northern hemisphere faces space over the southern hemisphere. The LatinSats can <b>degauss</b> and then reverse their magnets each time they pass over the magnetic equator. This should allow a single side to face the Earth at all times...|$|R
5|$|The {{ship was}} {{transferred}} to the Ministry of War Transport, which renamed her Empire Simba and assigned Andrew Weir & Co. of London to manage her. After spending six weeks at Methil, where she had an advanced ship <b>degaussing</b> system installed among other repairs, Empire Simba proceeded to Oban via Lyness in mid November. She set out for North America in Convoy OB-253 on 2 December. Four days out, heavy weather dispersed the convoy, and Empire Simba proceeded independently. The ship continued to take a beating from heavy seas which opened the number one cargo hold to the ocean. Because the water was coming in faster than the bilge pumps in the hold number one could pump, the crew cut through the bulkheads into cargo hold number two to double the pumping capacity and were able to keep the ship under control long enough to arrive in Bermuda on 26 December. After temporary repairs were made there, Empire Simba sailed on 6 January 1942 first to Halifax and then to Baltimore for more permanent repairs.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{cessation}} of hostilities, YDG-11 saw little or no active service before being berthed with the Pacific Reserve Fleet at San Diego, California. She was retained on an inactive, in service, status until the winter of 1946 and 1947, when she was placed out of service, in reserve. On 1 November 1947 she was re-designated ADG-11. The ship remained inactive until July 1951, when she was again placed in service. Assigned to the Far East, ADG-11 was based at Yokosuka, Japan until sometime in 1954. After that, her home port was Sasebo, Japan. On 1 February 1955, she was renamed Ampere. The ship was placed out of service in February 1957. Her equipment was transferred to USS Surfbird, a minesweeping vessel which was redesignated a <b>degaussing</b> ship on 15 June 1957. She remained in reserve in the Far East until the summer of 1961, when {{the decision was made}} to dispose of her. Her name was struck from the Naval Register on 1 July 1961, and she was sold on 21 June 1962, to the Philippine President Lines of Manila. Her final disposition is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the attack}} on convoy SLS 64, Admiral Hippers fuel stocks were running low. She {{therefore}} returned to Brest on 15 February. British bombers were regularly attacking the port, however, and the Kriegsmarine therefore decided Admiral Hipper should return to Germany, where she could be better protected. Before the ship could leave, damage caused to the ship's hull by wrecks in the harbor had to be repaired. On 15 March, the ship slipped out of Brest, unobserved, and passed through the Denmark Strait eight days later. While en route, Admiral Hipper stopped to refuel in Bergen. By 28 March, the cruiser was docked in Kiel, having made the entire journey without being detected by the British. Upon arrival, the ship went into the Deutsche Werke shipyard for an extensive overhaul, which lasted for seven months. After completion of the refit, Admiral Hipper conducted sea trials in the Baltic before putting into Gotenhafen on 21 December for some minor refitting. In January 1942, the ship had her steam turbines overhauled at the Blohm & Voss shipyard; a <b>degaussing</b> coil was fitted to the ship's hull during this overhaul. By March, the ship was again fully operational.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the first}} means for {{detecting}} submerged submarines, first installed by the Royal Navy in 1914, was the effect of their passage over an anti-submarine indicator loop {{on the bottom of}} a body of water. A metal object passing over it, such as a submarine, will, even if <b>degaussed,</b> have enough magnetic properties to induce a current in the loop's cable[...] In this case, the motion of the metal submarine across the indicating coil acts as an oscillator, producing electric current.|$|R
5000|$|After the war, the {{capabilities}} of the magnetic fuses were greatly improved, by detecting not the field itself, but changes in it. This meant a <b>degaussed</b> ship with a magnetic [...] "hot spot" [...] would still set off the mine. Additionally, the precise orientation of the field was also measured, something a simple bias field could not remove, at least for all points on the ship. A series of ever-increasingly complex coils were introduced to offset these effects, with modern systems including no fewer than three separate sets of coils to reduce the field in all axes.|$|R
50|$|By {{the year}} 2176, a {{magnetic}} storm has <b>degaussed</b> all recorded history, causing such valuable documents as the U.S. Constitution and the Declaration of Independence to be lost. Three time travelers, Adam-11 (David Cassidy), Chanel-6 (Olivia d'Abo), and Heinz-57 (Geoff Hoyle) are {{sent back to}} July 4, 1776, to retrieve America's heritage, but due to an unnoticed time machine malfunction, end up in 1976 instead, during the United States Bicentennial. While pursuing their mission, the time travelers dress in period costume (e.g., tight bell bottom pants), and experience est, the Sexual Revolution, Pop Rocks, disco, long gas lines, the AMC Pacer and even drug paraphernalia shops.|$|R
5|$|From 15 to 20 November, Sydney {{and three}} other cruisers transported 4,000 Allied {{soldiers}} and their equipment from Alexandria to the Piraeus as reinforcements for the Greek military. On returning to Alexandria, Sydney deployed {{with the majority of}} the Mediterranean fleet to cover multiple convoys across the sea: the Australian cruiser spent the remainder of the month operating throughout the eastern and central Mediterranean, and was bombed by Italian aircraft on 24 November at Souda Bay, but escaped damage. Sydney started December in the Aegean, where she escorted convoys and shelled the port of Valona, then proceeded to Malta for a refit and repairs to her rudder, which lasted {{until the end of the}} year. During this refit, the cruiser was fitted with <b>degaussing</b> equipment. The ship rejoined the fleet on 8 January 1941, when she was instructed to head home after proceeding along the north coast of Africa and linking up with any Australia-bound merchant ships she encountered. The recall was attributed to the need to bring Sydney in for a major refit and give her personnel leave, a plan to spread combat experience throughout the RAN by trading the cruiser with her sister ship, , and a need to protect Australia against the German merchant raiders operating in the area, particularly following the attacks on Nauru.|$|E
25|$|The <b>degaussing</b> circuit {{is often}} built of a thermo-electric (not electronic) device {{containing}} a small ceramic heating element {{and a positive}} thermal coefficient (PTC) resistor, connected directly to the switched AC power line with the resistor in series with the <b>degaussing</b> coil. When the power is switched on, the heating element heats the PTC resistor, increasing its resistance {{to a point where}} <b>degaussing</b> current is minimal, but not actually zero. In older CRT displays, this low-level current (which produces no significant <b>degaussing</b> field) is sustained along with the action of the heating element as long as the display remains switched on. To repeat a <b>degaussing</b> cycle, the CRT display must be switched off and left off for at least several seconds to reset the <b>degaussing</b> circuit by allowing the PTC resistor to cool to the ambient temperature; switching the display-off and immediately back on will result in a weak <b>degaussing</b> cycle or effectively no <b>degaussing</b> cycle.|$|E
25|$|This simple {{design is}} {{effective}} and cheap to build, but it wastes some power continuously. Later models, especially Energy Star rated ones, use a relay to switch the entire <b>degaussing</b> circuit on and off, {{so that the}} <b>degaussing</b> circuit uses energy only when it is functionally active and needed. The relay design also enables <b>degaussing</b> on user demand through the unit's front panel controls, without switching the unit off and on again. This relay can often be heard clicking off {{at the end of}} the <b>degaussing</b> cycle a few seconds after the monitor is turned on, and on and off during a manually initiated <b>degaussing</b> cycle.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{cassettes}} {{themselves were}} relatively durable, the players required regular maintenance to perform properly. Head cleaning may {{be done with}} long swabs, soaked with isopropyl alcohol, or cassette-shaped devices that could be inserted into a tape deck to remove buildup of iron-oxide from the heads, tape-drive capstan, and pinch-roller. Some otherwise normal recording tapes included sections of leader that could clean the tape heads. One of {{the concerns of the}} time however was the use of abrasive cleaning tape. Some of the cleaning tapes actually felt rough to the touch and were considered damaging to the heads. Similarly shaped demagnetizers used magnets to <b>degauss</b> the deck, which kept sound from becoming distorted (see Cassette demagnetizer).|$|R
5000|$|Indicator loops {{were used}} to detect the {{presence}} of any submerged submarines. An indicator loop relies on the production of an induced current in a stationary loop of wire when a magnet moves overhead. Even if wiped or <b>degaussed,</b> submarines still have sufficient magnetism to produce a small current in a loop. The technology {{was developed by the}} British Royal Navy at HMS Osprey (Portland Naval Base) from 1915. If an indicator loop showed the presence of a vessel the two possibilities were [...] "sub" [...] or [...] "non-sub". If no ship could be observed on the water, it was obviously a submarine, and a vessel could be despatched to drop depth charges.|$|R
5000|$|Her {{overhaul}} {{lasted until}} 1 May. Upon completion of her refit, Albemarle got underway for Newport, on 5 May, and there, {{over the next}} few days, <b>degaussed,</b> calibrated her direction finders, and loaded aircraft for transportation to Bermuda. Underway on 15 May with [...] and [...] as escorts, the seaplane tender reached her destination on the 17th, unloaded the planes she had brought, and immediately set sail for Narragansett Bay. Relieving [...] in connection with aircraft torpedo and submarine familiarization training, on the 19th, Albemarle remained anchored in Narragansett Bay until 12 August, providing torpedo services for a succession of squadrons: VP-94, VP-34, VP-33 and Torpedo Squadron 4. Underway on 12 August and escorted by the destroyers , [...] and , the submarine tender sailed for Norfolk. After her arrival there, Albemarle conducted gunnery exercises in the Chesapeake Bay operating area.|$|R
