25|$|Surat al-Falaq {{mentions}} the harms people {{would get in}} their worldly matters, whereas Surat an-Nās {{mentions the}} harms people would get in their religious matter. So asking God's protection <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> emphasised in this an-Nās – {{with a lot more}} of God's names, in comparison to Surat al-Falaq when Rabb is mentioned only once. This shows that concerning religious matters is more important than worldly matters for mankind.|$|E

25|$|A {{reason that}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> {{plausible}} {{is the lack}} of solidarity from the city's Greek Christian population. Rabbi Molho spoke {{of only a handful of}} Greek Christians who saved Jews in Thessaloniki. It is reported than just 10 Jewish families found shelter in the city. This attitude of the local population, which included the Church, the city authorities and the professional associations, has been noted by several historians in the recent years. The resistance was also not very well developed at the time, and few Jews could realistically make the journey to the mountains.|$|E

25|$|Although Warner had {{intended}} to give the film a 5.1 stereo remastering, {{they were unable to}} do so due to several factors. The main factor was the fact that Ball's vocals in her songs often had to be pieced together line by line {{in order to get a}} more pitch-perfect performance (this method <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> obvious on the soundtrack CD, where you can often hear a difference in fidelity in each individual line as well as the occasional line that sounds like two Lucys singing.) This and the varying conditions of the original master copies caused Warner Bros. to simply restore the original release's mono soundtrack and remaster it in Dolby Digital 1.0 mono and use it for the DVD's audio track.|$|E
25|$|The {{platform}} of social media is another channel or site that business' and brands must seek {{to influence the}} content of. In contrast with pre-Internet marketing, such as TV ads and newspaper ads, in which the marketer controlled {{all aspects of the}} ad, with social media, users are free to post comments right below an online ad or an online post by a company about its product. Companies are increasing using their social media strategy as part of their traditional marketing effort using magazines, newspapers, radio advertisements, television advertisements. Since in the 2010s, media consumers are often using multiple platforms at the same time (e.g., surfing the Internet on a tablet while watching a streaming TV show), marketing content needs to be consistent across all platforms, whether traditional or new media. Heath (2006) wrote about the extent of attention businesses should give to their social media sites. It is about finding a balance between frequently posting but not over posting. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> attention to be paid towards social media sites because people need updates to gain brand recognition. Therefore, a lot more content is need and this can often be unplanned content.|$|E

500|$|There {{are many}} {{geological}} features in Penmon, including fossils of brachiopods, a tunnel under a cliff and the cliff itself. [...] The cliff {{is made up}} of limestone and shale, in alternating layers. It has been moved many times due to faults fracturing and moving the beds of rock, and there are distinct lines where the beds have been moved. The cliff is approximately eight metres high; however, the distribution of limestone and shale is different near {{the top and bottom of}} the cliff. There is a gradual change of shale to limestone; near the bottom there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> shale per metre of rock and nearer the top there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> limestone. The cliff has been struck by several faults, causing it to look unstable; rocks fall from it from time to time. Penmon is close to the sea, thus making it prone to erosion. Quite a lot of the cliff has been eroded away, thus causing an arch to form under the cliff. The shale has eroded away faster than the limestone beds, and as such, has caused thinner beds of limestone between to collapse. This is the reason the arch is only a few metres high and does not extend further, where there are less shale beds. Faults passing through the cliff have displaced the beds, one such fault almost 23cm, causing a ledge halfway through the tunnel.|$|E

500|$|The {{game was}} {{initially}} set {{to follow the}} stories of 8–10 playable characters, beginning with an American-Iranian State Department translator trying to free American hostages.

Khonsari's goal was to allow players to [...] "see the world <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> gray than black and white", achieving this by having a protagonist who experienced the Revolution. The game's characters {{are based on the}} interviews conducted with Iranians who experienced the Revolution. Executive producer Vassiliki Khonsari said the characters [...] "do not fall into the typical good guy/bad guy, but everyone is a shade of gray ... to show the complexity of history". The team featured a variety of characters from different families, beliefs and social classes.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Ray of Light" [...] was {{directed}} by Jonas Åkerlund, who had previously shot the controversial clip for the song [...] "Smack My Bitch Up" [...] (1997) by The Prodigy. Madonna had been planning the video for [...] "Ray of Light" [...] {{from the time she}} was filming the clip for previous single [...] "Frozen" [...] in the Mojave Desert.

500|$|The austere {{settings}} {{in the game}} came about because testers {{spent too much time}} trying to complete the puzzles using decorative but non-functional elements. As a result, the setting was minimized to make the usable aspects of the puzzle easier to spot, using the clinical feel of the setting in the film The Island as reference. While there were plans for a third area, an office space, to be included after the test chambers and the maintenance areas, the team ran out of time to include it. They also dropped the introduction of the Rat Man, a character who left the messages in the maintenance areas, to avoid creating too much narrative for the game, though the character was developed further in a tie-in comic [...] "Lab Rat", that ties Portal and Portal 2s story together. According to project lead Kim Swift, the final battle with GLaDOS went through many iterations, including having the player chased by James Bond lasers, which was partially applied to the turrets, Portal Kombat where the player would have needed to redirect rockets while avoiding turret fire, and a chase sequence following a fleeing GLaDOS. Eventually, they found that playtesters enjoyed a rather simple puzzle with a countdown timer near the end; Swift noted, [...] "Time pressure makes people think something <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> complicated than it really is", and Wolpaw admitted, [...] "It was really cheap to make [...] " [...] in order to simplify the dialogue during the battle.|$|E
500|$|Another story arc saw Charlie {{reveal that}} her sister Ruby Buckton (Rebecca Breeds) {{is in fact}} her daughter. Charlie gave birth to Ruby after she was raped by Grant Bledcoe (Clayton Watson), when she was younger. Both Anderson and Breeds found the storyline {{challenging}} and felt {{they had to get}} it right. Breeds said it made her nervous but was pleased with the end result. She said she had to let it affect her own emotions to effect the viewing public. [...] "The revelation ruins their relationship, and Anderson said that Charlie was [...] "trying desperately to bridge this gap". Breeds added [...] "Ruby just wants to get some security back, everything she thought her life was is totally up in the air". Ruby becomes confused and starts to ask herself questions such as [...] "Where do I stand now?" [...] and [...] "How do I reconcile this?" [...] Breeds said it was a [...] "big exploration" [...] and a journey for Ruby, with Anderson agreeing. Anderson felt there was a beautiful element to the storyline and opined: [...] "Although it is tragic, you feel sorry for Charlie and you can sort of understand where it has all come from." [...] She added that everyone feels sorry for Ruby, meaning neither are wrong. Furthermore, she said, [...] "You are just rooting for them, you just want them to get back to how they were and it {{is a bit of a}} journey." [...] Comparing the storyline to the lesbian plot she said, [...] "Perhaps this storyline was a little bit harder, you've seen the start of this storyline and there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> to come and it wasn't easy." ...|$|E
