500|$|On February 1, 2008, Bako {{signed a}} minor league {{contract}} with an invitation to spring training with the Cincinnati Reds. At the end of spring training, he {{was added to the}} 40-man roster. Though he batted only [...]217, Bako appeared in a career-high 99 games in 2008, hitting six home runs and notching 35 RBIs. On January 30, 2009, the Chicago Cubs signed Bako to a one-year contract. However, he was unconditionally released near the end of spring training. On May 18, Bako signed {{a minor league}} deal with the Philadelphia Phillies, and was called up from the Reading Phillies to the Major League roster on June 9. He became the Phillies only backup catcher when the Phillies waived [...] "folk hero" [...] Chris Coste on July 10; Coste had broken into the big leagues {{for the first time with}} Philadelphia at age 33. The next day, Bako came to the plate in the bottom of the ninth inning against Pittsburgh Pirates closer Matt Capps with the score tied, 7–7; the Phillies had been behind by four runs before home runs by Matt Stairs and Ryan Howard tied the game. With the bases loaded, Bako hit a single through the left side of the infield, driving in the winning run (Raúl Ibañez) and sealing the Phillies fourth consecutive victory in a season-high ten-game winning streak. After the acquisition of starting pitcher Cliff Lee, Bako caught all of his first five starts with the Phillies, when Lee posted a 5–0 record and an 0.68 earned run average. Bako said, [...] "With as many strikes as he throws and as many weapons as he has, it's a lot of fun to catch him." [...] Manager Charlie Manuel, however, denied that Bako was scheduled to be Lee's personal catcher, as he had done for Maddux in 2001. [...] "'s [...] not his personal catcher... Of course you guys will write whatever you want to write. If you want him to be his personal catcher, <b>go</b> <b>right</b> <b>ahead.</b> But I'll handle it anyway, so it doesn't matter." ...|$|E
2500|$|Blagojevich {{had been}} under {{investigation}} for corrupt activity for 4 years, {{as part of a}} broader federal investigation by Fitzgerald, code-named Operation Board Games, that had been going on for three years. [...] To date, 15 people have been charged in connection with the investigation. Blagojevich had long been suspected to be a target of the investigation, but it was confirmed by U.S. District Judge Amy St. Eve that he was the [...] "Public Official A" [...] referred to in the federal indictment of Tony Rezko. Just before the 2008 United States general elections on November 4, 2008, Federal investigators were granted authority to tape Blagojevich's conversations. On December 8, 2008, in a press conference, Blagojevich claimed [...] "whether you tape me privately or publicly, I can tell you that whatever I say is always lawful and the things I'm interested in are always lawful." [...] He further stated that [...] "if anybody wants to tape my conversations, <b>go</b> <b>right</b> <b>ahead,</b> feel free to do it. I appreciate anybody who wants to tape me openly and notoriously; and those who feel like they want to sneakily, and wear taping devices, I would remind them that it kind of smells like Nixon and Watergate." [...] After a meeting between Blagojevich and [...] Jesse Jackson Jr. regarding the Senate seat, when asked his thoughts on being the subject of federal tapings, Blagojevich stated, [...] "I don't believe there's any cloud that hangs over me. I think there's nothing but sunshine hanging over me." ...|$|E

60|$|My {{first thought}} was, why didn't {{he have the}} coffin opened?

60|$|That {{was just}} it. The machine <b>went</b> <b>right</b> <b>ahead,</b> spaced the line, {{justified}} it to a hair, and shoved {{it into the}} galley complete and perfect! We took it out and examined it with a glass. You could not tell by your eye that the third space was thinner than the others, but the glass and the calipers showed the difference. Paige had always said that the machine would measure invisible particles of dirt and allow for them, but even he had forgotten that vast fact for the moment.|$|R

6000|$|... "I'll {{get it for}} you. You <b>go</b> <b>right</b> <b>ahead</b> {{and give}} it to him, Mr. Barrow. He's the new boarder--Mr. Tracy--and I'd just got to where it was getting too deep for me." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You're right," [...] he said. [...] "One {{may never}} get so far out again. Our {{fortunes}} will keep, I suppose, and anyhow we ought to strike a telegraph station in about a fortnight. We'll <b>go</b> <b>right</b> <b>ahead,</b> then." ...|$|E
60|$|Then for {{the next}} two hundred years the family tree shows a {{succession}} of soldiers--noble, high-spirited fellows, who always went into battle singing, right behind the army, and always <b>went</b> out a-whooping, <b>right</b> <b>ahead</b> of it.|$|R
60|$|Now {{of course}} Peter didn't {{know what kind}} of a prison Chatterer was in. He remembered right away how Prickly Porky the Porcupine had gnawed a great hole in the box in which Johnny Chuck's lost baby was kept by Farmer Brown's boy. Why shouldn't Prickly Porky do as much for Chatterer? He would go see him at once. The trouble with Peter is that he doesn't think of all sides of a question. He is impulsive. That is, he <b>goes</b> <b>right</b> <b>ahead</b> and does the thing that comes into his head first, and {{sometimes}} this isn't the wisest or best thing to do. So now he scampered down into the Green Forest as fast as his long legs would carry him, to hunt for Prickly Porky. It was no trouble at all to find him, for he had only to follow the line of trees that had been stripped of their bark.|$|R

You'll find, in his inmost heart, he'll be tickled to death.|$|E
60|$|THE SHERIFF. That is {{no doubt}} true, old man. Still, you must get as unprejudiced as you can. The critter {{has a right to}} his chance, such as he is.

2500|$|John F. Montgomery, {{who served}} in Budapest as U.S. {{ambassador}} from 1933 to 1941, openly admired this side of Horthy's character and reported the following incident in his memoir: in March 1939, Arrow Cross supporters disrupted a performance at the Budapest opera house by chanting [...] "Justice for Szálasi!" [...] loud enough for the regent to hear. A fight broke out, and when Montgomery went {{to take a closer}} look, he discovered that:two or three men were on the floor and he [...] had another by the throat, slapping his face and shouting what I learned afterward was: [...] "So you would betray your country, would you?" [...] The Regent was alone, but he had the situation in hand.... The whole incident was typical not only of the Regent's deep hatred of alien doctrine, but of the kind of man he is. Although he was around seventy two years of age, it did not occur to him to ask for help; he <b>went</b> <b>right</b> <b>ahead</b> like a skipper with a mutiny on his hands.|$|R
5000|$|In mid February 2011, a snippet of {{the final}} studio version of [...] "Finish Line" [...] was {{released}} onto the internet after Yasmin performed the song live at various gigs. The official radio edit for the song was then uploaded on 14 March 2011. On 20 April, [...] "Finish Line" [...] was A-listed on BBC Radio 1. Remixes of [...] "Finish Line" [...] by Freemasons, Mike Delinquent and Shy FX were also released. In an interview with SoulCulture, Yasmin explained how the Freemasons Remix came {{about as well as}} her opinion of the remix:I suggested the Freemasons when discussing remix ideas with the label and luckily for me the guys loved the song and <b>went</b> <b>right</b> <b>ahead</b> making an incredible floorfiller-esque remix, ..., the guys told me they were so inspired by the track they wanted to do an alternative afterhours chilled out version which I was more than happy for them to do considering the calibre of the uptempo mix. When I finally heard this Afterhours Mix, I was blown away, it's even more magical than I expected. This remix has {{some of the most beautiful}} and evoking production I've heard in a long time, reminds me so much of Massive Attack and Portishead, they just really nailed it.|$|R
5000|$|... "Before filming began, Lon {{talked to}} me about make-up and {{explained}} the action scenes to me. Finally, he gave me one last bit of advice: ‘Never act purely on impulse in important matters,’ he said. ‘Think things over carefully.

5000|$|Determined {{to win the}} argument, Bailey {{obtained}} {{permission to}} personally defend his decision to General John J. Pershing, commander of the American Expeditionary Force (A.E.F.).

500|$|Director Radha Mohan {{expressed}} a desire to remake the film but decided against it: [...] "If there is one film I want to remake, [...] will be the one, but I know I will not, because I believe classics should be left alone." [...] Director and choreographer Prabhu Deva ranked Server Sundaram among his favourite films. A restaurant named [...] "Hotel Server Sundaram" [...] is located in the Thuraipakkam area of Chennai. In December 2014, G. Babu Jayakumar of The New Indian Express included the film in his list of Balachander's noted films. Clips from Server Sundaram were screened along with clips from other films such as Iru Kodugal (1969), Arangetram (1973), Aval Oru Thodar Kathai (1974), Avargal (1977) and Azhagan (1991) at a function held in Balachander's honour at Tiruchirappalli in January 2015, a month after his death. Server Sundaram is also used as the title of an 2017 film starring Santhanam and Nagesh's grandson Bijesh, with its producer Selva having bought the title rights from AVM Productions. On why that title was chosen, Selva said, [...] "Santhanam plays a chef in the film and we felt that Server Sundaram, in which Nagesh played the role of a server, would be apt for this film, too.

60|$|The solicitous note in {{her voice}} made Reggie quiver like a jelly. He had never known her speak like that before.
