40|$|ABSTRACT. Unlike Andrew Kyngdon, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> he has {{addressed}} is most informatively considered outside {{the confines of}} the representational theory of measurement. Then it becomes clear that while the theory of con-joint measurement is about situations like that treated by the Rasch model, the former isolates a different feature of those situations to the latter. But, if the relevant attributes are already presumed to be quantitative, the perceived differences are minimized and the Rasch model might seem to be a version of conjoint measurement. It is on this basis that Rasch modellers pursue their paradoxical quest for measurement. However, because the relevant attributes are not actually known to be quantitative, use of the Rasch model to measure psychological attributes remains logically dependent upon the outcome of research involving the theory of conjoint measurement or some-thing very similar. KEY WORDS: conjoint measurement, psychometrics, Rasch model, represen-tational theory The socio-economic conditions sustaining modern psychometrics discourage critical attitudes and it now stands suspended in a post-critical bubble. As a science, it desperately needs deflating. So it would be churlish to let my dis-agreement with the detail of Andrew Kyngdon’s (2008) argument prevent me applauding his critical spirit by offering further critical thoughts supplement-ing his on the relationship between the Rasch model and conjoint measure-ment. The former is, as he says, sometimes promoted as the latter. He favours a narrow focus, concentrating upon formal matters within the framework of representational theory. But a wider lens may be helpful, for the Rasch model does not easily fit the representational schema, as Kyngdon found, and the theory of conjoint measurement transcends its narrow frame...|$|E

Recently the concept of the Web of Linked Data has emerged as a means to expose, share and connect information on the Web identified by URIs using RDF 1 as a data model. Examples include the data. gov. uk initiative which aims to expose UK public data, and bio 2 rdf. org which provides an atlas of post-genomic data. However, the Web of Linked data still suffers from many of the same problems as the Web of documents in terms of information quality, trust, attribution, privacy, etc. An illustration of this is reflected in the following quote from the chairman of the UK Audit Commission Michael O'Higgins on the day that government spending data was released: "And that's where <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> critical <b>issue</b> is- that what is being released is not in fact information, it is data.

It would be a place where the appropriate knowledge, the experience, and the intellectual energy could be focused on this single goal. It would have the status of other national colleges. It would also be a virtual college or a university, and it would be collaborative with colleges and universities and other learning institutions all across the country and perhaps the world. Experts on space from almost any corridor could participate and contribute to what this institute would do. It also would have very strong business participation. We would have folks from industry come to this environment, learn, go back and work, and then come back and teach. It would be a means for individuals to become more proficient in the technical engineering operations, as well as the business and political aspects of space exploration.

40|$|URL] In The Emotional Construction of Morals (2007), Jesse Prinz {{offers a}} {{coherent}} naturalist approach on {{the foundations of}} human moral normativity. He classifies his view as a sensibility theory, a realist approach conspicuously opposed to the anti-realist bent of traditional emotivism. I sympathize with Prinz’s general approach; nevertheless, I have some specific disagreements. The first concerns the “is-ought” problem. <b>I</b> don’t <b>think</b> {{it is possible to}} build a realist, and a naturalist, approach in ethics without answering the famous problem with a positive stance. That is, without showing that it is actually possible to make the suspect transition—at least if we take “normativity” as a natural fact (as Hume, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> actually thought). Here I will evaluate what <b>I</b> <b>think</b> are <b>the</b> main <b>issues</b> of Prinz’s approach. One issue that deserves to be commented on is the contrast between Prinz’s view and John Searle's well-known approach regarding the is-ought problem. Prinz thinks that Searle’s argument favouring the passage from an "is" to an "ought" is not cogent, but the correct understanding of Searle's argument requires assuming “obligations” (and duties) as factual. Therefore, what a naturalist theory must explain is how it is possible to pass from the fact that one is under a particular obligation to the supposed required action (or, in more fashionable words, how duties can be “agent-relative reasons for action”). In effect, I will present my approach on the concept of “reason for action,” influenced by Judith Jarvis Thomson’s approach, and her distinction between “duties” and “oughts. ” In the final section I will make some comments on the problem of relativism. I agree with Prinz that descriptive relativism is true; but Prinz is committed to a form of agent-relativism. I will present arguments against agent-relativism that depend on the acceptance of a clear distinction between “duty” and “ought. ”</p...|$|R

40|$|It?s {{not fair}} trade! Cue: Huge markets and wealthy {{consumers}} in the United States or Europe, all looking to buy the nutritious, healthy foods that developing countries can grow: farmers in Africa have often heard about the benefits that globalisation can bring. But for the majority, and particularly for smallholder farmers, the liberalisation of world trade {{has done little to}} improve their livelihoods. Global markets are simply unreachable for a whole range of reasons, from lack of information and communications facilities, to export tariffs and farming subsidies paid to developed world farmers. In our next report, Sylvia Jiyane finds out how in Zimbabwe, farmers are finding ways to target the world food markets. She talks to Langton Mkweresa, an economist in Zimbabwe?s Ministry of Agriculture, who begins by explaining some of the reasons why the open, global market is far from being a fair place for developing world farmers to sell their produce. IN:		?As far as our farmers ? OUT:		?to help the smallholder farmer. ? DUR?N	 3 ? 29 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Langton Mkweresa suggesting how smallholder farmers might be able to exploit world markets. Transcript Mkweresa	As far as our farmers are concerned, they cannot fully exploit the benefits of the world markets in that, the information that we have got is fairly limited, and even the channels of information sharing and whatever, they are not as much as those enjoyed by developed countries? farmers. Like the Internet, and whatever; we have got very limited telephone facilities for example, so we cannot fully exploit the markets in developed countries. We also have <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of subsidies, which is quite a contentious issue. We are looking at quite some significant subsidies which farmers in developed countries enjoy. So those subsidies are resulting in over-production by developed country agriculture, and that has got an effect on world prices, that is also now depressing world prices and reducing the incentives for developing country farmers to produce. The other aspects that is also impacting negatively on these smallholder farmers in developing countries, is <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of tariffs. Over 100 % for our sugar exports to the US; again over 100 % for grain exports into Europe. That has got an effect of impeding trade, yet we know that most benefits to smallholder agriculture, to agriculture in general really, are got through trade more than anything else. Jiyane	Could there be any positive effects? Mkweresa	One thing is there are quite some out-grower schemes, which are quite catching up. By growing some crops for the European market, say, as out-growers, and then selling your produce through some established pack-houses; we are seeing quite a lot of success in that regard. We are also seeing quite some strong efforts by our government and also by some international development partners, the NGOs, to try to also increase the outreach programmes to the smallholder farmers. We are looking at things like provision of inputs and much more extension services and things like that. That is also helping the smallholder farmers. A lot of diversification is going on where new crops are coming in. So there are certainly some things going on but as <b>I</b> said <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> biggest <b>issue</b> is <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of liberalising <b>the</b> trade regimes world-wide, through the reforms going on at the World Trade Organisation. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that is where we feel most impact would be felt by smallholder farmers. Jiyane	In view of all that, what then is the future of small-scale farming? Mkweresa	The future is certainly bright, but {{it is a question of}} the smallholder farmers working closely with the governments and all the other international development partners, looking at what are the opportunities that are there, largely by way of specialising in those products where we have got some comparative advantage. Particularly we are looking at the weather; when Europe is in winter, when they can?t grow a lot of the crops then that is some window of opportunity which we can exploit. So it is a question of some niche markets and also exploiting some windows of opportunity. And also through these various schemes, like I said, the out-grower schemes, specialisation in some high value crops, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that is where the potential is. We have to specialise in some high value crops. So these are some of the things that <b>I</b> can <b>think</b> of to help the smallholder farmer. End of track. An economist in Zimbabwe?s Ministry of Agriculture summarises the reasons why developing country farmers struggle to sell their produce to foreign markets. He points out some of the progress that is being made in smallholder farming, and suggests the kind of opportunities available to farmers who want to boost their profits...|$|R
