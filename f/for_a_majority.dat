Harper was sworn in as Canada's 22nd prime minister on February 6, 2006.|$|E
5|$|Unfortunately, the Bears’ 2001 {{winning season}} would be {{followed}} by three years of mediocrity. Before the 2004 NFL season, the Bears’ organization fired coach Dick Jauron and then hired Lovie Smith.

5|$|Writing <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> of the Court, Justice Harry Blackmun {{held that}} natural {{parents have a}} right to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment, and that the burden of proof used by New York State is not {{stringent}} enough to satisfy the constitutional requirements of the due process clause. In striking down New York's burden, the Court utilized the Mathews test to determine what burden of proof was due.|$|E
5|$|In week eight, the Triangles {{played against}} the Rock Island Independents. The Independents had six players {{returning}} from injuries this game. In the first quarter, Rube Ursella for the Independents fumbled a punt on the 40-yard line, and the Triangles gained possession. On that possession, Bacon scored a rushing touchdown. The Independents controlled the football <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> {{of the second}} quarter. On their final possession of the half, they traveled to the Triangles' four-inch line, but the referee signaled to end the first half. In the fourth quarter, Ed Novack and Arnold Wyman for the Independents left the game due to injury. The Triangles scored two passing touchdowns in the final 10 minutes of the game; the first was caught by Dave Reese, and the second was caught by Roudebush.|$|E
5|$|Similar to his {{stint at}} Bastia, Diarra was {{included}} in the team as a starter by coach Joël Muller. The season was a major success for Diarra as he was the only player in the team to start every league match he played for the club. He also served as captain <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> of the season. His consistent performances led to his call up to the senior national team. Diarra scored his first goal of the campaign in a 1–1 draw with Ajaccio. He scored the goal in the opening minute of the match. On 6 February 2005, Diarra scored the opener in team's 2–0 win over Paris Saint-Germain at the Parc des Princes. He finished the campaign with 37 total appearances and two goals. Diarra also collected 11 yellow cards.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the opening}} of the {{original}} New York City Subway line in 1904, and throughout the subway's history, various official and planning agencies have proposed numerous extensions to the subway system. The first major expansion of the subway system was the Dual Contracts, a set of agreements between the City of New York and the IRT and the BRT. The system was expanded into the outer reaches of the Bronx, Brooklyn, and Queens, and it provided for the construction of important lines in Manhattan. This one expansion of the system provided <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> of today's system.|$|E
5|$|The Court reargued {{the case}} {{at the behest of}} Associate Justice Felix Frankfurter, who used reargument as a {{stalling}} tactic, to allow the Court to gather a consensus around a Brown opinion that would outlaw segregation. The justices in support of desegregation spent much effort convincing those who initially intended to dissent to join a unanimous opinion. Although the legal effect would be same <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> rather than unanimous decision, it was felt that dissent could be used by segregation supporters as a legitimizing counter-argument.|$|E
5|$|The third case, Puyallup Tribe, Inc. v. Department of Game of Washington (Puyallup III), {{was decided}} in 1977. Members of the Puyallup Tribe filed suit, arguing {{that under the}} {{doctrine}} of sovereign immunity, Washington state courts lacked jurisdiction to regulate fishing activities on tribal reservations. Writing <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> of the Court, Justice John Paul Stevens held that, despite the tribe's sovereign immunity, the state could regulate the harvest of steelhead trout in {{the portion of the}} river that ran through the Puyallup Reservation as long as the state could base its decision and apportionment on conservation grounds.|$|E

5|$|Writing <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> of the Supreme Court, Justice Stephen Breyer {{stated that}} the department's belief was all that mattered, since the Court's {{precedent}} in this area holds it is unconstitutional for a government agency to discipline an employee (who does not work under a contract that explicitly permits such discipline) for engaging in partisan political activity, {{as long as that}} activity is not disruptive to the agency's operations. Even if Heffernan was not engaging in protected speech, he wrote, the discipline against him sent a message to others to avoid exercising their rights. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a dissenting opinion in which he was joined by Justice Samuel Alito, in which he agreed that Heffernan had been harmed, but his constitutional rights had not been violated.|$|E
5|$|Along the Odishan coast, the cyclone {{generated}} a 5–6m (16–20ft) storm surge that brought {{water up to}} 35km (20mi) inland, inundating a large swath of coastal areas. The Indian Ministry of Urban Development estimated a peak storm surge height of 6.7m (22ft). One visually estimated storm surge of 9m (30ft) was reported; however, this estimate was determined to have been too high. Regardless, no in-situ measurement of the peak storm surge exists as all potential instruments were destroyed by the storm. Storm surge was responsible <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> of the fatalities linked to the 1999Odisha cyclone, accounting for around 7,000deaths. The intense wave action sank 9,085fishing boats and caused the loss of 22,143fishing nets. Some fishing trawlers were carried and deposited 1.5–2.0km (0.9–1.2mi) inland. A 4km (2.5mi) stretch of road leading out of Paradip was covered by sand dunes measuring 1m (3.3ft) in height and 0.5km (0.3mi) in width. Paradip Port sustained severe damage to several components including various warehouses and its power transmission system, though its core infrastructure remained intact. Damage at the port was estimated at around ₹300million (US$6.9million). The storm surge destroyed nearly every house in Paradip near the point of landfall. In Gopalpur, 27villages were submerged by the surge. To the south in southern Andhra Pradesh, 48trawlers sank.|$|E
5|$|Estimates put {{the average}} energy {{density of the}} Universe at the {{equivalent}} of 5.9 protons per cubic meter, including dark energy, dark matter, and baryonic matter (ordinary matter composed of atoms). The atoms account for only 4.6% of the total energy density, or a density of one proton per four cubic meters. The density of the Universe, however, is clearly not uniform; it ranges from relatively high density in galaxies—including very high density in structures within galaxies, such as planets, stars, and black holes—to conditions in vast voids that have much lower density, {{at least in terms}} of visible matter. Unlike the matter and dark matter, the dark energy seems not to be concentrated in galaxies: although dark energy may account <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> of the mass-energy in the Universe, dark energy's influence is 5 orders of magnitude smaller than the influence of gravity from matter and dark matter within the Milky Way.|$|E

At that time the Conservatives stood at 290 seats, Labour at 247 and Liberal Democrats at 51. The final results put the Conservatives on 306 seats, Labour on 258, and the Liberal Democrats on 57.|$|R
