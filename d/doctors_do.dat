Cradle cap is also not contagious. <b>Doctors</b> <b>do</b> not agree on what causes cradle cap, but the two most common hypotheses are fungal infection and overactive sebaceous glands. Cradle cap is an inflammatory condition.|$|E

25|$|A mafioso's {{legitimate}} occupation, if any, generally {{does not}} affect his prestige within Cosa Nostra.

25|$|Silvio and Patsy rush {{to pack up}} {{important}} {{items from}} the Bing. They are intercepted by two Lupertazzi hit men, Ray-Ray and Petey B, and fired upon. Silvio is hit multiple times while Patsy abandons the car and flees while returning fire. Silvio is left in a medically-induced coma, from which <b>doctors</b> <b>do</b> not think he will awaken. Tony arrives back home and, hearing about the hits, orders his family to go into hiding. Carmela and Meadow visit the Baccalieris, who are all in shock over Bobby's death. At nightfall, Tony, Paulie, Carlo, and Dante Greco drive to an old suburban safe house. Tony goes upstairs to get some sleep, clutching the AR-10 assault rifle that Bobby gave him for his birthday.|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} to identify or rule out medical and psychological causes before deciding on the treatment for insomnia. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) {{has been found to}} be as effective as medications for the short-term treatment of chronic insomnia. The beneficial effects, in contrast to those produced by medications, may last well beyond the stopping of therapy. Medications have been used mainly to reduce symptoms in insomnia of short duration; their role in the management of chronic insomnia remains unclear. Several different types of medications are also effective for treating insomnia. However, many <b>doctors</b> <b>do</b> not recommend relying on prescription sleeping pills for long-term use. It is also important to identify and treat other medical conditions that may be contributing to insomnia, such as depression, breathing problems, and chronic pain.|$|E

500|$|Max Pemberton, a psychiatrist, {{wrote in}} the Daily Telegraph that [...] "this is a book to make you enraged... because it's about how big {{business}} puts profits over patient welfare, allows people to die because they don't want to disclose damning research evidence, and the tricks they play to make sure <b>doctors</b> <b>do</b> not have all the evidence {{when it comes to}} appraising whether a drug really works or not." ...|$|E
500|$|Retaining {{secretions}} in the airways can worsen hypoxia {{and lead}} to infections. [...] Thus, {{an important part of}} treatment is pulmonary toilet, the use of suction, deep breathing, coughing, and other methods to remove material such as mucus and blood from the airways. [...] Chest physical therapy makes use of techniques such as breathing exercises, stimulation of coughing, suctioning, percussion, movement, vibration, and drainage to rid the lungs of secretions, increase oxygenation, and expand collapsed parts of the lungs. People with pulmonary contusion, especially those who do not respond well to other treatments, may be positioned with the uninjured lung lower than the injured one to improve oxygenation. Inadequate pulmonary toilet can result in pneumonia. People who do develop infections are given antibiotics. No studies have yet shown a benefit of using antibiotics as a preventative measure before infection occurs, although some <b>doctors</b> <b>do</b> recommend prophylactic antibiotic use even without scientific evidence of its benefit. However, this can cause the development of antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria, so giving antibiotics without a clear need is normally discouraged. For people who are at especially high risk of developing infections, the sputum can be cultured to test for the presence of infection-causing bacteria; when they are present, antibiotics are used.|$|E

2500|$|Critics {{tend to view}} {{efforts to}} reduce medical {{services}} as [...] "healthcare rationing in the United States". Since <b>doctors</b> <b>do</b> {{not want to be}} seen as withholding care, they are hesitant to change established behavior in any way that lessens the amount of treatment they order. Doctors say that they often feel pressure to engage in defensive medicine by conducting extra testing to avoid lawsuits.|$|E
2500|$|Naturopathic {{doctors are}} not {{eligible}} for medical residencies, which are available exclusively for medical doctors and doctors of osteopathic medicine. There are limited post-graduate [...] "residency" [...] positions available to naturopathic doctors offered through naturopathic schools and naturopathic clinics approved by the CNME. Most naturopathic <b>doctors</b> <b>do</b> not complete such a residency, and naturopathic doctors are not mandated to complete one for licensure, except in the state of Utah. Continuing education in naturopathic modalities for health care professionals varies greatly.|$|E

2500|$|There are {{two ways}} for {{providers}} to be reimbursed in Medicare. “Participating” providers accept [...] "assignment," [...] {{which means that they}} accept Medicare’s approved rate for their services as payment (typically 80% from Medicare and 20% from the beneficiary). Some non participating <b>doctors</b> <b>do</b> not take assignment, but they also treat Medicare enrollees and are authorized to balance bill no more than a small fixed amount above Medicare’s approved rate. A minority of doctors are [...] "private contractors," [...] which means they opt out of Medicare and refuse to accept Medicare payments altogether. These doctors are required to inform patients that they will be liable for the full cost of their services out-of-pocket in advance of treatment.|$|E
2500|$|However, some <b>doctors</b> <b>do</b> not {{review their}} {{transcribed}} reports for accuracy, {{and the computer}} attaches an electronic signature with the disclaimer that a report is [...] "dictated but not read". This electronic signature is readily acceptable in a legal sense. The transcriptionist is bound to transcribe verbatim (exactly what is said) and make no changes, but has the option to flag any report inconsistencies. On some occasions, the <b>doctors</b> <b>do</b> not speak clearly, or voice files are garbled. Some doctors are, unfortunately, time-challenged and need to dictate their reports quickly (as in ER Reports). In addition, there are many regional or national accents and (mis)pronunciations of words the MT must contend with. It is imperative and {{a large part of}} the job of the Transcriptionist to look up the correct spelling of complex medical terms, medications, obvious dosage or dictation errors, and when in doubt should [...] "flag" [...] a report. A [...] "flag" [...] on a report requires the dictator (or his designee) to fill in a blank on a finished report, which has been returned to him, before it is considered complete. Transcriptionists are never, ever permitted to guess, or 'just put in anything' in a report transcription. Furthermore, medicine is constantly changing. New equipment, new medical devices, and new medications come on the market on a daily basis, and the Medical Transcriptionist needs to be creative and [...] to tenaciously research (quickly) to find these new words. An MT needs to have access to, or keep on memory, an up-to-date library to quickly facilitate the insertion of a correctly spelled device.|$|E
2500|$|A report {{published}} by Health Canada in 2008 included statistics on self-reported wait times for diagnostic services. The median wait time for diagnostic {{services such as}} MRI and CAT scans is two weeks with 89.5% waiting less than 3 months. [...] The median wait {{time to see a}} special physician is a little over four weeks with 86.4% waiting less than 3 months. The median wait time for surgery is a little over four weeks with 82.2% waiting less than 3 months. In the U.S., patients on Medicaid, the low-income government programs, can wait three months or more to see specialists. Because Medicaid payments are low, some have claimed that some <b>doctors</b> <b>do</b> not want to see Medicaid patients. For example, in Benton Harbor, Michigan, specialists agreed to spend one afternoon every week or two at a Medicaid clinic, which meant that Medicaid patients had to make appointments not at the doctor's office, but at the clinic, where appointments had to be booked months in advance. A 2009 study found that on average the wait in the United States to see a medical specialist is 20.5 days.|$|E

2500|$|Josh {{returns on}} January 14, 2009. He visits with a {{comatose}} Kendall, telling {{her how much}} he loves her {{and that he will}} make Zach pay for sending him into exile. A day later, after stealing ten million dollars from the casino, he takes Reese Williams (Bianca's new lover) hostage to ensure his escape. Erica and Bianca try {{to talk him out of}} the crime, but Josh refuses. Once Reese breaks free from Josh's grasp, Zach raises his gun at Josh. Josh, in turn, raises his gun at Zach. Zach does not hesitate in shooting Josh. As Josh is dying, he professes his love for Erica and Kendall and says that he just wanted a second chance. He soon dies. Zach orders the paramedics [...] to keep Josh's heart pumping in order to save Kendall, who needs a heart transplant. Josh is put on life support and pronounced brain dead. It is Erica's decision whether or not to let the <b>doctors</b> <b>do</b> the heart transplant. She is torn on the matter, but there is no time to spare, as Kendall will soon die. Erica gives permission for the surgery and says goodbye to Josh with Bianca.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{court cases}} have {{concerned}} the rights for patients, or of minor patients' legal guardians, to refuse medical treatment {{even if there}} is a risk of death. For example, in a 2001 case, doctors at a French public hospital who gave blood products to a patient with an acute renal insufficiency were found not to have committed a mistake of a nature to involve the responsibility of the State. The Council stated that [...] "there does not exist, for the doctor, an abstract and unalterable hierarchy between the obligation to treat the patient, and that to respect the will of the patient," [...] concluding that faced with a decision to treat patients against their will, <b>doctors</b> <b>do</b> not have a legally predefined obligation to treat the patient, nor do they have a legally predefined obligation to abide by their wishes. One year later, after the adoption of the Kouchner Law on patients' rights and quality of the health system, the Council of State recalled that not respecting the patient's wishes violates his individual freedom, but the doctor did not commit a fault if under extreme conditions he performs an intervention “necessary and proportionate to its state” {{in order to try to}} save the patient's life.|$|E
