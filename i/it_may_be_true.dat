25|$|The Round Table first {{appears in}} Wace's Roman de Brut, a Norman {{language}} adaptation of Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae finished in 1155. Wace says Arthur created the Round Table to prevent quarrels among his barons, {{none of whom}} would accept a lower place than the others. Layamon added to the story when he adapted Wace's work into the Middle English Brut in the early 13th century, saying that the quarrel between Arthur's vassals led to violence at a Yuletide feast. In response a Cornish carpenter built an enormous but easily transportable Round Table to prevent further dispute. Wace claims {{he was not the}} source of the Round Table; both he and Layamon credited it instead to the Bretons. Some scholars have doubted this claim, while others believe <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>true.</b> There is some similarity between the chroniclers' description of the Round Table and a custom recorded in Celtic stories, in which warriors sit in a circle around the king or lead warrior, in some cases feuding over the order of precedence as in Layamon. There is a possibility that Wace, contrary to his own claims, derived Arthur's round table not from any Breton source, but rather from medieval biographies of Charlemagne—notably Einhard's Vita Caroli and Notker the Stammerer's De Carolo Magno—in which the king is said to have possessed a round table decorated with a map of Rome.|$|E

While <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>true</b> that some Arab activists are separatists, most see themselves as Iranians first and declare their commitment to the state's territorial integrity." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Court {{concludes that}} the {{definitions}} of a Pit Bull Terrier in this Ordinance are not unconstitutionally vague. [...] An ordinary person could easily refer to a dictionary, a dog buyer's guide or any dog book for guidance and instruction; [...] also, the American Kennel Club and United Kennel Club have set forth standards for Staffordshire Bull Terriers and American Staffordshire Terriers to help determine whether a dog is described by any one of them. While <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>true</b> that some definitions contain descriptions which lack [...] "mathematical certainty," [...] such precision and definiteness is not essential to constitutionality.|$|E
60|$|If he {{mean this}} ironically, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>truer</b> than he thinks. He points it, however, by no {{deviation}} from his straightforward manner of speech, though in saying it he turns towards {{that part of}} the dim room where my Lady sits. Sir Leicester stands to return his parting salutation, Mr. Tulkinghorn again rings, Mercury takes another flight, and Mr. Rouncewell and Rosa leave the house.|$|R

2500|$|... "The {{burden of}} proof provision," [...] Swan wrote, [...] "supplies the best basis for {{argument}} against recognizing an agreement to arbitrate in an action of this nature." [...] No guarantee existed that arbitrators would apply such a provision properly. Swan agreed but noted that the court had already declared the liability release invalid, so the arbitrators would not be considering it. And [...] "while <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>true</b> that arbitrators do not ordinarily consider themselves bound to decide strictly according to legal rules, {{there can be no}} doubt that they are so bound if the arbitration agreement so provides." [...] A court could always review the arbitrators' decision when it came time to enforce the award, he added.|$|E
2500|$|The Court's {{apparent}} {{suggestion that}} [...] "any {{technology can be}} seen as emerging", the Review suggested, would not only lead to muddled future jurisprudence, but was in contrast to various lower courts' more successful efforts to do so. [...] "While <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>true</b> that technological advances and the increased availability of advanced mobile handsets to individual consumers have blurred the line between private life and the workplace", the article concluded, [...] "it does not necessarily follow that a user has a reasonable expectation of privacy on workplace equipment provided by the employer". As Kennedy had also noted, the proliferation of personal communications devices could make workers more respectful of those distinctions. The Review cited as an example the widespread use of email from work computers.|$|E
