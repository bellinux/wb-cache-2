5|$|In {{the stories}} he narrates, the Baron is shown as a calm, {{rational}} man, describing what he experiences with simple objectivity; absurd happenings elicit, at most, mild surprise from him, and he shows serious doubt about any unlikely events {{he has not}} witnessed himself. The resulting narrative effect is an ironic tone, encouraging skepticism <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> and marked by a running undercurrent of subtle social satire. In addition to his fearlessness when hunting and fighting, he is suggested to be a debonair, polite gentleman given to moments of , with a scholarly penchant for knowledge, {{a tendency to be}} pedantically accurate about details in his stories, and a deep appreciation for food and drink of all kinds. The Baron also provides a solid geographical and social context for his narratives, peppering them with topical allusions and satire about recent events; indeed, many of the references in Raspe's original text are to historical incidents in the real-life Münchhausen's military career.|$|E

25|$|Roquentin's {{difficulties}} as {{arising from}} man's inherent existential condition. His seemingly special circumstances (returning from travel, reclusiveness), which {{goes beyond the}} mere indication of his very real depression, are supposed to induce in him (and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>reader)</b> a state that makes one more receptive to noticing an existential situation that everyone has, but may not be sensitive enough to let become noticeable. Roquentin undergoes a strange metaphysical experience that estranges him from the world. His problems are not merely a result of personal insanity, without larger significance. Rather, like {{the characters in the}} Dostoevsky and Rilke novels, they are victims of larger ideological, social, and existential forces that have brought them to the brink of insanity. Sartre's point in Nausea is to comment on our universal reaction to these common external problems.|$|E

25|$|Signaling {{between the}} reader and the tag is done in several {{different}} incompatible ways, depending on the frequency band used by the tag. Tags operating on LF and HF bands are, in terms of radio wavelength, {{very close to the}} reader antenna because they are {{only a small percentage of}} a wavelength away. In this near field region, the tag is closely coupled electrically with the transmitter <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>reader.</b> The tag can modulate the field produced by the reader by changing the electrical loading the tag represents. By switching between lower and higher relative loads, the tag produces a change that the reader can detect. At UHF and higher frequencies, the tag is more than one radio wavelength away from the reader, requiring a different approach. The tag can backscatter a signal. Active tags may contain functionally separated transmitters and receivers, and the tag need not respond on a frequency related to the reader's interrogation signal.|$|E

500|$|With all his {{frequently}} noted {{attention to}} character and characters—Hazlitt's partly psychological approach to character necessarily referred to observed real-life behavior—he also frequently emphasises the art by which Shakespeare created dramatic [...] "character". Particularly in tragedy, a [...] "sense of power", he believed, {{is the essential}} medium by which a poet of genius operates {{on the minds of}} his audience. When the author instills <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> or viewer's imagination the sense of power that he must have had in grasping and conveying intertwined passions, he makes us identify with a character such as Othello, and feel in ourselves the way Iago plays upon his mind so that, ironically, his weakness is made to undermine his strength.|$|E

500|$|Alvarez {{defies the}} Aristotelian {{notion of a}} well-knit plot, as {{the story is told}} in reverse chronological order through a series of fifteen chapters, with no linear, unifying storyline. In Julia Alvarez: A {{critical}} companion, Scholar Silvio Sirias argues that [...] "a well-constructed plot has an underlying structure that promises the reader that the author is in control, and that any event she is telling will eventually make sense". Sirias then goes on to explain how Alvarez's initial exposure of the girls to the reader in their somewhat adjusted, adult states enables her to first evoke certain assumptions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> and subsequently shatter these assumptions with the disclosure of the García family's troubled past. Scholar Julie Barak argues that the reverse chronological order Alvarez employs is actually a unique stylistic technique which adds [...] "to the reader's uncertainty and instability, [...] of the Garcia girls' own ambiguities".|$|E
500|$|Burke criticizes many British {{thinkers and}} writers who welcomed {{the early stages}} of the French Revolution. While the {{radicals}} likened the revolution to Britain's own Glorious Revolution in 1688, which had restricted the powers of the monarchy, Burke argues that the appropriate historical analogy was the English Civil War (1642–1651), in which Charles I had been executed in 1649. At the time Burke was writing, however, there had been very little revolutionary violence; more concerned with persuading his readers than informing them, he greatly exaggerated this element of the revolution in his text for rhetorical effect. In his Enquiry into the Sublime and Beautiful, he had argued that [...] "large inexact notions convey ideas best", and to generate fear <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>reader,</b> in Reflections he constructs the set-piece of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette forced from their palace at sword point. When the violence actually escalated in France in 1793 with the Reign of Terror, Burke was viewed as a prophet.|$|E

In an effort to add more music to the column, he [...] "just made stuff up," [...] concocting and reviewing fictional bands and nonexistent records. In the following week's column, he would confess to fabricating everything in the previous column and swear that everything in the new column was true. Eventually, he was finally asked to give up the [...] "music" [...] column. Among the fans of the column was Harry Shearer, who would later become a voice on The Simpsons.|$|E

500|$|According to Stuart Jeffries, [...] "...psychoanalytic {{critiques of}} her work have multiplied since her death in 1943." [...] Carole Scott writes in Beatrix Potter's Peter Rabbit that the reader cannot help but {{identify}} with rebellious little Peter and his plight as all the illustrations are presented from his low-to-the-ground view, most feature Peter in close-up and within touching distance, and Mr. McGregor is distanced from the reader by always being depicted {{on the far side}} of Peter. Scott explains: [...] "This identification dramatically instills fear and tension <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>reader,</b> and interacts with the frequently distanced voice of the verbal narrative", sometimes with contradictory effects. [...] In the verbal narrative and the illustration for the moment when Mr. McGregor attempts to trap Peter under a garden sieve, for example, the verbal narrative presents the murderous intent of Mr. McGregor as a matter-of-fact, everyday occurrence while the illustration presents the desperate moment from the terrified view of a small animal in fear of his life – a view that is reinforced by the birds that take flight to the left and the right.|$|E
500|$|Hergé biographer Pierre Assouline {{believed}} Tintin in America to be [...] "more {{developed and}} detailed" [...] than the prior Adventures, representing the cartoonist's [...] "greatest success" [...] in a [...] "long time". Opining that the illustrations were [...] "superior" [...] due to Hergé's accumulated experience, he nevertheless criticised instances where the story exhibited directional problems; for instance, in one scene, Tintin enters the underground tunnel, but Assouline notes {{that while he}} is supposed to be travelling downward, he is instead depicted climbing up stairs. Such directional problems were also criticised by Michael Farr, who nevertheless thought the story [...] "action-packed", with a more developed sense of satire and therefore greater depth than Soviets or Congo. He considered the depiction of Tintin climbing along the ledge of the skyscraper on page 10 to be [...] "one of the most remarkable" [...] illustrations in the entire series, inducing a sense of vertigo <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>reader.</b> He also opined that the depiction of the Blackfoot Natives being forced from their land was the [...] "strongest political statement" [...] in the series, illustrating that Hergé had [...] "an acute political conscience" [...] and was not the advocate of racial superiority that he has been accused of being. Comparing the 1932 and 1945 versions of the comic, Farr believed that the latter was technically superior, but had lost the [...] "freshness" [...] of the original.|$|E
500|$|To avoid a {{scheduling}} {{conflict with}} Revolutionary Road, Winslet {{turned down an}} offer to star <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Reader.</b> After her replacement Nicole Kidman left the project due to her pregnancy, Winslet was signed to it. Directed by Stephen Daldry, The Reader is based on Bernhard Schlink's novel {{of the same name}} and is about Hanna Schmitz, an illiterate Nazi camp guard (Winslet), who has an affair with a teenage boy. Winslet researched on the Holocaust and the SS guards, and was traumatised by what she learnt. To educate herself on the stigma attached to illiteracy, she spent time with students at the Literacy Partners, an organisation that teaches adults to read and write. A merkin was designed for her frontal nude scenes, but she refused to wear it. Winslet was unable to sympathise with Schmitz, saying that [...] "there was nothing of her that I could relate to", and struggled to find [...] "honesty and truthfulness" [...] to the part without humanising her actions. Despite this, certain historians criticised the film for making Schmitz an object of audience's sympathy and accused the filmmakers of Holocaust revisionism. Even so, Winslet's performance was acclaimed; the critic Todd McCarthy commended her for supplying [...] "a haunting shell to this internally decimated woman", and writing for The Daily Telegraph, Sukhdev Sandhu considered her to be [...] "absolutely fearless here, not just in her willingness to expose herself physically, but her refusal to expose her character psychologically".|$|E

500|$|Trimmer {{is perhaps}} most famous now for her {{condemnation}} of fairy tales, such as the various translations of Charles Perrault's Histoires ou Contes du Temps passé (1697). She disliked fairy tales because they endorsed an irrational {{view of the world}} and success without work. Trimmer's view of fairy tales, although often ridiculed by modern critics, was widespread {{at the end of the}} eighteenth century, in part because most educators accepted John Locke's theory that the mind was a tabula rasa and therefore particularly sensitive to impressions early in life. Trimmer was opposed to fairy tales that were not grounded in reality and which would [...] "excite an unregulated sensibility" [...] <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>reader.</b> Without a proper moral or a moralizing narrator, fairy tales could lead a reader astray. Above all, she was concerned about [...] "unmediated", unknown, and unsupervised feelings in the child reader. One of the reasons Trimmer believed fairy tales were dangerous was because they led child readers into a fantasy world where adults could not follow and control their exposure to harmful experiences. She was just as horrified by the graphic illustrations included with some fairy tale collections, complaining that [...] "little children, whose minds are susceptible of every impression; and who from the liveliness of their imaginations are apt to convert into realities whatever forcibly strikes their fancy" [...] should not be allowed to see such scenes as Blue Beard hacking his wife's head off.|$|E
2500|$|The Black Iron Prison was {{an effort}} to create an updated, modern book that would {{function}} as Principia Discordia did when released. The collaborators stated that [...] "while the original Principia Discordia holds important messages and philosophies, we wondered if some of the humor and language might be dated and lost on a younger generation of Discordians. We wanted to crystalize some of our favorite themes from the Principia, those of radical free will and self-emancipation." [...] The goal was to encourage [...] "critical thinking and self awareness" [...] <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>reader.</b>|$|E
2500|$|.....contemporary {{readers are}} {{reminded}} by Machiavelli's teaching of Thucydides; they find in both authors the same [...] "realism," [...] i.e., the same {{denial of the}} power of the gods or of justice and the same sensitivity to harsh necessity and elusive chance. Yet Thucydides never calls in question the intrinsic superiority of nobility to baseness, a superiority that shines forth particularly when the noble is destroyed by the base. Therefore Thucydides' History arouses <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> a sadness which is never aroused by Machiavelli's books. In Machiavelli we find comedies, parodies, and satires but nothing reminding of tragedy. One half of humanity remains outside of his thought. There is no tragedy in Machiavelli because he has no sense of the sacredness of [...] "the common." [...] — ...|$|E
