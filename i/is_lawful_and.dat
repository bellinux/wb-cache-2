2500|$|The Tenure of Kings and Magistrates: {{proving that}} it <b>is</b> <b>lawful,</b> <b>and</b> hath been held so through the ages, for any, {{who have the}} Power, to call to account a Tyrant, or wicked King, and after due conviction, to depose, and put him to death; if the {{ordinary}} MAGISTRATE have neglected, or deny’d to do it.

2500|$|Resh Lakish {{taught that}} great is repentance, for because of it, Heaven {{accounts}} premeditated sins as errors, as [...] says, “Return, O Israel, to the Lord, your God, for you have stumbled in your iniquity.” “Iniquity” refers to premeditated sins, and yet Hosea calls them “stumbling,” implying that Heaven considers those who repent of intentional sins {{as if they}} acted accidentally. [...] But the Gemara said {{that that is not}} all, for Resh Lakish also said that repentance is so great that with it, Heaven accounts premeditated sins as though they were merits, as [...] says, “And when the wicked turns from his wickedness, and does that which <b>is</b> <b>lawful</b> <b>and</b> right, he shall live thereby.” The Gemara reconciled the two positions, clarifying that in the sight of Heaven, repentance derived from love transforms intentional sins to merits, while repentance out of fear transforms intentional sins to unwitting transgressions.|$|E
60|$|He {{who tries}} to do as Christ did, and he only, has Christ's righteousness imputed to him, because {{he is trying to}} do what Christ did, that which <b>is</b> <b>lawful</b> <b>and</b> right. He who does righteousness, and he only, has truly repented, changed his mind about what he should do, and turned away from his wickedness which he has committed, and is now doing that which <b>is</b> <b>lawful</b> <b>and</b> right. He who does righteousness, and he only, shall save his soul alive: not by feeling this thing, or believing about that thing, but by doing that which <b>is</b> <b>lawful</b> <b>and</b> right.|$|E

60|$|On {{the meaning}} of usury, I would add a few words. I start with this proposition. There is nothing {{contrary}} {{to the will of}} God for one free man to buy from another free man anything he wants. I have two houses,--one I live in, one I let. My tenant pays the market rent of houses to me, and so both parties are benefited. I have two thousand pounds. I have no capacity, or opportunity, or desire to use more than one thousand pounds in trade on my own account. My neighbour has energy and activity to use more money than he has in trade. He gladly offers me five per cent. for my spare thousand pounds. I willingly lend it on those terms. He makes ten per cent. by using it. He gives me five pounds and has five pounds for himself. If this be usury, it <b>is</b> <b>lawful</b> <b>and</b> right.|$|E
