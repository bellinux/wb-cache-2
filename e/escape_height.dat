40|$|The hydrophobic-hydrophilic (H-P) {{model for}} protein folding was {{introduced}} by Dill et al. [6]. A problem instance consists of a sequence of amino acids, each labeled as either hydrophobic (H) or hydrophilic (P). The sequence must be placed on a 2 D or 3 D grid without overlapping, so that adjacent amino acids in the sequence remain adjacent in the grid. The goal is to minimize the energy, which in the simplest variation corresponds to maximizing the number of adjacent hydrophobic pairs. Although the model is extremely simple, it captures the main features of the problem. The protein folding problem in the H-P model is NP-hard in both 2 D and 3 D. Recently, Fu and Wang [9] proved an exp(O(n ln n) algorithm for d-dimensional protein folding simulation in the HP-model. Our preliminary results on stochastic search applied to protein folding utilize complete move sets proposed by Lesh et al. [15] and Blazewicz et al. [3]. We obtain that after (n/#) Markov chain transitions, the probability {{to be in a}} minimum energy conformation is at least 1 where n is the length of the instance, # is the maximum value of the minimum <b>escape</b> <b>height</b> from local minima of the underlying energy landscape, and c is a (small) constant...|$|E

40|$|To recruit to {{reproductive}} size in fire-prone savannas, juvenile trees {{must avoid}} stem mortality (topkill) by fire. Theory suggests they either grow tall, raising apical buds above the flames, or wide, buffering the stem from fire. However, growing tall or wide {{is of no}} advantage without stem protection from fire. In Litchfield National Park, northern Australia, we explored the importance of bark thickness to stem survival following fire in a eucalypt-dominated tropical savanna. We measured bark thickness, prefire height, stem diameter and resprouting responses of small stems under conditions of low to moderate fire intensity. Fire induced mortality was low (, 10 %), topkill was uncommon (, 11 % of 5 m to 37 % of 1 m tall stems) and epicormic resprouting was common. Topkill was correlated only with absolute bark thickness and not with stem height or width. Thus, observed height and diameter growth responses of small stems are likely different pathways to achieving bark thick enough to protect buds and the vascular cambium. Juvenile height was traded off against the cost of thick bark, so that wide stems were short with thicker bark for a given height. The fire resilience threshold for bark thickness differed between tall (4 – 5 mm) and wide individuals (8 – 9 mm), yet tall stems had lower PTopkill for a given bark thickness. Trends in PTopkill reflected eucalypt versus non-eucalypt differences. Eucalypts had thinner bark than non-eucalypts but lower PTopkill. With deeply embedded epicormic buds eucalypts do not need thick bark to protect buds and can allocate resources to height growth. Our data suggest the only ‘strategy’ for avoiding topkill in fireprone systems is to optimise bark thickness to maximise stem bud and cambium protection. Thus, <b>escape</b> <b>height</b> is the height at which bark protects the stem and a wide stem per se is insufficient protection from fire without thick bark. Consequently, absolute bark thickness is crucial to explanations of species differences in topkill, resprouting response and tree community composition in fire-prone savannas. Bark thickness and the associated mechanism of bud protection offer a proximate explanation for the dominance of eucalypts in Australian tropical savannas...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 85 - 91). Many grassland areas {{throughout the}} world may support a woody biomass if fire is suppressed. It is puzzling that fire-tolerant savanna trees do not grow in these grasslands. The Highveld grasslands of South Africa are one such grassland. Hypotheses including fire, human intervention, grass competition and various attributes of soil have been proposed to explain the tree-less nature of the Highveld grasslands, but they have mostly been discounted. In this study it was hypothesised that cool temperatures or low nutrient availability would result in slow growth of saplings in grassland areas that would subsequently {{not be able to}} escape frequent fires. Alternatively, frost may exclude trees from grasslands. A seedling transplant experiment of savanna tree species of the Acacia genus, into grassland and savanna areas arranged across an altitudinal gradient, was used to compare growth in these varying climates over one growing season, and the influence of frost on seedlings in the following winter. Soils were collected from grassland and savanna regions to establish if nutrients varied between these areas, and seedling growth was measured in a pot experiment including these different soils. To minimise the effect of other variables, seedlings were watered and grass was excluded. Higher altitude grassland areas were cooler, and the grassland soils that were collected were nutrient-poor, relative to the savanna equivalents, {{with the exception of one}} nutrient-poor low altitude soil. Growth was well correlated to both temperature and nutrient availability, and in general there was slower growth in grassland climates and grassland soils compared to in savannas. These seedling growth rates were extrapolated to the growth rates of saplings in natural environments and the time it would take saplings to reach a height above flame height was calculated. This showed that although there were significant differences between growth rates in grassland and savanna soils, the magnitude of these differences was not large enough to prevent saplings from growing into adults in grassland soils. Differences in growth due to temperature variations, however, were large enough to suggest that saplings in grassland climates would grow too slowly to ever reach <b>escape</b> <b>height</b> between frequent fires. Frost caused damage to seedlings and decreased seedling survival at the highest elevation sites, but trees were absent well below the altitudinal limit of frost damage. There has been much discussion about the tree-less nature of the Highveld grasslands, but very little experimental work to back it. Neither temperature nor fire alone can explain the lack of trees. This study provides empirical evidence that slow growth due to low temperatures in combination with frequent fire could exclude savanna trees from the grasslands. The effect of grass competition still needs investigation. The incorporation of fire is useful as it is a fundamental part of C 4 ecosystems; this, on top of a base of variable growth due to changes in resource availability. The barely recognised savanna tree-line deserves attention, as savannas continue to invade grasslands in a warming world...|$|E
40|$|Are South African Buildings as Safe as New Zealand Buildings?” A person {{going into}} or using a {{building}} {{anywhere in the}} world has certain expectations as to the perceived and acceptable level of risk to life safety. There are also societal expectations and acceptability levels which are perhaps not explicitly stated. Building legislation in both New Zealand and South Africa appear to have similar goals, yet when applying the relative prescriptive document to a similar building in each country the perception is that one country has a higher level of safety over the other. Having worked {{for a number of years}} under both sets of building design regimes, the author was of the opinion that aspects of one prescriptive document has more stringent requirements than the other and that buildings in the one country thus had a higher apparent level of life safety than the other. The question was asked: How much difference is there in (fire) life safety for an occupant of a building in New Zealand compared to a building in South Africa? Is a similar building designed to a higher standard in one country as opposed to the other? To test the author‟s hypothesis in a measured way a scoring system was required to quantify the relative level of safety. The comparison is carried out using the Fire Safety Index scoring system developed by McGhie. A spreadsheet analysis is carried out for similar building types (Building Use, Height, Fire Load and Number of Occupants) complying with each country‟s relevant acceptable solution or deemed-to-satisfy document using McGhie‟s weighted risk ranking model. Buildings are assessed across four Building Use Parameters (Purpose Group, <b>Escape</b> <b>Height,</b> Occupant Numbers and Fire Hazard Category). As the buildings assessed are very similar, the Building Use Scores are virtually identical; with some variations, for example, when occupant numbers are capped because of limitations on fire cell floor areas. The Fire Safety Features Score for each building is then assessed for the minimum requirements of the prescriptive documents across eight main category headings (Fire Barriers, Fire Alarm, Smoke Control, Building Fire Control, Emergency Power Supply, Communication System, Fire Service and Means of Escape) and a number of sub-categories. Once the attribute score is assigned and the ii weighting applied the total score is summed and a numerical rating score is achieved for each building out of a possible maximum score of 5. As approximately 63 % of commercial buildings (in NZ) are single storey and a further 28 % are two-storey‟s high, the discussion of the differences in score between the two sets of buildings will primarily focus on one and two storey buildings, and the scoring is weighted to account for the relative building stock, with averaging used for the various occupant loads. The results show that for equivalent Working Purpose groups (WL), Mercantile Occupancies (CM) and Residential Occupancies (SR) the South African buildings are safer than the New Zealand buildings. Occupancies which are Crowd Activities (CL) and Sleeping Accommodation (SA) are safer in New Zealand than in South Africa. The Working Moderate fire load (WM) occupancy is rated equal for both countries...|$|E

Electrons are traced in linear force-free magnetic fields extrapolated from SOHO/MDI magnetograms, endowed with anomalous resistivity (η) in localized dissipation regions where the magnetic twist ∇× exceeds a given threshold. Associated with η > 0 is a parallel electric field E = η j which can accelerate runaway electrons. In {{order to gain}} observational predictions we inject electrons inside the dissipation regions and follow them for several seconds in real time. Precipitating electrons which leave the simulation system at height z = 0 are associated with hard X rays, and electrons which <b>escape</b> at <b>height</b> z ∼ 3 · 10 ^ 4 km are associated with normal-drifting type IIIs at the local plasma frequency. A third, trapped, population is related to gyrosynchrotron emission.

It is found that precipitation generally preceeds escape by fractions of a second, and that the electrons perform many visits to the dissipation regions before leaving the simulation system.

He is also {{responsible for the death of}} Malcolm Merlyn's wife, Rebecca, during an initiation of joining a criminal mob, the Orchid Bay Butchers, thus the cause for Malcolm's transformation into a ruthless villain and indirectly setting into motion the events of the series. In the show's third season, a trilogy of episodes where Oliver Queen is absent shows Brick taking control of the Glades, enforcing gang rule, he was opposed by the Arrow's team, including John Diggle, Felicity Smoak, Roy Harper and the new addition Laurel Lance, as the Black Canary. His gang rule was ended in an uprising led by Arsenal (Roy Harper) and the Black Canary, before Brick himself was ultimately defeated by Merlyn after he came close to killing him in retaliation for his wife's murder. He returns in Season 4, where he joins H.I.V.E. after he <b>escapes</b> from Iron <b>Heights</b> with Damien Darhk and teamed up with Murmur to take down Team Arrow, but was defeated.|$|R
40|$|Woodland {{restoration}} sites {{planted with}} Quercus lobata (valley oak) often have serious invasions of nonnative annual grasses and thistles. Although prescribed fire can effectively control these exotics, restoration managers {{may be reluctant}} to use fire if it causes substantial mortality of recently planted saplings. We studied the effects of prescribed fires on the survival and subsequent growth of 5 - and 6 -year-old valley oak saplings at a research field near Davis, California. One set of blocks was burned in summer 2003 at a time that would control yellow star thistle, a second set of blocks was burned in spring 2004 at a time that would control annual grasses, and a third set was left unburned. Very few oaks {{died as a result of}} either fire (3 – 4 %). Although a large proportion was top-killed (66 – 72 %), virtually all these were coppiced and most saplings over 300 cm tall <b>escaped</b> top-kill. Tree <b>height,</b> fire temperature, and understory biomass were all predictive of the severity of sapling response to fire. Although the mean sapling height was initially reduced by the fires, the growth rates of burned saplings significantly exceeded the growth rates of unburned control trees for 2 years following the fires. By 2 – 3 years after the fires, the mean height of spring- and summer-burned saplings was similar to that of the unburned control saplings. The presence of valley oak saplings does not appear to preclude the use of a single prescribed burn to control understory invasives, particularly if saplings are over 300 cm tall...|$|R
