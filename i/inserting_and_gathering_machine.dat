The resulting peripatetic, sculptural work operated as a mobile field-data <b>gathering</b> <b>machine.</b> Following circular fairground routes and disused sites, material was gathered and translated via the machine to produce visual 'light' works that acted as a record of that experience...|$|R

40|$|A multiagent {{simulation}} is used {{to explore}} {{the relationship between the}} micro and the macro levels in small-scale societies. The simulation demonstrates the way in which population stability may arise from culturally framed, micro level decision making by women about spacing of births in hunting <b>and</b> <b>gathering</b> societies. According to the simulation, population stability as an emergent property has different implications, depending on resource density. Data on Australian hunting <b>and</b> <b>gathering</b> groups are presented that support the implications of the simulation. Cultural rules on marriage from a hunting <b>and</b> <b>gathering</b> group known as the!Kung san are also shown to have macro level consequences arising from individual level specification. The emergent pattern has significant implications for access to resources. Extant hunting <b>and</b> <b>gathering</b> societies typify the means of food procurement, if not the precise societal form, used by modern Homo sapiens prior to the changes introduced through a shift from a wild to a domesticated food resource base beginning about 10, 000 BP. Hunting <b>and</b> <b>gathering</b> societies are thus the context within which the underlying properties of human societies were created and developed. Although extant hunting <b>and</b> <b>gathering</b> societie...|$|R

The system consists of industrial digital cameras and industrial control computer to form a distributed control system that uses Ethernet to communicate information between host computer and slave computer. Using normalized correlation algorithm for image recognition, IPC can recognize the defective product, and send signals to rejection mechanism to deliver out the unqualified signatures automatically. After repeated tests, the system can promptly identify the defective product such as mixed up signatures, missing signatures and other errors with high recognition rate, and effectively improves the quality of printed products...|$|R

40|$|While "Pygmy" hunter-gatherers were {{generally}} {{assumed to be}} the original inhabitants of the central African rain forest, recent studies have proposed the hypothesis {{that it is impossible}} to subsist by hunting <b>and</b> <b>gathering</b> alone in the tropical rain forests without some degree of dependence on agricultural products. This hypothesis has been debated among researchers of hunter-gatherer societies in different parts of the world. There have been, however, few studies on this issue that were based on sound data on the actual hunting <b>and</b> <b>gathering</b> life of the forest peoples. This paper examines the possibility of hunting <b>and</b> <b>gathering</b> life in the tropical rain forest, based on the data obtained from participant observation on molongo, a long-term hunting <b>and</b> <b>gathering</b> expedition, among the Baka in southeastern Cameroon. During the two and a half months of the expedition, the Baka subsisted solely on wild food resources, wild yams in particular, although it was during the dry season when food resources are generally thought to be scarce. The sustainability of such a forest life is examined in relation to the abundance and distribution patterns of wild food resources, hunting <b>and</b> <b>gathering</b> technologies, residential patterns and nomadic life style...|$|R
