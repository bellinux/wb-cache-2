40|$|Quantum Chromodynamics {{predicts a}} phase {{transition}} from a state formed by hadrons to a plasma of <b>deconned</b> quarks and gluons, the Quark Gluon Plasma, as a the energy density exceeds a critical value. This <b>deconned</b> phase {{is believed to be}} the one in which the early universe existed in a time-scale 105 s after the Big Bang. Ultrarelativistic Heavy Ion Collisions, like the ones that take place at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at Brookhaven National Laboratory, reach en-ergy densities above the critical value creating a <b>deconned</b> phase of quarks and gluons that can be studied at the laboratory. This gives us the opportunity to study a phase of matter in the <b>deconned</b> region of QCD, the properties of the strong interaction, the formation of hadronic matter and the interaction between hadrons. In the analysis presented in this thesis, the dynamical evolution of the particle emitting source and its space-time structure at freeze-out is studied using the two particle intensity interferometry technique. The expansion of the source is also studied. We nd indications that this expansion may be caused by the initial pressure gradient generated in the initial stages of the collision through particle rescattering in a very dense medium. ii A mis padres, Carlos y Mercedes. ii...|$|R

40|$|Heavy-ion {{collisions}} at LHC energies {{create a}} hot and dense medium of <b>deconned</b> quarks and gluons, {{known as the}} quark-gluon plasma (QGP) [56]. The QGP reball rst expands, cools and then freezes out into a collection of nal-state hadrons. Correlations between the free particles carry information about the space-time extent of the emitting source, and are imprinted on the nal-state spectra due to a quantum-mechanical interference eect [18]. The correlation of two identical particles at small relative momentum, commonly known as intensity, or Hanbury Brown-Twiss (HBT), interferometry, is an eective tool to study the space-time structure of the emitting source in relativistic heavy-ion collisions [23]. Due to the position-momentum correlations in particle emission, the HBT radii become sensitive to the collective velocity fields, from which information about {{the dynamics of the}} system evolution can be extracted. The spatial anisotropies in the initial state are converted, via pressure gradients and interactions between constituents, to momentum anisotropies, leading to anisotropic particle flow. Anisotropic flow is usually characterized by the Fourier decomposition of the particle azimuthal distribution and quantied by the flow harmonic strength vn and the event plane angle [48]. Elliptic flow is dened by the second flow harmonic strength (n = 2), whereas triangular flow is dened by the third flow harmonic strength (n = 3) [48]. Azimuthally-dierential femtoscopic measurements can be performed relative to the di 100 rection of dierent harmonic event planes [25]. The harmonic event planes are determined using the event plane method [48]. The measurements of HBT radii with respect to the first harmonic (directed) flow at the AGS [30] revealed that the source was tilted relative to the beam direction [31]. In particular, measurements of the HBT radii relative to the second harmonic event plane angle (	 2) provide information on the nal shape of the system, which is expected to become more spherical compared to the initial state due to stronger in-plane expansion [55]. In contrast, hydrodynamics model {{studies have shown that the}} azimuthal dependence of the HBT radii relative to the third harmonic event plane angle can originate from the anisotropies in collective velocity gradients or the initial spatial anisotropy (triangular) [33]. The signs of the HBT radii relative to the third harmonic event plane angle oscillations constrain the origin of these oscillation [33]...|$|R
40|$|Work was {{performed}} to identify a process to vitrify the contents of F- canyon Tank 17. 1. Tank 17. 1 contains the majority of americium (Am) and curium (Cm) contained in the DOE Complex. Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) has made a formal request for this material as fuel for production of Cf 252 and other transplutonium actinides. The Am and Cm (and associated lanthanide fission products) are currently in nitric acid solution. Transportation of the intensely radioactive Am/Cm in liquid form is not considered possible. As a result, the material will either be solidified and shipped to ORNL or discarded to the Tank Farm. Nuclear Materials Processing Technology (NMPT), therefore, requested Defense Waste Processing Technology (DWPT) {{to determine if the}} Tank 17. 1 material could be vitrified, and if it was vitrified could the americium and curium be successfully recovered. Research {{was performed}} to determine if the Tank 17. 1 contents could indeed be mixed with glass formers and vitrified. Additional studies identified critical process parameters such as heat loading, melter requirements, off-gas evolution, etc. Discussions with NMPT personnel were initiated to determine existing facilities where this work could be accomplished safely. A process has been identified which will convert the Am/Cm material into approximately 300 kg of glass. This will be done by initially removing the large quantities of transition metals and aluminum. Oxalic acid will be added to Tank 17. 1 and the actinides and lanthanides will be precipitated as oxalates. The remaining aqueous fraction will be removed and the lanthanides and actinides will then be redissolved. The solution will be evaporated and steam stripped down to approximately 100 g/I solids and 1 N nitric acid prior to being transferred into a receipt/feed tank in the Multi- Purpose Processing Facility (MPPF - formerly Section 18 of F-Canyon). The Am/Cm solution will then be fed directly into a bushing melter. Glass beads will be added simultaneously alongside the solution and the mixture will be vitrified and cast into stainless steel canisters. The filled glass canisters will be allowed to cool and <b>deconned</b> prior to packaging for transport to ORNL. The melter will be capable of a minimum 1 - 2 kg/hr glass output, so total processing time will be on the order of a few hundred hours. The glass is a borosilicate composition designed to be selectively attacked by nitric acid. Complete recovery of Am and Cm surrogates (La, and Nd) from the glass has been demonstrated by a nitric acid extraction technique. While the glass can be attacked by concentrated acid, it is approximately 1000 times more durable than the required specification for high- level waste glass. The Am/Cm glass produced will simultaneously act as both a product Am/Cm glass is not processed by ORNL. This document details the results of our initial effort. Supporting documents concerning heat generation, off-gas modeling, melter design, and a process engineering flowsheet developed by NMPT are included...|$|R
