5|$|After Gordon fends off a Combine {{attack on}} the base, Alyx gives Dr. Kleiner the message from Judith Mossman {{recovered}} at the Citadel. It contains footage and the coordinates of the Borealis, an Aperture Science research vessel which, Kleiner explains, vanished along with part of the surrounding drydock. Kleiner insists {{that it should be}} used to aid the Resistance effort, while Eli counters {{that it is impossible to}} control and must be destroyed. They agree that Alyx and Gordon will travel to the Borealis and attempt to find Mossman. Alyx unconsciously delivers the G-Man's message to her father, shaking him. Alone with Gordon, Eli reveals that it was the G-Man who provided the test sample that caused the Black Mesa incident, and that <b>he</b> <b>whispered</b> the same warning to him as Gordon entered the test chamber. He promises to explain more after the portal is closed.|$|E

500|$|In her book, Couillard characterizes Bernier as intellectually lazy, {{preoccupied with}} his appearance, and as {{concerned}} that he appears gay. She writes further that Bernier privately criticized Prime Minister Stephen Harper's eating habits and his physique. She adds that Bernier spoke with party supporters about replacing Harper as the party leader, and says that Bernier opposed the invasion of Iraq contrary to his party's stance. [...] Further revelations regarding Bernier include that <b>he</b> <b>whispered</b> negative comments to Couillard about members of his electoral district; {{and that he did}} not own a laptop, yet frequently used her house and home computer as a second office.|$|E

500|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1938 Formby began work on Trouble Brewing, {{released}} the following year with 19-year-old Googie Withers as the female lead; Kimmins again directed. Withers later recounted that Formby did not speak to her until, during a break in filming when Beryl was not present, <b>he</b> <b>whispered</b> {{out of the corner}} of his mouth [...] "I'm sorry, love, but you know, I'm not allowed to speak to you", something she thought was [...] "very sweet". His second release of 1939—shortly after the outbreak of the Second World War—was Come On George!, which cast Pat Kirkwood in the female lead; the pair disliked each other intensely, and neither of the Formbys liked several of the other senior cast members. Come On George! was screened for troops serving in France before being released in Britain.|$|E
500|$|Edward {{became ill}} during January 1553 with a fever and cough that {{gradually}} worsened. The imperial ambassador, Jean Scheyfve, reported that [...] "he suffers {{a good deal}} when the fever is upon him, especially from a difficulty in drawing his breath, {{which is due to}} the compression of the organs on the right side". Edward felt well enough in early April to take the air in the park at Westminster and to move to Greenwich, {{but by the end of}} the month he had weakened again. By 7 May he was [...] "much amended", and the royal doctors had no doubt of his recovery. A few days later the king was watching the ships on the Thames, sitting at his window. However, he relapsed, and on 11 June Scheyfve, who had an informant in the king's household, reported that [...] "the matter he ejects from his mouth is sometimes coloured a greenish yellow and black, sometimes pink, like the colour of blood". Now his doctors believed he was suffering from [...] "a suppurating tumour" [...] of the lung and admitted that Edward's life was beyond recovery. Soon, his legs became so swollen that he had to lie on his back, and he lost the strength to resist the disease. To his tutor John Cheke <b>he</b> <b>whispered,</b> [...] "I am glad to die".|$|E
500|$|His tragic efforts, however, were {{consistently}} ridiculed by contemporaries: when Cibber {{in the role}} of Richard III made love to Lady Anne, the Grub Street Journal wrote, [...] "he looks like a pickpocket, with his shrugs and grimaces, that has more a design on her purse than her heart". Cibber was on the stage in every year but two (1727 and 1731) between his debut in 1690 and his retirement in 1732, playing more than 100 parts in all in nearly 3,000 documented performances. After he had sold his interest in Drury Lane in 1733 and was a wealthy man in his sixties, he returned to the stage occasionally to play the classic fop parts of Restoration comedy for which audiences appreciated him. His Lord Foppington in Vanbrugh's The Relapse, Sir Courtly Nice in John Crowne's Sir Courtly Nice, and Sir Fopling Flutter in George Etherege's Man of Mode were legendary. Critic John Hill in his 1775 work The actor, or, A treatise on the art of playing, described Cibber as [...] "the best Lord Foppington who ever appeared, was in real life (with all due respect be it spoken by one who loves him) something of the coxcomb". These were the kind of comic parts where Cibber's affectation and mannerism were desirable. In 1738–39, he played Shallow in Shakespeare's Henry IV, Part 2 to critical acclaim, but his Richard III (in his own version of the play) was not well received. In the middle of the play, <b>he</b> <b>whispered</b> to fellow actor Benjamin Victor that he wanted to go home, perhaps realising he was too old for the part and its physical demands. Cibber also essayed tragic parts in plays by Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, John Dryden and others, but with less success. By the end of his acting career, audiences were being entranced by the innovatively naturalistic acting of the rising star David Garrick, who made his London debut in the title part in a production of Cibber's adaptation of Richard III in 1741. He returned to the stage for a final time in 1745 as Cardinal Pandulph in his play Papal Tyranny in the Reign of King John.|$|E

2500|$|A PBS {{interview}} of six experts {{noted that the}} memory of the Tiananmen Square protests appears to have faded in China, especially among younger Chinese people, due to government censorship. Images of the protest on the Internet have been censored in China. When undergraduate students at Peking University, which {{was at the center of}} the incident, were shown copies of the iconic photograph 16 years afterwards, they were [...] "genuinely mystified." [...] One of the students said that the image was [...] "artwork." [...] It is noted in the documentary Frontline: The Tank Man that <b>he</b> <b>whispered</b> to the student next to him [...] "89," [...] which led the interviewer to surmise that the student may have concealed his knowledge of the event.|$|E
2500|$|According to {{a letter}} written 30 years later to Francis Darwin, when Huxley heard this <b>he</b> <b>whispered</b> to Brodie, [...] "The Lord hath {{delivered}} him into mine hands". This quotation first appears {{more than thirty years}} later, and is almost certainly a later insertion to the story. Huxley's own contemporary account, in a letter to Henry Dyster on September 9, 1860, makes no mention of this remark. Huxley rose to defend Darwin's theory, finishing his speech with the now-legendary assertion that he was not ashamed to have a monkey for his ancestor, but he would be ashamed to be connected with a man who used great gifts to obscure the truth. Again, later retellings indicate that this had a tremendous effect on the audience, and Lady Brewster is said to have fainted.|$|E

2500|$|Burnham {{became very}} ill and {{was allowed to}} return to Switzerland for his health. The French {{government}} quickly transported Burnham to Cannes, France.

[...] His dying words <b>he</b> <b>whispered</b> to his surgeon: [...] "Always have I wanted to help pay the debt my country has owed to France. Go back to the front and save the living.

2500|$|When Mrs. Rodenhurst {{told me of}} {{the advent}} to Shrewsbury of Wainwright, I asked her {{if he was in}} his room, or where. 'No,' she said, 'he went out about an hour ago. I think you'll find him in the King's Arms.' I went to the King's Arms and made my very first {{appearance}} in the bar-parlour of a public-house. The room was empty save for one man, dressed in blue serge, with a shrewd lean face. I recognised him. I had seen him playing for Yorkshire at Old Trafford. I introduced myself. 'I'm the assistant pro.,' I explained. 'Art thou?' he replied, 'well, then 'ave a drink wi' me.' I told him I didn't drink — only ginger ale. 'Christ,' he said, 'tha'rt a reight bloody cricketer.' He was a tall man, who walked as though he didn't care a damn for anybody. There was something sinister about him. Every night he got drunk as a matter of course, quietly and masterfully. One day he backed a winner at a glorious price, and towards eleven o'clock that night he and the drill-sergeant of the school arrived arm-in-arm (supporting one another) in the sitting-room of our lodgings. Very gravely Ted introduced me to the drill-sergeant, whom of course I knew very well. The drill-sergeant as gravely introduced Ted to me, then taking my arm, <b>he</b> <b>whispered</b> rather noisily in my ear, 'I'm 'fraid 'e's a l'il drunk, so I've jus' bror him h-home.'

2500|$|On {{the night}} of 6–7 July, the {{opposing}} forces were so close that besides exchanges of small arms fire, verbal exchanges continued throughout the night. It was at this stage that it became imperative for Indian troops to destroy this Pakistani post, located north of Point 4875, from where enemy fire was coming as otherwise the situation could get worse. At this juncture, the Indian troops detected the enemy presence on a long and narrow ledge, running north from Point 4875. On the ledge, the enemy were holding strong sangars echeloned one behind the other. Batra, who was still recovering from his own wounds he received {{in the battle of}} Point 5140, wanted to reach the top to rescue his fellow soldiers and carry out reconnaissance of the ledge where the enemy soldiers were. [...] "The problem was that the Indian soldiers were caught unawares about the presence of the enemy soldiers on the ledge ahead of Twin Bump. They went ahead into the enemy lines and destroyed their bunkers on 4875 Peak but the firing from the ledge pinned them down," [...] Colonel Joshi said. Even though, It was pitch dark when they had left at night, but even near the top where the soldiers had to climb vertically, visibility was almost zero because of fog. Even worse, it began snowing as they advanced. En route to the top, Batra spotted a Pakistani machine gun position firing at the trapped Indian soldiers. Crouching, he moved toward the machine gun position, hiding behind rocks whenever possible. As he reached close to the enemy's machine gun position he lobbed a grenade, destroying the machine gun position. [...] "Follow me, boys," [...] <b>he</b> <b>whispered</b> in the dark, and they advanced to the next position. At 16,087 feet, even though they were struggling for breath and panting, this did not stop them and they kept advancing non-stop. Before first light on the 7th, the troops succeeded in knocking out two more enemy machine guns, however, firing from the ledge continued. Batra's platoon soon reached the ledge, though by this time it was broad daylight.|$|E
