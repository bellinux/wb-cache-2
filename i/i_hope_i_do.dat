6000|$|... "I mean I didn’t know I was," [...] he replied, [...] "more than usual, I mean. I {{always do}} look fairly cheerful—at least, <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> There’s nothing {{to make me}} look the opposite." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ginger-jub! you gingerly rascal! take that! and {{run along}} with ye to the lockers, and get {{something}} better. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> no wrong, Mr. Starbuck. It is the captain's orders-- grog for the harpooneer on a whale." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will leave}} IT here, sir," [...] replied Richard smiling, [...] "if I brought it here just now (but <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not), and will work my way {{on to my}} cousin Ada in the hopeful distance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Chiefly from {{thinking}} it not right to accept him. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not do wrong in telling her all about it. I thought it only fair, {{and she did}} not care enough for him to make the refusal an effort.' ...|$|R
500|$|Despite the {{way things}} turned out , I'm still proud of those days [...] I feel like I was at the {{forefront}} of the gay liberation movement, and <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> my part to help it move forward. So, I kind of wear the label of 'Bathhouse Betty' with pride.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thou hast {{chosen a}} melancholy hour for thy walk, Signore," [...] said the young Neapolitan; [...] "and a still more melancholy scene. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not intrude on an Israelite, or a Lutheran, who mourns for his friend?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not for {{all that}} time," [...] {{answered}} Basil, smiling. [...] "I have long given up my official position, my dear Philip, and {{have been living in}} a deliberate retirement. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not come at an inopportune moment." ...|$|E
60|$|Approaching {{towards the}} close of {{a long period of}} public service, it is natural I should be desirous to stand well (<b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> stand tolerably well) with that public which, with {{whatever}} fortune, I have endeavored faithfully and zealously to serve.|$|E
5000|$|There {{was little}} meddling {{from the studio}} during the production, though {{executives}} wanted Winters to tone down the latent lesbian aspect of her character. [...] "They didnt want me to play lesbianism too directly, but I did", said Winters. [...] "I guess you could interpret it either way, but I played it very clearly. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> anyway." ...|$|R
50|$|On {{getting her}} start in bathhouses, Midler has remarked:Despite {{the way things}} turned out the AIDS crisis, I'm still proud of those days I got my start singing at the gay bathhouses. I feel like I was at the {{forefront}} of the gay liberation movement, and <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> my part to help it move forward. So, I kind of wear the label of 'Bathhouse Betty' with pride.|$|R
6000|$|... "There was a {{question}} just now, Mr. Jaggers, which you desired me to waive for a moment. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> am <b>doing</b> nothing wrong in asking it again?" ...|$|R
60|$|But we {{must not}} be atheists, as a friend said to me the other day. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not live quite as if I were. But {{it was a great}} shock from the beginning. Henrietta always seemed so strong that I never feared that way.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I know I want {{self-control}} when I {{let myself}} be so engrossed {{in it as}} to neglect other things,' said Anne; 'and <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> manage now not to shew more favour to the girls I like best, than to the others; but in what other way do you mean, Mamma?' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I have fought, too," [...] said Colonel Parsons, {{looking at}} his son with troubled eyes--"I have fought, too, but never with anger in my heart, nor lust of vengeance. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> my duty, but I never forgot that my enemy was a fellow-creature. I never felt joy at killing, but pain and grief. War is inevitable, but it is horrible, horrible! It is only the righteous cause that can excuse it; and then it must be {{tempered}} with mercy and forgiveness." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I see,' said Violet, thoughtfully. 'Oh, <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> shall <b>do</b> right. One thing I should like. I mean, I thought one {{ought to}} set apart {{something}} for giving away.' ...|$|R
5|$|I {{was sitting}} there in the theater at the back, showing it to people for the first time. I mean, it was like a puddle of sweat around my feet. It was like, 'Oh my God, oh my God, <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> the right thing. Oh, that scene is too long. Oh, that's too short. Are they going to get this part? Are they going to like this? Oh, they're going to think it's boring!' Just {{worrying}} the whole way, biting my fingernails off.|$|R
6000|$|Oct. 14, ’64.—So {{ended in}} peace an exhausting, flattering, I [...] hope not intoxicating circuit. God knows I have not courted them. [...] <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not rest on them. I pray I may turn them to account [...] for good. It is, however, {{impossible}} not to love the people from [...] whom such manifestations come, as meet me in every quarter.... Somewhat haunted by dreams of halls, and lines of people, and [...] great assemblies.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not exactly so. I {{mean to tell}} you, Mr. Stryver," [...] said Mr. Lorry, reddening, [...] "that I {{will hear}} no disrespectful word of that young lady from any lips; and that if I knew any man--which <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not--whose taste was so coarse, and whose temper was so overbearing, {{that he could not}} {{restrain}} himself from speaking disrespectfully of that young lady at this desk, not even Tellson's should prevent my giving him a piece of my mind." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I won't, but now I 'm {{not afraid}} {{to tell you that}} I think, <b>I</b> <b>hope,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> believe that Sydney cares a little for me. He 's been very kind to us all, and lately he has seemed to like to see me always when he comes and miss me if I 'm gone. I did n't dare to hope anything, till Papa {{observed}} something in his manner, and teased me about it. I try not to deceive myself, but it does seem as if there was a chance of happiness for me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a infernal machine, sir, an' I ain't sure, even yet, that it won't go off an' blow us all up. He was leanin' down an' bendin' over it, {{twisting}} that dial you see, when on {{a sudden}} I spotted him. I didn't stop to think. My Cap'n {{used to say}} 'Act first an' think afterwards,' an' that's what <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> <b>I</b> didn't know till now it was the school boss, but it wouldn't have made any difference. <b>I</b> <b>done</b> my duty as I saw it, an' <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> it right, Mr. Colton." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{remember}} my first public reading, {{as an undergraduate}} in the early 1960s. It was organized by James McAuley and it consisted of him and me reading our own poems and those of Vivian Smith and Gwen Harwood. Gwen and Vivian were allegedly too shy to read their own. Both, however, were in the audience, and I was acutely aware of their presence as <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> their poems justice. Having got to know Gwen much better in later years, I am amazed {{that she could have}} offered such an excuse." [...] (Thorne, 2003) ...|$|R
60|$|RANKIN. I don't say that. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> have <b>done</b> some good. They {{come to me}} for {{medicine}} when they are ill; and they call me the Christian {{who is not a}} thief. THAT is something.|$|R
6000|$|... "If I cannot legitimize {{our former}} {{relations}} at least I can assist you. And I {{will do it}} with much more regard for your feelings than I formerly showed. My religious mania, or whatever it was, is over. But I retain a little good nature; <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> Now, Tess, by all that's tender and strong between man and woman, trust me! I have enough and {{more than enough to}} put you out of anxiety, both for yourself and your parents and sisters. I can make them all comfortable if you will only show confidence in me." ...|$|E
60|$|My {{father is}} kind, {{in his own}} odd way--and learned, and rich--a more high-minded and honorable man (as I {{have every reason to}} believe) doesn't live. But if you ask me which he prefers, his books or his son, <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> him no {{injustice}} when I answer, his books. His reading and his writing are obstacles between us which I {{have never been able to}} overcome. This is the more to be regretted because he is charming, on the few occasions when I find him disengaged. If you wish I knew more about my father, we are in complete agreement as usual--I wish, too.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of that I am sure, Ulred. The {{citizens}} {{have more to}} lose and better {{know what they are}} fighting for than the country levies, and as you say, I am sure they will do their part stoutly. Well, I must stay here no longer. I shall sleep for two or three hours, and then take a fresh horse from the king's stable and to-morrow shall be at Steyning. By nightfall I shall be on my way back with every man on the estate, a hundred and fifty besides the housecarls, and two days' march will bring us here again. Ulf is well, <b>I</b> <b>hope?</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not see him." ...|$|E
6000|$|I hesitated at first, to promise, but on {{thinking}} {{of the state of}} her mother's health, and how the knowledge of such a thing would fret her, and think too, of how such a story might become distorted, nay, infallibly would, in case it should leak out, I thought it wiser to <b>do</b> so. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> right. <b>I</b> have locked the door, and the key is tied to my wrist, so perhaps I shall not be again disturbed. Lucy is sleeping soundly. The reflex of the dawn is high and far over the sea [...] .|$|R
6000|$|... 'As for patience,' {{she would}} reply with a shrug, 'not much of that, godmother. If I had been patient, I {{should never have}} called him names. But <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> it for his good. And besides, I felt my {{responsibility}} as a mother, so much. I tried reasoning, and reasoning failed. I tried coaxing, and coaxing failed. I tried scolding and scolding failed. But I was bound to try everything, you know, with such a charge upon my hands. Where would have been my duty to my poor lost boy, if I had not tried everything!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't you see, Marian, {{feeling as}} <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> and knowing how {{out of the}} {{question}} it was for a penniless man like me, to think of marrying,--Agnes so young too, and I with everything to draw me to what had been my only home,--there was nothing to be done but to keep out of the way, to guard me against myself; and that was easier with seas between. I don't know whether <b>I</b> <b>did</b> right or not, but <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> because it cost me something; yet it was a forsaking of Gerald which might have <b>done</b> much harm, though <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> it has not, as it has turned out." ...|$|R
6000|$|BEATRICE: 'Tis past! Whatever comes, {{my heart}} shall sink no more. And yet, I know not why, your words strike chill: How tedious, false, and cold seem all things.

I am {{cut off from the}} only world I know, [...] 85 From light, and life, and love, in youth's sweet prime.

60|$|Solomon, {{the royal}} patron of industry, tells us, 'He {{that is a}} lover of pleasure, shall be a poor man.' I must not doubt but Solomon is to be {{understood}} of tradesmen and working men, such as I am writing of, whose time and application is due to their business, and who, in pursuit of their pleasures, are sure to neglect their shops, or employments, and I therefore render the words thus, to the present purpose--'The tradesman that is a lover of pleasure, shall be a poor man.' <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not wrest the Scripture in my interpretation of it; I am sure it agrees with the whole tenor of the wise man's other discourses.|$|E
60|$|He {{would take}} the air there {{presently}} and get an appetite for his hotel dinner. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> old Mr. Turveydrop no wrong, but I never saw any better traits in him than these I faithfully record, except that he certainly conceived a liking for Peepy and {{would take the}} child out walking with great pomp, always on those occasions sending him home {{before he went to}} dinner himself, and occasionally with a halfpenny in his pocket. But even this disinterestedness was attended with no inconsiderable cost, to my knowledge, for before Peepy was sufficiently decorated to walk {{hand in hand with the}} professor of deportment, he had to be newly dressed, at the expense of Caddy and her husband, from top to toe.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> ain’t <b>done</b> nothing wrong," [...] said Mr. Rose, anxiously. [...] "You {{gave me the}} advice; there’s men here as {{can prove}} it. I don’t want to do nothing agin the law. What had I better do?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Singer {{and actress}} Bette Midler became {{recognized}} as a gay icon in the 1970s. After performing on Broadway, Midler began performing at the Continental Baths, a gay bathhouse in the city, where she became close to her piano accompanist Barry Manilow, who produced her first major album The Divine Miss M (1973). [...] "Despite the way things turned out , I'm still proud of those days [...] I feel like I was {{at the forefront of}} the gay liberation movement, and <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> my part to help it move forward. So, I kind of wear the label of 'Bathhouse Betty' with pride," [...] Midler reminisced in 1998.|$|R
40|$|I {{would like}} to express my sincere {{gratitude}} to my supervisor, Leo de Vreede, without whose constant help and patience I {{would not have been}} able to bring this thesis to completion in a successful way. His ideas and knowledge have not just shaped my work, but also had a contribution to my development as an engineer. My heartfelt thanks go also to my supervisor from NXP, Paul Mattheijssen, for offering me this project that turned out to be much more interesting and captivating than I had initially foreseen. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not disappoint them and that they both feel rewarded by the outcome of my work...|$|R
