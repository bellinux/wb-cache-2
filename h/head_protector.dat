40|$|This {{paper was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the journal, Proceedings of the IMechE Part P: Journal of Sports Engineering and Technology. The current British Standard for <b>head</b> <b>protectors</b> for cricketers has been recently revised to include a projectile-based battery of tests, the intention being {{to ensure that a}} certified helmet will also prevent contact of the ball or grille with the specified headform facial region. The {{purpose of this study was}} to characterise the dynamic response of the headform to direct ballistic impacts for alternative headform mounting arrangements. On the one hand, and in accordance with the relevant sections of the Standard, what might be described as a “Constrained” set-up was evaluated while, on the other, an arrangement with significantly reduced stiffness, in line with that previously reported for the passive human neck, was subject to equivalent appraisal. For each mounting scenario, an air cannon was used to project a cricket training ball at three speeds toward the instrumented headform at three locations with five repeats per speed/location combination. High rate/resolution video and piezo-electric accelerometer data were collected and processed to determine the headform response. While differences between specific ball impact speed and location scenarios are set out in detail later in the article, overall observations are summarised as follows. From a ball-headform contact duration standpoint, video derived results showed ranges of 1. 30 – 1. 45 ms (Constrained) vs. 1. 26 – 1. 41 ms. Maximum ball deformations the timing of which enabling the event to be subdivided into “loading” and “unloading” phases, were found to be 82. 5 – 86. 2...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe current British Standard for <b>head</b> <b>protectors</b> for cricketers {{specifies}} a projectile test {{to ensure}} that a helmet can prevent the ball penetrating the peak-grille gap and deformation of the grille onto the face. For practical reasons, it is specified that the headform is mounted onto a grounded frame. This study aims to determine whether this “Fixed” mounting technique influences the response of the headform relative to a theoretically preferable “Free” suspension. A pressurised air cannon was used to project a “BOLA”TM ball at three nominal speeds (22, 25 and 28 m/s) and at three target impact locations (136 (Top), 108 (Middle) and 80 (Bottom) mm from the base). High speed video was used to identify the contact duration and accelerometer data were used to assess the peak resultant headform acceleration and velocity during this period. Generally, good agreement between the two scenarios was found in regard to peak resultant headform acceleration, particularly at the 25 and 28 m/s impact speeds. In terms of headform velocity, the two scenarios showed greater variation when the full contact duration was considered, with root mean square deviations ranging from 1. 77 – 5. 6 in all testing conditions. However, some portions of the impact were considerably more consistent than others. These initial results indicate that the result of the penetration test, as specified in BS 7928 : 2013, would be independent of the suspension technique particularly given the convergence of results at the specified standard velocity (28 m/s). Future work should look to identify the loading and unloading phases of an impact, and use this to compare headform response. Thus allowing a more in-depth investigation of headform mounting performance and provide more clarity {{on the use of the}} Fixed technique in cricket standard tests...|$|R

50|$|In combat sports, {{victory is}} {{obtained}} from blows, punches or attacks {{to the head}} {{to a point of}} physical injury that the opponent is unable to continue. Different forms of combat sport have different rules and regulations into the equipment competitors have to wear. In Amateur boxing seen at the Olympics, competitors are permitted to wear head guards and correctly weighted padded gloves, mouth guards are optional and the canvas floor protection from a hard fall. In sports such as Taekwondo, competitors are permitted to wear a trunk <b>protector,</b> <b>head</b> guard, gloves, groin guard and shin and forearm pads. Professional boxing and UFC are two of the most dangerous combat sports in the world {{due to the lack of}} protective gear worn. Competitors in these two sports have the option to wear a mouthguard and must wear suitable gloves. The lack of protective clothing makes competitors vulnerable to concussion and further traumatic head injuries. A scientific experiment, conducted last year by Dr Andrew McIntosh of ACRISP at the Federation University of Australia, tested the impact of 7 different head guards in combat sport. The results of the experiment revealed the benefits of the combination of a glove and headguard in maximising the impact energy attenuation. A study conducted by Lystad showed that combat sports with little to no protective gear such as MMA or boxing has an injury incidence rate range of 85.1-280.7 per 1000 athletes in comparison to another striking combat sport like Taekwondo which has a large amount of protective gear such as pads, headgear, mouth guard and gloves, has an injury incidence rate range of 19.1-138.8 per 1000 athletes. This means that injury rates are drastically lowered when protective gear is used.|$|R

5000|$|About 400, Germanic peoples {{had already}} conquered great {{parts of the}} Roman provinces in Western Europe. From the north, Salian Franks thrust through the Wetterau to the west. In the {{disagreements}} among the princes of the various Frankish clans, Clovis, a prince of the Merovingian line, rose above others as the victor, making himself autocrat and King of the Franks. In 486, he defeated the last Roman proconsul, thus ending the Roman era in Gaul, and incorporating this into the Frankish kingdom. However, he soon {{found himself in a}} dispute over the newly won land with the Alemanni. In a decisive battle in 506 near Strasbourg, Clovis, ﬁnding himself in the greatest need, vowed to convert to Christianity if only he could be the victor over the Alemanni. He won. Then, together with more than 3,000 warriors, Clovis had himself baptized by the Bishop of Reims, Saint Remigius, and also appointed <b>head</b> and <b>protector</b> of the Frankish Church. A later Frankish king, in the 6th or 7th century - possibly Childebert II sometime between 575 and 590 - brought about the separation of the Remigiusland from the Königsland and its transfer to the Bishopric of Reims, thus making the Abbey of Saint-Remi in Reims the landholder of the Remigiusland, within which lay what is now Herschweiler-Pettersheim’s municipal area, albeit right near the border. The tightly organized Frankish Empire grew bit by bit, particularly under Charlemagne (785-814), into Europe’s greatest power. Eventually in 1024, Conrad II achieved kingship and also the Imperial crown, which the Salians had held for more than 100 years. Besides instituting Counts Palatine or Königsburgen (“King’s Castles”), he divided the empire up into Gaue and hundreds and enfeoffed certain men as counts. The Schloss known to later history has its beginnings as far back as this time. According to the Salm-Kyrburg archivist Georg Friedrich Schott von Pettersheim in his work about the Nahegau, it was built at the beginning of “ﬁst law” (the law of the stronger, or “might makes right”) and was fortiﬁed with walls and moats. Since “ﬁst law” (Faustrecht in German) goes back to the 11th century, and since a Konken parish record says that Count Emrich von Nahegau had owned Kusel and ascribed to his son, Gerlach I, both Kusel and Schloß Pettersheim (the castle/palace in question) in the Vogtei of Remigiusberg in 1030, it can be inferred that the Schloss was built in the 11th century. One of the mightiest Gaue was the Nahegau, to which Herschweiler-Pettersheim belonged. As Vögte, the counts also had the duty of protecting the Remigiusland as an ecclesiastical landhold, but they now sought to take it over for themselves. The opportunity to pass ﬁefs on and thereby become overlords themselves, and the right to bequeath the ﬁef with which they had once been enfeoffed, led to a break between overlord and ﬁefholders, enhancing the counts’ power and independence. This was also so for the comital family of the Emichones, who until 1110 were lords in the Nahegau. When the last Gau Count Emich died, the divisions began: ...|$|R
50|$|The {{senseless}} {{brutality of}} the Sand Creek Massacre on 29 November 1864 brought war to the South Platte River valley, as the Cheyenne, Lakota, and Arapaho retaliated for the attack on a peaceful village of mostly women, children, and old men. On 7 January 1865, a combined force of 1000 warriors attacked the stagecoach station at Julesburg, Colorado, and they continued raiding throughout the South Platte region for several weeks. Young Man Afraid of His Horse emerged as a leading Oglala warrior during these raids. The U.S. Army's construction of forts along the Bozeman Trail beginning in 1866 to protect settlers infuriated the Lakota and Cheyenne, as they {{refused to accept the}} white presence in their prime hunting grounds. The U.S. officials invited the Lakota and Cheyenne leaders to a council at Fort Laramie to obtain right-of-way from the Lakota for the forts and road, but during the conference, a regiment of infantry troops arrived to build Fort Phil Kearny without the Lakota giving their consent. This duplicity enraged Old Man Afraid of His Horse and Red Cloud, and most of the Lakota stormed out of the council in anger. These events precipitated Red Cloud's War of 1866-1868, the only Indian war to end in defeat for the United States. Young Man Afraid of His Horse served as an instrumental war leader during this conflict. He {{played an important role in}} the Lakota victory at the Battle of the Hundred Slain (known as the Fetterman Fight to the whites). At the Wagon Box Fight of 2 August 1867, Young Man Afraid of His Horse served along with Crazy Horse as the leaders of the combined Lakota/Cheyenne war party. In 1868, the multiband Oglala council bestowed one of their highest honors upon Young Man Afraid of His Horse, investing him, along with American Horse, Crazy Horse, and Sword Owner (later George Sword) as the Oglala's four <b>head</b> shirtwearers or <b>protectors</b> of the people. They were the last four head Oglala shirtwearers. In the 1930s, the official interpreter at the Pine Ridge Agency stated that Young Man Afraid of His Horse was the only one of the four who kept his shirt until his death.|$|R
