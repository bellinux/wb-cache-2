40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{determine}} the influence of digital clubbing on oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry measurements (SpO 2) in Cystic Fibrosis patients. BackgroundMeasuring the arterial oxygen saturation at the fingertip by pulse-oximetry is commonly used in the management of CF patients. In these patients, clinical signs of hyperoxia are often observed with oxygen supplies based on digital oximetry readings. This suggests inaccuracies in the digital measurement method, which in its turn may be caused by digital clubbing. In order to study the influence of digital clubbing, measurements between fingertip and forehead sensor were compared in a clubbing and non-clubbing CF-population. The <b>ear</b> <b>sensor</b> measurements are used as a reference variable. MethodsTwo groups were examined. Group 1 consisted of 50 CF patients without digital clubbing (DPD/IPD ratio 1. 00). Patients were measured at rest before any treatment and with their daily oxygen supply, if applicable. Saturation was simultaneously measured with three Criticare SpO 2 T pulse oximeters, using a fingertip sensor at the right index (transmission oximetry), a forehead sensor at the forehead (reflectance oximetry) and an <b>ear</b> <b>sensor</b> at the right ear. ResultsUsing the Bland and Altman method no clear difference was found between the saturation measurements of right ear versus forehead sensor in the two groups. When the measurements of right ear versus fingertip sensor are compared there is still no difference for the non-clubbing group. On the contrary, for the clubbing group lower saturation scores were measured by the fingertip probe compared to the right ear measurement. The differences in saturation became greater as the saturation value at fingertip was lower. ConclusionDigital clubbing significantly influences the registrations of the SpO 2 measurements by means of a fingertip probe, underestimating the saturation. It can be advised to use the <b>ear</b> <b>sensor</b> as good alternative for these patients...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Blood gas {{monitoring}} {{is necessary}} in treatment of critically ill neonates. Whereas SaO 2 can be estimated by pulse oximetry, PaCO 2 is still most often assessed from blood samples. AIM: To compare long time performance of an <b>ear</b> <b>sensor</b> for combined assessment of transcutaneous carbon dioxide (PtcCO 2) and oxygen saturation (SpO 2) (TOSCA Monitor; Radiometer, Switzerland) with a conventional PtcCO 2 monitor (MicroGas 7650 - 500 rapid, Radiometer, Switzerland) in critically ill neonates. METHODS: Prospective, observational study. Twenty critically ill neonates were monitored for PtcCO 2 and SpO 2 using the Tosca and the MicroGas monitor for 24 h. TOSCA <b>ear</b> <b>sensor</b> was changed to the other ear lobe after 12 h and the MicroGas sensor four hourly on the trunk. Values obtained were compared with SaO 2 and PaCO 2 from arterial blood gas analysis using Bland-Altman analysis. Data are presented as median (range). RESULTS: Eighty-two paired measurements were obtained. Median age of the 20 patients was 4. 5 days (1 - 26 days) and weight was 3. 05 kg (0. 98 - 3. 95 kg). Bias and precision between PaCO 2 and PtcCO 2 were 0. 14 and 1. 45 kPa for the Tosca monitor and - 0. 08 and 1. 2 kPa for the MicroGas monitor, respectively. The two biases were significantly different (P = 0. 0036). SpO 2 assessment by TOSCA was comparable to SaO 2 values (bias 0. 26 % and precision 4. 14 %). CONCLUSION: The TOSCA monitor allows safe estimation of PtcCO 2 and SaO 2 in neonates. Measurements of PtcCO 2 were less reliable with TOSCA compared with conventional monitoring but still allow assessing a trend of ventilation status in newborn patients...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{automatically}} predict the onset of farrowing in crate-confined sows. (1) Background: Automatic tools are appropriate to support animal surveillance under practical farming conditions. (2) Methods: In three batches, sows in one farrowing compartment of the Futterkamp research farm were equipped with an <b>ear</b> <b>sensor</b> to sample acceleration. As a reference video, recordings of the sows were used. A classical CUSUM chart using different acceleration indices of various distribution characteristics with several scenarios were compared. (3) Results: The increase of activity mainly due to nest building behavior before the onset of farrowing could be detected with the sow individual CUSUM chart. The best performance required a statistical distribution characteristic that represented fluctuations in the signal (for example, 1 st variation) combined with a transformation of this parameter by cumulating differences in the signal within certain time periods from one day to another. With this transformed signal, farrowing sows could reliably be detected. For 100 % or 85 % of the sows, an alarm was given within 48 or 12 h before the onset of farrowing. (4) Conclusions: Acceleration measurements in the ear of a sow are suitable for detecting the onset of farrowing in individually housed sows in commercial farrowing crates...|$|E
40|$|RATIONALE: To {{date the}} only {{quantifiable}} measure of neural changes that define sleep is electroencephalography (EEG). Although widely used for clinical testing, scalp-electrode EEG is costly and poorly tolerated by sleeping patients. OBJECTIVES: This is {{a pilot study}} to assess the agreement between EEG recordings obtained from a new ear-EEG sensor and those obtained simultaneously from standard scalp electrodes. METHODS: Participants were 4 healthy men, ages 25 to 36 years. During naps, EEG tracings were recorded simultaneously from the <b>ear</b> <b>sensor</b> and standard scalp electrodes. A clinical expert, blinded to the data collection, analyzed 30 -second epochs of recordings from both devices using standardized criteria. The agreement between scalp- and ear-recordings was assessed. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We scored 360 epochs (scalp-EEG and ear-EEG) of which 254 (70. 6 %) were scored as non-rapid-eye movement (NREM) sleep using scalp-EEG. The ear-EEG sensor had a sensitivity of 0. 88 (95 % CI 0. 82 to 0. 92) and specificity of 0. 78 (95 % CI 0. 70 to 0. 84) in detecting N 2 /N 3 sleep. The kappa coefficient, between the scalp- and ear-EEG, was 0. 65 (95 % CI 0. 58 to 0. 73). As a sleep monitor (all NREM sleep stages versus wake), the in-ear sensor had a sensitivity of 0. 91 (95 % CI 0. 87 to 0. 94) and specificity of 0. 66 (95 % CI 0. 56 to 0. 75). The kappa coefficient was 0. 60 (95 % CI 0. 50 to 0. 69).

Studies indicate that music therapy can help reduce problems in this area, in a cost efficient manner. Method: This is an empirical study {{in the tradition of}} quantitative research. The survey was conducted in a district psychiatric centre, DPS, Rogaland, engaged group based teaching mindfulness based Coping, MBC. Thirteen participants, n = 13, distributed by ten women between 24 and 56 years, with an average age of 43. 5 years and three men between 35 and 50 years with an average of 43 years. Stress levels among participants were measured at the pulse frequency and Heart rate variability (HRV). It was measured before, during, and after three different activities 1; playing the hand drum, djembe, 2; dealing cards as a control activity to the physical part of drumming and 3; a stressreducing biofeedback program, emWave on the computer. Each of the 117 measurements were recorded using an <b>ear</b> <b>sensor,</b> and stored in the computer program emWave. Results: Difference in pulse rate measured after drumming and after dealing cards, was p < 0. 07, approaching significance at p < 0. 05 level. This effect can be interpreted as a stress-reducing effect of the rhythmic element in drumming. Non-significant difference in drumming and card dealing, show that the card dealing was a relevant control activity for the physical part of drumming. Stress-reducing effects of drumming compared to the corresponding physical activity without rhythmic / musical element (card dealing), indicates that the effect is due to the music therapy element of drumming. Significant differences where found in both pulse rate (p = 0. 0001) and HRV (p = 0. 0054) for measurements during the activities drumming and biofeedback. The same was also true for measurements during activity card dealing and biofeedback, where the results were p = 0. 0005 for pulse, and p = 0. 0136 for HRV measurements. There were no significant results {{for the rest of the}} measurements. Conclusion: The literature study showed stress-reducing effects of music therapy for patients with stress symptoms. Stress-reducing effects of drumming compared to the corresponding physical activity without rhythmic / musical element (card dealing), indicated that the effect is due to the music therapeutic element in drumming activity. As the effect (p < 0. 07) approaching statistical significance (p < 0. 05) after only one session, there is reason to believe that a significant effect would be obtained in repeated sessions over time...|$|E

40|$|The {{ability to}} monitor dairy cow feeding {{behavior}} and activity could improve dairy herd management. A 3 -dimensional accelerometer (SensOor; Agis Automatisering BV, Harmelen, the Netherlands) {{has been developed}} that can be attached to ear identification tags. Based {{on the principle that}} behavior can be identified by ear movements, a proprietary model classifies sensor data as ‚Äúruminating,‚Äù ‚Äúeating,‚Äù ‚Äúresting,‚Äù or ‚Äúactive. ‚Äù The objective {{of the study was to}} evaluate this sensor on accuracy and precision. First, a pilot evaluation of agreement between 2 independent observers, recording behavior from 3 cows for a period of approximately 9 h each, was performed. Second, to evaluate the sensor, the behavior of 15 cows was monitored both visually (VIS) and with the sensor (SENS), with approximately 20 h of registration per cow, evenly distributed over a 24 -h period, excluding milking. Cows were chosen from groups of animals in different lactation stages and parities. Each minute of SENS and VIS data was classified into 1 of 9 categories (8 behaviors and 1 transition behavior) and summarized into 4 behavioral groups, namely ruminating, eating, resting, or active, which were analyzed by calculating kappa (¬ø) values. For the pilot evaluation, a high level of agreement between observers was obtained, with ¬ø values of = 0. 96 for all behavioral categories, indicating that visual observation provides a good standard. For the second trial, relationships between SENS and VIS were studied by ¬ø values on a minute basis and Pearson correlation and concordance correlation coefficient analysis on behavior expressed as percentage of total registration time. Times spent ruminating, eating, resting, and active were 42. 6, 15. 9, 31. 6, and 9. 9 % (SENS) respectively, and 42. 1, 13. 0, 30. 0, and 14. 9 % (VIS), respectively. Overall ¬ø for the comparison of SENS and VIS was substantial (0. 78), with ¬ø values of 0. 85, 0. 77, 0. 86, and 0. 47 for ‚Äúruminating,‚Äù ‚Äúeating,‚Äù ‚Äúresting,‚Äù and ‚Äúactive,‚Äù respectively. Pearson correlation and concordance correlation coefficients between SENS and VIS for ‚Äúruminating,‚Äù ‚Äúeating,‚Äù ‚Äúresting,‚Äù and ‚Äúactive‚Äù were 0. 93, 0. 88, 0. 98, and 0. 73, and 0. 93, 0. 75, 0. 97, and 0. 35, respectively. In conclusion, the results provide strong evidence that the present <b>ear</b> <b>sensor</b> technology can be used to monitor ruminating and resting behavior of freestall-housed dairy cattle.

Instead of explicitly defining gait features that indicate injury or impairment, an automatic method of feature extraction and selection is proposed.

It was validated on three datasets; the first simulating a leg injury, the second simulating abdominal impairment that could result from surgery or injury and the third is a dataset collected from a patient during recovery from leg injury. The method shows a clear distinction of gait between injured and normal walking.

Otolith number, size and placement are under strict developmental control, but the mechanisms that ensure otolith assembly atop specific cells of the sensory epithelium are unclear. Here we demonstrate that cilia motility is required for normal otolith assembly and localization. Using in vivo video microscopy, we show that motile tether cilia at opposite poles of the otic vesicle create fluid vortices that attract otolith precursor particles, thereby biasing an otherwise random distribution to direct localized otolith seeding on tether cilia. Independent knockdown of subunits for the dynein regulatory complex and outer-arm dynein disrupt cilia motility, leading to defective otolith biogenesis. These results demonstrate a requirement for the dynein regulatory complex in vertebrates and show that cilia-driven flow is a key epigenetic factor in controlling otolith biomineralization...|$|R

In conditions of poor peripheral perfusion such as hypotension, hypothermia, and vasoconstriction, the PPG signals detected are often weak and noisy, {{or in some cases}} unobtainable.

To overcome this limitation, the external auditory canal has been proposed as an alternative monitoring site for estimating SpO 2, on the hypothesis that this central site will be better perfused.

A preliminary in vivo investigation on seven healthy volunteers has revealed that good quality PPG signals with high amplitude can be obtained from the posterior surface of the outer ear canal. Based on these observations, a second prototype probe suitable for acquisition of PPGs from the posterior surface of the outer ear canal was developed. A pilot study was then carried out on 15 healthy volunteers to validate the feasibility of measuring PPGs and SpO 2 from the ear canal in conditions of induced local peripheral vasoconstriction (right hand immersion in ice water). The PPG signals acquired from the ear canal probe were compared with those obtained simultaneously from finger probes attached to {{the left and the right}} index fingers. Significant drop (p 45 %) and right (> 50 %) index fingers during the ice water immersion, while good quality PPG signals with relatively constant amplitude were obtained from the ear canal. Also, the SpO 2 values showed that the ear canal pulse oximeter performed better than the two finger pulse oximeters (mean failure rate 30 %). A second in vivo investigation was carried out in 15 healthy volunteers, where hypoperfusion was induced more naturally by exposing the volunteer to cold temperatures of 10 C for 10 min. Normalised Pulse Amplitude (NPA) and SpO 2 was calculated from the PPG signals acquired from the ear canal, the finger and the earlobe. By the end of the cold exposure, a mean drop of > 80 % was found in the NPA of finger PPGs. The % drop in the NPA of red and infrared earlobe PPG signals was 20 % and 26 % respectively.

The subjects performed the protocol twice: with and without face-wind from halfway through the 30 ¬∞C rest period. Extra auricle insulation was applied at one side. Ambient temperature changes affected Tac significantly, while Tes and Tre remained stable. Insulating the auricle reduced but did not abolish this effect. Wind had an immediate cooling effect on Tac independent of auricle insulation. During exercise and recovery in 30 ¬∞C, Tac provided acceptable group predictions of Tre in trials without wind (bias: - 0. 66 0. 21 ¬∞C covered, - 1. 20 0. 15 ¬∞C uncovered).

The results indicate a good agreement between ear lobe PCO 2 and arterial PCO 2 in the range 35 to 70 mmHg (10 patients, number of measurements 104, regression line TcPCO 2 = 1. 01 PaCO 2 + 0. 59 mmHg, bias 1. 22 mmHg, SD 3. 69 mmHg) and between ear lobe SpO 2 and SaO 2 (bias 0. 44 % with SD 0. 77 % in the range 80 % to 100 %, bias 1. 39 % with SD 1. 43 % in the range 60 % to 80 %). The <b>ear</b> lobe OxiCarbog <b>sensor</b> detects the SpO 2 change 5 to 37 sec faster than a finger sensor and the PCO 2 change 9 to 48 sec faster than a transcutaneous sensor fixed at the upper arm. Further improvements versus single sensors are a higher stability of the SpO 2 signal {{and the possibility of}} performing long term SpO 2 and PCO 2 measurement at the ear lobe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The semicircular canals, a {{subdivision}} of the vestibular {{system of the}} vertebrate inner <b>ear,</b> function as <b>sensors</b> of angular acceleration. Little is currently known, however, regarding the underlying molecular mechanisms that govern {{the development of this}} intricate structure. Zebrafish represent a particularly tractable model system for the study of inner ear development. This is because the ear can be easily visualized during early embryogenesis, and both forward and reverse genetic techniques are available that {{can be applied to the}} discovery of novel genes that contribute to proper ear development. We have previously shown that in zebrafish, the calcium sensing molecule neuronal calcium sensor- 1 (NCS- 1) is required for semicircular canal formation. The function of NCS- 1 in regulating semicircular canal formation has not yet been elucidated. Results We initiated a multistep functional proteomic strategy to identify neuronal calcium sensor- 1 (NCS- 1) binding partners (NBPs) that contribute to inner ear development in zebrafish. By performing a Y 2 H screen in combination with literature and database searches, we identified 10 human NBPs. BLAST searches of the zebrafish EST and genomic databases allowed us to clone zebrafish orthologs of each of the human NBPs. By investigating the expression profiles of zebrafish NBP mRNAs, we identified seven that were expressed in the developing inner ear and overlapped with the ncs- 1 a expression profile. GST pulldown experiments confirmed that selected NBPs interacted with NCS- 1, while morpholino-mediated knockdown experiments demonstrated an essential role for arf 1, pi 4 kŒ≤, dan, and pink 1 in semicircular canal formation. Conclusion Based on their functional profiles, the hypothesis is presented that Ncs- 1 a/Pi 4 kŒ≤/Arf 1 form a signaling pathway that regulates secretion of molecular components, including Dan and Bmp 4, that are required for development of the vestibular apparatus. A second set of NBPs, consisting of Pink 1, Hint 2, and Slc 25 a 25, are destined for localization in mitochondria. Our findings reveal a novel signalling pathway involved in development of the semicircular canal system, and suggest a previously unrecognized role for NCS- 1 in mitochondrial function via its association with several mitochondrial proteins. </p...|$|R
