25|$|The great {{majority}} of phosgene {{is used in the}} production of isocyanates, the most important being toluene <b>diisocyanate</b> (TDI) and methylene diphenyl <b>diisocyanate</b> (MDI). These two isocyanates are precursors to polyurethanes.|$|E
25|$|Aliphatic and cycloaliphatic {{isocyanates}} {{are used}} in smaller quantities, most often in coatings and other applications where color and transparency are important since polyurethanes made with aromatic isocyanates tend to darken on exposure to light. The most important aliphatic and cycloaliphatic isocyanates are 1,6-hexamethylene <b>diisocyanate</b> (HDI), 1-isocyanato-3-isocyanatomethyl-3,5,5-trimethyl-cyclohexane (isophorone <b>diisocyanate,</b> IPDI), and 4,4′-diisocyanato dicyclohexylmethane, (H12MDI or hydrogenated MDI).|$|E

25|$|Formaldehyde is {{a common}} {{precursor}} to more complex compounds and materials. In approximate order of decreasing consumption, products generated from formaldehyde include urea formaldehyde resin, melamine resin, phenol formaldehyde resin, polyoxymethylene plastics, 1,4-butanediol, and methylene diphenyl <b>diisocyanate.</b> The textile industry uses formaldehyde-based resins as finishers to make fabrics crease-resistant. Formaldehyde-based materials are key to the manufacture of automobiles, and used to make components for the transmission, electrical system, engine block, door panels, axles and brake shoes. The value of sales of formaldehyde and derivative products was over $145 billion in 2003, about 1.2% {{of the gross domestic}} product (GDP) of the United States and Canada. Including indirect employment, over 4 million people work in the formaldehyde industry across approximately 11,900 plants in the U.S. and Canada.|$|E
25|$|Of all aldehydes, {{formaldehyde}} {{is produced}} on the largest scale, about 6,000,000 tons per year. It is mainly {{used in the}} production of resins when combined with urea, melamine, and phenol (e.g., Bakelite). It is a precursor to methylene diphenyl <b>diisocyanate</b> ("MDI"), a precursor to polyurethanes. The second main aldehyde is butyraldehyde, of which about 2,500,000 tons per year are prepared by hydroformylation. It is the principal precursor to 2-ethylhexanol, which is used as a plasticizer. Acetaldehyde once was a dominating product, but production levels have declined to less than 1,000,000 tons per year because it mainly served as a precursor to acetic acid, which is now prepared by carbonylation of methanol. Many other aldehydes find commercial applications, often as precursors to alcohols, the so-called oxo alcohols, which are used in detergents. Some aldehydes are produced only on a small scale (less than 1000 tons per year) and are famously used as ingredients in flavours and perfumes such as N°5 from CHANEL. These include cinnamaldehyde and its derivatives, citral, and lilial.|$|E
40|$|International audienceFatty acid {{derivatives}} {{have been}} successfully transformed into <b>diisocyanates</b> via a non-phosgene and green method. The structure of these novel <b>diisocyanates</b> was confirmed through FTIR and H- 1 NMR spectroscopies. These <b>diisocyanates</b> were reacted with commercially available and fatty acid based diols to obtain partially and fully bio-based polyurethanes respectively. The selected diols were of various structural features: with linear methylene spacers from 3 to 12 units, with sulfur-containing unit, ester linkages or cyclo-aliphatic units. The polyurethanes obtained were thoroughly characterized by FTIR, H- 1 NMR spectroscopy, SEC studies, DSC and TGA experiments. Most of the polyurethanes were semi-crystalline in nature with well-identified melting transitions. However, due to plasticization and/or conformational issues, insertion of methylene dangling chains or cyclic moieties imparted amorphous feature to the polyurethanes. The polyurethanes displayed fair thermal stability with no significant weight loss below 235 degrees C...|$|R

The new polymers had some advantages over existing plastics that were made by polymerizing olefins or by polycondensation, and were not covered by patents obtained by Wallace Carothers on polyesters. Early work focused on the production of fibres and flexible foams and PUs were applied on a limited scale as aircraft coating during World War II. Polyisocyanates became commercially available in 1952, and production of flexible polyurethane foam began in 1954 using toluene <b>diisocyanate</b> (TDI) and polyester polyols.

2500|$|In 1956 DuPont {{introduced}} polyether polyols, specifically poly(tetramethylene ether) glycol, and BASF and Dow Chemical {{started selling}} polyalkylene glycols in 1957.

2500|$|Hydrogenation is {{a useful}} means for {{converting}} unsaturated compounds into saturated derivatives. [...] Substrates include not only alkenes and alkynes, but also aldehydes, imines, and nitriles, which are converted into the corresponding saturated compounds, i.e. alcohols and amines. [...] Thus, alkyl aldehydes, which can be synthesized with the oxo process from carbon monoxide and an alkene, {{can be converted to}} alcohols. E.g. 1-propanol is produced from propionaldehyde, produced from ethene and carbon monoxide. Xylitol, a polyol, is produced by hydrogenation of the sugar xylose, an aldehyde. Primary amines can be synthesized by hydrogenation of nitriles, while nitriles are readily synthesized from cyanide and a suitable electrophile. For example, isophorone diamine, a precursor to the polyurethane monomer isophorone <b>diisocyanate,</b> is produced from isophorone nitrile by a tandem nitrile hydrogenation/reductive amination by ammonia, wherein hydrogenation converts both the nitrile into an amine and the imine formed from the aldehyde and ammonia into another amine.|$|E
