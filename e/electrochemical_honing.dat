40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comparative analysis of process performance of micro-grinding and <b>electrochemical</b> <b>honing,</b> {{with the aim}} to achieve higher precision and surface quality of rebuild surfaces of the engine valve face. The discarded engine valve face was rebuilt using plasma transferred arc cladding technique and its surface finish was evaluated in terms of average roughness and maximum roughness value.

A significant improvement of 23. 37 % in the average surface roughness value was found after ECH as compared with the micro-grinding...|$|E
40|$|Surface {{characteristics}} of gears affect the various performance {{characteristics of}} the gears such as load carrying capacity, service life, operating performance, wear characteristics, transmission characteristics and noise generation characteristics. Surface characteristics of a gear have two major components namely (i) surface quality which includes surface finish, micro-geometry (i. e. form and location errors), tooth flank topology and wear characteristics; and (ii) surface integrity aspects which includes microstructure, microhardness and residual stresses.

The aim of the study is to investigate the optimization of processing parameters in order to enhance the surface micro-finish and geometrical accuracy of the recovered functional surfaces made of SS 316 material using a newly developed <b>electrochemical</b> <b>honing</b> (ECH) machine. ECH is a prominent hybrid machining process, which is widely used for precision finishing of intricate shapes and hard materials with an efficient and effective manner. In this work, discarded functional surface of the cylindrical shafts is recovered using twin wire arc (TWA) technique and its surface topography was studied using developed micro-finish machine.

Percentage improvement in average surface roughness PIRa and maximum surface roughness PIRtm, three-dimensional plots of the finished surface texture, and microhardness have been used as the measures of ECH process performance. The effects of finishing time, electrolyte temperature, and elec-trolyte composition have been studied through pilot experiments by varying one variable at a time, while the effects of voltage, rotating speed of the workpiece gear, and electrolyte con-centration have been studied during the main experiments designed using the Box–Behnken response surface methodology approach. Scanning electron microscopy and optical profilom-etry before and after ECH have been used to highlight the improvement in surface quality of helical gears.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{development of}} theoretical models of volumetric {{material removal rate}} (MRR) and surface roughness depth (Rz) of straight bevel gears finished by pulse <b>electrochemical</b> <b>honing</b> (PECH) process {{in terms of the}} most influencing parameters namely applied voltage, pulse-on time, pulse-off time, finishing time, inter-electrode gap, electrolyte conductivity and workpiece gear rotary speed. Equations for computing flank surface area of gear tooth flank surfaces in terms geometric parameters of involute profile of straight bevel gears were also developed. The developed models were validated by conducting twelve experiments using one-factor-at-a-time approach and varying applied voltage, pulse-on time and pulse-off time each at four levels. Values and trends of variation of volumetric MRR and surface roughness depth predicted by the proposed models have shown very close agreement with corresponding experimental values and their trends. Minimum prediction errors for the proposed models were found to be − 3. 3 % and 1 % for volumetric MRR and surface roughness depth respectively. Models and validation results have also revealed the existence of optimum ranges of voltage, pulse-on time and pulse-off time to optimize volumetric MRR and depth of surface roughness. Analysis of different aspects of surface quality (i. e. surface finish, material ratio curve, micro-geometry, tooth flank topology) and surface integrity (i. e. microstructure and micro-hardness) of the best-finished gear have shown considerable improvements in them...|$|E
