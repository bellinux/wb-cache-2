50|$|The ISO/TC37 {{standards}} are currently elaborated as high level specifications {{and deal with}} word segmentation (ISO 24614), annotations (ISO 24611 a.k.a. MAF, ISO 24612 a.k.a. LAF, ISO 24615 a.k.a. SynAF, and ISO 24617-1 a.k.a. SemAF/Time), feature structures (ISO 24610), multimedia containers (ISO 24616 a.k.a. MLIF), and lexicons (ISO 24613).These {{standards are}} based on low level specifications dedicated to constants, namely data categories (revision of <b>ISO</b> 12620), language <b>codes</b> (<b>ISO</b> 639), scripts <b>codes</b> (<b>ISO</b> 15924), <b>country</b> <b>codes</b> (<b>ISO</b> 3166) and Unicode (ISO 10646).|$|R
50|$|XX: {{represents}} the two letter <b>ISO</b> <b>country</b> <b>code</b> or <b>ISO</b> 3166-1 alpha-2 <b>code</b> (e.g. AU for Australia, US for United States, NZ for New Zealand, GB for United Kingdom).|$|R

40|$|Data {{shown for}} OECD and OECD EU are simple averages of {{countries}} displayed in each chart {{for the two}} areas. Each chart specifies the period covered. The mention XXXX or latest available year (where XXXX is a year or a period) means that data for later years are not taken into account. For all charts, <b>ISO</b> <b>codes</b> for <b>countries</b> are use...|$|R
50|$|Croatia uses five-digit {{postal code}} numbers. The Croatian postal service {{recommends}} using 2-letter <b>ISO</b> <b>country</b> <b>codes</b> as prefixes before {{international and domestic}} postal codes, though the practice is not mandatory.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>country</b> <b>codes</b> {{are unique}} to each {{particular}} country, but do not correlate to <b>ISO</b> <b>Country</b> <b>Codes</b> or other standards format. For example, in the system used until 2007, France is [...] "DJ" [...] rather than [...] "F", and Australia is [...] "XZ" [...] rather than [...] "AUS".|$|R
30|$|The dataset {{used for}} the {{analysis}} is retrieved from the February, 2016 edition OECD patent database (OECD 2017). In addition, <b>ISO</b> <b>country</b> <b>codes</b> from the OECD REGPAT database (Maraut et al. 2008) are used to sort out patent families by country.|$|R
5000|$|However, {{although}} Suid-Afrika ("South Africa") {{is used in}} Afrikaans {{rather than}} Zuid-Afrika as in Dutch, South Africa adopted [...] "ZA" [...] as its international vehicle registration code in 1936, which later became the <b>country's</b> <b>ISO</b> <b>country</b> <b>code,</b> with [...]za becoming the country's internet domain.|$|R
5000|$|The use of {{an initial}} letter [...] "X" [...] for these {{purposes}} is facilitated by the ISO 3166 rule that no official <b>country</b> <b>code</b> beginning with X will ever be assigned. Because of this rule ISO 4217 can use X codes without risk of clashing with a future <b>country</b> <b>code.</b> <b>ISO</b> 3166 <b>country</b> <b>codes</b> beginning with [...] "X" [...] are used for private custom use (reserved), never for official codes. For instance, the <b>ISO</b> 3166-based NATO <b>country</b> <b>codes</b> (STANAG 1059, 9th edition) use [...] "X" [...] codes for imaginary exercise countries ranging from XXB for [...] "Brownland" [...] to XXR for [...] "Redland", {{as well as for}} major commands such as XXE for SHAPE or XXS for SACLANT. Consequently, ISO 4217 can use [...] "X" [...] codes for non-country-specific currencies without risk of clashing with future <b>country</b> <b>codes.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The <b>country</b> <b>codes</b> {{are unique}} to each {{particular}} country, but do not correlate to <b>ISO</b> <b>Country</b> <b>Codes</b> or other standards format. For example, in the old system used until 2007, France is [...] "DJ" [...] not [...] "F" [...] and Australia is [...] "XZ" [...] not [...] "AUS". This is to prevent the general public from targeting diplomats from particular countries.|$|R

50|$|The islands {{were given}} the <b>ISO</b> <b>country</b> <b>codes</b> of PU (alpha-2), PUS (alpha-3), and 849 (numeric) before 1986 (now PUUM), and the FIPS <b>country</b> <b>code</b> of IQ before 1981. For ISO purposes, the islands are now defined {{as part of the}} United States Minor Outlying Islands, {{together}} with Johnston Atoll, Midway Atoll, Navassa Island, and Wake Island, while each island is now given a separate FIPS code.|$|R
2500|$|The kk {{after the}} two-character <b>ISO</b> <b>country</b> <b>code</b> {{represents}} the check digits {{calculated from the}} rest of the IBAN characters. If it is a constant for the country concerned, this will be stated in the Comments column. This happens where the BBAN has its own check digits that use the same algorithm as the IBAN check digits ...|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} tables {{attempt to}} provide {{a complete list of}} mobile network operators. Country information, including <b>ISO</b> 3166-1 <b>country</b> <b>codes</b> is provided for completeness. Mostly for historical reasons, one E.212 MCC may correspond to multiple <b>ISO</b> <b>country</b> <b>codes</b> (e.g. MCC 362 corresponds to BQ, CW, and SX). Some operators also choose to use an MCC outside the geographic area that it was assigned to (e.g. Digicel uses the Jamaica MCC throughout the Caribbean). ITU-T publishes an official list of mobile network codes {{from time to time in}} the Operational Bulletin. Unfortunately, the official list is often incomplete as national MNC Authorities do not forward changes to the ITU in a timely manner. The official list does not provide additional details such as bands and technologies and may not list disputed territories such as Abkhazia or Kosovo.|$|R
2500|$|The {{traditional}} <b>country</b> <b>code</b> {{top-level domain}} (ccTLD) for Russia, {{based on the}} <b>ISO</b> <b>country</b> <b>codes,</b> is [...] There is no direct mapping of subdomains between рф and , they are independent domains hosting potentially different resources. However, many resources may use URL redirection or DNS pointers to provide mapping between the name spaces. For example, the URLs [...] (prezident.rf) and [...] point to the identical resource, and [...] (Yandex) redirects to [...]|$|R
5000|$|After {{the use of}} UK.COM other <b>ISO</b> <b>Country</b> <b>codes</b> {{ending in}} [...]COM were also {{established}} such as AU.COM (Australia) and HK.COM (Hong Kong) and many other countries. In 2011, CentralNic established the <b>country</b> <b>code</b> second-level domain [...]COM.DE. Even though that domain {{is very similar to}} official ccSLDs, like COM.AU or COM.PL, it has no official status since it is not operated by Denic, the official registry service provider of [...]DE domains.|$|R

25|$|The ruble is the {{currency}} of Transnistria and is divided into 100 kopecks. Since Transnistria is a state with limited international recognition and considered as part of Moldova, its currency has no <b>ISO</b> 4217 <b>code.</b> However, unofficially some Transnistrian organisations such as Agroprombank and Gazprombank used the code PRB, a code {{that would otherwise be}} reserved for Puerto Rico (<b>ISO</b> 3166-1 <b>country</b> <b>code</b> PR). The Trans-Dniester Republican Bank sometimes uses the code RUP.|$|R
50|$|The channel was {{originally}} known as Kanaal 2, however, it has undergone several rebrandings over the years. At launch in 1995, the channel was branded as Ka2 (Dutch pronunciation of K2), then Kanaal 2. In 2001 it was branded KANAALTWEE. On February 12, 2008, the channel {{changed its name}} to 2BE, retaining the 2 but referring to the Belgian <b>ISO</b> <b>Country</b> <b>Code</b> BE.|$|R

5000|$|In {{deference}} to the PRC's position, the United Nations officially refers to the Taiwan Area as [...] "Taiwan, Province of China". This has also meant that [...] "Taiwan, Province of China" [...] appears {{in the list of}} <b>ISO</b> 3166-1 <b>country</b> <b>codes.</b> A variant of this name is [...] "Taiwan, China", which is also often seen in other contexts.|$|R
5000|$|The nic.at GmbH, {{based in}} Salzburg, is the domain name {{registry}} for the top-level domain of [...]at. AT is the <b>ISO</b> 3166 <b>country</b> <b>code</b> for Austria. Nic.at is 100% owned by the [...] and employs about 30 people. Since 1988, when the responsibility was still at the University of Vienna Domains for [...]at have been registered at will.|$|R
50|$|The {{temporary}} reassignment of <b>country</b> <b>code</b> cs (Serbia and Montenegro) {{until its}} split into rs and me (Serbia and Montenegro, respectively) {{led to some}} controversies about the stability of <b>ISO</b> 3166-1 <b>country</b> <b>codes,</b> resulting in a second edition of ISO 3166-1 in 2007 with a guarantee that retired codes will not be reassigned for at least 50 years, and the replacement of RFC 3066 by RFC 4646 for <b>country</b> <b>codes</b> used in language tags in 2006.|$|R
5000|$|In October 1984, RFC 920 {{set out the}} {{creation}} of ccTLDs generally using <b>country</b> <b>codes</b> derived from the corresponding two-letter <b>code</b> in the <b>ISO</b> 3166-1 list. GB is the UK's <b>ISO</b> 3166 <b>country</b> <b>code.</b> However, the [...]uk domain had been created separately {{a few months before}} the compilation of the ISO-derived list. Consequently, [...]gb was never widely used and it is no longer possible to register under that domain.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>ISO</b> 4217 {{currency}} <b>code</b> is GBP. Occasionally, the abbreviation [...] "UKP" [...] is used {{but this}} is non-standard because the <b>ISO</b> 3166 <b>country</b> <b>code</b> for the United Kingdom is GB (see Terminology of the British Isles). The Crown dependencies use their own (non-ISO) codes: GGP (Guernsey pound), JEP (Jersey pound) and IMP (Isle of Man pound). Stocks are often traded in pence, so traders may refer to pence sterling, GBX (sometimes GBp), when listing stock prices.|$|R
2500|$|The term [...] "Taiwan, Province of China" [...] {{also appears}} in the International Organization for Standardization's <b>ISO</b> 3166-1 <b>country</b> <b>codes</b> because its {{information}} source, the publication UN Terminology Bulletin-Country Names, lists Taiwan as [...] "Taiwan, Province of China" [...] due to the PRC's political influence in the United Nations {{as a member of}} the UN Security Council. Since the <b>ISO</b> 3166-1 <b>code</b> is commonly used as the data source for a complete list of country and territory names for computer programs and websites, [...] "Taiwan, Province of China" [...] is sometimes seen on dropdown menus instead of [...] "Taiwan" [...] for this reason.|$|R
5000|$|An example CID/HID {{might appear}} as [...] "GB-ABC00042-A3-99", where [...] "GB" [...] is the <b>ISO</b> 3166-1 <b>country</b> <b>code,</b> [...] "ABC" [...] {{would be the}} Acme Boat Company's Manufacturer Identity Code (MIC); [...] "00042" [...] would be the forty-second hull {{constructed}} by the organisation; [...] "A3" [...] would be January 2013 for the date keel was laid to the nearest month and [...] "99" [...] denoted as the year 1999 as the particular model/specification number.

5000|$|The ISO Conformant Full Duplex type has the {{greatest}} international acceptance. It is common in many countries including Europe (since the late 1990s) and Canada. It {{is one of two}} chip protocol types (along with the [...] "Half Duplex" [...] type sometimes used in farm and ranch animals) that conform to International Organization for Standardization standards ISO 11784 & 11785. To support international/multivendor application, the 3-digit <b>country</b> <b>code</b> can contain an assigned <b>ISO</b> <b>country</b> <b>code</b> or a manufacturer code from 900 to 998 plus its identifying serial number.
