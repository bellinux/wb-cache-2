40|$|Abstract—Traditional {{application}} execution assumes an error-free execution {{hardware and}} environment. Such guarantees in execution are achieved by providing <b>guardbands</b> {{in the design}} of microelectronic processors. In reality, applications exhibit varying degrees of tolerance to error in computations. This paper proposes an adaptive <b>guardbanding</b> technique to combat CMOS variability for error-tolerant (probabilistic) applications as well as traditional error-intolerant applications. The proposed technique leverages a combination of accurate design time analysis and a minimally intrusive runtime technique to mitigate Process, Voltage, and Temperature (PVT) variations for a near-zero area overhead. We demonstrate our approach on a 32 -bit in-order RISC processor with full post Placement and Routing (P&R) layout results in TSMC 45 nm technology. The adaptive <b>guardbanding</b> technique eliminates traditional <b>guardbands</b> on operating frequency using information from PVT variations and application-specific requirements on computational accuracy. For error-intolerant applications, we introduce the notion of Sequence-Level Vulnerability (SLV) that utilizes circuit-level vulnerability for constructing high-level software knowledge as metadata. In effect, the SLV metadata partitions sequences of integer SPARC instructions into two equivalence classes to enable the adaptive <b>guardbanding</b> technique to adapt the frequency simultaneously for dynamic voltage and temperature variations, as well as adapt to the different classes of the instruction sequences. The proposed technique achieves on an average 1. 6 × speedup for error-intolerant applications compared to recent work [33]. For probabilistic applications, the adaptive technique guarantees the error-free operation of a set of paths of the processor that always require correct timing (Vulnerable Paths) while reducing the cost of <b>guardbanding</b> {{for the rest of the}} path...|$|R
40|$|Bias Temperature Instability (BTI) and Hot Carrier Injection (HCI) are {{two major}} causes for {{transistor}} aging at nano-scale, leading to slower devices, more failures during runtime, and ultimately reduced lifetime. Typically these issues are handled by adding extra <b>guardbands</b> to the design, i. e. overdesign, which results in lower clock frequencies and hence, performance losses. Alternatively, efficient aging mitigation techniques {{can be used to}} relax such <b>guardbands.</b> In this paper we explore various clock and power gating techniques for BTI and HCI aging mitigation at microarchitecture-level for superscalar processors. This is done with the help of our aging-aware microarchitectural framework ExtraTime, which includes a cycle-accurate performance simulator together with microarchitectural models to estimate power consumption, temperature, and particularly aging. The simulation results show that using an aging-optimized combination of clock and power gating, aging (delay) of the execution units of a 32 nm superscalar microprocessor due to BTI can be reduced by 30 % while aging due to HCI is mitigated by 70 %. This is achieved with only 2 % reduction in performance (IPC). This gives one the possibility to either extend the lifetime by 3 times, or reduce the <b>guardbands.</b> ...|$|R

50|$|A more {{detailed}} {{understanding of how}} the rate of 1.544 Mbit/s was divided into channels is as follows. (This explanation glosses over T1 voice communications, and deals mainly with the numbers involved.) Given that the telephone system nominal voiceband (including <b>guardband)</b> is 4,000 Hz, the required digital sampling rate is 8,000 Hz (see Nyquist rate). Since each T1 frame contains 1 byte of voice data for each of the 24 channels, that system needs then 8,000 frames per second to maintain those 24 simultaneous voice channels. Because each frame of a T1 is 193 bits in length (24 channels × 8 bits per channel + 1 framing bit = 193 bits), 8,000 frames per second is multiplied by 193 bits to yield a transfer rate of 1.544 Mbit/s (8,000 × 193 = 1,544,000).|$|E

Consequently, designs are required to build in substantial <b>guardbands</b> in order to guarantee reliable operation over the lifetime of a chip, and these involve large area and power overheads. In this paper, we begin by proposing the use of adaptive body bias (ABB) and adaptive supply voltage (ASV) to maintain optimal performance of an aged circuit, and demonstrate its advantages over a <b>guardbanding</b> technique such as synthesis.

40|$|Quality {{and value}} of an IC product are {{functions}} of power, performance, area, cost and reliability. The forthcoming 2013 ITRS roadmap observes that while manufacturers continue to enable potential Moore’s Law scaling of layout densities, the “realizable ” scaling in competitive products has for some years been significantly less. In this paper, we consider aspects of the question, “To what extent should this scaling gap be blamed on lithography? ” Non-ideal scaling of layout densities {{has been attributed to}} (i) layout restrictions associated with multi-patterning technologies (SADP, LELE, LELELE), as well as (ii) various ground rule and layout style choices that stem from misalignment, reliability, variability, device architecture, and electrical performance vs. power constraints. Certain impacts seem obvious, e. g., loss of 2 D flexibility and new line-end placement constraints with SADP, or algorithmically intractable layout stitching and mask coloring formulations with LELELE. However, these impacts may well be outweighed by weaknesses in design methodology and tooling. Arguably, the industry has entered a new era in which many new factors – (i) standard-cell library architecture, and layout <b>guardbanding</b> for automated place-and-route; (ii) performance model <b>guardbanding</b> and signoff analyses; (iii) physical design and manufacturing handoff algorithms spanning detailed placement and routing, stitching and RET; and (iv) reliability <b>guardbanding</b> – all contribute, hand in hand with lithography, to a newly-identified “design capability gap”.

50|$|Frequency {{arrangements}} of the US band {{plan and the}} APT band plan substantially overlap thus making them largely incompatible. The 3GPP has designated five operating bands for the US band plan (Bands 12, 13, 14, 17, 29) and two bands for the APT band plan (Band 28 for FDD version and Band 44 for TDD version). There are distinct differences among the operating bands such as different channel bandwidths and channel locations within the 700 MHz band. More specifically, duplex spacing and <b>guardband</b> peculiarities of the APT band plan is what differentiates it most. US band plan, in its turn, {{is characterized by a}} number of inconsistencies: i) non-existence of in-band interoperability (i.e. devices working in band 13 are not compatible with devices working with in either of the bands 12, 14, 17); ii) harmful interference from TV channels; iii) absence of user equipment in Band 12 (it is also not likely to appear in the future)12/1/2014: Band 12 equipment is already available; iv) no current use of the D and E blocks in {{the lower part of the}} 700 MHz band (there is a 12 MHz TDD frequency block); and some other issues. As a result of these peculiarities of segmentation, block A of the lower 700 MHz band is practically not used due to interference from TV Channel 51. Out of the total of 23x2 MHz of spectrum owned and used by AT&T and Verizon, 3x2 MHz cannot be used due to limitations by LTE technology standards - only blocks of 5, 10, 15, 20 MHz can be used according to 3GPP industry standards.|$|E

As more devices in a given area are packed into orthogonal wireless channels, choosing the right <b>guardband</b> size to minimize cross-channel interference becomes critical to network performance. Using both WiFi and GNU radio experiments, we show that the traditional “one-size-fits-all” approach to <b>guardband</b> assignment is ineffective, and can produce throughput degradation up to 80 %. We find that ideal <b>guardband</b> values vary across different network configurations, and across different links in the same network. We argue that <b>guardband</b> values should be set based on network conditions and adapt to changes over time. We propose Ganache, an intelligent <b>guardband</b> configuration system that dynamically sets and adapts guardbands based on local topology and propagation conditions. Ganache includes three key mechanisms: an empirical model of <b>guardband</b> sizes based on power heterogeneity of adjacent links, network-wide frequency and <b>guardband</b> assignment, and local <b>guardband</b> adaptation triggered by realtime detection of cross-band interference. We deploy a Ganache prototype on a local 8 -node GNU radio testbed.

Our work gives the first-ever quantification {{of the impact of}} modeling <b>guardband</b> reduction on outcomes from the synthesis, place and route (SP&R) implementation flow.

Our experimental data clearly shows the potential design quality and turnaround time benefits of model <b>guardband</b> reduction. For example, we typically (i. e., on average) observe 13 % standard-cell area reduction and 12 % routed wirelength reduction as the consequence of a 40 % reduction in library model guardband; 40 % is the amount of <b>guardband</b> reduction reported by IBM for a variation-aware timing methodology [8]. We also assess the impact of <b>guardband</b> reduction on design yield.
