40|$|Development {{programs}} recommend fattening of pigs aged between 1 and 2 {{years by}} supplementing their local diet with industrial cereal bran, to improve womens' income. At the best moment {{to start this}} activity, just after the rainy season, high demand for these pigs induced higher prices and low margins. The start after the rainy season does not fit in the existing production system as farmers sell their surplus pigs {{before and during the}} rainy season. Traditional pig fattening lasts 3 years. About 60 women in 8 villages tested <b>early</b> <b>fattening</b> of young piglets. Piglets of the treatment were supplemented with a special concentrate and showed higher daily weight gains compared to the traditionally fed group. The gross margin of the <b>early</b> <b>fattening</b> was equal to the recommended pig fattening, but the first solved problems related to availability of piglets and thus fits better in the existing production system. Almost half of the <b>early</b> <b>fattened</b> pigs were sold within a year. Most of the women appreciated the experiment positively and suggested positive margins can be attained by selecting suitable piglets and rigorously respecting feeding and management schemes. Criteria were developed for selecting the most suitable piglets with a simple tailor tape. A projection on 3 years shows that the gross margin of <b>early</b> <b>fattening</b> is higher compared to traditional fattening and that it facilitates the production of more meat against lower cost...|$|R

40|$|In boars, social {{relationships}} could influence pubertal development and feeding behaviour. The {{objectives of the}} present study were to determine the relationships between behaviour (agonistic, mounting and feeding behaviours), plasma sex steroids (oestradiol, testosterone) and fat androstenone. A total of 270 Pietrain x Large White boars, derived from four distinct genotypes were used. They were raised in groups of 11 - 12 pigs/pen. Animals were observed for about two times 10 h/day at the beginning or about 6 h at the end of fattening. Agonistic (fighting, hitting, biting, threatening, chasing) and sexual (mounting) behaviours were counted in <b>early</b> <b>fattening</b> shortly after a social mixing (for 177 of the 270 animals) and in late fattening after several weeks of social stability. Skin lesions were counted in the same periods and on carcasses. Data obtained from electronic feeders were used to determine the number and duration of meals, and the feed intake over 96 -h periods in the middle {{and at the end of}} fattening. At the end of fattening, blood was sampled to measure oestradiol and testosterone. At slaughter, fat was collected to measure androstenone. Using the agonistic behaviours, a dominance index was calculated (DRrank). As expected, numbers of skin lesions and agonistic acts were higher in <b>early</b> <b>fattening</b> (P < 0. 0001) whereas that of mounting acts was lower in early than in late fattening (P < 0. 05). The feeding characteristics (r = 0. 25 to 0. 39) were significantly correlated between ages, whereas numbers of mountings (r = 0. 18), of skin lesions (r = 0. 05) and agonistic acts (r =- 0. 05) were not. The number of agonistic acts was significantly correlated with that of mountings only-in <b>early</b> <b>fattening</b> (r = 0. 38). At both ages, no difference between dominance groups was observed for feeding characteristics. This was probably related to low competition between boars for access to feed. Dominant boars had a higher concentration of androstenone in fat than subordinates (P < 0. 05) but no difference was observed for plasma steroids. An active role of androstenone in controlling social behaviour but not reproductive function may explain this phenomenon...|$|R

The additive {{is to be used}} as a feed additive for chickens and turkeys for fattening, laying hens, piglets (weaned) and pigs for <b>fattening,</b> <b>ducks,</b> guinea fowls, quails, geese, pheasants and pigeons. Tolerance trials performed in chickens and turkeys for fattening, laying hens and piglets showed that the animals tolerated well 200 -fold (chickens, turkeys and piglets) or 20 -fold (laying hens) the recommended dosage. Therefore, the additive is safe for these target species at the recommended dose. The conclusion can be extended to pigs for fattening and can be extrapolated to ducks, guinea fowls, quails, geese, pheasants and pigeons provided that the same dose applies. The fermentation product used for the preparation of the additive gave negative results for mutagenicity. The results obtained in a sub-chronic oral toxicity study raised no concerns regarding the product. Therefore, the additive gives rise to no concern for consumer safety. No risks to the environment are expected from the use of the product as a feed additive. Based on the results obtained in the efficacy trials provided in chickens and turkeys for fattening, laying hens, piglets (weaned) and pigs for fattening, it is concluded that the additive has the potential to be efficacious at the recommended dose.

40|$|International audienceThe PSR {{problem has}} become a major {{occupational}} health issue in Western countries. At the request of an SME which processes <b>fattened</b> <b>ducks,</b> we developed a specific approach taking into account its economic and social environment. We assumed that the PSR could not be dealt with independently of the realities and the production constraints. The initial request, made by the person responsible for occupational health and the head of production, mentioned a deterioration in the working environment in the "stripping" department, where "foie gras" is prepared once removed from the duck. This resulted in an increase in absenteeism (more than 20 %), complaints from employees over a long period, a deterioration in mutual aid between employees in the department and a general demotivation. We proposed a participative methodology (in working groups) targeting the identification and resolution of quality and production problems, ranging from difficulties in producing foie gras of quality to being able to cope with PSR. In particular, we will discuss the method employed: * Work analyses to identify problems with production and quality, * Search for links between problems of production, quality and health, * Participatory ergonomics to try out solutions and evaluate them, * Reflection on the organization with middle and top management. The production problems were finally resolved, thereby improving productivity and quality. Beyond these aspects, our biggest challenge was to establish a process allowing more leeway for employees to improve their daily situation, something that supervisors saw as loss of control. Our focus was employee commitment to the process and the positive results have finally proved convincing. Absenteeism has stabilized and was lower {{a few months after the}} intervention.

Hungary has been a global leader in goose liver production for decades but can expect to see new competitors (e. g. China) in worldwide liver trade. Additionally, the increased duck liver production in other countries may also {{make it more difficult to}} export Hungarian liver products. As fattened liver (foie gras) cannot be produced in any other way than the way it is currently done the present requirement of relevant labelling of products made from <b>fattened</b> geese and <b>ducks</b> is the correct solution due to the ever stronger animal welfare movements. This provides customers with fair information, allowing them to make a choice of purchasing of refusing such products. It would be useful to use appropriate tools of communication to make consumers aware that fattened goose liver is a traditional product of Hungary, which has a unique quality. There are serious social interests (jobs, industry) and economic benefits (export revenue) attached to preserving this industry.

Field survey {{has been carried out}} with the Bedouins in the area to assess the effect of such long drought incidence on their socioeconomic vulnerability and livestock production systems, upon which they rely for sustaining their livelihood. The study covered 182 breeders during the Summer 2011, distributed over 3 agro-ecological zones; the rain-fed area (West), the new reclaimed land (East) and Siwa desert oasis (South). The breeders in the rain-fed area who were affected more by the incidence of drought, had to take some radical measures to cope with such prolonged drought. One of which is reducing their flock size from 201 heads, in average, by 1995 to 115 in 2011. Raising more goats was another means in their adaptive strategy to the incidence of long drought. Goat percent in the oasis flocks has been raised from 32 in 1995 to 56 % in 2011, and in the rain-fed area from 20. 7 to 22. 5 %. Twenty percent of the breeders in the oasis raised only goats.

Goats contribute significantly to the nutritional status of the householders in the 3 agro ecological zones; in average family consumed 15 % of their goats for the family meat requirement in the rain-fed and oasis areas. More than 50 % of the cash income of the breeders in the rain-fed area during 2011 came from selling weaned kids and lambs, 62 % in the oasis from <b>early</b> <b>fattened</b> kids and lambs, and 42 % in the reclaimed land came from selling late fattening lambs. Raising goats seems to be an effective adaptive process to cope with the long drought incidence in the hot dry region. It contributes significantly to the nutritional status of the family, and an efficient source of income for the householders in the rain-fed area and desert oasis, but not in the reclaimed cultivated lands.

Two groups were used; the first one is the control group fed on basal diet with free access to swimming pond, and the second fed on basal diet without access to swimming pond. The previous parameters were recorded daily or weekly during the experiment or after slaughtering for collecting blood parameters. The results explained that, there was an insignificant decrease in drinking behavior and significant increase in feather pecking. However, there was an insignificant decrease in feed consumption, live body weight, feed conversion, weight gain, dressing percentage, liver weight and serum corticosterone level. There was an insignificant decrease in T 3 and T 4 level and significant increase in feather pecking behaviour.

40|$|International audienceIntramuscular {{fat content}} is {{important}} for many meat quality parameters. This work is aimed at identifying functional categories of genes associated with natural variation among individuals in intramuscular fat content to help the design of genetic schemes for high marbling potential. Taking advantage of the global nature of transcriptomic and proteomic technologies, 40 genes were identified as differently expressed between high fat and low fat pig Longissimus muscles at slaughter weight. They are involved in metabolic processes, cell communication, binding, and response to stimulus. Using real-time PCR in muscle biopsies taken <b>earlier</b> in the <b>fattening</b> period, the group with a high intramuscular fat content was also characterized by the down-expression of genes playing a negative role in adipogenesis, such as architectural transcription factor high-motility hook A 1, mitogen activated protein-kinase 14, and cyclin D 1. These results suggest that interindividual variability in intramuscular fat content might arise essentially from differences in early adipogenesis...|$|R
40|$|Behavioural and {{physiological}} changes during the reproductive period were documented in male European ground squirrels including: initiated conflict, scent marking, locomotion and range size, {{as well as}} testis size, scrotal pigmentation, testosterone levels and changes in body mass. Spring emergence dates in adult males varied but preceded those of females. Gonadal maturation was complete in adult males at emergence. Most yearlings did not mature and emerged with females. After a quiescent premating phase, male range, range overlap, conflict rates and locomotion increased at female emergence. The synchrony of females, their small ranges and short latencies to ovulation produced a highly male-biased operational sex ratio (OSR) and potential for scramble competition polygyny. In contrast to other ground squirrel species, each female apparently mated with only a single male. Scramble competition did appear to occur, in that males tried to contact as many females {{as often as possible}} before copulation. Females placed high temporal prerequisites on males. Costs of scrambling were documented by body mass loss during mating, which covaried with the number of 'acquired' females. Testicular regression occurred <b>earlier,</b> and <b>fattening,</b> moult and onset of next hibernation were delayed in successful males. The determinant factor in these costs was found to be mass loss intensity during the main mating period. Surprisingly, this factor was best related to feeding changes and not to locomotion or aggression. Time budget constraints perhaps imposed by the female, with compounding influences of exercise and stress effects of conflict, then negatively affected ensuing seasonal activities. The individual changes may adversely affect individual survivability and/or future reproductive success. ...|$|R
40|$|This manual was {{originally}} produced in Spanish by the Ministry of Sugar Production in Cuba. With funds from CTA, the Caribbean Agricultural Research and Development Institute (CARDI) {{was able to}} translate it and produce it in English {{in order to help}} increase duck production as a source of protein for the Caribbean in particular, and also for other ACP countries. The domestic duck has a rapid growth rate: while fattening chickens require 23 % and 19. 7 % of total protein (TP) during the initial growing and <b>fattening</b> stages respectively, <b>ducks</b> can perform very well with 20 % and then 16 % protein up to the time of slaughter. Perhaps {{the most important aspect of}} duck-rearing for the Caribbean and other cane producing countries is their preference for liquid diets, which makes ducks particularly suitable for rearing on some by-products of sugar. Sugar by-products such as intermediate syrups A and B, syrup-off, or even sugar cane juice, can provide the required energy component of up to 65 % of dry matter, while soyabeans or soya flour, sunflowers, fish silage, earthworms or organic waste can provide the protein element of the diet. This small manual covers all aspects of duck rearing, production, reproduction, housing, hygiene and management. Sixteen pages are devoted to feeding, with tabulated sugar-based formulae for different stages of duck growth, and tables which show the use of differing amount sand types of compounds that may be utilized.

30|$|Our data {{indicate}} that in remote rural counties of the Mongolian Altai mountains, livestock losses in the 2009 / 10 dzud were very high and in particular affected herders with smaller and/or goat-dominated herds, who often were of Kazakh and Uriankhai ethnicity. Whereas Uriankhai households and the wealthier Torguud herders pursued a quick re-stocking of herds, small-scale Kazakh herders abandoned livestock-keeping. For a majority of herders, local ecological knowledge of predicting harsh winters and taking precautions against such disaster gained importance only after the 2009 / 10 dzud. Therefore, priority was given to hay-making and winter pen preparation, whereas improvement of livestock productivity through segregated grazing (otor) of selected animals, frequent pastureland rotation of the main herd, controlled mating and <b>early</b> sale of <b>fattened</b> as well as skinny livestock were sometimes mentioned but hardly practiced. Since animals that enter the winter season in healthy and well-fed condition are more resistant against disaster than lean animals, national and international organizations wishing to support livestock keepers in this and similar regions should highlight the relevance of these local approaches. However, labour investments in refined herding strategies, hay-making and winter pen preparation can be substantial and surpass the capacities of individual households. Therefore, community-based activities are highly advisable.|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} in Goma district of Jimma Zone of Ethiopia with objectives of generating baseline information and identifying challenges and opportunities of small ruminant production and marketing. Results are based on diagnostic survey of 160 sample households, group discussions, monitoring of 36 flocks and rapid appraisal of major sheep and goat markets. The study district was stratified into three groups based on flock distribution as: sheep dominating, goat dominating and mixed flock sites. The average land holding per household was 1. 93 ha. On average, a household owned 3. 6 cattle, 3. 6 sheep, 2. 1 goats, 0. 2 equines and 2. 7 chickens. In Goma where coffee and chat are the major cash sources for farmers, small ruminant are mainly kept for cash generation and saving in time of coffee failure. About 94 % of the small ruminant owners reported to keep them for income generation. The second main reason for keeping small ruminant in the study area was for saving purpose. Keeping small ruminant for manure purpose was the third important reason. Other important reasons included for meat production and for risk distribution. Farmers kept larger proportion of female animals than male animals and it was rare to find male of advanced age as they were sold or slaughtered at <b>early</b> age. <b>Fattening</b> small ruminants is commonly practiced by most farmers and nowadays getting more attention due to high market demand and better prices. From the interviewed households, 59. 4 %, 32. 1, 23. 5 %, and 19. 4 % of them utilize communal grazing, after math grazing, roadside grazing, and riverside grazing, respectively. Most small ruminants are either tethered or herded all the seasons due to the cultivation of perennial crops and predators. All small ruminants are housed for protection from adverse weather conditions and predators. Most lambings and kiddings occurred in the main rainy season. The average litter size, birth weight (kg), and weaning weight (kg) of sheep were found to be: 1. 37, 2. 86 and 11. 59, respectively. The corresponding values for goats were 1. 6, 2. 76, and 9, respectively. There are five towns where small ruminants were marketed in addition to many villages that were used as primary market sources for small ruminants. Farmers, traders, brokers, restaurant/hotel owners, butchers are the major market participants. There is one main market route i. e., from Agaro to Addis. The major problems for small ruminant production and marketing were: feed and grazing land shortage, lack of input, predators, diseases and parasites and marketing problems. In order to utilize the current growing demand of small ruminant meat at local and international markets, identification of alternative feed resources and strategic feeding management, identification of causes of diseases and their control methods as well as improving marketing efficiency through appropriate policy and provision of information are areas of interventions.

40|$|Gonadotropin {{releasing}} hormone (GnRH) plays {{a pivotal role}} in fertility and reproduction in mammals. It induces the release of luteinising hormone (LH) en follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) from the pituitary. These hormones are responsible for gonadal steroid production and indirectly for gametogenesis. In this thesis, studies are presented which described the development of a highly immunogenic GnRH antigen, as well as the evaluation of this antigen in vaccines in target species. The native GnRH peptide was enlarged to a GnRH-tandem peptide and immunogenicity was further increased by dimerization of the peptide and introduction of foreign amino acids (G 6 k-GnRH-tandem-dimer). This modified peptide construct was conjugated to ovalbumine. It appeared to be highly effective in immunosterilization, i. e. blocking testosterone production, in male piglets. The role of the individual amino acids of the G 6 k-GnRH-tandem-dimer on immunosterilization efficacy was established, using alanine replacements. All amino acids, except amino acids at position 2 and 3, could be individually replaced by alanine without affecting efficacy of the vaccine. Peptides with alanine replacements at position 1 or 4 did induce antibodies that were specific for GnRH and did not cross-react with other GnRH-isoforms present in mammals. Immunosterilization by vaccination against GnRH could be a suitable alternative for surgical castration in male piglets. Surgical castration prevents boar taint, but is an animal unfriendly practice, as it is performed without anaesthesia. Immunosterilization may also be beneficial for growth performance. Effects of the time of onset of effective immunosterilization on growth performance were studied. Effective immunosterilization <b>early</b> during the <b>fattening</b> period resulted in a growth performance similar to surgical castrates. In contrast, when immunosterilization was initiated late during the fattening period, growth performance was improved over surgical castrates and carcass quality appeared to be similar to intact male pigs. In addition, immunosterilized pigs of both groups could easily be distinguished from intact male pigs by the size of their testes. Two vaccines with the G 6 k-GnRH-tandem-dimer antigen in CoVaccine and Carbopol adjuvant were evaluated in sexually mature male ponies. The CoVaccine-treated stallions showed a high antibody response after the second vaccination, subsequently leading to undetectable testosterone levels and affected testis function, while effects in the Carbopol group were only present in one of the four stallions treated. In humane medicine, GnRH vaccination could be an alternative for hormone therapy in prostate cancer patients. Two potential vaccines with the antigen in ISA 51 and in CoVaccine adjuvant were studied in pigs. The latter vaccine appeared to be more effective. It reduced testosterone levels, weights of testes and accessory sex glands in all treated animals. Both vaccines can be considered as non-toxic; no chronic abnormalities were observed in blood, urine, organs or tissues. In conclusion, this vaccine could be a suitable alternative for surgical castration in pigs, eventually leading to a ban on this animal unfriendly practice in the EU. In human medicine, GnRH vaccination could replace hormone therapy in diseases driven by gonadal steroids. In prostate cancer for instance, GnRH vaccination may be a long term effective, cheap and safe alternative...|$|R
