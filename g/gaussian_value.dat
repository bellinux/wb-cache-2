A brief discussion raises the question whether this a priori curious finding is a curiosity, in fine. Comment: 8 pages, 2 figures, 1 tabl...|$|E

The general supergravity action with a given Kahler potential $K$, superpotential $W$ and vector matrix $f_{AB}$ interacting with a nilpotent chiral multiplet consists of the standard supergravity action defined by $K$, $W$ and $f_{AB}$ where the scalar in the nilpotent multiplet has {{to be replaced by a}} bilinear combination of the fermion in the nilpotent multiplet divided by the <b>Gaussian</b> <b>value</b> of the auxiliary field.

40|$|We {{consider}} the well-known JaynesCummings model {{and ask if}} it can display randomness. As a solvable Hamiltonian system, it does not display chaotic behaviour in the ordinary sense.

That this may display a random <b>Gaussian</b> <b>value</b> distribution is suggested by an exactly provable result by Kac. In order to reach our conclusion we use the Kac model to develop tests for the emergence of a Gaussian. Even if the consequent double limits are difficult to evaluate numerically, we find definite indications that the JaynesCummings case also produces a randomness in its value distributions. Numerical methods do not establish such a result beyond doubt, but our conclusions are definite enough to suggest strongly an unexpected randomness emerging in a dynamic time evolution...|$|E
