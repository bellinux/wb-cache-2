25|$|The Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railroad was {{a pretty}} weak reed for Seattle to cling to. City {{boosters}} blew {{a lot of money}} on that railroad and when they were through, it had only been built as far east as Rattlesnake Prairie above Snoqualmie Falls and as for north as Arlington. But it was the only hope that Seattle-New York Alki held out for a connection with a transcontinental system. On the other hand, the side benefits of the SLS enabled boosters to <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>jackpot</b> with the Great Northern.|$|E

Steve also grew up poor and he bonded with Rachel over their {{respective}} pasts, but it was Rachel's sister-in-law, Alice, who stole his heart. Alice was sophisticated, shy, and demure—everything Rachel was not. They courted and were to marry in 1969, but the marriage was called off when Rachel crashed their engagement party {{with the news that}} she was carrying Steve's child. She later gave birth to a son named Jamie.|$|E

[...] He continued by drawing a comparison to the film Heat starring Robert DeNiro, noting [...] "To me, this is truly wonderful filmmaking. And so any opportunity I can get to try my hand at that I welcome. From that perspective, I really <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>jackpot</b> this year and I'm very grateful." ...|$|E

2500|$|Three-player Mahjong (or 3-ka) is a {{simplified}} three-person Mahjong that involves hands of 13 tiles (with {{a total of}} 84 tiles on the table) and may use jokers depending on the variation. Any rule set can be adapted for three players; however, this is far more common and accepted in Japan, Korea, Malaysia and the Philippines. It usually eliminates one suit entirely, or tiles 2-8 in one suit leaving only the terminals. It needs fewer people to start a game and the turnaround time of a game is short—hence, it is considered a fast game. In some versions there is a jackpot for winning in which whoever accumulates a point of 10 is considered to <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>jackpot</b> or whoever scores three hidden hands first. The Malaysian and Korean versions drop one wind and may include a seat dragon[...]|$|E
2500|$|The {{business}} model of Square Enix {{is centered on}} the idea of [...] "polymorphic content", which consists of developing franchises on multiple potential hardware or media rather than being restricted by a single gaming platform. An early example of this strategy is Enix's Fullmetal Alchemist manga series, which has been adapted into two anime television series, two movies, and several novels and video games. Other polymorphic projects include Compilation of Final Fantasy VII, Code Age, World of Mana, Ivalice Alliance and as of 2016 the ongoing Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy series. According to Yoichi Wada, [...] "It's very difficult to <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>jackpot,</b> as it were. Once we've hit it, we have to get all the juice possible out of it". Similar to Sony's Greatest Hits program, Square Enix also re-releases their best selling games at a reduced price under a label designated [...] "Ultimate Hits".|$|E
2500|$|Beinn a’ Chroin's summit 'moved' in the 1990s. [...] It has a 1.2 {{kilometre}} long summit ridge, {{two thirds}} {{to the west}} gently undulating with four tops and then one third with a distinct top at the eastern end, of the ridge separated by a col with a height of 877 metres. The recognised summit location of highest point of Beinn a’ Chroin changed in 1998. For all years prior, the official highest point of the mountain was the eastern end 940 metres. OS Landranger 1.50k map only showed a 938m spot height on western ridge. However autumn 1997 amateur cartographic sleuth Charles Everett noticed on the new OS 1.25k map, two small 940 metre contour rings without spot heights, on the western ridge, just 75 metres apart, one to NE one to SW. [...] Realizing that these both had {{to be higher than}} the eastern top, he sent a number of letters to the Ordnance Survey over next six months asking for: firstly, the exact heights inside these contour rings, and secondly, why these two points, both of which were clearly higher points on the mountain than the eastern 940m top, hadn’t had spot heights detailed on the map. [...] Initial response from some departments was unhelpful and frustrating and stating they were unable to give any information. [...] Persistence with another couple of letters eventually <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>jackpot</b> with a July 8, 1998 letter confirming that there was a spot height of 941.5m in one of the contour rings, but frustratingly not specifying which. [...] Subsequently Harveys maps, when they republished their Crianlarich map, gave the NE contour ring on west ridge, 941m at 388186 and SW one 942m at 387185 representing the new summit position of Beinn a’Chroin. The eastern top has now become a subsidiary Munro “top” at 940 metres.|$|E
