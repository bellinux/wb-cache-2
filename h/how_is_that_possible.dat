5000|$|From [...] "Films in Review", re [...] "LOVE TRIANGLE: Ronald Reagan, Jane Wyman, & Nancy Davis"It {{has to be}} a {{reflection}} of modern technological advances, it can’t be anything else: all the Blood Moon books, most of them several hundredpages in length, are written by the same two people - Porter & Prince. I mean, <b>how</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>possible?</b> Each book should have taken twoyears. Well, it must be {{something to do with the}} ease of writing with WORD, combined with the extraordinarily easy access to informationon the internet. I’ve never seen a more thorough use of these modern breakthroughs than here.And while the book has the feeling, at times, of collage, it’s never any less than fun, and it’s infinitely more substantial than a mere gossiptome. I mean, I loved Kenneth Anger’s Hollywood Babylon books (I had the pleasure of putting him up at my apt for a few days once, andthat was fun, too), but they (and this, at first glance) are nothing more than gossip. However in their cumulative, lurid glow, like Weejee’s LAphotos, the O’Toole bio becomes something more than what is on the surface - much, more, certainly than what Anger gave us. O’TOOLEtakes itself a level more seriously than gossip, and its text is informative, both about the British stage and the American screen.In terms of glorious gossip, however, wait till you get (just as an example) to page 126. O’Toole is invited by Jules Buck, his friend andbusiness partner, to join him for drinks with two other friends, who turn out to be Ava Gardner (they meet in her suite at the Savoy Hotel inLondon) and Burt Lancaster, neither of whom O’Toole had previously met, and both of whom had acted together in Robert Siodmak’s THEKILLERS. Their unexpurgated stories that evening are absolute jaw-droppers. Lancaster’s bi-sexuality and Gardner’s sexual appetites aretossed away like everyday, casual knowledge. Their fast-flowing repartee and awareness of each other’s sexual adventures pile on, paragraphafter paragraph, story after story, and it’s heady stuff. Add in some bizarre here-say out of nowhere about Evita Peron, and it’s a kinetic,wonderfully written chapter. And there are plenty more to follow.I mentioned this book to FIR’s quirky film critic, Victoria Alexander, and after reading it she ordered the one on Elizabeth Taylor and said itwas just as good. Blood Moon has found a winning formula.|$|E

40|$|Part Four of the Changing Politics of Central Banking SeriesCentral banks {{around the}} world emerged from the {{financial}} crisis in a curious situation.

40|$|In First Corinthians, Paul {{tries to}} {{convince}} his readers to stay faithful to their congregation and {{to work together to}} achieve unity and solidarity within their Christian context.

Throughout this essay, I will try to describe for the view of difficulties within a Christian context and how this unity is expressed in the community of Corinth in the light of the secular surroundings. ...|$|E
40|$|Along with Dretske, Millikan {{is famous}} for having pioneered the ‘teleosemantic ’ {{approach}} {{in the philosophy of}} mind and language. According to that approach, meaning in its most puzzling varieties — the conventional significance of linguistic forms, and the content of mental representations — can be understood in terms of two simple ingredients: natural meaning, on the one hand, and purposes or functions, on the other. What makes linguistic meaning and intentional content puzzling is the absence of a property which natural meaning displays, namely factivity. As Grice emphasized, if (the occurrence of) a certain sign x means that p, in the natural sense of ‘mean’, then p (Grice 1957). It follows that the natural-meaning relation is well-behaved — it cannot obtain between two things unless those things exist. It is like the relation of kissing: for the kissing relation to be instantiated, there must be a kisser and a kissee. The puzzling varieties of meaning are puzzling precisely because the relation between the sign and the thing signified is not well-behaved in this way. Someone’s words can mean that p even though it is not the case that p, and a mental representation can represent something that does not exist. <b>How</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>possible?</b> How can we make room for Grice’s ‘nonnatural meaning ’ and for Brentano’...|$|E

40|$|Algorithmic {{game theory}} {{attempts}} to mathematically capture behavior in strategic situations, {{in which an}} individual's success depends on the choices of others. Research in this area tends to focus {{on one of the}} following challenges: 1) Price of Anarchy: Characterize the inefficiency of equilibria vs the global optimum. 2) Computational Complexity of Equilibria 3) Algorithmic Mechanism Design: Design games with desirable properties that are efficiently implementable. Many strategic interactions are in their nature recurrent (e. g. financial markets) with the agents participating in them repeatedly. These agents learn over time to adapt to their environment as is defined by the game and the dynamic behavior of the other agents[96]. We show that incorporating the assumption of adaptive agents can lead to exciting new insights to long standing questions in all areas of algorithmic game theory. A Learning Theoretic Refinement of the Price of Anarchy: It is well understood that competitive environments can result in losses to social welfare {{due to the lack of}} a central coordinator who could enforce the global optimum solution. Defined as the ratio of the cost of the worst possible (Nash) equilibrium over the cost of the optimum, price of anarchy (and its variants) are commonly used metrics for these inefficiencies. However, such worst case analysis can be rather misleading as worst case equilibria may never arise in practice. Can natural learning algorithms beat the price of anarchy? We show that in the class of atomic congestion games natural learning algorithms can indeed learn to navigate away from such worst case equilibria. In some cases the implied performance bounds are exponentially better than the previously known worst case guarantees. Furthermore, such positive performance results are shown to be robust even when we impose restrictions on availability of accurate up-to-date information on which agents can base their decisions. Learning Inspired Equilibria and Computation: The plausibility of the Nash equilibrium, as a universal solution concept has been under attack, due to recent negative complexity results (e. g. for normal form games with constant number of players[27, 24]). To make matters worse, there exist games of constant overall size, for which Nash equilibria are unstable for most reasonable dynamics[88]. In this section we will look into learning inspired solution concepts such as strong CURB (Closed Under Rational Behavior) and CUBR (Closed Under weakly Better Replies) sets. A strong CURB (CUBR) set is a cartesian product of pure strategy sets such that each player's component contains all best (weakly better) responses to itself given any joint probability distributions of its opponents over the set. A strong CURB (CUBR) set is said to be minimal if it does not contain any proper subset that is also a strong CURB (CUBR) set. Such minimal sets exist in all finite games and are asymptotically stable for a great number of natural learning dynamics. Furthermore, we prove that we can also compute all minimal strong CURB (as well as CUBR) sets for any normal form game with a constant number of players in polynomial time. Mechanism Evolution: The goal of mechanism design is to design games that are uniquely solvable by reasonably self-interested players and which lead to socially optimal outcomes. Such guarantees are of critical importance in the case of economic interactions which are key revenue producers, such as ad-auctions. However, in many cases of social and economic interactions, centralized design is impractical and sometimes even undesirable (i. e. internet). Nevertheless, such mechanisms seem to be working fairly well in practise. <b>How</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>possible?</b> Most mechanisms that we participate in are not the product of "intelligent design". Instead mechanisms evolve. All games (mechanisms) that we participate in are in essence social contracts. The rules of these interactions change over time as the result of actions of the same individuals who participate in them. These changes are not random. On the contrary the involved agents are trying to bring on changes to the structure of the game, so as to improve their experience from participating in the game. We formalize these intuitions and we analyze their implications in the context of oligopolistic markets. Specifically, we allow players one extra dimension in the pursuit of their strategic goals, the possibility of forming coalitions with other agents. We focus on the class of linear and symmetric Cournot games and we study the nature of stable coalition structures. We show than even the worst stable coalition can lead to a significant increase in market prices and profits for the firms...|$|E
