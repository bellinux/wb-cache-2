5|$|Albrecht <b>Dürer</b> (1471–1528) was a German Renaissance {{printmaker}} {{who made}} important contributions to polyhedral literature in his 1525 book, Underweysung der Messung (Education on Measurement), meant {{to teach the}} subjects of linear perspective, geometry in architecture, Platonic solids, and regular polygons. <b>Dürer</b> was likely influenced by the works of Luca Pacioli and Piero della Francesca during his trips to Italy. While the examples of perspective in Underweysung der Messung are underdeveloped and contain inaccuracies, there is a detailed discussion of polyhedra. <b>Dürer</b> is also the first to introduce in text the idea of polyhedral nets, polyhedra unfolded to lie flat for printing. <b>Dürer</b> published another influential book on human proportions called Vier Bücher von Menschlicher Proportion (Four Books on Human Proportion) in 1528.|$|E
5|$|Albrecht <b>Dürer</b> {{was an avid}} {{student of}} exotic animals, and drew many {{sketches}} based on his visits to European zoos. <b>Dürer</b> visited 's-Hertogenbosch during Bosch's lifetime, {{and it is likely}} the two artists met, and that Bosch drew inspiration from the German's work.|$|E
5|$|Portrait Diptych of Dürer's Parents (or Dürer's Parents with Rosaries) is the {{collective}} name for two late-15th century portrait panels by the German painter and printmaker Albrecht <b>Dürer.</b> They show the artist's parents, Barbara Holper (c. 1451–1514) and Albrecht <b>Dürer</b> the Elder (c. 1427–1502), {{when she was}} around 39 and he was 63 years. The portraits are unflinching records of {{the physical and emotional}} effects of ageing. The <b>Dürer</b> family was close and <b>Dürer</b> may have intended the panels either to display his skill to his parents or as keepsakes while he travelled soon after as a journeyman painter.|$|E
50|$|About {{this time}} he began to make copies of <b>Dürer's</b> woodcut series, the Life of the Virgin. This was {{extremely}} common practice, although normally engravers copied other expensive engravings rather than the cheaper woodcuts. However <b>Dürer's</b> woodcuts had raised the standard of the medium considerably, and since Marcantonio continued to copy {{a large number of}} both <b>Dürer's</b> engravings and woodcuts, he must have found it profitable.|$|R
50|$|On {{the reverse}} of this {{painting}} is an intriguing image of {{what appears to be}} a meteor/meteorite or comet. <b>Dürer's</b> inspiration may have been the depictions of comets in the Nuremberg Chronicle of 1493. However, those woodcuts are highly stylized, and are not intended to show historical comets, whereas <b>Dürer's</b> image has the feel of an actual observation, as does the blazing star in <b>Dürer's</b> enigmatic engraving Melencolia I, published in 1514.|$|R
40|$|At the {{beginning}} of the submitted thesis is presented Albrecht <b>Dürer's</b> engraving "Melencolia I" from the year 1514. This work is well known and very important for art history. At the end of the thesis is a small drawing, Caspar David Friedrich's selfportrait from from {{the beginning}} of nineteenth century. The both work can be described as melancolical. <b>Dürer's</b> engraving has Melancholy directly in the title, Friedrich's drawing creates an impression of melancholy. From complicated relationships between attributes and symbols on <b>Dürer's</b> work remains in the Friedrich only typical melancolical gesture of the hand, which support the head. My work deals with influency of <b>Dürer's</b> Melancholy in the art of the 16 th, 17 th and 18 th century. <b>Dürer's</b> understanding of melancholy as "melancholia artificialis", artist's melancholy, in the connection with genius found immediately after its origin a lot of variations and immitations...|$|R

5|$|The two panels were reunited in 2012 {{during a}} <b>Dürer</b> {{exhibition}} in Nuremberg having been separated since sometime between 1588 and 1628.|$|E
5|$|A second woodcut was {{executed}} by Hans Burgkmair in Augsburg {{around the same}} time as Dürer's in Nuremberg. Burgkmair corresponded with merchants in Lisbon and Nuremberg, {{but it is not clear}} whether he had access to a letter or sketch as <b>Dürer</b> did, perhaps even Dürer's sources, or saw the animal himself in Portugal. His image is truer to life, omitting Dürer's more fanciful additions and including the shackles and chain used to restrain the rhinoceros; however, Dürer's woodcut is more powerful and eclipsed Burgkmair's in popularity. Only one impression (example) of Burgkmair's image has survived, whereas Dürer's print survives in many impressions. <b>Dürer</b> produced a first edition of his woodcut in 1515, in the first state, which is distinguished by only five lines of text in the heading. Many further printings followed after Dürer's death in 1528, including two in the 1540s, and two more in the late 16th century. Later printings have six lines of descriptive text.|$|E

5|$|Animals such as {{horses and}} deer {{are among the}} {{earliest}} subjects of art, being found in the Upper Paleolithic cave paintings such as at Lascaux. Major artists such as Albrecht <b>Dürer,</b> George Stubbs and Edwin Landseer {{are known for their}} portraits of animals. Animals further play a wide variety of roles in literature, film, mythology, and religion.|$|E
5|$|Dürer's Rhinoceros is {{the name}} {{commonly}} given to a woodcut executed by German painter and printmaker Albrecht <b>Dürer</b> in 1515. The image {{is based on a}} written description and brief sketch by an unknown artist of an Indian rhinoceros that had arrived in Lisbon in 1515. <b>Dürer</b> never saw the actual rhinoceros, which was the first living example seen in Europe since Roman times. In late 1515, the King of Portugal, Manuel I, sent the animal as a gift for Pope Leo X, but it died in a shipwreck off the coast of Italy in early 1516. A live rhinoceros was not seen again in Europe until a second specimen, named Abada, arrived from India at the court of Sebastian of Portugal in 1577, being later inherited by Philip II of Spain around 1580.|$|E
5|$|Dürer's {{well-known}} engraving Melencolia I {{depicts a}} frustrated thinker sitting by a truncated triangular trapezohedron and a magic square. These two objects, and the engraving as a whole, {{have been the}} subject of more modern interpretation than the contents of almost any other print, including a two-volume book by Peter-Klaus Schuster, and an influential discussion in Erwin Panofsky's monograph of <b>Dürer.</b>|$|E

50|$|While Panofsky {{was taking}} courses at Freiburg University, a {{slightly}} older student, Kurt Badt, {{took him to}} hear a lecture by {{the founder of the}} art history department, Wilhelm Vöge, under whom he wrote his dissertation in 1914. His topic, <b>Dürer's</b> artistic theory <b>Dürers</b> Kunsttheorie: vornehmlich in ihrem Verhaltnis zur Kunsttheorie der Italiener was published the following year in Berlin as Die Theoretische Kunstlehre Albrecht <b>Dürers.</b> Because of a horse-riding accident, Panofsky was exempted from military service during World War I, using the time to attend the seminars of the medievalist Adolph Goldschmidt in Berlin.|$|R
5|$|Highly {{educated and}} a {{patron of the}} arts, Honoré II, secure on his throne, began {{collecting}} works by Titian, <b>Dürer,</b> Raphael, Rubens and Michelangelo which {{formed the basis of}} the art collection that furnished the palace slowly evolving from the Monaco fortress. Over the following 30-year period he transformed it into a palace suitable for a prince (Illustration 9).|$|E
5|$|Mathematics can {{be discerned}} {{in many of}} the arts, such as music, dance, painting, architecture, and sculpture. Each of these is richly {{associated}} with mathematics. Among the connections to the visual arts, mathematics can provide tools for artists, such as the rules of linear perspective as described by Brook Taylor and Johann Lambert, or the methods of descriptive geometry, now applied in software modelling of solids, dating back to Albrecht <b>Dürer</b> and Gaspard Monge. Artists from Luca Pacioli in the Middle Ages and Leonardo da Vinci and Albrecht <b>Dürer</b> in the Renaissance have made use of and developed mathematical ideas in the pursuit of their artistic work. The use of perspective began, despite some embryonic usages in the architecture of Ancient Greece, with Italian painters such as Giotto in the 13th century; rules such as the vanishing point were first formulated by Brunelleschi in about 1413, his theory influencing Leonardo and <b>Dürer.</b> Isaac Newton's work on the optical spectrum influenced Goethe's Theory of Colours and in turn artists such as Philipp Otto Runge, J. M. W. Turner, the Pre-Raphaelites and Wassily Kandinsky. Artists may also choose to analyse the symmetry of a scene. Tools may be applied by mathematicians who are exploring art, or artists inspired by mathematics, such as M. C. Escher (inspired by H. S. M. Coxeter) and the architect Frank Gehry, who more tenuously argued that computer aided design enabled him to express himself in a wholly new way.|$|E
5|$|The school owns paintings, {{including}} {{a portrait of}} Tsar Nicholas I of Russia and another of the Jesuit Henry Garnet. In the Stuart Parlour are portraits of Jacobites including James Francis Edward Stuart, and his sons Charles Edward Stuart and Henry Benedict Stuart. There are also several original engravings by Rembrandt and <b>Dürer,</b> such as the 'Greater Passion' and the 'Car of Maximillian'.|$|E

5|$|Each canvas {{is mounted}} on two boards of equal width, which have been cut {{vertically}} and appear {{have come from the}} same tree. Tree-ring dating of the wood suggests it was felled around 1482. Wood intended for use in panel painting was generally allowed to mature for around 10 years, giving an approximate dates of 1490–92 for the works. The panels are covered with canvas made of fine but loosely woven linen, and underpainted in white paint. Whether <b>Dürer</b> prepared the panels himself or purchased them already prepared is unknown.|$|E
5|$|German {{painters}} {{have influenced}} western art. Albrecht <b>Dürer,</b> Hans Holbein the Younger, Matthias Grünewald and Lucas Cranach the Elder were important German {{artists of the}} Renaissance, Peter Paul Rubens and Johann Baptist Zimmermann of the Baroque, Caspar David Friedrich and Carl Spitzweg of Romanticism, Max Liebermann of Impressionism and Max Ernst of Surrealism. Such German sculptors as Otto Schmidt-Hofer, Franz Iffland, and Julius Schmidt-Felling made important contributions to German art history in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.|$|E
5|$|In 1520, {{the most}} famous church bell in Poland, named Zygmunt after Sigismund I of Poland, was cast by Hans Behem. At that time, Hans <b>Dürer,</b> a younger brother of artist and thinker Albrecht <b>Dürer,</b> was Sigismund's court painter. Hans von Kulmbach made altarpieces for several churches. In 1553, the Kazimierz {{district}} council gave the Jewish Qahal a licence {{for the right to}} build their own interior walls across the western section of the already existing defensive walls. The walls were expanded again in 1608 due to the growth of the community and influx of Jews from Bohemia. In 1572, King Sigismund II, the last of the Jagiellons, died childless. The Polish throne passed to Henry III of France and then to other foreign-based rulers in rapid succession, causing a decline in the city's importance that was worsened by pillaging during the Swedish invasion and by an outbreak of bubonic plague that left 20,000 of the city's residents dead. In 1596, Sigismund III of the Swedish House of Vasa moved the administrative capital of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth from Kraków to Warsaw.|$|E

5|$|The intense {{international}} exchange produced several cosmopolitan humanist scholars, including Francisco de Holanda, André de Resende and Damião de Góis, {{a friend of}} Erasmus who wrote with rare independence on the reign of King Manuel I. Diogo and André de Gouveia made relevant teaching reforms via France. Foreign news and products in the Portuguese factory in Antwerp attracted the interest of Thomas More and <b>Dürer</b> to the wider world. There, profits and know-how helped nurture the Dutch Renaissance and Golden Age, especially after {{the arrival of the}} wealthy cultured Jewish community expelled from Portugal.|$|E
5|$|Artists such as Albrecht <b>Dürer</b> and Leonardo da Vinci, often {{working with}} naturalists, were also {{interested}} in the bodies of animals and humans, studying physiology in detail and contributing {{to the growth of}} anatomical knowledge. The traditions of alchemy and natural magic, especially in the work of Paracelsus, also laid claim to knowledge of the living world. Alchemists subjected organic matter to chemical analysis and experimented liberally with both biological and mineral pharmacology. This {{was part of a larger}} transition in world views (the rise of the mechanical philosophy) that continued into the 17th century, as the traditional metaphor of nature as organism was replaced by the nature as machine metaphor.|$|E
5|$|Based {{on their}} {{similarity}} to the Altar of the City Patrons, art historians have attributed other paintings to Lochner, although a number have {{questioned whether the}} diary entry was authentically made by <b>Dürer.</b> Documentary evidence linking the paintings and miniatures with the historical Lochner has also been challenged, most notably by the art historian Michael Wolfson in 1996. In either case, the extent of Lochner's direct hand, {{as opposed to those}} of workshop members or followers, is debated. Some panels formerly attributed to him are now thought to date from after 1451, the year of his death.|$|E
