5|$|Despite {{the odds}} he faced {{in the general}} election, Tufaro promised to {{campaign}} against O'Malley, not taking defeat as an inevitability. <b>He</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> Bret Schundler, the mayor of Jersey City, New Jersey, as evidence that a Republican could be elected in a heavily Democratic city. Schundler came to Baltimore to campaign for Tufaro.|$|E
5|$|In 1865, Cancellor's {{death was}} used in a medical journal article {{discussing}} adult hydrocephalus. Despite Willis' statement that Cancellor had no pre-existing medical condition that would have caused or contributed to his death, author Samuel Wilks suggested not only that Cancellor had hydrocephalus, {{but that he was}} consequently more susceptible to physical injury as a result. <b>He</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> the autopsy finding of fluid in Cancellor's brain to support his assertions and argued that this effusion would have caused physical weakness.|$|E
5|$|Anderson {{scored the}} first penalty in sudden death. Kalou then sent Van der Sar {{the wrong way}} to make it 5–5. Giggs was next up and he was also successful. Van der Sar then pulled off the crucial save for United; <b>he</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> his left to {{indicate}} to Nicolas Anelka that he thought he would kick to that side, as had the six players who had kicked before him, only to correctly dive to his right to deny Anelka, whose kick was at a good height to be saved, securing European football's top prize for United {{for the third time in}} their history.|$|E

5|$|On 10 December 1936, Álvarez put the Republic's {{case to the}} League of Nations, further {{demanding}} that the League condemn Italy's and Germany's decision to recognise the Nationalists. <b>He</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> {{the risk of the}} Spanish war spreading, and suggested that the Non-Intervention Committee was ineffective. This charge was denied by Lord Cranborne and Édouard Viénot, the British and French representatives respectively, who appealed to the League to endorse the mediation plan. The League condemned intervention, urged its council's members to support non-intervention, and commended mediation. It then closed discussion on Spain, leaving it to the Committee. The mediation plan, however, was soon dropped. Britain and France continued to consider, and put forward, plans to prevent foreign volunteers, outside of the Committee.|$|E
5|$|Phillips {{writes that}} McKinley's low rating is undeserved, {{and that he}} should be ranked just after the great presidents such as Washington and Lincoln. <b>He</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> McKinley's success at {{building}} an electoral coalition that kept the Republicans mostly in power for a generation. Phillips believes that part of McKinley's legacy is the men he included in his administration, who dominated the Republican Party for a quarter century after his death. These officials included Cortelyou, who served in three Cabinet positions under Roosevelt, and Dawes, who became vice president under Coolidge. Other McKinley appointees who later became major figures include Day, who Roosevelt elevated to the Supreme Court where he remained nearly twenty years, and William Howard Taft, whom McKinley had made Governor-General of the Philippines and who succeeded Roosevelt as president.|$|E
5|$|McCreary's senate {{term was}} set to expire in 1908, {{the same year as}} Beckham's second term as governor. Desiring {{election}} to the Senate following his gubernatorial term, Beckham persuaded his Democratic allies to choose the party's nominees for governor and senator by a primary election held in 1906 – a year before the gubernatorial election and two years before the senatorial election. This ensured that the primary would occur during his term as governor, when he still wielded significant influence within the party. McCreary now allied himself with J. C. S. Blackburn, Henry Watterson, and other Beckham opponents, and sought to defend his seat in the primary. During the primary campaign, <b>he</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> his record of dealing with national issues, contrasting it with Beckham's youth and inexperience at the national level. Beckham countered by citing his strong stand in favor of Prohibition, as opposed to McCreary's more moderate position, and by touting his support of a primary election instead of a nominating convention, which he said gave the voters a choice in who would represent them in the Senate. Ultimately, Beckham prevailed in the primary by an 11,000-vote margin, rendering McCreary a lame duck with two years still left in his term.|$|E

5|$|On January 16, 1909, Democrat Hiram Smedley, county clerk since 1897, {{was indicted}} for embezzlement. Smedley resigned, and Barkley was {{appointed}} to a three-man commission to investigate the losses. The commission found $1,582.50 missing, and the county's Fiscal Court authorized Barkley to settle with the company that held Smedley's surety bond. In May 1909, Smedley {{was arrested and charged}} with 20 counts of forgery, prompting an audit of the county's finances that showed a shortage of $16,000, only $6,000 of which was accountable to Smedley. The scandal gave Republicans an issue for the upcoming campaign. In a series of debates, Barkley's opponent, Thomas N. Hazelip, claimed that the county's entire Democratic organization was corrupt and made charges against past Democratic administrations. Barkley responded that he had no more responsibility for those wrongdoings than Hazelip had for the murder of William Goebel, a Democratic governor who had allegedly been assassinated by Republican conspirators in 1900. <b>He</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> his improvement of the county's finances through inspection of charges presented to his office and showed evidence that he had fulfilled his obligations as county attorney, a fact Hazelip conceded. In spite of the scandal, Democrats won every county-wide office, although by reduced margins, but Republicans captured a 5-to-3 majority on the Fiscal Court. Barkley's victory margin—3,184 to 2,662—was the smallest of any county officer.|$|E
25|$|Ulrich {{started a}} Committee with Mark Treyger {{to monitor the}} {{recovery}} effort following Hurricane Sandy. Ulrich sharply criticized {{the pace of the}} recovery effort during oversight meetings in 2015 and 2016. <b>He</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> Build-it-Back as ineffective, pointing to cases where homeowners had been relocated for construction, only to learn that months had gone by with no development.|$|E
25|$|At the 1964 general election, Hughes-Young faced another {{challenge}} from Labour, who had selected Dr David Kerr; in his election address <b>he</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> {{the fact that}} Labour had opposed the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962 and asked how the local housing situation would cope without restrictions on immigration. In line with the national swing, Labour gained the constituency by 2,245 votes.|$|E

25|$|After {{the failure}} of the Polish {{uprising}} in 1863, Pius sided with the persecuted Poles, protesting their persecutions, infuriating the Tsarist government to the point that all Catholic dioceses were eliminated by 1870. Pius criticized the Tsar – without naming him – for expatriating whole communities to Siberia, exiling priests, condemning them to labour camps and abolishing Catholic dioceses. <b>He</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> Siberian villages Tounka and Irkout, where in 1868, 150 Catholic priests were awaiting death.|$|E
25|$|Ban {{has told}} senior {{managers}} that homophobia {{will not be}} tolerated. <b>He</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> countries such as Ukraine which has proposed criminalizing public discussion about homosexuality as threatening basic human rights.

He also said that religion, culture or tradition can never justify denial of basic rights.|$|E

Joshua Lapp thought Bernall had been queried about her belief, but was unable to correctly point out where Bernall was located, and was closer to Schnurr during the shootings. Another witness, Craig Scott, whose sister Rachel Scott was also portrayed as a Christian martyr, claimed that the discussion was with Bernall. When asked to indicate where the conversation had been coming from, <b>he</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> where Schnurr was shot.|$|E
25|$|Grey was {{determined}} to end the threat of an independence movement and presented a case to the Colonial Office in London that emphasised the threats and dangers of the King Movement, claiming that the European settlement {{was in danger of}} being wiped out. As evidence. <b>he</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> the theft of large amounts of gunpowder from Kawau Island in 1856 and the attack on Auckland City from the sea that was only stopped by a British warship and troops from Fort Britomart. To meet the danger, the British Government sent out 14,000 troops, commanded by Cameron.|$|E
25|$|Ellerbe {{announced}} on August 26 {{that he would}} resubmit his ambulance staffing plan to the D.C. City Council for approval. <b>He</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> 22 new paramedic hires and 20 new ambulances {{as a sign that}} the city would be able to provide good quality EMS care during night hours. Wells said the city council should be credited for pushing DCFEMS to improve vehicle purchasing and personnel hiring. But DCFES spokesman Keith St. Clair said the council's criticisms, rejections of Ellerbe's proposals, and publicity about DCFEMS problems had had no effect. St. Clair asserted that Ellerbe began making changes long before the council began its hearings.|$|E

25|$|The Privy Council reiterated its position, and Ridley {{responded in}} person, agreeing that vestments are {{indifferent}} but making a compelling {{argument that the}} monarch may require indifferent things without exception. The council became divided in opinion, and the issue dragged on for months without resolution. Hooper now insisted that vestments were not indifferent, since they obscured the priesthood of Christ by encouraging hypocrisy and superstition. Warwick disagreed, emphasising that the king must be obeyed in things indifferent, and <b>he</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> St Paul's concessions to Jewish traditions in the early church. Finally, an acrimonious debate with Ridley went against Hooper. Ridley's position centred on maintaining order and authority; not the vestments themselves, Hooper's primary concern.|$|E
25|$|Historian Arthur Marwick saw {{a radical}} {{transformation}} of British society, a deluge that swept away many old attitudes {{and brought in}} a more equalitarian society. He also saw the famous literary pessimism of the 1920s as misplaced, for there were major positive long-term consequences of the war. <b>He</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> new job opportunities and self-consciousness among workers that quickly built up the Labour Party, to the coming of partial woman suffrage, and to an acceleration of social reform and state control of the British economy. He found a decline of deference toward the aristocracy and established authority in general, and a weakening among youth of traditional restraints on individual moral behavior. Marwick concluded that class differentials softened, national cohesion increased, and British society became more equal.|$|E
25|$|Rickhey was exonerated by {{statements}} of past employees and written interrogations of his engineering colleagues – only {{the testimony of}} one former engineer was incriminating. Witnesses offered by the prosecution made only vague statements about his activities in camp operations because they had generally not personally witnessed it. Written evidence of Rickhey's guilt was also lacking; only {{after the end of}} the trial were documents found showing his culpability in the inhumane working conditions in the Mittelwork. Rickhey testified on his own behalf and put the entire responsibility for the inhumane conditions and forced labor on the late internment engineer Albin Sawatzki, who had died in American detention in 1945. Furthermore, <b>he</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> his cooperation with the U.S. Air Force (USAF) at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.|$|E
