6000|$|The engine screamed. <b>Did</b> <b>that</b> <b>mean</b> she {{was running}} through? Oh, how I wished I had learned the {{interpretation}} of the signals! ...|$|E
6000|$|The girl started, {{and turned}} white to the lips. A long talk with Mr. Spurling! <b>Did</b> <b>that</b> <b>mean</b> {{that he had}} learned her secret? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sir." [...] The boots of Albert {{could be}} heard racing upstairs. Holyhead? <b>Did</b> <b>that</b> <b>mean</b> that, after all----Tommy was puzzled. He read on slowly.|$|E
3000|$|Kenny: There was a {{worksheet}} {{that you}} have to fill in. <b>Does</b> <b>that</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> the worksheet actually doesn’t help? [...]...|$|R

60|$|CLEOPATRA. Infatuated? What <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>mean?</b> Made foolish, is it not? Oh no: I wish I were.|$|R
60|$|So {{he wished}} to {{introduce}} her to his sisters! What <b>did</b> <b>that</b> <b>mean?</b> If the Deyncourts were ever so high they could not sneer at Lord Northmoor's sisters.|$|E
60|$|But was it? Once more alert, Sam became cautious. True, {{the light}} {{seemed to be}} off, but <b>did</b> <b>that</b> <b>mean</b> {{anything}} in a country-house, where people had the habit of going and strolling about the garden at all hours? Probably they were still popping about all over the place. At any rate, it was not worth risking {{coming out of his}} lair. He remembered that Webster had promised to come and knock an all-clear signal on the door. It would be safer to wait for that.|$|E
6000|$|Turning {{over that}} phrase in his mind, Hodder went slowly {{back towards the}} parish house. God trusted individuals--even such as Kate Marcy. What <b>did</b> <b>that</b> <b>mean?</b> Individual responsibility! He {{repeated}} it. Was the world on that principle, then? It was as though a search-light were flung ahead of him and he saw, dimly, a new order--a new order in government and religion. And, as though spoken by a voice out of the past, there sounded in his ears the text of that sermon which had so deeply moved him, [...] "I will arise and go to my Father." ...|$|E
5000|$|Bing Crosby sings [...] "When The Folks High Up <b>Do</b> <b>That</b> <b>Mean</b> Lowdown", in {{his first}} solo film performance.|$|R
5000|$|Just in {{the spirit}} of trying to get the answer, <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>mean</b> no American ground troops? (Anderson Cooper) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{said the}} eldest brother; [...] "but what exactly <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>mean?</b> Just what <b>does</b> it mean--when <b>that</b> day of trouble comes?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Byrne {{found it}} a hard matter not to fall into {{listening}} to the silence. Somehow he had the conviction that nothing would break it unless he heard again the haunting sound of Tom’s voice. He had heard it twice before. Odd! And yet no wonder, he argued with himself reasonably, since he had been thinking of the man for over thirty hours continuously and, what’s more, inconclusively. For his anxiety for Tom had never taken a definite shape. “Disappear,” was the only word connected {{with the idea of}} Tom’s danger. It was very vague and awful. “Disappear!” What <b>did</b> <b>that</b> <b>mean?</b> ...|$|E
60|$|But it {{was only}} a pang. The only too-natural recoil came the next minute. Was not she as {{religious}} as there was any need to be, or at least as she could be without alienating her children or affecting more than she felt? Give herself to Him? How? <b>Did</b> <b>that</b> <b>mean</b> a great deal of church-going, sermon-reading, cottage visiting, prayers, meditations, and avoidance of pleasure? That would never do; the boys would not bear it, and Janet would be alienated; besides, it would be hypocrisy in one who could not sit still and think, or attend to anything lengthy and wearisome.|$|E
6000|$|The cold slime of {{the ditch}} covered his whole body; and, when the bell rang for study and the lines filed out of the playrooms, he felt the cold air of the {{corridor}} and staircase inside his clothes. He still tried to think what was the right answer. Was it right to kiss his mother or wrong to kiss his mother? What <b>did</b> <b>that</b> <b>mean,</b> to kiss? You put your face up like that to say good night and then his mother put her face down. That was to kiss. His mother put her lips on his cheek; her lips were soft and they wetted his cheek; and they made a tiny little noise: kiss. Why did people do that with their two faces? ...|$|E
2500|$|You and Senator Kerry {{have said}} that the war in Iraq is the wrong war at the wrong time. <b>Does</b> <b>that</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> if you had been {{president}} and vice president that Saddam Hussein would still be in power? ...|$|R
5000|$|Clark Collis: Morgan {{talked about}} “clearing” {{a couple of}} times — and episode was titled [...] "Clear." [...] What <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>mean?</b> ...|$|R

6000|$|But {{the thing}} that struck home and set him raging was the part played by the Amazonian prisoner. To the {{counterpart}} of that astounding belligerent--identical at least, {{in the way of}} experience--to one, by her own confession, thus far fallen, had he, not three hours since, been united in marriage. How desirable and natural it had seemed to him then, and how monstrous it seemed now! How the words of diamond thief number two yet burned in his ears: [...] "If you ever get a girl, she'll have a picnic." [...] What <b>did</b> <b>that</b> <b>mean</b> but that women instinctively knew him for one they could hoodwink? Still again, there reverberated the policeman's sapient contribution to his agony: [...] "A man these days and nights wants to know what his women folks are up to." [...] Oh, yes, he had been a fool; he had looked at things from the wrong standpoint.|$|E
60|$|All this, {{and much}} more that he heard, made Ferrars ponder, and anxiously. No cabinet without parliament. It was but reasonable. A {{dissolution}} was therefore in his interest. And yet, what a prospect! A considerable expenditure, and yet with a considerable expenditure a doubtful result. Then reconstruction on a broad basis--what <b>did</b> <b>that</b> <b>mean?</b> Neither more nor less than rival candidates for office. There was no lack of converts. He dare say not. A great deal had developed since his exile at Hurstley--things which are not learned by newspapers, or even private correspondence. He spoke to Barron after dinner. He had reason to believe Barron was his friend. Barron could give no opinion about dissolution; all depended on Peel. But they were acting, and had been acting for some time, as if dissolution were on the cards. Ferrars had better call upon him to-morrow, and go over the list, and see what would be done for him. He had every claim.|$|E
60|$|Stephen {{looked at}} {{the faces of the}} fellows but they were all looking across the playground. He wanted to ask {{somebody}} about it. What <b>did</b> <b>that</b> <b>mean</b> about the smugging in the square? Why did the five fellows out of the higher line run away for that? It was a joke, he thought. Simon Moonan had nice clothes and one night he had shown him a ball of creamy sweets that the fellows of the football fifteen had rolled down to him along the carpet {{in the middle of the}} refectory when he was at the door. It was the night of the match against the Bective Rangers; and the ball was made just like a red and green apple only it opened and it was full of the creamy sweets. And one day Boyle had said that an elephant had two tuskers instead of two tusks and that was why he was called Tusker Boyle but some fellows called him Lady Boyle because he was always at his nails, paring them.|$|E
6000|$|... 'How merciless you are!' {{she said}} bitterly. 'Wait for you? What <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>mean,</b> Charley? You never showed--anything to wait for--anything special towards me.' ...|$|R

2500|$|In 2001, Riegel {{was voted}} one of Soaps' Hottest Newcomers by Soap Opera Digest and the {{following}} year as one of Soaps' Hottest Teens by the same magazine. Riegel modestly accepted, [...] "What <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>mean,</b> 'hot?' <b>Does</b> <b>that</b> <b>mean</b> I'm hot, like sexy? I feel pretty damn hot. I wish I knew what it meant. No, that's very flattering." [...] In 2003, Bianca was {{the winner of the}} first GLAAD Media Award as Favorite OUT Image. With her win, GLAAD released a statement: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I! Changed!" [...] {{she exclaimed}} {{in the same}} low tone. [...] "My {{convictions}} calling me away! It was cruel to hear this, because my trouble is that I am weak and cannot see what I ought to do. You know that. And to end it all I did a selfish thing. To remove her suspicions of myself I told her of Mr. Razumov. It was selfish of me. You know we were completely right in agreeing to keep the knowledge away from her. Perfectly right. Directly I told her of our poor Victor's friend being here I saw how right we have been. She {{ought to have been}} prepared; but in my distress I just blurted it out. Mother got terribly excited at once. How long has he been here? What did he know, and why did he not come to see us at once, this friend of her Victor? What <b>did</b> <b>that</b> <b>mean?</b> Was she not to be trusted even with such memories as there were left of her son?... Just think how I felt seeing her, white like a sheet, perfectly motionless, with her thin hands gripping the arms of the chair. I told her it was all my fault." ...|$|E
50|$|That {{very same}} year, Governor Huey Pierce Long, Jr., persuaded the Louisiana State Legislature to fund schoolbooks for all {{children}} attending public schools. Not only <b>did</b> <b>that</b> <b>mean</b> that my brother and sisters and I could finish our education but also thousands of other children could as well. My family never forgot Huey Long and became longtime political supporters of the Long family.|$|E
5000|$|Several Swahili consonants do {{not have}} {{equivalents}} in Arabic, and for them, often no special letters were created unlike, for example, in Persian and Urdu scripts. Instead, the closest Arabic sound is substituted. Not only <b>did</b> <b>that</b> <b>mean</b> that one letter often stands {{for more than one}} sound, but also writers made different choices of which consonant to substitute. Here are some of the equivalents between Arabic Swahili and Roman Swahili: ...|$|E

2500|$|Uyar {{asked his}} Tribunal: [...] "If it's {{a crime to}} carry this watch, your own {{military}} personnel also carry this watch, too, <b>Does</b> <b>that</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> they're just terrorists as well?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "In {{addition}} to discipline and guidance from my mother, I also got the praise and the recognition in our community," [...] he noted. [...] "Every time mother {{got up and}} introduced me, she would tell everybody 50% non-truth by telling them how wonderful I was. And she would tell 50% of the truth… all of those good things that I did in fact do. Why did my mother continue to promote her children in this way? Because she understood that the man she married, Enrique Lozano, {{was a man of}} integrity, a man of honor, a man of value. And to inspire that in me, she had to continue to reinforce in the public eye, in our community, that I was also a man of integrity. And what <b>did</b> <b>that</b> <b>mean</b> in our family? What impression did that give in our community? It gave other people the impression that her firstborn was a man who was going to carry out his father's ways, to carry on our family's honor. I understood this at an early age. t is the one thing inside of me that has held me true to course, the one thing that advanced me forward." ...|$|E
5000|$|The No To Bike Parking Tax campaigners {{took the}} issue to the High Court, arguing that the parking charge was simply a device to raise revenue, and that proper consultation, {{in line with the}} Road Traffic Regulation Act, had not been {{undertaken}} by the Council. [...] By 2009, revenue that Westminster Council was obtaining from parking charges in general, some £81.5 millions per annum from parking meters and parking fines, had already exceeded the £80 millions per annum revenue that it was obtaining from council tax. Councillor Danny Chalkley, the Council's cabinet member for city management, had stated then that no profit was made from parking charges, and that all surpluses (£35 millions in 2008) were invested in the Council's transport projects. [...] Many of the protesters had already asserted, via electronic mail to councillors, letters, and petitions with more than 3,000 signatures, that the Council was using the charge simply to raise revenue. By February 2009, the cost to the Council of creating the extra motorcycle parking bays and the additional security measures, some £300,000, had been exceeded by the £2.2 millions that the Council had obtained from parking charges and fines. [...] The High Court ruled against the campaigners on both counts in July 2010. Lord Justice Pitchford, who heard the case alongside Mr Justice Maddison, stated that the scheme had not been invalidated by Westminster Council budgeting for a modest surplus, nor <b>did</b> <b>that</b> <b>mean</b> that there was an ulterior motive in charging motorcyclists. The Council stated, after the ruling, that it was seeking reimbursement of its £50,000 legal fees from Warren Djanogly, chairman of the NTBPT campaign, whose own legal fees were already estimated to be £70,000.|$|E
5000|$|Lost Souls was {{met with}} {{generally}} positive reviews. In a 2009 review, BBC praised the album, and described the album as a rock record that kept the dance spirit alive, but could also appeal to a pop audience: [...] "Lost Souls was a record that was widely discussed, and people wondered aloud whether its success {{marked the end of}} another era of dance music. In truth, it was a record about growing up; about giving up the drugs and the madness of The Haçienda, where the three Cheshire lads met. But because the simmering emotion on songs like [...] "The Cedar Room" [...] was expressed through guitars rather than synths, in no way <b>did</b> <b>that</b> <b>mean</b> that Doves were taking dance music out the back and burying it in a shallow grave. But there was emotion, too - [...] "The Cedar Room" [...] is a beautiful seven-minute break-up song that complains: [...] "I tried to sleep alone, but I couldn't do it." [...] This was a pop album that eventually appealed widely, and not just to the grown-up clubbers that could have been its sole audience." [...] Q called the album [...] "heavy, sombre and lugubrious ... it makes for seriously claustrophobic listening, until it takes a great gulp of euphoria." [...] NME awarded the album 9 out of 10 stars, and called the album [...] "a serious and intense record ... the first great album to come from Manchester since Definitely Maybe... they make being sad after drugs sound great." [...] In a mixed review, Pitchfork reviewer Sam Eccleston took a [...] "straightforward" [...] and [...] "cynical" [...] approach with the album and rated it 6.8 out of 10, saying, [...] "Tonally, Lost Souls reflects the after-after-midnight hours, as if the boys felt the need to document the hung-over and blissed-out aftermath of the dancing-hours frenzy their Sub Sub days offered listeners years ago." [...] The review goes on to say that, [...] "The heart of the problem on Lost Souls is its overreaching ambition ... but ... despite its reach and ambition, works best in its most conventionally melodic moments." ...|$|E
